Edit: the stupid bot won’t even allow links to individual images. Go to that website and add /p/B21rR-ShLQ3/ to see the image in context."
shittyfoodporn,fgn508f,t1_fgn0d6r,1580937823.0,Fun fact: metal shavings are exactly how breakfast cereal is “fortified” with iron.  You can recover the iron by swirling a strong magnet in your morning bowl of Cheerios.
aww,fgjrik4,t1_fgilf30,1580849973.0,It’s *cross-legged*. We’re not fucking children.
edmproduction,fggj1bg,t1_fgfytr6,1580762891.0,"I’ll be honest I’ve never heard the term tracker before, though from the name I’d guess it’s an audio only DAW? Like a multi track recorder? After all when we record audio we call it tracking, which I don’t usually use to refer to recording/sequencing MIDI."
moodle,fggfq2w,t1_fggf4h4,1580760916.0,"Have they specified what counts as “course content” at least? This is at best, ad hoc, partially structured hierarchical data - definitely not a *single document*. If they’re married to using MS tools, surely OneNote is a far better option.

Because Moodle operates as a collection of more-or-less independent plugins, with no strict rules on how each of them is structured, the idea of “export to Word” doesn’t make sense for… well, heaps of them. Depending on how down and dirty you’re willing to get, though, I think you could make a reasonable approximation using the small amount of standardisation between activity module plugins.

However, what I’m thinking of involves either using the configurable reports plugin or direct access to the database. Do you have access to either?"

This might be the worst policy I’ve ever heard in my 10+ year career in ed tech. Congratulations!"
