By all accounts, that dog was as nasty as they come, but I was 6 and didn't give a shit. Grandma would turn on the air, and I'd have my tent.

Good friend of mine from high school made some bad decisions back in his early 20s and as a convicted felon literally couldn't get a job anywhere else.

Don't keep in touch with him much anymore since I'm not on Facebook and live on the other side of the world, but I suppose I should get in contact with him and see how things are going."

thatHappened,ffak3mu,t3_esgwqb,1579737709.0,"While the authenticity of this event is certainly questionable, I would like to mention something that happened a few weeks ago at a family event. Can't remember what it was for, but it's possible it was one of the holiday celebrations.

Niece's son is probably 4, maybe 5. Short little kid, quiet, and apparently very independent. Food was setup outside and there were maybe 30-40 people in attendance. Nephew goes through the buffet-style line and gets food from the table that is close to the same height as him. Basically blindly using the tongs and grabbing rolls and pieces of ham and roast beef from the trays. That in itself is impressive, but not the best part. He then notices that there's nowhere to sit, so he goes off to the corner of the garage and grabs a small plastic table that's actually perfect for his size. Drags that thing with one hand, holding his plate of food with the other, and situates himself not far from the food, but still conveniently out of the way of pretty much everyone. Grabs a bucket (or small chair, can't remember), sits down at his table, and eats. Didn't say a word and didn't require any assistance. He knew what he needed to do and he did it.

I'm sure this story is far less exciting than when it happened, so I guess it's one of those ""you had to be there"" moments. Still, it was the most independent thing I've ever seen a small child do without completely fucking it up and requiring an adult to help clean up the inevitable mess."
