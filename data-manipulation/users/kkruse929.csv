FirstTimeHomeBuyer,ff9yj69,t3_esgtda,1579724258.0,you can make an offer but before you close you will have to verify your assets.  You will need to have everything in order before you close.
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,ff9s8he,t3_esfyp8,1579720080.0,"We had a rate lock, however ever 90 days they would re-run our credit. We got pre-approved in March of 2019 and close next week. Our rate has not changed since the lock was put in place."
DisneyWorld,ff9qxyq,t3_esfy69,1579719079.0,"we took our son to Disney World a few years back.  He was just shy of 2 at the time.  I had so many expectations, however my son was scared of all the characters.    On the last day we met up with some friends who happened to be starting their vacation.  Their kids wanted to see Daisy duck.  So we all stood in line talking me not expecting anything.  When it was our turn Daisy saw my son hide behind me and kinda crouched down.  That was it.  My son ran into her lap and laid with her for about 7 minutes while we all took a ton of pics.  Makes me tear up thinking about it.  This place is true magic!!  I cant wait to go back!!"
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,ff9l1ux,t3_esexez,1579715248.0,We close next week!!!  Our house is older and when we looked at it we fell in love.  However there were concerns about the basement walls  We had the inspection done and even had another company come in just to look at the basement.  Everything checked out and we were able to proceed.  Good Luck!!!

DisneyWorld,fenvecw,t3_eq3ph6,1579291478.0,First off Im so sorry for your loss.  This is a very sweet way for you to remember your child.   Maybe you could go and pay the balloon guys and tell them the next x amount of balloons are on me.  I havent been to Disney in a few years so Im not sure about much else.  We hope to be able to bring our boys in the next few years!

He grew out of it within a few months but it really sucked for the time it happened.  Hope its a phase for your child as well, good luck!"
family,fegsenk,t3_eow1un,1579101448.0,"Yes I would hire him, and have.  We moved to a very tiny remote town in Virginia.  My son was 2 at the time.  We found a great church, both my son and myself loved this church.  One of the aids in his room was a teen boy.  My son grew close to him. One Sunday I asked him if he would be interested in watching my son for a few hours one evening.  He agreed and soon became my go to sitter.  I have no issues with hiring a male or female sitter.  I want to see more background of the person, make sure they are a good person I can trust with my child."

breakingmom,fdnhjmn,t3_em7zab,1578585943.0,"Oh mommy, Its hard for sure.  Do you have any family close that could come one night and watch your child so you can get some needed sleep.  I have to say this is the hardest part.  Getting through the first year with no sleep.  Its gets better, you will sleep again.  Remind each other that your frustrations are super high bc of the lack of sleep and try to be nicer to each other.  Also maybe have your husband try a mouth guard for his snoring,  I know when you sleep you roll over unintentionally and start to snore so dont blame him too much for that. Good Luck!!"
