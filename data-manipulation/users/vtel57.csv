Here's a link to a site that may help and also spur your interest in this era:

OldSchoolCool,fffb02u,t1_ffe5a3u,1579879984.0,"I wholeheartedly agree! I was fortunate enough to be able to hear the stories of this era from the men and women who experienced and participated in it... my father, mother, numerous uncles, etc. I will be forever grateful for the insights and knowledge regarding this event that they passed on to me. It has helped to make me who I am now."
OldSchoolCool,fffapvh,t1_ffepzfv,1579879805.0,">...one man wanting to literally take over the world. 

Well, two, actually. However, we (the U.S.) allied ourselves with the other one (Stalin) in order to defeat the worst one of the two. 

Unfortunately, having made Stalin a bedfellow during WWII, this lead to the Cold War and an insane nuclear weapons race.

History... interesting stuff. Too bad we don't learn from it. Humans have short memories."
OldSchoolCool,fffa67n,t1_ffei9bg,1579879456.0,"Yeah, a vintage WWI four-stack coal burner.  Can you believe it? He spent most of his time in the N. Atlantic freezing his ass off on escort duty/u-boat hunts. Lotsa' fun for a 17 year old kid, huh? 

Can imagine what that must have been like? No wonder these men and women from that era did so well after the war. They were forged in the fires of WWII."
OldSchoolCool,fff9w0p,t1_ffehl0v,1579879272.0,"Heh... another uncle of mine (deceased now) was out in the S. Pacific, also. He had some crappy luck. 

He had three ships shot out from under him. On the last, an upper bunk came detached from the bulkhead (with sailor in it) and fell across my uncle's legs on the lower bunk. He had a portion of one of his leg bones crushed. He had one leg shorter (by about 1"") for the rest of his life and had to wear a platform shoe on that side.

One good thing that came out of that was his lifetime (he died at 76yrs in '99) U.S. Navy disability pension. I believe it was about $900/month.

He used to joke that he spent his entire time in the U.S. Navy waterlogged because he was in the water more often than he was on a ship. ;)

**RESPECT** and **APPRECIATION** for all of the folks from that generation. They truly were ""*The Greatest*"".

On a side note: My father was also in the Navy during WWII... on the Destroyer Tender U.S.S. Piedmont AD17, which was the first ship to steam into Tokyo Bay ahead of the U.S. armada for the surrender ceremonies in '45."

Cheers!"
AskReddit,ffcnvys,t1_ffcn92t,1579803455.0,"Correct. You chose to have electricity but not clean water. You stated that you were going to boil water. Well, that's fine, but if your municipality has shut off your water supply for non-payment/cancellation, where would you get that water you're going to boil? 

And it we theorize further and decide that you have a well feeding your house, we'd have to assume that your well went dry because the choices on the original post here were electricity OR water.

Anyway, I'm just nit-picking and don't really give a shit about this.

Have a great day. And I hope you will continue to have clean water AND electricity in your home from now on. :)"
