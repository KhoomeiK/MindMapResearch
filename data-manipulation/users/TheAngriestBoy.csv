SelfAwarewolves,ffhzz7c,t1_ffh7fha,1579960817.0,"That's the best part of these types of people. I had a guy over in r/personalfinance explaining how we don't need to change anything about the price of college because he saved up from the age of ten and was able to afford it or whatever. Don't you realize my point is that you shouldn't have had to do that!? But you want that for your own children? 

It's like they're proud they got fucked by the system but survived, so now we can't make it better for anyone else or that would be unfair."

nottheonion,ff4nym1,t1_ff4boo8,1579568232.0,The district pays well enough (relatively) that they don't seem to have a problem filling spots.

nottheonion,ff3m0it,t1_ff3kse6,1579543910.0,"My fiancee is a teacher and the district is certainly guilty of pushing the older (more expensive) teachers out the door when replacing them with a fresh new (read: <40k) face is an option. It's truly awful what's happened in this country, and for some reason half the country is psyched about the top 1% hoarding all of the additional wealth that's been created over the last 50 years while gutting programs and institutions that actually help normal people."
nottheonion,ff3262q,t1_ff2vzjr,1579531713.0,"Just point out that practically nobody gives a pension anymore. The real reason for employee loyalty was that **they** took care of **you** once you were too old to work, seems fair that you should be loyal to them to earn that. Now that that's gone, and we basically have to prepare for retirement by ourselves, screw them and look out for number 1, that's all anyone can do in this capitalist hellscape."
