Society decided it means something else, not me. And it was never intended to mean what Americans chose to believe.

Just like democracy originally meant just white, male landowners could vote, the meaning of socialism has evolved.

At it's core it has never changed: The means of production should benefit society and not just the owners. There's different ways to go about it. Currently socialism means things like benefits for the public paid for by corporations.

That's what socialists like AOC and Bernie are about. Marx would probably hate them."

And I'm just telling you that socialism has a bad reputation and is misunderstood, because it is portrayed falsely.

Check out what the actual demands of people like AOC or Bernie Sanders are. They don't want to make companies state-owned, they want things like corporations paying for health-care, paid sick days, retirement packages and that this is paid for by corporations, not the public. 

Raising taxes to finance these things or giving money to banks is not socialist. 

The basic idea is that corporations should provide for their employees as well as those that can't work. 

No ill will and I have to admit I'm hopeful you give Bernie the benefit of the doubt and look up what his core demands are, not so you vote him, just so you can check out what he actually wants and how he is portrayed in the media.

Doesn't matter to me whom you vote for, I just don't like people dissing socialism without fully understanding it, because I'm a socialist and I fucking hate communists(my wife lived under communist regime in East Germany and you wouldn't believe the stories she can tell)."

Remarkably, he thus outlined large-scale aspects of our cosmology, while Copernicus and Kepler mistakenly thought the universe is spherical, the sun is its center, unmoving, and stars are not suns surrounded by planets“.

Again, he wasn't convicted for those beliefs, so what exactly is your point? The argument was *never* about whether the universe had a center or not, it was all about the plurality of worlds. He also believed that planets had souls, which wasn't an argument for conviction either at the time. You're messing up causality here for the sake of winning an argument.

Btw: You seem to think that Bruno was a scientist, which is funny. He was a mystic who was charged for many heresies at the same time. His belief that the universe did not have a center was of very little interest to the people persecuting him, it came on top of a big pile of other accusations. *Plurality of worlds* was a big issue for the church that they came after with a vengance. *Heliocentrism* was not a big issue to the church comparatively. Galileo changed that somewhat, but as far as the evidence goes, the church never executed someone for heliocentrism.

Nowadays they're called astrophysicists, so why bring it up?"

Cool, could you give me the list of scientists or is a very long list of heretics all you can provide? Because you will not find a lot of scientists on that list, and even less cosmologists.

You should really read that article. It explains that it wasn't about the earth being the center of the universe. It was about the existence of other worlds, major difference. Great read btw, thanks.

And if you have some evidence to refute my claim, by all means bring it. I'd love to prove my former professor wrong."

Copernicus questioned whether the Earth was the center of the universe and the pope at the time agreed. Galileo came later and he was mostly persecuted for mocking the pope."
