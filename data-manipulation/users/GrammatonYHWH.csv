Britain's a bit more socially relaxed, so people aren't very keen to appear strict, super formal, and mature. Unlike the US, we don't force a clear divide between being a kid living with your parents and being a man or a woman with a career.

On the flipside, young people aren't looked down upon with a dismissive attitude. Overall, my experience is that in Britain, we are more skills focused while in the US, they are more age focused. We look at what people can and can't do while in the US, people directly assume that someone younger than them can't do anything.

So being called a girl, a boy, lassie, or lad isn't really derogatory or dismissive in Britain."

Now the LGBT movement picks up and they demand the same treatment. Now the issue is that, in the public consciousness, marriage is still framed the way it was 400 years ago. People don't actively think about tax breaks and other bureaucratic concepts like that.

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3""03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close with this level of compatibility.

At the end of the day, all evidence points to the conclusion that there's nothing metaphysical about us. There is no soul that goes on as a spectator without the ability to interact with the world.

gifsthatkeepongiving,fej004r,t1_feizl4m,1579152101.0,4chan is fucking with you. They've also tried to make the a-ok sign into a White Power sign. And I think they tried convincing people the lgbt rainbow flag means all races should be separated.

CatastrophicFailure,fegonyz,t1_fegk62u,1579098869.0,"You sound like the kind of person who'd pick something off the ground that looks and smells like shit and stick it in your mouth because ""nobody has done lab analysis to prove it's shit"".

And saying 500 medical professionals have examined a photo and identified it as shit, you'd still eat it because that you wouldn't fall for such an ""appeal to authority"".

Just admit you're not as smart and as special as you'd want to be, and that there are people out there with a lot more intelligence and experience. Us normal people are perfectly happy to rely on the educated conclusions of experts because our ego isn't prone to shattering at every hint that the universe doesn't revolve around us."

It effectively renders the voting process meaningless."

CatastrophicFailure,fefusv4,t1_fef7aka,1579065885.0,"Oh yeah. The US and Mossad developed a worm which made routers synchronously transmit, causing sufficient constructive/destructive interference at the right frequency to excite traces in PLCs and deliver the payload across an air gap. **HaCk ThE wOrLd** /s

No, you fucking idiot. Kaspersky concluded that either an employee plugged in a USB they found in the parking lot, an employee carried the infection across the air gap with a USB stick, or the CIA/Mossad got an agent on the inside to plug in the USB stick."

AskReddit,fedhvud,t3_eokz7h,1579011938.0,"Yes. I certainly have criticism against a small minority of the LGBTQ+ population, but there are utter fucking idiots in every segment of the population.

Some examples being parents forcing their kids to grow up non-binary/trans. For fuck's sake, that's the exact same thing as parents forcing their kids to be straight.

Also, trans people being extremely vocal about straight men having to date them. Good god, no. If gay biosex males were born attracted to biosex males, then cis biosexmales were born attracted to cis biosex females."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,fecouy1,t1_fechls6,1578979443.0,"Honestly, I find it infinitely simpler than digital computers. I stopped being able to understand computers just after ICs. It's just too obfuscated and large in scope. With an automatic transmission, you can follow the hydraulic paths and then get a picture of how it works in your head.
8.
With CPUs, it's billions of transistors and it's impossible to trace the pathways. You end up needing abstraction to draw the diagram. You used to be able to represent groups of transistors as gates. Now you can't even do that. You use giant black boxes for the different computing blocks, and you technically know how it works. But you don't actually understand the exact route electricity takes to get from one input trace to produce an electrical output on another trace.

Plus, they're programmable electric circuits. You send a command in, and the transistors are switched on and off to send the signal elsewhere. The circuit diagram is so massive that only the CPU designers have an idea of the circuit layout."
Games,fecnxk5,t1_fecinf5,1578978688.0,Not exactly. Another big thing was that Microsoft focused their presentation on the xbox being a media centre/social media bullshit something. Playstation focuses on their game console being a game console.
restofthefuckingowl,fe9zf93,t1_fe8rqiz,1578942812.0,"Yeah, but it isn't exceptionally significant. People talk about index funds like it's a one way ticket to becoming a millionaire. At best, you'll get a slightly nicer retirement after 50 years of compound interest. That's not considering inflation.

With inflation accounted for, you're only getting 300 extra a year out of your 10 grand invested."
