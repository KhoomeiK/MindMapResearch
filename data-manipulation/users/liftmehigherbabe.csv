offmychest,ffi0vzi,t1_ffi00s6,1579961697.0,"When our own self worth is lowered we can feel that it is not within us to have the power to stand up. I went through a period of sexual harassment at work before Christmas when I know I was struggling personally. It was like the person had a magnet to my devalued state and was taking advantage of it. I took a few weeks off and did some healing and when I came back I was feeling completely different and I was just waiting for him to try something. However that chance has not come because I am feeling so much better about myself and he can’t even seem to look me in the eye. 

You are not crazy for thinking this man was being inappropriate. If it made you uncomfortable it was inappropriate and not ok. He could very well be someone who thinks it’s no big deal and this is just the way he treats women, or he has a warped  interpretation of what friendliness is or what it means. 

I am not for a second suggesting you brought this on. What I am suggesting is that you deserve to feel your own value and self worth so that you can put this ass in his place if you ever need to in the future. 

I wouldn’t rely on your husband to fortify your place in the world. That’s your power. Yes it would be nice to be validated, but we can also learn to do that for ourselves when others don’t understand."
AlAnon,ffh69g2,t1_ffh656f,1579924272.0,That was 19 days ago. As far as I know he is still there. I’ve been going to AlAnon twice a week for myself.
AlAnon,ffh61mz,t1_ffh450i,1579924100.0,"My partner, well ex, I don’t even know what to call him anymore, told me it’s best if I never contact him ever again and he blocked me on everything. the night before he entered a treatment program.  Because I said I support him and believe in him and know his heart.  Be cause my words were just manipulating  words apparently. 

I love him unconditionally from wherever I am.  And trust his process will take him where he needs to go and that it’s just not my journey."
AlAnon,fff0skn,t1_ffdrrck,1579872520.0,This was why I didn’t get help or support for myself for a long time. My self worth didn’t allow it. You have your own demons stopping you from living your best life. Start going to meetings and keep going back. It’s not a comparison game- that keeps us trapped because we can ALWAYS justify someone ‘having it worse’.
AlAnon,fff0go9,t1_ffc2l7r,1579872236.0,"I don’t see ANYTHING wrong with your actions and choices. 

Just try to remember that you introducing a consequence is not about making her change, it is the natural result of what happens when the boundaries you put in place for yourself are ignored, disrespected or crossed.  

We still can never be responsible for another persons choices and while their choices may hurt us, and not be what we want, (we WANT TO BE WITH the healthiest version of them) we can only take care of ourselves and what we allow to be in our life influencing our wellbeing."
AlAnon,ffey9rh,t3_et53e3,1579870208.0,"Why are you supporting him financially? Why are you taking responsibility for him getting alcohol by giving him that money in the first place? To me that money is needed for other responsibilities (ie saving for YOUR retirement/own home/therapy) and it’s no longer available to him. 
He’s a grown ass man. If he needs money for the things he wants he can do what the rest of us have to do and work for it.  Separate out the finances completely and stop owning / taking care of his booze allowance. 

One step at a time to become interdependent - this post is the hard and clear line for me but might need a far softer approach from you."
AlAnon,ffexlkk,t1_ffehv9q,1579869547.0,"Could you expand on ‘Think about what choices make it easy to love him’ ?

I don’t quite understand this statement and would like to."
AlAnon,ffewif2,t3_et7ot7,1579868431.0,"I can totally relate to your post. Start investing in Yourself and you alone. I know we hear that over and over - it’s because it is true.  You checking up on him and trying to get him to see the light through others is still you trying to manipulate (inspire, trigger) change. 

And you didn’t cause it, can’t control it or cure it.  You CANT control it or him or what will cause him to shift. 

But you can control your learning which will in turn affect your healing and your tendencies to put him first or codependently think/behave. 

It took me probably 30 ‘breakups’ to finally ‘get this’.  To detach with love and put a pause in between my thoughts. To truly invest in my independence of soul. And when I did, and was completely no contact, apparently my ex partner his hit bottom and went to rehab. And even STILL my job is to build MY self.  I, have started to go to al-anon and continue with my individual therapy. 

You can do this. You deserve it."
ExNoContact,ffd8y3l,t3_eszsx0,1579815743.0,How about respecting her boundaries???  How about actually being a decent human being and seeing her as such as well??
offmychest,ffcl90h,t3_eswi4a,1579801846.0,"That’s not harassment. That is rape.  And coping with it?  What advice would you give a friend who just shared this story with you? I suspect you would advise her that she deserves to be heard and this perpetrator deserves to be held accountable. And then, healing, not just coping."

...........I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me and it's driving me crazy. I can't go to a therapist or councillor because I don't want anyone to know about this. 

............I don't know what to do. I need to be diagnosed with something or just know what's wrong with me??? what do i do :'(




You have the answer. You typed the answer, you gave a ton of detail and information about what isn’t working, yet you are stopping yourself from doing anything about it because “you don’t want anyone to know about this”

So it’s you and only you standing in the way of the life you say you want."
emotionalabuse,ff4t7rw,t3_ernffc,1579571874.0,"Sweetie this was horrid, horrid abuse. Yes. 
You are not confused. You have brilliant clarity and insight. You were and continue to be brave and full of integrity for having a voice;  that makes my heart swell with pride for you despite know so little about you. 

I am sorry that this was a part of your life. I am sorry that you are now having to find your way through. I support you in finding the perfect therapist who will help you unlock your healing identity so that you can grow forward with peace in your wisdom."

offmychest,feu89gv,t3_eqmu54,1579384114.0,Please don’t. Please just don’t. You only need a single reason for purpose and joy and I t could be a slight as a blade of grass. But you won’t know if you stop looking.   I’ve been where you are. Let the moment pass and step into the next one. Just one moment at a time.
ExNoContact,ferjngy,t3_eqfzbv,1579354744.0,Being addicted to the pattern and to the breadcrumbs can almost always be traced back to your own lowered self worth. Choose to spend the time accepting your own value and trust that you have parts of yourself that deserve to heal. Hoping for validation and acknowledgment from someone outside yourself gets to be a trap real fast.

BPDlovedones,fenu2yf,t3_eq518z,1579290722.0,I could have written this.
BPDlovedones,fen4ohk,t3_eq0jyn,1579276895.0,"I wondered about it as well. I chose not to. To me, it perpetuates the drama and keeps me in the same toxic wavelength that caused me to be misguided. I will no longer ‘compare my experience’ with someone else just to feel like I will be ok. 

Those people, while they might have had a similar experience in some ways, were not with ‘the same’ person I was with. Much like you are not the ‘same’ person you were in your last relationship. Dynamics create different experiences even though we humans seek familiarity.

I realized I don’t need the validation from someone else to confirm what I experienced. It’s far more important to me to rebuild the trust in my own intuition and tap into my own wisdom that I pushed aside then have a conversation and potential bitch fest that is unproductive."

alcoholicsanonymous,fek1sz1,t3_epl4pu,1579190788.0,"You sound very, very hard on yourself. You are reflective so I imagine you have been told that before. Have you ever considered what it really means to ‘be kind’ to yourself?

I ask because I was told time and time again to ‘not be so hard on myself’ yet I truly didn’t know how to do anything differently. I didn’t know what it would look like or feel like to treat myself kindly and with compassion and acceptance and the unconditional love I craved from the world. 

Until I got it.  And then the peace actually started to settle in."
AlAnon,fejsgbt,t1_fejnqlq,1579184730.0,"Wow. Didn’t expect the words strong and uplifting. Truthfully.   

I miss him every minute. But I know that I just wasn’t being my best self in many many circumstances as the relationship evolved. And while I’m not doing my healing work for him, I do hold out hope that he will be in my future. 

I wish him insight and awareness and healing and strength. And hope that maybe we can have as healthy a relationship one day as it was toxic at times. 

All while still acknowledging this might be misguided and that some would say it’s a waste of my time and it’s not worth ‘waiting for’. I don’t see it as waiting aimlessly if I am growing in the meantime."
AlAnon,fejoeyq,t3_epbghg,1579181587.0,Such a thoughtful and honest reply. Thank you for taking the time. You have a wisdom and centeredness that has definitely helped you grow forward.  I am proud of you for fueling your underlying dignity and wholeness.
AlAnon,fejmyw1,t1_feix91o,1579180314.0,Do you consider renewing a relationship?  My partner went into rehab after we split up as well and is currently in a 30 day treatment facility. Initiated on his own after this last traumatic breakup. I don’t know the specific circumstances of what contributed to his decision. But I am so proud of him and hopeful.
AlAnon,fejm0h3,t3_epi9aw,1579179426.0,"Mine acknowledged it in Christmas Day in face time to me. We hadn’t had any contact for 52 days. Hadn’t seen each other since mid October. This after he had a very abusive episode and left my daughter and I stranded in a very traumatic manner. 

I had cut off contact because he couldn’t acknowledge how abusive he is. And he couldn’t stop with his berating and accusations. 

I love him. And believe in him and have this undying hope that made me codependent. So while working on myself, it turns out he went into rehab. 

He shared that on Christmas Day and told me he’d be going into a residential treatment centre for 30 days. We communicated by phone and text a little bit for a week. But my trust for him is so shaken I really had to keep my boundaries in place and didn’t see him. 

Because I didn’t see him he flipped on me and blocked me the night before he checked in. After I offered my support and willingness to contribute to the process. Essentially he told me I I only say what people want to hear and my words are meaningless and it’s best if I never contact him again. He mistakes my boundaries and my taking care of myself as an attack or a slight against him.

I am trusting the process and working on myself. I know I can only take care of myself and even though he is offended when I do, I must.  I love him. I’m want to be with him for the rest of my life. But his promises just don’t cut it anymore. His actions would need to back it up. 

He’s been gone for 10 days and would now be allowed telephone access but he has not called. Yes I hope for the call each night. But I also know it’s because I’d want to hear evolution and change and awareness and that might not be possible. It might not be fair of me to hold that hope for him and us. 

So I am in limbo to an extent but the wretched pain of the breakup has diminished somewhat and I accept that I will love him from afar without contact. In the meantime I am reaffirming my independence and my identity and continuing to heal."
ptsd,fe35o0q,t3_eno6xw,1578846134.0,"Even if you are remembering incidents ‘wrong’ according to your mom or parents, you are remembering them according to your perspective which shaped your beliefs and thoughts about yourself. This impacts our self worth and many other spin offs. Whether it helps to add information to adjust your perspective or whether you accept your perspective and work from there, to me the important task is to heal and positively impact your self worth and/or limiting beliefs that are creating a less than satisfying current day life experience. 

I’ve suggested it before in other threads but a book that has helped me tremendously is called Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents.  Essentially it gives a well organized overview of how we are impacted by the unconscious choices our caregivers might have made. Whether that was due to them not having a ‘parent manual’ or a result of very poor /abusive parenting."
AlAnon,fdztojk,t3_enggaz,1578795545.0,Can I ask though- why are YOU cleaning up?
ExNoContact,fdwbz1l,t3_en5par,1578757165.0,I wish for you a moment of peace where you choose to stop handing yourSELF over to another. No other person can take care of us or love ourselves better than us. We are magnetic when we realize our wholeness and take care of it as though it is priceless. It is.
AskWomenOver30,fdw4if1,t1_fdvd4as,1578754949.0,"It seems that this response suggests a person should ‘contrive’ their personality and follow some set of ‘rules’ to ‘get a man’. This really discounts emotional maturity, integrity and honesty.  I suspect that if one were to incorporate self respect, interdependence, genuine curiosity and lack of assumption there would be far fewer head games played in the world."
BPDlovedones,fdvvag3,t3_en2u9m,1578751879.0,"One insight that has come to me is that I mistook emotional intelligence for emotional maturity. I combined them thinking they are one and the same. And it allowed me to overlook the gaps and behaviours. A book that has help give me perspective is Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents.  While it is referencing parents, it was my partner (and me as well) to the final paragraph. And it helped educate me on what I misunderstood and overcompensated for."
BreakUps,fdimxg9,t3_eljpnl,1578446488.0,"Seeking validation, admiration and attention outside the relationship is absolutely a) an emotional affair and b) something she has likely become ‘addicted to’ to the detriment of the relationship.  She is living in make-believe and you were getting nothing more than burnt crumbs. You have done the right thing at this point. Reclaim your sense of self and your individuality as a focus while you grieve. Rest assured that nothing needs to happen immediately - good or bad - decision wise and therefore you CAN completely focus on yourself and your emotional rebirth. I was her decades ago. I figured my shit out and realized how half assed I was doing life and how below my values my choices were. I had lived wearing a mask and finally grew up when there was no other choice but to learn how to be me."
