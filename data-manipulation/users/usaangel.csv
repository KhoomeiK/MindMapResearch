TurkishGreek,fffvgcv,t3_eslq8g,1579892669.0,"I don't know about Greece subreddit since I've never visited it but Turkey sub basically gone downhill after the Afrin operation. Some ultra nationalist Turks came here, Reddit, to hear about news, opinions of other people and of course just spitting their nationalistic ideas around. It's a shame really. As a Turk I don't feel any internal hostility against any nation Greek, Armenian, Kurd, Arab etc. Some people are just plain dumb I guess"
fatlogic,ffenegy,t1_ffem7b9,1579855782.0,Idk. As an ELT student I appreciate cultural differences in languages despite the fact that I have a really hard time understanding them
fatlogic,ffem5oq,t1_ffelm3w,1579854010.0,I know what AAVE is we studied it in our linguistics course. Its just not cool to call it broken English of black people. Accent is not something you learn it's something you acquire
fatlogic,ffelbvk,t1_ffel7uw,1579852900.0,I agree that it's almost impossible for me to understand AAVE speakers but it's probably I'm not an American so I don't see African American people on a daily basis. Your comment has unnecessary racism
fatlogic,ffd5jpk,t1_ffd5co2,1579813839.0,I don't know. I'm 100% sure there are some people who care about even the most stupid shit you can think of
fatlogic,ffd4478,t1_ffd3s9k,1579813043.0,African American Vernacular English
syriancivilwar,ffc1stv,t3_esqjbo,1579789382.0,I don't think so. As another redditor has suggested Chinese Civil War and Sino-Japanese War in the 30's were much more complicated than Syrian Civil War but it's not a headache
loseit,ffbtsol,t1_ffb9ri6,1579782479.0,Most of it would be metabolized. Once I ate 7000 calories above my maintenance and after that I continued to eat at my maintenance for a week. After 1 week I was 0.7 kg above my previous weight. Not 2 full pounds but very close
fatlogic,ffbowvs,t1_ffbnxql,1579776369.0,After eating a lot of carbs or a lot of sodium your body retains water. The difference can be as large as 5-6 pounds but when you reduce your carb and sodium intake that water weight comes off pretty quickly
fatlogic,ff3szyh,t1_ff3sjys,1579548201.0,"The point I'm trying to make is you said ""It's not the quantity that's the problem, it's the quality""  and that's just wrong. For fat people, the quantity is exactly the problem. Even if you eat quality, healthy food you can get fat when you eat more than you need. Your first statement says it's not the case"
fatlogic,ff3otiz,t1_ff3o7s0,1579545647.0,"You don't need to be fat to have fatlogic. Quality of food effects your health and life in many ways. But if your TDEE is 2000 calories and you eat ""2-3 1250 calorie meals"" you will get fat. The reason you're not fat is your TDEE is either lower than what you eat or equal not because you eat quality foods."
fatlogic,ff2k24n,t1_ff25dq0,1579509708.0,This is one of those rare times I see fatlogic in the comment section of this sub
fatlogic,fdttnci,t1_fdsnhb5,1578722016.0,Those are rookie numbers you gotta pumb those numbers up /s
gaming,fdq6sv0,t1_fdq4bh2,1578657338.0,"Odyssey isn't an Assassin's Creed game, let alone a proper one"
fatlogic,fd9etnw,t1_fd9ebjx,1578232450.0,I think it's smallfat if you can see the legs while sitting
fatlogic,fd7zrwb,t3_ek9vqn,1578212321.0,That picture is barely a smallfat. Take your smallfat privilege and get out lmao
fatlogic,fd7xqiw,t1_fd5h92z,1578211592.0,That's not true
fatlogic,fcyb4xn,t1_fcy1dwt,1578077495.0,Men definitely can have EDs and it's much more cruel because you can't talk about your ED to your friends or parents because you're men and you're expected to be emotionally strong and stable. At least that's how it is in Turkey
syriancivilwar,fcxzfrv,t1_fcxtpjr,1578072586.0,Intervention in Cyprus was well justified. You can't just genocide Turkish people and expect Turkey to just sit down quietly
omad,fcryvoe,t1_fcrxcdr,1577908597.0,"Hey if you can do it, you may as well do it. Water fasting is definitely not harmfull for human body when you're an adult and if you take your nutrients at the end of the fast. I don't have that patience though"
Water_Fasting,fcruf5e,t3_eic4gf,1577906751.0,"Unless you eat like 7000 calories after you break your fast, all the weight you gain will be water weight or the physical weight of the food. You don't need to worry about that"
omad,fcrtyft,t1_fcrs1lr,1577906580.0,There's no relevance between a 3 day fast and OMAD. OMAD requires you to eat one meal a day. OP maybe should have posted this to r/Water_Fasting
1500isplenty,fcpe3ka,t1_fcohwc9,1577860061.0,"They're generally the kind of people who can't eat much, who feel full after eating a small bowl of salad etc. My SO is like that. She drinks calorie dense drinks to not lose weight"
1500isplenty,fcnveau,t1_fcnogmv,1577819193.0,Some people go to gym to gain weight
1200isplenty,fcnutku,t1_fcnu1xu,1577818856.0,"There's nothing real about ""mess up your metabolism"""
fatlogic,fckrzzr,t3_ehoffh,1577731923.0,"If you think thin privilege is a real thing why not just lose weight? I don't understand why someone doesn't try to become one of those ""privileged"" people. Also weight loss definitely create a ""new you"" I'm not the same person after I lost I bunch of weight. My character changed as well as my physical appearence"
1200isplenty,fckchjg,t3_ehnnej,1577722230.0,Now I wonder what's the nutritional facts of a rose
godtiersuperpowers,fc5azju,t3_eg7sup,1577451636.0,No more free trials then
fatlogic,fc2gu4c,t1_fc0zp0p,1577359472.0,You don't have high metabolism. You either have a high TDEE because of height or your activity level or you don't actually eat a shit ton. Count your calories
fatlogic,fc2gdow,t3_eft2jm,1577358725.0,This more sounds like r/ketoscience logic
worldnews,fc0bvm6,t1_fc09wgr,1577286299.0,You can persistently lose weight by lifestyle (aka diet) changes
