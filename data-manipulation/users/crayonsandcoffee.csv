unpopularopinion,ff8i2h7,t1_ff8h6a3,1579679455.0,"People are complicated.  Sometimes you work through a lot of issues together and then figure out you have different goals.  Sometimes one or the other partner is very, very deceptive, and manipulative- even to themselves- and it takes awhile for the ""real"" slim shady to stand up.

Sometimes, at the end of all that self critiquing, you both figure out that despite learning to communicate effectively with each other, your personalities really don't mesh for the long term.

It doesn't always have to be the ""I found out he/she was a peice of shit so I left him/her"" narrative.  People evolve and change, and sometimes they outgrow each other, or want to pursue different life paths.  Sometimes circumstances get in the way.  Sometimes you realize you'd be better off as friends.  Sometimes you realize you've been suppressing a vital part of your personhood to please the person you loved for years (like might be the case in ""discovering"" you're gay), and then you realize you can't do that to yourself anymore.

Jesus, people need room to breathe.

We're all trying to figure out this mysterious mess together.  Be gracious and give people space."

SkincareAddiction,fcuyg5b,t3_ej25zz,1577991031.0,"No. Retin-A boosts collagen production and exfoliates at the same time.  If you're breaking out it's because it's exfoliating the top dead layers of skin and the gunk underneath is getting exposed.  It will clear up.

If it seems like your wrinkles are deepening, they are probably a little deeper than what was apparent on the surface and it will take time for these to exfoliate out as well.  Also: Drink more water.

If your skin feels sensitive or is red & irritated, back off your usage to every other day or every couple days.  And you should always use it at night."

Find someone who knows what they want out of connecting intimately to another human being- your self esteem will eventually suffer because of her ambiguity and she is too cowardly to tell you straight up that she doesn't want you.

And you are being too stubbornly masochistic to listen when she tells you to move on."

TrueOffMyChest,fcapmd5,t1_fc9cy7d,1577574055.0,"Wow.  So snotty.  I was under the impression this was the internet, where people can exchange perspectives equally in a public forum?...

If I misunderstood something my apologies- but, by the way your post was worded, I thought your main complaint about the dogs was the number of them, which I can attest through personal experience is tough but not impossible.

Also- I don't think without knowing her personally you can make a value judgement about her character without - ahem - ""coming off"" as an ill-informed ass.  Has she had them in obedience training?  Was she an inexperienced dog owner before this experience?  Do any of them have health or cognitive issues that make this situation more complicated?

... Calling her ""selfish"" is really not fair, and it's honestly really narrow minded, IMHO.  But, hey, you seem like a person who's not really interested in considering multiple viewpoints, only in firing off your judgement as self-righteous gospel to anyone within eye-shot.  

Enjoy that, K"
TrueOffMyChest,fc8gobx,t1_fc7293z,1577534505.0,"Sorry, but I have 3 dogs and am a single woman...I fail to see why having 3 makes one selfish.  I'm a good dog owner, not perfect, but pretty damn good.  My dudes get walked every day, off leash 90% of the time, they get home made meals and expensive soft beds.  There is also no way I could afford to board them every time I go out of town- yet, I manage to afford periodic vet checkups and emergencies.

Just because someone can't afford to board them or has more than one doesn't make them selfish."
