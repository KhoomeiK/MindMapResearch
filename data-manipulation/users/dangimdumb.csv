They have SDcards with 1/gb transfer rates now, still half as good as original DDR but I'm sure a system could run off of it with noticeable results. Dumb idea though, but if i was still a broke teen I'd deffinfetly look into it (i did for readyboost lol). I think of it as CPU > RAM > SDRAM > HARD DRIVE.
