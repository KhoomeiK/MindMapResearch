He was an NYPD officer assigned to the 81st precinct. He witnessed corruption within the precinct and secretly recorded proof. He brought this proof to internal affairs, and he was assured that it would be kept confidential. However, internal affairs told his captain that he reported him. So later that night, when he was in his apartment after his shift, the police came to his apartment and started pounding on the door demanding to be let in. So he took two tape recorders, set them to record, and hid them in his apartment. After a few more minutes, the police were able to get a key to his apartment by telling the landlord that he was suicidal. This was a blatant lie, but it was the first of many. After entering his apartment, they handcuffed him, forced him into an ambulance, and took him to the psych ward of Jamaica Hospital in Queens, NY. They told the doctors that he was delusional, so when he started telling them about the conspiracy, the doctors viewed this as a delusion. He was held there for six days, and he was only released because his father called every hospital in New York City until he found the one where Schoolcraft was being held. After he was released, he went back to his apartment and found that one of the tape recorders had been destroyed by the NYPD. However, they were not able to find the other tape recorder, so that remained in tact. He immediately gave that tape, as well as the original tape of the corruption, to a newspaper called The Village Voice. It was published in a series entitled The NYPD Tapes.

Would they be forcibly abducted and brought back to the facility? Would it show up on a background check? Would they have to pay a fine? Would they be arrested?

AskReddit,fdilpes,t1_fdielja,1578445702.0,"If you want a more recent example from the United States, the case of [Adrian Schoolcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Schoolcraft) is a prime example. He was an NYPD officer assigned to the 81st precinct. He witnessed corruption within the precinct and secretly recorded proof. He brought this proof to internal affairs, and he was assured that it would be kept confidential. However, internal affairs told his captain that he reported him. So later that night, when he was in his apartment after his shift, the police came to his apartment and started pounding on the door demanding to be let in. So he took two tape recorders, set them to record, and hid them in his apartment. After a few more minutes, the police were able to get a key to his apartment by telling the landlord that he was suicidal. This was a blatant lie, but it was the first of many. After entering his apartment, they handcuffed him, forced him into an ambulance, and took him to the psych ward of Jamaica Hospital in Queens, NY. They told the doctors that he was delusional, so when he started telling them about the conspiracy, the doctors viewed this as a delusion. He was held there for six days, and he was only released because his father called every hospital in New York City until he found the one where Schoolcraft was being held. After he was released, he went back to his apartment and found that one of the tape recorders had been destroyed by the NYPD. However, they were not able to find the other tape recorder, so that remained in tact. He immediately gave that tape, as well as the original tape of the corruption, to a newspaper called The Village Voice. It was published in a series entitled The NYPD Tapes. Psychiatric conspiracies exist, and will persist as long as good men do nothing."

Are you suggesting that everyone should be required to see a doctor once per year? Also, what would happen if a person walked out the moment the mental health exam started? Would they be forcibly abducted and brought back to the facility? Would it show up on a background check? Would they have to pay a fine? Would they be arrested? The logical conclusion of something being made mandatory is that it would have to be enforced. Sure, most people would be fine with a mental health exam, but what about those who refuse?"
