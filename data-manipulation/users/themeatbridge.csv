A woman who says ""Big is Beautiful"" is saying she's happy with her body and her looks. She is saying she deserves to be loved, and she won't be made to feel ugly by a society that doesn't like fatties. Positive body image is about making people feel comfortable with themselves. It's not people telling other people who they should want to fuck.

I'm not suggesting that none of these people are hypocrites in some other way. Using gendered euphemisms for fat people is hypocritical. Criticizing men for being overweight while being overweight is hypocritical. But saying you aren't turned on by someone or something isn't necessarily criticism. Nobody used the term ""gross"".
