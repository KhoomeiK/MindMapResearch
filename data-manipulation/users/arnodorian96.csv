Although a 14 year old could live on his own and start a new life, it highly depends on the kid personality. Was he extroverted? Street wise? 

And then even if he did had those personality traits, how bad was his school or his house life? Asides from the learning issues it doesn't seem he was having much problems either at school or at his family.  How much of a troubled kid he was? Troubled kid is a way too general term that could mean either being violent or just someone with bad grades.
So does raises the question, why did he dissapeared to live a new life?

I have two theories. Either he was hit while being on his skateboard or he did committed suicide for reasons that likely will remain unknown. The only thing clear for me is that he is likely dead."

In terms of Eastern Europe, I think that a restored monarchy is more possible. Even before the Cold War, these countries had better appreciation towards their monarchy than western democracies. If you can make monarchist groups have a major role in opposition against Communism you'll likely could get a monsrchy restoration across Eastern Europe.  In Russia, for example I think if one of the remaining Romanovs plays a major role against the soviet union then it's likely the Romanovs are reinstalled after the fall of the soviet union. With the support of the Orthodox Church Ill say that the new Romanovs become quite popular. After all, even today Nicholas and his family are beloved saints for the russians.

In case of Western Europe I would find it unlikely or very difficult to have a restored monarchy. In Germany and Austria, the kaiser and the emperor where the symbols of the authoritarian rule and only far right movements could support their return.  In Italy it happens the same as it's the remainder of the fascist era supported by the king.  I only can see a restoration if there's a change of image to a liberal or moderate monarch who will reign as the scandinavian  monarchies."

Anyway, if by 1918 the Romanovs are rescued they  likely are taken to a safer location where Nicholas probably stays as a symbol or possibly the head for the White armies. His family likely ends up going in the HMS  Marlborough along with the others members of the royal family. 

If the whites can turn the rescue of Nicholas and his family as a religious miracle that proves their cause is sacred that might help them win more followers at least in the rural fields.  Im not sure they can win though.

Exhausted and probably divided on the outcome of the form of government the Whites are eventually defeated. Likely Nicholas is executed as it was the symbol of the old zarist regime.

Even when I went to the psychologyst and he told us we should accept our mistakes, he said that I should forget about it.

Do you have any cousins perhaps? That could help you meet new friends or gain confidence. 

I relate to your story until the middle of it. I too never felt quite relatable to most kids around my age but that didn't had to do only with being an only child. (My mom and dad were having economical problems so I was sent to live with my grandparents from age 4 to age 8)  They did the best but as they were very old they made me focus on studies and solely on that rather than friends. 

In my case, when I did began having friends it was like being unexperienced for something everyone understood.  I didn't knew how to act with friends so sometimes I acted as a jerk and loose some friends.  I eventually asked my mom to take me to a psychologyst and there I discussed about the issues I had and what made me feel different, it helped me a lot and also my parents, or at least my mom. But through that I eventually obtained some good friends from high school and two from college that are still with me.  

I think what you need to tackle first is your mom overprotective attitude with your friends.  Perhaps a psychologyst can help you better but she needs to understands that whatever those friends are, she must respect you even if she thinks they are not better for you.  I had some of those friends and eventually my mom was right but she understood that even if I did commit mistakes by befriending those people, she would still be there accepting my decisions.

Try entering courses or classes outside high school (piano, karate, painting) and see if there are kids around your age. Believe me, it's one of the easiest way to make friend and that's coming from someone who was afraid of take the bus on it's own."

On an unrelated note, it's always good to hear mysteries from other countries that sadly never get the attention as the american dissapearances here.  One can only wonders how many mysteries from other countries might be related to one in other part of the world."

UnresolvedMysteries,fcys4rd,t1_fcw9esl,1578085905.0,There might some type of personalities that are more able to survive on their own at that age but Gosden personality doesn't match someone able to live on his own for nearly 10 years.
OnlyChild,fcyqizj,t3_ej5flk,1578085019.0,"Fortunately, I'm not a very social person and hate romance.  But in all seriousness, if another girl comes to your life you should be able to talk about this and if it's true love then she will help you get a possible solution. One that might work is moving to a nearby city where you can live with your wife and also be able to check your mom on weekends.  The second option could be convincing your mom that if you don't have any family left then maybe you can get her an apartment or home close to you and help her get new friends. 

Personally, living my mom on her own as many people do would be a feeling I couldn't erase of my mind. But as I said, don't worry there's plenty of solutions you could try."

UnresolvedMysteries,fcv1tix,t3_ej0d8v,1577992881.0,"The case of the spanish boy painter: Last year an anonymous call the family and told them to investigate a certain person that it was confirmed worked at the art school where the boy studied. If the claim is true then the family will finally get answers this year.
Andrew Gosden: I doubt it will be solved ever but I really hope that some type of miracle will happen and Andrew is found or very likely his remains."
WithoutATrace,fcv1f5v,t3_ej0s1f,1577992656.0,"One of the cases I've been following closely for years. Ill try to dismiss some theories and then say what I think happened.

-Andrew is living another life: Sorry, but not even the most extrovert and independent kid could succesfully start a new life out of nowwhere. Andrew according to his family was more of a sheltered boy and barely had friends so I find very unlikely he could have survived a week on his own let alone years. And even if he did it why not come forward now? The theory that Andrew was gay and run from his home out of fear was considered by his parents and issued a message calling for Andrew to come home and that they accepted him. So if he did run away and was due to his sexuality that would have been a moment to return.
-Andrew kill himself: Let's face it, teenagehood years are difficult and you might get really lonely. Andrew had no friends and couple of days before he stopped getting into the school bus. The problem with this theory is that Andrew took his psp and some money with him. I find it unlikely that if he wanted to end his life he would have carried his psp or even taken a train.
-Andrew was lured by someone online: Despite their parents claim that Andrew didn't liked the internet, I think that feeling lonely he entered forums to meet people and he befriended someone with whom he agreed to see in person the day he dissapeared. The person likely killed him and threw the body into the Thames which would explain why a body hasn't appeared yet."

todayilearned,fcpbvfj,t1_fcpbpys,1577857576.0,No. But your opinions are too extreme and as this is the internet is fair to think that.

Its the basic part of any welfare state and the U.S has been like that since the Roosevelt era. A true socialism would mean further state intervention.

OnlyChild,fcopckv,t3_ei1mak,1577838018.0,"We share the same things to worry about but you have one thing that might be helpful to you in the future: your extended family. If you had close relationships with your cousins, then hopefully one of them is going to be really helpful in case something were to happen to your parents.

In my case, it's kind of a complicated situation. My parents are divorced and so does is my grandma. After the divorce, I lost contact with my cousins of my father's side and the only cousin I have from my mother's side lives in Spain and we barely know each other.  I already had three emergency calls with my mom and believe me being in a hospital all on your own late at night is one of the worst experiences and something that makes you very terrified. 

We haven't talked about it with my mom, but how we are going to deal with my grandma (she lives on her own in another city in a big house with some rooms she rent to other people) getting old will decide how I will deal with my mom getting older. It is scary and sometimes I wake up late at night thinking what will I do if I don't have any more family left. But hopefully as time comes, friends and possibly even my cousin who lives in Spain will help me with whatever is happening with me and my mom or grandma."
