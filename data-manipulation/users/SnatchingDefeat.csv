Also, as to the argument regarding rake, in no limit games the rake is always capped, usually at $4 or $5, so in addition to giving up equity from not playing the hand as well as you can, you're also paying a higher percentage of rake in all pots that would have exceeded the rake cap but for the soft play.

I would agree that not everyone who soft plays does so with malicious intent, but that does not make the practice defensible."
