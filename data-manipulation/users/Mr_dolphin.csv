This way, they get to say all the evidence is corrupted or missing, and make it a debate over *how* he died. 

If he “dies” in his home, few people would actually believe he’s actually dead, as he could have control over the entire environment. If he “dies” in a place where we “know for certain” he is in, people take for granted that he is definitely dead. 

If he was expendable, why didn’t powerful and capable elites eliminate him while he had blackmail over them? Why would they allow him to walk around and risk going to prison? His arrest was intentional to make us think he wasn’t in control. He was. 

He got this far because he wasn’t allowed to be killed. No one would accept the role of being the figurehead of a pedophile ring if they knew they could be assassinated for the knowledge they’d obtain. Special provisions are put in place to keep them alive. Epstein is likely retired, having earned his pension from the true PTB (Mossad).

Bruce Jenner was probably cross dressing while he was an olympian. I’m sure it was relatively common but people just didn’t say anything. The phenomena themselves are not manufactured. 

For the record, I believe that transgenderism is a mental disorder that needs to be treated. I believe sexual orientation is a disorder as well, but not one that requires or suffices treatment. 

Sexual orientation is a personal preference. Transgenderism is a denial of biology brought on by imbalanced brain chemistry. Pansexuals are fine, they can just be attracted to everyone regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Gender fluids are sick and need help, their brains are in disarray. 

More to my point, I’m willing to bet that homosexuals, transgenders, etc. have been around for all of human history, regardless of their popularity.

Around 2:40. Bernie says he has laid out the most progressive platform of any candidate, then corrects himself to “serious candidate,” immediately after a conversation explicitly about Yang and his ideas."
YangForPresidentHQ,fd2jy3m,t1_fcytk5j,1578148306.0,"*polls in Iowa, and yes, because Pete is not a fundamental threat to the power and corruption of the DNC."
YangForPresidentHQ,fd2ja7i,t1_fcypk53,1578148034.0,"For all of his talk about standing up to the establishment, Bernie has taken his spankings from the DNC lying down. He got fucked out of the 2016 nom and endorsed Clinton, valuing a unified coalition against Trump over the DNC getting rightfully criticized. 

Now, he belittles Yang’s campaign as “not serious” when that’s exactly what pundits were saying about Bernie’s campaign in 2016!!! And now that the DNC is again screwing over lower-tier candidates, he is silent. The irony is lost on him. 

He should be outraged, but he just wants to win so he is not going to bite the hand that feeds him."
YangForPresidentHQ,fd2igza,t1_fd0irz9,1578147719.0,Yang stuck up for Cory when he didn’t make the debate. They are truly good friends who believe each others’ ideas should be heard regardless of polling.
conspiracy,fcznn5n,t1_fcxrm70,1578105181.0,"An impeachment is just a statement of charges. Charges against Trump have been brought before the House, and they voted to approve them. Thus, Trump has been impeached. 

You’re trying to be enlightened with your semantics, but Trump has been impeached, that’s a simple fact."
conspiracy,fcxq2qk,t1_fcxphi3,1578068778.0,"Donald Trump was not President on 11/5 because we voted and agreed that he would take office on 1/20.

Donald Trump *is* impeached because the House voted and agreed to impeach him, with his trial to be set at a later date."
conspiracy,fcxbf9n,t1_fckscmb,1578058232.0,"Like, regardless of whether you believe the government planned 9/11, their reaction to it in hindsight is the most blatant red flag ever. They pounced on the opportunity to set up shop in the ME permanently, it was always about so much more than getting those responsible for 9/11. They were itching to start a war and it showed by how well prepared they were and how bipartisan it was. 

Then it shifts to “yeah it definitely benefited the military defense contractors that own the government, but there’s no way that a defense contractor like...*checks notes*...Boeing...could use...*checks notes*...airplanes and explosives...hmm, I guess they could do that. 

Then it shifts to “so it gave them the biggest profit of all time, and they had all the equipment and influence to pull it off, but there’s no way they actually would, right? The government would have considered that, right?”

House of cards falls from there."
