AskReddit,ff2ivua,t1_ff2gids,1579508121.0,Yup. It is the driving reasoning behind their current genocides of unskilled aging workers.
AskReddit,ff2itii,t3_er9gj0,1579508037.0,"This is totally true. Most people aren't that intelligent, so their only work value is unskilled labor. But unskilled labor relies on the speed and muscle of youth. So there is this massive demand for work slow enough for the elderly, and that makes the per hour value of that work go down. And then the elderly complain that McDonald's doesn't pay enough, and it wasn't like this when there were factory/mining jobs. There still are factory and mining jobs, people just have to be strong and youthful to get them the same way it has always been. Automation helps fill in the demand for strength and vitality, but you can't fix old and stupid. A social society like the US tries to help but often the rich refuse to help, leaving the burden on the middle class, which then collapses under the weight. A darwinist society like Russia lets them starve to death, but that results in high crime rate and political destabilization. And for the first time in history this will be happening in just about every country around the world."
