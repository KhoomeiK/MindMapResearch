I’m not convinced this story is true, but if it is the roommate presumably told the shelter LAOP neglected and abandoned this dog, and didn’t even bother to get her spayed. So they feel good about “rescuing” the dog from a bad owner, preventing backyard breeding or a whoops litter, and it will bring in a lot of cash. All powerful motivators."

A lot more people want desirable breeds for a pet than want to backyard breed dogs for sale, so an altered purebred is still valuable. A reputable breeder will charge $1,500- $2000+, so a shelter can charge $500 and have a waiting list for a golden retriever puppy. There’s a lot of for-profit retail rescue for desirable dogs, which frankly is probably how LAOP also got the dog. Reputable shelters can’t just “source” a purebred golden retriever puppy."
TrollXChromosomes,ffdee45,t1_ffd7b6i,1579819121.0,"There’s a long of history of marriage across a lot of cultures so there are no absolutes, but for most of Western European legal history marriage was a very shitty deal for women. It stripped them of legal personhood and human rights, and many were left destitute as a result. There was no recourse if your husband was abusive, gambled away all the money, or in most cases, if he just up and disappeared. If he was a rich landowner and wasn’t just going to hop on the next whaling ship and disappear, he could prevent you from leaving, or refuse to let you ever see your kids because they’re his property.

We weren’t wandering around in nuclear families, completely reliant on genetic fathers sticking around and feeding their own kids. Even today there are tribes that have no concept of specific paternity, or believe a child can have multiple fathers. Marriage comes out of private property and social hierarchy, and in almost every society it was men who were gaining property and status and wanted to protect it. I’m married and see the value of it now as a legal contract, but marriage originated to protect what men saw as their own interests."

Clobetasone (eumovate) isn’t sold here; the stronger steroid clobetasol is available by prescription. Fucidic acid is apparently not approved for use in the US. Dermol isn’t marketed here and I don’t know of any product that’s a combination of non-soap cleanser and antiseptic wash. Cetaphil is great as a non-soap cleanser but doesn’t contain antimicrobials. One of those ingredients in Dermol (chlorhexidine hydrochloride) is available as a liquid antiseptic hand wash. Cetraben also isn’t marketed here.

Typhoid, dysentery, plague, tuberculosis, flu, and other communicable diseases were very common causes of death in adulthood, and infection, childbirth, accident, and other diseases like cancer and diabetes killed many more.

“If nothing killed you before you turned 80, you’d probably make it to 80.” Very few people lived that long before modern medicine. Accident/injury, infection, disease, childbirth, and combat killed a lot of adults. Medieval kings of England, who outlived their fathers to be crowned (thus excluding most childhood deaths), had ample food, did not live in crowded conditions that increased the spread of disease, did not perform physical labor, and did not give birth, did not live to 80.

Cash bail is essentially not even used in the federal system, and the federal justice system is working just fine and indigent defendants show up for trial. How would you feel if you’d been accused of something you didn’t do and ended up incarcerated for months (and likely lost your job and your housing) because you were poor and didn’t have $2,000 cash?

I donâ€™t think it makes any sense to *not* shelve black romance in general romance. Romance readers usually read a spectrum of subgenres, while non-romance readers typically donâ€™t read any romances at all. Black romance authors like Beverly Jenkins or Alyssa Cole are popular with both black and white romance readers, but most people looking for literary black fiction arenâ€™t going to pick up their books, and most people specifically looking for black romances are also going to be buying other romance novels. Romance is the very obvious and logical place to shelve romance novels because itâ€™s where romance readers look for romance novels."

There are people who have opted into being vocal about their disability and the very important distinction is they have opted in and bring it up. The vast majority of people *do not* want constant unsolicited comments from strangers. The world would not be a better place if were socially acceptable to ask people about their bodies or medical conditions, or anything else that many people consider their personal business.

The purpose of cash bail is not public safety, itâ€™s to ensure the defendant shows up for trial.

Cash bail is essentially not even used in the federal system, and the federal justice system is working just fine and indigent defendants show up for trial. How would you feel if youâ€™d been accused of something you didnâ€™t do and ended up incarcerated for months (and likely lost your job and your housing) because you were poor and didnâ€™t have $2,000 cash? Maybe you get acquitted or the charges are dropped, but your life is devastated. Itâ€™s a gross economic injustice.
