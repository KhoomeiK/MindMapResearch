>There’s a common hard-on against having extravagant weddings on Reddit and I couldn’t disagree more. We always say that experiences are more important than material things, so why shouldn’t I want what will hopefully be one of your best memories of your life as nice as possible?

The problem here is that you're making it sound like you believe that extravagant and nice HAVE to go together. Which is fine, you do you. I think people should aim to have the wedding they want as long as they're not stupid or crazy about it. But as a guest or member of the wedding party, I've found smaller, intimate weddings far more enjoyable and memorable.

To me, ""as nice as possible"" means minimal stress, planning, or spending to put the day together. That means keeping it to the people I most care about, in a quiet, uncrowded location, and an atmosphere where I can relax and not worry about the comfort of hundreds of guests nor about being in the spotlight and standing up to a lot of scrutiny."
