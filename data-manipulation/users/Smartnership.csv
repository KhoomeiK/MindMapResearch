Realestatefinance,ffe3g3l,t3_et1sec,1579835694.0,"The lender for the first mortgage will verify the source of funds for the down payment.

Borrowing the down payment changes the risk profile of the loan and is disallowed for most common mortgage programs; there are some investor-focused programs that allow this, but the risk profile will create an interest rate penalty -- many such loans are restricted to investors rather than owner-occupants.

Further, if you intend to be in an equity position (rather than as the lender of the down payment) many lenders will insist that you be a party to the loan itself ... again, only possible under boutique or custom lending offerings."

I think to be fair, you mean certain branches and subgroups.

Taking the faith of hundreds of millions and broadbrushing it this way is a disservice.

There's plenty to be critical of, to be sure, but saying Mr Rogers (for example) was a cult member and employed outdated moral absolutes and was not deserving of trust because of his faith seems less than useful."

GetMotivated,ff7hg6g,t1_ff5hz7j,1579649636.0,"If you've been diagnosed with *clinical depression*, then you need more to ""fight"" it than what you may be able to do on your own --  You need professionals to help with that.

On the other hand, if you are describing a situation where you struggle with *profound discouragement* -- then that is another matter altogether.

If that is the case, then I would suggest you start very small.  Find any minor achievable goal, even if it is just cleaning up one room of your place.  Small start, build on that, and repeat.   Form a habit of positive steps, even small ones.   Accomplishment is habit-forming.  But ignore the negative voice(s).  They are wrong."
GetMotivated,ff7gzs8,t3_ergo3e,1579649334.0,"For u/ohmnom15:


You will hear the negative voice when you are beginning any positive change, whether you want to change your body, your mind, or your economy:

“Why bother?  Don’t even start.  You’ll probably fail.  It won’t matter.  Trying will make you look stupid.  When you quit, and you will, you’ll feel like a bigger failure.  Stay. “

It is the inner small voice of irrational fear:  fear of change, fear of hard work, fear of a new way...  It sounds much like the voice of a frightened, shameful child.

It wants the comfort of the old, familiar pain over the unfamiliar new:  it begs you to stay in place.  

It is the inner voice of counterpoint, the contrarian, the advocate of stasis ... Once you begin a new road towards improvement,  it will cry “quit” and offer the ease of the old stagnation.    

It collects excuses and will repeat them to discourage the unfamiliar change it fears:  ""You can't succeed, you don't have the connections, the wealthy background, the right genes, the right luck, the right family to succeed. Don't even try.""    Press on anyway.

Sometimes that voice compensates with loudness to cover its fear, but volume is not the same as truth.  Fear is noisy, counter it with calm reserve. Press on.  

It noisily beckons you to turn around on the road that will lead to back to the beginning -- the old, comfortable, familiar pain of stagnant decay.   It’s expected background noise.  Press on.  

The way to an improved life will be punctuated with this negative, fearful voice, but know this:  
it calls out from back there, back at the point of origin — the farther you go forward into the unknown, the more you grow beyond the old,  beyond that childlike voice — it becomes fainter,  then it whispers, and then it fades once going back is unthinkable.    

Your push forward will ultimately put you out if its audible reach; only then is it defeated.    Once you go far enough, you will disprove its fears and negate its shame and silence its noise.  

Last, sometimes the excuse-making, fearful, negative voice comes from others, from outside: 
They repeat what their own inner scared child tells them, to discourage you -- because your metamorphosis discredits their fears and makes their excuses look inadequate.  

Your change makes them uncomfortable. They are the voices of the crabs in the bottom of the comfortable, familiar, unchanging bucket.  

Press on."
