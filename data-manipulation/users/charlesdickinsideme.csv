college,fff8keg,t1_ffduql4,1579878397.0,"I'll look into that, thanks!"
college,fff8ihe,t1_ffe3eo5,1579878360.0,Fuck. I'll have to talk to my sleep doctor about that. Appreciate the insight
college,fff8e3z,t1_ffdumzm,1579878276.0,"Yea, I have sleep apnea and a CPAP but it hasn't done much to help tbh"
college,fff8b0f,t1_ffduj3z,1579878215.0,Yea that's where it goes. It's kinda weird how I can sleep through it
college,ffdu5rh,t1_ffcerbj,1579829004.0,Uhh it can be very hard for some. I don’t hear my alarms no matter what. I have a vibrating alarm clock and it still doesn’t work
college,ffdtrmw,t1_ffccz0b,1579828724.0,"Just curious. I’m an extremely deep sleeper and can sleep through just about anything. Will this be a problem for me in college? Currently I have a vibrating alarm clock (wakes my parents up in another room) but not me so they typically wake me up, even if I get 10+ hours of sleep. Do you think this will be a problem next year for me in college?"
college,ffdtmeg,t1_ffc997c,1579828622.0,"Or they could get a vibrating alarm clock. It’s what I use, doesn’t always get me up but it’ll work for just about anyone. I sleep through just about anything though"
ApplyingToCollege,ff8wuqd,t1_ff7toxi,1579698711.0,Yea but it’s obviously fake
JIDSV,ff8wnuo,t1_ff86mos,1579698541.0,"Damn, how much did blonde drop for? I thought it was one of those things only people with bots were able to snag since it was a pretty small drop. Hopefully it goes up for you guys like you who already have one, I’m not really into collecting vinyl"
JIDSV,ff8674u,t1_ff8409g,1579667111.0,I bet it’ll probably go up from there

PublicFreakout,ff4nqss,t1_ff4njrk,1579568079.0,Ah interesting. Thanks for clearing it up
PublicFreakout,ff4no64,t1_ff3serl,1579568028.0,Yea by signing up for a sport you’re contracted to knowing the risks of the sport
PublicFreakout,ff4nku8,t1_ff3va7z,1579567964.0,"People on Reddit immediately think they’re experts on every topic and it’s honestly infuriating. No, just cause you watched what appeared to be a dirty hit doesn’t immediately make you an expert. There’s a reason the kid didn’t flip out after that-he probably realized he contributed to that suplex by wrapping his arm around his opponents neck"
PublicFreakout,ff4ndyb,t1_ff37zz6,1579567829.0,Yea but I thought you’re not supposed to wrap your arm around someone’s neck like that guy did?
WinStupidPrizes,ff4mn54,t1_ff3gl1y,1579567303.0,"Well yea if you’re on watch people die you’re gonna see everything. People survive jumping 4 stories 50% of the time yet people can also die if they eat a raw piece of chicken and have a bad reaction. Point is, dying and quality of life in general, can be a bit of bad luck (I.e there’s no known causes of Alzheimer’s other than genetics) so imo you shouldn’t be worried about certain things such as an escalator"
Kanye,ff3suc7,t1_fej63cm,1579548105.0,I have the same regrets but with not being a fan until after the summer 18 albums. I doubt I’ll ever get to see a Kanye tour
Kanye,ff3qt2n,t1_ff1q2jg,1579546856.0,He could just be new dawg. I was subbed here while I was just getting into Kanye. I know I was subbed to r/himym while I was only in like the fourth of 9 seasons so I didn’t get every joke
Kanye,ff3q6l2,t1_feuuqm9,1579546475.0,God damn. I’m at the car dealers waiting for my cars oil change and I fucking died watching that streamable
Madden,ff3mt7q,t1_ff3mbwc,1579544406.0,"Eh it was a bit behind the receiver but still you do have a point. The blocker shouldn’t have been that far behind the gunner. It’s not like the guy ran a slant, he’s doing something pretty similar to normal punt coverage until he breaks at the end of the route"
nba,ff3ml0z,t1_ff3jajq,1579544266.0,I thought there was a torn labrum too. Glad to hear there may not have been that and brain/spine injuries as well
nba,ff3mgo8,t1_ff3lza5,1579544190.0,"From the couple of times I’ve been to Europe (spain, mostly cities) drinking in general is pretty  normal. However, people don’t drive. Everything is within walking distance so people don’t drive. There’s a reason the states have a higher drinking age and younger license age. People drive more in the states because everything’s spread out, whereas the couple of cities I’ve been in in spain are all close. 

I went on an exchange trip and me and my host walked probably a mile or two a day to school and back and to his friends etc. In spain (and most of Europe in general) the drinking age is 18, as is the age to get your license, but drinking as a minor is a lot less frowned upon as in the states

Sorry for rambling on"

AmITheAngel,ff230pt,t1_ff1j8zb,1579492426.0,"Yea i feel like it’s just the OP not being able to take a joke. That’s life, people make jokes and sometimes it makes you fee shitty, so what should you do? Make the same jokes back to them. It’s probably not even meant to hurt you, they probably like you/think you can take it. Make a joke back, don’t go overboard and laugh.

Kids call me “Jake” cause I supposedly look like a kid by that name. I think I look nothing like him but I take it and make jokes back. I used to hate jokes like that but I’ve realized it’s not meant to be mean, it’s just a joke"

Kanye,feyzm7l,t1_feylcxw,1579452440.0,Should’ve smashed his car so that way you’d have to exchange insurance info and you’d even get a pic of his license if you play it right! Then you ask for a photo with him
college,few12ps,t1_feuxcxm,1579403970.0,I hate to say it but you said you don’t remember anything about the exam? Also you probably just gave up frustrated and erased your answer

hiphopheads,fenthpa,t1_fem8epa,1579290595.0,That’s dope. I remember i heard bitch don’t kill my vibe in probably 2016 and hated it. Didn’t listen to Kendrick again till early 2018 and loved that album. GKMC gotta be one of my favorite albums of all time.
hiphopheads,fens9o4,t1_fen2u9p,1579290049.0,"I for sure will. I’ve heard good thing about them. They’re more frat rap, right? That’s what initially got me into Mac"
hiphopheads,fens0lu,t1_fem2lv1,1579289957.0,Not the same thing imo
hiphopheads,fens03s,t1_femn4o5,1579289948.0,"Yea I commented elsewhere, but I’ve tried to preserve an album or two whenever I’m going through someone’s discog. For Kanye it was late registration and 808s, mac was wmwtso and faces. I try to do it so I don’t just jump from album to album and miss songs I would like or forget to save them. 

Thanks for the recommendation!"
hiphopheads,fenrt1b,t1_femapqc,1579289842.0,I will. I’ve listened to objects in the mirro and the star room but I’ll listen to the rest soon!
hiphopheads,fenrq4g,t1_fem6pjq,1579289794.0,"Yea I remember seeing a post about that. Kinda crazy that three people who were pretty popular all dropping on the same day. I know swimming also dropped the same day as astroworld, pretty crazy but also unlucky for Mac in a way as I’m sure he’d want his debut album to be dropped with Kanye and j cole 

I’ll be sure to listen to wmwtso soon!"

MacMiller,fem4u0k,t1_fem4hts,1579239798.0,That’s a good idea. And damn man idk if I’m crazy or what but this album gave me a melancholy feeling (I think I used that word right). It made me feel so happy and lucky to have Mac but so said to have lost him. glad to hear it’s treating you well bro!
MacMiller,fem4qmt,t1_fem4kzd,1579239707.0,Similar to the good news video? Either way still sounds pretty cool. I wish there was a music video like the beginning of best day ever. One of my favorite all time music videos

I’ve been trying to save atleast an album from each new artist I discover so that way I go through each album slower and can really find the songs that grow on me. First did it with Kanye and now I’m doing it with Mac Miller and jay z. Appreciate the comment, if I remember I’ll report back in a week or two when I’ve listened to it!"

hiphopheads,fem2njw,t1_fem2int,1579237743.0,That’s very true. I’m still newish to Mac so I still have most of his mixtapes and WMWTSO but I imagine for a longtime fan this album hits especially hard

hiphopheads,fem2bno,t1_fem2638,1579237440.0,Yea i feel that. If you’ve been through Macs whole catalogue then you may never hear another finished Mac song :(
