Really changing my perspective, since I always just saw it as a coping mechanism to being bored.

I think it's helped me in some ways. For example, I was always an introvert and bad at social interaction, and it kinda helped me do some introspection. It helped me prepare for interviews and feel more comfortable talking to people. But I think it's served its usefulness, and at this point is just wasting my time when I could be genuinely working on myself.
