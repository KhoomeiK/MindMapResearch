cats,ff0qgtn,t1_ff0ly9w,1579471370.0,"Poor kitty!  I had a minor issue with this with my older boy getting what looked like little blackheads on his chin.  I tossed his plastic bowl and started feeding from stainless for dry food and glass for wet and it cleared up.  I found this article that may be helpful for you.  If the expensive food is working, I’d make a note of the ingredients and then compare them to other foods available to try to find a less expensive version. Sorry I can’t be more help!  https://www.catster.com/cat-health-care/what-causes-scabs-on-cats"

cats,fezvfp7,t3_er011g,1579462171.0,Ooh!  Natural fluff but super cute either way!  We shave our fluffy grey girl because she has tummy issues and her pancake poops stick to her fur!  She’s beautiful in her natural fluffy state but freaking adorable when shaven and not covered in poop!
unpopularopinion,fengeez,t1_feng497,1579284122.0,"My view is that we can’t congratulate ourselves for having a sub-par inclusive system when people are dying while waiting for diagnostic tests.  When we have people dying while sitting in ERs. The key word you’re using is effective.  It is clearly not effective. Fourteen months wait time, in some places for an ECG and that’s just one example."
unpopularopinion,fenbhpo,t1_fenalls,1579281126.0,"Tax me at the same rate, for the same income, as the US taxes income. I’ll take the extra money to buy good health insurance and the US’s medical services any day.  I’d rather that then being taxed up the wazoo for substandard medical care (again, if you’re brought to an ER via ambulance that’s the ONLY situation where our system shines).  I’ve been treated for minor injuries in both the US and Canada and US medical services are far superior to ours. I’ve had diagnostic testing in the US when the wait time here has been atrocious and I’ve been apologized to by the US labs for having to wait three days.  Huh, I wonder why it is we don’t want to be taxed more."
nottheonion,fenarke,t1_femxcyl,1579280674.0,"I read the same article about the baby. What struck me was that a six week old baby can’t “get into” anything since they are completely helpless. That POS fed that baby meth (I’m not even going to touch on the other injuries he inflicted on that child).  There’s no other way that baby could have ingested it. Language barrier or not, and considering he’s a flight risk, he should not have been released, period."

unpopularopinion,fen3xk2,t1_felwv58,1579276426.0,"You said you disagreed and that healthcare in Canada is awesome.  Awesome in emergency situations when you’re brought in by ambulance?  Yep, that I’ll give.  Overall, however, with ridiculous wait times for diagnostic tests across the country and sometimes just as ridiculous wait times for elective surgeries for people who are in chronic, debilitating pain, then no, it is not awesome."
unpopularopinion,felsdss,t1_fels3an,1579229757.0,An echocardiogram is a diagnostic tool for HEART problems.  You think it’s awesome that people have to wait for over a year to have a heart condition diagnosed?  Talk to the people who can’t walk and are in constant pain while they wait for endless months to have a joint replaced where elective surgery is concerned.
unpopularopinion,felqc61,t1_felq2ss,1579228360.0,"Right, I didn’t say it was more expensive than US, but it wasn’t “free” UNLESS I wanted to wait over a year for a “free” one. which is why I’d rather have less taxation for a shoddy system and pay for my own insurance.  

Most communities throughout Canada don’t even have private clinics where they can buy their diagnostic tests."
unpopularopinion,felinr2,t1_fekz1y6,1579223090.0,And the healthcare isn’t that stellar here in Canada.
unpopularopinion,feligvo,t1_felgah3,1579222957.0,"Imma give you an example of free health care here in Canada.  Both the good and the bad.

I had an emergency gall bladder operation this spring.  Was taken to hospital by ambulance.  Yes, I had to pay for the ambulance.  
The surgery was done two days after my arrival when they could fit it in.  No, I did not have a hospital bill. That’s the good.

Here comes the bad.  While in hospital, post surgery, a nurse was checking my blood pressure in my left arm, since my right had IV hooked up and the right side of my bed was up against a wall.  She kept getting wonky readings and when she finally got a reading from my right arm it was fine.  That indicated possible blockage on the left side.  Once discharged I had to see my family doctor for a referral to a cardiologist.  That took six weeks in total from referral to appointment.  That cardiologist ordered an echocardiogram.  Guess what the wait time is for an echocardiogram?  FOURTEEN months.  THAT is the pitfall of “Free” healthcare, which isn’t free at all because we are taxed very highly for our health care.  

We have one private clinic in town that does paid echocardiograms.  So I paid for it.  Since then I’ve had an ultrasound, have been put on a statin and am still waiting to hear from the thoracic surgeon I was referred to three months ago.  

I could afford the $700 for the echocardiogram.  Many people can’t.  Some of the people waitlisted may well die before being properly diagnosed.  We shouldn’t be patting ourselves on the back when we have wait times of over a year for a diagnostic procedure."
