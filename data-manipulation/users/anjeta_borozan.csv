LushCosmetics,ffhrits,t1_ffha31d,1579950120.0,Me too but all the other ones I want are sweet so it's nice to have a bit of floral as an option.
bulletjournal,ffgr0dr,t3_esyuis,1579912851.0,I'm currently playing it and I love it so far.
LushCosmetics,ffgp7ol,t1_ffgon1j,1579911568.0,Guess I just need to bite the bullet. First I need to get through all my shampoos. Do you find the need to use a conditioner after you use this bar?
LushCosmetics,ffgoslm,t3_etij47,1579911272.0,"I was already planning on buying HIWTK and I had no intention of liking Big but then I sprayed it on and it smelled so fresh, it was wonderful. I'm not a big fan of floral either. I also tried on Avocado co wash and I absolutely hated the smell. It smells so sour and it was very overpowering that I got a headache. I only got Nana shower gel because I love bakery scents and the other two weren't special to me. I actually don't like pomegranate that much and snowflake is not my favourite scent. I'm most excited to pick up some bath bombs, Unicorn Horn and Tingle later on."
LushCosmetics,ffgo2nt,t3_etiuca,1579910763.0,I'm considering buying this but I don't want my scalp to get oily faster but on the other hand my scalp is dry and flaky. The alternative is buying a scalp treatment.
