politics,ffphatm,t1_ffpcssr,1580095024.0,"His supporters are already talking about trump 2020, “three term president”. The what’s next? Ivanka?"
politics,ffp7gwo,t1_ffo7wzx,1580088144.0,"They found the loophole in the system. The president appoints a sycophant as the AG and, voila! No accountability."
politics,ffp7cih,t1_ffomyo6,1580088057.0,Well put.
politics,ffp76a5,t1_ffnuf7i,1580087937.0,You guys are legit scaring me.
politics,ffp6t5a,t3_eubyn4,1580087681.0,Throw it on the pile. Trump’s strategy is working. When you commit crimes in plain sight every day people just can’t keep up.
WayOfTheBern,ffp6jt8,t1_ffo3d45,1580087497.0,Don’t forget the anti student loan forgiveness law.

politics,ffoa5sf,t1_ffn7ap6,1580075606.0,I’m in the same boat. It’s really sad.
podcasts,ffo9zdz,t3_eucmoc,1580075543.0,Any Joe Rogan Experience episode with either Alex Jones or Eddie Bravo on. Bonus points for the crossover episode.
politics,ffo9axs,t1_ffnpoy9,1580075330.0,Wow. That’s scary.
Moviesinthemaking,ffo7cxb,t3_eu7o20,1580074876.0,I heard he scratched his nose once too.

christinahendricks,ffng3n3,t1_ffn78yw,1580065458.0,"Hap and Leonard. Was on Netflix a while back, not sure if they still have it. I remember a particular part of the show where she is wearing a white button down shirt and falls in water. Was waiting for the next shot and was very disappointed, you can tell they went out of their way to not show her top. Sneaky bastards."
politics,ffkmajq,t3_etyaec,1580025105.0,Then stop committing crimes.

politics,ffjh5sf,t1_ffj8ay6,1579998135.0,The only plausible deniability he has is he’s so inept that he might not even realize that at the moment. He seems like he just walks around in a daze with no idea of what he’s doing.
politics,ffjgw31,t1_ffjdn5g,1579997983.0,Just couldn’t get herself to do it. To those corporate democrats Bernie is the enemy. They’d rather a corrupt republican than Bernie.
politics,ffjgctr,t1_ffjc5tt,1579997665.0,Yep. Throw you under the bus at the drop of a hat.
politics,ffjfv2o,t1_ffj2hlp,1579997372.0,Are we talking about the administration that starts wars from a restaurant table at Mar A Lago?

WayOfTheBern,ffi50tq,t1_ffhaavp,1579965257.0,Already woke up this morning to an “article” pushed by google search entitled something like “the 12 pictures Joe Rogan needs to apologize for”. The smear continues.
AskMen,ffhalja,t3_etcmuk,1579928011.0,"Weeds. Started out fun then got weird and then just plain stupid. 

Also Tru Blood. Vampires, sure. Werewolves, ok. Werepanthers? You’re pushing it. Fairies? I’m out."
WayOfTheBern,ffg88ut,t1_ffg2e23,1579900588.0,His interview with Bernie has close to 11M views. That’s massive.

WayOfTheBern,ffavurq,t3_esixuh,1579745682.0,"Man. I sure hope so. The way I see it, if it ever happens conservatives are going to kick and scream until they go to a doctor and it doesn’t cost them anything, they send their kid to college for free, etc. Things Europeans take for granted."
Moviesinthemaking,ffasn77,t3_eskexd,1579743559.0,The whole Cliff driving home section of the movie had me grinning like an idiot in the theatre. Hadn’t had that much fun watching a movie in a while.

podcasting,ffae8e8,t1_ffa9rgo,1579733551.0,Thanks for your honesty but I doubt he would’ve reached out to me with a fake story.
podcasting,ff52non,t3_ermjdg,1579578567.0,You can actually make a pop filter out of a wire coat hanger and a pair of stockings. Also search for free mastering software and master your show after you’re done editing it. It will greatly improve your sound.

NewOrleansBeer,ff213fn,t3_er6kej,1579490974.0,I agree. It’s a sleeper but so good.
Tarantino,fex1y9p,t3_eqpusb,1579422996.0,"Does anybody else want to see the full Lancer episode with the two brothers, or is it just me?"
podcasting,fetwwz5,t3_eqjlyf,1579380887.0,"There’s another very easy and possibly better sounding way: communicate over an online service (Skype, Discord, etc.) and you each record your track on your pc, then edit them together. You’ll have to do a 3,2,1, “clap” thing at the beginning to make it easier to align both tracks."
politics,fes8e9m,t3_eqg95h,1579362498.0,"Well, he’s not wrong."
videos,ferodzw,t3_eq79zy,1579356473.0,She’s a badass. I really like her drumming style.
movies,feo6ma5,t1_fenyn4h,1579295856.0,Yep. That’s what happens when you spew propaganda and cover up the president’s crimes every night on TV.
The_Mueller,feo2lp1,t1_fenb2d5,1579294222.0,Yep
NewOrleansBeer,felq900,t1_feln7bd,1579228300.0,Holly Roller is my ultimate daily go to. I tried the grapefruit at the brewery and was so disappointed I didn’t even finish it.
