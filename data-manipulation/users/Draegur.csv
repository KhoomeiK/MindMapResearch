The inclusion of what appears to be living organic plant material reminds me of my warforged druid, Equinox. 3N0X was his serial number, the tenth (X) logistics support asset (0) for the third infantry battalion (3N).

After the warforged corps were disbanded he became obsessed (as many warforged do) with coming to his own understanding of what life is and what it means to live. He started off cultivating a sapling to grow into him (I believe it was a pine) as an exploration of and tribute to nature, believing that becoming a resource to that which lives was his most reasonable way ""into"" the cycle of a biosphere... Desperate to find some way that his fundamentally unnatural existence can make its way back to nature again.

Although the tree integrating into his body enabled him to heal somewhat, it would inevitably disrupt his systems and render him no longer operational someday - but he reasoned that in order to live, one must die. Destruction is necessary for creation, and the shape he made on the world as he broke down would be his legacy. Hopefully a good one...

Man. I want to play him again.

It's like, yes they're already on fire and going to be a charred pile of vitrified carbon all on their own but throwing KEROSENE on them can **still** make shit worse and turn them into a danger to others.

Paltrow's success and fame lend dangerous faux legitimacy to lunacy that would otherwise be laughed away into obscurity. She and her pseudoscientific cargo cult are a liability to society as a whole. If only shutting her down wouldn't make her ignorant claptrap look like virtuous underdogs being ""bullied"" and ""suppressed"" by ""the man"". Ugh.

Honestly it might actually be safer in the long run to just give her so much proverbial rope that she ends up metaphorically hanging herself sooner rather than later. Perhaps if we can't stop the storm we can at least prepare the triage.

She wants to upcharge an insane amount, okay great there should be maybe some kind of ""unproven product penalty"" that goes into an insurance-like fund that can pay for the damage she'll do to people's lives and livelihoods. Maybe require people to sign a statement denouncing goop and excoriating their entire practice of business, document the nature of the harm and how it came to be, and attach themselves to a class action suit, in order to claim relief from the fund.

Surely then after a cacophony of injured voices are coordinated into a chorus of condemnation, the righteous indignation of the public at large can smash this blight once and for all - not some shadowy cabal of old men in a smoke filled back room, which would surely make the crooks look better (a mercy we cannot afford them)."

There's a lot of other fun things I'd like to ask but that is by far the most important to Humanity's future.

There is no wind on the moon, and it rotates on a 28 day period, leaving 14 consecutive days of darkness; you can't run a colony on that. But there's THORIUM. Lots of it.

The atmosphere is so thin on Mars that even its highest speed winds barely have the inertia to push anything with more mass than microfine dust. And speaking of the dust it can severely limit solar production which is already so weak and attenuated by distance from the sun that you need 4x as much exposure area on your solar panels as you do at Earth's orbit to generate the same amount of power. But there's a shit ton of Thorium on Mars too!

There isn't a lot of water on either, but there ARE the requisite minerals for Molten Salt.

Look, it can be nice sometimes to hope they'll go easy on you electing to show you mercy, and every police officer is a person under that badge. But if they're wearing that badge, they are representing an abusive system that has to destroy people in order to survive. Prisons don't make money unless they lock people up! It may be less convenient than ""letting you off with a warning"", but don't gamble with your freedom!

A police officer has the power to make shit up on the spot and STILL have it stick to you! If it's your word against theirs, the court will trust THEM over you! The side of the road is not the place to incriminate yourself by admitting anything that a police department might embellish!

KEEPING YOUR MOUTH SHUT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GIVE YOUR PUBLIC DEFENDER AN ADVANTAGE. 

Be polite, be courteous, be respectful, be sincere, and follow the fucking script:

Officer: ""Do you know why I pulled you over?""

You: ""Why did you pull me over, Officer?""

Officer: <starts asking more questions, where were you coming from, do you know how fast you were going>

You: ""I'm not discussing my day, Officer.""

Officer: <keeps asking questions, especially 'what are you trying to hide'>

You: ""Officer, thank you but I need to know if I'm under arrest or if I'll be free to go.""

I was a little annoyed but when my parents saw that quiz they lost their shit, took a personal day from work and confronted my teacher about it the next school day.
