history,ffe68ao,t3_esvzlp,1579837786.0,No serious historians believe that he circumnavigated the world. He did reach the Eastern coast of Africa.
latin,ffdz89b,t1_ffcxgza,1579832616.0,"Good questions. Personally I wasn't considering inscriptions as when I consider the body of classical Chinese I don't include the Oracle bones or inscriptions on bronzes even though I consider them interesting; they are not things you can sit & read like one may read a book today.

I don't know anything about the non-literary papyri so will take a look."
history,ffab694,t1_ffa9byj,1579731468.0,Wasn't there a motivation to retreat from the coast due to extremely high levels of piracy? I have read this but it also seems a bit too crazy to believe; a national policy to make everyone move inland because of pirates.
AshaDegree,ff8j0ke,t1_ff7uxd2,1579680709.0,"I agree, but have read of stranger things happening."
latin,ff8ivcl,t1_ff7tlx3,1579680515.0,"Yes, Classical Chinese is similar, it is used even until the early 20th century in some cases but vernacular started to emerge half way through the last millennium. I put down the 200ad mark because I think of it as an approximate time where Rome started to decline & the Han dynasty collapsed."
languagelearning,ff7rnpa,t1_ff7qn5t,1579656703.0,"Is this because they haven't read enough text? Maybe they only worked on translating sentences?

I'm curious because I have been reading Lingua Latina & after identifying the meaning of a word I rarely need to think about it again & just read as if it's English. I'm still on early chapters though so maybe it gets a lot harder? I also learnt to read Chinese as an adult & learning to read Latin is a lot more fun."

AshaDegree,ff7l90c,t3_ernyxv,1579652223.0,"If her bag hadn't been found buried I would be more open to this line of thought. It is possible that she was doing something random that has no discernible motivation for an observer, like your walk, & that she was accidentally killed or was kidnapped by an opportunist, but the commenter above puts a number of arguments which taken together I feel more strongly point to grooming & a planned meeting."
languagelearning,ff7jk1g,t1_ff6hkck,1579651054.0,"I have read this on here before but I don't totally understand, there are people who know Latin well but in a way that they can't naturally read it? What does preparing a text involve?"
selfimprovement,ff37we0,t1_ff3405n,1579535792.0,"Ah, yeah I know they have serious literature & many quite famous authors have written articles; I was just joking about the general public perception of the magazine."

ChineseLanguage,ff2sz1a,t1_ff2swm8,1579522854.0,"He said there were mostly Russian, Koreans & some other East Asian nationals on the course back then. He made many friends & has visited them in various countries."
ChineseLanguage,ff2swm8,t3_erav22,1579522764.0,"My friend studied there about 10 years ago & really enjoyed it. It gets very cold but he is Canadian. He is also quite outgoing though & think he would generally get along anywhere. I know a lot of folks from Heilongjiang & they are as kind & friendly as anywhere else, really nice people."
selfimprovement,ff2ssij,t3_erc9wk,1579522618.0,I think that's normal for books you just read through. After finishing novels I often can't remember names of main characters.
