Just like you, I know there's more to this story. But it's almost pointless to try to get people to understand how emergency medicine, (or just medicine, for that matter,) works.

Saying U.S. health care is in crises is putting it mildly. Beside the fact that we don't have a universal health system like the NHS, we absolutely suck at it for what we are capable of. In the world rankings for quality of heath care, The U.K. is tenth, (yes, socialized medicine works,) and the U.S. is 18th.

Wait times at public, eg: county hospitals, can run as high as 24 hours. That's 24 hours sitting in the waiting room. Wait times at UC Med Center in L.A. regularly run at 10 to 18 hours.

I don't know where you work, but at this point, I don't think it matters: I feel for you.

They had a guy ride up on a bike, to people sitting outside at a cafe or coffee shop, and so on, and ask the them if they'd keep an eye on his bike while he ran inside real quick. They, of course, all said 'sure'.

Then, another person would come up and basically steal the bike, right in front of them. And they didn't do it quickly. They'd kind of hem and haw a bit, then walk off with it.

Not one person or couple said anything. They just sat there and watched the guy steal the bike.

Except... The rider rode up to two homeless people sitting under a tree in a park. Guy and a girl, and asked if they'd keep an eye on it while he hit the head. They say they will. Then the guy comes up and tries to take it. Faster than you can spit, the two of them jump up and grab the bike. They're about to go at him, and the production crew runs over and explain what's going on.

nottheonion,fej882c,t1_fej38u0,1579161090.0,"I think there's a misunderstanding about what the heart attack victim represents. The entirety of that story was to show just how much people come to A&Es for things that *aren't* emergencies.

As for that one guy, he was most likely at the point of intake. All emergency departments are going to put cardiac episodes at the front of the line, as soon as they've assessed it as one.

The NHS is a far ahead of us in health care. The U.S. is ranked 39th in the world for quality of heath care, Canada id ranked the 30th, and the U.K. is ranked 18th.

But, same as you, whenever I've taken my dad to the ER with anything remotely cardiac, he's brought into evaluation quickly. Heart attacks and strokes go beyond the urgency of the patient dying right then and there. The minutes count because of the long term damage that can be mitigated, and what drugs can be given if you get the patient early enough.

I'm sure you know all this, since you're obviously dealing with it regularly. It's more for the benefit of those following along at home.

All A&Es run on a priority matrix. People have a lot of misconceptions about how emergency medicine, (and just medicine in general,) works. Despite what people think, emergency rooms are not first come/first served. Patients are prioritized by severity of condition and availability of resources.

However, since a large number of ER visits are unnecessary, it often looks like it's first come/first served. Sit in any A&E, and you will see people watching who gets called, and noting whether those people came in before or after them.

If you've got eight people with an assortment of nose bleeds, dislocated fingers, tummy aches, black eyes, and sore backs: Those people are going to be seen in order. But not before the person with labored breathing and sky high BP, or a compound fracture.

nottheonion,feisvl3,t3_ep2h8z,1579146341.0,"It sounds like there may be some outliers, in this situation, but the majority of the overburdened A&E and E.R. departments, as well as ambulance and paramedics, is because those services are abused on a horrific scale.

If they started charging the thousands of drunks in the U.K. that abuse the ambulance service, 50% of their workload would clear up.

And I don't mean changing the NHS to a pay system, like the Conservatives want. I mean charging these idiots that can't hold their drink, and call for an ambulance for everything from a broken toe to expecting a ride home.

The NHS is a great system, but people abuse the fuck out of it. Here's a perfect example of how people go to A&E for shit they could just wait and see their GP for:

When the tube bombings happened, at one hospital they got on the PA and announced that multiple bombing had happened around the city, and that they were expecting hundreds of patients to arrive. So could anyone who didn't have an actual emergency please go home.

Almost 200 people cleared out of the waiting room, except for one guy, who was having an actual heart attack.

Even here in the U.S., people go to the E.R. for things like splinters, sprained wrists. Hundreds of things that are in no way emergencies.

The NHS strives to have wait times to no longer than 4 hours. People in the U.S. try to point to that as to why socialized medicine is bad. First off: I've been with Kaiser since I was born, and even belonging to a premier private health plan, I've seen 3-4 hour waits on a busy night.

And we *do* have socialized medicine in the U.S. they're called county hospitals. The USC Med Center in California is the single largest care provider in L.A County, and in addition, is a level 1 Trauma Center. It is one of the busiest EDs in the world with roughly a million visits a year.

Average wait time: 10 hours. And it is common for people to sit in the waiting room for up to 18 hours or more to be seen.

What there needs to be is a long term, concentrated public education campaign to teach the public what constitutes an actual emergency, and how important it is to not abuse and clog up the system."

Drunk and/or hysterical women are the worst creatures on the planet. And trying to get them in cuffs is an Olympic event. It taking four or five officers to get one pinned is not out of the ordinary, at all.

Although, you will occasionally get a male who won't let it go, even after they're cuffed and a jail, once a woman is in that state, they're that way until they pass out. And when they wake up in the morning, half of them have no memory of what happened, other than getting really drunk.

They are like a fucking Terminator: They just never stop. She's been bounced off the wall three times, off a car twice, taken to ground by three or four officers three times her size, all her clothes torn off... They'll just keep on going. Screaming, spitting, kicking, biting, scratching, head butting. (And this is all after they've already been in fights with two or three girls and guys before you even got there.)

They basically don't give a fuck about anything. They get taken to A&E for their injuries: They attack the staff. Even when you finally get them in a cell. They throw around anything not welded down. They smash their heads against the doors and walls.

They're incredibly strong, don't feel pain, and are damn near impossible to control. Almost any female officer will tell you they'd rather fight a guy than a woman."

If you go into A&E or Trauma with an open leg wound, broken ribs puncturing a lung, and your eye hanging by a thread. The thing they'll be most concerned about, is getting antibiotics pumping into you through the IV.

It's not just that you can lose the leg. If it develops into sepsis, you have up to a 60% chance of dying.

If you have access to medical care: Use it."

facepalm,fdebgz5,t3_eksepk,1578335378.0,"I banked with Wells Fargo for 20 years. When it came out what they'd done with creating false accounts, I decided to move everything to the credit union my parents are with, when I moved.

In the first year they did more for me than WF did the entire I was with them.

When I was closing my WF acct. the poor girl at WF had to follow the script WF had created to try and retain customers. They were losing a lot. And the fact they were getting caught at more things, every week, wasn't helping them.

I took the load off her, told her I thought the corp. officers and board members should have to be sitting in branches trying to retain customers. In my book, they were lying cowards, and it was unfair to saddle workers like her with doing it.

You could tell by the look of relief on her face, she'd had had to do it a lot. We spent the rest of the time just talking, instead of her having to go through their dog and pony show."

Guitar,fdctdcv,t1_fdcd55y,1578283759.0,"I teched a guy from a really big '80s band. Shit really fell apart on him, so he had to pawn a few guitars. There was only one that really mattered to him, though.

So when the band got back together in the '00s, we went and got it. I think the guy had kept it in back because he was a local kid who made it big. I think the pawn on it was only about $250.

Regular folks can sometimes keep it in the back and off the rack if they work it out with the shop to send some money once in a while."
