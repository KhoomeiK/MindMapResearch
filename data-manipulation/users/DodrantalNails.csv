300zx,fgup821,t3_f07ku9,1581126239.0,Have louvers on my ‘75 280Z. Super common on 70’s and 80’s Z cars. I think more of a Southwest/ West Coast thing.

nin,fgo3zmy,t3_eze9t8,1580959243.0,"And a huge shoutout to the photographer, Maryelle St Clare, for that shot. I have been telling her for years that this is my favorite shot of TR that she has taken so far. She used to tour incessantly with NIN, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Queensrÿche, Gary Numan, Five Finger Death Punch, and many more. 

Look up meowhousemedia.com for more of her photography."
