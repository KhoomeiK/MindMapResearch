Genealogy,ff3btmy,t3_erdvqs,1579538083.0,"DNA tests are helpful in conjunction with census, birth, marriage etc records. 

I have found the Ancestry test allowed me to confirm some hypotheses and gave me some hints on where to look, but it still requires you to make the links using records. 

Autosomal testing is only really helpful back to 4-5 cousin range. At that range you may only have 8-20cm in common so it can be difficult to filter out the ""noise"". I have upwards of 200,000 cousin matches on Ancestry, but I generally only look at 4th cousins and closer. 

If you do DNA testing, try to test the oldest generation in your family. There is a big difference in what details my father's DNA turns out versus mine. For example, our family came to North America from Ireland/Scotland in the early 1800s. What most North Americans are looking for is - where exactly did their ancestors come from? Can ""Ireland"" or ""Scotland"" be honed to a specific place - if you can do that, you can narrow your records search.

My DNA just indicated I'm 50% or so ""ethnically"" Irish. However my father's DNA was able to indicate which particular area of Ireland. 

I have found even with ancestors doing some intermarrying of cousins etc, that the relationship predictions in Ancestry to be fairly accurate. My problem is finding the records to match."

I also hate fancy cupcakes - mainly because there is way too much icing on them. You shouldn't have to scrape 3/4 of the icing off to reach the ideal cake to icing ratio.

I'll admit to being more of a pie person - give me a flakey melt in the mouth pastry with some slightly sweet fruit and i'm in heaven over chocolate cake any day.

dogs,fejurke,t3_epi99u,1579186318.0,"Generally dogs will do air snaps as a warning. Other dogs usually heed that. 

I would be concerned about a dog over correcting a puppy because generally dogs give puppies a bit more leeway before they escalate. Especially to a grab and shake.

My dog who is not a fan of other dogs, makes a lot of noise and shows teeth and growls and airsnaps at her younger brother, grabs his  muzzle and all that but never ever a grab and shake. 

I will say - she has been in fights with her sister and I did consider putting her down. I would never give a dog up for biting, to me that is just inviting trouble and giving the problem to someone else. The thought of putting her to sleep  I'll admit - I felt relief. And guilt for feeling it would be a relief to not have to worry about her response to other dogs and people anymore. I did however get in touch with a good trainer, we established the reason for the fighting and did some counter conditioning and they are better together now than ever before.

But as difficult a decision as it is to keep the dog, do you have the time and resources to train it to appropriate responses to other dogs? Do you have the watchfulness to make sure it is muzzled or keep an eye on it? Because from my perspective it is exhausting to contemplate a dog walk. We have to always be on the watch for other dogs approaching, can't go on any trails where there may be offleash dogs etc. It's not fun.

I did send an email to Tim Horton's (it's hard to find somewhere to complain), and I was not the only disgruntled person. Surely the cost of supplying cinnamon raisin bagels is not MORE than that of jalapeno cheddar? I'm sure they are at LEAST equally as popular.

It's not perfect, but better than we anticipated. Both we and our neighbours have dogs and you can only hear barking if you are close to the windows. And even then, it is faint. 

Probably our biggest issue is one neighbour had kids and they seemed to run up and down the stairs and the thumping would drive us crazy. Fortunately they moved out. Can't hear voices or TVs or music. Only other thing we hear is neighbour on the other side has a teenage son and a surround sound system. He obviously cranks it while playing some kind of video games because the low rumbling sounds like a FedEx plane taking off.

dogs,fdnlbsq,t3_em17se,1578588194.0,"Dogs ( i forget the right terminology) do not extrapolate one idea in one area to another. So a dog that sits inside the house does not necessarily respond to that command outside. So you always have to build from the bottom up.

If he can come in the house with no distractions, from 1 foot, from 3 feet, from 5 feet, from another room 80% of the time - then try on a long line out in the yard in a very low distraction environment - start from the beginning again, 1 foot, 3 feet, 5 feet etc. 

It sounds like you skipped some steps. Do you only call him back from having fun to end the fun? Or do you recall him, then send him back out to play? if coming back to you means the fun ends then, yeah I wouldn't come back either. 

Another thing you can do - be a slot machine. Why do people play slot machines? They put money in for hours and hours for the CHANCE of an occasional jackpot. 

Do that with your dog - if he DOES come back make a HUGE deal of it, give him a handful of treats and have a dance party. Your dog will DEFINITEly remember that and will be more likely to come to see if he can get the same result again. Then sometimes give one treat and sometimes give 0 treats...he will keep playing the slots just like those people in Vegas that sit in one spot all day with diapers on. 

Another thing think about is if you have poisoned the word ""come"". By that I mean - you say come....come...come....COMEE... he learns that Come does not in fact mean - drop everything and go back to njudson. You may need to come up with another word that you say once and make sure you only say once. 

I have also practiced (although not recently unfortunately) an emergency come with my dogs. This is a word you do not use normally (in my case it is Schnell) that when the dogs hears you yell it, their auto response is to turn and run to you. If you have trained it well - the dog will not think before turning and running back to you. I have used this before when I let my dogs out not knowing there was a FedEx truck backing out of my long driveway - dogs ran to chase the truck, i yelled the emergency word and they pivoted and ran back to me. It takes  lot of practice to get that auto response though.

I also have dogs that I yell to come and i can see them weighing their options  ie...am I more fun than what they are currently chasing, smelling etc. So it's always a work in progress, especially imo with independent working breeds like terriers/hounds which is what I have. I typically do not let them offlead unless the environment is fenced."

dogs,fchan5a,t3_eh84in,1577648810.0,"As my dogs have gotten older they are less inclined to want to play with other dogs. I can see an older dog not wanting another dog to jump on him, that is kind of rude behaviour and most dogs won't tolerate it. Especially once they are no longer puppies themselves. Note too - different dogs have different play styles. Not all dogs put up with Slappy Happy Labs. Find a couple of dog friends he is comfortable with, he may be more willing to play with them. Or possibly, he just is not interested in playing with other dogs anymore. 

I'm not sure what problem is with him guarding a toy from another dog? Growling at another dog over a resource is imo perfectly acceptable. A little freeze, lip lift and quick growl - other dog should get the hint and move on. As long as he does not overreact to another dog approaching ie - full on attacking. 

I find it fascinating to watch my dogs negotiate over things like kongs or bullysticks. Generally if one dog has it, the other dogs are careful not to make any quick movements around them. Usually no snarling, but it is clear no sharing will happen. Of course, if the dog gets up for a drink of water - then the treat is fair game to the other dogs. Occasionally one of my dogs will attempt to wheedle a toy from the other - lots of grovelling and occasionally a lot of very vicious sounding snarls - but eventually one will relent. I noticed this only happens between my boy dog and his older sister - the sisters never try to take each others stuff. He gets away with it because he is willing to abase himself abjectly puppylike before his sister. 

Of course no resource guarding is tolerated with me and they seem to understand those rules. Basically taught them that by always making sure to give them something good in exchange for anything I take."

personalfinance,fc9ee8m,t1_fc97lhi,1577551406.0,"So is it basically a spec house you are looking at? Like the same builder for the neighbourhood, putting up houses to sell? 

While everybody needs to make money, I would be cautious about buying a spec house. On one hand it is a bit cheaper since, likely builder has done the build before etc and knows all the costs, but on the other hand, their incentive is to build it as cheaply as they can get away with and sell it as fast as possible. 

Example - our very first house we bought was a general contractor who wanted to sell a piece of land, he figured if there was a house on it - he could get more from the sale. So we bought the house  when it was at the framed stage. However, only after living there a bit we saw shortcuts were taken. One in particular we were glad we caught before they put the drywall up because they  had a general labourer do the insulation. We had them take it all out and redo it. But doubt they would have if we hadn't caught them. 

Our next house - supposedly was build by a general contractor. Had some nice features and finishes. But when we came to redoing the deck and some other issues we noted some deficiencies in the build. Which then makes you wonder - what else did they cover up?

I'm not saying every contractor is shady or every spec house is crappy, but buyer beware. Do your homework.

We like our current builder and every store we go into when we say who we are building with, the people are very complimentary of him. He is not building to the building code standard, but has picked out things like insulation for one that is slightly more expensive but better quality. After our first couple of experiences, we would prefer to spend more money on the parts of the house you don't see and less on cosmetics. 

Houses are generally the biggest financial investment you will make and lets face it, they are an emotional purchase. But try to reign in the emotions as much as you can."
personalfinance,fc94c43,t3_egq3t4,1577546824.0,"Currently building a house. You typically need a bit more upfront for a construction mortgage. We had $50k downpayment. But that didn't even cover the cost of the land. Plus we needed a $50,000 deposit to the builder to start. 

Basically the bank decides if they can take the risk on you. They had to inspect our house plans, do an appraisal of the neighbourhood and see what typical house prices in the area were. They gave us basically a 120k line of credit to start. In order to start the mortgage, they need to have an asset to back it up - a vacant piece of land is not enough. We used our downpayment, plus the LOC to buy the land and get the builder started. Do we like having 120k unsecured line of credit - no. 

So currently paying interest on 100k line of credit, and the builder and bank set up certain milestones for construction draws. We pay the interest on the LOC and construction draws. Typically the draws come at points like - when the foundation is inspected and done, when the house is roof tight etc. I think there usually are 4-5 milestones. 

The builder lets us know when a milestone is reached. We contact the bank - bank sends out an inspector and releases funds according to the % finished the house is. For example, our builder wanted a larger draw on the second one than the bank was willing to give him, but on the third draw he got more than he had first put in our plans. We let the builder and the bank figure that one out. Every draw we go to lawyer and pick up the check- we just made the lawyer make the check out directly to the builder - we give him the money and on we go. 

Although we managed to get a fairly good interest rate on our construction mortgage, you will not get as good of a rate as you can get just buying a house. 

Here are my thoughts on building  a custom house:

 You will go over the original estimate unless you are very very strict. Make sure your agreement with the builder is very comprehensive. In retrospect, i would have gone over the allowances with a bit more of a critical eye, because basically the builder gave us allowances according to where he buys the items normally - now you think - well you have an allowance so you have choice, but if the allowances are too low it limits you to what the builder normally gets, where they get it. 

It will be substantially more expensive than buying a house that is a couple of years old. So you decide if that extra 50-60 grand is worth it. We literally looked at a house across the street and were like..man if we are going to pay a half a million dollars on a house - it better have all the features we want. In retrospect - financially - cheaper to buy that house and put in a fireplace, better counters etc and live with the little things because unless you have unlimited funds - you are never really going to get exactly what you want. When buying a house you don't usually think - wow, I'm going to pay an  extra 30k for this house because they did extra landscaping or put in a fence. Those basically become sunk costs for a homeowner. You may never get that money back when selling the house in the future. Or even all the little details like the type of trim work in the house. Literally never looked closely at that stuff before, but it all makes a difference in costs. 

Going back to overruns - you can be strict but you will have moments like this - for example, we had the quote for the heatpump. Gets time to put it in - I forget the details but it came down to like..ok..so for an extra $2000 you can have dual zone heating and for an extra $500 you can have some sort of soft start for power outages. So you have to weigh the math of the extra couple thousand against basically the lifetime of the house. We opted to pay the bit extra because to us it was worth it in the long run and $500 here and $1000 extra there - add up. Knowing we will likely not be able to recoup this amount in future, we felt it was worth it enough for our comfort to spend a bit extra. I'm not sure I managed to stay inside ANY of the allowances. Another one was flooring. Because we can change light fixtures but flooring is likely to stay awhile. 

I probably should have sprung for a consult with some sort of interior designer. Every single decision I made, as soon as I walked out of the store, I immediately second guessed it. I'm typically not really great with that type of stuff. I looked at so so so many Houzz pictures that eventually all of the houses became a blur. I realized that I didn't necessarily want a generic ""nice"" house. I wanted to have some of our personality in it and if it wasn't exactly what a professional would do then maybe that's ok. I didn't go super extreme - no carpet on the walls, or anything too strange, but I think everything works together. gulp

You need to be prepared for contingencies. Our house is already a month and a half overdue. (make sure there is a clause in your contract that will penalize the builder for being late). We likely won't be able to be in it until the beginning of February. Fortunately, we are on a month to month rental and our landlord seems happy to keep us here an extra couple of months. 

Some of the nice things about building a custom house - we are able to customize the ""innards"". The design of the house had several pocket doors - which were nice on paper, but when it came to trying to figure out where to put all the light, heat switches in the bathroom we couldn't find a wall to put them on until we just took out the idea of the pocket door. We showed them where all of the fixtures should be, where we wanted plugs etc etc. We moved a couple of walls. We installed the heating system we wanted and the fireplace we liked. Things you wouldn't normally do if you bought a house. 

For the control freaks out there - you are able to inspect the house from the inside out. Our first house we bought, the  builder cut so many corners. You don't see these once all the walls are up. Our current builder knows we are watching like hawks. If we see something we don't like or have questions about - we ask. He explains why he did what he did and we either see that it makes sense, or we say no change it. Ex. we asked for a plug in the master walk in closet. Electrician forgot. We did the walk through - noticed it wasn't there and at first were like..ok no big deal, but then longer we thought about it we were like..you know..no, lets get him to come back. So he did. We had to kind of forgo the typical Canadian - ""don't want to be a bother"" attitude. It is super hard! 

This got really long. Short answer I guess is, yes the bank will do a construction mortgage but you are going to pay more for it."
