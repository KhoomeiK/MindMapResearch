politics,ffgof1c,t1_ffgmfx5,1579911005.0,People who are genuinely progressive and thoughtful about it don't make insults like that. They don't see gender as something to insult someone over. But you're right it doesnt seem like they are particularly intelligent.
politics,ffgnu9a,t1_ffgmnrg,1579910598.0,"That's a bit of an oxymoron. An unborn child would not be a child, moreover given that a fetus lacks consciousness it really cant have autonomy, as autonomy requires an awareness of oneself."
politics,ffgnn42,t1_ffg985s,1579910460.0,"I think it's a matter of nuance, of course a human blastocyst is human, it could be nothing else. However, there is a difference (in orders of magnitude) between even a newborn and a human at 12 weeks of development. This comes down to a matter of personhood. Should the rights of potential persons be weighed as heavily as those of persons?"

politics,feyevfg,t1_fewx2hp,1579444543.0,"Or perhaps you haven't considered that although policy should be informed by evidence, allowing adults to partake in relatively low risk substances is a matter of autonomy, and we should seek to reduce harm not limit access.

politics,fetnin5,t1_fetarur,1579377230.0,"I suppose I have a problem with decriminalizing it as that doesn't end all punishment for possession. Very conservative states are likely to maintain civil penalities which adversely impact poorer people. It's a start for certain, but I'm leary of the impact that decriminalizing can have on progress towards full legalization. Legalizing a substance that we do have a fair (though unfinished) knowledge of helps promote autonomy. We could discuss whether autonomy or safety are more important."
politics,fet7cqh,t1_fesqkj4,1579372453.0,"Absolutely we should have evidenced based policy, but that doesn't mean that it's the end all be all of policy considerations. People should be allowed to make certain decisions for themselves, whether or not to smoke a relatively harmless drug should not be within the purview of the government to prohibit. We should seek to reduce harm, not autonomy."

politics,feesr4p,t1_fee6fb6,1579040416.0,It isn't a particular abhorrent comment if it was made at all. In the United States it is likely to be significantly more difficult for a woman to win a general presidential election. It isn't the same as saying a woman shouldn't win.
