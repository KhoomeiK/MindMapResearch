One day my dad and his friend Larry were four-wheeling out in the desert. They'd been at it all day and decided to pull over for a while, set up the grill, and make some lunch. My dad spot's an old Spanish mission off in the distance and says ""Hey, that looks like a good spot. Let's stop there."".

Larry isn't so sure but my dad is driving so he doesn't really have a choice. They pull over, my dad hops out, grabs the grill and the cooler and sets everything up in the courtyard of the mission. Larry stayed in the truck while my dad fired up the grill. He really didn't like the idea disrespecting a church that way. 

After a while, though, Larry decides just to go with it but, just as he's about to get out of the truck, a little old man in priest's vestments comes out of the mission, walks up to my dad, and blesses him (giving the spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch motion). My dad immediately packs everything up, runs back to the truck, and peels off without saying a word. After a few minutes of silence, Larry asks my dad ""Why did that old priest come out and bless you?"" 

To which my dad says ""He didn't. He came out and said ""**YOU** (pointing at the persons head) **TAKE THIS FUCKING SHIT** (pointing at the grill and stuff on the ground) **AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!** (yanking your thumb across your chest from left to right.

My dad would go on for ages about him doing the trick from higher and higher ladders.

 The trick gains him some notoriety and eventually lands him on a talkshow where a famous gambler bets him a million dollars he can do the trick from the top of the building. The conductor takes the bet, loses, and shoots the gambler backstage because he couldn't pay the bet.

Charged for murder, sentenced to death, yadda yadda. Thn my dad had two ways of extending the setup. First, for his last meal, the conductor would request a Cuban Cabana cigar that increased in length and took longer to smoke with each attempted execution. He'd also explain how, with each attempt, the prison would route more and more electricity to the electric chair; the whole prison, the whole town, the whole county, the whole state.

funny,feveqa4,t1_fev6eo5,1579396505.0,"That's mostly down to the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act. The Army was running a trial to replace Universal Camouflage Pattern but the 2014 NDAA contained a clause that prohibited any branch of the military from adopting yet another camo pattern unless all the other branches also adopted it unless it was already in the DoD inventory.

So the Army pretty much stole the Multicam pattern then modified it and renamed it to Scorpion W2 so they didn't have to pay to license it, and rolled that out as the Operational Camouflage Patter that we're all standardizing to now. Honestly, the uniform itself is better than our old service specific uniforms, the pattern is more effective, and having us all standardized to one uniform again is more cost-effective so, by my estimation, OCP is an all around upgrade.

Also, Scorpion isn't a woodland-specific pattern. It was designed to be effective in multiple environments. As to why the Air Force has a camo pattern at all; it comes down the fact that it just adds financial and logistical hassle to have a specific uniform for us when we've got warehouses full of OCP uniforms that work just fine."
