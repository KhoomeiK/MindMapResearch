It’s all a big scam involving giving them an advance, then taking that out of what’s made, plus advertising costs, radio promotion, tour support, etc. 

Record companies will literally try to ‘break even’ when it comes to the band and charge them as much for all that as the advance they got AND what the record made so they owe them $0 from actual record sales. 

So they advance a million then say they spend a million on all those extras - now they owe the band nothing if the record makes 2 million dollars. Even big bands like 30 secs to mars have said they’ve pulled that Hollywood accounting on them and they made $0 on a record before..."

When DVD’s hit the market they flooded the stores with copies so they were like $30, then blu rays were even more prolific and were what, $20 new? Or as cheap as a $1 or $2 to rent. 

Now with digital they’re even cheaper. If you wait for sales at stores and Black Friday and such, you can get them for $5-$10, brand new and with blu ray, dvd, and digital code to stream anywhere. 

I know lots of people with huge collections and it seems so absurd then they go ‘well I can go see it once in theaters for $10-$15 and deal with people talking and on their phones, chomping on food or opening up wrappers, walking by to use the restroom 3 times, etc or I can pay around that much and own it forever and watch in HD with surround sound at home, and pause whenever I want.”

Showerthoughts,fekxrcb,t1_fekwttg,1579209794.0,"Yah one is a closet door, and the other is like how hotels have a door between rooms connecting them together. It leads to his neighbors room that he doesn’t have access to. I don’t recall a third door other than the one to the hallway though..."
trashy,fekx49c,t1_fekwpc6,1579209413.0,"Gahhhh that’s the worst. I sometimes see them on the sidewalk. That means someone brought a bag, picked up the poop off the grass with it, tied it up, then dropped it onto the sidewalk. It’s like the worst of the possible options."
television,fekpprr,t1_fekjg0r,1579205043.0,"It’s also mostly for people with kids, cause they’ll watch the same movie over and over. Most adults don’t want to watch ONLY g/pg movies and shows, it gets old very fast. And if you have to have another streaming app to pay for anyway, you may as well just go with that 2nd one because they probably have a ‘kids’ section anyway for the young ones..."
television,fekpakj,t1_feknfb8,1579204790.0,"That’s the biggest problem for sure. I actually canceled NF because they kept losing the few things I wanted to watch, and their originals for the most part don’t do anything for me and remind me of cable years ago before it got good.

trashy,fekp18b,t1_fekm3nd,1579204636.0,"I think so. But the idea is that if companies realized they were over printing by a huge number and spending more than they had to, maybe they would cut it down and we’d have less waste that way."
trashy,fekoxb7,t1_fekd07t,1579204573.0,"Dunno why this is downvoted, the USPS is absolutely kept afloat by junk mail. It’s not the main source I don’t think, last I read the ratio was like 2:1 regular mail to junk mail, but still, it’s an insane amount. They even publicly said they were going to start delivering more of it in like 2011 or 2012 as a way to stay open since they weren’t making enough off regular mail..."
