WhipItOut,ffc1kag,t3_esisk0,1579789205.0,very nice indeed
nosleep,fct8f5u,t3_eioka1,1577935628.0,The ending was unexpected which made the whole thing excellent!
SuicideWatch,fcitxqk,t3_eg359h,1577669733.0,I'm with you there. I feel the same way. I feel like I lack a shell or something. Life is so abrasive. My default mode is misery. I am afraid of feeling happy because I know something will ruin it.
OCD,fcitk0p,t3_dkeuqc,1577669472.0,I will pray for you. Please pray for me. I feel the same way as you
depression,fcis85z,t3_ecb4lx,1577668578.0,"I think this every single night. I don't want to hurt anyone by not being here, but that angers me. I am a hostage to a life I hate.   
The never-ending treadmill."
depression,fcirtiy,t1_fbm6069,1577668311.0,"I've heard the  ""keep going, it'll get better if you do this thing"" for more than 45 years. It has never gotten easier. I don't find enjoyment in anything."
depression,fcir1l8,t3_edvvhg,1577667774.0,"I have nearly made it to 50 feeling the same way. I can't do anything about it because I am responsible for other people. But yes, life seems like a waste of time. I don't enjoy it, I suffer it. It's made me physically pretty ill. Our bodies are just not able to handle constant sadness and a desire to not be here."
depression,fciq558,t3_eeh20j,1577667169.0,"I don't open up either. Nobody is interested anyway. Or I get trite comments like 'snap out of it', 'pull your socks up' and the even more annoying 'everyone has problems'."
mentalhealth,fcip7jc,t1_fc79bsy,1577666560.0,I feel the same way. A constant desire to die but not being able to due to responsibilities. It seems only merciful to me to be put out of my misery.
mentalhealth,fcioe5e,t3_egbvcx,1577666067.0,"I agree. Nothing has helped me. Not therapy, not medication. I think of this as a life sentence. No enjoyment, no interest in anything. Cripling anxiety. I try to make myself walk for a while each day, lately, I haven't bothered. I spend most of my time in bed. There is nothing to get up for. Sometimes I feel nothing at all, the rest of the time I feel nothing but sadness, emptiness and a never-ending feeling that I am not good enough."
LifeProTips,fcinfjy,t3_ee5dxo,1577665505.0,"I am the person who nobody checks on. I hate this time of year. From age seven for the next six years, I lost my grandmother, grandfather, auntie, cousin, my other grandfather, my father abandoned the family and left a 12-year-old me in 'charge'. He told me that I was now responsible for my mother and sister (I am the youngest in the family).   
All of this happened around Christmas and NYE. I don't celebrate. I'm now nearly 50 years old and nothing has ever worked out. Despite therapy, medication, and doing two degrees, nothing ever changes. I am still a very anxious and deeply unhappy person. I am still that helpless 12 year old."
AskReddit,fcilmh7,t3_dvt5e3,1577664625.0,"I just shut down. I stop eating. Lose all interest in anything that used to interest me. I sit on my bed in the dark even during the day. I sleep as much as I can. I don't see people. I become irritable. I feel that nobody wants me around. I get anxious about even leaving the house. I can't make myself be social.   
I cancel plans, which makes me seem unreliable. From past experience, I have learned to not talk about it. I feel ineffable sadness. I don't feel hope for the future. I don't want to inflict my company on other people. Despite therapy and a load of medication, nothing changes. I have given up on the idea of ever living a life, unlike this one.   
I don't believe in love."
AskReddit,fcijhlm,t1_f6z991z,1577663588.0,"I can relate to this on so many levels. My default state is down. Just to feel something other than relentless misery would be nice, but then it all just goes back to the beginning.  
There really is no point to me living except to be of service to other people.  
Once I am no longer needed, I can finally let go"
australia,f878lrj,t3_dz9uvi,1574320573.0,"It's a harmless huntsmen spider. I have several living in the house with me. They eat cockroaches and other nasties. I will never understand why people automatically assume that huntsmen are dangerous.   
In other words; yes it may not be pretty, but it is Australian wildlife.   
In the heat and drought, we are in, huntsman spiders are coming into houses more often because they, like us, need water.   
They will only bite us when we threaten them. They are only defending themselves."
