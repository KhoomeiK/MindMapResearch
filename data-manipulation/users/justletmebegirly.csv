Accelerate it by say 15 m/s^2 and people (along with everything that isn't bolted down) would start do drift into space on the ""rearward"" side of the earth. Accelerate it by say 1000 m/s^2 and everything on the ""rearward"" side of the earth would quickly shoot off into space. People on the ""front side"" would be squished against the ground and quickly die."

The problem is the constraints that you set in your previous comment:

> G stays the same, our distance relative to the sun stays the same, the mass of the sun and the gravity of earth don't change. 

Those constraints makes the question unanswerable! Because the only sensible answers are that either the orbital distance changes, or G has to be changed to allow for the same orbit, or the mass of the sun has to change. There are no other options left, any other answer is just fantasy, and definitely doesn't belong in this sub. 


>Weird stuff happens all the time in space and the laws of physics get broken, so your argument of ""you can't ask science what happens when you ignore science"" feels invalid to me

That is just crackpot BS though, you're bordering flat earth rhetoric. What ""weird stuff"", and what laws of nature gets broken? You won't be able to answer that question with any other answer than ""none and none"".

It's like asking a mathematician ""if 1+1=3, what is 1+2?"" the answer is that it's whatever you want it to be, because you can't ask math what happens if you ignore math."

Edit: just found a table, European 95 octane fuel is equivalent to US 90.25 octane (My guess is that they just omit the decimals on the pumps) and European 98 is 93.1 in the US. 99 in Europe is 94 in the US."

AskPhysics,fcy8lp5,t3_ejg2i4,1578076358.0,"The first law of motion can be stated as

> Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external [force](http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Force.html) acts on it.

It's also called the law of inertia. It basically means that you don't have to keep pushing an object to keep its speed up (unless there is friction, of course). Throw a ball in space, and it will keep going indefinitely.

The second law is about what happens to an object when forces aren't balanced (I.e. it accelerates in the direction of the net force) 

> Force equals mass times acceleration. F = ma or F = m * dV/dT 

It can be algebraically rewritten to a = F/m and m = F/a.

One important thing to note about the third law is that these two forces act on different objects. I.e. you push on an object with a certain force, and the object pushes back on you with an equal force in the opposite direction."
