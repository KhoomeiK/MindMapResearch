FragileWhiteRedditor,fejrmbt,t1_feiu10i,1579184119.0,"honestly he was a racist. it stemmed from when he frist came to america, he would get jumped by nazi skinheads and robbed frequently enough and the same by black and spanish people in the area. so he hated anyone that  looked poor, as to him they were all the bad sort in his eyes. 
it was never a judge of character it was about perception.

as for with girls, i can only assume, it was one of two things.
i had a bit of a good streak with dating very attractive girls, also he might have had high anxiety when it comes to speaking to any females, so as much as he wanted to kick them out also, he couldn't. 
so i assume, either he was okay with me punching up, or he couldnt tell them to get out cause he couldn't talk to girls."

But I too have had this happen, so I knelt down to the table, talking to everyone on a group, and did the math on the back of the check, making it very clear that I'm giving them more money then they would have otherwise.

I guess this embarrassed them, cause they ended up leaving a huge tip. Although it wasn't my intention to embarrass anyone for anything, I needed to clear my good name."
MagicArena,fefpmq3,t3_eootz4,1579061663.0,"So I have this deck where I make lots and lots of treasure tokens with smothering tithe.

It's frustrating, cause I have to wait till two timeouts are available to just combo off, without autopassing my turn after getting tokens.


Side note. Why can't using tokens be streamlined also, like why to I gotta crack 6 or 7 of them individually....

It's more encouraging him to not want to hide at home. Because it becomes a habit. And a hard to break habit.

Remember, the change has to be his. You can only guide him down the path, you can't make him walk.

And, remember not to put to much stress on yourself, you can't 'fix' him. So don't get stressed out of every attempt isn't successful, it's about encouraging better behaviors. And lots of showing you feeling, hugs and words, both make someone like him(like me) feel a bit stronger."
