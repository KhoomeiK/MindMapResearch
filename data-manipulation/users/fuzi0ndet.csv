If he only knew just how big of an influence he had on people, especially kids that grew up on his music, maybe he'd still be around? Some people have no idea how amazing they truly are and when their demons take over all that gets lost.

I'd finally come to terms I'm going to be going grey soon, but I just kind of thought I am still pretty young. Now that I'm reading comments like this I wonder if when things cool off a bit if they'll go away.

DetroitRedWings,ffayfjp,t1_ff8ebdh,1579747387.0,"I like AA, have a signed jersey of his. It's a hard year on everyone. He wanted top 6 money and I don't think he's been playing at that level the last two seasons. Offense is obviously lacking and important, what's really lacking are consistent play makers. 

Be a defensive liability, but create offense. I've been to a lot of games this year. It's given me a lot more perspective on the game. I see A LOT of guys out there trying to go in and do it themselves or over thinking it trying to force things. 

Where I'm disappointed is that he's got that raw athletic talent, but I'm not seeing the decision making come along. Ride his ass because of stats, I don't really give a shit. I've been lucky enough to see the best of the best all my life. What we lost in Pav and Hank were guys that elevated people around them and created offense without going it alone. 

Most of AA's sex appeal is his ability to speed past everyone. You can't be one dimensional in any sport. I hope that he is back next year, I believe this is Blashill's last year. New philosophy could be conducive to him and others."

How many guys currently on the squad wouldn't make the big league team outside of injury call ups? Maybe a few need more time down in the AHL but I think there are a few that simply do not have it. Then again we've seen a good number of those guys come and go over the last 5 years."

I had one boss who was a master, would 1,000% get fired as an associate today, but he wasn't wrong. An old school sales guy who'd managed some really hard ass dudes back when sales guys could earn comfortable wages selling just about anything. Just to give you an idea of the times, back in the 70s and maybe 80s, he said that disputes over sales could be settled in the parking lot, and managers looked the other way lol. 

One time we had some big money oil guy in and was haggling big time, but was just really showing off for a buddy with him. Look at me I could buy this but I'm not, I'm just here to fuck with people. Well, he ran into a master troll. 

This guy just wouldn't take no for an answer.  In our store we couldn't arbitrarily lower prices, only match, otherwise you're a dead man. It was a factory store, no price changes arbitrarily, and this guy wouldn't stop. Like he was going to be the guy, on a $1,000 item none the less.

My boss had had enough. So he says, ""Let me get this straight, if I lower the price of the device, right now, you'll buy it?""

Pushy Customer: ""Yes!""

Boss: Takes the fancy price tag holder off of the table and lowers it to the ground.

Customer's Friend: Bursts into laughter. 

Pushy Customer: Storms off in a fit. 

My boss just chuckled and went on about being a grizzled old man. He reminds me of Trump, but with class, and intelligence lol. Would say the most inappropriate shit, and walk right up to the line, jump over it, stay a minute, and then walk it all the way back to super friendly.

A girlfriend of mine got ripped off in a big way in a bad deal paid cash for BMW that was on the hook to be repoed and never got the title. Was out of a lot of money. 

When I told him the story he told me one about how people selling BMWs in the area at that time had been getting jacked by prospective buyers. This is where I'm not certain because he had some crazy stories. They had initiated a stop in relation to one of these car jackings and if I recall correctly, the purp ran, and hjt another car. In the trunk of the car that got hit, was a dude, a dude that was on his way to be executed.

They tried to hit me on that and another fluid because I mentioned I was driving 1200 miles the next day. 

When I moved I stopped by the local quick change. They were going to do it but the manager there said he wouldn't feel right taking 180 from me because the fluid was in great shape.

Back here in Detroit metro, it's mostly miss, very poorly planned in most of Oakland county where I live. 

The exception to the rule is that Denver's insanely popular. Small homes go for big bucks regardless of the schools. I'm currently living in a house 2.5 times the size as the one we had in Denver for the same price, in a far better neighborhood, and school system. People just want to live there."

Fast forward to the birth, sure enough there's something there. I could always pick up the difference between when my kids were hungry or fussy from something like a dirty diaper or gas. The first time I ever heard one of my kids crying in the ""hurt"" mode, it was like I was punched straight in the gut. It was surreal, whenever I hear something similar from other kids, to this day it really flips some switches in me.
