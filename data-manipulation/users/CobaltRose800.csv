kinda getting burned out TBH. I'll admit to being a 200% carebear, and running the same missions or the same wormhole sites over and over again gets boring. Wormholing is slightly less boring but that is in part thanks to the better AI. Incursions don't thrill me as that involves flying around in the same old buffer Maelstrom blob and getting yelled at by the FC for being slow on the alerts. Invasions don't seem to have much of a community base and even then, same problem will probably crop up of me being slow on the alerts and getting yelled at by FC. It also doesn't help being in a four-person corp (all irl friends) where everyone has their own interests and half of them rarely log in for various reasons. Abyssal deadspace is interesting but it still feels like I'm gonna need more cashola to get through safely and reliably. I see low/nullsec as a less-than-ideal option because like I said, I'm a carebear. I have one self-defensive PVP kill to my name and I almost had a panic attack afterwards (IDK how the rest of you guys do it). 

The changes that Team Talos is coming up with are cool and all, I just hope they also give PVE some love alongside all the other stuff they're looking at.
