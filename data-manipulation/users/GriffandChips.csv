rugbyunion,ffqs4am,t1_ffq6awk,1580142371.0,They've always been the wildcard team and they've fully leaned into it with this team selection. It could be a hell of a match.
AmItheAsshole,ffqhvwz,t1_ffq1xxq,1580135050.0,"Staph infections aren't kind either, if you're unhygienic you're a risk of infection to yourself and your training partners."
DebateVaccines,ffq1gy8,t1_ffp2cof,1580115189.0,"Yep, but even the healthiest immune system isn't infallible. Humans will always need help fighting off certain viruses. HIV being the prime example."
DebateVaccines,ffo34ie,t1_ffnx7g4,1580073600.0,">Just to add, if your immune system is functional, are well nourished, and live with sanitation infrastructure, you will be able to fight off any virus. 

That's some dangerous thinking right there. There are plenty of viruses that can kill you without direct medical intervention."
fatlogic,ffi5ci7,t1_ffhzzix,1579965504.0,"Also if they're just eating out as a 'rare treat' the surely it's not the end of the world to indulge yourself?

Unless by rare they mean weekly.."
TheAstraMilitarum,ffgjnhm,t1_ffg59ve,1579907765.0,I've been thinking about an inquisitorial tempestus force as well. Was gonna just be the standard red and black but now I'm definitely stealing the white for the helmets as well!
mattcolville,fffsncl,t3_etd6o2,1579890928.0,"I'd imagine if the hags found out about the changeling then they'd just expose him or her. Is there something that forces a changeling to revert form? Because if there is I'm sure a coven would capitalise on that.

If they couldn't find anything I'd have the hags either try and take them out of the picture quietly or just plant evidence / set the party up do the lizardmen do the hard work for them."
Warhammer40k,ff8qoow,t1_ff8qjkm,1579692109.0,"I'd assume they'd stick the top half of a lord of skulls on it though, just to make it extra demon-y"
Warhammer40k,ff8ozpc,t3_es1g7a,1579689685.0,I feel like this is gonna be a boss fight in the new Doom game.
theunforgiven,ff3tsl3,t1_ff3f4af,1579548691.0,"Yeah I think you're right on all counts. DWK are the best of the Deathwing but they're still terminators at the end of the day. 5 Knights with some reroll support can really put the hurt in, hopefully they'd be able to earn their points back before dying though."
theunforgiven,ff3cj3l,t1_ff1w4px,1579538441.0,"My head canon is that all DA dreadnoughts are Deathwing. If they think you're badass enough for the sarcophagus, then I think they'd clue you in to the first layer of the circle as well."
Warhammer40k,feo6d7q,t3_eq32zw,1579295755.0,That's amazing man. Where did the head come from?
IronWarriors,fekzp1j,t3_epq3ee,1579210956.0,Very cool man! How did you do the eyes?
buildapc,fejwdrw,t3_epihkb,1579187378.0,"How future proof is the GTX 1660 Super?

The benchmarks look pretty good currently."
mattcolville,fegl0y4,t1_fegki0x,1579096057.0,"I'm pretty sure Matt has said before he didn't like the idea of ads on his videos, at best he'd like ads that were relevant to the audience? So maybe that's where OP is coming from?

Personally, if ads mean more sweet sweet MCDM products / media then I'm all for them."
Warhammer40k,feg7vl7,t3_eozjao,1579081209.0,The stormcast helmets are a very nice touch.
DebateVaccines,fede8tz,t1_fec7968,1579009085.0,They like it very much when it is misconstrued to fit the narrative tbf.
Grimdank,fe86ucf,t3_enrokl,1578923216.0,Centurions hate everything within charging distance equally.
Grimdank,fe827cr,t3_eo2dws,1578921615.0,"We were bad, but then we were good, and now we're pretty much constantly fucked."
Warhammer40k,fe7bbr8,t3_eo0xiy,1578912437.0,"If they had Phosphex weapons they could be Rootin-Tootin trench pollutin' Krieger bois.

Either way the paint job is ace man."
fatlogic,fdvlydb,t1_fduw90v,1578748824.0,"You'd better put your big girl pants on, because I'm gonna act like a fucking child."
tolkienfans,fdoonkj,t1_fdom74c,1578609456.0,"Yeah he's such a cool looking character in the movies.

I like to think he was either one of the Nazgul or maybe a Black Numenorean, as we have so little info about either of them."
tolkienfans,fdoi1pp,t1_fdoddbi,1578605564.0,"Is the specification of Orc in one of the appendices?

It's been quite a while since my last reading but I thought the only info we get on him is as a lieutenant as per the quote above?"
IronWarriors,fdobgig,t1_fdo6b6x,1578602165.0,Gentleman and a scholar.
IronWarriors,fdo122l,t3_emdvl5,1578596925.0,"Looks great man! 

What did you do to get the molten effect on the lightning claws? I'm gonna paint this very model soon and wanna go for the same look but with the axe!"
oddlysatisfying,fdmss5u,t1_fdmpv29,1578563993.0,"They've got a head cam on and are snowboarding, what more do you want?"
IncelTears,fdgpsqi,t3_el7tdk,1578405109.0,"I question their ability to beat the shit out of a paper bag.

Their wrists would explode surely?"
Warhammer40k,fdgpj4n,t1_fdghny7,1578404892.0,"Wow I did not think this was contrast paints man, everything looks so crisp.

I've tried painting some DA with the contrast range and it's okay but definitely a little splotchy y'know."
fatlogic,fdgoo5e,t3_elb410,1578404176.0,"'So once I was done with the diet'

How can they blame the diet if, by their own admission, they stopped following said diet and gained it all back?

I wouldn't want anyone to follow such a strict diet for the rest of their life (although I expect the description is pretty exaggerated), but maybe just work towards a more balanced diet that isn't gonna have you gain 100lbs?"
ForeverAlone,fde6q91,t1_fde3qzk,1578332394.0,"Have you worked out your maintenance calorie amount?

Because if you can get about 200 or so calories above that consistently you will start to gain weight. Wrist size has nothing to do with it. Mine are small I'd say (I can make a circle around them with my thumb and any one of my fingers) and I'm above the average size which I'm happy with."
ForeverAlone,fdduxx1,t1_fdcvudl,1578324605.0,"You'll find most people are pretty insecure about how they look man, I absolutely hate my teeth for example.

As far as the working out goes though, what workout split are you following? And more importantly, are you eating enough?

If you're struggling to gain weight it's most likely down to insufficient calories."
rugbyunion,fcx3raj,t1_fcx3k7z,1578049932.0,"I think most of Wales should be before Aled.

In all seriousness though I'd happily have Webb, Davies and Williams in the squad. Davies is just as dangerous on the Wing."
theunforgiven,fcuck51,t1_fcubsin,1577977791.0,"Yeah I think I read somewhere where he's supposed to be specialised in dealing with characters or maybe psykers specifically.

Pretty sure it was on the community website but for the life of me I can't find it now."
40kLore,fctuvlx,t3_eiucrr,1577960752.0,"I've seen the positive aspects of the chaos god's mentioned before.

Khorne being the god of martial prowess and honour.
Nurgle being the god of rebirth etc.

I've not seen it being specific to the fantasy universe though"
totalwar,fcttcfx,t3_eity0b,1577958465.0,Empire Greatswords are just the coolest looking unit.
DebateVaccines,fck080y,t1_fcjmrbl,1577712449.0,"I think that's exactly what they're saying.

I've also seen wackier theories regarding big pharma punishing Samoa for letting vaccination rates fall so low.

Entertaining reading nonetheless."
IncelTears,fc8281n,t1_fc81hb9,1577524960.0,Yeah the Slavic people = subhumans is straight outta the Nazi playbook.
