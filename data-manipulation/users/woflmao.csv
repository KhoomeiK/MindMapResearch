worldnews,fe94mh7,t1_fe93ugf,1578934216.0,Yeah I've considered maybe they want to do an anthology kind of series? Where every season isn't tied to the other? But then they allude to jack killing Soleimani in S2 so that went out the window lol.

Christianity,fe8tb1x,t1_fe8st2c,1578930614.0,"I am 100% ok with gay people, in and out of the church. I was simply responding the the ""mixed fabrics"" fallacy. The NT is not the only thing that matters, but Jesus himself said he fulfilled the law, and the law is summed up as ""love God with everything you are, and love your neighbour as yourself"". All I can be is a vessel for the holy Spirit to work through, and all I can do is love my neighbour as myself. I apologize if I came off as hateful, that was not my intention."

I think it's close, I mean they built up the president dying, and built up Cathy Ryan, but completely omitted those from season 2. Why does jack sleep with someone else in S2? What happened to Cathy? What were the effects of Soleimani dying? Why did they invade the Venezuelan Capitol? Did they get in international shit for that? The writing left a lot to be desired, and this is coming from a guy who likes Phantom Menace, so I can deal with bad writing."

medizzy,fe1fr0e,t1_fbdcu9s,1578825978.0,Write an advance directive that stipulates that kind of measure. Usually your family isn't allowed to just tell docs to let you die unless it's proven that you've given that consent prior.

CapitalismVSocialism,fdodaz5,t1_fdmnb9m,1578603052.0,"I agree with governments, however just wanted to point something out. Companies do have to tell the public their earnings every quarter(go search up any company+investor relations on Google to find their earnings webcasts and transcripts). While you're right it's easy to see when companies pay the government for their own purposes, the cereal lobby did pay the USDA for decades to promote eating grain mostly, which is counter productive to health. So governments are corruptable for sure. I think what libertarians want is simply the choice to go from company A to company B if they find out Company A is up to shady shit."
