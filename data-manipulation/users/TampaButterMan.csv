gaming,ffyvyp1,t3_evkj1u,1580356512.0,Is that Badland chugs?
Cringetopia,ffyask6,t3_evo078,1580342009.0,This is pretty stupid but not worthy of true cringe. The fear the Lord thing is weird though. I thought Jesus was cool and understanding.
Cringetopia,ffyahmt,t3_evpn42,1580341809.0,So veiny
Cringetopia,ffvtpg2,t1_ffrt8oj,1580272971.0,Those have been around for a while. I don't know why I got downvoted. I don't know why paper bags which are recyclable and made from a renewable resource were replaced by plastic in this first place. The reusable bags are nifty but I never remember to bring mine.
Cringetopia,ffrfttz,t1_ffqzrw9,1580157240.0,90% of the plastic trash that makes it into the oceans comes from 10 rivers. Mostly from China and India. I'm too lazy to find the link right this second
Cringetopia,ffrfmo8,t3_eup54f,1580157129.0,Remember when they replaced all the paper bags with plastic bags because it was more responsible? Now it's gone back.
trashy,ffre9pr,t1_ffodez2,1580156310.0,It's definitely easier to wash dishes right after you use them that let them sit. You can also clean most of your stuff while dinner is on the stove. I'm amazed that this is such a major task for so many people.
Cringetopia,ffp6esi,t3_eu8872,1580087399.0,Can this at least wait a month between reposts? This was up like 5 days ago
PoliticalHumor,ffnnqv0,t1_ffmavyd,1580068262.0,Yea have fun with that. Lol
witcher,ffjy7c0,t1_ffixrmf,1580010218.0,I think it was a budget thing. The game is stunning. I don't know how a TV show could make as varied environments that look that beautiful without 100's of millions in budget.
todayilearned,ffjfgo1,t1_ffiwh5z,1579997132.0,The byproduct of creating that type of silicone is silicone tetrachloride. Which is extremely toxic. Also what about the cadmium leaching out? Thanks for calling my comment stupid before even thinking about some of the materials that are in solar panels and how they need to be disposed. The article you linked is from a pro solar site and just saying some parts can be recycled does not nullify the presence of hazardous materials.
todayilearned,ffiw6w5,t1_ffim2q9,1579984181.0,They were able to lock down Fukushima rather quickly with minimal deaths after a typhoon and a massive earthquake. Have you ever seen the specs for nuclear power plants or storage? They are pretty insane. And it is probably way easier to store/ dispose of than all these solar panels will be in the coming decades.
todayilearned,ffhy97r,t1_ffh5my0,1579959051.0,Chernobyl is not comparable to any plants in the US.
todayilearned,ffhy6qx,t1_ffh5uwv,1579958978.0,How many instances of ground water contamination are connected to nuclear power plants or the storage of waste?
todayilearned,ffgzdbw,t1_ffghuql,1579918981.0,Apparently not.
todayilearned,ffgz6gu,t1_ffgqvf4,1579918838.0,"Yea, and ignores the environmental effect those 10's of thousands of dams have on ecosystems."
todayilearned,ffgz1hy,t1_ffgumpr,1579918734.0,"Exactly. It is the cleanest, most efficient thing we have going. And for some reason, no new plants are really being constructed. I hear about the sky falling all the time and how we need all these ""green"" solutions, but nuclear is completely ignored"
todayilearned,ffgyws5,t1_ffgbt8j,1579918634.0,"It's more expensive to do this then it is to remove the dam completely! Many of them are very old and we're used for agricultural reasons. These dams are slowly being removed after the environmental effects have been pretty obvious. It is technically ""renewable energy"", but the effect on ecosystems upstream and down stream are extreme. There really is nothing green about it."
Cringetopia,ffgycsk,t1_ffgs5oo,1579918222.0,Jinjer crushes it
Cringetopia,ffdr037,t3_esvf6d,1579826822.0,"If you add up how much time is needed to do the surveys to get that $, you're better off working a min wage job"
Cringetopia,ffdqil4,t3_esmmp2,1579826517.0,This is an ancient repost. But it's ultimate tier cringe that makes me laugh every time.
witcher,ffb55yc,t3_esjck7,1579752075.0,Blood and wine alone can compete as one of the best games I played last decade.
Cringetopia,ffazig2,t3_ese2xt,1579748107.0,Five finger death punch leans more funnier than intimidating.
Cringetopia,ffazatq,t1_ffaosxj,1579747966.0,"""If rip and tear"" means ferociously J off, then  I'm with you"
Cringetopia,ff7ybpm,t1_ff6x4sp,1579661264.0,"Satire, I hope"
Cringetopia,ff645u1,t3_erpgrn,1579618679.0,I got an electric lawnmower. I don't have to pull anything to start it up
starterpacks,ff43uty,t1_ff3pp0u,1579554953.0,Kevin James real wife is actually very attractive. Being funny probably goes further than you'd think. Leah remini is my sitcom fantasy though.
gaming,ff3suww,t1_ff3bybf,1579548115.0,I got old and one more usually bus only one or two. If it goes bad we all swear and shut it off
videos,fezmihn,t1_fezhu68,1579459013.0,mostly because trump got called out for not sending aid. It was like a month straight of news.
PoliticalHumor,fewfo2s,t1_fewa8jl,1579409809.0,Are you trolling? I don't honestly believe someone can sound that stupid and unhinged.
PoliticalHumor,few9z8x,t1_few0a3n,1579407355.0,What did I lie about it? Your anger that's been perpetuated by your political views has completely clouded your ability to think independently. Open your eyes and look at the actual facts. Obviously you're too deep in and can't admit that you've been an ignorant moron.
politics,few3tvl,t1_fevoolj,1579404957.0,"It's not even a witch Hunt. They're not even attempting to come up with an actual case or charge. It's just political posturing. The common commenters on this page think they are the majority and think this is gaining traction. If T_D wasn't intentionally quarantined, they'd see how that is. It the truth."
politics,few2cs6,t1_feuj5qo,1579404510.0,"""eloquently stated"". Lol. How many self righteous,  jerk off pieces can you liberal cucks get off to over two presidential terms? Christ, get over yourselves."
politics,few10ws,t3_eqnz7r,1579403947.0,How do things about Parnas keep getting all the way to the front page? Just seems fishy. How many people even know who he is?
facepalm,few0ea2,t1_fevrhg7,1579403684.0,"That's definitely what is going on. Look how many empty spots are nearby. When I get a new car, I do park far away from everyone. But only in one spot. For some reason, multiple people find the need to park fractions of an inch away from it."
PoliticalHumor,fevzftj,t1_fev7cch,1579403418.0,"The dumbest politician ever has negotiated trade agreements that no one really disagrees with. He pushed through a bill for paid family leave. That's just the past few weeks. I didn't start put a trump supporter, but his success has been pretty clear. The only people that don't support him claim superior intelligence. But in reality they are just too full of themselves to admit their utter arrogance."
PoliticalHumor,fev5tce,t1_fesz2t7,1579393446.0,Alright. Vote for people that voted against the pretty unanimous trade bill just because they didn't want to be seen siding with Trump. All 12 blue counties can continue calling everyone else idiots for all I care.
Cringetopia,fev3rm5,t1_fetzed5,1579392776.0,Satire

nba,fep3de0,t1_feosk94,1579311225.0,Svp is rough. He always trying to be sick by talking about betting lines. It's so lame watching someone try so hard to be cool
politics,fennb80,t1_fen339u,1579288106.0,It's always a slow news day. We live in an era where tweets are the biggest event of the day. That's how cozy we have it as a country.
Cringetopia,femus1h,t3_epzgm9,1579270160.0,The clip with no laugh track needs to be put down here. https://youtu.be/jKS3MGriZcs
politics,femugdu,t1_femltk6,1579269912.0,You guys are upvote circle jerking long form ways of saying Trump is a douche?
politics,femu7c6,t3_epywt8,1579269711.0,"Jesus, you people are out of control. If you stopped and thought about it, you'd probably agree with most of his policy changes and his positions. The wall thing is silly, but his other moves have been solid. Do you disagree with the new trade deal? The only ones that didn't sign on were running for president. Stop with the blind platitudes for a second and actually analyze him as a president. He's not Hitler, his main focal points are the economy and international trade deals. Get a fucking grip."
gaming,femtgca,t1_femm833,1579269122.0,Fallout 4 sucked too lol
Cringetopia,felswcd,t1_felpmy0,1579230119.0,That's front page r/Pol standards.
Cringetopia,fekwa6d,t1_fejpezi,1579208918.0,The weird diaper furry stuff and that German chick pissing on PlayStations from a few weeks ago is the kind of shit this sub was made for. There's too much stuff that's not the right level.
