She *always* got out and went off exploring. Sometimes we'd have to go find her, sometimes she'd just wander back like it was nothing. 

Twice she got into a turkey farm a few miles way, the first time the farmer gave her a souvenir of buckshot in the ass. She was fine, couple pellets grazed her but no real harm. So naturally she went right back the next time she snuck out. Somehow she lived a long happy life despite her own best efforts."

Two of my favorite Post-Galaxy class designs aren't actually even canon but mods for the old Bridge Commander game.

My favorite though has always been [the Eclipse class](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/92/93/dd/9293dd50164fda3dae69d98069f97fbd.png) (this image has different nacelles than the actual mod did); a huge, beast of a ship that still managed to look graceful in motion.

You could have practically the same plot setup just by making Burnham a protege of Sarek for instance and avoid the whole ""estranged sibling"" trope all together.

startrek,ffgclvz,t1_ffe3avl,1579903260.0,Well Trek's never been good with continuity-- even when doing things that require it.

startrek,ffczrsd,t1_ffcin3a,1579810605.0,Hard to say. It may well tie in but it remains to be seen if a direct connection will be drawn. The slapdash continuity of the majority of Trek's cannon likely means there will be bits and pieces that could tie in but aren't directly referenced. I'd argue another of Data's episodes is more *directly* connected to Picard's premier episode but pointing out which one that is would be very spoilery. You'll know it once you watch the premiere.

startrek,ffcyymd,t1_ffa3kj4,1579810155.0,"Product of the time. Continuity was not a major thing in those days and TNG barely bothered with it. Most every episode featured a different writer who's primary goal was writing that one particular episode with only a distant concern with what other episodes were saying. Hell even most of the big two-part episodes in the franchise were written as a part I, which would air typically as a season break, and then only later  when they came off hiatus would they sit down and write Part II. It's why a lot of the Trek two-parters often feel a bit disjointed with plot setups that aren't really utilized. 

So you get one episode saying Picard is utterly fascinated with archeology to the point he nearly went into that field instead of Star Fleet, and another episode where his ship is conducting an archeological survey as the plot set-up and he's completely unaware it was happening until someone tells him. Likewise you get one episode saying Picard and Guinan have along, close relationship, but then if no other writer cares to pick up on that thread then it's just left forgotten."

One small thing that I really appreciated was how, in the introduction by the reporter, they reference Picards interest in history. It came up in TNG but since that show, due to the conventions of its era in TV, wasn't really concerned about continuity it was something that was often forgotten about. One of the big challenges of trying to bring Trek into the modern continuity-heavy era is that even though Trek seems ready-made to be a ""cinematic universe"" (so to speak)-- a lot of it is really incongruous with itself since it was written with little care for matching up. All the potential is there with 50 years worth of material to draw upon to create something cohesive.. this feels like the first time in a long time where an honest attempt might be made to do just that."
startrek,ffct9s3,t1_ffchgcq,1579806805.0,The choreography was very solid. I've never been averse to action in Trek.. it's just that Trek has very rarely done that action well (mostly due to budgetary restrictions on TV series in the eras they aired).

startrek,ffcs1np,t1_ffbt40o,1579806082.0,"Well it was Stewart that actually pushed for many of those scenes. He initially was thinking of leaving TNG because he wanted more action and it was at his prompting that the ridiculous buggy chase scene was added to Nemesis.

startrek,ffcrmby,t1_ffbtu9w,1579805830.0,"It's an interesting direction for Trek that hasn't been done so the experiment itself isn't a bad idea. But yeah they didn't execute it well; As I mentioned above this was part of the whole ""the show didn't know what it wanted to be"" thing that really hurt S1; They wanted Burnham to be the main character instead of having an ensemble (or a main trio as both ToS and TNG had) but then didn't seem to want to commit to that path, veering back into a more traditional Trek setup of having Captain/Bridge crew.

Result being everyone felt under utilized except Burnham while she herself often felt forced into situations her character didn't really fit- which very rapidly caused her presence to wear thin on the audience. It's kind of like how Voyager inadvertently made Tom Paris a savant in practically every field, from history to combat to piloting to battlefield triage to engineering, by inserting him into narrative situations that didn't call for his character. Neelix and Wesley Crusher are also comparisons that could be made.

Truthfully if the screen-time balance of S1 DSC had been more even and Burnham hadn't been so dominant I don't think the character would be nearly as divisive even if she was still written largely the same; Just without alsway shaving to be the center of attention."
startrek,ffcqley,t1_ffbm6pg,1579805178.0,Discovery pretty much shot itself in the foot from the get-go due to all the behind-the-scenes issues in the product of season one. Chief among them being disagreement over the direction of the series as a whole and season one very much showcases that; It's a show that really wasn't sure what it actually wanted to be. As such it just sort of stumbles through a serialized narrative feeling very haphazard rather than orchestrated. I feel like had there been more creative cohesion behind the camera of S1 DSC then the series would have turned out far better even if it still went with the same general story.

StarWars,feiuoji,t3_ep7fvb,1579147698.0,"Last Jedi set that up for Rey. Luke in TLJ is the first time on the big screen a good guy has commented on the hubris and failures of the Jedi Order and counsel and truly called them out on it. They should have run with the idea that ""It's time to let the Jedi die"" as the Jedi, just like Sith, are really a failed sect.

The Sith destroyed themselves through uncompromising pursuit of power so single minded it lead to them effectively eating themselves alive; The Rule of Two was really just a bandaid rather than a real solution as it meant the Sith would always be on the cusp of extinction (and indeed this is addressed as one of Banes descendants is said to have turned to the Light, destroying countless things of value that set the Bane line of Sith back considerably before he was killed). Though in truth you could argue the Rule of Two as set down by Bane (which to be fair is not currently cannon) was never really intended to be a solution to save the Sith, just a method of keeping it alive long enough to destroy the Jedi Order.

Conversely the Jedi Order crumbled from within due to it's uncompromising inflexibility. An inability to change, to grow and to accept new ideas lead to an increasingly detached Order that was ever more removed from the galaxy they saw themselves as guardians of. While most of the Jedi themselves had noble ideals; The Order as a whole is frequently portrayed as self-righteous and self-confident to the point of arrogance in their own judgement. How much of this is intended is likely debatable- The OT was very much a fairly straightforward Good vs Evil heroes journey fairytale and the Jedi are portrayed as effectively paragons of good. The Prequels muddy things both intentionally and with their poor execution, and much of the EU entries from the books to the games often show Jedi espousing highly questionable ""wisdom"" as fact in a manner that makes it obvious the writers *intended* the Jedi to be correct ( this just comes down to the writers obviously not being all-wise and knowing but trying to writer characters that are.. most of the time that kind of thing is just not going to stand up to scrutiny).

The interesting knock on effect of that however is, as the world of Star Wars was fleshed out post OT, we got a more nuanced take on the Jedi Order as not Paragons of Righteousness, but just humans (for lack of the better word) with a great deal of power and good intentions who were nonetheless not infallible (even if some authors and entries seemed to want to treat them that way). Many Jedi are shown having fallen to the Dark Side, some through giving into a lust for power, like Krell, while others fell through misguided attempts at what they thought was the right thing such as Anakin. The introduction of the concept of Dark Jedi; Jedi that have turned to the Dark Side but aren't Sith and often may even not be evil, strictly speaking, added a new wrinkle that shows the consequences of the Jedi Order's rigidity- many such Jedi being created through the Orders own draconian attempts at suppressing emotions and desires amongst its members. When you look at the whole of Star Wars cannon (and the EU was *never actually cannon* even before Disney, but can be added to this in general) the natural narrative path really should have been Luke realizing the time of the Jedi had passed. The Order had fallen and attempts to rebuild it had been disastrous.

His choice to exile himself from the galaxy, and thus remove the last of the Jedi from the galaxy, was a conclusion that it made a great deal of sense for his character to reach all things considered. He knew very little of the Jedi by the time of RotJ and was only in the subsequent decades he was able to travel the galaxy to learn of the old order. Given the tragic events that unfolded in the post Empire era both for the galaxy at large and for him and his friends/family personally, and his own disillusionment with the Jedi Counsel as he learned their non-romanticized true history; Him following in the footsteps of Obi Wan and Yoda before him and going into self-imposed exile was a mistake, but an understandable one. The narrative arc of TLJ for Luke shouldn't have been about him accepting that the Jedi were right all along and need to return, but that a new order of force users could be created without being doomed to repeat the Jedi's mistakes. It was time for something new and Rey should have been the one tasked with forging that new entity as the first force user of a new post Empire generation.

That's not to say however that you couldn't play some of these stories straight. I've always felt that you could do Batman with the Bat family (Dick, Tim, Barbara etc) as a generally straight action-drama series and it would work very well.

Flash has been stuck in complete development hell for years, it's starting to become the new Crow reboot in how often they tell us ""no it's really happening this time!"" only for it to fall apart again in a month. Also I believe the Cyborg film is just out and out dead at this point."

Couple that with this taking over the news cycle for a while and a tidy boost to the GoP's defense contracting donors and they pretty much got what they wanted out of this. It very much feels like a military strike was ordered, and lives were lost, explicitly for the sake of political theater. And it seems to have worked."

That's not a craft that's going to compare in any reasonable way to a purpose built fighter bomber. Dropping a pilot with no experience beyond civilian flight into the cockpit of an F-22 and then telling them to go jump directly into combat is not going to end well. We give it a pass because ""The Force"" is an intentionally soft, vague magic system and handwaves this away.

Even if you got a couple thousand more tickets bought through this, which seems highly questionable, that would barely be a drop in the bucket in terms of box office yet being caught would be a unprecedented scandle that would tarnish both companies for years. Seems likely any two bit PR firm would realize it'd be better just to toss whatever money this would take into more normal adverts instead.
