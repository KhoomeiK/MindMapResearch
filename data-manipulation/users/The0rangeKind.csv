but on the other hand this looks really cheap and for a comedy series there was literally no dialogue to get a feel for what to expect.  this reminds me of amateur director reels that does everything to hide their lack of content by having an ostentatious song play over a series of unrelated unremarkable shots.  
also got the feeling a seeious lack of necessary coverage (or the editor just doesn’t be know what to do)  seeing it continue to repeat the same shot of julia in the outfit.  if you’re gonna repeat the same shot at least edit it in such a way that it builds up to something like a punchline at the end of the montage or a payoff.  it just keeps repeating her shot like it’s going to have her say something but it doesn’t.

it matters what you look like yes (show effort in your appearance) but it’s proven time and time again that attractive women will sleep with ugly men as long as they exude some kind of value to them- it can be money, connections, a sense of wonder nobody else can do, and if course- just good old fashioned genetics too.  there’s ugly guys with broken teeth, scars and really awful hygiene that still gets girls because they are demonstrating some attractive qualities in other ways.
