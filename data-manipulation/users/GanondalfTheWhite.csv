Only throwing this out because it's a pet peeve of mine on this sub - it feels really slow-mo heavy.

Sometimes it feels like people posting demos of this camera (and I don't mean you specifically) don't realize it shoots normal speed too.

It's a lot harder to make full speed video look impressive, so it's something I always want to see more of in demos. And, generally speaking, it's what the majority of final products are going to need.

Still, really excellent work."

TwoXChromosomes,feyh39k,t1_fexhzrt,1579445464.0,"Empathy doesn't mean ""Automatically knowing the exact gravity of someone's else's emotions and experiences.""  I'm seeing a lot of people treat it that way in this thread, and it's frustrating.

People can *try* to wrap their heads around other people's mental space. But they're never going to be successful until they have enough parallel experiences of their own to bridge the gap.

Basically each of us has a puzzle that represents our entire life. Every experience we have is a piece of that puzzle.

When other people look at our puzzle, they can only ""see"" the pieces when they have similar pieces in their own puzzle. They can guess at what the full puzzle is, but they're not going to get close until there's enough overlap.

Trying to be empathetic with people for whom you have no experiential overlap is like trying to guess the entire phrase in Wheel of Fortune without any letters filled in yet. You need a few more letters before you can start making educated guesses."
TwoXChromosomes,feyesfg,t1_fey3ciu,1579444507.0,"The reality is that there is *always* going to be an experience gap between you, and me, and OP, and literally everyone else on Earth.

Most people, I think, try to imagine where other people are coming from. But that imagining can only ever be rooted in our own experiences. Which means that it is fundamentally limited.

We may think we're doing a good job of putting ourselves in those other shoes. But it's always going to be wrong in some ways.

You know when you have a lightbulb moment and you finally learn a new piece of information that helps a bunch of other things you've been struggling with click into place?

That's what this post is. OP *thought*, to the best of her ability, that she was weighting all the arguments appropriately. It wasn't until she experienced more of the sides first hand that she realized where her attempt at imagining the other side fell short.

None of us has all the pieces. Not ever. So I can't judge people for when they have their lightbulb moments and realize just how much they hadn't realized before."

The volcano kick is glorious. When you time it right, you get to witness the exact moment they realize they fucked up. Savor their screams as his leg builds towards its zenith, and watch then cower in the fear of their impending foot-shaped doom.

With lost wax, you make a positive copy from wax. Pack it in sand or plaster. Then put it in an oven/kiln, sometimes upside down. You melt out whatever will drain when liquid, and then burn out the rest. It burns out cleanly without any ash residue.

This leaves a hollow mold which you then fill with metal."
