The background is a plate of quartz (druzy?) that I found back at my secret spot in the bay. It’s about 5x10, I have a few of them. Not sure about the ashes, I think it’s just dust or dirt."

mildlyinfuriating,ffn25ll,t1_ffmpllj,1580061165.0,"My last name rhymes with macaroni, can confirm (both grandparents on both sides came over on a boat, and opened businesses in NY). My parents split, but in both houses, we have an off limits living or dining room with furniture that is too expensive to eat or be on. That is, save for once every few years when some of my parents old friends with mysterious pasts came around."

This is interesting, I’ll take a look. Hopefully this will help me get closer to identifying what’s in here. They are cherry red on the outside but translucent"
rockhounds,fffbxtb,t1_ffetly2,1579880585.0,"California Bay Area, private property. I have maybe 100-200 pounds of this stuff that’s sliceable, everything else is about the size of a US quarter.
