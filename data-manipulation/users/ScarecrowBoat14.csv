EDM,ffj8j47,t3_etxrx2,1579992989.0,IMO one of his most underrated tracks. Just love everything about it!
nfl,ffif1e7,t1_ffi3eht,1579972315.0,I'm convinced he could throw for 400 yards and 4 TDs in the Super Bowl and still won't get any credit.
hiphopheads,ffh0cjy,t1_ffg2zvs,1579919715.0,"Sunday Candy is legit one of my favorite songs ever, that hook is angelic."
TheoryOfReddit,ffey6ug,t1_ffdhatc,1579870130.0,He unintentionally just answered his own question by assuming we'd know that lol
30ROCK,ffexubt,t1_ffedch5,1579869788.0,Oh god I can hear this comment
OutOfTheLoop,ffciygr,t1_ffcc951,1579800461.0,I think they mean is this all some massive joke started by Twitter users or is Planters actually involved. In which case the later would be correct.
boomershumor,ffbuzpj,t1_ffbju23,1579783669.0,Don’t bother trying to tell Redditors to empathize with their fellow human beings it doesn’t work. If they can convince themselves homeless people are scum then they won’t feel bad completely ignoring them and treating them like animals.
coaxedintoasnafu,ffbsopa,t1_ffbmhdo,1579781288.0,I mean have you missed the videos of BLM protesters literally getting run over by cars and then getting blamed for being in the way.
coaxedintoasnafu,ffbsku8,t1_ffbocnx,1579781166.0,It’s almost as if the OP knows this but there are clearly general trends and opinions that permeate throughout Reddit so this condescending comment is completely unnecessary.
Negareddit,ff8ve19,t1_ff8ggb7,1579697386.0,"Exactly. Statistics and data and ""muh logic"" are utterly useless unless you have a background in learning how to think critically about them.

Running regressions and making pretty graphs takes like an hour of coding knowledge, asking the right questions and knowing how to answer them is the hardest part by far."
EnoughMuskSpam,ff8tvvv,t3_es9znl,1579695907.0,Has he been made the official mascot of /r/FellowKids yet? If not he needs to be.
circlebroke2,ff8szhw,t3_es8dae,1579694937.0,"I'm barely 25 and even now people who are 18-21 already feel crazy young. There's so much maturing around then that anyone younger just seems like a child. 

How do you date someone even close to that age as an older adult? The answer is you don't unless you're a creep."
coaxedintoasnafu,ff7r2et,t1_ff7chkd,1579656289.0,True but there are generally site-wide ideas/trends that you come across in most subreddits.
Fitness,ff5wibp,t3_ertr14,1579612599.0,Start small if you have to. Just go and literally walk on the treadmill for 5 minutes. The first step going is always the hardest that was my biggest struggle.

philosophy,ff5u19y,t1_ff5jymc,1579610222.0,Lol thanks my version kinda meant the opposite
hiphopheads,ff4mkdj,t1_ff4i695,1579567247.0,Agreed 100%. A forum dominated by young middle/upper class white guys is always gonna be trash at any kind of social justice even if the music they're discussing directly supports it constantly.

Foodforthought,ff233le,t1_ff1uo8o,1579492488.0,"You're missing the entire point of the impeachment. Let's say Biden is guilty and his son is corrupt. Trump still leveraged government aid in order to advance his private interests. *That* is the largest problem. 

In his dealings with Biden/Ukraine he was not acting in the interest of the people of the United States, he was abusing his political power for personal gain."
soccer,ff1gfrj,t1_ff10sul,1579478831.0,"Thank you for saying this. These guys aren't infallible superheroes, they're people just like us. So many toxic people online refuse to believe it."
Fitness,ff0yor4,t3_eqv1xr,1579473577.0,"I disagree with most of these statements, if you're a casual lifter I say get rid of the squats for RDL/splits. No sense going to the gym and hating it."
nfl,fezkj46,t1_fezjmys,1579458275.0,"I mean there are literally millions of people who disagree with that. I personally don't watch it all, but it clearly isn't targeted at me or the larger Reddit demographic as a whole. My point is there is no absolute dichotomy of funny/not funny"
soccer,fezhb12,t1_fezb3kh,1579457349.0,Yeah De Gea's appeal had nothing to do with it. The commentator was just pointing out that the VAR decision aligned with De Gea's argument that he was fouled.
nfl,fezewuz,t1_feyna8n,1579456610.0,Oh boy that first time back is always something special lmao soreness for dayyysss
nfl,fezeay9,t1_feyr21w,1579456481.0,You will never get a serious answer from Reddit because the hate boner for anything that popular is through the roof.
nfl,fezdtfi,t1_fez5oce,1579456311.0,Still not confident in the Titans for some reason even though I've been rooting like hell for them these playoffs. Like it seems to good to be true so I can't get myself excited for them lol
hiphopheads,fezbfku,t1_fezae9q,1579455678.0,Love when people comment asking questions that were directly answered in the article lmao
Fitness,fezaa76,t1_feyba73,1579455287.0,It's amazing to me how many people are brushing off 200 calories a day like that's not a massive difference lol glad to see some sanity
MrRobot,few5218,t1_fesh35b,1579405491.0,"I agree with your last two points especially. The writing with Elliot and his split personalities was all masterfully done, but in the end it really did just boil down to being all in his head. Which means that all that crazy shit with Whiterose and the machine was real, but had no actual relationship to Elliot's personal journey (other than thematically obviously).

I guess I was hoping that WR and her machine, and Elliot with his different worlds would be apart of the same reveal/mystery but it turned out they had no tangible relationship."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fev680s,t3_eqkfwt,1579393529.0,Don't really understand this trend of equating *human children* to literal animals
hiphopheads,feta86c,t1_ferwnq7,1579373243.0,"Such a small part but you can tell he's comfortable on screen (for obvious reasons). Love seeing rappers in movies/TV, like Joey Bada$$ in Mr. Robot."
hiphopheads,fet8jet,t1_fet6y93,1579372764.0,Not really? Coachella isn't a festival based on celebrating woman abusers.
nfl,fet2ab3,t1_fesv4sx,1579371167.0,Well yeah it's literally impossible to have an objective award. All Pro still holds much more esteem than Pro-Bowl.
nfl,fet21r7,t1_fesrfqp,1579371088.0,In a sense yeah but they aren't remotely equivalent.
Foodforthought,fesywqj,t1_ferzyjw,1579370294.0,I get the larger point but what the hell does a blowjob have to do with anything?

nfl,fepj38h,t1_fepijhc,1579321799.0,"No matter how well the Cowboys are doing it seems whenever Jason Garrett gets shown on the broadcast he's always clapping/cheering the team on.

So it just became a meme that clapping is the only thing Garrett actually did at the Cowboys. Like any meme it got blown out of proportion and was never that funny to begin with lol"
nfl,fep6szd,t1_fep1u2f,1579313425.0,And Reddit! Like 90% of these comments are clapping memes

EnoughMuskSpam,fcxgtu2,t1_fcwy8v3,1578062568.0,"Thank you! This mindset is so bothering to me. Elon Musk is the head of an extremely effective PR machine bordering on propaganda, that shit can affect anyone regardless of intelligence level.
