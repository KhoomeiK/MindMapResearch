depression_memes,ffh542o,t3_etl1of,1579923364.0,"Naw, see, it's all media's fault. You see so much death and destruction in movies and TV and you become so desensitized to it all that the separation between fantasy and reality deteriorates and the situation will eventually merit the same response in real life as it does in the movies and TV shows, and constant exposure changes what would be a horrific scene into ""something you've seen dozens of times,"" dismissing it as a comparably ""normal"" occurrence.

Many years ago in highschool,I was party of a marching band. We are one point were invited to a band competition in another state and at some point while we were they we were provided boxed meals from Chick-fil-A. Chicken sandwich with pickles, a drink and some side. Wasn't impressed.

Flash forward to after we got back, a day later at after school practice. Less than half the band was there because apparently those boxed lunches gave all the others some kind of food poisoning. Had to cancel the practice that day as a result.
