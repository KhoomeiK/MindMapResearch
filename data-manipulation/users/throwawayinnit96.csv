AMA,ff3zi0l,t3_ere8pq,1579552254.0,"My mother hit me, but never â€˜beat meâ€™ as such. She would punch me on the arms and legs, but never enough to actively endanger me, just hurt me. Because of this, when I called the police they didnâ€™t give a toss and I had to escape into poverty at 17. Do you hate your mother? Do you think about revenge?"
AMA,ff2mjqw,t1_ff2lhv7,1579513387.0,"I think the point Iâ€™m trying to make is that you donâ€™t know why someone turned to drugs, but most people have a reason. You canâ€™t know everything"
AMA,ff2lbhi,t1_ff17abi,1579511512.0,"Thatâ€™s so interesting, because in my neck of the woods I see trauma everywhere. Iâ€™m lucky to have not developed an addiction myself after I turned to drugs when leaving my abusive home for squalor. I canâ€™t really envision someone throwing away a good life just because, but maybe thatâ€™s bias talking"
AMA,fezep0f,t1_fexu8yi,1579456551.0,Do you not see people who have addictions because of their illness? Imo trauma is the gateway drug
unitedkingdom,fevf02g,t3_eqe5s1,1579396615.0,Who let these fucking stupid cunts rule a nation. Oh yes ... other stupid cunts.

AMA,fe5i5cb,t3_enq5nb,1578869756.0,I think my mother is lying about having this disorder. How do you think you would be able to tell if someone was lying about it?
unitedkingdom,fdrg03r,t1_fdrcrtd,1578684020.0,"Wow, OK, so youâ€™re just retarded. Good for you that your IAPT waiting list is weeks - mine is a year; which I have already explained. Itâ€™s a hospital that offers outpatient treatment - that is what I was referred for. Not everyone can safely take these medications. Donâ€™t complain if a mentally ill person shoots you in the face one day ... youâ€™ve fucking asked for it mate."
unitedkingdom,fdrfr50,t1_fdrd3mw,1578683916.0,"Thatâ€™s all well and good if you can afford insurance and private care, I barely afford my existence. There are no real facilities that will actually provide the care you need without the waiting list Iâ€™ve described."
unitedkingdom,fdrbzmw,t1_fdrbm2q,1578682346.0,"Well, thatâ€™s what they say. I was referred by a nurse to a mental health hospital for outpatient treatment who said I donâ€™t require their services, and Iâ€™ve been shunted on a IAPT waiting list for 1 year with no interim support. For context, I have clear symptoms of OCD, depression, probably CPTSD from childhood abuse, I have homocidal ideations and I hallucinate."
unitedkingdom,fdraz3s,t1_fdq2sgo,1578681952.0,"Hello. I was bulimic as a teen, I was abused for ten plus years, and I now have OCD, depression, homocidal ideation. I also hallucinate. I was turned away from outpatient appointments at a local mental health hospital who stated I didnâ€™t require their services nor any interim support, and instead I must wait on an IAPT service waiting list which is one year long."
unitedkingdom,fdraop7,t1_fdqzm9z,1578681790.0,They just say that youâ€™re not sick enough for their services.
unitedkingdom,fdran42,t3_emn1iz,1578681763.0,How the fuck is anyone surprised by this. Utter stupidity.

unitedkingdom,fdmz41w,t1_fdmxz1q,1578572047.0,"Life is not a constant cycle of expected bills and fuck all else month after month. Stuff crops up. Emergencies happen. Incomes fluctuate. People get sick. Dental problems emerge. Debts rear their head. Vulnerabilities exist that, surprisingly enough, people do not actively choose.

*Poor people, especially people in receipt of benefits, do not have savings*. So when they have unexpected circumstances crop up they have to decide to cut out one essential or another, or if they donâ€™t have any money due to monthly payment cycles, they cannot act at all and they or their kids go without. Itâ€™s not like you, where you can just make a decision not to buy your kid another posh bag.

And yes, I know geniuses like yourself will say â€˜donâ€™t get into debt lolâ€™, but I direct you back to my second reply for an answer to that."

unitedkingdom,fdmxiy4,t1_fdmx76h,1578570262.0,"This might be a shock to you, but itâ€™s difficult to manage something when thereâ€™s fuck all of it."
unitedkingdom,fdmx6rm,t1_fdmwva8,1578569858.0,At some point you have to realise that wasting energy on a person is a waste of time. This is clearly one of those times.

unitedkingdom,fdmvx60,t1_fdmvnu9,1578568294.0,"So basically we shouldnâ€™t have smaller economies. Very viable. Itâ€™s clearly big brain time.

I get that youâ€™re a Tory prick, really I do, but do you have to assume everything you write with it? Iâ€™ve never claimed a penny off the taxpayer ... I am a taxpayer. I also donâ€™t live within 100 miles of any of the cities you described.

And frankly, I know the concept of improving a society to make it vaguely decent without people having to completely upheave their existences and leave the people they love and a support network is not comprehendable to you, but not everyone else enjoys the taste of rich boot."

unitedkingdom,fdmvgf7,t1_fdmvasa,1578567689.0,Look at the handles of who youâ€™re replying to.
unitedkingdom,fdmvap8,t1_fdmu5lb,1578567477.0,We leave the EU this month. I would imagine itâ€™s effective from then but Iâ€™m not sure.
unitedkingdom,fdmuvbg,t1_fdmuo2e,1578566904.0,Itâ€™s interesting that you think the solution to â€˜large swathes of the country donâ€™t have work that you can actually live onâ€™ is â€˜then move lolâ€™ rather than â€˜oh shit if we donâ€™t improve the country then even more people will be competing with me for the same amount of jobsâ€™
unitedkingdom,fdmurzj,t1_fdmuo2e,1578566782.0,"And just never see my family or friends? Cool cool cool. Iâ€™ll just magic the money to move 100-500 miles away from somewhere in the sky.

You do realise if everyone was able to do this your cities would be absolutely rammed, and you wouldnâ€™t be able to get the good jobs on trees?"
unitedkingdom,fdmunxd,t1_fdmqj05,1578566631.0,Have you tried not being a socially incompetent arsehole?
unitedkingdom,fdmuk9c,t1_fdmjz30,1578566490.0,You should see *how* they survive mate. Itâ€™s pitiful.
unitedkingdom,fdmuj47,t1_fdmryny,1578566446.0,And I suppose if you have chronic health conditions and/or have family you donâ€™t want to leave you can just go fuck yourself?

unitedkingdom,fdmucfb,t1_fdmrdt3,1578566187.0,"A a a. Lies. I live in a northern constituency (one that just turned blue) and I have watched the situation worsen over the years, if that was even possible. The only jobs that are actually posted on a semi regular basis are care work, 8/16 hour contracts and call centre rubbish."
unitedkingdom,fdmu3jq,t1_fdml2zg,1578565846.0,"Nah, couldnâ€™t possibly be that tons of people disagree with you genuinely. Must just be that evil Labour cult all collaborating on downvotes to wound your ego, or something. Being a victim is so fun. We love living in poverty!"
unitedkingdom,fdmttyl,t1_fdmsat7,1578565485.0,"I earn a low wage, and I donâ€™t go out really. I have maybe had 2/3 nights out a year since I was 18 and Iâ€™m now 23. When I did go out I canâ€™t envision a spend of anything over Â£60 and usually it was less. Predrinking is the done thing. I still have literally no money."

offmychest,fdlv5wg,t3_elxt3x,1578533240.0,I literally canâ€™t bring myself to read this comment section because as a young angry girl I know it will send my blood pressure through the roof but I just wanted to give you my support.

HPPD,fcx2yr3,t1_fcoid44,1578048929.0,Thank you. Have you used it safely/with good results?
HPPD,fcx2x6z,t1_fcowba7,1578048871.0,All SSRIs will mess you up but this particular one was citalopram.
AMA,fcopnqd,t1_fcoop0j,1577838246.0,Itâ€™s obvious. Theyâ€™re more disturbances than actual hallucinations.
AMA,fcopm1t,t1_fcoor78,1577838212.0,"Iâ€™ve had it for 5 years dude, Iâ€™ve done my research years ago. Look up HPPD."

AMA,fcokrvc,t1_fcokmvj,1577834716.0,I also wanna raise awareness because basically no one in the mainstream knows this is a thing
AMA,fcokq24,t1_fcokmvj,1577834680.0,There are various other things to discuss other than the specific nature of my hallucinations
AMA,fcokgw1,t1_fcok0wc,1577834495.0,"I was trying to escape, thatâ€™s the worst part. Hopefully Iâ€™ll keep making my way out of the woods."
AMA,fcokeys,t1_fcok372,1577834456.0,"I donâ€™t think so. Looking at the criteria for HPPD and schizophrenia, I fit HPPD well and donâ€™t really sound like the descriptor for schizophrenia. My hallucinations are different from the type youâ€™d get with schizophrenia also"
AMA,fcojw84,t1_fcohpjl,1577834077.0,"I hate dangerous drivers, drink drivers etc. I wouldnâ€™t want to be the architect of anyone elseâ€™s pain"
AMA,fcojtqp,t1_fcojlq0,1577834027.0,"I took some really dodgy pills that were marketed as Es but definitely werenâ€™t. I honestly have no idea what they contained but it wasnâ€™t good. However, I believe the full on onset was actually triggered by my history of this + antidepressants + stress. Iâ€™m one of the only delayed cases Iâ€™ve heard of"
AMA,fcojhgs,t1_fcoj8e8,1577833772.0,It took me a few weeks. It started with something just feeling â€˜offâ€™ which bothered me hugely. (This was derealisation). At one point I went to the optician and tried to get them to change my lenses as if that was the problem. Then everything started unfolding. It reaches a point where you know itâ€™s not normal and not what everyone else has happen.
AMA,fcojcee,t1_fcoiihb,1577833666.0,"Yes, absolutely. I had and have complex trauma from childhood abuse. I was almost definitely depressed. Since the onset, I have also developed anxiety problems and obsessive compulsive disorder. I cut myself as a teenager for attention because I was desperate for someone to see the pain, care about it and help me."
AMA,fcoj4co,t1_fcoiqiv,1577833500.0,Yup ðŸ˜Ÿ
AMA,fcoj391,t1_fcoir1x,1577833478.0,"I think the most accurate way to describe them would be â€˜disturbancesâ€™. The way I process visual information is affected so I see visual snow, colour that doesnâ€™t exist, shapes etc. I try not to describe it too much because I know when I had first started suffering reading peopleâ€™s symptoms scared the shit out of me."
AMA,fcoiymn,t1_fcoh9do,1577833382.0,"Not that Iâ€™m aware of. I went into recovery for a few years and honesty I usually forgot that it even existed, my symptoms were largely reduced (though still present, I just had to look for them) and I no longer experienced any distress due to them. This to me felt like being fully recovered. Unfortunately I have relapsed due to trying an anti depressant but because I know I have handled it before, I know I can handle it again. I also have OCD and OCD is by far the scarier foe."
AMA,fcogpq6,t1_fcodc8g,1577831813.0,"I did take driving lessons last year when I felt myself recovered but I feel like I have relapsed now and would not consider driving at this time because of it, I think itâ€™s just irresponsible"
HPPD,fcogcx2,t1_fcofqpz,1577831568.0,"See this I find interesting because last time, I recovered, pretty much, while still drinking alcohol. It was drugs I had to avoid like the plague."

HPPD,fcoeuy6,t3_egnv69,1577830539.0,Alcohol does not affect my HPPD and never has ... I recovered while drinking.
HPPD,fcoesk1,t1_fcmbbwb,1577830493.0,Is this an SSRI?
HPPD,fcoeqlj,t3_ehy6il,1577830454.0,Donâ€™t take an SSRI I beg you - I had been in remission for a good 3 and a half years and boom.
AMA,fcoemkq,t1_fcoe3r8,1577830376.0,"I struggle to focus on reading or writing which sucks. When itâ€™s bad I struggle to do anything other than stare at my phone screen up close to my face. I deal with huge amounts of fear and am often scared to look around. Itâ€™s first onset was 5 years ago, and it broke my heart that I could not properly look at the sky any more and enjoy it."
AMA,fcoejjl,t1_fcoe4lj,1577830315.0,"The recommended treatment for the condition is American stuff like Keppra, Lamictal. I am in the UK where basically no one knows about it and also Iâ€™m just plain scared of trying stuff. Antidepressants make it worse."
HPPD,fcoe6pe,t3_ei2xfa,1577830065.0,The trauma of HPPD was one of the catalysts of me developing obsessive compulsive disorder. OCD is not just about cleaning it can be about ANYTHING and centres around intrusive thoughts. Look into it.
HPPD,fcoe4tg,t3_ei21fa,1577830028.0,Visuals do reduce. I got HPPD in 2014 and by summer 2015 I was living a functional life. Just take care and try not to take anti depressants.
AMA,fcoe1kg,t1_fcodezf,1577829963.0,"I believe it was definitely the drugs because I know I was taking risks with what I was taking, and since my onset 5 years ago I discovered that other people are suffering, and itâ€™s a recognised disorder called HPPD."
AMA,fcodmc4,t1_fcodgvk,1577829663.0,I donâ€™t see anything interesting as such - more disturbances. I struggle to talk about this in depth because I donâ€™t want to trigger myself and other suspectible drug users.
AMA,fcodjmo,t1_fcodc8g,1577829609.0,I donâ€™t drive.
AMA,fcodi2s,t1_fcodezf,1577829577.0,I first got hit with this in 2014. Within a year and a half I reached a point where the symptoms settled to a point where it no longer bothered me mental health wise; even though certain things were still there. I have recently had a resurgence of symptoms due to attempting to go on antidepressants. I had been taking drugs on and off (every month or two) for about a year and a half before it occurred
AMA,fcodezc,t1_fcod8n8,1577829515.0,"No, Iâ€™ve never tried that in my life. I believe it was a combination of dodgy pills that were supposed to be E: but probs full of shit and antidepressants."
