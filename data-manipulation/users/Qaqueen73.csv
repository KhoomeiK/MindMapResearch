AmItheAsshole,fdq3mx9,t1_fdppdfz,1578653257.0,"Ok the thought of a man going into a lingerie store being a sign of a good bother or son made me cringe... As my husband would say ""There's a genre for that""."

bipolar,fcnnktu,t1_fcnk4k5,1577814883.0,"Ya it sucked... Because I was taking my meds I thought I was fine. I know I am bipolar when I am not manic but when I go manic everyone else has issues and I'm mentally fine (But I think I have a really bad physical illness). My case spiralled out of control. 

My husband tried to have me committed 3 times and each time I was let go even when the psychiatrist said I was the worst case of mania she had ever seen. 

Then my time in jail was a complete freaking disaster. Solitary confinement is fucking torture. The lights were on 24 hours a day, there was no natural light (or clocks I could see) so I didn't know what time it was or even how many days had passed, and the noise was maddening. People were yelling and screaming all hours of the day and night but you could VERY CLEARLY hear people talking in the cells around you. I was having hallucinations at the time and thought God was talking to me. They took my glasses because I was a suicide risk so I couldn't see a damn thing except shapes which really f'd with my mind. I had my clothes taken too because I kept flooding my cell by shoving my jumpsuit into the toilet and flushing constantly to drown out the noise.

The good news is all of this probably wouldn't happen again now. Our country has started a mental health diversion program to help keep people out of jail. There are so many places where the system failed me that now I would get help."
bipolar,fcnctfy,t1_fcnbx1m,1577808955.0,"I'm kinda like that too. But I know I romanticize being manic too... it's not nearly as great as it feels at the time. And it is hell for those around you.

My last one was a fucking disaster. I ended up getting arrested for assaulting my (ex)husband,  was placed in solitary confinement, attempted to commit suicide, was declared incompetent to stand trial, spent 45 days in a state mental hospital, plead guilty to assault and was given a 2 year deferred sentence where I had to do what my psych said (I WAS doing that... my meds stopped working). 

I've been stable for almost 10 years and have really changed my life. I've become a big mental health advocate, left my ex, gotten remarried, had another child (with the ex). But I am soooo depressed. I am getting my affairs in order now (Will, special needs trust for my daughter, trust for my son) and trying to figure out how to make suicide NOT look like a suicide so my kids can get SSDI because I am just fucking DONE!"
MomForAMinute,fcm0iqe,t3_ehsg4q,1577761059.0,What a beautiful baby girl. I am so sorry your mom can't tell you how happy she is for you right now. My mom passed before I had my daughter and there are so many times I wish she could have been there. Having someone who looks like your mom (but is not the woman who was there by your side during your struggles) say those things must be heart breaking. I am sure she wishes she understood too.
mydarkestsecret,fclyzbb,t1_fclwg8b,1577759937.0,"Friend for 28 years or porn bucket list... I mean she IS legal and we all know 18 year old females are sooooooo much more mature so it's kinda like she's at least 21.  
As a former 18 year old hypersexual undiagnosed bipolar female who was screwing one of my father's graduate students I look back and wonder what the fuck was he thinking. Now I know... Porn bucket list."

tattoos,fckr9uh,t3_egqn5p,1577731479.0,"**Looking for a very special tattoo artist for a very special person in the Washington DC area.**

My special needs daughter is turning 18 in February. She is intellectually disabled and for YEARS all she has talked about is being able to get a tattoo on her 18th birthday. Her father, step father and I all have tattoos and she even sat with me though a foot tattoo so she knows what is involved. 

I have promised to take her to get mother daughter tattoos on her birthday (2/13) but I would really like to find someone who has experience with special needs clients/family and someone who might be jumpy/anxious (Ok mthat is probably everyone....) . She says she wants her sister's name tattooed on her arm but I would love to talk her out of that. Whatever it is it would be small. 

We are getting guardianship of her when she turns 18 and it looks like even though we wanted her to retain her right to vote they will probably remove that too. This tattoo might be the only ""right of passage"" she will get to experience when she turns 18."
