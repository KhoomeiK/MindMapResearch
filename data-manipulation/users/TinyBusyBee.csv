From my understanding, you are asking if you add your 2 credit and go to 15 credits, if your financial aid package will change. At GMU, with 13 credits, you are considered full-time. Thus your financial aid package currently reflects the status. So if you add 2 credits, you will be at 15, still a full time student. So your financial aid package will not change since your status did not.

Let's say you go down to 11 credits. You would then be a part time student. In this case, you would get less financial aid."

My SO has the same issue. 

>he tries (always unsuccessfully) to stop

My SO also has a difficult time with it. He has gone to allergist, physician, the whole 9 yards and they still dont know why. Has your husband gone to an allergist for it? I know my SO tries to do it quietly but it is really uncomfortable for him. Obviously if he is in a professional environment then he tries to keep it subtle. But it seems like he cant help it

Instead of making a game out of it, I try to make it a point to make him more comfortable. I'm sure your husband is self-conscious about it without you knowing and now you've brought your kids into it. Its humiliating. I have a constant cough and its embarrassing for people to constantly make fun of me. It hurts and I'm sure making a game out of his misery hurt him more than you know.

What I do for my SO is I say ""bless you"". His comfort is worth more than me hearing him hack. 

My suggestion is to go to an allergist."

It's not your fault for the situation. Your in-laws crossed the line that should have never been crossed. 

Nevertheless, it was. But your daughter loves this dog now. She's had such a hard time at school and this pet is finally one that she can cuddle with when she is upset, chill with in her room, play with.

Dogs are incredibly helpful and it would help her significantly. But you rip this away from her, it will break her. She is 12 and this will hurt her for years and years to come. She will never completely forgive you and that comes from my own experience. Do NOT do this to your daughter. Please, I beg you OP. Dont do what my mother did to me. I have never forgiven her. She tore a hole in my heart and you will do the same to your daughter. I cannot say this enough. 

Sit down with your daughter and be happy for her. Let this be a teaching moment. Of care, of responsibility, of love. Give her a schedule. Make it her responsibility. Tell her what the dog will need. This will be such a beautiful time for your child to truly grow before your eyes. Maybe you will even find a soft spot for the dog. 

But please, please, do not give the dog back."

Same experience as the top comment- I got really sick off rum and it was really bad, I was in no shape to do anything. My boyfriend knew how bad it was. 

So this man- God bless his heart- tells me he's going to make me puke. I'm very, very drunk so I needed this out of my system. He takes his fingers and sticks them to the back of my throat to make me puke because I am too drunk to do it myself. Versus your story, my chunky vomit ended up all over his toilet and fingers. He took it like a champ, held my hair back with the one clean hand and when he got the chance, got up and washed his hands *thoroughly*. He grabbed me water and sent me to bed, nursing me the next day. 

I can tell you if I puked in his bed that night, he would have sent me to the couch and told me it was absolutely okay and cleaned it. 

Now the rum was my idiotic idea- getting sick is not a choice. And he made you clean it up sick, made you feel horrendous and acted like a child the entire time. Please break up with him. And tell him exactly why. This is ridiculous.
