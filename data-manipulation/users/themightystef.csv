I can't find a source right now but one of my professors told me about. Think its called dendrochronology if I remember correctly.

TerraTech,ff8nmjx,t1_ff7n4l3,1579687627.0,"There's a big difference between resource collectors and resource receivers. A *collector* picks resources up from the ground so you can carry them to your base and then a *receiver* takes them off the collector. In other words, a collector is best used on your mobile tech, whereas a receiver is best used to remove chunks from your mobile tech and funnel them into your manufacturing system or a trading station.


A collector is meant to both pick up and give off chunks(to receivers, such as the one on trading stations)

A receiver is meant to receive *only*, meaning another receiver on i.e. a trading station will nog be able to take chunks off of it"
