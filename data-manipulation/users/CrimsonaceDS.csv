SuicideWatch,fgqnxsg,t1_fgqndsi,1581027853.0,"Ok, I don’t have very good knowledge about this type of stuff, so take everything I say with a grain of salt, but I suggest still talking to your therapist about how the things they do don’t help. If there is anything, anything at all that makes you feel even a little happy, hang onto that. If it’s a hobby, a place you like to visit, try to let that bring your mood up. If you are in any toxic relationships, get out of it as soon as possible. I’m not gonna give you the fake ass “it will all be better soon” because for some, it does get better with more therapy, but honestly, it’s not guaranteed. Try your best not to give up yet. If you feel comfortable talking to anyone, do it. Communication is good. Stay safe."

As much as you don’t want to, you need to at least talk to someone about this. Once you do that, you can hopefully feel a little better, but I’m not guaranteeing it."
