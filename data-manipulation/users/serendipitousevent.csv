Where in that series of events does the bar breach its duty of care towards OP? It's unlikely to be serving the drink itself - flaming drinks are served up and down the country, and all over the world.

The issue would be gaining ownership of the capital and then handing it off in order to receive benefits again. This isn't what's being proposed.

Rejecting an inheritance would mean that share goes back into the estate - but ensuring the Aunt's share is actually distributed to the grandchild would be unenforceable. In effect, the Aunt would never really 'touch' the funds.

Since the aunt never gains control of the capital in this situation (indeed, she's explicitly rejecting control), she cannot be regarded as manipulating her financial position.
