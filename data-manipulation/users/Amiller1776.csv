Edit* If you do come out here, and if you dont have any weird dietary restrictions, go to Nick Tahoe's and get a garbage plate. Its like the one good thing in all of Rochester.

If you're not used to snow, you're gonna hate it, unless you get into winter sports like snowboarding or skiing. Even then you's be better off elsewhere besides fucking Rochester. Lol 

U of R is a good school, but I never would have thought it would stand alongside some of the others you mentioned.

As for your course load - take what you want. Drop what you must. You can usually switch from AP to standard midway through.

Id pick dance or karate, but certainly not both with your schedule.

If you're going into a STEM field, why are you bothering with AP humanities classes like english lit, government, and econ? Its great if they offer college credit and help you graduate early. But if you have to move down to standard classes for anything, I'd pick one of those."

In college there's a social group for anyone and everyone. You just need to find it, or be visible enough for it to find you.

I always felt like no one liked the things I did. Nerdy things like fantasy books/movies, or unpopular things like heavy metal. But the thing is you have to be honest about who you are and who you want to soend your time with. If your a sports guy you'll find literally hundreds of people to chill with on your first day.

A studious book worm? Get a room on the academic hall, and keep your door open. The right kind of people will just walk in.

A partier? Literally just ask to go to a party. So many desperate kids want to be known for throwing kick ass parties, and will have an open invite to anyone and everyone because they just want the head count to be good. (I didnt start partying until my senior year and boy do I regret waiting that long).

Nerd like me? There will be game clubs and movie nights.

Just get involved. Dont back down from oportunities. Watch the movie ""yes man"" and take the lesson to heart.

And always use a condom. Colleges are a breeding ground for STD's. All it takes is one girl pulling a train at a frat party and suddenly everyone's got the worst kind of party favor. Thats the only upside of me being unpopular for so long. Didnt have a ton of oportunities to catch any thing. Lol

Edit:

Every other drink should be water. Always sleep on your side if you've been drinking. If someone passes out, prop them on their side with a pillow to avoid the possibility of choking on their own vomit.

People who do coke at parties arent fun when you start to sober up. They'll get progressively more anoying as the night goes on. Stay away from them.

People who do LSD at parties need a babysitter and will wrwck your night. Stay further away from them. Lol.

People who sprint when they are drunk are not worth chasing. If a car hits them its their own damn fault.

Food is always better at 3:00am.

You might not get hangovers now, but thats because you're young and your liver is still strong. Appreciate the super power of drinking all night and still being able to get up for work or class the next day while you still have it. That shit fades around the time you turn 25/26."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fenyes1,t1_fent8rk,1579292609.0,"I could see, to some extent, how there might be some confusion. It does seem like straight men have a proclivity for underage girls. Bear in mind that atraction to minors does not make one a ""pedophile"" if the minor has hit puberty.

A person who is attracted to someone who has hit puberty and developed secondary sexual characteristics, but has not yet attained the legal age of consent in their jurisdiction is called hebophile.

For instance. The legal age of consent in some states of the US is 16. In others it is 18. So a 22 year old man who has sex with a 16 year old girl in New York would be a sex offender, and a hebophile. But in [edit: Pennsylvania], he'd only be a douche bag.

Most straight men are attracted to physically developed, sexually mature women, regardless of their actual age. In many jurisdictions, that is illegal.

But thats not the same thing as being a pedophile. When it comes to sexual attraction to prepubescent children, the correlation between that and homosexuality is strong. Its not 1:1, but its much higher than it is for heterosexuality."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fenwkkg,t1_fent8rk,1579291938.0,">It is not a fact that the majority of pedophiles are gay.

Thats not what I said. Thats how you interpreted what I said. I said the % pedophiles in the straight population is lower than the % in the gay population.

The simple majority, which you seem to be refering to, is still straight. But thats because straight people outnumber gay people many times over.

So if you take 1,000 non pedophiles, and 1,000 pedophiles, and count the homosexuals in each group, there will be more homosexuals on average in the pedophile group than in the non pedophile group.

However, if you just count the total number of pedophiles and split them into heterosexual and homosexual, you will find that the heterosexual group is larger.

TrueOffMyChest,fei1011,t3_ep8nh9,1579127930.0,"This might be exactly as you described it. But allow me to present an alternative interpretation. Your ex is kind of a douch. His friends probably are to an extent as well. But being a douche doesn't mean he didn't love you.

Maybe he loved you in an unhealthy, toxic, posessive kind of way. But getting dumped is still going to hurt, regardless of how bad he was.

Next consider that his friends probably see you as the bad guy in this, being that they are likely douchy themselves. You said yourself you never told them how he treated you. And who knows, maybe if you did it wouldnt matter to them. They accept him gor who he is and likely expect you to do the same.

Now. Suppose his friends did like you while you were together. That was before you (maybe) broke your ex's heart. Now they have a reasom to hate you. And people who suddenly have a reasom to change their mind about someone are inclined to trick themselves into thinking they always felt that way.

I've seen it many times before. A friend dates a girl. We all love her. They break up and suddenly ""she always was kind of a bitch though, right?"" 

Part of it is anger at the effect it has on your ex. Part of it is wanting to make him feel better by convincing him hes too good for you any way. And part of it is mental gymnastics people do to maintain cognitive consistency.

My best friend got divorced a while back and I was FURIOUS with his ex. And I was one of the folks trying to get them to hook up back in the first place. I absolutely loved hanging out with them together, and thought she was great for him. Then she broke his heart. You can bet your ass I unfriended her immediately, and haven't had a nice thing to say about her since.

Also, why would you expect to be in their group chat? Wouldnt that be awkward as fuck for your bf and you? No one wants that drama.

Another also, a group of guys cant keep ypu around because there's always the risk of the ""Wtf are you doing hitting on my ex"" fight. Maybe he thinks you two will get back together. Maybe 1 or more of his friends thinks you're hot and might be interested. Good friends keep their distance in those situations to avoid totally shattering the group.

And even if he doesnt expect you to take him back, the idea of seeing you and talking to you on a regular basis, when he may still love you, is going to be painful as fuck. Good friends dont do that to eachother.

Neither seems condusive for growth and development into adulthood. Both if those options, and your description of your mental health, suggest a life of poverty and debt even if you dont take out any loans.

Hitler didn't start out going ""hey guys. Lets kill MILLIONS of innocent people!"" He started out like Bernie.

Does that mean Bernie is evil? No. I actually totally believe hes a good man with good intentions. But his policies are prerequisites that must be met for a totolitarian fascist regime to take hold.

So even if he keeps all his promises, we still have to worry about his successor and every one that folllows from that point forward.

Thats why socialism is not ok. Its not inherently evil. But it is a necessary stepping stone for the level of mass tragedies that took place in the 20th century to occure. And honestly, I for one would just rather not go down that road. Its a gamble I'm not willing to make."

Rip karma. I hardly knew yee. Ok. Ready for the down votes... lets go.

What the actual fuck? Don't quit a job over a mental break down. Keep going back until they fire you. I get it. You have some kind of anxiety or depression or both. Take a number.

Those aren't excuses to not work.

""But mental illnesses are real illnesses just like being sick or injured, and you wouldn't work then!"" Bull shit.

Not to the real illness part. I get that. But unless you are like full on schizophrenic or something really major, you go to work, be miserable for 8 hours, and go home.

Eventually you gather enough income to be in a less toxic home invironment. That step up would probably make work itself much more tolerable.

Also your reliable work experience helps you get better jobs that dont make you feel quite so shitty.

Know whats going to keep you dependent on ass holes you whole life? Quiting a job because you had a breakdown. Have your breakdown. Tepl your boss what your issues are. And if they fire you, collect disability. But dont fucking quit. NEVER fucking quit.

If you can physically do the work, and you're not scaring customers away, I'd eveb say don't even go home early. I've broken 5 fingers at work (in 3 separate incidents) and not once did I leave early. I poked a hole to let the blood put and reduce swellling, wraped the shit up, grabbed some snow from outside and iced it for a minute, then went back to work.

Life can suck sometimes. But you can either suffer without making progress (what you're doing) or you can suffer while making progress, so that you suffer less in the future.

Today doesnt matter. Your current pain is irrelivant. Only the future in which you are out of this situation matters. And all you have to do to get there is power through it.

Try the ""sheldon method"". In the show ""The Big Bang Theory, the characrer sheldon is basialy asexual, but his wife Amy has a normal sex drive.

So when they got married, he started scheduling times to have sex with her, to make sure she was taken care of. Unfortunately, he also told her about the schedule, which ruined it for her.

So she told him she understood, and that he could make a schedule if it helped him, but to not tell her about it. That way for her, it looked spontaneous, but he had a method of making sure he met her needs."

Ok, I (30M) don't get this. Like any of it. I came to this sub because someone linked it in a comment to something unrelated, and I was curious.

But what the actual fuck? I wouldn't have been surprised to hear that there were men who were just not very good in bed, and whos partnwrs were unsatisfied with the quality of sex. I get that.   Not everyone has the same skills.

But post after post after post is just women saying their husbands wont have sex with them any more.

How do you marry a person, and then refuse to have sex with them?

How does one go through life, telling a person ""you can't have sex with anyone but me. Oh, and by the way, also not me.""???

My personal philosophy is that sex is a basic need, and taking care of your partners basic needs is a responsibility you take on when accepting them as your partner.

If that means putting out when you're not in the mood, so be it. Its not like anyones asking them to go sleep with some random stranger. Thats your wife! Pop a viagra if you're not in the mood. Or go down on her. Or buy her a toy and use that on her.

And the same goes for women. If your husband wants sex, don't just always say no every time you're not in the mood. Lube, like viagra, is a thing.

I can't imagine refusing sex with my fiance just because I didn't want it right then. There have been times when shes initiated, and I just wasnt feeling it. BUT YOU FUCKING DO IT ANY WAY BECAUSE THATS THE WOMAN YOU LOVE, not some random stranger at a bar demanding a one night stand.

Low libido is NOT AN EXCUSE to NEGLECT your spouce, regardless of gender.

Physical disability is a mitigating factor, but seriously, if lesbians can have sex and satisfy eachother, I think a man with ED can figure it out

DnD,fdyzqi1,t1_fdw9xnl,1578785258.0,Where did you get this apple creation ability? Be very careful with 3rd party or home brew character concepts. There is zero garuntee of that being permitted at the table.
DnD,fdw8gab,t3_en8i3h,1578756150.0,"1) its good to practice making characters, but you generally need to find the campaign first, then make your character around that.

Why?

Because your character might be the wrong lvl for the campaign. They don't all always start at lvl 1, so you might need to level uo like 4 or times just to start.

Also the DM may not always follow the loot table to decide your starting wealth. Your character might have more gold and items available to it then you realize. Or maybe less. Your DM might be running a campaign where you start at lvl 5, but wake up in a dungeon without any gear for your first session.

Less common, but still a thing, is the posability that some races or classes may not be part of your DM's world. Or your backstory might not make any sense for the campaign. The character should at least somewhat fit the game.

More common, is that you're like the 3rd of whatever class you picked in your group, so they just dont need you, unless you wang to change your class.

So yeah... group first, then character.

2) You can find groups online at roll20.com. They dont need to know how old you are.

3) go to your local game store and ask if they have a public game night you can attend. Lots of LGS's run a table weekly or monthly."

He needs to hear that.

My fiance has a medical issue that can affect her fertility. She knows I want kids more than anything.

I also told her that if we find out shes totally infertile and it'll never happen, and I have to make a decision between being a father or staying with her, then I will stay with her.

The issue she has can be treated by weight loss and basically improving her general health. And now shes doing everything she can to improve her body so we can have the absolute best chance of having children some day. I can't help but think that the support of knowing that its *ok* to ""fail"" makes it a lot easier to start trying.

Give him permission to fail, and he might be more inclined to try."

DeadBedrooms,fdqpt9v,t3_emp3u4,1578672277.0,"Speaking as a 30 yr old man, let me speculate on a few things he might be having problems with.

1) Low testosterone.
2) High blood pressure
3) Erectile Dysfunction
4) Stress at work
5) low self esteme
6) depression

Bottom line is, its not about you. It was never about you. Your value to him is not the issue here. Hes going out of his way to show you affection, but gets held up on actual sex. That means he loves you, but he has a problem.

 Maybe he doesnt know what it is, and hes afraid to find out.

Maybe he knows what it is, and its humiliating to him, because it makes him feel like less of a man.

Maybe hes afraid that telling you what it is will make it ""real"" and once its ""real"" you wont accept him for it, and he'll lose you.

If you love him and want to stat in that relationship, then you have to talk to him about this. Not in the context of ""lets have sex right now."" Say something like ""I feel really rejected every time you turn me down, and like theres something wrong with me. But if that was true then I don't think you'd be so affectionate all the time. Is there anything going on with you that you want to talk about?""

And ask yourself if, given a viable medical excuse as to why hes not ""up for it"" very often, is that enough? Can you take his non-sexual affection as validation of his love and your worth in that relationship? Can you deal with having sex maybe once a month or so, if you know its nobody's fault? If you can, tell him, so hes comfortable with being open with you about whatever the problem might be.

If you cant do that - if kisses from him, and toys when you're alone aren't enough - then you need to give him an ultimatum. ""If we can't fix this, then I need to be with someone whos right for me"". Something like that."
