Anger,fg1o60r,t3_eweaur,1580430672.0,"I thought I was the only one who did this. Every time I’m mad at my husband, I’m suddenly convinced he’s this evil, disgusting person that I need to get far away from. All my opinions of him are skewed, I forget all the great amazing things about him and I can’t believe I’m still in this relationship. It’s incredibly distressing! It makes me feel crazy!
I told my therapist and she kind of laughed and waved it off as something that everyone does when they’re mad but I don’t think she quite gets it. 
I also struggle with anger and I think it definitely puts a wedge between us. I wish I could control it better. 
I’m sorry I’m not more of a help, but one thing that has worked for me when I get really freaked out about him is angrily writing out everything that I think is wrong with him. Sometimes by the time I’m towards the end of writing, my whole mood has shifted back to realizing how amazing he is and my writing turns to all the things I love about him and I’m crying because of how much I love him."

I’ll bet more people would relate than you think."
Anger,ffz75gp,t3_evwlsk,1580366075.0,"I think it’s a good sign that you’re aware of it, that you feel remorse about it, and that you care to improve.  From your post, you seem to be a decent writer. Ever consider just angrily writing everything down when you feel the rage? I know it sounds ridiculous... and sitting down and writing it out is the last thing you’re thinking of in the moment, but I’ve tried it. And believe it or not, I felt relieved of the burden afterward. Refreshed. Better. It’s like getting the therapy session right in the heat of the moment, when you need it most. 
I wish you well."
offmychest,ffsopet,t3_euofsg,1580187301.0,"Ugh!! THANK YOU for writing this post. Same situation and viewpoint, just slightly different examples."
Anger,ffcx4f7,t3_erkecu,1579809095.0,Could it maybe be something like OCD or high functioning autism?
Anger,ffcwpk1,t1_ff4hdce,1579808851.0,"I’m a angry parent of an autistic child as well. What a combo, huh? Get yourself and your kid on the Nemechek Protocol. Don’t take meds, take fish oil."
offmychest,ff0r5wc,t3_eqxx45,1579471519.0,This is beautiful. And you’re a great writer. You should write your story. Even if just for yourself.
offmychest,feffxde,t3_eotta8,1579055487.0,"Look up the Nemechek Protocol. Good luck!
You’re doing a great job, be kind to yourself"

LifeProTips,fdknbsg,t1_fdj8zyc,1578507142.0,"I had a friend, who as a full-blown adult would say “my tummy hurts” whenever she had a stomach ache and I had the same gag reaction. I almost can’t even think about it because it bothers me so much"
