Huntingdogs,fdgwjb4,t1_fdfos51,1578410081.0,"Just do it yourself for a few months and see how it goes.  The Altmoor Puppy Manual and Prize 1 are both training books especially for Deutsch Drahthaars which are just a subset of GWPs. Or watch some YT vids on basic obedience and then force fetch.  If you make it through that, you’re more than 50% of the way to fully trained and can hunt decently with just those skills. It’s always better to build your partnership with your dog rather than through a trainer.  Always."
Huntingdogs,fdfh76k,t3_el3szd,1578361611.0,Possibly. Good chance she’s got the genetics. Give it a solid try.

Huntingdogs,fd5nj7o,t1_fd32j10,1578179400.0,Terribly fishy and I try to avoid them. This was so fast & early that I thought it was a teal. I give away almost all of my game to folks who are less fortunate and love to prepare & eat wild game.
Huntingdogs,fd2u31d,t3_ejoi7m,1578151671.0,Train for hunt tests. Mine is a Deutsch Drahthaar and we train in off season for JGV hunt and breed tests. Your breed will have something similar. You can get lots of help as well.
