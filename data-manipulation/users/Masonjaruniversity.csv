snowden,ffex67q,t3_esm7st,1579869114.0,"I remember all of the discussions and hand wringing everyone had in the early 2000's  about this very topic.  A lot of news organizations were asking are these enhanced interrogation techniques REALLY  torture? When someone, generally a retired interrogation expert from the military, would say ""yes this is torture. "" the response would be  ""Yes, but is it REALLY?"""

politics,fc06zdq,t1_fbzqs81,1577281257.0,"So are applying this notion of moral luck to Trump the child or Trump the adult? 

As a child, no you don’t have choices, you’re bound to your caregiver and their influences upon you. As an adult however, you have the ability to choose which direction it is you’re going to take and how you react to whatever situation you may be in. And for a person like Trump who has more access to services, education, and guidance than 99.9% of the population it is an ethical and moral failure on his part. 

Thank you for introducing me to the term moral luck! Though I’m not sure I entirely agree with it, It’s a fascinating concept."
