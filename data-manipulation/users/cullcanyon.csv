I don’t understand the love Trump gets from the military. Research shows he is supported by the enlisted ranks but not by the officers. Maybe the difference in education levels. Trump does appeal to a certain mentality. He does use jingoism that appeal young people that are patriotic. When he hugs the flag I want to throw up. I was in the marines in 65-67. I’m a disabled vet. I have my bona fides. Bone spurs my ass. This man was a coward then and a coward now. He didn’t even fire mad dog to his face. Sorry for the rant."

USMC,ffvvcob,t3_evhbdl,1580274362.0,"Why is he keeping quiet about this con man?  You know he has total disdain for him. He is the antithesis of everything Matis stands for. He is a draft dodger that that ridiculed McCain. He made fun of a family who lost a son in Iraq. He has done nothing for veterans except rip them off through his phony charity. He pardoned a cold-blooded killer Seal thereby insulting the Navy and it’s code of discipline. He has deserted our blood allies the Kurds thereby ruining our credibility with other nations in the Mideast. No one can trust us now. He has partnered up with our sworn enemy, Russia. It is all about him and him making money. He cares nothing about this country. Mattis knows this. He should speak out."

AbandonedPorn,ffvawnp,t3_evdotv,1580259812.0,I have one at the bottom of my driveway. People use it as an Instagram spot. Girls in bikinis etc. one kid dressed as Superman under his civics. When people ask where I live I say the house with the phone booth. They are really heavy. 1800 lbs ~ cast iron. Best $700 I ever spent.
OldSchoolCool,fftle3f,t3_eusl5a,1580223538.0,"It looks like he’s trying hard to stand out in a sea of actors. They all have suits on and he has a tight white tshirt ala Brando. He has his jaw clinched to show his intensity. He is sitting in the end seat with his foot on the chair. The perfect pose. It also looks like he has been working out. Again, ala Brando. I bet he carried himself around the school with same airs. So when people asked who he was they would say”oh that’s Paul Newman he’s going to be a great actor”. I’m a Paul Newman fan but I think this picture is a bit much."

GetMotivated,ffattgs,t3_escjxk,1579744334.0,I worked in a casino once. An obnoxious drunk was being led out by two security guards and the drunk was yelling all the way that he just hit keno for $50k and they were guarding him out to his car. Moral: if you’re being run out of town make it look like you’re leading a parade.
OldSchoolCool,ffao0o7,t3_eql531,1579740449.0,That was a lot of money in 78. Must have been highly optioned. It looks like it with the wire wheels. They were rare. Nice car and I love the color. You should buy one like it.

powerwashingporn,ff673ih,t3_er3bak,1579620697.0,I regret that I discovered power washing so late in life. The problem I have now is that everywhere I go I see things that need power washing. I’m going to seek counseling. Does someone have a name for the extreme desire to power wash?
GetMotivated,ff54yup,t1_ff4xuad,1579580376.0,"Both my daughters are young lawyers. Both have good jobs. One does personal injury in Los Angeles And one is a District Attorney in San Diego. After 2008 jobs were scarce but now there are plenty of jobs. The key is to do internships while you are in school even while you’re in college. You get contacts, real work experience and you get to build a resume. Both of them worked for free to get that experience. They were lucky because they had me to support them. It sucks because not everyone can do that. Regardless, you absolutely need to network and internships are the key. Government jobs are great. Work for the city, county, state or even the feds. But even if it is private it is good. Pick something you like and have your school help you to match up. Hope this helps. Sorry for the lack of paragraphs. I’m not getting paid for this so I don’t care. Lol."

GetMotivated,ff4vj61,t3_ere89c,1579573455.0,Passed the Bar at 35. It took forever to get through law school. Five years and then failed the bar exam the first time. Now I’m 75. So I’ve been a lawyer for 40 years. I’ve made more than enough money and put both my daughters through law school. Nobody ever cared about my past or the crummy night law school I went to. All people care about is can you do the job. All my friends went to fancy law schools and became lawyers at a young age. We are equals and have been since I went to work. I had a ton of setbacks but I never quit. Age doesn’t matter. I thought it did but it doesn’t. Go for it.

DestroyedTanks,fes78j9,t3_eq6691,1579362131.0,I assume there are other bodies inside. What a shitty job getting them out. I think they gave those jobs to the company fuckups as punishment.  That halftrack looks like it has seen some shit. 50’s front and rear. Ammo belts on front fenders. They need a second lieutenant to have them get that gear squared away. They probably need a shave too.
OldSchoolCool,fes5f4j,t3_eqbd16,1579361585.0,It’s a 54 Chevy but not a Bel Air. Bel Air’s had chrome around the windshield. This is a cheaper model. It also has two extra bumper guards added for that beefy look. I had one of these. It was a good solid car made out of metal not plastic.

I guess he was a local wrestling star. He had an entourage with. He was really friendly and talked with everyone. I think the Rock is the same way. He probably watched his father and copied it because it was the right thing to do.

Then I got the matchbook that goes along with it. The rubber tins I got along the way from flea markets and garage sales. You can buy them on eBay but I don’t like to do that, it’s more fun to just luck into them. I will get more as I see them. It is a unique collection. The sign ties it together.

Now they can be up to a $100 for a rare one.

It is only “stolen valor” if you claim it is yours, and even then, it is only illegal if you use the medal for some sort of advantage. Like to get free benefits like donations.
