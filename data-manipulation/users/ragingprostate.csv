Learn to take criticism, but learn the difference between constructive and someone trying to knock you down; when the latter, put yourself in their shoes and consider the why. Maybe they're having a tough time, perhaps they see you as competition. Learning to empathize in college and put yourself into someone else's skin isn't just a good skill for making friends, it's essential in the workplace. Because if you can empathize and understand where people come from, you can anticipate what they're going to do next and generally how to approach them. With so many egos in college (students and professors alike) it will help you to be calculated and give you an advantage in so many situations.

Lastly, you get out of college what you put into it. If you want to go to class and go to your dorm and stay inside that's your prerogative, but you're missing out on so many opportunities. You will never find another time in your life when you can go out of your comfort zone so easily and without any kind of risk. Do things you never would have done.

>Well, aren't you just a lovely person? It wasn't a *couple*. There was a 28% rise in suicide in kids age 10-17 that April, in 2017. That's not a couple.

In the grand scheme of the total number of suicides in 2017, in the grand scheme of how many suicides it probably prevented...yeah, just a couple of dimwits. 


>The reason there was no, or little, outrage for the book was because, shockingly, Netflix is a much larger vehicle. It reached more people, and had a bigger impact.

Exactly. There's a word you're looking for: manufactured outrage. 


>Of course not. Suicide shouldn't be avoided as a topic, and I don't appreciate you attempting to imply that I said that.

Well you did say that. You're saying it again - look below. 

>There's a difference between the ugly glamorisation Netflix is guilty of in this show, and handling the same topic with more care and attention.

Netflix is only guilty of creating a decent television show based off a novel. You say they're glamorizing it because you're uncomfortable with the subject matter. 

 >The same storyline could've been handled just fine, with a few tweaks, even. I'm not advocating for censorship, just responsible decision-making which Netflix and the people involved in this show didn't do.

""I'm not advocating censorship, I just wish they wouldn't put material that wouldn't make me feel uncomfortable.""

You can't have it both ways. Either you hamfist a sugar coated docuseries about suicide that isn't going to reach anyone or a watered down version of the novel, or you go all the way and make it have the impact the source material deserves. They did the latter and rightly so. 


>And Netflix continues not to do, as evidenced by this post.

Because it's not their responsibility to dictate what people choose to watch.


The main problem here is you can't seem to see this show and novel big picture. So what if there was an uptick? Can you really measure how many suicides were affected by the show? Can you even measure how many lives were spared by the show? It's meaningless outrage that boils down to, 'yes there was a conceding uptick...for a month... this is one theory.'

Come on, why are you shaking your first like a Boomer at a show that only had one good season, anyway?"
netflix,feak1ml,t1_fe9vhv5,1578949750.0,"Saying the glamorization of suicide puts them at fault is such an empty and dishonest argument. If you have a problem with glamorization, then you have a problem with fiction. I doubt that's true, so really you're cherry picking the fiction you disagree with.

Yes suicide was glamorized in the show - just like in the book (where was the outrage then?). What you're failing to mention is it also dealt heavily with the fallout of suicide. Like all good art, the novel and first season were fearless. It also got the conversation about teen suicide rolling again.

But because a couple of dimwits killed themselves in April of that year, that's all people like you focus on - not the life lessons it teaches. Look, I feel for those kids and their parents if the show did indeed put them over the edge (which I seriously doubt is measurable but let's assume it is). Even so, the fiction still must exist. If anyone saw the show, read the book, and said to themselves that suicide is sexy and is the next logical step I don't think there's enough positive media out there that could have changed that trajectory. Suicide is a tragedy, but to pen it on the show is sensationalist bullshit in the same vein that the rage school shooters feel stems from violent video games. 

Come on, you're going to seriously let a monthly pop in suicides define your stance on the role of fiction, whether certain topics should be avoided, and how much passion a creator can put into a work of art that deals with sensitive material to avoid coming across as, 'glamorizing,' just because fandom on social media says otherwise?"

What happens when you have a job in the industry you enjoy only to have your parents blowing up your phone every five seconds asking if you made it to work? What are you going to do when you're on the phone with an important contact and you can't concentrate because your mom and dad can't stop worrying about what you're doing at this moment? And if you ever have kids, it's going to get infinitely worse. If you travel, you'll never have the peace you need. It will never, ever stop. 

You're at the point where you're seeing parts of your parents as a liability versus an asset. We all get to that point, it's part of growing up. And you know that you know better than they do in this situation. Think like a parent. What can you do to make them comfortable with giving you space? Only you know the answer, but I think the best place to start is to refuse to talk to your parents while at university. Like I said, leave your phone at home 'accidentally' or block them so they won't be a distraction as a way to force them to have space between you. 

They won't like it, but they'll also realize that the sky didn't fall on them too. From there lay your ground rules. If they don't like it, that's their problem. It's your life - you need to be the authority figure here, not your parents."
MarkMyWords,fdhah4l,t1_fdgkc4x,1578418867.0,People like OP and others in this thread lump Communism and Socialism together because they don't know the difference. My idiot brother in law that fantasizes about Trump's administration pegging him while his taxes go out of control and American Oligarchs like Bezos pay $0 doesn't know the difference either. They're parroting what they've been spoon fed and actually have no idea what they're saying. Not really any use in debating them.

The guy was letting people play it but there's no way I was going to touch that thing though I was tempted to pop in Sim City 2000 he had lying on the table. This thing had a version of DKC I had never seen before, but he didn't have any additional information about the cart. Nice as can be, we chatted about lawncare more than the actual console."

science,fcstnv1,t1_fcssoz1,1577924819.0,"A gun for a farmer is a regular tool just like a backhoe or a hay bailer. They take pride in their work because they're providing food for their country, so of course they're going to have a small sense of nationalism. Nothing wrong with that until it's to the detriment of the country. 

We need farmers. Their margins are thin at best and they're killing themselves at a depressing rate yet we need them. Don't demonize a group of people just because they ignorantly vote for an administration that refers to them as, 'whine cellars.' It's fucking sad but they need our support."
