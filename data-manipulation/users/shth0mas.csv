Whatever you do, don’t wear over the knee red high heeled leather boots. It will make you memorable in a bad way. ( true story. She actually wore hooker boots to an interview. And a matching jacket and skirt so that’s cool right)

In general I don’t think you want your clothing to be memorable to an interviewer. Go for bland more than memorable. It will make you look more normal and professional. Make the interview the memorable part."

First you should decide how you want to keep your TBR (to be read ) list. Goodreads? Notebook? Excel spreadsheet?

Then you should start writing down books that sound good. Goodreads is easy because it has a bit of info. 

I like to listen to book podcasts and book youtubes. There is also a r/suggestmeabook and other places online. New York Times book review, book awards like Nobel, man booker, Hugo, nebula, Arthur c Clarke. Look at the list of literary awards wiki. All of these can bring titles to your attention that you might want to read. 

Then, when you are ready to pick up a book, take a look at your TBR, and decide what sounds good. The right book is what sounds good to you, right then. 

Enjoy!"

You’re going to start finding books you want to read now that you’re looking, and you need a way to keep track. Also good reads has a readers choice award where you might find more books you want to read. 

I’d like to recommend the author Brandon Sanderson; you can see if you like sci fi. I suggest SKYWARD. He has more books if you like them. 

I would also like to recommend Louise Penny. She writes murder mysteries. Her series starts with STILL LIFE. If you like it there’s fifteen or so more. Read them in order so you don’t spoil the plot!

Lastly I want to suggest GIDEON THE NINTH. it’s a sarcastic fantasy involving necromancy. See what you think of that one."
