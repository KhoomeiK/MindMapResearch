They were not exactly focused on a quality home. They were more focused on getting them done. That being said. Not the worst builder in our area either.  But I should have specified earlier, Hart DeNoble is a quality first builder and they are rather pricy. But it's something I decided to throw in for contrast sake,and to maybe let you see what can be done with money focused on quality.  I would focus on O'Brien, out of those 3.

But you should definitely check out Hart DeNoble,they were awesome to build for as a Craftsman,lots of custom homes and in the field changes and modifications. As well as the owner is a really down to earth guy. Atleast when I knew him,I built probably 20-30 houses for him and they were all pretty awesome. Good luck and have fun."
