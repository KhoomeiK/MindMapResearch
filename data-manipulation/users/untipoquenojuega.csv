All that is known about the royal standard of the Germanic kings of northwestern Spain is from a document uncovered by historian Perez Constanti which describes the founding of the new flag of Galicia. 

In February 15th 1669 the General Council of the Kingdom of Galicia declared that *""(...) from then onwards it was decided to erase the green dragon and the red lion (arms of the Swabian kings who ruled this country at the time) and bring onto the golden field of the arms the consecrated wafer (...)""*"
