fireemblem,fekr0pb,t1_fekpx8q,1579205817.0,"sort of but no? he was Rare originally, and those rights were never actually taken up by Nintendo. Microsoft has made Rare an exclusive for the last 20 years since buying them out, so at this point they have had them longer than Nintendo has. IP is weird like that.
Edit: Then there is the legality of it. Banjo cannot appear unless Microsoft says ok, so he is by definition a rep for their company.

Also Ike was specifically his POR incarnation in brawl, so no Micaiah yet sadly"
fireemblem,fekpmbd,t1_feki9pg,1579204986.0,"well going as far back as melee it's always had the newest protag. melee had roy before his game came out, brawl had Ike, wii u had Corrin again like roy, and this one has Byleth. It's just a pattern. 

As for the theory, we technically do have a microsoft rep in Banjo, given that they bought out Rare a pretty long time ago. They just don't really do much with the licence, only making one crappy sequel and the rare replay. Aside from that you have had one dlc from each company so far

Plant-Nintendo

Joker-Atlus

Terry-SNK

Hero-Square Enix 

Banjo- Rare/Microsoft

The next one in the pattern would seem to be Sony as well as how popular Spyro and Crash are and their history on Nintendo systems. And honestly, I'm not mad or anything. just disappointed."

I had this whole theory that they were trying to get one rep from each major company, so was hoping for a Sony character (crash, spyro or hell, kratos would be rad).

 Byleth just seems like the cheap,obvious pick since the newest fe protag always gets in, sometimes before their game is even announced (cough roy cough). I get that sakurai really likes the series but ugh."
