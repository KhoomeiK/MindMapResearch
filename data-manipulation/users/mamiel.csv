Fes can be really hard to navigate though, so I’d recommend getting someone to show you around. If not, some one might see you looking lost, offer to show you how to get somewhere, then demand payment for it. This happened to me and my husband, some guy started following us around because we looked lost, he pointed out some mosque or something we weren’t even looking for (we were looking for a place to eat which we never found) then for the rest of our stay in Fes this dude would approach us angrily everyday and demand money for his “service”. 

Don’t let that put you off, though Fes is amazing and worth the visit. No one likes Casablanca so I wouldn’t bother spending real time there."

Persian gulf is a death trap. Big military tankers are sitting targets for Iranian missiles and civilian boats can also be loaded with explosives and mobilized to take down our warships (ala the SS Cole) . Saudis have no idea how to fight and are vulnerable to Iranian missiles. Kuwait would be hosed if Iran decided to take out their desalination plants, which they could do with ease.

Chefchouen is in the hills and not overly hot, either."
StackAdvice,fdf73l3,t3_ekucdf,1578354828.0,"Modafinil? I also have ADHD but my stupid psychiatrists refuse to acknowledge it so Iâ€™ve had to self medicate .

Right now Wellbutrin is helping but it hasnâ€™t in the past. On a prn basis Iâ€™ve found modafinil and white leaf Kratom to be the best prn fixes when I need to focus.

Edit to add: if you are in the Bay Area, UCSF is doing a lot of trial studies on ADHD right now, so you can get free treatment. Theyâ€™re about to start one on with a Chinese herb."

todayilearned,fd1hwfl,t1_fd1a42t,1578131451.0,"Look up â€œmillennium challengeâ€.  Our military spent 250 million dollars to do a simulated war game against Iran, and the result was that Iran kicked our ass. It was so bad they cheated and reset the game and got their asses kicked by Iran again. 

Persian gulf is a death trap. Big military tankers are sitting targets for Iranian missiles and civilian boats can also be loaded with explosives and mobilized to take down our warships (ala the SS Cole) . Saudis have no idea how to fight and are vulnerable to Iranian missiles. Kuwait would be hosed if Iran decided to take out their desalination plants, which they could do with ease. 

I learned about this by listening to War Nerdâ€™s podcast about USâ€™s chances in a war against Iran. [war nerd ](https://www.patreon.com/posts/radio-war-nerd-26939754)"

She was the product of an affair between her (married) dad and his mistress and he wound up treating her just like a mistress. I think she only met him a few times because she was creeped out."

What made her and many of her fellow nuns leave was the paternalistic rules the church had over her order. Nuns in her order weren't allowed to visit with their family of origin except maybe once a year. The church told them what movies and tv shows they could see. Oh, and they worked as teachers for 40 hours a week without pay AND were expected to keep priests' living quarters clean. It was very sexist. She was like, ""yeah, nah""."
