However, in April 1919, British troops under British General Reginald Dyer stationed themselves outside and around the Golden Temple- an extremely holy temple of Sikhism. Following that, the British fired directly into unarmed civilians until they spent all their ammunition. Hundreds were killed and even more hundreds (thousands?) were injured. It was not looked upon favorably by anyone really."

For the sake of seeing if that statement were true, I looked up some numbers.

Using this [Commonwealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations) page and referencing the [Stockholm International Peace Research Institute](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/Data%20for%20all%20countries%20from%201988–2018%20in%20constant%20%282017%29%20USD%20%28pdf%29.pdf), I was able to find the expenditure of **39/53** for 2018 of the Commonwealth of Nations. The 2018 total military expenditure for the Commonwealth (including UK, Canada, New Zealand, India, and Australia) was US**$264,934,400,000**. Adding Germany and France 2018 expenditures (total US$113,300,000,000) increases that total US**$378,234,400,000**. Adding the countries of Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark (US$20,899,000,000) further increases total expenditure to US**$399,133,400,000**.

Countries I did not find in the **SIPRI** include: Antigua & Barbuda, Bahamas, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Naura, Saint Kitts, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu.

In 2018, total US military expenditure was **$648,798,000,000**. 

The funds for defense specifically may be greater but total military expenditure still isn't even close."

Whatcouldgowrong,fcox6zp,t1_fcovt9c,1577844043.0,"Francis said that quote but it he said it of Benedict XVI. Pope Paul VI did not permit the use of artificial birth control methods at anytime. Paul VI famously denounced their use in one of the 20th Century's most well known papal encyclical [*Humanae Vitae*](http://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html). 


Catholic teaching also totally agrees with your point about prosperity through self-control. However, the Catholic perspective rests on literal self-control, personal responsibility, and observance of God's will. Part of God's will, as it relates to sexuality, is being open towards the procreative nature of sexual union in every instance. Despite what non-Catholics believe or have heard of Catholic teaching on sex, sex is meant to be enjoyable, pleasurable, but also chaste."

worldnews,fb8r6lq,t1_fb8nsxk,1576619956.0,"Miaphysitism wasn't declared a heresy. Monophysitism was declared heresy. Miaphysitism - the nature of Jesus Christ being human and divine without division, is the Christological position held by Coptic Churches, Armenian Apostolic, and other Oriental Orthodox churches. Western Christianity sometimes refers to Miaphysitism as Monophysitism. 

The Miaphysites would declare that the Humanity and Divinity of Christ are united in one nature. Monophysites would declare that the Humanity is absorbed into the Divinity. 

Western Christianity (Roman Catholicism specifically) took on the dyophysitism or dyothelitism position - that Jesus Christ possesses two natural operations: Human and Divine. Those natural operations have natural wills. 

> They are not opposed to each other, but co-operate in such a way that the Word made flesh willed humanly in obedience to his Father all that he had decided divinely with the Father and the Holy Spirit for our salvation. Christ's human will 'does not resist or oppose but rather submits to his divine and almighty will.

The history of this debate is talked of extensively at the Council of Chalcedon (451) and the Sixth Ecumencial Council of Constantinople (681.)"
