Warne's the sort of guy who needed a good kick in the arse every few years to remind himself that he wasn't God's gift to the world.

He got that from Terry Jenner early in his career: You're a fat lazy piece of shit, Shane....you think you can go out smashing cans and eating junk every night while playing for Australia? How about you get real?

He arguably got that with the suspension: No, you're not above the rules Shane. Do the crime, do the time, piss off and see you in 12 months.

I saw an interview with Sammy Hagar, where he said that Eddie was great at coming up with riffs and licks, but needed a LOT of help in condensing these ideas into coherent songs. So Sammy's role (and presumably DLR's before him) was to be the 'arranger', taking Eddie's disparate ideas and organising them into a verse-chorus-bridge format.

In that context, I think you can see Van Halen III as Eddie Run Wild. You notice that virtually every song is 5-6 minutes minimum, with a whole bunch of different parts smashed together. I guess Gary being the 'new guy' didn't have the force of personality to reign Eddie in...."

The original version is this godawful dance-pop song, with Rivers pulling one of his fake-braggadocious ""I'm a sex machine who picks up solid 10s in da club every night"" personas. (And yes, I get that it's probably a satire, but it's terrible satire and Rivers is embarrassing trying to pull this off).

The acoustic version completely changes the tone. It's like a sad, depressed middle-aged man who's desperately clinging to a youth already gone, and trying to take solace in empty pleasures.

I think the issue with Izzy was more fundamental. Axl took 17 years to come up with a new album of original material. Izzy may have taken the 'soul' or 'heart' of the band with him when he left, but I think he took a fair portion of the brains too.

IMHO if GnR had been able to keep churning out solid tunes and albums into the 90s, I reckon they would have been fine. The mid 90s saw the rise of bands like Oasis and a return to Bad Boy rock-and-roll decadence. GnR would have fit in well."

Suicide is an extremely emotionally charged issue, and a lot of people are probably looking for someone to 'blame'.
