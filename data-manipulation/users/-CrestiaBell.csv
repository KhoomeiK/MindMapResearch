No, being a Millennial isn't the sole source of every problem in the universe. No, ""Boomers"" didn't intentionally harm the viability of existing as a Millennial in the modern workplace. Though I'd argue in many cases, the frustrations you see *from* Millennials stem from the ignorance (willful or unwillful) of older Generations to the nuances of what makes surviving *as* a Millennial.




**Objectively** speaking, the spending power of $100,000 dollars in the year 1980 is worth nearly $300,000 dollars now. While wages *have* fluctuated between then and now, the underlying issue is in that to an extent - it's not *as* sufficient as before in building up things like a retirement (provided we even can retire.) Yes, everyone can just stack all of their chips into STEM, but *those* weren't the jobs that necessarily got Baby Boomers *or* the Greatest Generation their wealth. In my case (I aim to be a teacher internationally), I'd technically be below the poverty line if I did so in the United States. Yes, I could decide *not* to teach, but if *everyone* did, we wouldn't have any teachers left. 




The stark difference of employment in the past version employment in the presence is the death of the passion job. There's no lucrativeness or edge to running a diner etc. as one might've done some 40 years ago. Additionally, it's the death of the so-called ""traditional household"" where the Father is the sole breadwinner, while the mother takes care of the children. Now, both the Father *and* Mother will often need to work just to get by, and while plenty *are* okay with that, this is where some of the frustration comes in.



While simultaneously ignoring the nuance of this new employment environment, older generations still attempt to impress that traditionalist mindset *upon* the modern world. As a woman, and say I were heterosexual, even if I *wanted* to stay at home, I *can't* unless I'm okay with living a life of financial instability. However, there's no shortage of people who would look down on me for doing what I have to provide for my family in that scenario.



That's where the frustration stems for a lot of people. It's not necessarily that any one thing is the end-all, be-all cause of every problem in our life, so much as it is the comments from those that don't experience it. For many, it's the equivalent of a healthy, uninjured person deriding a quadriplegic because they didn't stand during the national anthem.



TL;DR - There's a large amount of hyperbole from people regarding the whole ""Boomers ruined everything"" thing. What people are experiencing is the phenomenon of a market prone to both fluctuation and evolution, and people that don't seem to understand it."
