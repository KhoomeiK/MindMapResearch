Hope you get to enjoy many more hours whether in 3, Fallout NV, 4, or some other exciting world!

I kinda made up my own name for this phenomenon based on my own experience, I call it the Final Fantasy effect. 

It's when a game world, characters, or gameplay sucks you in so much that you can *feel* that these are going to be memories that you look back upon fondly. When a game is not only so cool but lives up to your expectations. Everyone says you dont know you're in the ""golden days"" until they're gone. But some games definitely let me know loud and clear that I was experiencing one of the best parts of my child / young adult life.

I'm sure no one really cares but here are the games that were so excellent at the time FOR ME personally that I felt like ""this was a game I'd been waiting for my whole life"":

Majora's Mask & Twilight Princess

SM64

Jet Force Gemini

Final Fantasy X and XV

Halo 1-3, specifically 2 and 3 for the endless multiplayer fun with friends in junior high and high school

MGS Series

KOTOR

Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy

Bioshock / Infinite

Fable 1 & 2(absolutely did NOT meet my expectations even as a.. 5th grader? But was my first true hype experience along with Halo 2)

Diablo II

Far Cry 1 & 3

Half-Life 2

WoW

Dishonored

Witcher 3

Yakuza Series

Death Stranding

FO4, while it continued the trend of simplifying things that I didn't really want simplified, was still worth a good 2-300 hours of sucking up my life. Maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed 4 so much if Fallout didn't already have a very special place in my heart, but I too have no rugrats about it!"

Strangely, a lot of people are familiar with Strong Bad and / or Trogdor but aren't aware of the larger Homestar fiction. Guess I can thank Guitar Hero and Hot Topic for that? Lol"

gaming,fe603um,t1_fe5iusm,1578878794.0,"Luckily I was put off enough by all the pre release hoopla that I didn't buy it, no matter how much I wanted to I knew it wasn't gonna be worth the money. FO4, while it continued the trend of simplifying things that I didn't really want simplified, was still worth a good 2-300 hours of sucking up my life. Maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed 4 so much if Fallout didn't already have a very special place in my heart, but I too have no rugrats about it!"

Was one of my favorite websites, seeing a new homepage or computer for SBEmails for the first time(or a new episode of teen girl squad!) was the most exciting thing.

Strangely, a lot of people are familiar with Strong Bad and / or Trogdor but aren't aware of the larger Homestar fiction. Guess I can thank Guitar Hero and Hot Topic for that? Lol"

It had a fried mac and cheese patty on top. I didn't understand why it was called the layover, maybe because it's super filling while you're waiting on a long layover?

...no, no. Its because it causes your body to have a biological layover. You'll be stuck in the toilet terminal for a day or 2 after eating. Still pretty worth it, it was amazing."
