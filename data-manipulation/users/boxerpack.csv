Pete_Buttigieg,ffpqxoa,t1_ffpluea,1580102573.0,"I’m not confusing the two, although Hillsborough does share one of Burlingame’s two zip codes. I do believe the person who replied, and others who take CA politics for granted, might be confused.

I’ve worked in San Mateo local politics for five years now. I’ve canvassed San Mateo, Burlingame, Millbrae, and San Bruno for different campaigns. The County, like all counties, are broken up into precincts (some refer to them as districts). There are bluer and redder precincts in Burlingame.

Burlingame has roughly 50% registered Ds, and roughly 20% registered Rs, however, the rest “decline to state”. In my canvassing, precincts 1020, 21, 22, 1201, 02, 03, 04, 05, plus a few others down by 1008, skew conservative. Many voted for Obama. More support Trump.  The DTS voters swing. This is why I referred to it as an enclave. At the end of the day, it’s an electoral vote, so it’s not going to matter for President/VP.

I’ve seen zero Trump signs, and I travel quite a bit, throughout the city for work. There are some Bernie signs, some Yang signs, but this is the first Pete sign I’ve seen. Here’s why it matters to me.

There’s a bigger point, I believe we need to wrap our heads around the fact that Trump supporters aren’t openly vocal. This is true in Burlingame. If pressed, they’ll state their support. But I’d be surprised to see a Trump sign. I believe this is likely true for a lot of other cities in America. In California, it won’t matter. In Pennsylvania, it will. That’s why I encourage people to ignore the polls. This race has to be fought like we’re losing, and our lives depend on winning. If people don’t believe Trump has huge support, and don’t vote, contribute and volunteer, it’s my opinion that they’re going to be sadly disappointed.

All that aside, it was refreshing to see a Pete sign on one of my walks today."

Pete_Buttigieg,ffogu4w,t1_ffobpfb,1580077495.0,"I sometimes work on local and state campaigns. Sadly, it’s surprisingly MAGA. They may be on the less vocal side of supporters, but the majority is firmly in Trump’s camp. I think a lot of it comes from their distrust of state Dems. They mostly despise Brown and  Newsom and they absolutely hate the ACA. Burlingame is old money mixed with new. Big Pharma, Healthcare, Banking and Tech make up most of the voters."

In crime or military dramas, you’ll often see some kind of surveillance scene. The photo or video being studied is blurry and some technician or superior or government official will say, “can you zoom in on that?” The person running the equiptment will press a few buttons, or slide a joystick, usually with a target graphic on screen. They’ll zoom in and presto, the image is magically brought into high definition focus. Some suspect is revealed, or license plate identified, or location pinned. That ain’t how it works.

I was just a little kid. I was at my friend’s house playing. My friend’s father, who always scared the crap out of me, a real macho f*#k, came home and asked if there’d been anything on the TV about the Apollo mission. I panicked, not sure why, and lied. I think maybe I was just trying to show off. I said, it landed, but there was a problem with one of the parachutes. He was stunned. “What do you mean?!” Scared, I continued, its fine, only one parachute didn’t open, but the others did, it landed okay and the astronauts are safe. 

I left there minutes later and walked home. When I got there, my father called for me to hurry into the living room. “Hurry up son, the astronauts are landing.” Apollo 15 hadn’t landed yet, and I stood there in shock, as I watched it land, live on TV, with one parachute failing to open, and finally touching down, with everyone safe.
