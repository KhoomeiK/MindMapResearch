Advice,fet3cd1,t1_fet2dgt,1579371407.0,That's abuse and manipulation. It's not your fault. Remind yourself of that as much as you need to: it's not your fault. You deserve better!
Advice,fet0ral,t3_eqie9l,1579370787.0,"You're being emotionally abused. The longer you live like this, the harder it will be to have healthy relationships in the future. This is not a relationship and she doesn't love you, she likes having a fallback option and your age and inexperience make it easier for her to manipulate you.

Your last sentence in your post acknowledges that this is going to end. You can be the one to end it. You don't owe her anything, but you owe it to yourself to be free, and to not miss out on a relationship where you experience genuine love and mutual respect."
Advice,fesvdk7,t3_eqi8xp,1579369392.0,"You need to seek help for your mental health. Cognitive behavioral therapy might be hugely beneficial. If you can't afford it, you may be able to find clinicians in your area who work on a sliding scale based on your income.

As for the scary guy, he sounds unhinged and dangerous. Do not contact him or respond to his attempts to contact you, as neither will help. If he knows where you live, find a friend who will let you crash on their couch for awhile."
Advice,fesnkdo,t3_eqc486,1579367134.0,"It sounds like you enjoy the feeling of improving the quality of life for other people, and there are ways you can do that with your degree. Don't get bogged down by the idea of become a cubicle jockey at some soulless conglomerate. Technology is an exciting and ever-evolving field.

Think about how tech often overlooks the people you mention in your post. I'm a UX designer and my dad has advanced MS, so I think about this a lot. For example, elderly people may suffer from loss of dexterity, and apps and software designed for touchscreen devices are often difficult to use because touchpoints are small and crammed together, or require a lot of gesturing with thumbs that may be arthritic. 

As an engineer, you can do something about that by advocating for larger touchpoints and smarter, more customizable software that allows users to increase font size without breaking layouts, new ways to zoom that don't use the pinch method, and new keyboard layouts. As a mathematician, you could be a leader in machine learning to accommodate more people and adapting the software to the user based on their physical interactions with it. Use the technology to not just accommodate more people, but to empower them.

Think about blind people, and how a lot of websites aren't all that great at screen reading, especially when the layout changes and things shift order in responsive web design. Think about the hearing-impaired, and how you might be able to develop smarter, more accurate captioning--maybe something that can be implemented on a device to caption audio on any website or app.

There's robotics and 3D printing and so much more you can do with math, and your concern and empathy for others can really make a difference on a huge scale.

But how do you go about doing all that? I hear you asking. Well, that's hard to answer. Some people fall right into that first job that opens the door, and others have to use each job as a stepping stone. If it's the latter (which is the one I had to take myself), the first step is getting a job using your degree. It may be at that soulless conglomerate, but at least then you have that experience on your resume when you look for the next job.

Practically speaking, here's what that might look like: working as that cubicle jockey for, say, 1-2 years. In that time, you're getting experience and learning what being in the field is like (including the politics of it and how to be effective at influencing others), and you're being smart about where you apply and when. If you're in a position where you don't HAVE to take a job, you should wait until you get the RIGHT job, and don't be fooled by idealistic ninny-heads promising you things like, ""We can't afford to pay you much right NOW, but you're getting in on the ground floor! It will be sooo worth it when this thing takes off!"" That's the worst trap to fall into. I fell for that in my early career and it's a very, very hard hole to claw out of.

My advice is to do what you can to get your foot in the door in your field (while working), and start heading in the direction you think your field should go.

I hope that helps.

Advice,fesfj2e,t1_feqs4yt,1579364613.0,"Bonus about reading for others: volunteering your time looks great on your resume/CV, and will give you an edge with a lot of employers, now and after you're done with school."
Advice,fesaky4,t3_eqgzd1,1579363272.0,"It's totally fine to fall out of love with your major. Equally fine that you aren't motivated to do programming on your own time--that's basically what it's like to have a career. You put in your eight hours and then you go home and do something else.

EDIT to add: Yeah, a career in something that bores you does suck. Your instincts are correct.

I think it's a huge leap to think that because you enjoy making a wildly illegal drug, you've found your calling.  Take a step back and look at what you found most satisfying about the experience. 

Here's what I find significant in your post:
1. You're ready to start your own drug lab tomorrow
2. You find yourself fascinated by the process itself
3. You don't particularly enjoy using it yourself
4. You believe it has the potential to be beneficial to others

The first one suggests that you're burned out on school. Burnout is accompanied by boredom and an overall lackluster existence, and you're young, so it's amplified. Doing something illegal is exciting. And there's a type of romanticism about building your own drug empire. It's glamorous in its own way, and thrilling when the stakes are so high--risking it all!

The second, third and fourth make me suspect you picked the wrong major, and chemistry and research may actually be your calling.

Combining all of them makes for a legitimate, lucrative, and legal career: pharmaceuticals. You're drawn to making and finding uses for a mind-altering drug, and you feel that it could help people live better lives. Well, you'll make a far wider impact by developing medicine that can be tested for safety, and prescribed to the people who need it most.

Bonus, you'll stay out of jail. 

My advice: stop researching Bitcoin and illegal storefronts and put that effort into learning about pharmaceutical R&D. Look into current research regarding LSD and magic mushrooms for the treatment of PTSD, and think about how many people you can help that way--soldiers, abuse survivors, people whose suffering needs more than just a temporary escape from reality."
Advice,fes3w88,t3_eq1won,1579361125.0,"In the United States, convicted sex offenders are placed on a registry. https://www.nsopw.gov/ . It's often referred to as Megan's Law. It's a flawed system here because it lumps in sex crimes of all kinds together, but if you find your friend on the list, that gives you a conversation opener.

Here's an article on a similar, more specific service in the UK: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-if-a-person-has-a-record-for-child-sexual-offences 

I would start with researching any official registries in your country, and then speak to your friend. If the website article you mention in your post does turn out to be factual, I feel you have a moral duty to inform your circle of friends if Will refuses to, in order to protect their children, and also so they can decide for themselves if they wish to continue their association with Will.

Good luck."

You're a dad and your little girl is growing up. If it wasn't leggings that make you uncomfortable, it would be something else she was wearing. It's not about her clothes, it's about her growing up.

Talk to her and let her know you're proud of seeing what an independent woman she is becoming. Talk to her about consent, and safe sex, and let her know she can come to you if she needs anything, including contraception, or if someone has made her feel unsafe, or if someone hurts her. If that's all a bit too much (understandable), make sure she has a trusted adult woman in her life that she can talk to about her health.

Good luck, Dad. You got this!"

That's mind-bogglingly, gorgeously wonderful! All using radiation in space! Which we didn't invent! That shit comes from charged particles and ionospheric radiation from the sun plus the magnetic field of Earth! Humans didn't make that.
