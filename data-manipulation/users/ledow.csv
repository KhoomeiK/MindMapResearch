Not being exposed to nuts, the antibodies/immunity information in your mother's blood isn't  transferred to baby, baby gets born, has no exposure and thus the first exposure triggers an allergic reaction as the immune system believes it's a foreign body.

If they'd been exposed to nuts in the womb, they'd inherit the mother's immunity, properly recognise the parts of the nuts in the blood that would trigger a reaction, and it would never be a problem.

What we have done over the last two generations is \*given\* a whole load of people a nut allergy by telling mothers to avoid nuts in pregnancy.  And now we have two generations of mothers who are allergic to nuts... which means they'll avoid nuts... and pass that allergy down.

This is why when I was a child, anyone with a nut allergy was very rare and it was extremely fatal.  Nowadays, every school has a dozen kids who have to carry epipens and the like to combat the allergic reaction.

And it is the people who are a threat, absolutely.  100%.  So let's not give those people... a lethal weapon designed to do NOTHING other than kill, especially if it's designed to do NOTHING other than kill lots of things quickly.

You don't need to ban everything.  What you do is ban things which have NO OTHER FUNCTION than killing things.  A gun has no such other function.  You use it to kill, or you use it to practice killing.  That's it.  That's its one, sole purpose.  Whereas most people who have a car aren't plotting murder with it.

And then you end up with situations which I explain thusly:

Terror attacks in London consist of fake weapons, and weapons that you can buy in the John Lewis kitchen department.

They are therefore, by definition, a lot less deadly than in countries where people have access to guns.

You can try to trot out cliches all you like.  TWENTY FIVE YEARS since the last school shooting.  Caused by a change in law on gun ownership (we still have it, it's just highly regulated).  Caused by absolute disgust and outrage at ""allowing"" a school shooting to happen in our country.

Terror attacks, even large-scale things, has since consisted of cars with gas bottles in them (been dealing with that since the 70's and the IRA).. a guy with an axe, a guy with a knife.

Why?  Because *THEY CANNOT GET HOLD OF GUNS*.  The US has more innocent people die in a single incident than we have from terror attacks in the last decade.  Because people *CANNOT GET HOLD OF GUNS*.  The one factor that multiplies the amount of deaths in any attack like that:  THE PRESENCE OF GUNS.

Guns do not solve the problem.  They are killing tools, that's their only purpose.  Guns just multiply the effect of whatever was going to happen anyway.  The nutters are still going to try to kill people.  But if they can't get hold of guns, and they can't get hold of grenades, and they can't get hold of tanks, and they can't get hold of rocket launchers, and they can't build fertilizer bombs... then those attacks, by definition, have to be scaled down.

Teach your kids to CHOOSE their assistant in such circumstances.  Don't wait for someone to approach them to ""offer them help"".  Teach them to choose, from the crowd, the person they want to have help them.

If a child is lost, alone, being followed, etc. then they CANNOT trust a random person who approaches them.  There is a much greater chances that said person has malicious intent or is actually an accomplice.

If, however, your child then goes and \*chooses\* a random stranger, they stand a far better chance of getting someone without such malicious intent.

It's quite similar to the Monty Hall problem, in effect.  The chance that an accomplice or attacker will approach you before a random stranger is HIGH.  The chance that you pick out that accomplice or attacker from a random crowd with free choice is incredibly LOW.

Teach your kids:  They can say no to anyone who approaches them.  They can literally say ""Sorry, I don't trust you.""  It's fine.  Anyone who is genuine will understand 100%.  But they can also go ""Actually, I want that guy there in the red jacket to help me, not you.""  And guy-in-red-jacket is almost always going to be a random human without malintent.

The other thing to teach them:  A crowd of helpers will more often be safe, involve several people, including officials, if you feel threatened.  The chances of random people allowing any one particular person to take charge of you is near zero, even if they claim to be your parent, especially if you object.

""I am frightened of you, I don't trust you.  I'm going to ask THAT person for help."" will scare off every kind of attacker or person with malicious intent, while genuine people will totally support such a decision.  If it doesn't, if they persist, you know instantly they are trying to get you on your own.

A random stranger in the street is far more likely to be helpful, even in the most extreme of circumstances.  There's no need to be scared of ""strangers"".  Just strangers that YOU HAVE NOT CHOSEN.

Adults instinctively know this, but don't express it to their children, so when they get lost, afraid, isolated, followed, attacked, they don't know where to turn because those other people are strangers too."

After a month of being on the wishlist, you're allowed to buy them.

When Christmas/birthday comes and people ask ""what you want"", give them access to the wishlist.

Now, if you want, you can buy things that have been on there a while.  But you'll find that stuff lingers on there forever.  And sometimes you remove it before you ever buy it.

But, sure, if it comes up on a deal and is half the price it was originally, consider it.

But if you're \*saving\* money, you either a) don't buy anything or b) stay within a set budget for non-essential purchases (which includes entertainment, eating out, etc.).

With b) you can end up buying something because it comes up on discount and celebrate.  It came within your expendable budget!  Help yourself!  Just don't over-spend.

Budgeting is really easy.  Work out what you need to spend / save.  Stick to it.  And always include a \*small\* fixed bit of expendable budget.  Why?  Your mental health.  Speaking from experience, it can be dangerous to budget down to the penny and leave yourself nothing.  That leads to you not being able to afford to do anything that makes you feel human.  If you follow it strictly, no matter how many ""free"" activities you think you can fill your time with, you'll end up in a damaging stressful position, mentally.  And if you don't follow it strictly, what's the point?  You'll just cheat if you don't do it.

explainlikeimfive,ffa872m,t3_esi9rv,1579729774.0,"The chargers generally contain a capacitor, often used for smoothing the rectified AC electricity to DC.  When you convert AC to DC, you end up going from a sine wave (voltages goes up to positive, down to negative, up, down - and it looks like a perfect wave on a graph of voltage) to a bumpy DC (imagine flipping that wave so that all the ""under"" bits are on top too... it looks like a repeated camel's hump of voltage).

To smooth it out, you include a capacitor.  This stops the bumpy curves of immediately dropping voltage which are forming the bumps, and you end up with something more constant in terms of DC voltage.

To do this, the capacitor stores energy briefly.  So when it's at the top of the hump, the capacitor gives out its stored energy which smooths the drop.  When the voltage goes up, the capacitor recharges.  Overall effect is a very good and stable voltage from a very wide and varying voltage.

However, when you turn off the power, there's still some power in the capacitor for a little while, and that's often enough to power the LED (or even the entire charger) for a few seconds afterwards.

Trust me, it's not just you.  I dragged one ex out of debt, just the same - including 2000% APR doorstep cash loans, etc.  I did it by paying her debts for her, but we never co-signed anything until we bought a house and then I checked what I was signing (believe it or not, she was legally trained, but I still checked what my liabilities were, and she needed my permission to put any debt on the house beyond that).

It's also generally frowned upon to \*admit guilt\* to your lawyer and then expect them to plead your innocence.  They will likely advise you not to say things like that, or to change your plea to guilty.

That would likely be via a roundabout ""I'm sorry, are you admitting guilt to me, thus putting me into a position where I couldn't ever represent to the court that you're innocent?"" kind of way that most people would take the hint and say ""Oh, no, I mis-spoke, I didn't do it, honest"" even though everyone involved knows exactly what's going on.

A lawyer can't knowingly lie to the court.  But given that attorney-client privileges means all such discussions are private even from the courts themselves, there's no (easy) way to prove that they are doing so.  If, however, you said you were guilty and stabbed him with a knife you buried <here> and your lawyer then tries to act as if he weren't aware of that evidence when it comes up later, there is a massive legal problem.  He can't just ignore that fact, necessarily.

Tip:  Don't put your lawyer in that position.  If you want them to prove your innocence, don't tell them you're guilty (and vice-versa!).  They won't appreciate it.

If they think you're guilty, they're supposed to still represent your interests (e.g. a lenient sentence) but to do that they'll expect you to plead guilty.

What they'll do is claim ignorance, even though they are more than smart enough to know what's going on, and advise you to plead guilty if you say you are.

It's one thing to be sickened at the state of the world and cry out for a new one, but entirely another to fight a personal battle with trying to be seen to be happy (with comments like your own), having the one small event mar your larger, prepared and planned efforts, or even realising that you yourself have actually stopped caring and now need to implement a faux-personality that cares in order to fit in.

Though I'm sure that there's a lot of ""celebration"" - if you like - of having certain aspects, which you can see in everything from autism to depression, the overall problem isn't that you're not happy, or not trying to be happy.  It's that you're not \*naturally\* happy about things.  Your brain literally isn't seeking, enjoying or seeking to repeat happiness.  It's there to be found, but it doesn't want to.  Either because the reward is small and required falseness to obtain, or because there is no reward for it.

And then people say ""Oh isn't it a beautiful sunset, though"" and you're not thinking ""Yes, but what about the Middle East situation?"".. you're thinking... is it?  It looks a lot like a lot of sunsets that I've seen before.  What's beautiful about it?  The colours?  I've seen those colours before.  And after a while you're not seeing the beauty because your mind isn't triggered by the event... much like Laurie and his demolition derby.  It's happening \*out there\*.  Whereas \*in here\* there's little transference.

Depression can sometimes be like watching a movie of your own eyesight.  You see everything, just the same.  You see others get excited, on-camera.  You understand the concept and the reason \*they're\* happy.  You just... don't have that, because you're watching a movie of your life instead of feeling it.  And it's not just a case of ""choosing"" to feel it.  It's just a 2D screen to you.  You may not ever be able to experience it, like the people who you're ""filming"" actually do.  You can fake it, the same way an actor can make you think he's upset when he's not.  But the feeling itself is disconnected from the reality.

But it's not your choice as to whether you can feel things or not.  It could well be that that's permanent and unfixable, even in the people who've had response to treatment.  They may just choose to stay in the cinema because it's less hassle than trying to live in the real world with other people pushing them to medical intervention that doesn't work for them.

Imagine living your life by watching a through-the-eyes movie of your life, even if it is interactive (i.e. your choices affect what happens on-screen).  But apart from the vision and sound, your senses and emotions are disconnected.  Sometimes they might come through a little, the same way people cry at movies, but you're always aware that you're watching a movie, not actually witnessing Bambi's mother die.

You feel disconnected.  Unimportant.  Detached.  Not a part of the world.  Ambivalent towards consequences.  And the ""fix"" that everyone tells you is some doctor in the ""cinema world"", inside the screen himself, trying to tell you that you need to feel your emotions that you're detached from... that are completely outside the scope of the cinema and any experience it can provide to you.  Food is... food.  You eat it.  Does it taste great?  Meh.  It's food.  The sunset is pretty for five seconds, but it's just an image.  The music is okay but after a while it's just sounds.  The lover is beautiful and tender and caring but they're still the other side of the screen and you can't feel certain things for them even if you want to.

It's a debilitating isolation, in your own head, against which ""Oh, just snap out of it"" or ""you need to go bungee-jumping so you feel alive again"" or whatever doesn't figure.  That's how you can watch cars smash and explode and, in your head, be doing the equivalent of eating your dinner on your lap and reading the newspaper while it happens on the screen in front of you.  It loses the connection, and finding it again isn't necessarily even possible, let alone guaranteed.

If you're intelligent, you can see it happening and understand that it's not ""normal"" (which doesn't mean it's not prevalent and common, but just not how you ""should"" feel), but it doesn't mean that there's a fix at all.

And things like suicide, for example, then become a way to... end the boredom, in effect.  If this is your whole life, where food doesn't taste, and beauty doesn't inspire, and even while making people laugh and laughing yourself you're actually inside your head looking out and not feeling that laugh... then it doesn't feel a loss to let it go.

It's a dangerous and serious condition, but it's not a case of being unhappy, and it's not as easily fixed as just doing things that generally make people happy and looking for joy in them.  If anything, it's an overanalysis until exhaustion and familiarity, and then boredom at the way you've disassembled the entire universe into understandable parts and, in doing so, destroyed the joy of the magic trick they once held."

LifeProTips,ff5kz68,t3_ernppb,1579597930.0,"I ate in a steakhouse in London the other night.  It cost me about £100 all-in.  It's not something I do very often.

The waiter seemed desperate for me to have some sauce.  I don't like sauce.  I didn't want sauce.  They were obviously used to giving people sauce.  I don't want any.

He asked how I wanted the steak done.  Well done.  That means no pink visible, whatsoever, in any way,  I'm sure people will recoil in horror at that suggestion, but I don't want uncooked food, and I've never accepted pink steak in the same way that I've never accepted pink chicken.  Call me heathen, but I've never had food poisoning, not even once.

And when I'm paying £100 for the fucking steak... I will have what I want.  I'm more tempted to ask for mint-sauce, to be honest, which I adore, but ketchup is fine.  The whole class thing is about how you do it.  Are you just squirting Heinz loudly out of the bottle in huge globs and smearing everything in it?  Yeah, you're not really getting the value there.

Do you have a small pot of ketchup and you're dipping some choice bits of it in there?  That makes more sense.

Your upbringing doesn't modify your tastes, but it does your manners.  Your manners can be changed and learned without having to modify your tastes.  I know a guy who would out-manners you at any dinner.  He loves white bread soaked in balsamic vinegar.

This is actually one of the reasons that I just don't eat curry.  Totally obliterating the taste of the thing you've bought under a cheap, pungent spice doesn't seem worth the effort.  Just have a glass of curry sauce and have done with it, man.  But I bet a load of people now pile-on about how much they love fine-dining AND curry.

Also... you have no idea why they're doing that.  I \*hate\* sauces (or even food) with unknown ingredients.  Not because I'm some vegan, allergic, sustainable, pretentious twat.  I don't like eating food that I don't know what taste to expect.  I don't like things in / near my mouth that I don't know what they are (several of my ex- partners had to learn to \*tell\* me what they were baking \*before\* sticking the mixture in my mouth after I had arguments with them about it... I know you were trying for the cute movie moment where I guess what it is or say how good it is, but don't make me taste things that I don't know what they are).

Additionally, apart from that, I also can choke on certain foods.  It's not every time, but I have a slight obstruction in my throat and sometimes I have to soak food in something to help it slip down or it stops in my throat.  It rarely affects breathing, but it makes my throat very uncomfortable, can stop me talking, and about 50% of the time it happens, it results in a 10-15 minute period where I can't talk, swallow or cough it back up, resulting in mucus build-up to try to shift the obstruction, and can only be cleared by going and vomiting back up for 5 minutes or more until the obstruction clears.  And when that happens, my meal is ruined, often completely regurgitated, and I just want to go home and not eat for the rest of the day.

So... don't judge \*what\* I do.  But you can maybe judge \*how\* I do it.  Having ketchup with your meal is no biggie.  Eating it like a slob and wasting food is."

My friend lived on the QE2 for several years.  He was a passenger at first, but then got a job with them teaching classes onboard.  He was given a staff cabin which he wanted to decorate for Christmas.

They are tiny little cabins, so he pulled out his stuff and put it in the corridor while he decorated the cabin.  Various things happened.  He was asked to move it to unblock the corridor, which he obliged, this meant having to leave the cabin and walk with his gear elsewhere, while still trying to decorate it.

In the process, some of his stuff disappeared.  I don't mean little things, I mean an entire old-fashioned trunk full of his worldly belongings.  Not just clothes or stuff, but everything you can imagine that you would take with you if you were effectively homeless and went on a world cruise.

It turned out that Cunard had picked his stuff up, thinking it was out for rubbish, and threw it away.  He went to the relevant people, expecting it to be in some hold somewhere until they made port.  He explained the situation.

They'd tossed it all overboard, without even looking inside.  A huge wooden trunk, the whole belongings of a person, bags and bags and bags of stuff... all gone straight in the sea within minutes.

Cunard gave him thousands of pounds in vouchers in compensation, which he gave me for a honeymoon.

The answer's going to be yes, for an awful lot of people.  Teachers are human, and have a really rough job with mostly unsympathetic clients (the students).

Everything from being talked to like shit by students and not expecting that (yes, it's a little bit of a wake-up call of the reality, but it can be very shocking to new teachers or teachers changing from better schools), to unnecessary pressures at work, to literally being put into impossible positions with senior management yelling at them and threatening their jobs for doing not two completely incompatible things that two people demand of them, to just having had bad news and the kids play up in unfortunate ways to remind them mid-lesson.

I would be concerned to work in a workplace where people haven't cried at work in their career lifetime.  It would worry me that they were all as emotionally detached as I am, for example.

I used to park several hundred yards away where it was more likely I would get a space (there's only so many times you can spend half an hour trying to find a space near where you want to go and have to spiral further out until you manage to get one... it's better to drive straight to the place where you know you can always get a space).

Given that the road was open-parking, there wasn't a particular dearth of spaces, it wasn't a place that people used to, e.g. park to pop to the shops etc. so it wasn't a persistent problem for the residents.  It was a quiet road, with parking, and houses/flats only on one side of the road (which had their own off-road parking).

Some guy obviously took exception to my parking in ""his"" space a couple of times.  I kept getting stroppy notes.  I just ignored them - this was a public road, I was obstructing nobody, I wasn't jamming up the road or making it difficult to traverse, and not breaking any laws.  And I was doing it to get to work from home after a 30-mile commute.

I just kept throwing the notes away.  Then one of them threatened criminal damage to my car (I wasn't the only person doing this, I'm sure, because I saw other notes).  I reported it.  I wrote a reply, and attached it to the nearby lamppost.

This was pre-dashcam general availability, but I worked in IT.  My note basically said:

If you have a problem call the police or council.  We all know that they'll tell you that you have no rights to dictate who can park on a public road.  So you'll have to put up with it, or buy a garage / parking space.  However, my car is monitored, has recording cameras and alerts my phone if it is touched \[this was pre-smartphone, but I had a tracker with text activation on motion / alarm and Mini-ITX PC in the boot with cameras... it wasn't all set up but I was perfectly capable of building such a system\] and if I spot criminal damage, we all know who's writing these notes and who has threatened criminal reparations for a perfectly legal act.  I will prosecute, at my own expense, quite happily over this petty parking matter if you escalate it to criminal damage.  Also, if you do damage \*anyone else's\* car, or threaten to do so, I will provide evidence against you.

However, it's not ""your road"" (you just live on it), certainly not ""your space"" (you just like to park there), and I will report you for littering if you keep attaching threatening signs to people's cars.  If you'd like, I also speak to the councillor for your local transport quite often as part of my job and if you really wish, I will petition along with you to make this road allocated permit parking only.

Which would fuck us both up and you'll end up having to do what we do - park further away outside someone else's house, unless you feel like paying for an allocated spot, a garage or an annual resident's permit and permits for every visitor you have.

P.S. Your car tax expired last month.  That \*is\* an offence which could get your car towed and you'll have to pay recovery and a fine.  I hope the police have no cause to visit this street.

Strangely, I didn't get any more for the year or so that I parked there every working day."

AskReddit,feuadxy,t3_eqmhuh,1579384669.0,"I have never, and probably will never, have belief (let alone ""faith"") in any mystical deity.  As such, I always considered it a nonsense.  No more than the tooth fairy, Santa Claus, ghosts, alien UFOs, or Harry Potter.

I honestly remember, as a child, having several WTF moments when I realised that some adults were actually \*serious\* and believed in a religion.  Like, really... are ya kidding me?  In at least one case, when I was disparaging the concept of religion, someone who I just assumed was far, far, far smarter than that tried to tell me off for assuming he would just be non-religious based on his scientific, logical leanings.

I mean... sure... bad to prejudge and jump to conclusions and just assume, but it was definitely a WTF moment even as an adult.  I actually considered them in a worse light past that moment, and it's never been the same since (he then married a very religious woman, and I have almost nothing to do with either of them).

I'm agnostic - I consider the very question of ""what fairytale creature do you believe exists?"" and especially ""which fairytale creature do you put all your faith in to run your life?"" absolute nonsense.  If pushed for an opinion, I think you can tell - I'm atheist.

I'm quite happy to have the religious conversation, I've had some really interesting conversations with very religious people.  As the saying goes, one of my best friends is ultra-religious.  But... there's a kind of enforced disconnect.  We both ""think"" the other is talking nonsense in certain regards, but we just move to another aspect of the conversation that provide more interesting scope for interpretation.

But like the examples I provided above - there have been times in my life when I've thought that monsters might be under my bed, or a ghost making noise.  It's just that I always sought the rational cause.  In one instance, I heard things in my bedroom when I was a child.  My parents totally dismissed them, after several nights of me getting them to come and hear because it was scaring me.  I couldn't prove it to them but I believed the evidence of my own ears and couldn't rest - not because I needed a supernatural explanation, but because I KNEW there was something nearby making the noise and disturbing my sleep.

It was a few weeks later that my parents discovered that some bugs that had been swarming in the garden, destroying an apple tree, were actually living in the chimney overnight... blocked by a vent just inside my bedroom from getting any further and making noises as they tried to get round it.. but going silent whenever noise or light of humans stomping around was happening.

As I've grown up, I've always gone for the logical/rational and never been disappointed or remained mystified for very long.  I still have moments of unexplained / scary things but I am shocked how often people attribute such things to ghosts, or whatever else, and then seem... satisfied with their answer.  ""Oh, yes, our house is haunted"" and that's the end of it.  Er... no.  Let me stomp around in it for a month, I'll find the source of every one of those strange sounds, weird draughts, or whatever else you claim - or they'll magically disappear in my presence no matter what I do to disturb/not disturb them.

I object to the very concept of a god that keeps score, a god that hurts others, a god that allow people to hurt others, a god that apparently will punish me but not others doing a lot worse, a god whose main clauses include ""Hey, don't listen to those other guys, I'm the only real god!"".

If such a god exists and wants to judge me post-life, bring it on.  So long as I'm allowed to judge them by the exact same criteria.  I know who's gonna win that one, even if they throw one of their typical prejudicial strops and consigns me to some kind of hell environment.

AskReddit,feu6ahs,t3_eqmen5,1579383511.0,"MACs are manufacturer-assigned (you can tell who's been allocated a MAC by the first few digits of it).

IPs are assigned by the network (e.g. your workplace, school, etc.).  IPs can thus be logical - for instance you can have all your devices between 1 and 100, all your printers from 100 to 200, etc. to make things easy.

IPs are world-routable.  MACs are not (you can't just ""send data to a particular MAC on the other side of the world"").

The ""join"" between MACs and IPs is usually DHCP.  Which assigns a particular IP on your particular network to the device.

They are different size addresses, for different purposes, to allow you to do two different things.  MAC identify a particular device.  IPs allow you to talk to a particular ""thing"" (which can be changed at any time to another particular device) with a human-readable well-defined number that's unique to your particular choice of assignment.

Generally speaking, you have no need to ever know the MAC of any device that's not on your own network.  Your ISP doesn't know your device MACs (maybe the gateway, but that's all).  You don't know the MACs of the rest of the world's network or your ISP.

We used the incident to get the laws changed.  People who had held arms for decades literally handed them in.  The society changed overnight to not tolerate it any more.  Private arms are now very difficult to come by, highly regulated and extremely rare.  I do not know a single person who owns a firearm of any kind.  I've never shot one.  I've never seen one except on a police officer, and then only at airports.

The kids now have grown up without even knowing a Dunblane.  The kids who were the same age have lived their lives and sent their children to school without one in the entire country.  But we see America and somehow live in fear of becoming that kind of country.

They basically just wanted to sell the book, they'd brought dozens of copies of it, and to excuse that blatant sell-out they gave a small talk beforehand about their ""celebrity"".

Setting up for the after-event, myself and another guy were required to put in place certain things, and show them how to use them.  Literally, it takes seconds, we're in and out.  I send the other guy, because I'd already heard a couple of things this guy said on the way in, with his ""entourage"" of agent, driver, etc. (and we're really talking some minor guy that nobody would know).

My colleague goes to the place where the speech was, sees the whole entourage chatting away, but needs to identify <celebrity> to give him something and show him how to use it.

""So,"" he says ""which one of you is <celebrity>""

Apparently he was then easily identifiable because he was absolutely fuming that someone didn't know who he was.

I had a similar experience (but this is less unusual) with a complete non-celebrity artist who came to the school.  He gets invited to show his making some pieces live, talk about it a bit, then go.  Nothing unusual or that pretentious.

He was simply the rudest person I have ever met in my life (and that's saying something).  He made diva-ish demands, kept trying to shame us into doing things because ""all the *other* schools never had a problem"" with his diva-ish whims, and generally acting like a right twat.    Sure, he was a decent artist.  His work probably sells for, what, a thousand or so a piece in some pretentious London gallery.  You won't have heard of him, because nobody has, and he's not at all famous or regarded.  You'd have problems even Googling him.

Endangering yourself to rescue your child is inherently selfish.

Maybe you'd be concerned enough to get to the school gates, ask other parents and investigate.  Hell, maybe even call the police and ask what's happening.

But literally walking into a school, up to a classroom, in lockdown, with lockdown alarms STILL sounding, the classes deliberately blockaded from inside (I disagree with certain parts of this concept, but that's another story), the lights off, the blinds down... deliberately to *avoid* revealing where people are... and bashing the door to be let into a class full of scared children on alert specifically drilled to be wary of ""people who might try to get into your classroom to harm you"" is the stupidest thing I can ever imagine.

They did more damage that day to those children's psychology than every lockdown drill we've ever had.  And it wasn't isolated.  Ten sets of parents.  If there was a lockdown for anything, a gunman, a tornado, anything, they have literally just added to the death toll.

A school is a place filled with other parents - from the caretaker to the top rungs of management.  We're not going to act against your child's best interests in an emergency scenario.  They're not alone in a huge place without adults prepared to literally sacrifice themselves for any of the children.  But I'm not going to be sacrificing myself for a grown adult stupid enough to walk into a potentially lethal scenario to try to rescue ""their"" child and put every other one at risk by doing so.

Yes, there's emotion, and love, and the desire to know they're okay.  And there's also jumping into a burning building when the child was already rescued from the back window and endangering yourself and others who now have to come rescuing you.
