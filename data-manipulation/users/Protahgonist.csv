AskReddit,ffx57nx,t1_ffx3t6q,1580318000.0,"Did you know that Ozymandias is the name of two different poems? They were published together by Shelley and his lesser known friend, Horace Smith. Smith's *Ozymandias* goes like this:


 IN Egypt's sandy silence, all alone,

      Stands a gigantic Leg, which far off throws

      The only shadow that the Desart knows:—

    ""I am great OZYMANDIAS,"" saith the stone,

      ""The King of Kings; this mighty City shows

    ""The wonders of my hand.""— The City's gone,—

      Nought but the Leg remaining to disclose

    The site of this forgotten Babylon.



    We wonder,—and some Hunter may express

    Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness

      Where London stood, holding the Wolf in chace,

    He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess

      What powerful but unrecorded race

      Once dwelt in that annihilated place."

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffwj5mn,t1_ffwidnb,1580302731.0,"Lesser known fact is that many of the children mentioned were taken at designated legal crossing points, designed for people to come and apply to enter legally. This can happen if those attempting to enter with children lack all the legal documentation to prove who they are and their relationship to the children in their care. This can almost be interpreted as a good thing, but it does result in many children being separated from their actual parents or guardians when they simply lack any such documents due to the circumstances which caused them to undertake the journey in the first place."

So very small magnetic objects only experience a small magnetic force. This is why MRIs don't yank the iron right out of the molecules in your blood."

I know a handful of people that became really proficient in the language just by living and working there for a long time, but the folks that do that *and* go to a Chinese University and study formally are just head and shoulders above everyone else, and they open a lot more opportunities for themselves by being literate and well spoken."
