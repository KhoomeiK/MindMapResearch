Sandwiches may not be one of them.

An IP lawyer is probably overkill. A standard lawyer with a small/family practice in your town, with some small business experience is probably a fine place to start."

That it makes builds more similar and reduces variation is a valid complaint.

But this would be like if ONLY A FEW RIFLES could use serration. Then there would be no reason to use anything but those rifles.

That’s what’s going on here."

I’ve been playing since steam release, have a headset with a mic, and have yet to hear another humans voice in matchmade activities.

I swear I’ve gone in settings and toggled everything even related to chat one way or another to see if it would let me talk to people, but I’m pretty sure I’m playing with mutes."

Did you not read the part of OPs post where they said: “I’ve disputed these charges 4 separate times”

legaladvice,fcl899u,t1_fckz0k6,1577741949.0,"Lol, I like how this message effectively advertises to the OP that someone recommended they post on social media.

Mods you may want to reconsider the bold phrasing of this automod message, it’s essentially a big bold green add “did you think about using social media?”

I understand why it’s (rightfully) against the rules, I think the better option would be to delete such comments, and not mention social media in the automod message."

assholedesign,fcl6dcr,t1_fckjufd,1577740777.0,"Incorrect - at least in the US.

It’s a technical point, but an important one: YOU ARE NOT BREAKING THE LAW. You are breaking a contract. That is a civil matter. They can sue you, or try and send the debt to a collector, but it is NOT a crime and the police are in no way involved.

But “not much” is also just plain wrong. Please don’t discourage people here from taking the steps necessary to stand up for themselves.

OP - file complaints with the OCC and CFPB. It will take a while, and is a bit of a pain, but that generally bumps the complaint up to a team of semi-competent specialists that are much better at resolving things like this.

Alternatively, try setting up a meeting with a branch manager at a local bank. Explain everything to them, and let them know that if it isn’t resolved you will be filing CFPB & OCC complaints.

Banks really hate those complaints. Get enough of them and they can get in the way of lucrative mergers, acquisitions, and market expansions (I used to work at one)."

I have a friend who is a lawyer. I’d call them as a starting point. But it’s soon to be 20fucking20. I am a reckless youth(ish). I don’t have phone numbers memorized. I assume you don’t get to use your cell phone contacts to make the call from jail. 

Do they just walk you to a pay phone, and laugh their asses off, knowing that hardly anyone has phone numbers memorized these days?

Would love some advice from police or lawyers. I always hear the advice “just call a lawyer” but no one has actually explained the details."

Start slow. Build the habit of walking everyday. It’ll naturally strengthen your legs, and when you begin to loose weight, and want to start jogging, you’ll have the added benefit of already be in the habit of exercising. Building that habit is 80% of the battle."
