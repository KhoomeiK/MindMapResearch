That was the sales pitch... minus the drowned city part at least, but that thought didn’t really calm my nerves now that I was one of maybe two dozen people in the sprawling subsurface metropolis. 

Fortunately, the main financial group backing the city didn’t elect Atlantis for the name of the city. It was a Chinese firm, and they had a few more superstitious members on their board. Instead there City was named something in Chinese which we were told meant ‘hope’. I was one of the first members of the maintenance staff that had arrived after construction had unofficially been completed. 

Hope had been designed to house around 2 million people. Covering about a hundred square miles, it consisted of an interconnected ring of domes that were each covering about 2 square miles each. It was as much a social experiment as it was a last ditch effort for the human race to continue growing in spite of climate change and the rising ocean levels. 

Hope’s domes were situated a few hundred miles off of the coast of Hawaii in warm international waters, temperature was a comfortable 73 degrees Fahrenheit, year round, thanks to a combination of ocean currents and geothermal wells that the city conveniently drew on for electricity. Or at least it had been.

3 days ago after the 1st wave of inhabitants arrived, disaster struck dome Gamma-9, which houses the main geothermal power plant. Officially, the disaster was reported as a miscellaneous structural failure, with no deaths or injuries reported. Realistically, there had been seismic activity, and a catastrophic structural damage to the majority of the domes, 7 of which were reclaimed by the ocean. Death toll was estimated at around 15,000, but honestly the investors had all the say on what got reported, since it wasn’t like any government was about to do much more than send supplies. 

The successfully evacuated people would be silenced as soon as they returned to China. They were largely poor people from rural areas that had been promised a brand new home in a clean, modern city with a fresh job. The PRN had entire fleets watching and controlling the area, to make sure unwitting Samaritans didn’t try to help and make the discovery of how serious a problem we were having beneath the waves. 

As a structural engineer, I was ordered to survey the damage in an attempt to plan out how to repair the domes, but at these depths you had to use a micro submarine. 

The hatch shut and I clambered into the seat that was just behind a monitor. A camera related information in real time. 

“Comm check”

“Reading loud and clear” I reported.

“Orders from up top are to assess Dome Gamma 9 before we run out of auxiliary power”

I mean that’s not entirely accurate. You can make a pretty good assessment about some world event based on how he reacts to it. The man is smug, but it’s not like he’s significantly more intelligent than any average person. Acting like there’s some grand scheme behind his ranting and raving is a curious proposition, because the man can’t even remember names to the CEO’s of industries he’s attempting to protect. I think that what we are witnessing is some sort of weird situation in which a grown ass man has roughly a third of his brain stuck at the developmental levels of a toddler. He exercises little to no self control especially when it comes to his social media use. Is constantly caught in various lies of varying scope, and yet he hasn’t managed to do permanent damage at the scale that most feared, at least not yet.

projectcar,fdhy2pu,t1_fdfyhvl,1578432248.0,You can find 2014 Fiesta STs for 10 grand or less. Likely a few dozen rebuilt title options that would be price competitive with the Yaris at this point as well.

Aquariums,fdektv1,t1_fdd9gkx,1578341154.0,"You’d need to plant the tank, but here’s another idea:

50-70 mosquito rasboras or emerald eye rasboras.

80-100 or so low quality dwarf shrimp (red cherry/blue velvet etc)

1 male betta (if you can find one at an LFS that isn’t super aggressive)

You could also throw in ottos or a pleco to help the shrimp with cleanup.

Break up the tank with plants and even if the betta is a little too aggressive it’s a large enough tank that whatever he might pursue has plenty of opportunity to hide and break line of sight."
technicallythetruth,fdecctf,t3_ekvbmf,1578335935.0,"I mean, we aren’t generally running on ‘dead dinosaurs’. Oil is made up of dead things, both flora and fauna. AFAIK, things have been dying on earth for a while so as long as that keeps happening, oil should technically be around for as long as life is, right?

Granted, his point about climate change are very real, and at some point our demand for it will far outstrip the supply of it but I’m not clear on whether or not we will ever run out of oil because, things still decompose after they die.
