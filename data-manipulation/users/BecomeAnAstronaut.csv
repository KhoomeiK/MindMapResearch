technology,fft9v06,t1_fft3ne9,1580213765.0,"I've said this before and I'll say it again:

*Microchip GPS tracking doesn't and cannot exist in the way movies portray it*. A GPS receives signals from satellites to determine (via trilateration) its position on the planet. This uses some (but not a lot) of power. *Sending that information somewhere else, like to an employer, would require a full communication system, inside the microchip*. This would require *significantly* more power (again, in a tiny microchip), as well as a set up that could *send* signals rather than just recieving them.

That's why you could never put a microchip in your dog and use it to tell you where the dog is. The dog needs to be found and the chip needs to be read.

At *best*, a microchip could perform GPS functions, storing location data to then be read when the employer next scanned the chip. But we don't have technology down to that scale either yet.

*You can't put a tiny little chip onto an object and then use that to remotely locate the object from anywhere in the world. The device would need to use its own power to send tracking information, which is why we CAN track phones and laptops*."

I can assure convection only works because of gravity.

Edit: Pressure has nothing to do with it because, de facto, the whole container is at the same pressure. The reason hot gasses expand and *get* lighter is because their pressure can't increase (which it would if the temperature increased but the volume couldn't)."

So it's actually a flexible renewable generator, rather than a pure storage system. I think, depending on he proportion of energy stored, there might be some advantages to considering a Generation-Integrated set-up, rather than a traditional generation + storage one. But as I say, that depends on several factors:

* Proportion of all energy passing through storage.
* Proportion of energy coming from local generation rather than from the grid.
* Expected conversion efficiencies."
