PackageDelivered,ffq7o8f,t1_fcxng5g,1580124800.0,Usually can't cancel an order if it has been delivered (even if to wrong address).
PackageDelivered,ffq7ku0,t3_elz9b3,1580124673.0,"You won't be able to pick it up if its not under your name. 

Also, I would look very close at whoever you bought it from if you paid for it online, as that should have never passed fraud checks if you used a debit/credit card."
Veterans,ffq6wy3,t1_ffpnket,1580123737.0,"I would think that IRR orders get mainly done when you have a skill that they find themselves in short of. For the most part, many people wont get orders unless they need bodies. 

Closest I ever got was a call after 9/11 but got excused from that when I pointed out I was ineligible for combat duty."
Veterans,ffq6nss,t3_eug2c4,1580123364.0,"The closest I ever came to being requested for a muster was a few days after 9/11.  Got a call from someone at the local armory who said that I was still listed as IRR and to be ready to report to the armory in a few days. 

I told them to double check why I was discharged, honorable but with injuries that disqualified me from combat, and after they did that I was told to not worry about it. 

At that point I still had about 5 more years IRR, yet never heard a peep out of them."
techsupport,ffq4f3q,t1_ffq3qgu,1580119874.0,"12+ years in web hosting industry, I would never host something that important on a ""home server"". 

You may have misunderstood a bit, I run a colocated server with a standard Centos whm/cpanel stack. 

Course I include proper security into it (such as the back-end / shell is accessible only from my home IP), cycle the drives every couple years (gotta love ""remote hands"" sometimes), and have incremental backups that duplicate to my local server (via SSH over custom port and using keys), then those backups get stripped to ""just the necessities"" periodically and stored to DVDs (I don't have a lot of data to keep long term).  

The host I got the server from makes things simpler because you can ""rent to own"" the server.  After a couple years it is yours to do with as you please, however I have been using them for about 6 years now.

EDIT: I have lots of free time these days, I find the IT security end of things fun (although I have been putting off migrating to new version of CentOS)."
Vive,ffq3tit,t1_ffnjef1,1580118913.0,Maybe.
Vive,ffq3rif,t1_ffmmc3w,1580118824.0,"Don't remember the game, but in the game I had to throw something really high.  

Didn't work the first few times so I figured I needed to jump for extra distance so I did it full out. 

I stand 5'10"", jumped a good foot or so, the ceiling of the room was about 8 feet. 

My wrist hurt for a week."
Vive,ffq3n51,t1_ffp7h25,1580118628.0,That is just what they want you to think.
Vive,ffq3i05,t1_ffn7cnh,1580118396.0,I can neither deny nor confirm the above statement.
slavelabour,ffq3c8h,t1_ffpz2c3,1580118138.0,How about naming it after someone in political office?
thalassophobia,ffq2yuq,t1_ffo1g0v,1580117535.0,Most likely was.
CrazyIdeas,ffq2jbq,t1_ffpoa4v,1580116853.0,IRS would be on top of that so quick.
