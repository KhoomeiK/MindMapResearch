The first time you put your foot down and don't have to wait for a transmission to downshift you'll be sold. Not having to go to the gas station is also fantastic. Every time you leave your home the car is fully charged.

[Here is a pretty good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXkRcuwoIm4) detailing why a modern EV (namely the model 3 in this video) is the best daily driver.

Mine is a first gen EV. The i-MiEV is the first mass produced one as far as I can tell, and yes it's a compromise. Honestly though, I'd have compromised so much more.

Modern EVs are barely a compromise. You're compromising on price if you buy new, and road-trip capabilities (but that's been changing rather quickly)."

Winnipeg,ffaas3m,t1_ffa5cu6,1579731240.0,"If you spend $400/year in gas I'm assuming you don't drive the national average of ~15k/year.

You would save on maintenance as you do not have an engine or transmission to maintain. You could expect to save somewhere between 80 and 95% of your fuel costs. 

Without knowing what vehicle you own though, it's hard to provide an answer to your obtuse question."
Winnipeg,ff9xnep,t1_ff9uwr0,1579723735.0,"A $4k econobox, assuming it gets 8-10L/100km city would still cost in the $1500-$2000 range per year for gas. A typical ICE vehicle costs about $1000/year to properly repair/maintain. Given that my EV doesn't have an engine or transmission, I only need to take brakes and suspension into account which should be more like ~$300/year assuming it actually needs anything at all.

I've owned nearly 40 vehicles in my lifetime so far. I am intimately familiar with the ins and outs of ownership costs. Nothing comes close to an EV. The savings on fuel and maintenance are drastic - in the 90-95% range on fuel alone. Even compared to an extraordinarily economical 3cyl ""econobox"" that gets 6L/100km an EV still costs 80% less per year to drive assuming nothing breaks on your econobox."
Winnipeg,ff9t0zo,t1_ff9rtqf,1579720621.0,"I also picked it up after selling a vehicle I was making payments on, meaning I don't have a car payment anymore. Insurance is  significantly less too. The cost of driving is less than 2c/km for electricity instead of ~20c/km for gas.

I didn't get into specifics because my situation is not applicable to everyone else, but compared to the vehicle I had before I have saved ~$500 of insurance, ~$600 in gas, and ~$3500 in payments since August.

Not to mention I don't have to get oil changes anymore, there is no engine for me to maintain and no transmission. The amount I have to budget for my vehicles per month has dropped from ~$1000 to ~$200.

However I know how this will go.  I'm sure your ""BurnVegansForFuel"" username has nothing to do with your political and world views. Once someone pushes me for numbers I always get the same inane response: NoT eVeRyOnE wIlL sAvE tHaT kInD oF mOnEy.

That's why I stayed out of specifics. I get a ton of pushback from people who have a chip on their shoulders against EVs. From a purely economical standpoint though, it's been a huge win for me. Why pay thousands of dollars for gas every year when I could pay hundreds for electricity?"

Winnipeg,ff9qoke,t3_esd9oc,1579718875.0,"I have a 2012 Mitsubishi i-MiEV. It's old tech. The battery is only 16kwh. It uses a heater instead of a heat pump. It does not reflect modern EVs at all. When it's really cold outside I get 50-65km with the heat on full blast and it is good for ~95% of my driving needs. I have a shitty old truck that I use for hauling stuff and the odd time that the EV is low on juice (I rarely exceed 35km/day in driving). I've driven my i-MiEV nearly 3500km since I bought it in August. The cost is 1c-2c/km depending on if the heat is on. I've spent a grand total of maybe $50 in electricity. I've driven my truck less than 500km in the same time period and spent more than $75 on gas.

Without the heat I get over 100km of range. The car cost me $8600 and has saved me inordinate amounts of money.

With my 110v charger I get back about 10% of the battery per hour it charges. I find even my 110v charger won't charge on a typical block heater outlet. I plug into regular outlets that have nothing else plugged into them and it's fine. If I had a 240v outlet in my garage I'm sure I'd be using the car all the time but the cost of running wire that far just isn't worth it.

Don't buy a leaf. They lack any sort of thermal management (not even a cooling fan) so their batteries degrade in less than a decade. My i-MiEV is 8 years old and still gets just as good as new.

E-Golfs suffer from similar issues but less so. The e-Golf can't do multiple fast charges in a row. If you're buying electric consider the Soul EV (newest generation gets wicked range), Kia Niro EV or Hyundai Kona EV.

Tesla Model 3s are cool but there is no proper service center in Winnipeg so you're either shipping it for major repairs or waiting for a tech to fly in quarterly for minor repairs."
