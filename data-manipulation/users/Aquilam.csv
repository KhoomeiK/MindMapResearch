**Wrong**,  you just googled an answer and didn’t bother to comprehend what you were reading. There was no “US” back then, when they refer to “the Americas” they’re referring to the new world.

*the Americas* include all of North America, central and South America, so everything from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Argentina in Tierra Del Fuego.

>	pre-contact Americas to be as high as 112 million in 1492, while others estimate the population to have been as low as eight million. In any case, the native population declined to less than six million by 1650.


>	While it is difficult to determine exactly how many Natives lived in North America before Columbus,[6] estimates range from a low of 2.1 million to 7 million people to a high of 18 million.

Based on hunting/gathering, mild forms of farming, not to mention disease/war etc. the natives of what is now the US lived in vastly smaller numbers. You can’t support 100 million people simply through hunting/gathering even on a territory the size of the US."

Alright back to your lovely country, let’s check some [facts](https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-south-africas-crime-statistics-for-2018-19/): 

>	The number of murders in South African increased from 20,336 in 2017/18 to 21,022 in 2018/19. On average, 58 people were murdered every day. 

58 murders *a day* is pretty bad in and of itself, but when you remember that South Africa doesn’t have the death penalty and doesn’t imprison murderers for life (obviously SA has been against long prison sentences after what Nelson Mandela went through) they *can’t afford to imprison people for full sentences anyway*.

>	The police recorded 41,583 rapes in 2018/19, up from 40,035 rapes in 2017/18. This means an average of 114 rapes were recorded by the police each day.

>	The police recorded 170,979 assaults with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm in 2018/19 – up from 167,352 in 2017/18. This means, on average, 468 such assaults were recorded every day.

There’s also house robbery and burglary, carjackings....

In California homes aren’t required to fireproof but wooden shingle roofs and siding are practically illegal to be built now (you see them on older homes). It would be considered irresponsible to leave a pile of dried brush up against your house...flooding isn’t usually an issue but many places are hilly with built in drainage."

Obviously you can’t predict everything, but this person isn’t hurting for money and no doubt the vehicles will be replaced/reimbursed by insurance...

However, if you have that much money, why not build a house/garage that sits high enough to be immune from floods?

You spend $10 million on a home, do you have a fire alarm or a fire suppression system? 
If you live in a flood plain do you build at ground level or build up slightly...?"
