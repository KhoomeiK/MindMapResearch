What's funny is that the Colts tickets were going for about $20 during the preseason and early on since the Cowboys were doing awful and Luck was assumed to be out. The Luck came back and the Cowboys became a contender so tickets skyrocketed. It would have cost me around $1K for two tickets to see us get blown out."
