I had been listening to Rush for a few years before and my mom took my brother and I out of school to go see that show, because she never got to see them when she was young. What an unbelievable show. I'll never forget that show. They opened with Limelight, but I think the song Workin' Them Angels made the biggest impact on me. Just incredible craftsmanship and talent, the show was so funny too. I remember when the South Park boys came on the screens and did Tom Sawyer as lil Rush.

I'm so grateful she took me to that show."
rush,fdtwx1f,t1_fdsw485,1578723543.0,"I cried too. I'm only 28, but Rush has always been one of my favorite bands. They are one of the artists who inspired me to play music. I saw Rush in 2007 and I still think about that concert from time to time. They are beautiful musicians who understood the power of music. I honestly think his lyrics are better than his drumming, and he's a pinacle of talent on the drums. But man, his lyrics are something else."

My first job I ever had was a cart wrangler for a walmart in New Mexico, and while it is frustrating to have to pick up people's carts all the way at the end of the parking lot, this lady is obviously very uncomfortable and he is only making things worse. I admit that it's lazy to not simply walk your cart back, but harassing people doesn't make them correct their behavior."

tifu,fdpsbnh,t3_emgx3k,1578638573.0,"When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. She walked to the nursery and there in baby's crib was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter. The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward the baby, for they were mummies. Amongst them was a man, tall, slim. Almost instinctively she turned to her husband. ""Oh, wait,"" she thought, ""I don't have a husband."" For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night they slept one inch farther apart until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in an imaginary world. She had quit the book club, the choir, saying something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Every time she wanted to act and didn't and other parts of her face hardened until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, ""Baby, are you ok?"" Baby sat up slowly, turned to Mother and said, ""I'm fine Bitch. I'm fine."""
