What the fuck are you smoking. 

Thats over 50mm more armor pen. A 33% increase. There is less of difference between the 17pdr APDS and the SA50 AP. PT-76 gets saddled with a 200mm pen HEAT round at 5.3 and that thing lives in mortal fear of MGs.

Meanwhile if the M4A3E8 wants to frontally pen anything medium or up at its BR it needs to get decently close and hit weakpoints. Its the exact opposite of point'n'click because unlike the M4A4(SA50) you have to aim rather than just hover your cursor over them."

More than that, it gets the same exact gun as the AMX-13 gets at 6.3, has better performance than the gun of the Panther. Hell, if you want to really see how crazy the performance is, there is a smaller gap between the performance of the top SA50 AP round and the 17pdr APDS round.

That if you explain to me just how cool and flashy it was that I'll  not only overlook the serious narrative flaws that then follow and surround it, but somehow believe its the super bestests narrative ever.

I saw it, it was slick for the part that was on Crait. But the context they put it in did not work and only serves to undermined it."

A death whose legacy is a minor blip when held up against the lopsided damage the Resistance dealt against the First Order. 

Whats grander, more inspiring that you can beat the First Order after what happened? A few normal(ish) people much like yourself destroying the Starkiller, a juggernaut, Snoke's ship, and tens of Star Destroyers with only a handfull of ships? Or a disgraced legend showing up and trading his life away for a five minute distraction whose only damage is a bruised ego?

Talk about the suspense of disbelief it takes to believe the latter is more than the former if one doesn't simply take the screenwriters word for it. It only works if one just accepts it and does no thinking."

>Nobody knew Luke died

Rey and Leia felt it through the force, and then you know, Luke never showed up afterwards.

All in all, the entire thing feels like they hit the end of the film and then suddenly realized that they needed some way to explain how that ending scene somehow solved the problem statement at the beginning of the film and that they hadn't just spent the whole movie making zero progress on it. Because that totally doesn't minimize and ignore the legacy of all those who sacrificed their lives earlier in the trilogy to make Luke's death somehow the spark of hope they need and make it clear all those other things were just big, flashy explosions to please the crowds.

I watched the movie. Was not impressed with the amount of decisions that seemed to be built on spite."

""Really? Where is he, is he helping us now?""

""Oh, uh, well, he died""

""Hmmm. Hmmmmmm, I see""

It was a cinematic scene, but, it was pretty much purely for us in the audience and substantially less thought as to how it worked into the whole story. Which would have been okayish had they kept Obi Wan Kenobi where he is a mentor continuing in the Force and not massive Resistance icon that somehow everyone knows about despite how few people saw it and how much it pales in comparison to all the other exploits.

StarWarsLeaks,ffw1252,t1_ffvtm8h,1580279903.0,"Given the lore they gave for the First Order... probably little to no issue really. Some of the officers would probably not get wiped, but they were selected to be fanatics. A cover up from their side would be pretty damn easy.

Like, we've blown up a Juggernaut, several star destroyers, Snoke's super ship, the fucking ultra-super Death StarX5, but this is what gets people going? Luke the legendary Jedi dying just to buy a few moments for the Reb... I mean Resistance to just barely escape?

The scale is just so off, especially in the trades. A small militia pulled off all the former ones, albeit for heavy losses, but a fucking legend had to be traded for those few minutes."

All is pretty much lost.

Literally zero headway is made on this pressing issue.

For some reason, because blowing up Starkiller base isn't adequate to restore hope, they need to blow up Snoke's ship, which was never heard of before, and then Luke needs to sacrifice himself to save thirty people in event primarily witnessed by... the First Order. Then, and only then, can they bring back hope.

The movie just was not in a position like Empire Strikes back were it could do a character development and stories only plot built around solely failure. They already had failed the New Republic and Han as plot points to work from. Note, I'm not saying it can't feature any major failures, but it pretty much set the ST a movie behind in where in needed to be in terms of overarching narrative."

badhistory,ffstw22,t1_ffssj8b,1580192305.0,I'm okay with it be fairly quick and taking a couple of hours to days at max. But the way its implemented in the sequels is literally a couple seconds short of instant teleportation. A couple of hours gives you time for a battle to take place and to actually do something because frankly many times in war actual reinforcements aren't that far away. But that doesn't work when its instant teleportation and the numerically superior faction can just rapidly jump fleets everywhere. Or anybody just drop fucktons of people anywhere.

Ain't telling nobody shit despite the fact that at any point during her plan, a mole would fuck it all up because just knowledge they were fueling up the transports was enough to get them all killed.
