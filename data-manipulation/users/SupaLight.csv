Secondly when I mean treat them like humans? I mean treat them with respect. My original comment about treating them like humans refers to people treating them like freaks, disgusting, the spawn of Satan, etc. And as for the abuse part, you seem to forget that the LGBT community, especially trans and genderqueer people are very much victims of hate crimes, aka being abused, kidnapped, beaten, murdered, etc. Purely for being trans/genderqueer. So yes, treat them like humans."

How about instead of assuming why people identify as genderqueer/genderfluid you just let people live their life."
