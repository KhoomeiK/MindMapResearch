Dogtraining,ff8822i,t1_ff6ao9n,1579668687.0,"The collar i found has sound, vibration, and shock. The only time the shock setting is to be used is when the dog's safety is at risk...like when there is a chance of being hit by a car. However, we are in a location where we do not have to worry about cars. (I do not subscribe to the shock method of training a dog. I think it's unnecessary and cruel.)

I have found that when i put the collar on the deaf dog, I am able to guide three dogs at once. The hearing dogs pay attention to the sound and the deaf one is guided by the vibration.

When he is within sight i use a flashlight to get his attention. Therefore the collar does not get a lot of use. But it is there if needed."

AskReddit,ff6na3e,t3_erstu3,1579630829.0,"Who the hell cars what I am or not wearing if there is an emergency that requires an escape. If I am in danger I will do what I need to do. 

If I can grab a blanket that is not on fire I will be covered; if not, oh well... Someone might be kind enough to give me something to cover up with.

If there is an intruder, they will have 3 very protective dogs to get past. And if, God forbid, they kill my dogs, at least there will have been a distraction that might allow me time to escape. And, if I get out, I will not be hindered by clothing getting caught in things. I can worry about getting covered later when I am safe."
Dogtraining,ff6mlsb,t3_erudyr,1579630422.0,"I also have a deaf dog. I have been using ASL signs for the commands. Unlike my hearing dogs, he seems to pick up on commands very quickly.

I do have the advantage of two hearing dogs. Since they all enjoy the treats (food or contact praise), the hearing dogs do not want to be left out of any training sessions. I sign and say a command, the hearing dogs do what I ask to get the treats while the deaf dog sees what it takes to get that treat.

When I work with him alone, he is a fast learner. To discourage undesired behavior I watch him closely. Having him tethered to me with a leash helps. When he does something I do not want him to do, I react quickly and redirect him elsewhere. He seems to really want to please me and I am fortunate that I do not have to repeat lessons. This has worked with pulling at my laundry, picking pillows instead of dog toys, and housebreaking. The only one thing I still have to work on is chasing cats. (He is full border collie and wants them to go where ever it is he wants them to go.)

Others have posted very helpful comments and articles or training for desired behavior based on hearing dogs. These comments and articles can be adapted for a deaf dog using lights, vibration, and motions to get his attention.

The one thing I would recommend is using ASL signs on a foster dog because there is always a chance (even if very remote) he will be added by someone that is hearing impaired or has family members that are. The others that have suggested consistency make a valid point; it is key for any dog regardless of ability or disability. And while I am far from a pro or a trainer, I respect what I read here and use what I can. This is a wonderful community full of those that would rather see another succeed than hear of a dog being given up on."

AskReddit,fdkgmj6,t3_elq6wb,1578503454.0,Many years ago I rode my bicycle to and from work while living in Phoenix. One of my coworkers suggested I stop at a store along my route.

She said not to worry about them as they would not bother me but they might offer to sell me some drugs. And that is why they are not my kind of people. It did not occur to me why she had taken offense at me when I said that they were not my kind of people; the loiterers were all black as was my coworker and I am white. I truly meant they were not my kind of people because I am not into the drug scene.
