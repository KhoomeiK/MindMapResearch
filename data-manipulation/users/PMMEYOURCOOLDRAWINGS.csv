facepalm,ffegqnp,t1_ffegh6q,1579847365.0,Would you like to address the zero witnesses thing or just keep telling me to ignore what my eyes and ears are telling me just like trump said to his fan base. I watched it. I studied it. I work in politics. Do you think it is right to have zero witnesses at a trial? The ones that republicans complained weren’t allowed to be there before and after disallowing them to be there?
facepalm,ffeeyn3,t1_ffee4qp,1579845472.0,"He didn’t just presume. Him and every other person questioned said it was so obvious there was no way anyone could think otherwise. If you have a problem with these fact witnesses. Would you like to hear from the people that could clear this whole thing up under oath? Or are you of the camp that also believe witnesses don’t belong at a trial. You are aware that they voted to block any and all witnesses, including every single one they claimed were not allowed to speak at the house? If all is good and well and everyone can testify to trumps innocence why is there not a single one doing so? Not under oath at least. It’s a republican controller senate. You know the questions will not be hostile. But they have to answer under oath none the less or be charged with perjury or obstruction of Congress. Do you not think that’s weird at all? Every other impeachment trial had loads of witnesses. That’s how trials work. If the jury gets to decide that they already made up their minds and refuse to hear from the people involved, what does that say to you? I don’t assume you’re stupid, you have to see this. Why wouldn’t trump want himself and everyone involved to just go under oath and say their truths and be done with it. It would be over in a day. He will still get squirted and it would ease the kind of the American public, knowing that these people
Involved did their civic duty and spoke about the crimes alleged. Getting acquitted after obstructing every single possible avenue of discourse is shady as all hell. Do you not see that? What innocent person in their right kinds would say to a judge that they have loads of people who can prove them innocent but you can’t speak with them. In what world do you live in that that seems like normal behavior? These are not paid actors we are asking to hear from. These are deep, entrenched republicans who were personally selected by trump to work with him in the white House. But it seems that anyone he hand picked as the best people on the planet for the job have no recollection of almost any of their duties. Many are in federal prison right now. Now that doesn’t happen to every president. That’s a new one. Do you believe that all these hand selected people were just liberal plants? Planted by...Donald trump?"
politics,ffe0r1k,t1_ffdzlx9,1579833719.0,Oh my god she is brutal. Every stupid headline that says “so and so SLAMMED so and so” I hate. But if it has her doing the slamming I believe it now. She takes no shits. This is the definition of “saying it like it is” she doesn’t have to resort to insults or petty name calling. She just asks direct questions that he is obviously afraid to answer or deflects it to third parties. Imagine this scenario in a more physical nature rather than an internet fiasco. Let’s say General Motors has airbags installed that fail horribly killing hundreds. They are brought to trial. The CEO’s defense is that he subcontracts the airbags manufacture so he has nothing to do with safety. Well. They are still his cars. He had to green light the company. He is still profiting from every death. Would the ceo be held completely innocent? In this world probably yes. But we all know that’s not how it really works or else every company on earth would just subcontract every life of their material to avoid any legal responsibilities.

But these people were calling democrats communist and arguing about how if someone like Bernie wins we will have gulags and death panels. And joe just nodded his head and agreed.

The sheer amount of liquid alone an alcoholic drinks (beer people, not liquor so much) is enough to constantly be flooding the system. Then you get to the fact that alcohol, over time changes the efficiency of gut bacteria to break down and integrate nutrition in the body. So when you do eat a normal amount, most of it is slid away as waste since the body can’t absorb it anymore. The body also recognizes alcohol as a poison and will do it’s beat to dispense of it, leading to diarrhea, vomiting, and what a lot of people like to call, “breaking the seal” when out binge drinking after your first piss you have to go again and again.

But it’s the riposte hitting, critting, then critting  again on the retaliation attack, then critting again on the in between turn on a bleed attack. It never ends and you’re sometimes hitting the enemy on their turn for 40+ damage. Twice with two HWM."
darkestdungeon,ff8cszy,t1_ff8cpcq,1579673222.0,Could work. More dps. But the jesters crit and accuracy party buff is what makes the composition sing so I don’t think so. It’s so overpowered. Min maxing is fun for me and I know it’s not that way for a lot of people.
darkestdungeon,ff8c3j7,t3_es7dek,1579672491.0,"Four leper’s. Live by the sword and die by the sword. But mostly die. Memes aside my super team is two highwaymen with melee trinkets in the front and riposte, a jester and a vestal. All
Wounds and stress are healed, stack crit from jester and riposte everything, gaining stress heals from every crit. It’s a god team. 1000 plus kills on harvest. Only stopped because I was bored."

politics,ff8931g,t1_ff80tyu,1579669601.0,“Jesus hates gays” “burn in hell faggot” “no gays in my neighborhood” these are all signs I see regularly. If that’s not hate then I don’t know what coolaid you are drinking.
politics,ff88yv4,t1_ff86h5b,1579669495.0,There really are all kinds. My downstairs neighbor is a middle aged gay man that hates all gay people including himself. It’s really sad to hear him talking on the phone with family or whoever bashing gay rights and praising trump and then have to hear him get fucked by party boys and cry after. I feel really bad for his tormented soul.
cringe,ff88kg4,t1_ff88gx0,1579669137.0,I’m agreeing with you.
