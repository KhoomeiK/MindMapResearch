RedDeadOnline,ffitp5f,t1_ffirsqc,1579982466.0,I’d have zero problem with limited clothing if the damned game just worked!
RedDeadOnline,ffbl5af,t1_ffbkvqr,1579770641.0,"I mean, sometimes they will refund you from their game not working (disconnection dying trade or moonshine missions or if your daily streak glitches out) but after a few times they often stop. Otherwise mostly they just answer “we are aware of this problem and we are working on fixing it”. That is the response I’ve gotten most in the last two months."
BipolarMemes,ffbl2j7,t1_ffaz6av,1579770521.0,Hahaha idk at least they are still shiny!
RedDeadOnline,ffbkz3f,t1_ffb7d8w,1579770373.0,I have a ton of friends who play this game and most of us have gone from playing really regular (at least a few hours a day) to barely playing at all because of all the issues. This game is for sure broken and I’m not one to complain about games. A lot of these issues have made the game much less enjoyable and I believe cause rockstar to miss out on money from screwing up a very large portion of their most active and gold spending players.
RedDeadOnline,ffbkvkw,t1_ffbfxrq,1579770223.0,Wow ya that’s lucky and I envy you!
RedDeadOnline,ffbkumc,t1_ffbi0fu,1579770181.0,I don’t know if this is a joke or not.
BipolarMemes,ffa9a6c,t3_erixi5,1579730381.0,Yes!
bipolar,fed2fs3,t1_feb9p6o,1578995378.0,Yes to video game characters!
TheWayWeWere,fed2ci6,t1_fecdyhh,1578995242.0,"Certain types of apples, sometimes called winter apples, are harvested in the fall but stored in a cool place like a food cellar or cool pantry. They are actually meant to be eaten over the winter. They taste best after a few weeks to months of cool storage. I’ve had apples like this stay good until January as long as I make sure to keep them cool, well spread out and take any that are going bad away."
bipolar,fdnnwto,t3_em44y3,1578589679.0,They love you so much!
reddeadredemption,fd9up54,t1_fd9t8ix,1578238309.0,Hahaha love this!
BipolarReddit,fd4k26y,t1_fd35e6d,1578168232.0,I’d love to have one!
bipolar,fd4jv3j,t1_fd2zw35,1578168195.0,"I don’t have that at all actually. I was mega emotional before and although I still get pretty emotional at times, the meds have made a huge difference for me. Especially the mental chatter I have a lot of when I’m not on it."
BipolarReddit,fd1qvfy,t1_fcznozb,1578135378.0,"If you’re getting paranoid but still want to enjoy using occasional, I’d recommend lower the amount."
BipolarReddit,fd1qqbe,t1_fd0neuq,1578135316.0,"Ya I agree. The meds give me way more memory issues than pot ever ha. I am not a daily user though. When I was, I don’t think I had memory issues either but I was younger. So many things go into memory it’s hrs to really know."
BipolarReddit,fd1qd67,t1_fcziifq,1578135158.0,"Oh yes, I really get into cleaning when I smoke. I normally use for two reason, one to motivate myself to clean or two to help me sleep after the cleaning!"
reddeadfashion,fd1q12d,t3_ejqpve,1578135020.0,Ugh we need the hitch skirts back and freaking corsets that better March available clothing.
bipolar,fd1lnjs,t1_fd12hv3,1578132995.0,Huh I’m on 550mg. Pretty much I’ve gotten the most out of it at 400mg and up. Here they say anything under 400mg isn’t sufficient for treating bipolar. Crazy how doctors in different places have different ideas!
bipolar,fd0yh8y,t3_ejk8qz,1578125477.0,This is so so accurate!
MadOver30,fd0x0u7,t1_fd07vk3,1578124910.0,Ya it’s hard as fuck and exhausting but all new habits and learning coping mechanisms are. It’s something I struggle with constantly but can also look back and see HOW much I’ve managed to improve myself. I’m not sure we are ever done learning or growing or coping but even a little progress can feel so good and make it a bit easier to keep trying.
bipolar,fcrm5er,t3_eikn72,1577903618.0,Happy birthday to your little guy! I’m really happy you have a dog to go through this with. I don’t know what I’d do without mine.
