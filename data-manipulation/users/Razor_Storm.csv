clevercomebacks,ffnm4hk,t1_ffnhjxp,1580067716.0,"Well in this still lies the problem. The overall issue isn't whether a lot of people hate on millennials. It's clear that lotsa hate exists. Even if you don't see much of it personally, it's at least all over the place online.

The point isn't whether the hate exists, but rather that responding to hate with blanket hate isn't a great solution. Even though the millennials hate is so often heard, the majority of boomers are reasonable nice people who just wanna live a good life. As usual it's the vocal minority that's fucking things up.

Hating an entire generation categorically because a small loud minority is throwing temper tantrums accomplishes nothing but spread more unnecessary animosity and make it even harder for both sides to work together for a brighter future. 

It's easy to talk shit about the situation, but it doesn't improve anything and just makes the discussion even more hostile.

Reddit has a lot of strong biases as well. I'm an atheist but there's a lot of people on Reddit who think that religion is the #1 cancer the world has ever invented. Would it be useful for religious people to categorically denounce Reddit and talk mad shit every time the word is mentioned? No, you either move on and realize your life is more important than what some random assholes think, or you work to find a way to improve the situation.

worldnews,ff08fvg,t1_ff05o92,1579466267.0,"Ah interesting. Yeah I have heard of the classical definition of a republic, and also aristotle's ideas on the different forms of government. 

I was using wikipedia's definition: 

> A republic (Latin: res publica, meaning “public affair”) is a form of government in which the country is considered a ""public matter"", not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained, through democracy, oligarchy, autocracy, or a mix thereof, rather than being unalterably occupied. As such it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and has therefore no monarch as head of state.

This is incongruous with Aristotle's definition. But like some other posters have mentioned earlier, the word Republic has been used by numerous people across thousands of years, and the definitions don't always align."
worldnews,ff06ou6,t1_fezs10o,1579465733.0,"Ahh this is interesting. I knew about some of the historical context, but didn't know of all the different definitions that have been used in the past.

Wikipedia defines it as: A republic (Latin: res publica, meaning “public affair”) is a form of government in which the country is considered a ""public matter"", not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained, through democracy, oligarchy, autocracy, or a mix thereof, rather than being unalterably occupied. As such it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and has therefore no monarch as head of state.[1][2][3]

Which seems like a direct contrast to European ""feudal"" society (yes feudal is a very vague and broad term, but it generally applies categorically here), where land is seen as personal property of its leaders, and can be given freely. Enfeoffment is not an appointment of a governor, but rather a direct handoff of some land with ""contractual"" (anachronism, but just to illustrate the point) obligations. 

That said. Was the Roman emperor ever seen as the personal owner of the empire? In the principate, there was the legal fiction of the emperor simply being the first citizen of the state, who happens to have supreme power as a matter of fact. Did the dominate preserve this idea or did the emperor personally own the empire de jure?

I see the problem of this definition, however, since it seems to imply that all governments that are not personally owned by the Sovereign becomes a republic. East asian empires under the sino-sphere of influence tended to operate on the Mandate of Heaven rather than personal ownership of the empire. The chinese people are seen as the country and the emperor is simply a semi-divine heaven appointed leader of the country. However, calling the autocratic legalistic / confucius dynasties of china ""republics"" seems completely inaccurate."

worldnews,fezziwz,t1_fezxzof,1579463565.0,"Ah cool! thanks for the rec I'll look into it.

For the sake of the discussion do you know off the top of your head some examples of these other forms of government?

It'd be really interesting to see another form of government where the country is considered neither a public affair nor the personal property of the sovereign.

Wikipedia states that the technical definition of a republic is that the governance and the state are seen as public matters. These could potentially be ruled by an autocratic ruler that is basically a monarch in all but name. 

However, even a dictator running a republic do not see the country as his/her private personal property, but rather an institution that he/she has absolute control over. Sure this is probably identical in practice, and the line between personal bank account and the state bank account is probably blurred anyway if the ruler has complete control over the country's finances. 

However legally speaking, a non-republic is a form of government where rulers consider their land personal property, and can trade, sell, conquer purely out of personal relationships. e.g. enfeoffment isn't a relationship where the monarch appoints a governor. Instead, the monarch personally hands over some of his / her personal property (in the form of land and the people and resources on the land)."
worldnews,fezksif,t1_fez84y5,1579458373.0,"Oh man I heard this all the time when I was in school long long ago. It's not even correct.

A republic is any government without a monarchy.

The US has a constitution and also has no monarchy and thus is a constitutional republic. What type of government is it if not a monarchy? A presidential (non parliamentary) bicameral representative democracy.

Yes the US is a republic, and yes it is a democracy

Edit: See discussions below. There has been many many different definitions of the word Republic used by different groups across thousands of years. Some examples of these definitions are: ""a form of government where decisions are made by the public"", ""a form of government where sovereignty rests on the people rather than a ruler"", ""a form of government where the land and the state are owned by the public rather than being the private property of the ruler"".

Under some definitions, the adage above is like _almost_ correct."

At least here in America, we use actual distance measurements (miles) etc if you are just talking about geographic distances in the abstract. But in practical situations where you are actually considering making the trek, we use time.

I'd say Tokyo is the city that's closest to a Corusant / Trantor. It's a very vertical city, with many places that have walk ways above walk ways that connect buildings across the streets. The city is massive with a stupid number of people living in it, and tons of different services are crammed into one location: from centuries old sushi shops in little wooden shops on the ground floor to a glistening skyscraper on the next 100 floors. 

> everywhere So-Cal or Mexico City could give you a great approximation.

I suppose massive endless sprawl could be a similar approximation of an ecumenopolis. Fuck socal though, I just moved back from there a month ago. I'd hope that an ecumenopolis would have the traffic situation figured out. To be fair, LA is improving its public transit slowly, it's totally possible with our technology and engineering ability to make LA into a NYC, it's just that the low density sprawl makes it way too inefficient.

I think the correct model to shoot for is highly dense (and thus relatively space compact) cities with tons of nature / suburbs around it. I guess, again, NYC is a great example of this.

Alternatively, San Francisco's model of millions of parks of all sizes strewn across the city could be a good way to organize high and low density areas. Also by organizing high and low density into manageable chunks, public transit becomes much cheaper and efficient to build. Buses / subways / light rails / sky walks for dense areas. Bullet trains, airlines, helicopters, hyperloops for crossing the larger low density areas."
IsaacArthur,fenzw8i,t1_fenxm8p,1579293187.0,"> We've become more and more physically isolated since the 1900s.

Yeah I've definitely noticed this. It's not necessarily hard to make friends, but it's very difficult when you are starting from scratch. Moving to a new city, the sense of pure community isn't there anymore. You'd have to go out of your way to go to events and do hobbies to break into a new circle.

However, I've been fortunate enough to have a very strong circle of really close friends and tons of casual friends that I can fill a party with. 

I personally like big cities, and I can see it being a double edged sword. There's more things to do and thus more opportunity to meet new people. Also people tend to be very social (amongst their social groups), so meeting a few friends could potentially introduce you to dozens upon dozens of new ones. On the flip side, cities are huge and anonymous. No one gives a shit about you until you give them a reason to. It's easy to get lost in the crowd if you aren't very proactive about socializing.

Personally what helped me the most is the fact that I worked at a company where the majority of people were my age (i was early 20s at the time) and are very social. Everyone always wanted to hang out after work, and people made friends with each other super readily. We'd go get hammered after long days (or more like every day), get high and talk shit about our managers, and do all kinda fun hobbies together. This environment really helped me kick off my social life in the city, and through them I was able to meet a lot of other people. 

My city has a bit of a ""we're young and we won't grow up"" mentality. Most of my social group are highly ambitious people in high paying professional careers. These people are fortunate enough to have the means and resources to fill their days with adventure and excitement. This definitely also helped a lot in building up my social group. Everyone really liked hanging out, partying, going for mountain drives, going to shooting ranges, skiing, jetskiing, etc. 

I'm really glad I managed to build up this family around me. I can totally see it getting harder and harder as we get older. People will start having kids and building up their own families, or advancing really high in their careers.

Edit: would it work if the Death Star is actually just a shell world surrounding the most massive black hole you can form given the size restrictions. The black hole would normally stay dormant until preparing to fire, on which time massive amounts of hydrogen are delivered and sent into orbit around the black hole. A strong electro magnetic field is used to contain the ionized plasma, and fusion within the accretion disk provides the massive power to obliterate planets.

I suppose the engineering challenge now becomes: how do you create a magnetic field that can contain such a powerful energy source without also ripping the death star itself apart. 

Also, I suppose this also has a problem of generating a EM field that can contain the outward pressure of the fusion would probably take more power than the fusion itself. 

Maybe there's also a magnetaur nearby that can generate the EM field.

At this point I'm just jamming more and more celestial bodies into this shell, so in conclusion I think you're right and the death star is impossible to build.

Edit Edit: One thing that could work: The death star is actually just a hologram. What's actually there is a nicol dyson beam built around a hyper massive star. (or a black hole with a huge accretion disk)

Alternatively, the Death Star is actually a hologram, and instead it just shoots out two micro black holes at angles that will make them collide right near the victim planet.

Though these are complete cop out answers, if we say it's a hologram, then the death star can be whatever we want... basically allowing for an infinite power source, and arbitrarily powerful RKMs (maybe hidden within a laser beam so it looks like how it does in the movies)"
