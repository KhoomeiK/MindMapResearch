emergencymedicine,ffdqvu2,t1_ffdkz2f,1579826747.0,"That’s cool that you get a leg up before fourth year. Pro tip tho, talk to the nurses and techs. Try to learn from them as well! Things like starting iv’s, hooking pts to the monitor, lac setups, pelvic exam setups, the whole nine, ekgs, splitting, aftercare instructions... absorb it all! Try to get in the habit of being part of the team, picking up scut work, being humble and helping out!"
emergencymedicine,ffdkk60,t1_ffcukqd,1579822839.0,You’ll be okay! You’ll learn quickly after your first one in the ed. Suturing a wound in the ed is very different from the OR due to the setting.
emergencymedicine,ffdkc9s,t1_ffcukqd,1579822706.0,"Generally home em rotations are the starting point (I didn’t have a home rotation) where students get their feet wet in em. They’re usually less harsh since they’re their own students. At the end of the day, don’t get bogged down if you don’t get an ideal lineup for your aways. Go in prepared by listening to em clerkship podcast now on your commute, know the super basic stuff, utilize as many online resources/clerkship advice tips like emra hangouts, cord websites etc. have fun and work hard! Seriously third year is a pain to get thru but I loved my aways! Felt like I was finally doing what I want and personally grew/learned so much!"
emergencymedicine,ffc7mpl,t3_esmz60,1579793403.0,"I did three aways with the third away at my dream program. I felt that there was a huge difference in my performance Btwn the first and third rotation just based on my comfort level, procedural skills (aka I can do digital blocks and lac repairs completely on my own vs no idea what how to inject lido day one), clinical knowledge and generally just what to do to be helpful. 

But doing three aways is absolutely tiring because you have to be on the whole time. If your school starts fourth year early June July August or may June break and August would be ideal with dream program last. Oh, you should also take into consideration the volume and if your dream is a county shop, bc they will really appreciate the independence if that’s the case. 

Honestly though, you might not even get a choice depending on what vsas gives you. Also residents will eventually know your comfort level or what rotation you are on and adjust how much guidance they provide based on that. At the end of the day, don’t be afraid to ask for help. The last thing you want to do is harm the patient!"

medicalschool,ff6uxrs,t3_ernxha,1579635404.0,"Make sure to have your pcp or student health clinic complete the AAMC standardized health form as that will be needed for most places. Things like transcripts, letter of good standing will be uploaded by your school after you’ve submitted the vsas apps. If your away needs anything like malpractice insurance etc then make sure your school has a streamlined way of fulfilling those reqs. Your school will get notifications that they will need to upload your transcripts etc but make sure they don’t forget or ignore these notifications. Vsas is stressful because acceptances come so staggered. ERAS is wayyyy easier in my opinion. Good luck!"
medicalschool,ff6tw1m,t3_ersr40,1579634784.0,"Wait, aren’t hep B titers a req for clinicals third year?! For VSAS, most places require the AAMC standardized form when filling out the app which includes titer information. I would reach out to the clerkship and let them know that you have the help B titer pending and get it done now. Some places need additional paperwork and health clearance forms after acceptance but things like titers, ppd, flu shots are needed across the board. You should definitely start sorting through reqs for paperwork now. If you’re applying to EM, securing an away can be much more labor intensive than other fields."

emergencymedicine,fed1odh,t3_eohc37,1578994233.0,"I think you can essentially setup two concurrent plans for your residency applications. FM tends to be a little more forgiving. You're not quite pigeonholed into a final decision just quite yet.

For the family medicine route, line up your LOR from your third-year rotations, make the most out of your family medicine rotation and ask for a LOR for applications. Pick your attendings + residents' brains about why they went into the specialty, ask some hard-hitting questions about any regrets or negative aspects of the field.

Absolutely crush Step 2 CK, perhaps you can address your step 1 score in your PS.

Set-up your fourth year with two EM rotations much like your typical EM applicant (one home, one away rotation or two aways if you don't have a home institution). A good step 2 and two amazing SLOEs can buffer a bad step 1. Regardless these away rotations will give you a much better picture of EM, albeit extremely small sample size. You seem to have a really good grasp of the pitfalls of EM, much more insight than usual. 

In addition, I think you might need to temper your expectations for a landing spot for an EM residency. Are you okay with matching to a less competitive program? Do you have any geographical restrictions or other things to consider?

This route won't be easy but it'll be the best way to make an informed decision. Regardless of the field you ultimately end up in, you're going to be a phenomenal doc with a good head on their shoulders"

emergencymedicine,fd15ew9,t1_fcxmrll,1578127696.0,"Any ER trained doc / nurse / PA / NP / paramedic, etc would be the best resource since they are more familiar with emergent situations. The medical kit on a plane is pretty limited but does have some basic items such as a stethoscope, BP cuff, IV kit, some basic but limited meds.  The most important job is to assess the situation which means taking a history and doing a physical exam and relaying the information to the consult. From there, they will decide if you need to land the plane or not. Honestly, a regular citizen, especially one trained in first aid (CPR certified) can be immensely helpful as long as they are able to STAY CALM and relay info. Of the people you mentioned, a pharmacist could be helpful. Having some physio knowledge won't provide much help."
emergencymedicine,fd0zrit,t1_fczc00k,1578125990.0,"To the OP scribe, EM is one of the few specialties where you get to work with awesome nurses like this one the ENTIRE shift. Floor work is great but there is a big disconnect between you and the rest of the team. To this badass nurse, I hope I get to train with people like you!"
emergencymedicine,fd0xwfy,t3_ejo11k,1578125260.0,"Former ED scribe, now M4 going into EM. Agree with all the great posts before me that you'll have a ton of opportunities to explore in school. I was on the fence about going into EM at the start of med school but after a round of M3 rotations, nothing replicated the joy and perceived ""fit"" I experienced in the ED as a scribe. I definitely had those shifts where it was hard to deal with the BS but at the end of the day, you have first-hand knowledge of what it's like to be in the ED. Yes, often times it is saturated with nonemergent visits and to a scribe, it's just a list of broken record H&P's you need to complete but as the doc, it's a chance to provide pt education and reassurance. This work experience will definitely help you choose your path since you have the exp to make an informed choice. ps it's totally okay to not go into EM in the end."
