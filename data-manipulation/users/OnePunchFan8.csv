Some tips that helped me: 

-you can use dragon blood droplets you unlock your resurrection nodes (they have a main purpose, but this one's more useful). Also don't worry about using them too much, there's quite a few of these per game cycle, though they are finite.

-Don't worry about npcs dying of disease, it won't happen.

-Try and use prosthetics, some are pretty effective against certain foes. But for bosses I like to turn off the music and just focus on simple combat, I found prosthetics mess up the rhythm of the fight.

-DON'T buy the karma skills unless you have to, they only give you one extra spirit emblem per skill. Get the breath of life skill is recommended as well (I forgot exactly what it's called, but it restores vitality upon a deathblow, very useful when exploring)
