BallPythons,ffg4bvy,t1_fffvxrg,1579898174.0,"Yeah, feeding every week at that age could lead to obesity. Also make sure you aren't confusing a feeding responce with a defensive tag. A tag means they're uncomfortable and its usually a quick bite and then let go, if its a feeding responce she'll hold on a lot longer and maybe coil up on you. If it's just a defensive tag adjust your handling (Snake Discovery on youtube has a great video on this stuff).
 
Gravid basically means that she's carrying eggs. More than likely if she is she'll eventually lay slugs (weird looking unfertilized eggs). If you suspect she might be contact an experienced reptile vet or breeder who can help you through this process with her."

BoaConstrictors,fff70at,t3_et7wgk,1579877318.0,"Take pics (or even better a video) of EVERYTHING from the closed box to every step of opening it to getting your girl out, this way if something went wrong you have it clearly documented and you can get things sorted out with the breeder.

If you look up a basic snake exam that vets perform, I would use that as a guide to look her over. Check for stuck shead, retained eyecaps, look over her vent for any signs of infection/inflammation, gently feel down her body for muscle condition and for any lumps. Good luck with everything!"
BallPythons,fff6d07,t3_et43qc,1579876851.0,"How old is she and how big? If she is reaching adult size back your feeding off to every 2 weeks (with a rat about the thickness of her thickest part) and make sure she has enough cover and enrichment in her tank. This is the general plan I follow for my 3 year old boy and he's been maintaining a decent weight. 

As for the dehydration, add a humid hide and every 2 weeks or so give her a good soak in slightly warm water for 15-20 minutes (longer if she's enjoying it and wants to chill). This should help get rid of the stuck shed, prevent it in the future, and encourage her to drink some.

As for your husbandry, as long as there haven't been any big changes recently I wouldn't really suspect that as the cause. But, it is always good to read up on new info and make sure your ranges are good. She could possibly be gravid? I'm not really sure as I've never extensively worked with a female ball python but I'm sure there are resources out there to help you figure it out."

Awesome! I'll definitely keep these guidelines in mind! One of my main priorities and draws to raising my own feeders is to make sure they have a good life and they are as healthy as the can be throught the entire process, so don't worry about any mistreatment or anything! 

Due to most of my animals needing large/jumbo rats and the possibility of selling frozen feeders I am definitely going to be looking into the CO2 chambers as it seems to be the most humane and surefire way to do the job. I will continue to keep researching though and do my best to do everything right."
unpopularopinion,ffcn765,t3_esqhc3,1579803027.0,"Yup. While i get my shit together my woman will probably be bringing home most of the money. Like hell, I won't be at the house working my ass off to keep the house clean, good food on the table, and whatever else she needs. It doesn't matter who's getting money and who stays at home, split the workload of life equally so you both have more time to enjoy life and eachother."

If they aren't going to be upfront about it then like that relationship wouldn't work out anyway. Just ask them to put their pants back on, chill like bros, talk about it, move on."

atheism,ff9mn2w,t3_esdko8,1579716183.0,"Good on you for taking pictures. If you can record your daughter talking about the incident or even have her record when they're harassing her you could use that if things get dirty with these kids facing consequences. If the school doesn't do anything straight up go to the police with all of your evidence.

Even for a kid with lesser challenges than your daughter, this kind of stuff can be a massive deal for them emotionally later on and no kid deserves that. You're doing good as a parent and sticking up for your kid. If only more parents took the same approach you use to raising their kids the world would be a lot better place."
AmItheAsshole,ff6joq7,t3_erso9x,1579628642.0,"NTA that kind of bs pisses me off too. 

There was a similar situation in my highschool where the one black girl in our class (small-town texas not a lot of diversity) would go around telling people they were ""honorary black people"" and could say the n word. The funny thing about this is she only told this to the racist kids on drugs who blared rap music and were always in trouble. 

That kind of shit is just stupid and I don't get this ""pass"" crap. If someone of that group is okay with that kind of language sure go for it, but that doesn't mean at all that it's okay in every situation."
boas,ff6gio5,t3_erwz50,1579626704.0,"I'm still pretty new to the boa hobby, but depending on how she's keeping weight on you may consider taking her to a vet for a parasite test to make sure there's nothing stealing her nutrients."

unpopularopinion,ff57ivf,t3_erknn1,1579582502.0,"Really its about showing how women can have a choice in how they groom themselves. A woman doesn't have to be hairless everywhere just because of old social expectations. 

Also, it really isn't unhygienic. Saying that is like saying every man who has body hair is unhygienic. It's total bs. It's absolutely possible to stay just as clean when you allow the hair to grow out. Not to mention, from experience, people tend to sweat less when they have the hair. 

Let women do what they want and express the power over their bodies how they want. It doesn't hurt anyone in any way."
unpopularopinion,ff56v4o,t3_eri67m,1579581931.0,"Totally agree. Everyone should have the ability to do whatever to their body. Wanna do sex work? Shit be safe, get that money, do your thing.

BallPythons,feo0i9d,t3_eq3k9s,1579293510.0,"Buy yourself a heat gun (like $15 on amazon and so worth it) slowly bump up the temp on your thermometer until the hotspot is at an acceptable range and then check the ambient temp. This should help get the enclosure to a better temp. If not look into keeping the entire room warmer by manipulating vents/curtains. 

Also using fabric or carboard wrapped around the terrarium as a backdrop can help insulate the entire thing. Adding a towel/some covering over the top can also help. Good luck!"
