Don't get me wrong, it's aweful. But watching movies in the 80's was a different experience entirely. You'd go to the mom and pop rental store and see the most insane stuff. Keep in mind, movie trailers weren't all in your face like they are now. So most of the time, you had no idea at ALL what you were getting into. 

And Howard the Duck was fucking insanity. That alone made it interesting. Also, it was one of the first mature comic book movies. Unfortunately, it wouldn't be until ""Blade"" that Hollywood figured out you need good writing, acting, etc. to make the formula work. You can't just lean on the comic elements and hope that will balance everything else out."

Keep in mind, this is a full-sized cat, not a kitten.

Countless times I would get up from playing Warcraft, surfing the net, or watching TV just to realize midway standing up, there's a cat in my lap that I had no idea was there. I didn't even feel her get on my lap.

She had mastered the ability to crawl on my lap unnoticed, curl up in a ball, and remain as still as death while there.

It caused me to have to CONSTANTLY check my lap every god damn time I was getting up. You're probably thinking this only happened after a long time sitting down. Nope! One time only 15 or so minutes passed.

Also, she would curl up on top of my head at night (on the pillow) like a furry crown like I was the king of cats or something.

It was a great retail job, but like all retail in America, that had to change. We couldn't compete with Walmart's low prices and the founder died leaving greedy bosses to use the money to take extravagant trips on the company dime while not working hard enough to figure out ways to lower our prices.

Then we got sold to Cerberus LLC. When a company named after a 3-headed hound of hell takes over, you know your in trouble. They worked everyone HARD, became profitable off our backs, sold most of the stores to Publix for a profit. Publix took over and everyone was laid off.

I managed to move from the stores still left open (not profitable enough for Publix to buy) until the Great Recession closed what was left in my area. After my emergency savings/credit was stolen by my longterm girlfriend and she left me with all the bills, I became briefly homeless until I luckily found one last family member who would take me in.

Later that night she apologized to me. I asked what for and she said she was masterbating to the sound of my voice and came twice. She felt really guilty about it.

I forget exactly what she said, but it was something along the lines it's a turn on when a guy treats her like a person, doesn't shame or pressure her over sex, encourages her passions, fun to talk to, etc. I do remember her saying, ""And I just like the sound of your voice"".

Article II, section 2 of the Constitution gives a president the power to  pardon anyone who has been convicted of offenses against the United  States, with one exception: ""In Cases of Impeachment.""

Trump is going to prison unless he resigns like Nixon. This is exactly why Nixon DID resign; to give Ford the authority to pardon him. Trump will not resign. It would be admitting defeat and Trump will never do that. Ever. His fate was sealed the minute the House impeached him and he's too stupid to know it. Notice house speaker Nancy Pelosi isn't talking about this because she's playing the long game. Even if it costs them the election and Trump is re-elected, that only gives him 4 more years. After that, she wants to show the world Trump in handcuffs being lead to federal prison for god knows how many laws he's broken. When young people apply for their voter's ID and have to chose a party, all they're going to remember is a Republican president THAT ALL THE OTHER REPUBLICANS SUPPORTED, being lead away in handcuffs.

Here's what I think the Republicans are going to do. They're waiting to see just how bad the impeachment trial goes. If it goes really bad, they're  going to say ""Resign and let Pence pardon you or we'll vote to kick you out and cops will be waiting for you when you exit the White House"". Nobody remembers all the good Nixon did. Only ""I'm not a crook"", but better that he resigned than to be thrown in prison. People tend to not trust you when you supported a convicted felon.

The DOJ and every other law enforcement group that Trump has done nothing but talk shit about and made their lives as miserable as possible are HUNGRY for this. They can't fucking wait the second another president is confirmed.

The Republican party is screwed no matter how this turns out. It's only a matter of how bad.

There's this episode on Star Trek the Next Generation where an awkward, but brilliant crewman ""Barclay"" is using the holodeck to re-create the crew. This is supposedly a highly unusual thing to do for the time. He makes his bosses act like idiots and the woman are all over him. Basically, he's using it to fuck his co-workers...and they find out when they burst into the holodeck looking for him.

You think they would be furious at him, feel humiliated, and insult him. Instead, they *apologize*. They tell him it wasn't their intent to intrude on his private life. In fact, the only reason they go into the holodeck without his permission is because he keeps showing up late for his shift (a big no-no when you serve on a starship). Their only concern is that his fantasy life is interfering in his duties. Troi does say they need to talk about this, but I suspect, as ship's counselor, it's her job as it's not a healthy thing to use the holodeck as a substitution for your life (only the occasional escape).

The reason they say they're sorry is because, in the world of Star Trek, humanity doesn't just have advanced technology, they have *evolved*. So the only real answer is, if you want to act like an evolved human is to apologize and mean it. Explain that you made a mistake, invaded their privacy, and ask for forgiveness and that you won't embarrass them by bringing it up again (AND MEAN IT). You are in the wrong, not them.

From the perspective of an oligarchy, wealth makes you fit to rule; it's what makes you better than others. Having poor people is fine to cashier your Walmarts or work your Amazon warehouses.

Russia invades Ukraine because they have something they want (I think it's their shipping ports). America is friends with Ukraine and we're supposed to protect them from invasion.

So why aren't we? Well, we're giving them a ton of American tax dollars to buy weapons from us (yeah, I don't get it either). But then Trump briefly froze that money to get political opponent dirt (highly illegal hense impeachment).

Anyway, a lot of this has to do with Putin and Trump. And the rabbit hole on that runs very deep and even discussing is likely to start shit in this thread; which I don't want to do, because this is about war in Ukraine that I didn't know was a war. I thought it was just a minor conflict. That's what this documentary is trying to tell others.

As to why I didn't know, my guess is the media doesn't want us to know because both sides (America/Russia) are in a proxy war? And again, the ""relationship"" between Trump and Putin makes this infinitely more complicated.

And no, simply voting Democrat isn't going to fix things. The wealthy have the game rigged in their favor no matter what side you're on. That's why the founding fathers were against a two-party system.

Let's look at the best example: California. The bluest state there is and has more capital running through its veins than entire countries. So if it must be a utopia for the average American, right? Wrong.

Despite having the most restrictive laws for starting a business, it was reported to have 8 of the 10 most polluted cities in the U.S in 2018. Despite all the wealth, San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Fransisco are flooded with homelessness. People are fleeing the state and causing chaos with cost of living wherever they go (Reno, NV; Austin, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Denver; Phoenix; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle). They spilled over from Portland into Vancouver, WA (where I live) and rents are quickly becoming unaffordable. My family still doesn't know where to go if it keeps going up. My retail job has an insane turnover rate now. They're so desperate they actually gave everyone a fat raise that no one fought for (because living costs are so high, it's a drop in the bucket).

Anyway, point being is, if Democrats have all the fucking answers, why does California suck literally at everything a liberal would care about (affordable living, pollution, plentiful social services, mass transit, etc.). And quite frankly, California's government is just as horrible as running things as any deep south state. The answer is because the wealthy control them, too.

It's like OSX vs Windows. They both crush any competition, but each has a their own way of doing it. Microsoft runs its monopoly with the software, OSX with the hardware (they used their insane cash to buy the vote to defeat the ""right to repair"" law). Linux would be like an independent; too weak to actually take on the other two.

Until the concept of a civil oligarchy is in the mind of most Americans, nothing will change. Yes, Warren and Sanders say ""the game is rigged"", but both are doing a shit job explaining it. I've yet to hear either say ""civil oligarchy"".

Out of the 50%, the MAX you're supposed to spend on housing is 30%. If you have a lot of healthcare costs, travel costs to and from work, etc. you may have to spend far less than 30%. Good luck with this. Because the vast majority of Americans are too ignorant of this fact, they've stood by and done absolutely nothing to stop raising rent/housing. Housing is going to be a major problem for you. The only solution is roommates and that comes with a TON of risks. Too numerous to get into. Just...watch your back at all times and always expect and prepare for the worst from your roommate or it's your ass. One of mine almost cost me my life. Luckily, I had family to take me in.

Most of you can't afford a car. Shut up. No, you can't. Many of you couldn't even afford a car if it was *given* to you. It's called TCO (total cost of ownership). You can't afford it. So how do you get from Point A to Point B? Public transportation? Do you actually live in a city/town that provides good service? I doubt it. Most don't unless you live in cities like Portland, OR. So what do? Only option I'm aware of is a motorcycle. Get the most comfortable and easily fixable one you can find. Don't go for looks, go for practicality, safety, and comfort. And buy riding gear (good helmet, thick leather, etc.). Wear a reflective vest like construction workers. You're gonna look like a fucking dork...but one who stands a better chance not getting hit. Because if you are, your life is fucked. This is why getting a car is a much better idea. Too fucking bad you can't afford it. You're sorta fucked either way, but if you buy a money pit like a car, you're definitely fucked. Put money aside to rent a home depot/lowes truck whenever you need to like once a month groceries or see if food delivery is in your area. You may feel ripped off paying to deliver, but you'll be paying a *fraction* compared to what a whole car costs.

Emergency savings is for emergency living expenses only. Nothing else. NOTHING.

Credit and debt are to be used for these things only: to *save* money (buy on sale and you are responsible enough to pay back and KNOW the interest is going to be FAR less than the amount you saved getting the item on sale) or to *make* money (i.e. building a business). Nothing else. It is not used for living expenses if you lose your job (that's what an emergency savings is for). It is not used to buy something that is so expensive you can't afford to pay off your card with your savings if you lose your job. God...I would've killed to get this advice in my 20's. 10k credit card debt when I worked at Walmart making $6/hr.

If we had visionaries in charge concerned only with supporting society, then we'd be entering an exciting age that can only be compared to the invention of the steam engine, electricity, and the first computers (see Frontline report on A.I.). Instead, we are ruled by greedy assholes and supported by nothing but a society of ignorant sheep that don't even know 30% is the most we're supposed to spend on housing.
