todayilearned,ffjaw4a,t1_ffikq2v,1579994459.0,"There are specific laws around hunting kangaroos and wallabies in Australia.  They are a protected species, but at the same time can become a pest. 

However you need to have a permit to hunt, and you're restricted to the land on your permit. [there are laws around it (pdf)](http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/8ae26c87-fb7c-4ddc-b5df-02039cf1483e/files/code-conduct-non-commercial.pdf), and laws vary from state to state in Australia. 

There are also rules for *how* you shoot them - must be headshots only, certain types of ammunition, must euthanise too that aren't killed outright, shooters must be competent, etc. 

The cowboys on the movie were definitely not following laws, and would have lost their licenses (if they had any), and been fined thousands. 

I'm pretty sure Mick Dundee did the morally right thing."

WTF,ffi7bme,t3_etr6ec,1579966983.0,"Take them back, and *politely* inform him of the existence of green bins, and that their waste is their responsibility, unless of course they're willing to pay you to remove it - as a professional courtesy. 

If he doesn't play ball, make a complaint to council.

Green waste on your property is your responsibility.  

You should be disposing of it properly - place in green waste bin for collection, take to tip for disposal (usually free or small charge *per carload*), or just cut. The stuff up and place in a regular bin (bit of a grey area).  If they own their place, they *will* have vouchers to dispose of it at a tip, and they get new ones *every year*.

If they don't have a green bin, they sure as heck can ask the local council for one - gets added to the rates as a one time purchase, usually. 

Also, pretty sure there's a fire ban current on - they are basically making a fire hazard in a public space. Might have something here too. 

Inform council, and they'll get a letter, maybe a fine. Do it twice and most likely a fine. 

Keep all your videos - also make sure they are admissable. Sometimes they're not if the camera faces a public road. Again, depends on local council / state laws. 

Also, check your local council laws on green waste, nature strips and illegal waste dumping. 

This neighbor is just plain lazy. 

If they kick up a fuss, call the council and cops (cops so there is paperwork that they do this).

Hope this helps."

Archery,ffgm1jg,t1_fffcmej,1579909368.0,"The spare arrow sets might be incomplete sets - arrows of a certain length (most clubs tend to match vane colours for same lengths).

If you're missing one arrow (let's say a set is 6), just grab a spare to complete your set, or you accidentally break a few arrows in a set, place the remaining arrows in here, maybe.

The broken tubes are kinda self explanatory."
