paradoxplaza,fe8iivz,t3_enjv8x,1578926520.0,"Paradox seems to be continually testing the acceptable margins of what is considered, by consumers, to be a minimum viable product. As a business, they are trying to generate as much profit at as little cost as possible. Unfortunately, that often doesn't fall in line with what is equally beneficial to the customer."

civ,fcn37pz,t1_fcm7dl7,1577802011.0,"Thanks for all of the advice. I play the base game as I don't own the expansions. From what I've seen, the expansions add more tedious micromanaging and take away freedom of choice. It would be great if you could enable/disable specific features from the DLCs (even just the new civs) but for the most part, you can only choose the whole expansion.

Examples: 
Rise & Fall - At the begging of each era you have to set an objective, therefore incentivizing you to play it out rather than adopting new on the fly strategies as you see fit.
Gathering Storm - Having you focus on the minutiae of environmental factors, distracting you from the broader political atmosphere around you."
