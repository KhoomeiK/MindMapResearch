If he were to pay to child support, he'd be homeless and I'm not that heartless. He's actually regretted the whole thing and he's literally perfect but he doesn't know that the damage was done and I hate him for it and I'm completely disgusted by him. I don't find attractive in any way what so ever anymore. Maybe one day I'll have the courage to leave, but now would be a very bad time."
offmychest,ff5fnfu,t3_erqry3,1579590791.0,I feel the exact same way. I've never felt pretty since my husband cheated on me so anything sex related gets me down and I feel so ugly and unattractive. Dispute so many guys hitting on me daily. I get upset because I think they just want sex and don't see me as beautiful at all. I get mad when people compliment me and call them liars and it's just horrible.
offmychest,ff57ygq,t3_erhisj,1579582886.0,"I've been cheated on by husband. It's not fun. I'm miserable. No matter how much he's changed for the better, I haven't forgiven him and it shows. Imagine having someone so perfect in your life. He does everything for me. He's good with the kids. He's just perfect. But before he was perfect, he was a monster. He treated me wrong, he cheated, he was verbally abusive. And I stupidly stayed because my family told me to.

I am miserable. I don't care if it was five years ago. Deep down, I hate him. I want to go. But now our marriage is perfect, we have three kids, and I can tell when he looks at me, he knows he screwed up. That's why he's so perfect now. But it makes no difference.

Cheating ruins so many lives. It even ruined my husband's. He knows he was wrong, he's apologized several times, he's now everything I could have asked for, but it's never going to be enough. I want to cheat on him so he feel what I felt, but I don't have it in me. Because in my heart, I know cheating is wrong and won't solve anything. 

Also, let's say cheating is normal... Does that make it right...? Just because something is normal, doesn't make it right."

I grew it indoors first and then slowly put it outside. I recommend putting in a huge pot when it gets big enough, and then bringing it indoors during the winter. I did that for lemons and truthfully, there really isn't that much of a difference between the two care wise lol"
