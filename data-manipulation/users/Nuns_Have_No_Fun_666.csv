AskReddit,feooqps,t3_eq1wzh,1579303211.0,"How is it possible then, and I guess I’m a dying breed, to be 49, with no degree and be ok. I’ve worked in retail for 30 plus years and it’s sucked the whole time. Yet it has allowed me to own a home although not yet paid off, with a mortgage that would make most people cringe for a four bedroom two bathroom house with a built in pool on a conservation lot in Tampa that’s WELL under a grand a month. Three paid for beautiful vehicles and zero debt than the mortgage. I guess I’m just realizing that’s no longer a possibility? I dunno, really not trying to be a dick, but rather empathize if you are spending your money correctly. Shits expensive, I get it. But it’s doable. Of course I have no children which helps a ton."

If I would have known then what I know now.... ugh.... I miss those days a lot. And people call them glory days, and they are. But also the best times of my life. Impossible to duplicate today."

Yeah the treatments suck beyond belief, and lasting repercussions keep me from doing what you do. Especially lifting. I’m a shell of my formal self. I love riding my Giant mountain bike though.
