I have baked bread with it. I replace about 5% of the flour with psyllium husk powder. It sometimes needs a bit more water in the dough to compensate, but if it's a bread recipe you're familiar with then you just add splashes more water until the consistency seems right."

EatCheapAndHealthy,ffvlqbz,t1_ffvii7v,1580267089.0,"Taste-wise it isn't particularly noticeable. I replace about 5% of the flour with the psyllium husk powder (e.g., instead of 100 grams flour, using 95 grams flour and 5 grams PHP), and it just makes the bread taste ever so slightly ""browner"" if that makes sense? Like, it doesn't make it any less pleasant it just doesn't taste fully like white bread anymore. If you make brown or wholemeal bread anyway I don't think it would be noticeable at all. And once I've put a topping or filling on/in the bread the difference isn't noticeable, the change in flavour is really very mild - you could probably increase the amount of PHP in it over 5% and it would still be fine, I guess you'd need to go up to more like 10% to guarantee 3 grams of fibre per slice. But you can always start with a smaller ratio of PHP:flour too, to see if the taste will bother you.

Texture-wise, sometimes you need more water in the dough but it doesn't change the end product much. Psyllium husk powder tends to give things a bread-y quality anyway (which is why it's a common ingredient in keto or gluten-free bread, to help with texture).

It's a product that can vary a bit by brand though - I use the one from Bulk Powders and have never had any problems with it, but I tried a cheaper one in the past that was much grittier in texture and less nice (I don't remember the name). And apparently some brands can discolour the dough quite dramatically, but this doesn't impact flavour."

""Jane said one of the things she was particularly daunted by before her baby was born was the logistics of using a cane and a push chair at the same time. After researching her options she decided to have a go using a baby carrier alongside her cane. ""I assumed that all baby carriers were fabric slings which would be hard to use but I found one with buckles that was extremely easy to use."" Jessica said that she would have liked more information on slings and baby carriers before her baby came along and Lynne agreed saying that midwives and health visitors did not seem to cover mobility issues with her before baby came along. She recommends trying a number of baby carriers out to see what works best, for her a carrier where the baby is worn on the back worked out the best.

Firstly, with meal planning/prepping it does get easier. Overtime you learn what things are quick to make, you get better at cooking, you learn what your kids' faves are, and you build up enough frozen leftovers that you can just bung something in the over for 15 minutes and you're sorted.

Secondly though, like, duh it's easier to have junk food than make healthy food! That's probably one of the many reasons people end up needing this sub. It's easier to order pizza than make a meal, it's easier to stop at Burger King than prepare a packed lunch, it's easier to peel a chocolate bar wrapper than it is to peel an orange - especially if it's a snack you're giving to a child. But sometimes you have to do stressful things anyway because they're more beneficial - getting all your kids to brush their teeth before bed and remembering to brush your own is a bit of a hassle, it would be a lot easier if you just forgot about the brushing and told them to just have a swill of mouthwash, but we both know a decent parent isn't going to endanger their child's dental health like that. It's *easier* to just spend whatever you want and not have to stress about maintaining a household budget and put everything on a credit card instead, but I'm sure you wouldn't do that either, because again you realise there will be negative consequences down the line to the *easy* option."

What are your reasons for wanting to lose weight? Is it health focussed? Is your current weight preventing you from doing things you would like to (e.g., struggling in PE class, getting out of breath on stairs, not fit enough to join a swimming team)? If you talk to your mum about something specific you want to achieve but currently cannot then she might be much more at ease with helping you get fitter rather than helping you lose weight specifically. Or, if your current eating habits are leading to negative gastric affects (bowel movements that are too frequent/uncomfortable/infrequent/uncontrolled/whatever, heartburn, gas, etc, etc) you could talk to your mum about resolving those problems (more fibre and hydration - so vegetables, fruits and wholegrains, and less processed food) which would likely lead to a reduction in calories overall. There may be a nutrition course or evening class that the 2 of you could attend together, and, again, really focus on the health aspects of eating. The important thing I think is to talk to your mum and make it a team effort to help you get healthy and happy.

There's just so many ways calorie counting can go awry and you can never be 100% precise, but really go over absolutely everything you're doing and weigh all of it and double, triple check that you're using the right numbers.

3. Something is medically wrong. If, after verifying over a few days that your scales and calorie counting are indeed accurate, you're still not losing weight, then there's something not quite right here.

relationship_advice,fe1hkcf,t3_enm1ci,1578826603.0,"The most important thing to remember is: Your friend has time in her life and space in her heart for both of you. It's not a zero-sum game, her caring for her new friend as well does not mean she cares for you any less.

To be honest, it does sound like she and her new friend are closer in some ways than her and you - they spend more time together, their lifestyles have more in common at the moment, in practical terms they're very compatible. But *unless* she's ditching you to spend time with her new friend, that doesn't actually impact on your friendship with your BFF at all. It's the emotional closeness between the two of you that matters, not anything else. Just like you don't become less of a Star Wars fan just because you've started watching Star Trek as well.

Ultimately though you will have to accept that as you move through life you will become less close with some friends. It's normally because of circumstance and life changes, not lack of affection. And life will also bring you new friends if you look for them, perhaps at this point you might also want to see if there's any other friendship opportunities you could pursue, maybe with people at a similar phase of life to you - people who have jobs and don't party as much, for instance. And I don't mean that a new friend should replace your BFF - but that you both should be broadening your social circles. If you have a wider social circle and you're not as reliant on one individual person to meet your emotional needs, you won't feel as hurt/insecure when that person has other friends as well."
books,fe1d3v7,t3_enctm1,1578825187.0,"Agreed, it's a book that hits pretty much all the spots - funny, clever, informative, engaging and incredibly readable. I'm often a bit snobby about celebrity autobiographies, but Trevor's is superb. I read it in one sitting, couldn't put it down.

I studied South African history at uni so I knew a lot about the political/historical background of apartheid but had never read such an ""everyman"" account of the era, of that makes sense. I'd read (auto)biographies of important figures from around that time, but it was brilliant to get the perspective of just a kid doing his own thing. It also seemed like enough of the politics was explained in the text that even if I'd never heard of South Africa it would still have all made sense though, I was impressed at how well it gave information without patronising the already-informed, if you see what I mean.

Brilliant book. It's been my default ""ooh, I'm not sure what to get (whoever) for Christmas/birthday""-book for a couple of years now."

Think of the first time you try anything new - Skyrim, playing guitar, learning Spanish, archery, knitting, whatever - does it not usually take you more than 7 tries at a task before you become successful in that skill?

Though I agree, what I said would mostly apply to people with a BMI of under 40 or so, I believe there does come a point where simply losing weight is the healthiest thing you can do for your body."
loseit,fdq6i2q,t1_fdq508o,1578656990.0,"What I mean by separating weight from health is, let's say I'm overweight and inactive but I start going running 3 times a week. Because I'm running, I feel hungrier, so I eat back the extra calories I burnt from the exercise, and maintain my weight, which is still overweight. But even though my weight hasn't changed at all, I am healthier than before (stronger joints, improved cardiovascular health, all the other benefits of regular aerobic exercise).

When the logic is ""I should run more, so that I lose weight, so I will be healthier"" then if someone doesn't lose weight it's easy to give up because the running ""isn't working"" - meaning they miss out on the health benefits. If you change the process to ""I should run more, so I will be healthier (and potentially lose weight)"" then the improved health is the focus from the beginning, and building good exercise habits is beneficial even if other aspects of your lifestyle (diet) mean you don't lose weight."
loseit,fdq3kpt,t1_fdpgugf,1578653171.0,"> why can't I love my body and want to improve parts of it? 

It's a difference between ""everybody's body is perfect just the way it is!"" and ""nobody's body is perfect, and that's okay"". While both of those attitudes are shallowly very similar (body positivity, love and appreciate yourself for who you are, etc) once you get a bit deeper the former can be really toxic and totally stifle positive change.

In general I love the idea of HAES, making people aware that, e.g., becoming more active or cutting back on alcohol is of benefit for them even if they don't lose any weight by doing so. Separating weight from health should be empowering in terms of helping make positive change - going for a walk or eating an apple every day sounds much more achievable for most people than losing 50lbs.

Yet somehow it's all become an ideology of complacency and stagnation and victimhood... I find it very frustrating."

It's still an example of typos influencing the English language - the nickname ""Piers Idiot"" would not work as a joke, the humour is in the typo aspect. The Guardian example is slightly more layered - the newspaper became known for its frequent typos, it was then given the nickname ""The Grauniad"" to mock those typos, and people started saying ""The Grauniad"" aloud in conversation. The nickname ""Grauniad"" wouldn't exist without typos."
