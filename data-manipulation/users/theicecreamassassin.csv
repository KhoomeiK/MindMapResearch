YouOnLifetime,fdcsn1m,t1_fdb11hd,1578283176.0,"They never did. I maintain that because the show is told from Joe’s perspective and that he has a certain image of himself, we’ll never see him do things like that. There are more discussions about it on the board. Remember - Joe tells us the story, believes he’s a good guy. He’d never mention the times he dove into Beck and Love’s bathroom trash getting used feminine products."

YouOnLifetime,fd2thag,t3_ejvqy6,1578151473.0,"It’s the way the show is narrated and shot - if you didn’t care about him somehow, you wouldn’t be able to stomach the horrible things he does. He’s an unreliable narrator, so we only see the things that are somewhat palatable. We have to believe Joe is not a 100% terrible person because he has to believe that.

Basically - you’re being manipulated by Joe because he’s telling the story. If we could read Beck’s memoir, I’m sure we’d have a different feeling!"

YouOnLifetime,fczuonw,t3_ejqauc,1578108921.0,"So - I have to say, as gross as it is, I love that detail. It shows us how much of our perception about Joe is based on HIS narration of the story. 

We never see him dig through a girl’s trash to get used tampons. He’d never allow that to be a part of the story he tells about himself. Why? Because it’s disgusting. It’s dirty. It’s nasty and violating.

Joe, to himself, is not nasty, violating, disgusting, or dirty. He is a white knight - he’s not some bathroom garbage digger. He doesn’t do whatever it is that he has to in order to collect things that make him feel close to his obsessions. He collected tampons from Beck, too. Probably Candace as well. 

The story of Joe uses my absolute favorite literary device — unreliable narrator. Everything we see is through Joe’s lens (not counting the few times we actually get narration from another character)."
YouOnLifetime,fczthgm,t1_fczqxo6,1578108333.0,Ew. Those are definitely tampons. Pretty sure they’re Pearl brand.
YouOnLifetime,fcztag2,t3_ejqeo2,1578108238.0,"I think Joe wants to feel worthy of love from someone damaged that he can fix and make “better” with his love. He’s seriously obsessed with the idea that true love conquers all, but ONLY if it’s with someone who makes him feel worthy.

Now, Love? She’s unworthy because she’s just like him. She’s not perfect, not like he wants. Not like Beck was (in his head, cause holy shit she had issues). 

The problem is that he’s set himself up for failure because no one will ever match up to the “person” he obsesses over. It all stems from his relationship with his Mom - he thinks that had he made better choices, she would still be around. He doesn’t understand that her choices literally had nothing to do with him — seriously, she didn’t care for him because she was completely broken in her own life. If she had, she wouldn’t have left him so often, allowed him to be abused, etc. 

Now, that all seems to stem from her own belief that she deserved that kind of treatment (like Beck). Beck was more like his Mom, I think, than he ever realized. Candace, too. This idea that “I don’t deserve better than being used.”

Love? Love isn’t. She isn’t like his Mom because she’s not helpless. She took care of things that threatened them, and he doesn’t know what to do with that because he can’t control her."
