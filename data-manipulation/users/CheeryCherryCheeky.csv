UnresolvedMysteries,ffow7vn,t3_eucak9,1580082498.0,"I’m thinking ‘the call and numbers’ might instead be linked to the psychological issues of who killed her. (The zodiac killer as an example) Because he got extra attention from calling this in.. and that’s what he wanted. 

He was likely watching from somewhere when they went to retrieve the ring. Seeing that appear in the paper again extends the connection to the crime. Not sure when they released the info about the numbers but he would likely enjoy feeling smarter than LE... as in ‘they can’t crack it’

Possibly there was no follow up call because he already achieved what he wanted (attention) Or not doing a follow up call would also continue his feeling of power and control. Or he ended up in jail for something else and then the connection got broken for him to allow him to keep playing at this game."
FundieSnark,ffophmw,t1_ffnxlii,1580080178.0,"Yes. This.  Have a cousin that was a Harry Jnr and he got Harry Bub as well. 

Junior and Bub.. very cute when he was little.. 
Not as a teen boy. He got furious if anyone dropped the ‘Jnr’ accidentally. His siblings would sometimes do it to annoy but his mum would insist sometimes.... ‘but your my little jnr’.

He got that angry about it - he would get into fights. As an adult he will literally stop speaking to you. Turn around and walk out the room and not speak to you for weeks if you drop a Jnr next to his name. 

Be interesting if Birthy got a little fire cracker like that."
DuggarsSnark,ffole6n,t3_eudxrf,1580078898.0,"I love that many are very quick with a good quip. 

and sharing in a giggle with like minded people."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffk6c50,t1_ffk5gkn,1580017317.0,"Good point I agree. Lying about going into the house could be just that. And maybe the police have already sorted that out with her. And thats not released to the public as information. 

Fingers crossed that some interest from the news articles might shake out some information somehow."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffk3nso,t3_eu0zw9,1580014815.0,"I was reading thru the write up (thanks OP) and thinking ‘oh just probably needs a few interviews or bits of evidence to be reviewed, LE just pulling the last bits together - and yeah the daughter call and her statement, that should be easy for them to work out the contradictions. Probably not long til an outcome’

Then I went back to the top of the write up. 1997.

Seriously ? - fucking - 1997 and that’s the best they can do with that case. 23 years. 

This one doesn’t sound like rocket science. So I’m really confused. Someone has dropped the ball early on maybe."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffk2jrt,t3_eu206i,1580013833.0,Fingers crossed that Hell exists. And that cunt Byron is getting extra special attention for all eternity.
antiMLM,ffk1v54,t3_etvlg7,1580013248.0,Great storytelling. I can’t even imagine the desperation that woman must feel to do to random people in a bar. And how many friends and family must she have gone thru.
antiMLM,ffk19n1,t3_etzx8h,1580012734.0,"Absolutely bonkers.

‘I am going to post over and over and over’ What exactly is the point of writing that? Far out.

People are meant to think ‘gosh yes being inundated with spam posts must mean this product is amazing’!"
UnresolvedMysteries,ffjeo1w,t3_etw5ih,1579996669.0,Achingly sad.
UnresolvedMysteries,ffhk4yd,t1_ffhbvq1,1579938965.0,Ok thanks. Ta.
FundieSnark,ffh9tjq,t3_etlwme,1579927304.0,I thought this was ‘the before’ picture !
UnresolvedMysteries,ffh9mkd,t1_ffh3lnp,1579927126.0,"Yep true that. 

I guess it’s just the idea that ‘taking or not taking a phone’ likely has little to do with what happened to her. 

I didn’t get my first mobile phone til 2002/ maybe 3. Our behaviour was completely different back then when it came to mobile phones. 

It’s the opposite today. Someone leaving a mobile phone behind.. it’s a huge indicator that something bad has happened to them. It has ominous overtones.. ‘their mobile phone was left behind’."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffgyti6,t3_etk7id,1579918566.0,"A couple of thoughts to come to mind.

When she left to go to the bank. I think she was absolutely intending to go somewhere else after that. She left behind her mobile phone - but this was 1999. Those things were clunkers then. Literally just to make a call. And likely the battery would be dead after using for a night.. so leaving that behind means nothing. As does leaving behind her credit cards. It doesn’t say ‘purse’ so she probably had other money/ ID with her. 

And wherever she drove after the bank. Was someone that knew her well enough to know where her sister worked to leave the car there to be found. Possibly as a misdirection - which worked because the LE did indeed think it was ‘that she took off’. 

There is pretty blunt story telling that seems to go hand in hand with reporting on disappearance in the article. ‘She had affairs’. Maybe that is true and she trusted someone she shouldn’t. Or it could be a perfect cover story from hubby to deflect interest from him. Who knows. Pretty awful that has become a part her legacy."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffgnxxl,t1_ffghd8j,1579910671.0,"It just needs a softly softly approach. Don’t get into a loop of arguing or persuading as you’ll both go round in circles and just get mad at each other. 

You - I think this is the right thing to do. (Literally, leave it at that)

Mum - ekkk no. All these reasons why. Yell yell. I’m not happy. 

You - I hear you. I just think this is the right thing to do. 

Telling the story to LE doesn’t have to be a huge effort either. You’ve written the summary here for us on reddit. Simply tidy that up. Tidy it into a few nice paragraphs as a letter. And show that to your mum. ‘I’ve typed it all out, have I got all the details right? This is what I am going to submit.  Job done."
itookapicture,ffghhni,t3_etg520,1579906341.0,"Stunning ! 

To me it captures a warm invite.. ‘come sit awhile and relax here with me’"
UnresolvedMysteries,ffgh0gy,t3_etgbxj,1579906035.0,"I can see your dilemma. Mum is worried about ramifications from that nutbag (sounds rightly so) And if you pass this story along to police.. she would absolutely know it’s you. I’d be mortified if someone passed on a story I told like that and got blindsided by police wanting a statement or turning up at the door. You absolutely can’t do that to her. No no. 

New plan. You need something as a prompt to bring it up with her directly. Just noted the date she disappeared was in Jan. Did you see anything in the local paper for example ? Or you could use a podcast ?

Then. This - ‘Mum I noticed in the local paper a story about Kelly again, that story you told me years ago... It really haunts me. You need to tell LE about that night’ Wait her her reply. Then just keeping say ‘yep I can understand you’d be worried about XYZ, you need to tell LE about that night. And put that simple statement on repeat to her. If she really really won’t back down. Then you simply say ‘that’s ok. But I need you to know that I am going to’

If she gets angry or upset or dismissive in that moment - that is ok. Plan/ brace yourself for that just in case. Give her space to calm down. And later or the next day you need to tell her again you will be sharing that story. Look it might even be the prompt she needs all these years later to tell that story. 

That story is a burden you are holding. You can’t hold onto it. If it haunts you now... I guarantee it will only get harder to hold in coming years. You need to get rid of it."

DuggarsSnark,ffdjhnx,t3_esxkdc,1579822187.0,"She’s brilliant. That was so bloody funny (I missed an earlier post so I hadn’t seen her yet)

She absolutely has Meech voice down pat. Makes you realise how much that sweet whispery voice of hers has been crafted."
FundieSnark,ffdcm0i,t3_esyeql,1579818037.0,"Watch the clip with no sound. His facial expressions/ body language gives him away. Micro expressions. 

When she asks the question his first expression is one of surprise. He then quickly purses his lips. Pursed lips are a sign of repressing something, trying not to show anger or distaste.

Whilst turning his face to talk to her. He purses his lips a number of time. They are very quick actions.

He also is saying words to the effect ‘not nervous, all was great’ but his head is shaking no. The head shaking contradicts the words. He’s not being truthful."

DuggarsSnark,ffahumc,t3_esjx96,1579736090.0,"Perfect for the Dugger/ Fundie families ! 

Vague enough and generic enough that every child will read those and constantly critic themselves. 

Sit in worry and fear and question themselves repeatedly about action or thoughts. 

And at family meetings.. Boob or Meech could talk condescending and vaguely about ‘we’ve seen someone struggling with 3 and 11’ ... You know who you are... and Everyone in the room immediately thinks they are talking about them.. A perfect circle of self deprecation and way to control their offspring even more."

‘Hi, honey, I thought you needed some new make up’

With tones and shades picked out by the hun. Probably get bright red lipstick and too pink blush.
