politics,fgkxq0p,t3_eysd5b,1580876148.0,"Makes me wonder. There always seems to be someone in drumph's immediate ""trusted"" vicinity that always capture his true self in private for all to see.

Are these people spys or cowards that no longer trust drumph and just can't vote against him when it matters most because the money is that good?

Hypocrisy is high."

politics,ffqdye7,t3_euft8a,1580131686.0,">“The Trump team will win an acquittal in the Senate no matter how badly they argue but, on the present trajectory, they won’t win in the court of public opinion,” he concluded. 

As if the current administration cares about public opinion. Yeah drumph does because he wants everyone to love him but he has a team of goons that plow through every fact with lies and deception.

At this point, I feel there aren't that many drumpf supporters but instead a plan that has been executed flawlessly to change the political landscape of american and turn its citizens against each other. Bravo Russia."
