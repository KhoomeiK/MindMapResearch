knitting,fgvzzyh,t3_f0l6us,1581155150.0,You have a lovely natural tension in your stitches! I’ve knit for 40 years and I still battle my hands’ tendency towards too-tight stitches.
AskReddit,fgvyqrx,t3_f0hzfu,1581154732.0,"I’m an older woman and the creeping is not as awful as it used to be, but recently I noticed the same stranger (20 years younger than I) everywhere I went on my weekend errands. The grocery store- always in my aisle. The dry cleaner, PetCo. Even, the tropical fish store. I eventually went to a coffee shop and guess who walks in and sits 2’ from me and starts chatting about the great coffee. I turned my shoulders away. He then says I have beautiful eyes. 1) I hadn’t made eye contact and 2) I have perfectly ordinary eyes.  3) That whole beautiful eye thing creeps most of us women out because we *know* it’s just a line. I texted my friend to come join me because I was becoming wary of stalky creeper.  Instead, she sent her son (30 M/hockey player) He made me feel safe. And I loved him for it, but also hated being fucking “rescued,” and feeling physically vulnerable to a weird guy for about the millionth time in my life.  Ladies, it gets better, but it doesn’t seem to ever stop. Thank you good guys of the world for not weirding on women."

CRPS,fgmk9gt,t3_ez8nhh,1580926278.0,"Maybe that first “battlefield” dose will kill pain 100%. After that dose one’s cell receptors change.  I hit a helpful plateau dose that kept my pain at a level I could function with for decades. I’d occasionally need a higher triage dose in an ER, but then I could always winnow back down easily. (Then the opioid rules changed and my life went down the tubes.)"

coolguides,fgglxjq,t1_fggg87p,1580764613.0,"And we Brits have elevated “dryness,” in a formal language of affirming nods, twitches, and guttural sounds into an art form of total social avoidance. The Germans can never crack this code. I’m an expatriate Brit currently living in the US. I lived in Germany and spoke German for a year before I learned about that whole “literal interpretations” thing mentioned above."

CRPS,fggij6n,t1_fgghkju,1580762588.0,"I’m currently so poorly insured because of my downward spiral because I had opioids reduced so much that I’ve been walking around in a broken ankle since 12/30. I gave the ER X-rays and recommendations to surgeons, but every single one wants $$$$ that I don’t have. Oh well. All I know now is that CRPS and other’s greed have ruined my life... and how I’m voting. So there’s some hope in my heart. Some."

Liquid batter spewed 6’ into the air like a chocolate volcano, for what seemed like 10 minutes, coating the ceiling and walls with my culinary aspirations of brown."
CRPS,fgg9w6x,t1_fgg2mp9,1580757380.0,"Much of  this for me, too. I had a job that I’d had for 11 years and was able to maintain until they started cutting back on my pain meds. Then I suffered so much I started missing work. The stress of so much more pain and the awful stress of losing my income/my job/my home/my health insurance + caused more flares, I know if I’d been allowed to just keep maintaining as I’d done for two decades, I’d not have fallen through he cracks in the floor to the dirt cellar of the USA."
AskMen,fgepo39,t3_exr6va,1580705839.0,"I’m not a man, I’m a taller than average woman. Height has never made a difference to me, unless the man had no confidence and was either sheepish or overcompensated by being a clown. The coolest guy I ever went out with was a 5’5” redhead. He carried himself with grace, and was a delight to be with, consequently women adored him. I know I did."
