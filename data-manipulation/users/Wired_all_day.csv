Darksiders,ffa99h0,t3_ert0e2,1579730370.0,"I read an article where it said after they were laid of, some of them were begging for work on social media. It hurts me thinking that they out their work and effort and days making games for a company or companies and they didn't get to have a safety net if anything bad happened, which it did. It's just disheartening to imaging them begging for work and not being able to help them in any way, if that makes sense."
