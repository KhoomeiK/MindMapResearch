FargoTV,ffhru2z,t3_etibai,1579950604.0,"Buy it on DVD when it comes out.  Usually unless you are Netflix (and you pay for it) every other streaming site will have at least limited commercials.

What is really annoying is that some of them will play the same exact commercial 5 times.  I think they do that to try to get you to go back to cable."

WWE,ffhrrxn,t3_etj9k4,1579950513.0,Man I don’t get how you all get in so early.  Where I live they won’t let you in until 30 minutes before the event starts.

WWE,ffhrn1v,t3_eto998,1579950301.0,Him and Kofi are going to fight over who has the best crazy move.  I had a feeling this was going to happen.  John Morrison is back for comic relief and isn’t going to be any more than what he was when he left.

Picard,ffhre7b,t1_ffeld62,1579949921.0,(Translation:   I just wanted him to be downvoted so he would delete all of his comments because he said he doesn’t like Discovery.)
betterCallSaul,ffhr5qi,t3_ethdcf,1579949551.0,That’s a tall order.
Picard,ffgvk7j,t1_ffga12w,1579916155.0,"Honestly “canon” is a dead concept.  It died once Berman was done.  

The entire story from early TNG to the end of Enterprise and the TNG movies was canon.  Now that different writers, producers, and networks are running the show means that canon doesn’t exist and it is what the current show runners say it is.

They can say all they want that it’s part of the original TOS universe but it’s impossible when they change the story as much as they did in Discovery.  We have seen many other franchise go in different directions.  Some people like it others don’t.  Discovery doesn’t appeal to me but Picard does.  Which is par for the course."
castlevania,ffgv7ww,t1_ffggab9,1579915906.0,It’s all facts man don’t be a hater.
Picard,ffgv628,t1_ffgngf7,1579915869.0,Of course I know what it is and I am not saying there weren’t bad episodes.  Even Breaking Bad and Dallas had bad episodes.  I am talking about how season 4 of Enterprise was just a plethora of random things.  Which was hard to fathom after the Xindi arc which I thought was very well done.

WWE,ffg8w35,t3_etgd88,1579900983.0,"Never happen.  WWE notoriously chooses not to work with other companies.

Only recently have they done this but it is only with small promotions like getting women from Shimmer for the Mae Young Classic or more recently Evolve."
WWE,ffg8oq7,t3_etc6s1,1579900857.0,F Brock!
WWE,ffg8mg7,t1_fffud0z,1579900818.0,It isn’t always the speed of the internet.  It’s the device you use.  If you go to the website WWE tells you which devices run the best.  I bought a new Roku box and have had no issues.  And the best Internet I can get in my area is cable internet or 2nd level DSL.
WWE,ffg8gu7,t3_etei8k,1579900724.0,"I have no issue with running mine.  I do know that you have to make sure you have the right devices or it won’t work well.  I had a PS3 and once they updated it it wouldn’t run any more.  I also couldn’t use it on one of the older Roku boxes.  Once I upgraded it worked fine with no drop offs.

I have heard the consoles don’t run as well as Roku/Apple devices."
castlevania,ffg70ez,t3_etayoz,1579899820.0,"All of the older Castlevanias are basically the same exact game.  Then you had Rondo which changed it up slightly.  Then you had Nintendo making the moralistic versions of the games which were basically the same game as the older ones with better sprites.

Then you had SOTN which was such a better story then any of the older ones and it showed how they could be.  I always thought the PS2 versions were very good.  Then Nintendo went back to making Vanilla games when people complained about Simon having a beard in Mirror of Fate."
Picard,ffg6vzj,t1_fff95uw,1579899742.0,Ok man have a good one.
Picard,ffg6v03,t1_fffc5tl,1579899726.0,That’s just what Kurtzman said because he back-pedalled when people didn’t like it.
Picard,ffg6qdc,t1_fffcgwn,1579899646.0,I agree with this can’t really improve on any of it.
Picard,ffg6jtj,t1_ffferm8,1579899535.0,Look this was done in Enterprise.  Fans got what they wanted and forced Berman out and then praised Manny Cotto SIMPLY BECAUSE he was someone else.  Fact was every episode in season 4 was him jumping sharks because he wanted to get his name noticed by other production companies.  He had no intention of continuing to work with Star Trek but all the fans of the day let their hate of Berman cloud their judgement so they though Cotto was able to crap gold.
Picard,ffg69u0,t1_ffftna1,1579899363.0,Of course he said that because he’s proud of what he did because he was able to troll everyone.
Picard,fff953w,t1_fff5vxi,1579878784.0,Truth isn’t always easy to hear but I bet deep down that is what some people think.
Picard,fff90qs,t1_fff8rq9,1579878703.0,It was a jump the shark move that was probably intended as a joke more than anything.
Picard,fff5u63,t1_ffet0o1,1579876469.0,"Again so what?

Cut  the crap Discovery is not in prime just because Kurtzman says it is.  There are way too many differences to even justify the possibility of that.  And of course they changed it because they felt like it.  Abrams and his people ALWAYS do this.  If you can’t see that then you are not being observant or you are just being obtuse like many Discovery fans chose to be.

Like it or not Discovery is in It’s in its own bubble and that’s where it needs to stay.  F bombs in the show because millennials and Gen Z think saying or hearing the F word makes them feel tough.  Petty politics that no one will care about 5 years from now when Trump is no longer President.  Ridiculous petty SJW plots we saw in Discovery and in the new Twilight Zone reboot.  Stereotypical token characters that are insulting to people who are part of that community, yet the “dominant” social media demographic are interested in understanding that.  At least Picard isn’t pandering this way and has the potential to be good."
Picard,fff4ybh,t1_ffew9by,1579875816.0,That’s also silly to think about because the only reason why they looked more human in 1966 is because they didn’t have the money or the tech to do the prosthetics.
Picard,ffei3ju,t1_ffecwi8,1579848902.0,You see in my opinion there is no reason to explain because it just a simple fact that the producers decided to change Klingons into lizard people because they felt like it.
Picard,ffe7u88,t1_ffe64ar,1579839054.0,....but it created the Kelvin timeline.  And how do we know if these events also didn’t change the future?
Picard,ffe7plo,t1_ffe788f,1579838949.0,Well he was on Kurtzman’s staff so it’s not like the lizard people were a surprise to him.
Picard,ffe62pp,t1_ffe1iny,1579837667.0,"You don’t get it.  Think about it when JJ Abrams and his crew did Star Trek and Star Wars he employed the same tactic.  Destroy something big so I can rewrite the entire series under my image.  And doing that he is basically disregarding the hard work people put into the stories.  It’s an FU and the simplest definition of same.

And why are you so defensive about it?  So what if it’s the Kelvin timeline anyway?"
Picard,ffe5pai,t1_ffe44xt,1579837382.0,"Well for one thing the Romulan Supernova happened.  The past was changed.  It’s a simple if P then Q scenario.

Also you don’t think Kurtzman wouldn’t want to support the Star Trek he helped create?"
Picard,ffe5k9a,t1_ffe4pjh,1579837276.0,I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect that someone like Kurtzman wouldn’t want his brand of Star Trek to be forefront.  When Berman was in charge he always felt like he had to do what he “thought” Gene would do.  Had he focused more on what the fans wanted he may have not been kicked out of the franchise.
Picard,ffe0phy,t1_ffdzzy3,1579833687.0,Yeah that was him back peddling and it makes little sense.
Picard,ffe0o7r,t1_ffe09uo,1579833659.0,"Do we know this for sure?  For all we know Kurtzman may want this show to be a part of that timeline.  It makes sense.

And sorry you won’t convince me...they are lizard people not real Klingons and it was a change just to change it and probably done as an FU to some fans saying this is “my Star Trek now.”"
nasa,ffdtlse,t1_ffd181q,1579828610.0,Yeah but it reminds me of that picture right before the airplane crashed into the tower at 9/11.  I just don’t like the way I feel about it. And to top it off a company gets a plug for it?  It feels almost like a meme.
Picard,ffdtj27,t1_ffdgoux,1579828556.0,Why is it an unreasonable request.  I mean who wants to deal with people you can’t have adult conversations with?
Picard,ffdtgsd,t1_ffdhdib,1579828510.0,"You have no idea what I am talking about.

Look I am going to say it because I have a right to my opinion.  I don’t like Star Trek Discovery.  It has nothing to do with race or what character is the main character or who the actor is who plays her or any of that stuff.  I don’t like Star Trek Discovery and I don’t want this show to be like it.  There is nothing wrong with that."
nasa,ffd0kni,t1_ffch997,1579811050.0,I mean what happened shortly after words.
Picard,ffd0ge9,t1_ffcz17z,1579810986.0,Promise me you won’t react like an irrational fanboy?
Picard,ffc94cp,t3_esucg3,1579794360.0,"Ok finished it.  It’s not terrible but I was hoping there would be no references.  It’s also very hard for new shows not to copy the Disney/Marvel formula, it feels more like the recent Star Wars movies to me and less like the Star Trek I enjoy.  But I suppose nothing is perfect.

I’ll give it a shot.  Which is much better than Discovery got from me."
nasa,ffc6fzr,t3_esmjnv,1579792633.0,Kind of a pic that shouldn’t be public don’t you think?
nasa,ffblufx,t1_ff8x91m,1579771705.0,"Hmmm...you seem to not understand.

Let’s try this:

1.). It’s NOT FAIR to judge people for what they don’t know.  I AGREE with this.

2.). However when people are OBTUSE because they don’t want to learn something THEY don’t agree with.  That is being IGNORANT.

It’s simple logic."

Best analogy I can give you is with wrestling fans.  WWE is the top company by far.  There are some fans that believe that if you are not in the wwe then you aren’t any good.  The fact that those people don’t do the research to learn how good that stated wrestler is is where the ignorance comes into play.

In my opinion ignorance is only that when people intentionally be that way."

nasa,ff8wlbx,t1_ff8r311,1579698478.0,There is judging those unfairly for not knowing something and then there is people who are intentionally being ignorant just to be an ass.  That’s the difference with some people.
nasa,ff8qzce,t1_ff8cmr9,1579692503.0,That’s a excuse to be lazy mate.  People who live in a country should know their history.  Obviously I don’t live in the country where those politicians live so saying I should know them is like saying I should know linear algebra without taking a class.

WWE,ff8qpnl,t1_ff86c4a,1579692144.0,"Well then you would be wrong.  

Again I know this is hard for some main roster fan but do some research.  If you check out what she had done before her first run in wwe you can see that she had always had a strong move set.  Her neck injury severely limited her after that and once the asshole “crackho” chants started from pervo Trish devotees she basically decided she didn’t need to do this anymore.  Then idiot fans actually complained because she quit.  I mean that’s dealing with people whose IQ is far below 70 if you know what I am saying."
