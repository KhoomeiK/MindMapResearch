Showerthoughts,fekdgsw,t3_epj9bc,1579197745.0,"I’ve thought about this (sorta) after Prisoner of Azkaban when Sirius tells Harry to write him. “Send a letter with Hedwig, she’ll know how to find me” or something along those lines. So, even when Sirius was in hiding, an owl (a specific owl?) could find him. Maybe he cast a spell allowing only Hedwig to find him? I dunno.
So, Voldy probably put a spell out for no owls to be able to locate him."

I swear that scene with him was literally the best acting I’ve seen in any movie, EVER.  He was great in a The Report on Netflix too. In Rise, the subtle body changes/mood changes were just fantastic. 

I’m going to have to go back through his filmography."
