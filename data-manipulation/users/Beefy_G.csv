A proper president knows without needing to be told that soliciting assistance in an election through actions clearly meant to smear the (at the time) top opponent *twice*. An improper president takes every opportunity dropped in their lap to commit overly controversial tactics that question the legal integrity of the process.

Let's say you're from Germany, smack dab in the middle, saaaay Gottengen. How's that sound?

Maybe five hours and you're reaching Switzerland and Austria. So between a three to five hour window you're able to reach so many different cultures and languages. That's a mindblowing thing when you think about it.

Now I'm from Seattle, Washington, US. It's about a two hour drive to Oregon. Five hour drive to Spokane and Pullman (in the same state on the east side).

The money got moved there and the change altered the company from engineering developments to building passenger planes. Their superior tech plateaued eventually, by allowing the competitors to essentially ""catch up"", and naturally the business started to fall. Now we've got technology that's faulty causing the Maxes to fall and be pulled from production for the time being. All of this because the share holders decided engineering developments wasn't good enough for them and wanted their presence more publically seen in passenger airliner industry.

I was visibly upset that Christmas because I looked like such an A-hole son who didn't get any of his siblings anything for Christmas. Even my brother who's going through Med school and in debt with student loans for it got everyone gifts."

magicTCG,fcu84gu,t3_eivsqq,1577974814.0,"This takes me back to when I started Magic ages ago and my feelings about green at that young age, however inconsistent or inaccurate it may have been. I felt, back then, that green was all about the creatures and was opposed to the magic aspect. Though there were spells that buffed creatures that I recall but the overall focus was the creatures.  Now we have a creature that counters, in a sense, opposing magic casters that also creates more creatures that I would assume despise magic as much as their mother, it's indoctrinated after all. Looks like a fun card."
