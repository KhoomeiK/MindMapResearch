educationalgifs,fck1jt6,t1_fcjwnpk,1577713750.0,"Actually i tought about it again. No its the minimum distance, since we are talking about the minimum speed. If it was faster, say 500 m/s then it would travle 4km in the same time. If its faster it goes further in the same time. I tought you where right at first, it kinda messes with your head when you think about it to much. But if you put nummbers to it, it gets easier."
educationalgifs,fcjwwj4,t1_fcjwceb,1577708602.0,"I am no scientist so this is just what i think happens. A shockwave is only created when a disturbance in the air is moving at the speed or faster than sound. 
But since i am not smart enough to know or explain i went ahead and copied the following from wikipedia: 

In physics, a shock wave (also spelled shockwave), or shock, is a type of propagating disturbance that moves faster than the local speed of sound in the medium.

So yes it is and does travle faster than sound. 

Hope that helped :)"
educationalgifs,fcjpqbp,t1_fcjozxp,1577698419.0,"So i was trying to find a formula for this for a long time now. First i tought 1 good boy step = 1/3 human step. But i realised that not all dogs are the same size (mind blowing, right?) So i decided instead of messing with the distance, id mess with the time instead. Now this is a lot easier because its pretty well accepted that 1 dog year = 1/7 human year. So sound speed = 49m/ds (dog second). It took 56ds for the shockwave to go from explosion to camera. 56×49 = 2744. So its still 2.7km because dog meters are the exact same as human meters. The formula just looks a little diffrent. Tell that to your good bo *ahem* i mean friend."
educationalgifs,fcjlni7,t1_fcjkg0k,1577692762.0,"I am not sure if this is correct but from what i know, a shockwave is just faster than the speed of sound but can be anywhere above that. We could callculate the min. distance tho. It takes about 8 sec. for the wave to get from the explosion to the camera. The speed of sound is 343 m/s. So 343 x 8 = 2744. So its at least 2.7 Km or 1.7 miles away."
