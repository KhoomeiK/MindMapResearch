EntitledBitch,ffhw65x,t3_etopl5,1579956644.0,How many times a year are there stories in the US where people are killed by those who have diplomatic immunity from drunk driving or women being raped?  All a country can legally do is kick them out of the country then revoke their status so if they come back. They are no longer protected.

EntitledPeople,fejr0su,t3_ep8p9p,1579183683.0,"So they were gone roughly 8 hrs? (3 hrs ea way plus eating time). So if the baby pooped itself within 15 of them leaving, the baby would have sat in its own filth for 7.5 hrs.  I'm pretty that's child abuse in 99% of the US and other parts of the world.  You need to report this to your local child services ASAP.  If they are telling you to do that as a baby sitter, who knows what they are doing at home.  That call could save the kid's life"
