Op proved that point when they stated that there were over 3,500 attacks in a single year. (2018)
So are Dobermans, Rottweilers, German shepherds. Etc.
As someone who has owned a pit bull I very clearly said not all pit bulls are dangerous.

So you all can keep adding whatever words you like to my narrative to make my logic sound flawed, but the narrative stands.

In you original post You DID NOT say “pit bulls are less dangerous than beds” (or anything else you feel like comparing them too). You said they are NOT dangerous.

    I’ve been around long enough to see it happen for Dobermans, Rottweilers, and German Shepard’s, etc.
Here’s the thing though, they are right. And they are right about Pit bulls. These are dangerous dogs and if you don’t believe that these dogs can be dangerous than you are not a responsible dog owner.
They ARE an aggressive breed, but so are many others. And the mere fact that you added the word “fighting”  to your statement proves this because that is what some people are using them for.
