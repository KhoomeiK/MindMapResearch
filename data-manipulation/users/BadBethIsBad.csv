I would try to explain both sides of the argument, and why I chose a particular side.

""Can you believe BadBethisBad thinks that a border wall keeps immigrants IN  America instead of OUT? She has so much to learn, I don't know where she gets these ideas!"" Sooo, she starts harmlessly enough, then escalate to agitate me, and finishes the meal in private behind my back like she is eating a goddamn ortalan. Soo, I stopped talking to her. No opinions, no directions, no telling her not to worry, just shrugging and an occasional ""damn that's crazy."" Or, ""I have no idea! Maybe you should ask X."""

Don't attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance. ( That's probably not the exact quote.)

 You got this! Be assertive but polite. Know exactly what behavior you're addressing before sitting down. Cook her a meal first maybe, then broach the subject. I cooked you lots of meals, it's time for you to return the favor! Ask her what her personal favorite is and have her cook it for you."
