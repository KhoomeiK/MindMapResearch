todayilearned,fevd5qo,t1_feuut8t,1579395986.0,"It's downright cruel how few resources some very wealthy areas are willing to allocate to mental health. In the US my doctor had to send me ""involuntarily"" to a state psyche facility in a cop car because the wait time to see a psychiatrist was like 4 months.  
  
After getting misdiagnosed at that horribly underfunded facility in Florida and given meds that threw me into psychosis, I put up the money to move states and check in to an upscale, private facility where I was properly treated.   
  
If I hadn't been able to afford that treatment I have little doubt I would have eaten a 12 gauge. Richest country in the world but we can't give sick people the tools to make life worth living. It's disgusting.  
  
Fun fact: while this was going on, Florida was ranked 51st in spending on mental healthcare, and the governor was a man who committed the largest Medicare fraud in history. Apparently people suffering from illness don't deserve shit, but people who steal billions from the healthcare system deserve the highest position in state government."

 resignation and ordered the postoffice at Indianola closed on
 January 2, 1903. The postoffice was suspended, not abolished,
 because legally every seat of county government was entitled
 to postal facilities. Roosevelt emphasized that Indianola still
 had a postoffice and a postmaster who would continue to
 draw her salary. Whenever Mrs. Cox could resume her
 duties, normal postal service would be restored. In the mean-
