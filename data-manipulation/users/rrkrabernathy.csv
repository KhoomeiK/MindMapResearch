So a dad share and a kid shark are swimming near the shore one day when the dad shark tells the son that today is the day he wants to teach him how to snack on humans. 

The dad shark says that he needs to swim around them a bit, jut your fin out of the water and do three circles. 

The son shark asks dad shark why they need to do the circling. Dad shark replies that they taste better when they’ve had the poop scared out of them. 

Da dum tah!  Thank you folks. I’ll be here all week."

Any responsible community in the US with a proper emergency dispensing or mass casualty protocol (which many and hopefully most do) would do the same or at least have similar protocols that involve segregation of potentially infected persons. 

We just, very fortunately, haven’t had to face this. Please don’t be a conspiracy peddling, spitballing speculator. This is proper procedure for an emerging large scale mass outbreak. Not just in China, but should this go down in the US the process is likely to be the same."
