literature,fgsw73f,t3_f0bm5b,1581093925.0,A relative of mine decided to start her career as a novelist and basically insisted we all read her first book. I got maybe a chapter in before the grammar mistakes made it too annoying to continue.
dogs,fgmiu8p,t1_fglbnn2,1580925446.0,"Yeah, I've yet to see this kind of thoroughness here. You are right about the number of strays here. It's frankly unbelievable."
BanPitBulls,fgl6g5h,t3_ez4ion,1580883629.0,"Well, it obviously matters a lot that the latter is definitely false and the former has quite a bit of truth to it(6% personally feels kinda low and probably is due to mislabelling and whatnot). It's also just so blatantly wrong to compare the two, especially in the US. The latter statement is a stereotype that was invented to get people to vote for bills that would disproportionately incarcerate black people, particularly black men. The former is what happens when you selectively breed dogs for aggressiveness for a century or more."
dogs,fgl3m90,t1_fgkzgyn,1580880957.0,"I would be curious to know if these experiences vary by region. Here in the south, I have seen a lot of dogs mislabelled that are clearly pit bulls. The shelter closest to me does a good job of being honest about problems a dog has(ex. ""Yeah he bit one of our techs so I wouldn't advise going for him""), but I've still seen them mislabel plenty of dogs. That is probably the best shelter near me, and it gets much, much worse from there."
unpopularopinion,ffz8l94,t3_evxvil,1580367368.0,"I don't really like this simply because your statement is way too general. This issue varies from sport to sport, so it's not a good idea to generalize. On the whole, while I don't disagree with you entirely, there are some nuances here. 

First, the loudest proponents of this have been the women's national team, who actually do bring in more revenue compared to the men's national team and also bring home trophies. They definitely have a point when they ask for equal pay because their financial and athletic success surpasses that of the men. 

Second, many people assume that leagues like the WNBA want equal pay, when in fact most of their players are simply asking for better pay. Many of them define better pay as matching what female athletes in Europe are paid, which is also not entirely unreasonable. There are a lot of financial details that may inhibit this, but the request itself is not unwarranted. 

Third, income in sports has never entirely been based on the revenue you draw. If it were, players in New York and LA should consistently earn more than players in smaller cities. They don't, because organizations in smaller cities value trophies are a willing to pay to get one, even if they are not seeing the same revenue returns as say a team in New York. While female athletes do not always draw the revenue that the men do, they have definitely helped fill our national trophy cabinet in recent years. The most success American tennis player is a woman. We have won a number of gold medals at the Olympics thanks to our outstanding female athletes. Based on the income model that exists in most sports, they deserve a pay hike for these accomplishments. 

I'm not saying they have to be paid as much as the men, but I do think that sometimes their requests for a pay bump are shrugged off a little too easily."
unpopularopinion,ffujah6,t1_ffui4eu,1580243145.0,"I grow a little tired of people assuming what the south is like without having lived here for a significant amount of time. It has plenty of problems, but most of the people I know are nice and don't do crazy shit like this."
unpopularopinion,ffuhotu,t1_ffuh49b,1580242170.0,"I think he's trying to say that the OP doesn't understand that this is nowhere near as common as OP thinks it is. I have also lived in the ""Bible Belt"" my entire life and my parents are both super religious and come from super religious families. I have never once heard of something like this happening."
booksuggestions,ffu07np,t1_fftlbwl,1580231631.0,They kicked you out of the book club over one selection? Wow that's extra.
CFB,fftzi7x,t1_fftobjw,1580231135.0,"The hype y'all are getting in the media is a little much and probably feeds into this problem. You guys were a very good team this year, but expecting a definite win against Georgia is a tall order considering how good that defense is. People forget that even great coaches like Tom Osborne and Mack Brown weren't going 11-1 every year. Mullen will eventually get you to a playoff, but people need to accept that the conditions are not what they were in in the late 2000s and he can't pull an Urban Meyer."
accenture,ffs2d51,t1_ffrvzto,1580171431.0,"I would double check to make sure.  I would also interview at some other places and see if you can get something different. Joining TDP as an associate isn't the worst, but there are a lot of people who join as an analyst and there is a pretty significant pay gap. You might not think it's a big deal now, but I've seen people get frustrated with the difference in salary."
accenture,ffrljfm,t3_euumyq,1580160523.0,"I know some people who started as associates and all of them were assigned to a delivery center. Being at a delivery center is very different from the experience others in TDP have because you are assigned to one specific thing and don't change projects every 4-6 months. I've heard it can be difficult to transition out of the delivery center, so honestly you might be better off staying in your current role unless they bump you up to analyst."
deeplearning,ff6ddma,t1_ff5jt5c,1579624749.0,"As many have said, Colab and also AWS are good resources. If you really want to build your own machine, focus on RAM, SSD, and GPU, in that order. Only buy the GPU once you have enough of the other two. I would probably say at least 32gb of ram and a 1TB SSD if you want flexibility and future proofing. You can always add more RAM later, so starting with 32 is fine. As for GPU, do not get anything but a 2080 TI, or whatever the equivalent is when you end up buying. Titans are too pricey to put in a personal machine, and the cheaper stuff has too little VRAM to really help you all that much. I would say probably go for an I5 or I7 series processor, or whatever the Ryzen equivalent is. 

All of this aside, I really wouldn't get your own machine unless you were very comfortable with hardware, have the extra cash, and really need something that can run jobs so often that your other options would be too expensive. I have a personal machine and honestly seldom use it."
deeplearning,ff590an,t3_erpwgh,1579583839.0,"Which deep learning courses? Many of them run on a server they have set up, so your machine's specs shouldn't matter. Personally, I wouldn't invest in a new machine just for classes. If you decide to stick with DL seriously after you complete the classes, then look into buying a new machine."
dogs,feovefd,t3_eq70b3,1579306240.0,"I stopped using the dog park because of the humping behavior you described. My dog is senior and has a lot of issues with her hind legs, and this dude just lets his dog hump her. My dog was calm and patient enough to wait for the owner to come over and get the other dog off her, but I was shocked he wasn't more precautious about it, especially when a different dog could've reacted very poorly to being humped like that."
consulting,febqeod,t1_feawt8x,1578961584.0,"No. It's still there, just under a different name and they merged two of the regions."
accenture,fe49p98,t3_enrs9y,1578857106.0,"Pretty sure they provide you a bag. When I started lunch was also provided. Honestly the main thing is be well rested and ready to absorb material. They throw a lot at you in the first few days about how the company works, where all the web pages are that you'll need to use regularly, and what the policy is around stuff like time and expenses and travel. The only thing I remember needing to bring was the documents for my I-9 verification(if you're not in the US this won't apply to you). Other than that, just make sure you've got all the online on boarding paperwork completed beforehand and you should be good to go."
dogs,fe3nq50,t3_enp9ke,1578851118.0,"Given what you said about his background, you're probably the first human he's had a reliable relationship with in a long time. Our older shelter dog was like this too, so she got really upset whenever she couldn't be right there with us. Once she got settled into the routine and knew we weren't abandoning her every time we left the room, a lot of the whining and barking stopped. It wouldn't hurt to talk to the vet and see if anything else is causing it or if they happen to have any solutions you haven't tried yet."
literature,fdxfvrc,t1_fcrg13v,1578768342.0,"The Fox is great. I read Lady Chatterly's Lover in undergrad. There's things about it that I liked, but it also definitely brought out some of the less enlightened views on socioeconomic class from my peers. I've been meaning to reread it outside of the academic context because I feel like my first impression was tainted somewhat by my frustrations with my classmates. It certainly has some fascinating characters and worth the read if you have the time."
literature,fdxcdyg,t3_el3spm,1578767393.0,"I'll go with Kiki from On Beauty by Zadie Smith and Leila from 10 minutes 38 seconds in this strange world by Elif Shafak. Kiki's awareness of the world around her and her very high emotional intelligence make her an interesting character to read in a novel where she is surrounded by people, including her husband, who don't acknowledge her intelligence the way they should. Leila's character is so interesting because she has a talent for finding something to be happy about amidst very difficult circumstances. She is very pragmatic in a lot of ways, but she also has a genuine belief that friendships, both with other humans and with animals, can make any challenge more bearable. I found the perspectives of both characters to be very refreshing and enjoyable. Smith and Shafak usually write wonderful characters in general, but I think these two are probably my favorites."
suggestmeabook,fd6t37a,t3_ek1k32,1578195370.0,"I had a lot of luck with book selections last year. 10 minutes 38 seconds in this strange world by Elif Shafak was beautifully written and told one of the most moving and thought provoking stories I've read in a long time. I also read the forty rules of love by Shafak. I don't like it as much as the other novel, but it is still incredibly well written and engaging. 

Swing Time by Zadie Smith was very interesting once I had the time to reflect on it, but it can be a bit tedious to get through and probably isn't her best book. It is still probably one of the most insightful books about identity I have read. 

The man who saw everything by Deborah Levy had a nice idea but reading through the perspective of that narrator was painful.

I think the book I have perhaps the most mixed feelings about is the Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai. It is incredibly moving and has some memorable characters, but the subplot about the art deal drags on for too long and there are a couple plot points I'm not a fan of but can't discuss without giving the whole ending away."
