How serious this is completely depends on the overlap between the time people are contagious and when they have symptoms. If they start showing symptoms and then are contagious, it's fairly straightforward to get it under control. If they are contagious a long time before show symptoms, then it could get ugly.

3. Korea's public health care should make a huge difference. With ~~SARS~~  MERS, a lot of the outbreak was traced to poor sanitation/procedures at a major hospital in Seoul (Samsung Asan, iirc), which was embarrassing as hell for them.

Likewise, a lot of the SARS (MERS?) infections in China were eventually traced to contamination from people not washing their hands after taking a shit. When it came to Korea, the infections dropped right off because the level of basic hygiene is apparently better.

Plus, there was a major measles outbreak (worldwide) last year, with some cases in Korea. Again, the hospitals had a lot of practice handling highly contagious diseases, so hopefully, they're better able to handle this one without accidently creating more cases."
