She has an innocent style face but she's almost naked and she's ripping off her T-shirt - in public I guess. If this was a panel in a manga, you'd be thinking ""what's happening in this scene?"" Her facial expression doesn't match her actions.

Her boobs are enormous but they look static - these are not boobs that move. her pose is rather neutral - it's fine, but it's just meh. She could have a more dynamic pose or have a neutral stance but with a compelling facial expression as the focal point of the figure.

The trouble with oil and coal (and nuclear) is that they look dirty, and because they look dirty people think of fossil fuels as ""dirty energy"" and Renewables as ""clean energy"" - and there is some truth in that, but (a) carbon is NOT a ""pollutant"", there is no evidence that it causes ""Global Warming"" and even if it did there are significant benefits to a warmer planet, and (b) we just don't have the technology yet to create genuinely clean and cost-efficient Wind or Solar. Hydro is sometimes viable, but dams are often viewed as destructive."
Documentaries,fc5wyo3,t1_fc5rgjg,1577467642.0,"The man is more than clever enough to understand the destructiveness of Socialism; he describes himself as a ""libertarian socialist"" - whatever that means - but what he advocates for is simply Socialism. He uses the same old argument that Socialism as seen in the Soviet Union and China was not ""real"" Socialism, but there's nothing different in his proposed solutions to their already failed solutions. 

Chomsky has been quietly steering the opinions of privileged students of  the elite liberal colleges and Universities of the whole Western World (not just America) for generations, using them to undermine Western values and the West's belief in their own identities. He is a powerful man and he wants to destroy the Western World. To some degree I think he has succeeded.

It's hard to pin Noam Chomsky down on anything, you won't know he's spewing BS until he's talking about a subject that you are intimately familiar with and can see the Big Lies - When Noam Chomsky proclaimed his support for Jeremy Corbyn (he says he would have voted for him to be British Prime Minister), Americans and Canadians and most Europeans wouldn't know what the big deal is, but I know Jeremy Corbyn's background and beliefs well enough to understand that Noam Chomsky was endorsing a very dangerous and deluded man. 

Here's a list of rebuttals against claims that Noam Chomsky has made over the decades; it's an opinion piece so of course it's open to criticism, but I think it's pretty accurate. http://www.paulbogdanor.com/chomsky/250chomskylies.pdf"

Second, ""renewables"" are getting cheaper only in the sense that the equipment is getting cheaper to build, which is what happens with any technology. That's not a bad thing, but meanwhile environmentalists are turning a blind-eye to the technological revolutions in coal and oil as if they don't count.
