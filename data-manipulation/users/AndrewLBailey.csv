AskReddit,ff66mgv,t3_erocgb,1579620385.0,"I would imagine the worst part of wearing glasses is your wife never letting you read anything. Reading is your passion, your true love. You take every opportunity to read whatever you can but you wife forbids it. While on break from your job at the bank, you sneak down to the vault. So you can eat and read in peace. Suddenly, a nuclear bomb goes off, killing everybody? You are safe because you were unconscious in the vault. It takes some time but you are doing what you can to find peace and acceptance in the new Armageddon. One day when all seems lost, you happen upon a library. So many books unharmed? Thousands and thousands of books. You make a stack of books for January, one for February, a giant one for next year, ect ect. Finally, peace and happiness is upon you. Once the overwhelming feeling of bliss hits, you bend over and break your only pair of glasses. Still in this Hellish Armageddon, still have books but no way to read them. That is how I, a no glasses wearer sees the worst part of wearing glasses."
