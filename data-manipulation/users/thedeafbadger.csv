You’re not an asshole because of how you *feel* about the situation. You’re the asshole for how you *responded* to those emotions.

Your feelings are totally justified and I understand your pain, but your reaction to those emotions was childish and uncalled for."

bartenders,fek16ut,t3_epigbh,1579190407.0,"Dude, you are the shit! My first job was in a dive bar and I finally made my way into a craft cocktail bar that I enjoy. There are plenty of valid styles of bartending and the high volume dive is definitely one of them! I never made more money in my life than working in a dive. 

To be honest, I often feel this sub (and the bartending community in general) can be ultra toxic. A lot of people have this mentality that there is a “correct” style of bartending and this is often prevalent amongst craft cocktail bartenders. These people are narcissistic artists.

The only correct style of bartending is the one where you adapt to the needs of the establishment you’re working in. 

The truth is that most of these people would drown in a dive bar. The lightning-speed pace, the thankless guests, the lack of standards, the sheer filth, all the things that would never fly in an upscale bar, it’s tough and definitely a valid profession.

If you’re happy working where you’re at, that’s great! You don’t need to know the history of the Old Fashioned or the proper technique to make a perfect Ramos gin fizz to be a good bartender.

Keep doing your thing and keep focusing on getting a little bit better each day. Haters gonna hate."
