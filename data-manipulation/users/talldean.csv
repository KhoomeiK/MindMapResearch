I'm less calibrated on PE/SRE roles, so I can't give a perfect description here, but I'd say that all E6+ are excellent communicators, and all senior PE seem to be excellent debuggers, even if they're not directly writing much code.

Besides debugging, there's a handful of skills in the job, several of which are damn important.  If you're an alright coder, but exceptional at some of those other skills, we generally want you to find a role where you're doing somewhat less code, doing what you're truly exceptional at, and everyone kinda wins.

Besides working on the mid-foot balance (this is a bit too far into the heels), one thing I'd eventually play with is foot position.  Your toes look pointed a bit farther out than I'm used to seeing, and from this camera angle, it's hard to see how your knees are tracking; knees seem good (so foot position might be just fine), but I'd play with toes pointed a bit more forward, and see how it felt."
StartingStrength,ffbw3bc,t1_ffbqamv,1579784703.0,"If your butt is farther back, and your shins more vertical, you use your glutes/butt more in a squat.  If your butt is farther forward, and your shins and knees move substantially more forward of your toes, you're in a quad dominant squat.

Usually, front squats are quad dominant, low bar squats are glute dominant, and high bar squats are in the middle.  This squat looks a bit too far back - weight is on the lifter's heels - so it's more glute-dominant than a low bar squat should probably be, which will limit the amount of weight they can lift.  (All glutes means you're leaving your quads out of it, which means less muscle to move the weight.)"
nutrition,ffbvofe,t3_eslrag,1579784318.0,"For food, I usually go one of four ways, usually picking two.

* Scrambled eggs.  Lots of them, with a bit of salt and a ton of pepper
* Oatmeal.  3/4 of a cup dry, 1.5 cups of water, boil, serve.
* Yogurt, maybe add some granola if I missed the oatmeal today.
* Shake  


The shake is one of two choices:

*  Optimum Nutrition Pro Gainer, vanilla.  Delicious, but the sweetener might not be good for me longterm, so...
* Two scoops whey protein powder, half a frozen banana, two cups kale/spinach/greens, blend.

Most folks I've seen would do a cycle of high rep workouts with lower weights, then weeks later medium reps, medium weights, then weeks later low reps, high weights... then increase the weight and do the cycle again. Cycles could run 4-12 weeks; you'd likely add weight to the bar every month, and when that runs thin, get to a point where it's every three.

homeowners,ff6vxrg,t3_ery6c0,1579635990.0,"Heating efficiency is rated in HSPF.  

Electric heaters - not heat pumps - are rated as 3.41, and are generally the most expensive heat.  

The advantage of electric heaters is they only heat the rooms you're using, not the entire house, so they might be cheaper regardless.  They also work regardless of what temperature it is, and last a long time, 25+ years.

Gas/oil furnaces burn dinosaurs, and make heat.  They dry out the air when they make said heat.  They work regardless of temperature, and last a long time, probably 20-25 years..  For the same amount of heat, assuming you're heating the whole house, they're better than an electric heater.  Might be forced air, might be radiators, but still cheaper than electric.

Heat pumps use electricity to move heat from space to space; basically stick an air conditioner in the window backwards in the winter, and it air conditions the outside and dumps the extra heat into your house.  These get to be 3-4x the efficiency of electric heaters, but they only last \~15 years.  They also work as air conditioners in the summer, in many cases.  They're less efficient when it's below 0F outside, and at -20F, none of them produce heat; you'd need a backup system in very cold climates.

Mini splits are heat pumps with large units in each room and a shared outside unit.  Maximum efficiency, as you're not pushing air through ducts, and you're only heating specific areas of a home, not the whole thing all the time.  Same 15 years as regular heat pumps, same ""bad performance below 0F"", but heating + air conditioning + efficient + not dry air."
