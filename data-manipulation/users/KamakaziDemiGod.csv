I'm not sure why they declined in popularity but I imagine it's just because digital cameras and phones become more common and much easier to use, but it's a shame as with modern materials you could make even better ones.

Personally I think it looks like innocent fun, there is no indication that anything bad is afoot and the kid seems to be enjoying it.

I think playing games like this can be important to a child's early development, they need to be challenged both in play and serious times like meals, you just have to be careful not to encourage playing with food. 

That's just my opinion though."
