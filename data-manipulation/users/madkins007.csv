AskReddit,ffiwzkr,t3_etnhf3,1579984755.0,"Being fat is depressing. Having to be careful where you sit, having a limited selection of clothes that fit, hauling that weight all over the place, and every other daily struggle is bad enough, but when you add society's judgmental attitude to it, it gets so much worse.

The idea that \*I\* have value and am lovable, capable, and appreciated is strong and helps. It does not mean you are perfect, nor does it overlook that you, like all people, have flaws and issues. 

Trying to deal with losing weight and getting healthier is so much easier when you feel good about yourself.

As an aside- people who think fat shaming helps, or is for the person's own good, or whatever are motherfu\*\*ing a\*\*holes who need to realize how incredibly harmful and evil their comments are."

coolguides,ff189pv,t3_er1vnt,1579476210.0,"There are a few ways to make these. What we did back in the day was to dig a trench with one end sloping and the other squared up. Build and start the fire, then lay sticks and sod over the 'middle' section. 

Its not a great way to do things- you gotta make sure the soil is mostly mineral, rather than loam or such (ie- no tree roots that would burn). It takes a lot of work and it is a real pain making the cooking end functional (it is easiest to just use a tripod and hang a cooking surface over the hole.) It is also hard to tend the fire well. 

The benefits are supposed to be less smoke and reduced chance of wildfire. It's easier to just use a good stove."
coolguides,fezpjss,t1_feyrahd,1579460051.0,"Where your bag goes often depends more on the design of your bag than anything else. Some bags have compartments or attachment points at the bottom, while others have attachment points at the top.

Where you are hiking also makes a difference. Attaching the bag at top means it can more easily snag on branches or catch strong winds.

In the older backpacking days, we often used the bag and pad against the back of the rucksack for the padding it provided."
IsItBullshit,fezj9aa,t1_feyuq30,1579457924.0,"Except that as you try to actively loose weight, your body responds by changing gears so it becomes harder and harder to keep loosing it, and keeping it off. As you progress, you need to work harder and eat even less to keep the loss going. 

95% of all people who lose weight will gain it back- and usually some more- within a few years largely because of this. 

The idea that it can be boiled down to a simple 'calories in/calories out' equation ignores the complicated processes involved and just lays a giant guilt trip on people who are trying and are already probably unhappy with how badly it is going."

This, though... somehow misses the point. I have seen dozens of posts about 'being forged or purified in fire' and so on that have spoke to me. 

This one, though, is like the old 'Only Elephants Should Wear Ivory' signs years ago- which ignores that walrus, hippopotamus, sperm whale, killer whale, narwhal and warthog have ivory as well.

EDC,fe4uba6,t3_enspo4,1578862828.0,"To me, EDC is the stuff you routinely carry when you are not home or at some sort of 'base location' where, presumably, you have everything you need nearby.

It makes sense to me that this might vary by expected activity. EDC for a quiet day at home might be different than one for a quick grocery run, which might also be different  than one for an extended time away from 'base'. One might add more stuff, or carry different versions of the usual stuff (like a brighter but also larger flashlight).

None of this, however, would mean that we have to remain slaved to one set of devices for our 'usual' EDC. Rotating out based on colors, moods, or just whim seems fair.

But I generally carry the same stuff in the same pockets pretty much anytime I am wearing anything with pockets. This way, I KNOW what I have and can grab it almost instinctively and use it without having to invest a lot of brain cycles."

personalfinance,fdcsap3,t3_eknio9,1578282876.0,"If you are really trying to save money-

* Good meat is expensive, even at Costco. Save money using cheaper cuts prepared properly for the kind of cut it is.
* Pop is just acidic sugar water. Water, ice tea, and so on would be cheaper and healthier.

Other ways to save money-

* The 'budget' stuff, whether at a dollar store, or the budget stuff at the other stores, is almost never worth it. It is usually intentionally made a bad, cheap deal by adding water or other cheap ingredients, being less actual product than other options, etc.
* Gift cards and gift wrap. Get it at the dollar store, use creative wrapping options, etc.
* Bottled water- avoid like the plague- it is always a bad value
* Shop at Lidl or Aldi for most of your groceries, or at a Walmart. 
* Look for one of the better-rated 'pay as you go' phone plans. Several are pretty cheap with good service.
* Monitor your TV use and create a package that works for you, whether it is dropping cable or some mix of streaming services... or just using the library and borrowing stuff to watch

Mostly- keep track of everything for a few months and aggressively look for where the black holes are- eating out? An expensive hobby? Too much debt? Plugging a BIG budget hole (like eating out too often) will probably reap better benefits than plugging several tiny holes."

Omaha,fcwi9h3,t3_ej4f4o,1578026338.0,"Places with comfy seating, good light and temps, usually good wifi, restrooms/water fountains, and often a place to get food or snacks would include:

\- Hospital lobbies and public waiting areas. Nebraska Med has several such places. Parking can be a problem.

\- College student centers or 'waiting/gathering' areas in school buildings

\- Large community centers, especially those that include college classes or libraries

\- Big malls often have 'semi-hidden' places that would work. Westroads used to have one near the sporting goods store.

\- Large movie theaters usually have nice seating where early people wait for others in their group before going into the movie.

Becoming a 'regular' at a bar, coffee or tea shop, or other place you like would probably benefit you in the long run. Order at least something small every hour or so, tip nicely, leave your area neat, don't hog the best seating, slip out when it gets busy, and know when you've overstayed your welcome would help make you a favored customer.

Outside spots are easier, especially if you bring some cushions, pillows, etc. to make your location more comfy. A good folding chair, a cheapo screen hut, and such would make a nice little reading nook in a park. There are some hidden spots in several parks near me where I can just back up the car, open the back and have an almost instant place to read and even dine.

Heck, plan and build yourself an indoor and outdoor reading space in your home. I can easily envision making myself something like an adult treehouse, or a little open-sided shed with a firepit, or something similar for a nice 3-season reading place."

A decent starter setup for Russian or Sulcata would be similar. Here is a fairly cheap starter setup.

LARGE plastic tub or aquarium. Look for something that is at least 8 times longer than the tort is, and about half that for the width. Dump an inch of hardwood chips on the bottom. (Nothing that has a strong pine odor. I like cypress, but some things are easier to find in other places.)

WARM the habitat up to about 80F average. You can do this in several ways.

\- Undertank heater, or waterproof heating coils under the substrate. 

\- Overtank heat lamp or (better yet) ceramic heating element. Either one needs to be in a ceramic/heat-proof socket. The ceramic heating element (CHE) is better insofar as you can leave it on all the time without flooding the habitat with light. Better yet is using 2 or more smaller CHEs on thermostatic controllers. That lets you tune in a warmer side and a cooler side without having to constantly monitor and tinker.

LIGHT the habitat with a fluorescent bulb that emits UV-B rays (it should say specifically UV-B, not just UV) that is as long as the habitat is. Position it above the habitat by the height the instructions state. Put it on a timer so it is on about 6-8 hours a day. Use a regular incandescent bulb or a 'daylight simulator' LED bulb on the warm side set to 8-10 hours a day. This helps provide plenty of good, balanced light and a little bit of a dawn and dusk. You can read up on the benefits of UV-B lighting for reptiles and other pets.

HIDES and furniture- the tort NEEDS a hide on the cooler side- just a box with a big hole in the side is fine. A 'humid hide' is also a good idea- this is just a box with a hole and some lightly dampened moss in it. A tupperware type container with a lid is enough here. (Turn it upside down so it is nice and stable.) Position it on the warmer side so it gets humid inside.

Simple decor otherwise are things like hills to climb. Plants and furniture are not real important at this point and the torts will mostly just shove them around.

FOOD and WATER DISHES- look for a water dish the tort can rest in and the water would come about 1/3rd to 1/2 way up the shell, with enough texture to let it climb out easily. Sink the water dish into the substrate. I like plastic plant saucers, with some pebbles in the bottom if needed to control the depth. Food dish- my favorite is just some folded newspaper I can toss after each meal. 

HUMIDITY is not that important for those species.

I hope this gets you started."
InvertPets,fcs1n3d,t3_ea6cvw,1577910051.0,"Iceberg lettuce has an undeserved bad reputation. It is a good source of water, vitamins A and K, and other nutrients and micro-nutrients. It isn't a 'rich' or 'dense' food item, and nearly any darker green leafy vegetable is a better choice, but it is not horrible... 

Well, except for one big minus- it has a bad calcium/phosphorus ratio. You can study up on the Ca/P on your own, but we usually want a ratio of 1.5:1 (or more calcium than phosphorus) but iceberg is 1:3 (roughly three times the phosphorus than calcium). HOWEVER- there is so little of either in the lettuce that you can easily re-balance it with anything that has a decent amount of calcium in it.

Historically, lots of torts and veggie-eating reptiles got fed iceberg-heavy diets and developed skeletal problems (soft, stunted bones, malformed jaws, etc.). Trying to teach a better diet plan resulted in making iceberg the bad guy, so now the main message is 'iceberg bad', rather than 'iceberg OK as a part of a balanced, varied diet'."
