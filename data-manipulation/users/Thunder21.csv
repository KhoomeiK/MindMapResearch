Theres a bunch of ifs. But op is supporting his family, and has plans to be able to continue supporting his family. It's also his money and everyone seems happy with the situation so I dont see a problem with his plan. 

Offering to pay your SO's tuition outright is a lot different than keeping food on the table & the lights on while continuing your school, when it comes to letting her know how much he has."
