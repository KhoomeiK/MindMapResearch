insaneparents,ffjzj7u,t3_etrq2p,1580011273.0,"My brother and his wife decided to ""abandon"" my mother when they had twins.  My Mom kinda freaked and tried everything to make them accept her which included some not-so-good decisions (knocking on their door at 9 PM yelling that she deserved to see her grandsons for one).  My brother took her to court and got a restraining order.  My Dad and I were disappointed that my brother took it so far but Dad gave Mom basically the same advice as this therapist did.  She took it and when my sister became pregnant she (my sister) went out of her way to include Mom and Dad.  So, they are much closer to her children.  My brother, seeing this, actually told Dad he was upset that Mom and Dad didn't come out to see his children as often as they flew out to see my sister's kids.  Dad laughed and told him that was his choice, not theirs.  Now we all visit more or less normally but Dad (we lost Mom a year ago) will always be closer to my sister's kids since he was part of their lives since before they were born."

AmItheAsshole,ffjlexo,t1_ffjcyhq,1580000931.0,"This sounds good but could easily become the ""oh no my baby fell and scrapped her knee and now is crying I'd better take her in to a specialist because she must have some physical disability that made her fall"" type thing.  I am a teacher and I have seen children coddled into believing anything that they can't do easily is some symptom of a disability that prevents them from doing it.  We don't know this kid.  You interpret his failure to launch as a problem a professional can fix.  Others interpret it as him being lazy.  Either way, we are off topic.  The question here is if OP is TA for using antics appropriate for the Playboy mansion to get their child to leave."
AmItheAsshole,ffjkrso,t1_ffjh27c,1580000487.0,"The problem here could be lazy.  Not every child wants to leave home where it is comfortable and easy and someone else pays the bills.  That doesn't make the person mentally ill; it can but it could also just be lazy.  No matter what though, OP and hubby are creepy.  Personally I got stuck on naked grandma hanging in the living room.  Maybe they don't have grandkids but they definitely have children old enough to make them grandparents."

badparents,ffhu3u5,t3_etkp0d,1579953967.0,I am not familiar with tattoos and growth but my guess would be that the tattoo would warp and stretch as the child grew.  Is that correct or do they do they look ok no matter how big you get after the tattoo?

facepalm,ffeusbv,t1_ffetluy,1579866456.0,"I disagree.  I think it is beyond stupid to look at someone's skin color-something that in no way did that person *or you* choose-and think ""yup, I'm better than that person because my skin is the better color"".  I want to ask every racist exactly how hard they think they worked as a fetus to get the ""right"" color of skin."

JUSTNOFAMILY,ff8tjcr,t1_ff8psbo,1579695540.0,"If it is feline leukemia they will probably lose both cats.  When I was a little girl one of our outside cats made its way into our garage where she gave birth to five bald kittens.  My sister and I took a kitten each into the house to ask Mom what was wrong with them.  She wasn't sure.  She said to put them back so the mom could care for them.  The mom had left, leaving her newborn kittens alone.  The next day my Mom's Persian kitten began to act odd and all the kittens were dead.  Mom took the Persian to the vet where she was told it was feline leukemia.  Nothing to do but put the kitten down.  All our outside cats died.  We were told no cats for a year to make sure the infection was gone."

JUSTNOFAMILY,ff536dp,t3_ernshi,1579578968.0,You did not ruin her life.  She did.  She allowed a person to harm her and her children.  You saved her life (if she actually works to figure out why she lets him come back and stops that) and you probably saves the children too.

Several people have said variations on ""we wish we could stay home and get disability checks"".  Really?  You want the chance of sudden death from something as strenuous as walking from the living room to the bathroom?  This lady did the same thing.  She saw a privilege she wanted and wished she could get it.  People are dumb."
entitledparents,ff4lcc8,t1_ff3uo09,1579566399.0,"Preschool children eat messily.  There would be peanut butter on the table, on the child's clothes, hands and mouth.

Teachers,ff2r0o6,t1_ff2qnrz,1579520181.0,"Sorry.  It is confusing and this is my only experience with one.  The county I live in has many small towns in it.  Each of those towns has a school district (ISD).  None of them feel they have a large enough special needs population to provide a special education teacher.  So, they formed a co-op.  Two schools in the co-op serve the entire special needs population and the co-op provides transportation to take the children from one school to a school with a special education teacher.  For example; I teach on the Cushing ISD campus.  The children in my room come from Douglas, Central Heights and Cushing.  Does that explain it?  My lawyer at TSTA was very confused as I was hired by the co-op, contract came from Garrison and my physical location was in Cushing."

Teachers,ff23pm7,t1_ff23btw,1579492960.0,I am in East Texas.  I have two years public school experience and eight at a lab school.  The interviewer gave me credit for the lab school but the fiscal agent refuses to (even after saying he would if I got them to fill out forms stating I was faculty; which I did).  I am glad to know there are lots of places I can find a new school home.
AmItheAsshole,ff21v90,t3_er2zs1,1579491547.0,YTA.  Surely you can handle three *of your own kids* for one night without help.  You did not mention your ex having a new partner so I am assuming she take care of the two you share all by herself every.single.day.
