cats,fdaatp5,t1_fd9l7tk,1578243842.0,He sure is! AHS was wonderfully supportive through the entire adoption process. I couldn’t have been more satisfied and highly recommend!!
cats,fdaaimb,t1_fd92crl,1578243706.0,"Yes! The vet told us he wouldn’t be able to, but it turns out Walter is really passionate about dinner"
cats,fd7e835,t3_ek8pux,1578203094.0,"Walter might have a grumpy face, but he has the biggest heart! He has a paralyzed larynx, meaning that he has a constant grumble that matches his grouchy old man face. His hobbies include sitting on top of the refrigerator, playing with toys, and fucking shit up."
cats,fd7dp3k,t1_fd7dhfv,1578202870.0,"Of course, there could be no better name"
