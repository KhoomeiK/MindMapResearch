Jeep,fdmcand,t1_fdmbxkl,1578545376.0,"So I've tried connecting my phone to the stereo and it says uconnect not available so I assume it just doesn't have Bluetooth. And what would be a good stereo to get for it that does have Bluetooth.

And how easy is it to remove the shell. I only noticed some bolts to take out in the trunk? Or js there more to it?"
