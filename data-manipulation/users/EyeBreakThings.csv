I'd do what the other commenter said and do a PID. I will say with my Silicone heater my temps fluctuate +/-  a bit more than stock.  Do you have a multimeter?  I would check to see if power is still being applied after the temp is reached."

MPSelectMiniOwners,fcwqtza,t1_fcwqfve,1578034002.0,"No, if you are using the DC off the board to power it then that's not it.  I'm using a AC silicone heater (I've only seen AC) where the heater is wired directly into the AC side of the PSU (with a switch wired in, that is controlled by the heater power output on the board).

Not a MOSFET in my case but an actual solid state relay.  The SSR is just used to allow the board to turn the bed on and off.  Without it, the bed would never stop heating.

Edit: Duh, forgot I have a non-stock PSU, so what I'm saying is probably useless here."
MPSelectMiniOwners,fcwpx1l,t3_ejauxe,1578033062.0,"I have a silicone heater, is this an AC heater (I am assuming so)? Are you using a solid state relay?  If not, it's just going to keep on heating up.

Edit: to clarify - if using an AC heater, you are drawing power directly from your AC input, not the DC out on your board.  So, when your board turns off the heater, it does nothing, since the power is coming from the AC input.

So, you can get a solid state relay, that sits in-line with the AC power, and is hooked up to the DC output of the control board.  This works as a switch on the AC power, controlled by the normal operation of the control board over the DC output."
