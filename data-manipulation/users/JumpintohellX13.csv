fatlogic,ff9fujl,t1_ff8dm13,1579712115.0,"People will also use your own insecurities against you. At the hight of my eating disorder I was 100 pounds at 5'8. Some asshole called me fat, because he know it would upset me. All these ""fat activist"" get validation only from how they look and how fat they are. No matter what some asshole is going to say something bad about you, that's life. You need to be okay with yourself, not make others be okay with you. Also, there a lot of good people in the world who don't give a shit about how you look. Be friends with them."

TumblrInAction,ff9d28u,t3_es9gtx,1579710314.0,I never had much of a family growing up. I married my Husband and moved with him to his home town. He's lived there his whole life. He has a wonderful and supportive friends group and they have all been friends since middle school. They welcomed me in with open arms and have been nothing but kind to me. My Husband is blessed to have such loyal friends. This women acts like burning bridges is a good thing.
