""While it is true that taurine was originally isolated from bull semen, it is now produced synthetically. This compound is an “aminosulfonic acid” that is widely distributed in the human body and plays a role in cardiovascular function, development of the nervous system and formation of bile acids."""

Most likely they will say, well none what this jackdonkey is saying is actionable (meaning they can't actually take any punitive action against you) but just like this asshole wants a paper trail of this car conversation, I would start one with your attorney so that you can have them send a follow up on their letterhead should the harassment continue."

The reality is that you are actually correct, most of the time a bartender should stay back and wait for the cops, but one day you'll be a big boy and realize reality has a lot of variables and you do what you think is right at the time to keep others safe."

Didn't have anything too bad happen to me personally, but some of the stories I heard about other bartenders were terrifying.  One guy tried to break up a fight, they both turned on him and he took a bottle of Galliano (a huge liquor bottle almost shaped like bat) to the head.  He suffered physical and psychological damage and was never able to work with the public again after that."
