>And the thing is, **it doesn't particularly matter how truthful these stories are, or how little journalistic integrity these rags have,** because defending ""Democrats are squeaky fucking clean"" is a damn near impossible row to hoe no matter how you slice it. Anything that calls that statement into question (and just about anything can call it into question) immediately undermines your credibility and **forces you to defend your stance** or admit that you're wrong and that Democrats sometimes have scandals.

I *know* it's fake, I said as much myself. How much time did you spend digging for facts and writing all that up? Because if I were an actual Republican voter, it would be a complete waste of time capped with ""FAKE NEWS"" or ""TL;DR Dems are Corrupt.""

If we're looking for actual, *real* sources of Democratic scandal, recent ones, even, how about [Chaka Fattah?](https://www.inquirer.com/news/chaka-fattah-sentencing-appeal-mcdonnell-third-circuit-harvey-bartle-20190712.html) [Jesse Jackson Jr?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Jackson_Jr.) [Anthony *fucking* Weiner?] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weiner) You forget about that guy? Because conservative media sure as hell didn't.

I digress: The thing is, even if *none* of those were real, it doesn't make a goddamn lick of difference to the average Republican advocate. These people don't care about facts, you cannot convince them that what they see on Fox News is propaganda, and the more you try, the more they're going to entrench themselves in their belief that ""both sides are the same,"" or, god forbid, that Democrats are worse overall than Republicans. You don't win that argument by trying to correct the tabloids, *you go on the offensive.* So what if Weiner was sexting minors? Half of Trump's cabinet appear to have been diamond-status members of the Lolita Express, or sharing a choir boy with their local pastor. Who cares if some jagoff stole campaign funds? An entire *state* has been defrauded by Republicans who rigged elections and wiped servers to destroy evidence of tampering.

Like I said before: Democrats are good at policing their own. Whatever corruption exists in the Democratic party is not systemic, at least not apparently. Republicans have been winning this fight for *years* because Democrats strive for the high road and every scandal by an individual is a stumbling block on that road. Meanwhile Republicans have been getting away with figurative murder because they cast the first stone and make it stick. If we're going to win this war, we have to stop pretending Democrats can do no wrong (because anybody can find evidence or ""evidence"" of that being false,) and instead point out the fact that *doing wrong is a cornerstone of the Republican Party.*"

Wasn't even particularly hard to find, really, I just googled 'Democratic party corrupt.' And the thing is, it doesn't particularly *matter* how truthful these stories are, or how little journalistic integrity these rags have, because defending ""Democrats are squeaky fucking clean"" is a damn near impossible row to hoe no matter how you slice it. Anything that calls that statement into question (and just about anything *can* call it into question) immediately undermines your credibility and forces you to defend your stance or admit that you're wrong and that Democrats sometimes have scandals.

Again, your stance should not be that Democrats are clean, but that anything in their closets individually is far outweighed by the fact that Republicans as a whole either condone the corruption in the party implicitly via mouthpieces like McConnell, or that they are corrupt themselves, because it's part and parcel of being a Republican."

>Why would we plant that seed that would lead someone to buying into the right's false equivalency and bothsides arguments? Why would we, without any evidence, just toss that out there to validate the baseless attacks of the right?

Because if we take the complete opposite stance and say ""Democrats are squeaky fucking clean"" we're going to immediately be proven wrong by any number of anecdotes where ""Al Franken pretended to grope a woman"" or ""Bill Clinton was getting BJs in the oval office.""

Pretending that scandal doesn't exist in the Democratic party is a suicidal argument, especially for a party that falls in and out of love with candidates at the drop of a hat. *Everybody* has skeletons in their closet. Democrats' might not be as big and bad as other parties, but they exist all the same, and Republican media has mastered the art of dragging them out and creating scandal where none exists.

The narrative you need to be taking is not that Democrats are perfect, but that whatever scandal anybody else can drag up is outweighed by the fact that Republicans *as a group* are corrupt to the core."

Unemployment might be low but that doesn't mean the local Starbucks can't find anybody else to work a counter, and negative feedback from your employer is a death sentence when competing against everybody else in the labor pool churning out 50+ applications a day.

Here's the thing: on a scale of collectivism vs indivisualism, literally every other country in the world ranks above the U.S. We are so uninclined to help our fellow man that we won't implement policies that help our impoverished *even if they end up saving everyone money.* A lot of us live in a world where our parents pointed towards the door and said ""you're on your own"" once we turned 18. Everywhere else in the world there's a better safety net, either explicitly with laws and regulations, or implicitly with a family unit that will support you should you need to take up a cause.

A lot of people are already *renting* their last fucking leg. I'm a type 1 diabetic, I require regular injections of insulin to live. Even with insurance, my prescription runs me $2-300 for a 90 day supply: without insurance, that cost can be measured in thousands. I did the math, and I can reasonably say that if I were to lose my job tomorrow and couldn't find a job with decent insurance, I could be dead in as little as 18 months, and that's *with* a decent nest egg. There are lots of diabetics who aren't nearly as fortunate as I am, who have already died because they couldn't afford synthetic insulin, because they didn't go viral on GoFundMe, and had to buy the cheap shit from WalMart. Sure, there *might* be programs to help me get the medication I need to live. The way things are going, I'm not counting on them to be there when I need them.

I'm lucky enough to be part of the 1/4 of America that doesn't live paycheck to paycheck, but that doesn't mean I can afford to jeopardize that for even one day of protest, because my job can easily go up in smoke in an At-Will state. So I keep my head down, and continue to be able to afford to live. If you've got a suggestion that can keep me alive if I get spotted downtown, believe me when I say, I'm all ears.

For all the good it does us, being connected to the world and to each other has killed ethos in public discourse. What good is centuries of progress and discovery if Soccermom35 can make a page on Facebook that says ""crystals are more effective than chemotherapy"" and be taken just as seriously as a doctor who spent half her life learning how to diagnose and treat cancer? 

We give a platform to these chucklefucks that's far more effective at spreading misinformation and pseudoscience than it is at correcting and debunking them, and in some cases doesn't want to because it's more profitable to get people emotionally invested in a lie than to steer them away with honesty. And the real problem is, it's not like we can just censor people who spout this stuff, because if we tried, the suppression of speech would unequivocally lead to worse outcomes, especially if the tools to do so fell into the hands of anybody with an agenda.

Anybody can tell you the solution is education, but these people don't *want* to be educated: dogmatic ignorance in the guise of ""sticking to your guns"" has somehow become a virtue in public forums, and facts and truth have become irrelevant, as anyone who won't reconcile their beliefs with reality simply invents ""alternative facts."" How do we win hearts and minds if we can't even agree on what truth is?

I think we're witnessing the beginning of the end. Shit is literally on fire and we can't reach a consensus on that *being* a problem, let alone what the causes are and how to address them. And the tools of misinformation are only getting better. Pretty soon we'll be seeing deepfakes that are indistinguishable from real photos and video.
