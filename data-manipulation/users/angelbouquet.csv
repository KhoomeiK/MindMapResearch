 We are both making compromises at the moment but have already talked about doing the things we are not doing now and instead doing them some time in the future.

  In many ways being with him makes my life better, and I am experiencing more because of him, but as we are both inexperienced there are obviously some exceptions ( like the thing mentioned in 2. and I will talk to him about it tomorrow because it does really bother me.) 

It was also very good to hear that making mistakes is a normal part of life and that it doesn't mean my life will turn out bad because of one bad decision."

Allot of people have been saying that you have been talking about your husband and made posts that show his behaviour to be really abusive. You deserve someone who is happy to see you laugh. Please seek help if he is abusing you. His treatment of you is horrible. I understand it's not easy, because people like that manipulate you in ways that makes leaving tham so much harder, but for your own good and safety please, please talk to real people in your life, friends, family, so he can't hurt you anymore."

Don't be an asshole and4. be willing to listen and compromise. That is much more accurate.

MtF,fddf230,t3_ekkli8,1578309335.0,"This might not be super helpful but what you are describing is something every single woman goes through. Society places pressure on trans and biological women alike to look a certain way. Every woman looks at herself in the mirror and thinks she is somehow not good enough. What you are describing is a phenomena which is an inherent part of being a woman. As much as it sucks and hurts, you should see it as a part of your transition, even a sign that your transition is successful. I know that dysphoria is not the same as just feeling ugly. Obviously they are two very different things, but I really urge you to not give up and continue to go down the path that will eventually lead you to a better relationship with your body. I wish you all the best <3"
