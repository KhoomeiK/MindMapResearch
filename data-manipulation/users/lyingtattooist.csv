pics,fg0hd4w,t1_fg0eakp,1580407825.0,"For us, and I assume this is standard, when we closed on the house the HOA paperwork was one of the thousand forms we sign. The seller wasn't responsible for providing the HOA paperwork. Our real estate agent got that information and had it with our closing documents. That's part of what you are paying your agent for, to make sure you have all the appropriate documents and things to close legally on the house.

But let's say you did a For Sale By Owner deal where you didn't have agents involved, and the HOA stuff never came up. I would assume the HOA would still have legal group to enforce their rules. And at the point you own the house, you would be responsible for any dues.

We need a real estate agent or real estate lawyer to give us accurate answers on what could happen in some weird situation where it was never signed or dues never paid, but from my understanding the HOA will put a lien on your house if you ever go to sell it to get their money then and of course they could always just sue you for unpaid dues."
pics,fg0doix,t1_fg0cs2o,1580405618.0,"Exactly. If you buy a house in a neighborhood with a Home Owners Association, you have to sign the HOA paperwork agreeing to the HOA rules. Can’t buy the house unless you do. You can always try to get on the HOA board to modify rules if you don’t like them, but that’s a whole other nightmare.         
         
There are some good things about HOAs, but for the most part they suck. And on top of it you have to pay HOA dues. Ours are about $250 every six months.         
         
If you can buy a house somewhere that doesn’t have an HOA then go that route. Unfortunately almost all residential neighborhoods have them these days. At least in the USA. Not sure about other countries."

Eventually we’d like to live outside the city with a few acres of land and no HOA, but that’s not feasible right now for us. So we compromised and made sacrifices like having to deal with an HOA."

books,ffs2mla,t1_ffs0pdf,1580171614.0,"No longer true. Comic Book is the term used to represent this medium. It does not imply it’s comedic, and the vast majority of comic books are not comedic.          
         
“The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.”         
                  
“A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word ""novel"" normally refers to long fictional works, the term ""graphic novel"" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is distinguished from the term ""comic book"", which is generally used for comics periodicals.”          
          
Most graphic novels nowadays were originally put out as individual comic book issues and then combined later into a graphic novel. (Although New Kid was not. It was released as a graphic novel.)
