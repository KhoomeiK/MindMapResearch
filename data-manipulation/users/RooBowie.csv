It depends whether you want a social life as well...usually you don't have time, or if you do you're too knackered...it's not just one job being a teacher...it's being a counsellor, social/family worker, child psychologist, mental health support worker, peace keeper, law enforcer, data analist (yes, I spelled it like that on purpose), administrator...the last goes on, and that's without taking on any extra responsibilities to increase your salary. 
You'll catch every bug going, on a loop, forever.

if you're lucky you will have supportive managers, but they're usually burnt out or under the government cosh.
