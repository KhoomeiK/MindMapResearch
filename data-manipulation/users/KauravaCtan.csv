Planets 10% and pops 1% each increase tech cost so if you want to fix your tech problems try to only grab 3~5 planets for the 1st 100 years with atleast 3 being 95% research.

Encourage free thinking edict is alot better then most think its 5% of your final numbers, so it can even affect your space resources.

Fanatic materialist gives the same 10% and gives a easy faction to work with to get easy happiness and influence.

Egalitarian does the same AND offers a 20%+ to all pops happiness with utopian living standard, easily countered with traits for lower consumer cost.

Happiness is the single most important stat for bonuses! At max happyness the freen bar full you get a flat 20% bonus to ALL gathered by that pop so food minaral tech.
Max happyness effected by habbility.

With pops taking minerals as ""consumer goods"" every pop grown is a negative to minerals so every 3 months minimum be building something that gives it.

Building a planet for one type of resource is better then splitting it up because theres building that give %multipliers to the planet.

Dont forget to go discovery first and first unity perk the 10% research speed.
Sci ships can assist planets too for more happiness and more research points.
