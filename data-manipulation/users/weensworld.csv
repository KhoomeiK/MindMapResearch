atheism,fgktzyv,t1_fgks6sf,1580873568.0,He said “by the pussy”! Why would anyone want to downplay his actual words?
aww,fgksgmc,t1_fgkqz50,1580872598.0,"He’s so cute. I had a few birds growing up, but my family was such white trash that we didn’t raise them well. (That’s a different story).

When I was a teenager, I started visiting this bird daycare/breeding place. All bigger parrots like cockatoos and hyacinths and other macaws. I would spend hours just getting to know them and learning how they loved to be scratched under their wings or on their heads. These blue hyacinth twins would strut over and (at knee level) demand to be be picked up. I would always oblige, and they were not easy to coerce back to a perch. 

In college, I lived with my cousins who had two African Greys. One was a complete asshole, the other was a little flirt. 

I want birds again. (And bats and llamas and pigs and dogs and my three cats and rats and llamas and parrots). 

Reality is that at some point I’ll get a bird or two and a dog and that will be enough. 

I love your conure. They’re super sweet little birbs."
Teachers,fgkqdul,t1_fgknpll,1580871294.0,"I moved here from San Diego 10 years ago. I was a die-hard Chargers fan, but learned to love KC because of their love of the town and their sports teams. Mahomes clinched the deal for me; actually the fans did. I love being a part of this celebration. 

Chargers in LA is a disgrace, and I’ve never liked Rivers, so the past couple years has me feeling like a kid in love with football again. (I’m a 50-year-old woman, for reference). 
 
The general feeling here right now is palpable EVERYWHERE, from classrooms to grocery stores to households and eateries. 

I’m sorry you can’t join us for the fun, but I hope you feel it!!"

I am so damn sorry this is your reality. I’m sick for you. I’m a teacher and a single mother who had to get full custody of my daughters for their safety. 

She sounds like the kind of “parent” (for lack of a different term) who would not be able (or willing) to fight. 

Do it, dad. You are the only one your kid deserves."
