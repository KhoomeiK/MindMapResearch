Ah yes, **Hypothetical Nudity Guy!** He gets around. This is what passes for his hobby. He trolls various subreddits (you recently posted to MakeNewFriendsHere) looking for pretty young women to send PMs to, typically with insults right off the bat. He likes to make fun of their weight, their perceived race and religion, their country of origin, and anything else he hopes will stick. He has an odd obsession with how frequently people shower, too.

But what he's known for is exactly what's in your screenshot: he will always ask a hypothetical question about male nudity in some way or other. It doesn't matter what you answer (or if you ignore him), he will explode into more angry raging rants no matter what.

I do not recommend engaging with him, as he will not stop and has become stalkerish and obsessive with at least one redditor.

All I need to do is alter which communities the OP recently posted in, post the comment, and then add the new link at the bottom of the list. It's not like I dedicate much time and energy into this, I just started a list of links to the various posts one day when I noticed the similarities."
creepyPMs,fektvbr,t1_fekhwhp,1579207493.0,"Yes, and he has been banned several times already. Not sure why they haven't managed to permanently get rid of him tho."
creepyPMs,fektgmg,t1_fekgcd6,1579207253.0,That's why I suspect he's mentally ill and has some kind of hang-up with this whole nudity issue. I'm no expert but I wonder if the problem is he *can't* stop.

I'm not a mod of any of these places, I just leave comments here on CreepyPMs because I've been subbed to this community for years now and I wanted to let the victims know they aren't alone (and that they can dismiss everything he said since it's clearly not personal; he says the same things to everyone).

creepyPMs,fejn2zh,t1_fejilak,1579180418.0,"Oh, he's been banned many times, but he just makes a new account and carries on.
