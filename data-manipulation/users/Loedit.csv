selfimprovement,fd3fp4s,t3_ejwdlc,1578157840.0,"Thank you so much for this reminder, I too grew up without my Dad around and never really had anyone throwing any expectations at me.  I've always felt like I hadn't achieved enough and even when I had climbed one mountain, I immediately saw the next peak in the distance without really giving myself credit for what I had already accomplished.  I just put this book on my kindle and I'll jump in today.  Wish you well on your journey my friend, keep on truckin'."
