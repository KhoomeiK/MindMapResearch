Semenretention,fgxlhim,t1_fgxhgi5,1581174010.0,Maybe having access to some specific anti porn literature will help keep me in check. I’ll have a look later on. Cheers
Semenretention,fgxgt07,t1_fgxeidm,1581172669.0,"But why? This is my question. 

I know it’s bad but it doesn’t seem to affect SR."
PurplePillDebate,fgwvyfz,t1_fgwlep8,1581166291.0,"> My husband would be extremely bothered by what you said

...ok?

No guy would give a fuck about his girl getting better looks if they’re already happy with them. The more woke ones know that plastic surgery is a recipe for disaster. Most men would be happy with a femcel level of gf, but those femcels don’t want those men, they want the ones that don’t want them, because that’s how women recognise value. As you probably know. 

Some women don’t bother fighting and just resign to enjoying what they have available to them, like you. I know women like you, you’re chill and fun enough. I would have settled for someone like you, but post awakening, I realise there is no point. Nothing’s guaranteed and hypergamy is always lurking around the corner. So why bother.

Glad you’re happy, I truly am tbh. Nice to see a girl who has lowered their expectations enough they can enjoy life and their partner can enjoy them. That’s the key to happiness and something I try to employ in my life in many aspects. Hypergamy is the opposite of that and why being with most women is a drag."
PurplePillDebate,fgwf9m0,t1_fgwbgki,1581160492.0,They’re women. They follow hypergamy. By the mere fact that they call themselves ‘femcels’ proves that they don’t care for the droves of men available to them. So my statement about jumping ship once they get their plastic surgery from mr BB couldn’t be truer for any woman than it is for femcels.
asktrp,fgucljj,t1_fgub5s4,1581117550.0,What do these words mean. Do you have advice? Did you read the other comment. Sounds like you’re here for an ego boost. No one has provided anything of value.
asktrp,fgu8tep,t1_fgtcwcl,1581115077.0,"I just wrote another reply explaining this. 

If this was true I wouldn’t have asked the question."
asktrp,fgu8hza,t1_fgu0lks,1581114901.0,"I was assigned this girl by my boss. The girl was a cunt. There is no instruction manual for the job, our account or our practices. It has to be taught in real life scenarios based on how the particular market assigned to her and that she is passing to me, functions. No one else could have taught me. I asked others, they didn’t have the time nor the reason to teach me. They couldn’t teach me my market because it wasn’t their market, it was the dickhead girls. I complained to both different managers I had at the time every week at our weekly one to ones. 

My first manager was a temp and didn’t give a fuck. My second manager didn’t take me seriously because the girl had a good girl image and my boss couldn’t understand why the girl wouldn’t be teaching me and palmed me off. I considered quitting the entire time because I was not being supported. 

By the time of my probation knowledge exam, I failed miserably, because I knew nothing. My manager, now her responsibility to get me up to speed, transferred me to a girl who used to own that market, that girls superior, and that girl was chill, professional and approachable. She taught me loads and I really enjoyed learning from her. Unfortunately she could not teach me 3 months of ideas in 1 and by the end of my extension, I was still not knowledgeable enough. I simply hadn’t experienced enough real life scenarios that the account could encounter in 3 months, in 1 month. 

There is more to the story than the one line in the OP, but no one is going to read all that. I’m assuming they can give me the benefit of the doubt and answer the actual question at play. But the people I’ve argued with have said useless generic platitudes and said them with an attitude, and expect me to be grateful for their poor choice of words. 

Yes I’m eager and ready to kill it in a new job. 

It doesn’t matter bro. I hate asktrp because these are the responses I always get. No one can assume the best and answer the question with anything meaningful. They just want a quick ego boost to shit on someone who’s being vulnerable for a second and asking for help. Probably sounds like I’m not taking responsibility here but I don’t give a fuck and there’s no empathetic response to prove me wrong."

Already addressed. Why are you bringing it up again?

asktrp,fgt0u9r,t1_fgt0ht6,1581096692.0,What is the attitude problem exactly? This is not the story i am telling in interviews. I am saying i worked for 6 months and had a redundancy due to our director leaving.

asktrp,fgsq383,t1_fgspjkt,1581090231.0,Teaching myself what? There’s only real work experience to be gained at this point. Theory only takes me 1 step of the way but without any real data or actual tasks to complete there’s nothing major to learn.
asktrp,fgsm30l,t1_fgsj8u4,1581087670.0,I told my manager about her but she didn’t take me seriously. After I failed probation she took it seriously and transferred me to a different girl who taught me everything the other hadn’t but a month later I still was still behind and they can’t extent probation any longer so I got let go.

memegender,fgqk7qa,t1_fgqj2qe,1581025781.0,True but a point for a different conversation.
memegender,fgqe7hu,t3_ezyl1k,1581022470.0,"Please never post about femcels again. We leave the arena of meme gender into one where women post meta shit about being a meme gender and co opt the words and descriptors of a male subculture because they have no creativity or imagination. 

Women want attention and talk shit endlessly, that’s what this sub is about. But ‘femcels’ is a concept born to literally catch the attention of people who read this shit. And guess what, it’ll drive you insane because they can just say any stupid shit and you’ll post it and even kill yourselves over it while they go get railed by their third chad of the week and forget about posting anything. 

Forget the concept of ‘femcel’ forever. It’s the most transparent bait that has been posted on here.

Oh i dreamed for hear him tell me for once, I was right, but father was too discerning for his own good.
