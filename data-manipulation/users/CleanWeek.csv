college,ffpr9ms,t1_ffpg26f,1580102889.0,"A large portion of the responsibility lies in how the professor sets up the groups.  

I only had one course last semester where I had group projects, but they went smoothly for the most part. The biggest factor was that the professor set up the paper into multiple sections (history, recent developments, etc).  Each person was assigned to a portion of the paper.  If they didn't pull their weight, you could email the professor and let him know. He would boot the student from the group and they would get no credit for the assignment. I had to do that with one person, who later withdrew from the class. If we'd had to write his part of the paper (on short notice), it would've been a shit-show.

This semester, I am taking an online course and 20% of my grade relies on people I've never seen or met doing a presentation that I will respond to on blackboard. If they don't submit their presentation, I automatically get a 50% on that assignment. I can see it being a disaster."

MurderedByWords,ffnoiuh,t1_ffnclk8,1580068578.0,"The worst part is it cascades. 

Say you need 10 employees to be fully staffed. 3 are long-timers who stick around because they don't need more money and are comfortable. The other 7 positions are constantly in a state of training as they turn over. 

So you've got 3 people training 7 people on top of their own jobs. Neither one is doing the job a fully trained person could do. 

The trainer is stressed because they're doing much more work than they should have to. It affects their managers, also, who will need to provide more supervision instead of getting their own work done.

The company ends up paying more in total payroll/overtime because you need at least 1 trainer for every shift and the trainees can't hold a shift on their own.  

So everybody's miserable and the company probably breaks even at the end of the day. It's quintessential ""penny wise and pound foolish"" mentality."

If it won't benefit you, then it is perfectly reasonable to not go to university and teach yourself as a hobbyist. Getting a useless degree AND cheating is just double insanity.

If the degree will benefit you, then you have the two options I listed in my previous post:

1) Do it honestly. Pay tuition. Spend the normal amount of time in school. If you have spare time, you can teach yourself other things in the desired field (or jump ahead, like I do).

2) Cheat. Pay tuition and for this cheating service. Spend (likely more) time teaching yourself. Do poorly on exams since you aren't following the curriculum, costing yourself even more time if you fail a class. Hope you don't get expelled for academic dishonesty (I doubt most essay writers care too much about plagiarism)."

That quote from Good Will Hunting is right. You could get (mostly) the same education from a few dollars in library late fees.  But you would still have to put in a lot of work to do so (and maybe fumble around a bit since you're not being guided), so there's no benefit to doing this.

Cheat to get the degree + Learn on your own = $Tuition + $Cheating cost + time

That's not even talking about the password policies themselves.  One must be 8 characters exactly but they don't spell out any of the other requirements. You can't see why the password is failing until you submit it. After 3 failed attempts to set a new password (even if the old one is fine), you get locked out.
