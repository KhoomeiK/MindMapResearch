You want proof the people arrested are a part of something sinister? Several articles make no mention of their identity. You can bet your last dollar if those individuals had been found to be right leaning in any way, they would have been exposed in the press globally. But given the media's current penchant for giving us a single perspective only, we hear nothing.

Your question would be valid if there were no such thing as any non-white individuals enjoying success in their lives, but they do. All you know is the lie after lie after lie you have been told, probably since you were young in school. In this day and age, NOBODY has any excuse. NOBODY is prevented from achieving whatever they want. NOBODY is out to stop ANYONE from success. NOBODY. You either have what it takes to succeed, regardless of what your skin looks like or what's between your legs, or you don't. It's SO easy to sit and say ""It's someone else's fault I am unhappy"". It's like a Get Out of Jail Free card!!! Take responsibility for yourself. Take responsibility for your own actions. Stop looking to others to make the world a better place while you sit an wear your thumbs out on your phone. YOU take action if you want a better life. YOU take action if you don't like homelessness. And what I mean by that is YOU make the physical, mental effort and spend YOUR time and energy to make things happen. Because the real reason why not everyone is falling for your whining and excuses is because they KNOW it's nothing more than a copout on your part."
