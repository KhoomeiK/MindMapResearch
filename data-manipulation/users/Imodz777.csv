depression,fewm7le,t3_eqsh1t,1579414375.0,You need new friends. You have to be VERY selective with people. Friends can be relative as well. You need to find good people. Anyways work on yourself. This all has to stem from somewhere. So what cause the downwards spiral? What can you do to change the outcome?
depression,fewm422,t3_eqsism,1579414271.0,Then stop eating to drown the pain. Stop the cycle. Change it! You are only hurting YOU.  ugly or not can be relative. If you are ugly what? You cant control that right? But you CAN control the way you eat and what you eat. Eat less. Eat healthier. Exercise once In a while until you burn your fat. Pick yourself up please. Stop feeling sorry for your self and trade that for being PROUD of yourself. Love yourself. There's gotta be people who love you. So show them their love and support makes a difference.
depression,fewlvxd,t3_eqsivb,1579414034.0,Depression is a state of mind. People can have it for years but the reality is it stems from somewhere. You can't control everything. I know that. But what can you control to change? To better for you and everyone else? What situation and abuse let to this? Are there other things pilled on as well?
depression,fewlp03,t3_eqsjck,1579413835.0,"Dude. I'm going to be honest. This is a cycle. Look at it from the outside. Who is going to want to be with someone who is depressed and wants to commit suicide? Why would anyone get involved and start to care about you? It would only hurt them. You have to focus on solely yourself. Forget about ""love"" lol and everything else and just work on yourself. Don't feel like a man? Find some work in manual labor. Guaranteed after a few weeks going from barely even being able to lift something or make something out of nothing you'll feel great.  Hit the gym. Find things that make you happy. The happier YOU are the happier the people are around you. Then people will look at you in a while different light. You are welcome :)"
