I once got us meet and greet passes for our favourite band, so I decided to surprise her with a ticket for the concert too. We were ecstatic!  I arrived early at the venue and kept trying to contact her. When she finally picked up and said they were just outside, in the parking lot, and Eric didn‚Äôt feel like going in yet. I reminded her we had to be at a certain door as soon as the gig finished and she said, ‚Äòyeah thanks, I‚Äôll be there‚Äô.
I never saw her. Her phone was switched off. I waited by the stage door for as long as possible and she never came. I went in and had the time of my life. About an hour later we bumped into each other at a restaurant. I asked what had happened and if she was ok. She adoringly looked at the boyfriend and said ‚Äòoh I‚Äôm great! Eric just didn‚Äôt feel like putting up with that music, so we went for a beer instead‚Äô. I was disappointed that everything I had done got wasted. When she saw I was carrying a signed vinyl record she exploded at me and said I was a terrible friend for not getting her one too. I tried to explain the band gifted it to me and I couldn‚Äôt simply ask for another one for a fan who wasn‚Äôt even in the building. She was furious and called me all sorts of names and suddenly it was my fault she had missed out on this life dream of hers. She left comments on my social media photos of the event calling me selfish for not ‚Äòtaking her with me‚Äô.
That was that.

12 years later she contacted me asking for immigration advice as she also fancied moving to the country I now live in.

I feel no need or want to even reply to her."

We got there and the lady let us in and told us to look at the things on the dining table, everything on it going for about 1 dollar a piece... a SEGA Saturn with a bunch of CDs and a Game Boy Color...all sorts of games and toys, some art supplies too. She winced and said the bike out on the terrace was $5 even though it looked brand new. My friend and I looked at each other like we had won the lottery and just took as much as we could (he took the bike, too). We were about to thank her and leave when her son came downstairs and said 'I'll miss my videogames, please look after them'. He had a massive bandage covering the stub that was his forearm. 

As the lady walked us to the gate she told us to spread the word with other kids, all these things had to go ASAP, as her son just got upset seeing them around the house. Also, you must tell all your friends to never play with fireworks, or they might have to sell their Game Boys and bikes, too."
