quityourbullshit,ffqd2eq,t1_ffq8iam,1580130857.0,"The real reason for the American civil war was that the south didn't want the federal government to have the power to over then state laws. For example, if a state voted to legalize murder in all forms the federal government can step in and say ""you can't do that"". The South was saying that if the citizens of a state voted for a law, then that law should be respected by the federal government, even if it directly contradicted a federal law. But they still wanted the federal government to protect them from foreign attack, and some other fun aspects of running a country. The North was saying that they were part of the Union and therefore could not overturn federal laws. Slavery was just the ""loudest"" example of that, and the issue that got put in the history books. The Civil War, A Film by Ken Burns is a good introduction into the nuances of the civil war (available on Netflix). I say ""introduction"" because it was made by an American who interviewed other Americans, with all our lovely little biases about the history of our country. It is 9 episodes that are over an hour each, so its a comprehensive look at how American historians understood the civil war in the lat 80's early 90's"
quityourbullshit,ffqcdxi,t1_ffqa8wq,1580130187.0,"Well, I think Haiti relied on slavery more. A much smaller portion of the population were not slaves, which is part of why the revolts were so successful: a much larger percentage of the population was rebelling. 

By the time the discussion was finally gaining traction the cotton gin had been invented (I can't remember exactly when). So no matter how much the U.S. was relying on slavery, it was quickly becoming not economically sound. I personally think the main reason the plantation owners resisted was simply a strong streak of ""I'm wealthy so you can't tell me what to do"". If you have Netflix the Ken Burns docuseries (The Civil War, A Film by Ken Burns) is a good introduction into the whole topic. He covers the lead up, and a little bit of the aftermath of the war. Forewarning, it is 9 episodes and each is more than an hour. For me history makes more sense when in context, and the end of slavery is tied up with the civil war no matter how you look at it, hence my recommendation to start with a civil war documentary series. (Plus I love history and will happily binge documentaries on Netflix, yes I know I'm the weird one).

Anyway, I used to think there were ""obvious"" reasons when I got depressed, and in the Navy there certainly are plenty of those. But it turned out I have what is now called Mild Depressive Disorder. I get mildly depressed, at random time throughout the year. Life situations can make it worse, but even when everything is good it can still happen (as you phrased it, breaking down for no reason). Anti depressants can help when it hits you hard like this, or if it lasts a long time. But in the long run you need to find a good therapist who can help you learn techniques to manage/mitigate the symptoms. Meds just do not work for Mild Depressive Disorder like they do for Major Depressive Disorder. Some people only need a few sessions of therapy to learn what works for them. If there isn't a bunch of other shit piling on in my life, then recognizing the disordered thinking is enough for me.

Therapy is good because you may be struggling with something else. I'm not a mental health professional, and even if I were all I have to go on is this post. It's just that what you describe is exactly how I feel when depression hits me hard, including not wanting to let others know (I call it the ""stop looking at me"" effect), and you described the cycling that I get. I mentioned only the therapy because plenty if others have covered the other options.

unpopularopinion,ffc3b3v,t1_ffc0twg,1579790490.0,"The practicalities aren't the hard part. The difficulties would be how much does it cost, should it cost anything, what sort of qualifications should the training facilities have, do the trainers need to have masters degrees or just experience, should the cost of the license for the animals be part of the cost of the dog (which would mean that it would cost nothing if provided through non-profits), should the license always be provided separately like it is for driving motor vehicles. This is a service that is exclusively provided for disabled people, through the ADA things like that are understood to need different rules so that they are actually accessible for the disabled. For instance there are dozens of non-profits to provide properly trained service animals at no cost to the people who need them. So that brings up an entire sub-section of questions about who should be providing these licenses/certifications, and about the cost. You have to realize that if you're gonna create a standard set of qualifications for a service animal, then that means that facilities must then match other requirements about how to train the animals. And of course another layer of complication: how do you create a uniform set of qualifications when what is needed from the animals is so diverse, just the physical tasks are incredibly diverse, and psychiatric tasks are diverse amongst themselves and from the physical tasks. What the license looks like, or where to display it (if it should be displayed at all or kept readily available like a government I.D.) those are not difficult at all compared to the rest of it."

On those nights their father would sit in the front room with a shotgun and watch the front door until dawn. They also *never* called them ""the KKK"" or even ""the Klan"", the sisters would only call them ""the night riders"".

On the other side of the hill, in another hollow, was a house that had been built around an old cottage (the cottage was then like the ""back room"" of the house). Embedded in the outside wall, and around the window frame (a little more than a foot tall and wide) are bullets, there was only one bullet on the inside wall. Except for the one on the inside, the rest were painted over. I know this because my parents almost bought that house, they heard the story from the grandson, and I heard it from them. The guy's grandfather and some others defended the cottage from the KKK.

None of those people were black. I don't think any of them ever even sheltered black people. All they did was not ""respect"" the KKK. I think the sisters' father and the grandfather might have hired black men to work on their farms, but I don't know for sure. I know that the sisters didn't think that there was any reason to treat black people differently, even though they were born in TN around 1900-1930's. I never met the family of those who defended the cottage. So I don't know about them. It was a weird area, the people there worked too damned hard to be racist. If you could pull your weight in one way or another, and you believed in God (it didn't even matter which denomination), then they didn't give a shit what you looked like, or how you raised your family (as in your culture). That attitude was starting to fade when I was growing up, because the area was finally catching up with modern times. It's weird to think that where I grew up was more racist when I left than when my family first moved there."

But heternormativity is talking about how it is considered ""normal"" to be heterosexual, it is not a catch all term that can be applied to kink or race or relationship styles. With so many people using that term to talk about monogocentric culture, its no wonder why so many people think that nonmonogamy is just a sexuality or a kink, instead if seeing it as a different relationship style.

But maybe you've just never heard ""monogocentric"" or seen it used before. It is the proper way to talk about how monogamy is the cultural ""norm""/how nonmonogamy is not widely considered socially acceptable. Then there's also ""toxic monogamy"" which is basically the idea that if you're in a relationship and have friends of the opposite sex then you're looking for opportunities to cheat, or if you have a separate checking account then you're just waiting for the relationship to end. I can't think of better examples, and a lot of it does come down to being abusive, but it is peddled as the ""proper way"" to be monogamous in some places."

And I think that in a lot of ways it only changed because of birth control. I think birth control is older than that, but in the late 50s you had young women who had come of age with birth control being a thing. They were taught about flirting by their mothers and older sisters, and were taught that they couldn't mess around because it meant babies and that they wouldn't be able to provide for themselves (it was still frowned upon for a woman to work and she wouldn't have been able to make as much money). But they also hit puberty in a world where messing around didn't have to mean babies because of birth control. So my theory is that with the sexual liberation comes changes in the way flirting works. The hippies decided that women could say ""yes"" therefore ""no"" actually does means ""no""."

conspiracy,fei75gl,t1_fei5h7l,1579131783.0,"I think you missed a part of the lesson. So let's go over it again. 

Just because a light was working the *last time* you saw it, doesn't mean that it is *still* working. You can check a light, leave that area, and then the light burns out. Without you ever knowing that it burned out.

Here, let's use a real world example, maybe that will help. I once turned my car on where I could see it reflected in some windows. This happened at dusk, in a well lit part of town. Both headlights were working just fine. 10 minutes later I got pulled over for having a burned out headlight. That light was working just fine when I checked it last. But when the officer saw it, the light was no longer functioning."
conspiracy,fei6jwd,t3_ep5jwa,1579131397.0,"Proper training is needed in:
- use of deadly force to include the proper scale of escalation as is taught in the military. Service members are taught to start by giving verbal orders, to only use force if those orders have been ignored, and to start with non deadly force if at all possible
- how to properly handle a firearm. I've seen videos of officers aiming their sidearms at suspects that a fellow officer is wrestling with or putting cuffs on. I've seen videos of officers having to leap out of the way to avoid being shot in this type of situation because their partner fired into melee.
- marksmanship. If their aim is so fucking bad that they're constantly hitting people ""by accident"" then they should all have to qualify as expert by military standards before being allowed to carry firearms. I say military standards, because obviously their standards aren't good enough.
- de-escalation tactics. We've all seen videos of officers from other countries talk down suspects when American cops would use a hail of bullets. I seriously doubt this all due to ""cultural"" differences. 

There should be actual accountability. This case is a pretty good example, but also if a cop does something that gets them fired from one department that information should go on an easily accessible, permanent record that pops up if they try to get hired at a new department. You know, something like that ""background check"". Another thing is that officers should be taught to humanize their suspects, not demonize them. Their job is to protect the citizens, write tickets or issue warnings for miner infractions, and arrest people. They are not meant to be judge and jury. Yes, they have to make judgement calls about what qualifies as dangerous behaviour when trying to protect the public. But they should be judging the *actions* not the *person*. 

I actually think that most cops are decent people. Something about the way they are trained has created these problems, so that system needs to be changed. Until that system is changed, it won't matter how many ""good cops"" there are, or just how ""good"" they even are. Even if that officer's story is 100% fact, his training meant that he was unqualified to make that shot, meant that the officers present did not work as a team to control the situation, meant that none of those officers knew how to de-escalate a situation, meant that none of them knew about escalation of deadly force"

You've obviously not heard that if you leave a light turned on, and then move to where you can't see it, that the light stays on. So I'll explain that too. But I promise you, just because you've stopped looking it doesn't mean that it turned off all by itself. This means that the thin filament that glows to make the light, still has electricity passing through it. These filaments eventually break from this. When these filaments break, the light bulb stops working.

Veterans,feezhfq,t3_eoojdx,1579044644.0,"You really don't understand how PTSD works, even by the VA's standards which are outdated. Hyper vigilance doesn't turn on and off, it's always there. This means that a portion of the brain is constantly devoted to assessing the surrounding area for threats, escape routes, and considering possible aggressive actions by those around and how to handle said actions. Which means that there's less brain power to handle otherwise mildly stressful situations. That's where the sudden bursts of anger over seemingly nothing come from. The person with PTSD has a dampened ability to handle normal stress. So for you waiting a long time on hold is mildly frustrating, but your brain isn't busy being hyper vigilant so you can process that mild stress normally. Someone with PTSD, however, is hyper vigilant and they're already stressed out from it, so they cannot process that mild stress normally. With PTSD the stress hormones do not go down to a normal level, their body is always under a lot of stress even when nothing stressful has happened on a given day. Think of it like this, you've had the most stressful day of your life, literally everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. You finally make it home and you just want to microwave some food and be done with the day, but one of the buttons has stopped working on your microwave. Normally you'd be able to work around this problem by using the other functions, and it would produce little to no stress response. However, your body has been primed to fight all day thanks to your stress response system having been repeatedly activated. Those stress hormones haven't had a chance to normalize. So you get irrationally angry, and yell at the microwave. Of course the other common responses are flight or freeze, in which case you might wind up eating cold food or simply skipping the meal all together. That's what it's like for someone with PTSD, we're always primed for life threatening danger because of elevated stress hormones.

Another thing that happens with PTSD is thinking about those stressful and traumatic events. We don't like to think about it, and many of us do a lot of mental gymnastics to avoid thinking about it. But being on hold for a long time leaves us sitting there with our thoughts. Yes, we could do something else to distract us while waiting on hold. But again, consider that a portion of our brain power is dedicated to hyper vigilance. Obvious shit like that doesn't always occur to someone with PTSD, then add in that many veterans have TBI and it makes it even less likely that we'll see the obvious solution. Plus, if we're somewhere public it's a little hard to do other things while on hold. At least other things that will actually keep us distracted.

Finally PTSD is classified as an anxiety disorder for a fucking reason. It causes anxiety. Anxiety makes it hard to function normally. Phone anxiety is a real thing that causes thousands, if not millions, of people to drive somewhere just to avoid talking on the phone. Maybe a veteran's anxiety due to PTSD has manifested itself in the form of phone anxiety. Maybe it manifested in the form of anxiety about waiting. Maybe it manifested in the form of anxiety about talking to someone they can't see.

The point is that you never have the full story. You don't know why they're acting the way they're acting. But if you really want to help people, you should be considerate. Part of being considerate is understanding that there is a reason for the behaviour, even if you don't know what that reason is. Even if the behaviour seems strange to you, there's a fucking reason for it."
