Accounting,ff3tjzq,t3_eri1s6,1579548543.0,"See if your school has Lynda or other course learning websites offered through your school portal. You‚Äôll most likely be able to find an Excel learning course through there. If your school doesn‚Äôt have it, check out your city‚Äôs/county‚Äôs public library (LA County, in my case, offers access to Lynda with a library card). Good luck!"

Everything is only $1.50 (excluding those marked otherwise), so depending on how you look at it, it could be a bang for your buck. If you‚Äôd like, I can send you pics of tapes and stickers I got from Daiso as an example :)"
