memes,ffhi6nf,t1_ffh3717,1579936351.0,"First, check if the eggs have gone bad by putting them in water. If they float, they're bad.

If you are cooking these eggs on a stovetop, then set the stove to high heat at this time. If cooking them in a microwave, don't.

Then, crack two eggs, one at a time, into a small or medium bowl. Remove the shell from the bowl if any pieces fall in.

Scramble them thoroughly. I recommend using a fork to do so because it means less dishes later, but a whisk is acceptable. If using the fork, keep the tines nearly parallel to the flat of the bowl, and make circles perpendicular to the same bowl, so that it's like a very fast ferris wheel. If you see any clear parts floating, they will be white and bland later. If there's any doubt about if you should keep scrambling, then keep scrambling.

If you're cooking this in the microwave, this is the time to add any salt, pepper, cheese, onion, or mostly cooked bacon. Or anything else, except ketchup, which goes on last. Just put them in the bowl and heat for a minute, take them out, flip them, and heat them for however much longer you think they need. Then serve.

If you're cooking this on the stove, then grease the pan  and pour the eggs in. If it doesn't give some massive sizzling, you did it wrong. You can't really have a stove that's too hot, as long as you can collect the eggs fast enough Wait five seconds, then add your condiments. They should cook quickly. Your spatula should almost always be moving to collect the partially, and then fully, solidified eggs. If the eggs look slightly pale at places, and start to bubble, then collect that group of eggs to one part of the pan and flip them. It's ok if they break up. Wait about ten seconds, usually filled with collecting other eggs to do this, and then check the eggs. If they look a vivid yellow that's just barely shiny, then take them out immediately. If you have bacon in the eggs, and especially if you're cooking in the bacon grease, a lot of the egg will be darker, and taste greasier. In that case, those spots should be about 75% ish of the egg and have a little bit of a sheen when you take it out. You can pat them down with a paper towel to remove the grease if you want, but most people don't. 

Serve, add ketchup if you want, and enjoy!

Please tell me how you do with this if you take my advice! :)"

Please note that the ones who like pineapple on pizza are a more peaceful and welcoming society than the ones who do not, making them less of a social burden if anything.

Additionally, pineapple on pizza drastically helps the pizza industry by keeping people's options open so that they are more likely to actually make a purchase and support the economy and society.

One of the only things making our existence shitty is the hate that inflexible people like you spew, if we choose to be irritated by it.

Indeed, we may mean little, but that is only because we are only going to live for an infinitely small period of time or space in the vast expanse of the universe. But by the same logic, you mean just as little. 

No thanks, I don't feel like going for a swim today, but thanks for the offer.
