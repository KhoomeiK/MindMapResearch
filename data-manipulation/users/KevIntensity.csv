I think you missed the definition of “relevant” somewhere when you were typing your comment. None of those people has *anything* to do with whether POTUS held up aid that was already approved by Congress (I’d entertain an argument re: the whistle blower, but that person shouldn’t be put at risk for doing the right thing— I’m not willing to see him/her threatened or worse by crazed Trump supporters), or whether he then obstructed any investigation into him holding up said aid.

The people you listed are people that POTUS and the GOP are trying to blame for all of POTUS’s own actions. If you can give me any offer of proof as to how they’re relevant, then we can talk. And I’m operating on the legal definition of relevance, which would be paraphrased as “any thing that makes a *material fact* more or less likely.”"

But that’s just it. When you were growing up, loot boxes (and really, all built-in micro transaction mechanics in games) weren’t a thing. You *couldn’t* use your parents’ money in the same way. And all it takes is a parent agreeing to one micro transaction and the payment details don’t need to be entered again. The entire mechanic is based on ease of spending.

Your parents could leave you to your NES/Super NES/N64 etc. and you wouldn’t have been able to spend the amount of money that kids can now.

One particular example of government overreach and surveillance is not the same as another. I don’t know how to make this any simpler for you — your example isn’t a backdoor.
