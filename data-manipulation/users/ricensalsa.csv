Thats usually the guy who has seen some shit, the guy who has been through the hard times, as well as some good times. Hes the guy who probably has a big family whom various members have dealt with all kinds of issues, this is also usually the guy who swears like a trucker and has kind of a rough shell.

Plus id like the ability to work from home sometimes, because right now working 44hrs a week, im leaving before my son and fiance wake up, and i get home around suppertime, so i dont get to spend anywhere near the time with them that i would like to.

First one was the day i got my license, i had to wait an extra year to get it for..reasons, and i was a mechanic too/car guy so it was a long time coming. Second, the day my son was born. My whole life changed instantly. 3rd, the day i asked my fiance to marry me, and she said yes. It was during a heavy snowfall in a gazeebo (spelling) in the middle of a park nearby. 4th, the day we moved into our house. We dont own it, but my inlaws do, and theyre leniant on payment dates so it was a HUGE stress relief"

Ive seen alot of ""its never too late to go back to school"" type posts,  and after trying a lot of different labour / mechanical / trades jobs, I'm kind of inspired to go back. Im thinking I would like to get a degree in mechanical engineering, even though im 28, and swimming in debt. If i can do this, while supporting my son and fiance (she will be working again soon too) then I know Ill be able to provide a better life for them, and get out of this trailer we live in. Heres to making all 3 of our lives better. Thanks for the inspiration, and attitude adjustment, reddit! Some truly inspiring and positive people on here!"
GetMotivated,ff4ozvi,t1_ff296c6,1579568965.0,"Thank you for the great info! Im in Canada, in a smaller city on the east coast. New Brunswick specifically. I worked with a student this summer, who is actually now working with the coast guard, as a mechanical engineer (apprentice i believe). We talked alot about it this summer, and realized we see alot of things the same way. We needed to learn how things worked, everything actually. All the equipment we used, how the area we worked was setup and why, etc. He told our boss that he thought I would do great in that career path as well whih was very pleasant to hear later, My issue is the nearest school offering this is about 1.5hrs from me, and i have a house where I am now, as well as a son and (soon to be) wife, whom Im currently supporting both of. Thats the part that would make it tough for me to get there, as I couldn't be away from them very long, and financially, it would likely screw us. I wonder if there is a way I could do alot of it online? Something to look into i suppose. Thanks again, i know im kind of ranting, i sometimes do my best thinking through text. Ive been reading a lot of ""its never too late"" articles, im hoping it inspires me to find something i truly love to do"
AskReddit,ff4oe5p,t1_ff20uel,1579568538.0,"I'd like to say that it does take its toll on the kids involved as well, as youve probably noticed somewhat during your moms vacation. I mean though i do have anxiety and depression, i wouldnt say that i would blame them on my parents divorce, and how they hated each other for a while even though dad helped mom still for our sake. But I would think that it definitely didnt help the situation. Its hard to tell as to what effect it did have on my own mental issues, as they didnt really arise until later on in life when things were more, calm. Being the older sibling, i did have to relay some messages between them during those harder times. They weren't always nice messages, and they were usually written on paper, i opened a few, being nosey, and read them and it was definitely not PG rated stuff. Probably things a kid shouldn't know about. That stuff they probably should have done themselves. I will give them credit, as they made a PILE of sacrifices for my sister and I, but there are things they definitely could have done differently. 

I will say this though. My son was around 1.5 years old when his mother and I split up. (She was doing some things behind my back) What I learned from my parents divorce has 100% taught me how to handle it all in a mature way. Sure there were times i wanted to blow up and tell her off, but I didnt, because one way or another, it would likely affect my son. Whether immediate, or later. The things I learned also taught me some things to watch for, and eventually led to me having sole custody of my son, which I am thankful for. Not only for his well being, but my own sanity as well. I am since engaged to someone who I know has great motherly qualities, and treats him as her own son. And he, on his own, sometimes calls her mom as well. (His bio mom has chosen not to be involved, since he was 2. Hes almost 5 now) I have a great connection with both my son and fiance, and my son is very open about his feelings about her as well. I would like to think that my own experiences as a kid, has led to me being a better father too. So can say that my childhood has also led to some great things for later, because I can understand some of the things my son says or asks me about.

Sorry that is kind of a jumbled mess, its hard to put all this stuff in order. I hope you can get what im trying to say here. I guess theres a silver lining to some of the crap ive been through as a kid, I just didnt realize a lot of it until my son was born."
AskReddit,ff1v9wc,t3_er5yih,1579486958.0,"The loaded shotgun i found under the floorboards of the attic in moms garage, that wasnt there last time i looked about a week prior. I was 12, and nobody has guns there, theres nothing to hunt except duck sometimes, and nobody i knew hunted. It was during a really bad time in my childhood, we were poor/broke, mom was about to lose the house she loved, and was laid off from work. She was crying every night in her room. I told her what i found, and she instantly called my dad, who NEVER came on the property except to the front door to pick us up, and tried to blame him for it. Looking back, had I not found it, we all might not be here right now."
AskReddit,ff1usst,t3_er5yme,1579486662.0,"I apologize for formatting, now this may not be the same thing, as I did have two parents, they just seperated when i was 10ish. My sister was 5, so she doesnt remember as much of it, but they lived in different ""homes"" and i got to see some of each. For mom, it was trying to keep a larger home afloat from before the seperation, on one income, as well as feed us, and pay half of babysitting costs. I remember going to the pawnshop with whatever we had, but the one that bothered me the most was her wedding ring, to get oil to heat our house, and trying to make that last. She would boil water in big pots on the stove for hours to dump in the bathtub upstairs, mix cold in, so we could bath without burning the oil. I remember her breakdowns when the car wouldnt start, or being stranded on the side of the road. Or when she woukd go through the couch looking for change to buy bread and peanut butter so i could have lunch at school the next day. She would make such a huge deal out of thrift shopping for school clothes, that i still love going there now for clothes on my own, im 28 now. I was still young at the time, but i would help her bring in firewood, from outside, to the basement every day after school, and stack it to keep us warm in the winter. I helped her shovel out of some of the biggest snowstorms ive seen before, and she wouldnt complain, though you knew she was tired. Now that im a father in a single income household, where we are struggling too, I finally truly appreciate the things she did for us, and understand some of the mental issues she struggled with. 

Dad on the other hand, lived in a motel after the divorce, which was owned by my grandparents on my moms side. He still helped mom as much as he could with us, though he didnt make much and had to go back to school after his job shut down. He NEVER showed his stress around my sister and i, and tried to make everything as positive as possible, given his situation. He drove some of the worst, cheapest cars ive ever been in, but made sure they were safe enough for us to be in. He ended up taking over the house when mom lost it, and rented out bedrooms to friends to keep things going, which meant 2 beds in his room, for when mom let him take us for the weekend. He ended up going bankrupt and moving back in with his parents in their trailer, but he kept that hope going for us. The things he couldnt do for us, my grandfather helped him achieve that, like renting movies, helping him buy us chips and treats at the store, things like that. 
Honestly, they both went through alot, and it did get VERY messy between them a few times, mom took off across the country for like 5 years with no contact after flying out in the middle of the night with my sister who had no idea what was going on. We had to drive like 1/3 of the way across canada to pick her up after court/police involvement. Mom eventually moved back, 2.5 hrs away in another province, and she patched things up with my sister and i, and they both remarried other people, got houses, and decent jobs, but I'll absolutely NEVER forget the things they went without, just to keep us going. honestly those memories are what keeps me going right now, in my own situation. Sure they had some wrongdoings, but everyone does, and theyre my parents. I hope this sort of answers your question, although two situations. Thanks for the venting opportunity. I dont get to talk about this stuff with anybody"

They also play other games like redball, hello neighbor, mario odyssey, bendy and the ink machine, all kinds of systems and platforms. They also have videos doing random family things,  which are still entertaining. They also made a couple entertaining music videos like ""down with the pew"" which has his son dressed as a cop shooting bad guys with nerf guns, and one about the game ""grannys house"" which they play on there as well. The dad, ""duddy"" as he goes by, seems to be good with animation programs as well as mixing music, assuming hes the one doing so. They also have a line of toys, which are based on the family members, as well as a couple characters they made up, such as ""derpy bacon"" and the ""gurkey turkey"". They do a few funny challenges with the kids as well. Im not associated with them or anything, i just find its something I can watch with my son, and theres some i'd watch on my own too.

Seems to save them some money during production, when able to source parts from other vehicles, especially leftover parts that woukd otherwise be sold through parts dealers suh as NAPA, etc. There are forums dedicated to offroading sorentos, although I havent seen more than a 2"" lift commercially available myself. Honestly I didnt look that hard as it was my daily driver and was kind of beat up. I believe mine had an eaton LSD, something similar to GMs G80 in most pickup rear axles, though im not sure it was actuated in the same way. If you look it up, they (the G80) can be a little complicated to setup just right if you tear it apart, unlike alot of full locker setups. I cant say ive had my sorento rear diff opened up, so im unsure of how its setup in relation. The 3.5 did have some issues with the Harmonic balancer, as well as the main bolt into the crank through the pulley shearing off. Ive seen it happen when torqueing the bolt too. Had to remove the crank and send it to a machine shop to drill the bolt out and rethread the hole, kind of a mess lol. Overall though, Id say the sorento is a very capable machine considering it was designed as a family vehicle.

Is a pioneer headunit from say canadian tire (kind of like walmart but more vehicle, and outdoorsy stuff for non canadians) equal in quality from something you would get of similar functionality from pioneer directly? Like would the basic cd am/fm bluetooth, aux, dual rca output headunit, be of the same quality of a similar setup directly from pioneer? Or are they made cheaper, but look similar? Im asking because i was told say, a samsung TV from walmart, is built cheaper and of less quality than buying the same tv from an electronics store, for a little more money (as witnessed by buying one there, returning it and buying the ""same"" tv from ""the source"" store) does this apply to headunits as well?"

My grandfather bought it on lease return when it was a year old, and strictly used it to haul his camper to the campground every summer, then stored inside a heated warehouse with the camper in the winters. I never had such a nice truck before. It had the red interior as well, and i stuffed 2 12"" subwoofers in the back. The only thing i would have liked would be for it to have at least 1 year door, but the third door option didnt come out till '97. It also had 2 of the long red cherry bomb glasspacks that ended the required 30cm behind the cab.  It sounded mean. Had alot of great memories in this truck. Changed my first water pump in the walmart parking lot with basic hand tools, and brought my son home from the hospital when he was born with this truck. Since it had the exhaust on it all through my (now ex)'s pregnancy, if my son couldn't sleep, a drive in the truck and he was asleep within 5 minutes, since that rumble was so familiar to him. I went and traded it for a 2001 BMW 740il. It was cool at the time, but i know id still be driving that truck had i kept it."

Hes a super nice guy otherwise, and has a VERY well trained dog. When he goes for coffee he will sit the dog by the window of the coffee shop, set his leash on the ground, and go sit inside by the window while he has his coffee.  People can come and pet his pup, and the dog wil not leave that spot until he picks the leash up again.

I also put a steering column on a camry and put the nut through the wrong way and stripped the threads on the column because it was already after 5 and i rushed myself.

Shit happens, to all of us, at some point or another. Sometimes we are trying to show our service manager how fast we can do things and we mess up. The best thing you could do is go sit with your manager, admit your fuckups and apologize out the ass. Tell them youd like to keep a checklist so it doesnt happen again, let them know you want to be better. Most people are pretty understanding. Maybe suggest a checklist be printed out, so you can hand it in with your work orders when youre done. As long as you show them you actively are trying to be a better technician, theyll likely work with you.
