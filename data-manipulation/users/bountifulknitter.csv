RedditLaqueristas,ffigtrm,t3_ettnvg,1579973538.0,"When I was picking a polish at the nail salon yesterday, I was talking to a girl about how I wanted to try something different because I always get dark nail colors. 


It turned out that she wanted to try something different because she always gets light colors. 


So, we decided to pick nail polishes out for each other. She picked this sparkly pink for me and I picked a blue/grey color for her. I’m pretty happy with her choice, I hope she is happy with mine!

I was going to ask her if we could take pics of our nails together, but I chickened out at the last minute."

shorkie,fel7im1,t3_epp17y,1579215733.0,"Our shorkie will be 2 in Feb, it took us almost a full year to get her trained! I've never had potty training issues with dogs until Abby came along.
The things that worked for us were:

1. During the day, I was taking her out every hour until she peed or pooped. She had to at least pee before we'd go back in, If she did both, I'd let her wait 90min until the next time. If at any time in between she looked like she may need to go, outside we went. (I'm disabled and home all day pretty much everyday, so admittedly, this was easier for me to do than a lot of other pet owners. )

2. WHILE she was peeing or pooping I tell her ""go potty!"" in a happy voice, when she's done, she gets a high value treat right away. I actually bought a fanny pack just for walks to keep her treats and poop bags in. She ONLY gets that specific high value treat when she she goes to the bathroom outside, no other times. We still do this now and I'll probably keep it up for the foreseeable future, since it works.

3. Taking her out is the first thing I do in the morning and the last thing I do at night.

4. I don't know if its just my weirdo or not, but she is not content just going out in the backyard, I have to actually walk her down the street and back. She thinks she owns the neighborhood though so I think having the opportunity to mark ""her"" territory helps.

5. For the occasional inside accident, if I see her doing it, she gets one firm ""no!"" and then is taken outside. If its something I missed her doing and found later, I just clean it up. Yelling at dogs after the fact does nothing.

It took a while, but eventually, she learned that when she went outside and did her thing, she got treats. Abby could care less about praise, all she wants is treats, so it works for us. So now, when she needs to go, she comes to get me, she'll boop my face with her nose, nudge me, or sit in front of me and ""talk"" to me to get my attention. She still has occasional accidents, but they are MUCH less frequent thankfully.

Again, I'm home pretty much all the time, so YMMV. I'm interested to see what other shorkie owners have experienced with these crazy dogs.
