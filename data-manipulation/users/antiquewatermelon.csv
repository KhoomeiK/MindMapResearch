After that I made a new world that I still have to this day. My very first house on that world is literal garbage but some of the newer ones look much better. I haven’t played on it in a few months but I never want to lose it because I spent so long building it!"

teenagers,fd6zhmv,t3_ek687d,1578197631.0,MY GOD I feel the part about not being taken seriously in my soul!!! I find especially by older men. For example I was hospitalized over the summer and was assigned a male doctor and I would explain to him the medication he put me on was making me sleep all day and he said “well your sleep schedule is messed up because you’re depressed but it’ll get better:)” no matter how many times I explained to him this didn’t start until I started the medication he put me on and that I was sleeping all night and through the day. Finally one day he listened and was like “well why didn’t you tell me that!!” guess what bucko. I did. And that’s why I always request female doctors now

college,fc64jwu,t1_fc52me6,1577472114.0,You can do whatever works for you. Personally I used the notes app in my phone for the project we had to do. Just anything that’s portable and easy to record in will work!
college,fc4mbbv,t3_eg1nyj,1577420912.0,"I’m in your boat. I gained almost 30 lbs (yikes) since the start of my freshman year a year and a half ago. I think a lot of it is due to starting medications but I still feel awful stepping on the scale. 

I took a class this past semester where we learned the steps to make a big life change, such as changing your diet and such. It’s important to record your current behaviors, such as what you’re eating now if you want to go the diet route or why you choose not to exercise and your thoughts that surround those events. Using what you’ve recorded you can make a comprehensive plan to target what happens before , during, and after those things. It’s also helpful to note that rewarding the positive behaviors is more effective than punishing the negative behaviors. I hope this helped!"
