A baby could feed someone for about a month, so you'd need to make a lab-baby once every 2 months/couple purely for food. Then you just get to keep your favourite 2 babies in your lifetime for pro-creation, and voilà ! Sustainable self-eating civilization."
theydidthemath,ff8xfc7,t1_ff8olfb,1579699220.0,"For a more accurate assessment of how long humanity would last :

Every human would be eating ~100g meat/day, so every human would be killing about 0.0025 humans/day.

For N humans, the total death rate would be 0.0025\*N people/day.

N is a function of time -> N(t). We also know the derivative : N'(t) = -0.0025*N(t) (I'm going on the assumption that natural births and deaths cancel each other out, and that only the carnivorous deaths cause the population to effectively change)

-> N'(t) + 0.0025 N(t) = 0

That is a simple 2nd order differential equation, which is solved by the function

N(t) = A \* exp(-0.0025\*t) with A a constant that depends on initial conditions

We know that, at t=0, there are 7 billion people, so the function of human population is

N(t) = 7\*10^9 \* exp(-0.0025\*t)

In order to avoid extinction, we need somewhere in the order of 100-1000 humans. This means Humanity would be doomed after somewhere between 17 to 19 years. Humanity would be down to two people nibbling on each other after about 25 years, and down to one about 200 days later. 

I have to assume that, at that stage, that last person would start to contemplate stopping eating human flesh, though. Probably wouldn't survive more than a couple of decades, however. [Eating other humans can have nasty side-effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease))

Total Time for the last human to be gone from the face of the planet : 20-50 years, depending on how good the last remaining humans do as survivors.

Doomsday Ranking : C+. Gruesome, but not very fast. Zombies would be a better choice, as they start eating more humans as humanity dies off, not less."

Average age of American LGBT people is 37.3 years, average age of non-LGBT americans is 47.9 years. One third of LGBT people are 18-24, while only 15% of straight people are in that age bracket.

Inversely,  about 5% of LGBT people are over 65, while the same is true for ~20% for straight people.

worldnews,fegqslq,t1_fego9rd,1579100349.0,"> both Chinese and Indian populations are going to be on the decline by 2100.

Yes, but the Chinese population will still be well over the billion at that point, at the Indian population is projected at 1.5 billion. That's respectively twice and three times as much as the US. The Chinese GDP is projected to surpass the American GDP before 2030, and to be almost double that of America by 2100. 

That is not the relationship of two equal powers. By 2100, to stand at an equal footing with China, you'd have to have an unified West (EU and US). Maybe that will happen, in which case you'll have a world shared between several great powers. Maybe the CCP, the EU or even the US will have dissolved in smaller pieces by then. Maybe we'll all die in WWIII soon, or a revolution in space technologies will completely upset the economical balance once more.

The only certain thing is that, as the world currently stands, the US hegemony on the world is on a timer, and China is on the course to be the next superpower."
worldnews,fegk0nq,t1_fegd84r,1579095099.0,"> The US is a weird one tho.

The US is young, not even 250 years old, and most that time was spent as a secondary power - the US has been a superpower for about a century, by now. 

By comparison, the roman empire held for over five centuries before the western half fell, and the Byzantine Empire lasted much longer itself. In China, both the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled for almost 3 centuries. In Persia, the Abbasid Empire lasted for over 400 years, and in Europe, the British Empire lasted for about 350 years.

As things are currently going, I do not think the US will be able to remain a superpower for another century. That is not to say I think we will see an american dissolution - communications technology has sufficiently improved that I think it is feasible to hold onto such a large country indefinitely now - but US population is simply too small to be able to compete - economically or otherwise - with China and India in the long run."

nextfuckinglevel,fdmwyg9,t1_fdmae4c,1578569580.0,"Some numbers. The mean time to injury as a spectator is 2 million hours (so you can expect to be injured once every 2 million hours you go to live games).

As a point of comparison :

The mean time for a baseball player to suffer an injury is about once every 1.000 hours.   
The mean time to have a car accident is once every 7.000 hours.   
The mean time to have a plane accident is about once in every 500.000 hours.   

Finally, little fun fact :  if you are going to a baseball game, you have about as much chance of being injured during the game as during the parking of your car just before the game."

I don't think it needs to be defended that Western Europe & North America are very peaceful, with terrorism being the only realistic threat, but even in the rest of the world, the situation has mostly improved compared to 50 years ago.

The Balkans aren't flooding with blood, the USSR isn't starving millions of people, most of South & Central America isn't under fascist dictatorships (altough the situation has been worsening lately over there), there's no large scale genocide (that I know of, at least) happening in Africa, India and Pakistan are posturing but not fighting an all-out war, and the US isn't throwing napalm in the Pacific.

Has the global situation worsened over the last 15 years ? Yeah, I'd say so. But, overall, I think it's still a more peaceful world than it was in 1970, and 1970 was definitely better than 1940."
