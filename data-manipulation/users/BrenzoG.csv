I thought it sounded like free money too, but the expenses are pretty gnarly sometimes, rates (similar to council tax) are very low in belfast but even then its a sizeable chunk - probably close to a months rent on average, paid by the landlord.

We're moving away from personal responsibility these days, if you squander your money at 21 you only have yourself to blame, its not your family's or anyone elses job to prevent that.  

I know as many reasonable, long term thinking, career driven 21 year olds as I do 50 year olds.  If you havent acquired the value of money by adulthood I think it's unlikely you ever will.  The older people I know spend it all on wine, eating out and kitchen renovations,  you can judge peoples spending anyway you want but very few people spend their money logically anyways."

I'm not taking them personally, I just don't think its morally/logically correct to withold someone's inheritance until well into adulthood. If you were the person inheriting and someone was investing your money inneficiently, dangerously, not investing it at all etc then you wouldnt be happy with that outcome.


OPs son is 16, no one would argue he should inherit his money as of tomorrow, but that's very different from 25 being ideal."
UKPersonalFinance,ffm3jzp,t1_ffm2iu6,1580047944.0,"Yeah but how well does the average person know how to handle my money? Not well at all I would wager.  I wouldnt trust most of my family to look after 2 grand never mind 200.   

It's more the principle of it, if I invest it poorly or squander it there is no one to blame but myself, if its in the control of someone else and they invest it poorly you'll feel slighted for life.

I went off to uni to study and lived on a knife edge for nearly 2 years because the courts are very slow moving around complicated estates - if it had have been 4, I wouldve certainly had to drop out from my ""dream"" course half way through.  These things definitely matter.

I'm just under 25, the idea that I wouldnt qualify as responsible for my own money is hilarious. Nobody needs to be looking after you when you're most certainly an adult.


Absolutely, my mum lost most of her inheritance to a dodgy financial advisor - hence the importance of habing control of your own finances.

iamverysmart,ffi1nsb,t1_ffi0c6d,1579962413.0,"So in the UK you can do medicine as an undergraduate straight out of high school - this is a 5 year cohesive program but you're given the option to do an extra year called an intercalated degree:

Usually between 3rd and 4th year, you can take a year out to study something else for a year - most often related to medicine, like biomedical sciences but it doesnt necessarily have to be.  During this year you get an entire bachelors degree in one year - so a lot of people do this  because it's not only a break from a long medical education, but really efficient in terms of time,  to get a bachelors in biomedical science would usually take 3 years.

So 5 years cohesive program with an optional 1 year of study in something else.

There are also a handful of programs that offer an accelerated 4 year course for postgraduates, these are usually longer hours and longer terms to compensate for the shoeter time - However they're also a lot more competitive than the longer course and in the UK we have a limit on how many medical courses you can apply for - only 4 per year.  So if you pick lots of very competitive post graduate courses and dont make it onto any of them then its quite a risk.


It's a bit complex over here as you can see, but it all sort of makes sense if it's what you get taught.



It's also very different in terms of residencies here.   Because we graduate medical school slightly younger than Americans - due to it being an undergraduate course you can graduate as young as 22 in Scotland.   So we have 2 mandatory clinical years after medical school called foundation years, you get paid (very little considering debt and education, and even less in comparison to how doctors are paid in the states).   

After these two years you can begin specialisation (rather than straight out of medical school - which is how the states do it if i understand it correctly).  Also our specialisation process seems to take longer,  the equivalent of a residency in family medicine over here is 6 years instead of 3.  We have some specialties like neurosurgery that require 10 years or more AFTER foundation years (so 12 years after graduation) to become a consultant. Gnarly,"

IIRC they would like to be having 3 per couple on average, but are having <2 in almost all western nations other than the USA, this does not conflict with the demographic transition model.

This is because pumps are a bit leaky, and once a concentration gradient is that large some sneaky ions push their way across, and compensate for the movement via the pump.

We then use these concentration gradients in various important physiological processes e.g nerve conduction.

The electrical signals that travel down your nerves are not electrons moving, but rather the inflow of sodium (which is charged), it begins at the start of the neuron, and as ions move in, they in turn stimulate channels to allow even more sodium in - this moves along towards the terminal end - conduction!

Here goes:

Step 1. Take a gross average of all hours worked by men and women - due to higher rates of stay at home parenting in the female sex we see that men work longer hours on average.

Step 2. Compare time spent on household chores in large aggregate average between men and women (rather than between single members of each sex) to show that women do more chores than men - Largely explained by the aforementioned fact that more women are stay at home parents (ignore this as it does not fit the agenda).

Step 3. Use this information to pretend that some single woman working a 40 hour week is actually working 56 (2 and a bit extra hours of chores per day) and the hypothetical male equivalent only 40.

Step 4. Adjust male working hours or salary to compensate.
