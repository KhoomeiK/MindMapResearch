Futurology,ffaen0r,t1_ff9dduk,1579733875.0,"The simplest asteroid mining would be to extract resources for in space use that don't require much processing. That can happen very soon, within 5-10 years. When starship from spacex is running it will be possible to build a relatively cheap expandable capsule hotel resort for a few hundred people with a few launches. Once there is actual commercial activity in orbit it will be more feasible to develop other things like asteroid mining. Maybe for Earth orbit, although you would have to price an actual lower cost than just bringing it up when it's so close. Lunar or the famous Lagrange points are farther out and might make more sense.

That would be first and easiest, water for fuel and air, straight rock for shielding and grinding into soil and dirt, and nickel iron to make metal. You could refine that without too much work or use it as is for low grade purposes.
