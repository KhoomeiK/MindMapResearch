You are completely correct that cannabis can trigger schizophrenia in people who are genetically at risk of developing a psychotic disorder (such as people who have a parent with a psychotic disorder). This is one of the many reasons that I believe we should have truthful drug education, so that people can make informed decisions before doing something they regret because they weren't educated on the TRUE ramifications of it."
tumblr,ffihpjr,t1_ffi9puq,1579974134.0,"THC edibles tend to be much more intense and MUCH longer lasting than alcohol. They also affect your brain much differently; THC increases the activity of dopamine in the brain (leading to feelings of euphoria and relaxation, as well as impaired focus or hyperfocus), whereas alcohol reduces the amount of neural activity in the brain via its effects on GABA and glutamate (leading to hindered decision making, poor coordination, relaxation. Your brain is working a lot slower than normal). You also can't die from THC consumption, whereas it is terrifyingly easy to die from alcohol poisoning."

Talk to your advisor as well, they are a good starting point for finding career advice. And don't be afraid to look at jobs outside of the direct field of mental healthcare."
college,ffd2wn4,t1_ffcx28x,1579812359.0,"I’m a last semester senior. 17 credits+job+research lab+volunteer hours required for class. I can’t drop any of my credits because I need them all to graduate. Can’t drop job because money, can’t drop volunteer hours because I’ll fail my class, don’t want to drop my lab because it is the one (1) thing still keeping me sane. I don’t have any classes on Friday so I pretty much spend Friday-Sunday doing homework and don’t really have time to chill on the weekends."
