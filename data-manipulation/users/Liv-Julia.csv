depression,ffb1fpg,t3_esmuyx,1579749408.0,"Absolutely. Go, make an appointment today. Life will be so much easier. There are things you may have to give up like a normal weight, a sex drive, hair, etc. But it is worth all of it. I'm not being sarcastic. Even fat, balding and asexual, I wouldn't go back to depression.
It may take some time to find the right drug mix for you and some time to climb out of the depression but when it finally happens, it is glorious.

And do therapy as well. Even the most chemical of depressions has a behavioral root. You can lay ghosts to rest you didn't know you had and be that much happier.

For example: I used to feel guilty and ashamed and responsible for every. Single. Thing. It was horrible. My spirit was crushed and I was embarrassed all the time. Now I don't give a shit if someone dislikes me. I know I'm worthy and their opinion doesn't matter.
God, life is so much better."

You situation is why we never had a third kid. 

I was so miserable I wanted to die when I was pregnant. It was so long ago that they didn’t believe in depression during pregnancy. I got patted on the head and trivialized so many times I actually considered suicide before I sought help. My husband and I are from very big families and I just assumed I would have five or six kids. Alas, it was not to be but I do NOT regret it because I could not face pregnancy again. I know that I would either die or kill myself. 
Your job in life is to do the best thing for yourself to allow yourself to be best human being..

All of this without metal, roads, draft or food animals that could be domesticated or the wheel!  
How is that dumb? Those guys are brilliant.

In addition, they dealt with people so different they might as well be from Jupiter AND survived a calculated genocide. They are one of the very few people who were successful. The Minoans and Picts are gone, the Etruscans and Romans are no more.

Call the family doctor, ask for recommendation to a free/low cost therapist. Be the person you wish was there for you. Depression is pulling the wool over your eyes and whispering black words in your ear.

You have to emerge from your depression to see what a wonderful person you are right now. You have a lot to contribute."
