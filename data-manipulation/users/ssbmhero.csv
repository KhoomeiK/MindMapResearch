You act as if people aren't being paid for their labor. They should have the right to unionize and collectively bargain. 

His wealth is also primarily stoc, he isn't sitting on $100B in cash and not sharing it. Amazon only recently started being profitable, the value of amazon is not determined by Bezos. 

His employees should be paid a living wage, but whatever he earns after that is for him to have.

politics,ffd6ord,t1_ffd3h3j,1579814473.0,"I’m not against expanded worker rights at all and I don’t think Amazon treats it’s employees well. 

If we were talking about a single warehouse than I would agree with your points, the workers are the ground understand better than bezos or the executives what is happening in that factory. Amazon is not a single warehouse or even a group of warehouses. It’s a multifaceted company in multiple industries. 

In terms of bezos. I think he has earned everything he has. I think he should be taxed way more, much much more, but ultimately he was the one who created this company with his work. How do you compare an hour of working a thoughtless job moving boxes to creating a the entire company. How much are the sleepless nights, with no promise of reward, no guidelines or directions worth? 

Ultimately bezos has the most stake in Amazon as he always has. He should get to decide what happens to the company that he created.  Sure, now, Amazon could lose all its value and he would be fine in life. Not the richest man, but he would be able to do whatever he wanted. But at the start of the company this was his entire life, the idea of giving workers, who would largely be interested in their short term salaries, say in how the company is run just doesn’t make sense to me. 

Stakeholders in a company deserve to be rewarded for allowing the company to exist in the first place. 

While I understand and agree with a lot of the anger towards owners, investors and shareholders I think people really underestimate the amount of work, above and beyond what any normal worker has done, and risk involved with the venture.

However maybe they had the brains enough to know that Japan couldn’t really build many more ships that quickly. And that America would be setting out dozens of battleships and 5 or more aircraft carriers a year for the rest of the war. 

Similar to the nazis accounts of the battle in the Soviet Union. After all the death and destruction they inflected, once they started to understand they weren’t going to break the soviets, I think many of them looked at the ruined towns and cities and thought that their town and city would soon look like that.

MilitaryPorn,ff67yzh,t1_ff66lap,1579621282.0,"No doubt the racism played a part. I don’t think though that if the Japanese soldiers behaved like the German soldiers on surrender from the start that they would have be met with such brutality by the allies. The personal accounts from allied soldiers all have descriptions of Japanese soldiers feigning surrender or death in order to kill more of their enemy. I don’t see how anyone could watch an enemy kill their buddy when their buddy was trying to help that enemy, and then be expected to try and help another enemy. Maybe not kill them on site at first, but you see it happen enough times and I think most people would view their opposition as kill on site. 

I still think the behavior of the troops was more impactful than the racism in the brutality in that war. Even the Germans and soviets took hundreds of thousands of each other’s soldiers as prisoners, they were not all liquidated on the field and that was a war of racial supremacy. Both of those armies were known to be “fanatical” but even then they still didn’t engage in the same tactics as the Japanese on such a large scale. Incidents occurred but it wasn’t as prevalent, at least from what we can understand from the first hand accounts. 

To be fair to them they were an army from a different culture with different values that had less than 100 years ago not been involved in any European style wars. The laws of European warfare took centuries to establish with prisoner treatment and even then many European nations were still quite brutal to POWs. When they fought the Russians in 1905 the leadership tried, and to a certain extent succeeded in leading the troops in a “gentlemen’s” style war. This was a concerted effort to improve the prestige of japan and gain respect from the other great powers. Once Japan became a pariah state and no longer cared for the opinion of the great powers the leadership stopped making such an effort. Some individual generals did, but some did not and they didn’t always have power to stop low level atrocities. The difference between the nazi atrocities and the Japanese ones was that the nazi killings were very top down. Hitler and the SS ordered the killing of certain groups. The Japanese high command didn’t really do the same thing, but they didn’t try hard enough to stop it either. The imperial Japanese army was much more of an ancient army in the sense that the soldiers seemingly had insane bloodlust that was not quelled or disciplined out of them by leadership as it is in most modern armies."
MilitaryPorn,ff5x4t7,t1_ff5rea6,1579613174.0,"Maybe once they were captured and taken off the battlefield. 

Japanese soldiers though were extremely dangerous to capture and the suicidal actions taken by some of the soldiers pretending to surrender at the start of the war cost the lives of countless more Japanese soldiers who were just killed on site because of the reputation their army had earned from the fighting. 

Of course not all Japanese soldiers acted this way and it’s hard to tell the actual percentage, but that, mixed with other Japanese tactics and to be honest a little racism (although I don’t think this was a leading cause), led to the deaths of many Japanese wounded and surrendering troops."

The difference of military prowess was probably only so great when considering the romans or mongols against their foes. 

Tech was also not everything. The leadership and corps of the allied military were substantially better. However it is frightening to see how simply a few decades difference in military tech was so dominant on the battlefield. Merely 200 years before this time an army with centuries old technology could perform well, in the field, against a modern opponent. 100 years before that and centuries of military tech would often make little difference."

People have related Bernie support to trump support and while there are actual similarities that don’t involve relating any of their policies, it usually seems to be coming from a place of criticism. One of trumps greatest accomplishments in my view was bringing people into politics and voting who had left. Despite me disagreeing with them vehemently, it’s still undeniable that trump has mass grass roots support, which in general I prefer over corporate business support.

It’s really sad that trump is the first “outsider” president. A few things in his campaign were very good critiques of Washington. Naturally lots of xenophobia in his campaign which basically ruled it out for me pretty quickly. But damn when he would go against corruption and our endless wars, he had really good points. Telling Clinton that he had access to her because of donations and that he had donated to everyone on the republican stage and they were all bought without any moral compass. That was one of the most impactful statements of any debate. That was probably my peak approval of trump.

JJ was just going back to the plot he set up and pretended that TLJ never happened. 

Jj set this series up well, and then seeing his final execution I am confident saying that his plot would have been good in a trilogy. If this movie had 2 movies it would have been much better. The biggest problem was the insanely fast pace of the story. 

I think most of the blame is on Johnson in terms of directors, but obviously Lucas film and Disney have more blame than them. Johnson was the first one to disregard what had been established and he did so in a way that couldn’t really be followed.

Honestly, I know people like the last Jedi, but it really destroyed this series. ROS in my opinion has the impossible task of picking up after the last Jedi, and so it basically tried to shit all over their plot and came up with something somewhat decent. 

The full plot of this movie was good but had to be condensed into one movie instead of two. I think if a lot of these plot points happened over two movies with character building and slower scenes it would have turned out well. 

I think it’s fine to view the last Jedi as a good stand alone movie. I completely disagree but I can understand the point. However I don’t think there is much argument that it ruined the series and was a terrible movie in the scope of the trilogy and greater franchise."

The frank truth is that in this situation Iran doesn’t have the luxury of being able to act like we can. The concept that these are negotiations between equal entities is false. As seen by even the minor escalation, it happened in their neighborhood of the world. The hardliners in their nation, may very well get them all killed.

worldnews,fehkrb9,t1_fehj5y7,1579118540.0,"They were on high alert, because of an attack they were committing against American bases. 

There was little threat of an American invasion if the Iranians didn’t respond. So the heightened alert was their doing. 

Again the main decision here to not ground planes that night is the majority of the reason this happened. Iran knew that this night would be a hot airspace. That is the main reason this plane was shot down. 

In terms of how we got to this escalated state... trump is a terrible diplomat. I liked the nuclear deal, leaving it was dumb. I think the nuclear deal should have had no sunset on when Iran can get a nuke. No other nation should have a nuke than already does, this is a threat to all humanity. The nations that do have them are already a scary mix. Pakistan/India is just a powder keg. Throwing one of the most controversial nations into that mix, a nation that also has a religious theocracy, is just an awful idea in my opinion. 

Iran has done their share to escalate as well. Maybe it’s to appease their hardliners, but that’s not an excuse. Fundamentally I am opposed to their regime so I don’t really view their escalation as justified in any way. Why are we in Iraq? Good question. Why is Iran there either? Just because I disagree with our presence doesn’t justify their attacks against us as they aren’t Iraq.

worldnews,fehbp25,t1_feh982o,1579113258.0,"By saying that it’s trumps fault you are removing blame from Iran. 

The fact is that Iran knew they were going to launch missiles that night. They knew that this would at minimum lead to higher levels of nerves for their troops working their defenses. The chances of an American retaliation were also there, in which case you could have had American fighters/bombers in the same airspace as Iranian fighters and civilian planes. 

The choice to not ground air travel was absurd and dangerous. 

It’s like blaming the nazis/Japan for Japanese interment in America. Sure, that situation arose because of fear that Japanese Americans were working for Japan.
