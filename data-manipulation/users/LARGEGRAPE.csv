entitledparents,fff54o4,t1_fff1e05,1579875945.0,"Ah the enlightened fool. We are not bacteria in a bowl greenSixx. The more people the more ways to make food. Think of Russia, Canada, and large parts of Africa. There is a vast resource of usable land. Even India has plains and empty jungles. There is places to go and resources to properly maintain. The overpopulation hype began in 1940! Many of the world's greatest thinkers claimed we would on last a few more decades. Now it is 2020. We are not dwindling from starvation (some are due to circumstance). We are making advances that help us along. From your line of thinking buds the want for people to die and it's never yourself. Abortion clinics are very common in black and Hispanic communities and hid their blatant racism with ""bodily rights"". China limited birth to two children per family and now there is no one to care for the old. Overpopulation isnt a thing and attempts to fix the problem that isnt there has ended in much suffering."
