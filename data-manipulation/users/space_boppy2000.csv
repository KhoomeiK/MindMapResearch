unpopularopinion,ffb09ci,t1_ffazjrh,1579748613.0,"""So how well do they really work? The chances of getting pregnant with a condom depend on the type you use. Condoms that go on the penis work 82% of the time. This means 18 out of 100 people who use them as their only form of birth control will become pregnant each year.

Condoms that fit into the vagina are 79% effective — 21 out of 100 people who use them as their only form of birth control will become pregnant each year.""

pettyrevenge,ff95jio,t3_esat25,1579705345.0,I'm confused. How did you start a business at 16 and generate enough revenue in only 2 years to buy a brand new vehicle upfront? Am I misunderstanding the timeline? Most small businesses don't turn a profit until at least 3 years after startup let alone those started by a 16 year old. How is no one else questioning this?

TalesFromYourServer,felklwe,t3_epobh9,1579224430.0,"Reminds me of a story:

I work at a bank. A local restaurant banks with us. The owners come in daily. We (the branch) went to said restaurant one night. The bill got split in some weird way. My boss was confused (drunk), had the waitress change it multiple times. My assistant manager and my boss both thought they were in charge of the tip so they both left one. The next day, my boss found out that they both tipped, so when the owner came in SHE ASKED FOR HERS BACK. This is obviously incredibly tacky and super embarrassing for us...we see these people every day - they bring in a ton of money and clients (nearly all of their employees bank with us - deposits, loans, etc)....but!.. she freaking expensed her bill! So the company was paying for it anyway. And the best part? The tip was only $10. There were almost 20 people in that party (spouses and children were invited).  She left this poor waitress $10 on a bill that was most definitely close to $100, then had the nerve to ask for it back.


We ended up all pooling money and gave it to the owner to give to the waitress. We felt so freaking bad."

todayilearned,fdvqxrr,t1_fdvpdx7,1578750501.0,"Yes it can change from baby to baby. I'm sure hormones play some part. I'm hoping when we have our next baby I'll be able to go a full 12 months. 

Clogged ducts are awful! They're extremely painful and can lead to serious infection. I tried to massage my breast while nursing, and changing the baby's position helps too because they draw the milk from different parts. I luckily only ended up with a clogged duct once."
todayilearned,fdvodtk,t1_fdvm6e3,1578749644.0,"Sometimes your milk just dries up. It happened to me. I tried everything (power pumping between feedings, eating certain foods/beverages, etc) but I wasn't producing enough when I pumped at work and my 10 month old was still feeding every 2 hours. We ended up weaning him and mixing the leftover frozen breast milk with formula until it was totally gone. Then weaned from formula to whole milk after he turned 1. It was really difficult. Not only because it was very painful for the first few days, but because I lost that time with my baby. The drying up really got me because I had a crazy oversupply when my milk first came in. You try to convince yourself otherwise, but you feel like less of a mom. It sucks. 

Edit: There are things you can avoid in hopes of keeping your milk. I.e. not taking antihistamines or antiinflammatories."
todayilearned,fdvndvn,t1_fdvletz,1578749393.0,"I'm from Pennsylvania, US. 
We were advised to start solids at 4 months. Rice cereal or oatmeal mixed with breast milk before bed. Then as he got used to it we introduced more and more. Always after a normal breast feeding so he still got those nutrients and didn't fill up on solids. And babies can eat anything and everything but honey and cow's milk before they turn 1."

interestingasfuck,fdt0vkd,t1_fdr99qs,1578710472.0,"I don't know that it's trypophobia so much as megalophobia. 

Trypophobia is ""an aversion to the sight of irregular patterns or clusters of small holes or bumps."" 
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypophobia]

Whereas megalophobia is the fear of large objects. This could be man-made objects (large ships, statues, etc), or objects that are larger than your brain thinks they should be. 
[https://www.verywellmind.com/megalophobia-2671869]

I suffer from megalophobia. My entire life I've been afraid of certain large flowers and would tell those who laughed that it was because they loomed over me. It wasn't until a few years ago that I read about megalophobia and realized that's what it was. It's not just that they look. It's that flowers shouldn't be big enough to tower over you. It's the same feeling I get looking at this picture. In my head, lily pads should be small. No water lily should be that large. It's unsettling and unnerving. 

For those interested this doesn't just affect me with flowers. I've had panic attacks driving in unknown places when I've come up on big bridges and roads and when they have the tall concrete siding (I'm having a hard time describing them ). It's not the height or bridgy-ness that does it, it's that they are such large structures. Those pictures of icebergs with their little tops and freaking ginormous bottoms. Tall buildings don't do it, but seeing people stand next to big ships does. It's really rather interesting. My heart is racing just from thinking and describing this.

Edit: looking at the picture again, I suppose the blocklike cellular structure could be similar enough to holes to trigger trypophobia."
