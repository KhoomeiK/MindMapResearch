nfl,felwlmu,t1_fekungu,1579232759.0,"Dear Chase, I feel like I can call you Chase because you and me are so alike. I'd like to meet you one day, it would be great to have a catch. I know I can't slide as great as you but I think you'd be impressed with my ability to recklessly dive headfirst. I love your hair, you run fast. Did you have a good relationship with your father? Me neither. These are all things we can talk about and more. I know you have not been getting my letters because I know you would write back if you did. I hope you write back this time, and we can become good friends. I am sure our relationship would be a real touchdown!"

4. https://www.staples.com/Staples-Hyken-Technical-Mesh-Task-Chair-Black/product_990119 - here is the link, it should be in store if you wanted to try it out first. I bought mine during some sale for around 100 I think. Def worth it. Good luck."
