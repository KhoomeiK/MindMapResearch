corgi,feat2i0,t1_feari7v,1578951957.0,I’ve never heard of rosewood. Sounds like she’s a sable... gorgeous either way though!
corgi,feapl5a,t3_eo79un,1578951101.0,So cute! Are they red/white or sable?
corgi,f9yx3ce,t3_e7bdbz,1575735123.0,Try green beans! They’re good for dogs and low in calories.
