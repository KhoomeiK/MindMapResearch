There’s a chance you could have happiness and not hate all women. Believe me, I went through a period of hating all men and I had to put on MY big girl pants and work on myself and go to therapy.  U ya pure spewing hate about all women when it was just two that hurt and terrified you. Makes no sense.  Good luck to you."
askwomenadvice,ffu86vk,t3_ev8fj1,1580236529.0,"Do NOT leave your kids when you leave. In my state that would be seen as abandoning your children even if you are escaping abuse.  

Even if you have mental health issues doesn’t mean you can’t be a fantastic mom—-he’s trying to scare/manipulate you. Don’t let him.  

Yes.  Have your own bank account!  Do not let him have access.  Start taking cash withdrawals out of mutual account when you buy groceries or what not and have a safe place to hide for an emergency. 

Get a Post office box, and have mail sent there prior to leaving.  

Put all your documents in a safe, easy to grab file. Birth certificates, social sectors cards, car titles...whatever.   

Make sure to have extra (if you can) of medications for the family or be sure they are easy to pack and ready to go. 

Basically have the basics ready. Pack bags for the kids and leave at a friends. If he wouldn’t notice missing clothes and such.  

Good luck!  I’ll never forget the first time I was told my ex was emotional abusive, controlling and manipulative. I already knew it but to have someone say I’m not cray and yes he’s nuts helped me so much.  Leaving him changed my whole world for the better!

Edit:

In many states there are free attorneys that will help women in abusive situations.  Check your local women’s shelters. They have many services to help you.!!

askwomenadvice,ffpjzes,t1_ffpil6g,1580096874.0,"Yes. I divorced my abusive, pushy husband who took my trauma and used it to make me feel bad or guilty when I didn’t want to have sex with him. Who badgered me to have sex.  Who would rather have sex with me, knowing i wasn’t into it, so he could get his pleasure.  

When I met a man after that, I told him I had some trauma and didn’t know how things would go sexually.  He waited until I was ready.  He had the upmost respect for me. Treated me with kindness and care and never ever pushed and always asked if it was ok to move forward.   I had the best, most rewarding and  adventurous  sex  with that man. Our relationship eventually ended but for other reasons!

I continue to work on myself.  Heal the things that come up for me.  I know now what is right for me and how I need to be loved and embraced for the person that I am.  I will never let anyone treat me the way my ex did.  He made all
My insecurities, traumas so much h worse.

I hope you find the right solution for yourself. Be true to you and what you need. Love & Light.

Edit—-I also went to talk therapy and reiki sessions for help. Spoke openly to my females (as most of us all have a story around sexual trauma)."

No. Is no.  It’s not—ask me in ten minutes. Twenty minutes.  It’s just NO!  How about now?  What about now?  Still NO!

You have every right to stop at any point of a sexual act. Any point. The second he enters and you’re not feeling safe and ok, it’s ok to stop.

It’s ok to take a year (or whatever) to work on your and your traumas around your sexuality.  And it may suck for him but too bad. This is your journey.  

Each time you don’t stop, each time you give in when you don’t want to and hope it ends quickly is reestablishing that trauma and makes it more difficult to heal.

Please talk to your husband openly. That you need help in dealing with this and may need to ease back from sex.  If he can’t give you the space and time to heal maybe he’s not the right one to heal with.

Much love and light to you!  Stand up for your healing!"

Are these people racists? Is this the “family issues”?  That she was pressured (and didn’t stand up for you) by friends and family about it?  That you’re good enough to be her close friend in a bunch of different ways until it comes to her hometown and hometown friends?
