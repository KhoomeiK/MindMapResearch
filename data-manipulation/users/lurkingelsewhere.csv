And its insanely cheap and low calorie. I just pan fry the tofu with some salt and pepper then add whatever sauce I want. For brussel sprouts toss in a bit of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Then I roast them in the oven for 20 min at 450°F. And finally toss them in balsamic vinegar, honey, and sesame seeds."

CasualConversation,fg2zu1j,t3_ewk5vd,1580463568.0,"Yo! Freelance artist here. You can get pieces printed at pretty good quality at FedEx for under 5 bucks :) so it's really easy to get it moved from digital to physical to have an easier way to gift it. If you have other local print shops that specialize in artwork too that's also a good route, but not necessary. I've had great results at FedEx and local print shops. 

Just be aware that art always prints darker than how it is on your computer. Have your sister lighten the work between 10-20% so that it comes out how it looks on the computer if you go that route. I usually just drop the opacity on the piece about 15% and save it as a jpeg to print. I know my local FedEx prints things really nicely like that, but your mileage will vary with different printers. I'd you wanna go all out have two versions of it lightened to different degrees and gift the best one, recycle the other since this is your first time at a new print shop. I do this for clients all the time.

If printing isnt an option though I'd make a dedicated post for the piece on the social media site of your choosing and tag them in it to celebrate. Maybe ad a note for them too on the post. If your SO is a more private person that wouldn't like that, you could ways show it to them on your phone or laptop. Texts work too :U

I havent been the direct giver of artwork to an SO but I've had several clients message me back saying the person they gived it to loved it! It's usually something really personal and unexpected, so people tend to love that in gifts!"
CasualConversation,fg2z31j,t1_fg2yxkv,1580462491.0,Eeeyyy nice. I think my insomnia is wearing off so I might pass out soon. But thanks for the chat :) it chilled me out
CasualConversation,fg2z176,t3_ewi9pl,1580462418.0,"I feel this! Its really weird for me to imagine dating someone too similar to me. If I wanted to date myself I'd kiss my mirror lol. I tend to like guys with a similar fashion sense (I'm goth), but not too close to how I look. That would just be way too weird for me"
CasualConversation,fg2yw5r,t1_fg2yohm,1580462219.0,Oof dating is rough. I'm single too. People say you always find love when you least expect it though so maybe giving up again for a bit is the pro strat
CasualConversation,fg2yttz,t3_ewjm7e,1580462127.0,Dont think it would be weird at all. Giving people sweets on valentine's is pretty common. Another post mentioned allergies tho and that's a good point. Make sure to have an ingredient list and make sure everyone knows what's in them so they can be safe!
