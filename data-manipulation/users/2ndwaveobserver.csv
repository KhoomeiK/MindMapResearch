explainlikeimfive,ffk2fxl,t1_ffjzf1m,1580013740.0,For real. Being able to stick your dick in something without confusing your brain from the sensation of another part of your body touching something is game changing. (strictly speaking of masturbstion) sex is still awesome

LifeProTips,ffaqydb,t3_esf8n7,1579742421.0,"This will get buried but the only reason I ever ended up paying is because the state part wasn’t free. That being the case, they give you the option to use money from your refund to pay for it. Now, when you do that, they charge you for using your own tax money to pay for it because that option goes through their bank. So if I’m broke at tax time I’ve had to use that service and it sucks. It’s basically paying to use your own money to get your own money."
aww,ffaq2bo,t3_esgxxu,1579741828.0,"Ha! Yep when I’m on my phone my dog comes up and tries to throw my hand up to get his head in there for a pet. I call it “snooting”. He likes to come snoot me to make me pet him lol he gets plenty of lovin but he’s not a very independent dog. He wants as much as anyone can give. Constantly. He’s a good boy though. 

Except when he gets upset. He’s petty as hell. He chews up my hats but ONLY the snap. Not a single bite mark anywhere on the hat whatsoever. It’s almost like he’s careful to NOT hurt the hat except for the most important part. Just enough so I can’t wear it anymore. It’s so aggravating. The last hat I only had for two days because he found the one before that I only had for a week. All because I ran out to my car to get some stuff to bring inside and he flipped out and chewed the snap strap clean off the damn thing. I don’t even have to shame him anymore. All I do is look at it and then look at him and he he does the shameful head bow. Little turd."

todayilearned,feoxolc,t1_feopkvf,1579307640.0,I’m in the middle of reading it now and it’s as easy to read as any textbook. He was a professor first so his writing is very straight forward and digestible. It’s just opinionated. Everything is “we” as if most people tend to agree with his ideas. He’s not wrong about a lot of stuff but he’s off about plenty. He might be a mathematical genius but he’s no real philosopher. He doesn’t always give reasons behind certain assertions like most philosophical writings. I read a good portion of Leviathan by Thomas Hobbs years ago and it was so descriptive of his ideas that it was hard not to get distracted. I think that’s Teds point here. He needed to write it in a way that more people could understand. I think a good editor could probably clean it up pretty well and highlight certain topics that could get the point across a little quicker.
todayilearned,feojva7,t1_femr4xo,1579301161.0,Yeah he had sent his brother an essay to read like a decade prior. His brother read it and put it in a trunk and forgot about it until he saw the manifesto later on. He went back and re-read the essay and knew it was him.

It had literally everything and could really give a person a better outlook on how good we actually have it in this part of the world."
todayilearned,fel0r2k,t1_fel0f6h,1579211583.0,I’m having a hard time finding the whole story at the moment but I think the shooter was Josef “sepp” Allerberger. He was an Austrian volunteer who started as a machine gunner and learned how to snipe while wounded. He went on to have 257 confirmed kills. He even alleged that the soviets ate their own dead to survive. Crazy shit.
todayilearned,fekzmmb,t1_fekzfeb,1579210916.0,The one where the Soviet troops rape a whole family and force the father/husband to watch while the shove bayonets up their vaginas and murder them. A sniper watches the whole thing as to not give up his position. He finally shoots them all (to wound) and allows the dude to kill them with his bare hands. Then a bunch of tanks came through and leveled the place.
todayilearned,fekz8jb,t1_fekoufh,1579210681.0,The way Reddit works you’re better off just posting the number rather than saving them for a one up comment later. Just throw them out there with sources  and if people wanna dispute you then you can argue.

My colorblindness isn’t very extreme. I’ve never seemed to have problems with the main colors as they are. It’s the weird shades that throw me off. I’ve confused shades of green as grey and vice versa. Also can confuse certain greens and browns. I can actually see blue and yellow better than people with normal vision. When I was a kid I would confuse blue and purple but now I can always see the red bleeding through to make it purple. It’s pretty weird. I see lots of colors.

OldSchoolCool,fek3s38,t1_fek3jff,1579191996.0,I’m already in this conversation on another comment thread. I’m specifically talking about the head in this photo. What they did could be arguably worse because their victims had to live with it. I don’t mean to be insensitive but I’d rather take a gas chamber than be raped 70 times and sent back home to be hushed up about it.
OldSchoolCool,fek3k42,t1_fek3636,1579191862.0,"A powerful leader can make his people do a lot of things. I wonder if they were naturally animals or if they had truly been reduced to being animals by their own dictator. Or maybe like the above quotes said, he condoned it. Maybe they were told “if you don’t brutalize them they’ll come do it to your mother and sisters.” But that also doesn’t explain them taking their own people so I don’t know what to think other than they were just shitty people from a shitty place in time."

LifeProTips,fdj3cth,t1_fdihps1,1578457355.0,They should. The church I went to growing up had very strict rules about no men allowed in the nursery area where small kids hung out during church service. Signs everywhere saying women only which I think is cool but it makes me wonder if they’ve specifically had situations or if was just obvious common sense. Still a good thing I think.
