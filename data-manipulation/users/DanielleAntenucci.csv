That being said, we have borrowed deck plans from Star Wars in the past.  I don't think the Referee stuck to the rules religiously iaw High Guard.  But we did have some fun boarding parties!"

We've had pilot, private investigator, entertainer, librarian, journalist, archaeologist, farmer and seer which all worked out marvelously well.

On a side note, our Keeper would ask us from which country our ancestors originated, and he gave us a free bonus chance to start with a small percentage in the languages of our families (German, French, Italian, Arabic, etc)."
traveller,fgcuwro,t3_exrwpp,1580676452.0,"That is a tough request.  From my experience, Traveller is heavily left up to the discretion of the Referee to make it a good game.  The three Great Rift Adventures are pretty good.  

Also, it is really easy to convert the original Traveller books into Mongoose 2E:  Shadows, Annic Nova, Marooned, Marooned Alone, Kinunir, Research Station Gamma, Secret of the Ancients, etc.  Hope this helps!"
