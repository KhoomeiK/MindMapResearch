TL:DR Goldens as a breed happen to have a lot of physical, mental and temperamental traits that makes them a good working dog in general. Being as popular as they are in general also helps.

Many of the dogs you see as service animals still have active working bloodlines along dedicated show and/or pet bloodlines. Working bloodlines tend to produce dogs that enjoy doing the job they are trained to do and are able to focus when working. Theres now bloodlines specifically for being service animals now too, many of which tied to the training schools and programs.

But all working breeds/bloodlines aren't created equal. Many working breeds are very energetic and can't be expected to sit still for long periods, others aren't as active as needed, some are wary of strangers, not all of them can handle loud noises or a lot of commotion, some can only be trained for one thing, ect, ect. Different breeds have different reputations too, so having a breed with a good reputation saves the program and the dog's future human partner a lot of headaches.

Now look at goldens. A gun-dog breed that is also one of the most popular breeds to get as a pet in many different countries around the world. As breed traits they are calm, gentle and friendly. Being fairly athletic (they are a common sight at agility contesta) and focused also means they won't tire out physically and/or mentally from being on the job all day. They are strong enough to support people leaning on them for a bit and pick up things that might be a bit heavy, but the use in bird hunting means they were bred to hold thing gently in their mouth, so they're less likely to damage what they are asked to pick up.

They tend to be alert and aware of their surroundings, but not very reactive. They are adaptable, dependable and when probably trained they are very obedient. They are also known to be very tuned into their human's emotional and mental state. Most importantly, as a breed they are able to be trained in a large amount of simple and complex commands and retain that training for a long time.

All this makes goldens a great working dog in general, and they have been used for a lot of different things, including all kinds of service dog. Goldens being a popular breed to have as a pet also means that dogs that don't make the cut can easily find a home and you're less likely to have people scared of them. As a result, goldens have various bloodlines across three different kinds of golden (American, Canadian and British) that breeders can draw from for the ideal service dog traits, and the popularity of the breed as a working dog means there's no shortage of reputable breeders to get puppies with tractable bloodlines from."
aww,ff32v8e,t1_ff2y3dx,1579532250.0,"Chihuahuas can be very sweet! But so many of them are nervous wrecks because everyone is a giant that doesn't respect their wants about being left alone or not picked up because they are so small. And for many dogs, they get aggressive when scared or nervous, especially if it's the only thing people listen to when they want to be left alone.

This happens with many, many, small dog breeds. Also can happen a lot with cats whose ""leave me alone"" signals are ignored until they scratch or bite the person bothering them. Add in that people often are less inclined to train agression out of smaller dogs because it's not seen as dangerous, and you have a ""mean"" chihuahua that's honestly just scared of people.

The loud and yappy stereotype is true and a product of breeding though. There was a time they were bred as watchdogs essentially acting as a burglar alarm that alerted the family, and often the bigger guard dogs, to intruders. They're not the only small dog breed that has been historically used for this purpose either."
