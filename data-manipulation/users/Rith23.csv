Needed a separate comment for this because my previous comment was way too long and I apologize for that.

I get the ""mum"" things and the ""dad"" things stereotype. It hasn't been very prevalent in my personal life, but I know it's out there. Yeah, I totally don't disagree with you here.

>Stupid things like one has to try and control what the child eats while other works against it etc. Just a bunch of bullshit

This is where we disagree then I guess. Small things such as this do not imply an unhealthy relationship at all, and sure, if we put it in the context of outside these meme (i.e. little disagreements like in the meme) then yes, it could worsen. But that does not necessarily directly indicate an unhealthy relationship, and like I said multiple times, it's totally jumping to conclusions.

Actively working against it... yeah, sure, that might be. But I do not believe that is quite what the meme implies, though you already know my interpretation of the meme so I won't explain it again.

>if you already think like this, yea you're probably gonna have a unhealthy relationship.

... This just reinforces my point of jumping to conclusions. Apparently you believe that anyone will have an unhealthy relationship if this kind of thing is followed. Which is totally not true, as this is one aspect of several that makes up a relationship."
wholesomememes,ffjw7rs,t1_ffjucl7,1580008636.0,">Exactly, they probably have a good reason for saying no

Sure, she does. But here it is shown that the dad wanted to cheer up the child even though his mom said no. Again, the dad said so not because he wanted to spite the mom, but cheer up the child. How this implies an unhealthy relationship is beyond me.

>and why is being concerned about the child's health always a concern of the mum but not dad?

You're kinda going out of context here... but anyways, I am talking about this meme specifically. Personally speaking, I have had my dad concerned about health and my mom trying to cheer up me in these kind of scenarios multiple times, and vice versa, so not always a matter of sex, but in terms of society stereotypes I guess I see your point.

>I just don't get... any of it? How about talk to the other parent first and say ""Hey, you reckon that was fair maybe we should do something for them etc. blah blah blah""

First of all, you're taking this meme way too seriously. The dad wants to quickly cheer up the child while the mom's just concerned... and they can totally have the full-on conversation needed later as well. It also doesn't quite make sense to have a full-on conversation about this in front of the child over simple ice-cream unless the kid has serious health issues, which is not implied in the meme at all.

Second, so you're basically saying that if the dad and mom have opposite assertive stances (they disagree with each other) it implies an unhealthy relationship?

Also, not everything has to be talked over. If this was a serious issue that did not revolve over something simple as ice-cream with a child's joy, than they should most definitely have conversation over it, as agreement over such topics is a must for a relationship. But a simple disagreement such as this one? 

No man, not necessary, and the meme implies this is all in good fun, especially considering the sub and the positivity of the meme.

Like I said, jumping to conclusions on way too little of a context that doesn't even remotely support an unhealthy relationship."
PrequelMemes,ffjrthk,t1_ffjnw6x,1580005230.0,"No, I agree with you. Just saying that was the likely reason why you might have found it cringy. Some dialogue is placed just to appeal to kids, which is why older peeps like us find it strange (TPM is a good example of this, though hey, it's inspired great memes).

That being said, I never really did find Rebels dialogue to be cringy, and instead had other problems with the show (though I still enjoyed it). But that's your opinion and I respect it."
wholesomememes,ffjrclj,t1_ffjonqv,1580004917.0,"Sure, I guess that is one take on it.

But it's more likely that the dad wanted to cheer up the child after he heard that the mom told him he couldn't eat simply because he saw the child was sad. And of course, moms are always concerned about their children's health so she's mad.

It can also be that the dad was not aware that the mom told the child he couldn't eat ice cream, and just saw the child sad.

Either way, whether it's ""spite"" or the wholesome bit (which is far more likely), saying a relationship is healthy or not based on just this is a HUGE stretch."
