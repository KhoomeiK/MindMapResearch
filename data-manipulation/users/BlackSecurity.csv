As for OPs case, he clearly prepared for this picture. He also used a filter. People only normally use filters if they think it makes the picture look better. But filters don't help us see how you truly look. We don't get to see your skin color, eye color and all the features that are now hidden because of the filter. 

This to me is a sign of insecurity and leads me to believe that OP really does think of himself as unnattractive and wants real advice.

My advice to OP is to be more confident and try to not use filters if your posting here because it makes it more difficult to see the real you."

I never shy away from trying new sauces and spices so being a spice from Popeyes I thought it would have similar taste to what I get from the spicy chicken. 


So I proceeded to put way more than I should have on this burger I was eating. It tasted really good at first but then it hit me a few moments later.

Let me tell you something. NOTHING you do is perfectly 100% safe. You can choose to just walk to your destination and there's still a chance you can die and no one can stop it.

Imagine this scenario. It's 2060 and the only thing that's majorly changed is self driving cars and this parking fee avoiding feature. You are in a busy city with narrow roads that were designed for horses (1-2 million people). It's black Friday. All stores and streets are really busy. So you can't find a parking spot in the city because everyone took the free spots already and parking prices are hiked up for Black Friday. You turn on the fee avoiding feature and go about your day. Now imagine another 10,000 people doing the same. That's an extra 10,000 cars on the street. 10000 isn't that far a stretch considering it's only 0.001-0.005% of the population, however that many extra cars just roaming around the popular stores that everyone wants to shop at must cause extra traffic."
