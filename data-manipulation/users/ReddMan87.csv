crashbandicoot,feec9tp,t3_eoq4gd,1579030793.0,Is this wonderful feature still only available in Europe?
WatchPeopleDieInside,fe7dv2z,t3_eo1rr2,1578913245.0,Reminds me of that powder called Purple Rain.
EDH,fe7bcld,t3_eo2g0p,1578912447.0,"Casual player myself. I absolutely love my Daghatar the Adamant +1/+1 counter deck. Also my Kambal, Consul of Allocation deck. 

Daghatar is fun because of how many counters I can get out so fast and all the lords giving abilities to creatures with counters. Also, Daghatar can take +1/+1 counters from enemy creatures. Which I've done many times to save myself from my friends Karlov of the Ghost Council. 

Kambal is a ton of fun due to the amount of life I can get each turn and all the triggers that happen due to me getting life or opponents losing life or creatures. Tons of fun especially winning with Felidar Sovereign.

About to throw something together around Sai, Master Thopterist. Mono blue artifacts with counter spells because my friends hate that shit."
Terraria,fdvpkea,t3_en6ov6,1578750104.0,10th time? That's it?
Frugal,fdth47p,t1_fdtgxbq,1578716674.0,I have no idea what Blondo or booties are. XD
Frugal,fdtfsho,t3_en2ko2,1578716132.0,"I use to get cheap, $30 pair of work boots from Walmart. I forget the brand. Anywho, they'd wear out within 2-3 months and I'd have to buy a new pair. Just got a pair of Wolverines which were $110. They'll last for years I'm told, so in the long run I'm saving money. 
Let's say the Wolverines last 3 years. The cheap boots last 3 months. In three years I'm paying $360 for the cheap pair while the Wolverines are still going. 
Expensive at first, but saving money in the long run. But also, check reviews before buying as well."

Terraria,fdph98x,t1_fdpgpmn,1578628579.0,"Huge area. All the holes filled up so nothing can spawn outside the area. I'm protected and there's lava to deal damage, but not enough to destroy items. Spear traps next to me to help the lava kill things. Dart traps shooting the entire length of the area to get enemies to come to me. Blue candles EVERYWHERE."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fddcn8p,t1_fddc1nj,1578305843.0,"Yes and no. More mocking, I think, towards people that legitimately think this. Because, in my experiences, I've had at least six people tell exactly that. That only white people can be racist or something. If a non-white does or says something that could be taken as racist/offensive, then it isn't, just because of their skin color. But if a white person did or said the same thing, it's totally racist or offensive. 
Just what I've seen and been told."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fddb3ze,t1_fddaeug,1578303505.0,Maybe. Erections forever!!
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fddb33q,t1_fdda4qt,1578303467.0,"No, the other example isn't offensive or racist. It's only offense or racist when a white person does something."

Terraria,fdctves,t3_ekolg4,1578284167.0,Played it way too much and now I'm burnt out on it. Not enough variety like Terraria. Terraria keeps me coming back even on vanilla.
