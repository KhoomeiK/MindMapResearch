iamatotalpieceofshit,ffgdj9x,t1_fffabdj,1579903838.0,"Funny how shit can go down in my country and it’s surrounding countries (UK) and no one happens to get shot. Crime is happening, but police brutality is low because our cops aren’t usually packing heat. And neither are our citizens. Don’t try and justify the shooting of a teenager doing something illegal. It’s never justified. That’s what prison/juvy is for. The system in America just doesn’t work. “Oh they were so doing something illegal so I shot them.” You shoplift? You get shot. You smoke some weed? You get shot. You hold a toy truck as a handicapped individual? You get shot. The whole system is a shit show."

Sounds like you’re projecting to me. Sorry about your marriage tho."
Art,ff6x3wo,t1_ff69mbm,1579636684.0,Your comment doesn’t make any sense.

If you don’t... would you? 

Consider my comment a pre order."
Lolita,ff2gl0v,t1_ff2fnrf,1579505234.0,Ooh vintage. I like it!
fatlogic,ff2bqit,t3_er6wz7,1579499915.0,They really love the word “nourish” huh.
GetMotivated,ff296c6,t1_ff1sovo,1579497499.0,"Have you ever considered doing a degree at an open university (or equivalent) in your country? Mechanical engineers are in great demand, and always will be. With an open university degree you do a lot of your work from home, and it’s very flexible. The open university specifically is a UK thing, but there must be other options in other countries too. Even if that isn’t your bag, there’s lots of other options for trying new things. I hope you find what you need in life friend!"
Lolita,ff0zusl,t3_er25hk,1579473871.0,"I think brown would be a perfect combination colour for this. It gives me really classic, elegant vibes for sure. A lovely brown bag and matching shoes would be perfect. I’d actually really love shiny brown brogues/oxfords with this. Easily acquired, perfectly matched with a purse. Easy peasy. This dress is darling too, but OPs are ALWAYS harder to coordinate."
Lolita,fezsybw,t3_eqyjjx,1579461250.0,"In reality...? It actually depends who you ask. Veteran lolias can really go one of either way, either it’s “no fish nets ever EVER.” OR “only fishnets with veteran lolitas who can coord them well and not make them look tacky” and whether you’re in one or the other category, you can never please everyone. Some people think they’re fine, others would never use them. 

I wouldn’t recommend them for anyone new to lolita. Chances are newer lolitas wont have enough experience to make fishnets not look tacky. They tend to do better in gothic coordinates though, where that “out there” flare is a little more appropriate, but still elegant."
Lolita,fezr9r1,t3_er02mo,1579460644.0,"The community is dead here. Scarily so. As the other commenter says Facebook is your best bet. 

Closet of Frills 

Big Sisters of Lolita Fashion 

Rufflechat 

Lolita updates 

Lolita sewing collective etc. 

For many you will have to answer questions and/or provide proof you wear the fashion (pictures etc.) 

Also, try looking for groups that have your town name and “Lolita community” or something similar in it, you’ll find communities close to you that way. Or you can search rufflechat etc when you join the group to find lolitas near you."
