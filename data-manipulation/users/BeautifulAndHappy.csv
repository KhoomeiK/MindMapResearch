If there's an IT department for a company with 500+ employees and they all need Office, Microsoft has made it a pain in the ass to get the one-time purchase version for a company that size.

You now need to register every one-time purchase Office with an email *and* phone number. The phone number can only be registered with 5 Office serial numbers max. It used to be unlimited uses for a number, then it was 20. I expect it to be changed to 3 soon. It also sends a verification text. An IT department can't contact 500+ employees, get their numbers, and then verify the text they just got *just* to set them up with Office.

Microsoft also doesn't have a ""enterprise bundle"" for 365. It's the same price whether its for personal use or if you need 200+ keys for a company. The prices per month just for Office 365 is hard for an IT department to sell.
