JusticeServed,ff76x97,t1_ff6gmg4,1579642319.0,"The official Killdozer copypasta disagrees with you:

Sit down kids and let me tell you a tale, about a reasonable man driven to do unreasonable things.


Marvin Heemeyer was a man who owned a muffler shop in Granby Colorado. The city council ordained to approve the construction of a concrete factory in the lot across from Marvin's shop. In the process this blocked the only access road to the muffler shop. Marvin petitioned to stop the construction to no avail. Petitioned to construct a new access road, and even bought the heavy machinery to do so himself. Denied.


The concrete factory went up in disregard to the ramifications on Marvin's business. To add insult to injury, the factory construction disconnected the muffler shop from the city sewage lines. An indifferent city government then chose to fine Marvin for this.


His business and livelihood were in ruin. Rather than lie down and die, Marvin chose to fight back. Over the course of a year and a half Marvin secretly outfitted the bulldozer he bought to save his business with three foot thick steel and concrete armor, camera systems guarded with bulletproof glass.


On June 4th 2004 Marvin Heemeyer lowered the armored shell over top of himself, entombing himself inside the Killdozer to make his last stand.


He burst fourth from the walls of his muffler shop and straight into the concrete factory that ruined his business. Over the course of the next several hours Marvin drove his Killdozer through 13 buildings owned by those officials that had wronged him, including the city council building itself.


Swat teams swarmed the dozer, but it proved immune to small arms fire and even explosives. Another piece of heavy machinery was even brought out to fight the Killdozer, but it too fell to the dozers righteous fury.


In the end, Marvin's Killdozer became trapped in one of the buildings it was built to destroy. Marvin chose to take his life, the only life he took that day.


Today we celebrate Killdozer day and Marvin Heemeyer, the last great American folk hero. A man driven to the brink who chose to fight back against an indifferent system.


From notes left behind after his passing: ""I was always willing to be reasonable until I had to be unreasonable. Sometimes reasonable men must do unreasonable things.""

>3. If you get caught committing crimes with your car, your car gets taken and your driving privileges are terminated.

That one is subjective at best. 

If you want to make an argument for gun control, comparing them to cars is a bad example. Traffic laws are pretty uniform throughout the country, but firearm laws vary wildly. What's legal in my state will make me a felon in two of my bordering states that are within a ten minute drive. My driver's license is good in every single state, whereas my conceal carry permit isn't. The firearm I often carry would make me a felon in the next state over, but it's perfectly fine here. Even though my firearm would be legal in one of the bordering states, one of the cities in that state outlaw the ammunition I usually carry. And, by the way, felons can still drive cars and fly planes.

To be a responsible gun owner, you have to know the law in multiple states as well as federal law and keep up on them as they change constantly. Gun owners need to have an intimate knowledge of their firearms and how each individual component is regulated in different places. This is why it's so frustrating, as a gun owner, to watch people that don't understand firearms or the laws surrounding them push for more legislation."

apple,feajlck,t1_fe9lrzt,1578949600.0,"There is practically no benefit to Micro B over USB C. Micro B is a weak connector, prone to damage and breakage, it can't handle the higher voltage, and it wears out quickly. On top of that, the size difference is negligible. 

Micro B is 6.85mm x 1.8mm, whereas USB C is 8.25mm x 2.4mm. So, it's 1.4mm wider and 0.6mm taller. There are very few consumer devices that can't accommodate such a small increase in size."

Damnthatsinteresting,fea1wvr,t1_fe9nh6n,1578943505.0,"Currently, the Earth has around 7.53 billion people. Mark Hamill is the last Jedi, according to Yoda. Since Mark Hamill makes up 0.00000001328% of the Earth's population, we have successfully narrowed down the number of people we could that had from to *just under* 7.53 billion.

We're getting closer."
