bipolar,femgmh7,t3_epunnd,1579254494.0,"Clearly it sounds like you’ve been doing as much as possible to alleviate the anxiety, so kudos to you. You’re taking all the right steps. The only steps left to take are the ones that will take you over the threshold and into the room. I feel this anxiety at every start of term—and almost every other person there does too. The first day, I always show up, out of breath from anxiety/stairs, zero in on the first empty seat, then change my mind and take the next seat I see so I feel less like a charging bull, and then proceed to fumble out my notebook and the correct pen with hands which don’t seem to belong to me. Everyone else does something similar.

Then class starts. All of that disappears. The only thing that will fully send your anxiety into orbit is *not* going to class. I think you’re anxious in part because you don’t know what to expect—so once you go, you’ll know a little more, and the fear will lessen each time. It’s okay to be apprehensive right now. You don’t have to be or look or do anything, except just be there. I don’t know if you’ve recently graduated high school or are entering as an adult, but either way—professors will usually explain the syllabus, answer questions, etc. Essentially the first day will remind you that you’re also a human who probably speaks the same language as them, and you can get a grasp on what to expect.

Something I wish I’d known: the soonest diagnostic evaluation I could get with a psychologist was two months out. Hang in there. But most importantly, if it is a psychologist you see first for diagnosis, go up the chain ahead of time and make an appointment with the psychiatrist (usually they have one in the same network). Though both psychs were with the same group, I still had to call on my own to make an appointment with the psychiatrist after the formal diagnosis. Which meant... another month of waiting. Honestly I was pissed, the whole process can be confusing and it would’ve been great if they’d simply warned me to “plan ahead,” because it’s quite frustrating to finally be slapped with such a diagnosis and then have to sit around for a month waiting for real life to start."

Joking aside, I definitely understand your qualms if it’s a smaller party. In that case, if it’s more of a gathering-type thing, rest assured that there will be enough people talking that if you even only contribute occasionally, you’ll still fit right in. The only “incorrect” thing you can do is to stop talking—then you’ll start to feel awkward, and be less and less likely to find your groove. And if it’s an “in-between” size party, my bet is everyone else is feeling just a little weird too. Maybe that’s an interesting conversation-starter right there, and definitely you’d have the green light to initiate deeper conversations too.

Other tips:

- sport a conversation-starting accoutrement 
- if you don’t feel you’re hitting it off with someone much, just exit the conversation. Seriously, it’s okay. 
- I like to retreat to the bathroom often.
- drink water, try to convince yourself it’s alcohol. Sometimes that helps me feel a little looser without the drunk disadvantage 
- if there’s dancing, but you feel inhibited, close your eyes while dancing. Just try not to flail too much. 
- If it’s a house party and you seek deeper conversation, I usually gravitate toward bookshelves etc. Once, I went to a party where there were those refrigerator magnet words. I spent most of that night playing with the words and having various fascinating conversations with other wandering people who joined me.

infp,fclhxws,t3_ehse0a,1577748206.0,"Love you guys. I always feel seen by ENFPs. One of the most beautiful relationships I’ve been in was with an ENFP, and she felt like home. She was so hospitable and generous—she had this light and a knack for finding the people who need it most. Also, we were both weirdos and each did silly things that the other found utterly hilarious, when we were just being ourselves. 

On the negative side, it was such a whirlwind at times. She constantly wanted to be with me, and when I needed space, she was, er, less understanding, so when I did get my space, it was tinged with guilt. We were in our early 20s though, so neither of us had yet learned how to be in a more mature relationship with clear boundaries. 

Maybe the most “INFP” thing I can say about that relationship was that at times I fretted I was preventing her light from reaching everyone it needed to. I feared I was dimming her. 

You said you’ve dated several INFPs—as an ENFP, what issues often arose between you/are there any common threads?"

AskReddit,fcd23bh,t3_eh2ttm,1577605403.0,"A good way to both help her stay active and spend quality time might be to get one of those “mother-daughter” journals. I know it’s a bit cheesy, but some of the questions are very thoughtful, and it’s something you can do together, without sapping much energy. Personally, I’ve only lost grandparents, but have always wished I knew so much more about them—one granny in particular loved birds, and us cousins keep discussing bird tattoos, but damnit if none of us know what her favorite bird was. I kick myself most for having not known the right questions to ask. Maybe one of these journals can also remind you of other questions you want to ask your mom, too.

Also, we were both weirdos and each did silly things that the other found utterly hilarious, when we were just being ourselves. 

On the negative side, it was such a whirlwind at times. She constantly wanted to be with me, and when I needed space, she was, er, less understanding, so when I did get my space, it was tinged with guilt. We were in our early 20s though, so neither of us had yet learned how to be in a more mature relationship with clear boundaries. 

Maybe the most â€œINFPâ€ thing I can say about that relationship was that at times I fretted I was preventing her light from reaching everyone it needed to. I feared I was dimming her. 

You said youâ€™ve dated several INFPsâ€”as an ENFP, what issues often arose between you/are there any common threads?"

Also, we played in the woods almost every dayâ€”besides flicking many a tick off a neighbor kid/myself, my favorite story has gotta be when this one kid yelled, â€œI gotta poop!â€ He immediately scooped up a handful of rabbit turds and then dropped them down the leg of his shorts."
AskReddit,fcd23bh,t3_eh2ttm,1577605403.0,"A good way to both help her stay active and spend quality time might be to get one of those â€œmother-daughterâ€ journals. I know itâ€™s a bit cheesy, but some of the questions are very thoughtful, and itâ€™s something you can do together, without sapping much energy. Personally, Iâ€™ve only lost grandparents, but have always wished I knew so much more about themâ€”one granny in particular loved birds, and us cousins keep discussing bird tattoos, but damnit if none of us know what her favorite bird was. I kick myself most for having not known the right questions to ask. Maybe one of these journals can also remind you of other questions you want to ask your mom, too.

(If youâ€™re in the US, you can find them in Barnes & Noble or likely anywhere online too) 

Anyway, all the best to you and your family. I wish you well."

Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s necessarily incorrect, at least as a statement alone. Just providing another reason why some viewpoints seem to skew a certain way."

science,fcaxzfd,t1_fcasnvj,1577578832.0,"I think this thought has some merit in the western world, though I suspect the op commenter was referring to other countries. In the US, Iâ€™ve met a lot of heterosexual men who say, â€œI understand why women are gay, because I find women attractive, but not how a man can be attracted to another man.â€ And the men who make those comments never face repercussions from saying that aloud, so that sentiment is often loudest."

I mean, probably not, since swarming grasshoppers havenâ€™t affected the US for awhileâ€”unless you saw Mormon crickets. But, fun facts! Some species of grasshoppers become â€œgregarious swarmers.â€ You may have been witnessing the beginnings of a plague of locusts. Itâ€™s thought that vegetative growth following a drought affects grasshoppersâ€™ serotonin, which then transforms them into locusts. They start breeding rabidly and consuming everything in sight. Including each other, like a sort of cannibalist leapfrogâ€”in the attempt to avoid being eaten, and to eat the next fella.

Everything was beefy because the range between â€œtoo muchâ€ and â€œnot enoughâ€ was so large. Nowadays theyâ€™ve streamlined the process and have calculations down to their decimal places, which has resulted in products that will simply never outlast the over-engineered ones."
