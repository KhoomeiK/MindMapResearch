Conservative,ffcs19u,t1_ffbd647,1579806077.0,"In Honduras they have Pulperias everywhere. A Pulperia is a small convenience store type thing people run out of the front of their house that sells small things like chips, soda, water, and other things like that. They're everywhere. They don't typically make too much money, but enough to scrape by. I personally met 4 people that ran pulperias that were killed by the gangs because they couldn't pay the ""protection tax"". One lady called the cops on the gangsters, and the cops in turn called the gangsters. The lady was dead by the end of the day, and in a pretty brutal way. I've met others who bought houses only to have the gangsters show up and say ""this is ours now, what are you going to do about it?"" And the thing is, if you dare defy them, they'll come after you and your family. Of you ask me, Honduras should take a Duterte approach and put down know gang members and violent criminals. I myself was stuck up in broad daylight, I managed to get the gun away from the assailant and the cops got him, but he only spent the night in jail and was released the next day or so.

Conservative,ffb3yji,t1_ffagse9,1579751175.0,"For real though, Honduras is a really rough place to live. I lived there for 2 years as a missionary, where I talked to thousands of people in the streets and in their homes in several different areas of the country. First and foremost, the threat of being murdered is a constant for a large majority of people. The gang activity is high and violent crimes are commonplace. Secondly, finding work is very difficult, and this makes people feel desperate. Many youth join gangs because of the terrible economic situation in the country, exacerbating the first issue. Third, government corruption abounds, from the President down to many of the cops on the street corners. These problems are all intertwined and contribute to the country being hell to live in for people that are from there. I saw a lot of things and heard a ton of stories that drove these points home to me. Extortion, armed robbery, corruption, and things of this nature drive people to seek a better life elsewhere. I don't think the answer is coming to the US, but I definitely know where they're coming from and I can't say I blame them.
