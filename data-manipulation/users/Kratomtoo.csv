kratom,fdcezjv,t1_fdc86k5,1578273265.0,I typically have 3-4 kilos of 7/8 different strains at any given time & alternate strains throughout the day
kratom,fdcestg,t3_ekibvm,1578273139.0,I think having a sky high opioid tolerance affects how Kratom will affect you. I was on fentanyl for 11 yrs at hi doses so no surprise that when I started Kratom I needed much higher doses. I have chronic pain. I use up to 100gpd. That‚Äôs way too much & I wanna taper down but I‚Äôve been at this dose for 2 yrs with no ill effects. My labs are always perfect. If you‚Äôre not opiate tolerant u can get by on much smaller doses less frequently. I typically use 10-12 grams per dose every 2-3 hours
kratom,fdce1d9,t3_ekijhs,1578272610.0,I‚Äôve been a heavy user of Kratom for 2 yrs. up to 100 gpd. My labs are perfect-everything
lonely,fcuuwwa,t1_fcui3on,1577989030.0,Yes I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs bad news
ForeverAlone,fcsirjn,t1_fbzfzu7,1577917289.0,Well im married 33 yrs & have been lonely for most of it.
ForeverAlone,fcsidbk,t1_fcanc52,1577917073.0,Well why not go for a short lady? There‚Äôs so many that are 5‚Äô nothing. I know some. They‚Äôre not looking for 6‚Äô guys
ForeverAlone,fcshtua,t1_fcaad24,1577916792.0,Well I‚Äôm tall & very good looking & have been married to an abusive prick for 33 yrs. so tired of everyone‚Äôs thinking that if only you‚Äôre so attractive you‚Äôre set. Not true
ForeverAlone,fcshhak,t3_ei2o0n,1577916629.0,I‚Äôm seeing a common theme here. If you‚Äôre not a couple then you‚Äôre lonely. Mayb these people r young. I‚Äôm 60 & married & have been lonely the entire marriage. New Year‚Äôs Eve I‚Äôm always alone which is how every nite is so it dusnt bother me more than any other time. I‚Äôm more accepting of it now that I‚Äôm older. If I were starting over I‚Äôd get on every dating site & put myself out there. U can really narrow things down to specifics to find a partner you‚Äôre at least somewhat compatible with
ForeverAlone,fcsgwny,t1_fcojzl3,1577916362.0,Me too. Sleep is my fallback
lonely,fcoksnh,t1_fcmfcbi,1577834732.0,Leaving an abusive husband of 33 yrs hopefully. I‚Äôd like to move in with daughter (41) & her kid but she‚Äôs not open to it.
unpopularopinion,fcm02vp,t3_ehwdhn,1577760736.0,I always give my dogs a high quality fresh refrigerated dog food that they love & in several flavors. I feel sorry for dogs who are fed the cheap crap or the same dry food every day üôÅ
unpopularopinion,fclzlo2,t3_ehwhqo,1577760390.0,Hot tea & Iced tea are the bomb
lonely,fclz9ir,t1_fcjfp2b,1577760143.0,When I leave I‚Äôll b able to connect with other lonely people. I think most elderly who are alone move in with their kids but mine doesn‚Äôt want thatüòüunfortunately
abusiverelationships,fclz190,t3_ehrzh4,1577759977.0,I so badly want out but can‚Äôt due to finances so I‚Äôm waiting for social security in 2 yrs. I wanted to ask women how they manage financially to get out? I didn‚Äôt work so have nothing to fall back on & am in poor health. I‚Äôm sure there are older women like me in this boat.
SuicideWatch,fclynty,t1_fckpoe2,1577759704.0,Ooops posted above
SuicideWatch,fclym2g,t3_eema98,1577759668.0,Hi thanks for the kindness. I‚Äôm not eligible for ss disability cuz I haven‚Äôt worked in 27 yrs. when I‚Äôm 62 in 2 yrs I‚Äôm gonna get social security & live in lo cost senior housing. My pos husband has to give me half his income & pension at the time of divorce so I will have to watch it but cud then move the hell out. It‚Äôs a living hell being under the same roof & enduring his stone cold silence & dirty looks
lonely,fcj68sm,t1_fcdlt1b,1577678294.0,Let‚Äôs hope but I‚Äôm 60 now lol

lonely,fcav8o9,t1_fc9ijkl,1577577281.0,Me too. It‚Äôs just another day. Estranged husband never was interested in holidays or anything else for that matter. I‚Äôm relieved when the days pass by
abusiverelationships,fc5dsot,t1_fc5dhg2,1577454553.0,Thank you so much
KratomKorner,fc50ibu,t1_fc4ljtw,1577436826.0,About every 2 hrs unfortunately
abusiverelationships,fc3mk3w,t3_efzbew,1577393280.0,I‚Äôm just holding on by my fingernails too. I have no way out but I keep avoiding him 100%. I stay in my room. He‚Äôs pure evil & I can‚Äôt let him keep abusing me like this. I pray for strength. It‚Äôs a living hell here
IncelsWithoutHate,fc35rh1,t1_fc2jnl3,1577382120.0,Honestly after all these years it boils down to him being asexual & part of me thinks he enjoys hurting me a great deal. Our marriage is dead & has been for years. I‚Äôve suffered badly from the rejection & trying to fix him. Btw his hormones were tested & were normal. He was never sexually assaulted. He doesn‚Äôt view pornography. He doesn‚Äôt look at women & he‚Äôs not gay. He just doesn‚Äôt care & enjoys the hurt he‚Äôs caused. Stupid me for not leaving & not seeing someone else. It‚Äôs been a total kick in the ass
IncelsWithoutHate,fc278qh,t1_fb6ol5t,1577343641.0,My life has sucked from birth & im very attractive. My husband hasn‚Äôt touched me in over 8 years & we‚Äôve been married 33 yrs. at most we had sex a handful of times in 33 yrs. I‚Äôm counting the times he initiated. I initiated all the time only to b rejected. I‚Äôm not sure what an incel is or black pills but sex isn‚Äôt just lacking in people who are unattractive. There are many people like me in sexless marriages & relationships who r good looking nonetheless. I know of many including mine.
lonely,fc25xs4,t1_fc02n13,1577341868.0,That‚Äôs a good point about feeling safe in our shell. I‚Äôm in a bad marriage & can‚Äôt get out right now but I have made my room into a wonderful sanctuary. It‚Äôs beautiful & comfortable & has soothing colors & soft bedding & my own big screen tv so I can still watch tv when he is in the living room & I can‚Äôt b around him. The lighting is soft & soothing. Thankfully I have my own bathroom too. Yes I do isolate myself because of this abusive man but it could b worse. At least I‚Äôm very comfortable . There‚Äôs no physical abuse & we stay on our own sides of the house. After 33 yrs it‚Äôs come down to this for survival sake. He‚Äôs not interested in fixing anything so I try to do nice things for myself. I eat well & spend a lot of time reading & sleeping. This is what has to b for now.
kratom,fc256z6,t3_efgg3p,1577340920.0,"What a great story! I too got started on opiates young after a botched c section at just 17 yrs old. The complications that followed got the ball rolling. At first darvocet, Vicodin & worse. More health problems developed with age & of course more pills. I was on pills for 4 decades. I finally found Kratom 2 yrs ago & never looked back. I needed pain relief & have it without pharmaceuticals. No more dealing with drs. No more feeling like an addict. I‚Äôm dependent on Kratom but I know if I want to taper down I can by reading all the posts here. To be off prescription meds is a god send."
depression,fc1i2mk,t1_fc0fmgd,1577319422.0,And the colors r soft & comforting
depression,fc1hz9y,t3_efhdh9,1577319341.0,You have an eye for color & it‚Äôs happy & uplifting to look at the art. I‚Äôm impressed though not an artist myself I can see it‚Äôs good
abusiverelationships,fbzbk9i,t1_fbzb87h,1577241247.0,Oh I can imagine how peaceful it wud b alone. Even tho he does the silent treatment & stonewalling I can feel the hate &!rage from him. Occasionally if I do have to ask him about transactional stuff he will absolutely find a way to start a fight or at the very least treat me badly like I‚Äôm a piece of garbage. If I had the funds I know I‚Äôd b happy getting away from him. My life wud b so different. I gotta just keep trying to find ways out
abusiverelationships,fbzar9h,t1_fbza2j0,1577240488.0,Oops I posted in wrong place. See above. Newish here
abusiverelationships,fbzapat,t3_ef9na9,1577240436.0,Thanks so much for that really. I‚Äôll keep it all in mind. Yeah I lose more & more of myself every day. Did u get away & how did u do it?
OpiatesRecovery,fbzagem,t1_fbz44xq,1577240209.0,Ask for jean if u go to Detroit. I‚Äôve never experienced so much kindness & support as RDD in Detroit. That‚Äôs rapid drug detox. They put u under then flush your system with I think naloxone & propofal  or similar drug & anesthetics & benzos. When u wake up 30 min after you‚Äôre done & just extremely exhausted. Not a shred of withdrawal. None! I was a new person. They should b screaming this from the rooftops. It was the best thing I ever did
abusiverelationships,fbz9q59,t1_fbz97y5,1577239531.0,"They won‚Äôt take me cuz I‚Äôm not battered. He stopped physical abuse 6 yrs ago when I threatened to call the police. He threw hot coffee in my face & I inhaled it. It was awful. There‚Äôs been sooo much abuse like that-pushed me down stairs, kicked me,  but at least that stuff stopped. But the verbal & mental abuse goes on. The only reason I haven‚Äôt left is financial. I‚Äôm gonna try to find things to do to distract me more & get out of the house. I‚Äôm going back to church too. I‚Äôve tried hard to find counseling but no luck. I have an $8500 deductible & nobody was Available for new patients. I live in the boonies. I just have to get stronger so that what he does isn‚Äôt as gut wrenching as it is. Many women wud just move forward but I‚Äôm broken."
abusiverelationships,fbz8ygn,t3_ef9na9,1577238822.0,"Same here. No decorations, when I asked if I cud hang up some garland I made he called me a cunt & refused. No dinner, no gifts, there won‚Äôt b any sign of Xmas here. Last week was my birthday. He went to visit relatives. I was alone & cried. I got nothing. No card no gift nothing. I knew as hateful and abusive as he is to me the rest of the year, that these days wud b no different. My family is thousands of miles away & honestly r sick & tired of telling me to leave him after all these years of hell. I wasted my life on a man who can‚Äôt love & is an abusive narcissist. Trouble is after 33 yrs of it & my health  problems I can‚Äôt get away. Theres not enough $ for 2 households. I can‚Äôt work so the best I can do is try to live a life under the same roof as my abuser. He refuses to talk to me & we live totally separate lives. He does whatever he wants & without me. He‚Äôs an empty shell. There were red flags all over in the beginning but I figured I cud fix things. Stupid. It got worse & worse. I want to tell those lucky enough to have loved ones & partners that love them to hang on tight & don‚Äôt take anything for granted. Please realize u are blessed & things cud b very different. It‚Äôs too late for me."
SuicideWatch,fbwx43y,t3_eema98,1577161797.0,Please don‚Äôt do anything rash like throwing yourself in front of a truck because there‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôll work & not end up worse off. I think we ought to b able to see a dr & get the same suicide drugs they use for euthanasia in Oregon & a few other places. It‚Äôs our right to live so our right to die if we need to. I‚Äôve actually looked into getting the meds but they‚Äôre in China & illegally getting them means prison. In Switzerland u can get the drug even if you‚Äôre not terminally ill. If u have life long depression. I guess they‚Äôre more progressive there
kratom,fbwwecg,t1_fburmpp,1577161246.0,Me too seriously 2 toilets. Plumber knows us too well. It clogged the sewer pipe. So embarrassing. If I take 2 laxatives every day it‚Äôs better but not great. I‚Äôm a very heavy user tho.
SuicideWatch,fbwv7ky,t1_fbwuavi,1577160318.0,I‚Äôm sorry depression is such a burden on your life. Mine too for years. But now it‚Äôs a million times worse cuz I‚Äôm married to a very abusive man. I‚Äôm struggling to cope. We‚Äôve been married 33 yrs but it went from bad to worse a yr ago. He dusnt wanna work on anything. He lives his life & dusnt talk to me. It‚Äôs very lonely. We have to live under the same roof cuz there‚Äôs not enough $ for 2 households. I‚Äôm disabled w rheumatoid arthritis & diabetes so I can‚Äôt work. Not eligible for disability. It‚Äôs hell here. I‚Äôm so depressed that I live this way & the man I gave my life to is a stone cold prick & just threw me away. He sed I can live here & stay on my side of the house but he wants nothing to do with me.
SuicideWatch,fbwtjff,t3_eema98,1577159036.0,How is your husband treating u? What does he say?
SuicideWatch,fbwsm4t,t1_fbwrui5,1577158343.0,Same here. Wish I had what I need to make it happen
