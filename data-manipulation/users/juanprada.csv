So, in a sense, NMS, (what it is right now) it's not what it was supposed to be (what drew us in in the first place) even with all its updates and additions, and that's a shame."

Los salarios usualmente son bastante competitivos, así que no tendrías ningún problema en pagar un arriendo.

incubus,fcvwyu2,t1_fcvg4yt,1578011989.0,"You don't sound like a dick, so don't worry! You see, I've been an Incubus fan since 2001. I was 13 years old back then. They quickly became my favorite band; I was pretty much obsessed with them. Used to listen to their whole discography every day after school. I barely paid attention to other bands.


When Crow came out, a cousin of mine bought the album for me. She told me the store staff had to open a box to get the cd because it wasn't even on the shelves. When Red Rocks came out, I watched it every night for months. I finally saw them live for the first time in 2005, when they were everything to me.


I bet that you can tell by now how important they were for me and how close to my heart they are. Even if their subsequent releases were not what I expected, I keep following them because I'm always hoping their next album or song will blow my mind, like The Warmth, Under My Umbrella, Pistola or The Odyssey, just to name a few examples. I will always give them a chance. 


I've learned with time that being a ""true fan"" of a band doesn't mean you have to enjoy everything they put out. It's more about the journey you've had with them. And every journey has ups and downs. They've given me so much; I have to keep going until the end."
incubus,fcup53i,t1_fcuooie,1577985695.0,"So so, I must say. For me, their last great album was Crow (I still believe it's their best work). There are songs from INNW and 8 that I like, and I thought the Trust Fall EP was cool, but that's about it."
