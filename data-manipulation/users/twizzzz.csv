Anticonsumption,ffztxwz,t1_ffzl0id,1580392789.0,"It's also difficult with tech changing so rapidly, and with how tightly crammed phones are with hardware it can be a huge engineering challenge to make a seemingly simple upgrade.

One could argue that the ""must have latest-and-greatest"" culture needs to change, but treating phones like heirlooms and allowing for upgrades is obstacle of engineering (or profitablity) that no one has figured out yet. Google did try (or at least thought about) doing this with ""Project Ara"", but they apparently abandoned that idea."

WritingPrompts,ffumzx2,t1_ffuhq1v,1580245383.0,"No. I'm saying the story completely flipped what the prompt implied. Also, to clarify, when I say ""hellish"", I mean hellish for some people. I'm not implying modern democracies are bad, just that they are far from perfect and cause a lot of suffering regardless of how much better they are than alternative forms of government.

Most obviously, this story pointed out the suffering of refugees and the homeless. I'm not making any political point, but it's simply a fact that those are groups of people who have difficult lives in most modern democracies.

It actually takes it to another level when you think about the lady that's angry at the angel because her relatives are refugees that weren't allowed in. There's a lot of ways you could interpret that in terms of modern democratic nations.

This author really did a brilliant job."
WritingPrompts,ffudkhr,t1_fftbznr,1580239712.0,"Actually, now that I re-read the prompt, I realize its making even more of point since its meant to represent a developed, modern democracy. Pretty cool that it completely flipped it. The prompt implied that all those things are the antithesis of hell, but this is pointing out how hellish it actually is."
