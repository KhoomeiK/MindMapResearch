socialanxiety,fckgjnz,t1_fckdvuk,1577724837.0,I tried it too but its kind of a shortcut. For long run there are people who always expect you to express yourself and telling how boring you are when you don't.
socialanxiety,fckesbp,t1_fckb69w,1577723716.0,"Whatever you have written here can be my words EXACTLY...

socialanxiety,fck3jl6,t1_fck0x9r,1577715529.0,"I also Wrote to My notes on Friday that :-

What we Say or how we say depends upon what we Think or how we Think.

I should not think me as Loser.

socialanxiety,fcjppa7,t1_fcjp2oh,1577698378.0,"I also want to know what is more preferable
1. Being good at your skill (like i am a programmer).
2. Or something other than your profesional skill."

socialanxiety,fcji7j4,t3_eh4bkf,1577688563.0,"I also get this habit while getting too many interviews calls to not pick up phones and just wait, even when my friends call me I am too afraid to pick up the phone because I don't know why I feel like after talking that what rubbish I was talking about and what he or she must be thinking about me. Just One conversation right in a day makes my day like me a high really."
NoFap,f49ita2,t3_djw9dw,1571468406.0,I was also like this trapped in never Ending Cycles of Habits. You should try doing Dopamine Fast. Filling your mind continuously with Information doesn't allow you to think with clarity. It's not easy but it pays off.
