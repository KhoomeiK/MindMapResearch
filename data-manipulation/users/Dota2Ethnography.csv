A good work of history will always try to complicate all the stories and show the nuances and intricacies. It will display the perspective of ""the enemy"", their perspectives, motives and reasons they acted like they did... Doing this takes time and content.

If people actually think the internet can substitute a good education in history you will end up with bias and a black-and-white understanding of history and today's world."

You sure must be old and wise if you've managed to live in all these places long enough to be able to explain the complexities of each country, lol. Especially as these are places with topics (Islam/Communism) that you have very strong opinions on...

>Easy, ones in a museum that spends millions on their preservation, the other ends up in a back alley market. Please do tell m which contributes more to preservation.

Who do you think purchased the items? If you actually cared to read my link you would know that European aristocrats became the driving factor behind the market for tomb looting.

>The practice of taking artifacts and mummies was in place before the Europeans arrived, but of course even when they do something bad it's the Europeans fault.

""Just because they've *always* done it it's no issue when we make it even worse lol""

>Obviously no archeological expedition just turns up without local knowledge, good of you to omit that happens for every dig done properly everywhere,but that would have made your point moot. And it's not like the workers were hired or anything, I'm sure the Europeans just turned up with whips and drove the poor Egyptians into the desert like slaves

What a fucking strawman.

Of fucking course every dig is conducted with the assitance of the local population. This isn't even close to being an exception for Egypt, why do you act as if this was some sort of counterargument?

And what the fuck is the relevance of the way the workers were employed...? Why do you even bring this up lol.

>Get a real argument that isn't predicated on ""European bad, you a bigot""

As if this was my fucking argument you illiterate troglodyte.

>born in Pakistan, guess I didn't spend 20 years of my life in the middle East

As if this is more relevant than your opinions: you can still be extremely bias against your native culture. I wouldn't care to listen to ethnology professor if he was a Nazi or any form of cultural essentialist (like Islamophobia). 

And since you had no clue about Medieval Arabic interest in Egypt but spouted European discourse on Arabic history I can't even assume you have any proper insights into the subject you're discussing.

HistoryMemes,ff664s0,t1_ff65chm,1579620052.0,"Not necessarily. I think seeing the interaction between people and their cultural history is the actual way to view the artifacts as that's their natural context. It makes them far more interesting!

When we take something from a site and put it in a sanitized museum the item gets displaced from its context (same thing happens when tomb items gets stolen). It's good as it preserves the item, but I think museums can't reconstruct the way items are supposed to be experienced. Mummies are most interesting when they're in a tomb, right? Not behind sheets of glass.

I know about U335 because someone fucking put it in a church wall, but I can't remember any other runestones that dot the landscape. It makes the artifact unique and memorable."
