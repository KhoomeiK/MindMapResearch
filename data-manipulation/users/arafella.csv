At a quantum level, there are particle/antiparticle pairs that spontaneously pop into existence throughout the universe. Normally these particle/antiparticle pairs cancel each other out almost instantly. When these pairs form near the event horizon of a black hole, either the particle or antiparticle can be trapped behind the event horizon while the other escapes the boundary.
