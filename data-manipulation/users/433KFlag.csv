aww,ffikvd9,t3_etqqod,1579976302.0,Thank you for your tough love! I had a cat that would sneak and steal plastic bags to eat and one day his colon got so impacted that the vet couldn’t save him.  He was only 3.  I miss him every day.
MultipleSclerosis,ffikmtt,t1_ffia3wg,1579976138.0,"Wonderful post! Anti-inflammatory diets (low carbs/ sugar, high raw foods) help everyone!  The key is to find something that doesn’t make you feel like you are giving up ONE MORE THING due to MS."
MultipleSclerosis,ffeez02,t3_et2bic,1579845482.0,"I was diagnosed in 2005. I weighed 230 at 5’5”.  Always obese. Didn’t have any symptoms that prevented me from exercise, I was just lazy.  In 2012 I decided to take my doctor’s advice and try to minimize potential health issues outside of MS.  Went to a nutritionist who changed my food lifestyle.  A combo of keto and paleo.  Raw fruits and vegetables.  No soy, no sugar, no dairy, no legumes.  I also started training with my local roller derby.  2 nights a week of nonstop roller skating for 2-3 hours per night.  In 2015 I progressed from RRMS to SPMS.  I had lost about 90 lbs.  and then I could no longer stand up on roller skates. I currently use a rollator to walk.  But I have a recumbent exercise bike and ride it at least 10 miles each day Monday through Friday.  I’ve gained about 20 pounds since I was at my lowest, but am currently stable at this weight and have been for last 3 years.  The thing that I think helps most is weight training/resistance training.  No matter how little I can lift or do, I do it!"

Knoxville,fe31iop,t1_fe3019w,1578845038.0,"Yeah, when you are looking for a place to move to, it is very important to weigh your utility needs.  I’m from Knoxville and Comcast definitely has a lock there.  Three years ago my family moved to Seattle and instead of looking at utility availability in the city we had to drill down to specific neighborhoods!"
Knoxville,fe2y9i8,t3_enmifv,1578844181.0,I would look into Chattanooga if only for their internet infrastructure.  They also have nice museums and stuff!

depression,fdyurxf,t3_endrue,1578783808.0,I don’t think you should blame yourself at all.  It is the parent’s responsibility to take care of the children.  I hope you can get out of your home situation and become the person you want to be.
MultipleSclerosis,fdpy32p,t3_emm3n6,1578645463.0,"45 yo here, and I’ve learned that MS is often embarrassing, but doctors can treat most of our symptoms to some extent.  If we can’t be open and honest with our docs then we are only hurting ourselves!"
tattoos,fdpxk0j,t1_fdptyh4,1578644762.0,"Very cool!  I think it is important to get a meaningful tat since it will be with you forever!  Anchors are classic tat material, so having a hidden in plain sight anchor is kind of subversive!"

MultipleSclerosis,fdo6gdf,t3_emdpth,1578599716.0,You will get used to a “new normal” and it will be always changing and decidedly abnormal!  But you WILL get used to it!  Been riding this bull 15 years and still holding on!  Good luck to you!
IAmA,fdnolkt,t1_fdnniti,1578590009.0,My stepdaughter has had a therapist for several years because we knew she needed someone to help her deal without a dog in the fight!  Wish we knew of offerings like yours way back!
IAmA,fdnn3p7,t3_emb3u8,1578589233.0,"Thank you for this!  My stepdaughter is a teenager now and her parents have never been able to co-parent in what I think is a healthy way for her.  Her mother won’t even speak directly to my husband.  It has been 15 years, is there a time when you think the idea of co-parenting no longer makes sense due to a litiginous relationship?"
Knoxville,fdkscks,t3_elvau2,1578510142.0,"My MIL is an avid miniaturist.  She owns over 40 dollhouses, most of which she built from scratch.  She designs and decorated her creations.  Her father worked with wood and she is a chip off the old block!"
MultipleSclerosis,fdknsy2,t1_fdk9dff,1578507428.0,"Even if HE won’t go to MS support group, YOU should go.  You need support to deal with this too!  I think I am a lot like your husband, because I want to help, but I require detailed instructions on how to do everything (even the stuff it seems like should be common sense).  It is just easier for me and sometimes seems better if I just keep to myself and only do the things that don’t require any input from anyone else.  Like watch TV.  It is frustrating to me to have to rely on others, but at least I can bathe and brush my teeth and hair by myself."
MultipleSclerosis,fdjkfeu,t3_elg0sp,1578475035.0,"I have an exercise bike in my home and ride at least 10 miles a day Monday through Friday.  If your husband can ride a regular bicycle (or if he cando a recumbent bike or evening a trike) he can take part in various Bike MS events sponsored by NMSS.  Not quite the same as running a marathon, but it has the same sense of camaraderie."
MultipleSclerosis,fdjk2as,t3_eliai2,1578474509.0,"I think you would benefit from some support.  Everywhere I have been there have been support groups for MS caregivers.  I also think that it might help if you made lists of things for your husband to do while you are at work.  If you make detailed lists of the things he should do, it may help him feel like he can contribute to your household while also giving him the instructions about how to complete his tasks.  If he has a written list and chooses not to help out then I agree with other posters that it might be best to let him go so his mommy can take care of him."
AskReddit,fdj6wtx,t3_elbejj,1578460149.0,"My mom always used to tell me that I “was cutting off my nose to spite my face”.

Did that mean I’m ugly?   I know what it is supposed to mean, but what does it actually mean?"

MultipleSclerosis,fdfq09f,t3_el2r8n,1578367440.0,"I have also experienced crippling fatigue. My husband said that I was having to nap about a third of my life away. It would be so bad that I physically could not even hold my eyes open.  About 7 years ago my neurologist prescribed me provigil which was a life saver...then insurance quit covering it and I switched to Nuvigil another wonder drug...then insurance quit covering all brand name drugs so I switched to armodafinil which also worked very well...until insurance quit covering it.  This lead to 5 years of almost daily napping and NEVER being awake after 9pm.  In November of last year I got new insurance which would cover anti-fatigue drugs, and have since gotten back on generic Provigil (modafinil), and feel like I’ve gotten my life back!  Well aside from the other MS stuff!  Fatigue is probably a 2 on a scale of 1-10 now.  Talk to your doctor.  YMMV."

MultipleSclerosis,fcxzjx2,t3_ej54ag,1578072648.0,"Yes, this is spasticity!  Mine is worse in my left leg.  The itching is something different.  It is a neuropathy. I get it in my legs, at my arm joints, on my head.  Standing up/walking around does seem to help, but I also take baclofen at night to combat it."
MultipleSclerosis,fcven28,t3_ej3h6p,1578000500.0,I am in a clinical trial for high dose biotin.  I am taking high doses of biotin right now.  I can’t tell anything is happening.  I did think though that primary progressive MS doesn’t really have relapses.  I’ve had MS for 15 years and learn something new all the time!
