When I said the man gave zero fucks . . . . No joke there.  *Zero fucks*.  That's just how the old man rolled.  He never asked for advice and once he made his mind up, it was made."

They were fucking awesome years.  The old man was - as Hunter Thompson would say - one of God's own prototypes. Some kind of high powered mutant never even considered for mass production.

Thank you for your very kind comment.  It gave me the the opportunity to look back and remember lots of things.  Gramps was a hellraiser and a womanizer, but also hilarious and very charming.  He always had a joke or a funny story, and was very good to me."

Shamanism,fem0rad,t1_f8fk55r,1579236057.0,"Ding ding !  Mental health worker here for ten years.  For some reason  , people really buy into this concept of the 'psychotic mystic'.  In ten years of working in lockdown facilities, I've run into plenty of patients who claimed to be able to talk to God or to spirits.  None of them made any sense, none of them were rational, and none of them could provide any proof. They were all just mentally ill.

On the other hand, I've met a number of people who saw spirits or could communicate with supernatural entities, and I completely believed them.  Interestingly, none of those people were irrational, psychotic, or in lockdown facilities.

Sometimes mental illness is just that, unfortunately."

You'd park, go into the terminal, get your boarding pass, and go through security, which was much much faster.  Also - people could go with you all the way to the gate.  Planes also seemed less full then.  Now you get on a plane and it's like you're packed into a can of fucking sardines."
