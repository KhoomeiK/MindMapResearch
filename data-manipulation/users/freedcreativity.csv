Remember that time they didn't say the word 'torture' about waterboarding? Or their support for the Iraq war? Or their worse than CNN coverage of any Israel topic? Or their love of conservative think tanks? Or their use of direct Pentagon pressers as war coverage?

NPR has nice coverage of US domestic politics; I listen to them. But they are objectively bad if you want government critical coverage. Are they better than Faux news? Infinitely better.

It's crazy Pompeo would do this to NPR is what I'm saying."

That Pompeo didn't get a full sheet of the questions before the interview and that his aides didn't have answers prepared for him is astonishing. Or he's just that dumb? I have no clue why he'd act out with a veteran NPR journo, who is going to have to dutifully toe the government line."
