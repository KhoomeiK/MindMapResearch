SelfDrivingCars,ffcyg9n,t1_ffcu9bd,1579809865.0,I agree but I think that rollout will take much more time than we expect. At some point there will autonomous trucking on some road without safety drivers. We don’t know if that’s 6 months away or 5-10 years away. Once it’s approved and happening for one road it’s going to take an unknown amount of time to roll out across the USA
SelfDrivingCars,ffccs04,t3_essxwy,1579796658.0,This is awesome but I thought maybe Waymo One was expanding to Texas in the headline. Hopefully they scale up to a new city soon
SelfDrivingCars,ffccm5t,t1_ffc3rzn,1579796558.0,"Probably none. Trucking demand is so high that even if they prove out the use case it will still take a while, only be on these roads and not every company will want or be able to afford to have all their goods shipped autonomously. It’s going to take a long time for this to roll out nationwide.

Another thought is maybe they perfect the highway driving but not the last mile of taking a semi off the highway to its destination in the city. We could see highway semi driving be autonomous with drivers picking up the vehicles at exit ramps"
Columbus,ffc5z50,t1_ffc2lgg,1579792319.0,Go to Europe and you see why people want green spaces and public areas. No one has a yard because of the density in historic cities. In the US outside of maybe NYC and other very dense areas every apartment has its own green space. What houses or apartments in Columbus don’t have yards?

The app is awful and the fact the app where you buy passes doesn’t show anything about routes or if busses are on time is embarrassing. If COTA wants to increase ridership among casual people like myself who don’t need to use it they really need to improve the app and go on a large scale marketing campaign

I’ve talked to many people at work about trying COTA for the first time and none of them have even attempted it. If COTA wants to increase ridership among people like that they need to get the app and make it simple that it only makes sense to use it when going downtown!"
