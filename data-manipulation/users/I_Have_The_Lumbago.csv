metro,fftg2sw,t3_ev4pbc,1580219536.0,Exodus because it's hard to play after you see how good redux is compared to it. Wanted to do a full playthrough of all of em and just couldn't bring myself to do it.

insanepeoplefacebook,fdp3k46,t1_fdn9jco,1578619165.0,"I don't think anybody dying is a bad thing. (Unless you're goddamn Hitler or a genocidal maniac) I know some really nice baby boomers and not all of them are Trump worshippers anyways. My grandma on the other hand, Jesus Christ, she can't understand that,yes, he's a goddamn dumbass. She gets all pissy and mad at me even if I'm her own grandson. If you say it to anyone in my hometown they'll start screaming. I ain't one for politics, but this last election was a sad reminder that families can be ripped apart just because of who they're gonna vote for. I don't like the kind of people who wish harm on one another just for what they believe in. It pisses me the fuck off. It makes me lose hope in humanity. What pisses me off even more is when people insult people's daughters and wives. My grandma posts shit like ""Michelle looks like a monkey"". THIS MAKES MY BOIL.
Well anyway sorry for the rant I think people can still be friends no matter what kind of thing they believe in, but that's just my 2 cents. I don't care what anyone believes just as long as nobody's getting hurt by it:) I like you as a person bro."

depression,fdn4962,t1_fdmxed5,1578576837.0,"Yeah that's exactly how I've always felt. Spent nights in bed with my phone on dial-up for the helpline. I never called it. You don't have to tell anyone, just do what you can to help yourself survive it."
depression,fdmc5yf,t1_fdm7trg,1578545266.0,"Yeah, I me too. I've felt this kind of thing for about 2 years. I haven't cried once. I sometimes think that I'm just a lying loser. It kind of just wears on you. A year ago my best friend left me because of religion. I had a pretty bad breakdown but it just felt like I was still lying. Lately I've started to think I just can't admit it. Most people around me look down on it, but I've only told one person over the 2 years. Every once it a while I let it all out and put a knife to my arm or something. It's the same thing over and over. I am also all smiles and laughs outside of myself. I joke about it while I am experiencing it myself. But I am. I have to be right?

Try and get the courage to tell someone you trust about it. You'll feel a lot less like you're lying to yourself. Anyone you know you can trust will try to help. It may sound like what you hear everywhere, but human interaction can really help you through this of thing. You ARE a good person."
