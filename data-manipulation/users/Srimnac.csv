aww,ff3u3p4,t1_ff3n2qq,1579548881.0,"After work every day I take my dog in the backyard and play fetch for about 30-40 mins. This helps him get the sprinting itch out. Them we go inside, go downstairs and play tug of war (carpet helps his grip) then its on and off attention through the night. He can't sit still unless he is sleeping or chewing a bone. No bone has the longevity and enjoyment raw hide serves. I know they are bad, and would love to change, but I just haven't found anything out there"
aww,ff3pjob,t1_ff3ib50,1579546087.0,"Same. It lacks flavor, but is a nice hard chew which makes my dog come back to like once every few weeks"

aww,ff3cw0n,t1_ff3acqi,1579538623.0,Bully sticks cost more and last 1/4 of the time. I have yet to find a bone that works as well. Dont even get me started on Himalayan/ yak bones

HomeImprovement,fem3f2t,t1_feketwl,1579238453.0,Next time I am at home depot I'll take pictures for you
HomeImprovement,fekdub2,t1_fek906n,1579197970.0,"So the first image is a single pole 2 way switch. That is why it has 3 screws and a ground. The second is a single pole 1 way switch with two switches. Thats why it has more screws.

If the first image was a one way switch, then yes only two brass screws, but that is not the case for 2 ways."
HomeImprovement,fejxxuc,t1_fehlw9a,1579188381.0,"Thanks for your help, but I am guessing you looked at the pictures wrong...they do look like 3 ways. I called my electrician, and he walked me through it, and it is fixed. I would suggest making sure you know the facts before you tell someone they are going to start a fire."
HomeImprovement,fehg4w9,t1_fehcs4w,1579115843.0,What makes these 3 way switches? I know for sure the one on the left is a 2 way...or at least I thought?
HomeImprovement,fehcfjn,t3_ep69fq,1579113693.0,Also to note there is a black wire connected from a nut to the previous double switch. Does that wire serve any purpose?
HomeImprovement,fehc3av,t3_ep69fq,1579113493.0,"Here are some [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/hMU4GV7) the last pic shows a free white wire, but that has since been connectee"
