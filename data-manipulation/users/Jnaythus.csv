todayilearned,ff2my12,t1_ff2l1i9,1579514005.0,"""Hold My Bear"" . . . The phrase spoken before many a crazy thing is attempted by people emboldened by alcohol."
todayilearned,ff0wgsc,t1_ff0m3yp,1579472928.0,"As a gun owner, and someone who has spent a lot of time at the gun range, I absolutely get this. The caliber used was a real shock. Even a .22 might get through a book. However, putting myself into the shoes of this girl... I'd want to see that bullet NOT go through a book before ever placing my finger on that trigger."
todayilearned,fezs8dv,t1_fezqda5,1579460982.0,"I had heard this story before, but this version only mentioned that he showed her a book that he shot and the bullet didn't go through. As someone pulling the trigger, I'd want to see this demonstration live."
todayilearned,fezpdfd,t1_feziy30,1579459988.0,That's the part that I didn't see in the story. Did they even try it ONCE without a person behind the book? I guess that's not as exciting as this HMB moment.
Detroit,fepfmbf,t1_feomt6z,1579319287.0,I don't want it. Is it too late to opt out? I never read those license agreements. /s
GolfGTI,femki83,t1_felkp3i,1579260141.0,"I also had two Civic Si. 2006 and 2010. The 2010 was a nightmare that the dealer refused to fix. I think the NEW Civic Si fixes the low end torque issue, and I hear it has great brakes as well, but after 12+ years of driving manual ONLY everywhere, I just LOVE my dual-clutch transmission. My only regret about my GTI is it's black, and . ..  well, most know what a mixed blessing a black car can be. Absolutely BEAUTIFUL when clean, which is never more than a matter of minutes. :)"
HumansBeingBros,fe1uf1d,t1_fe08yj5,1578830985.0,"I have animals, who force me to speak to them. My cat just meows, which isn't English that I can understand, so I just patronize her and say: ""Yes sweetheart."" Meanwhile my dog needs commands and cajoling, so both keep me vocal on a daily basis."
aww,fdawwqh,t1_fda5c5v,1578251335.0,That's because she's just unaware of all of the love she's about to get and how happy she'll soon be. This is the obvious conclusion to this .gif. (*whew* fixed)
AnimalsBeingBros,fdankzc,t1_fd9gunn,1578248050.0,"Some context . . . slow loris are not domesticated animals. It's illegal to own them, and the process to render them ""safe"" is inhumane and very cruel. i.e. There's no good 'in captivity' slow lori video."
BetterEveryLoop,fbkgmzn,t1_fbjxnai,1576950025.0,My back and neck went out watching you watch that.
