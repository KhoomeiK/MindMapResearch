Sienna is pretty accurate as far as Bright Wizards go. A lot of people gloss over how they are effectively walking nuclear reactors while not being immune to the sideeffects of being a walking nuclear reactor. Namely: heat."

agedlikemilk,fejkelp,t1_feji2uo,1579177837.0,"He has been impeached.

But that's not the end of the process.

Impeachment is when the bodies of the white house get together and go 'The president has committed enough wrong to warrant an investigation and, if necessary, stand trial and face removal or even arrest.'

Impeachment isn't yanking him from office. That's called Removal. And it's different, and it's possibly for a President to be impeached, found guilty, charged with crime, and then not removed from office. It's happened before."

I would still go out of my way to avoid any and all overt confrontations otherwise. I don't even like raising my voice at people. But if the options I'm given are 'Die' or 'Fight Back' then it's not much of a hard choice."

agedlikemilk,fc54lrp,t1_fc4qh9m,1577442875.0,"One thing to keep in mind about Germany Post-WWI is that everyone thought Germany's economy was so utterly devastated by the Treaty of Versailles that a proper military offensive was a literal impossibility. That, and they had invented a new form of warfare to go hand in hand with this handicap, the Blitzkrieg.

Even a traditional offensive across Belgium would've made headway before being stopped ahead of Ile-de-France, but no one was ready for what they were about to do.

There's a lot of memes about France not being militarily minded and weak and cowards, but the Blitzkrieg went against all forms of traditional warfare, took nearly everyone by surprise, and ended up being the source of Germany's early victories. And then also being the reason why they lost, as they continually outran their supply lines as they got involved in much longer, protracted engagements with powers as strong (or Stronger than, in the case of the USSR, ) as they were.

That and Britains policy of 'Peace in Our Time' wasn't a good idea in hindsight. There's some theories that what Chamberlain was doing with the policy was just buying time, trying to move the target off of the home island of Britain for long enough to get a decent air force and naval force up and going again, which would arguably be instrumental to the success of D-Day and Germany's eventual defeat, but there's a lot to discuss about WWII that I just don't want to get into here."
