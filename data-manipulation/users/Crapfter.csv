There's some logic to that concern, since in some cases it might just be an exercise in extreme fetishistic egoism - a triumph over Woman - made possible by the kind of over-the-top privilege no one should have. And then what kind of life does the resulting child live?    
  
That's an icky thought, but something about the whole argument rubs me wrong. First of all, I don't think it's fair or reasonable to make two-dimensional cartoon villains out of people. Second, although some people really might be looking at the possibilities and salivating at the thought of rendering *whole* women somewhat redundant in reproduction, they'd still need someone to give them a uterus in the first place, and we don't usually slaughter people for their organs around here. (In some places we do, of course.) Third, maybe we should all be much more interested in the effects of uterus transplant technology on women. Putting a functioning uterus in a man is pretty far down the road, and right now there are women who would benefit immensely from uterus transplants whether or not they use them to reproduce; one would hope they'd be first in line. 
  
But the more I think about it, the more I worry that underprivileged women will undoubtedly find themselves in a situation where they're pressured or forced to sell or give away their uteri the way people sell sex, blood, semen, and kidneys. Surrogacy is bad enough. How many women around the world are living as sex slaves right now (whose traffickers don't want them to get pregnant anyway), and what are their uteri worth on the open market?"
