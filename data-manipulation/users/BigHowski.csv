OK so it might be hard for me to answer this properly for you because I found the books from the TV series and read them after getting to season 3 and the TV show seasons are roughly the same as a book. I was already hooked in to the story before reading. Anyway I really enjoyed the 1st book and thought it got better in the next 2. However I really dug the characters and the universe, maybe if you didn't your not going to find as much enjoyment as me. 

I've only just finished book 5 and the only one I had problems with so far was book 4... and from what I read I'm not alone with that. By the end of book 3 you have a good idea what the proto molecule is and what it's purpose was.... Obviously there are more questions though. I'd definitely say that the ""original"" story arc is 3 books and after that we start a new one. The end of the 1st book from memory directly sets up the 2nd so it could be that. 

Anyway I'm not sure I've helped, it does get better but I was already really enjoying it. Maybe it's worth it for you but also maybe it's not."

You keep putting this but really its not true and its not about what he said but more what he did. Originally:

>On 8 May 2017, during the course of a rape trial at Canterbury Crown  Court involving four (Asian) defendants, Yaxley-Lennon attended court  and attempted to film the defendants for an online broadcast entitled  “Tommy Robinson in Canterbury exposing Muslim child rapists”. He was  thwarted by the judge making arrangements for the defendants and jurors  to leave court through alternative routes, and so settled for filming  himself on camera, both on the court steps and inside the court  building, preaching to his online followers about “Muslim paedophiles”.  He was interrupted and told by court staff that recording was prohibited  (section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1925, as we’ve discussed  above), but continued to record, insisting that he had been told by a  different court that he was entitled to film the defendants  (notwithstanding that court buildings are plastered with signs reminding  people not to do this). His video diatribe – in which he said that “the  paedophiles are hiding”, that the police had asked him not to “expose”  them as paedophiles (presumably on the basis that they were, at that  time, defendants in a live trial) but that “we will”, and that he would  be “going round to their house” to catch the defendants on camera – thus  continued. The judge hearing the rape trial was made aware, and he was  brought before court to be dealt with for contempt of court.  
>  
>The judge, HHJ Norton, dealt with Yaxley-Lennon on 22 May 2017. She  found that he was in contempt by having filmed inside the court  building, contrary to section 41, but was also in common law contempt by  having continued to film having been told to stop by the court staff.  The judge considered the content of his broadcast, and the real risk of  his actions derailing the trial, and committed him to prison for 3  months, suspended for a period of 18 months. In practical terms, a  suspended sentence means that the prison sentence (3 months) hangs over  you for the operational period (18 months). If you remain offence-free  and comply with any requirements the court makes, you will never have to  serve your sentence. If you reoffend, the presumption in law is that  you will serve that prison sentence, additional to whatever sentence you  receive for the new offence.

So he was even warned that what he was doing was breaching the reporting restrictions and asked nicely to stop. He did not and got arrested. He was told explictly at the end of the trial that things like this breach the law. He was then given the benefit of doubt and a suspended sentance

Later at Leeds his live video feed showed the defendents entering the court. That is enough to be breaking the reporting restrictions. You might not like that law but thats the law everybody has to follow.

Again I'd like to point out that there was plenty of reporters present and the case made local and national news with nobody else having issues. All he had to do was wait till the reporting restrictions had been lifted or not film them entering the court. He did not and therefore broke the law.

Most importantly in this the man himself admitted that he broke the law

>With no disrespect intended, you've been told a lie and believed it because it is about someone you don't like.

I would actually level that at you. He matches your ideology and talks about things that you believe to be true so your ignoring basic facts about this case and him as a person.

You've said multiple times that he is a good person who has dedicated his life to protecting innocents from things like muslim rape gangs. Let me ask you this: now he's recived millions in funding, what exactly has he done to help the communities he says he's trying to protect? All I can see is someone using the abused to further his personal and political aims. Where are the help centers, what donations has he made to the families of those effected?

You say he's not a racisit but [here is a video of him using a racial slur](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/tommy-robinson-video-drugs-cocaine-islam-far-right-israel-palestine-edl-a8776991.html).

I disagree and I believe this is another case of him playing in to his role. Either way the man had representation and they would have pushed for it. Simularly I've yet to see a single Lawyer believe that there is a case for wrongful conviction. I'd be happy to be proved wrong with a source though?  


> He didn't ignore it though, he was very careful not to say anything that  could be seen as influencing the outcome, nor from reporting within the  auspices of the court. 

He did though, he knew as well as the other reporters what was allowed adn was not under the restrictions and purposfully wemt about breaching them. He'd been warned beforehand.  


> Not at all and I'm happy to explain it to you accurately if you genuinely believe it is as you've described it? 

Please do, I'm all ears  


  

>He's not remotely a racist or someone  who has used racism to either make a name for himself or make money for  himself. He is a person who believes what he is doing with regard to  his activism is right and there is no denying the personal cost his  doing so has had on him,his family and friends.

>In  short, he is someone concerned about Islamism and how Islam enables the  interpretation of Islamism with all of the related consequences from  the grooming gangs to terrorism. It's that simple.

ukpolitics,feypr1l,t1_fey16ru,1579448904.0,"> But people already live on less than that, that is not a valid argument

I'm sorry I wholly disagree. People survive on less than that and it's not just the money we are talking about here. £9 an hour over a normal week and your taking home less than £1300 a month after tax. You might think that a lot but it really isn't if you have to pay things like rent. The point is that it's a dead end job for very little, in an area where they have no support network. it's no suprise that people want to get a job that has a future in an area they like, every single human being would want that.

> Like it's not as if they're not doing it because they're too busy earning £10 elsewhere, is it?

Record low unemployment would point to them doing exactly that

> Whether you think £9 or £20 is what people should be paid is completely irrelevant to whether people from this country should be picking fruit as opposed to bringing in cheap foreign labour to do it.

Its not really. Again while it's not just about the money a low wage will mean that people will look elsewhere. Money is just one element of what makes a job attractive or not but if you up the money it can make up for other areas being not that good, just as if you make the other areas better it can make up for a lower pay. No matter what you think should happen these places need staff. If you understand why people might not want that job you can attempt to fix it. It's not lazyness as you suggested. 

At the end of the day if the job is not attractive enough for local people a company will find staff. Your options are either allow the company to make the job more attractive or accept cheaper labour from areas that make the job attractive. Calling people lazy does neither, is not true and does nothing to help.

> Unless you're willing to apply that logic to the supermarkets, in which Britons don't have a problem working in already, it makes absolutely no sense to bring it up.

The overall package a supermarket offers is wholly different to a fruit farm and by trying to minimise the argument just to a monetary value you are missing the point. For example:

* A supermarket is generally in a location close to a person's support network, straight away that makes it more attractive and allows for people to do things like house share with people they like or live at home. 

* A supermarket is normally in a town offering a higher quality of life than rural farms and putting you closer to other jobs 

* Supermarkets have career progression, you can start off as a shelf picker and progress.

* Supermarkets offer better working conditions

* Supermarkets offer better working hours and flexibility 

* Supermarkets glhave recognised transferable skills for other jobs

* Supermarkets work year around so you have constant employment 

I'm sure there are plenty of others I've not thought about.

A job is more than the simply a paycheck. How much and what matters varies but there are a lot of negatives to a fruit picker job when compared to other minimum wage jobs. You've wholly missed the point by blinkering your viewpoint and that's why it makes no sense 

> Having worked at Sainsbury's I earned £9 an hour.

> Few weeks ago I literally did work for an agency for £8.50 an hour.

I and I'm pretty sure nearly all of the UK have at some point or another have worked a minimum wage job at points, it does not really make you special in anyway.

I'll ask you this though, why did you personally not take one of these farm jobs? Chances are it'll be for the same reasons the people you call lazy are not either. Why would you give up everything you know and move to the middle of nowhere to do back breaking work being paid not enough to live somewhere so you have to live in a crowded house with people you don't know or possibly even like? All of that and it makes it harder for you to get out of it to get a better job as it it has no transferable skills and your stuck somewhere where it's very hard to travel for things like interviews. All these negatives and for no more pay than a supermarket"

Why is it surprising that a job with poor pay, stuck in the middle of nowhere, with bad working conditions, no prospects...
