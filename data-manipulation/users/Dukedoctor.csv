BDSMcommunity,ffdyr4f,t1_ffdx738,1579832271.0,"Well while I love consensually treating women terribly sometimes, it's not how I really feel. There are an infinite number of women who are smarter and stronger than me. If someone likes being treated that way, they are getting something out of it too. just keep in mind, if it's safe sane and consensual, you're just doing it for pleasure or love.  Have fun, play with it, experiment.

 But also, as a dominant person, you have to keep in mind the other person's mental state, because it's largely your responsibility. Just communicate as much as possible. That's key. 

You will get better with practice."

BDSMcommunity,ffcosce,t3_eswxu6,1579804007.0,"Definitely have a nice life talk about limit and interests and develope a safe word and all that stuff.   

One thing that's good is to choose your words carefully and speak clearly when ordering her around. You don't want to sound sheepish or quiet, that's not very dominating. Maintaining eye contact can also be good for this, though sometimes I just want to lay back, close my eyes, and feel the awesome sensations when I'm ordering her around. In that case, I'll say something like, ""you do all the work while I relax. Don't stop either, I don't care if I fall asleep."" 

I personally can be pretty mean and degrading verbally during a session. You could tell her that she is an object that exists solely for your pleasure, a living blow-up doll, or a simple servant, nothin more. Or whatever you're into.

Maybe have her call you sir, daddy, or master, something like that. 

Have fun with it, these are just a few ideas."

relationship_advice,ffc4ed5,t3_espv0n,1579791254.0,"I've always been attracted to tomboys. Pretty hot when a cute girl dresses kinda butch but then you get em home and undress them. Idk if you're into kink at all but that idea, (undressing a more masculine-dresser so you can see their naked body with tits and pussy on blast, maybe even asking them to/having them dress kinda fem [Lacy underwear, short skirt, bow in the hair, very feminine type clothes]) and act more girlish for you during a session, that's an amazing feeling of control and just a really hot concept in general for some.

It would be very hard though, because they've already shown him getting away with so much, even if he gets caught, it's kind of late and unsurprising and now will have a very minimized emotional impact. What would be the lesson if he does get caught now? ""Don't do three bad things, cause you get caught the third time?"" Same thing even moreso if he gets away with whatever he does.
