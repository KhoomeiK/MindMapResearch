I remember reading somewhere that there is an outrageous statistic  about how robo-callers have been fined millions before and the latest estimates of how much anyone has actually paid is, like, $7,000.00 with no repercussions.

Found the Link: 

https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fcc-has-fined-robocallers-208-million-its-collected-6-790-11553770803

The article is from last March about fines levied since 2015. The total was 208 million and the estimated amount paid as of March 2019? $6,790.00. 

In other words? Unless there are suddenly new enforcement rules that create ACTUAL consequences for not actually paying up (like Jail Time for the CEOs of companies who don’t pay up) I don’t think these new fines will be any more successful."

aww,feojprt,t1_feoapao,1579301072.0,"If left to his own devices my cat Pino will:

A: Walk back and forth across me on the couch, managing each time to get at least three paws directly on my balls.

B: On the final pass stand directly on my legs for a minute or two.

C: turn around a few times, likely indecisive about whether he stomped my balls enough.

D: Finally move to one side of me and plop down with his head/arms resting on my leg.

However after the fifth or so time dealing with this I quickly found an answer: when he hops up on the couch and makes for my legs I will quickly snag him by the torso and tip him over. Pino is a very chill, go-with-the-flow kitty so he typically just flops over under the slightest provocation. I then pull him directly up against my leg and then rest my arm on his side. 99% of the time he stays in that position until he falls asleep.

I would suggest trying this- but only if you have a chill kitty. Cat Tipping is much cuter and less harmful than Cow Tipping."

I’m currently using ALots with JKise and also added Watcher Schuri to the mix to give ALots that little extra push.

Yufine is an amazing unit, but not worth the risk of ending back up at square one with nothing to show for it. I’m really sorry.

EDIT: to show the math: 70 pulls is 350 bookmarks, which is x7 900 Crystal Bookmark Packs (where you get 50 bookmarks for 900 crystals). Which means you’d need to accrue 6,300 crystals. I have no idea where anyone could acquire that many in only a week without whaling.

Corvus, although recently nerfed slightly, is still an excellent tank and has decent end-game PvP/PVE potential as far as I know.

politics,fegp625,t3_eoyqc3,1579099227.0,"It’s actually hilarious. In CNN’s desperate desire to appear “balanced” and “moderate” they have literally alienated nearly every single kind of viewer. Conservative Fox News viewers despise CNN no matter how many overtures CNN makes to them because their cult leader tells them its “Fake News” on a daily (sometimes hourly) basis. And the saddest part about that? Those bullshit overtures they make, and the right-wing talking points they continue to peddle so they can claim to be “Moderate” does nothing more than actually prove Trump right. Which then makes any thinking American fucking hate them.

Being “moderate” is far less important than sticking to the truth and reality. And yet their constant need to appear like they don’t take sides ultimately pulls them further and further to the right due to Republicans constantly moving the goal-posts.

Nothing shown isn’t what these anonymous accounts were willing to attach these toxic statements to from the get go. Could her rabid fans begin inundating these accounts with @s and DMs? Sure.

They are bred to be better pets. The pursuit of one trait above all others can mean a lack of genetic diversity and unintended genetic side-effects.

Pugs have trouble breathing because they were bred to not have a proper snout. Their eyes can frequently pop out of their sockets because a canine’s face has the snout for a reason. Breeding a dog to lack that snout creates those unintended side effect.

To get a Boston Terrier to look like a Boston Terrier they can’t physically give birth without a cesarean because their “look” means a female’s hips are bred to be too narrow.

Cows will die if they aren’t milked regularly.

EpicSeven,fdyt8h8,t1_fdypzas,1578783378.0,"Both comps sound about right. The first sounds like a real PIA as defense and, honestly, your best late-game PvP setup. The second sounds like a great option as well for an offensive team (Aux Lots is hit or miss on Defensive teams since he will always use his S3 first and his real strength is using his S2 first).

I would possibly switch out Luna for Basar in the first comp, though. Luna isn’t bad- but I haven’t feared a Luna in a defense team in forever. I’m far more frightened of a fast Basar. So I would use Basar- but only if you have the gear to get him speed above 230."

She will definitely be a boon to you throughout most of the story.

End-game, however? She has definitely been power-crept into relative end-game obscurity. Can you build her strong? Sure. She can work. But by the time you get to that point you will likely find yourself with far better options (4 and 5 star options). I’d level her and gear her appropriately but wouldn’t invest much Molagora into her abilities.

DragaliaLost,fd04c3d,t1_fczjd18,1578113432.0,"I mean it is. Sorry not sorry. Surviving Master High Dragons with AI completely alive isn’t an indication that the AI isn’t stupid (though, to be very fair, it’s much smarter than it was when the game first released. Those were dark times).

What that means is that A: they are over-geared for the challenge (which is usually how it is accomplished) and B: the players have run it so many times that they have figured out the exact way to work around it.

The first is merely time and resources. The second is a lot of skill, but also a lot of trial, error and time as well. All to work around the inherent issues with the AI and their inability to often evade or try to get out of the purple.

A lot of time I’m not looking to invest in this kind of game. I want a challenge- but a moderate one that is fun, not frustrating. Rewarding to overcome, but not something I’m forced to lose for hours on end while I experiment with the minutia of slight changes that could possibly eek out a win.

But I want to make this clear: I fully support that level of painful challenge in this game so that people who DO like it can have that challenge. For some people that’s fun- and I want as many people happy with this game as possible so it can keep going and getting better. I just don’t personally want to deal with that in an iPhone game. 

I want a moderate challenge that lets me play with my toys (units) and feel like I’m accomplishing something. I feel like this New Years Omega Challenge does that.

If I want to play a game with a massive difficulty curve I’ll start up my PS4 or PC. If I want a fun, lovely GACHA collector with decent challenges and cute story? Then I’ll gladly play it on a phone.

Which is all my personal view, of course. Many people on here love the EXTREMELY difficult content they’ve been releasing and I am happy for them. I wouldn’t want them making that particular content easier because that’s not for me. 

However I also don’t want that to be the ONLY content they release. For a little while there it was either content you could sleep through or content that would kick your ass relentlessly. There was nothing in-between. But these new Omega challenges? They are actually hitting that sweet spot and I, for one, am thrilled.

That help clarify things?"
DragaliaLost,fczc8zn,t1_fcz17b5,1578098013.0,"Not really, no.

The controls are fine . . . For a Videogame on an iPhone with touch controls.

But they are NOT “pretty good” by actual controller standards. They just . . . . Aren’t. Sorry."
DragaliaLost,fcz0cz8,t1_fcyqspr,1578091090.0,"I mean you’re 100% right but I also stopped trying to bother winning it because my AI was dumb and the controls are finicky.

I haaaaaate losing because of control issues.

But that’s just me. I’m thrilled people loved that event."
DragaliaLost,fcyqute,t1_fcylne9,1578085195.0,"Oh my. Now that’s a challenge.

One I won’t bother with."
DragaliaLost,fcyn720,t1_fcy26xc,1578083189.0,"Which I very much appreciate. I’m happy the over-tuned, incredibly difficult content exists for people that enjoy that- but the moderate difficulty found here is what I’m looking for in a game whose controls don’t offer the level of nuance I need to not get angry at a game."
politics,fcymafh,t3_ejgwxj,1578082644.0,"Yes. It would be.

It’s sad- I even thought to myself “all these news articles about new massively damning evidence about the Ukraine scandal makes me feel like he’s about to do something fucking stupid to distract us.” 

I am really, REALLY sick of being right these past three years."
EpicSeven,fcxb6c1,t1_fcwxzrr,1578058013.0,"ML Corvus will definitely do that . . . With the right gear. Which I definitely do not have for him yet. Which is why I haven’t bothered 6-starring him yet.

But yeah- definitely realize he was an amazing pull."
rupaulsdragrace,fcw24qi,t3_ej0n45,1578015388.0,fantastic
EpicSeven,fcvxmkw,t3_eiydr1,1578012422.0,"I thought I had spent all my luck getting her in around 15 pulls.

Now I simply think it was my crystal stash saving me from wasting materials needlessly.

I’ll likely enjoy her but she has gone from the front of the pack to 6-star to behind Violet, ML Corvus and Basaar."
politics,fcvl6ro,t1_fcvggs5,1578004468.0,"This is utter garbage and a massive number of top economists would disagree. Especially when it comes to something like warren’s plan that only kicks in for people with the kind of excessive wealth found in the top 1% of this country.

Utter. Fucking. Garbage."
worldnews,fcv633t,t1_fcusigs,1577995408.0,"Oh my dear, I’m afraid it’s already OVER 9000."
politics,fcuxdze,t3_eiyio2,1577990441.0,"And yet he balked at Warren’s plan to do exactly that.

This feels like lip service from a guy who knows that such a thing is unlikely (unless someone like Warren or Sanders wins *fingers crossed* and even then it will be an uphill battle because of the sheer influence billionaires have over our political system.)"
EpicSeven,fctopf5,t1_fcqh17z,1577951825.0,It took me far too long to notice myself.
rupaulsdragrace,fctndtp,t1_fcthq0g,1577950066.0,"It falls into uncanny valley territory.

Photoshopping is fine. Subtle, well-done retouching (reducing wrinkles, color correcting, highlighting features and generally removing minor imperfections) is often necessary to eliminate the horrifying imperfections that high quality photos tend to heighten and accentuate.

However if you go too far you end up creating a creepy death mask.

Tyra Sanchez is young and talented. Her makeup skills are on point and with proper lighting a drag queen can look fantastic with little retouching. She doesn’t need the digital formaldehyde- it actually detracts from the artistry. All I see is the photoshop and not the actual makeup skills."
gaybrosgonemild,fctdhg1,t3_eip51h,1577939811.0,That is. . . Enticing.
rupaulsdragrace,fctdg2n,t3_eilx6s,1577939777.0,Her makeup and style were always her strongest suits- she didn’t need the excessive photoshop smoothing.
