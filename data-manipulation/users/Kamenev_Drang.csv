Doesn't matter how many more routes they've built, still massively more expensive than shipping by sea. 

Theres a difference between COIN and defending a US ally against a legitimate conventional threat. The latter is far less ambiguous and far more likely to unify the USs political classes"
worldnews,fe45tok,t1_fe3goud,1578856100.0,"Chinese subs are third rate diesel boats. They will be spotted and sank long before they reach a CVBG.

As for anti-ship ballistic missiles...how do you think China will target them onto a CVBG? Satelites? 

And something like 90% of China's trade goes via sea. Why? Because transhipping through Russia would be incredibly expensive, thus destroying their competitive advantage. You may as well suggest moving goods over the Himalayas or through Best Korea: it's absurd. I strongly suggest you look at the actual logistics entailed and the GDP proportions involved (as well as the relative stability of either governments)"

The US can simply operate off it's CBGs well out of range of Chinese missile attack (and well protected from it). Sure, you could crater every runway in Taiwan under a hail of surface to surface missiles, but any ships the PRC puts to sea can be killed at a standoff by carrier aircraft or submarines. This isn't even counting Japan.

That and China's economy will implode under the blockade. Can't export shit to the world if the USN says no."
