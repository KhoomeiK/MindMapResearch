AnimalCrossing,ffb2oet,t1_ffaf0yb,1579750266.0,We raised a black and white girl cat that we named Ansel we joke we should’ve named her Punchy.  But she’s much too active and not lazy enough.  She does go “mmrpht” though.
AskReddit,ffar0xn,t3_esc8vq,1579742470.0,He'd probably talk politics.  I'd tell him to stop thinking about his current teenage crush and move on.  I'd say I'm happily with someone but I'd look into finding a career.
patientgamers,ff5p5gw,t3_eqj99i,1579604263.0,"Yeah I have that with Shin Megami Tensei 4 and its sequel SMT4 Apocalypse.  Great games on the 3DS but I’d never play them again.   

I know it might be considered blasphemous with other JRPG players but I only played Chrono Trigger once.   I have no interest in playing it again and getting the other endings."
cats,ff5onn0,t3_ernmx4,1579603536.0,"I had a brown tabby like Fred but he had an injured jaw and was a bit fat.  He was named Bill, I had the opportunity to see him pass away at the animal hospital with my dad and stepmom.  It was the first time I remember seeing my dad cry. I was 26.  

I’m sorry for your loss."
AnimalCrossing,fexwntj,t3_eqif8f,1579437691.0,Has Punchy been confirmed or better yet shown off?  My girlfriend and I are huge fans of him.   She never played Animal Crossing until we got together over 3 years.   She plays new leaf a lot now.

cats,fed2ao2,t3_env14y,1578995165.0,"If she wasn’t so cute I don’t think we would’ve kept her.  She’s really mean to other people and even to us.  Haha.  She’s our feral monster.   It is fun that she plays fetch.  She loves to play those catnip fish toys, too."
cats,fe5kzyi,t3_enuca2,1578870787.0,Two of my cats love to sleep on top of our five tier bookshelf.  One even chases her tail on top of it.
cats,fe5il0c,t3_env14y,1578869896.0,Her favorite toy is that stuffed Jiji cat from Kiki’s Delivery Service.  When we got her she was smaller than her.

NintendoSwitch,fc04t4c,t3_efg1p4,1577278582.0,If you like classic JRPGs but with some modern adjustments I’d recommend Dragon Quest XI S.  It’s probably the best edition of the game.   It has a 3D mode and a classic 2D mode and some other special chapters.  It’s long but rather good.  The only drawback is the music isn’t as good as others in the series.
