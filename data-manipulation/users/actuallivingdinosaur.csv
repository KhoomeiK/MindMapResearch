rarepuppers,ffb602h,t1_ffawvnp,1579752713.0,I'm severely allergic and have to stay in ones that don't allow pets & have to avoid accessible rooms due to the higher potential of service animals being in them. Holiday Inn Express & some Marriott & Hyatt properties won't allow pets. Many also only allow service animals on specific floors. Just call and ask. I have no issue with certain hotels allowing pets as long as they advertise it. Because then I can simply avoid it. I just hate pet owners who sneak them into rooms not realizing that they could send a person to a hospital because of it.

It was so easy to avoid them. Now I see pets absolutely everywhere where they shouldn’t be. It’s such a ridiculous culture that has developed over the last few years. I honesty wish we would overhaul our ADA policy on working animals to require a card or vest for them. That way people could actually question if they were a working dog and kick out non ADA pets.

I do think that people who refer to pets as their “children” or “babies” are absolutely cringey. And I find it idiotic when they put their pets ahead of their own health, or the health of other people. As long as I continue to see pets in stores, restaurants, on public transportation, in strollers, and have to be inconvienenced because of them, I will continue to judge and dislike them. My story was just one example and I can give you a list of them in the last week alone.

I had to move from the row of seats the dog just crawled all over and the flight attendant told me that I could be removed from the plane if my allergy was that severe since it wasn’t safe for me to be on it. Luckily the other flight attendent disagreed with her and I moved to the last row. The dog lady got exactly what she wanted.

Make copies of the letter and hand them out to the RA and whatever the higher level of authority is above the RA. Also get it on file with administration. They have to reasonably accommodate you.

>I could never ever give up animals, and frankly navigating my life with friends and family would be impossible unless I was willing to suffer.

Living a life in suffering is your choice. Your body is constantly having an autoimmune response and that is not healthy. This is why doctors work to lesson that response because having to take an antihistamine every day means that your symptoms are not controlled. Based on your previous comments, it seems like your allergies are not as severe as most people's on here, making you very lucky. This also sounds like you need better people in your life. All my friends have cats or dogs and make slight accommodations for me. All get togethers are at my home, they sometimes change before heading over, and they will always use a large lint brush before they come around me. And it works. People don't carry as much hair and dander on their clothes as most people assume. Especially if they are clean people. However if I go into their house and sit on their couch, I immediately get hives. 

>I'm just sick of people suggesting I give up my cat because of allergies when I need them for emotional support. 

Because when that cat is making you sick the only logical thing to do would be to get rid of it, however hard that is. And it takes a very long time to remove pet allergens from a home afterward, so you will continue to react for a period afterward. As for the emotional aspect, this is why programs exist to give you proper therapy and medication to eliminate the emotional or service need for an animal. My cousin had to do exactly this when it was discovered that his infant was allergic to his service dog. 

>I had to come up with coping strategies including acceptance and medications otherwise life would be unbearable.

Have you tried allergy shots? Because it sounds like they might be able to help you. They are a long term commitment, but they do help. And they may eliminate your need to take meds every day. 

>You have one perspective, I have another.

It was incorrect advice. And advice that could in turn make someone sicker or send them into a more severe reaction. An allergist would not recommend to simply ""deal with allergies"" as is. Nor should you tell people to deal with being around pets implying that they could never be around people with pets. People should never be told to ""learn to live with an allergy"" or to ""deal with it as is"". This is why treatment exists, and sometimes that treatment is avoidance. This is why people like OP need to speak with their allergist."
Allergies,fdq2qv7,t1_fdpootg,1578651998.0,"This is crap advice and not how allergies work as an adult. Most people with pet allergies  absolutely have to avoid pets in order to live a functioning life. More so if they have an additional condition such as asthma and copd.

A decade of allergy shots has done nothing to help with this allergy. I don’t like cats and dogs and advice like “you’ll get used to it” or “you can’t avoid them forever” from pet people has made me resent them even more.

I would suggest going to the allergist with your mom and having them explain the severity of the allergy with exposure and the concern they have for your health.

sandiego,fcp8mxe,t1_fcp6x15,1577854171.0,There are also city ordinances against this. My MIL called the city on her neighbor because their hoarding issues were attracting vermin and it started spilling out into the other neighbors property. Two weeks later the property was clean.
Asthma,fcjpjmo,t3_ehjp3y,1577698158.0,"This happened to me at one point in high school.. I asked them “what are you doing?” “Are you ok?” “What’s funny about coughing?” “I don’t get it?”

The more they had to explain, the more they made themselves look like assholes in front of other people. Their jokes soon stopped."
Asthma,fcjlr81,t1_fciomg6,1577692895.0,"Lol I probably just pissed off a few pot heads with my comment. It tends to happen when I tell others that marijuana smoke is terrible for folks suffering from allergies and asthmatic. 

Hope you have better luck than me and are not as bothered!"
Allergies,fc7lgq5,t1_fc7jsbi,1577511282.0,Exactly this. No one should be bringing pets to college apartments or in the common areas. That’s a damn good way to ensure that other people suffer.
sandiego,fc768bk,t1_fc743nc,1577498643.0,Absolutely! SDSU’s geography department is also amazing. It’s filled with dedicated professors and students who are very engaged with community cleanups and environmental matters. Almost all the classes are interdisciplinary and there’s a good amount of fieldwork involved with some of them.
sandiego,fc73igs,t3_egifm3,1577496557.0,"Grossmont has a fantastic Geography dept. you won’t find many useful programs that are just natural resource. You can transfer to SDSU under Geography and get an emphasis degree in conservation & resource management, physical geography, or general geography. 

My route: AA in Geography at Grossmont, BA Physical Geography & MS Hydrology at SDSU."
Asthma,fc5lpuv,t3_egc1c0,1577460935.0,"I used it for a decade before I came to the realization that my worsening anxiety was a byproduct of singulair. I was switched to a different medication and it took a few months to feel “normal” after stopping it. It was unfortunate because it was helping my asthma, but the daily anxiety was very bothersome. Call your doc and let them know."
personalfinance,fc55or6,t3_eg9ukh,1577444504.0,No. This is normal.
Asthma,fc380at,t3_efygjm,1577383676.0,"I live in San Diego. I rarely come across it in public and just simply avoid the person(s) smoking it if I see it or start to smell it. A few times I’ve directly told someone to “get that away from me”, or kindly told them that I’m asthmatic and to please refrain from smoking near me if I’m seated somewhere first. It’s no different than cigarette smokers. The majority of people are considerate and won’t use it in public around other people, but sometimes people don’t care or are just completely oblivious. 

My apartment complex doesn’t care about cigarette smokers, but prohibits marijuana use for whatever reason. However both my unit and the one below me are smoke free units (I live in here for this reason specifically). So I have had to report our downstairs neighbors to the HOA and their landlord due to constant cigarette and marijuana use. One tennant was evicted due to it. I hated reporting it because no one should care what people do in their own home, but it was affecting mine and my husbands health."
suspiciouslyspecific,fc2a0y4,t1_fc29s5h,1577347872.0,Lol sure buddy.
suspiciouslyspecific,fc2a0ea,t1_fc29g03,1577347847.0,So great!
suspiciouslyspecific,fc29lh7,t1_fc29e01,1577347184.0,"Did you hear that folks? Over $1 BILLION in housing. No one cares. Though feel free to take your business elsewhere if you think it’s so bad here. :-)

Hahahaha oh man. The kool aid has been drunk, that’s for sure."
suspiciouslyspecific,fc29a5v,t1_fc28vkx,1577346682.0,"Right? I mean, hell I’ll happily take some of that free food, healthcare, and housing that they’re talking about!"
suspiciouslyspecific,fc2960y,t1_fc28c18,1577346498.0,"Lol I work in groundwater hydrology and my degrees are in environmental sciences. So I do know what I’m talking about. CEQA is the reason why homes aren’t allowed to be built on destabilized bluffs and why impervious surfaces need to be mitigated with vegetation and proper land management. Those “bushes and flowers” are there for a reason. It also guarantees that builders use native vegetation to further prevent ecological issues. 

I have no pity for home builders or the foreign investors complaining about the cost or the length of time it takes for approval. It takes time to run an environmental (or any scientific study) otherwise you come up with bad data that could later pose a risk to the structural integrity of a building. Had CEQA been established in the 1960s, numerous desert communities wouldn’t have been built in areas where the groundwater they use to drink was determined to be contaminated and the reason why so many who lived there developed cancer. 

Maybe we should stop encouraging builders to build these mega community luxury condos buildings that remain vacant because no one can afford them. Then the cost would go down."
suspiciouslyspecific,fc28c9s,t1_fc285gf,1577345237.0,Prove me wrong with some sources for those claims.
suspiciouslyspecific,fc281h1,t1_fc27h6o,1577344788.0,What’s mind blowing is how incorrect all of that is. Good grief.
travel,fc242h9,t1_fc21gnn,1577339578.0,"If you have a severe allergy you are supposed to inform the gate agent so that you can be reasonably accommodated and therefore are not inconveniencing yourself or other people. Having a larger person spill into your seat is not only an inconvienence, but a violation of personal space and a safety hazard. Many airlines have size restrictions on single seats to prevent that by requiring passengers of size to purchase two seats. 

I absolutely applaud the OP for being self aware and considerate enough to think of other passengers."
sandiego,fc1mv64,t3_efolbi,1577323541.0,"The fine itself usually isn’t going to get any lower. Sometimes the judge (if you show up to your hearing) will lower it if you have your traffic school completed beforehand. However I have completed online traffic school for under $30. I don’t know why his is so high, unless he is ineligible for online traffic school? Maybe someone else can chime in on that. 

Go to the CADMV site and it has the list of approved traffic schools (online and in person) you can choose from."
