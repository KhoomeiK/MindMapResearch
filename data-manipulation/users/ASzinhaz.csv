nfl,fefsaa4,t1_fefcgns,1579063694.0,"Sadly, there’s a good chance they will anyway. They’ll have taken fewer hits by retiring early, but that doesn’t negate the two decades of play that came before it."
AskReddit,fedxd9s,t1_fedx6wg,1579021893.0,"Thanks. She’s got a very loving and dedicated family, thankfully."
AskReddit,fedwpfu,t1_fedw1oi,1579021490.0,"Agreed. The quality of life for my cousin who suffers from Prader-Willi, and that of her family, is horrible. She’s hit an age where she’s having violent fits of anger that require multiple people to restrain her. The monitoring of her food to keep her at an average build like you mentioned has been a lifelong commitment, though."
AskReddit,fedse1t,t1_fedntep,1579018877.0,"It doesn’t cause obesity, but it requires careful monitoring to avoid it because people with Prader-Willi have insatiable hunger. They’re never full. My cousin has it, so her parents have to lock every cabinet and the fridge at all times."

Cornell,fdfgvj1,t3_el2j20,1578361400.0,"Swing dance was awesome. Especially good if you live on North because it’s in RPCC. Also, if you sign up with a friend, I would also recommend Swedish Massage."

nfl,fcfyg3i,t1_fcfxvp2,1577634823.0,Said friend also refuses to tip waiters unless service is 100% perfect (including immediate water refills) because otherwise they deserve minimum wage...
nfl,fcfxjy2,t3_eh6t7s,1577634662.0,"I see all these “I don’t believe in vaccines because xyz” and I know that’s easy to argue against, but my friend refuses to get vaccinated because he’s never gotten sick, so clearly they aren’t necessary.

aww,fcfix1t,t1_fcd9t5l,1577630488.0,"Interesting, right? Apparently (according to google) vitiligo can never 100% go away, but repigmentation can definitely happen!"
aww,fccqbc1,t1_fccpc94,1577601382.0,"It showed up one day (or at least that’s my recollection of it) when I was five. There are topical medications to combat it so a dermatologist prescribed one immediately. I had one on my forehead like a horse’s star and that one went away in a matter of months. I’ve stopped bothering with the cream but the patches are fading on their own anyway.

Edit: First time I’ve ever bothered to google vitiligo. Looks like it can’t go away entirely but pigment can return, which I’m lucky to have happening."
aww,fccbqwt,t1_fcc64yx,1577596590.0,"Yup, I have vitiligo. It can also go away, too! Most of mine has been gaining pigment over the years, but I think the hair that turned white from being in vitiligo patches will stay that way."
