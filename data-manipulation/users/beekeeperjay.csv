Beekeeping,fec5p6f,t1_febxsa5,1578967047.0,No I’m not.  I have met a lot of them in the past. I manage the bees at Webb’s honey and also own run 200 of my own hives.
Beekeeping,fe6f1af,t1_fe6dwec,1578888959.0,Good luck! I’m here in central Florida also. Just stay on top of your mite treatments/ checks
Beekeeping,fdzvyvo,t1_fdzd8j6,1578797103.0,I test for mites every two months and do treatments if the count gets above 3

educationalgifs,fdx98n3,t1_fdx8xs8,1578766534.0,We have 98+ degree days in the summer in the shade. When they are in direct sunlight they just don’t hold up. For me anyway.
educationalgifs,fdx8v72,t1_fdt6euq,1578766404.0,I’ve used boxes that were dipped years ago and they still seem to get covered in dirt and it runs off on my hands. I dip my boxes in copper naphthenate and then paint.

funny,fd7oi3x,t1_fd719gc,1578207628.0,You must have tiny hands. Took me over and hour. Mine was stuck in the back. Real pain in the ass
funny,fd6xqaz,t1_fd68ora,1578197022.0,That’s a pain in the ass to fix on a F-150.

Beekeeping,fckkzlo,t1_fckgaad,1577727614.0,I look forward to hearing the results.
Beekeeping,fcan9i7,t3_egrujw,1577572630.0,Great concept. I just don’t think it would last more than a year in the Florida weather.
Beekeeping,f7f03bu,t1_f7eip1a,1573669522.0, Central Florida here. Congrats on the honey! This year was a rocky year with all the rain we had.
