I'm not saying it's ok for things for kids to be bad, just that it's embarrassing for me to watch people spend a significant amount of time picking apart something that wasn't made for that. The movie achieved its goals - a lot of people saw it and I'm sure they'll sell tons of toys.

It makes me sad that people I like can't just watch it and be like ""well, that was fun, but messy."" I worry about people like Jenny Nicholson who made this[ long of a video ](https://youtu.be/GErIPKjwuDg)about what she didn't like about it.

I guess to me it's kind of like if everyone decided to become a food critic to roast a new McDonald's that opened. Like, I know we all loved McDonald's when we were kids, and it would be nice if they would open better restaurants, but why are you channeling this much energy into criticizing it? If you want to be a restaurant critic, there are tons of restaurants that are way more interesting to talk about. You don't seem smart for pointing out that McDonald's isn't amazing cuisine.
