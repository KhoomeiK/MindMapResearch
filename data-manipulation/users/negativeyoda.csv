Then again, you have to sit though dozens of boring podcasts of him bullshitting and telling in-jokes with his comedy and MMA friends and he has lent his massive platform to dipshit racists, so I stopped listening a couple years ago.

AskReddit,ffa4unn,t1_ff9q6xj,1579727914.0,"Of course digital can be good.  Then again, how many people own a fully digital system (that will last)?  Getting the sort of playback you're describing is a big, expensive pain in the ass and I still like the way vinyl playback sounds better.  But yeah, it can be done and the numbers probably look better on paper.  There.  Is that what you wanted me to say?

I also have recordings on DAT tapes which I cannot play back on anything (they were finicky as hell) and old digital masters of records that can't be remixed because the software and plugins don't exist anymore.  Maybe the dust has finally settled and things are mature but it sucked for decades and was the worst format for archiving.  If you were trying to record in the mid to late 90s you'd understand

Also, the playback point wasn't an argument, but an illustration.  No one listens to vinyl with Bluetooth earbuds, and few people are listening to digital files on awesome digital only systems with floor standing speakers.  I mean, shit, the vast majority of people listen to music via horrid sounding streams to the point where most pop music is optimized for playback with that in mind."

AskReddit,ffa1qpk,t1_ff9lcne,1579726135.0,"I'm aware that changing systems will obviously alter things a lot more than the delivery medium.  My argument was with that particular sentence was mainly: when was the last time someone listened to vinyl via Bluetooth headphones?

I also wasn't arguing fidelity per se, but what actually comes out of the speakers.  Vinyl playback DOES color the sound of what's output (just like tube guitar amplifiers for example... Ever wonder why solid state amps aren't as popular and why so much effort goes into tube emulators?)

On my stereo, vinyl sounds better (subjective) than even 48k WAV files.  The digital files just seem to lack depth and come out kind of sterile.  With better DAC encoders and filters could that be improved?  Probably, but a nice needle and nice speakers do everything I'd want.  

Digital is not nearly as bad as when CDs first came out, but vinyl is worth the effort and hassle to me.  When CDs first came on the scene they were harsh and tinny because they were mastered like LPs (ie, didn't account for the low boost).  Then they got loud and brick walled when people got better at it which was bad I in the opposite way.  Now I think some people are figuring out the baby bear porridge level of db, but my impressions of the medium for years was, ""this is awful"".  Conversely, I can listen to an LP from the 50s and it is just as lush and competitive as a modern record.  Those first CD impressions just soured me

At the end of the day, I don't really care what's more ""true"" or bitrates or fidelity or whatever.  I think you're losing the forest for the trees if listening is just a numbers game it no matter what side you're on."

By and large no one is listening to vinyl on bluetooth earbuds, which makes EVERYTHING sounds terrible"
AskReddit,ff9cvll,t1_ff9az3n,1579710173.0,"Yes and no.

While a lot of records digitally mastered at 44k (CD quality) and might lose the tiniest bit of fidelity through that process, the way the sound is stored and reproduced by the stylus and amplifier compensates by boosting the bass and low mids because not every part of the frequency is reproduced linearly.  While mastering engineers try for a flat fidelity response, this is where the warmer tone that vinyl aficionados talk about comes from.  Earliest digital files also sounded harsh because there was some clarity that people weren't accustomed to hearing.

So yes: higher rate files (ie, making the spaces between digital ones and zeros smaller) definitely comes closer  to the best analog gear's fidelity and certainly has a better signal to noise ratio (to the point where no one's going to be able to argue one is necessarily better than the other because our ears aren't that good)

My records sound better than played back files because my records are played back on a full stereo and I usually play back files on earbuds.  I do love the low mids push that my vinyl records have too.  It's entirely subjective at this point
