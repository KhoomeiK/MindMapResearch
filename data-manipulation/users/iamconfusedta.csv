This post is simply how I feel, personally. I did not once tell anyone or imply they should kill themselves. You are misinterpreting this as something it is not. 

This subreddit is meant for venting and support. I simply expressed how I felt about that phrase and others feel the same."

The resource you're referring to is The Egg by Andy Weir. I find it oddly unsettling. Look, I don't mind living forever, as long as I don't realize that I'm living forever. If I knew I was living forever then I would probably get bored. There NEEDS to be a reset. 

And reincarnation makes the most sense. I don't know. I just don't see how we can just go from experiencing something to not experiencing anything? That makes no sense. It cannot make sense. If we can't be conscious of ""non-consciousness"", then our consciousness never truly ceases to exist."

I don't really believe in a void because our consciousness can't experience nothingness. No one has experienced nothingness. So if we use that information, then that means that we will never actually die. We become something else. That's just how I see it. Dreamless sleeps feel really quick, so billions of years could feel like 1/1000 of a second while we're gone. Just like before we were born. Supposedly billions of years passed.

lawofattraction,fdnd0ft,t1_fdnbkmh,1578583165.0,"Arrgghh I believe you. I believe that it helped you.

There's a lot going on here. I have a list of reasons why my life is already over to me. One of the biggest ones is music repels me now. I used to love it, but now I can't listen to it voluntarily, it just brings me pain (a lot of it from nostalgia). Same goes with watching Netlfix or something. Even playing piano, something I used to be passionate about, makes me angry. I cannot bear to hear the sound of me playing anymore. 

And music/visuals are EVERYWHERE. When I'm out in public, it hurts. I just want to put earplugs in and be blind. I honestly HATE it. I hate music now. I have to cancel my Spotify subscription because I cannot listen to music anymore. i wonder how that can ever be fixed, through therapy or through Neville. I just don't know. Each time I try to listen to music it just brings me misery. It's torture. I miss it, but I cannot do it anymore.

I also have other circumstances which make my life fucking worthless and irredeemable. I have lost everything. 

I dunno. I guess I feel like I could go on forever about it. Every time I think about how my life could be better, I know it'll never be as good as it once was. I destroyed the things that made me who I am and now there's nothing left. I know no one wants to encourage suicide but I wish that sometimes people would just tell me to go do it. Because I'm so sick of this reality. 

I would start all over, I guess. I don't know how that's worse. I already learned the lessons because of how undesirable the outcome was. Now I will never be able to fix it. This has a lot to do with people I have lost and how I basically when from riches to rags."

It seems too good to be true. And it seems manipulative. I really would like to push the magic button and make everything okay, but I also know that it doesn't work like that. And I know Neville's teachings kind of lean towards eventually getting there. But what I want now honestly seems impossible. I have signed up for counseling and I'm just ready for it not to help. I've gone to walk in clinics and I have not gotten anywhere with my thinking. 

I'm just wishing I could go back in time. I really cannot go forward anymore! That is why death feels like the greatest option."

SuicideWatch,fcu6fuv,t3_eiy2oy,1577973688.0,"I love this topic. There are so many theories and opinions.

For me, there is no ""consciousness of being unconscious"". Think about a dreamless sleep. Time can pass so incredibly quickly. Because we aren't aware that we're asleep, usually that time can pass almost instantly.

Think about how you've always felt like you've been here. When you were born, when you had your first memory, did it feel like you knew were incarnated into this world? Probably not.

Where does that consciousness come from? At least, in theory, billions of years passed before you were born and you never had to wait for that, so an infinite amount of time can pass after you die in an instant. And I just don't think, with having zero consciousness of the unconscious, that you can die. 

I'm getting kind of spiritual here I guess, but I genuinely believe that you will always be conscious, but you might not ever be aware of your past lives. The brain is your filter for consciousness. There is no real ""you"". 

So I do believe in some kind of reincarnation/rebirth and multiverse. I subscribe to any theory that involves afterlife because I think it's impossible to just not exist.

A lot of it is perception. Because you are aware of time passing as you are alive and awake, then things move at regular speed. Die and you basically travel through time. So maybe we're all living in our own universes at our own speeds/perception. Because it's weird to picture everyone's timelines moving at the exact same speed for everyone (from my perspective)."
