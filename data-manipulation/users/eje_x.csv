I would definitely try and get a copy of his death certificate, where are you located? I'm in the UK so the procedures here will be different.  But finding the official cause of his death would certainly be a good starting point, as you can decide from there whether you think it warrants more investigation. Obviously I'm not disputing your story, but if the sandwiches are relevant, could there have been a possibility he was allergic and went into anaphylactic shock or had he had peanuts before?"
aww,ffy66jr,t3_evv5dz,1580339319.0,Walter you are so handsome!

Simple things like making her dinner, or doing something you know she's interested in, I'm not sure of her interests but she sounds really social so I'm sure just you being with her will be a great comfort"

relationships,ffxk3p8,t3_evrngg,1580326749.0,"Just be there for her the best you can, make sure she eats, encourage her to share memories of her friend with you. You could make a photo book/scrapbook together if she has photos from holidays etc. Get her to write down some of her favourite memories of her friend. It's amazing that you're there to support her through this very sad time. I would also encourage her to reach out to her remaining friend - they are both grieving and may find comfort in each others friendship more than ever. I lost my dad very suddenly when I was 18, and just having someone there helped me to cope with the shock. If you could stay with her for a few days I'm sure she would appreciate your company. Sending love x"
