AskWomen,ffd6fbz,t3_eswj5k,1579814327.0,"I have a friend who did this and it really backfired. She was away from her friends and family. Things became violent and she had no one to turn to. She was in this abusive relationship, experiencing conjugal violence daily. She is lucky she and her son managed to leave that situation. 

I am so glad that she is safe and back in contact with everyone."

mentalillness,ff77i1p,t1_ff6or8u,1579642643.0,"Its like burn out but it happens when you are offering emotional support. It comes with feelings of guilt, not wanting ro ve a burden, low energy. It usually happens to helping professionals and caretakers but it sounds like this is the role you are trying to take with your friends. Except therapists have training and teams that help them avoid giving too much of themselves and how to self care wgen they are overwhelmed.

You cannot pour from an empty cup. 

1. You are not their therapist you are their friend.
2. Your problems are just as valid as anyone else's.
3. If your  friends don't want to hear about your problems you are in a one sided relationship and you need to discuss your needs with them."

When my ptsd was really badl my psychologist gave me the homework or finding one thing I could do autonomously that I enjoyed. It lead to me painting water colours at a cafe for 2-6 hours every week after my psych appointment. I became friends with the staff, but its was me-time. I would buy a snack fill and espresso cup with water and paint. Sometimes half a painting. Sometimes 2 paintings. I loved it. It helped me be less afraid of others but more importantly made me feel safer when I was alone. Because up until that point i had needed someone to hold my hand so I could leave my house."
socialwork,ff62n0o,t1_ff5w0fv,1579617581.0,"When I did my internship  in psychiatry often we would have patients discharge against medical advice. If they are not evaluated tp be currently a risk to themselves or others, we cannot force them to stay. 

It's unfortunate but the law ties our hands. During my internship, we had a homeless patient who would come in manic psychosis. Be held under p38 for 72 hours sometimes court would mandate that he stay until stabilized others no. He would be discharged to the streets and  be back in 2 weeks after being brought in to the hospital by police on another p38.

This is definitely not the case for OPs patient. I just thought I might be able to shed some light on why the hospital in question may have being sending patients tp your shelter. Its still 100x better for the patient than being on the street which is probably where they were headed because they couldn't be forced to stay."

Sorry kid. Life is gonna hit you hella hard. 

But we are super happy with our career path. The goal was always helping others and we get to do that. Not the same way we assumed we would but still in a powerful way."

AskWomen,fen14ql,t1_femypsw,1579274634.0,I recently realized that I hoard food. I would buy large amounts of things on sale and put them in the freezer and never eat any of it because i was afraid of not having food. Canned foods too. I moved and had to throw away 3 large garbage bags of freezer burnt and expired canned food.
