Not truly Japanese anymore, not totally French, Akira Suzuki, age 64, dedicated her Japanese know-how and her French experience to a tofu (1) ""made in France"". He got his French cultural shock at age 21. Back then, he was an interpret accompanying the national handball team. Bawdy songs (2), midnight baths, hazing, he was not spared from anything. ""I got that curiosity about this Frenchmen's behavior ever since then. I kept my Japanese politeness but France changed my attitude. I talk a lot and I speak to anyone without hesitation.""

"" Life for families of Portuguese descent (or from Portugal to be simpler) is well different from what most Frenchmen picture, notes Marie Dos Santos, geography teacher in Lyon's suburbs. Quite often, when we go home, we are not in Lyon, Paris or elsewhere. We are in Portugal, plain and simple. Every morning, when leaving home, we cross that frontier we created."" That's what Marie Dos Santos poetically expresses by readjusting her black shawl on her shoulder like a fadista. Michel Teixera tells it more directly: ""I am a son of Portuguese migrants and I live in France. So what ? This doesn't mean that I don't speak Portuguese with my parents, that I don't eat cod with potatoes, chorizo, and salpicao, or that I don't know who is the first in the Superliga Portuguesa ! Not a single day goes by without me thinking about my country. I get to live in Portugal by procuration"""

Intelligence did not always correlate with political beliefs.

There is a certain type of intelligence, ""the greek philosopher"" type that confers the ability for dialectical or non-binary thought.
Average people have typically yes/no opinions and it is pretty hard from them to get past their own experience or their feelings about the matter.
More gifted people can handle abstract ideas and be comfortable with a yes and/or no spectrum mapped by a variety of context and perspective.

People that got this intelligence are the cream of political opinion. And they are exactly what the stereotype would expect, indecisive, centrists with some libertarianism, unafraid of controversy, and they have a great bullshit detector (they see through the fake propaganda and empty slogans that lambda people fall for
