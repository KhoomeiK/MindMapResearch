sleep,fe3jw0m,t3_enit6x,1578849921.0,"Like the other comment, a large box fan might be a good option. It works for me and most of the time I sleep through the dump truck outside my window. I live in an apartment on the second floor facing an alley with huge garbage containers and every night between 3-7 am the garbage truck comes and it‚Äôs so loud that it shakes the entire 5 story building and I can sleep through it if I have my box fan on. There‚Äôs a bout 30 feet between me and those containers too so I could literally reach out and touch the garbage truck if I wanted to.

If you do get a box fan, the loudest position is to lie it on the floor facing down.

Also, I‚Äôm not certain on the exact sciences of how the ears work, but I do know that when people wear earplugs, the brain will adjust to the dampened sound and make the ears more sensitive so you might be experiencing something similar with noise cancelling headphones. With a box fan, the brain probably adjusts to the constant noise rather than the compromised ears. So, based on my knowledge, it‚Äôs not always the volume of the sound but a change in sound that alerts the brain something changed. If it‚Äôs been quiet the brain will wake to a loud sound and if it‚Äôs constant white noise the brain will wake up if the white noise disappears. AFAIK the white noise increases the amount of variation in the sound needed for the brain to take it as a sign to wake up (assuming this wouldn‚Äôt be the case with headphones due to the brain becoming over sensitive to different sounds)."

Any show riding on it‚Äôs reputation to remain popular is very far past when it should‚Äôve stopped. I‚Äôd honestly say if you just take the first couple of seasons of each, they‚Äôre equal. 

I think ending Futurama was a good choice otherwise it could‚Äôve ended up like the Simpson‚Äôs where every character is just a shell following a formula to appease die-hard fans (as well as pandering to politics to appease people rather than focusing on what the show was originally for).

Advice,fdpplcj,t3_emk6ce,1578635748.0,"While you might not be going to a top college to get a degree, there are still options for you! Also, you don‚Äôt always have to go to college immediately after high school. I think it would be smart to take some time for yourself to get everything sorted out because I know it can take a long time to recover from rock bottom and when you do pursue further education, you‚Äôll want to be at your best! 

If you decide to go the route if taking some time off, you can do things to boost your college resume like taking relevant classes at your community college (which can sometimes transfer!) or getting relevant volunteer or work experience. You could even take some time to explore other career options. I do recommend staying somewhat busy. When I‚Äôve been in a position of not having a job or going to school I tend to lose all motivation to improve, but at this stage (if your parents are still paying for everything) the world really is your oyster. Also, you could pretty much take as much time as you need. My grandma went back and became a registered nurse at 40, 20 years after she graduated high school and was able to graduate at the top of her class. I believe she went to a state school as well which had a pretty competitive program to my understanding. 

To add to the other comment, I think your first priority should be to quit smoking. Nicotine can wreak havoc on your brain chemistry which can make your mental health much worse. I know addiction (if you‚Äôre at that point) is one of the hardest things to overcome, but if you‚Äôve made it this far I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to manage it!

Also, keep trying to find things that help your depression even if it only makes it 1% better. Also, you could also discuss the possibility of a misdiagnosis. At one point I was also diagnosed with depression and started meds which didn‚Äôt make a difference. I started researching my other symptoms and it turned out I actually have add. A lot of the symptoms like lack of productivity lined up. So, because I wasn‚Äôt being productive, I started to become anxious because I wasn‚Äôt doing any of my hobbies, I would spend the whole day on the couch surfing all of the internet, my room was a mess, etc. basically everything depressed people do but for a different reason. 

Good luck!"

There‚Äôs also a lot of social stigma (or pretentiousness) when it comes to musicians or artists getting dual degrees or switching majors.

You could even focus on the music part more and do 20/80 or something since any playing at this point will make you better. At this stage, the importance of technique is to prevent you from creating bad habits that can hold you back later on. If you have a teacher, a good one will help your technique without taking all the fun out of playing and they will also help you play how you want to play rather than how they want you to play (while still educating you on what the proper performance practice is).

Advice,fdcye8c,t1_fdcvlie,1578288004.0,"You don‚Äôt really know the details of the situation so it‚Äôs not really appropriate that you make judgements on how poorly she treats me as well as my fellow employees based only on what I‚Äôve said in my post. My coworkers have lodged multiple complaints to upper management against this manager in an effort to get her fired due to her abusive behavior and I think the opinion of 10+ people can and will make a difference. 

I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding why you got so defensive about what I say in a situation that I not only know more about but also is making me and many other people absolutely miserable at work. Not everyone is nice y‚Äôknow. Plus, the way she acts actually gets in the way of our jobs. 

Maybe you got so defensive because you relate to her behavior as well? I hope you‚Äôre not like that, but if you are you should also consider seeking treatment. It‚Äôs not always easy to change and, but it‚Äôll be worth it in the end!"
Advice,fdcthwg,t1_fdcnh7l,1578283860.0,"That makes sense. It‚Äôs just frustrating because I‚Äôm generally liked by everyone except my manager and I‚Äôd like to stay if I can because I don‚Äôt mind the actual work and I enjoy talking to my coworkers when I get the chance. Others have also said that they enjoy working with me while also expressing their disapproval with my manager as well which as good because for awhile I thought I was the one causing the strife somehow haha

She‚Äôs extremely insecure, controlling, and manipulative so I feel kind of bad for her even though she demonstrates many of the traits associated with people who are emotionally abusive. Sometimes I wonder how she got to be like that and my only conclusions were that she was abused and became an abuser or has some sort of mental illness that‚Äôs gone out of control. Other than that the only explanation is that she must be some sort of sociopath gone mad with a little power. I really hope she seeks therapy if she isn‚Äôt already :/"

The first one was realizing that I‚Äôll have to take out a loan for college. The second was halfway through my degree when I found out how political it can be. The third was only being able to get hired for minimum wage jobs after college despite having a bachelor‚Äôs degree and having to choose between going hungry or paying off my student loans."
