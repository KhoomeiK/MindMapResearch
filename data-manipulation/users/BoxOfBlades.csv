Inb4 ""it's better than CNN and MSDNC""
no they're equally shit.

>Better economy

For the people at the top. Trump is as big a corporate bitch boy as Obama is.

>more jobs for Americans

Wages are stagnant, this is a distraction from the fact that the purchasing power of the average folk is down

>higher GDP

Those gains aren't going to the people who need it, again, more economy-wanking nonsense

>he's not being hesitant to leave NATO because he knows that we WAY overpay for NATO

Who cares

>US 'friendlier' with North Korea than they were before

This is true, though you're ignoring his many foreign policy blunders, like for example, I don't know, trying to start a war with Iran.

I couldn't care less to argue about immigration and how you've been fearmongered into thinking whatever you think about illegal immigrants. And you can calm down in regards to your right to own a kill button, if ""Socialist Demon"" Obama can serve 8 years and ""fail"" to take them, they aren't going anywhere."

Am I wrong in remembering one of the last things Price said to Elliott, possibly before they last parted, was to destroy WR's project?
