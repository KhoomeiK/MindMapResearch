summonerschool,fffxypt,t1_ffeol0c,1579894241.0,"Tell him to follow up on cc. If you're in comms say you're planning on going in first opportunity so they're ready. Cc is the most obvious indication of when to attack. This is of course harder to learn playing with supports without cc but definitely still doable with practice (ie when nami puts her steroid on you and pressure in, etc.)"
MMA,fffqb45,t1_fffi8pf,1579889482.0,Ya but did you see Conor immediately bring his back leg forward and hit Cerrone hard with his thigh? You can see his head clatter back. Conor's reaction time is really insane.
AskReddit,ffcbbu4,t1_ffbozp6,1579795754.0,Lol wtf is wrong with you guys? Sounds like some Mad Max shit over there.

gifsthatkeepongiving,fem8gjg,t1_fem85fx,1579243571.0,"Don't worry, honey, he's also brought his iPhone speakers so we can hear his shitty metal Spotify playlist mixed with the gym music. Quite the symphony."

gifsthatkeepongiving,fem7nej,t1_fem5su1,1579242693.0,Seriously wtf is with the angry stank face? It's like they're offended you're at the gym while they half ass some awkward pseudo workout dance routine to a Katy Perry song. It would also be nice if Bradley would be so kind as to not hoard every dumbbell from 10-50 and use the fucking adjustable bench as a flat bench to half rep dumbbell presses for 28 minutes.
gifsthatkeepongiving,fem538f,t1_fem0n6w,1579240053.0,So true. They all file in for about a month in droves after work for aerobics classes and then one day half just suddenly disappear like Thanos snapped his fingers.

wholesomememes,fdwzxkv,t1_fdv2sy7,1578763900.0,"Lmao this is why you don't engage with the comment section on posts like this. A silly lighthearted meme turns into, ""your boyfriend doesn't love you and he's a POS!"" real quick."
