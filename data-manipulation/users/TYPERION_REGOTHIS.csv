BeAmazed,ffc0jx0,t1_ffbt45u,1579788434.0,Are last two dogs have been chow mixes and have been nothing but friendly; and not just to family. First was a chow golden retriever mix and our current pup is a chow husky mix.
Damnthatsinteresting,ff4wdi8,t3_erms7i,1579574036.0,Looks like something we ran across on Tantiev IV... except they were 4 meters tall and had carbide tipped tentacles and could run close to 50 meters per second.
EarthPorn,ff3f4tb,t1_ff33kpa,1579539793.0,We'll probably go for Summer. September was beautiful but I'd love to visit during the summer when it is a bit warmer and less rain.
EarthPorn,ff33h14,t1_ff2ps55,1579532709.0,Can confirm. Went last September and I'm already planning a return trip.

dogs,fempmg4,t1_felg6e3,1579265836.0,I agree
dogs,fejkd4w,t1_feio6dr,1579177796.0,"Honestly that's what I keep thinking to myself. If I was a vet and showed up to put a dog down and saw Wyatt I would say ""And why are we putting this dog to sleep??"""
dogs,fejkb72,t1_feiift1,1579177739.0,I may try and take him to my place. He generally doesn't like being somewhere other than his home but I think he could adjust in a few days time. I work close enough that I can go home on lunches and walk him.
dogs,feiagkf,t1_fei20m1,1579133929.0,"Thank you! Using pretty conservative numbers I got a score of 55. If I bump the numbers in a few categories closer to where I think he is were at 60. 

I sent it to my Dad. He went through it and said ""I did one and felt very honest about answers. It was a good score.""

I know that it's hard for them as well and I don't want to cause any added stress to this already stressful situation but i think it's pretty evident that he has a good quality of life still and it would be premature to put him down now. 

I just love my Wyatt dog so much. When it is time, sure; it will be our final gift to him... but he isn't there yet.

Thanks again."
dogs,fei1lmg,t1_fehd6nb,1579128293.0,"What are the ""checklists""? 

Our family dog is 13 and my parents seem to think it is time and have scheduled him to take the long sleep this coming Sunday; yet he is energetic during our walks, he eats, he drinks, he can go to the bathroom by himself and I just feel like it's too soon and it is causing some division among us. 

He lives with my Mom and Dad, and my Dad is out of town for work 3 weeks out of the month so it is just my mom taking care of him besides the daily walk I give him after work. I know she cares for him but I just feel think she's tired of taking care of him. He frequently wants out, then in, then back out (nothing to different than the last 13 years though), sometimes he has trouble sleeping and keeps her up at night and he spends his days following her around the house and won't get settled when he isn't in the backyard and its wearing her down. 

I just want it to be the right time and I feel like he has more in him, am I being selfish?"
plants,feabgad,t3_eo5ixn,1578946625.0,My mom always calls them Alley Flowers; she said they used to be all over the place in Detroit when she was growing up in the 60's. I've been meaning to go downtown with a bag of seeds one spring and spread them all over for years.
