iamatotalpieceofshit,ff0zprs,t1_ff0xa0w,1579473823.0,"1. Let me quote something you said: ""To me, a 'get the fuck away from me' kick could cause *very* serious injuries, *especially* to a chihuahua.""

That would probably be a full force kick, so I didn't change the bloody narrative. I responded to something YOU said.


2. The vet might need the head for a rabies check but you don't just cut off the head of someone's dog after killing it if you'd want to check it for rabies. Especially not if it **isn't your dog**. If you got bit by it then just get a rabies shot at the doctor, no need to cut off it's fuckin head.

And you could also *you know* take the entire body to the vet instead of cutting it's head off."

And so far all smaller dogs I've come across haven't been that aggressive (might just be because their owners actually knew how to train their dog).

But you do have to admit that if a small dog **would** attack you *(it's not confirmed yet if that was the case here)* that you probably wouldn't kick it hard enough to splinter its bones."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff0vlsf,t1_ff0vam1,1579472733.0,Highly unlikely that a small dog would continue after one kick.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff0vhdz,t1_ff0uyo5,1579472691.0,There is a big difference between injuries and serious injuries though.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff0v6xh,t1_ff0u7n6,1579472596.0,You went from decently logical to fucking batshit insane real fuckin quick. We can still argue if the dog even attacked in the first place *because that fuckin isn't even confirmed yet* but here you go the extra mile by saying that if a small dog would attack you 6 times that you'd brutally murder it and then cut off it's head and take the head to a vet. You're sick.

And I don't know if you have any experience with dogs but if you'd make it feel pain when it attacks then chances are high (especially if it's a small dog) that it will immediately cease the attack and start acting threatening or run away or (in the unlucky cases) limp away"
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff0rcwv,t1_ff0qbop,1579471584.0,"So you'd kick a small dog with full force?

You wouldn't kick with the strength to cause it pain, but not really injure it?"

Also when you do feed your dog a vegan diet then you'd have to make sure that they are doing alright and that they don't miss anything that they would need which means that you'd have to spent quite a lot of time monitoring them and you'd have to check their urine acidity.
