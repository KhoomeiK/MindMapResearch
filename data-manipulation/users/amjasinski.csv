A week and a half after I lost my son (stillborn at 37 weeks) my brother visited and he did such a good job at distracting me from my pain that I was smiling, laughing, and holding a normal conversation. 5 minutes after he left I had a breakdown thinking I was a terrible mother for being anywhere close to happy that soon after my loss. Between hormones, medications, and grief, your feelings will be all over the place."

boardgames,ffckrsb,t3_esvl5u,1579801558.0,"I have a very similar issue when I play games with my husband or certain friends. It typically takes a few rounds for me to understand the rules, even if someone has explained them, and by the time I catch on, it's halfway through the game and I'm losing. When I'm in an anxious or depressive mood, losing snowballs and I feel terrible about myself or I feel like I'm being attacked (which I understand is a huge over reaction).

I've developed a few ""defense mechanisms"" against these feelings.

1. For new games, watch a game if possible them jump in on the second round. This helps me observe game play and strategy without any pressure.
2. Find games that lend themselves to some cooperation between players. **Settlers of Catan** style games usually require some trading between players, and other players don't place the robber on someone's territory if that player is already losing. **Between Two Cities** is great for players who like to run their decision by someone else.
3. Find coop games with a great support character or a character with a simple, linear strategy. **Pandemic** is classic; other players will love you if you play Dispatcher or Researcher and they'll readily ask you for help, which limits the choices you have to make. **Yggdrasil** (co-op by Z-Man, not the RPG) is one of my personal favorites and a few of the characters have specific powers that are super useful to the group and give you a direction for each turn."

AmItheAsshole,fcwcyhd,t3_ej90ei,1578022529.0,"NAH - It's sad that your niece and nephew will probably miss your wedding, but it's only one day in your life as a family. Of course you'll miss them being there, but your wedding day will fly by and there will be so many amazing moments that you might not even notice their absence. When I was planning my wedding, I felt bad every time I got a ""no"" RSVP, but on the day of my wedding I barely had time to eat and my husband and I didn't even make it around to all the tables (for reference, we had about 70 guests, mostly family).

Also, at that age they would be old enough to understand that they were missing their sports and they might be noticeably upset at the wedding, which would be miserable for everyone. Unless you planned on them being in the wedding party and highly involved in the day, they would probably resent being told ""Your aunt and uncle really want you there!"" and then only seeing you sporadically throughout the day."

For one thing, your labor is worth a living wage and this is something you do professionally. At least the pet sitting is something that pet owners should factor into their finances, especially when it's a voluntary trip. It might be a little different if they unexpectedly had to go out of town for a funeral or other emergency, but if it's for a cruise, that was a deliberate choice on their part.

Also, you would not be TA if you said no to cleaning for your health. Only truly terrible friends would expect you to clean their house if it was physically harmful to you.

As a side note, I don't know where you're located, but your rates seem really cheap. Unless the market where you live is super inexpensive, I doubt they would find a cheaper rate, so they're probably already getting a below-market price."

introvert,fcnofv6,t3_ei68zo,1577815368.0,"My biggest piece of advise is to always have an exit strategy. I've found that I'm a social ""sprinter"" where I can get to a party and enjoy making my rounds/talking to people for about 15 minutes before the anxiety sets in. I leave my coat on, say I can't stay, and leave after I've said hello to everyone. If I stay much longer I feel anxious and trapped.

Another thing that's helped me for social gatherings that I can't avoid (holidays or family things where I didn't drive) is to bring something that makes socializing less stressful like a small game. I hate making small talk, but I have found that I can play Uno or Yatzee for hours because it helps me focus my attention and no one notices weird pauses in conversation.
