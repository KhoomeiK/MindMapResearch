The recipes I’ve tried so far are still too slow for weeknight cooking, assuming the cook works outside the home. But, you can make giant amounts of food, so if you have a lot of mouths to feed or tolerate eating the same thing repeatedly you can do well with weekend prep. Also, it’s less attention-intensive. I made a chili the other night I usually make on the stove. I didn’t save any time. But, I didn’t have to stir or watch the stove or even stay in the kitchen. 

The rice button works great on mine but it’s a zavor, not an IP. Haven’t tried the other buttons. 

The challenge is the things pressure cookers do well (large pieces of poor-quality meat, giant vats of stew, dishes made from raw beans) are not foods I usually eat. Partly because these are traditionally time consuming and partly because I didn’t grow up eating these things.

Amen! Also it is hard for me to criticize anyone’s social media usage when I have a 25k karma Reddit account. I spend a lot hours here!"
AskMenOver30,fcb982p,t3_ef4ovu,1577584010.0,"I've been through at least two big moves as an adult (one in mid mid 20s, one in my mid 30s, about 5 years ago) and in both cases [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) worked wonderfully for both me and my wife. We joined some groups that we were interested in, and though the official groups have long since dissolved (they seem to have a 2-3 year lifetime) we've stayed close with a handful of friends in each group. Denver should have a large enough population for it to work (friends moving to small towns report that there are not enough people online to form a critical mass)."

Well yeah, every generation has its own ways of communicating, and Facebook and its users grew up together so the aesthetic and the language evolved with and are matched to the original users. When I was younger I was not pleased when the olds started signing up (originally it was a college student only thing). Then I woke up and I was myself old!

Seriously though, Facebook is only one platform. More interesting is how usage trends change overall. As others pointed out, Snapchat, tiktok, etc are very popular. But they’re more ephemeral, which is a legit difference."
DeathByMillennial,fca0fgy,t1_fc98htp,1577560942.0,"As an older millennial, I’ve reduced my Facebook usage dramatically in the last couple years, and this was a big part of it. Connecting with distant loved ones is one thing. Reading people’s repugnant political views is another."

antiMLM,fc8lhzr,t1_fc7u2ji,1577537395.0,I see mostly card tables in there but retail-grade clothes racks aren’t cheap either. I was in a store that was liquidating to where even the racks and hardware had price stickers and they were still hundreds of dollars. Maybe the ones in the pictures were already there though.
antiMLM,fc8kw2o,t1_fc88xx7,1577537039.0,"Or a same-sex partner ... just kidding, MLMs are as old fashioned AF when it comes to that kind of thing. I’m straight so maybe I’m missing the signals, but I haven’t seen any ad copy or hun copy-pastes that are evenly remotely up-to-date about gender, sexuality, or roles."
antiMLM,fc8j2qq,t1_fc88pfq,1577535997.0,"Ours survived by being in a no sales-tax state but on the border (literally: state line is in the parking lot) with a high tax state. It has a jc penny, and a soon to be closed sears. These are always empty. But it also has a few other productive anchors (target, dicks, and Macy’s) — and an Apple store and a coach retail store, for which tax avoidance is definitely worth the drive!

Still, it might die as it loses sears. The mall is always busy but but that’s a lot of rent to lose unless they have another anchor lined up.

Edit: the real loss for me is the sears auto center. They were competent (at least for maintenance) and charged fair prices, neither the cheapest or most expensive. *However*, you could shop at the mall, even get groceries at target, while waiting for your car to be done. Much better than sitting on a rotting chair in a tiny waiting room in the bad part of town."
todayilearned,fc5fq34,t1_fc5dydt,1577456281.0,See [definition 2](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meat). Some  English speakers use the word “meat” used to mean mammals only. “Poultry” it “fowl “ means birds. Mostly this is an older way to speak.

todayilearned,fc54kmn,t1_fc43tvm,1577442829.0,"And this language is odd too. In my grandparent’s generation, and some religious circles, poultry is not meat. Meat specifically means the flesh of animals. You can say you don’t eat meat, and still be served chicken."
antiMLM,fc2kgs7,t1_fc26qnv,1577364762.0,"Forget MLMs, even if I’m just walking the mall people will try to sell me makeup or fragrance from the temporary kiosks or even the beauty sections of legit stores. I’m a nearly 40 year old, conventionally masculine man, and the pitch is always about a woman in my life (wife, mother, daughter) who would love what is being sold. I have no idea about quality or price. I *am*  suspicious that the harder someone has to work to sell something, the less desirable it is — after all, no one is selling iPhones or Coach handbags by yelling at shoppers from mall kiosks. I just decided I won’t buy makeup as a gift. No one has complained."
