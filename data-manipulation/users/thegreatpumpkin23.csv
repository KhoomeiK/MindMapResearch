Well if you meet a horse girl, they are most likely nuts. I'm not sure why they are. Probably bc horses are high maintenance and need special care. They are also expensive creatures so their owners/riders are a bit uptight.

I also try to decide how many days of the week I want to do an activity- snowboarding takes a full day so I can't go on a work day, but I can definitely read at a coffee shop after snowboarding.
