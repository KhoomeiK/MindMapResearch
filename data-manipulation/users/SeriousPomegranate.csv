AskReddit,ffus5zu,t3_evalzw,1580248345.0,"There are two parts to this question. Why can't we call a global ceasefire and why can't we address climate change?

We would never be able to call a global ceasefire and the reasons why would depend on the cause of the conflict and who was involved. Reasons would range from religious or political belief and oppression to border disputes to arms markets helping conflict. 

We can't address climate change for other reasons though politics and religion do also factor into it. Primarily, it's financial. It costs a lot to make the necessary changes and has huge consequences on mining, agriculture and other industries at all levels. No one wants to swap comfort, convenience and financial security with effort and risk.
I rarely hear anyone mention the 1000s of jobs lost if an industry took a risk to change and failed. People at both the top and the bottom have an interest to protect their income.

I personally do not think a ceasefire is necessary to address and plan for climate change as we've managed to do so during conflict and have been capable of more despite it. Conflict here sounds like a scapegoat. Blaming warfare for why we have not done more. 

It would be amazing if we could stop global conflicts, even if just temporarily but it won't cause a radical change to climate action."

This is a rough outline of what those in each generation may have been taught. It is also not a representation of the entire world or even the entire English speaking world. It contains facts that may only be valid in one or two countries unless otherwise stated. Everyone is taught different things but the overall idea of learning over generations applies to everyone)

The fact that one of the generations before us had so little. The parents of Baby Boomers, those who were born and grew up during WW1 and WW2, experienced financial depression and rationing at some stage. Food, textiles and metals all needed rationing and in some places and times, it didn't matter how wealthy you were, if the rations didn't allow it then you didn't get it. This gave an entire generation the belief we should be thankful for what little we get. To them, this world of excess means we have none of the complaints they had. If we want sugar or coffee we can buy it freely and expect the same the next day.  

This was passed onto their children, Baby Boomers, who grew up post-war when everything needed to be rebuilt. They learned that they were so fortunate to have their basic needs met and that they should be glad for everything in excess of that. You also have some parents who prepare for the worst again by becoming frugal. Mental illness was not widely understood by the general public and real help was non-existent. The behaviours we might associate with mental illness and coping mechanisms would at best be dismissed as odd, immoral or lazy and at worst get you institutionalised. Many attempts to study and understand mental illness during this time and the duration of Gen-X are rather barbaric (1940s to 1980s).

These values get taught to the next generation. Gen X's learned that they should be grateful for what they have. Some parents are overcompensating for the frugal nature of their parents. Differences in wealth mean some get more than others and gives some an impression that the wealthy should have fewer complaints than those poorer. Mental illness is slowly starting to be understood better but that knowledge is slower to reach the general public. During this time we see many attempts to change our ideas and beliefs about society. I believe but have no evidence that around the time Gen X started we stopped talking about the past as a reason to be grateful but to other parts of the world. This may have started phrases like, ""There are starving children in Africa/Asia""

Enter Gen Y, now known as Millenials, who are third in the line of this Chinese whispers of values. Many were taught to be grateful for what they have, like others before them, and that the wealthy should stop complaining as they're born with more than they could ever need. They were also raised with a better understanding of mental health than prior generations (though this is not universal). This has led some Millenials to have misunderstood both mental illness and the lives of wealthy people at some point in their life. 

So over time, we've slowly changed a value created from wartime pressure by incorporating newer beliefs and values. Each new generation gets the message of ""be thankful your basic needs are filled"", ""be grateful for all the stuff you have"" and ""it could be worse"" but it's twisted slightly by current events and culture of those around them. This is what's giving us a multi-generational misunderstanding of mental health but everyone has varied and sometimes contradicting beliefs about why *our* view of it is correct."
