Showerthoughts,ff2apib,t1_ff28qh6,1579498910.0,I remember that growing up in Vista. You had to deposit a quarter at Price Club(pre-Costco) for your cart.

xsr900,fejvnzm,t3_ep96i7,1579186911.0,"Some people have swapped the stock halogen for a 5.75"" LED replacement. I'm currently looking for a 7"" housing that I can use with the Morimoto 7"" LED light I picked up a while back.

I believe this is one people have used in the stock housing. https://www.twistedthrottle.com/denali-m5-dot-led-headlight-module-5-75-round-black-chrome"

trashy,feewxh2,t1_feeu9o3,1579042997.0,"Honestly, I'll probably work here until I retire if I can. Pay isn't quite as high as the private sector since we're state employees, but good benefits. We've got about 35k students on our campus so there's always something to do, but I can't say I've ever really felt stressed."
trashy,feeb5sf,t1_fed8hz1,1579030142.0,I work in FacMan for a university and we definitely have dummy thermostats in some offices. Give the inhabitants the satisfaction of thinking they turned it up.

aww,fdpi1wa,t1_fdphew4,1578629187.0,Cavalier King Charles spaniels as well.
aww,fdphzdl,t1_fdphuql,1578629134.0,I think they're talking about them being bred for a certain form/build rather than working hardiness.

Music,fdj6zid,t3_elkckx,1578460212.0,"I still remember how ironic it was that this song came on my iPod shortly after takeoff while riding on a C-130 on my way out of Iraq back in '06. We weren't in Baghdad, but we did get hit with mortars every single day."
boulder,fd0klvx,t3_ejs4lh,1578120164.0,"That's a private company, and well known around here to be massive cockholsters, so they likely won't give a damn that the date is wrong. Doubt they'll remove the boot without trying to squeeze money out of you, but you could show them your pass and tell them to take the damn thing off."
boulder,fcuot5q,t1_fcugs5s,1577985514.0,"Louisville is barely cheaper than Boulder. I've been watching the houses in my neighborhood by the Louisville Rec(houses built in the early 70s) and they're all going for 600-700+. Nice and quiet, but not cheap these days."

modernwarfare,fcl7poh,t1_fckezwd,1577741612.0,Just got my launchers platinum. Personal Radars count towards that challenge.

boulder,fckm469,t1_fcawl71,1577728307.0,"Not to mention that the actual amount of funding from the state is something ridiculously low, like 5% of the total budget."
boulder,fckjqbs,t1_fckeqhh,1577726835.0,The stadium is actually very well used outside of sporting events. The amount of offices and trade shops based out of it are busy year-round. We also had issues recently with people getting into unauthorized areas and rummaging around and taking items.

After getting Dark Matter the last two games I bought, Damascus just isn't worth the grind to me. Not going to force myself to play with guns I despise in a game I'm losing interest in quickly."
modernwarfare,fcdkms3,t1_fccmako,1577610915.0,"Guilty. It's been my go-to ""You annoyed me, so I'm gonna annoy you"" weapon choice since MW2. The most satisfying rage I ever heard was an across map building-to-building shot with one on Highrise because I knew exactly where my friend sniped from, and apparently he was a couple kills away from a nuke."

modernwarfare,fcam22i,t1_fcaj7k7,1577571925.0,"Jumping and drop shotting. I know it's been a thing since forever, but if you're going to instantly flop onto your belly, you should suffer an aim penalty."
modernwarfare,fcalqj3,t1_fcab31j,1577571741.0,"I wasted a bit of time trying that. The Personal UAV still counts for ground streaks though. I gotta say, I'm pretty disappointed with how my platinum RPG looks though."

Now, the one who named her kid Xion Riddim(because the dad is a jungle DJ) fits the stereotype."

Justrolledintotheshop,fbydiv7,t3_eeninv,1577214178.0,I think my '84 has done maybe 100 miles in the last 15 years. Need to get out to the garage and drop the fuel tank for a reseal this afternoon.
