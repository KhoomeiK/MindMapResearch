offmychest,ffhtqws,t3_etpbir,1579953458.0,You can always start again.
ededdneddy,fffhysa,t1_fffh8zr,1579884363.0,Thanks man
thesurgegame,ffcs9ev,t3_esut2i,1579806210.0,Damn that looks straight outta Armoured Core
SaintsRow,ff8z9oo,t3_esb3gz,1579700748.0,I remembered coming from GTA IV and being so hyped that the steering wheel actually moved in SR3. Loved it so much first game I ever got a Platinum in.
GodofWar,ff6mb27,t3_erslf3,1579630241.0,This is pretty sick
thesurgegame,ff5hwxe,t1_ff56u57,1579593644.0,Lol ye. Every other area is fine just when I kill those shield drones.
thesurgegame,ff0zkkg,t1_ff0ptix,1579473774.0,Thanks
PS4,fezdvej,t3_eqwrpw,1579456330.0,"You have to add some material to the plastic head that the analog sits on and presses, its best to add some really small stickers or a piece of thin cardboard to help the stick make contact with the plastic peg. Always try just cleaning it though and see if that helps."
PS4,fezd997,t1_fez8esh,1579456137.0,"I just attempted this cleaning process of both contact surfaces with 99% alcohol and it barely made a difference. But I realised that some games just have really low deadzones or none at all. e.g. my stick drift is crazy on SR4 but on any other game it’s not even noticeable. Give it a go but in my case I just dinged up my case as the controller did not want to come apart but the controller is working fine. Might be just the plastic wearing out as it is a year old. 

(Some games make the stick drift appear a lot worse than what it actually is)"
codevein,femy2i1,t3_epvx4f,1579272567.0,You feel like a badass when you can run through it in one go on the second or third play through
SaintsRow,fegd8ar,t1_feafjtx,1579088509.0,"If you’re having fun with any product regardless if it is a bad representation of the fandom then it’s a good thing objectively, since you’re enjoying it. I  wouldn’t call it meaningless as it provides something positive to the player. I’m not speaking for the rest of the fans but even though SR4 is a far cry from SR2 (the one regarded by many as the best one) it’s still a fun game deserving some praise."
memes,fe8wgeu,t3_eo1wfe,1578931833.0,Why did Netflix remove this. It was perfect and didn’t have that laughing track every time something funny happened.
SaintsRow,fe4dsrt,t1_fe4cb60,1578858228.0,Well guess I can’t complain then even more given that I only payed £3.99 for it.
PS4,fdw4tr2,t1_fdvpb7l,1578755070.0,Really useful stuff here. Thanks I’ll see what works for me
PS4,fdvitsw,t1_fdvi89u,1578747881.0,Ye I might just try air blasting the area first. The stick doesn’t feel crunchy or anything right now.
PS4,fdvg4z3,t1_fdvfzcj,1578747110.0,Alright Thanks for that.
PS4,fdvfn17,t1_fdvfl4m,1578746934.0,Sweet. Thanks.
PS4,fdvfgwf,t1_fdvfbhe,1578746862.0,Did you have to take part the controller or just sprayed some in the gap?
pornfree,fdllu4l,t3_elyv3h,1578526941.0,"My advice from personal experience is to do something else you enjoy and keeps you busy preferably with other people. I remember when GTA heists came out I had so much fun with my friends I didn’t even consider the thought of watching anything else. Also stuff like finding an anime series or TV show you really like and watching that when you’re free or bored is really good too. Thanks to video games, anime and other cool shit I don’t do it nearly as much as I would before. Also I don’t think that out right stopping is the solution for everyone unless you’re a serious addict who can’t function without it. “Everything is fine, in moderation”"

PS4,fddmvxu,t1_fdcsaa6,1578318146.0,Alright Thanks
PS4,fdb5u0s,t1_fdanqbo,1578254116.0,Was wondering about this as my controller recently got mild stick drift. Do I have to take part my controller then apply the alcohol or can I just drop a small amount into the gaps in the analogue sticks?
Animemes,fcydub4,t3_eje14y,1578078589.0,This is why I hold off on watching an emotional anime until I have a week off or know I’m gonna have a lot of alone time.
RedvsBlue,fcso9vk,t1_fcsmc59,1577920962.0,Ye seeing the quality and animations improve was really cool too.

Witcher3,fcqwdox,t3_eii0ub,1577893223.0,I remember losing a game of gwent to this lad.
DeathStranding,fcqr4rj,t3_eigsvr,1577890894.0,Weird hearing him without pressing the touchpad.

mac,fcgnv4c,t3_eh6y4f,1577642217.0,Incredibly robust machines the one I’m using now was second hand from a college and after a cleanup and fresh install of Snow Leopard it’s been running strong for years now.
offmychest,fcgni7u,t3_eh4zqb,1577642063.0,Agree with you 100% people like that no matter your relation to them are bad people and should be cut out. Good luck with whatever you have going on.
