Divorce,fg465f6,t3_eljoip,1580496960.0,"I need this today!
Talking to someone that doesn't want to listen in the first place is just like talking to wall. Because they just wanted to be understand, but they refused to understand you."
aww,fg42pim,t3_ewnexf,1580494914.0,Such a good boy!
caffeine,fg2mz27,t1_fg2l05k,1580448522.0,"Yikes!

My body can't handle that anymore.
I used to be able to work 16 hours sleep for 2 or 3 hours and work another 16 hours shift. Now I can't do it anymore. It sucks getting old"
caffeine,fg0m95a,t1_fg0ju6v,1580410626.0,Sounds good! Thanks
caffeine,fg0m5tr,t1_fg00yzz,1580410573.0,No possible for nap. I wish I could. I will get sugar free Redbull. Thanks for the advice
caffeine,fg0m1lq,t1_fg02q7v,1580410508.0,I'm so fucked. I'm working 12 hours today. I worked between 2 jobs.

SingleAndHappy,ffvvj39,t3_eae369,1580274519.0,OMG! This is awesome!
SingleAndHappy,ffvva9e,t3_en607n,1580274303.0,"I cope with watching new TV series. I saw some friends.
I cook whatever I want. Eat whatever I want. I crocheted some blankets for my friends and for myself.
I make plan and manage my new place. 
I read some books that I want to finish.

When I feel lonely, I would sit down and just cry and let the feeling stay with me as long as it likes. Believe it or not, I feel better after that.

I invited people over and cook together as well to my new place.

I talk to my family over the phone for hours and ask how is everything in their life. I make a lot of new connection.

I also improve my relationship with my sister by calling and talking to her almost every day. I talk to my nieces as well.

I learned to meditate longer. I do more exercise as well."
SingleAndHappy,ffvuv1d,t3_eohoco,1580273936.0,"It's hard. I have nightmares sometimes dying alone and just the loneliness creeping in my sleep.
And I woke up, and said to myself, ""hey I'm already alone. I don't think it is that bad.""

When I spend so much time with other people, I got so tired. And I'm missing my alone time. It's pretty weird.

At least I'm also relax because I don't have to worry about other things or other people in my life."
narcissisticparents,ffuxlk8,t3_ev89up,1580251273.0,Don't know what to trust anymore. Should we trust our own individual or them?
