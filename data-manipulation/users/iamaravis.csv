I was just noticing that despite this thread being about how women over 30 can still be attractive, the way your comment was worded reminded me that so many people then think 30s to be the cutoff for female beauty. 

If we’re trying to show that that’s not the case, shouldn’t we be saying “some of the most beautiful women in the world are in their 40s” or “in their 60s” or even “over 30”. Saying that they’re “in their 30s” just seems to barely extend the normal range of perceived beauty, and it gave me a sense that some then think, “wow, she’s still beautiful despite her advanced age” of 30-something, when 30s is still so young.
