It’s information I never needed to have. I wouldn’t expect anyone to wait to end their suffering for something like that; it’s incredibly selfish and I own that. Like I said, I hold nothing against her for doing what she did. The whole situation just sucks. And I hate that I know what I know."
AskReddit,femhavu,t3_eptxb3,1579255508.0,"After my paternal grandmother died, my mother felt the need to tell me that she in essence killed herself. She had her feeding tube removed so she could end it. I understand why she did it and I don’t blame her at all. (My grandmother that is. My mother can go to hell for telling me that.) But.  I was away at college. I was coming home in about three weeks. At the time I thought it was just shit timing. But now. Now I’m left asking myself why she didn’t wait. Why couldn’t she wait to see me? She wasn’t able to talk anymore so they just held the phone to her ear while I talked to her and told her about school and friends and stuff. They said she always smiled when I called and it made her day better. So why didn’t she wait? Or was my mother just lying about that??"

My favourite lines of hers (albeit not from Bring Me To Life) are “everyone leaves me stranded, forgotten, abandoned, left behind” and “here in the darkness I know myself”"

Your practice piece is awesome though. I’ve never been that good at stuffed animals and I really admire those who can whip them up like that."
