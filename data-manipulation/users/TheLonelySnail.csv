3- the shelter pays for food and litter for the family
4- you raise them babies until they are 8-12 weeks old depending on shelter

I grew up in Anaheim, where Disneyland is. All of the entertainment, the busses, the movie theaters etc all revolve around the hive that is Disneyland. Heck the freeways and major streets basically point at the park. 

Naturally, me and many of my friends and family had annual passes because it just made sense. It was close, it was safe, it was family friendly. 

Because if this, many of my fondest memories happened at Disneyland. From going to eat before prom (thanks Rainforest cafe) to getting to second base the first time (thanks Haunted Mansion) to just going somewhere where my Dad couldn’t drink alcohol (thanks for the dry policy). So much is wrapped up there. 

Even now, I don’t have kids, my sister doesn’t have kids and we still go - all the dang time. Sure it can be overpriced crud, but is it any more overpriced than going to the movies, or buying more shoes or a myriad of other things. 

It’s a place to meet, to have fun, to create memories and remember old ones.
