I calculate (and estimate my own bf% before) how much fat I'd have to lose if my lean mass would stay the same (which sadly never happens). Then I calculate how much calories those kgs of fat have. Based on that number, I calculate how much calory deficit days on -300kcal or -500kcal I would need. And then I cut. But that's assuming you want to keep muscles when you cut. If you just want to lose weight there are way faster ways."
Fitness,ffqytxr,t1_ffqv3b6,1580146707.0,Muscle mass plays no role in calculating the BMI. Also cardio will usually burn more calories than weight training. Makes not a lot of sense what he is suggesting. Would make sense if the FFMI played a role.
Fitness,ffpg9d9,t1_ffp0dq2,1580094301.0,You sound more like 14-16%. With 12% you'd have good visible abs already. Most percentages on the internet are just way off so I get where you're coming from. Your progression is also highly dependent on where your current level is and not only if you bulk or not. 100kg at 190cm/82kg is not a lot and since you have so much room to improve you can easily increase strength at maintenance. Once you hit a plateau for some weeks you can think of bulking.

Fitness,ffmu2zl,t1_ffluz8z,1580058911.0,Depends on your goals. If you do too much cardio and stay the same with the calories  your deficit is too high and you'll risk to lose more muscle during the diet or to just feel like shit and cheat on your diet. I guess 500-700kcal deficit will still be ok. So you either eat more and do cardio or do just a little cardio.

Fitness,ffmqsgv,t1_ffmo7yf,1580057938.0,"Depends on. I eat the same stuff every day and when I bulk I just add some extra food.

Fitness,ffi05br,t1_ffhzo5w,1579960985.0,You should just rest (no exercises) because your abs stabilize in a lot of stuff you'd never think of and it's not worth fucking up your surgery just because you're afraid to lose some muscle you can regain easily because of muscle memory. Also if you eat at a surplus you'll obviously have to lose that fat but I think you'll lose less muscle. I don't think it's worth since personally I think it's easier to regain the muscle mass then lose the fat. So maintenance. Machines are good to get back in.
Fitness,ffhzv0z,t1_ffhyolt,1579960702.0,Depends on your goals. You want to look more muscular? Then you eat at maintenance because you're like 22% bf already. Not much room to bulk.

There are also other variants (sitting and raising) which are even easier but there needs to be equipment for that. If you can put out 6 (bended knees) without swinging it's already good and you can improve from there.
