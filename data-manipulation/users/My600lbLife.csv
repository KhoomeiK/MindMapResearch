gifs,fc77f39,t1_fc751y7,1577499535.0,"I've never known someone to die from this. You could, I suppose, from punctured lungs via broken ribs or maybe a broken neck if the horse were to land just the right way. The worst I've seen is a broken back which is pretty damn bad in its own right, but the rider lived and was fortunately not paralyzed."
gifs,fc7788h,t1_fc7314g,1577499394.0,"Ah, no. This was the rider's fault. That's a pretty nasty leverage bit she's using which adds what appears to be about three times the amount of pounds per pressure from the hands via the reins. You can see how tightly she's pulled those reins. The horse was looking for a way to escape that pressure and when she doesn't let up, he simply decided that up and/or over was the only choice left. 

This behavior is usually the rider's fault and isn't usually for the purpose of removing the rider. I've seen this happen a handful of times and almost every time it was due to this kind of a heavy hand."

I don't understand why you seem to think that any man who wants to gift his partner a ring of any real monetary value must have been shamed by someone at some point into feeling the need to do so.
