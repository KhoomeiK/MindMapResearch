Even though refrigeration speeds up the recrystallization of starches in bread, freezing does not, said Reid. She said the water moves within the bread when it's in the fridge, but not [when it's in the freezer.](https://www.insider.com/how-to-store-bread-2019-2)

You can see all your collected [Google data](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/162744?hl=en) same as Apple.  Siri and Google Assistant are pretty much the same thing.  Most people are just using the Assistant with voice instead of an easily pressable button.  I don't see the difference.  Especially since Apple does sell your data to 3rd parties.  One of those situations directly correlates with our discussion!  Safari is set up by default to route web searches through Google which has paid over 20 million dollars over the last 2 years to do so.
