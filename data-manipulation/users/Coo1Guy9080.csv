instant_regret,ff49eou,t1_ff47otz,1579558415.0,i can actually see this tbh. i doubt she knows anything about electricity.
instant_regret,ff49cqx,t1_ff47u4m,1579558381.0,"i don’t think she knew what she was doing bc first her hair isn’t tied back, second she didn’t have protective clothing or glasses, third, you should know what two live wires would do when they touch. yeah idk what she was doing."

technology,fdzm0kc,t1_fdzli3v,1578791529.0,"idk what you’re taking about, yeah i get it, it’s not like android where it’s open source, idk what your problem is? i mean i can search the internet, use social media. i don’t know what you mean? do you want to modify your phone? jailbreak? yeah i guess go ahead assist those who are already doing that."
technology,fdxw3u6,t1_fdxfd1v,1578773472.0,yes because it’s their product?

technology,fdx6vas,t1_fdwwsxs,1578765925.0,"i don’t think you can because if you want to connect an external usb to the iphone it will require you to unlock first before using it, so no information will pass to the iphone if locked. Big brain"

YouShouldKnow,fdg80mc,t3_ekxas8,1578383893.0,what the? Gifs seem to be lower quality than regular standard video. which most of the time are 720p how can this bs be? time to disable gifs
AskReddit,fdeiprd,t1_fdeig0j,1578339873.0,maybe you’re a student who was just studying for finals. and perhaps forgot that you have work tmr? idk i’ve never been late tbh so i know very little about this question.
AskReddit,fdeicuk,t1_fdei52u,1578339658.0,the question states you’re two hours late bc you over slept. this would answer your 2nd question.

Minecraft,fdd6hr5,t1_fdd6eoa,1578296934.0,"i’d suppose you don’t have anything else to say, thus i have won. and yes i suppose a sue is quite far. but it’s hypothetical"
Minecraft,fdd605z,t1_fdd5t6z,1578296307.0,"I’m not saying to downvote all of his posts and comment. just downvote this post. it’s essentially a copy right. if the original user who made this video decide to sue this person, then they would have a high chance of winning because it is their content. plus this person took the other persons content without their permission (knowing this bc they have called out their scandal) and is gaining karma points from someone else’s work."

Minecraft,fdd57s5,t1_fdd571f,1578295327.0,it’s not like you’re going to know if it’s this persons oc
Minecraft,fdd53ru,t1_fdd4yxr,1578295184.0,"but the person does not give credit. the person who made the video gave credit to himself. i wouldn’t have know if this is oc or not. plus people can have different IGN like me. I have coolguy9080, Moca, Mocassleepyhours, and Moca is on Drugs."
Minecraft,fdd4ws7,t1_fdd3brj,1578294937.0,It is stealing because this person did not give credit. but then again didn’t claim. yet is getting karma from this.
Minecraft,fdd4uuo,t3_ekdlqa,1578294872.0,Stealing is bad. Now have a downvote.
hardwareswap,fdd3jhv,t3_eklqlr,1578293312.0,bruh i was hoping this was shipped. saw it’s asking for nothing but then states that it has to be local. sad times to be poor

instantkarma,fcwccdj,t1_fcwc2zf,1578022120.0,i’d assume this person has had enough shit and decided to fuck those people who disagree with him. that’s my guess.
hardwareswap,fctu7rs,t3_eitghr,1577959769.0,Bro this is quite epic. would for sure want one.
PewdiepieSubmissions,fcprm9c,t1_fcpfv6s,1577870634.0,i’m wondering what the heck that is on the top right.

dankmemes,fc2arl4,t1_fc27eu8,1577349122.0,How so? Explain the difference in which samsung is better than iPhone. Because you state that android is better in every single way. State them all please? (Note: I do not support this claim nor support Apples claim.)
