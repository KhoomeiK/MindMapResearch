todayilearned,fcb2p42,t1_fcb2620,1577581523.0,"Of course. When I say no style I mean it doesn't peach heavily right or heavily left.

I mean they may target certain people, but certain people are just easy or fun to make fun of. For example trump. He has the hair and all of his unusual mannerisms."
todayilearned,fcb2dgc,t1_fcay5q6,1577581387.0,"I suppose your right in some ways. It's been forever since I watched the earlier seasons. When a show like Southpark is very heavily lead by two people their own political views get reflected a bit. However imo the show bats you on the head with political issues more than Futurama, family guy, American dad, Rick and morty, etc. 


South park is more akin to a slightly right leaning center political show. Also sometimes the show contradicts political messages talked about earlier on in the show. You can't take the show too seriously.


It's not as preachy in terms of left or right as similar political humor shows like snl for example which takes a heavy left slant."
todayilearned,fcb16ju,t1_fcb0u0u,1577580679.0,Lol no problem
todayilearned,fcb15nx,t1_fcaxf6d,1577580664.0,"Trey parker and Matt stone did come out as Republicans a little while ago if that means anything.


Also iirc the trump saying don't vote for me was a setup so they could mock Hillary's ""robotic"" responses in debates. However to be fair at the time the trump campaign did wind down fundraising, and that usually indicates they don't think they are going to win.


The issue with South park is sometimes the episodes are a bit too relevant for a small amount of time so they age horribly. 

Like I said earlier, I enjoy their no side style. It's all a matter of taste as comedy is subjective."
todayilearned,fcb0i4b,t1_fcawdo2,1577580253.0,"Like I said earlier, I enjoyed Futurama. The thing is, I grew up watching South park (I was around 13 when it came out) so I have a bit of nostalgia towards it. Where as imo Futurama didn't go on long enough to have the same effect for me"
todayilearned,fcb02og,t1_fcav3bk,1577580005.0,"That depends, some of it is very witty, but at the end of the day comedy is subjective. Some people enjoy the style of South park, others enjoy Futurama, and an even smaller amount harass McDonald's employees about szechwan sauce (in all seriousness rick and morty is good, the Fandom did get out of hand with that situation)."
todayilearned,fcazlrg,t1_fcapbcr,1577579746.0,"I partially agree with you. Part of this is due to the fact that after a few seasons they started only making their episodes within a week. This allows them to be very relevant when they air. The issue with this is some episodes age terribly.

I honestly like the centrist view point. It is actually not completely center and has a very slight right wing slant. After all trey parker and matt stone are Republicans. Tbf though it is probably confirmation bias that memes me enjoy it as my views tend to closely align with the show.

Imo I think political humor is best when a side is not picked, because while there are a few south park episodes I disagree with politically, I still enjoy them due to the fact that it is still funny imo. 

Imo making fun of politicians for what they do, or their mannerisms is funny. Making fun of politicians because you disagree with them is not. If you are able to make fun of both sides, it adds a bit of Tegridy to your humor."
todayilearned,fcaouiv,t1_fcaof3y,1577573592.0,"Honestly I would give that to Southpark, but still Futurama is fucking great.

Lately though a lot of Southpark episodes are hit and miss, but overall it has been one of my favorite TV shows period.

Would've loved to see what Futurama would become if it got more seasons though"
