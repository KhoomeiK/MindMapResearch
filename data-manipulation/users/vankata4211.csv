pcgaming,fggelax,t3_ex18ld,1580760239.0,"Hello guys, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for this, but I cannot log into Instant gaming using my google+ account. It opens the window to choose which account to choose from , and after I chose it closed the window without logging in. After that when I try, again,to enter using google+ it just opens a new blank window titled ""connecting to google""  and closes it again.I don't have an account on the site and I don't want to create an account using other emails or facebook. I have never encountered such problem with a site before, the mistake might be in me, not the site.Thank you in advance and sorry if this isn't the right place."

I mean I want a proper relationship and I will have to dedicate time and effort for it , something I'm not confident that I can do at the moment. If it's just for the sake of losing your virginity you can easily do with a one-night-stand , or even a prostitute . But I'm in no rush for things and as a wise man once said ""Love is like a fart, if you force it too much it  will turn out shit""."
