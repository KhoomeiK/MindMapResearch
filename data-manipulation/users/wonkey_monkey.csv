A companion from the far future wouldn't ask those questions and would take everything in their stride like the Doctor does, making them a bit superfluous. A companion from the past would soon bore us with constant questions and astonishment at everyday things.

There are exceptions, of course. Jamie was much loved, but does have a habit of either shrugging and admitting he has no idea what's going on every five minutes, or accepting everything that happens very easily.
