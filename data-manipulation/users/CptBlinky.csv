You really need to check yourself. Trump is a piece of shit, but by the nature of his position as the head of the nation and its military, is not a terrorist.

That's exactly how it works The most vocal ""Christians"" support the antichrist while the true believers begin their tribulation. The only thing missing is the Rapture, but that bunk was made up and isn't exactly canonical. 

So yeah, we're right on track. And if we go to war with Iran, then a battle in Megiddo doesn't seem so far fetched.

Of course, There is no ~~2nd~~ 3rd Temple being built yet, but you could argue that moving the capital of Israel to Jerusalem fits the bill. 

Of course it's all B.S., but there are a lot of people trying to make it real so it makes sense that all of these things are being done. Especially in light of reports that Pence was involved in getting Trump to attack Iran.

>Although the British were initially turned down in their request for American support by President Truman, the election of Dwight D. Eisenhower as U.S. President in November 1952 changed the American stance toward the conflict. On 20 January 1953, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother, director of the C.I.A. Allen Dulles, told their British counterparts that they were ready to move against Mosaddegh. In their eyes, any country not decisively allied with the United States was a potential enemy. Iran had immense oil wealth, a long border with the Soviet Union and a nationalist prime minister.

>In 1941 Reza Shah was deposed, and his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was installed by an invasion of allied British and Soviet troops. In 1953, foreign powers (American and British) again came to the Shah's aid. After the young Shah fled to Italy, the British MI6 aided an American CIA operative in organizing a military coup d'état to oust the nationalist and democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh.[60]

False equivalence. One man promises to turn a constitutional trial into a sham, the other says he feels that the evidence presented so far would be enough to convict, _unless the defense presents exculpatory evidence, meaning he'd be willing to change that vote._

Defending the president's illegal actions in direct conflict with the constitution is treason. So your ""two side"" bullshit is in full effect, however there's no shortage of evidence to convict the president.

Also, the house is 1/2 of 1/3 of the government, collectively deciding to invoke the powers granted them by the constitution is anathema of treasonous. They were granted the powers specifically for this very reason. The whole point the senate gets to make the deciding vote is to ensure separation of powers. This is all by design. If you think there's' any treason there, you're brainwashed by the baddies."
