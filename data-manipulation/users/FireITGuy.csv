askscience,ffj7icq,t1_ffj4tb2,1579992329.0,"Not OP, but the very simplified answer is that specific location had a combination of the following:

High initial (in a geologic sense) presence of desired ores.

High permeability (allowing water to pass through, carrying away much of the other materials)

And high amounts of water due to the area's climate.

Basically, think of it as a rich source to start, sitting at the bottom of a funnel. As rain fell in the entire surrounding area it flowed through the funnel, washing away material and leaving behind a high ratio of the things we wanted."

This is all just ballpark, so you can get an idea of what ordering looks like in huge orgs.

We have over 2,500 WAN sites, and more than 10,000 networked buildings. At a minimum, every single WAN site has two servers, one switch, and one router. Most have far, far more.

On our standard hardware refreshes we order roughly:

9,000 computers.

350 routers.

600+ switches. (this varies a lot depending on which sites are in the year. We have some WAN locations that have over a hundred switches by themselves)

1,000 servers.

We don't order our SFPs separately, but if I had to ballpark it's probably 3,000 or so per year.

The skills you learn at small scale are critical to planning when you get to large scale. You need to understand how to do things, and how long it takes so that you can build automated solutions to handle the giant workload.

We have 400-ish IT staff. That number includes everything from Tier 1 helpdesk to the top level Domain Admins and CIO/CTO."
SeattleWA,fen7sun,t3_eq1pdu,1579278850.0,"As someone who interfaces with this facility, it's not super supprising to hear it may go away. 

By 2021 all newly generated federal records MUST be digital. With a 50-year retention for most of the stuff that goes to FARC the facility would be on a glide path after that, where every year less and less space is needed at the site. NARA already has data centers elsewhere that are designed to expand to accommodate the coming digital load, so all of the physical record centers are on borrowed time.

It's also important for non-gov people to understand that most of what goes to NARA is the minutiae of government business. For a project we may need to archive every single email along the way, every receipt for materials, every toll slip, plus all the paperwork that accounts for every cent of spending. All of those records have value in a human lifetime. If you need to go back and audit and/or deal with lawsuits you want every shred persevered. But, realistically, 50 years from now no one will care about my hardware store receipt for a single bag of concrete when the project ran short. It's not worth storing this stuff forever, hence why NARA exists.

All of the important stuff gets filled in a very different manner, and generally with incredibly long retention rules (some items are centuries, some things are forever)."

Many line voltage thermostats could arc when they hit their set points and the contacts open and close. Doing so would put a 120v source of ignition inside of a cabinet potentially full of fumes. 

It would be much safer to get a 12v thermostat with a remote sensor, place the sensor inside of the cabinet, and put everything else outside. Then use a relay to have the 12v thermostat turn 120v power on/off.

The community response to the articles was pretty intense. There were a number of town meetings and panels, including some  researches and physicians coming out to talk about the risk.

Vax rates on the island jumped from 55% ish to 85%+ in the year following those articles. There are of course still hold outs, but in many ways they've been pretty heavily ostracized and no longer represent the main viewpoint of the community.

Takeoff and landing are when you might actually die. Once you're up above about 10,000 feat the only thing that's going to take you down is the plane getting hit by a large meteor. Once you're up there have a drink and enjoy the view.

Modern jets have a glide ratio of around 1:16. That is to say without power they can fly 16 feet for every foot they fall. Up at 30,000 ft crusing altitude that works out to about 90 miles of glide distance, even if both engines died.
