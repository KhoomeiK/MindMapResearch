spirituality,ffcdozs,t1_ffcd8vm,1579797228.0,"I feel like you've already made up your mind and you're not really going to listen to anyone, but realize all that you said about a supportive group of friends is helpful, but alongside her doctors as well. Psychosis is a very serious condition and untreated it could fry her brain, she probably won't ever be the same person you knew. She is going through her dark night of the soul, this will be a real lesson for her and change her for the better. She probably will have problems with her memory, that at least happened for me, finding the right words will also be difficult for her as her disorganized thoughts have altered her brain"
spirituality,ffcd8vm,t1_ffbpqyd,1579796950.0,"I would recommend you look closer into what psychosis actually is. Psychosis is drastically different from a spiritual break through. And the right anti depressants are not suppressing her thoughts, even the current ones aren't, they don't affect your thought process at all, they just balance out her brain chemistry. As someone who takes 7 pills a day to stay sane and grounded my spiritual and magical practices are stronger than ever. Before my energy was too scattered to focus in on everything, I was having my dark night of the soul and my spirit was being crushed and my vibration at the time was very low. Your friend will be on her medication for a long time before they start weening her off. Please listen to what she said in your dream, I feel like you're ignoring get wishes. She told you that you cannot be together in the physical world. To be honest with you my interpretation of this dream is that in order to achieve your spiritual breakthrough you're going to need to separate yourself from her. You two have served each other's purpose in your lives. This doesn't mean never see her again but put some space between each other. You need to focus on your path right now."
spirituality,ffcb8t1,t1_ffc4a2i,1579795698.0,"Yeah but the dream said that they can't be together in the physical world, that only their spirits will be connected. So I feel that the focus needs to be spiritual not physical like the dream said"

exmormon,ff2kqia,t3_er8egw,1579510664.0,"I can't understand this, as a pansexual woman growing up with the church and figuring out my sexuality was awful.

Well I gained 20 pounds within 2 weeks lol so I reached out to the other doctor and she was like ""uhh exercise more blah blah passively implying it's my fault, blah blah let's not act rash"" 

So I did exercise more, I've ran a mile everyday for 2 months, limited my calories to 1700, and did IF and I haven't lost any weight yet, told my psych about the whole thing and you could tell he was irritated over what the other doctor said, we're officially changing up my meds.

Anyone else that has problems with you aren't worth having in your life, as far as family goes I did have a little bit of a meltdown with them and shared my feelings, I slowly petered out of church responsibilities (somehow my gay ass ended up being beehive, mymaid, and Laurel president) and stopped showing up to church at about 17. My parents thankfully are very loving and supportive, we're still very close, no disowning here haha. We have a mutual respect for each other's beliefs.

I honestly wasn't able to get over it until I met a friend who was a Wiccan and she converted me and our other friend haha. I would recommend to keep following this sub reddit and also follow witchcraft/Wiccan/pagan pages on Instagram to expose you a bit more to the community and use people practicing publicly make you feel better. You can also listen to Insiders guide to the otherside, it's not necessarily Wiccan, it's two mediums talking but they discuss a lot of elements in the craft. Also witch craft memes, a+ not too keep dragging on you can start out doing something other than meditation, it's not always for everyone so don't feel bad.

His mom and fiance didn't get to see him for 2 years and then he died before they ever got to see him again it tore them apart, my grandpa who was in the car as well had Burns over 80% of his body and was put in a medically induced coma and his other brother who was with him wasn't wearing his seat belt and was thrown out of the car.

If you're really concerned about how your eating affects your weight, try cutting fast food completely out of your diet, limit your sugars and stay away from the scale.
