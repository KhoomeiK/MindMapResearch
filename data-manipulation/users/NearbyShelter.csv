Either: their choice, their ability or their decisions. Their choice are usually students or someone seeking to supplement their income. Their time there will be short. The ability ones can do no better - they lack the mental capabilities.  They work an honest job for honest pay. The third group is the one from which one could learn. Their life choices got them there. They dropped out of school or they got someone pregnant/had a child young or left home and have bills to pay. Avoid being the one in the last group. Save money from your first job and put into stocks, live under your means, find a job that has low entry cost but pays well. Think outside box for career as sometimes those pay best."
