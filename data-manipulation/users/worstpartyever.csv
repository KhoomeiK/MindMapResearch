IKEA,ffg0t7i,t1_fffr0uw,1579896000.0,Upvote for Bar Keeper's Friend. It also works great on metal pots and pans for getting the scorch marks off without scratching!

crochet,ff75sis,t1_ff53t7j,1579641688.0,"On the link you posted, the yarn the designer used is Red Heart With Love yarn, which is Size 4 / Worsted with a Size H/6.5mm hook.

The hat is worked as a giant rectangle from top to bottom, then two sides are sewn together to make a tube. Then the top is cinched in (and a pom pom added).

If you're making an adult sized hat, the 15-inch starting chain would run from the top of the hat to the bottom of the brim (which can be flipped up), not sideways all around your head. Does that make sense? You'll add as many rows as needed to make it the circumference (width) needed to go around your head."
