Professors,fgsll0a,t1_fgsaoy9,1581087342.0,I was accused by a student of threatening them. I had to get a lawyer and spent $3k of my own money (I chose not to go with the university counsel I was entitled to). It was patently false. The student’s roommate come forward and told administration that she had been plotting this with other students. I was removed from the course. Student faced zero consequences.

unpopularopinion,fgrk1bm,t1_fgrj8j9,1581048798.0,"It simply takes a long time to get things done the right way. Life is hard. Time is a scarce resource. People compete for resources and jobs. There is simply not going to be a system in this world where you get to work short hours and still get all the things you want (unless working short hours is what you want most). I get that. I make work-life balance decisions all the time. But if you want the education, you gotta put in the time. It is a simple undeniable fact that if you are required to do less in school you’ll be less prepared when you come out. When I was in college, I embraced that it was going to be hard and take up most of my time. Bad news: I had more free time in college (and grad  school gettin a PhD) than I do as a 40 year old with a job, a spouse (with 2 careers herself) and a kid.

I had to constantly explain that when they failed my class, they’d have to take it next year anyway. There is a reason these late adds are at the instructor’s discretion....use that discretion as you see fit.

running,fgejq0m,t3_exv8ac,1580701157.0,"My biggest thing about long runs is that they taught me that the race doesn’t start until you’re gassed.

These training runs teach you to ignore your lungs and legs and let your brain tell you to keep going. The real race starts when you get to the point where you want to quit. Everybody can run when they feel great. Marathoners keep going once that wears off. The other thing I’ve learned is that my energy throughout a run doesn’t go from 100% at the start to 0% at the end, linearly....I often feel like crap at the start and feel the best the last couple miles.

If it’s going to take you 3.5 years to get a paper that MIGHT be publishable in a top 1% journal, better to publish 2-3 solid papers in solid journals with better chances of success.

Professors,fg8gu0j,t3_exft2u,1580619069.0,"1) Choose your graduate students VERY carefully. You need them to be very productive, and graduate on time, if you want to make good progress to to tenure. 

2) Focus on surviving teaching first, then focus on good teaching. Your first focus should be on not making mistakes that will get you fired (FERPA errors, mishandling students with disabilities, mishandling academic integrity issues, mishandling mental health issues, violations of policies that you aren’t aware of until you violate them and get a call from the associate dean), etc. Your school won’t provide this guidance....they want to focus on “sexy” stuff like inclusive pedagogy and novel instructional methods. Ask everyone you meet what the 1-2 biggest mistakes they made in the classroom were, and how to avoid them. Once your ass is adequately covered, then you can work on better teaching (remember, improvement over time is more important than your ratings your first semester). 

3) Start working on your dossier from the day you start the job. Get the template from the provost’s website and get examples from colleagues. Start writing everything you do in the corresponding sections....keep it up to date at least monthly. If there are sections with nothing in it after a year, seek out specific opportunities to fill those sections. Don’t wait until you have an actual reappointment or tenure decision coming up to start working on it. Seek feedback on you dossier at least yearly (my department made this mandatory even though it wasn’t mandatory at higher levels...very helpful)

4) Match your efforts to your appointment: % teaching, research, service, administration and extension (extension generally only applies to land grant ag colleges in case this term isn’t familiar to you). If you are 80% research, 20% teaching then you better be publishing and getting grants, and pretty much doing slightly more than the minimum in the classroom. I’m just telling it like it is. 

5) Publish smaller papers first. If you have data that could be one amazing paper or 2 decent ones, in most cases I’d advocate going for more pubs. You’ll have time to publish mega papers later. 

6) You’ve gonna play the game and work the system. It’s designed to be a series of hoops that are frustrating and bureaucratic...don’t fight the system, use the system to your advantage."
Professors,fg8foxe,t1_fg8e4e9,1580618115.0,I would argue that small grants are a good way to get started and get your first grant. I try to diversify my grant portfolio as much as possible. Obviously we want and need big grants but small grants can be a part of the mix too. Maybe if you’re at one of the very top programs in your field then small grants won’t cut it. But for most people they are a key part of the mix at least at first.

I offered them a chance to fix it (I didn’t say what was wrong, only that a lot of people didn’t turn in a complete academic integrity form and I’d let anyone who wanted to see their form and correct any errors they could find).
