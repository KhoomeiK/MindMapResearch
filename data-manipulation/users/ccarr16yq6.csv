AmItheAsshole,fc58al3,t1_fc25f8b,1577448302.0,Youre welcome. I empathize with you and recognized traits in your parents behaviors as narcissistic.  I also posted a post in AITA and got kinda blasted (I was the asshole) but one response mentioned this sub and it has been a difficult yet liberating revelation.  Youre a good person for many reasons.  Keep up the good work.
