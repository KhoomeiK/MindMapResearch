Battletechgame,ffeqfsw,t1_ffeiq6j,1579860368.0,"I really don't know what you're talking about. Edmon said the same thing - that you can't use glass cannon mechs because sometimes the opfor is placed right beside you. 

First of all, none of that matters at all in this game because you have a magic hocus pocus teleport button called evacuate or something like that, I forget what it's called because I just call it magic, which is really bad game design. If you ever find yourself in a bad situation, POOF, you're magically teleported to safety. 

But, the thing is, I hate that button so much, that I refuse to use it. And I've played through many careers using glass cannon mechs and done just fine with them. 

Now, MP is a different story. My glass cannon lrm boats got destroyed by firestarters in one of the few MP matches I was able to play, but I rarely find the AI is a problem with them. 

The way I build my fire support is this - it needs enough front armour to take an alpha strike from a similar weight class and enough back armour to take indirect fire. 

I've lost tons of pilots but 99% of those are due to melee hits hitting the head. I don't generally lose pilots in my fire support mechs. 

Keep in mind, though, that I only bring fire support where it's appropriate, like attack and defend missions, base defense. I don't bring them to missions that are mobile like assassination."

interestingasfuck,ffc3y7b,t1_ffbqzbr,1579790946.0,"not sure why anyone would use an expanding round in a rifle on a battlefield. Expanding rounds are basically only useful in pistols when firing at un-armoured targets. The kinetic energy that comes out of a pistol is almost an order of magnitude less than what comes out of a rifle. A quick trip to Youtube can show you that people can be shot a dozen times with common (9mm) pistol rounds and still be fighting, so manufacturers use every trick they can to give pistol rounds more stopping power. 

&#x200B;

A rifle, on the other hand, is used more often in warfare, where accuracy is more important, and the round will hit with an order of magnitude more energy. The cavitation caused by a rifle round is enormous, compared to that of a pistol. I very much doubt an expanding round would make any difference for rifles, given the enormous cavity caused by impact. 

In modern conflict, an expanding round would be stupid as it would be easily stopped by kevlar.

Mao was easily in the top 3 and a viable contender for number 1 most incompetent leader in the entire history of our species, and yes, I'm including Hitler in that list. It's heart breaking looking at how much the CCP has held China back. They brag about good economic growth recently, but it doesn't mean anything. All you need to do is look at Japan and South Korea. Had China just liberalized after WW2, the standard of living in China would be the same as Japan, SK, or Taiwan. Don't forget that China's GDP/capita is still only 1/3 of those other countries, at best. 

&#x200B;

So the Chinese are still very poor compared to their neighbours, and they can mostly thank Mao for that. Then there's the fact that they live in a more draconian and less free society. Japan and SK have free press and individual rights and liberties such as the right to a fair trial. In China, while many of these things exist on paper, they do not exist in reality. 

&#x200B;

One thing I've very often heard people say, in praise of Mao, is that he ""protected"" China from outside threats. Once again, I say his rule was a disaster and he failed miserably even in the security category. He invaded Tibet, not praiseworthy in my opinion, and they invaded Vietnam, which was a failure, but most of all, Mao dragged China into the US/Korean war and nearly got China nuked. The American military was 100% behind the idea of dropping nukes on China but president Truman wouldn't go for it. It could have easily gone the other way had a different president been in office at the time. America could have completely destroyed China at the time and did Mao even have a good reason for getting involved in the Korean war in the first place? Look at the outcome. All Mao did was preserve North Korea as a nightmare on earth. NK is one of the most horrific, evil places on the planet and it still exists, all thanks to Mao. 

&#x200B;

While Hitler probably remains in the number 1 place of worst person to have ever existed, measured by the total amount of misery a person can cause, and Stalin is up there, along with Genghis Khan and whatnot, I think Mao is, at bare minimum, 3rd place, and probably 2nd, and you could even make some reasonable arguments as to Mao being able to Challenge Hitler for first.

When playing a PHI or IND leader, you can build wonders and generate a lot of specialists, settling them in your capital and placing the Oxford in it.

Don't listen to anyone who says you can't or shouldn't play tall in civ 4. Keep in mind that civ 4 is older than Reddit. I'm old and I was around back in the days of [civfanatics.com](https://civfanatics.com) and watched the best players play civ 4. Tons of people made ""let's play"" threads and videos, beating the game on diety, by playing tall, and by tall I mean just 2-3 cities. Keep in mind, however, that if you only have 2-3 cities, deity level AI will be impossible to deal with late game, so  you've got to get a mid game advantage and then use that to go conquering. 

Almost no one plays on deity, anyway, though, and on immortal and lower, you can easily win the game with 2-3 cities. Still, you really should be aiming to have at least 6, though, for your national wonders. You can beat deity with 6 cities. You don't need more.

So it's easy to see pictures of women, even on their social media, and think ""oh wow, she's so hot...gee... my gf doesn't look like that"", but then actually your gf probably does look like that when she's all done up, and that hot social media picture is only how that woman looks 1% of the time."

Edit: Here's a better example:

&#x200B;

The British didn't slaughter American POW's in the revolutionary war, so when they were surrounded at Yorktown and surrendered, they anticipated being treated relatively well, and they were. The officers were allowed to go back to England and the soldiers were held as POW's until the war was officially over.

&#x200B;

Contrast that to the 90's Chechen war between Chechen ""rebels"" and the Russian military, the Chechens were notoriously brutal towards Russian soldiers. The Russian soldiers were conscripts and a lot of them had no battlefield experience. When the Chechens captured the Russians, they treated them horrifically.

There is a video that the Chechens made, they captured some young Russian soldiers and the Russians had surrendered. Then the Chechens slowly sawed off the heads of the Russian soldiers while mocking them, took a video of it, and spread the video around. It's one of the most horrific videos EVER made, easily as horrible as anything to come out of the Mexican cartel wars, etc.

When the Russian military assaulted the Chechen capital, Grozny, they were also famously brutal. They used howitzers and rocket artillery to hit residential apartment buildings, for example. The whole war was savage."

IdiotsInCars,femsg69,t1_femrg9a,1579268307.0,"The problem with your argument is it's unfair because you are ignoring how the human brain works. Yes, we're supposed to stay back and not tailgate. Yes, you're supposed to stop in time. Personally, I give myself a LOT of distance at highway speed, more than most people. 

However, studies have been done that show that people are not very good at understanding that the car in front of them has completely stopped, and they often brake too late. Our brains did not evolve in an environment where we would move at 60 mph. 

In the Quebec case, she actually only went to jail for a few months. Also, she stopped in an area where the visibility wasn't the best, I think it was at the crest of a hill. 

I think it's fine to touch your brake and slow down to avoid hitting wildlife. But if you just sit there on the highway you are doing something very dangerous. It depends what highway, too. Are we talking some 2 lane highway out in the country with cows and hay on either side? That's different from doing it on some 6 lane major highway near a major city. 

In any case, in this video, you see someone having an ego trip and it results in other people dying. If I were on the jury I would 100% find them guilty of criminal negligence causing death. A reasonable person should know that brake checking people on the highway is extremely dangerous and could result in death. You know that. I know that. So if you do it and it results in death, then you willingly created a situation where a person died, and you knew that's what you were doing. It's somewhat close to actually killing someone. It's super fucking serious. 

The Quebec woman went to jail for 3 months, I would agree with that, it was a light sentence. 

This dude in this video? I'd send him away for decades. It's not quite as serious as murder, but it's very serious, perhaps comparable to manslaughter, in my mind."
