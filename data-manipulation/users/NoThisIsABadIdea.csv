I would probably tear up if I watched one of his family members break down while talking about him.

funny,fez9tmi,t1_fez1imb,1579455128.0,"Ah okay so you ARE defending the fact that it is ""part of the game."" And you think that is a good thing? Do you actually believe that it is good for the sport?

This is why so many people on this thread are calling football/soccer a sport with pussy players."
GetMotivated,fez2qv5,t1_fey12gf,1579453322.0,This whole thing reads as a bad attempt at someone trying to be motivating. HUSTLE HARD OR BE WEAK
funny,feywjiy,t1_feyv12f,1579451396.0,"Of course I know the differences between the sports. My point is that being considered a non contact sport doesn't mean you have to fucking fake an injury. Of course real injuries happen, but football has such a bad record for fakes it's laughable. Are you actually arguing that faking injury is okay and just part of the game?"
movies,feyp02i,t1_feym6uv,1579448515.0,"Even better. Sorry been a while since I read them and I can't say I've even read all 6, but I'm still excited and crossing my fingers the movie is good"
funny,feyoczy,t1_feykgiw,1579448223.0,"Ah yes world class athletes who go down for 30 seconds plus because someone ""tapped"" their shin. Hell half the time it's so fucking obvious there wasn't even CONTACT and then they act injured. 

Just admit it for what it is: it's bullshit acting in attempt to cheat the system and its continuously allowed to happen."
funny,feynuuj,t1_feykq1l,1579448074.0,So fucking what? So football players (soccer) get to pretend they are extremely hurt because the sport isn't supposed to involve contact? That's dumb as fuck logic
movies,feyko8v,t1_feyi3kx,1579446866.0,"There were 3 from the original author, so two sequels. Then a bunch of prequels written later and stuff but I'd like to see at least the first 3 make it."
movies,feyg8wi,t1_feyfgmt,1579445100.0,It does matter. Because if it is successful then sequels will be made.
