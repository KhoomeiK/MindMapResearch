I have to get paperwork ready for us to file bankruptcy which I’ve been putting off. We are also moving to a house that we are rehabbing and i am sleeping there on an uncomfortable air mattress since our current house is making me sick because there’s a mold issue in the basement.  I have our dogs and cats with me too because I’m worried about their little lungs.  We are trying to get the other house at least livable so we can all get moved out.  Hopefully by the end of the week, we will be there.  Anyway, the year has started out pretty bad but we have only ourselves to blame.  At least my birthday is Wednesday and my oldest is coming so we are going out for a family dinner.  That will be nice.  Sorry to unload all that."

People seem to delight in others peoples “flaws” because it stops them from focusing on their own “flaws”.  Judgmental people and hateful people are actually projecting their own self hatred.
