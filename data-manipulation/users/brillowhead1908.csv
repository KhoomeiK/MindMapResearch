depression,ffk0pjw,t3_eu1y7e,1580012251.0,"I’m not sure where you are from, but therapists are mandated reporters. If anything were to threaten someone else’s life, they would report it.
And that’s a good thing.

AskReddit,ffhb15o,t3_etmah9,1579928419.0,“Clear the room” I work in a vocational therapy setting for mentally disabled adults. To have 10-15 people running into a room for a guy going off is jarring. To be the guy who is most experienced and able to talk them down and dragged out of said room. That’s the scary part.
