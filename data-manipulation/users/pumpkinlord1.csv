Literally last second."
dayz,ff0wezh,t3_eqtz3u,1579472911.0,Yeah i would be very upset if my game turned out like that in the end. I dont mind dying as much anymore but I'd rather go out legit than to some lag or server error. Don't hate the game though dude the real experience is still out there somewhere
aww,ff0u00l,t3_equd4z,1579472293.0,More like an assassin.
DayzXbox,ff0tv0z,t3_eqzy4t,1579472250.0,The one thing I've noticed in dayz and vigor is that the weather sounds are very high quality. Sounds like home.
DayzXbox,ff0so0q,t3_er1jwt,1579471932.0,The man had a plate carrier on and got headshotted. I would have been pretty salty after that depending on my health condition.

dayz,feifii9,t1_feibvdn,1579137322.0,"I might have to test that when i find a frag grenade then to see if i can replicate what happened to you, you might have found a good way to kill people."
dayz,feibfk0,t1_fei8b1p,1579134578.0,What vest?
dayz,fegkp5x,t1_fegjmil,1579095743.0,"I'd love to see that first hand. Apparently the ballistic vest will stop 2 slugs. I know because my friend shot me in the back trying to kill a zombie i was attacking for laughs, it cut me and damaged me a little bit but not as much as if i had no armor on at all. The stab vest btw will stop pistol rounds but not rifle rounds."
dayz,fegebpb,t1_fegcrg2,1579089765.0,If you are playing on console it would be left on the dpad. For mouse and keyboard i have no idea because i dont often use that.
dayz,fegbd3g,t1_feg2vwn,1579086133.0,"The tundra is a one shot weapon when people don't have ballistic vests or plate carriers on. There are two guns that can kill in one shot through armor and that is the vss with armor piercing rounds and the blaze on the double fire mode. The blaze can be found around hunting areas or inside certain houses where you'd be able to regularly find shotguns. Also the general stores with the green sign on the front is really good for finding those as well as hunting scopes. The hunting cabins you'll find grouped together also spawn this as well as the hunting towers and feed shacks.

Hopefully you find this useful, good luck dont die."
dayz,fegb2yv,t3_eoyx54,1579085753.0,"I would just like to let you know, that ballistic vest saved your life. I can't tell you how many times plate carriers, ballistic vests, and even stab vests have saved my life from guns that are able to kill in one hit."

dayz,fefqzpt,t1_fefqc3v,1579062685.0,"Well he saw that the double stack mags were badly damaged after the explosion. The only thing i take from this is that the shrapnel couldn't go through the magazine and when he walked on top of it, everything blew out horizontally and the stuff that went vertical hit the magazine."
HuntShowdown,fefatlw,t1_fdfwyv8,1579052226.0,I just saw this reply and looked at your post and that was one spicy bullet you had there.
dayz,fef9wz4,t1_fef6t6y,1579051628.0,Yeah i thought he died when he told me but apparently no damage was done.
DayzXbox,feewett,t3_eor0r0,1579042665.0,Good job
DayzXbox,feeef2s,t3_eoobhq,1579032051.0,"You should never need to press y to cycle the pump it should do so automatically after you press the trigger and fire the round. If you interrupt the cycling of the round into the chamber then you might have to double tap y at that point. 

A good thing to mention would be the slow fire rate of the pump shotgun, once the double barrel came out i was able to fire 6 shots faster out of the double barrel on single shot than the pump."
dayz,feecbzh,t3_eonv70,1579030828.0,"My friend ran over a mine that was under some double stack mags, the double stack mags apparently saved him somehow cause he took no damage once he ran over them. All he heard was a loud bang and he saw smoke everywhere."
DayzXbox,feebiaj,t1_feeatje,1579030349.0,Except they do more damage.
dayz,feaf70v,t3_eo5lnf,1578947914.0,"This was about my first experience with cars, my friend was stuck for about 2 minutes doing the wierd getting hit by a car glitch but having it do no damage."

Recently we gave someone a ride to moglievka from solniechy (pardon my spelling) in our car cause they wanted a cherno spawn so we said we were going near there anyway to get our friend and they rode with us peacefully. It was a really nice interaction."

DayzXbox,fcs5nhw,t3_eika3c,1577911790.0,"Check out izurvive on the app store it lists all the wells in towns and all the different building types.

When you first spawn in find the well, drink from it till your character is watered. Next you must find food. Search smaller houses and two story houses but dont search apartments cause they dont normally spawn anything useful. The little kiosks by the road are very useful. If you dont find a can opener you should have found a knife to open cans, if you didn't find a knife or can opener you can walk along the many trails or railways to find 2 stones and you can create a stone knife that way but i find it easier to search for a knife.

At night you should never use a light source because it broadcasts your position. Just get used to the darkness because you can still see a little bit. However moving or not is up for debate and depends on what you want to do because military areas spawn nvgs and other players could already have them. Its very handy to have a compass for use with the map especially at night."

DayzXbox,fcjsde0,t3_ehjhhe,1577702261.0,I recently got mad at one of my friends for killing someone who was clearly already mad at people who kos. I despise the people that kill fresh spawns and i tend to leave them alone. I also know that should i try to talk to anyone it almost always leads to kos. My biggest thing i do is make them surrender so i can talk to them without them actually making a move for a gun or something. Anyway good luck dont die.
