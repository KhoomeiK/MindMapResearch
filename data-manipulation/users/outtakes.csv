If not achieving something is making you feel like this, then think of the end goal. How do you get there? Break it up into tasks and do at least one of them a day. When you feel low, look back at all you've achieved for motivation.

You can do this"

It felt like people were just saying something generic and then they would carry on the rest of their day happy and carefree while I lay in my bed feeling alone and miserable. 

It's only when I started to feel like myself again that I realised they were right. I couldn't see it myself when I was in the situation. It's not a lie"
