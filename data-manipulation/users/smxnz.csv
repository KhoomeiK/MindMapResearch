AskReddit,fc9wnko,t3_egpeod,1577559295.0,"A great place is Portugal. You want beach? Go to Algarve. You want mountain? Any place in the north as that I recommend the Gerês mount. You want to talk to radon grandmas? you go to Alentejo and around (becouse there's just old people in ther) . You want history the capital (Lisbon) as that you can also go to Guimarães where Portugal was kinda born and there's also Porto in the north. The food is great there's a great ""sandwich"" called francesinha that is not really a sandwich but is in the middle of bread so... yeah. The people are really nice and thei are funny as hell. A bonus about Portugal is that it's so little you could see almost all the country in a month two if you want to throughly explore the city's you are vissting.

I apologize now for any grammatical errors in the text ingles is not my first language"
