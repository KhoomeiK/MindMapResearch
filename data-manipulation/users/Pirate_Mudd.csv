MadeMeSmile,ffphdq0,t1_ffpcwdc,1580095081.0,I have an in-law who's daughter would get get upset if she threw out the paper at that age. She does her chores now to pay for her news service subscriptions at 13. She wants to get a job so she can start getting more subscriptions. She tried starting a political club in 5th grade but nobody else cared. She just got one started this year. I plan on watching her career with great interest.
politics,ffpfxv5,t1_ffpfj5d,1580094075.0,The prosecutor was widely known to be corrupt and he was representing the US among a large number of countries calling for his firing. Nobody is talking about it because we understand that it means nothing.

Bossfight,ffiitro,t1_ffi4w2a,1579974899.0,It's because they have to remain pristine for those really sexy cuts. We all know this and have all agreed death is appropriate in some cases.
Bossfight,ffiiqq4,t1_ffhxt1h,1579974839.0,My wife knows they're my fabric scissors. She knows they aren't supposed to be used for anything else and weren't cheap. She still used them to cut a thick piece of plastic off a dog toy. Couldn't even speak to her for a bit because I was so pissed. There was a decent sized knick! They couldn't be used for fabric again.
AmItheAsshole,ffde6k7,t1_ffc1ubb,1579818996.0,I've been fired from a job for not meeting standards. Never had any communication that I wasn't. It's frustrating and looking at OP's responses they're a terrible boss.

I can stretch it out over a whole night which is not a bad cost for a night in the town. I've even come back with more money twice which was a nice surprise. If you view it as an entertainment expense and only do what you can afford to lose it's entertaining, just like the dreams that you give yourself while waiting for the lottery drawing. $2 is a fine cost for that."

They strip away voting rights and the ability to make your vote count by Gerrymandering the shit out of everywhere. They strip down our environmental protections, worker protections, stop gun control measures that most people actually support like background checks and pushing through bullshit anti drug laws that do nothing but put people in jail for nothing. They are anti worker, anti poor, anti minority, anti truth, anti women, anti accountability for the rich, anti intelligent monetary policy, even more pro war than the Democrats, pro child molester, pro fucking you over and making you cheer as your life gets harder."

AmItheAsshole,fesis7n,t1_feqtzr7,1579365666.0,I can understand it though. I have a large family and we don't all get together that often because people have spread out. We have one picture from before people started to die and it also has my little sister's abusive ex boyfriend in it. He's in a spot that would be super noticable if he was photoshopped out and it ruins the picture. The extent the family took it is too far but I can understand the logic.

I was repeatedly assaulted and the cops threatened me after I called them for being jumped by 3 guys. We're not just talking about calling names in the playground, bullies in many cases deserve jail time."

My tiny little mother is normally very soft spoken but has a hell of a competitive streak that my wife wasn't prepared for. She was the first to go down to her last card and the second her hand went off the card my mom's finger was in her face and she yelled that she didn't say Uno.

Bullies don't deserve more empathy than their victims, bullies deserve serious therapy and being removed as a source of problems for other kids. When your bully dies, especially if they are active, it's okay to celebrate that you don't have to go through hell anymore."

That is the only time that I'm really going to be unavailable to her. Especially during playoffs. That isn't an unreasonable thing for a hobby and OP had no reason to turn off the game. If you don't have a DVR or some way to pause it then you can miss a lot, especially if it's someone doing something at the end of a game that's close (not that last night's game was).
