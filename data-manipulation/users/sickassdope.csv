They actually played far better defense when he was out with Gorgui Dieng starting. Jokic is leading one of the best teams in the west with zero all star teammates. You're unbelievably wrong.

'kat has been great when he's on.' You can say that about anyone lol."

ripcity,ff5fz4g,t1_ff5b823,1579591195.0,Because trying to lose is a good way to ruin your franchise's culture and drive out your star player. You'd rather us completely tank and get the 9th pick instead of the 14th in a bad draft class?
ripcity,ff5fu6j,t1_ff5bwdr,1579591026.0,Above doncic or harden? You know that's not happening.
