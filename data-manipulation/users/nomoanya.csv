Frugal,ffqpzhe,t1_ffq6xg5,1580140937.0,"Agreed very much. I love the idea of things that last many generations. My mom always said save money on disposable items, but pay for quality with non-disposables (furniture, etc.). They way I save money on quality item is thrifting!"
BanPitBulls,ffqoonx,t3_eunq1u,1580140051.0,Good.
BanPitBulls,ffqhmsd,t3_eug1h5,1580134846.0,"So, according to pit logic, if it’s how the dog was raised, this dog is for sure going to snap because it WAS RAISED to fight. For fuck’s sake, they never apply their faulty logic to themselves!"
Frugal,ffox8lb,t1_ffoi953,1580082919.0,"Not sure on the specific brands, definitely google it if you eat a lot though!"
BanPitBulls,ffnu5yh,t1_ffnt6zq,1580070867.0,"Buddy, you came to the wrong sub."
Frugal,ffn2a45,t1_ffmzvrm,1580061210.0,"Yes! Last fall (not sure if that was the earliest instance of this?) some researchers found high levels of lead chromate in turmeric sources from
India. Lead chromate apparently is also bright yellow and it was used to add color and cut the spice. Google “turmeric lead” and you’ll see a bunch of news on it. Important to make sure spice sources are legit."
Frugal,ffmu8o0,t1_ffm0ddg,1580058972.0,Heads up— turmeric is often cut with lead. This particular spice is one you might want to spend a little more on to limit that exposure.
1200isplenty,ffjzy00,t1_ffjb77x,1580011610.0,The white kind I’ve had only ever taste like water so I can’t imagine anything could taste less sweet!

dogs,ffgj6r4,t1_ffgf3hl,1579907461.0,"If you’re interested in the BONKERS lengths people go to to willfully re-brand pit bulls as “lab mixes” and “terrier mixes,” visit r/banpitbulls. Agreed that it only hurts the dogs (and unfortunately, potentially people)."
ExpectationVsReality,fffyriq,t1_fffvcqs,1579894741.0,I just appreciate that you said “store brand tacos.”
ThriftStoreHauls,fffy88q,t1_ffff335,1579894407.0,BUT your snail tattoo!! I love snails!!!
1200isplenty,ff98rh5,t3_esc06d,1579707460.0,"Crystal is THE BEST!! It has a little kick, but not so spicy that you can’t really lay it on, and it has the yummiest vinegar tang."
BanPitBulls,ff94iz7,t1_ff91u1o,1579704659.0,I agree and feel the same way about “doggo” and even “kiddo.” Why are these words a thing?
Journaling,ff8au3r,t3_es6v85,1579671238.0,"Poems, lyrics. If you’re into this kind of thing, you could draw a tarot card each day for a while and record it and how it makes you feel. You could do daily affirmations. Record daily gratitude! At night, record your favorite thing that happened each day. Use a word generator online to generate a word of the day and write a little thought about it as it applies to your life or day. Write a five year story, adding a few sentences each entry."
EatCheapAndHealthy,ff85od9,t1_ff822xh,1579666688.0,"The sell by dates and best buy dates DO NOT mean the food is expired! This is frugality 101. Use by dates are what you’re thinking of and often food is good well beyond those dates because stores and brands pad them for quality. You can examine your food when those dates come along and frankly, I’ve never once had food actually spoiled on the use by date. Again, sell by and best buy give frugal/non-wasteful peeps much more time."
AmItheAsshole,ff811wp,t1_ff7ro9k,1579663204.0,"Having dealt with addicts in my family, to me, this reads “I can no longer deal with my brother’s unending bullshit that burdens me and my loved ones endlessly, and I can no longer deal with my enabling mother who still does put up with his bullshit, and I am resentful of both.” Callous? Maybe. Understandable that people reach the ends of ropes sometimes? 100%. I don’t think OP hates his mother or brother, I think OP no longer has any bandwidth for addiction, addicts, their enablers, or anyone else who does have time for them. It’s harsh, but it is sometimes the consequence of addiction."
1200isplenty,ff49l0s,t1_ff47f0h,1579558526.0,"I've had it, and it's bigger and not served in foil, so I was thinking maybe the little ones were fussy to make with tiny tortillas and heated in foil, rather than using regular tortillas they can use with other stuff and just heat them up like the regular quesadillas? SIGH. thanks for the suggestions, though, I'll give those a try!"
Outlook,ff44o5y,t1_ff44ajm,1579555459.0,Excellent! Fingers crossed that this holds...
eatsandwiches,ff3xgdc,t3_eriss6,1579550976.0,"This is a new favorite of mine— egg salad, lettuce, tomato, marinated purple cabbage, and marinated grated carrot on buttered Japanese white bread. So crunchy and satisfying!"

Outlook,ff1r1l8,t1_ff1puc9,1579484293.0,"Oh no, that's terrible! I'm so sorry. I'm also in the middle of major life changing events and I am really afraid the same thing is going to happen!"
Outlook,ff1p57y,t1_ff1ib6l,1579483063.0,"I feel the same way! I've had mind for decades, literally, it would be so inconvenient to switch, but three days of this shit is already more than I can handle. It's awful!"

SeriousConversation,fegl8q7,t1_fefvs7w,1579096242.0,"I think we need to support OP’s perspective here, which is that he felt hurt and ignored, rather than justify the behavior of this unknown person through speculation. OP doesn’t believe this is the case, and OP came here for comfort."
SeriousConversation,fefrcc1,t3_eox5h7,1579062957.0,I’m so sorry. That must have hurt. I’d keep this in mind when choosing what friends to put energy into in the future. Make sure it’s the ones that you know care about you. Happy birthday!
SeriousConversation,fec55b7,t3_eobqf6,1578966801.0,"Hi! There’s a wonderful Facebook community for women from all walks of life and tons of different religions who cover their hair called Wrapunzel. The Wrapunzel FB group is a true sisterhood of hair coverers, many of whom don’t even necessarily cover for religious reasons. They are a remarkable resource for this kind of thing— they can give encouragement, tips, advice. While Reddit is a great resource, the Wrapunzel community might give you some support from the perspective of women who also cover their hair. I’ve seen this topic brought up many times. Honestly, the vast majority of the time there are no negative issues. Best of luck!"
SeriousConversation,fec4k9d,t1_febnfbn,1578966553.0,"If you’re suggesting a Muslim woman remove her headscarf to blend in more, you either don’t understand the importance of the hijab, or aren’t interested assuaging this woman’s anxiety."
1200isplenty,febp11k,t1_febc03e,1578961174.0,I did not want to know this.
BanPitBulls,feborsu,t1_fe9h3sw,1578961074.0,I think people can sometimes go after homeowners insurance and that certain breeds can cause your homeowners insurance to be higher. I know that many landlords limit breed types because victims of bites could jeopardize their ability to get coverage later on.
1200isplenty,febmgmq,t3_eo9hxf,1578960398.0,"Funnily enough, I always imagined the pounds I lose as boxes of butter. You know, those rectangles. For some reason, that seems HUGE to me, so when I think about having lost 30lbs of butter, it seems like a really great accomplishment! :)"

dogs,febklbq,t1_febf53m,1578959781.0,Totally. Both times I left it on for around five minutes after arriving home while distracted by the mail or something and he just chopped away immediately. Lesson learned!
nextfuckinglevel,fe8l9n7,t1_fe6xn3z,1578927453.0,I remember reading it on jokes.com in 1998-1999 when I was in jr. high. It’s ancient!

dogs,fe6b070,t1_fe6alzn,1578885846.0,Thanks for this perspective. I wish I had some canned white asparagus...maybe I'll keep some on hand. Not that he will ever get the chance to do this again!

SeriousConversation,fdtil43,t1_fdtgzji,1578717277.0,"Oh, you are so welcome. I'm honored if it helped. Isn't it funny how time works? On the one hand, it comes way, way too slowly when you want stuff done, and on the other it goes by way, way too fast to feel like you had time to get stuff done! Hang in there. This will all be behind you faster than you think."
