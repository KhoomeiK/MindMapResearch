I have received more encouragement than the opposite here in this sub and am now trying to decide how to go about it - probably just make a post, apologise in advance and go for it!

Thanks again for your kind reply."
climbing,ffebjht,t1_ff88mml,1579842200.0,"Thank you very much for this. I have tried hard to get it right on Reddit in general, as I'm not exactly the best at all this online stuff, and have really tried to let you climbers here know of my ignorance. 

I am sorry for causing you to have a 'silent grimace' to yourself because of the terminology I used, although I should say that I was just as likely to have referred to Alex Honnold as Tommy Caldwells friend - eek! 

I am very interested in climbing from the comfort of a favourite armchair (for the time being) and I enjoy watching documentaries and reading about it too. 

I've lurked for a few weeks in this sub and have been trying to remember all the questions which I've long wanted to ask people who climb, so I'll apologise in advance - you'll see what I mean when I post them. If you have a mouth guard it may be useful to have it nearby to protect your teeth from some intense clenching! 

Thank you so much for taking the trouble to reassure me and I sincerely apologise for being thoughtless in the term I used."

CityPorn,ffbiqqk,t3_escz6e,1579767190.0,I don't know anything about creating stuff online etc (am old lol) but just wanted to say that this is a great idea and I'd definitely join the sub.

climbing,ff8pnm4,t1_ff8oc9x,1579690663.0,"I am really tempted to have a try and my confidence to do so has been boosted by your kind encouragement. Thank you for this. 

I have various medical issues involving my bones, although I am still able to work on the farm - I just don't get involved in anything which involves heavy lifting nowadays.

I have good core strength and my arms and legs are strong from a lifetime of riding horses and farm work. 

I am just worried that I may look like a bit of an outcast as I am in my 60s now. I don't carry any extra weight however and am reasonably fit. Wouldn't the more serious climbers who are actually there to train resent an old woman taking up space?"

Are they not friends? I had assumed they were. I watched the film about Caldwell before I saw Free Solo and I can assure you that I wouldn't be so presumptuous to try and lessen his talent and achievements by labelling him 'Honnolds friend'. It was just the term I used, and I stand corrected. 

I am beginning to think that I am well out of my depth here and should probably just go back to lurking. Thank you so much for your comment though."

I get how the questions must be a bit much sometimes, but climbing is not exactly something just anyone can do. It's actually quite terrifying to most people, and I find it so understandable that us non-climbers are quite fascinated."
climbing,ff74nzu,t1_ff72ij2,1579641050.0,Oh God that's the thing I mentioned earlier. I remember discovering that this is how climbers rested (or even slept!!!) and being totally blown away by the mere thought. I have so many questions and I'm coming back to ask them too! Thank you very much indeed for answering my question.
climbing,ff74d5l,t1_ff7394o,1579640875.0,Brilliant! Thank you so much. I am off there now.
climbing,ff74aaz,t1_ff72dsm,1579640830.0,"Well, I am a bit of a dunce when it comes to this sort of thing - it took me an age to become even slightly computer savvy, although I've progressed a bit from those days and also, after many years of having the most basic of mobile phones, have a more up to date one now and managed to get myself on Reddit. 

So, I'm now going to be applying myself to all the questions I have about what you do on these rock faces and mountains. I can't just reel them off as I am old now and need a bit of time you see. 

I won't be able to post them until, probably, tomorrow evening - will be busy playing midwife on the farm delivering the new lambs sometime tonight, into the early hours, and into tomorrow too.

What's bothering me is that I won't be able to find this - thread (if that's what it is?) again and I'll have all my questions and won't be able to find where to put them! Or do I just come back onto the sub and start asking?"
climbing,ff72fcn,t1_ff71dce,1579639767.0,Where would I be able to see photos of the places you actually climb? I have seen photos of Zion (National Park?) and it's beautiful.

I am actually a little unsure if I can get all my questions together and come back to the same spot say, tomorrow, when I'm all set? Knowing my luck I'll get myself sorted and ready to post and this will all be gone."
climbing,ff715ri,t1_ff70gy1,1579639058.0,Isn't Zion in Utah? I may be one of the awe-ists experiencing a full blown awe-ism at the sight of you climbing next year. I may have to sit down on a secure surface however.
climbing,ff6zzhd,t1_ff6x9iu,1579638371.0,"Ok thank you very much, I'm sure I can manage to look at a map, especially if I have a rough idea of where I'm s'posed to be looking. 

Strangely enough I have just apologised in advance for any inane (though I didn't use the term) questions I may ask within this sub, so please ignore them if you see them in the future - hopefully someone won't mind answering them for me and will be happy to overlook my ignorance. 

I've been asked a few myself when I am out and about on various horses locally, or at the shows we attend in the Summer. I actually feel very encouraged however by the interest people show in our beautiful animals - whether horse, calf, bull or cow - in other words, our lives. Thank you again for taking the time to respond."
climbing,ff6yqvd,t1_ff5vysb,1579637644.0,"Well we are starting to plan on basing the trip around doing Route 66, East to West. We will be totally free of anyone but ourselves - my 'children' and likewise their children, I will have already holidayed with, so we can, and probably will, make detours even if it involves taking a plane to another state. The world is once again our oyster except for the difference in the age's we were when it was before - if that makes sense!

I am the fittest when it comes to walking, but I'm not overly into long hikes in wild temperatures. Yosemite appeals greatly because - and please correct me if I've got this wrong - it seems like you can drive in and look at El Capitan and Half Dome from the valley below? Is it possible to watch any climbing from there do you know?

I loved the suggestion someone on here mentioned, where it's possible to hike (as long as it's not too extreme) to the top of some of the climbs and even watch it as you make your way there. 

We're getting on in years now, and although I spend my life working on the farm, the more physical tasks are left to the boys now. I deal with the horses mostly. My travelling companion is far less physically fit. He's a musician and sits on his arse most of the time - his definition not mine lol."
climbing,ff6vuyt,t1_ff6keba,1579635942.0,"This sounds fantastic, you can actually pass right by the top of the routes people are climbing? Where is The Pinnacles NP?"
climbing,ff6vol9,t1_ff6jct1,1579635837.0,Thank you for the help. What are the slack liners? I was going to go away and begin putting my questions for you all together but they're starting by themselves without much help from me!
climbing,ff6vgxu,t1_ff5x2st,1579635714.0,I really think we will! I would love to watch climbers there. Where is Owl Tower? Do you mind being watched when you're climbing? You probably don't even really acknowledge the fact as I would think you have bigger things to be thinking about.
climbing,ff6v01m,t1_ff622z5,1579635442.0,"Thank you so much I will definitely be checking out the site you kindly included for me. I have been made to feel so welcome on this sub, despite being a total non-climber. The willingness to overlook my lack of actual experience is very kind indeed and I thank you for it! 

I can't explain why I am so interested in the subject really. As a child I loved to climb anything I could ( long long time ago now) but I wouldn't have been able to progress from the usual stuff kids climb to great high rock faces or, heaven forbid, actual mountains.

I clearly recall years ago now, and before I'd started reading about the matter, applying a ton of thought as to how, on long climbs, the climbers got to rest if they were literally on a sheer face, then finding out with absolute and utter amazement that they actually fix 'ledges' or frames, climb on and Good God actually sleep on them!! It blew me away, really it did and it still has the same effect on me to this day. I am in complete awe. 

I have a shelf of books about climbs - a couple by Joe Simpson, a Jon Krakauer (sp?), one called The White Spider, the well known Everest one's, The Eiger (love the story of the Eiger rescues) and more, though I noted whilst visiting at Christmas that my equally non-climbing eldest daughter has pinched a few of them. I want them back too!

Maybe it's in the genes that we are committed 'armchair in the warm at not much higher than ground level climbing enthusiasts'. You guys on the other hand, don't just have an interest (it surely can't be termed a hobby?!?) which requires, at the most basic level, a combination of courage and insanity, you're also, judging by my initial interactions in this sub, very gracious and kind and I am now off to get my questions together with apologies in advance."
climbing,ff6iwyn,t1_ff66mw0,1579628175.0,Thank you so much for the info! Is any time of the year good to go? And is it perfectly normal for people such as my cowardly self to stand and gawp at climbers? It all sounds so exciting - wish I could go right away.
Fibromyalgia,ff6eb2e,t1_ff67ztr,1579625329.0,"My daughter also reminded me that I'd been prescribed high doses of Prednisalone (think Prednisone in the US?) after a diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis. I don't recall it having a huge effect on the Fibromyalgia, but this doesn't, by any means, mean that it didn't, I just have a bad memory for many things! 

During my hospital stay however, I was also told by the Consultant that my Vitamin D levels were, to use his description, 'in your boots' and it was suggested that I spent most of my life inside the house. I worked on the farm (still do) and had just spent every day, from first to last light, outside - and very long days they were too as it was summertime.

I took Vit D supplements for years and it has stabilised now - I think! I do have Osteoporosis however, and suffer from severe pain sometimes from old horse riding injuries. My paternal Grandmother had severe Rheumatoid Arthritis, my Father had Rickets as a boy. I often think that this has some, as yet undiscovered, bearing on the issues I have, and have had for a long time - some from childhood, especially the Fibromyalgia. Maybe there's a genetic component to it all? 

I hope I live long enough to see some major medical discoveries about this debilitating Fibro condition though. It affects so many people, and it would give me great satisfaction to see it finally acknowledged properly, from the rooftops if necessary."

climbing,ff5rz52,t3_erqz8u,1579607968.0,"Jesus Mesus you climbers are nuts. Here I sit comfortably looking at the stuff you do in absolute amazement.

I used to love to leap about on the big boulders along part of the coast when we lived in Gibraltar, and I used to love climbing trees. But just as I love reading books about people climbing mountains, and was spellbound by Free Solo (and the other one about Alex Honnold friend) I prefer, especially at my age, to be a warm, safe and relaxed onlooker.

An old mate and I are planning on heading to the States next year and I am hoping to steer us to somewhere I can see some people climbing on large rocks and rock faces. 

If any of you see an old lady standing with her mouth agape and eyes like saucers watching you tackle a climb and occasionally covering her eyes, possibly stifling a scream now and again, just ignore me. I will try not to put you off.

I lurk about on here, and as I said, I love to read about, and watch stuff about what you do. This means that I have quite a lot of questions and am building up the courage to ask them, because some may seem somewhat stupid. Fascinating to me though."

Looked at the picture of the jacket. I think BGs is more like the jackets I wear when working with the horses on the farm. In the UK they're called anything from Harringtons (more of a classic fashion item)  Blouson jackets (in the Equine clothing section) and jockey jackets - ditto. I have a few. They're good because you can put on a t-shirt, hoodie etc etc underneath when it's nippy out and fill all the pockets inside and out with all sorts of crap...carrots, phone and so on.

Thanks so much again for taking the time to answer my question."

DelphiMurders,ff4m6k7,t1_f24o3rz,1579566978.0,"I have followed the case and read the many posts on this sub with great interest, but have yet to comment as I don't think I'm anywhere near as good as most of you at thoroughly grasping all the facts, but I'd like to reference the Imgur frames in your post.

In many of them, on what would be BG left arm, is that a manufacturer logo on the upper sleeve of his jacket? In 28 of the pictures I see a white shape (triangular?) but perhaps it's just the way the light is catching?

I really don't want to fall into the trap of adding 2x2 and coming up with 6, along with my natural inclination to err on the side of caution, but nevertheless I would really like to know what others think. In 12 of the frames I see it fairly clearly, in others it's faint and/or blurred.

I am probably allowing myself to go off on a bit of a tangent. Curious though, to know what you all think."
winterporn,ff45y75,t1_ff43rip,1579556266.0,"I have watched a couple of documentaries about Sandy and it looks terrifying to me. Almost biblical. Is that the one where the power in NYC went out? 

Snow that deep is absolutely mad! I think what we experienced during the blizzard conditions I mention in my previous post would be fairly normal for you guys. 

I do remember going over into what we call 'the back field' to get hay out to the horses and being thankful I'd left the engine running on the car and the headlights on up by the gate. It was a few hundred yards away, and because it was twilight and the snow was coming down very fast and full it got hard to see where I needed to be, or exactly where I was.

The snowed in village looked beautiful - like the picture on a Christmas card. No cars on the road apart from the one's which could handle it. The pub stayed open and did a good trade because nobody could go to work. 

We have a barn cat and I made her a house out of a box lined with polystyrene and surrounded by an old winter sleeping bag. An oil filled radiator at the back for central heating and she slept it all away! 

I have good memories of it, and so do most other people. They love to remember it, and everyone has a couple of good stories they enjoy reminiscing over. I don't know if it's quite the same thing with you, and perhaps we wouldn't be so fond of our big blizzards if we were dealing with the kind of thing you do. It's easy to forget about the homeless people trying to live in it and the poor stray animals."

I have known deep loss, I know you will one day reach a place where you can acknowledge that while she isn't here, she hasn't gone.

You won't forget how she sounded when she spoke, or what her laughter sounded like. She won't fade. The pain you're feeling will ease, I promise, but not yet. It will happen when it's supposed to, and you will be able to step up and forward for her child. He is going to need you.

We had what was, for us in the UK, bad snow conditions almost a year ago in March (or was it the previous year?) and experienced blizzard conditions. We had to get the tractor with the bucket on to dig a way through the snow so we could get to the animals on the farm, including the horses as the snow had reached the tops of all the gates. 

The only traffic which could get very far were 4x4s, and I remember picking up people trying to walk into town from where they'd had to abandon their vehicles.

I drove to the petrol station and grabbed cigarettes, juice, tons of crisps (chips in the US) chocolate, dog food and.....toilet paper. They were just closing up and heading home. The guy behind the counter said 'getting the essentials I see'.

I'm not the best person to be able to advise you about Heroin but I'm sure someone will be along soon to do that, and it will be good advice so take note of what they say. I know they won't condemn you for the lapse. It's normal during this difficult process I believe. You went 9 days and that's got to count for something. 

I do know that when you stop any form of Opioid/Opiate that it will affect your mood greatly and can make you feel very very low indeed. Do you think this is what's happening? Maybe you need some counselling along with trying to get off Heroin.

Most of all, don't give up on life please. At least give yourself a good fighting chance to see how it feels without H. You never know - you may like it. You may even love it, so please try. Much love to you and please take notice of what else comes up on here."

AskReddit,feegupp,t3_eo9795,1579033484.0,"Please can someone put an old lady out of her miserable ignorance and answer a couple of questions for me?

What is 'fapping'. It doesn't matter if the answer is rude, I still want to know. 

When a post has thousands of comments, say 5.7k, and I want to 'like or vote' it, does my vote still register even though there's so many votes the number isn't changed by my vote but the figure/amount just goes orange?

When a post is new I've noticed that there will be comments but no votes as yet. When I vote/like it the word 'vote' just goes orange in acknowledgement. Why doesn't it tell us there's 1 vote?

I hope it's ok to ask here with apologies for my lack of knowledge, and for asking in the wrong place. I love Reddit but am not the best with all the terms - doxxing, and others too numerous to mention!"
Sneks,feeer3a,t1_fedl54r,1579032246.0,"I am so interested to hear why this is? We only have one 'poisonous' snake in the UK, the very shy Viper or Adder. I would really like to hear why you say it's adorable when Corn snakes rattle?

My horse is an old experienced mare who, when we're out, will always make a point of walking on any grass rather than the harder surface of the lanes around here. She likes her comfort!

Last summer, very early on a morning just beginning to warm, we were out and she absolutely would not walk up onto the verge - really strange and unusual for her. 

Each time I put her back on the grass she'd step back off and bring us forward on our way. Her ears were going all the time so I knew she could hear something, all I could hear were the birds. She also began snorting - 'talking' to me. I knew she was telling me something but I had no idea what. I let her have her way because she is wise and onto the road we went. 

After a short time I watched an Adder slide out from the grass on the verge and lay still on the road. A little further there was another and I paid the attention that my lovely old mare was trying to get some minutes before. She knew. 

And I went on a bit of a ramble there sorry lol, but would love it if you would tell me about your comment regarding the Corn snake!!"
OpiatesRecovery,feechpi,t1_fee3zm1,1579030921.0,"Thank you so much for your response. I am genuinely interested and can clearly recall suddenly understanding why people can become addicted once I was prescribed opiates/opioids. 

 I know of course they're s'posed to give you a sense of well-being. When chronic, and sometimes quite acute pain is brought into the equation it stands to reason that you're going to be feeling pretty good when you have something that's going to get rid of it. 

If emotional pain is helped by them too then it's much easier to see why they're used in a non-prescribed setting, or perhaps why people end up using Heroin. I have gained new insight."
