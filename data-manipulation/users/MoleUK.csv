Amd,ff6ku5s,t1_ff5p1nr,1579629348.0,Yeah most of the concerns re: power usage and PSU capacity aren't warranted. A 500W PSU will run 99% of setups without issue.
unitedkingdom,fdopiri,t1_fdolk5i,1578609980.0,"I'd agree, except it looks like they're going to rebrand as US style celebrities.

Not sure it's going to get any better for them, US tabloids are also trash."
funny,fdkvg9j,t1_fdk7gmt,1578511983.0,"This is why Mandalorian caught me by surprise. They kept things small and focused, with minor developments that could pan out over time. Worldbuilding and storytelling.

Alternatively the movies vomited AT-AT's, Xwings, Tie fighters, the force and lightsabers all over the screen."

LabourUK,fcxc24i,t1_fcxbrjh,1578058791.0,">Do you think targeted assasinations against the director of the CIA and Bolton are legitimate targets, especially conducted if done in the form of bombing an international airport and killing civilians in the process?

In response to what? I'd need the larger context, given this strike wasn't out of the blue.

But plenty of foreign Govts would kill the director of the CIA in response to a US aggression if they thought they could get away with it.

Every strike comes with collatoral damage or risks thereof. There is no clean method of warfare."
LabourUK,fcxbwrr,t1_fcxbtx2,1578058664.0,Moralising? Everyone has bloody hands. His in particular.
LabourUK,fcx9nvw,t1_fcx9ksu,1578056576.0,Ya I do wonder what the goal was. I'm hoping it's not Trump being Trump or thinking it'd help him in the polls.
LabourUK,fcx9f44,t1_fcx65bo,1578056341.0,"It's a dumb move that is going to blow up in Trumps face, imo.

But it's a mistake to ignore what Iran has been up to, they are far from having clean hands and the General in question was one of the worst.

Unfortunately his replacement is unlikely to be any better."
LabourUK,fcx90cr,t1_fcx4rxg,1578055936.0,"Iran has already been killing US militairy personell in Iraq and elsewhere, often personally at the direction of the assassinated General in question.

I don't see this as a smart foreign policy move, it's only going to make things worse in the middle-east as Iran retaliates via proxies and cyber warfare.

But I'd argue the guy was a perfectly legit target considering what he has had the Quds doing the past decade or so."
LabourUK,fcsagj9,t1_fcr4qcu,1577913783.0,"He's had the knife ready at Corbyn's back for well over a year.

I say that as a constituent of his who voted for him. He's not dim and saw that was coming, played it close to Corbyn et al but not too close.

Good luck to him."
LabourUK,fckbsa1,t1_fcjym1j,1577721765.0,Try the last 40.
LabourUK,fcjvbyd,t1_fcjuuil,1577706523.0,"I suspect it's just the inevitable buildup to a split. 

Blaming Corbyns landslide defeat on Blairites et al, then freaking out if/when more establishment figures regain control of Labour. Then the split."
LabourUK,fcdof9v,t3_eh3ih8,1577611937.0,"You should be consuming as much media from alternative political viewpoints as you can stand, imo. Not withdraw from them and only read sources you think are more friendly to your opinions or politics.

Otherwise you're creating your own bubble on purpose. And look how well that bubble prepared the left for the last generation election result.

Just something to keep in mind, i'm not disagreeing with supporting smaller publications with your clicks and subscriptions by any means. But keep the content wide and the sources vetted."
todayilearned,fcav0e6,t1_fcaupmu,1577577155.0,"I'll have to give it a watch.

Didn't hear anything about it when it dropped I guess."
todayilearned,fcauqnq,t1_fcaqydv,1577576998.0,American Dad got better when it left Fox for TBS imo. Then it got increasingly off the rails.
todayilearned,fcaug2x,t1_fcaouiv,1577576833.0,"South Park has been hit and miss for years. Maybe since the beginning tbh.

But when they hit, oh boy."
todayilearned,fcauazu,t1_fcar88y,1577576756.0,There was a season 2?
unitedkingdom,fbzuydh,t1_fbztn12,1577262937.0,"Or: Corbyn was the worst labour leader in it's history. On both a PR and strategic level.

It'd help if the membership admitted it made a huge fucking mistake."
