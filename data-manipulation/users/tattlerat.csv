Here, you have 1 month to submit your bid, oh here's a 100 page document to sift through to replace the siding on a building, and we've listed somewhere in there a specific damp proofing membrane we want to use despite this product having not been used in this part of the country in years. And if anything is wrong or site conditions cause complications we're holding you to that price you gave us.

Many if his supporters or voters will change their tune on him over time and like the Iraq war votes their names will be all over his corrupt government. I’d be making moves to distance myself from him if I had any real political aspirations for the future.

That’s how public speaking works. You write down what you want to say, sometimes with the help of someone you trust who can write your ideas down more eloquently than yourself?

So is every single public speaker in history a puppet reading from a script? Is every activist meant to be angry and sour at all times? None of these arguments make any sense.

Toews was a part of one of the dynastic WJC team Canada run with lots if talent And those two Olympic teams were arguably the best hockey teams ever assembled. Their NHL attributes are fair game as they’ve both played for ongoing contenders. I’d say 250 more points in less games is pretty telling. Defensive play is important but I’d reckon offensive play is more important in winning games for a premiere center.

I know they were isolationist at the time but all of their allies and trade partners were in a meat grinder for years before they committed troops and it was only after Japan foolishly attacked them. 

The real issue is that watching American media or listening to some American historians or just average people talk about the war they act as if they won it single handedly and did all of the work themselves when that’s simply not true and offends the veterans of other nations and their descendants who had to rebuild their lives and nations after the most destructive conflict in human istory.

Entirely anecdotal but when I was a teenager it was a semi popular trend to be gay in my community. I knew 5 or 6 guys who said they were gay for attention, to fit in and to be “trendy”. This went on for a few years. Turns out they weren’t and when that trend died out so did their supposed homosexuality. They were never actually gay and never actually fooled around with dudes but they would tell everyone, parents included, who would listen because they knew it was the “in” thing at the time. 

I can only imagine there are some kids out there desperate enough for an identity and desperate enough to stand out from the crowd or simply impress parents and role models they look up to to buy into that same thought process on Trans. I dunno. The greater good part says it’s probably fine but the small percentage of those who might go through the hormones and blockers despite not actually being trans only to really discover that later is a bit on the tragic side.

All your pointing out is that the rules were different. What you aren’t pointing out was that the extra curricular stuff was dealt with by tough guys.

Targeting star players for cheap shots happened yes, but was dealt with. Claude Lemieux and Samuelson both got fucked up by tough players on multiple occasions for that shit and I can assure you they didn’t like it and did not feel at liberty to play like a dick without consequence.

They don’t see Iran as an enemy, or even as the actions of the few in power who make decisions but as a region of the world where millions of individuals live."

funhaus,fdoh2nr,t1_fdoe936,1578605004.0,I’d say Kovic’s looks the most like an actual portrait. He’s looking at the “camera” relatively stone faced as you would need to hold still while your having your portrait painted. And tHe hair style and beard sort of suit the era these uniforms appear to be from.

We don’t get a lot of snow these days, not nearly as much as when I was a kid, but the roads turn into a greasy horror show either way so school is still cancelled fairly frequently even now.  Snow mixes with hail, then freezing rain then rain is pretty common around these parts. Makes a real mess of the roads and school ain’t worth dying for."

Your citizens that are out for blood hear what they want and feel Like you at least got even with the death of their general, with the added benefit if your enemy not feeling the need to launch full scale war. Which helps you further because it appears that the enemy doesn’t want to fight you after the show of force."

But reddit spreading misinformation and likely causing redditors to make erroneous reports and accusations tying up valuable resources and personnel was very likely a huge issue.

halifax,fdj6zj0,t3_elkgaf,1578460212.0,"Being as I’m not in the city enough to know, I’m curious to know if there is realistically enough parking in Halifax to get all the cars off the streets. 

Halifax’s public transit doesn’t seem equipped for the population  so from my experience it seems like the city is a car heavy city and parking is a pain in the ass to find on a good day. Is the issue both a lack of capacity and a lack of regard for the plows?"
