AT&T is a Multinational Holding Conglomerate. It is primarily composed of 4 core companies named AT&T communications(cell phones!), AT&T Latin America(more cellphones!), Xandr(Advertising and Analytics), and WarnerMedia(Uh, media).

Entrepreneur,ff3jyec,t1_ff3hng9,1579542650.0,"I can’t speak for OP, but sometimes even sharing the idea can be a hard first step to take.

I struggled for years with the idea of vocalizing a pressure washing business because it felt too “small” and not lofty enough for someone like *me*.

After years in the B2B technology sector earning a salary, I’ve realized that most of the players outside of the Fortune 500 are “small” by relative terms. A lot of the people I did business with are, in fact, just like me!

All of the sudden it became less about “what” to implement and more “how” to implement it.

OP is stumbling through the what because they are experiencing a fundamental shift in the way they think.

My best advice for them is to start trying things immediately and pre-pay ~12 months worth of bills. At the end of that 12 months, you’ll know whether you need to get another job or ask Reddit to help weigh the options of your carefully established business plan."

If we have trouble establishing the time period in which any of this would have taken place to begin with, how are we able to definitively state that not enough time has passed for evidence to be buried or destroyed?

What if the center of their empire was built in the Chicxulub crater?

Maybe the earliest mining operations took place hundreds of feet below the seabed of the ocean between Great Britain and Scandinavia?

The trouble I have comprehending this statement is that we have almost no record of *human* history, yet our understanding of geological history predates modern humans and is infallible?

Most likely not.

The truth is, we really don’t know how much time has passed and what happened as it did.

Geological and topographical features vary drastically now from our target time period.

What if tools and evidence of these people can be found in the Lost Lands?

Long story short, I don’t actually believe there was a technology advanced race of humans that predate our generally understood timeline of earthly history.

I also don’t believe we should say that there wasn’t simply because we haven’t found a rusted axe imprint in a cave somewhere."
