Horses,ff4xytp,t3_erhr31,1579575137.0,I love her.  And her name is adorable.   My kind of girl.  Cheers to you for giving her a home. It’s a lot of work but so rewarding.  Here’s to many  years together
Horses,fdw10fm,t1_fdu2fl4,1578753929.0,She loves the mud. I think it’s because she loves to get brushed and groomed.  She is a girlie girl but just like me. Loves to get dirty
Horses,fdw0n9b,t1_fdvlyfq,1578753765.0,"We ride on rocky trails.    She only has shoes in the front  some horses do not need shoes but she has what is comparable to weak finger nails.  They chip and split without shoes.  It is a huge expenditure. I wish I didn’t have to shoe her. It costs 150 every 6 weeks.   I tried to barefoot her with those boots. The problem is the boots fall off a lot.    Much like women like to go get a manicure, this princess loves our Ferrier and runs to the gate when he arrives.  I pleasure ride with my father who has Parkinson’s three times a week.   He used to compete all my life.   The riding keeps his symptoms at bay. But our horses love to ride as much as we do.  Great question.  It’s a good topic for conversation about horse care"
Horses,fdvyu44,t1_fdvworj,1578753215.0,We had a horse named Doctor that was my moms.  She would always say “ I have a doctor appointment which meant she had to go ride.   Our favorite bar in Cabo was called the office.  I love my mom always said she had a meeting at the office.  Love that lady

Horses,fdtbhqb,t1_fdt8l0w,1578714417.0,He must have put on oil on them before this pic. Give her a  night  in the pasture and they won’t look so great in the morning.  She is a dirty girl

widowers,fcxn9y0,t3_ejdhv4,1578066995.0,"It will be 8 years next month that I lost my young husband suddenly.   What you are feeling I call “ widow brain “ it serves as a shock absorber. It keeps you from dying of a broken heart. 
You will pull through this. You have no other choice. Do you have children ? I have two sons. Kids make your  grief complicated. I am going through delayed grief.  They first years I wasn’t allowed or wouldn’t allow myself to grieve. I was too busy worrying about their grief.   PM if you need someone to talk to"
