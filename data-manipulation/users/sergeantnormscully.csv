We're facing a lot of emergencies right now- climate, treatment of migrants, etc.- that we need to address as soon as possible. It's tempting to want to say that letting Trump win again could help kick Democrats into gear towards more progressive candidates, and I feel this way myself sometimes. But we're gambling with people's lives here, and allowing four more years of Trump harming everything is not the answer. Like many of those kids at the border who are separated from their families are being irreparably traumatized while we wait, and Trump is undoing as many environmental protections as he can while we wait, etc. We are running out of time and Biden is not the answer, but Trump is far worse for everyone.

I think part of it is also that the sub is devoted to anger- righteous anger, but still- and that makes the community as a whole itch for a fight whenever they're on it. And that combined with them being hit by trolls all the time tends to make the users see the worst in others, making mods have to also work overtime to compensate for reports and compounding the problem.

It's semantically like saying ""blacks"" instead of ""black people,"" again not that saying ""Democrat party"" is even close to being that bad. This way, the Republican party gets to sound like a party of regular people, just with a modifier, while the Democrat party sounds like some group of ""others"" whose identity is fully defined by their party instead of it just being one facet.

Just as a test, I put some on one hand and not the other before bed to see if it moisturized even a little, but the next day I almost forgot which hand I put it on because there was no difference. I don't even know how that's possible. 

It sucks because I like the smell, but I hate the smell of other coconut-scented things."

TheRightCantMeme,fds547q,t1_fdrxtwo,1578694561.0,"Yup. Not that looks matter, but I prefer the one on the left. Of course the one on the right is very pretty, but in a posed, generic way that you can see any time you want on Instagram. Nothing wrong with that, but it kind of gets boring after a while. The one on the left is cute, and she looks happy and full of personality."

Women were tired of their husbands overspending on alcohol, which would then also make them more violent at home. They were desperate and people didn't know as much as we do now that banning stuff doesn't work.

Maybe sometimes those evil females have a point if you try to listen to them instead of brushing them off as shrill Karens."
