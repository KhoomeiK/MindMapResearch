No one would benefit from our government holding that kind of power. 

I do concede that stronger legislation would help such as banning foreign ownership and airbnb, vacant property taxes, speculation penalties on 'flipping', zoning for densification, mandating a higher percentage of affordable units be included in new buildings, bringing interests rates up to a realistic level so people aren't over-leveraging themselves solely because it is so cheap to borrow etc. If our government is aware of and unwilling to implement these changes then I think you'd be pretty disappointed with what their version of nationalized housing would actually look like."

What about people who aren't staying for decades and don't want to buy because they don't want to be tied down to a specific area for the rest of their lives? How do you propose housing works if there are no landlords and therefore no rental units anywhere? Landlords literally do the opposite of limiting people's access to housing. They provide housing to those that cannot yet afford or do not want to buy housing. Holding the belief of landlord=bad is very myopic.

Your last paragraph I think is where I get caught up. I understand the part of ""you can't suddenly do that and expect to attract talent over your competitor"", but I don't understand how we ever got to the point that deals were made in such a way that a CEO somehow doesn't have to go down with the ship; if the company is successful and that is directly attributable to a CEO then sure, they should stand to profit the most. It doesn't make sense to me that a company can be run in to the ground and a CEO can walk away with millions while people's entire livelihoods/pensions/severance/income can be wiped out.

If the guy is so good that they need to be offered millions I'd expect them to be compensated as such so long as the company continues to do well. But how can catastrophic failure be compensated to such a degree? Or to put it another way, if the CEO thinks they're worth that much because they have the talent to back it up, then surely they won't fail, which means you don't need to offer tens of millions in compensation in the event they run the company into the ground as surely it'll never happen if they are in fact such a high-value sure-thing.
