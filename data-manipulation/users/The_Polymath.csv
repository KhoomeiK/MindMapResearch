Our fermenters are ""open"" in that they're not certified pressure vessels. We figure it was probably a fingerprint inside one of the fermenters from when one of us went to check.

As hard core as we are about cleaning it surprised everyone. All I can say is get germapobic about sanitation and try again.


Edit: not skunked as that is a function of UV light on beer. What we thought was a pellicle turned out to be an infection.


Edit2: We found the source of our infection, the drain tubes on the bottom of our fermentation vessels were building up stone faster than we thought and it bit us in the ass. Now its scrub like hell with PBW followed by Starsan after every transfer to secondary. Lessons learned the hard way."

 I know a man who was running a refugee camp near the Uganda South Sudan border back in the 70s. They needed food and he knew there was a small herd near the camp. They had an ancient double rifle chambered for .470 Nitro Express. He thought it would be overkill.

Apparently not. The first round skipped off the bull's forehead head like a Panzer shrugging off an anti-tank shell. Just pissed it off. He put the second round through its heart which staggered it but not enough to slow it down. 

He was so damn scared he only managed to fumble one more round into the gun and fire before the bull dropped. Said that had he not gotten the third shot off the bull would have trampled him before it bled out. The second round penetrated heart but not enough for the hydrostatic shock to do any significant instantaneous damage.

Guy was a stand up member of the community, didn't hide his past, and actually took quiet pride in how he'd turned his life around. Most folks liked him and didn't make a big deal out of his mistakes. Made good money as a welder. 

Anyway, he said prison wasn't that bad once you adjusted to it. It was getting attacked and then shot by the homeowner he was trying to rob that made him decide crime was not a long term plan. Said the man tackled him, took his gun and gut shot him before he could run. It was fear of the victim that changed his mind.

That conversation has stuck with me since I was a teenager. It's always made me critical of prison systems and legislation that criminalizes self defense.

In regards to criminal statistics, we really do need a national standard for metrics and classification that keeps track of the officers, judges, and other law enforcement personnel involved along side offenders.

However it's too easy to jam, maintenance intensive, an can only manage 500 RPM at its fastest setting. On top of this it utilizes an electric motor and chain drive to cycle the bolt. No power no boom. As the chain stretches it throws the timing off and is difficult to diagnose without a dedicated armory or weapon tech nearby.

For such a low rate of fire they could have gotten away with a downscaled Bofors or upscaled M2 Browning; both having the advantage of being recoil operated.
