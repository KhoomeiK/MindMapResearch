Maybe tell them they can come to see you next time, that way they can make the decision and stick to it without pressure. Maybe just say you have an “open door policy” with them and see if they ever show up. Chances are they won’t show up unannounced unless they need to, which is a good reason to be there for them. Don’t completely excommunicate them, but don’t go out of your way to make things work for them if they don’t want to attempt the same with you."
