I wanted to say the only thing I have not experienced are the rape horrorstories, but I guess my first ever GM saying at the end of the session if my character would have not taken the distraction and left the drunkard, she would have been raped, kinda counts probably.  
(first session, I had no idea what to do, guy flirts and drinks and I am like.. omg what shall I do? In the moment it was not great, but now with time and years in between it feels almost worse \^\^"")"

And Even if other PCs backstory has no relevance (why???), there is still other things:

\- Destroy the cult once and for all, so no one can get hurt again?  
\- Find a place to settle, an area to protect, get a stronghold.  
\- find out rekindling a relationship after one has been dead is hard (if evil, let wife even lowkey resent them like Buffy. Dangerous move but possible)  
\- find more money, as most their money still went to the spell and one still needs to eat

DnDGreentext,ff6e6th,t1_ff5j7ji,1579625255.0,"I think it is also a question of how long the plot has been going on and how the players feel after that point.  
From the sounds of it, it was already a couple of months at least, if not more. On one quest line, that afterwards doesn't have a resolution but only a further pull.

I am speaking from my own (yes negatively) experience, but after a while it could become just to much. To much limelight, to much on one plot, and players maybe just want to finally succeed.  


We can't know this here, and a part of me does find the idea and the possibilities of why the soul of the wife would be in hell a very cool story.  
But I also had been in campaigns, where quest after quests where tailored to one player, with nothing in between for others, and that colours my perspective."

I was in a campaign, where the first year was pretty good. The story was overall doing its best with being equal, with a slight favour towards my character. So as he died, I happily said that the other PC should have main spotlight for now, and we just slowly see how my new pc interworks with it..

Well, in a way I got my wish (though not easily entering the party, oh no. That one was a nightmare of players trying to put themself into a knot so I could join).  Nearly a year again focused on the other PC. Than another Player joined us, he barely got anything too.   


By the end, I felt disconnected to the game, like I never really got anything to do with my Character and never connected to her and all asking from all of us for the future plotlines to not be around the other PC were for naught.

There is some other stuff, but see how long this already got? The end of it was that I left, after I couldn't take it anymore and months later after the remaining players had a talk about the same problem (STILL!) he finally worked on it.

DMAcademy,fdkz0k0,t3_elubgf,1578514083.0,"Like others have said, its mostly a yes/no thing. There is nothing inherently wrong with it, but a couple of stepping stones you could stumble across.

First and foremost, get the players to agreement towards your plans. Be willing to potential compromise.  Worldbuilding is best, in my opinion, than the GM takes the players side into account too (I say that both as a player and GM with lots of Homebrew-Worldbuilding myself. I feel the proudest, than I know I have created something together with my players.)Of course, if something is important to you - explain why. Compromise always can go both ways.

Now my thoughts to the more specific cases here:

&#x200B;

**No Gods:** A fair approach, but ask yourself: Would the people still believe in a god or not? Just because gods are not a tangible force, doesn't mean that their may be no religions. you can even make it work for you, with crazy cults and the like.

&#x200B;

**Classic Faction:** That one would be a bit harder for me personally. I like reflavoring classes for getting the right mechanics. But I could deal.. just don't be to strict and make sure that it allows the players flexibility. Let's go with Bards: They can be womanizer Popstars, or Loremasters who spend all their days in Libraries or Spies who infiltrate kingdoms to get out information for their own means. Give some room for breathing, so to speak.Also don't forget - the 1%. What are PCs but the special someone who may have things running a bit different for them. Players love it. Keep it at least in mind.

&#x200B;

**Traditional Races:** Well, I don't really have a lot of information here. In general axing races is okay, but players often like differences. Some in fluff, other in crunch. As long as you have some races, it should be fine.Another way to bridge it, is offering a reskin of races you don't want fluff-wise but allowing them mechanical wise. Like Gnomes are more nature-orientated Halflings, and Dwarves are Halflings that are interesting in mining and creating items. Stupid example maybe, but you may get what I mean.

What I did for my last setting, where I basically only allowed humans, was reskinning the different subraces to be humans, that were touched in a way. Like Aasimars were now humans, who had a divine blessing on them. Feytouched were effectively a mix of elf and half-elves, who either were kidnapped as a child from fey, or promised to a fey or whatever the player could think off.(I also spun the homebrew further that I allowed my players to pick from pre-selected racial abilities aka Pathfinder Second Edition, but that is a different discussion.)

&#x200B;

**Exclusive Technology:** No problem in general, I think a lot of GMs do that. Just think long and hard if you want the Artificer in your game than and otherwise, rule case by case about items. But if in doubt, maybe reskin and show lenience, if its truly something the players may need. Or let them invent it. Or some NPCs may invent something down the line. After all, technology and invention never stop, right? :)But honestly, this one should probably be mostly fine."

The first a is very soft, the second nearer towards the english a, the e is short but still pretty soft. The lo part is very near the lau part, but again probably a hint softer. The e in german would sound.. like how the e would start in end, if that makes sense?

UnearthedArcana,fddmycw,t3_ekr66o,1578318208.0,"I like the idea behind it, but I think it needs some polish, to make that bow gleaming. In a lot of things, its the language. Please take all my suggestions with a grain of salt :) English isn't my first language.  


Sniper Magic - You forgot to replace Deepwood Sniper with Gloomstalker. Fairly useful spells all in all, I dig it.  


Flawless Vision - between *eyesight* and the next sentence about *true strike* is a dot needed. I might also make something like \*Additional, your sharp eyesight\* or just something else to lead into the next sentence and make it feel like something extra.  


Snipers Intuition - language mostly again. The first part about the range sounds quiet clumsy. Maybe either say whenever you gain a future feature or on ranger level 7, 11 or 15 it increases? Also I would only give one example. Also either t*ake this means* or *for example*. Both sounds a bit redundant.  
**For example, at 7th level a Deepwood Sniper can shoot 190 feet with normal range instead of 150 feet.**   


Distracting shot - language actually seems pretty clear to me here, about from a question about this ability. So, the creature that attacked you, is it from melee, range, spell, does it matter? I think it doesn't, because you mention caster but its not quiet clear to me.  


Consistent Aim - this is a weird feature. Why specially two times? Its a strong feature, so I don't want to say it's needed to be used more, but its so weird that both level seven and eleven give you a feature that is not that often really used?   
It makes me almost think that Distracting Shot could be based on Wisdom-Modifier. That the Reaction is always at disadvantage would still not deter from an melee AoO. Though when it may have to much with bringing disadvantage on the enemy.. food for thought.  


Headshot Tactics - bam lvl 18 crit. Its written clearly again, it's strong, it's better than champion but very late.. not sure. A part of me is okay with it, specially as you can't really abuse it with mcing - but another is unsure because of what I mentioned.

The More experienced gms seem to be, the more okay they are that yes, Backgrounds can be changed. Multiclassing is allowed, though they look at why you do it. Reflavouring is way easier, also if thats how you see your character? Cool.

And did you see this cool HB on UA? I hope someone will want to try it out soon.

dndnext,fcvmbxe,t3_eiy9kp,1578005179.0,"Romances are pretty important in my games, as a lot tend to be slice of life. So romance and friendships are a pretty natural part of it.   


I mostly go with the choices the player makes in character, if the NPC likes them or not, how they generally act towards them and from where, if they show that they are interested in the NPC, that path can open up. As a bisexual woman, I am fairly easy with the sexualities of my NPCs, with a lot of them being bi or pan themself this way. 

Of course with the same coin, if a player has a character that would really appeal towards the NPCs, they might try to flirt, or akwardly ask them for a date.  


We don't do to many social rolls, they are more for key decisions or trying to get informations for quests (or stopping an NPC from doing something stupid, etc.). I use them fairly rarely, which is sometimes perhaps a mistake on my part, but for us it mostly works alright.  


The PCs can have sex with their dates, but it will be always fade to black, with sometimes a small wink that yes indeed, a good time was to be had. As it should be, right? :p  
But nothing more than that.

  
Towards stories.. mhm. I have quiet a few, but my favourite couple-romance was so far:  


\- female NPC, Police-Officer, working in a detective Agency, and part-time saving the world from the Supernatural, of course in-cognito.  
\- male NPC, hetero and asexual, he is a photographer and also someone who secretly fights against the Supernatural.   


He starts to be smitten with her, acts like a clumsy fool, while PC was very obstuse, on purpose. My NPC had the tendency to stick his foot in his mouth, and basically blurts out that he is in love with her and wants to date her.  
PC, who beforehand actually dismissed her best friend who had a livelong crush on her, says, okay, why not, we can give this a shot, though your little Brother is my boss (who is also not talking to you), and this is not too comfortable.  
What follows is a real fluff-fest, they were incredible cute with one another. It helped mend the ridges between the brothers a bit, at least till some teasing from the players and dice-rolls on the side of the GM changed fate as we know it and Boss and PC were also half-siblings. ..but that is a story for another time :p (and yes, it was very soap-opera and I enjoyed every second of it.)"
