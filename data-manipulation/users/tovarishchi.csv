It allows other signatories to the agreement to choose whether they will stop abiding by it as well. If you are still a signatory and you breach the agreement, you will be considered much less trustworthy in the future. Breaching treaties without withdrawing can also cause others to sanction you, depending on how important the treaties (and the other signatories) are.
