As for the size of human memory overall, as it is now, it seems to work in a way that we reinforce the memories that matter by constantly rewriting them (like the name of your son), while the things that don't matter tend to be forgotten (like the color of the last 3 cars you parked next to at the grocery store).

When my Blade freshly boots, it correctly detects that my monitors attached to the GTX 970 in my Core have speakers, and uses the one I have set by default. If the laptop idles long enough, the screen locks & goes dark (it is set to never go to sleep). Then when I wake the computer, most everything works, except the sound on the monitors. This wasn't the case until recently, and it doesn't happen every time. I have updated to the latest nVidia drivers (441.87). 

Another thing to note. After writing the first part, from my Razer Blade, which was detached from the Core, I reattached. After hearing the audible connection sound from Windows, the laptop became totally non-responsive to input from the integral touchpad and keyboard, as well as the keyboard and mouse attached to the Core.
