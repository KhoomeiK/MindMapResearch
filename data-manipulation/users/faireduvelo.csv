It reminded me of my own mortality. It made me think about the meaning of life. I remember the conclusion I came to: if you believe in a meaning, then that meaning is correct for you. It will serve you well. It doesn’t matter what the meaning you seek is! As long as you are seeking something wholeheartedly and devotedly.

AMA,fdb6a43,t1_fdaf6i2,1578254302.0,"I’m glad I can help. Some things to remember: 

don’t get discouraged if you go over one day. Just get back on the horse the next day. 

Any kind of exercise is good. Walking, lifting small weights, calisthenics, anything that burns energy because fat is stored energy. 

Weight loss has no momentum. If you have been steadily gaining weight for years and suddenly switch into a calorie deficit diet, you will immediately begin losing weight. It may take a while to actually happen on the scale, but the chemistry processes will begin. Similarly, if you’ve been steadily losing weight and one day you binge and eat 5000 calories (I’ve been there), it doesn’t matter. You just have to burn those calories in the future. 

I didn’t really go to the gym when I was obese. But when I lost a good amount I started going and it was so good. I started losing fat faster and started getting stronger. 

Also, once you’re fit, girls don’t know you used to be fat! I had my first kiss at age 17 when I was around 200 pounds, before that I got NO attention from girls.

Also if you lose a lot of weight you may have loose skin. It’s best to lose the weight while you’re young because your skin is so much more elastic than when you’re older. I’ve seen some progress pics of people who lost the same amount as me at an older age, they have skin hanging all off them but I don’t. 

Subscribe to r/1200isplenty , that sub focuses on calorie counting (but your goal probably shouldn’t be 1200 cals per day). 

And don’t drink soda or sugary drinks! They have so many calories! It’s a waste! Think of your daily diet as a budget, how many calories do you want to budget for breakfast, then lunch, then dinner. Sugary drinks are like wasting money from your budget. Every once in a while is fine, once you’re in the habit of counting calories. Drink water drink water drink water. 

Good luck! Feel free to DM me about any of this stuff!"
