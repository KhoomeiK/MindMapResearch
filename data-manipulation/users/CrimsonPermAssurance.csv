ResearchingDepression,ffjnr6c,t1_ffjialg,1580002512.0,"I appreciate the response, truly. Going to r/depression seemed like a good idea but it gets so flooded that I never get a response. 

In answer to your questions: I have a lot of physical complaints. To the point I feel like a hypochondriac. I've had insomnia since I was a teen. Very cyclical.  Good for a couple months, bad for a couple months. For about 25 years, it's gets old so fast. The bags under my eyes are so bad now that people think I'm sick and I have to wear concealer just to get people to stop asking. Chronic fatigue, chronic pain, frequent headaches, hypertension, chronic inflammation, acid reflux, alternating constipation/diarrhea, menstrual abnormalities since I began. I mean it got to a point that I just started making a huge list of every physical symptom or complaint I could think of. 

Ironically I have been considering integrative medicine for awhile now. My PCP is good but there is no way she can sit there and listen to everything in a 20 minute visit, esp when I only see her for 10 of that. In addition to that I also saw an endocrinologist to discuss my menstrual irregularities, and after she ran a few tests, immediately dismissed it as my weight and told me to work on ""intensive lifestyle modification"" but that I could come back early to discuss diet drugs. As a result I ended up in a tailspin where I was basically crashing fasting and maybe taking in 1000 kcal in a day sometimes less than 700. Other than that I have had the thyroid levels checked frequently and they all come back in range. General lab values shift a bit here and there, but are more or less in range. Only thing right now is a slight anemia, very slight, like 1/2 a point.

I see a pysch NP and a therapist. My therapist is versed in numerous techniques, including EBP approaches for trauma and has worked with the VA treating vets. And nothing against her, she's really good and I'm lucky to be able to see her, just things are spiraling out of control so fast right now no one can keep up. The whole tipping point came two weeks ago thru a series of events at work that made the entire environment feel directly hostile and the message I sent to my manager gave her immediate concern for my safety. (My personal skew is of course that they only acted out of liability, not concern.) All of this resulted in an immediate safety evaluation by employee health and them taking me out of work for a week. But as they felt I am no longer a threat to myself, am safe to return. What I am trying to do is work on getting my manager or employer to make immediate and drastic changes to my working environment upon my return. 

I have intermittent FMLA in place but this may need to be expanded. I currently am exploring more intensive outpatient programs, whether that be PHP or IOP. I have also done the GeneSight testing to hopefully gain some insight on better medication choices. That won't be back until Monday at best. I have been thru several medication classes, SSRI, SNRI, and atypical. Most of them were either only partially effective or effective at the cost of significant side effects. I would have to be that one really rare person that SSRI and SNRI actually gives EPS side effects. Currently I am only on a mood stabilizer and that is just not cutting it. And I am also in process of pursuing neuropsych testing to get more definitive diagnoses. 

I desperately feel that there is some larger underlying issue. No one knows what it is, doesn't have the time to look for it, or just thinks I'm being dramatic. And don't even get me started on the 4 hour rabbit hole I went down researching CYP450 gene variants,  their related disorders, and how they affect medication metabolism. I have just enough education to be dangerous. (My buddy personally feels I may have Asperger's, but I'll hold judgement until any kind of formalized testing.)

Anyways, thanks for listening. This is actually the first response I have gotten anywhere after voicing any kind of concerns. I also appreciate the scientific approach."
ResearchingDepression,ffje6l7,t3_d36be2,1579996377.0,"I'll try to keep it brief, as if I get left to my own devices I will write ridiculously large pieces.

* Home environment as a child: My father did 2 tours in Vietnam. I am certain that he has PTSD and depression as a result. He has not received any kind of therapy, medication, treatment, as far as I know. He self medicates with alcohol on a regular basis. He's not a violent drunk, but very paranoid. My mother is stoic to the point of it being inappropriate affect. My father would want to talk and have emotional conversations only when intoxicated, whereas my mother was pretty much nothing all of the time. There was no verbal declarations of praise, love, or satisfaction in my family.
* Only big health issue of note in my late teens was a MVA I was a passenger in. Whiplash and lower back injuries.
* First serious relationship, he cheated, got her pregnant, we got back together, went into the Army, I got pregnant, he left and stayed away for 18 years. 19, single mom, postpartum depression, started nursing school.
* Relationship two in my early 20s. He seemed outwardly stable, had a job, his own place, although he claimed OCD. He gets behind doing is work, has a backlog of paperwork from months prior. He quits before being fired. Moves in with my son and I. Cue the next 7 years or physical, verbal, emotional, and financial abuse. The only reason he is gone now was that my father intervened and put it in no uncertain terms that his meal ticket was used up. 
   * During this time I experienced my first major episode of severe depression. I started seeing a psychiatrist. Threw a bunch of pills at me, up the dose, change the med, up the dose, and progressed to much worse interventions.
* As the abuser was moving out, I had begun playing a MMO. Started talking to one guy pretty seriously. Started exchanging emails, pictures, phone calls. Ended up driving like 600 miles each way one weekend to meet him in person and spent the weekend together in a hotel. As things progressed, it became a long distance relationship. Every other month I would go there or he would come here. In the beginning the abuser would still call every day and stop by my home unexpectedly to talk or ask for things. One time this happened while the new guy was here. So, he had a talk with the abuser. Never saw him since.
   * New guy eventually moves to where I am and moves in. Everything seems to be going well. Never argue or fight. Gradually he starts staying up really late (as he has a telework job doesn't have to get up to go to work) well past when I've gone to bed, he's taking trips out of town ""for work"", getting more distant. Tells me now that me not being religious is an issue and that he doesn't want to get remarried. He leaves and I heard after 6 months he was remarried.
* Second bout of severe depression. I end up packing my entire house into a storage unit and take a travel nursing job for the next 3.5 years. Longest I stayed in any one place was 9 months. 
* Moved to where I am now. My job is very stressful, we are critically understaffed, and now our vacation policy is absolutely draconian. My mental health has been declining to the point where, in my rage, desperation, and frustration, I sent a message to my manager, which in turn necessitated an urgent visit to employee health for a safety evaluation.

&#x200B;

* Various symptoms, (in no particular order) include: 
   * Anxiety (at home, at work, and in private)
   * Rumination (I overthink everything. Did I do something wrong, did I forget something)
   * Poor self esteem/body image disturbance (reinforced by the callous treatment I received from a physician and the resultant blow off I got from patient relations when I lodged a complaint.)
   * Restlessness (From bouncing my right foot constantly to sucking on my tongue or pressing it against my teeth all the time.)
   * Mood volatility ( I can go from being fairly blah in the morning, to full on panic attack, to crying in the shower because I'm too tired to wash my hair, to taking down the Xmas tree/Putting up a shelf in the closet/completely replacing a fixture - all in one day)
   * Low mood (All of the time now. I might listen to something that will make me laugh, but's good for about 10 minutes)
   * Inappropriate affect ( Outwardly- composure is paramount. You DO NOT cry in public, you do not share feelings, you don't ask for help \[unless desperate\], you trust absolutely no one)
   * The biggest one lately is that I am finding nearly all sources of external stimuli to be noxious. I can't handle a lot of light, more than one or two sounds at a time, I can't be around a lot of people or in a crowd, and so on. 

I mean there is so much more, but this post is huge now. I'm struggling to cope as I need to work for the income and insurance coverage, but job feels hostile. I have to go back on Monday and I'm in an absolute state of panic over it."
cancer,ffiuhfh,t1_ffiqp16,1579983033.0,"I have personally never had a port, however, I work in oncology and see numerous patients a day that have them. Some patients dislike having them, but also understand the necessity. Some don't mind them. Some will even leave them long after treatment is done.

The biggest day to day concerns that I hear many patients talk about when their port interacts with everyday tasks; probably top of that list is seat belts (of all things). For ports placed to the chest, there is a possibility that a seat belt chest strap may lay over the port. So a padded pillow that you can place around the chest strap over the port site makes this more comfortable. 

Probably second place is the way that contact with the port area feels in regards to clothing or touch. If they place the port deep enough, there is plenty of fatty tissue over top to provide a cushion. The biggest impact to this (in relation to chemo) is change to the tissue dynamics where the port is. Big changes to weight can affect the amount of tissue around the port. And (mostly for women) any kind of breast surgery. Whether this is removal of breast tissue or the placement of expanders or implants. (Not that I counsel against any of these interventions in any way, just that it can affect positioning. Ideally you need to do what is in your best interest for physical health and to reinstate your satisfaction with outward appearances/body image and self esteem.)

Third concern for some patients is how visible the port is to others. While the access point may be hidden under clothes, the catheter portion may be outwardly visible. (The catheter for chest ports typically comes over the collarbone.) It's not huge, maybe the size of a swizzle stick/plastic coffee stirrer. Some folks don't care, some do. 

Generally, I would say that the majority of patients, in their usual day to day activities do not find it a hindrance. Also, access points for ports can be placed to either the chest or inner part of the upper arm. Just something to consider. 

Probably best suggestion I can offer when getting a port, once you decide on placement location, is wearing appropriate clothing on treatment days. You can find special port shirts that have a zipper or velcro opening to be able to get at the port. But it doesn't have to be fancy; you can just wear a button down or some kind of low cut or V neck type shirt. You can come in wearing a turtleneck if you want, but you may have to take off or lift up your shirt to get accessed. Arm ports, probably a short sleeve or sleeveless undershirt.

Hope that helps."
cancer,ffh40tp,t3_eti5j8,1579922514.0,"I will also say that on occasion ports will develop something called a platelet or fibrin sheath on the end of the catheter. This acts as a one way valve, allowing flushes, fluids, or chemo to come through but close off when you try to pull back on the line. Typically the treatment of choice is TPA (albeit in much smaller doses than on a stroke or heart attack indication) to dissolve that sheath. This is not an uncommon occurrence and most places will also flush a port with Heparin before removing the needle, to help prevent these sheaths. 

Obtaining adequate blood return from a port before every use is an important safety factor, for the aforementioned leaks or diversion of catheters. 

Hope this helps."
nursing,ffgi98l,t3_ethpsp,1579906841.0,I knew one that would save them to take to a Sunday school class to use for art projects. Back in the day she used to really covet the large yellow one from Reclast. I don't think that one comes in a glass container anymore.
cancer,ffghpz0,t1_ffgdsie,1579906493.0,"If they use sedation, it's more along the lines of either a benzo (like Ativan) or they will use conscious sedation (such as with a colonoscopy). (Not like topical surgical anesthesia)  Port placement is an outpatient procedure, performed by an interventional radiologist, under fluoroscopy. Biggest hassles about the procedure itself is you'll have to bring a driver and that they will need to place an IV to give you medicine for the placement.

I understand the hesitation and frustration about having a port placed but not everyone can tolerate peripheral chemotherapy and unfortunately not all veins are created equal. Peripheral chemotherapy and be damaging to some people's veins, esp if they are small. If surgery involved any major lymph node removal ports are invaluable for trying to negate lymphedema. Ports do not have to be permanent and can be removed when your oncologist deems it's no longer necessary.

The whole process can be really scary and overwhelming. Try to take it one obstacle at a time, take time for yourself, ask for help where you can. I hope that this maybe addresses some concerns.

cancer,ff68mpt,t3_ertqnt,1579621714.0,"If you have access to an oncology dietician, your question is best directed towards them. Typically your doctor would defer the question to one anyways. I feel like I had seen a handout that discussed why tumeric should be avoided but I don't know where. If you have any questions regarding specialized diets, supplements, & vitamins, they are the ones to ask. Also for dealing with weight changes, nausea, constipation, or diarrhea, dieticians have non medication based tactics for coping with these issues. 

Long story short, from what I recall they counsel against tumeric."
nursing,ff2c8sb,t3_er6tll,1579500423.0,"Honestly, I think if you ask any nurse they have a *CAN'T*. Some can't do suctioning, either the sound or the sight of what comes out gets to them. Some can't stomach wound care, again either the sight of it or the smell or the idea of packing a huge tunneling wound. Some can't do GI stuff. Whether that is c-diff or GI bleed or (in my personal case) ostomies. Sometimes a co-worker and I would swap out specific duties. I'd go suction her trach patient and she'd go change out a colostomy bag that exploded. 

I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone in healthcare that doesn't have ""one thing"" that they cannot stomach. Not every part of nursing works for every nurse. Good news is there are a lot of sub-specialties in nursing. Everything from psych to L&D to OR to ED, etc. Just because one thing gets to you doesn't mean that there isn't a specific path you can explore. If you find a branch you might like, consider some job shadowing."

She flat out refused. When he started to get agitated about it she told him that we will no longer be providing him care and that he needs to find a new clinic to have his procedures done at. She canceled all appointments with us and informed the front desk staff that under no circumstances was this patient allowed to make appointments in our clinic moving forward.

There is rarely anything positive in the news, no heartwarming stories, no human interest angle, sorry we just peddle fear here.

nursing,felg117,t1_fek2f6u,1579221310.0,"You know, this makes sense.

Yeah, of course I have depression.  I hate going to work every day because I feel judged for not continuing to care about patients anymore. I mean,I don't know how they can expect you to deal with death everyday, for 20 years, and not have to go numb out of some kind of self preservation. 

Any then, today I surprised with a ""touchpoint"" meeting where my manager and co-worker then proceeded to talk about how our jobs are going. Somehow this meeting all of a sudden devolved into ""we should be doing xyz, now tell me how you do it?"" I show up to work, I do my job, I do more than my job. You tell me to ask for help, but when I do you either instantly refuse or tell me you'll think about it. You tell me as a salaried nurse I make more than hourly employees. Guess what?  Hourly employees get paid overtime. So when I've been at work for the mandated 8.5 hours 5 days a week I am going home. If you want happy patients and all of the work done every day....hire another fucking nurse. Can't justify hiring because I literally can't make an encounter for every call that I take where some calls to ask when their appointment is? I bet I'd get it done if I got paid overtime. 

You claim to be full of compassion and sympathy, but not for the staff you work with every day? I always fear judgment from those around me, I have 2 people here that I spend any insignificant amount of time with and I've lived here 4 years now. I work, go home, don't leave most times until the next business day. I don't sleep for shit, I don't have friends, I haven't been in a relationship of any kind for 10 years, I don't trust anyone, and am generally numb.

nursing,feip0r7,t3_ep5x3b,1579143674.0,"I see a lot of responses here that I agree with, too many to list.

Last August ushered my 20th year in nursing. Started out inpatient med-surg/oncology. Had a manager that hated me and made every working day a living hell. At the end of this job I spent about 9 months learning Epic, training the nursing staff, and when it was time to go back to my unit..nope. I left to do travel nursing after 13 years.

Travel nursing was great as a way to see the country and be gainful employed. Pretty much broke the bank though. The upside was I had access to some well known hospital systems and really beefed up my resume. Did that about 3 yrs and some change. Was doing oncology infusion; so hospital based outpatient chemo centers. 

Last 4 years I've been settled down. I work in an outpatient oncology center. Pretty much one stop shopping (so to speak)  with medical, surgical, and radiation oncologist in one building. Management was really great in the beginning. Had a nurse manger that went to bat for her nurses. Then she left and they gave the run of the clinic to a brand new management graduate with no spine. A surgeon got pissed one day that her clinic wasn't running well because two of their 4 nurses were off the same day, even with only 1 physician there and maybe 6 patients on their schedule for the entire day. So then just before the holidays all of a sudden only 2 clinical staff (nurses and CNAs) can only be off at the same time.....for the entire clinic. (That's probably 25-30 nurses) Needless to say at least 50% of said clinical staff is looking for new jobs.

Outpatient can be good, but eventually piss poor management and the biggest whiners get noticed. I've asked repeatedly for minor accommodations to improve my quality of life only to be told flat out ""No"" or let me think about it and I'll get back to you (only to never get back to me). I stopped asking. I filed a request for accommodations with HR under the ADA. Ultimately I will leave this job. My patients will suffer, because I leave with a huge amount of knowledge, assessment, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. Beyond that, I can't take any more phone calls from the local PD requesting for our oncologists to sign death certificates for patients found at home or having to sign any more With Sympathy cards for another person I just talked to last week.

TL;DR: Overbooked, understaffed, indifference to skilled and compassionate nurses, and everyone out to make themselves look good is killing nursing. Oh, and ridiculous guidelines, regulations, and reimbursement practices. And generally shitty and inept management."

But technical aspects aside, my manager is new, as in this is her first management job. She doesn't have the back of her nursing staff so she has caved to the demands of one of the surgeons. It's not good. But she says ask her anytime for help, but as a token gesture. She'll only help if it's easy or no bother for her, or if she thinks I'm going to lose it at work. She either flat out refuses what I would consider reasonable requests. 

My overall employer as a whole, while nationally recognized, magnet, etc is a terrible place to work. Our clinic has been understaffed by at least 40% for at least the last 1.5-2 years. This is everything from check-in staff to the nurses in the infusion room. My particular job, doing phone triage now, we need a third nurse as we regularly see call volumes of 50-70 inbound calls a day in addition to obtain drug PAs and filling out disability and FMLA paperwork. For two nurses, it's too much. We've been given the run around about hiring a third nurse since I moved to this role 9 months ago. My coworker ended up having some cardiac issues also around Thanksgiving also and she was out for almost the same amount of time I was.

Long story short I guess, I work in a building that houses about 50 women on any given day. Sometimes it works out, many it does not. My entire career I've been in oncology. I can't handle losing patients anymore. It's been hundreds at this point. 

Overall it's a combination of factors. But the driving force is two faced, limp management. They are unwilling to work with me. I don't typically complain. But I also don't go around being syrupy sweet and fake, I say what I mean, I get angry, I get frustrated. I am also professional. I am told patients (and other staff) appreciate my knowledge and skill but that doesn't seem to count for anything. They will be conciliatory to the complainers and whiners and punish everyone else at their expense.

Since I'm salaried, if you get my 8 hours a day, it doesn't matter when I  come in. And since other nursing staff is afforded or allowed the option, should be fair for everyone.

Things happened that steered me away from the profession up until June of last year.\]

The first therapist I tried to get in to see, was apparently unavailable to take on new patients. So theyset me an appt with a different therapist. She ""seemed"" like she was listening, taking notes, nods in all the right places. We talked about my long standing insomnia. ""Oh we have XYZ person here that does ABC thing, but neither of their services are covered by insurance. But you should see them. Second or third visit (I forget which) she is sitting there mute as a post, her eyes are all droopy, and she is absolutely nodding off every 2-3 minutes. I never went back.

I waited a month before trying to find a new therapist and at this point I didn't even want to try, because I figured they'd all be crap. I found a therapist just by looking on the 'ol Google referral service. Her site is unassuming and not flashy with pictures of sappy, smiling people. What she did (which sold me) was list all of the forms of therapy that she is experienced with and may potentially employ during sessions. None of this flash in the pan, latest buzz word stuff. Evidence based treatment modalities, stuff proven to work. There were some snafu's on getting set up originally since she was told that she was not ""in network"" for my benefits, but to her credit she knew she was and pursued it with the insurance provider.

I think you will need to find someone that fits your style or desired needs from therapy. Do you want to lie on the couch and just talk while they listen, do you want a lot of back and forth, do you want homework, is there a specific technique or type of intervention you desire. Probably more than anything, you should definitely vet your mental health professionals."
nursing,fdu0dqn,t3_emwmy6,1578725276.0,"Like anything, what you get out of it depends on what you put into it. If the reason for pursuing a career in nursing, is your desire to help others, it's a good place to start. There are many branches within nursing, so that bears some consideration. 

If you want to be able to afford your lifestyle, still a valid choice, but I think if you don't like it at least 40-50%, you'll probably soon leave. Travel nursing is also an option. Not a game changer in the old pocketbook imho, but great for beefing up the resume and being able to get around and see places. 

Spending some time thinking about what you want to specialize in after you graduate. Ideally, if going into adult care, you should spend a few years on med-surg to get your feet wet. This is where your grassroots education will happen with regards to managing patients with multiple comorbidities and a laundry list of medications. Hone your instinct. Probably the big exceptions to this would be peds and OB, for obvious reasons.

I wanted OB when I graduated, so did everyone else. Happens that I landed in oncology, been at it 20 years now."
nursing,fdtym4b,t3_emxk8g,1578724394.0,"Even outpatient this is absolutely the norm. We have snacks for our oncology patients. All I keep hearing  (as I order the snacks) is the patients are asking for cookies or candy or whatever. We don't get pseudo healthy snacks from the hospital since as a satellite clinic, we don't have anyone to monitor them. So our snacks come from Staples of all places. No. I will not order cookies; here have a protein bar ffs.

And don't get me started on calling me for the first time after 1400 on a Friday for a refill on your narcs and get huffy with me when I can't guarantee you'll get it filled before we close for the week. You've been out of this med for 3 days and I'm supposed to magically get this to your pharmacy in 2.5 hours from a physician that isn't even in office today. The voicemail greeting says 72 hours for a reason. And yes, I absolutely mean 2 weeks for FMLA forms."
cancer,fdtxkk3,t3_en1naw,1578723861.0,"What I have seen (although not experienced personally) is that with many cancers, the cancers themselves can adapt to the treatment. To get through 11/12 is pretty good. I am assuming that the chemo was before surgery, to shrink tumor size. (Neoadjuvant) If they are no longer seeing shrinkage or response in the tumor from the FOLFOX, then proceeding to surgery may be the best option. Ideally they would be able to remove the bulk of the disease and then post-surgery chemo would be more of a ""mop-up"". 

Truly, to have made 11 out of 12 on FOLFOX is really good. Some may have to discontinue before that related to side effects. That Oxaliplatin can be a real beast. Wait to hear what the oncologist and surgeon have to say. I hope that you have good news in this new year/decade.

nursing,fdsgsqx,t3_emtxjf,1578702444.0,"Gotta echo what everyone else is saying. I work in a women's cancer center for crying out loud but male family members and the occasional male patient would be very inappropriate.

 One patient had two sons with developmental impairments and resulting behavioral issues. This had not happened to me personally but several of our nurses they would try to corner, get alone, follow, or have physical contact with. As you would expect, management turned a blind eye, the doorknob in charge of actual facility is a real tool. As nurses, we never left any of them alone with these people. Some male patients we have actually had to deny to treat them at our location and refused to schedule return visits.

But, that being said, there is even inappropriate contact from male coworkers. I've gotten very particular about my personal space and this had been violated in several male coworkers. While maybe not sexually intentioned, I did not ask for or give consent for some man I've never met in my life to come hug me like I've known him 20 years. The South is a weird place for my Northern standoffishness.

Like everything we do document it all. File a police report now so that there is a record of conduct. None of this is ok, ever. Because if these guys feel they can get away with it, they will gain confidence and become emboldened. If your management is unwilling to deal with this situation directly, leave. 

While the family member may not like how the situation has to be handled, I'm sure they'd like it less to have them in jail for assault."
depression,fdq7o6m,t3_emnl5m,1578658327.0,"I definitely resonate with this comment. The cruel twist of fate is that I also take care of cancer patients. They are trying so hard to survive and I just want to throw in the towel.

My coworkers are all happily married or in some long term relationship, spending time with their happy families, organizing fundraising events for various cancer organizations in their free time, and general ""I'm a well adjusted, caring human"" activities. I couldn't handle working alongside these normal people so I changed roles, now working the phones, so I would interact with fewer people in person.

My job has been trying to be understanding in approving intermittent FMLA for 6 months and at Thanksgiving I lost it and was out for two weeks. I've burned thru several antidepressants in the last few months, some of which worked but I couldn't take the side effects. Also therapy, which I had never done before. I was going to throw in the towel on finding a second therapist when the first one I saw just kept trying to tell me that they have another provider who can help with sleep issues but their services aren't covered by insurance and our last session she kept nodding off. My second therapist I think can be credited with my continued existence. She is trained in numerous techniques and we regularly discuss if the approach we are using is effective. She uses evidence based practices with proven effectiveness, words that I swear healthcare providers live and die by. And she's sharp. I mean she's really paying attention; she'll comment on things and the incongruity between my words and body language.

I think, at the end of the day, you need to look at what is best for you. If you can find a good therapist, from hard core skeptic, it can be a godsend. (Even if you don't believe in that hocus pocus) And maybe you need a change. After 20 years in cancer care, I have no more to give. Now it's time for me to take, for me. I started looking for jobs that can utilize my current skills but remove my concentrated care or investment in individual patients. 

I know it's really hard, but I hope you will be allowed the time to care for yourself. I won't say hang in there because others are depending on you, but if you're in healthcare you are a compassionate person. Save some of that to use on yourself. Take it by force if need be."

On the other hand, depression is making me dull, slow witted, forgetful, and lack the ability to concentrate. It's difficult because I don't want to be there, because I have my own problems.

I'd have to agree that excelsior is mostly the newer first time players and perhaps lesser experienced. I find there's a lot more explanation involved when running low level trials and explaining how to get to certain zones. For fun we ran an arc in Striga. Took a lot of time for folks to just make it there. A lot of people want to team up but don't want to initiate a team. Or you'll get a lot of people waiting until the last minute. In general I don't mind.

Torchbearer I think is where more of your veteraned players are, non RP of course. I find that it's a bit less populated compared to excelsior but can usually get a team going. Again, I think it is a universal problem they no one wants to start a team but still wants to be on one. Generally most players don't need to have everything spelled out, which I've noticed running low level trials. A friend says the Hami raids are all business, quick and dirty. And everyone keeps their pants on. 

I haven't tried any of the others. PvP isn't too my taste and I only RP long enough to get a team going or sometimes to keep a joke running but also not my style. Just my two cents."

Also could try to coordinate a meal train so others could help by preparing and delivering meals. I would suggest smaller portions as appetite might be affected or she might really want something and after eating a little want something entirely different.

Or a manicure/pedicure. Usually once treatment starts it's not recommended to have this due to infection control concerns. Also, if going the nail care route, just plain clear polish or go bare. Want the nails to breathe and also be able to evaluate them.

In general, just support. Send cards or messages, if someone is available to go get lunch during treatment day, do that. Check in with them, see if there is anything you can do to help. Take them out if they feel up to it, safety permitting of course. Go to the movies or church or anywhere else.

Frozen or canned is fine.) And lastly, if your home source of water comes from an untreated well, we recommend using bottled water or boiling for drinking or teeth bushing purposes.

Cityofheroes,fd7i39j,t1_fd4wn1o,1578204877.0,"I think once you get back into the game and get comfortable with it, or find a good group to play with, you'll find it easier to get groups going because no one is running what you want. There's a few paces to the game. Some want to speed run the game, lots of farming, fastest to 50 wins. Some want to play just to goof off and have fun. The worst that happens is you ask what kind of run they are doing, if it's not your thing you don't have to join.

DFB (Death From Below) is your basic newbie trial. I have fun with those because most people are just looking to jump in and get some levels. You pop pretty frequently in those and you can run them 4 times to get the bonuses. Some people will join just to get the badges, being that we've had all the way up to 50 join because we've said we're doing badge runs. DiB (Drowning in Blood) is basically the next trial up. The only confusing part to some is the lvl minimum is 15. Also can run 4 times for the bonuses and for badges. 

PUGs.......dogs that I Speed Boosted one too many times and they ran face first into the wall. Sorry, PUG is a Pick Up Group. Basically you just throw any old team together. Which is still basically what we are talking about. My first to 50 upon my glorious return to Paragon City, I completely didn't realize about the double XP boost that you could get and didn't really think about farming. She PUG'd her way to 50. But as a tricked out Kin, it's relatively easy to do. One other shout out I will give to running or joining PUGs, that is where your best opportunity is to meet all kinds of people. Some you might not like and some you may.

depression,fd1bqcl,t3_ejockg,1578129519.0,"I think this is a valid fear for us all. Some people will live in areas that are served by good mental health inpatient facilities. Unfortunately, my area does not seem to be one of them. Even in this area of the country that has several schools of medicine teaching and nationally recognized/magnet hospital systems. I had even considered voluntary admission at times when my symptoms have been the absolute worst, and after reading the reviews and talking with a few friends that either have experience at those places or directly know someone who has, I would say or do anything to avoid an involuntary committal. 

I have had a couple of really bad patches and my therapist saw right through me. She asked very direct and pointed questions about intent. She is aware of my previous experiences and my fear of having to return to any place like that. We talked about what lead up to the situation, the ferocity of my intent, did I have a plan, did I have means, etc. You kind of have to judge for yourself unfortunately.

Cityofheroes,fd10zf6,t3_ejoij1,1578126446.0,"I've been bouncing between Excelsior and Torchbearer mostly. I never did much farming on Live, but plenty of PUGs. I have farmed up a couple toons to 50, but it just isn't much fun. So lately we just run missions all of the time. 

I pretty much advertise in LFG and Broadcast tabs. You'll want to list the approximate level you're running; is it a radio mish/door/random defeat/or a particular arc. We've seen some people that are specifically wanting to join only for certain missions or AVs and then bounce. That cool, so long as they are upfront about it. Also mention how many spaces you have open. If you are not the team lead, mention who to send tell to (not that it works, I still get tons of messages).

I have a small group that I game with pretty regularly, but when we aren't all playing together, some of us will just run PUGs. And there are a lot of SGs out there. Some advertise, some host costume contests, some people are just fun and you want to hang out more. Whatever works. Typically if our group is playing together, it's a general consensus on what to do and how to do it. We don't really do speed runs, which is good for me as I never did that many TF back in the day.

There are several things I have noticed:

People want to play on teams, but they don't want to start one. I see that a lot. People looking for a DFB or DiB, but won't start one. So, if I'm low level, I'll just get it going.

Everyone waits until the last minute. Now, if someone is running teams at a level that you have a toon and want to join on that, send a message and ask them to hold you a spot. It seems like we get more tells after the team is filled because they didn't say anything at the right time. At some point I just start spamming last call. If the team is stacked enough, and doing something like a DFB, then we will lock the team and run. Sorry but 4 last calls and you send a tell 1/2 thru, sorry about your luck.

If you fill your team, send a message that you're full. If you're going to do more runs (in the case of DFB or DiB) mention that too.

My own personal preferences, if I get tells that all came at the same time, I usually take the first one. But if someone drops or has to leave, I will try to message people from before to see if they are still interested. It's hit or miss.

Also, also wik....I like to make my LFG messages entertaining. At this point, doing the same missions again and again, I'm going to have to keep a running document so I can reuse the good ones. But sometimes we get people to respond for no other reason than they saw my message and got a good chuckle. Some folks message me just to say it's funny. I mean, you would do a double take too if you saw someone advertising for team members by asking for a resume or headshot or saying that you're going to need to be UTD on your vaccinations. Have fun with it.

Lastly. While many players from back in the heyday came back to the game, you will have folks of all skill levels on the game and in your teams. Now if they ask for help, feel free to offer suggestions, direction, etc. Some people have come to the game and don't know anything about, some read the wiki's and still don't fully understand, and some do. We were all new to the game once. Unfortunately, you will also have some people that are on the team that are trying to speed run a mission that we want to play for fun. We've had to kick a few players for going stealth for the glowies and ending the mission before everyone was on map. There's also been some intentional Leroy Jenkins action. Jumping into a mob, grabbing aggro with an AOE and then running the new mob back to a tank that is capped out. You'll have to boot some people, if you asked and they did it again anyways, I consider it fair warning. 

We all want different things from our gameplay, but I'd like to think we all want to have fun. If TF's are your thing, do that, missions or PUGs, do that too. There's plenty of evildoers out there to go around."

cancer,fcwbpj4,t3_ehogz2,1578021701.0,"Ports (port-a-cath) are great for chemo patients and ideal for those who will be on extended therapy. I'm going to assume by the full year of therapy that she is probably getting Herceptin. PICC lines are great as well, but I think for that amount of time might be less ideal and potentially become an infection control concern. 

Ports, you can draw labs, give treatment, fluids, blood products or basically any medication that would require something called a ""central line"". This is because the end of the tubing from the port comes out in the superior vena cava. Because the vein it comes into is so large, everything gets diluted quickly, with less potential to cause damage to the vessel. 

If she is being treated every 3 weeks she will not need to have additional ""flushes"" between treatments, since it will get done on treatment days. Once treatment is done, there is the option to remove the port or keep it. If she elects to keep the port, then the port will need to be flushed every 4-6 weeks. The access part of the port is put under the skin, it is accessed with a special 90 degree needle. In the outpatient setting the needle only stays in place for the duration of the clinic day and removed before going home. If she is hospitalized and they use the port, the needle can stay in continuously for 7 days, then needs to be removed, and a new needle placed. The implanted part stays until she is done with treatment entirely.

They pretty much only place ""power ports"" nowadays so they are CT scan compatible. (CT machines use a mechanical device to give contrast. That machine delivers at a high pressure and power ports are designed not to break due to the pressure.)

The access portion of the port can be placed on the chest or inner arm. I even heard of one patient that hers placed quite low, almost sternal, so that she could wear bikinis. That is fairly uncommon. EMLA cream (lidocaine/prilocaine cream) is a topical numbing agent. Put it on at least 1 hour before she expects to have it used. Longer won't hurt anything. No need to rub it in. Put on a nickel or quarter sized glob over the access part and cover. I saw someone mention Press and Seal, I've even seen a few folks tape a large bottle cap over it. Sometimes low tech wins.

Nursing staff will be responsible for accessing ports and drawing labs, monitoring the site from treatment to treatment, putting in saline and heparin (low dose blood thinner to prevent clots in the line) before removing the needle. When they are cleaning the site to access it, it's literally like watching paint dry. Don't blow on it or fan it to dry faster, as we don't want to accidentally introduce germs/bacteria. (Mad love for all phlebotomists, you all could get blood from a turnip if it had any.)

Downsides - EMS won't use them. By and large they are not trained how and since it is a sterile procedure, you want someone that is trained and has the right environment to do this. ED/floor staff may or may not, just depends on if they are trained to. Sometimes ports can develop a platelet sheath over the end of the tubing that acts as a one way valve. If they are unable to get blood from her port they may have to put in a medicine to dissolve that. It's time consuming but an important safety measure. Also, occasionally the placement of a port can shift. Weight gain or loss and any breast/chest surgery can affect the tissue under the port. Sometimes it can tip or lean to one direction. The nursing staff may just take a little more time to feel for the position before they clean it.

Ports are really the way to go for extended treatments. Best wishes for your mom."
cancer,fcw79gj,t3_eiwklv,1578018764.0,"As others have said, side effects vary a decent bit based on the drugs used as part of your overall treatment plan. Not every drug has a universal use, neither does it have a universal side effect.

Probably the biggest ones patients have concerns over: 

Hair loss/thinning - I recommend soft knit caps to keep your head warm. You can always get/use a wig/hairpiece, many will for going out in public.

Nausea - If there is even a remote chance for nausea you will be prescribed 1-2 nausea meds. Don't be afraid to use them proactively, just be mindful a couple can also cause constipation.

Dehydration - If you will be getting treatment in your vein (as opposed to a PICC line or implanted access) you need to hydrate as well as you can before treatment days. More fluid volume makes your veins plumper and easier to see and get an IV into. Also, hydration is important for clearing chemo from your system. A dietitian friend says anything that is a liquid at room temperature counts as fluid. (Exceptions being alcohol and caffeine containing liquids) So popsicles, ice cream, soup, watermelon, etc. all contribute to overall fluid intake.

Appetite/Weight loss - There is the potential for taste changes or general lack of appetite unrelated to nausea. If your clinic/hospital system has a dietitian available, talk with them. They have the tips and tricks to help you cope with taste or appetite changes. (Quick aside, never intentionally try to lose weight on chemo since almost all medications are weight based dosing)

Fertility - Given your age, if someone hasn't already, talk about whether your treatment will impact future fertility. Ideally you will have had this discussion and someone will have fronted the idea of banking of some kind.

The first day is scary because you don't know what to expect, how long it will take, will you feel anything. Ask questions, bring someone that can ask questions, take notes. The nursing staff will talk about a lot of things, it gets to be overwhelming. 

At treatment, when they start the medications, if anything changes or feels different, tell them. Don't wait to see if it goes away or not want to bother them, tell the first person that walks by, even if it isn't your nurse. 

At home, keep ahead of nausea, get plenty of rest, pace your activities, and don't get sick. Fevers w/ chills or just chills warrant closer investigation, always. Overnight and on the weekend there are on call providers and triage nurses so if something happens or comes up, call them. And get your flu shot.

I have a notepad on my desk and have had to keep a running list of the names or concepts for new toons because someone says something or I see another toon that gives me an idea. I have about 10 alts waiting to be born and a few I've forgotten.
Got in with a small group of nice people and we've got a small sg going; we play mainly on excelsior or torchbearer. Unfortunately none of my old group have come back to the game, at least as far as I know. 
I've been designated as the LFG advertiser so now I'm going to have to keep a spreadsheet or a running document to keep track of the good ones.
Thinking about a branching out to the other servers too, just haven't gotten around to it."
Cityofheroes,fcnbqsk,t3_ehvgzb,1577808241.0,"A buddy and I are playing a pair of illusion controllers. He's playing illusion/rad and I'm running illusion/kin. He can do a lot of debuffs and I've got the buffs. Especially with speed boost and transference, end shouldn't be a problem.
I've also got an illusion/force field that's doing pretty well. Especially at higher levels, throw down your spectral terror constantly and put your pets to work.
I've wanted to try grav again and test out mind control but I agree illusion is a solid choice. If you struggle in the lower levels try jumping into some DFBs as those always seem to be forming.
Best of luck hero"
depression,fcas8n9,t1_fcan0ug,1577575603.0,"I have a buddy in Wales that struggles with this constantly. For him to see a psychiatrist he has to wait weeks or months for an appointment. He's even been to something akin to a neuropsychiatrist who is one of the top people at the NHS. She has been suggesting medications but as she is not local to him, wants his local provider to be the prescribing psychiatrist. My buddy has been waiting months to even get a screening call from, what he termed as a gatekeeper, at their office just to make an appointment. 

My buddy reaches out to us for support and he might do a little self prescribing to get by, but he wants to go about it legit. I believe his family also pays for him to see a private therapist. Not ideal, esp if budget is a concern.

Here in the US we just get told by our insurance companies that it's to expensive so we won't pay for it. Nevermind that your psychiatrist thinks this would be ideal, nope, you get to foot hundreds of dollars out of pocket a month just to want to get out of bed to go to work to afford your medications. 

Everyone talks about wanting to be more inclusive and understanding of mental health sufferers, but they're just blowing smoke up our asses."
Cityofheroes,fc588fm,t3_eg1kp9,1577448219.0,"I have an illusion/force field controller that is pretty button light so far. I honestly built her as a gag toon, picking powers that fit the theming more than anything, but she's surprisingly effective so far. (Not maxed out yet)

I refresh bubbles, run a distortion field, and my Phantasm. I throw out a lot of spectral terrors and my decoy squad in big groups. 

I think I just hit 40 but I think leadership is probably a good pool to pull remaining open powers from since I feel like I have everything I want from my main power sets."
nursing,fc0s4qa,t3_efedar,1577298341.0,"I can commiserate with this statement. I've been working in an outpatient oncology clinic for the last 4 years. Initially this was a great place to work, high press ganey scores, good employee satisfaction. In the last year to year and a half our patient volume has exploded. We now have 5 gyn oncologists with a ridiculous total patient volume. 1 full time medical breast oncologist who will be out on maternity leave in a few months and then she'll cut back to part time, her total patient census is somewhere around 1200 patients all told. We have 2 additional part time medical breast oncologists that only work 2 full time days a week between them. 
They gave management of the nursing staff to a brand new grad, and while she worked in the clinic and knows everyone, ultimately has no experience and no support. We have several pushy and demanding surgeons (imagine that) and she has no backbone to stand up to them in defense of her staff. Our staffing policies were just changed a week before Thanksgiving (after the holiday schedule was already out) saying that there could only be 2 ""clinical"" staff in the entire clinic at any one time, that would comprise more than 30 clinical staff, nurses and CNA. Naturally everyone is pissed since holiday plans have already been made for many. A lot of staff had left already and many more (myself included) are already looking for new jobs. 
Hospitals are a business now, nothing more. We're just bodies to fill a seat. Take care of yourself and find a place you love. I have no particular loyalty to any one company since they're all going to treat you with disregard. Whether it's a big hospital system or a small one try something new, it never hurts to diversify."
