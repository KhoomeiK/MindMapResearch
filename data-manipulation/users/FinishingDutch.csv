Wil je eens wat grappigs horen? Dat hoeft dus niet. 

Ik val in geen van de genoemde groepen. Maar ben wel een handige consument. 

Via Spoordeelwinkel kun je vaak leuke dagretours kopen. Deze zijn dan geldig van een willekeurig station naar een willekeurig station. Een dagretour kost dan vaak zo'n 19 euro voor tweede klas. Maar, hier komt het leuke: je kunt ze vaak ook als eerste klas kopen voor 25 euro.

Als je dan kijkt naar het kostenplaatje: met de OV-chipkaart op saldo reizen van Enschede naar Schiphol kost 25,10 euro voor de enkele reis. Dus voor een retour kost me dat 50,20 euro voor TWEEDE KLAS. 

Oftewel, als ik met een Spoordeelwinkel kaartje reis, eerste klas, kost mij dat de helft van iemand die tweede klas reist op saldo.

Kortom, oordeel niet te snel over wie er wel of niet in de eerste klas zit ;-)

Qua stoptreinen maakt het me niet zoveel uit. Voor zo'n korte afstand is tweede klas acceptabel en langere ritten maak je doorgaans met de intercity. 

Ik ben ook heel benieuwd naar het nieuwe materiaal dat de Koploper uiteindelijk gaat vervangen. Ik gok ook echt niet dat de Koplopers snel verdwenen zijn. Net als defensie blijft ook de NS graag zo lang mogelijk gebruik maken van huidig materieel."
thenetherlands,ffr5xx4,t1_ffqyyvb,1580151168.0,"Yep. En als het aan mij zou liggen, blijven de koplopers nog laaaang rijden. 

Ik doe nog wel eens een tripje Enschede - Schiphol. Dan zit je toch 2 uur 10 minuten in een intercity. Heen én terug. Ik reis dan eigenlijk altijd eerste klas want dat is lekker rustig. En de stoelen zitten heerlijk.

Ik ben ook wel eens blootgesteld aan zo'n modernere VIRM post-renovatie dubbeldekker. De eerste klas doet daar denken aan een operatiekamer zo kil. En de stoelen staan zó rechtop met dunne voering dat ik er na een half uur rugpijn van kreeg. Leuk, zo'n USB-aansluiting bij de stoel, maar als ik er geen half uur gemakkelijk op kan zitten heb je er nog weinig aan.

Ik vrees een beetje dat de NS uiteindelijk de eerste klas helemaal weg doet onder maatschappelijke druk. Ook omdat je nu altijd van die discussies krijgt over mensen met een 2e klas kaartje die in de 1e klas gaan zitten 'want het is druk'. Hint: dit mag dus niet. Sterker nog, je mag niet eens staan in de 1e klasse met 2e klasse kaart. Helaas is het iets waar sommige conducteurs te weinig op handhaven."

aww,ffmqu1v,t1_ffmoh8q,1580057955.0,"Yup. If you wouldn't let your toddler/full grown GSD do it, you shouldn't let your little dog get away with it either.

Training the dog isn't even all about others safety, it's also about the safety of the dog and its comfort as well.

Take my neighbors for example. We live across the street from a dog park. There's traffic on the street. My neighbor will just open his front door and walk out with the dog not on a leash. At which point, the dog will run across the street to the park. The dog has nearly been run over a few times. I know it when it happens, because my neighbor will YELL AT THE DRIVER for nearly running his unleashed dog over. Yeah.

He'll also let the dog run wild in the part of the park where dogs are supposed to be on leash. Which results in the JRT running up to other dogs at will. Some of those owners don't really want the JRT running up on their dog, which is quite understandable. For all we know, that giant other rottweiler isn't having his day and will bite the poor JRT in half. It's gotten 'corrected' a few times by other dogs for that behavior.

All of thos could've been prevented with just a bit of training and thought. The depressing thing is, when we moved here, they had this lovely little Dachshund named Max which DID get training and attention. We loved that dog; so well behaved and friendly. Once the neighbors got kids, all that went out the window. Because.... 'we know how to handle dogs'."
aww,ffmjiso,t1_ffmbcat,1580055555.0,"Honestly, my problem isn't so much with the breed itself, but I have seen too many people who don't know how to handle one.

JRT's are adorable. Very loving dogs, decent with kids, pretty smart, etc. But: it's also a high energy dog. And they need to be kept busy. I've seen too many people who don't do the bare minimum to keep that dog entertained and occupied, which leads to bad behavior (we humans consider it bad, the dog's just doing it's thing).

I've also seen owners not discipline or train the dog appropriately. Which again, can lead to behavior issues.... especially if you don't keep that dog busy.

My neighbors have had JRT's for ages. They don't bother training them, and the dogs get away with behavior that you wouldn't tolerate from a larger dog. I live across the street from a dog park, and you can tell which dogs have decent owners and ones that don't."

Problem is, that reasoning would REALLY put me off if I could vote in your elections. It should be about policy and the candidate's strength, not how long they've been playing the game itself.

madlads,ff9dbcx,t1_ff99xeb,1579710497.0,"You'd think so, but no. The inner ear can definitely play tricks on you.

In aviation, pilots train flying blind and with limited instruments. Relying on your inner ear to tell you what's up and down isn't as accurate as you might think. People have conducted experiments with putting aircraft in odd angles and level flight, in order to test if you can level and keep level an aircraft without instruments in limited visibility.  Answer is: not really. You can actually be tilted quite far before the inner ear tells you you're no longer upright.

That's why there are several backup attitude indicators. And why they teach you to trust what the instruments are telling you to a certain extent."
space,ff8m3i1,t1_ff8bt43,1579685265.0,"That tends to be people's argument as to LEGO's thinking, yeah. And for some sets, it makes some sense to opt for a single-use sticker over keeping a printed part in store. Let's say a theme like Trolls which probably won't sell, sure, add some stickers to use a specific part in a specific way.

But sets like this? I feel those should be prints. Many adult fans of LEGO hate them. And we also have the disposable income to not care about a set being 5 euros more expensive due to printed parts. I realize this is the Space sub and not the LEGO sub, but LEGO fans tend to spend.... quite a bit. We can handle it. 

The Saturn had 10 different new prints, 25 printed parts in total. It had a 6.1 cent per part price ratio. 

The Lunar Lander has a 9.2 cent per part price ratio. Which means, it's more expensive per part already. And yet, it has 14 unique stickers. So, I'd say there's room to include at least some prints or  create parts in a needed color, such as the gold mylar stickers that should've been gold parts.

Sure, none of that really means anything to LEGO, but as a fan, I'm having a hard time warming up to a set that's already more expensive, has certain flaws in its execution and uses stickers where prints or colored bricks would give a lot better result. Stickered models never look as good as you want them to, and this would be a model I'd want to display.

I might just end up buying it anyway, provided I can find some prints or recolors to make it more to my liking. AFOL's are generally a crafty bunch and if LEGO doesn't make it, we'll do it ourselves."
NoStupidQuestions,ff8lfly,t1_ff8it9v,1579684247.0,"TV shows are quite different from what they were 20-25 years ago.

Production values went up, which drove up costs and also garnered more viewers. Take Game of Thrones: you couldn't make that 25 years ago. We didn't have the tech or budgets for it.

This also caused shows to shorten seasons and take longer breaks between seasons to produce them. If you take a show like say, Star Trek The Next Generation, that had 7 seasons. With 26 episodes in the first season, 22 in the second season. Current show Star Trek Discovery had 15 episodes in its first season, 14 in its second season. And: that's a big season these days! I've watched shows that had 8 episode seasons, even 4!

This also fed into shows going with tighter story arcs and less filler episodes. You NEED to tell your story in less time, so there's little time for detours. Back when Star Trek TNG came on, you could shoot what's called a 'bottle episode'. You use existing sets, existing cast, little budget, etc. And: you start and finish the episode without any major incidents that would disrupt the main timeline of the show.

With the current tight seasons, shows just don't do these filler episodes quite as much because they can't afford to. And if you watch a current show like Game of Thrones all the way through, there's just very little point to rewatching it since you know how the story ends, and that everything that seemed interesting at the time it first aired amounted to nothing. 

I fully agree that rewatching most shows after the 2000's is very difficult. I do occasionally rewatch stuff like The Wire, Sopranos, Generation Kill and Battlestar Galactica, but not much else I'm afraid."

The lander is decent, but it has a bunch of stickers and could be better in terms of accuracy. (Just look at the standard LEGO astronauts instead of anything resembling actual NASA astronauts...)

The Saturn V is both an excellent, highly detailed model as well as a fantastically fun build. You have no idea how it's built and halfway through it, you're starting to doubt your sanity. But once it clicks and you figure out where it's going.... it's like magic."

The market for an ISS set is rather limited, so a big, expensive version (let's say something costing 200-300 USD or so) would have a very limited audience.

Geography is a standard part of education in the Netherlands, usually fairly tied in to history classes. You take basic geography in grade school and it's a required class for our equivalent of a high school diploma. Depending on your school, we also usually learn Dutch as well as English, French and German and schools can offer other languages.

One part of geography is, in fact, learning US states on a blind map, similarly to how we learn European countries on a blind map. It's been a while since I've tried all states from memory, but I can definitely point out those three :D

Learning US states does have at least some practical value - you have at least some idea about where TV shows are happening and where characters are from. Also, that thrse states have certain identities that influence their settings and characters."

They know Canada and Mexico, but there aren't any other neighbors. 

In Europe, countries are much smaller. If I drove for two days, I'd pass half a dozen countries. If I drove for a week, I'd be in Russia. We have a lot more neighbors and trade/political partners nearby. So, geography is much more relevant to a European's daily life.

I currently don't really do Technic sets, although I do have an unopened 42052 heavy lift helicopter sitting on my shelf. I want to build it, but I imagine it's going to take me forever since I never build Technic.

The F40 is a great build. It's surprisingly technical - lots of weird little building techniques. The end result is pretty good as well. The Mini, I actually didn't really enjoy as a build. Which is odd, considering I really like the car in real life and really can't fault the end result of the LEGO set.

Here's a personal story regarding board games.

I have some friends who are into Monopoly. Like, way more than regular people should be. The wife of said couple is particularly hardcore and absolutely HATES losing.

They play Monopoly fairly regularly with another couple. She kept losing the game due to bad rolls - the way she rolled the dice coupled with that particular dice's bias, she tended to roll consistently low numbers, which fucks her over in Monopoly.

We gifted her a set of real casino dice and told her to use those instead. This had a marked effect on game outcome: she won more games and the games themselves were more interesting according to her.

This shouldn't be as surprising as it is; bosrd game dice are made very cheaply. I wouldn't trust one for anything remotely random or important.
