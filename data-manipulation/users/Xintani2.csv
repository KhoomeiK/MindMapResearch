Destiny,ffi7p35,t1_f90as7r,1579967253.0,I am late to reading the drama threads that include me but this made me giggle.
NarcissisticAbuse,ffi3qzj,t3_etjpbs,1579964221.0,"Hahaha this is so true. Every relationship I’ve ever been in, both people are always sad. We discuss what went wrong, why it needs to end, etc and end on good terms no matter what. 


The Narc is the only breed of human on the planet that gets a high off of you being in pain that it’s ending and insult you more so that they can brag to themselves and friends about how bad they hurt you. Yikes!"
NarcissisticAbuse,fdpgrrf,t1_fdmh3gh,1578628213.0,"I also recently realized just how many Narcissists I invited into my life. 


I’m happy that you’re crying more. Im sure it’s healthy to be able to let it out. I’ve noticed a number of people mention that they are empaths and when I started recognizing the Narcissists in my life I realized that the reason I got close to them is because I love to help and people with NPD need so much help. I’m focusing more on putting all that energy into helping myself now."
NarcissisticAbuse,fdmam3k,t1_fdko420,1578544020.0,"So... most normal people in the world! It’s crazy how when we get bit by a shark and the shark comes back around we tend to say “Oh, sure. Just try not to scrape me with your teeth this time please!”

Nope. Let’s not waste more of our youth."
NarcissisticAbuse,fdmaatu,t1_fdm9vzq,1578543778.0,"The thing is; I think we need to feel pain to get through trauma. I know how much it sucks. And despite knowing everything I know, I feel the pain. Heavy. We were abused; it hurts! 



The issue is when you start thinking, “Oh. If he apologizes and tells the truth, that will make it better.”


No. That will keep you traumatized your whole life. If you are in this subreddit, that means you’re either processing through pain or you’re offering support for other people going through it because you went through it yourself. The difference between a Narcissist and someone that reaches out for positive support is the people reaching out want to heal. A narcissist wants to smother the pain by hurting others. He/she will never stop hurting others. It’s masochism and insanity to expect a snake to tend to your wounds. 


If we allow ourselves to hurt and recognize that the pain is coming from the abuser; the pain will eventually subside for you and the person you left behind, the one you never speak to, check up on, or associate with, will be right where you left them. Let’s free ourselves of this bullshit and move on to a life that isn’t full of people that devalue us."
SuicideWatch,fdm8cc9,t3_elu4me,1578542311.0,"I don’t know if this is for everyone but I have one thing that really, really helps me. 

I write out a complete suicide note. Or I record it. I say everything I want to say to the world/people who have hurt me/etc. I let everything out. 

Then I read/listen to it back and it feels like it gets rid of a lot of the drive to actually take my life. 


I’ve struggled with heavy and persistent suicidal thoughts since I was about 10. A number of years ago, I went through enough trauma to attempt a number of times which resulted in a permanent scar on the side of my eyebrow and a lot of guilt at not following it through. I’ve grown and come a long way since then, but still, sometimes life gets so difficult and painful that the thoughts creep up again and I understand what you’re saying. You begin feeling like you are at war with your mind, trying to find a reason not to and nothing seems convincing; I get it. 


But the reality is; just because you don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel doesn’t mean there isn’t one. You just can’t see it now. Telling people about suicidal thoughts.. it has never done anything beneficial for me. If anything, it pushes people away. So writing out my suicide note or memo is how I get rid of it. I’m not sure why it’s so therapeutic but it works for me."

SuicideWatch,fddeb23,t1_fdde4n7,1578308288.0,"The issue is that it sounds like her home life is making things worse. Ideally social services should be involved. 


If you absolutely are uncomfortable with alerting the police, Iâ€™d recommend taking her out to events. Bring her along and do things for her to show her that you care. You donâ€™t need to say anything, but something as simple as baking cookies and surprising her with it can stop a person with no hope left in their tracks."

It sounds like this has been escalating for a long time and no one has given her the help she needs. Highschool years can be rough; Iâ€™m sorry."

NarcissisticAbuse,fdd4998,t3_ekk0xe,1578294139.0,"You having that thought and genuinely being concerned about it means that you are most certainly not the narcissist, in my opinion. 


However, if you just got out of a storm with a narcissist, you might adopt their traits for a time. Stay away from them long enough and youâ€™ll go back to normal. It happens to most of us.


A Narc is a narc for life. An empath who deals with a Narc will turn into one for as long as theyâ€™re around them to protect themselves. You learn from them what â€œtricksâ€ dismantle the other person and start doing it. 



We often forget that happy relationships exist. There is something much better, hotter, and happier out there for you. You just have to be willing to step away from this to find it."

Listen, weâ€™re all fucked in the head in some way. There isnâ€™t a grown adult on the planet that isnâ€™t.

Go full detective if you want to. Just promise that when you find out you donâ€™t freak out at him because heâ€™ll go into defense mode and make your life terrible."

Stand tall and proud. You know that this man is empty. You know heâ€™s not a man at all; but a boy. And youâ€™re a woman. Why are you letting yourself get preoccupied with a boy? 


Their power is lost when you stop fighting them. Leave him. For good this time. Donâ€™t say a word to him; you donâ€™t owe or need to say anything at all. Just exit the situation and focus on improving your relationships. If they bring him up, be honest and quick. Donâ€™t ramble about what heâ€™s done. Save the venting for here and a therapist."

I think thatâ€™s the thing. We donâ€™t want them after we seen them for what they are. But it hurts so incredibly badly that they got away with it. And the more you try to shout for justice, the more people will think youâ€™re crazy. 



All I can say is, work on opening your heart back up. Envision yourself falling in love with someone that isnâ€™t mentally sick.

Actively. Every single day should be about taking all that energy you spent thinking about him and using it on yourself. Imagine what an amazing person youâ€™ll grow into if you took that life force you gave him and funneled it back into yourself. 

Stop thinking and worrying about him; it will slow you down. Every single decision you make should be for yourself. And that is important. 

Instead of 

**I want to get a promotion so that he will realize he made a mistake mistreating me.**

Train your brain to think

**I want to get a promotion because I will kick ass in it.** 


This is important. If he smears, let him smear. If people bring it up, roll your eyes and say you donâ€™t want to talk about it. And if you have to fake it for a little while, thatâ€™s okay.

You mean to tell me that you have abandonment issues and the person you care for the most is threatening you with a month of silence? It doesnâ€™t matter if heâ€™s NPD or not; that is absolutely 100% unacceptable and you can do better. 

I know that we are strangers. But the way you are talking reminds me of myself two years ago. This is beyond â€œred flagsâ€. This is abusive. Read the parable of the Farmer and the Viper.

NarcissisticAbuse,fcw66cq,t1_fcmt679,1578018059.0,To add to the creepiness of this entire thing... she is much younger than both of us. Just finished high school last year... so mature conversation is a no go here. She is convinced I am a villain and sheâ€™s proving her dedication to him by harassing me.
NarcissisticAbuse,fcw5u19,t1_fcor4ij,1578017840.0,"Yep. She is telling a ton of people that I am a liar and obsessed with him. I havenâ€™t checked up on him to see what heâ€™s up to for a month. 

Iâ€™m getting legal council currently..."
LivestreamFail,fbh8abb,t1_fbfumq1,1576867599.0,He had a studio apartment and had speakers that would keep me awake and since I was going to work I rolled up a futon in the kitchen. This was years ago and I canâ€™t remember his name but when I find him Iâ€™m going to pay him back for it.
