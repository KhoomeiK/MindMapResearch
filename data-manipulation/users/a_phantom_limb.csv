All we really know is that it didn't lead to the concierge being arrested, and there are several totally valid potential reasons why that didn't happen.

Though, to be fair, time travel never *totally* makes sense. (There's always that pesky causality!) But here's how I see it:

Up until the Hourglass is used, all of the Stevens we see are *literally the same* Steven. And when, at the end, the Hourglass is ultimately destroyed *before* it can be used, all of the branched Stevens cease to exist because their timelines were never created in the first place. The timelines all collapse back down to just the single one we know. Therefore, we really are still following the same Steven as at the start of the series; he simply didn't experience most of the events of that one episode."
