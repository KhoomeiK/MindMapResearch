You came to OP's post asking a legitimate question and then made some passive aggressive comment making fun of him for not knowing something because you're an immature piece of shit that thinks he's better than everyone else. Just looking at your post history, it's easy to tell you're just a pathetic, sad little manchild with nothing in life to make him happy and the only way you can make yourself feel better is by hating on people on Reddit in order to boost your fragile, inflated ego.

If you're genuinely a grown, adult human being, I feel bad for anyone who has to be anywhere near someone so arrogant, petty, and immature."
