PublicFreakout,fgidbha,t3_eyn5ia,1580817678.0,"Why anyone feels that Iowa is a good sampling of the American people is far beyond my fucking realm of thinking. What a fucking joke our political system is. Our past 2 Republican presidents lost the popular vote, so the majority of the American people did not want them to be president. Yet here we are."

PublicFreakout,fg37huy,t3_ewja1v,1580473337.0,"I once got into it in a parking lot with a AAA tow truck driver in the same situation. I'm driving with the wife out of a parking lot after work, following the traffic arrows. AAA driver pulls in and starts down the same lot aisle I'm coming down driving right toward me in the wrong direction. We both stop and dude proceeds to start blaring his horn berating me because I wouldn't ""get the fuck out of his way"". Some words where exchanged and I eventually backed up and drove around the lot to escape the maniac. I sent AAA the truck's plate and ID numbers and explained what happened and was told that they would look into it. Never heard anything back, dude's probably out there right now being a dick to someone else."
