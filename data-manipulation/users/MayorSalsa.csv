There are still a lot of people who aren’t fully aware of what MLMs are and they are slowly being banned more and more, so you hope that if the organizer has some integrity they will think about implementing some rules if they are made aware. 

If the organizer is purposely advertising as a craft show, you would think they care about the stuff actually being handmade. Sadly even at curated-ish shows I have seen mlms get in somehow passing off their stuff as artisanal. Whatever that company is that does the monogrammed bags comes to mind."

Uncle had to go to police office multiple times and basically beg the officers there to even write him up an incident report, let alone do more to help him out.

AskReddit,ff3xu6k,t3_eril70,1579551215.0,"There is actually a division amongst paleontologists, where a scientist could be considered a “lumper” or a “splitter”. See, it is actually quite hard for researchers to decide when to classify a fossil as the same species as another fossil, not only based on time/ gradual evolution but also based on age of the individual and how much dinosaurs grow in their life span. There are probably many instances where a juvenile dinosaur has been classified as a new species because it looks so different than the adult version but paleontologists just can’t tell. A “lumper” is a person who generally advocates that similar appearing fossils should be classified together. A “splitter” is one who tends to believe that small differences indicates a new species. There are many “species” of dinosaurs that are actually disputed because researchers cannot agree whether it is actually a species or not. 

Our knowledge of dinosaurs is very incomplete and based on the fossils we have happened to have found. We have “snapshot” details about a species in a moment of time but not complete knowledge about the gradual evolution of a species across the ages. 

As for the t-rex ... similar but smaller species of dinosaur existed long before the t-rex, most famously allosaurus is one such that belongs in the same family branch. So the animal that came right before the t-rex but was ever so slightly different, was probably just a slightly smaller t-rex. Nothing came after t-rex btw. They died out in the k-t extinction event."

If I understand your story correctly, it sounds like a giant whole in Paypal’s logic ... it sounds like USPS tried to deliver it to the home address, couldn’t, and so marked it delivered to the USPS centre instead? Paypal should be aware of that and shouldn’t be refunding people if that is the case.

Knew damn well you didn’t want what he was buying, but probably didn’t know what to get as an alternative / put little or no effort into researching alternatives, so he figured he could whine his way into getting you to accept the ring. He maybe planned all along to flip the argument and make you sound ungrateful for not accepting his lazy gift. It’s easy to get a diamond since there’s no shortage of sales people eagerly waiting to push those things on clueless men. He let some sales person persuade him into a diamond, plain and simple. 

Also you have my full sympathy since I’ve told my bf the same thing. I think he’s on board with the no-diamond idea if only because diamonds are expensive anyway. But he’s clueless at shopping around and I suspect I’ll eventually have to tell him what to get and where to get it."

AmItheAsshole,fdttmhx,t1_fdsajrz,1578722005.0,"Agreed NAH, strictly in terms of OP’s question. Although if their account is true, the friend does sound like a brat, but that’s not what’s on the table here. 

As said above, in the case of daily child-care it is the expectation that the carer look after the kid even if they’re sick (so long as they are not grievously ill) (except for the pink eye case, thats super contagious and the mom absolutely lied about it not being contagious and thats really bad). If a kid has a cough, the child care centre / pre-school / kindergarten does not turn them away, so I get the mom’s flustered reaction that the child carer they rely upon is suddenly leaving her to scramble for another solution (which she might not have). However it’s also OP’s household and she has the right to control it, and I guess half the problem is that it seems the mom is not doing her fair share of ensuring her kid is healthy / taking responsibility (ie pink eye, and the snack thing). 

Messy situation, I honestly think it would be cleaner to just not watch the kid anymore instead of trying to enforce a “don’t bring them over if they’re sick” rule."

Even if he bought the stuff on Christmas Eve he should have stayed up late to wrap it. I would have been super insulted receiving that gift, even before seeing what he bought the aunt. 

However, I do think that our gift-giving culture is a bit overboard.

You think they would be sensitive to the fact that working up the courage to reach out to a therapist is a huge deal for some folks and if you don’t even call them back, that could shut them down and be the end of the line.

Maybe she would also just enjoy staying in and having some drinks at home (with you)? Maybe it would be better to just enjoy some good company, have the chance to talk about why she’s feeling like this, rather than trying to force a “hype” by going out. 

Well, either way I hope you two have a good evening and sorry your preferred plans were interrupted."

AmItheAsshole,fcm18r3,t1_fcl58p4,1577761593.0,"“Restaurants are just out to get paid” - and this means they are not assholes? That specifically makes them an asshole in my opinion. Even if the business were struggling and the owner really needed money, that 30$ wasn’t making any difference (making a random guess at how much it cost, since they said they paid extra). They, as a person, chose to participate in the purposeful hurting of someone else in exchange for what was probably a relatively small amount of money.  And that’s a dick move. 

In fact, the whole thing seems kinda sketchy. OP said the owner came out in person and pushed the pizza on them instead of sending the usual driver? Maybe just coincidence but it kinda sounds like the owner was in on this personally and not just on behalf of his business.

Sorry bad formatting."
offmychest,fclip70,t3_ehsij5,1577748709.0,"I know saying that it gets better sounds stupid, or fake, but it’s true. I felt like you once and astoundingly, I am better now. I didn’t believe “it gets better” and only believed people who said that depression is a life sentence. I guess thank god I was wrong. Even if you think about suicide, if you still feel like you won’t go through, you have fight left in you. Try to keep going. Life will change. That’s the nature of it."
AmItheAsshole,fclg0x8,t3_ehng52,1577746932.0,"Can I just point out how you opened stating that “she’s beautiful, but -“ and then completely dunking on every other aspect? I mean is beautiful really the only good thing to be said about your daughter? Sounds like you don’t want her back home because you don’t like her tbh. I mean you can look at it through the lens of tough love, or its for her own sake or whatever but theres nothing wrong with admitting you just don’t want her back. 

Anyways, I’d say yeah don’t let her back home on the grounds of the puppy alone. I absolutely despise irresponsible pet owners / people who think they are entitled to own a pet who can’t look after it. She’s out of the house for 3 months and already had a dog? That bothers me. If she wants to come home she has to surrender the dog. In the least it will stop her from having her cake and eating it too. 

NTA I guess."
AmItheAsshole,fcji84a,t1_fcimly8,1577688582.0,"Yeah, the fiance basically asked you to help manipulate her into doing what he wanted in disregard to the truth.

offmychest,fcjbur0,t3_ehexu4,1577682455.0,"The false hope sucks, I know, but at least she came clean about her change of mind quickly instead of stringing you along for days or weeks because she was too guilty to admit it. That happened to me and the guy waited until the last possible moment to tell me. As in I had put my shoes on to go out the door and then he finally messaged me. I wish he had just told me in 1 hour and 34 minutes. 

But actually. Switching to the theme park instead of a coffee date is probably the reason she cancelled. A coffee date is easy. Short. Cheap. Low-commitment. Even if you don’t like a person in that way, it’s easy to agree to a coffee date and give them a chance. 

A day at a theme park is like the opposite of that. Long. Tiring. Expensive. Potential to be really awkward if it doesn’t go well. Maybe she realized this after agreeing to it and thats why she backed out. In the future I suggest sticking to the coffee date. If you don’t like coffee just get another drink? So long as its an easy date in a cafe, that’s a good choice for a first date."
AmItheAsshole,fcjai8t,t3_ehep9q,1577681378.0,"NTA. They are teenagers, so I’d say that’s old enough that you don’t have to give them gifts anymore. 

But seriously, I am confused. Are you saying that all these years, your nieces have been opening your gifts - while in your presence - and they don’t even say thanks? If that happened even once it would have pissed me off to the point of speaking up about it, let alone having that go on for years. For the first part of your story I assumed you were mailing these gifts or something so I wasn’t too surprised the nieces didn’t call you to thank you. But while you are standing right there? I’m baffled - who would act that way?"
offmychest,fcj6di5,t3_ehdvkq,1577678384.0,"Understandably, depression makes you negative. I suffered from it for years and I was generally salty af. But never malicious or straight-up mean. I could be a bummer, but not on purpose. Being abusive or manipulative goes far outside the excuse of depression. That is calculated harm to another person and that makes you an asshole. OP is right."
