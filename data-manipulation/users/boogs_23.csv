I really only use them for the negative ones.  If there are a bunch complaining of game breaking technical problems, then I'll take a deeper dive into what's up.  Also if a lot of them complain about things I personally don't enjoy in games, I will steer clear.  Like I know I don't like really hard games, so if other gamers are saying it's too hard, then it is definetly too hard for me."

When going back just 2000-3000 years, I find myself losing perspective on time.  A time period of say 300 years seems like nothing, but if you think of the incredible changes in society between now and the 1700s, it's mind boggling.  It comes up, for me, mostly when looking at the Roman occupation of Britain.  It lasted like 400 years, but always seems like they just came, built some villas and shit and then bounced shortly after."
