WeightLossAdvice,fgpf7b1,t3_ezqysu,1581003595.0,"I tried 1 month of absolutely no sugar diet. This including the one in sauce and no fruit either.only carb i got was from rice alone as bread even plain one might have some sugar. This mean no eating outsode at all and everything gonna be home-cooked.

Im always a sweet tooth and feel the urge to eat any thing sweet after every meal to ""top it off"" so to speak. So i counter this with drinking a lot of water to make me feel fresh after every meal.

Result? Everything magically taste better! Im talking plain egh white, plain cooked meat without salt or anytjing taste amazing! Even vegetables taste good. and i dont crave sweet aftwr every meal anymore. And get this since everytjing taste better i start to eat less sugar! For example i find some snack suddenly too sweet and i start to put less sugar in my drinks. 

There is a spike in dopamine when i eat dessert or snack but i just taper it off with water and stop eating.

Wish you good luck on ur journey my friend"
