The caretaker may tell him using ASL to stop doing that at them when/if he does it and now that he sees a guest doing it he’s telling them not to do that just like his caretaker told him not to.

Literal: “Stop beating (your) chest (This could be a form of miming, or “acting it out” in a verb tense describing the action ((which would be perfectly appropriate)) or it could be the actual noun or sign for gorilla, although I would close my hands to fists) *head shake reaffirming, no, don’t do that* And then again, “Stop beating (your) chest, stop it”"
