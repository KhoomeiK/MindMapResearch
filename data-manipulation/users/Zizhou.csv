Stellaris,ff5cuuz,t3_erksi3,1579587638.0,"Totally unrelated, but in the old Starfleet Command computer game, one of my favorite tactics was to kit up a troop transport ship as my flagship. Boarding actions were surprisingly powerful, and the AI(and occasionally people) just wouldn't know how to deal with a constant stream of dudes beaming over. Any sort of boarding tactics in ship-to-ship combat games have long since held a soft spot in my heart.

Anyways, nostalgia trip out of the way, I would be in favor of an implementation closer to 2, for a couple reasons: 

First, it's less micromanagement. The DPT act mostly as normal weapons(maybe have them on a regenerating ammo system like strike craft), so there's no need to fiddle with setting behaviors or actions or even having to watch a battle unfold. I kind of appreciate the more hands off approach to combat that Stellaris has.

Second, having some form of troop modules integrated directly into normal ship design brings us one step closer to finally doing away with Troop Transports as a dedicated ship class. IMO, as they currently exist, they're in a kind of awkward state(as are a lot of ground combat mechanics, but that's another issue entirely) right now, being either perfectly fine, or instantly vaporized. There is no such thing as a damaged Troop Transport. However, if any ship can also act in some way as a troop carrier, survivability *and* customization potential go up.

Another point I'd make: regardless of delivery method, rather than a binary state of boarding or destroyed, what if boarding applied a malus to the afflicted ship? For example, for every successful ""hit"" with a DPT, the boarded ship becomes X% less effective in combat(X% slower, X% less damage, etc) as calculated by some formula.

example: 
`(boarding [army damage|morale damage])*(1+tech modifiers)*(cumulative hits)-(defending crew[damage|morale damage])*([health|morale] modifier)*(1+tech modifiers)`

`/`

`(hull type base value)*(1+tech modifiers)`

wherein, the drop pod ""armies"" pick the higher of the two attack values based on the firing ship's crew makeup as outlined in OP's post, and the defending crew would use the corresponding defensive value. Hull type would reflect how difficult it would be for a boarding party to inflict meaningful damage based on the size of the ship.

So picking totally arbitrary numbers, let's assume an attacking force of 2.5 damage, 3.0 moral damage, and no modifiers, a defending force with 2.0 damage, 1.5 morale damage, 400 health, 200 morale, and no modifiers. Using assault armies as a baseline for health and morale(200 each), the defending crew would get either a 2.0 or 1.0 modifier to their damage/morale damage, depending on what the attacking crew is using. For hull base value, lets pick 100, with a modifier of +0.25(from a technology like the ones that give additional HP to a given hull type). Plugging it all in, we get

`3.0*1.0*X-1.5*1.0*1.0`

`/`

`100*1.25`

and using Wolfram Alpha, we can get a table of values for boarding parties [1 through 20](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283x-1.5%29%2F125+for+values+of+x+from+1+to+20), with each output showing what percentage of effectiveness the ship would lose. I would also argue for at 100% effectiveness lost, the ship being captured, with civic unique technologies or modifiers allowing capture at lower values. Again, all values are arbitrary, but hopefully this outlined my thought process well enough."

boardgames,fefekos,t3_eoncij,1579054658.0,"Are you looking to publish it? If not, do what you like. Homebrewed components for personal use with copyrightable material I think are technically still in violation of the law, but nobody is going to enforce or even notice that unless you're making copies for all your family and friends.

If you are looking to publish, the easiest thing to do would be to just retheme and rewrite the whole thing and not worry about licensing. Copyright applies to art and text, but not general rules or mechanisms(though the rulebooks *would* be copyrightable text). Those can sometimes be covered by patents(see: Magic The Gathering) but outside of *very* novel mechanisms, are usually not.

As with anything legal matter, consult a lawyer before proceeding. Additionally, though it may be legal(again, consult with a lawyer), wholesale replication of the game without permission under a new theme is very sketchy and definitely an area of ethical concern.

Unrelated, but there is/was a Hawken card game? Is it good (or at least playable)? I rather enjoyed that video game and was a little bummed when I found out they shut it down."
