funny,fgtxvwc,t3_f0eles,1581110898.0,I love this man.
Pathfinder_Kingmaker,fgtabxo,t1_fgsxj2p,1581101582.0,I always thought there should be a good variant for followers of Desna.  Could be a swarm of butterflies.  Them being her holy animal and all.  Just a random thought.
Pathfinder_Kingmaker,fgsv5ug,t1_fgsoaco,1581093314.0,"Swarm-that-Walks is cool.  I've always wanted to play a Worm-that-Walks.  I can't play Evil though.  So that's loss for me.

Dragon is cool.   Not sure I want to be a dragon though."
Pathfinder_Kingmaker,fgssvnv,t1_fgsoacr,1581091954.0,"Ok!  NOW we're talking!

Dragon is neat.  Still not sure I'd play it.  Swarm that walks is cool.  I can't play Evil though, so that's a loss.  *shrug*"
Pathfinder_Kingmaker,fgso874,t1_fgsnhb1,1581089060.0,"Honestly that's what I'm leaning towards right now.  But will it be as ""cool"" as the other Mythic Paths?"
Pathfinder_Kingmaker,fgslgyo,t3_f070zw,1581087267.0,"So WotR is going to be really cool and I will really enjoy it.  Not 100% but highly likely.

At this point though my biggest ""complaint"" is that none of the Mythic Paths ""call"" to me.  I mean they're interesting, but I really don't want to play any of them right now.  Hopefully that will change as I learn more about them..."
wow,fgrhm3j,t3_ezs8rn,1581047023.0,But Mom!!!  It's not the same!!!
ImaginaryWizards,fgpjaao,t3_eztane,1581005918.0,Middle guy is the responsible one while his friends are goofing off.
AskReddit,fgp6ahc,t1_fgoc6tq,1580997930.0,"There have been a very few cases where people have lived.  There was a ""recent"" case where a women was just starting so show symptoms.  They basically gave her every anti-viral drug they could, and she survived.  They've been able to save people with anti-virals since then, but it's still a very low survival rate.

Sadly I don't have the source anymore."
Pathfinder_Kingmaker,fgmmmus,t1_fgm2jj8,1580927688.0,I too would love a Summoner.  Sadly I don't see that ever happening.  I can dream though...

AskReddit,ffx1akj,t3_evkh4n,1580315607.0,"Delivered pizza for 11 years.  For better or worse never saw anything too strange.  Did have a couple people open the door only a crack, and stick they're hand out.  They handed me the money, took the pizza, and turned it completely vertical to get it through the crack.  Never saw more of them then their hand and forearm.  Could only assume they were naked or something."
AskReddit,ffx0w7f,t1_ffwf7vw,1580315360.0,"Neat.  If it was a ball python, they're mostly harmless.  The females get bigish, but unless you're a small rodent, they really don't care."
OdysseyoftheDragon,ffroly0,t3_eus7rk,1580162390.0,">!I think she's a really good NPC.  She can't participant in the battles, but can provide some support.  She explicitly states she's the to chronicle their adventures.  But more importantly she's also there to guide them.  I mean she IS one of the Five.  She has a vested interest in the parties success.  At the same time as long as the Peace is in effect, she can't directly do anything.  She's also a bard, so she knows the legends and can fill in the story as needed.  And she can act at the DMs voice.  She's an in game way for the DM to drop hints and suggestions.  She's basically a walking help file.!<"
AskReddit,ffpez9g,t3_eu725g,1580093386.0,Surreal. I was safe and going on with my life as normal.  Meanwhile in New York the world was ending.  I remember stopping and looking around feeling so conflicted.  Very strange feeling.
AskReddit,ffmomks,t3_eu6iol,1580057321.0,“Honeysuckle white” for turkey cooking instructions at Thanksgiving.  However the site was kind enough to offer a link to a recipe.  And even put a basic recipe on the page.  Quite nice of them.

Transmogrification,ffc0bl4,t3_esrsmt,1579788254.0,Good Transmog!  I'd say there's a distinct lack of tentacles for a Priestess of N'zoth though.  :)

enderal,ff79kai,t3_ervgfq,1579643914.0,"Not sure on the gameplay overhaul.  I know that Elementalism really shines early and mid game.  It's still good late game, but Psionic pulls ahead late game."

gifs,feh80dq,t3_ep2frh,1579111049.0,Apparently they may decent pets.  Except they have to go to the bathroom in water...
