AmItheAsshole,ff7kwoc,t1_ff7f47l,1579651986.0,"I think you are right about this.  Alcoholism is an incredibly selfish disease.  The alcoholic holds all the cards - are they gonna drink today?  Are they going to stay sober this time?  Who knows - definitely not the partner who is living with this shit day in, day out, mopping up the puke, dealing with the tantrums, trying to steer the ship while the alcoholic sabotages every damn thing every damn time until they finally decide to get sober and then ""whut?  I'm sober now, how can you not trust me?"".  I'd be willing to bet the OP has tried to get sober before and then 'just had one beer' because what's the harm in just one?  It's all under control now.  OP's wife sees the bourbon syrup and hears ""what's the harm? I'm sober now, it's fine""."

In spoken English we might simply separate the prepositions with a linker, ""we moved on, but we were on good terms"" or even more realistically ""we moved on, but, on good terms, yknow?"".  Written English needs to be a little more formal and organised so we might simply switch the clause order, ""we were on good terms when we moved on"", or we might choose a different word or phrase as other on the thread have suggested, ""I moved on with no hard feelings""for example."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdhjqrm,t3_elb1xg,1578424116.0,"5 years ago I took my young daughter to the shelter to adopt a friend.  She looked past all the cute, fluffy, adorable floofs and pointed to the ring-wormy, balding gremlin with one milky eye who was screaming dramatically at the back.  She said we'd better take that one, because the others would all find homes easily but people don't like black cats and they definitely wouldn't choose Baldy McScreamface, so we'd better love him.  Sounds like a cute story, right?  What a great kid.  But wait.  It's not a cute story.  That cat is a fricken menace.  He grew, oh wow he grew.  He's the size of a dog now.  To accentuate the milky eye he's acquired several scars including one across his good eye.  His ears are moth eaten and his coat is still patchy.  He always smells kinda funky.  He terrorises the neighbourhood - I've seen him fight with dogs and seagulls.  He once came strutting home with another cat's claw threaded into his cheek like a facial piercing.  He has thankfully stopped taking flying leaps at small children.  The neighbours hate us.  He can open windows, he steals food.  The council man visits when the complaints pile up, and politely agrees that there's no actual law about having a cat moo aggressively through people's windows.  My kids are scared of him.  We can't get another pet because he would kill it.  We're stuck with him.    His only friend is next door's rabbit who for some reason he loves.  The rabbit lives in a big open enclosure and they are often found together, just chilling in the sunshine.  I love him.  I do.  But gosh."

If your wife has been living and communicating in English for years then she will be extremely fluent.  She is able to make herself understood in almost all situations without huge effort or concentration on her part.  Fluency is not the same as accuracy, and these fossilized errors are very hard to dig out and correct.   Imagine if someone told you that you had to stop using the words a, the and an.  You would find it so difficult because you never knowingly make a conscious decision to use those words, you just think an idea and the words come pouring out.  It's the same for your wife.

It helps to have a couple of topics prepped beforehand.  Nothing too controversial - local news stories, local or international sports, trips and travel, job,  weather, recent tv or movies - all good topics.   

(religion, politics, philosophy or anything controversial is a bad idea)   

 Practice bringing up a couple of topics beforehand (""Did you hear they've opened a cinema in the local mall?"" / ""I can't believe this weather we've been having!"")   

And (pretend to) be interested in what the other person says.  You need lots of confirmation language to make the other person think you're engaged in the conversation eg really? / oh wow! / did they? / haha! / you're kidding! etc.  

You also need questions to keep the conversation going (""did you hear about...""/ ""Have you been..."")
