loseit,fenfirw,t1_fenceka,1579283586.0,"The two magic words, "" mind set"". It's a struggle for me right now to get back on track. I was doing great, then bam for no particular reason I threw it all away. I'm so disappointed with myself and eat to console myself! Imagine the insanity in that. I'm so happy for your achievements. Keep focused and keep your eye on the great prize of good health and happiness."
Shoestring,fegd96m,t3_eoot4c,1579088537.0,"Be prepared for cold weather and wet shoes. You may also find that homes are colder than what you are used to. They are built from cement blocks and many older homes have poor insulation. So bring warm pyjamas and sweater. If you are tight on money, I suggest you eat a big breakfast at your accommodation and lunch from a supermarket or fruit stall. Dinner can be take away. As suggested by others, get a bus to other areas of Ireland and enjoy the journey. Don't be shy to talk to people. We are generally a very friendly crowd."

loseit,fegbton,t3_eoszga,1579086750.0,"I'm shocked at the "" friend"" for telling you this potentially soul damaging information. She could have handled this ( if it even happened) in a better way and not involve you. She should have reported it to management right away instead of you. If you enjoyed the class, go right back and continue where you left off. Don't let someone's opinion ruine your life. Don't forget you are hiring them not the other way around. Best of luck and good health."

UnsentLetters,fdbd1mq,t3_ekdl9l,1578256198.0,This is such a horrific and inspiring story all in one. I hope that one day you will get the courage to speak to middle and highschools students about your life. So many kids are in desperate need of direction and protection. Wishing you all the best.
1200isplenty,fd9qjaw,t3_ek7a7s,1578236722.0,Dragon fruit is highly nutritious and can be combined with sweeter fruits without overpowering the flavor. I agree it's bland on its own.

loseit,fd5an37,t1_fczh4w9,1578175770.0,For some that's a possibility but for others it's a recipe for disaster. It has been my downfall several times. Sugar addiction is the same as other addictions except much harder to manage as it's in virtually everything we eat. Avoiding that piece of cake is the safest route. I think having the mindset of making every calorie count and only eat what benefits your body is so important during the weight loss battle. Best of luck to everyone on this journey.

IWantOut,fczgjk0,t1_fcyx6kp,1578100764.0,"Google your local Irish consulate and go to their website. At the bottom of the page is "" Contacts"" This gives you an option to email them questions. They usually respond within 24 hours and are very helpful. If you need your grandparents birth, marriage and death certificate go to Hse.ie. You will also need the long form birth ( showing parents names) and marriage certificate of your mother. You will need to get for yourself a long form birth and marriage certificate ( if applicable) These must be from the State vital statistics office and NOT your town of birth. Passport photos are different size from the US requirement and must be stamped, signed and application number applied by a Notary. There is a section on the application to be completed by the Notary. Best of luck."
