OkCupid,feoajd2,t1_fen64ib,1579297331.0,"An over reliance on texts or e-mails can cause issues because you cant really pick up on jokes or teasing and some things can come off as a turn off that may have been funny or comical in person.  Do enough texting or e-mailing to get a meeting set up, meet up face to face and then show your personality, humor or witt, for better or worse."
OkCupid,feo871n,t3_epwrzg,1579296393.0,"First off you have every right not to sleep with anyone until you are ready.  I think most adults understand this and if they don't they probably are not an adult no matter what their age.

Secondly though, I wouldn't put too much thought into when I am going to have sex with someone who I haven't even met yet.  Maybe you cant imagine having sex with someone in the first month but then you meet someone, everything clicks, and you go for it in week 2.  So what?  Dont set an artificial limit, IMO, just enjoy yourself on your dates and move forward accordingly on a timetable you feel and not one you have preconceived before you even went on your first date.

3rd, if the person you are dating kind of wants to move to sex quicker than you but you are still pretty interested in them, keep up a good line of communication.  Call them, set up dates with them, try and make the dates more public than private to reduce the pressure on both of you to move on to sex.  Keep in mind that the other person is probably feeling at least some level of rejection if they are ready for sex and you are not, so keep letting them know you are interested in them, just maybe not quite ready for sex just yet."

I mean in ways it may be, but in other ways its probably not.  Getting to draft players and pay the ones you want to keep has got to be better than that shady recruiting 18yr olds bullshit.  You get more quality time off as a professional coach and there are fewer rules and regulations about your behavior and that of your players.  If someone wants to give your player a little extra cash its a good thing not one to fret over."
