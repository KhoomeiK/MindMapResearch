After that one to one CBT was an eight month wait. 

I ended up paying for therapy at £65 an hour, I was only able to afford five sessions and the guy did an emergency one which he didn't charge me for one evening. 

For me it was an absolute game changer, fuck... I would definitely spend the money again. If you are thinking about doing it and can afford even one or two sessions at like £35 do it. 

Fuck it, if you can't afford a single session I will pay for a session for you."
