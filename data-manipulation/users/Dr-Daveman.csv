AbsoluteUnits,fefffjw,t1_fef0eu6,1579055190.0,"It takes weeks for symptoms to occur, and the vaccination series which cost over $1,000 is the only way to prevent rabies once exposed.  If you become symptomatic, you will almost certainly die. Up until about 5 to 10 years ago it had a 100% fatality rate. There have been maybe 5 to 10 people that have successfully survived and it took an entire kitchen sink full of drugs to do it.  This is why they test the animals if they can. (Also they can just quarantine the pet for 14 days to observe for active rabies infections symptoms indicating contagiousness)."

educationalgifs,fdgerpo,t1_fdgdn3u,1578393390.0,"Shoot for 100 to 150 mics.  I've done it at EDM shows and it's great, though different.  Like other posters, probably smart to try outside of a rave first so that you can change your stimulus in case things are a bit intense.  Good luck to you! Psychedelics have changed my life for the better.  10/10 I recommend for those who are considering them"
