I’ve talked to extremely stressed and overworked ER doctors before who couldn’t help patients that needed it because they have so many patients coming in asking for pregnancy tests, flu tests, and medication refills. They said they spend so much time educating low income where they can go for free and low cost services and telling insured patients they can’t just go to the ER for medication because they’re too impatient to get in with their PC physician"

AskEconomics,ffbwghp,t3_eslkd6,1579785034.0,"I work in labor economics so I’ll take a very quick stab at your second question. The feds have been researching what’s going on with the unemployment rate. You’re correct that in such a tight labor market, with such a low unemployment rate, that wages should “theoretically” be increasing. Some economists hypothesize that one reason this may not be happening is because so many people are involved in the gig economy, and those people aren’t measured in unemployment rates. As the economy changes with technology it is becoming increasingly difficult to adequately measure the state of the labor market through our current statistical programs. That’s something being analyzed by the feds as they try to find out what is happening and what they can do to make our data more aligned with the labor market."
todayilearned,ff5uqb8,t3_ersaty,1579610924.0,"Just want to point out that many things can cause feelings of boredom. I have bipolar disorder and adhd. I wasn’t diagnosed with adhd until I was 25 after it had pretty much damaged and ruined the large majority of my life. Six months on stimulant medication and I finally had my life back under control. Many of the symptoms of depression and anxiety cleared up after treating adhd. The rest were attributed to bipolar disorder and those were finally cleared up by appropriate mood stabilizers. For me, depression felt more like apathy. I would come home from work and sit in a chair and stare at the wall for hours at a time. I couldn’t be bothered to do anything. Staring at the wall was low energy and when life feels like the equivalent of watching paint dry, staring at the wall brings just as much satisfaction as anything else I could do. I wanted to do my hobbies or anything productive but I didn’t have any drive in me to do it. Adhd boredom feels more like traditional boredom to me. However, boredom for those with adhd can feel incredibly painful. Imagine going through life feeling chronically bored unless it’s something that flips a switch in your brain. An overly simplified explanation about adhd is that it is a disorder of “intention” where executive function is not working properly due to delayed development and low dopamine levels. Dopamine is the motivation/reward neurotransmitter. We get dopamine from getting a good test grade, having sex, eating chocolate, playing video games, etc. In adhd, motivation is like a light switch. It’s on or off and it depends on dopamine. If something really interests us we can “hyperfocus” on it for hours. If it’s something like doing laundry, it’s so incredibly boring that (for many) it can only be corrected with stimulant medication. Adderall for example causes the brain to produce more dopamine but it also prevents some from being taken back up in the synapse. Ritalin is a reuptake inhibitor so it blocks some of the dopamine to stay in the synapse. It is absolutely horrible to go through the level of boredom that comes with adhd. Something that would easily take five minutes is put off. Even if it’s something you like at times. It can cause bills to go unpaid, class grades to drop, decline in health due to not setting doctors appointments etc. in my experience, untreated adhd was way more debilitating than my depression moods, and it can hide behind the secondary symptoms of it being untreated, such as depression and anxiety. If you’ve tried depression medications and they don’t seem to ever help or they help for a bit and then poop out, look into adhd and bipolar disorder."
news,fero3ly,t3_eq7htg,1579356363.0,"It’s going to get a lot worse than this. Antibiotic resistance is an incredibly terrifying thing that I don’t think most people realize is as dangerous as it is right now. Many healthcare professionals are having to start writing scripts for some of the strongest back of the cabinet antibiotics that we don’t use unless nothing else works. Global scientists are working as hard as they can to find solutions but it’s expensive and bacteria can evolve and replicate faster at times than they can develop an antibiotic. I don’t think many people realize that we’re on the cusp of potentially having people die at much higher rates from what we’ve long considered dangerous mostly to the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, such as the flu, pneumonia, the common cold (yes I know this is a virus but more antibiotic resistance means potential for weaker immune systems and more diversity of super big populations overall). It wasn’t that long ago that the flu and pneumonia was a pretty dangerous thing. And I’m not even getting into small pox which is housed in only two labs in the world. The cdc in Atlanta and Russia. If that thing ever got out it would be terrifying. I remember five years ago or something the cdc was worried because they found a burial site somewhere in Europe of small pox victims. Global warming was causing a lot of melting and they were nervous about containing the frozen virus and keeping it from getting loose."

worldnews,ferlme2,t1_fepvsk1,1579355505.0,"I saw bits and pieces once of a documentary. I think they were sociologists or psychologists. But anyway. They did research by going around the world and visiting rural areas, even remote tribes. They found in some places they had way lower suicide rates even without access to psychotropic drugs. So for example if someone is born with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia and they start to have mania or hallucinations, they are seen as a “seer” and revered. They theorized that the communities embracing them and supporting them helped to normalize what was happening and supported the people."

science,fejm3wc,t3_ep702c,1579179515.0,"An issue most likely contributing to the disparity between income groups, all else equal, is probably that low income groups in the US receive SNAP benefits. Now, eating plant based is actually really affordable as long as you don’t buy all the fancy junk and convenience foods. However, it can be difficult for many low income people to manage that efficiently. Some don’t have access to equipment to cook it on (by cook I mean stovetop and oven- it says eating at home but doesn’t define that as “cooking.”). They work two jobs to support a family and are too exhausted to cook. Pair that with low income groups not being well educated on things like nutrition and personal finance and you see many of them opt for processed foods (low fiber high fat/sugar) than whole plant based foods. IIRC from development Econ, there were some studies that we discussed about diet related health in poorer parts of the world. In some parts of Africa, meat is considered a luxury and so the majority of people in those areas eat plant based diets. And they’re healthy. So, while income may play into it, I think it’s a mediating factor between poor outcomes and commercial food consumed in the SAD (standard American diet)

Hit it with what you can until it’s paid off. Once it’s paid off, begin increasing your emergency fund to 3-6 months of living expenses.

pics,fegfn46,t1_fegcjdf,1579091151.0,"Yes and no. I can agree with what you say. A big problem in my opinion is social media. The younger the person the more open they are to sharing more things online with social circles. Once I deleted my media like Facebook and Snapchat I started being more present in life. It sucks sometimes because I don’t take as many pictures of myself and friends but I’m more present when I’m with them. On the other hand, I think people post things like this because it’s a way for them to share a hardship they are enduring without having to “burden” their friends. It’s incredibly painful to go through loss and have friends and family try to comfort you. You know they’re being kind and trying to help but during grief you have a tendency to get angry at people because you don’t think that they know what you’re going through or could possibly relate. On the other hand, you can get on the internet and find yourself amongst friends - with numerous people having gone through the exact same thing and then knowing what not to say."

LifeAfterSchool,fe7uba9,t3_en1lmj,1578919344.0,"Depends on your plans. Do you play to stay in your city for pretty much forever? If so, a house might make sense. If not, it becomes this asset you hold that is harder to let go when you take a job across the country and have to get rid of it. In a lot of cities where housing markets are overpriced, it’s cheaper to rent than to buy a home. Another thing to consider is that houses are expensive. Really expensive. My roommate had to pull $3000 out of pocket last summer because the AC unit went out. When you live in a house you either have $3000 on hand to fix that, or you have no AC. If you live in an apartment, you just call maintenance and they come fix it. Or, if you do what I did and get a personal person who owns a home that they rent a room out to you, they as a landlord take care of it and fix it. So a house can add up really fast. That’s not including the down payment and insurance if you’re required to pay it. Those are things to weigh when considering whether to rent or buy"
