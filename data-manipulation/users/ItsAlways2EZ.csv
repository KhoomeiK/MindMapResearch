conspiracy,ffj58ot,t1_ffi0ubf,1579990723.0,"You would take these precautions if you don’t fully understand the virus. Of course, I’m not saying you’re wrong. I’m just saying, in terms of disease control, an unknown virus is treated in the same way as someone would treat the deadliest virus in the world. You don’t know how deadly it is, so if it’s unknown, and there’s potential for it to be the most deadly virus in history, then yes, you’re going to take these precautionary steps. 1300 people, even if the city population is 11,000,000, is still a significant amount of people for how new this virus is. 

That’s why it’s called “precaution,” you don’t know, so you take preventative steps. Just in case.  

Again, I’m saying this respectfully. It could be either or. I’m just putting it out there"
AskReddit,ffj1nkp,t3_etqf2g,1579988138.0,"In Naruto Shippuden, when everyone is telling Naruto that Sasuke is too far gone and that the only way to stop him is to kill him. 

And then, after hearing this so many times from so many people,  Naruto has a panic attack and collapses from the pressure and pain he’s going through. 

So heavy."

gaming,ffchfre,t3_estmeh,1579799533.0,This was Dishonored for me. That end song “Honor For All” was so good. Captured the mood and theme of the game completely. Especially with the Outsider’s ending monologue in the bad ending. Oof. Made me feel some type of way.
gaming,ffb6c6w,t1_ffb5eyx,1579752971.0,"A new virus has sprung up, originating in China, and is now spreading (few cases here and there in other countries, including the US).

People are making a big deal of it because it’s a new virus, but, while it has infected a few hundred people already, less than 20 have died, all of which were old, young, or immunocompromised to some degree. Nothing to worry about"

Aquariums,ff866xx,t3_es5jui,1579667107.0,"Truth. It’s people like this that ruin the hobby for people and scare away new people. Imagine you’re so excited about your first tank, so you post a pic, and get torn to shreds. That would instantly take all the fun out of it, and ruin the whole thing. People can be so damn annoying about this kinda thing, in every hobby/ fandom/ anything"
Minecraft,ff56g3p,t1_ff55oii,1579581577.0,"There’s something in the game called a “Conduit” 

First you have to find a heart of the sea item from a buried treasure (map you find in a shipwreck etc. with an X on it) - in the buried chest you’ll find this item

Then you need to gather 8 Nautilus shells. Go into a crafting table, place the heart of the sea in the middle, and surround it with the 8 shells, and you’ll get a conduit. 

Then, go underwater, place the conduit, and make 3 squares (3 by 3) around the conduit out of prismarine blocks (one around the side, and 2 going over top/ below it) and then you’ll have a fully powered conduit, and you’ll be able to breathe under water, you’ll have night vision, and you’ll be able to mine blocks underwater faster. It’s basically an underwater beacon!

AskReddit,fev7gtp,t3_eqies2,1579394061.0,"One time, me and my friends were all stoned as fuck, hanging out late. It got to 1:59 in the morning, I had just checked my phone. Fast forward a half hour later, and it’s 1:30. I was so freaked out. 

Another hour goes by, and then I remember and just shout out “IT’S DAYLIGHT SAVINGS” and with that all my friends share a collective “hooooly shit”

It appeared that we had all collectively been freaking out internally about an alleged “matrix glitch” when, in reality, we were just a bunch of stoned dumbasses"
