When you understand something, there's no need to memorize anything. This is why since Day 1 being in a classroom, I haven't needed very many notes.

Young people are worlds apart from adults, even young people who are around 23, 24 years old are worlds apart, for the most part, from somebody who's 30 or over. Many Americans under 26 really haven't formed a personality just yet. And in the past 10 years, most people under 30 have a phone with more personality. How on earth could an older adult relate? How could a young person who experiences all reality through their phone relate to an adult who experiences reality in reality?

Before I finished college, I struggled in trying to learn why relationships could be so tiring, awful, and fleeting instances of happiness. I wondered why my employers were so angry all of the time, and I wondered why so much attention and energy was focused on politics whenever I turned on the 1990s television (before streaming services). I also wondered why so many folks were harping on ""global warming"" as it was called back then. Likewise, I wondered as did Rodney King about why we couldn't all just get along. I wondered why (at that point in my life in 1992) why most black Los Angelenos were rioting, and I wondered a couple of years before that why the U.S. had to police Saddam Hussein's actions in the middle east.

Now I know why and have gained a better understanding of society, the world, myself via my bachelor's degree. Especially when it comes to worker-employer relationships. I understand why they are so fucking cheap and why too many of them are little tyrants over their workers. I understand human self interest and how it shapes our experiences. 

Of course, anyone can get along wondering why all the time and be safe without a college education. But for me personally, I'm a curious person and when things are amiss, I want to know why.

From a more practical level, I was committed to finishing my degree back in the 1990s because I  realized that my life would be a long list of dead end jobs if I didn't finish college. One of my work supervisors back then had two years of college and then he quit ""because it got hard."" He routinely expressed his regret, having to go his life from his 20s to his 50s as a wage worker, never being given the opportunity to do work that he truly enjoyed. Seeing that made me want to do well and learn all that I could.

My first college roommate finished three semesters and then dropped out for a restaurant job paying in 1991 somewhere around $1500 per month. He thought that was more beneficial. He never went back and finished and today he labors probably around 70-75 hours a week and works for three different restaurants.

I'm a high school teacher, full time, and an adjunct at a local university. I can safely say that by the time the final exam rolls around, students are for the most part done with the class.

I've seen students do very well on every assignment, and then it's almost as if they intentionally bombed the final exam, as if doing that on purpose. When I've asked repeat students why they bombed the final, they sometimes explain that all of their brainpower had been used in the previous 15 weeks of the semester and that they had none left.

Students also marshal the usual litany of excuses surrounding holiday/summer plans that took precedent, dead/sick/infirmed relatives, work pressures, their zodiac signs were unaligned, or they are an empath based on the Myers Briggs theory and feel the pain of every living human being on the earth (and that prevented them from studying for the final exam).

I'd say that it's weighted so high probably because the course you're taking is a cumulative course, like anatomy and physiology or any kind of math. Cumulative courses mean the student has really mastered the material if they can learn all the steps to completing a process (and will need the course content to do well in upper level classes required for their degree).

Students then typically try to hedge their bets and say that all of it was awful because it involves words which are ""the most useless things ever!""

Pharmaceutical food science execs have headed the FDA.

Corporate execs of all types have been appointed as Labor Secretary.

Construction company execs have headed HUD (which is currently run by an ex-surgeon).

At the state level, insurance commissioners have come from the executive ranks of major insurance companies, highway commissioners from highway construction companies, and agriculture secretaries have come out of the ranks of large agribusiness corporations like Archer, Daniels, Midland and Monsanto. 

Even in state legislatures, ALEC writes legislation that legislators sponsor. ALEC is a private organization developing public policy. That's got to be a conflict of interest.

politics,fesw7eg,t3_eqgmc8,1579369647.0,"Probably because the vast majority of Americans reject scientific study of really any kind of public health-related issue. Isn't that one reason why Donald Trump is so popular? Because he admittedly does not need science or studies or eggheads; he just shoots from the hip.

I somewhat agree with Biden, and I'm a 30+ year marijuana (rec) user. I don't smoke anymore, I just use home-made edibles. Because as Willie Nelson has recently stated, I've done damage to my lungs.

There are definitive public health issues related to marijuana use. And as a pain reliever, I'm just not sold on that quality since using weed seemingly makes pain worse, especially headache pain. William S. Burroughs even noted as much in Naked Lunch.

I'd say that decrim should be a national policy, and it'll be another 100 years at least before any Deep South states allow rec weed. Even those that have legalized medical in the South have yet to allow its sale in certain states. Other southern states that have decriminalized still maintain strict prohibition of the evil weed in various local areas, and have prison populations with numbers around 30% in the klink for pot sale and/or possession. 

Concentrates and edibles can be dangerous if the user doesn't know what they are getting themselves into, and I think Biden is correct in that it needs further study before we foist yet another recreational drug onto the American people via profit-driven corporations.

For full disclosure, I know my remarks here will win few friends, and I wanted to point out that I do not support Biden's campaign at all. But that doesn't mean he isn't making sense on this issue."

You've ignored my argument. Swift is like many pop stars who lack any creativity. Her music is popular now, but by 2030, she will have fewer fans and will probably be an actor or a celeb in TV commercials since some other pop star will be selling overpriced concert tickets by that time. Remember Tiffany? Debbie Gibson? Even Madonna no longer makes songs or albums. Remember Christina? Brittany? Swift is destined to go down to oblivion just like all of the previous vapid celebs have done in the past.
