You also won’t make your daughter bring feminine products to school because of the clear backpack?? Um...put them in a different container inside the backpack then. And, YTA for taking your daughter out of school everytime she calls you.  Coming from someone who got really good at skipping class, taking her out whenever she calls is kind of a bad idea. Plus why would you take her home??? You could just bring pads, spare underwear, and some ibuprofen to the school when she calls. There’s just no reason why she should be going home for that."

I’m a professional artist and we use color theory to create our pieces the same way a makeup artist can. In color theory, cool colors recede or create shadows, and warm colors advance. So realistically contour is meant to create shadows or depth, so I personally would use a cool color rather than a warm color. The dark concealer OP got in her box is very warm, so I think if she were to mix in some of her regular concealer and lightened it, it might work as a liquid bronzer...but most for  people that’d be a pain in the butt lol"

SkincareAddiction,fgbx6fe,t1_fg8n3mx,1580666948.0,"Well that depends on what you define as an acne “scar”. A true acne scar is the divets in your skin after acne has gone away. They usually don’t have any pigment. Then there’s Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) which is not an acne scar, but still annoying. It’s a brownish or tan mark. Hydroquinone is used to treat this most commonly, but for short periods of time. Vitamin C is also popular and may help. You should also use sunscreen because avoiding it will exasperate the problem. Then lastly post inflammatory erythema (PIE) is similar to PIH but the marks will be more red and pink rather than brown. If you take a clear glass and press it against the affected area, and the pink red colors go away where you are pressing, you know it’s probably PIE. Niacinimide is thought to be an effective treatment for PIE, as well as vitamin C. However do not mix the two! Your skin will not be happy haha.  Hope you got some helpful info from my spiel"
