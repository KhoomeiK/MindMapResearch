WilmingtonDE,ff4obul,t3_erkh5m,1579568493.0,"Trust me on this. Just get an apartment on the Riverfront. There are a bunch of apartments for rent in this area. There may be also some condos for rent as well from private owners. This place is way better than Trolley Square and this place is within your budget. It's more vibrant. Pet friendly. Has a nice park and boardwalk where people walk their dogs. Apartments have garages, so you don't have to do street parking if you don't want to. It's in a great location. The views of the river are amazing. It's also more safe. There are quite a good amount of bars and restaurants within walking distance. They have concerts during the summer. 

I don't understand why people like Trolley Square - the houses are just old, parking is weird and difficult, and most of the places only have street parking. The streets are narrow. Besides, it's not as safe as Riverfront. The bars are just old. Brew Ha Ha is possibly the only decent place to hang out at. The houses there just have no views. Never understood the appeal of Trolley Square."

I mean, look at what happened with MH-17 in Ukraine. At least Iran owned up - Russia still hasn't owned up for their clusterf--k."
businessschool,fczossv,t1_fcwkcdr,1578105892.0,"This is the best advice. Do not pitch your ideas. Successful CEOs like him hear dozens of ideas like these every day from young folks like you. It's a turn off. 

Instead take time to learn about the man himself. Learn about how he got started. What drove him. What his passions are. How he found his purpose. What excites him. What motivates him. And what keeps him up at night. What would he do differently. What would he wish to learn more. What influenced him. Who does he turn to when he needs advice on something. What books does he like to read. What his views of the [insert your field] are. What does he think about any new trends. There's so much you can talk about.

And most importantly, listen to him. Don't interrupt. Ask him a question and let him talk."
aww,fcvg46a,t1_fcvftus,1578001374.0,The prototype was a success. The subject was a failure.
aww,fcvd6io,t1_fcv4ate,1577999630.0,It's illegal to provide such a cute story without sharing any photos.
aww,fcvcvov,t1_fcvcok8,1577999448.0,They were testing the prototype on Mark Zuckerberg. It's been a success.
FinancialPlanning,fcteoj1,t1_fbxo83r,1577940861.0,Apple is a great stock. It grew by 80% last year. I bought Apple at the start of the last decade (2010) at around $50. Today it’s almost $300. Has the market gone through ups and down in last 10 years? Off course. But in my book any investment that grows almost 6 times in last 10 years is a good investment.
MBA,fct65z2,t1_fcljsa4,1577933897.0,"There are a lot of folks from different industries. My class has doctors, folks from military background, med-tech, finance, technology (including some from FAANG), big 4 consulting, entertainment industry, and even a couple of CEOs of small startups."
MBA,fcltqc8,t1_fclt6um,1577756243.0,"It depends on your goal and where you are in your career now. My first masters degree was almost a decade earlier and it helped me a lot in last 10 years or so. But I want to grow more into senior leadership role, which isn’t that easy at a large organization. 

Besides, there are so many intangible benefits from pursing a MBA, especially when you have a strong work experience. You are not just learning about management or finance or whatever, but also are building your network and new relationships which may play a significant role in your career ahead. 

Definitely go for a two-year program. Networking is one of the biggest benefits of pursuing MBA. The finance stuff you can generally learn most of it from a book or YouTube videos."
MBA,fclgsls,t1_fckpxad,1577747439.0,It's from one of the top 10 MBA schools. Although the travel kinda sucks but being able to network with some of the smartest and successful folks from other the opposite coast is totally worth it.
MBA,fckn6dc,t3_ehlv4k,1577728952.0,Can confirm. I completed my Masters in Computer Science in two years while working full time. Now I'm flying 2500+ miles every two weeks to the opposite coast to complete my MBA also while working full time. My friends think I am crazy. They are right.
macbook,fc3lwmd,t3_efxks8,1577392807.0,">I've installed brew and zsh, so it is basically very Linux-like. Most of my tools are of course available, databases, IDE's and the usual *nix tools.

Check out [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/features.html) if you use a lot of command line. I find iTerm2 more customizable and I can define shortcuts to easily access other environments and remote machines.

>I need to get used to the command keys. My keyboard layout is Icelandic, and I usually write '@' with Alt-Q on Windows/Linux, and I don't know how many times I've quit programs when writing an email address. :)

Check out [how to create your own custom keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/create-keyboard-shortcuts-for-apps-mchlp2271/mac) by going into System Preferences -> Keyboard.

>I'm still looking for a quick image viewer/editor. Something that allows me the browse image folder and make quick adjustments. Any recommendations?

This one depends on what you mean by ""quick adjustments"". I find Preview to be enough for creating annotations, boxes, underlines, cropping, etc. For Photos, the Photos app is enough for me. If you need more advanced stuff, you might like [Pixelmator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12).

>Also, lightweight editor. Most of the time I just use vim, but I would like some nice GUI version with basic features.

I use [Atom](https://atom.io). [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) is another good alternative.

>The keyboard is at best average. Lenovo's Thinkpads are still king. Even Dell X's have much better keyboards. I would gladly add 1mm to overall thickness if I could get a little more travel for the keys.

I hear ya. At work I use a 2016 MBP which uses the butterfly keyboard and it sucks. But I recently got a 2019 16'' MacBook Pro [which ditched the butterfly keyboard and went back to previous version](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/2019-16-inch-macbook-pro-review-bye-bye-butterfly/), and it's so much better. It's quieter and in my opinion a lot better."
