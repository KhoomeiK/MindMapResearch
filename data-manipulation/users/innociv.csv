I want a president who won't get in the way of pharma execs being **jailed** and having everything they stole taken away from them. Probably the main reason Yang isn't tied with Bernie for me is that Yang hasn't shown he'll be strong on persecuting crimes under the past administration. Whereas Bernie has said, IIRC, that Obama's biggest mistake was not persecuting the fraudsters on Wallstreet which I 100% agree with. Or maybe it was not continuing to campaign... but still. He said that was a big mistake.  
Trump belongs in jail. Pharma execs and pushers in jail. Barr in jail. Stop giving a pass to criminals in previous administrations or they'll keep doing this shit."

This is the establishment's punishment to Tulsi for her revealing the corruption in the DNC in 2016."

My response would be that I think her record and actions speak louder than any connections she has. I think her Chris Butler connection is no worse than some of the connections Obama had and was dogged about. I understand he is the reason she was anti-gay to start with, but *clearly* he isn't *mind-controlling* her as the trolls seem to imply as she quickly grew up and moved past that.

Ultimately I respect your opinion, though find it misguided. I think you may just be easily gaslighted, as many people are. It's easier to fool someone than convince them that they're fooled. I'm just happy you didn't just say ""Russian plant"" and had somewhat reasonable criticisms that I just don't fully agree with."
WayOfTheBern,fedifi9,t1_fed6o5d,1579012339.0,What's more crazy is the twitter replies with 500+ likes calling her a Russian plant. People blindly believe that shit because Hillary trolls call anyone anti-establishment a Russian plant.

Sanders and Warren were so close in the senate, but she keeps turning on him illogically in these primaries."
