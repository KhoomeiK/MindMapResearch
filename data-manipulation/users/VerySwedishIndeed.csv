Also thanks! I do come off as more healthy than I am though, I'm having a really good day but this is more of who I am when I don't feel depressed."

LucidDreaming,fejhyku,t3_epbbrd,1579175071.0,"I see what you mean and I agree to an extent, but in my case it got better after I stopped trying. Some people try way too hard and if you continue getting discouraged when it isn't working you can end up being the problem you're not lucid dreaming. I stopped a few weeks ago as I stressed way too much over it and since then I've ""almost"" entered some lucid dreams with natural WBTB method, but the times it happened I had reasons not to go back to sleep. I also just had a natural lucid dream last night, this is more lucid dreams compared to when I tried to do it every single night. If you have a bad mindset or you stop beliving in yourself I think it's better to take a break from it and then return to it with a fresh mind."
unpopularopinion,fejbtiv,t3_epfcvz,1579166124.0,"I'm depressed but I always try to be kind and nice, I do have some bad days but if someone is continually an asshole they're simple an asshole that tries to come up with an excuse. If anything you should apologize if you had a bad day or said something rude that you didn't mean. I've never actually heard about this and I'm suprised that it's supposedly pretty controversial."
unpopularopinion,feg43q5,t3_eozim8,1579076026.0,Fuck both.
unpopularopinion,feb16ur,t3_eobinj,1578954425.0,You should tell her to stop if it is bothering you.
unpopularopinion,fe4arda,t3_enri6r,1578857370.0,"I think most people that are really struggling with having enough time with things have other factors that play a huge part. It could be as simple as laziness or lack of motivation. It could also be, and now I'm describing myself, things like depression, anxiety, stress etc.

I go to school and my schedule is honestly not bad, I have 2 sleep-ins a week and soon I will have 3. I also only have one lesson on Friday. Still, I'm struggling in 4 subjects and I'm stressing over stuff every single day. For me it's a combination of everything I stated above. I have enough time, I just can't push myself to do it.

It's my choice though if I want it to get any better, that's why I'm going to see a therapist at some point."
StardewValley,fdq3auu,t1_fdq2rqp,1578652781.0,That would be going a bit too far for me. I did find a site that sells digital keys for the Switch so I'll take that as a last way out. Thanks for help anyway!
