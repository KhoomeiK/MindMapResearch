AskReddit,ffaywsk,t1_ffapmbn,1579747705.0,"I purchased a 3 year extended warranty for a Toshiba laptop about 14 years ago on year 2 the CPU fan died took it in. Who ever they sent it to for repair said hard drive has bad sectors, screen had dead pixels (I never saw a dead pixel), the CPU was damaged due to the fan failing (it booted to windows I'm pretty sure it was fine). They didn't make the mother board or the processor any more so they replaced it with a new and better one dual core to quad core, said the ram wasn't compatible so they changed from 2 512mb sticks to 2 1gb sticks, 60 GB HDD to 100 GB HDD (didn't make 60 GB any more) and a screen with better resolution view angle. 
Every major component was upgraded it was an amazing experience."

cablegore,felp473,t1_felnske,1579227513.0,"Maybe the card reader controller is on a stand alone network and they are using the conduit behind card reader to get to the controller. 
Other than that this confuses me I'd have to poke around to see exactly what they are doing also security systems isn't always the same as card access. So if there is a code to bypass the alarm system in there it might be completely separate from that card reader."
cablegore,feln8dk,t1_fej1hd6,1579226221.0,That extra Poe port is a nice touch.  Run a power injector into the thing and then run a camera off a light pole no need for a Poe switch connected to a wifi receiver / transmitter. Just that thing save lots of money.
cablegore,felmsgn,t1_felk66a,1579225919.0,"Usually a seperate cable running from the controller for a lock. Also being sub station there would be a door contact 2 more conductors required.

So I  would bet the card reader cable was fucked in a conduit and it won't pull out. (Water in the conduit and not outdoor rated cable)

Contractor tech showed up to fix and did a temp fix. He then had a quote made up which to have a new line trenched. Quote was sent to head office. While waiting for that bureaucracy to go through something hit the line and it broke. A Sparky then showed up to get into the building noticed card reader was dead so he couldn't get in. Saw the broken cable thought I bet if I splice that back together it will work he did, it does work.

That quote will have been lost and be reissued the next time the tech comes out to fix something else."
cablegore,feljyq9,t1_felhvkx,1579223991.0,Lol I didn't notice that huge splice in The middle. Also just thought of this how is the card reader releasing the door as most card readers don't have outputs on them. Is it just for time and attendance?
cablegore,felj6sg,t1_fek1v4c,1579223457.0,But most card access systems allow you to network the controllers. So they could have put a controller in the building and used wireless for that connection or if only rs485 could of used an rs 485 - eth- wireless - wireless - eth - rs 485. So many ways to make this work. But i bet that cables temporary or don't call that company back get another company to do it right.

cablegore,felfuuk,t3_epen67,1579221192.0,Wow most card readers are 6 conductor shielded. Also doesn't look like our door rated cable. I bet the facility didn't want to pay to trench it in or this is temporarily done as the previously cable under ground is damaged possible due to not being outdoor rated and conduit getting water in it by possibly being crushed hence why that can't use the old one as a pull string.

talesfromtechsupport,feija9g,t1_fegkjip,1579139826.0,8 k a year gets what maybe 60 man hours a year from a third party contractor? So log in 1 hour a week make sure there are no dead switches check the settings then the documentation make sure nothings changed. Make any changes requested. Be done in 40 min call it an hour go grab a coffee. That's sounds like a contractor to me.
