> jump in front a train to kill yourself? Your family gets fined.

Not quite. *You* (or, since you're dead, your estate) gets fined. So if you had savings, your fine comes out of there. If you have property, it can be sold to cover your debts. Same as any other type of debt you die with. But it's only money/property/assets in *your* name (or jointly owned by you). If the folks in your family have separate bank accounts, they don't pay anything -- *they* haven't broken any civil or criminal laws, so they *can't* be fined.  
Now, as in many countries, debt collectors can be scummy, and they can pressure people into paying out of a sense of obligation. So there are people who pay train companies because they *believe* that they have to, but, in reality, they don't."
