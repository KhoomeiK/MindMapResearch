leagueoflegends,ffge550,t1_fffmmvb,1579904215.0,New Jersey needs a rebranding. Fry wont even live there.
leagueoflegends,ffge1po,t1_fffjx0n,1579904156.0,I prefer the classic ones with big logo and no sponsor on front taking up most of the space. I get sponsors are important and you can charge a premium for dedicating such big space on your Jersey for them but then you look dumb. Should be subtle like Honda logo is on TL. SK got eaten by Tmobile.
leagueoflegends,ffd6cvy,t1_ffcg9bu,1579814290.0,"Points all valid for Sven but if there was a chance he would reconsider, what a fucking slap to the face to basically forfeit group stage to give your future starter more experience. Honestly think 100% Sven was going to be cashed out anyway. The other players were part of a bundled deal."
AskReddit,ffameyh,t3_esc8vq,1579739363.0,I would feel up my 13 year old self so I can convince myself I've been suffering depression all this time for nothing. I just felt myself in the past so it's okay.
leagueoflegends,ffalbe7,t1_ffak2yo,1579738607.0,"Just curious. How many employees work building, not entire company if it's global? I think size matters but I get you either way and I'm sure you get us. There's only a handful of ideal solutions and we definitely wouldn't know which would work best here."
leagueoflegends,ffakxx2,t1_ffagh9x,1579738342.0,"We will have to see the sponsors. Like MasterCard coming back backs they may be improving. However, could be an influx of smaller sponsors or newer companies that aren't thinking of preserving their brand but only focused on getting attention. End of the day, League encapsulates a very lucrative demographic that makes advertisers really attracted to it. For bigger companies especially mature companies, reaching our audience might not be worth the risk of hurting their brand. New growing companies however are simply looking for new customers. For me, I wouldn't assume a new company supports female discrimination simple because they support LCS. While I also wouldn't make such a connection with MasterCard, I would definitely question why the hell they renewed partnership because surely they have options.

Afaik, a majority of not all sponsors for teams are shared by entire organization. For example, Dr. Pepper sponsors TSM that supports LCS amd Fortnight league and I assume all other TSM teams. If this wasn't the case, Id be curious if pro teams would have the sponsors they have. I still think it's insane how much money is being invested into LCS teams. Overtime, the investment seems less and less likely to even break even of Riot continues their path but Riots saving grace is that there is a huge disconnect between corporate and community. When most people think of League, they picture their friends, pros, casters, long before they think of corporate douchbags constantly ignoring problems."
leagueoflegends,ffajqh3,t1_ff9h3yg,1579737447.0,"Was a roster move inside the team, but Xmithie and Zuna roleswap destroyed my favorite team, Vulcun. Alliance taking Rekkles and whole team got too passive to win games?"

leagueoflegends,ffah469,t1_ffa4nlj,1579735606.0,"In an ideal world, I like what you are saying but apparently Riot exercises too many layers of bs that small gradual changes won't work. Most people never change. Now you're talking about changing a culture with hundreds or thousands of employees. In the end, money talks. I wouldn't be surprised if they need to pool a lot of resources just to fix one simple problem while letting 10 more problems arise. Sometimes people only change when their livelihood is threatened. Unfortunately many more people may feel the hurt before those that let the problems grow are hurt."

leagueoflegends,ffagb7u,t1_ffa448u,1579735077.0,We'd never get there because of visa issues. Imports would need to prove they are much better at being farted on than Americans already living here.
leagueoflegends,ffag43d,t1_ffab2gs,1579734946.0,"You are correct. The only thing that would actually make them take action is for players to stop paying and playing the game enough to push them into overhauling all the execs where they have no power and just sit back and collect money assuming they have stake. Also curious if the PR gets so bad, sponsors start pulling away and the pro scene gets hurt enough if Riot will care. Money talks and there will always be some sort of a pro scene as long as there are players but if they screw badly enough, I can see them scaling back, let the pro scene be taken over by a third party if any are willing, and tweak their in game market to still generate the margins they are looking for."
leagueoflegends,ffafi95,t1_ff9tb4r,1579734533.0,"Knowing Riot, they'll push it to $420M for the lulz bro, then get sued for $1.2 Billion. Expect many more skins in 2020."

leagueoflegends,feomiz9,t1_feju6gp,1579302190.0,"I'm getting kind of pissed about this show. By design, this is the show for me but lately, not sure if the annoyance just added up or poor execution but should be called DumbLine League.

I know it's pre season and not much to talk about but the show needs to do a better job of shaping people's takes so hot ones can actually be picked.

I've seen too many cold episodes in a row that I'm burnt out. A cold take is something usually obvious that the consensus agrees on, usually because it's the most logical take. Hottakes lately have been dumb. If someone has a dumbtake usually they are also dumb so investing in conversation is just painful to listen to.

Lately it's been a show where Travis, Mark, and a guest use common sense to explain why the hottake is wrong. What is hot about that? I like the format. Travis and Mark are always great personalities. I know once the season starts it will get more entertaining but lately, think the show has been getting lazy. I know the vibe was always to be laid back but if it feels like a show that needs to be done with zero effort, do something else. Mark could easily do a solo show while taking a dump with zero effort but because he's one of the smartest minds in league, there would be value there. It's crazy how little of an ego he has surrounded by people who constantly say dumb shit and he graciously takes on projects where he plays off of other people's responses such as this show or the analyst desk. But shit in shit out. This has been a waste of his intellect. Travis could simply do more feel good content as well. I much rather have two guests to increase discussion. Perhaps take calls to fuel a fire between the 4 people on the show if there are disagreements. At this point though, when 2 or more takes are really stupid, it makes me less and less likely to comeback other than white noise in the background but i doubt sponsors want to sponsor a white noise show.

Fix your shit!"

buildapcsales,fe73gpd,t1_fe5khqn,1578909494.0,"I think tcl is still fairly new to be buying tv's that expensive. They obviously have qc issues. Now if you buy extended warranty and are fine with total price paid for a tv that lasts as long as the extended warranty, you can go with all the specs you want blind from brand and reputation. You can argue other brands have problems but its all a numbers game. Even ignoring panel lottery, I think tcl is close but not there from my own tcl and skimming reviews. Sadly we don't have many options. LG is bad for dark rooms with their rgbw panels unless you get oled. Samsung and Sony are way more expensive for similar specs compared to tcl. Vizios ratings vary across models and years far too much that I kind of ignore them now. Anything below tcl and vizio though, you just want something that works and pray it lasts. Might be wrong, but I believe someone told me Philips in EU is good but in US sucks because they use different manufacturers."
buildapcsales,fe71f2p,t1_fe5jqqq,1578908749.0,"Nope. 55 isn't in stock anymore online for the same series but the difference in price isn't much so everyone is getting the 65. I was just at a best buy but can't recall the price. I want to say $419 or $479. Either way, less than $100 for 10 more inches or 40% more screen."

rainbowbridge,fcp5cp8,t3_eidh8d,1577850976.0,"Haven't had the heart to post this but definitely would have regretted posting into the new year. This good boy was my baby, my everything. Got 4 months extra nursing him back to health, coming home during lunch breaks to walk him out as he couldn't walk himself anymore after vet recommended he be put down. I knew he had a lot of life still left. However about a week and a half before he was put down, it's like everything that could go wrong did. He had degenerative disc disease. Lost his ability to walk due to loss in movement of his hind legs. It was torture to watch as one day, his good hind leg stopped working. He tried desperately to get up  but couldn't. Not only sadness but panic in his eyes broke my heart as I knew it was his time to move on. He stopped eating as well. I selfishly kept him 3 days longer with pain meds because it was happening too fast and I couldn't let him go in what seemed like a day. He was totally zoned out a few days before I first took him to the vet. With pain meds, I got my dog back for a short period of time. For maybe 3 years when he couldn't go upside for a belly rub, he wouldn't let me give him one, but the day before being put down, I finally got to give him one. The pure joy in his face was priceless.

The experience was too surreal. I did cry a few times but not as much as I wanted to. What was days seemed like years or perhaps lifetimes passing really fast. It was very bitter sweet. It's hard to be 100% sad when I know his suffering was going to finally end. I just felt hollow for a while. Just counting the days, weeks, now months finding it hard to comprehend that in such a short time, I was still with my boy. This is one year I don't want to move from but as time passes, my heart won't. Richie aka Fuzzy Richums aka Baby Beast aka Babes The Dog just to name a few, I'll always miss you. You are the perfect dog for me and will always be my dog.
