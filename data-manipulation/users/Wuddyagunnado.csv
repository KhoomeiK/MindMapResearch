collapse,fffa4zp,t1_ffekwrs,1579879434.0,"Let's recognize first that timezones on clocks came from sundials, originally. Sun moves around, hand moves around, different angles in different places. We are still using the sundial system today despite a more complete understanding of time and different needs. We know that when it is 2300h in NY and 2000h in LA that people in NY and LA are experiencing events at the same time. If they want to call one another, they have to figure out the timezone difference. Why do their clocks show different times if they exist at the same time?

The hardest part for you is going to be trying to see it without bias. You've grown up with the current system and your brain now understands it as *the way*, but try to imagine if clocks had instead always showed the same time as one another, and I was now proposing that we introduce timezones.

Numbers being associated with certain times of day? THAT is completely arbitrary. Who cares if when the sun rises the clock reads 0600h or 1800h? It's the sunlight or the darkness that matter, and from birth you would understand that the sun rises at 1800h where you live. If clocks were all the same, it would be equally easy to learn that people usually go to work in the morning at 0100h in Beijing as it is now to learn that Beijing is +7h difference...

You know what else is arbitrary and makes no sense? [The international date line.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/International_Date_Line.png) Can you imagine stepping over an imaginary line and changing your clock to the day prior? Who does *that* help?

The most important positive change would be in international coordination. Making an international phone call is a perfect example actually, and you showed why. One person calls at 1500, the other person picks up at 1500. No conversion necessary, and no possible confusion about when exactly things are going on.

Definitely disagree. All three probably sped up the rate of discovery, but I would challenge you to **name one important scientific discovery** that could not have happened without industry, a population of greater than 100 million people, or pollution at the scale which we are currently producing.

>10-90% of the Earth's surface

Not all the Earth's surface was equally valuable to us when it was wild. In fact, the places that were most valuable to us are today some of the most urbanized, and so have lost much of their value in the context in which they had it.

So the raw % of land area isn't a terribly important figure.

Additionally, it's easy to argue that we have disturbed 100% of the land area of the planet. Climate change affects local weather events, and nowhere is immune from weather. Of course, whether we have disturbed 10% or 100% depends on where we draw the line. What, to you, counts as ""disturbed surface""?

>find a way to depopulate Earth to this level, while keeping all the advancements?

This one. Keep the good, throw away the bad, replenish the good that was lost, don't reacquire any bad habits, seek more good, avoid new forms of bad. Awareness of present, past, and future. 

>you can't have a developed society without all the industry and population and pollution that goes along with it

Hypothetically speaking, why not?"
todayilearned,fewl0jc,t1_fewil8n,1579413157.0,"I think you're underestimating the diminishing returns on benefits of higher population.

If we have too few people, we suffer from:

* vulnerability to natural disasters
* less genetic diversity
* less cultural diversity
* less diversity of ideas
* less available labour
* etc.

If we have too many people, we suffer from:

* crowding
* overconsumption of limited resources
* intensification of pollution
* less relative individual value
* etc.

There is a happy medium depending on the context. It seems to me that more advanced civilizations should have lower populations, because technology  mitigates the downsides:

* prediction of natural disasters, widespread communication, diverting asteroids centuries in advance
* genetic diversity is a nonissue even with just 100 million people worldwide
* technology lets people develop ideas more easily alone (computation before computers required teams of people)
* technology replaces and enhances labour

More advanced civilizations also suffer more from the downsides of higher population:

* crowding is sometimes worse in more advanced civilizations (a bit of a stretch)
* using technology consumes more resources per capita
* more pollution per capita
* less need for physical and intellectual labour with factories, AI

So if we had 600 million people in the year 1700, and we are a more advanced civilization now, shouldn't we at least not be suffering from underpopulation if we were still at 600 million with modern technology?"

My intuition says the lower the better, and that we'd still see more benefits than losses if we went as low as 100 million globally, but trying to make a precise estimate is beyond me.

The pie is smaller than it used to be. The land that exists is less bountiful than it used to be. The easily-extractable resources have been extracted, there is a lot of pavement where things used to grow, and we're reducing the quality of the topsoil that remains. Industrial agriculture is great for feeding lots of people, but an acre of monoculture is an ecological wasteland, and more people doesn't necessarily mean better.

Here are some unorganized thoughts on it:

A failure of urban planning was a huge part of it for me. I grew up in suburbia in a Canadian city: a bunch of closed doors, friends too far away, so many roads and cars that I couldn't go exploring or find friends my own age, so I stayed inside and played videogames and didn't develop social skills. My family fought a lot, which left me with PTSD, but there wasn't a close community to support me because everyone has private homes with locks, and there were no community events, and nobody asked personal questions, so I suffered alone my entire childhood.

Human lives have been devalued since the industrial revolution because we can't do the same amount of work as combustion engines for anywhere near the same cost. Everything is mass-produced somewhere else. Our work is disconnected from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the items we collect, the games we play. Overpopulation also doesn't help me feel more valuable. The value the average person can add to the world through physical or mental effort is outweighed by the environmental impact of living a full healthy life. Every job I've had feels more like I'm taking away a job from someone else than contributing to a future I believe in. Ideally we'd let global population fall to 500 million or less as quickly and humanely as possible, and convert all retail and fast food work to creative work (who on earth would rather be selling garbage than creating something beautiful?)

How important is the health of nature in human mental health? I suspect it is hugely important. For any other city dwellers out there, think of how peaceful it is to get out into the mountains for a hike, and how the sense of space and connection affects you. Now imagine if nature was your *home*, not just a sometimes destination, and food literally grew on trees you'd known since you were a child, and think of how little we share in common with that kind of life. We have lost so much, and I really feel the loss of that. I'm in mourning for what's already gone, and the trauma worsens as our rape of Mother Nature becomes fiercer, and I can watch it all from my computer or smartphone in stunning HD.

We are animals who are extremely far from our natural environments, and we need to make sure that the artificial environment we've made is satisfying everyone's needs, *including* social/emotional ones.

Now we need more energy and new ideas I think, but I'm bitterly disappointed in how little respect he was shown by the club in the past week. If it turns out that the pressure to fire him came from Saudi Arabia, I would no longer feel proud to call myself a Barça supporter.

Thank you, Valverde.

MagicArena,fe06plp,t1_fe05ryr,1578804464.0,"I don't see how adding more viable cards to the game would cause the meta to shrink. If there aren't many viable decks then they're not balancing the game right, but WotC seems to me to be pretty good at balance, overall.

But let's clarify that we're talking about two different changes...

1. Buying all cards in a set for a flat sum
2. Normalizing power level of cards

Making the first one would reduce the diversity of decks in the meta in isolation, because people wouldn't be forced to run garbage cards. That's arguably fine anyways, because the players that would benefit are the non-whales. Making the first change would force them to make the second one, because otherwise the weaker cards would have literally no use, and that would open up diversity again, I would argue to greater than it is now."

Multiply that by however many players would be willing to just pay directly for what they want, and devote all development time to figuring out how to make the best client possible, and tell me everyone wouldn't be happier.

We have been suckered into thinking paying a shitload of cash for cosmetics is okay while a full set is always out of reach. Just... make a good product, let me pay for it. This shit is manipulative and shouldn't be allowed."
