TLCsisterwives,ffsdye6,t3_eujdzh,1580179392.0,I don’t really blame her. People are horrible at paying their invoices so you gotta do what you gotta do. Tacky or not- I’m sure she doesn’t wanna be at a Lula-loss. She is essentially borrowing money to people.
BravoRealHousewives,ffb8bsh,t3_esk2j6,1579754804.0,I went and I had to get pretty drunk to endure it. She does play the bongos. The worse she sings the louder people cheer and everyone dips out early.
BravoRealHousewives,fet82z9,t3_eq7w32,1579372617.0,Maybe he is trying to remember his lines
BravoRealHousewives,feior51,t3_ep1666,1579143494.0,"I felt like she is such a successful woman- accomplished everything she puts her mind to. If you ever see her kids on IG they are the sweetest, extremely intelligent. She had to play out her divorce and Apollo’s arrest on tv. What she was fired for was dumb- housewives have been accused of much worse but they canned her. I miss that girl!"
TLCsisterwives,fe0ja3w,t3_en3xgk,1578814280.0,What if....... what if it is her home. What if Christine is actually an actresses and her home is really on a TLC set that they rent out for other films and hope nobody catches it. She’s a realtor on the side too but had a really hard time passing her test. WHAT IF YOU ARE ON TO SOMETHING. WHAT IF LOVE IS DIVIDED AND NOT MULTIPLIED. I drank too much wine tonight. Goodnight.
BravoRealHousewives,fdxwurj,t1_fdxjvjl,1578773756.0,"Lmao. I’m not gonna lie, when I get into it with someone on here I always envisioned some lady named Pam who has facial hair and hasn’t left her house in week giving me some sassy response."
dogs,fdplv3u,t1_fdpaax1,1578632277.0,Thank god for your mom. I thought I was crazy for my Frito paw theory.
dogs,fdp4hcz,t3_emfbru,1578619785.0,Ummmm I love the smell of my dog. I bathe her maybe every other week or when she rolls in something gross. She never stinks. Her paws smell like corn chips though. A snuggle session with a paw in my face made me conclude this.
dogs,fcpd5c4,t3_eiegr4,1577858973.0,Sounds like a puppy.

vanderpumprules,fc7z59z,t3_egmh5k,1577522529.0,Typically birds are suffering from blunt force trauma that hit windows/buildings- which often results in hemorrhaging of the brain. She was probably holding it with the intent of trying to save it. They often fly off and die.
