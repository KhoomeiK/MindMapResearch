StrangerThings,ffds0la,t3_esy4tg,1579827488.0,"So, looking like that is it as easy to get chicks as the dude made it seem?"
AskReddit,ffcxu50,t1_ffbbq6i,1579809512.0,More the former than the latter. But also kind of a healthy mix. Die/go away/get new priorities/move on
AskReddit,ffcphva,t1_ffbbk1e,1579804451.0,"Right???? 

So yeah I looks like I’m literally asking everyone else BUT you. we have nothing to learn from each other."
AskReddit,ffbaxdz,t1_ff31xe8,1579757943.0,Hmm....
AskReddit,ffbawvw,t1_ff33o6g,1579757928.0,Thats...not an easy mental adjustment to make
AskReddit,ffbavk7,t1_ffbaofz,1579757887.0,"This question is a social experiment of sorts. 

I was wondering how many single wholesome adults are out there doing all the adult things I can’t be bothered with/seeing how their mindset would alter if everything they thought they might ever have was denied them forever."
depression,ff20zqx,t3_eqzk3k,1579490901.0,This line of thinking is what makes me hate God or the universe or whatever.
GetMotivated,ff1yhx7,t3_eqz4w1,1579489104.0,I honestly don’t remember how long ago I crossed the bridge.
ForeverAlone,ff1yc4a,t3_er3btn,1579488994.0,"Shiiiiiiiit. I wish I had money. I could deal with being alone until the end of time. 

Having a woman would be nice though. I’m finna hit my ten year single anniversary in November I think. 

Somehow it both does and doesn’t get easier. 

It helps to have much worse things to worry about."
thewalkingdead,fetaygo,t3_eqh9uf,1579373475.0,This is akin to Homer Simpson lamenting the fattening impact of a Diet Coke
rickandmorty,fer71a1,t3_eq5qzh,1579350576.0,Good thing I’m aware that any pause in the universe being its usual shitty self is temporary AF.
FearTheWalkingDead,fer605l,t3_eqctgt,1579350292.0,"That’s stupid. How would you know the situation is dire without grey filter in every episode?

Also, I always thought diverse scenery was overrated. It’s a lot easier to help people if you stay in one place."
ForeverAlone,felki8b,t3_ep9cuv,1579224361.0,"Honestly I’d like to have a woman....but then what?

I’m shit at sex, have no money, sleep on an air mattress that thanks to my luck usually springs a hole once a week. 

Logistically....where would you even put a woman?"
ForeverAlone,felkcby,t3_epanps,1579224250.0,"No shit. 

I, for one,

- am muted, literally, can’t interact w  myself nearly as much
- am  horrible at connecting w most people, so im always on the outside of the circle, party, group chat, 
- have had an incarceration level sheltered childhood...so my comfort zone is narrow
- was left behind by the world that should’ve been, and am never more alone than when looking at everyone else living in the world they’re meant to be in"
AskReddit,fekd49r,t3_epj100,1579197540.0,Help me
ForeverAlone,fejvp59,t1_fejht4f,1579186932.0,"Ah. Surprisingly, I guess, I do have a few of those. They’re basically all online though. 

If that counts I think it helps to be really good at video games."
ForeverAlone,fejvh7t,t1_fejaqs8,1579186788.0,"I have no idea why I got thumbed down for that (or presumably this). I mean shit this is supposed to be “forever alone” right? 

Excuse me for assuming harsh truths were par for the course here. 

It’s just fact. If anything it should make you all feel better about yourselves. There’s nothing inherently wrong with you. You’re just unlucky as fuck. 

Your character might have stealth, guile, a positive moral alignment...but your attractiveness is low, your social points are low. Sorry. 

Like what, do you think I’m not in the same boat?"
