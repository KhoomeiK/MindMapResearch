xboxone,ffcj8q2,t1_ffc4dgn,1579800633.0,"It's essentially a rendering technique so yes anything that is rendered can use it including images and video. For instance in my field we do 3D models of buildings we design where our output will be a 30x42 printed image that we make for a client. So that image can be rendered with standard techniques or you can use a ray tracing renderer to get a more realistic look to the image. Then you print it out on nice glossy or matte paper and it basically just makes it look more photorealistic with not just shadows but also light and reflections, especially reflections because current techniques basically fake reflections where as ray tracing gets them very accurate."

HumansBeingBros,ffcez6i,t1_ffce34a,1579798023.0,What human? What human was sitting in the back yard tied up to a pole in the rain while he was working? You're the one full of assumptions here and you're still a hypocrite.

Edit: Well I ran both of the VR tests for Windows and Steam and it said I'm VR ready. I hate you guys but thanks! I really hope I have enough ports for this thing.

Edit 2: Just checked which VR games I have available on Steam, of course Elite Dangerous, but also Dirt Rally 2.0 and Project Cars 2. I didn't even realize these had VR versions. My body is ready!"

politics,ff7y0jh,t1_ff7t2hb,1579661052.0,I don't think I'd ever want a place with a HOA but the way things are I might be forced to look for a condo instead of a house. What exactly would I be looking for in one of their financial statements? Does it say their debt and money in the bank usually?
science,ff7xoz7,t1_ff7wu8z,1579660828.0,It really depends. After smoking for a long time I have zero dreams. Then I stop and the dreams come back vividly. After not smoking for a long time I stop having dreams again. Then I smoke again and the dreams come back vividly. It's weird.

Surface,ff21b8l,t3_eqz6dx,1579491132.0,"The difference for the surface dock might be having the 15"" version with the 1060. I'd love to have a dock like that but I'm not willing to take a chance for it to not actually charge it sufficiently. I do tend to do some gaming on it so it's just not worth the hassle. I don't have an external monitor at the moment so it's not really an issue but eventually I hope the come out with an upgraded dock."

buildapcsales,ff1xf3o,t1_ff1nx4p,1579488372.0,Good for external drives for consoles too. Better than an actual external drive that usually goes for almost $300.

PS4,ff0tbpd,t1_fezsp8y,1579472061.0,The first and easiest thing I'd recommend doing is just blow really hard into the thumb stick cavity. I know it sounds dumb but it has fixed issues with my controller before and it costs nothing. Getting dust in there causes problems. If that doesn't work then you can move on to more expensive fixes.
