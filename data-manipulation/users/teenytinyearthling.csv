lotr,ffcp2a7,t1_ffcjp6p,1579804172.0,"Thank you so much for your respond and confirming it was never in the books. I’ve been trying to make sense of how I have had this made-up scene in my head all these years, and I think you’re right in that I somehow extrapolated it from the psychic Frodo chapters. Thank you again :)"
