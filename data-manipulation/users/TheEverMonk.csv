ElderScrolls,ffbcoh6,t1_ff94521,1579759812.0,"A lot of people say this, but it's never specified one way or the other. If you ask someone from a caravan why they aren't allowed in cities they say ""they do not trust us."" Us could mean the caravans or khajiit. If we consider the treatment of Argonians, and how very few Argonian or Khajiit are found inside cities, perhaps it's a general prejudice towards Beast Folk rather than an actual law.

Edit, either way, I think it would have made the game far more interesting if your racial choice had more impact other than npc dialogue and starting perks. Certain holds would be OK with elves but not khajiit and so on."

They are allowed in Riften... Unless it's the trade caravan, then they have to stay outside like everywhere else."

fantasywriters,fexejfk,t3_eqlnh1,1579429706.0,"This reminds me of elfs of Folklore. In Folklore elfs (as opposed to Fantasy Elves) are akin to fairies, goblins and the like. Despite their godlike powers, they are to be placated rather than worshiped. They are responsible for luck, both good and bad. After Europe became Christian they became childrens stories.

If your Elves have been gone for so long, they too would have become Fairytales. Common names for elfs were The Old Ones, The Little Folk, The Fey.

Further, in regards to your hybrids, people who believed in elfs and fairies often blamed physical and mental disabilities in babies on the Fey. They were not their babies, they were switched out with some hobgoblin's baby. They were Changlings. It was often an excuse to treat the disabled with disdain. In your world, these Hybrids, those who exhibit elf-like features, might be similarly mistreated.

This has been a long winded way of saying ""Fey Folk"" for the Elves and ""Changlings"" for the Hybrids."

The Empire will have lost two of it's greatest warrior nations and cut it off by land from a third. Once they have Cyrodiil, they could easily take a handful of small independent nations."

To people saying there are no tropes to avoid, I disagree. Yes, you can use a trope in an original way, but that doesn't mean that most aren't played out. I'm a new writer trying to get some tips, not subvert the genre."
