politics,ffg2chz,t1_ffftcal,1579896947.0,"National healthcare and mandated prices kind of go hand in hand. Few countries would be willing to accept responsibility for providing medical care for all citizens without some measure of control over prices, to prevent the inevitable price-hikes. Whether it’s mandated prices or just collective bargaining, it’s part of the reason national health care proposals are calculated to save money. 

As for preventative care, I don’t seem to be explaining myself clearly. Emergency rooms treat everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. People who can’t afford the preventative care that stops them from needing a trip to the emergency room will still end up in an emergency room. They just won’t be able to afford the bill (part of why medical feet make up such a huge portion of bankruptcies). These people aren’t saving their money for emergency care, they can’t afford either preventative or emergency care. It’s just that emergency care is given even if they can’t afford it. 

Since hospitals aren’t free, that means if the people using the emergency room can’t pay for them, then at the end of the day the rest of us do. So if my money (either through taxes or through the high cost of my insurance) is subsidizing emergency care either way, it’s cheaper for me if I’m subsidizing the preventative care that reduces the emergencies from happening."
politics,fffs5qj,t1_fffpbcw,1579890623.0,"Insulin and other drugs are cheaper in Canada because they have a group that mandates prices of patented drugs within the country (from manufacturer to wholesaler) and peg increases in prices to increases in other consumer goods. Insulin in America has tripled in price since 2007, insulin in Canada has not.

A possible downside to this is that the less money pharmaceutical companies make, the less they have to plow into R&D. But that (to me) is a case of socializing costs but privatizing profits. If our increased drug costs are going into pharmaceutical R&D, then the profits should be returning to us, not just the products. 

As for the education aspect, how does education help when you can’t afford the preventative care to begin with? A good chunk of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and do not have the ability to cover even their deductible for anything less than a complete emergency. Which means you don’t go to the doctor when your shoulder is sore from tendinitis, you go to the emergency room after your tendon snaps. You don’t get medication to lower your blood pressure, you go to the emergency room to treat your heart attack. It’s penny wise and pound foolish, to borrow an expression from across the pond."
politics,fffmyih,t1_fffa1o8,1579887432.0,"The two things missing in your calculations are emergencies and costs. Or rather, your calculations are correct but your assumptions are wrong. 

Preventative care cuts down dramatically on emergencies. When people can come in to a hospital when they have a nagging bad cough, they don’t end up in the emergency room with pneumonia. Emergency rooms will always treat everyone, regardless of their ability to pay, regardless of what medical system we have. That’s the price we pay for a society where we don’t step over dead people on our way into the hospital. So reducing the amount of people needing emergency care is a great way of reducing the overall cost of healthcare. 

The other faulty assumption is assuming prices remain the same. But it’s very unlikely that would be the case. Insulin is roughly 1/10 the cost in Canada as it is in America. Other drugs are cheaper as well. A national healthcare plan can reduce costs in ways we can’t achieve with our current system."

If you genuinely think that both sides are so close that Trump is no worse than any other candidate, or refusing to vote unless the candidate is perfect, not just better, then I doubt you’ll ever see change. 

Was the ACA perfect? No. It was watered down and compromised. But are there people alive today who wouldn’t have been able to receive health care without it? Yes. 

If you want to sit and wait while things fall apart, hoping that when things get bad enough there will be a dramatic shift, that’s your prerogative. But if you feel that strongly that Bernie is the only candidate worth voting for, I hope you’re at least donating or volunteering for his campaign. 

And I really still think you should listen to what he has to say if he doesn’t win the nomination. If you trust him enough to be your leader, you should at least consider taking his advice in that situation. Back in 16, Bernie didn’t think that Clinton and Trump were equivalent so it didn’t matter who people voted for. Do you really think you’ve got a better grasp on politics than he does?"
politics,ffd8wvp,t1_ffcztlw,1579815725.0,"It’s interesting that you say both parties are the same and talked about the one thing that wasn’t on my list of reasons why they aren’t. The democrats and republicans have the same amount of blood on their hands in the Middle East (and beyond), and I (knowing that) would never list that as a reason to pick one or the other. Although I would point out that Obama’s actions with Iran are quite a bit different from Trump’s. Still though, neither are bloodless and neither were getting us out of there. 

But healthcare? Do you not see a difference between a party that fights to put the ACA in place vs one that spends all its efforts to tear it down without ever even having a replacement in mind? Taxes? Do you think Clinton (had she been elected) would have decided a corporate tax break is what the country needed a couple of years ago? LGBTQ? Do you think there is a single democrat who would have tried to ban all trans people from military service? Environment? Obama joined the Paris Accords, do you think any democratic candidate would have pulled us out? Hell, do any democratic candidates deny climate change is real?

Also (while I’m rooting for Bernie myself) since you seem to hold Sanders in high regard, what do you think he would tell you to do in November if he doesn’t get the democratic nomination? Why do you think Sanders endorses Hillary after he lost back in 2016?

There is an old saying that “even Hercules can’t fight two”. It’s not quite as true in the Innsworld, particularly if you have skills for defense rather than offense, but numbers still matter. Klbkch was a major disadvantage by not being able to move like Ksmvr could, without abandoning Erin.

truegaming,ff3ldpd,t3_erayg8,1579543518.0,"It’s funny you say that. I actually prefer the first few hours of Final Fantasy games to how they are several hours in. Especially with 15, but going back as far as 6 and 7. The intro story and first few missions are usually far more gripping to me. In FF7 I liked the Midgar sections more than the rest of the game, in FF8 the first couple of SEED missions were fun and I didn’t start losing interest until after the assassination attempt on the sorceress. 

I find Final Fantasy games better at ideas and concepts than they are at conclusions. The plots get out of hand and the side missions keep detracting from the main plot themes. In 15 your fun road trip gets sidetracked when your kingdom is attacked and your father killed... so after a brief pause you go back to inane side missions like collecting frogs and buying groceries for people. Opening acts tend to have more tension. 

For games that don’t get good until you sink in a few hours, I’d say most Borderlands games. You don’t unlock powers until level 5, which means that the intro is almost always a slog. And some classes take longer than that before their powers start to come good."

No need to compare yourself against Anne Frank, but you can certainly compare other young Jewish-German girls against her and realize that some of them were far luckier than she was. In that same way, Bill Gates was luckier that many of his peers. And family/connections are a huge part of that luck."

But if Bill Gates had been born in a family of sharecroppers in rural Georgia rather than to a wealthy attorney (father) and successful business woman who was friends with the CEO of IBM, do you think the same amount of hard work would have made Microsoft successful?"

The Pro 2 has a longer range, takes higher resolution photos and video, can take photos in RAW, video in D-Log, and will be more stable in stronger winds (drone stability and mass are somewhat related). It also has a variable aperture lens, which allows a lot more flexibility for lighting conditions. And it has a large array of sensors to prevent it crashing. 

But if you aren’t ever going to edit and color correct your videos, or watch them on anything bigger than your phone; if you aren’t going to print your photos, then few of those factors mean anything to you. And if the lack of need to register your drone (especially in countries where drones over 250g need you to take a pilot test or carry liability insurance) and the ease of portability mean more to you, then the Mavic Mini is probably the way to go."

Most people seem to assume that other people are more or less like themselves. Most people also never want to think of themselves as actually being a bad person. So if they want to do something that’s bad (cheat on their spouse, renege on a contract, steal, lie, etc), they will convince themselves that everyone else is either also doing these things, or that those who don’t are either too dumb or too weak to do it. 

And that’s the root of projection. Trump knew that if he was president, he would do anything to stay in office. So, since he would do it, anyone else in office (like Obama) would clearly consider doing it too.
