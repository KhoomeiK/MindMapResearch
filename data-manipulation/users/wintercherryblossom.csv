You'll still have to apply like give a transcript or get recommendations or write an essay, but you'll be a visiting student because you won't be getting a degree from that school. Most likely you won't have to transfer back to your home university. You should be able to start the next semester or year without having to apply again.

A professor will usually not change the way the test is set up due to one person. Now if more than half the class is getting low grades that's a different story. They might change an 85.6 to an 86, but they are not going to give you a 100 if you got a 70. This grade is on you and how you want to retain the information. If you know how the test is structured and you know it's not your strength then you should maybe try a different studying approach."

The only thing he asked was if I'm ok with it and I didn't really care if he was ok with it. I would just make sure you're wet enough or use lube because if you are too dry it can pull the foreskin back and might hurt him. If he would want to fix it he can always get a topical cream or stretch it slowly. If he really wants to he can surgically get it fixed too.
college,ff1mg3f,t1_ff1khc1,1579481609.0,If you don't think taking a test or doing homework will be effected I would just talk to the professor before class starts and say that you are prone to passing out and seizers and for them to not be alarmed and maybe how to deal with it. I had a girl who had frequent seizures and never told the professor and everyone was confused on what to do and class eventually got cancelled for the day. After she talked to the professor it was fine and when she had it again he knew what to do and everything was fine.

I remember sitting on top of my dryer and the vibrations made me feel good. I never knew why, but it felt good. I didn't know about the clitoris or anything. I iust knew I peed out of that area. I think a lot of people know what masturbation is, is due to the internet. You feel certain things in an area that isn't talked about so you aren't comfortable asking you're parents so you ask the internet. I agree that sex ed should be taught in depth to teens because even if they do want to be abstinent they should know how to have sex safely once they become sexually active."

Getting a GED/high school diploma/taking the SAT depends on the college and state you live in.

I suggest enrolling in CC then talking to your advisor."

You're body also isn't used to all those hormones, or any hormones as you aren't on the pill, so it's not abnormal. You're also stressing, which can make you feel like you have symptoms, but you don't have them."
sex,fet8qxc,t3_eqjtc0,1579372830.0,"Depending on your flow it is very unlikely you would ovulate this early in your cycle, if your period is 23-30 days consistantly. You also took Plan B, which makes it even more unlikely. Taking Plan B can give you symptoms similiar to pregnancy due to the amount of hormones you just took. Plan B is essential the birth control pill on steriods. It has a high amount of hormones which can cause cramping, spotting, nausea, etc. Your period may also be late or you may skip it all together, your period may also be messed up for a while, this is again due to the hormones you took. I wouldn't stress, I know that's hard though. Try to focus on something else. The more you focus on it and look up symptoms the more stressed you'll become, which can impact your period and make you have fake symptoms. In the future, if you want to have sex make sure you have birth control whether that be a condom, IUD, the pill, implant, etc."

I know friends who did 15 credits and worked full time, but they were on top of their stuff. If they didn't get something they would immediately go to the professor.

Strss is usually a big causer for a missed period. You're on the pill as well, which can do wacky things to your body no matter how long you've been on it. I would say go to an ob/gyn or your primary doctor because it can be an underlying medical issue that is mot pregnancy. Honestly though I wouldn't stress too much over it."
college,fehigmw,t3_ep6ace,1579117205.0,Yes they do track what you do on their wifi. The portability of them taking action is low.

They said an employer would rather higher someone with experience then someone with no experience, but a higher degree. You can also graduate with a lot of debt after a Bachelor's, which is common, so most want to pay it asap. Also some companies will help pay or pay for the full tuition of the Master's degree if you will stay with the compnay for so many years. You can graduate with a Bachelor's in Engineering, many of my friends are, but I heard the first year classes are hard and many companies will pay them to get their Master's. I think you don't hear of many people getting those Bachelor's degree either due to the classes being hard and they drop that major, STEM is just recently becoming big so it's still in the growing processes, and many will go for their Master's."

I debated on if I should take the next semester off, but decided against it as I felt a lot better over J-term. If your mental well being is still not in a good place I would suggest against it. Focus on yourself and maybe go to a therapist if you need to, I did and it helped a lot. I don't think anyone will judge you, especially your friends.

I would say it helped me because I knew I was in control. It wasn't another person determining how much goes in or how fast, it was me. Her being anxious is definitely making her tighter though and making her feel pain. I would let her take some deep breathes and try to relax her body.

If you're seriously not happy with your current college I would transfer. Yes, the classes may be harder, but if you think you can do it I would. Not getting a 4.0 gpa isn't the end all and is definitely over exaggerating the importance of a gpa. In my opinion, if you can maintain at minimum a 3.5 gpa you seem to be doing well for yourself."

sex,fe5bwej,t3_entzul,1578867452.0,"If you're unsure there's always Plan B, albeit it's pricey, ~$40. Precum can have trace amounts of sperm, but thats still debated. It's also 5 days before her period so her egg mostly likely has already dropped and disappeared, assuming her cycle is almost perfect everytime. Even with all this, I would still advise her to take Plan B. By taking Plan B she can miss her period due to the amound of hormones going into her body. She also might experience spotting. This doesn't mean she's pregnant. If she missed her period have her take a pregnancy test, but remind her this is normal to miss her period while in Plan B. Her cycle might also get messed up for a bit too."
sex,fe5a8ph,t3_enu0cg,1578866975.0,"My stomach hurts and I get cramps after sex too. When I saw my ob/gyn she said nothing was wrong. The vagina expands and the cervix lifts up a bit when aroused. The pain I felt afterwards was due to the cervix not lifting up and him hitting it, which in turn made me cramp. This can also happen in certain positions. Orgams can also cause cramps and stomach pain due to the muscle contractions. You said you're around 7in, which is pretty big so it's not suprising she feels some stomach pain afterwards; you're most likely hitting her cervix. If it is something that is very common and happens almost everytime after sex, I would see a doctor and/or ob/gyn just to make sure nothing seriously is wrong."

sex,fe3a7v8,t1_fe34t35,1578847430.0,"However, you still cannot say it's 100% pee as the chemicals produced in the gland can still be expelled along with the fluid due to where it is in the body, although it can be 100% pee as explained below. As some say that it's there to help the urethra become clean if bacteria due to it producing a urinary protein. Some say it can produce ejaculation chemicals similiarly found in semen, PSA. That's also why some people call it the female prostate due to the chemicals it produces. Also the size of the skene's is even debated so if it's bigger it could produce liquid. Squirting also can be a small amount to a big amount. Some people say they squirt less than half a cup others report up to half a gallon, this can be explained probably why below. One researcher did find that the chemicals in squirting were different from the chemicals in pee. In the study in the previous comment, 2 produced 100% pee chemically the 5 produced small amounts of PSA. Some will only release PSA, which as you said is a small amount of liquid, but some consider it squirting; which also brings in is squirting and female ejaculation different some people think it's the same some don't. Scientists catagorize squirting and female ejaculation as two seperate things, but society mostly see's it as the same thing, which isnt scientifically accurate."

Some say its comes from the skene's gland, which surrounds the urethra. A study showed that women who had full bladders during/before sex and squirted had empty bladders after sex; gratef this study did have a small pool of subjects. Some think that the fluid in squirting is so powerful and so much it has to at least have trace amounts of pee while others say the fluid is produced 100% by the skene's gland. Other's say it squirts out so powerfully due to the high pressure the skene's gland is under during an orgasm."

It's been almost a year since we started and nothings has gone wrong and we're still as close as before. I would suggest make sure you communicate. With anything communication is key. I have told him I might be catching feelings so could we stop and he said yes because he understood. I got my emotions and life intact and we started again. I would talk more about it to her, especially if you're unsure about it, and what you both want out of it.

Oh also community college has a honors society called phi theta kappa(?) and you have to be completing 12 or more credits and have a 3.5 gpa or above to be accepted and I heard 4 year schools give out decent scholarships for that. Also check out any internship or co-op or research opportunities. Usually they pay pretty well and you can make money while studying in your field of interest."
college,fe2o4xu,t3_ennr3x,1578841083.0,"For me personally, my parents saved for years. My parents started to save in the 1980s-1990s and didn't get me, I'm adopted, until 2001-2002. This helped a lot for college as I could go 4 years without debt or >5K of debt. On the other hand, this basically made me ineligible for FAFSA, government grants; my parents income also had a part. While applying to college, I was lucky enough to get a hefty sum of merit money from my college as well. On the side, I work part-time/on-call as a CNA, certified nursing assistant, and make decent money to spend on the side. 

My friends have either FAFSA supporting about half or a little less of their education on top of their own savings and scholarships. Some took out loans with a co-sign from their parents and will have debt going out. 

If money is really tight I suggest going to Community College. A lot of Community Colleges have deals with 4 year colleges in surrounding areas and depending on how well you do in community you may be able to get merit money on top of FAFSA. For example, my local community college has a plan with Temple University that if you graduate with at least a 2.5 GPA, maybe 3.0 GPA I forget, you will get some merit money and be directly admitted for their bachelors program. Some also have concurrent programs where you can get your associates while your getting your bachelors. So you would take some classes at community and some at the 4 year school and you will only get billed for the classes you take at each."

It also depends on your prerequisites. Some colleges will give you the 30-40(?) credits since you have an ADN, but some will ask for specific classes that will have to transfer over for credits. It can be easier to also get into a RN-BSN course compared to going straight into a BSN course or transfering into one; this also depends on the college and where you live of course. My mom only got her ADN and RN then went back to school for her BSN. As for me, I went straight for my BSN. I would say getting your ADN will be more cost efficient, but it doesn't mean you'll be able to make it into a BSN program since you have to still apply to colleges. I would say if you're getting your ADN and RN before your BSN to keeo your grades up in an A to B range and keep your prerequisites in the A range; again these grades can be lenient depending on the college."

In high school people from ages 14-18 are socializing, or at least in the same space. I had a friend who was 18 and took a 15 (or 16 I don't remember) to our prom. He liked her at the beginning of the year, which would make her 15. We all didn't care as we knew the girl and she was a good friend with some of us. What we told him is don't do anything because you can have legal trouble. You sound like the guys I'm friends with when they were in high school. In my opinion, it seems like a very common thing. When you have a lot of teens together who are socializing feelings and relationships will happen. This isn't me diagnosing you, as I assume many people here aren't either, but more just giving my opinion."
college,fc68sjv,t3_egevcc,1577474903.0,"What I like do is take one set of notes in class. These notes are transcriptions of the slides and the lectures. Along with transcribing I will highlight or star certain things that are important. After class, I then rewrite the notes into a more condensed version and into my own words. If there is something I don't understand I try to look in the textbook, at past notes, or online. One I do that I write down what I found on a piece of paper and go to my professor to confirm I understood everything correctly.

Choose a format for your notes. I found this to be really helpful. I have a header, which is usually the main topic of the lecture, and then subheaders, which are branching topics. I like to highlight vocab words and write the most important things in a different colour. I also like to make my notes neat, and pretty like the study grams, because reading them over is easier and makes me want to look at them.

Timing is important too. For me I do the pomodoro, which I believe is 25min study 5 min break, but I do 1hr study 20min break. This can be adjustable with each class and how long you think you can study for at a time. Also study smart. You can do an 1hr of nonefficient studying and 30min of efficient studying and the 30min will have a better outcome. I like to interact with my work by making original analogies and teaching other people. While teaching other people I almost act as the professor. I encourage them to ask questions and to make me explain things more in depth. Also don't cram. Try to give yourself room for questions and to study at your own pace. This is also because staying up late for tests isn't good.

If there's any practice problems do those again and again until you feel confident. Make notes on what you dont know and go to your professor for help on those."
