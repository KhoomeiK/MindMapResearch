totalwar,fgpd86r,t1_fgnj6jg,1581002433.0,Handwaving is not how you build an aesthetically consistent franchise that has such mass appeal as warhammer does. Handwaving only works when the author can't quite find the loreful explanation to tie together a cool thing that is aesthetically consistent. Handwaving is NOT the means to put whatever random feature within a setting.
totalwar,fgmjyyf,t1_fglrt63,1580926109.0,People's opposition to stormfiends stems entirely from the AoS/40k connotations and visual design. There would be almost 0 opposition to them if they followed vermintide's footsteps and created a more low tech/stitched together/less form fitting armor version.
totalwar,fgmjqqy,t1_fglfjc3,1580925973.0,">His point is that people are willing to accept some completely implausible concepts only to reject others that make no more or less sense than each other.

Except for the fact they actually do make more or less sense in relation to each other. That's the crux of the issue. People with lesser understanding of thematic consistency opining that a hamster wheel of death is no less unbelievable than a flying griffon chariot, when in universe it is entirely believable the skaven create that given their technology, motivations and dispositions, whereas the Lothern Skycutter completely defies the internal consistency on the utility of magic within the setting and aesthetic design of the race as a whole."
totalwar,fgmj35m,t1_fgliy98,1580925590.0,The main opposition is driven by the AoS/40k aesthetic design of the stormfiend. It doesn't fit in universe with that visual design. It could work if they followed a vermintide paradigm and designed it to be visually lower tech/more stitched together/less form fitting plates.
totalwar,fgmirgv,t1_fgm67ar,1580925401.0,"No, they actually don't fit. Because why stop at a floating chariot? In universe it doesn't make sense. It's a different application and degree of magic than the rest of the setting that sticks out like a sore thumb. 

Take for example Skyrim, there's a transmutation spell in that game, turns iron into gold. Why is there even an economy in universe when a spell like that exists? Gold would become worthless within a week. Same internal logic principles with Skycutters. If enchanting a pretty unimpactful chariot is worth it, surely they'd use that magical technology everywhere. Why do the high elves not have flying ships? Why don't they have jetpack infantry?

You can't just look at the outward visual manifestation of something and use it as a metric for silliness, since silly is contextual."
totalwar,fgmhwm5,t1_fgm9rc8,1580924899.0,"Because the skaven are characterised correctly and fit into the correct psychological archetype for what their outward appearances suggest. The skaven are cowardly, conniving, evil, selfish, completely lacking in virtue. They follow tropes associated with the archetypal rat (even if the real world rat isn't at all like the historical archetype).

This manifests into all the outwardly ""silly"" aspects. Such as preponderance to janky technology, cartoon villain level scheming and backstabbing and backfiring, and weird (for the universe) levels of technology. All these things are believable within the context of the race.  

The rule is that the outward manifestation of a fantasy race should match the archetypes it's trying to emulate, and the skaven's ""silly"" aspects are reasonable representations of characteristics defined within the race.  

It works because it has a reasonable translation into the setting. It is 100% believable and cool that crazy evil cunning rat people make a hamster wheel of death. It is much less believable that halflings would fight with soup, to the point they'd retrofit a steam tank to fire soup. What's the reason for soup? Because halflings are associated with food. That's not a good enough reason to take it from silly to cool because it still doesn't have an in universe reason why they'd use soup over boiling oil.

There may be a way to make Halflings work within the context of the series, but there's almost no way it'd not deviate heavily from every other race. They'd distinctly not be badass, they necessarily have to be silly, they would have to tell a narrative of a lucky/quirky faction bumbling their way through a war and somehow winning due to luck and novelty, where a column of serious warriors is ambushed by a cavalry charge of giant chicken cavalry with accordion music playing in the background as the column breaks down due to unlucky circumstances like ammunition exploding randomly or a fellow marching soldier turning around in surprise and accidentally hitting his ally with his weapon."
totalwar,fgmfvc4,t3_ez59pf,1580923701.0,"In universe silliness vs out of universe silliness are different things. Distinguish between them. Giant hamster wheels are cool, because in universe it makes sense. Spinning attack swordsman and temple guard chucking their halberds as if that is regular in universe combat doctrine is a different thing.

Now when people say halflings are silly they almost universally mean in the sense that having an empire of them would be silly, or entire armies of them (since in universe they are mostly auxiliary type units at best). Unless they reinvent the entire archetype of halfling it'd be impossible to take seriously. It is a much different thing to imagine a one time battle where one unit riding giant chickens comes over the ridge to change the course of history, there's a certain charm to that. But having the entire campaign revolve around that would mean the entire race and tone of the campaign would actually have to revolve around being silly. Which may or may not fit within the context of the game at large.

Vampire Coast worked and were not silly because people didn't by and large conceptualise them properly before the launch trailer. People didn't conceptualise them as fitting into the pirates of the carribean archetype and thus couldn't see the inherent coolness of them and niche within the setting.

Here's a good method for distinguishing the legitimacy of ""it would be too silly"" claims. If they've presented the concept in good faith and it still doesn't make sense in universe or out then there's a good chance it's too silly."
Futurology,fgimxuc,t3_ey63g3,1580826127.0,"Elephant and the rider. You have to as an individual be capable of distinguishing between what you feel and what you think. They are not the same thing. Your ideological predisposition that raises an emotional reaction when challenged or supported is not de-facto true. 

That being said the willingness to accept expertise on a given politicised issue is not really an insightful metric. The bottom line comes down to ideology, and whether a purported expert's claims line up to yours. In all likelihood a more insightful claim is that these factors contribute to one's ideology, and they may shape the perception of experiences that lead to forming an ideology and world view."

Never once seen this guy represent anything related to animal rights in good faith."
KotakuInAction,fghtxth,t3_extmmq,1580793773.0,"You guys understand that he's not 100% responsible for every single ban and happenstance on his platform right? He grew up around lefties and had the general lefty opinions that grow there. The seemingly benign ""oh well I guess we can make an exception for hate speech"" and ""freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequence"" psuedo justifications for putting limits on speech. So policy is shaped in accordance to that. Upon seeing the consequences of that a sensible person realigns their position to better fit reality having seen the consequnces of it. Seeing the results of it, having talked to many people and having had to answer to the U.S government as well as getting older have given him both perspective and wisdom. 

Almost certainly this isn't conspiratorial ""oh he sees the republicans are gonna win 2020 so he's changing his tune"" (pro tip he had the last 4 years to do that) or that he's feeling the burn of his opinions getting censored. Perspective comes from exposure to the consequence of action and if you followed Zuck at all you'd know he generally follows through on his promises and says what he means. 

The likelihood of this being a genuine statement of intent with no underhandedness is orders of magnitude more likely than the reverse and you're a conspiratorial fool to think otherwise."

I've bought every blizzard game since warcraft 2 besides WoW. There have been clear trends of a downward spiral for many years now, I only put up with their terrible behaviour because ultimately their games were reasonably polished and good against all my cathartic hopes. They have ruined their reputation with me utterly and I will not be buying their games for the foreseeable future."
todayilearned,fflofe8,t1_fflmetv,1580042107.0,"He has a doctorate in psychology, he's just not a licensed therapist. He IS more qualified by a country mile, then sends people off to be helped by people who are licensed. The 15 minutes you see on air is not the help they get. It's 15 minutes, you can't help someone in that little time. The 15 minutes is for the audience and helps viewers more than anything.

The world would be an objectively worse place without Dr.Phil, whereas it'd probably be better without bum fights."
todayilearned,ffllfzv,t1_fflgva0,1580041069.0,"No, Dr.Phil is not a bad person by ANY means. He offers state of the art help at his own expense to all guests in the form of personalised therapists and retreats that are much more effective than rehab and available to people not able to pay for therapy. 

That's only a drop in the bucket compared to the absolutely massive number of people he's helped vicariously in the form of motivation and impetus to change their life in the form of viewers. People see a microcosm of how to approach dialogue and self improvement and carry those lessons into their own life.

The 15 minute therapy is not really for the guest, that's for the viewers. The guest gets help outside of the show."
todayilearned,fflgnkt,t3_eu0ngc,1580039501.0,"What terrible cynical people you all are. No, helping people through monetising people's natural curiousity is not the same as what Bum Fights does. Helping people with the cost a light is shone on the subject is not the same as dangling a pittance that a desperate person would be hard pressed to ignore and monetising that desperation.

Dr.Phil is under no obligation to have any team or vetting whatsoever and if he were actually to the level of exploitation of Bum fights he'd save a ton of money by not actually supporting guests at all.

If you think these two people are genuinely at all on the same level morally you really are not good at any moral valuation whatsoever and you need to rethink your values because you're likely a bad person."
totalwar,ffgkcv2,t3_esw4wf,1579908229.0,Yeah battle difficulty increases are the incorrect way to make your game harder. 2 unbuffed stacks is infinitely more interesting and just as challenging to fight as 1 buffed stack. Go with legendary campaign difficulty and at most hard battle difficulty.
BobsTavern,ffa0d5g,t1_ff7c3qh,1579725330.0,It's asynchronous. What you're doing to your opponent's avatar is not representative of what's happening in their instance. They are fighting their own battle with their own rng against your avatar. Think of most other autobattlers and you'll understand.
BobsTavern,ff8m1uu,t3_es19yx,1579685195.0,"It's basically just like every other autobattler where the damage you do in your instance isnt important. The damage you do to an opponent is based on how much damage your avatar did in their instance.

The only real bug this can present is you can technically draw. The game is by no means unplayable atm and things are going correctly and nothing bullshit is going on, it's just asynchronous"
pics,ff4hqpe,t1_ff4gche,1579563905.0,"You're wrong or mislead on multiple counts. It's not a relevant or intelligent point to assert that you can't grow the same types of crops everywhere, the types of crops that are smart to be grown in a certain region are grown there. Meat cannot grow anywhere grass grows. The majority of food for livestock is not grass. Do you actually know the disparity between land/agriculture devoted to livestock versus purely human consumtion? The VAST majority is livestock, with some estimates going so far as a 80/20 split. You knock out livestock and you could reduce resources required by 50% easily. It's a dumb stance for you to take as the numbers simply are so out of proportion that no reasonable minded person could say that it's a good valuation from a resource consumption standpoint.

Your pretend dick swinging isn't going to get you far when objective numbers insinuate your capacity to valuate is unrefined."

Livestock doesn't eat air. A living body is an inefficient way of storing calories and as you move up the food chain a larger and larger amount of calories are required for the same affect. The calories that would otherwise go to feeding people are going to feed inefficient and polluting bio machines. Take the agricultural resources devoted to feeding livestock and use it instead for productive means and you'll have a net reduction in agricutural waste, not more."

UpliftingNews,fehr9tt,t1_fehpxqq,1579122299.0,"That literally doesn't relate at all to what I just posited. The ideal means nothing when the reality is untenable, the ideal is not consistent with any means of getting there. The fundamental truth is ideal equality is diametrically opposed to freedom, since freedom produces unequal outcome through unequal action. Thus why every single attempt at communism results in absolute destruction of freedom. There is no such thing as a true communist even by your standards. It's circle that can't be squared, where the ideal conflicts with reality to the point you have one type of theoretical communist with no means to arrive at equality, and the practical form of communist who will use state power to enforce equality and thus violate many freedoms. It's easy to see why most communists end up in the latter distribution."
UpliftingNews,fehp3fc,t1_fehksl6,1579121045.0,"Of course that's what he's saying. It doesn't matter when 90% of professed communists are heavily for gun control. 

I wholeheartedly disagree with the second part of your statement. If I construct a theory that says I can and will walk through walls, I don't later get to claim that it'd have worked if my atoms were aligned perfectly and the theory just wasn't implemented properly. The consequences of the reality contradicting the idealistic theoretical outcome is NOT an inferrence that communism just wasn't done properly or they weren't doing communism. Communism succeeded every single time, because the abject poverty and suffering is the absolute result of communism."
gaming,feho14v,t1_fehjyzs,1579120431.0,"I don't share any of your values in this situation. As someone who grew up through the worst the internet has to offer it's not a big deal. The constant psychological pressure of self censorship though of maybe being banned or kicked from a game due to absolutely unacceptably draconian language filters is the wrong way to go about this perceived problem of yours. When someone can't say the word spicy because it has the word spic in it or assassin because it contains the word ass it's like, stop, you've gone WAY too far.

If someone is going to type ""nijjer"" or something equally ludicrious to get around a filter for the purpose of communicating an idea that is supposed to insult or make me uncomfortable, then let them, the suppression of the exact combination of letters to make words you restrict people from using is honestly the most clownish endeavor.
