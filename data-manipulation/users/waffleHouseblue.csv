gaming,ff3jtp7,t3_epmk42,1579542571.0,"Seeing the quality of the products that CDPR has released, and how they have a consistent record of releasing a product that is complete, satisfying, and worth every cent paid, this is more reassuring than anything. Give a company like CDPR a few extra months to polish their product, and it will be worth the wait. Especially with the past couple of years having shown that developers are more than willing to shove out a half finished product with the promise of ""patching it later"", it's refreshing to see some of these developers lately announcing delays to take the time necessary to actually finish and polish their games before release. Thank you CDPR, for having respect for your players, and the integrity to actually put the proper care into making your product the best it can be."
