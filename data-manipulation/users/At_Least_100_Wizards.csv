I think two things are weird about the visual direction for this, though:

- One is that the ""[eldritch](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/eldritch?s=t) horror"" is even a direction that anyone associated with Volibear at all. This seems very visually/thematically foreign compared to what I consider to be Volibear. To me the champion is a great and proud beast, the type to enforce order and smite the wicked. This plays against themes of chaos and dissonance which are typically associated with the eldritch.

- Two, I find it strange that those conceptual art pieces are considered ""eldritch horror"". Typically, the visual design is much stranger for things of such a name. **<<Graphic art warning>>** When I think eldritch horror, I think of something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/gNygD18.jpg) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/JZjfsiA.jpg) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/tEEco4q.jpg). It's supposed to be reminiscent of things not able to be truly understood by human beings, as if looking into another dimension or beholding the work of some ancient god with motives you couldn't possibly fathom. What they showed doesn't really remind me of that.

I'm probably just being pedantic, but these just struck me as strange considerations for both the community and Riot. If they wanted to take him in the direction of the ancient and shamanistic, as if looking upon an unfathomably old god of a holy forest a la *Princess Mononoke*, and like, the Elderwood skin line, that's one thing. But making him scary doesn't feel like Volibear at all, to me."

Games,fdmev54,t1_fdksnxd,1578547594.0,"While I agree that Wargroove is overall lackluster, I wouldn't call it watered down Advance Wars. There are definitely some interesting aspects of this game like ""critical strike conditions"" for units, which help shape your tactics, and the fact that you even get a commander unit at all (didn't exist in Advance Wars).

I definitely agree that the factions not having inherent differences was a HUGE mistake. It makes for grindy symmetrical missions with low decision making and sudden win or loss based on someone's commander being bursted down out of nowhere. Rather than forcing you to avoid certain strategies and take advantage of others. Instead of interesting unit trades in Advance Wars' asymmetrical armies, using counters and counter-counters, Wargroove is all about out-sieging, healing, commander abuse, and attrition.

The soundtrack is fine, not great, just fine. There is a theme or two that I think are pretty cool, but games like this really need something catchy that you can bob to through long strategic missions - every time. Good tunes make the long missions of these tactical strategy games feel more fun instead of like a slog, so in that sense I think that the soundtrack isn't quite there. It is, however, fine.

I'm surprised you didn't mention the other most egregious issues, which are poor map design (maps don't play to commander strengths or weaknesses; maps are often way too big), and appearance of new enemy units from offscreen (no strategic integrity)."
Games,fdmc3ra,t1_fdknfgm,1578545215.0,"Wargroove actually has MORE mechanics, but just utilizes its tools poorly. Advance Wars never had critical attacks or commander units, and definitely has fewer unit types. The two things that make all the difference, though, are that 1. Advance Wars maps are constructed very well comparatively, and 2. Wargroove factions don't have meaningful passive changes to their armies and don't have tactical advantages and disadvantages, which makes characters and armies less pronounced and makes missions forgettable, with less differences in strategy all-around."

Right now Ricky Gervais is plastered all across the top and front page of the sub just because he talked about not wanting people to talk politics at the golden globes.

You'll notice, that last aspect, that's the real kicker here - you'll notice it a lot more these days, especially out in the real world. Trump supporters who have no real argument anymore and are now embarrassed to admit it or talk about him, are often pained to even be in conversation about politics because *they know they have no argument* and the best they can do is complain that people talk politics too much or ""oh would you just give it a rest.""

After a small review and rundown about the game and what it was about, they basically played it like ""good cop, bad cop"" where Victor, who was usually more optimistic and forgiving, would highlight and summarize the best parts of the game - and the best part about it IMO, was Tommy Tallarico and how he was absolutely unforgiving about the worst aspects of the game. Not only did he talk about things he wasn't a fan of or parts of games he didn't find fun, he also focused on those things that reviewers often don't mention, but are things you will absolutely start getting annoyed with while playing, like super repetitive and loud sound effects and voice lines, or when certain specific mechanics or levels are particularly frustrating in an otherwise fun game.

For what it's worth, my 2 cents about Origins is that I think people's opinions of it were warped by two things that HEAVILY change your game experience IMO:

- Playing on console vs. PC (the PC experience was infinitely better)

- Playing a mage vs. not playing a mage

Origins was obviously designed for PC with console as an afterthought, since the console shortcuts were awkward and couldn't even handle all of a mage's spells without getting super clunky, whereas the PC just has one long hotbar for everything at the bottom. Also, the whole ""tactical view"" zoom out made combat a lot more fun and, well, tactical. You don't feel awkward using the quick-pause feature (which you are *supposed to use*) whereas on console it doesn't feel right because of the in-your-face default view and jumpy character-switch camera.

On top of that, the imbalance of power and options between the classes also made a huge difference. Playing a mage you get to see right away there are a ton of spells with wildly different effects depending on what style you want to use. In addition to giving you more options and piquing your interest much more than the martial classes (well, for me anyway), the mage origin story gives you a lot more insight into the mage tower that so many people seem to dislike, including the Fade which I actually thought was amazing. The introduction and learning about the Fade gives you context and when you return you kind of know what you're getting into, but for non-mages it's this weird la-la-land dream sequence which feels like it makes no sense and doesn't matter. What worried me a lot was that I felt like I couldn't get my party members or my stuff back for a long time, but the actual things happening in the Fade on the mage tower return were really cool and you have the chance to gain a lot of permanent stat points. I know that lots of people don't like that part of the game but it always confused me. I'd call it a highlight of the game, it's a huge unique step away from the rest of what you're doing throughout the adventure, but again part of why I felt that way is probably because my main character was a mage and I felt like I had a lot of options and I could handle being a 1- or 2-person party temporarily. Being a warrior alone? I mean what do you do, drink 15 potions and bum rush everything?

I thought it was a design mistake to have such a disparity between the classes, it's the only game I have ever seen where your game experience and enjoyment are warped so terribly around this one decision.

People playing a warrior on console got slammed with flavors of really bad MMO mixed with really bad action game. People playing a mage on PC got a much more curated, strategic, tactical experience with a seeming emphasis on using all your party members and making the best use of your spells between all characters.

Sorry to slam you with a wall of text, just wanted to vent because I feel like Origins got a bad rap with a good number of players because the design can give you such a poor impression in certain circumstances. I honestly think that starting as a mage and playing Hard or Nightmare mode and staying zoomed-out tactical view on PC legitimately feels like you are playing a different game."

I think two things are weird about the visual direction for this, though:

- One is that the ""[eldritch](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/eldritch?s=t) horror"" is even a direction that anyone associated with Volibear at all. This seems very visually/thematically foreign compared to what I consider to be Volibear. To me the champion is a great and proud beast, the type to enforce order and smite the wicked. This plays against themes of chaos and dissonance which are typically associated with the eldritch.

- Two, I find it strange that those conceptual art pieces are considered ""eldritch horror"". Typically, the visual design is much stranger for things of such a name. **<<Graphic art warning>>** When I think eldritch horror, I think of something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/gNygD18.jpg) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/JZjfsiA.jpg) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/tEEco4q.jpg). It's supposed to be reminiscent of things not able to be truly understood by human beings, as if looking into another dimension or beholding the work of some ancient god with motives you couldn't possibly fathom. What they showed doesn't really remind me of that.

I'm probably just being pedantic, but these just struck me as strange considerations for both the community and Riot. If they wanted to take him in the direction of the ancient and shamanistic, as if looking upon an unfathomably old god of a holy forest a la *Princess Mononoke*, and like, the Elderwood skin line, that's one thing.

There are definitely some interesting aspects of this game like ""critical strike conditions"" for units, which help shape your tactics, and the fact that you even get a commander unit at all (didn't exist in Advance Wars).

I definitely agree that the factions not having inherent differences was a HUGE mistake. It makes for grindy symmetrical missions with low decision making and sudden win or loss based on someone's commander being bursted down out of nowhere. Rather than forcing you to avoid certain strategies and take advantage of others. Instead of interesting unit trades in Advance Wars' asymmetrical armies, using counters and counter-counters, Wargroove is all about out-sieging, healing, commander abuse, and attrition.

The soundtrack is fine, not great, just fine. There is a theme or two that I think are pretty cool, but games like this really need something catchy that you can bob to through long strategic missions - every time. Good tunes make the long missions of these tactical strategy games feel more fun instead of like a slog, so in that sense I think that the soundtrack isn't quite there. It is, however, fine.

I'm surprised you didn't mention the other most egregious issues, which are poor map design (maps don't play to commander strengths or weaknesses; maps are often way too big), and appearance of new enemy units from offscreen (no strategic integrity)."
Games,fdmc3ra,t1_fdknfgm,1578545215.0,"Wargroove actually has MORE mechanics, but just utilizes its tools poorly.

Advance Wars maps are constructed very well comparatively, and 2. Wargroove factions don't have meaningful passive changes to their armies and don't have tactical advantages and disadvantages, which makes characters and armies less pronounced and makes missions forgettable, with less differences in strategy all-around."

Right now Ricky Gervais is plastered all across the top and front page of the sub just because he talked about not wanting people to talk politics at the golden globes.

You'll notice, that last aspect, that's the real kicker here - you'll notice it a lot more these days, especially out in the real world.

Games,fc7k0s0,t1_fc5c2c4,1577509894.0,"I wanted to say thanks for giving what is obviously a very passionate and genuine write up about the DA series. I'd direct anyone looking to hear about these games to this comment.

For what it's worth, my 2 cents about Origins is that I think people's opinions of it were warped by two things that HEAVILY change your game experience IMO:

- Playing on console vs. PC (the PC experience was infinitely better)

- Playing a mage vs. not playing a mage

Origins was obviously designed for PC with console as an afterthought, since the console shortcuts were awkward and couldn't even handle all of a mage's spells without getting super clunky, whereas the PC just has one long hotbar for everything at the bottom. Also, the whole ""tactical view"" zoom out made combat a lot more fun and, well, tactical. You don't feel awkward using the quick-pause feature (which you are *supposed to use*) whereas on console it doesn't feel right because of the in-your-face default view and jumpy character-switch camera.

On top of that, the imbalance of power and options between the classes also made a huge difference. Playing a mage you get to see right away there are a ton of spells with wildly different effects depending on what style you want to use. In addition to giving you more options and piquing your interest much more than the martial classes (well, for me anyway), the mage origin story gives you a lot more insight into the mage tower that so many people seem to dislike, including the Fade which I actually thought was amazing. The introduction and learning about the Fade gives you context and when you return you kind of know what you're getting into, but for non-mages it's this weird la-la-land dream sequence which feels like it makes no sense and doesn't matter. What worried me a lot was that I felt like I couldn't get my party members or my stuff back for a long time, but the actual things happening in the Fade on the mage tower return were really cool and you have the chance to gain a lot of permanent stat points. I know that lots of people don't like that part of the game but it always confused me. I'd call it a highlight of the game, it's a huge unique step away from the rest of what you're doing throughout the adventure, but again part of why I felt that way is probably because my main character was a mage and I felt like I had a lot of options and I could handle being a 1- or 2-person party temporarily. Being a warrior alone? I mean what do you do, drink 15 potions and bum rush everything?

I thought it was a design mistake to have such a disparity between the classes, it's the only game I have ever seen where your game experience and enjoyment are warped so terribly around this one decision.

People playing a warrior on console got slammed with flavors of really bad MMO mixed with really bad action game. People playing a mage on PC got a much more curated, strategic, tactical experience with a seeming emphasis on using all your party members and making the best use of your spells between all characters.

Sorry to slam you with a wall of text, just wanted to vent because I feel like Origins got a bad rap with a good number of players because the design can give you such a poor impression in certain circumstances. I honestly think that starting as a mage and playing Hard or Nightmare mode and staying zoomed-out tactical view on PC legitimately feels like you are playing a different game."

Butch lady

Edgy elf

Weird elf

Turbo skank

Totally not a blood mage guys (blood mage)

and Varric the one good character.

I'm gonna go with no on this one. 2 was a disaster and I never felt compelled by most of the companions' dialogue. I wanted so badly for it to be good after playing the first one 3 times through and getting both games on release day. I have never heard of someone liking 2 the most of the 3 games until today, this is so bizarre lol..."
