Like initially she sees the true form of the Fae as monstrous and ugly, but once she develops feelings, she starts seeing his natural form as just kind of the way he looks AND she's considerably less starstruck by how hot his glamour form is as well - which I think is 100% spot on in how people and relationships work.  Everyone starts off kind of shallow, but the longer and deeper the relationship, the less you concentrate on looks.  

I remember being awed by a super hot coworker when I first met him, but eventually you don't think of people by their looks, you think of them as their personality, you know?  If you were asked to describe someone you really know, the first think you think of is to describe their personality, not how they look.

Throw in the percentage of the population that is overweight - [data straight from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm) - and literally the majority of the population, a whopping **71.6%**, aka what gets represented as normal, is heavier than biologically normal.  I was being generous when I said 2/3s.

As someone who lives in the western half of the United States and has been shamed for being ""too skinny"" even though I'm perfectly average based on my ethnic body type, I'm sick of people acting like thin people are supposed to be called out because they've never stopped to examine their own biases.

There was a period of time when this sub was convinced that Osaka was the next chosen one based on her composure on court and ability to deliver in the GS finals.  Now the narrative has turned completely on its head with her being seen as emotionally/mentally streaky and losing confidence easily.

And just in the last USO Gauff had SO much hype and then got routinely schooled by Osaka, so everyone was like...well of course, she's only 15.

It’s good to be reminded not to go overboard with products, because healthy skin might not look flawless but it IS healthy.  Overuse of products can really damage that healthy skin, not to mention trying out multiple products at once is usually a recipe for disaster because even if something is or isn’t working, you don’t know which product it is.

Also it’s popular right now to think of skincare==self care, but that’s only true if you’re doing it in a healthy way and not an crazy obsessive way.  But that doesn’t help these companies market their products.  Now skincare==selfcare becomes a “buy this, fix your face, fix your life” spiel when in reality you don’t always need to “fix” your face.

Also the marketing scare tactics... even if you feel ok with this skin right now, you should be doing all this and buying all that to prevent aging, if you’re older than 16 you’re already late and god knows what irreversible damage has been done, blah blah blah"

Anyway, I like Catalina's novella and Sapphire Flames but I just don't LOVE her and Alessandro the way I loved Nevada and Rogan.  It took a while for me to put my finger on what bugged me so much about Sapphire Flames, but I finally figured it out.  IDK if I'm just too attached to Nevada/Rogan but I was kind of disturbed at how Sapphire Flames really backtracked on Nevada and Rogan's characterizations, you know?  Like it seemed as if in order to have Catalina stand on her own, they decided they had to make Nevada less mature/capable.  I mean, her character growth in the trilogy was about her learning to accept other people's help, but according to the explanation in Sapphire Flames, she totally backtracked to a ridiculous extent and left Catalina with a huge mess to clean up.  Somehow Nevada, who supported the entire Baylor family by herself, left them in such a huge financial mess (even after marrying Rogan) that Catalina is scraping by?  What?  And then Nevada had a tantrum and quit after a family intervention because she went off the deep end overworking herself and STILL not making any money whatsoever (while Rogan like, stood idly by)?  WHAT?  

And then to take Rogan out of the picture (so he wouldn't just overpower everyone, politically/socially and magically) they just made him kind of not care about what's happening to the rest of the Baylor family.

I was still a preteen at the time and the Song of the Lioness was my all time favorite, so I had a lot of feelings about the characters.

It was a really eye opening thread for me to stumble on.  I was still young enough that I was kind of a butthurt reader when Alanna *didn't* end up with the prince as expected, and then I was extra mad over how things with Liam went down.

There are 3 main stadium courts which are indoor and may have better air quality but it's not feasible to move all of qualifying to the three stadiums and if you only move some qualifiers, it's even more unfair.  The 8 other indoor courts available are the ones they said are worse, so that's out.  I suppose they could've tried to delay the entire schedule but I'm sure organizers have considered the options.

As for Rafa, Roger, and Djoker...yes, the top 3 best players of all time get preferential treatment with court assignation, that's always been the truth though.  Year after year, they also play night matches when qualifiers and other main draw match players get to sweat it out at over 100 degree weather outside.  Life's not fair in tennis but at least it's earned.  But that's like a handful of players who are going to be playing on the main stadiums with roofs (assuming that the air quality IS actually better indoors, which seems like a big assumption at this point).  All the rest of the players are playing in the same air.  There are only three stadium courts available that would be indoor courts, the other 8 indoor courts available are the ones that apparently have worse air quality.

Bottom line is, even assuming the three stadium courts have better air quality, you can't fit all the qualifiers on those three courts alone.  So then there's a big issue of unfairness if some get moved and some don't."

tennis,fejcq96,t1_fejc9qn,1579167504.0,"I’ve done some reading in this and I agree the biggest obstacle is getting the kind of structural change that would sustain more players. I guess the real debate is over exactly how many players are supposed to be sustained - players between 100-200 or even players 200-600. 

The slams without a doubt are where the biggest disparities are coming from, since so little of the percentage goes back to players.  But dumping it back into prize money still wouldn’t fix the number issue because you’re still only getting it to the top ~120 or so players.  That doesn’t bring the effective ranking cutoff (for sustainable career earnings) down from the top 100.  From what I’ve read, the idea would be to take the test of the revenue from the slams and subsidize those challenger events where players are making like $2k.  

But the players have no union to effectively do that and the biggest problem I think of that even if they do, they are still representing their own self interest too, which means I think even other tennis players won’t really ever vote to subsidize say, ranks 200+.  They would increase the money for the top 100 first (aka increasing prize money for early rounds) rather than have the revenue go toward letting more players “make it” on tour."
tennis,fejbo1d,t1_fejaseb,1579165898.0,"But if the sport holds interest only up to the top 100 players, then that’s the level the sport can sustain.  It doesn’t matter if the top 100th player would be equivalent to the top 3000th actor.  I mean, what do you think the cutoff should be then?  There will always be a point where the players ranked below that simply aren’t good enough to make a living out of it.  It’s hard to say if your scenario is really a young player who quits because they can’t afford the sport vs a player who arguably just shouldn’t even be trying because they can’t make it.  Again, like acting, if it isn’t working out then no one is really under an obligation to subsidize your pursuit of your dream career.

I agree that the main problem with tennis is that too little of the revenue proportionally makes its way back to the players.  But when people talk about tennis being a global sport, you have to remember that as an individual sport the structure is just different.  And I honestly don’t think the top players have as much control over what portion of the revenue gets back to the players... they’ve pushed for more prize money for lower ranks but short of the ATP subsidizing challenger events or something, if the event doesn’t bring in enough income to justify the prize money, It just doesn’t make sense.

How much are these rank 200-500 players generating?

First of all, they will all be playing in the same air and if anything the higher ranked players will be risking  more to their health as they are much more likely to be going through more matches/play time in those conditions.  So to say that Roger/Rafa aren’t leading the charge with regard to the air quality and player health is kind of stupid.  If he were talking more overall, about how he would like more representation from lower ranked players to guide the sport’s direction, then his statements have more merit.

Because if we took the top 500 and reduced it down to top 100 or top 200, would the majority of the tennis fans/sponsors/etc. actually notice?  The massive global sport doesn’t exist because of the lower ranked players, if the entire challengers tour got wiped out, would that really make that much of a difference? The vast majority of interest and income is generated by the few at the top.  Look at how players outside of the top 100 have difficulties even getting sponsors. Why don’t sponsors want that relationship? It comes down to pure economics.

Put another way, how is tennis any different from acting?  It’s a tough world to break into and it’s very much based on merit and luck.

I didn’t say any of that at all.  Nor can I see how I was “defensive” or what I was supposedly defensive about.

With regard to what I was actually talking about - as someone who had to sell various products on Amazon before from small businesses, I KNOW that a large portion of reviews, both positive and negative, are fake.  You can do 30 seconds of google research to confirm thus yourself if you don’t believe me.  “Verified purchase” is also incredibly easy to get around and companies are constantly finding ways to game the algorithms.  They offer free or discounted products for “verified” purchases, they can even go so far as to pay people to purchase their product, because the algorithms also propel new products up if you hit X number of purchases and reviews over Y time period.  There is an entire mini industry around gaming review systems and search optimization.  Recently, Amazon sellers were using old item IDs with thousands of legit reviews/ratings to sell NEW items, I.e. you’ll see reviews about phone chargers for a product like a kitchen pan.  Like I said, you can now buy hundreds of reviews for $5 and the fake reviewers are increasingly sophisticated, with multiple other reviews of items, careful timing of reviews so as not to trigger spam alerts, non-repetitive phrases, etc.  or when authors buy fake reviews if their book on Goodreads, for example, the companies providing these fake reviews even put in a percentage of negative reviews for the client to make the activity seem less suspicious... but still make sure that overall the rating is what the client wants it to be.

So yes, you should assume that at least a portion of reviews you see online at any given website and for any given product are probably fake.  That isn’t based on paranoia or even natural skepticism, it’s based on research and knowledge about how these review systems are used and abused."

As for posting negative reviews, I still maintain that the only solution to the entire fiasco of reviewing products is for consumers to understand, first and foremost, that whatever you think is ""reputable"" is not necessarily reputable at all.

I wouldn't trust a company posting negative reviews to be more reputable because it's just as easy for companies to buy NEGATIVE reviews of their competitor's products as it is to buy positive ones for themselves.  Are you 100% positive that The Ordinary and Paula's Choice's negative reviews are all actually legit?  Because fake negative reviews are just as bad as fake positive ones.

As for the review being censored, it seems like all the companies do this - the only solution is for consumers to not blindly trust ratings or reviews.  I mean, there are more fake reviews on Amazon than real reviews at this point and companies can buy hundreds of reviews for a few dollars.

Is it that you don't understand what freelancing is?  Do you not understand that not all work has to be pressing to count as *work*?  That freelancers can pick up work?

Let's say you have an offer for a babysitting job that you can make $400.  No, it's not ""pressing"" work, but it's something you planned on doing.  Your sister asks you to spend that time instead watching her pet iguana for $200 and then gets mad that you offer to do it for $300 because you're giving up the opportunity to earn $400.  What part of this is so hard to understand?"

> I'd been planning on doing some work on my freelance projects when I had free time

And because OP is on Christmas vacation, that's her free time.  AKA ""I didn't really have anything else to do because it's some rural area with everything an hour away and I get really bored sitting idle, so I was going to work on my freelance projects."""
AmItheAsshole,fcw3q1o,t1_fcw35ny,1578016444.0,"No, really?  I had no idea!"
AmItheAsshole,fcw314z,t1_fcw1zyr,1578015980.0,"Ok, now I'm starting to think that you didn't even read it, or were so biased you skipped over parts that you don't believe.  OP didn't say she had nothing to do.

> I said I had planned on doing freelance work at the library

As for the other part, I work at a hospital and none of the doctors in my department would even be able to check in a patient (which takes all of 3 clicks) let alone cover adequately enough to ""help"" the unit.  But I don't know what kind of hospital you were working at and it doesn't matter.  

Your analogy isn't correct, the doctor isn't catching up on patient charts on her down time, she's literally forgoing her paying work in order to make LESS money.  I have no idea how you arrived at ""little extra money"" when OP would be losing money."
AmItheAsshole,fcw1d75,t1_fcvzs8s,1578014885.0,"Are you serious?  You won't even bother addressing the analogy because you genuinely think that being a front desk receptionist and being a doctor are two similar lines of work that don't require totally different skills sets?  Take your average doctor, plop them down as a receptionist, and see how far you get.

But fine.  Let's go with your analogy.  You think the doctor can do you a favor by mowing your lawn for free.  The doctor says no, they already have to do their own work.  You ask them again if they can mow your lawn if you pay them and rather than telling them you want to pay them X for doing this favor for you, you ask them what they need to be paid to **stop their own work** in order the take on your lawn.  And then you actually flip out and tell them that no, mowing the lawn should only be worth minimum wage.  But somehow you actually think the doctor is to blame for the whole scenario and they are both equally wrong?

The parents reacted the way they did because they were trying to take advantage of OP by getting her to work for free because she's ""family.""  Yes, parents trying to compensate OP's time is a negative when they clearly wanted her to do it for free and then threw a tantrum because she wouldn't give up a hefty portion of her own income as a favor to them.

Edit: After reading some of your other comments, let me see if I can explain this any more clearly.  Your sister comes to you and says that she needs you to do a favor, can you mow the law for her?  You say no, you're already babysitting during those hours.  She tells you that ok, she'll pay you.  You say that in order to mow her lawn, you'll have to give up your babysitting hours, so you need to be paid at least something similar to your rate, which is X.  She gets offended solely by hearing your rate, since she expects you to do it for minimum wage, because mowing the law is generally worth minimum wage.  After all, she's not hiring you as a babysitter.  In summary, she wants you to lose income by working for her."
AmItheAsshole,fcvzilv,t1_fcvz55h,1578013667.0,"Why does it matter, do you know what state or city OP lives in?

What state do YOU live in that you actually think you can pay someone $10/hr for taking care of 3 kids?"
AmItheAsshole,fcvzazv,t1_fcvxa8u,1578013528.0,"They didn't offer to pay her though.  They asked her to babysit, OP said she already had other work, so then they offered to pay her and proceeded to throw tantrums when they didn't like her offer.

You are completely confused about why it's $35/hr.  It has nothing to do with her qualifications.  OP already had higher valued work, her favor is to give up some of her income in order to accept LOWER valued work, i.e. babysitting.  

If you ask a doctor to fill in for a front desk receptionist and get mad that they aren't willing to work for a receptionist's wage, that has NOTHING to do with whether the doctor is qualified enough for receptionist work or not.  That's on you for being entitled enough to think that you should have someone else's labor for cheap.  Just because YOU think they're worth minimum wage doesn't mean that's how they value their own time.

> Everyone on here agrees

The person you're thanking doesn't agree that the parents should not have yelled at OP or insulted her, they're heaping more insults on OP as well as everyone who isn't saying she's an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,fcvxxhg,t1_fcvwthq,1578012623.0,"lmao it's clear from all your comments that you're the one absolutely furious that someone makes a higher hourly rate at their job than you.  Where I live, those parents would be lucky to get ANYONE to take 3 kids for $30/hr.  Not everyone lives in Bumfuck, Alabama making $7.25/hr.

She did decline the job.  She set her price and the mom didn't like it, end of story.  There was absolutely no call for the mom and dad to be attacking her because they couldn't take advantage of her with at some minimum wage price.  

Her time IS plainly worth more than theirs, sorry it bothers you so much.  If you want to go up to a doctor and ask them to pretty please do you a favor by filling in for the front desk receptionist for $20/hr, and then be rude enough to insult them for not being willing to give up THEIR HOURLY PAY to take on a lower pay, you'd be laughed out your ass."
AmItheAsshole,fcvx5xe,t1_fcvpcog,1578012117.0,"So what's your defense for the parents who apparently suck so much they're willing to leave their 3 kids for 3 days with the totally inexperienced OP?

You can't have it both ways.  They chose to ask her and then to try to guilt trip her by telling her they have ""no options"" if she doesn't do it, now you want to claim that because she's too unqualified she should suck it up and be paid minimum wage for it, all while being insulted by the parents?"
AmItheAsshole,fcvvmf3,t1_fcvmfi0,1578011113.0,"The parents are the ones trying to take advantage of OP.  The moment the mom said that OP is ""trying to take advantage of how she didn't have other options"" you absolutely know that she thought she could foist her kids off on OP just because she's family. The yelling at her was absolutely disrespectful.  Did you even read what they said to her?  

Not to mention this dude preaching that OP's not qualified to babysit -- ok then, OP isn't qualified.  That just makes the parents 100% the assholes for dumping their three kids for three days one someone ""not qualified"" and ""completely useless"" and ""fucking shit at"" and so on.  

It's telling that the guy trying to defend your position literally left over a dozen pissed off comments about how OP is an entitled spoilt little shit."
AmItheAsshole,fcvv43q,t1_fcvtfg2,1578010787.0,"Oh please, I'm sure you would also tell the 24 year old lawyer they're being entitled, try to guilt trip them by saying they left you with ""no options""  if they didn't want to babysit, and top it off with telling them their time is no way worth that much.   Would you also tell a 24 year old man that they're just a 24 year old boy and damn near a child?  Yeah right.

Not to mention, if you genuinely believe OP is ""completely useless"" and not qualified, than the REAL ASSHOLES are the parents who are leaving their three kids for three days in the hands of someone completely useless and not qualified.  What's your defense for these shitty parents?"

Well, you are generally answering ""is it cancer?  is it not cancer?""  Now think of the most basic of exams, the chest xray.
