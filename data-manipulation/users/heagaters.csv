AskReddit,ff3zyr3,t1_ff23qj7,1579552541.0,"Funny story, if anybody wants to read it. I thought my dog, a border collie named Blotter, had a prolapsed rectum. One morning I‚Äôm taking him outside in our yard, letting him run and do his thing. He does the sniff and spin around and squats to take a shit. I‚Äôm checking my phone and when I look up he still squatted down but has this deep-red long thing hanging out of his butt and he keeps spinning around and high stepping like he can‚Äôt get rid of it. I go inside and get my husband, he is an experienced dog owner. I‚Äôm like oh my God I think he‚Äôs dying! My husband (farm kid, has seen prolapsed cattle) laughs at me and says no, Blotter would be in way worse shape if that‚Äôs what it was. Bravely, like a knight, he goes and checks out the dog. The dog had eaten a pair of my underwear and the elastic band and fabric, which was dark red, was what was stuck hanging out of his ass."

WeightLossAdvice,feohjpi,t3_eq1zti,1579300273.0,"Lots of great suggestions here.  I‚Äôve been on water for awhile, and did what lots of comments here are suggesting.  But... while I don‚Äôt drink any soda anymore, I did find that I do not consume enough water regularly. So to get motivated I found this sub, 
r/hydrohomies and it‚Äôs super inspirational and funny and I have found myself doubling my water intake. This has led to overall less cravings., And wanting to eat more fruits and veggies. PSA: something I learned on that sub, your pee should not be clear! You are looking for a light, straw yellow color. There is such a thing as too much water.

I used to hate vegetables- all of them! Had some health issues and I am now an unwilling low-fat, vegan‚Ä¶ tryin to make it work.  My go-to is lasagna-you can literally steam vegetables, and/or also use raw -throw all of that into a food processor and blend it up. Add all the seasonings that you like to help mask the flavor at first.  Between the sauce, and if you keep the cheese (lucky you), you really can‚Äôt taste the vegetables. If it‚Äôs a vegetable you really noticed the taste of like broccoli is pretty strong, I recommend steaming it first that seems to take some of the kick out of it. Through gradual exposure like this, vegetables became much more palatable and dare I say I actually like them now! But I also don‚Äôt have any other options LOL. Best of luck! I hope you reach your goals :-)"
