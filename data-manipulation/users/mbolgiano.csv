Parenting,ff5ga50,t3_ermw5j,1579591571.0,"Dad here. Same deal. My daughter is the perfect kiddo when I'm watching her. But when mom gets home, the whining begins.

A large part of it is probably due to the fact that most dads including myself will let their kid literally do whatever they please as long as serious harm/death is not likely to result from it.

Minor harm?  Sure!  That's what we call ""self-teaching moments""."
Parenting,ff5esve,t1_ff3p3er,1579589790.0,"I'm pretty sure your wife also married me LOL.  I think it's a guy/girl thing. My wife has ZERO fear of rejection too, just straight up asks for phone numbers, Facebook etc.

I on the other hand feel lowkey creepy asking another dude for his contact info.  Not sure why.

And talking to another female parent?  LOL just straight up ain't happening chief. I'm like Raj on Big Bang Theory.  I felt guilty as shit today because my five year old was riding her bike and saw this girl her age across the street riding a bike with training wheels too.  Her mother was out there watching her. I, dad, was watching my kid. My kid asks if we can go over there to see if the girl wants to play.  I was very hesitant and made bullshit excuses as to why we couldn't. In reality, it was because of my own personal irrational fears. Since the husband wasn't home yet I didn't want to create a scene where he rolls up and some dude is chatting his wife up. I'm old fashioned I think. I tend to also think about extreme circumstances such as what if the woman is in a rocky relationship and my presence causes her to get beat/abused later.  Stupid I know."

Parenting,ff5bauy,t3_erokkl,1579586021.0,"For a 3 year old that's somewhat traumatic. They see their toys as something THEY are in control of. THEY decide how they get played with, whom they will share with, etc. In a 3 year olds world, this is huge because there's very little that is exclusively theirs.

Having said this, I also have resorted to using fear as a tool to get my child to do what I've told them to do.  I think we get to the end of our rope and do this when nothing else is working on that particular day.  Sometimes we are exasperated and just want our kids to comply without the song & dance, having to play games, etc."
Parenting,ff596s2,t3_erhywy,1579584007.0,"Parenting can be, emotionally, a very bittersweet & paradoxical endeavor.  Because they depend on you for care and nurturing, a bond forms between you and your child that only gets stronger as time passes.  And yet, the ultimate goal is to raise them so that they learn how to be independent. How happy I will be as I watch my (now 5 year old) daughter start college, career, family etc.

And yet so sad that she doesn't need me anymore.

All of this to say... YES, I agree with OP.  Live in the moment; for those moments are fleeting and soon forgotten."
