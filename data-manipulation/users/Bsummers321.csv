depression,ffafwti,t1_ff7qykw,1579734809.0,"I think it happens to a lot of us with mental illnesses/depression. I still think I'm in my early 20s sometimes, time move fasts for me. If only I could stop the ageing process!

Ha, we're our own worst enemy sometimes."
depression,ff6vose,t1_ff4hifr,1579635841.0,"I need to come to terms with the fact that it'll take time for me. I don't know if I focus on the goals as much as I focus on my peers and those younger than me, I compare my life to theirs and feel inadequate and hate myself even more. 

I think focussing on my progress with mental health helps a lot, I might be feeling past it at 31, but mentally I'm doing much better than I was at 21."
depression,ff4epur,t1_ff3jfz8,1579561842.0,"Stability and success is something I wished I had, I'm 
ashamed of what my life has become. I didn't see myself living past 30 when I was young, I didn't see a future for myself and now I'm here. All of a sudden I'm aware of how old I am and how many years I've wasted.

To me successful would be having better mental health, a good education (qualifications), a good career and a partner. Basically the things I noticed when I was lurking on Facebook.

I've worked on my mental health the past 6 years, I finally got help for my depression and anxiety and had therapy and counselling yet I am still depressed, something inevitably happens and I have another breakdown. The fact that I'm still dealing with bad mental health and have low self esteem make me feel like those other goals are out of my reach, and I feel like it's too late for me. I'm not suicidal, but I don't know how many more years I can take."
depression,ff366cy,t3_erbhjy,1579534625.0,"Feeling like that is terrible, I'll be like that and feel really numb like I'm a zombie, I want to scream and bawl my eyes out but my body doesn't want to show what I'm feeling inside."

depression,ff35fd1,t1_ff2szc5,1579534107.0,"It sucks, we're needlessly torturing ourselves by doing it, but we can't stop :("
depression,ff3587e,t1_ff2u2t0,1579533971.0,"Their Happiness, they seem on the surface to have their lives sorted out. They've started families and careers and established themselves. So that's where the jealousy comes from. While I've fallen behind in life due to poor mental health and isolation.

While I don't want kids, I guess seeing my former classmates have kids and settle down to me signifies success? It's what society expects of you at this age anyway."
depression,feozuro,t3_eq191i,1579308998.0,"I think about this everyday, I daydream about going back and changing my life. Obviously I can't time travel, but I'd give anything to be able to go back."
depression,fe67mu2,t3_enp1k6,1578883599.0,"I feel you, I'm 31 and I've been depressed since I was around 8. I got help/diagnosed when I was around my mid 20s (heh finally), I can't remember a time when I didn't feel sad.

I remember being 8 and not wanting to exist anymore, and those thoughts still creep up to this day. I missed out on so much in life,  but it's hard to imagine life without it."
pakistan,fdh6mas,t1_fdgvv4l,1578416501.0,"I'm not sure what that has to do with what I said.

My point (albeit mockingly) was that people not from that specific region (areas in modern day Pakistan) claim that us the descendants of the people from that region have no right to claim our own history or believe because we don't share the same faith as our ancestors that someone who has no relation to the area (eg rohit from bihar) has more claim to it than us.

It's like saying Italians can't claim ancient rome or Boudica can't be a british folk hero because of christianity.

The only Punjabis that claim descent from mughals are those whose zaat is mughal. The majority of Punjabis have different zaats/tribes so I have never met a jatt or rajput claim to be related to the Mughals.

I don't know what Punjabis have do to with my initial post, Pakistan is diverse, please attack all of us equally."
depression,fdc8ww5,t3_ekfp0m,1578269413.0,I agree? I sleep as much as I can. Plus I get vivid dreams where I'm happy or content sometimes and it feels great.
depression,fd9ql0f,t3_ek7pnd,1578236747.0,"I'm so glad things are looking up for you, sounds like you had a great time :) 

Remember to take it a day at a time, if you have one bad day try and look forward and not back and when you have days like today, cherish them. Remember the joy you are feeling right now and tell yourself you can feel it again going on.

Just think about lucky you are that you are here right now and feeling what you're feeling. Best wishes for the future :)"
pakistan,fd9igx5,t3_ek99zd,1578233832.0,"Rohit from Bihar will still claim King Porus is his chacha though because something something that region was Bihar and pakistanis are either invaders or you were all forcibly converted and my bhakt science 
book says your dna changes when you take the shahada."
depression,fd2v1d1,t3_ejw74l,1578151862.0,"You have many more years to come, you can't go back in time but you can try and make your future count. I wish I was 19 again, I wasted my 20s because I gave up on life and if I could go back I'd cherish every moment. You're young and you have your whole life ahead of you. It's hard not to think back and reminisce, but the only thing we can do now is move forward and create new memories."

depression,fczhu45,t3_ejnao7,1578101579.0,"I do this all the time, in fact I wrote a post 2 minutes ago and deleted it before I saw this post.

I have no friends and can't talk to a mental health professional at 3am when I'm having dark thoughts and can't sleep. So I write up a long post and erase it because I feel irrational, like people will judge me or I'm afraid I'll trigger the people reading my post and make their mental health suffer too."
SuicideWatch,eifh9uf,t1_eia5450,1552485577.0,"Yes you're right, those kind of people are toxic and take joy in other people's pain instead of dealing with their own problems. 

I went to talk to a psychologist yesterday at the psychiatric hospital for an emergency appointment and he said the same thing. It's going to take a while for me to make peace with this, but I can't beat myself up over something I had no control over.

Yes meds are important, sometimes you need them just to keep you going so you can deal with/address your issues. I know I wouldn't be talking to you right now If I didn't have them to stabilise my mood.

Thank you, you too and thanks for taking the time out to talk to me."
