hiphopheads,fervor4,t1_ferldhy,1579358837.0,"man I'm sorry but if somebody says to me that my thought process is common. That says to me that he thinks he's smarter than me, or at least just calling me dumb."
hiphopheads,ferkxe0,t1_feret9w,1579355239.0,man is that a diss at me or other guy? I just felt a way about it cos he said he was smarter than from the jump. Not the best way to start a conversation.

hiphopheads,fepwdeu,t1_fepw5c9,1579333520.0,but again that's just our opinion
hiphopheads,fepw7jx,t1_fepw5c9,1579333477.0,Right then I agree with you there.
hiphopheads,fepw0ij,t1_fepvxrd,1579333317.0,So you're saying his lyrics have to be similar as well? Do you literally think that for an album to be influenced by another album it has to copy every aspect of it?
hiphopheads,fepvy8p,t1_fepvuuj,1579333256.0,Okay? I haven't heard about it sorry. I don't know how I would have heard about it either. Nobody else has mentioned it.

hiphopheads,fepvpuw,t1_fepvln2,1579333016.0,You brought up lyrics out of nowhere
hiphopheads,fepvpet,t1_fepvln2,1579333003.0,There's no fault to admit. I never said lyrics don't count for anything
hiphopheads,fepvmyc,t1_fepvffy,1579332931.0,"I mean it's an Eminem discussion post so that's what I was here to talk about initially. After that I was here to talk about how 808s influenced modern pop rap. Based on what I have heard from pop rap these days specifically earlier drake like Marvin's Room, or songs like antidote. I can hear the 808s influence within those songs."
hiphopheads,fepvh5h,t1_fepvag8,1579332761.0,buddy if this is how you talk to strangers I feel bad for you tbh. I also think it's pretty fair to assume that most songs on a future album or Tavis Scott album sound pretty much the same.
hiphopheads,fepve11,t1_fepvcgw,1579332668.0,Why does it sound like that? Because I haven't listened to a future album?
hiphopheads,fepvc74,t1_fepv427,1579332614.0,"There you go again by the way, acting like you're all knowing and anybody who doesn't know as much as the almighty Shaggy2ropes shouldn't dare to throw their hat in the ring of high brow, intellectual hip hop discussion as can be found on r/hhh"
hiphopheads,fepv8y3,t1_fepv427,1579332524.0,what do you mean? Learn the culture? You want me to listen to artists I don't like? That's what learning the culture means to you?
hiphopheads,fepv3fo,t1_fepuzet,1579332369.0,I'm not saying he's put out classic work. I'm saying that you saying he's a busy is subjective and doesn't mean anything.
hiphopheads,fepv2gf,t1_fepuzet,1579332341.0,Okay? How does that change what I said?
hiphopheads,fepv1i3,t1_fepuwy0,1579332312.0,"I also said I wasn't sure what you meant by bastardizing. Which made it clear that I wasn't taking that into account because I don't know what you do and do not like.

Yes. You. Are. The. Asshole.

You're speaking to me like I'm some piece of shit on the ground."
hiphopheads,fepupm5,t1_fepudom,1579331973.0,"Saying that drake is a complete bust is subjective to you. As evidenced by the fact he's hugely successful, so many other people love his music, even though you think it's a ""complete bust""."
hiphopheads,fepun32,t1_fepugy7,1579331907.0,"you said my thought process was common. Okay, you might not be calling me stupid, but you're placing your intelligence on a higher level than mine based off of a few interactions on a social media website."
hiphopheads,fepukdu,t1_fepudom,1579331836.0,"Okay great. 

You're such an asshole. Just because I don't listen to albums from artists I don't like, that means I never listen to albums as a whole? Jesus Christ dude.

Also just because it hasn't been replicated in a way you find acceptable doesn't mean that it wasn't influenced by 808s. Designer made a shitty mixtape that was a rip off of future, it was bad but it was still influenced by Future. Something doesn't have to be an exact replica to be influenced by something."
hiphopheads,fepucsu,t1_fepu27x,1579331598.0,"Okay? Why are you so mad about it? A normal person would explain why they disagree, not call the person they disagree with stupid. 

I do care about hip hop, I don't know fucking everything about it. You still haven't actually explained what you think 808s did and did not influence."
hiphopheads,fepu196,t1_feptw8j,1579331269.0,"Because you can fucking hear the influence, are you saying 808s influenced nothing in hip hop?"
hiphopheads,feptziy,t1_feptye2,1579331221.0,Okay? And? Why are you so mad about it?
hiphopheads,fepturw,t1_feptrwn,1579331088.0,"Sure did buddy. I said that about the album's influenced by 808s, not 808s itself"
hiphopheads,feptngu,t1_feprh30,1579330884.0,"Well I didn't say that, did I? So I don't know where you got that from, maybe it's just your common thought process."
hiphopheads,feptlj8,t1_fepsc90,1579330831.0,"I haven't listened to a whole album from any of those people, but I've heard singles. Settle down"
hiphopheads,feptk8l,t1_feps3af,1579330796.0,"why are you being a dick about it? Sorry we don't all live on your super intellectual plane Einstein. I meant the overall sound and how it's more about the mood of the song than it is about bars and a classic hip hop sound, the introduction of electronic sounds. 

Sorry my thought process is so ""common"". I haven't listened to 808s for years. All I know is that when I hear a song from it, it doesn't sound dated to this day."
CozyPlaces,feprhmy,t3_eq4yv5,1579328808.0,I love it
hiphopheads,fepreor,t1_feppki8,1579328734.0,"any album with heaps of autotune on it. future, migos, drake (in terms of being super emotional), Travis Scott. I'm not sure I know what you mean by ""bastardizing"" other than you think those artists make bad music."
hiphopheads,fepp648,t1_fepoha8,1579326699.0,"okay but 808s changed rap music, it influenced the sound we still hear today"
hiphopheads,fepp4ot,t1_fepoced,1579326663.0,"but 808s was the shape of rap to come, it changed shit"
hiphopheads,fepo727,t1_fepnskr,1579325849.0,I mean early 2010 is 10 years ago. I think it's fair to call MBDTF or 808s a classic.
