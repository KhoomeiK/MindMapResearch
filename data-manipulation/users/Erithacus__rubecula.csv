AutoImmuneProtocol,fgi7xmu,t3_eygry9,1580810305.0,"Maybe try butternut squash, acorn squash and other types of squashes. I would make sure whatever you try is cooked thoroughly and is paired with a full meal with protein and green veggies. I have digestive trouble with uncooked foods unless it’s green (raw carrots are the worst culprit.) 

I have not had that specific problem with the sore throat, sorry no advice on that. I will say that if I were you, I would stay on AIP a bit and give it time to heal because it sounds like you’re coming from a higher level of inflammation. Good luck, I hope you find what works right for you"

simpleliving,fflwud6,t3_eu3acq,1580045103.0,"Here is an example: [https://images.app.goo.gl/eqDLCHv4YkMFvUNS7](https://images.app.goo.gl/eqDLCHv4YkMFvUNS7)of a room divided by an inexpensive IKEA shelving unit. The design still allows light to come through, and you can use a couple of shelves on the side with the bed as your “nightstand” and the others can be dedicated to storage/display of your items. Check your local secondhand market, these shelves are often given away or sold very inexpensively when people move or change situations. Domino magazine and Apartment Therapy have pretty good ideas for this because they focus a lot on markets with small spaces such as NYC & San Francisco. 

Good luck!"
NaturalBeauty,ffes99y,t3_esy2vv,1579863064.0,I can get some monster ingrown hairs at times. What has worked for me was waxing at a specialized place for Brazilian waxes. The owners are all from Brazil and import the wax that they love and used back home to use on their clients. Somehow it gives me far less ingrown hairs. In between I use an epilator to touch up. Somehow the combo of using the epilator when the hairs are already sparser from waxing seemed to be the secret recipe. I also exfoliate the area with Acure brightening scrub.
AutoImmuneProtocol,ffepws2,t3_et3z63,1579859564.0,"I would very rarely eat cereal if it were available. (I can’t eat a lot of treats like that, things made to recreate bread/desserts/baked goods because they seem to mess up my system and cause a flare.) 

My suggestion would be to go along with whatever properties the ingredients give you. Different AIP flours have different outcomes, so you may find one gives pretty good flakes, while a little more of a different ingredient causes it to become a great granola-like consistency. 

Best of luck!"
NaturalBeauty,ff8mshh,t3_es8f2f,1579686346.0,"I used a small amount of plain baking soda for awhile, then switched to deodorant containing baking soda. When I started to get a reaction I tried to switch back to plain baking soda, but my skin reacted and I got a worse rash. I read recently that baking soda causes a chemical burn because of the difference in ph compared to our skin, for some people it can take a longer time for the cumulative effects than others. 

I had to switch to zero baking soda formulas. Any baking soda now and I immediately break out pretty bad. I’m using Schmidt’s sensitive formula, which I think uses arrowroot to absorb moisture"

femalefashionadvice,feg74p5,t1_fefnnc0,1579080147.0,"I’ve never had an issue with pulling them down when sweaty, the compression is low, so it feels kind of like an extra stretchy pair of really high waisted shorts. I would go by the size guide, I measure out as a medium and that’s the size I got and it’s perfect. If you go too small it will be harder to get off and may give you a little muffin top depending on how squishy your sides/tummy is. But the correct size doesn’t really do that to me!"
AutoImmuneProtocol,fefigl3,t1_fefgane,1579056999.0,"This is the first recipe I tried and it was amazing.

I am on a regimen of Coenzyme Q10, B2, magnesium (high absorption chelated formula), L-Carnitine, and Vitamin D3 with added K. That helped tremendously, and my neurologist put me on Emgality injections. That helped a little too. Migraines used to hit me 25+ days a month, with many other symptoms. I did an elimination diet to learn I can’t have soy, wheat, gluten, dairy, corn, nuts, and sugar. 

Now I have ~2-3 a month. Such an improvement!"

If I don’t have *super* high rise I will leave it untucked, but only if it’s a sweater or loose fitting top. My best look is super high rise (11.5-12”+ rise) pants or skirt and a fitted top completely tucked"

Sjogrens,fdiv7ih,t3_elj5hp,1578451779.0,"Not sure if I'll be of much assistance, but I noticed when I have a big Sjögren's flare my periods stop. The first time my rheumy gave me Cevimeline I was in a bad Sjögren's flare and hadn't had a period in almost a year. When I started the medication I had a period that month. I suspect (for me) there's some component where the body can get too dry to produce a period, but I'm no expert, just observing my own body. 

I asked my rheumy about it and he refused to talk about anything to do with my reproductive system because it's ""not his specialty."" When I asked my OB-GYN, she looked at me like I had three heads and told me she didn't think Sjögren's could impact my cycle. I'm really hoping that doctors stop drawing hard lines between specialties sometime soon because everything is connected and it's so frustrating not being able to get advice or answers (or even have a discussion.)

Sorry for the novel, I've been frustrated about this for a while, as you can see. I don't have any experience getting tested for hormones or treatment or anything, because they always say my hormones are ""normal."" I hope you find the answers you need, and if you learn anything, please share!"
