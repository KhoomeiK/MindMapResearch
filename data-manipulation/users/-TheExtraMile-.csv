starcitizen,fffqmu7,t3_etcww2,1579889685.0,"That. Was. Amazing!

Really, really well edited! Love the cinematic vibe. 10/10 :)"
starcitizen,ffffniz,t3_etchmi,1579882928.0,"Hey there! Fps should be definitely playable with your specs, I’d guess around 40.

You can check this page to see what other people with similar specs are getting: https://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/telemetry

In terms of no vr I’d say that this is a tough one to answer. I do have a headset as well and love playing sims in vr, but I also find myself putting a lot of hours into SC. It’s quite fun at the moment, but as you already mentioned it’s still alpha and some bugs are to be expected.

Overall I’d say it’s worth to get back in at the moment. The game is pretty stable and it’s getting better and better with every patch."
blackmirrorirl,fffa9g3,t3_etawqs,1579879515.0,"It´s very cool in theory, but I honestly doubt that we are there yet. How will this be powered? How will you get the necessary data to the device? Rendering at ""14k ppi"" is an insane amount of data even when they wouldn´t be using the whole FOV. 

AR will happen in this decade, and big time too. But it will be in the form of glasses, not lenses. This could be something for the 2030ies."
BeamNG,fff1ekh,t3_et1z4f,1579873033.0,"Goddamn that was awesome. 

10/10 :)"
toastme,ffeo7zq,t3_et5lla,1579856999.0,"Thanks for the title toast!! :)

I hope your 2020 will be all that you want it to be!"
starcitizen,ffcr7uf,t3_esw3jm,1579805585.0,"Sadly I have to agree with you. Exterieur is pretty sweet, interieur is “just” two medical beds in an otherwise unchanged cargo bay. I would have expected maybe some more equipment, maybe some storage for medical supplies etc.

It will serve its purpose and I guess you don’t need operating tables or something like that 900 years in the future, but it seems a bit sparse overall.

Maybe they can add things when medical gameplay is a bit more developed."
starcitizen,ffc6g81,t3_esss96,1579792637.0,"Sadly not yet. My personal guess is late 2021, could be later though. 

I personally have a HP Reverb and looooove the resolution. It really is very sharp. Valve Index is very good too (more FOV than Reverb, much better controllers), Rift S is a solid ""low budget"" choice."
depression,ff9qibk,t1_ff6f60b,1579718746.0,Thank you!!
depression,ff5rewb,t1_ff5r4zl,1579607298.0,Thank you man!!

starcitizen,ff5qsh9,t1_ff5m7b1,1579606515.0,"Well Mr. pedantic, my generalized statement was an answer to your generalized statement. Meaning, if anything we need more glass in ships."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff5og4b,t1_ff5iqui,1579603229.0,"Okay, now that was funny!"
starcitizen,ff5lenc,t1_ff5kflx,1579598581.0,"""I would argue that some ships should have more glass, some should have less, and some should have none at all.."" 

I mean that says exactly nothing? Sure different ships need different amounts of glass. The terrapin should have very little, a connie andromeda or 600i should have more etc."
starcitizen,ff5k7vj,t1_ff5iz28,1579596827.0,"That is completely fair! I guess that is kind of like that with all games. Either it grips you from the getgo or it doesn´t. 

Elite Dangerous certainly has its pros and cons too! Especially VR support weighs heavily in my book. Just choose what makes you happier and go with that :)"
starcitizen,ff5inau,t3_ermb5x,1579594618.0,"I really could not agree less with your two main points. Thruster parallel to the deck is what we see in 95% of scifi shows and there is a reason for that. And I would actually argue for MORE glass in ships, not less. Firstly, it´s a game. And secondly, what the hell do you know about super strong nano-glass tech 900 years in the future? 

I do agree with the cameras, but from what I have heard that is a technical/performance issue, not that they don´t want to do that."
starcitizen,ff5igux,t3_ero3p5,1579594376.0,I like it! Sleek and deadly.
starcitizen,ff5idvp,t3_erp1wc,1579594264.0,"I am yearning for VR support in SC but we´re not there yet. In fact, I would guess that the earliest chance for that is around late 2021. We need full vulkan integration first, and we need the game to run a lot better than it does now. 

It will come, it should be pretty damn mindblowing, but we will have to wait for that. I can recommend Elite Dangerous for your space game VR needs for now, or NMS or Star Trek Bridge Crew."
starcitizen,ff5hzny,t3_errifv,1579593742.0,"Well it´s good to see that you did a thorough test before you decided you ""ain´t believing that guy anymore"" :)"
dogpictures,ff5fqj2,t3_erhtu1,1579590899.0,So sorry for your loss man. Isaac looks like he had a great life with you!
fatpeoplestories,ff5fp9v,t3_erh0fl,1579590855.0,You did absolutely nothing wrong! And your friends probably should have said something to the hambeast a bit earlier.
starcitizen,ff300eb,t1_ff2yo35,1579529973.0,"I have the rough ideas from here: [https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/16671-The-Shipyard-Medical-Gameplay](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/engineering/16671-The-Shipyard-Medical-Gameplay)

Not sure about when though. But my gutt says very rough medical gameplay v1 sometime this year (healing others with medpens, dragging wounded people to medbeds etc.) and really detailed medical gameplay not before 2022. 

I could be wrong though!"
starcitizen,ff2xae4,t1_ff2viih,1579527557.0,"Hmm, good point. It´s a different story on a 890 Jump or even Idris!"
starcitizen,ff2qo0j,t1_ff2q3qi,1579519672.0,"Yesss! Exactly. Broken arm/bullet in the shoulder should make it harder or impossible to aim, maybe you can´t use two handed weapons anymore, only pistols etc. 

At the moment player health works exactly as ship health. You just have a health pool and when that is at zero you die. So you can shoot someone in the foot a few times and they will die. 

Not very realistic at all, but they know that and will fix it. I assume that the new player status system might already tackle that issue."
starcitizen,ff2qkyu,t1_ff2pwj8,1579519546.0,"Hmm very good question. Generally speaking I would advise against third party apps when it comes to controller bindings etc. I personally have made the experience that they tend to make things worse haha. 

I think I would wait for a bit before you tackle that. The devs have recently said that the new MFD UI will be designed so you can easily navigate them with the joystick. So whatever you do now would be moot when that comes online anyway."
starcitizen,ff2pl7f,t3_er43mp,1579518075.0,"Download it and give it a shot! It´s honestly a pretty cool experience at the moment. At the very least you´ll be able to enjoy it for a few hours and if it´s not for you, then you can deinstall it again. 

But I personally am getting quite a bit of playtime out of the current build, and it´s getting better and better with every patch."
starcitizen,ff2gsua,t1_ff2gimy,1579505495.0,"I am definitely with you on that one! I have discovered upgrading ship components recently which gave me a lot more motivation to earn money and play. But overall we need much, much more to do. 

Being able to transfer cash between players would be a nice way to get some emergent gameplay going."
starcitizen,ff2frld,t1_ff1j67b,1579504257.0,"Kind of through the beacons, but that is more of a workaround then a real mechanic. I really, really hope that we will just get the ability to transfer money directly from player to play through mobiglass. That would solve so many issues. 

I think the personal finance mobiglass app is scheduled for 4.0? Maybe we´ll get something then."
starcitizen,ff2fp39,t1_ff15m8w,1579504177.0,"Hmm, that is a good point actually! Although I don´t think it´s too fast for a boarding situation and only two beds. Plus you can shoot someone in the bed as they can´t move."
starcitizen,ff2fnk7,t1_ff0pa0w,1579504125.0,"That is true! I guess I´d like it to be a bit more realistic. Broken arms or legs shouldn´t kill you, but should make it harder/impossible to shoot or walk. Serious fractures might come with severe blood loss which would have to be stopped short term (medpen) and then treated long term (medbay). 

Obviously bullets to the torso would have a much higher chance of being lethal, bullets to the head would almost always instantly lethal etc.

At the moment player health is like ship health. You can shoot a player in the foot a few times and he will die. There is no logic to it, just a health pool that is being drained."
starcitizen,fez9y7q,t1_fez2you,1579455173.0,Indeed! I really like it. Let’s see what the future holds in that regard when the economy is a bit more refined.
starcitizen,fez9syp,t1_fez2rmw,1579455122.0,Only with new patches or if you encounter any unusual bugs.
starcitizen,fez2xl7,t3_eqyrix,1579453382.0,"Holy shit, that’s pretty neat! We definitely need a longer ttk for injuries then. Usually I am dead within a minute or so when I break legs etc.

In fact, it would be nice to just not die from a broken leg :)"
starcitizen,fez2hnz,t1_fez0euh,1579453238.0,"Yeah, the more I think about it, the more I like it. This could also generate more player made missions to other players. Maybe you need a guy with a mining ship to get the resources for you. And then you hire a guy with a caterpillar to haul them to a refinery etc."
starcitizen,fez1rkp,t1_fez0eqx,1579453098.0,"Haha yeah I have been there! View settings should be relatively safe though, and you can backup the .ini. It’s in the user folder. Don’t remember which one exactly but ironically it was not the controls folder. You will recognize the file immediately though, it’s in of the subfolders of the user folder."
starcitizen,feyzw4z,t3_eqx37c,1579452538.0,"That is under “flight - view” I believe.

The default binding for “look up, down, left, right” is on the stick. Just click on them and then right click to delete the binding.

PS: just thought about it and that would work in first person too, so that might not be it."
starcitizen,feyzlxk,t3_eqxpdh,1579452438.0,"First all of all nice mockup!!

I like the idea! Maybe be the price drop could be a bit less, but it would give someone the option to do a bit more legwork in order to save some cash, and others that want the ship faster would still have the option to buy normally."
starcitizen,fexizr9,t1_fev5js7,1579431770.0,And I certainly agree with that!
starcitizen,fexiwnq,t1_fev45ru,1579431726.0,"I agree with that! You are right about the rate of decelaration, although I kind of think that it might be a part of learning to handle the machine. In real life a minivan can outbrake a superbike too. 

But yeah, I can see where you’re coming from here. We need the ability to go faster in certain situations at least."
starcitizen,feu6ku6,t3_eqln7s,1579383611.0,"Just a few off the top of my head:

Physicalized ship components

Expanded MFD functionality/redesign

Flight model v2 (or would that be v3) with thruster efficiency curves etc.

Ground vehicle driving physics v2

Fully integrated vulcan support

Full persistence

Full dynamic weather

Ship customization v1 - paintjob, naming, decals"

Unexpected,femrmif,t3_epwyos,1579267620.0,Goddamn onion cutting ninjas...
starcitizen,femn8pu,t3_epxl1g,1579263446.0,"Anything with wheels! 

But for actual ships, it would be more capital ships like polaris, Kraken or Idris. Not because I own one or even necessarily want one, it´s the gameplay potential that fascinates me. 

Either as a crew member on board, escort or part of a group that attacks an outlaw Kraken for example. 

What I am most excited about though is getting more details and customizability into the ships that we already have. Meaning paintjobs, physicalized components, etc."
starcitizen,femn0ah,t3_epy6jp,1579263191.0,"Most definitely not! What he does with his channel is completely up to him. This is not like a huge newspaper where you supposedly have to be impartial and objective. This is a fan channel.

starcitizen,feksxtk,t1_fejzs38,1579206944.0,"Very good to know! I will try that next time.

Just did a session on Aberdeen and there were tons of rocks to find! Usually I can fly a few minutes without finding anything. On Aberdeen I found mineable rocks all the time. The only downside is the time it takes to sell from Aberdeen since you have to fly down to Lorville.

But it was fun to find more rocks thepan ever before!"

starcitizen,fejer7l,t1_feje1n1,1579170571.0,"Interesting... I will check out Aberdeen since I have the 100k mining head. I can get most rocks except those close to 8 tons and above. 

My best load on Cellin was 78k so far just a few days ago, have not found any bexalite on cellin yet though. 

I wish we had some kind of mining charge that we could use to split larger rocks or that would help crack them. A 1k gadget that you can use only once, so you have to pick the right rock to use it, and that would make it possible for weaker lasers to crack bigger rocks."

Funny that you mention the NDB-26 Neutron repeater! Just yesterday I have bought 4 NDB-30ies! I use HOTAS so I usually favor fixed size 3 weapons and man do they pack a punch! 

They are a bit limited in terms of range, but I like to get relatively close to my targets anyway. Now I am saving up for some upgraded coolers so I can use them longer in overclocked mode."
starcitizen,feg18rf,t1_fefedjl,1579072598.0,"> Having a reason to earn and spend UEC lends itself to some of great gameplay within the working gameloops. I love it. Great to see others enthusiastic about this too. ;) 

Yes!!! That was the whole point for me too! I suddenly find myself playing SC almost every day now, even if it´s just a quick mining run for 40 minutes or so. I actually look forward to buying these items and trying them out. It has enhanced the game and the joy I get out of it by quite a bit!

Yesterday I got 4 size 3 neutron repeaters for my cuttie and found out that they overheat pretty quickly when you overclock them. Which makes sense since the standard coolers are not really designed to cope with that. 

So now I am looking forward to upgrade my coolers and see what impact that will have etc. etc. 

Haha and good to know about the Breton! I will avoid that like the plague :)"

starcitizen,ff5k7vj,t1_ff5iz28,1579596827.0,"That is completely fair! I guess that is kind of like that with all games. Either it grips you from the getgo or it doesnÂ´t. 

Elite Dangerous certainly has its pros and cons too! Especially VR support weighs heavily in my book. Just choose what makes you happier and go with that :)"
starcitizen,ff5inau,t3_ermb5x,1579594618.0,"I really could not agree less with your two main points. Thruster parallel to the deck is what we see in 95% of scifi shows and there is a reason for that. And I would actually argue for MORE glass in ships, not less. Firstly, itÂ´s a game. And secondly, what the hell do you know about super strong nano-glass tech 900 years in the future? 

I do agree with the cameras, but from what I have heard that is a technical/performance issue, not that they donÂ´t want to do that."

starcitizen,ff5idvp,t3_erp1wc,1579594264.0,"I am yearning for VR support in SC but weÂ´re not there yet. In fact, I would guess that the earliest chance for that is around late 2021. We need full vulkan integration first, and we need the game to run a lot better than it does now. 

It will come, it should be pretty damn mindblowing, but we will have to wait for that. I can recommend Elite Dangerous for your space game VR needs for now, or NMS or Star Trek Bridge Crew."

Not sure about when though. But my gutt says very rough medical gameplay v1 sometime this year (healing others with medpens, dragging wounded people to medbeds etc.) and really detailed medical gameplay not before 2022. 

I could be wrong though!"
starcitizen,ff2xae4,t1_ff2viih,1579527557.0,"Hmm, good point. ItÂ´s a different story on a 890 Jump or even Idris!"
starcitizen,ff2qo0j,t1_ff2q3qi,1579519672.0,"Yesss! Exactly. Broken arm/bullet in the shoulder should make it harder or impossible to aim, maybe you canÂ´t use two handed weapons anymore, only pistols etc. 

At the moment player health works exactly as ship health. You just have a health pool and when that is at zero you die. So you can shoot someone in the foot a few times and they will die. 

Not very realistic at all, but they know that and will fix it. I assume that the new player status system might already tackle that issue."
starcitizen,ff2qkyu,t1_ff2pwj8,1579519546.0,"Hmm very good question. Generally speaking I would advise against third party apps when it comes to controller bindings etc. I personally have made the experience that they tend to make things worse haha. 

I think I would wait for a bit before you tackle that. The devs have recently said that the new MFD UI will be designed so you can easily navigate them with the joystick. So whatever you do now would be moot when that comes online anyway."
starcitizen,ff2pl7f,t3_er43mp,1579518075.0,"Download it and give it a shot! ItÂ´s honestly a pretty cool experience at the moment. At the very least youÂ´ll be able to enjoy it for a few hours and if itÂ´s not for you, then you can deinstall it again. 

But I personally am getting quite a bit of playtime out of the current build, and itÂ´s getting better and better with every patch."
starcitizen,ff2gsua,t1_ff2gimy,1579505495.0,"I am definitely with you on that one! I have discovered upgrading ship components recently which gave me a lot more motivation to earn money and play. But overall we need much, much more to do. 

Being able to transfer cash between players would be a nice way to get some emergent gameplay going."
starcitizen,ff2frld,t1_ff1j67b,1579504257.0,"Kind of through the beacons, but that is more of a workaround then a real mechanic. I really, really hope that we will just get the ability to transfer money directly from player to play through mobiglass. That would solve so many issues. 

I think the personal finance mobiglass app is scheduled for 4.0? Maybe weÂ´ll get something then."
starcitizen,ff2fp39,t1_ff15m8w,1579504177.0,"Hmm, that is a good point actually! Although I donÂ´t think itÂ´s too fast for a boarding situation and only two beds. Plus you can shoot someone in the bed as they canÂ´t move."
starcitizen,ff2fnk7,t1_ff0pa0w,1579504125.0,"That is true! I guess IÂ´d like it to be a bit more realistic. Broken arms or legs shouldnÂ´t kill you, but should make it harder/impossible to shoot or walk. Serious fractures might come with severe blood loss which would have to be stopped short term (medpen) and then treated long term (medbay). 

Obviously bullets to the torso would have a much higher chance of being lethal, bullets to the head would almost always instantly lethal etc.

At the moment player health is like ship health. You can shoot a player in the foot a few times and he will die. There is no logic to it, just a health pool that is being drained."
starcitizen,fez9y7q,t1_fez2you,1579455173.0,Indeed! I really like it. Letâ€™s see what the future holds in that regard when the economy is a bit more refined.

starcitizen,fez2xl7,t3_eqyrix,1579453382.0,"Holy shit, thatâ€™s pretty neat! We definitely need a longer ttk for injuries then. Usually I am dead within a minute or so when I break legs etc.

starcitizen,fez2hnz,t1_fez0euh,1579453238.0,"Yeah, the more I think about it, the more I like it. This could also generate more player made missions to other players.

starcitizen,fez1rkp,t1_fez0eqx,1579453098.0,"Haha yeah I have been there! View settings should be relatively safe though, and you can backup the .ini. Itâ€™s in the user folder.

starcitizen,feyzlxk,t3_eqxpdh,1579452438.0,"First all of all nice mockup!!

I like the idea! Maybe be the price drop could be a bit less, but it would give someone the option to do a bit more legwork in order to save some cash, and others that want the ship faster would still have the option to buy normally."

I wish we had some kind of mining charge that we could use to split larger rocks or that would help crack them. A 1k gadget that you can use only once, so you have to pick the right rock to use it, and that would make it possible for weaker lasers to crack bigger rocks."

Yesterday I got 4 size 3 neutron repeaters for my cuttie and found out that they overheat pretty quickly when you overclock them. Which makes sense since the standard coolers are not really designed to cope with that.
