There have been plenty of articles and explanations from native peoples of how this kind of stuff is offensive and disrespectful, regardless of the person “intends” to offend or not."

dogs,fe9y6h1,t1_fe9kx80,1578942513.0,OP isn't necessarily trying to teach socialization - at least not with this post. They are trying to walk their dog.
dogs,fe9l6c7,t3_eo5ud3,1578938982.0,"I don't have any good advise for you here, just wanted to say I agree and I HATE this. This happens at a few places we go for hikes/walks (that specifically say dogs must be leashed), quite frequently. And the owner's excuses are always: ""don't worry, he/she's friendly."" COOL - mine isn't. He has leash reactivity and WILL react badly to your dog coming bounding up to us unleashed and wild. It's SO inconsiderate. 

We even have our dog wearing a yellow bandanna on most walks because it's supposed to be a ""stay away"" color but we have found most people don't know or don't care to pay attention."
dogs,fe9kupc,t1_fe9gk33,1578938779.0,OP should be able to walk her dog without worrying about other people's dog coming up to OP's. Multiple or even daily trips to the dog park aren't plausible for most people.  It seems OP has an understanding of leash reactivity and does what is needed to protect themselves and their dog- doesn't mean the pup shouldn't be allowed to go for walks.
bulletjournal,fdhogm9,t1_fdhk4u8,1578426960.0,"One person literally said ""too much sex""

But go off..."
bulletjournal,fdho0gh,t1_fdhjj9o,1578426694.0,"Then it's a good thing this post isn't about you or your sex life. 

You have no idea if OP had permission to share this or not. And if you want to feel embarrassed by talking about sex, that's your prerogative. But clearly the OP doesn't - and shouldn't - because it's literally a marking that sexual intercourse was had - OP didn't give any salacious details."
bulletjournal,fdgx091,t1_fdgtxsm,1578410406.0,"We don't know that the OP isn't doing that as well. We also don't know that the OP *wants* to have that data. This is just OP's bullet journal, on a bullet journal sub."
suggestmeabook,fcyj294,t1_fcy3ojn,1578080896.0,Not OP - but these sound awesome - Thanks!
suggestmeabook,fcy3g1h,t3_ejhwlf,1578074255.0,"Some of my favorites:

The Alice Network (about a group of women spies in WWII / based on true stories)

Killers of the Flower Moon (it's nonfiction but reads like a novel about the American Indigenous murders in Oklahoma (?) and the birth of the FBI. 

The Air You Breathe (not necessarily historical fiction but \*could\* fall under that category - spans the lifetime of two girls/women from Brazil who grow up to be singers)

Orphan Train (based on an American welfare system during the great depression that used to send orphans on trains to the parts of the country - follows the story of a young girl who was an orphan).

The Book Thief (told from the POV of death, follows a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany). 

The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead (it has a bit of magical realism \[i.e. the UR is an actual railroad\] but the essential story is about a young slave who escapes and her challenges to avoid being found by slave catchers)."
SkincareAddiction,fcoawtj,t3_ei9128,1577827781.0,I've tried it! I used to work in a spa and got the treatment a handful of times. I have \*very\* dry skin in the winter and it helped with that a lot! I've since found a better skin care routine but can't say I wouldn't try it again!
