polyamory,ffa5onq,t3_eshmg2,1579728383.0,"I (nonbinary but generally read as a slightly masculine woman) was in a triad with two trans women for a minute. It was honestly pretty normal? I believe we came off as so unusual that judgmental people wouldn't get within a half mile radius of us. Which, hey, that works.

Edit: I forgot that one or two people did hardcore fetishize us, which was unfortunate. We mostly did not spend a lot of time with them."
polyamory,ffa3ylh,t3_esh6e4,1579727412.0,"The answers to your questions are very subjective and will vary between poly people. Here's my two cents, though:   


1. I actually started my journey into a polyamory as a fairly jealous person. My relationships up to that point had been pretty codependent. Following these, I did a lot of reflection and ultimately realized that not only did I want to be in less restricting relationships, I specifically wanted to be in relationships that had *little to no* sense of possessiveness. 
2. As you might imagine, this transition was pretty difficult. In fact, I do still get jealous from time to time. However, these days I view jealousy less as a sign that something is wrong and more as an unwanted emotional response to things that are not inherently threatening to me or my relationship. Viewing jealousy that way makes it much easier to deal with.
3. Personally, my desire to have multiple partners stems not from the feeling that one partner is lacking in an important area but from the simple fact that love is really nice. You can have three partners and your relationship with each of them will be completely unique. Without intending to sound disrespectful, someone asking why I would want more partners when my friends can fulfill my needs is sort of like asking why I would want more friends when my family can fulfill my needs! To me, it's not about what specific things I can get from people, it's about forging meaningful connections more generally."

Contrapointsdrama,fd4809v,t1_fd3v6ri,1578165221.0,"Another commenter beat me to a response, but I'll add that some mtf/ftm people actually *do* think that ""trans"" and ""nonbinary"" should be considered separate categories. It's a known point of contention. Not that much contention, though. Even people who disagree on this matter generally get along.

Another interesting point is that some nonbinary people do report feelings of dysphoria. They may be uncomfortable in their body while not actively desiring the body of another sex. I'm probably not the best person to explain this, though.

Ultimately, what ""nonbinary"" is depends on what ""gender"" is, and there's no real consensus about that!"
