news,ffjnewm,t1_ffjmgc8,1580002284.0,It varies by state and by municipality. Where I live cops start at $35k and it goes up from there. Where OP is from is not the norm for the entire country.
Ulta,ffd3zmw,t3_esz999,1579812973.0,My Colourpop Nude Mood palette arrived today and I was wondering if I should contact Ulta about the ill pressed pan and get an exchange or even if they'd do that. I have several other CP palettes and haven't had this problem. If anybody thinks the pan will hold up and won't fall out that's great! I've never had to return or exchange anything at Ulta before so idk if this is even necessary. Thanks!

BeautyBoxes,ff9znn9,t3_esgedg,1579724915.0,"That's what I thought was going on, got downvoted anyway, ha.

I've believed for awhile now that these companies, despite the low cost of production and high profit, don't want to lose the money they rake in and will *sometimes* skimp out on quality in order to get not only new customers but save money as well.

Not saying *all* of them do this but now we have an actual example of this happening."
BeautyBoxes,ff843rr,t1_ff802aj,1579665463.0,I'm just simply asking is all. My bad.
worldnews,ff83zup,t1_ff7w2qn,1579665383.0,"Is that why when I clicked the link it made me wait and downloaded something? I have Firefox if that means anything. Sorry, technologically illiterate."
BeautyBoxes,ff7z895,t1_ff7yi0d,1579661899.0,"I don't see how they get away with that. I refuse to buy certain things off Amazon for that reason, or Walmart online, because of the third party sellers. How could a big company like this get away with selling from unauthorized retailers when they market this stuff so heavily? You'd think the actual companies would stop them. Doesn't that count as selling counterfeits?"
BeautyBoxes,ff7xvmi,t1_ff7vuku,1579660958.0,They would be in some hot ass water if they were buying from unauthorized retailers and the actual company found out. I don't buy that. To me it's much more likely that the actual company skimped out on their supplier so they wouldn't lose money but still get their name and product out there. But maybe not.
