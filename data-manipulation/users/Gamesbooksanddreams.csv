They won’t give anyone fries that aren’t fresh but you can’t serve a packed restaurant fast enough if you make them to order so you drop them when people walk in the door or at least toss more fries in the basket. A lot of the time you end up in a situation where you’ve got another like quarter bag of fries left and just dropped more so you just toss them in that order and keep it moving. The scoop you use for the fries is enormous as well.
