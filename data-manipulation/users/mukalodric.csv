explainlikeimfive,ffjom69,t1_ffjoak4,1580003094.0,Thanks! This makes me want to take more math in college so I can understand it.

EngineeringStudents,ffjn694,t3_ets626,1580002120.0,"For me Calc II was like going to a martial arts class where every day they teach you 2-3 new and unrelated moves, then by the end of the class you're expected to know all of them like the back of your hand.

I did well in it by practicing it to death. During those lulls in the semester where certain weeks felt lazy/uneventful, I would be spending that extra free time crunching partial fractions and series convergence problems."
college,fe11ncm,t3_eniivy,1578821439.0,"I know a lot of people who don't lock their doors, so it's more common among college students than you may think. This is especially true for the richer college students who have lived in low-crime suburban areas and never cared about things like theft much. But just because it's common doesn't mean it's common sense.

Bring this up with an RA or some other higher-up if they refuse to adhere to locking the room."
getdisciplined,fdzei5c,t3_eng02v,1578789450.0,"Fly back to college, get over the tremendous jet-lag, and take care of stuff like doing laundry, buying stuff at Target, etc. Basically enjoy the last few days of winter break and get some errands done so that I can start the next semester off well."

Major: Engineering & Computer Science

Calculus I: A (credit by exam)

Calculus II: A+

English I: A

Even though the first semester at my college is pass-fail because of some policy, I'm very glad with how I did over my first semester of college in a new continent, living alone for the first time at 18. Next semester I'm trying to spend less time studying, because I felt like I could have taken a lot more hours off without really seeing a drop in my grade."
college,fdypgt4,t3_ene0nf,1578782225.0,"Totally dependent on the college you go to. Some only accept students to a specific school such as Engineering or Business, where you have to apply to the other schools if you want to switch later on. Some don't make you declare a major at all until a few semesters down the line, so this wouldn't be a problem anyway.

You should look up the specific rules for the college(s) you're looking at. Asking a member of the registrar's office or something in an email would never hurt. Generally though, it's a lot easier to start in STEM and get out than the other way round."
nosurf,fdyfrp4,t3_emkp3k,1578779322.0,"When you go on Screen Time, it shows how much time you've spent on each app for the week. Tap on any one of the apps you're trying to block, and an option should come up that says ""Add limit"" or something like that. From there you can add a limit for that specific app (and as many more as you want to pick) as well as specific websites in Safari.

What I said might not be perfect because I'm only saying it from memory and I actually haven't gone on Screen Time in a long time because my password is with a family member."
nosurf,fdybv2n,t3_en8jn4,1578778098.0,"I reduced my time online by hours a week when I started college and committed to studying a lot for my courses. So yeah, you can push out the online time if you fill your hours with some other activity.  The problem with this is that it requires you to apply willpower every day, at least at first. This can be hard on days where you already have a lot on your plate, but with a set limit, you make the decision once and it's non-negotiable.

There's also a problem with time limits, though. You're leaving a hole in your day where all the hours on the Internet used to be. If you don't have much to replace it with, you will quickly head to activities that pretty much resemble the thing you're trying to quit, such as excessive gaming, binge-watching, etc.

My two cents? I think the two things go hand in hand. You need to consciously decide that spending less time on the Internet is what you want, but you also need to create an environment that makes it easier to reach this goal (i.e. by replacing the gap in your day with some fulfilling activity) and keep yourself accountable with rules like ""Only go on Facebook for 20 minutes a day."""
college,fdsctaq,t3_emrlt6,1578699690.0,"Everyone has a different opinion about college. Here's mine put simply: college is 4 years where you are open to the most opportunities you will probably ever be in life. Some of these opportunities can lead you to become the best version of yourself, and many can lead you to become the worst. But you'll be thrilled at how much autonomy you will have over your future. That for me is the best thing about college (it's why I'm raring to go back right now but I'm on winter break :P)"
realmadrid,fdaygys,t1_fda7kqo,1578251794.0,"I won't hate haha, I also had to learn about it. We were basically dead in the league until a series of events led to everything going our way and ended in Espanyol making a comeback against Barcelona near the end of the season."
college,fd9ze4u,t3_ekehjt,1578239862.0,"Aside from STEM majors being bitter, I think there are a couple other reasons too. First, a lot of non-STEM graduates do actually end up finding it more difficult to get a job straight out of undergrad. This doesn't mean that majoring in STEM will make you swim in job offers; like every degree you have to market yourself and accumulate useful skills. But it does help perpetuate the ""non-STEM bad"" stereotype.

There are some students who just go to college to have fun, party, and get an easy degree so they don't study too much. STEM students see these people and feel like this is unfair. In particular I've noticed that non-STEM degrees aren't seen by many as degrees that can take you up from working-class to middle-class. I've talked to a lot of people who think most people studying humanities are rich kids who are going to get good jobs no matter what, purely because their parents know important people. Not saying this is true but there you go."
realmadrid,fd9vbxz,t1_fd9rq7b,1578238455.0,"It's a very cheap and pointless thing to brag about but it's not meaningless. Since that crazy 06/07 season, the league leaders at the halfway point have gone on to win the title 10/12 times."
EngineeringStudents,fd8mo9g,t1_fd7erwf,1578220310.0,"Thanks for the response man. Tbh I'm not really looking at a dual degree to get paid more, it's more to get a taste of another field while keeping a lot more doors open in terms of jobs I can apply to straight out of college."
getdisciplined,fd4wnwp,t1_fd4f0x2,1578171757.0,"Of course, would be super stoked if something I say ends up helping someone :)

Planning my days like this has been a game-changer for me since I started college to be honest. My goal moving forward is to plan out all 52 weeks of 2020, even if I'm occasionally only able to jot down a few tiny things. Good luck with all of your endeavors!"
nosurf,fd3flrj,t1_fd26ntu,1578157811.0,That's true. It gets exponentially harder the more you cut down but I hope where I'm at rn keeps up.
college,fd3f7lw,t1_fd2euvu,1578157692.0,"That's the spirit haha. It's nice hearing that someone else managed to pull off what I'm trying to do. Two of my courses are kind of easy A's and three are pretty challenging. I have to take a bit of an overload to graduate on time and I reckon I better take it before junior/senior years while the courses are still not that tough.

Let's get this bread!"
college,fd1oq59,t3_ejqfr2,1578134414.0,You don't need a degree in theater to do acting but you pretty much need a STEM degree for a job in the field. So if I'm in your shoes I'm majoring in a science and picking up theater through electives and extracurriculars. There's also the option of taking a minor.
college,fd1nm4n,t1_fd0iyy4,1578133879.0,Also use what you learn for personal projects and whatnot.
getdisciplined,fd14myn,t3_ejsn3g,1578127523.0,"I put assignments and things that repeat every week (gym, classes, office hours, etc) on my Google Calendar.

Then every Sunday, I write in a little notebook with the help of the Calendar to form a general idea of what the next 7 days should look like. I'll put specific things to do each day and occasionally an overall goal for the week.

Then every evening I just through it and see what I should do the next day. I put that down as 3-4 little bulletpoints on a to-do list app. Next morning, I look at the list and commit it to memory.

Whole process only takes about 5 minutes a day but hey it works."
college,fd11osn,t3_ejtpmr,1578126587.0,"You can go for a test run in the first two weeks of the semester and see if you can handle it, keeping in mind that the last month of the semester will be a lot more hectic. My guess from reading your post is that money is not too tight and education comes first, so you can always drop or reduce your hours for the serving job if it becomes too much.

I'm trying to do something similar with 20 credit hours and 14 hours working part-time. My plan is to do it all in the first 2 weeks. After that, I have the choices of taking the job down to 8-10 hours and pass-failing one of my courses to ease the load as needed. Bottom line is you can make marginal changes instead of going all-or-nothing."
college,fd0yuri,t1_fczi6u0,1578125633.0,That's the spirit man let's goooo
college,fcywwm9,t1_fcunmjx,1578088869.0,I think you'll do fine. I'm doing something similar but two of the courses are relatively easy (I know around a third of the material for both already) and I might do another pass-fail. Just take it one day at a time I guess.
college,fctwd86,t3_eiuyys,1577962916.0,"Depends on what you’ve got along with it I guess. Do you party frequently, have a job, or want to juggle extracurriculars? Those are all factors.

I know someone who did 22 and a bunch of clubs and he was just fine, though he compromised grades a bit."
