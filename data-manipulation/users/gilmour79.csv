Still had some issues towards the end but nothing horrible. You can tell the original must have been horrible when the update file was much larger than the original install file. I feel bad for any gamer who has to struggle through a buggy game."
assassinscreed,ff4t0vy,t1_ff3odul,1579571743.0,"I loved Unity. It's what got me back into the AC games. I'd given up after AC1 as the game was so glitchy. I couldnt finish and just figured I sucked as a gamer. Than my brother was like, try this one, its supposedly the worst in the franchise. I though dude, that's an odd recommendation. So I tried it. Whew man! I played over 150 hours of this game and loved every moment. Now I'm playing Syndicate and while I like that game I dont find the main story as engaging as Unity was."

ketorecipes,feyla0q,t1_few9r4p,1579447100.0,Have the same problem myself. I cant process grains at all which is sorta why I turned to keto to help with my digestive issues. But how that they're cleared up it's hard to find products that wont tear up my stomach anymore. I wind up making a ton of my own stuff and its just not an easy process.

I mean I played heavily story driven games like beyond two souls and Detroit become human and loved them but I wasnt into anything really with combat. My brother insisted this was the greatest game hes ever played. I started playing it and after 30 hours I was so stuck I gave up. Told him it wasnt my thing. So I went and played AC Unity. I know I know, it's the one everyone loves to hate but Ioved the game. When i was done i was like, lemme try the witcher again. 278 hours later i can say that is hands down the greatest game I've ever played. I bought an xbox so i could play 2 and carry it over to 3 which i also bought on xbox as well (have it on ps4 originally) even my kid fell in love with the game and wants it for her switch now too."

interestingasfuck,fegey5k,t1_fefq2yx,1579090442.0,"Exactly. My employer is right by the military base. We share a runway with the local airport do we can taxi out plane parts with our cargo planes so when the jets normally go to run drills or whatever they do you can hear some ""warm up"" noises usually theres some warning to the takeoff as is very very loud. That morning I was walking through the parking lot when they shot off the runway. Normally theres 3 max. Only time we've ever seen 6 was when it was an air show and they fly overhead doing cool tricks for hours a few days before the show. This was more like the jumped in cold and took off. The noise seemed a hell of a lot louder than normal. I was like what the heck crazy guys. No idea what was going on. When I'd left the house the radio said a plane had flown into one of the towers. It sounded at first reports like it was a crop duster who maybe wasn't quite at his best that morning. I remember thinking poor guy, hope no one is seriously hurt. When I got in the building the TVs were all on and I looked up as the showed the 2nd plane impact and the reporters freaking shit on live tv. The whole dang room went quiet than it wasnt long after they said a bomb was reported in a dc parking lot then the PA plane, then the Pentagon.  The base went on lockdown,  the aircraft companies went on high alert here...it was probably the most scared I've ever been. Even an active shooter or the dude running from the police that was armed and in the property wasnt as scary as that week."
interestingasfuck,fefmit6,t3_eovlph,1579059540.0,I work in the air capital. Planes are something we ALWAYS hear. It was scary as crap tho when 6 fighter jets were scrambled by 9am and even weirder when it was dead silent for days after. Not a single plane in the sky. It was the most eerie silence I've ever experienced.

Documentaries,fdq9vvf,t1_fdpijvj,1578660598.0,"We only have 2 options here. 1 conservative, one reform. The conservative one was nicer but I dont really fall in line with some of their stuff, not that it's bad just is a little restrictive. They were surprisingly far more welcoming than the reform temple. We are in the midwest so there just isnt a lot if options. So I just sorta do my own thing. It sorta stinks tho because you dont get that sense of community that way."
Documentaries,fdpi3va,t1_fdphqf8,1578629230.0,"I also need to put out there that I'm a single parent, blonde haired, blue eyed, tattooed (tho not heavily but some are visable) and opinionated. I didnt fit the mold there, and I knew I wouldn't and it wasnt bad at first but when it became clear that my options to elevate myself would be zero there it soured things. Plus holy crap there were some incredibly fricken rude people who would seriously glare at me and turn away from me. I work in a customer centric IT role and piss people off for a living, yet I've never been treated as poorly as I was by people at the temple. Which is sad, because with others they accept there is a warmth there that is beautiful,  but to an outsider it's pretty hostile."
Documentaries,fdphqf8,t1_fdnue50,1578628944.0,"I'm religiously jewish. It's my choice. But going to synagogue is out of the question. We went for full 2 years and were simply treated like crap. No one wanted anything to do with us since we were not born and raised jewish. It didn't matter that I followed the mitzvot and knew all the prayers and did the observances. I was an unwelcome imposter. Even the rabbi who is a nice enough man refused to speak to me when I asked about the process of conversion. He just gave me this look, said something condescending and walked off. In fact from then on he would mostly only speak to my daughter and ignore me. Little over 2 years later I left the temple. The I'm better than you attitude was horribly depressing. To be totally honest, even tho my beliefs still align to a mostly jewish ideology the treatment turned me off terribly from ever engaging with a temple again. There were a few nicer older people whom I adored but anyone younger than 7ish treated me like garbage."

In the books she is borderline obsessed with Geralt even tho Yen is her best friend. Plus in the books Geralt is kinda an ass to Yennifer, it's no wonder shes skeptical about letting him back in to her life each time. Yen truly cares about Geralt the books show so many times how she sends money to villages where he takes contracts so that he can be paid a living wage instead if the pitiful sums he gets for such deadly jobs. It's all in the books. If you read them you get plenty of time in Triss's headspace and boy itll change your opinion a lot from the game. Plus it explains Geralt and Yen's fate, they really are destined to be together. The game while absolutely amazing, does a sorta so so job fleshing out the Triss/Yen characters and their motivations and mechanisms.  This us well fleshed out in the books and while I'm only just now finishing book 5 its dramatically changed the way I look at the choices I made when I first started the play through and thought yennifer was just some hunch back beast who used glamour or something ridiculous.  Didnt know the characters or the back story. Part of the reason why I look forward to the 2nd playthrough so I can right my wrongs."
