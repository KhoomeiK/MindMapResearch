I still don't fully disagree with the "">1% has this so it's not a disease"", but I also think that that displays our discussion well. Some people might think that certain polymorphisms are a problem, even though other people might not think it's a problem.

So which types do you treat? I and II are a pretty clear yes, but type III can cause some major discomforts later in life, so although it's not life-threatening, would you treat that as well?
