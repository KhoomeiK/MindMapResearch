I didn't like the Battle of the Bastards from the very first time I saw it.  Season 7 was just abysmal, what with one handed Jaime getting saved from dragon fire in the very nick of time, falling into a lake in full plate armor, yet somehow getting dragged to the entire other side of the lake without drowning nor without any dothraki riding them down after they literally just were in striking distance of killing the queen they worshipped.  Venturing north of the wall to find a wight, then getting into a hopeless battle with them to have Dany arrive literally not one second too late, wow great timing all the way from dragon stone to north of the wall what are the odds!  Jon snow getting dragged into hypothermic temperature waters in full fur, then somehow surfacing, dragging his soaked heavy ass out over slippery ice, then once again being saved in just the last calculated second by Benjen, who apparently can't carry him on a horse and decides to pointlessly stay behind and die.

Dalvin Cook who's never completed a single season healthy is too high for me.  I'm definitely not taking him before a proven year after year back like Zeke, and I'd probably take the likes of Nick Chubb and Derrick Henry before him.

On that note, Nick Chubb is going way too late.  Hunt may or may not depart, if he departs I'd argue he should be taken top 3.  Otherwise still he should be taken 4-6 range.  

There are *wayyyy* too many WRs in that late round 1 range.  People really don't seem to learn their lesson in that regard.  Aaron Jones, Nick Chubb, Derrick Henry, Joe Mixon, Kenyan Drake, Chris Carson all going later than them is criminal.  Austin Ekeler looks like an absolute steal at his adp, and there's no way in hell I'd draft Melvin Gordon ahead of him.  WR I'd be targetting would be rd 3-4 steals like DJ Moore, Lockett, Sutton, AJ Brown, Chark, Tyler Boyd.  You'll be far better off going RB RB and then picking up a WR like that then blowing your first round pick on a WR that even if they do well, get you plenty of goose eggs throughout the season."
