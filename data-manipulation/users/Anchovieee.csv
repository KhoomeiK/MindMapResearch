Take it on the chin now if you can, or ""fight"" them. Iirc, if you pay before the court date it's all good. I passed a bus a while back in a spot I didnt know was a crosswalk (no crosswalk paint, but a 5' median) and contested it  it took them a year to get me a date and I gave up and paid. It was a half mile from where I teach, and I promise you I'll never make that mistake again.

After college, I moved back in with my grandma. We'd loved in with my grandparents unknown to us when I was 12 (it was a surprise and we only had what wed taken on vacation with us) and my mom moved in when I was 16. Her drug abuse tore the house apart, my brother's issues got worse, and I'd already gotten my first job to pull my weight in the house by then.

Moving back home to teach in a well paying county really screwed me over because of family issues, and therapy and meds helped. Moving out helped even more haha."

A weird thing was one of the elementary schools I  taught at had a gun threat, and we were on lockdown for 2 hours. I hid behind some mirrors in a closet since my coworker and I didnt have kids at the time. I was kinda hoping to be shot.

I drove home, and it hit me how angry and sad I was at the reactions my students had, and I pulled over and just sobbed for about 30 minutes. That was probably the most I felt in months. 

Then again, I was diagnosed with dysthymia, and my baseline for emotion is pretty low in general. That being said, when I get into depressive episodes (almost unheard of now thank god!) I could barely move, among a lot of other unsavory activities."

NoStupidQuestions,ffaqzw9,t3_esll3i,1579742451.0,"2 and 3, maybe you're not aware of the social climate?

I'm very gregarious and love to talk to strangers, but I usually keep it to jokes. Aside from that. Folks like to be doted on, so I keep the conversation to what they've brought up, if anything.

It also helps that I'm a small woman with a forceful personality. I'm non threatening but bold enough to be a ""character"". I'm also keeeeenly aware of when I'm fucking up a situation. If I do without realizing, I chalk it up as a small loss, and move on.

You cant win everything.

I feel like at least with question 1, Boeing awkward in 2 or 3 can make people less likely to engage. If you're online. phrasing is veeeeery important. A lot of honest questions about touchy subjects can come off as rude or uninformed based on your wording.

Earnest is very hard to get across online, and some things about race or religion can be sort of explained if you do the research on your own. 

Be aware of your sources, and look up any other times folks have asked that question. See where people gave them trouble, and learn from what answers they got. Take that knowledge to help you steer the question.

Aside from that, understand that curiosity can be intimidating, and asking marginalized groups (POC, LGBT, niche social groups wtc) questions may set something off if you're not familiar with the issues they already face.

Example: I teach elementary art, and there are SO many topics I run into at staff meetings that seem obvious to me. ""Why shouldnt you touch someones hair?"" Or ""you should make sure you're saying your students name correclty""

Those seem like basic things to do when interacting with someone, but apparently not enough, since it's part of my training.

I hope some of that helps at all.

For 4, maybe you havent found your style of joke. I like dirty jokes, but prefer wordplay to anything. I was losing my mind earlier after sharing my favorite k cup flavor with a coworker. I reach into my mailbox and pull out a papa John's garlic cup. That still kills me. Depends on your sense of humor and curating what you see to things you like."

I rarely got to see my husband or spend time with him, and you're limited in social activities because you have to do the work grind all over again in the morning.

The stress piles up, and it would make errands completely impossible. The likelihood you're awake at the time a limited convenience place is open (dentist, doctor, mechanic, bank) is slim, and your have to rely on other folks to do things you cant.

His parents didn't have him evaluated by a doctor in time, and he eventually died in his sleep.
