AskReddit,fepiko9,t3_eq48n1,1579321418.0,My grandmother passed away the year before I was born. But my mom would tell me stories of how her mom's family were rich because they owned a business where they import and export goods. My grandmother's dad would have her export shipments at midnight to avoid taxes and he gave her a pistol to carry with her in case she runs into any issues. I wished I got to meet her and hear her stories.
Damnthatsinteresting,feenh8m,t1_fedn8zx,1579037318.0,It's true. When my mom was suffering from ALS complications I wanted to rush her to the ER in an ambulance but due to the cost my mom even told me to just called an Uber to drive us there. Fortunately we made it there in time and our Uber driver was extremely helpful in helping my mom get into the ER room together with me.

I’m claustrophobic so the entire time I was reading this I was horrified! This also reminded me of the movie “As Above, So Below”. I would still love to see the movie version of this story if anyone ever does it"
