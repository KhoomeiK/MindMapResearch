darksouls3,ffg9j2d,t3_etfzv8,1579901375.0,I think there might be a reason why judicators wear those long robes
darksouls3,ff3zizw,t3_erh9sb,1579552271.0,"I’m currently having a blast with 40/40 int/faith pyromancer with rest pumped into vitality, endurance and just enough attunement to equip 3 spells : black serpent, black flame and fire bed vestiges. I use mostly demons scar, but sometimes I switch to chaos claymore. Poking is great, due to black serpent (people are usually bad at dodging it if you put enough pressure)and quick demons scar running atacks, also weapon art, which is very underrated imo.  Armor is default, I use mix of ringed knight armor with some light legs and dark damage enhancing head gear. Wear both pyromancy enhancing rings, spell casting speed enhancing ring and dark (or fire)clutch ring or RoFaP. With this build you can poke with spells or running attacks or weapon art, hit massive damage with fire bed vestiges and you are pretty strong in melee when you get familiar with demons scar move set. Not to mention roughly 500 damage and stagger with black flame which is probably the way I win 3/4 of fights or invasions. Pretty good with dealing with ganks too if u bait them into black flame or fire bed vestiges. I also keep a small shield in offhand just in case I meet some r2 spamming guy, but most of the time I twohand demons scar. Obviously with claymore you have to rearrange the build to meet equipment load conditions, which results in wearing lighter armor and pyromancer glove in offhand."

darksouls3,ff044j9,t3_eqxqov,1579464981.0,"1.Game lacks super rare armors and weapons. For example as a reward for giving 500 covenant items. Nothing op, but something very unique. 

2. I know there is some kind of magic of dark souls way of storytelling but sometimes story should be more directly presented to player.

3. 1st phase of nameless king is easier than any ringed knight

4. Siegward  clumsy ass annoys me 

5. PvP is something I enjoy the most, but comparing to pve aspect of the game it is fucking poorly done. 

Still love the game tho ;)"
corgi,fekajm4,t1_fejt74j,1579196020.0,Thanks for replies :) back to learning we go!
corgi,fejt74j,t3_epi4d5,1579185256.0,"How did you teach him/her to use it? I am trying to teach my 5 month old to use Ifetch, but so far she’s done it once by accident, usually she’s just scratching the toy or barking at it :D 
It’s pretty complex thing for dog to understand, maybe I’ll have to wait until she grows up some more. But anyway, any tips?"
bloodborne,fegxmfl,t3_ep17ez,1579104805.0,"Although I love bloodborne I enjoyed sekiro even more. The most satisfying combat ever. Being a experienced dark souls and bb player sekiro made me feel like a newbie again just like 1st dark souls play through due to difference in combat dynamics. It’s an amazing game, really recommend you to try it."
slaythespire,fe9ji1b,t3_eo673o,1578938195.0,"Yeah, I’m A18 with silent and have around 250 hours. I guess I’m too greedy, 50% of my runs end in act 1 due to risky plays."
darksouls3,fdvx4ki,t3_en780e,1578752699.0,"Same, I did two full runs during last month and pvp was active all the time. I loved it"
darksouls3,fdry92d,t3_emwztr,1578691482.0,"Chaos claymore works great, onyx blade, demon scar - my favourite."
darksouls3,fdh0urm,t3_el8uav,1578412929.0,Amazing. I’d love to have this hung as a poster in my house.
darksouls3,fcywgc4,t3_ejjpf1,1578088583.0,"Gael, dancer, abyss watchers, nameless king and friede. Can’t pick one."
darksouls3,fcv5j0o,t3_eiy451,1577995076.0,"Twin demons. Honestly i have no big problem with any boss (well midir is tough too) during any normal run, but there’s something during that fight that always makes me die few times. I think the reason behind it is that their health pool is significantly bigger then any other boss before and it makes me rushing and playing greedy in order to kill them as fast as other bosses before. But for example pontiff for me is super easy, I had big trouble with him on 1st play through but right now I know all his moves by heart and this fight is really fluid and easy for me."
darksouls3,fcv4tm1,t3_eiyr5i,1577994664.0,I bought the game 2 weeks ago and being Aldrich Faithful is constant invasion after invasion. Also summon signs are common in most areas. Right now playing through ringed city for an hour or so and got invaded twice. It’s unexpectedly active.
bloodborne,fbxeecx,t1_fbw4bke,1577182995.0,"Yes, i lock on both."
