""You're poor. You choose to buy cheap food and housing."" No, I buy cheap food and housing because I'm poor.

""You work in customer service. You choose to deal with angry customers."" Yeah I know it's part of the job but I'm not choosing to have angry customers.

""You live in Florida. You choose to live with Florida Man."" Are you kidding me, no, that's just a weird side effect.

Just because there's a slight bad part of my job doesn't mean I'm going to leave it for something else. I can be unhappy with a policy and express that unhappiness, but to expect a perfect situation is unrealistic and you know it."
Showerthoughts,ffckqq7,t1_ffcijc7,1579801540.0,"Actually if it was up to me, I'd wear a generic store tag rather than one with my name on it. I think the reasons we have our names on them is because it helps us seem more human/less like unfeeling machines, and that a customer can identify us if they need to pass on a compliment or complaint, which I understand.

Personally I like having a little personal space between myself and customers. Wearing a name tag isn't something I've chosen, my dude."
Showerthoughts,ffchfdp,t1_ffcg8jn,1579799527.0,"Oh, well then great! If you talk anyway and are already friendly, then that's a nice change of pace from the norm!

I suppose I was trying to say was that when people I don't recognize use my name to try to act like we're already friends, it comes off as uncomfortable. If it's someone you see frequently enough that you'll recognize each other, then I don't think it's strange as long as you yourself aren't acting, um, \*too\* friendly. But it doesn't sound like you're doing anything wrong. 

I hope this whole thing didn't sour you to treating people with kindness! Have a nice day, come again!"
gifs,ffcf6jy,t1_ffcevvs,1579798148.0,"Oh no I'm sorry, that's not what I was talking about. I meant the throwing around of harsh language, calling people fucktards, that sort of thing. It isn't the language of someone who's actually trying to have a calm, rational conversation about important topics. Arguing angrily =/= arguing well, my friend."
gifs,ffcdw7x,t1_ffc9pr7,1579797355.0,Son you need to chill out and relax a bit. You're getting pretty worked up over this and you're starting to sling around insults which only makes you look like you can't keep yourself under control or argue well.
Showerthoughts,ffc7q4m,t1_ffc635z,1579793465.0,"Sometimes customers think that by using the name they see on your nametag, they're being friendly and personal. Unfortunately, it comes off as strange, because you're calling me by my first name like you know me, but I have no idea who you are. We're required to wear name tags, but when customers use them it feels like, ""Who are you and why do you know my name"""
videos,fek6et2,t1_fek5y4e,1579193574.0,"They're just so big. With a huge company like that and tens of thousands of content creators, it's impossible to look at every single case individually, which is why they tried automating the process. Turns out though, people can abuse the system they put in place. Clearly a different system is needed to process copyright claims."
aww,fdprcmc,t1_fdpl7kn,1578637557.0,"They're clearly stunted in some way. It's like seeing a bay weiner dog and thinking, ""It only looks like that because it's a puppy.""  
No, it's obviously not just a normal kitten."
aww,fdpr19i,t1_fdpqs66,1578637232.0,"Seeing what we've done in regards to Pugs, I'm totally fine with the resistance to Muchkin cats even if it's not the same thing. It'll create a demand for unhealthy standards."
aww,fdf9s0j,t1_fdf95nr,1578356632.0,"It does *appear* to be, but it is not. Check out  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardwolf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardwolf)  to see more pictures of adorable aardwolves! Aardwolfs?"
aww,fdf8gqf,t1_fdf81vx,1578355743.0,"Hi Bot! I just want to say that the person who posted this image called it a hyena, and I'm personally offended that someone was wrong on the internet. I've already called in to work to let them know I won't be in tomorrow because I have to right this wrong. Thank you and enjoy your meal!"
aww,fdf7qxt,t3_ekzkdp,1578355261.0,"I'm curious. Did you find this picture and think, ""That sort of looks like a hyena. It's a hyena. I'm going to tell people it's a hyena,"" Or did something else happen? Because that's not a hyena."
FreezingFuckingCold,fcarbxe,t3_egu5ko,1577575087.0,I slid out multiple times on my drive to work. Roads were so awful that we nearly closed for the day.

I'm not very social and I'll take any excuse to get away from family for a while, and they give me flak if I'm alone on my phone vs alone reading. Yay."
