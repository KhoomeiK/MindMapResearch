Clinton was really good at this too.    


Sanders has one argument that he thinks sways people. And that's economic inequality. Every other facet of his campaign hinges on economic inequality. The reason Bernie brings every single question he's asked back to his stump speech has nothing to do with his ability to talk about other topics, it's because he knows every second in front of a camera is a chance to come right back to the topic that works best for him with the most voters."

Iowa's not a great example for voter turnout because every year it becomes redder, older, and whiter. It's a conservative, old, white state where most voters don't fit the demographic of the country as a whole. Bernie does best with voters under 40, who are a larger demographic in the country as a whole than in Iowa. He also does best with minorities, of which Iowa has precious few.   


And he *still* managed to win Iowa.   


I am definitely a Bernie supporter, but I like to think that I'm one who doesn't get overhyped by some warped statistics. If Bernie won Iowa (a state where his message doesn't mesh well with the demographics), what do you think he'll do in a state that's more reflective of the country as a whole? What do you think he'll do in a state that has a large minority population, or a large segment of younger voters?

They brought on some analyst who explained Bloomberg's strategy and how it compares and contrasts with other candidates (the Super Tuesday strategy he's pursuing). They had a number of people comment how fucked it is that a billionaire literally thinks he can buy the election this time around, and they pointed out the major flaws in his campaign (which is that he doesn't have grassroots support, just well-paid staffers). They also talked about some genuine strengths and advantages for Bloomberg, which for a lot of voters is his wealth. He can bankroll his entire campaign from start to finish if he has to; in our current election system, that is a massive strength, as wrong as it is.

It does make him less of a person to me. Feeling obligated to defend him as a person because of his legendary status as a player seems wrong-headed.

You can't shout ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater. You can't harass your coworker in the workplace. You can't threaten someone on the street or make a call to violence. You can't defame someone in speech or in writing. 

There's a good argument to be made that using hateful rhetoric like Nazis and alt-right people do should not be protected speech either. To me it goes beyond hate speech--you have a right to be bigoted and backwards and racist. But calling for a society absent of people of color and minorities, and calling for a revolution that would make that happen is a pretty clear call to action that can and has resulted in people's deaths. 

Even if you don't believe that this kind of speech should lose its protected status, I think you're misunderstanding what your rights are and mean. It seems an intentional obfuscation to claim that someone's rights are being violated when they're assaulted for something they said. He has a right to be a Nazi, and to say hateful things. But that doesn't mean he's not going to get decked for it. And it also doesn't mean that the guy who punched him won't be punished for it. If the government stepped in and said: ""You can't say that, that's illegal,"" and carted him off, then his rights would be violated.

The only people being punched out in street by black bloc protestors are fascists and white supremacists.

In fact he uses his arm almost as a counterlever to leverage weight into the strings when he needs it.

At least Biden has been working for black communities for a very long time. There are plenty of criticisms about his work and whether or not he actually helped black people in America in his political career, but he's been there for almost half a century.

politics,feiwc4i,t1_feiu33e,1579148991.0,"These are all great points. These are not reasons to give up fighting for ideals though. Do you understand what I'm getting at? If we come to the negotiating table with Republicans and start off with compromised positions that we think are modest and not ""sacrificing better on the alter of best"", we won't get *any* of these proposals. 

If we can say that healthcare should be a human right and that nobody should go bankrupt because of the cost of their healthcare, that's an argument. Caving and saying: ""Well, Republicans won't support this so we have to come up with this half measure or that stop-gap..."" is a good way to lose before we've even started the fight. If people don't want Medicare for All, or a wealth tax, a tax on Wall Street speculation, or any of the other things Warren and Sanders stand for, I'm happy to concede and say that the will isn't there to make it happen. But that's overwhelmingly not the case. I think Americans' values are plenty clear, it just seems like only certain people in the race are willing to fight for them. 

Not every solution needs to be what Warren and Sanders prescribe. Andrew Yang has a number of really interesting proposals that get to similar ends with different means, for example. Mike Bullock actually had a lot of very interesting ideas on climate policy and how to make corporations work to slow and reverse greenhouse gas emissions. But Klobuchar and Pete aren't offering different means to the same end, they're offering different ends entirely. Whereas the other candidates are willing to stand up there and say: ""I'll take a risk on fighting for something that the American people want and need, even if we don't have all the answers yet,"" people like Klobuchar and Pete are content to hedge their bets if it makes them appear ""centrist"" enough to cobble together an Iowa win. Or at the very least, a sweet cabinet position for a the possible next president.

What bothers me isn't their ""centrism"", it's that they know these values are right, they're just too cowardly to fight for them."

It doesn't address the fact that he's not a coalition-building candidate, that he hasn't done much for people of color in South Bend or outside of South Bend, and that he frankly just rubs people the wrong way. The question shouldn't be: why don't you have black voter support, but why *should you?*   


Why *should* a former finance consultant for McKinsey who went to Harvard and Oxford enjoy the support of black communities he has never served, been an ally to, or represented? I found it really insulting actually. There are a tremendous amount of reasons why Pete Buttigieg should give any person of color pause, and what I listed are the least of them. Saying that you have a couple token black pastors who endorse you does not prove in any way that you're a good candidate for black voters, it just says you're a good candidate for black voters to *white voters.*"
politics,feinkil,t1_fegbveu,1579142712.0,">The US has a long way to go before the majority are ready to accept real progressive ideas. 

These ideas are almost a hundred years old. And most of them are polling extremely well. It's just not true that the public doesn't want them. M4A support is near 70%; abolishing private health care and replacing it with M4A is still a majority at 55%. The healthcare industry makes its profits off of denying coverage and charging people money to stay alive. A system like that is morally and ethically bankrupt, and it should be replaced. 

Just because Republicans are staunchly against anything except protecting the profits of the healthcare industry doesn't mean that America's political compass is somewhere in the middle. The Republican party line is skewed so far to the right and so far towards corruption that it's a mistake to thing that the center between them and Sanders/Warren is moderate. Most Americans support the legislation that Bernie and Warren are proposing, not limited to but including a wealth tax, Medicare for All, free public college, and reforming the tax code by ending loopholes for corporations. Every one of these ideas has a majority (greater than 50% for every one of those issues) of public support, as well as just being good ideas. 

Compromising is the bread and butter of how democracies work. I'm under no allusion that some compromise would be necessary to get to any semblance of any of those proposals done. But saying that those ideas are not the right thing to do because Republicans won't support it is compromising our values from the get-go. Republicans won't support anything a Democratic president proposes, no matter how moderate (look at Obamacare and Merrick Garland for examples). That doesn't make any one of those ideas wrong. 

Compromising our values and promising centrism is going to give Donald Trump another 4 years in office. The problems we face right now are too large for centrism to solve. We can't afford 4 more years of business as usual anymore than we can afford another 4 years of Donald Trump."

Better to start in the center, because Republicans are known for their desire to reach common-sense, centrist legislation. What's more, the kinds of changes we need right now might not be centrist changes. But if we don't make them we are fucked. Vying for centrism when the world is on fire and the President's henchmen are ordering hits on ambassadors is not enough. 

I don't begrudge her her support in Iowa at all, but she honestly just spits out Republican talking points at every debate to the detriment of everyone else on stage who then is forced to cater to them.

It's within their rights to say: ""I don't want to have a child,"" and get that shit thrown in the trash, and for that to be the end of the discussion. Or to say: ""I absolutely want this child,"" and carry it to term.

Forcing women (poor, young women overwhelmingly) to have children as punishment for having sex is beyond cruel, not just because it uses children as a cudgel, but because it tells them that their rights matter less than the fetus inside of them.
