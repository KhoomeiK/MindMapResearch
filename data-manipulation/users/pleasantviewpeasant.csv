tumblr,fgz3q9f,t1_fgyytzh,1581190423.0,"This was going to be my response to the person who said that this is like Welcome to Night Vale. ""if trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down?""
Edit: What if Jack Handey went to night Vale in one of those road trip moments with his wife/partner Martha..was that the Fuzzy Memories book?"

EntitledBitch,fgz2irv,t1_fgylt54,1581189952.0,"I have a fat ass, but it doesn't cause my vehicle to require two spots. She just thinks keeping her car from being scratched is a bigger priority that whether all the peasants around can find a spot. (I guess, now I think of it..maybe you meant needing a wider margin of space for removing a fat ass from the car? Possible.)"

badwomensanatomy,fgt8f65,t3_f0ah31,1581100937.0,It's because they aren't anime toddies.
badwomensanatomy,fgt7sa6,t1_fgsp42c,1581100601.0,"I think a lot of guys select the type of porn with their particular taste and pass on videos that don't have an actress with that feature. Straight men can get really specific fetishes and demands fulfilled do easily. Including knowing or requesting the name of every single actress so they can have that specific product.  Must be awfully convenient. 

And they aren't even aware there is a dichotomy. I once had an argument with a guy who insisted that women porn viewers have it just as easy as straight male viewers. Or even gay male viewers. He refused to believe me. He's probably still out there, not noticing the difference in experience that a woman might have to him."
