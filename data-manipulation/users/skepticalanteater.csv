They get a job with underlings and suddenly they start to take pleasure in putting people down. It's a sad statement about human nature, at least imo as I've seen it so many times. I'm glad your old boss got what he deserved lol

I had a manager like that at a bar where I used to work, she was a capital SEE yoU Next Tuesday. I gave my notice saying that December 31st would be my last day.. so I left right at midnight - on the busiest night of the year!! It was very satisfying to stick her with allllllll of the clean up and the last 2 hours of service."

I'm not hatin, even people who are ""normal weight"" aren't necessarily in good shape, I'm just curious about where you got that number?"
