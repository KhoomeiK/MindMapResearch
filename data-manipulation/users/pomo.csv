The month of orange skies, the perpetual heat. 30 years of climate talks and a global accord and all we (Australia) can do is increase coal exports and try to open the largest untapped source of climate change (Carmichael).

It was hot yesterday, fucking hot. It might not have been the hottest year so far, but people have a right to complain right now. So get your ""grin and bear it"" attitude and fuck off."

pics,ffyn6m4,t1_ffyf2m1,1580350410.0,"This post is about Australia's tax on tobacco. It's about covering health costs. As we have socialised medical care, taxing a product known to cause heart, lung and circulatory issues usually leading to premature death ensures non-smokers don't carry the burden for people who choose their own early demise. The other option would be to deny health care to smokers, and that's just not humane."

The VPN is a site-to-site VPN. Aggressive mode from the 4G site - dynamic IP. But we get the same failure with the SW VPN disabled. Any SIP initiation was/is causing the modem reboot.

We've tried disabling the VPNs, same result. We tried routing all traffic over a VPN, and the same result. Whenever a Polycom phone tries to register, the Netgear reboots. So when the phone is left connected, the LB2120 reboots continuously.

Netgear support are just scratching their heads and have been asking the same questions for over a week. Unfortunately, we sent this kit out West (an hour out of Broken Hill) so I can't put hands on it.  Any ideas?"
