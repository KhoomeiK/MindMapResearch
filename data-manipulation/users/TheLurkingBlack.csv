Highly doubt you haven't read it since it's so well known and came out in the 90's, but if you haven't then definitely give it a listen."

whowouldwin,fefuyzk,t3_eotqeu,1579066044.0,"Ok so I've only watched the Black Clover anime, but I HAVE read the manga for Fairy Tail. Erza literally had every bone in her body broken, and when a giant meteor was about to fall onto the entire battlefield she leaped up with her absolutely DESTROYED body and completely destroyed the meteor. Also there was that time where she casually defeated 100 monsters one by one. And there was also that time where, due to another opponent's magic, she was turned blind, deaf, and the amount of pain she felt during battle was amplified and she STILL won.

Yami is able to fight against foes that are able to fight the Wizard King(the strongest wizard in the world pretty much) and is able to react to light speed attacks. His ""dimensional slash"" can seemingly cut almost anything. Also, he can sense the ki of other people(basically just their entire presence) so you can't hide from him.

&#x200B;

This is just from off the top of my head and like I said I only watch the Black Clover anime. IMO Erza curbstomps since(canonically at least) she's stronger than Natsu, who killed a God (Ikusatsunagi)."

selfimprovement,fde0asi,t3_eku80n,1578328266.0,"Not sweets, but I stopped drinking as much soda by just replacing it with something else. Now I mainly drink a lot of tea.

So I'd say just find another food to take its place. Maybe fruit or granola bars"
