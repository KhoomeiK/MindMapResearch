                 I know it seems bratty, but she may, in an odd way, be extending an olive branch by asking for her gift ""back"". The reason she didn't apologize is because she's 13 and is probably embarrassed about her behavior or trying to downplay wanting the gift.              
             If you love her Dad, you gotta choose your battles with his kids. Give then some slack within reason and hopefully you can have a good relationship.
