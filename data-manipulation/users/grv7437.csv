coolguides,fg6rcar,t1_fg6qfh3,1580575102.0,"Usually nobody would find dissolved metals and chlorides or even fluoride in sources like natural lakes, river streams, etc. I'm pretty sure the cloth will take care of the colloidal matter provided it is fine enough (micro fibre will do?). The real challenge would be to treat water from underground sources using this unit which is pretty much impossible to do from regular household items.


As far as hardness is concerned that could be an issue if present, but I'm pretty sure it won't be deadly."
coolguides,fg6qv2y,t1_fg6q46x,1580574795.0,"Technically, yes. The boiling point of water is 100°C. But based on tests done by WHO, raising the temperature to around 70-75°C is sufficient enough to kill ""most"" bacteria. But then again if you could, you can let it stay at 100°C for even longer amount of time, but it is quite unlikely you're going to find those rare viruses in the water.


Also, this is just technically true because its based on the same principle used in the water treatment plants almost everywhere around the world. Would not recommend anyone trying this though, even casually. It could get you into serious trouble."
coolguides,fg6kd6q,t1_fg6jceq,1580570281.0,"Yes most certainly it will. Thanks for pointing that out. I kinda forgot about that. Maybe because they never use it on a large scale treatment because of feasibility and economical issues. Boiling at around 70°C will for say 15-20 mins will in theory destroy the structural colonies of most bacterias (aside from some rare viruses like polio). Boiling and cooling after going through this unit in the post will be sufficient, I guess.


If in a tight situation, I'd suggest to take water from the cleanest source, pass through this unit, boil it and then finally cool it before drinking."
coolguides,fg6ing2,t3_ex6dui,1580569001.0,"I'd say its almost a complete process and will remove all impurities. Keep in mind however, that bacteria, pathogens and other viruses will still get through as they really need to be removed by disinfection by either chlorination or U-V or similar processes.


Edit 1: Well actually I thought this was a quick guide to have clean water if you're stuck in the wild. I am pretty sure you won't have any sort of chemicals (e.g.: chlorine tabs) with you. In my opinion this will never be able to replace your household/treatment facility purification method. Also, chlorine is really bad for us if there is a residue left in the water which is why chlorine doses are strictly supervised in treatment facilities.


Edit 2: Yes. I do know that 70°C isn't boiling. But taking the water upto 100°C will take a lot of time (depending on the quantity of water you're trying to boil). Raising temperatures to 70°C is sufficient to kill most bacteria and 15-20mins includes the time to get to that point (source: WHO's guide on boiling water).


Edit 3: Again, this is just a simple casual explaination. To optimize everything we will have to run tests on the water samples."
coolguides,fg6ihm1,t1_fg6hg3x,1580568876.0,"The process is called adsorption. If you simply look it up you'll find how the mechanism works. Its really great at removing all dissolved impurities like phosphate, fluoride, nitrate, etc. which usually aren't removed through simple mechanical filtration. Its the same principle on which ""activated carbon"" works."
