If so, why are you asking for an explanation? This is nothing new, it was literally answered by God himself thousands of years ago."
Christian,ffd70r3,t1_ff7vc9m,1579814660.0,"This is the correct answer. I dont know why people think there is a ""debate"" about what the unforgivable sin is..."
Christianity,ff4lsse,t1_ff3ezbs,1579566709.0,"Outside of personal revelation? 

I guess The logic goes like this:

1. Determine that a creator of the universe is undeniable using presuppositionalism.

2. Understand that the death of Jesus is historically verifiable.

3. Understand the empty tomb is historically verifiable. 

4. Understand that there were 500 eye witnesses who attested to seeing Jesus alive after the resurrection.

5. Understand that if the resurrection was false, then the myth of Jesus' resurrection spread faster than any other myth in known history. And not by a little bit. 

6. Understand that Jesus' disciples died a martyrs death, refusing to recant their faith only AFTER they witnessed the resurrection. Before the resurrection, they admittedly fled in fear after seeing Jesus die. Even the miracles they witnessed were not enough to hold their faith, but the ressurection was the undeniable proof of God and you see this reflected in their actions.

On top of this, I believe the Bible is self affirming. You can look at the old testament prophecies that Jesus fulfilled  that could not have been manufactured for instance.

If someone who approaches with genuine motives I can't see where they will come to the conclusion that Christianity is ""just another religion""."
Christianity,ff4jojd,t1_ff3gf17,1579565245.0,"Are you catholic? He's catholic. You too are probably speaking two different languages.

He believes that the Priest forgiving his sins gets him into heaven. It's far from biblical, and protestants shouldn't be sure that most Catholics have recieved grace themselves, just as most Catholics don't believe Protestants have recieved grace. 

Catholocism and Protestantism can hardly BOTH be the true Gospel. They are too different when putting forth the requirements for salvation. So you two answering this question is going to be completely different."
Christianity,ff46z4y,t1_ff41n52,1579556902.0,"Uhhh what? So much of this is incorrect.

1. Numbers 5 is probably not about an active pregnancy. It makes no mention of a pregnant woman or an unborn child.

2. The curse is meant to make the woman infertile, not as an abortion procedure.

3. The curse is literally drinking dusty water, and any effect it has is supernaturally applied by God himself.

4. Even if I were to submit that this was an instance of abortion, using an instance where God has justified death to certain people, does not give the same right to man. It is God that justifies and sets the moral standard. And adhearing to this one piece of scripture would require ignoring a much larger amount of other scripture that gives value to the unborn.

The 2nd part of your comment just simply shouldn't be true for believers. It's a secular way of making a pro abortion argument, that God would still be displeased with."
Christianity,ff45d1g,t1_ff40vgp,1579555896.0,"Yeah it's a bad analogy. 

It would have to be more like you just went to the store, bought a very tiny pellet of matter, took it home, put it in the fridge for 9 months, did absolutely nothing and then opened the fridge to a giant cake.

It's hard to argue that the pellet is ever really anything other than cake.

The difference that makes any analogy bad where you substitute the word ""human"" is that no one cares if you smash the pellet or the cake."
Christianity,ff44syw,t1_ff3zn3y,1579555544.0,And has no biblical connection to whether or not that human has a spirit or not.
Christianity,ff44lqt,t1_ff3ya90,1579555417.0,"That just makes no sense if you are a believer and not neutral. God works in absolutes, because there is an absolute moral standard. God doesn't allow his standard to be violated in the light to make violating his standard in the dark have less consequence."
Christianity,ff43xua,t1_ff3qt8y,1579555006.0,"Are we honestly in a pro christian sub reddit, claiming supporting a party, which has up to birth abortion in their official platform is a reason to be hopeful?

Also, important to know that young people have always leaned left heavily. I myself was a Democrat from 18-27. 

Regardless of political leaning though, if you isolate the abortion issue alone, claim to believe God when he tells you he knew you before you were in the womb, and then support the mass killings of those beings, I would advise you to search your soul and repent."
Christian,fewnwuq,t1_fewk2a2,1579416273.0,The first part of your statement is verifiably false.
Christian,fewnugc,t1_fevq67s,1579416187.0,"What in the world do you mean he wouldnt accept a deathbed conversion? 

That's certainly not scripture, and you should be careful of teaching things you arent sure of when it comes to salvation.

Maybe you will be the one to find out in the last days that God wasnt fond of you spreading false Gospels."
Christian,fewnosz,t1_fevmb9u,1579416001.0,"It's not as simple as once saved always saved, but there is a sin unto death, where God will let satan destroy your flesh so that he can save your spirit."
science,fem08tw,t1_felkdq3,1579235627.0,"How does this support your view on evolution more than any other fossils before? This just proves that there were land animals at a time when they thought there weren't any.

It's just the oldest fossil curreny of a land animal. There is no reason to think this particular species crawled out of the ocean as the title seems to suggest."

Possibly.

Do you claim to know God's purposes?

I suggest you pick up a bible. Probably Job chapter 38 and forward will help you."
Christian,feamjls,t1_fe9wj42,1578950309.0,"Creation testifies of a creator, and the Bible is the self affirming evidence of who that creator is...

You're looking for evidence through science which is an inductive methodology, and can't provide evidence for anything that exists outside of certain boundaries.

It's like you're trying to measure temperature with a yard stick."
Christian,feales5,t1_fe8fpyb,1578950068.0,"You must have skipped Job then. 

You're in a fallen world. You have no right to food or shelter, and God does not tell you he will provide them for you. In fact, If it be his will he may intentionally keep those things from you.

Whatever you've gone or are going through, God came down from heaven, humbled himself as a man, and went through worse.

EscapefromTarkov,fe8s2sd,t1_fe7qwtt,1578930070.0,"Maybe you could make ""custom"" death letters optional. That way if you dont want to read something abusive you will just see a generic letter, ""If I die please notify my mother w/ phone # , some Russian scribble, or a crudely drawn picture of a chicken or something."
