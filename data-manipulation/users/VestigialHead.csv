>It is possible for money to be eliminated and have a moneyless society, not so much for labour.

Whether or not it is a viable method is a discussion for another day.  The fact remains that it would still need a monetary system to provide a UBI.

There is simply no easy solution for moving forward without a monetary system.  Bartering is the only real alternative I have seen and it just will not work in our current global system.  Impossible to trade labour for goods with the size of the modern trading system.

So you have still not suggested a possible replacement for money.

When i said ""we could not"" work out a way to do it - I mean myself and the other people I was discussing it with.  I do not mean mankind in general.  It may be possible to propose an alternative system that has no monetary component.  That is what I am asking you to suggest or explain.
If you also cannot think of a way to get rid of money then I suggest you stop claiming that:

So you were leaning heavily on the side of it being a bioweapon.

All along my intent has been one of reason.  It is not wise to push an outlying and very damaging claim UNTIL you have actual evidence of that claim.

I am more than happy to believe it is an intentional bio-weapon attack.  BUT and this is a big BUT - only with solid confirmed evidence that it is that.  Until then the most likely explanation is a mutating virus - we have previous examples of exactly this happening with multiple occurrences of viruses jumping the animal-human gap.
