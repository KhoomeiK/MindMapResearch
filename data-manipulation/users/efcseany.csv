I would strongly recommend adjusting the heatmat so that the surface temperature is about 88-89f. That works out to be 31-32c, which is - for most - the ""sweet spot"".


If she is staying in her moist/humidity hide, chances are she's preparing for a shed. Ensure that you have something rough in the enclosure for her to rub on to aid in the process.

Be very wary with how moist the hide is. You don't want to be encouraging an RI.
I have several that won't use a humid hide and will shed ""completely dry"" so to speak, but some of my others will require one."
snakes,fffkcub,t1_fffjwde,1579885838.0,"Depending on the species, you may wish to account for a shed/moist hide to aid with the process.

Ensure that you have a **minimum** of one hide per side of the enclosure, so that the snake does not have to make the decision between warmth and security."

The saying ""Age is just a number"" is incredibly  cliché , but it's true.

I (26M) am currently in an ongoing 7-year relationship with my partner (30F).

We live together. With people, sometimes the age-gap works, sometimes it doesn't.

Granted, you can't grasp the size of the enclosure in a video, but regardless, they are not social. The only time it is ""acceptable"" to keep in groups is when they are hatchlings - having not reached sexual maturity - and of similar size.

It's a similar scenario with the snakes I've seen. I keep and breed A.squamigera, but I've seen cases of where people are keeping 9ft H.gigas in 4ft boxes.

It's simply not acceptable..."
