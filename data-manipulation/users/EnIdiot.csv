LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ffgi7hg,t3_etb1t4,1579906810.0,"I've always felt and have stated here that the Marxist roots of modern feminism is largely to blame here. I don't think Marxism itself (per se) is the issue, it is as others have said the way that it was co-opted by feminists.

In both Marxist and feminist philosophy, the boundary between, say, an owner of the means of production and a worker was often seen as a hard boundary, and much of the Marxist economic and philosophical analysis I've read has always felt ambiguous at best (and antagonistic at worst) towards people who fall in between these neat boundaries and outside their pre-conceived pigeonholes. 

Feminist thought, especially trans-exclusionary feminist thought has to have a patriarchy or an enemy or something to define itself in opposition to. While I disagree with it, TERFs (I love the acronym by the way) see your ability to ""become a woman (which you always were)"" as another sign of male privilege, not, as it should be seen, as a human being affirming themselves and who they are. 

I just wish we could learn in this discussion to be **for** positive change and not define ourselves in opposition to other people and ideas.

I'm a  cis-gendered man, and I while I may not understand what you feel or why you chose to transition, I support your right to do so and respect your choices as they affirm who you wish to be.

LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ff48nen,t1_ff457cl,1579557941.0,Yeah. Ill agree that mortality from domestic violence is overwhelmingly female and that needs to be addressed.

LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ff46ga0,t1_ff45emh,1579556579.0,"So, my wife and I were binge watching Unbelievable on Netflix. It is a great show and you should definitely watch it, but it skated very close to being misandrist by portraying most white males as incompetent or uncaring and most males of color as being helpful but a little dim. I say almost, because I have not read a non-fiction history of the case and dont know if that was the case, and it could be. I am willing to believe that a guy who has never been raped couldnt understand how traumatized a person could be in that situation.

Essentially, I am a person who believes in the individuals right to determine for themselves how best to live, but I recognize that we have to reduce the harm to civil peace and general well-being that those choices bring as well as take care of those who by their nature are vulnerable. It is well in line with civil libertarians with a harm reduction, social net style approach. It works in many European countries and deserves a try here."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ff445fo,t1_ff41rh5,1579555133.0,"Absolutely. Ill take this a bit further and say that I think what lead them from an essentially good idea of egalitarianism towards a supremest or vindictive rhetoric is the words they choice. Warren Farrell talks a bit about this in The Myth of Male Power. But the words we use often influence our concepts of the discussion. 
Patriarchy (the word) clearly puts the problem on the father and makes the enemy male. I dont want to wander too far into the SapirWhorf theory (as it too has issues), but I feel the way we discuss things reinforces our preconceptions.

Think about it. I dont think the world blackmail or blackout cause racism, but I sure think the negative cultural connotations we have between black and evil or other reinforces it and may have been the reason why Africans were called Negro or Black and why people of color is  less loaded and allows for discussions free of a lot of baggage.

Thanks for the welcoming reception!"
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ff42g1k,t1_ff41dmf,1579554083.0,"Yes. I think it is insane. I think what offends their sensibilities is akin to what supposedly happened when biologists encountered the platypus. It crossed so many defining, preconceived boundaries that it threatened to bring down their entire taxonomy. 

I think transwomen and transmen are essential to us understanding our gender roles and our concept of sex. Im not saying I get their desire or always feel comfortable with it, but I see that most of them are honest and authentic in their need to move along what should be a spectrum into a cultural realm that many hold sacrosanct and absolute.  This can only be a good thing as it stirs the cognitive pot a bit."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ff41sip,t1_ff40sro,1579553680.0,"Thanks for asking! Yeah, I think it does in a way robs women of their moral agency. So, take for example a recent CDC backed statistic (Ill post a link under here after I make my point). They estimate (iirc) that 40-45 percent of domestic violence victims are men. It is also acknowledged that this percent is probably higher as men tend to not even conceive of themselves as victims. I would argue it is reasonable to assume many women dont see themselves as abusers either due to the same cultural blind spot.

Ive heard womens abuse defended as a reaction to the patriarchy by friends and others online. Ill try to find an example to post here below. McKinnon claimed that all heterosexual sex was ultimately rape due to power differentials inherent in the patriarchy. She is not just some far out nut in the feminist canon, and  her ideas are clearly influencing policy on Title 9 in US schools. So much so that it would make it impossible for a man to receive impartial due justice on any kind of harassment or sexual assault charge.

So, yes."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ff40nds,t1_ff40chm,1579552968.0,"And while I know it is a flaw in Human thought in general, it seems to me to be a hallmark of Marxist thought.

Hell, Ive changed a large number of my opinions based upon Reddit discussions."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ff3zzbg,t3_erimp5,1579552551.0,"Here was my answer to a commenter who saw my critique of Marxist based feminism as another sign of my lack of wokeness. He said that Marxism wasnt about dividing and assigning blame for a system, and that I  clearly wasnt educated enough to grasp it.

Id beg to differ. Granted it started out as an analysis technique of economic systems, but definitely during its blossoming under the Russian Revolution and under the Cultural Revolution in China it became a tool of denouncement and division.

Modern Marxist feminist thought that attempts to divide against male and female often has a problem with transgendered women for this reason. The whole trans-exclusionary branch of feminist though hinges on this very thing. A feminism or a mens liberation philosophy based upon the inability to recognize spectrums of gender and privilege are going to fail to grasp this."
LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ff3zlsy,t3_erimp5,1579552320.0,"Additionally on the other thread I was accused of being alt-right and spreading propaganda.

In full disclosure, I am not anywhere near alt-right or even conservative (per se). I am big on opposing Trump, who, along with his Fascists supporters are a cancer on American democracy. Im more of an anarcho-libertarian who favors a Nordic style social safety net. I want everyone to be free to decide who they are. Im just more concerned right now for my sons and myself.

My reading from Marxism and Feminism come from a Masters degree in English from the mid 1990s just as the sex-positive wave of feminism was becoming discussed in my gender studies classes. I read Lacan,  Bakhtin, de Beauvoir, MacKinnon, and a host of others that frankly did very little for me then other than to convince me that the Liberal Arts were eating themselves alive  and assuring that a Ph.D. was not something I wanted to do.

LeftWingMaleAdvocates,ff3ys15,t1_ff3y469,1579551801.0,"Yeah. I am in no way anti-women. I am married to a wonderful and strong-willed woman who frankly is more than a match for any man when it comes to getting things accomplished.

She has a Ph.D., is beautiful in my eyes both inside and out, yet she is scarred because her weight is high and she doesnt match modern ideas of beauty. I am just as pissed off that we live in a world where this happens as I do where my boys have to sign up for the draft when women dont (currently it is finally being changed iirc). Just as I want the world to look differently at my wife, I want them to look differently towards my sons and me. I love them dearly and fiercely and try to show them the affection my own father was unable to show me due to his cultural programming.

Additionally, Im not directing anyone. I really dont care to. I hope they, like me, enjoy debate and having their perspectives challenged. Ive appreciated people pointing out my definition or understanding of Patriarchy may be flawed. 

I am coming to the conclusion that the signifier of patriarchy may point to a signified system that I wish we had another word for but that I have an overlapping view of. Ive appreciated that feedback. 

If you are disturbed by anything, maybe it should be your own desire to cut off rational discussion because it doesnt fit your political system."

If you are naturally suited to leading, be you a man or woman, then by all means lead. My worth as a man, as a person, is not hinged upon me being the boss. I have worth outside what I do or how much money I have. 

I got laid off years ago while my infant was in need of hospitalization and I was the sole breadwinner with insurance. It was traumatic in a way that is hard for many women to understand. I felt worthless.

I have helped out in projects that encourage girls to go into STEM.

DebateAnAtheist,fek2hxz,t3_epf610,1579191216.0,"So, I lived in Scandinavia back in the 80s, and Ive kept current with friends and family there over the years.

In most of Scandinavia, you dont really have a fundamentalist movement that is on par with the US. Sure, you have people of faith, and sure you have cultural trappings of Christianity (and paganism by the waySt. Johns night or midsummer for example), but by and large it is just tradition and seen as such. 

The US, however, had many traditions, many ethnic backgrounds, and many racial groups. Each of these groups often maintain their own religious traditions to preserve a sense of identity as much as to worship. My wifes family is Lebanese, and we are Eastern Catholics (Maronites). I believe, and go to church with her, but for her and her family, it is part of their cultural identity. Im Norwegian, and a cultural norm for us is to care, but not too much about religious matters. The attitude is There may be gods, but they probably dont care and you probably dont want them to. Depend on yourself. 

So,  the other undercurrent here people dont realize is that after WWI, there was a a growing assignment of everyone who nominally was white into a monolithic category of White. So much so that people like my wife (who is Arabic) was White along with Greeks, Italians, Poles, Germans, etc. Additionally even Asian people were token white. In that they were held up to be the other white meat of America (Adam ruins everything covers this wonderfully). Many Chinese and Koreans are also Christian in the US.

The final undercurrent in all of this is an unholy hybridization of Objectivism (think Ayn Rand) and an Evangelical Biblical Literalism that fetishizes the Bible as the Literal Word of God (put echo effect over that).  

This lead to things like Prosperity gospel interpretations that basically said you can ignore reason and science all together and justify your wealth and privilege as an Evangelical. This in turn lead to Republicans co-opting the Evangelical movement into their political machine. People often forget that Martin Luther King Junior and Jimmy Carter were Evangelicals.

So you get things like the Culture Wars where these crazy, crazy so-called evangelicals pushing creationism and anti-atheism and crap that isnt part of modern Catholic doctrine, Episcopalian doctrine, Lutheran doctrine, etc. 

Like Nietzsche said you have to be careful in hunting monsters because you risk becoming one yourself.  I see modern American and British (which has fed some of the American history itself and shares in common) atheism as a reaction against the crazy evangelical movement and unfortunately it sometimes becomes like the monster they hate.

We cant dismiss mass media and its love of controversy. The political machines that thrive off of this division. The mega-churches making billions off of their followers from any of this either. 

To circle back, most European atheists are the kind of atheists that just dont care and stop going to church to lead their lives as best they can. If you want to believe, cool, good for you, Im sleeping in on Sunday before going to lunch."

Essentially, I am a person who believes in the individual’s right to determine for themselves how best to live, but I recognize that we have to reduce the harm to civil peace and general well-being that those choices bring as well as take care of those who by their nature are vulnerable.

I’ll take this a bit further and say that I think what lead them from an essentially good idea of egalitarianism towards a supremest or vindictive rhetoric is the words they choice. Warren Farrell talks a bit about this in “The Myth of Male Power.” But the words we use often influence our concepts of the discussion. 
“Patriarchy” (the word) clearly puts the problem on the “father” and makes the enemy male. I don’t want to wander too far into the Sapir–Whorf theory (as it too has issues), but I feel the way we discuss things reinforces our preconceptions.

Think about it. I don’t think the world “blackmail” or “blackout” cause racism, but I sure think the negative cultural connotations we have between “black” and “evil” or “other” reinforces it and may have been the reason why Africans were called “Negro” or “Black” and why “people of color” is  less loaded and allows for discussions free of a lot of baggage.

So, take for example a recent CDC backed statistic (I’ll post a link under here after I make my point). They estimate (iirc) that 40-45 percent of domestic violence victims are men. It is also acknowledged that this percent is probably higher as men tend to not even conceive of themselves as victims. I would argue it is reasonable to assume many women don’t see themselves as abusers either due to the same cultural blind spot.

I’ve heard women’s abuse defended as a “reaction to the patriarchy” by friends and others online. I’ll try to find an example to post here below. McKinnon claimed that all heterosexual sex was ultimately rape due to power differentials inherent in the patriarchy. She is not just some far out nut in the feminist canon, and  her ideas are clearly influencing policy on Title 9 in US schools.

Each of these groups often maintain their own religious traditions to preserve a sense of identity as much as to worship. My wife’s family is Lebanese, and we are Eastern Catholics (Maronites). I believe, and go to church with her, but for her and her family, it is part of their cultural identity. I’m Norwegian, and a cultural norm for us is to care, but not too much about religious matters. The attitude is “There may be gods, but they probably don’t care and you probably don’t want them to. Depend on yourself.” 

So,  the other undercurrent here people don’t realize is that after WWI, there was a a growing assignment of everyone who nominally was “white” into a monolithic category of “White.” So much so that people like my wife (who is Arabic) was White along with Greeks, Italians, Poles, Germans, etc. Additionally even Asian people were “token” white. In that they were held up to be the “other white meat” of America (Adam ruins everything covers this wonderfully). Many Chinese and Koreans are also Christian in the US.

The final undercurrent in all of this is an unholy hybridization of Objectivism (think Ayn Rand) and an Evangelical Biblical Literalism that fetishizes the Bible as the “Literal Word of God” (put echo effect over that).  

This lead to things like Prosperity gospel interpretations that basically said “you can ignore reason and science all together and justify your wealth and privilege as an Evangelical.” This in turn lead to Republicans co-opting the Evangelical movement into their political machine. People often forget that Martin Luther King Junior and Jimmy Carter were Evangelicals.

So you get things like the “Culture Wars” where these crazy, crazy so-called evangelicals pushing creationism and anti-atheism and crap that isn’t part of modern Catholic doctrine, Episcopalian doctrine, Lutheran doctrine, etc. 

Like Nietzsche said you have to be careful in hunting monsters because you risk becoming one yourself.  I see modern American and British (which has fed some of the American history itself and shares in common) atheism as a reaction against the crazy evangelical movement and unfortunately it sometimes becomes like the monster they hate.

We can’t dismiss mass media and it’s love of controversy. The political machines that thrive off of this division. The mega-churches making billions off of their followers from any of this either. 

To circle back, most European atheists are the kind of atheists that just don’t care and stop going to church to lead their lives as best they can. “If you want to believe, cool, good for you, I’m sleeping in on Sunday before going to lunch.”"

In the South (at least) it seems be mainly (but not exclusively) a black thing.  Before you jump my ass (no pun intended), it is part of the whole “down-low” thing that plenty of friends and acquaintances who happen to be black have told me about. As long as a man is “pitching” and not “catching,” he isn’t gay or being a “bitch.”

Like I’ve said, it isn’t exclusively black, and it seems to happen quite a bit in the poorer rural white population as well. Sure, every socio-economical group has child abuse, but this is more of an “open secret” kind of thing.

My theory is that it has to do with groups of people who have been powerless and abused, and individuals in those groups trying to establish dignity and power (as they see it) by whatever means is at hand. 

This is why we have to achieve a more equitable society. We cannot have generations of angry victims distilling this crap into a truly explosive and toxic situation."
