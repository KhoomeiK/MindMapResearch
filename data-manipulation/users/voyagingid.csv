odnd,ffjkd6s,t3_etzefy,1580000215.0,"Carcass Conan and Barsoom are the ones I’ve seen. I think the list you saw was probably on ODD74 proboards forum. I remember seeing them altogether listed as supplements 5, 6, 7 and maybe 8?"
LifeProTips,ffiw9g5,t3_etvfds,1579984231.0,Thanks! Just did it.

osr,fffnwt1,t1_fffjltf,1579888009.0,"Yeah I guess it’s just a bit confusing to have a block of their total slots and then include the saddle bags on the bottom of the sheet in addition. Overall, I really like what you’ve done though."
osr,fffib4f,t3_et6w59,1579884573.0,Why not do the beast of burden like the characters slot wise? I mean have like 20 slots that can be used without bags and then add bag to those slots to add capacity?

osr,ff629u9,t3_ervc18,1579617312.0,"OSE is the Basic and Expert sets combined and reorganized for optimal usability at the table. It’s 100% faithful to the original rules, but has extra rules for ascending AC if you prefer it.

The Advanced Fantasy Genre Rules add rules for extra classes like those found in the original AD&D rules but balanced for B/X level play."
Futurology,ferzxbd,t1_fers8z9,1579360043.0,"No one should be as rich as JZ, let alone Warren Buffet."
Futurology,ferzpzr,t1_feq28ag,1579359967.0,"No. The man as much as anyone helped to renormalize monopolies and copyrights abuses. He is at the forefront of the second gilded age of ultra rich and oligarchs. 

But really it isn’t about any one individual. Individuals accumulating the wealth of small nations is just a horrible idea if we want a representative government."
Futurology,ferxyvl,t1_feq0hs0,1579359461.0,"Yeah, we can agree to disagree. I think both have been a net negative."

worldnews,fep4l7s,t1_feoewy8,1579312001.0,"Dude, you obviously are strongly anti-Apple. Doesn’t mean you’re right, just evangelical. Microsoft has put out so much shitty hardware and software it laps Apple multiple times in that category."
Futurology,fep420t,t1_feooc8d,1579311661.0,"No doubt, absolutely agree."
worldnews,feo9yis,t1_feo8ca9,1579297188.0,"Sucked their way to being one of the biggest companies ever. 

Can you name one of their main competitors that hasn’t made at least as many “sucky” products?"
Futurology,feo4zut,t1_fen1cwo,1579295185.0,"Interesting theory, but I’m not seeing any ultra-rich good guys. I think at a certain point the idea of accumulating excessive amounts of wealth turns off anyone with a healthy consciense."
AskReddit,felsqbc,t1_fel2hu8,1579230001.0,Your loss though.
politics,fegu1mi,t1_fegrpbm,1579102528.0,"Not really, judging millions of people by the worst behavior of sampling of online supporters is straight up simple mindedness. Especially in the age of paid internet trolling. But my guess is you already know that and are maybe even benefiting from it.

Broad brushes by definition are inaccurate. That’s why we have detail brushes."
politics,fegpsme,t1_fegmnlc,1579099660.0,You paint with a very broad brush.

osr,feeg055,t1_feeecab,1579032989.0,I think the unique mix of benefits are worth the boost to xp cost. No way should this class be tied with thieves for lowest xp track.
osr,feedp0n,t3_eokazw,1579031625.0,"Cool class, but I think it would make more sense with a dwarf’s xp progression."
politics,fee5lbq,t1_fee3fy1,1579026867.0,"I highly doubt Bernie or bust, more likely divisive trolling."
missoula,fedxqhm,t1_fedtiwh,1579022112.0,"Ok, so you don’t believe in representative democracy. Do us a favor and leave the country."
politics,feaeu5d,t1_feadbsl,1578947833.0,"I haven’t met a single Bernie voter irl who will sit it out or vote Trump if Bernie doesn’t win the primary. 

Still, if Bernie doesn’t win I think we are fucked. He’s the only candidate that consistently treats the the emergencies we are facing as actual emergencies."
politics,fe6gfj0,t1_fe5z30m,1578890130.0,"Tbh to me you sound salty that your preferred candidate isn’t doing as well as  Bernie at the moment, but I could be wrong."
politics,fe6g3mq,t1_fe44xmi,1578889846.0,The only way we move policy to the left is to start with an agenda to the left. Democrats have too often of late started negotiations from a compromised centerist position and then compromise further to the right to try and meet the Republicans in the new middle.
osr,fe4u0i0,t3_enrq2w,1578862747.0,"That’s not a problem, that’s just potential."

Also having been there and back again many times with OSR systems, B/X and OD&D and their direct clones are really all you need for an amazing OSR campaign."
odnd,fdizq1m,t3_elmwbq,1578454795.0,"I like where you are going with this. In particular, having high level undead commanders bolstering their troops so to speak is a great idea."
LifeProTips,fdisja3,t1_fdipg4d,1578450075.0,When I was a kid I called my crush a whore because I thought it meant scary person and I thought teasing was flirting.
osr,fdircpo,t1_fdhpb76,1578449319.0,"I know that, but OSE is a big platform in the OSR scene so I was hoping for it’s inclusion just from an exposure stand point."
osr,fdhcuqg,t1_fdfp3nr,1578420099.0,"Target 20 is very elegant, it’s the only thing we use at my table. Unfortunately it isn’t included in OSE. Fortunately it’s trivial to add since there are already attack bonuses listed."
politics,fdewxkm,t1_fdevt1r,1578348325.0,"Seriously, you guys are the only ones throwing out the “Messiah” talk. 

All I’m saying is his statement about Warren applies to Bernie as well. 

Can’t we all be reasonable people and disagree on our preferred candidates without having to belittle those we disagree with?

Edit: forget it. I just read your comment history."
politics,fdevpuz,t1_fdevb7i,1578347590.0,"As in completely disingenuous to act like this sets her apart. Are you purposely misreading what I’m saying?

Edit: never mind, after seeing your edit it’s obvious you aren’t conversing in good faith. Are you trolling or genuinely unhinged?"
politics,fdevd6s,t1_fdeuw81,1578347382.0,"I could be wrong, but is he not pointing it out as something that differentiates Warren?"
politics,fdev2zv,t1_fdeuv7v,1578347214.0,"That’s definitely not what I said, but you do you."
politics,fdeum8a,t1_fdetrtg,1578346938.0,"He may like Warren more, but this comment is completely disingenuous in light of Bernie being in the race."
worldnews,fdetweh,t1_fdeqk9z,1578346512.0,It links primary sources.
politics,fcnx50b,t1_fcnu11c,1577820189.0,"That post wasn’t science minded, it was straight up ageist. Don’t be so quick to dismiss our wisest elders.

I want a leader who has been on the right side of the issues I care most about from the outset. Pair this with lessons, insight and wisdom that come from decades of morally consistent championing of these issues and you have an almost perfect candidate."
politics,fcnqqro,t1_fcnifmc,1577816653.0,As someone in their mid forties that’s some ageist bullshit. Judge individuals individually. Bernie is as sharp as a tac.

osr,fcag0qo,t3_egugec,1577568589.0,"Your thoughts are in line with mine. Over powered characters. Great for one shots, doesn’t do as well at campaign play. I find the characters start over powered and get ridiculously so around 6th or 7th level."
Foodforthought,fcabi2u,t1_fcab8gq,1577566172.0,"Simple to make a decision, not simple to follow through. And yet we persist."
Foodforthought,fc9o760,t1_fc9jlfn,1577555648.0," Not everyone wants one of those. Thankfully there are other ways to make a living. Simple.

Edit: Apparently everyone is supposed to have a paid position of regular employment? I haven’t had one in ten years, does that offend some of you?"
Foodforthought,fc9nxea,t3_egpqn4,1577555527.0,Keep creating and find other content revenue models.
