I tried to edit my original comment to emphasize where I stand, I hope it clears things up. Wasn’t tying to come across in some way to offer sympathy toward OP’s girlfriend — I just noticed everyone was dismissing the idea that there would be an instance where using names like that would be the smartest move. It hit home for me, and I think I chose to bring it up in an inappropriate post given the context of the OP. 
I don’t believe her story in the slightest, I just wanted to correct misinformation that contributes to victims who stay silent. I am not sympathetic toward the girlfriend at all nor am I trying to garner sympathy for her, I think my intentions of the comment were just misconstrued. My apologies again, I don’t mean to start some sort of back-and-forth"
relationship_advice,ffbd02r,t1_ffbcpwz,1579760168.0,"I can understand why a lot of people choose to lurk instead of comment on this subreddit. I’m not sure why you keep thinking I’m defending the cheater? Maybe I just shed light on a real issue in the wrong place, and that’s definitely an error on my part. 

For the record, I’m in agreement that she is INDEED cheating, emotionally for sure if not physically as well. But is it so wrong that I noticed people don’t understand that, apart from this situation, it IS possible for people to get trapped to the point they have to “play along” to protect themselves? I didn’t mean to come across as defending the girlfriend, just correcting misinformation about how sometimes being stalked and threatened really can lead you to playing along to appease the person. My apologies for any confusion"
relationship_advice,ffbchm6,t1_ffbc8qq,1579759604.0,"Lmao I never said anything about believing a cheater, the commenter simply asked about referring to someone with those kind of names and I just offered a different perspective because I’ve personally been in that kind of situation. Ofc the context of the ACTUAL post is shady, but you would be surprised how many people get caught in a situation where they have to “play along” to be safe."

I got a perfect score on the writing section of the SAT, but my SAT score from years ago may not be too indicative of how I score on the GRE. I'm mainly worried about my reading comprehension skills because though I am an active reader, some of the practice questions have been tripping me up with wording and context. 

I know that the sections are adaptive too (not sure if that's a new change) so I don't know if that is something to worry about when going through the exam in terms of scoring."

askpsychology,fd0g1vu,t3_ej880h,1578118272.0,"I couldn't find a lot of academic literature on this topic, but based on what I *did* find, you may be describing a phenomenon known as false guilt. I think this is attributed to [anxiety disorders](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618510001283) because of how important emotions such as guilt are in anxiety -- a common example of anxiety I see floating around the internet is when people make eye contact with strangers and begin wondering a plethora of things, e.g. ""Why is this person staring at me? Do I have something in my hair? Do I know this person? Does this person know *me*? Is this person a threat? Is this person even looking at me?""

In regards to suspicious behaviors while being watched despite innocent, I find it reasonable to believe that anxiety could have a role in this as well because perhaps people are overthinking their own actions in being watched. In general, reactivity is a phenomenon seen timelessly in studies because sometimes people just change their behaviors when they know they are being watched/observed. The [frontal areas of the brain](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/9/2/150/1618662) are associated with the feeling of guilt, but it's important to note that the brain really works together for a lot of functions and it's not always the case that one specific part is solely responsible for whatever action/behavior/emotion. I found an [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3458240/) that discusses the brain mechanisms that may be involved in greater depth if you're interested.

False confessions can occur for a number of reasons, including the style of interrogation used, intense psychological pressure, and even limited intellectual capacity. [Dr. Kassin](https://www.apa.org/research/action/speaking-of-psychology/false-confessions) is a leading expert in studying false confessions, and there's a lot of factors that can play into why people may confess to a crime they did not commit."

CompulsiveSkinPicking,fczqlw2,t3_ejpvqm,1578106901.0,"My skincare routine is extreeemely simple compared to a lot of people on r/SkincareAddiction LOL but I definitely still find myself getting lazy with it fairly often. It helps me when I see the visible results, because my skin is really clearing and getting better. It's like I don't want to fuck up all my progress and have to start over, yk? Also, the shit I use was not a pretty price so it kinda holds me accountable to not waste my money and just follow through.

When it's 3am and I finally start taking off my makeup though, there is barely any motivation and I have to remind myself that it takes like 5min at the most to just wash my face after I brush my teeth. Plus since I'm already at the sink, there's zero excuse to *not* do my skincare routine."
SkincareAddiction,fczon07,t3_ejq0sf,1578105794.0,"All my acne is basically hormonal acne from just fluctuations during my period and also stress, so I feel you. I was on Ortho Tri-Cyclen a a couple of years ago to try to control it but had to stop for mental health reasons, and then literally right after I stopped I started getting really bad nodular acne for the first time. The dermatologists I went to were really no help, but I found that cutting out dairy seemed to really help me. Also, I started drinking [spearmint tea](https://www.wellandgood.com/good-looks/spearmint-tea-supplements-hormonal-acne/) daily, which might be helping ? 

I use Curology right now and amazingly, my skin has been really clear except for the minor breakouts every month because of my period! My treatment plan includes azelaic acid, clindamycin, and zinc pyrithione if that helps -- you can dig around this subreddit or the internet for what the ingredients do too. 

Also... totally relatable @ sleep deprivation LOL I think my poor sleeping habits contribute to my hormonal acne and make them worse, so I've been trying to sleep earlier by either taking a sleeping med or tiring myself out during the day. You probably have heard it a lot, but your skin is def gonna get better before it gets worse, so hang in there !! If you just recently began that routine, I'd wait it out until the 6-8wk mark to let your skin adjust."

It helped me when I used my anxiety to motivate me and push me instead of overwhelming me! Of course if your time management is already pretty good, then all should be well. It just takes some time to adjust and perhaps a change in mindset. It's easier said than done to kind of change how you think, but it *does* work and you have to believe that you can take on this challenge instead of succumbing to the pressure. Overthinking is normal, but remind yourself that some things may not be in your complete control and it makes no sense to worry about them too much.

i started my ""glow up"" journey by implementing a better skincare routine and enforcing better personal hygiene. i got basic skincare products to combat my combo/oily and acne-prone skin and took my dental hygiene a lot more seriously with mouthwash, flossing, and whitening toothpaste. i also got a better deodorant (tip: womens' deodorants honestly SUCK imo) and found a new signature fragrance that stuck to my clothes enough for people to notice LOL it sounds dumb but taking care of myself from the ""inside"" made me feel a lot prettier ""outside"" !

i feel like fashion doesn't have to be super complicated; getting staple closet items that you can make many outfits out of that look put-together is all you really need (e.g. a nice, simple button-up shirt paired with skinny jeans can go a LONGGG way). also, the little things like making sure your clothes aren't wrinkled, your shoes aren't dirty, your hair is brushed, etc. can really help!"
