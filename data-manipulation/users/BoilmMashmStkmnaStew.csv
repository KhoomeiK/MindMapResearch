Awwducational,fe09g7z,t1_fe08tsj,1578806811.0,"Yeah, there's some convo about that below. I'm still not sure it wasn't, but it was a nearly two inch wasp and there aren't that many options near where I lived."
Awwducational,fdw6qks,t1_fdw65a1,1578755637.0,Your video made my heart beat faster. I think that was the asshole. Put her in a lineup. I'll see if I can find the picture of the corpse for comparison.
Awwducational,fdw5af6,t1_fdw48kz,1578755238.0,"Oh, maybe! I just looked that one up and it said they deliver a particularly painful sting. Also that they feed their young prechewed insects. That sounds more like the attitude of my attacker. I'm going to feel terrible if I slandered the good name of a peaceful wasp."
Awwducational,fdvz4pq,t1_fdvxrng,1578753335.0,"I hadn't considered that angle, and, if that was the case, she was amazingly brave and fiercely avenged her family with my respect. I legit think I would remember stepping on a nearly two inch wasp though. I didn't think something like that existed until I found one stabbing me."
Awwducational,fdvw81w,t1_fdvu2oo,1578752344.0,"I'm pretty sure. She was the right size and in the right area, and I'm pretty sure solitary living because I never saw another one (thank goodness). 

Longer version of the story, I was holding one of my child's guinea pigs just sitting there talking to him when it happened. Then I felt it, got up, briskly walked to the child and said ""take him, take him, take him"" and handed over the pig. Then got to my back and the wasp was still there stinging me. I couldn't even believe it was a wasp because WHAT DID IT GET OUT OF THAT TORTURE? Sadist wasp. That's what it was. 

But yes, I think it was. Size and visual check matched up. I think those were the only extra large wasps in that area, but I'll take a double peek just in case."
Awwducational,fdvsggr,t1_fdvqr19,1578751048.0,"A couple years ago, I was sitting in my room, minding my own business, and I suddenly felt this sharp, burning pain on my back. I reached back to see what the heck was going on and there was a Cicada Killer Wasp stinging me. A giant ground wasp came into my bedroom, got on my back, and proceeded to sting me as long and ferociously as she could for no reason other than she was a wasp. She was definitely not one of the good ones."

relationship_advice,fdd4k8a,t3_ekpzyt,1578294512.0,"My child was asked from the age of 13 I think whether they wanted me in there with them. I wasn't allowed in unless they expressly said they wanted me. The doctor let me know that I couldn't ask for their private medical information unless I was given permission by my child. Luckily we have a great relationship and it's never been a problem, but I was upset at first, I need *permission* to be included in my child's healthcare? Then I thought about it. It's so hard for some (most?) children to speak up when their parents are in the room. Questions they might be brave enough to ask on their own go unasked with a parent there. Abuse or fear in the home could go unreported. So, yes, you can say no. I don't know if mine was an individual state mandate or if it's an all around US thing, but it's definitely a thing and you're practically an adult now anyway. Maybe call your doctor's office yourself before you go and let them know what's happening. 

I'm sorry you're dealing with a controlling parent. I had to cut mine out of my life after I was old enough and brave to. I hope things improve for you, and please keep sticking up for yourself.

ETA: I just saw that the comment regarding being in the US was not your comment, so I don't know where you are or what the laws are there. I'd still try to contact the doctor's office, even anonymously at first, to see what their policies are on this."
tifu,f6a9fbz,t1_f69ka4r,1572753728.0,"20 *minutes*?! Are you a machine?

For real though, all of this. Sex is so much fun and shouldn't be stressful or over thought. Of course you want an orgasm. Of course you want her to have like 15 in a row, 14 more than she's ever had with anyone else ever, but, like, that's just not real life. 

Also, if that is real life for anyone I absolutely don't want to hear it. Let me live in my bubble of denial."
