libertarianmeme,ffqbi7f,t1_ffq611x,1580129299.0,"Well, that’s impressive, I’m not going to lie. Not in a “wow he completely dismantled my argument” way, but “wow, I’ve never seen a more idealistic view of humanity and the world” way. I’m not going to spend as much time addressing your points as you because I’m a “WaGe SlAvE wHO has tO.... *gasp* go to work!!”

- so your cited literarture for the fucking “economic efficiency” of hippies is laughable. Everything is economically efficient in a system of 5000 people or less you absolute assclown, do you not understand that economies don’t scale with the same proportions.

Chemical engineer here, if I know anything it’s that shit that works in a vacuum doesn’t work in real life, and you can apply that metaphor to nearly every claim you 
made.

Then you somehow are able to defend the Soviet state capitalism model, and in the next paragraph mention *anarchist literature*.

I thought... based you your previous comments... you were defending the socialist soviet and chinese systems. You can’t have it both ways.  But if I must I’ll choose the anarchist ways over the commies 100% of the time.

I really don’t have time to actually analyze this comment right now, it’s interesting, not going to lie, but reminds me of something a grad student would write to me before going on a co-op to Vietnam or China, only to come back completely disenfranchised with the world after witnessing the immense human cruelty that doesn’t just magically disappear when you introduce “equitable” systems."

Neverbrokeabone,ffpqsl7,t1_ffpfza1,1580102441.0,"I can see you’re point, but I’m still gonna laugh at people that say lactase production is “white privilege” because it makes no sense. Would having a lower risk of skin cancer make someone have “black privilege”? Of course not, white privilege is real, and is a product of society.

I like this sub, and I’m sure there are people that harbor racist views, but expressing them through drinking milk is... really lame imo. This map is actually somewhat incorrect, there are higher rates of lactase production in northern india and parts of subsaharan Africa that is inherent in specific Indian and African pastoralists, meaning that it’s not an exclusively white trait. Hell I have white friends that are lactose intolerant."
