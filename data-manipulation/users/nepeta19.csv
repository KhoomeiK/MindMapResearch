Also so sorry to hear your awful story of losing your cat, sending my sympathies."
CatsEnjoyingPets,ffkw4ma,t1_ffjl2d2,1580030080.0,Yep!!
CatsEnjoyingPets,ffjj2bj,t1_ffje1vw,1579999346.0,She's a complete tart. Melts for any type of contact. She was on my lap this evening and I grabbed all four paws in my hand and jiggled them around while tickling her belly and she was buzzing and buzzing away.

geocaching,ffi9dh8,t1_ffi73s5,1579968440.0,Exactly. It doesn't bode well for future cache maintenance if the CO is looking for automation and shortcuts. (But I'm also a bit biased against power trails since the area where my three individual and hand-made caches are was swamped with a drive-by series of 100 identical gaffa-tape covered coke bottles littering the underside of bushes and now all I get is copy/paste logs for the trail...).

AmItheAsshole,fegbgkm,t1_feg6v00,1579086264.0,"There's definitely hope and your journal prompt idea sounds a great approach for bridging that gap and getting confidence back. I've gradually been able to use art to express myself a bit, and have been keeping a ""functional"" journal for a while (tracking health stuff etc) and that's gradually started to incorporate a bit more about my thoughts. 



Thank you for sharing, yes the scars are deep and I'm sorry you've been subjected to a horrible breach of trust but we can become stronger over time, don't rush it, be kind to yourself."

AmItheAsshole,fef2m19,t1_feeqli3,1579046710.0,Your post totally resonated with me and I'm kicking myself for not realising sooner about the removal of an important outlet. I was also a similar age when my mum's partner (stepdad equivalent) read my diary and accidentally let it slip by mentioning something that I had only ever referred to in my diary. I destroyed the diary and ever since (28 years now (fuck I feel old)) I've had real trouble feeling secure writing down my thoughts / journalling etc even through horrible mental health problems. I should have made the connection before. Thank you for your post and totally YTA to the OP.
