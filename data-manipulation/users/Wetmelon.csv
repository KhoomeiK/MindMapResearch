Generally speaking, I talk about statically allocated or initialized objects as living on the ""heap"".  This isn't exactly correct, although it can be.   It's implementation defined, as far as I know.

It's generally safer to refer to the ""storage duration"" rather than stack/static/heap.  Automatic, static, and dynamic storage duration.  As you said, it's safest to use automatic and static storage duration as much as possible, and only use dynamic storage to allocate once at the beginning of the program and then never use it again.  This is the rule used for safety-critical systems.

embedded,fdauous,t1_fdaqkes,1578250421.0,"To answer your other questions directly:

> my first thought is ""limited system resources"". Is this still true?

Broadly speaking, yes.  We're going to much faster processors quickly, but the algorithms are also becoming more complex.  Cost is still the driving factor, so you're either working within the framework of the device, or picking a device that works near its limit given the algorithms you've made.

> What is the testing process?

* **Model in the loop tests (MIL)** (e.g. in MATLAB/Simulink prior to code generation).  Usually with a plant model.

* **Software in the loop tests (SIL)**.  Unit testing, static code analysis, integration testing on the development machine.

* **Processor in the loop tests (PIL)**.  Instead of the controller reading the hardware directly, we tell it to read from eg. a CAN message, and the core functionality of the software is still run on the target hardware.  Response is analyzed on the development machine, often hooked into the aforementioned plant model.

* **I/O bench tests** to verify that the hardware reads the inputs correctly.  Using the final wiring harness pinout, does it read the angle sensor correctly?  Does flipping the parking brake switch to ON actually read as ON internally?  Or did you typo it and send it to the wrong pin?

* **Hardware in the loop tests (HIL)** where the controller is fed hardware inputs and the test bench can read the hardware outputs, so the controller thinks it's running a machine.

* **Commissioning, Verification, & Validation.**  Once the controller is put in the machine, verify that the software actually meets the customer's specification in the full-up hardware test.  In my world, this means that ""when I push forward on the joystick, the machine drives forwards"" and other such functional tests.  Also, if you unplug a joystick, does the machine respond safely?  Is the acceleration/deceleration rate correct?  Setup the hundreds or thousands of parameters for tuning the machine just the way the customer wants.

Generally the hardware itself is tested by the hardware guys and they'll tell you ""don't put more than 36 volts on this pin or it'll let the smoke out and then we can't guarantee the behaviour of the hardware""

> If you were to add someone to your team with little embedded experience, what qualities would you look for?

The real trick with embedded is understanding that you're part of the *system* now.  In desktop applications you're largely protected against this - you have a very specific API, you're living in user space, etc.  But in embedded your user space is the entire processor, and you have to interact with a whole electromechanical system.  There are no guarantees that the system is going to respond to your inputs exactly the way you expect it to.  In short, I think one of the best traits is to have a very methodical process to debugging from inputs to outputs."

Power = Torque \* Speed

So you theoretically have a linear increase in power up to a maximum power (based on the ability to reject heat), then a flat power up to the maximum speed. The “flat power” region occurs above “base speed” where the back EMF of the motor equals the battery voltage. After that point, you have to start reducing the stator field strength to reduce the back EMF and keep increasing in speed.

That results in a flat torque curve up to the maximum power then a 1/x curve as the torque has to be traded for speed to make that equation work.

And then in reality, power actually drops off above “base speed” due to a drop in efficiency. The efficiency sweet spot for common vehicle motors is about 1/4 to 1/2 of max torque at about 45% of max speed, so this is roughly where the motors should be sized for cruising"
