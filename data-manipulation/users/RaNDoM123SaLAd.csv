Started me off with 1000. So not enough of a limit to completely mess you up if you screw up. Also, there's little to know fees and cashback. I have other cards now but I still use it as my main since it's just a good card all around."

You must let the cotton or coil wick in more juice, and let the juice cool down a bit. It's okay if the tank is warm, but not hot (also the hotter the liquid the better chance of gunk buildup).

Just take a puff, not too long and sort of inhale deeply to get the most out of it. I find doing that saves me from buying so much juice as I go thru is slower."
