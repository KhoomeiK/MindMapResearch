modernwarfare,fff6lnp,t1_ffecse3,1579877024.0,People chomping chips and esting with their mouths open is the absolute worst for me. That and kids screaming lol but i have a few so i get that but i mute myself so noone has to hear it.
modernwarfare,ffaa06b,t1_ffa6nqf,1579730794.0,Im saying there is 2 more downloads adter that one lol
modernwarfare,ffa6sbb,t1_ff9rku0,1579728987.0,I have wired gig and inhave the same thing happen. Mostly with pistols amd shottys. Seems like the closer you are the worse the hit reg is.
modernwarfare,ffa5ud3,t1_ffa5azl,1579728469.0,They made shipmwnt 5v5 last time it was on too
modernwarfare,ffa5btx,t1_ff9oe20,1579728182.0,Its not small tho. Its like 44 gig lol
modernwarfare,ffa57ii,t1_ff9o6ec,1579728116.0,Then a 14 and 9 after that. After the game loads itll make you install mp pack 2 and a spec ops thing. They couldnt just make one update smdh
modernwarfare,ff9pj8e,t3_esg2m5,1579718057.0,I take you didnt play blops 4 lol was like a 10gig update almost every tuesday. Hopefully there are alot of fixes in this update.
modernwarfare,ff1rwn6,t1_ff0fzt3,1579484820.0,This pisses me off lol like im 10 ft from the dude amd he still lives. This game i tell ya
modernwarfare,feop3yl,t1_feofi37,1579303391.0,You said you play for nothing so i was just pointing out that i play for fun. And personally this is the downside of not having a prestige system.
modernwarfare,feooy0z,t1_fenyzse,1579303314.0,I didnt start playing till mw3ish and honestly cant remember having it happen on such a consistent basis. But thats just me lol
modernwarfare,fenxp72,t1_fenv3z7,1579292370.0,How many in blops 4 could you do that in? Besides maybe nuketown. Ww2 def wasnt that way and grenade spam was horrendous in that game
modernwarfare,fenxiw2,t1_fentqbp,1579292274.0,"I wanna say id get anywhere from 4k to 8k per match. Also depends on how many rounds ya go and how good ya do. 
I loved gunfight! I couldnt play tdm or dom cuz the campers were kinda killin it for me and i cant sit still for more than 10 seconds lol"
modernwarfare,fenu6ts,t1_fenihxj,1579290786.0,I maxed out last week. I play for fun lol
modernwarfare,fentmlw,t1_fenqxk5,1579290641.0,Uh i beg to differ. I wouldnt say theyre shitty but they sure arent very good. When you can chuck a nade from your spawn to the other teams spawn within the first 3 seconds id say theres a problem.(lookin at you picadilly)
modernwarfare,fentdv7,t1_fenqbv9,1579290539.0,S0 i got max level playing gunfight only. Didnt take that long either. S1 i play mostly hcsnd and its about the same. Just feelings wise anyway.
Dexter,fekl7jv,t1_fek6h2t,1579202360.0,Especially one that poisoned him and deb lol but i was hoping for a happy ending for Dexter.
legaladvice,feigeic,t1_feifhcv,1579137922.0,That makes sense. Def gonna look into it. Thank you!
Dexter,feh9vsp,t3_eoyq7i,1579112173.0,Yeah i hate that they killed Deb. Was so unnecessary. I thought hey Dex is giving up killing and hookin Deb up with a huge arrest before leaving. Buuuut no they couldnt do that. A happy ending of Deb making that arrest and Dex getting to live happily ever after would have been great for me. So disappointed in the ending.
modernwarfare,febogj1,t1_febil69,1578961031.0,I was thinking this too until yesterday. Every single match was just sweaty. My group would get one decent game in and then wed be put up against seal team 6 for the next 5 or more games. We arent great by any stretch but we kicked ass all week till Sunday. Same thing today. Hit reg seemed way off too. We play hcsnd amd we were all getting a shit ton of hit markers and ghost bullets and seemingly invisible enemies.
legaladvice,fe4ri24,t1_fe4g6ly,1578862106.0,Wouldnt i have to contact the owner to have an arborist assess the tree?
OldSchoolCool,fdvz3o9,t1_fdtxl0d,1578753321.0,Well it was an awkward look for what felt like an eternity but was actually about all of 2 seconds lol

Dexter,fdvyu26,t1_fdt4uea,1578753215.0,Yeah i stuck to it and now it has me back to being intrigued. Just finished the part where he creamates that guy and calls deb.
modernwarfare,fdvy8u8,t1_fdt4sja,1578753136.0,Making quick changes is one thing but to wdit an entire class is ridiculous lol i play snd so there isnt enough time
OldSchoolCool,fdt0wku,t1_fdsvd6a,1578710481.0,I just threw up in my mouth lol thanks a lot
Dexter,fdt0t3c,t1_fdswsn0,1578710448.0,To each their own. Was just asking a question.
Dexter,fdt0pi6,t1_fdsoz5n,1578710412.0,Ok good. Really liking the show. Ill stick er out. Thank you
Dexter,fdsntap,t3_ekmahp,1578705635.0,I hated how they did this. She killed her guys and then just im done. Kinda lame. I felt bad for dexter lol poor guy cant win man
Dexter,fdsn24q,t1_fdqgdaq,1578705363.0,Dude i said the same thing to my wife lol i think she had some work done.
Dexter,fdsmwbj,t1_fdpxgz2,1578705306.0,Im with you. He looked good prior but not looks like a crack head.
OldSchoolCool,fdsmkdj,t1_fdsfqbs,1578705168.0,You dirty bastard!!  Lol

OldSchoolCool,fds1xen,t1_fdrxirq,1578693061.0,It was pretty late and i may or may not have turned my tv on when i was supposed to be sleeping lol
OldSchoolCool,fds1p78,t1_fdrth2k,1578693015.0,Noooo! I dont wanna think about it! That pic has brought flashbacks and maybe a little ptsd
OldSchoolCool,fds1kie,t1_fdrjebu,1578692957.0,Except for me lol forever will that win be associated with that traumatic event
modernwarfare,fdrrxog,t1_fdrq2h9,1578688872.0,I wouldnt say extremely well. Personally i hate the constant do good and do bad thing. Its like a never ending rollercoaster. But it is what it is and i still play hours daily.
modernwarfare,fdrrsy0,t1_fdrqve8,1578688799.0,Ruined for some. I hate sbmm but still love to play the game.
modernwarfare,fdrrowi,t1_fdro2id,1578688738.0,Can not wait for more cac!!
modernwarfare,fdrrk98,t1_fdrnpd9,1578688670.0,Ill second this! Good to see some quality comms and know theyre working on some issues.
OldSchoolCool,fdr6z6c,t1_fdr6usq,1578680311.0,If i get what i got from him then he sure aint a pacer lmao
OldSchoolCool,fdr6vkz,t1_fdqyciv,1578680250.0,Try not to think about it lol
OldSchoolCool,fdqu88j,t3_emrelr,1578674977.0,I remember watching this. After the game i was so excited i burst into my parents room and.........yeah. scarred for life. But the Bulls won baby!!
offmychest,fdoyiec,t1_fdokjrc,1578615788.0,No kidding lol i will have to give that a whirl. Thanks!!
offmychest,fdn6aqw,t3_em9131,1578578468.0,Was just thinking this last night on my way home. Some asshat behind me was blinding me even with the dimming rear view. So naturally i threw up my youre number finger and moved on. Then had the displeasure of having some monster ass truck with about 10 of those lights on come at me and seriously i was seeing spots after. We should be able to tint all our windows if these things are allowed to exist.
Xbox_One_X,fdidgs0,t1_fdib4ue,1578440411.0,This was the tipping point for me. PS has so many more really good exclusives. Still love my x1x tho
eagles,fdfs95r,t1_fdfprec,1578368932.0,Imagine if that idiot missed and hurt his own dumb ass lol
eagles,fdfs75z,t1_fdfol8r,1578368896.0,Thats pathetic. Cant be ignorant of your own teams shit man. Dirty is dirty
eagles,fdfofqk,t1_fdfd75p,1578366397.0,He must be a troll man. Any ome who watched the replay can clearly see that d bag lower is head. Fucking people man
eagles,fdfoajy,t1_fdfhz4c,1578366302.0,"Right?! He was freaking behind Wentz! His ""tackle"" wouldnt have saved anything for them other than to mess him up. After reseeing what he did to foles last year this ass wipe should be suspended."
eagles,fdfo38m,t1_fdfhqqp,1578366169.0,Wether he gave himself up or not spearing or whatever should have been called.
Dexter,fd5awxl,t1_fd1vml7,1578175857.0,I cant believe they killed her off! I just started s4 and i have to take a break. Dex and Deb cant catch a break.
offmychest,fczvg32,t1_fczj4t8,1578109289.0,"I agree other than the jacking off bit. As an American i am not killing anyone nor do i wish harm on any innocent person from any where in the world. Lets not group Americans into this political bs. The greedy American politicians who are pushing these ""wars"" are to blame. My philosophy is live and let live."
modernwarfare,fcyhm5v,t1_fcwn550,1578080301.0,Like they did with shipment. Seriously hoping theyre working on a slight redesign to help spawns.
modernwarfare,fcyhhpq,t1_fcyd1a2,1578080232.0,Just wanted to sneak a thank you in for being responsive!
modernwarfare,fcxeyhf,t1_fcwv9c8,1578061160.0,Im not sure which side youre arguing for lol
modernwarfare,fcvm9zs,t1_fcvlf22,1578005145.0,"Cuz of the ""early access"" to attachments. Please. Some of these people will bitch about anything man. They cant be happy with the fact that they arent locking op weapons behind a paywall. Truly sad"
Xbox_One_X,fcsmmae,t1_fcs7o0p,1577919788.0,Exactly this. Each mistake is an opportunity to do better next time.
Xbox_One_X,fcs3hxf,t3_ein6hb,1577910919.0,That was the dumbest thing i think ive half watched in a while.
offmychest,fc1bs4t,t3_efj863,1577314045.0,If he gets cod dm me his gamertag amd we can play! Well done op!!
modernwarfare,fbfcqox,t1_fbewwav,1576807376.0,Could not agree more man
