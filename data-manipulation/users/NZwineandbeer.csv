Yes there have been way way way way way more attempts and  violent revolutions than peaceful ones through history. The point is, the success rate for peaceful protest massively massively outweighs the success rate for violent protest.

Hong Kong isn't a Sovereign Democratic Nation and its currently going a hell of a lot better than It would be if the protestors were attempting to combat the Chinese Army with Guns... Hell of a lot better. More world coverage. There a reason for the protestors to so actively hold on to remaining as peaceful as possible. It protects them."
