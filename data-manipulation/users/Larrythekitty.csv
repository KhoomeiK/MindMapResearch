nfl,fezgxx1,t3_eqn2ks,1579457211.0,I just got done with that Aaron Hernandez documentary and all I can think is “that’s quite the beard Fischer is wearing”.
nfl,fev7wkj,t1_fetfzez,1579394252.0,I thought we both agreed to just forget this whole season.
nfl,fev655z,t3_eqjft8,1579393495.0,Frank Clark is a stout DE and plays the run well. Earl Thomas is an undersized ball-hawking center fielder that gets to light up big guys while they're trying to catch the ball. While I don't expect the Chiefs to stop Henry I'd be surprised to see Clark get man handled by him. Not to rain on the circle jerk.

Seahawks,fee52nx,t3_eon252,1579026558.0,KC fans were on big Frank's case for the first 3/4 of the year. The tune has changed recently.
Seahawks,fe9fiwr,t3_eo1iap,1578937097.0,"This team over-achieved all year long. Slow stars predictably caught up to them. Seattle needs to run the hurry up in the first quarter for a couple of drives to get the offense flowing. I understand that could backfire in terms of TOP, but we've lost TOP in the first half of almost every game we played this year. Tons of fight in this team, there's a young nucleus forming. Hopefully those young guys makes a big jump and we can address the pass rush and slow starts(philosophy shift pls) going into next year."
technology,fe4aidu,t1_fe2qc5j,1578857325.0,"Tesla has been proactive in sharing technology with other manufacturers to speed electric adoption/rollout. The core idea behind most Musk companies is about helping save the planet, while making a profit and labeling people pedophiles of course. It would be more beneficial for China if they didn’t still have so much coal, but that’s becoming largely rural. So these city cars will likely benefit the environment depending on their root power source."

nfl,fdga2je,t1_fde0wnh,1578386612.0,"The beauty of social media is that if you hop online and throw a big enough fit early enough you can build a position that talking heads are afraid to challenge.  Oh wait no, that’s why social media is dog shit and creates a self perpetuating echo chamber. My bad."

nfl,fc5sg37,t3_eg39dg,1577464842.0,The Browns need leadership. I think Baker could fill that role. He still has a lot of room for growth. I can’t say the same for the coach. Both figuratively and literally.
AlaskaAirlines,fc5kqo1,t1_fc5jjf7,1577460225.0,Alaska was no help. I cancelled the flight and booked with southwest. Alaska wanted to connect me to Portland with another 4 hour layover and then into SF in the middle of rush hour to drive to San Jose. This isn’t the first time I’ve had these issues with Alaska. I once had a flight to Hawaii delayed 8 hours costing me entire day off a vacation I had already paid for.
