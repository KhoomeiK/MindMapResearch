vegan,ff6d9wt,t1_ff6ca77,1579624685.0,I can see how it might come across that way - I’m more so trying to understand why there seems to be such a horrid divide.
vegan,ff6coop,t1_ff5xcf9,1579624316.0,I know the difference - I take issue with the divide when plant based people are our allies not our enemies as they’re already doing much more than any other dietary group for the planet and sustainability and animals. Regardless if they claim to be vegan or not. Some people just don’t wanna be associated with the political aspect of it yet. And that’s ok.

vegan,ff6c33t,t1_ff5y6yl,1579623936.0,It’s def not a thought of mine - it’s something I see regularly. I don’t understand the bitter divide between vegan and plant based. I think it’s dumb.
vegan,ff6bx0e,t1_ff64jck,1579623829.0,It’s a common comment I’ve seen where vegans mock PBDs and shit on them for not doing enough.
vegan,ff6bokd,t1_ff62t7y,1579623676.0,Thank you for your comment. I’m not always the best at articulating my thoughts especially when I’m a bit riled up by dumb shit I see. What you’re saying is pretty much the just of what I was feeling. I don’t understand why there’s such a divide and hatred that seems to be directed toward PBD from certain vegans.
vegan,ff6bk12,t1_ff62k4n,1579623597.0,I’m aware of what veganism is but PBD people are our allies more so than any other dieter. That’s where I take issue. It’s like going plant based isn’t enough to some vegans and they shit on people who just don’t take the vegan title or don’t claim to be activists if they aren’t activists. I think those who go PBD are just trying to not be hypocrites.

unpopularopinion,ff4t8fw,t1_ff4sszo,1579571887.0,Because the majority of rape cases go un prosecuted and the men get off scotch free while the woman is forced to relive her trauma.
unpopularopinion,ff3u2sx,t1_ff3j3pp,1579548866.0,Some of our cheapest ass states have tried drug testing for all government assistance too. Which is a huge waste of time.
unpopularopinion,ff3tynw,t1_ff3je9t,1579548794.0,Absolutely. And if the alleged father himself doesn’t want a DNA test he should be able to opt out too. With or without his name on the certificate. The current laws are fucking stupid.
unpopularopinion,ff3tuxp,t1_ff3jo73,1579548731.0,Because you can make that kind of judgment based on a few comments online. Yeah ok. You seem like a judgmental asshole. So there ya go.
unpopularopinion,ff3kgfm,t1_ff3hn6p,1579542955.0,"While your post is incredibly callous I am an open book. So here it goes.

I knew my abuser for years before he abused me. I was close to his sister from age 15 on. So I knew him through her and before he graduated from our school. I saw him a year after I graduated high school at a club, we danced and started dating pretty much immediately after that. I was 21. At first he was sweet and romantic. Slowly he turned toxic over the course of the first 8 months of our relationship. He cheated, he’d beg for forgiveness, I took him back because I thought I was in love with him. He had slowly mentally terrorized me by putting these ideas in my head that I was worthless / couldn’t do better than him. I tho got he would go back to the sweet romantic guy that I knew and he came from a shitty family where his father abused him so I knew he was damaged and I thought he just needed someone to love him unconditionally. So I tried. Then I found out I was pregnant. That’s around the same time he started hitting me or throwing shit at me when he would get angry. I left him several times throughout the pregnancy and kept going back because he would threaten to kill me. He had a criminal record by this point so I believed he would do it. I knew who he knew I knew he was capable of violence. we were broken up when I gave birth but he wanted to be there for the birth and he was so kind to me it felt like maybe the birth of our daughter had changed him. It didn’t. 6 months into her life when I was 23 he was still cheating, mentally and emotionally abusing me, hitting me, and he wasn’t helping me with her so I broke it off with him. I stopped being afraid because I had to be strong for my daughter. I didn’t want her to see that happen to me and think it was OK. I told him he could still be in her life but he refused. He wouldn’t have anything to do with her. Even tried to get his parents to be in her life without him but they dropped us too. I went for paternity testing and child support when she was 2 while I was trying to put myself through college so I could provide a better life for her than living in poverty in the ghetto. He never paid. I worked my ass off, I went to therapy to overcome my trauma, and I still suffer from PTSD as a result of what I went through. I now am very successful, I make more money per year than he could ever dream of and I have provided a safe, happy, healthy life for my daughter - as well as a father who truly loves her and WANTS her. 

This is why I can speak to these topics - I lived it."

In turn I’ve become wildly successful thanks to the drive I had for wanting to be a good role model and provider for her."
unpopularopinion,ff37dbu,t1_ff37471,1579535439.0,If there’s a man there who wants to have a DNA test then by all means have a DNA test. I was merely referring to not forcing it in terms of forcing a woman to name a father at live births  :)
