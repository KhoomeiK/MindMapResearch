SuicideWatch,ffmnd4q,t3_et77yu,1580056894.0,"Response to your Edit: You have to be willing to be helped, otherwise what are you doing here? People are pouring their hearts out for you; it's only going to be productive if **you allow it to be**."
SuicideWatch,ffmeczz,t1_ffjkihz,1580053295.0,"Your history is telling; nearly every comment that isn't recent is positively dripping with vitriol, nearly all of your interactions are as negative as possible. **You** have to **do something** to escape that **mindset** for yourself. I noticed it tapered off here recently. Maybe you were just going through a really bad time, I don't know.

I'm not writing this comment to shit on you, I'm just trying to point this out to you in case you missed it. You have a post detailing loneliness, you can't find friends, it sucks because you consider yourself extroverted. But who would want to be friends with this attitude:

**""Bro please shut the fuck up. You think this shit is helping anyone? Stop with the bluepilled happy go lucky shit.""**

**""Your ass prolly is stupid. Send pics so I can further investigate""**

**""Hey least one of us is an actual WARRIOR and not a pussy with no ability to think for himself""**

**Fuck**, that kind of talk will **depress anybody**. I'm sure it isn't doing any favors to the **one saying it**. 

You don't like **""bluepilled happy go lucky shit""** so I'm trying to show you the facts right now. This is what is keeping people away from you; that Bluepill shit is how friends are made; it's how we cope with the shittiness in life that **we all experience**. Your past might suck a lot, **many of ours do**, but that doesn't mean you have to fold to it.

**""Answer his question or don’t say shit at all""** 

What did that accomplish? You have Google, look the shit up it, it isn't hard. You're coming to a place for people **like you** who need **support** because **life sucks**, and shitting on the people who **need the most help**. That guy isn't spouting his happy go lucky shit because he wants to make **you miserable**, he's doing it because he wants to help, why would he want to help? Because he's likely **been through this shit himself**. Just like me, just like many on here.

I want to help you, I want to be your ""Reddit friend"" you said you wouldn't mind having, because I'd like to see you and everyone else who's going through shit come out the other side of it, without doing something that, yes, like it or not, **destroys everyone around you**. It does, go to r/suicidebereavement if you haven't, it absolutely crushes your family and anyone who cared about you in the slightest.

Open up about your past, please, let people bounce some ideas off of you, **that** is **how** you **heal** and make life worth living. Let me try to help, we can just fucking talk, it's fine, I'm down. I cannot solve all of your problems, but all anyone can do is try to help you figure shit out, you have to be **willing** to be helped.

If your reaction to this is to come up with some hateful insult for me, go for it. Maybe you'll get an upvote for your trouble, but I'm not going to respond to stupid. I'd be more than happy to get to know you and your situation though, if you'd like to talk like adults. 

Yes, I care, why else would I bother. Don't hurt youself, please."
