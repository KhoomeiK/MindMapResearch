I've done a tour of Schell's Brewery in New Ulm, MN years ago and someone asked if they planned to start making really hoppy beers like what was happening on the west coast. The tour guide got really serious and said ""no, we don't plan to ever make those kinds of beers. We think they are just a dad and don't actually make for good drinking and we aren't gonna change what we do just to chase around fads"". This is a brewery that has been around since before prohibition and even sold alcohol free beer durring prohibition (turns out at the time in Minnesota every third house had a still so people would just buy the beer and add a shot to it). They make some seriously good beers and many great flavorful varieties but they don't make super hoppy bullshit and I think that's great."
