todayilearned,fgwo7f3,t1_fgwnpyc,1581163875.0,"Ah, classic tactic of manipulation.  You are doing exactly what you say I'm doing. You never addressed what I said.  You literally said I was trying a hail Mary and theyln you tried to sound tough. You haven't addressed how you edited your comments after I already responded.  Another classic tactic of someone on Reddit that got caught in there lies. Tell the person they are bored and to fuck off, once again trying to sound tough and edgy, on the internet at that. What are you trying to prove? Like I said, I hope that you find the help that you need."
todayilearned,fgwncsh,t1_fgwh970,1581163503.0,"Oh my fucking lord. I just looked at a couple of your posts, and they are so fucking sad. I dont believe a thing you have said in this conversation. Some weird shit about really trying to go after people that hurt you in the past. I hope you find the help that you need."
todayilearned,fgwmvom,t1_fgwh970,1581163315.0,"Lol, and you edit your comments after I respond to them. Your the one that sounds like you have way too much to prove, and would be eaten alive. I never said shit about your grammar or your wannabe gangster friends. I said you sound stupid when you contradict yourself in the same sentence."
todayilearned,fgwh1vg,t1_fgwgp2a,1581161025.0,The way you word it is stupid as fuck then. Learn how to write. You literally say it isn't gangster except and then list 3 things. You contradict yourself in the same sentence.
todayilearned,fgwg4kw,t1_fgwc8yo,1581160726.0,"""There was nothing gangster about him, except"" and then you list 3 things, lol."
todayilearned,fgwflb2,t1_fgwcop1,1581160620.0,"Those both were definitely made up in the spot. You can tell by the way they rap, it's easy as fuck to tell. Kendrick repeats a line to think of more to rhyme, A$AP MOB they are also freestyling and take the mic from one another when they know it's getting dicy."
apexlegends,fgw54j2,t1_fgvgauv,1581156905.0,Dive trails for pred.
pics,fgvdx5u,t3_f0l0br,1581146170.0,Is this real?
apexlegends,fguqy7l,t1_fgu59ev,1581127390.0,"Yup, that's what I'm saying! If I'm gonna get put with golds, why not let me choose them at least."
apexlegends,fguhxbw,t1_fguhrso,1581121234.0,"Yup, exactly,  you know you jumped to conclusions without properly reading what I wrote, I even just went back and checked, you just responded without reading the whole post and comments or didn't read, or are just fucking stupid, and like I said, pathetic!"
apexlegends,fguho05,t1_fgufw3j,1581121050.0,"No, actually you still have no idea how to read. I mentioned it was 4 for me, it was 2 for someone else. Maybe you should learn how to comprehend what you read before trying to call someone out. I was never looking for an argument. But clearly you are. I literally said it was different for different people. You are the only idiot wall here. Stop trying to sound edgy and cool on the internet,  its pathetic."
apexlegends,fgufkrq,t1_fgufbdh,1581119580.0,"You dumbass! I said it lasted for 4 matches.  It wasn't just 1 or 2. It has been different, for different people. Also, how am I supposed to know when I look at someone on my friends list, at 9pm on tuesday, that they didnt make it to diamond.  A lot of people appear offline. I didn't know he was at class until the next day, so we went ahead and grinded up to diamond, thinking he somehow already did. We arent good enough friends to where I have his personal number, so I didn't ask him. He then joined us the next day, and we played a few diamond matches, then it reverted him to gold. You can call me impatient all you want, it doesnt change the fact that Respawn is matching me with players that they wouldnt allow me to queue with in a lobby if I was friends with them, so how is that even close to fair??"
apexlegends,fguecm3,t1_fgue281,1581118737.0,"Actually, there is a glitch where it shows your wrong rank.. We didn't know that the first day, and it showed your combined rp when logged on. It showed him as diamond 4 on my list, then after 2 games it showed him his correct issue. This is now a known issue,  but none of us knew this in tuesday. It literally was showing everybody as higher ranks than they were. Is that my fault too? It literally let him play with us for 2 matches, then the game realized he was gold, so it stopped letting us play. This is a known and confirmed issue."
apexlegends,fgue3fs,t1_fgudyvi,1581118564.0,"Lol, I literally played 6 solo queue games in a row. I got gold teammates in every game. Now I'm a liar I guess! There was a plat player in one of them.lz but the 3rd was gold."
apexlegends,fgudtub,t1_fgucf5b,1581118381.0,"I NEVER SAID I WAS PLACED DIAMOND! I said I grinded up to it in 3 to 4 hours, please learn how to read."
apexlegends,fgudrcw,t1_fgudodq,1581118336.0,"He gets 5k plus damage in pubs, and was diamond last season, but I had surgery so I stopped playing after hitting pred, his skill is definitely there."
apexlegends,fgudocz,t1_fguckmm,1581118278.0,"It wasn't that I was impatient.  I had the day off and he had class? I was pointing out that it us stupid to implement a rule like that, and then give solo diamond players, gold teammates anyways..."
apexlegends,fgudjua,t1_fguclrb,1581118191.0,Ohhh so that explains why I get put with golds anyways in the games matchmaking.  Take your negativity somewhere else.
apexlegends,fgub9sk,t1_fguagq8,1581116663.0,"Yea, it just sucks because I grinded from plat 2 to diamond 3 in a few hours, on Tuesday.  He couldnt play tuesday, so we literally couldnt play ranked together the last 2 days, which sucks."
apexlegends,fgu9x01,t1_fgu98eu,1581115769.0,"Right, but I could be predator or close if I was allowed to queue with them and they would be high plat or close to diamond,  but now each of us are forced to solo queue and I get put with golds anyways, that dont have a mic and just go off on their own... they are paying a gold entry fee and I'm paying a diamond,  atleast let me choose my teammate because these randoms just dgaf."
apexlegends,fgu9s2x,t1_fgu9fpf,1581115679.0,"Right, so if they are gonna put me with people that are 2 tiers below me, anyways, why not let me choose who they are?"
apexlegends,fgu8qwv,t1_fgu7ip2,1581115039.0,"Then their matchmaking should also make it so I only get put with diamonds or one rank lower, but I solo queued plenty and every game got golds with me. How is that fair?"
apexlegends,fgu8n7o,t1_fgu5g3p,1581114980.0,"What did he do to himself? The point is that I can't queue with golds as a diamond, but when I solo queue I get put with golds anyways...."
apexlegends,fgu8h26,t1_fgu59ev,1581114885.0,"Yup, exactly what I'm saying. Atleast let me have my gold friends be my teammates, they communicate and push with me, and the only reason they didnt got pred eas lack of time because we only played as a squad and they had school and I didnt"
apexlegends,fgu8dzw,t1_fgu3fi0,1581114829.0,"I think you failed to understand what I'm saying. I tried to clarify with my comment,  but I said the same thing originally up above."
apexlegends,fgu8c42,t1_fgu3fi0,1581114795.0,"I was placed in plat, he was placed in gold. You are right. But in the half day he was at classes, I went from plat 2 to diamond 3. Now he cant queue with me, but of course, when I solo queue, both my teammates are gold..... how is it fair that their mat making system will put them on my team, but I can't choose one of my friends list...."
apexlegends,fgqm4ro,t3_ezwyty,1581026833.0,"I mean, technically you did fall to the ground faster, thus getting said boost!"
MouseReview,fgo52aj,t1_fgo4mo0,1580959963.0,"I know the Glorious D is hit and miss right now with the first batch that just went out, but mine performs flawlessly.  No bend or creak when flexing it. Great button response, great sensor. Great weight and durability/build quality, all for under 50 dollars.

Edit: I hate wireless products, and with a cord bungee, this mouse feels wireless."
apexlegends,fgo2fyr,t1_fgo1g4q,1580958211.0,Another reminder. Gibby revives people in 2 seconds if in his dome shield. A lot of people dont know this!
MouseReview,fgnzidy,t1_fgny816,1580956345.0,"Lol, no it doesn't. Making a cheap mouse, is the reason for bad build quality. Companies trying to jump on a popular product,  that didnt use the right materials or do the proper R&D."
apexlegends,fgnzbdc,t1_fgny0up,1580956221.0,"Yea, my squad climbed almost to diamond 2 last night, and noticed every team we died to had a Gibby, Lifeline or Wattson, and then Pathfinder or Wraith. Same with all the pro teams that were streaming last night/early this morning. Revenant was never on a squad we died to, and it wasn't because he just came out. His totem requires everybody to activate it, then you cant heal in it, then there is a max distance radius so it us hard to utilize it effectively. On top of that when you Respawn at it, you are one shot, plus whatever shields you had when you activate the totem, meaning a caustic ult or trap can effectively kill everyone that respawns at the totem, immediately.  His poison bomb is good, but miss and you don't have it for 25 seconds, and are all the sudden just a tall lanky soldier without an escape, and taking 5 percent extra damage. His passive climb is nice, but the crouch speed is useless in high tier play. 

TLDR: Read my first, above comment."

apexlegends,fgnwvrj,t3_ezkw5a,1580954660.0,He won't be used in the current meta. Pros wont play him in tournaments.
apexlegends,fgmue35,t1_fgjf7g3,1580932251.0,"I had to turn my internal capture and streaming capabilities off, just to see any sort of improvement,  and it was still rough."
apexlegends,fgmpjn4,t3_ezb46q,1580929427.0,"Damn, my parents woulda ripped the console out the wall and beat me with it. Anyone have the link to that dad finding out his son replaced the ps4 that was taken away? That clip is hilarious."
apexlegends,fgmoy6c,t1_fgl59ms,1580929068.0,"It's called bad integrity! Bad sportsmanship. It's called being fucking stupid.  If you really hit pred without the exploit. Then why do it at all later? You couldnt de rank from pred, like you can this season, so you are just a fucking moron. Delete your crybaby shit post telling everybody you cheated ."
COents,fgmocga,t1_fglo1gm,1580928702.0,"Yup, same here, even before I was a member, on rec side, everybody has been informative and nice."
apexlegends,fgljvme,t1_fgliydw,1580901384.0,"Lol, I'm so sure. Have fun back in your correct ranking."
apexlegends,fglhur2,t1_fgl3ze3,1580898544.0,Does it matter? You didn't get season 2 ranked because you tried to cheat your way in!
apexlegends,fgkm5sj,t3_eyym6y,1580868751.0,Yea you might want to look into something before spewing shit that isn't true. The ban hammer came down hard and I fucking love it.
apexlegends,fgj93zv,t1_fgj8yio,1580839419.0,"I won't argue that, but there is a feature in COD: Gunfight where you can talk to enemies moment you die/get kill and in between rounds, and some kids just use it say the n word repeatedly. Kids these days don't even shit talk, they never learned the art."
apexlegends,fgj8lw7,t3_eytz98,1580839122.0,"Yea this wouldn't be toxic, not one bit, especially since you can cancel and start finishers until the enemy rage quits, already."
EscapefromTarkov,fgj7yvv,t1_fgj6qfh,1580838749.0,It makes you irrelevant and you had your chance. You chose to be a disrespectful cock sucker. You can fuck off!
apexlegends,fghzmrd,t1_fghyzng,1580799138.0,"Fuckkkk, I thought they were maybe showing off a new SMG. It doesn't look like the r99 at all, with the fore grip and barrel, which led me to believe it isn't an r99."
apexlegends,fghyk8q,t3_eyb36o,1580798034.0,I noticed that Wattson is using a gun that hasn't been announced and isn't in the game yet. I think I know what it could be!
