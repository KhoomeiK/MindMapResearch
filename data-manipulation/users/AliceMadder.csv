In this specific case, to take that theory into consideration, we'd need to ignore a lot of the evidence because the OP refers to her grandfather and his father being twins, which couldn't be due to an familial increase in eggs being released, since it's on the sperm side.  We'd also have to ignore the grandma's brother, for the same reason.

&#x200B;

Another thing that occurs to me, is that I have read that the incidences of twins being conceived might be very high - as high as 1/10 - compared to the number of twins in which both survive to be born.  I've read that twins might be under-represented because, in many cases, one twin would die before the first scan.

Also, it's easy to say everyone should get the same chance to be judged on their grades, but not everyone started with the same opportunity to learn from the beginning.

So having had that experience (and not having watch the hour of video), I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt here, particularly with your comment pointing out the differences.  It's a similar case with *Battle Royale* and *Hunger Games* \- they're both about teenagers being forced to kill each other in a ""game"".  But, *Battle Royale* was basically our world (at the time) turned up to 11, and the teenagers died because of the relentless wheels of bureaucracy.  It happened millions of times in that world, and this one was only significant because they ended up with a true sociopath and someone who'd gone through the battle before in their class (and that coincidence only happened because it had happened so many times).  *Hunger Games* was inspired by the juxtaposition of reporting on war and reporting on celebrity, and I'm fully prepared to believe that Suzanne Collins hadn't read *Battle Royale* and came to her story independently because her entire focus and way of telling it are so different."
