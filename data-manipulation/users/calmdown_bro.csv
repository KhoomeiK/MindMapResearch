Watford in great shape, even though with Sarr out they should get a win. In the last 4 games between the two teams, Watford won 3 of them, 1 away.

Swansea playing home, really close to the promotion (playoff) zone, with 2 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss on the last 5 games overall (lost was away). Wigan lost their last game home, and in 5 games has 1 win, 2 draws and 2 losses. Home factor must be determinant for Swansea's win.
