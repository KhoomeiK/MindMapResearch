Leaving is just a matter of calling the elevator and it automatically returns to the ground floor.

We all already know that the Canadians are being held *only* because Canada is holding a suspected criminal. No matter what they claim, you can never trust what the CCP presents as their version of the truth. Their version of the truth is that the concentration camps in Xinjiang are basically schools (did you know that in mainland China, nobody knows anything about any concentration camps or government issues in Xinjiang?) the people in Hong Kong are just jobless thugs with nothing better to do (yes, really, that's what the CCP tells us here in China) and the kids in Beijing in '89 were trying to overthrow the government through violence. The CCP can *never* be trusted to tell you anything with a grain of truth in it.

Your ex is just using this as an excuse to vent and go on a power play. Your own parents are clearly not cognizant of the mental faculties of the average 17 year old.

That being said, you also gave him a choice. He made his choice. I would also question what he told your ex and parents. Of course they got the version where he was the angel and you were the devil. It's a known effect that people tend to sympathize with the first person to tell their side of any story. 

Your son needs time to figure out what he wants out of his life and relationship with his parents. Give him all the time he needs but remain firm.

People in China wander into thoroughfares all the time without bothering to look first to see if cars are coming because they think that laws are like some sort of magical forcefield that somehow prevent a half ton of steel, iron and glass from turning them into a mess on somebody's windshield.

The cities may be ""cleaner"" but they're still dirty as fuck. People are still pissing in the street.

Bureaucracy is... a non-sequitur. First of all, Chinese bureaucracy is inefficient as hell. Still stamping in triplicate, sending you from one line to another all day long. If that's what your idea of efficiency is, then you don't know what the word means in English or Chinese.

As for ""a better place to live than before""...if you say so. I guess going from shit to the rim of the bowl is ""better"" but it's still not good. 

More civilized? I don't know where you live but this place is very much still a clusterfuck of oblivious nongs wandering aimlessly and with total disregard for everybody else. As I've yet to see it any differently in any other part of this country, I'd say you don't know what the fuck you're talking about or you do but don't get paid to say that. The fact that a foreigner can't even access Youtube without buying illegal VPN access is your idea of ""better for foreigners""? STFU, wumao.

As for your comment about loser foreigners, that smacks of pure jealousy to me. If the times of the Wild East China are finally over then we'll wait to see the evidence. When I don't see KFG on my Meituan or hear Star Wars Cantina music (most certainly unlicensed) on a national, CCTV program then I'll consider re-evaluating my perception.

Nobody is upset about China getting more normal. Why would anybody be upset about that? The real issue is that ""more normal"" should include a little class amongst the population and some vague awareness that there are other people in the world that they have to think about from time to time."
China,ff2gg6h,t3_er7n0d,1579505069.0,"First off, the last thing you want to do is get a degree at any university in mainland China. University is something like an adult daycare here and what you'll learn is severely lowered in both quality and quantity.

Secondly, no, it's not weird that you'd want to move to China. It can be fascinating for the first-time visitor. I was in love with this place for the first few years I was here but now I can't wait to leave this shithole. 

That said, where you choose to go to makes your experience here positive or negative. I'm in the northeast which is sort of China's rustbelt. It's a dump. However, outside of the areas surrounding tier one cities, if you go to anywhere outside of urban areas, be prepared for a trip back in time. Running water in homes isn't always going to be there and you can forget about indoor bathrooms in the countryside. In fact, you can pretty much forget about bathrooms altogether as they just dig a hole and you can shit in that.

That being said, there's still a lot of historical stuff to see. Xi'an and the Terracotta Army is amazing and the Great Wall is everything you're probably imagining. The Forbidden City is worth checking out, to be sure (although there really isn't much to do after you've taken a few pictures) Beijing and Shanghai are futuristic and wonderful. Here's the thing, however: As you visit smaller and smaller places, they get more and more, um...rustic until you're pretty much dealing with the turn of the 20^th century. And the people get more and ignorant. Not bad, by the way, just ignorant. Nongs aren't evil or malicious but they are *incredibly* ignorant. And be prepared to be offended by virtually everything being a poor copy of its Western original.

Lastly, you mention that you're black. Well, in my country that means nothing. In China, dark skin is ""ugly"" and they get a lot of propaganda about how black people are all violent thugs. It doesn't mean that people will treat you poorly or that all people will automatically treat you like dirt but be prepared to encounter more than your fair share of racism of any kind. They're all going to assume you can play basketball like a wizard and have the IQ of a turnip. They don't make much effort to hide blatant racism because it's just not on their radar. They want white faces at their training schools and it doesn't matter that English is your first language. I've had more than one dark-complexioned coworker be confronted with blatant racism of the most ignorant kind.

Don't study there, that's for sure but really, just visit. To get the full and real China experience you need to live here for a while but if you want to leave the place still in love with it (if not more than ever) just visit. There is *absolutely no common courtesy and, most of the time, common sense, either*. Adapting to this place as a resident won't be easy if you choose to live here."

Okay, when you put your money in a bank, the bank takes that money and loans it to people. This is how banks actually make their money. They obviously can't make any money if all they do is hold yours. 

Secondly,...what? No, that's not what anybody has said. Why do you think America (or any country) owes any money to anybody?  Here's a grossly oversimplified explanation: The government wants more money than it's going to get in taxes or has collected already. So, it asks a bank for that money or issues bonds et al to raise revenue. When it gets that money from the bank, it's basically signed you up for a loan whether you wanted it or not. When it gets the money from bonds etc., the people who buy those bonds are owed money. It's an investment on their part because if they wait for the bonds to mature, they'll collect a reasonable profit assuming everything goes to plan. 

Nobody in America held out their hand to the Chinese government and begged for a dime. Anybody can buy those bonds and what-not although usually it's institutions like banks or large corporations etc. This is also how any two countries can simultaneously owe each other billions of dollars (or whatever currency they're using)

Just for ultra-simplicity however, national debt is not synonymous with all the people of any country owing all the people in another country."
clevercomebacks,fezocpz,t3_eqr4x5,1579459637.0,"That doesn't actually make sense (the ""clever comeback"")

First of all, the US doesn't owe China a trillion dollars. Chinese businesses have bought whatever the number is of US debt. That's not the US owing China. They also don't want it all paid back because the interest on that debt is worth far more than the principal. 

Secondly, and more importantly, that's not Chinese tax dollars that have bought those debt bonds, notes, bills, etc. Chinese banks and individuals have bought the debts but they did so as private entities. It also needs to be noted that the overwhelming majority of US debt isn't owed to any foreign nation at all but rather by the US to the US (which isn't quite an accurate description either)"

I'm somebody who went the opposite way (and learned why they wanted to leave their home countries) and I currently live in China. China is *full* of racism. The only difference is that they don't think of their behavior as racist. Sometimes I kind of agree with them in that I was more or less brainwashed to believe that any time I mentioned anything to do with race, I'm somehow being racist. The consensus seems to be that I'm not allowed to discuss it because I'm white. Well, that's just racism to say that so I more or less just threw all of that crap out the window and decided to simply practice common courtesy instead of left-wing politics.

Now, you're talking about America but America isn't the entirety of the Western world. I'm originally from Canada and Canada is similar to America in that it's a country made up of immigrants. Canada is less polarized politically than the US and the overwhelming majority of people in that country are basically left-leaning (even if they don't like to think of themselves that way) I have every right to expect that when I go to a restaurant,apply for a job, deal with any business, pay my rent, take a class, or do anything else that I can think of, it's done in one of Canada's two official languages. I don't care if people want to do their thing in their mother tongue but I see nothing at all wrong with demanding (yes, I'm choosing that word specifically) that if they want to be part of my country, they *do* assimilate. It's what I have to do to get by in China.I don't know of any country that would allow itself to not even have a common language. I wouldn't expect it to be any other way for that matter. It's *my* country for the same reason that people in China call that *their* country. The difference is that the Chinese won't even consider the possibility of letting me become Chinese.

Firstly, I'm pretty sure you're thinking of ""The Force Awakens"" and pretty much every fan of the franchise noticed exactly that point.

Secondly, China most certainly *is not* any kind of hotbed of creativity. Go ahead...name one Chinese product that was truly thought up and developed in China. The Chinese steal absolutely everything not figuratively nailed down when it comes to intellectual property. I don't think you understand how deep this rabbit hole goes.

You don't just go to KFC in China. You have your choice of KFG, KLL, CKC and so on. They all have logos that are clear copies of KFC. They have cars that are identical copies of American autos such that Chevy took the doors off of one to prove it was a copy of their own model and put it on their car in the courtroom. It's absolutely true that there's no creativity in China because it *is* drilled out of them from day one in their education system. They see absolutely nothing wrong with copying  and (by Western standards, cheating) because it was a Confucian principle to copy the masters and then you can develop your own ideas. But that's not how copyright laws work and China doesn't respect them anyway. Don't tell me that China is full of creativity...I live there and I see absolutely no sign of it anywhere. Everything is a poor rip-off of something from some other country. You hear familiar music and think it's from something you enjoy watching or listening to ...nope, just some Chinese TV show ripping off a famous song from the West and using it without permission (naturally) Hell, have you heard Chinese radio? The Chinese Top 40 sounds like 1970s easy listening hell with not an ounce of soul, creativity or even a change of tone. It's all like listening to The Carpenters on an endless loop. It's an embarrassment to the art of making music. 

There's natural cultural diffusion. It's going to become more common as the world continues to improve interconnectedness. I'm looking forward to the day there's an Arab restaurant food chain as I absolutely love their food. But don't claim that China is producing much of anything in the creativity department. People will enjoy the food (doesn't do anything for me as I find the regional food to all be the same) and ancient culture but when it comes to innovation, there's nothing coming out of China that anybody anywhere has any interest in. If you can name even one Chinese pop-band, TV show or movie (not from Hong Kong because that's a different kettle of fish) that you can say is some sort of global phenomenon and has mass appeal then sure, I'll listen but right now there's absolutely nothing and no prospect of that changing.

As for whatever you're going on about with the world wanting Japan's gold...what are you talking about? I honestly have no clue what you're talking about and if you think everybody loves Japanese food, well, if you say so.
Concerning K-Pop...well, 12 year old girls like other 12 year old girls and since that's what most of the K-Pop ""stars"" look like, it makes sense because it's clearly not about the music. But that's just my subjective opinion of K-pop. I don't know anybody who could name a K-Pop song, band, or artist except for maybe that Psy dude but whatever...Korea still has a lot more potential in the creativity department than China does. Japan makes some of the best TV in the world (IMO...have you see their game shows? Absolutely hilarious!) and both it and S. Korea are coming out with some pretty good movies as well.
Seriously, learn what you're talking about before commenting on the creativity coming out of China."

worldnews,fe6lzi6,t1_fe2gr84,1578895415.0,"They most definitely did make the economy worse. 

You can spend just an hour in the Chinese countryside to see that most people there live in conditions last seen in the West 100 years ago. The only meaningful statements about the Chinese economy have to be made with respect to the fact that other things changed over time as well. 

To properly understand this, let's assume that the average Chinese earned about 100 dollars a month in 1950 (this is to illustrate a point, please don't argue about the accuracy of the numbers) 

Now, let's say that that person had 3 more children between 1950 and 1960. Now let's also say that this person earns 300 dollars in 1960. But 300 1960 dollars only buys what 50 1950 dollars would buy. So this person makes 3 times as much as he did ten years earlier but can only buy half as much. 

Now, let's factor in some other things: This guy has had a 300 percent increase in his expenses. The problem here is that it doesn't mean he can get a better job. His national government has isolated China (you can't say that China couldn't have learned from other countries during this time period. They simply chose to rely on one other country and it turned out to be another economic moron) and kept it from technological progress in the name of nationalism and ideology. Not to mention that even if he could have got a better education and job, there was no industry position for him anyway as he was more or less assigned a job. Due to ideological reasons, the ruling government wouldn't have wanted him to want much more than he already had. And really, what for anyway? He'd have still had more or less the same pay and rations as everybody else after everything was still said and done. 

The party kept China back for 30 years. That's exactly what happened...why deny it? Life certainly didn't get better for anybody during that time period. Who else to blame but the CPC? The Great Leap Forward was literally the government telling the people to destroy their only means of supporting themselves economically."
worldnews,fe6l2h8,t1_fe1p8z9,1578894463.0,GDP growth doesn't actually mean China grew economically over that period. More people to feed and less money per person coupled with inflation doesn't signify actual economic growth.

The truth is that China was in decline for decades prior to abandoning the dynasty system and corruption was no stranger to China in the first place. What the Japanese did was rightfully called plunder but, ironically, they *did* actually leave China in a better state to profit in the future had China taken proper advantage of it. 

When the CPC took over, they, like virtually half the world at the time, started from something of a blank slate. Mao just had stupid and ignorant views of economics that he coupled with idealism to keep China from ever advancing in any meaningful way. His view for his entire life was that economics was something best left ignored and he never made the connection between making money for a country and its power on the world stage. Not to mention that he hunted down virtually everybody capable of actually doing something meaningful to change the situation in China.

So, really, you're asking people to thank the CPC for keeping China a backward, ignorant nation for decades and then waking up and having a change of heart. Does not compute."
worldnews,fe6kbrh,t1_fe04em0,1578893721.0,"That's really not true. The truth is that due to years of brainwashing, people in China view themselves exclusively as Chinese citizens in China. This is pretty much the norm the world over and nobody actually has a problem with it as it is. However, the CCP also teaches the Chinese people that the Communist Party of China *is* China. Because of that, insulting the CPC is an insult to the Chinese sense of national identity. That's why you get stories about Chinese tourists vandalizing anti-CPC propaganda and messages in foreign countries where they have no business even being in if they don't like the way things are done there. But the national sense of ties to the country are very strong. The vast majority of Chinese people don't have any problem at all with being a part of China and really, why should they? What *we* have a problem with is the way the CPC runs the place. You have to remember that they don't know any other system and as such have no point of reference anyway. To them, this is just the way things are done and an idea like declaring their region independent from China is a non-starter. This ignorance keeps the Chinese people from knowing how much better things could be and are in other places. They don't know what the party does when it's negative and bad for their own personal interests, they only know what they see and what they see gives them no reason to question the government. They, like everybody everywhere, complain about the government but on a more personal basis than the idea than believing the entire government is a piece of shit. Remember: No frame of reference."

As such, in the case of an insurance scam, the assessors show up half an hour later and by then all they can see is somebody sitting on the ground under a car. They don't care who says anything because they go by what they see. I'm not sure how it works when it's on camera but I doubt there's any penalties for making the attempt to defraud people or insurance companies. In fact, even if there are penalties, I doubt anybody will do anything to enforce them because the Chinese culture of today has something called ""chabuduo"" culture. Chabuduo just means something like ""meh...good enough."" It's basically just lazy thinking and the way the courts will view it in China is as ""Meh...no damage done. Don't do it again.""
