You have to understand that I was around at the time the album came out. I remember the music scene of the time. I also see the current scene of bands like king gizzard and Tame Impala being more popular than ever.

I think these people feel like they need to intellectually justify certain pop music as different from other pop music, and more intellectually valid, and I think that's exactly what this writer does. They're not hiding that they like pop, they're rationalizing that they like pop. Which is silly, because it's not something that needs defending.

And it doesn't address anything specific to Pinkerton that isn't true of any other case where a band tweaks their sound on a new album.

His first conviction didn't cause the social fall from grace we'd like to think it would have. So that's out.

Multiple people had every reason to kill him. So there's that point made moot."
skeptic,fdef0dc,t1_fde71ld,1578337590.0,"I hate this quote because it relies on a false dichotomy. You can believe that wealthy and powerful people are constantly protected and accommodated by corrupt fellows without believing it's all part of some clandestine order.

We have more examples than anybody could need, from throughout history, of people acting unethically and exploitatively when they feel invincible because of their position. And the lengths they go to protect that position.

What's especially wild to me is that people readily accept the facts that he used his private island to abuse girls, that he literally jetted around with very powerful people who often stayed on his properties, and that Ghislaine Maxwell was his partner in acquiring girls and keeping them, but it's just too far beyond the pale to believe that any of their very close friends would kill him to keep him quiet.

indieheads,fdb9dff,t3_ekfvzi,1578255100.0,"It's true that it's impossible to play most major American cities without the money going to LN or AEG once you hit 1000+ caps. It's also true that responsibility here is really on the patron. It's their money that goes to the billionaire. The band is the one taking money from them. So the question then becomes, are Mannequin Pussy's fans gonna go to Coachella because they're playing? If so, then they're not people who are bothered by the ownership anyway, so they're moot. If not, then the band isn't responsible for making ownership any money. So it seems kinda pointless to be upset with them.

How about people focus on the big draws like Frank Ocean?"
skeptic,fdb6cuy,t3_ekefrz,1578254330.0,"I believe it's because people are scared.

You have to understand that I was around at the time the album came out. I remember the music scene of the time. I also see the current scene of bands like king gizzard and Tame Impala being more popular than ever.

I think these people feel like they need to intellectually justify certain pop music as different from other pop music, and more intellectually valid, and I think that's exactly what this writer does. They're not hiding that they like pop, they're rationalizing that they like pop. Which is silly, because it's not something that needs defending.

His first conviction didn't cause the social fall from grace we'd like to think it would have. So that's out.

Multiple people had every reason to kill him. So there's that point made moot."

We have more examples than anybody could need, from throughout history, of people acting unethically and exploitatively when they feel invincible because of their position. And the lengths they go to protect that position.

What's especially wild to me is that people readily accept the facts that he used his private island to abuse girls, that he literally jetted around with very powerful people who often stayed on his properties, and that Ghislaine Maxwell was his partner in acquiring girls and keeping them, but it's just too far beyond the pale to believe that any of their very close friends would kill him to keep him quiet.

So the question then becomes, are Mannequin Pussy's fans gonna go to Coachella because they're playing? If so, then they're not people who are bothered by the ownership anyway, so they're moot. If not, then the band isn't responsible for making ownership any money. So it seems kinda pointless to be upset with them.
