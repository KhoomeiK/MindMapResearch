Nobody actually wants to do Oil & Gas dirty. It's like killing the Golden Goose. In order for your story to be plausible, you have to make-believe that the Liberals don't understand that 25% of our economy is O&G related.

Your talk of infrastructure further illustrates your illiteracy on the subject matter. ""Build more refineries!"" They say, completely unaware that our lack of refineries (some of which we willingly closed in the early 2000's) isn't going to make oil prices higher.

canada,feyfm3p,t1_feybtul,1579444850.0,"I am an Albertan that works in oil and gas, and you...you are missing the point.

Nobody in Canada is preventing you from working. No one in Canada is preventing oil and gas work. These are conditions predicated by a market on a sharp decline. 

Will there be oil and gas work in the future? Yes. It will probably be an industry for another 50 years. Will it rise to the place it once was? Maybe. But probably not. There would have to be a major catastrophe in the Middle East. Or Canada and the US would have to *choose* to use Canadian oil over our cheaper competitors overseas for some unforeseen reason.

Trudeau isn't stopping oil and gas. His rhetoric isn't *starting up* new jobs, but his mandate isn't to push for oil and gas. Never was. He is leaning towards renewable energy as a future. And he bloody well *should* be. It's where we are headed. 

There's enough **real** reasons to not like Trudeau. We don't have to pretend he (or anyone else on the Liberal spectrum) is preventing us from working. 

Environmental groups have been a part of Canadian politics for as long as oil and gas has been around. They aren't changing what is happening worldwide. They might be louder today, but we drive more cars than ever before in human history. So, consumption isn't the problem. The fact is this: There is much cheaper oil out there, and our oil costs a lot more to procure. There was a time when there was still plenty of money to be made despite the high cost of production. That is not the time we are living in right now."
