I sort of get the impression that dude just expects mom's family to chauffeur him around for his errands, no charge. 
This time they've asked him for gas money, and well, just how dare they!!"
niceguys,ffjqdpp,t1_ffignq3,1580004277.0,I wonder if he likes fish sticks
niceguys,ffhp2y7,t1_ffhehgg,1579946334.0,"Or, is he fucking a helicopter?"
niceguys,ffhoyrn,t1_ffhlvwa,1579946153.0,"For a gentleman, he sure said the Fuck word a lot!
I mean, that's my favorite word, but even I was like damn sir, relax."
pettyrevenge,ffhjcwo,t1_fdpqhrp,1579937899.0,That was the part that really pissed me off...that she waited until dude had 15 minutes left in his shift to ask.
niceguys,ffhf41w,t1_ffgzoeq,1579932614.0,"*starts dry humping you*


~squirts directly in face w squirt bottle~

niceguys,ffhejq3,t3_etfoap,1579931993.0,"Let's see... 
2 ""you're beautifuls""+ 2 ""I'm a gEntLeMaN""+ 3 ""I'm aLWaYs rEspCtFuL"". Add 1 ""I'm polite"" thrown in for good measure-- that's the magic combo that will have those panties hitting the floor any minute now. Oh, let me casually mention I'm at chemo, perhaps the added pity will make that bra fall off too.  /s

OMG. What a slimeball!! Dude, if you feel the need to state that you're respectful or a gentleman, chances are that you're not."
niceguys,ffh7106,t1_ffh1m68,1579924898.0,But...what about gluten?
niceguys,ffh6lqj,t1_fffjv8v,1579924549.0,"Oh, he definitely went down in flames there!"
niceguys,ffeqafz,t3_et5p6x,1579860142.0,Smoldering sense of humor... That's what he thinks he has.
niceguys,ffeq8sx,t1_ffemkvk,1579860074.0,He spoiled that milk though
niceguys,ffepvs3,t1_ffepqyb,1579859521.0,"Maybe an advance copy of that script would help her to know her role. 

I hope she Maced him when she answered the door, then pressed charges. Although he reads like she may need to go into witness protection, or to Mars."
niceguys,ffepp3p,t1_ffephfg,1579859235.0,"I like how he says she will act out of place... Dude, you're hiding in her yard!! You're the one out of place.

Also, that's an awkward phrasing that he used. Unless that is his way of saying that she deviates from his mental script."
niceguys,ffdhgsm,t1_ffdh2ee,1579820953.0,That was my first thought too
niceguys,ffd6e9f,t1_ffd6579,1579814311.0,"Hey, if they are going out windows, might as well yeet them out"
niceguys,ffd5pfs,t3_esz2ak,1579813926.0,"Lmao tell him if its atirniff then he doesnt have to wear it.  But you like it and will continue to wear it.

Your solution was faster really. Imma have to remember to yeet people out of windows"
niceguys,ffd5fzn,t3_esz3pf,1579813782.0,He probably thinks that we can hold our periods in too.
