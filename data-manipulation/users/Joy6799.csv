unpopularopinion,ff20nsz,t3_er1syq,1579490662.0,"I'm kinda on both sides of this argument. I have a daughter and I would absolutely save her over any of the pets I have, and same goes for my husband.

Same goes for human babies and children, overall they're pretty innocent and I personally value their lives more highly."
