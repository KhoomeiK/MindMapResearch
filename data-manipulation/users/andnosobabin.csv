HerbGrow,fgsyapv,t1_fgswxhp,1581095169.0,Love that website my hydro is a custom rdwc.  Tbh I've got a few hydro and soil grows under my belt. The lst to scrog is where I get intimidated. I've always topped and mainlined my plants.
HerbGrow,fgsvd43,t1_fgsuiqw,1581093433.0,You've done an amazing job I'll definitely reference it my next grow here in about a month. You're doing a great job!

NoTillGrowery,fgs9069,t3_f01qqb,1581076956.0,"Either over watered or you killed off your roots in transplant. Did you transplant straight into the BAS 3.0 or use their seedling soil as a transplant ""filler""

Not sure the terminology but when I transplant or even plant seeds I use BAS or any low nitrogen soil to fill in a solo cup sized ""core"" in big pot to transplant into."

onions,fgqpmdg,t1_fgqofwf,1581028833.0,"Makes sense,  but does OP's intention really matter? 

The tor project has always supposedly been about freedom from censorship and oppression and lately it feels like it's just another ""clearnet"" group with a special login process.  

Not meaning to rant sorry."

NoTillGrowery,fgisyxa,t1_fgis56s,1580830230.0,"I've read that too. Apparently the forest next to my house (where my compost pile is) is full of them only my garden has ""normal"" worms. I've had no issues so far. They seem to aerate the soil very well and only my assumption but the pellet like castings they leave should still have the same if not more nutrients in it (albeit harder to break down) but with all the extra care we give our grow environments I feel it's safe to assume the biome will adjust and life will continue on. 

That's just my experience so far if in a few more grows it bites my ass, well I guess I start over lol."

NextCloud,fgiowdp,t1_fgiop58,1580827528.0,I'm not sure but I think that's the 1st part. Enabling SSL but that doesnt enable and create a certificate. I installed using snapd so my install process was completely different than yours.
