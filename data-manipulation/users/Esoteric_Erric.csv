nottheonion,fffe98l,t1_fff6rs8,1579882049.0,"Thank you. As I mentioned, there is clearly a reflex from those uneducated in their understanding of what socialism is. I think this is partly from propaganda and partly just an *unawareness* (I didn't want to use the word 'ignorance') of, well, what socialism means in practice. 
Socialism is about caring for the poor, creating a society in which the police don't taze, kill, jail and frame the people. In a socialist society there is an effort to make healthcare affordable, and stop people like Trump colluding with pharma so that they can charge tens of thousands of dollars for a jar of pills that someone needs to keep their kid alive - about fairness. Socialism is about the government working for the people, NOT using their position in the government as their own device for their own personal gain. 'Working for the people' means spending THE PEOPLE'S TAX MONEY on things for the people themselves, like education, health care, welfare, homelessness, social assistance and more. You would never have a president spending $120,000,000.00 million dollars on playing golf. Think about the brazen attitude of a billionaire president who will tax blue collar Americans and openly spend it in such a frivolous manner - it is ridiculous. The only thing more ridiculous is that the very people he is screwing defend him. It is like a thief coming into your house, getting caught, then you go to court and defend him, and give him a hug.
Anyway, nothing will change. The Republicans will ignore the evidence, and they will ignore their oath of office, and they will leave him in. And Russia will manipulate the vote, as well as a very clever and aggressive facebook campaign by the Republicans - and democracy, in the United Staes, is over. dead. Finished. RIP the constitution, because you now have a party with not just one or two people willing to shit on it - you have a collaboration of many."
