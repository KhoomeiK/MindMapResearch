intj,fdrhyxg,t1_fdrc1bi,1578684735.0,I believe the same thing. It wastes unnecessary energy and time. Especially when confronting an idiot.

WatchPeopleDieInside,fddsovv,t3_ekjoag,1578322982.0,"It's soo annoying. I was once traveling on bus once and the person in front of me started to incline his seat way more to make me uncomfortable. When I politely asked him to be better, he started to fight with me. I mad that guy pull his seat up. After an hour or so, he started to hit me repeatedly with making his chair inclined. I was very sad on that day and switched seats to stop unnecessary conflicts."

VioletEvergarden,fcpreo1,t1_fcpb276,1577870505.0,It will be expensive. The quality of the drawings are god tier. I am trying to draw Violet but it's a little hard even to finish the sketch perfectly. No wonder Kyoani was one of the greatest animators.
