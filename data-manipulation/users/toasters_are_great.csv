Its $2.9T is a part of the national debt, owed to Social Security by the Federal government; if Social Security were to be 'reformed' (i.e. cut in whole in or in part) so as to never have to liquidate that then that is money that literally would never have to be paid back.  Then via GOP sock puppets that freed-up borrowing power can be used for wars, tax cuts for billionaires etc.

Trump is merely the next useful idiot."
