Overwatch,feaoxap,t1_feads8i,1578950916.0,"The hanzos and widows you see are more than likely smurfs.  They're  a plague that ruins the game, i agree.

I WISH the widows i play with would flex, because so rarely do they have an impact.  My actual main is hanzo, and i almost never pick him out the gate - i use him to counter orisa and widow only.  Mei is a huge problem right now but she's getting nerfs in the next update - not sure how thats going to go, i dont play pc to be in the ptr.

But the bottom line is, every player needs to be capable of flexing, especially to play the counters to your main's counters.  Not just you, everyone.  I know there's a lot of people playing the same character the entire match, that's why they lose.  Dont be them."

Overwatch,fe9iyxh,t1_fe9ed60,1578937916.0,"Because the meta of role lock entirely revolves around counter picks.  For example, say I'm an enemy dps and you are dominating as junkrat early on.  I see you on fire, so i switch to pharah and focus you to negate the overwhelming impact you were having.  Your teammate switches to hitscan to counter me.  Being now useless, i switch to sombra because she's my main and i can cause shenanigans.  Since you still haven't flexed i know to watch for your traps and in still going to target you when i have the opportunity.

There are no hero players like in CoD.  Rarely is someone going to successfully carry to the W.  This is a team game and a strategy game.  If you aren't going to play it as such, you're gonna have a bad time."
