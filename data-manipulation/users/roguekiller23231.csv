They say that you are unfit for work, but you can do 'some work'. So if you are able to do somethings, they will want you to work.

Some benefits do allow you to work for a certain number of hours a week, even if you are unfit for work. 

The problem is you shouldn't have to go down the route of Mandatory reconsideration and appeals if you are unfit for work and likely to win an appeal. Why put people who are unfit for work through all of that!? 

And just FYI, if you had a 'nice' assessor, your mistaken, they where only 'nice' so you would display things that they can use to say you shouldn't be on that benefit and should be in work."

This wouldn't have happened a few years ago, if you where unfit for work, the criteria and points system that was in place for people who are unfit to work would have been made unfit to work.

Now, even if you are unfit to work but can still do something, even if your health is at risk, you are made fit to do some types of work. 

The job centre really don't care, even though it's their job to find a job that will fit around your health problems, they are not trained to deal with this and really don't give a shit about your health problems, they just want you out of the system and into work.

familyguythegame,fejk7rh,t3_ephmc6,1579177640.0,"Really depends on if you have the time to play and do things on time to make the most you can. But everything is costing more because they are giving away so many clams in various ways and want you to spend them and then have to buy if you want to complete everything.

The past events for at least a year have been close to impossible to complete or unlock all the characters in the event without using clams.

But the last 5 or 6 events seem to have eased off on the difficulty to unlock characters, I've managed to unlock all the main characters in an event, barring 1 that I had to use clams to unlock near the end because the drop rate was terrible. 

But there isn't any point for a few reasons that I can see for you to spend any money now. (disregarding the pointlessness of the constant events and useless characters after that you totally forget once a new event starts)

You can get plenty of clams through ads and when you unlock 4 in a row in the Historical Society you get clams, Completing a set of characters also gets you clams (although I think this is a left over forgotten relic that has been forgotten, but you can still get clams from it) which is at the bottom, 'citizen collection' and  that thing you can do every 24 hours, where you select 3 characters and it sometimes drops a clam."

Hovering over the dog, over it's head, bearing over it, this is a very threatening thing to do to a dog, your dominating the dog and the dog can react with a bite.

Smiling, your happy but the dog sees a new person bearing it's teeth at them. 

The 'shhhh shhhh' to quiet a dog, I hear this a lot on rescue video's, your hissing at the dog, most animals use that as a threat, warning that they are not comfortable with you near them so hissing to warn you off. Doing this when rescuing an already scared animal and trying to catch it is a really bad idea."
