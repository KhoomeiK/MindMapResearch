I’m not so sure of that. A friend of mine’s wife cheated on him. He owns his own company she sits on the couch and watches TV. They have 7 kids together and he provides everything and she is supposed to home school. She didn’t. Her own kids called child services on her because she just lied. My friend had no idea how far his youngest had fallen behind. He thought he had a good thing until his kids finally came clean on her lies. When you love someone and it’s suppose to go both ways you assume they are telling the truth. Now I understand all his betrayal posts on Facebook. When you have been betrayed by the one you love most of all and didn’t see it coming because you thought things are good this display isn’t hard to imagine."
