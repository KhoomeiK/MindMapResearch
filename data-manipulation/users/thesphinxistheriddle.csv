loseit,ffqoqv5,t3_eul24j,1580140093.0,"This week is going to be a difficult one at work. I’ve been assigned to work on a project with a co-worker who is very senior to me who doesn’t so much treat me as dirt as just ignore me entirely. Basically staring down eight hours a day for the next week of sitting in a room with him while he dictates to an assistant, and every time I suggest anything he simply ignores me and keeps dictating. (“Am I a ghost?” I asked the assistant on Friday, but she confirmed she could see me) So.....that’s cool.

Wednesday is traditionally the day when my partner and I do our own thing — mostly he goes to the movies and I curl up with a book. I wanted to do something to pamper myself on Wednesday given my difficult week, but couldn’t think of anything other than drowning my sorrows in a butt ton of takeout and trashy reality tv.

And then when I was on a walk yesterday....it hit me! A non-food related reward....I booked an hour at a cat cafe! I am very excited about hanging out with some kitties and still remaining under my calorie goal. A stress reducing win."

wedding,ff9bkru,t1_ff8xkwz,1579709230.0,"If you want to live on the US, at least for now, I recommend doing the adjustment of status even if they don’t want to become a citizen. Adjustment of status won’t get them citizenship automatically — it gets them a green card (aka a “permanent resident”), which I believe can be renewed indefinitely even if they never apply for citizenship. The green card can be renounced fairly easily if you two decide to leave the states permanently. I don’t recommend just counting on their work to allow them to stay — the H1B can take years to get, even with a company that wants to sponsor them, and then you’re really beholden to that company and their ups and downs. My partner’s company just had a big merger with another company, and it definitely causes us a little anxiety about what would happen if he gets laid off for being redundant between now and our wedding.

As for the dual intent stuff, it doesn’t matter right now (just tell them maybe to not volunteer anything about having an American fiancé at customs if they go through between now and your wedding) and won’t hurt your chances when you apply for a green card, but could be a very, very big problem if your partner tries to leave and renter the US after you’re married. Being flexible is great! But returning home from what’s supposed to just be a short trip to find out your partner can’t come into the US and you have to go home alone and pack up all your stuff by yourself and decide what your next step is over the phone — sounds pretty miserable to me. Which is why I really suggest adjusting status to a green card — not really any downsides to it as far as I can see.

But again, really urge you to talk to an immigration lawyer. I’m not one, just an internet stranger going through something similar!"

I had a friend who was also online dating that posted very misleading photos, and she'd come to me upset about the expression on their face the moment they saw her in person, and I always felt like she didn't have to subject herself to that.

wedding,ff4cx09,t1_ff4caxs,1579560652.0,"Okay, follow up. If your partner is here on an F1 student visa, that is what’s called a non-immigrant visa. It means they cannot have any “intent” to become a permanent US citizen. Having a US citizen spouse is definitely an intent and you will run into trouble if you try to leave the country after getting married but before the green card is approved — Border Patrol night deny them reentry into the US on the basis of them violating their F1 visa. If the F1 visa is what your partner is on, I would REALLY recommend getting at least an appointment with a immigration lawyer to make sure you aren’t doing any of this wrong — it’s not cheap but a misstep could literally cost you your ability to live together in the United States.

(my partner is here on a H1B visa, which does allow intent, so we are in a different situation, but even still we will be employing an immigration lawyer)"
wedding,ff4caxs,t3_erfdok,1579560246.0,"I am also an American engaged to a Canadian. Is your partner in the US on a visa (i.e., work or student) already? In that case, what you do is get married and then afterwards apply for what’s called an “adjustment of status,” which basically means they are switching from their former visa to a green card on the basis of being a family member (spouse) of an American citizen. Please let me know if you have any questions — I’m not an expert but I have done a lot of googling."

The crew usually have some level of experience, even if they’re not full-time professionals, but the “executive producers” are just people who give money to the project and come to set and lie around and get in the way and cause confusion.

It’s about the end of the Roman Republic from the early career of Gaius Marius to his great-great-nephew Augustus being declared “consul for life.” It’s not fantasy (though the characters certainly believe in magic and occasionally perform rituals or listen to soothsayers), but it is very long and very epic, with lots of world building, factions, political intrigue, full scale battles.
