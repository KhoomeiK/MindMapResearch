CEO pay is as much as pissing contest between boardrooms as anything else. There are absolutely people who can do the job for a half a million as there are who want 20 million. The idea there isn't is bs. The same things that applied to Billy Bean in Moneyball would to CEOs. The difference between a celebrity CEO of a huge company and a smaller but successful company doesn't all justify the price. But guess what? Boardrooms set their own salaries and they and executives usually own most the shares with which to vote.
