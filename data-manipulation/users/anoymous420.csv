morbidquestions,fefsjlb,t1_fefs9un,1579063907.0,"again, bold of you to assume this is the only thing i’m upset about, and it’s not the worst thing in my life. okay yeah i know, i’ve been in therapy for years, what’s your point here. someone’s parent died today which is much worse than my eye but i still get to be upset. stop fucking belittling my feelings. whether or not you think it’s “normal” i’m still gonna bitch about it."

BodyDysmorphia,fdtudez,t3_emrvie,1578722349.0,"i’ve never related to anything more in my life. you put it into words. i found out about body dysmorphic disorder just last week and even tho i don’t believe in self diagnosis, that’s what’s wrong with me. it’s ruining my life. i know these are small things but obviously most girls take selfies relatively frequently - i rarely do. unless i’m all dolled up for something and manage to get 1 good pic out of the 200 i took. in snaps, if i send a selfie, it’s of like a 1/3 of my face. literally not even half. my nose is the worst. it’s massive. i’ve become ~obsessed~ with my face symmetry. well, asymmetry. it makes me want to die too. i’ve been extremely and kind of actively suicidal the past few months. definitely not all because of my appearance, but it’s still such a heavy burden. it’s fucking exhausting to constantly think about the angle at which someone is looking at you because you don’t want anyone seeing your side profile because of your massive, ugly, crooked nose. i can’t live in this body."

cats,fdpu98j,t1_fdp4lkl,1578640716.0,are you sure? my house (the place she’s grown up in since she was 3 months old) is fairly big considering there’s only 3 people in my family and now only 2 people n the house since i’m in college. you don’t think this small space will negatively affect her?

cats,fdp41lz,t1_fdoyzm5,1578619495.0,"i’m a freshman in college so i left my 2 cats a few months ago. they’re sisters so usually id never want to separate them but one of them is mean to the other. the one i want to bring is the one who doesn’t fight bc she’s a little lazy so i don’t think the small space would be as big of a deal for her. i could never bring the other one bc she’s so active and she needs her space. to bring her into a room this small would be to abuse her, so i can’t do that. if i bring her i will most definitely get a cat tree."
