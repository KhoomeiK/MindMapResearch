depression,fcavimk,t3_egu5vq,1577577435.0,"Good on you to use your weaknesses as your strength. If you have nothing, then you have nothing to lose, so you might as well try new things."
depression,fcavaum,t3_egstsp,1577577315.0,"I find comfort in playing online games with internet strangers, because for the 30 minutes that we're stuck together on the same team, at least we're together."
depression,fcauo3n,t3_egoo0y,1577576959.0,"A lot of people didn't think they'd find someone who will love them, but somehow did, therefore they are advising others to not give up out of experience. In that sense, they might be genuine in saying that there's someone for everyone because they might have been in the same hopeless state that many of us are. Afterall, if it worked for them, why can't it work for us?   
Except, sometimes it just doesn't work for us.   
Everyone's experience is different, some people get lucky, others snap out of depression and through sheer effort and will, manage to make themselves more attractive. Sometimes the stars align and the people meet at the right time at the right place. Some people have good friends and made some introductions.   
Whatever the case, others, like myself, just don't have those conditions. So for people like us, it feels like ""love is out there for everyone"" is just a sham, because we've either given up or are close to giving up. Essentially, we've seen no results in ourselves, and all we have are other people's facebook posts or reddit success stories. It's pointless.   
But who knows, maybe some of us will find love in the future. It's hard to tell."
depression,fcau51l,t3_egvvu6,1577576663.0,"I've accepted that I'm not good. If I keep feeling like I'm not worth anyone's time, then maybe it's true that I'm not worth anyone's time. It's self-fulfilling prophecy.  
I remember in highschool, I dreaded becoming a shut-in, no social life, video gamer. Now it's become my reality."
depression,fcatvgc,t1_fc9ahr2,1577576510.0,Never been touched since highschool and going strong!
depression,fcatp84,t3_egqg5d,1577576411.0,"Being successful is my last method of getting a relationship since I have nothing to show except for, potentially, money. Yes, I'm going to resort to buying fake love instead of seeking genuine love, because nothing fucking works and I feel worse and even more lonely than before."
ForeverAlone,fcatgnj,t1_fcatcaq,1577576283.0,"Some people win the lottery, others win a different type of lottery. There are winners and there are losers. Someone has to be the loser so that others can be the winners."
ForeverAlone,fcat5i0,t1_fcar3d3,1577576103.0,"Speaking with no personal experience, confessions do sound a bit cringey. Since I don't have opportunities (no friends lol), I can't take that route.    
It feels like most of the opportunities are gated by the number of friends, and since I have 0, well there's nothing I can do. I can't just make friends on the fly, I don't have that personality.   
This isn't a complaint, I'm just really down that there's no magic potion (alcohol doesn't count) or a fast way to just get out of FA. I've been stuck, and will likely be stuck, whilst dreaming away."
ForeverAlone,fcas7ip,t3_egwi34,1577575586.0,"I wouldn't know, I haven't gone to a socializing event since middle of highschool.   
Man I thought I was cool being a loner. Now I regret 100% being a loner, I didn't get to learn how to socialize and be normal."
ForeverAlone,fcart0j,t3_egpcmu,1577575366.0,"I'm good at League of Legends. I'd say 2-3 years ago, I was ranked top 80% of all ranked players in North America. Out of 10 million of players, I was top 2,000,000, which might not sound impressive but I've never been top 80% in anything else. I met people ranked below me and I felt like a god to them, even though we were much closer in skill. Back then, I put my entire emphasis and self-worth on League of Legends, because I finally found something I was good at.     
The sad part is that I'm no longer as good (more players, more competition, less time), and I still reminisce the times when I was top 80%. It's pathetic, but it's all that I have to show.     
Also, top 80% isn't actually THAT good, it's just means you're not as bad as the average player. /r/leagueoflegends likes to meme that anyone below diamond is basically bad."
ForeverAlone,fcargz0,t3_egxj8s,1577575174.0,"I think personality matters. However, I have no looks and a shitty personality so I can't judge, but say you're not the best looking but you have an attractive personality. Well the first women you meet might want to be friends, then it's a domino effect where you meet more people because of your attractive personality and grow your social circle through meeting new people. None of the people you meet at first may want to spend a romantic night with you, but the more people you meet, the greater are your chances.      
Looks are important for first impressions, and until you meet someone who doesn't put that much emphasis on looks, you'll be forever searching.   
That being said, if you have a boring personality AND no looks (me), well it definitely feels like nothing matters."
ForeverAlone,fcaqw2z,t3_egs772,1577574814.0,"I kind of agree with the ""don't ask girls at work"" advice since work is work and it's serious business. Once you get tinder, or IF you get tinder, be careful of scammers, bots, and people that are just seeking attention. They might lead you on, get you to pay for food while having no intention of a relationship."
ForeverAlone,fcaqe2z,t1_fcaga0v,1577574517.0,"So how do they do it? Like, I literally don't know. Do they just all use Tinder or get introduced?"
ForeverAlone,fcaq0xu,t1_fcapqpa,1577574298.0,"Not like I have much else to do at the moment. I'm sure people have it worse than me and I'm in no way trying to gate keep anyone. Being short is short, there's no easy way around it."
ForeverAlone,fcaps2n,t1_fcaf0d7,1577574147.0,"It's still possible to escape FA. For some, they just need a little push. For others, the stars need to align or they have REALLY good friends.   
It's not just luck, or effort, it's a combination of both. Depending on the person, they might need a little of one, a little of both, a lot of one, or a lot of both to escape FA."
ForeverAlone,fcap88e,t1_fcafir5,1577573817.0,"It is true. I'm 5'0-5'1 and people treat me differently. However, its the combination that makes it hopeless. Being short is one thing, but being ugly repels people. And when you're short and ugly, well, there's not much to do.   
Even with exercise, sometimes there's just nothing we can do. I for one stopped growing, and I've tried getting rid of my numerous pimples with heavy cream, but nothing works."
ForeverAlone,fcao31b,t3_egph5f,1577573117.0,"I wasted my university life playing games instead of getting out my comfort zone. I feel like university is the last place where its seen as ""acceptable"" to be awkward since people are still discovering themselves."
