I bought them all under $2K originally, so current prices are a bit high for me to buy 21 again.  Plus i didn't sell everything, still have a few."

For example, Tesla's ratio of Revenue to Market cap for last 12 months is 0.33 vs Ford at 4.27, GM at 2.78 or FCA at 3.73.  This means that Tesla brings in 10x less revenue compared to their industry ""peers"" per value of stock.  Peers in quotes because we all know how different Tesla is compared to a traditional automaker.

So people are clearly betting on the future of Tesla (which makes sense) and now its totally a question of how much that is worth, which is super hard to determine without doing some future cash flow analysis where you need to make quite a few assumptions and predictions.
