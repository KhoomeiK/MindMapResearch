It’s that people of vastly different sizes can’t reasonably compete against each other in sports where being bigger is a massive advantage. Consider the famous (or not) case of Billie Jean Riggs, who beat Bobby Riggs, the former number one player, in tennis, a sport where being bigger and beefier isn’t necessarily an advantage. The reason there are two leagues is simply because incredibly athletic women don’t get big and beefy and it would be about as fair pitting men and women against each other as a mastiff against a teacup dog."
unpopularopinion,fg26nm5,t1_fg00zwg,1580439527.0,"I really didn’t word this clearly: nicotine is NOT a gateway drug and DOES NOT have any effect on your heroin use.

However, you are wrong about the dangers of nicotine. It is much worse than coffee. The way nicotine works is it releases a lot of “happy chemicals” in your brain, so that if you keep using it, your brain adapts to be less responsive to those chemicals, because it knows you shouldn’t be only happy all the time. This means you have to keep using more nicotine over time to feel the way you used to, and if you try to quit, your brain thinks you’re not making enough happy juice and you start feeling worse. Quitting nicotine often leads to depression, which leads to wanting the high, which leads to smoking or vaping again. Nicotine is incredibly addictive, incredibly hard to quit, and incredibly dangerous for developing kids and their ability to be happy if and when they quit.

Also, cigarettes contain a lot of nasty stuff, like tar, nickel, and formaldehyde, to name a few. Tar is the cause of those black lungs you see when people are long term smokers. Vaping hasn’t been around for long enough to see those effects, but there have been early cases of vaping killing people.

Either way, yes, it is that dangerous, and even if it’s not a widespread epidemic, any kids hopelessly addicted to a drug they could get arrested for smoking deserve whatever help we can give them."

I think it’s fine for someone talking to someone else online to discuss height in order to establish that their partner isn’t turned off by it, but I in no way appreciate the idea that people come in statistical ideals.”

To quote myself, I don’t think men should be judged about their height or asked shallow questions about it, BUT, as is painfully clear in the media, society judges women’s weight very harshly, more so than it judges men’s height. As I go on to say, and say again, because you keep insisting I hate men or something, people should not be judged against the ideal set of measurements. I haven’t said anything like “it’s only rude of him to ask her weight”. I’ve said “how tall are you” is, while shallow, a fairly standard question that could be asked for more than shallow reasons, and I’ve said “how heavy are you”, emphasis on “heavy”, has a negative connotation implying a person is overweight or you perceive them to be. In case you haven’t picked it up already, MEASUREMENTS MAKETH NOTHING. It’s rude to ask for any variety of measurements, though if someone wants to offer their own to make sure they don’t commit to someone shallow who’ll ghost them later, that’s their own decision.

On another note, your username is astoundingly accurate. The longer you drag this on, using the same lazy several words, growing less and less articulate, resorting to more and more insults, the more foolish your argument sounds. What are you arguing, that I hate men? That I only want women to be treated with respect? Bro. I’ve been laughing so hard this entire time. Get a grip.

unpopularopinion,ffz6xgy,t3_evxvil,1580365883.0,"Women’s sports aren’t *advertised*. Ballpark (haha) percentages for ads you’ve seen about men’s sports and ads you’ve seen about women’s sports. People who are not explicitly into women’s sports will see more ads for men. This has been the case since women were allowed to play sports. People believed women were inferior, women drew in smaller crowds, advertisers advertised men more, people kept believing men were better at sports than women, and so the cycle goes. There are plenty of women’s teams, take soccer for example, that score better than their male counterparts from the same country. It’s not about talent, it’s about being advertised. Women can’t draw in bigger crowds until advertisers start promoting women’s sports. There’s no difference in talent or work ethic among athletes, but there is a cycle keeping women out of the athletic spotlight that has to be broken before women’s sports has a chance of drawing in crowds. Unfortunately for female athletes, advertisers are smart and ruthlessly penny-pinching, and they have no reason to start advertising women’s sports more often until they see an uptick in interest, which won’t happen without proper advertising of equally skilled athletes.

You can see where I’m going with this. The cycle of playing and advertising has always favored men and will always favor men unless advertisers have a reason to promote women and men equally. If I did just as well or better than men in my field but earned a tenth of their pay because men advertised men to other men, I’d complain about it too.

Pets,ffz5f53,t3_evys9b,1580364608.0,"Veterinary advice is poorly given online, so I won’t attempt to diagnose your cat. According to VCA, an American veterinary organization, short-term effects of steroids in cats are usually increased thirst and hunger and mild lethargy (tiredness). Long-term effects can include weight gain because of increased hunger, slightly higher risk of UTIs, and hair loss or poor coat quality. It’s possible your cat is just more hungry and wants the food your other cat is getting.

From my experience, cats experience mild jealousy when someone else gets treats. My own bridge troll won’t let me pet her for a while if I give my dog a treat but don’t feed her. Also from my experience, big changes, like moving, really affect cats, and can make them more aggressive as they get used to it. It’s hard to tell the difference, but try to break up real fighting between cats (with intent to hurt) via water, throwing towels over each of them, or other surprising but not harmful distractions, and separate them until they cool down.

Talk to your vet about these symptoms if they worry you, but it sounds like your cat is just being prissy, and of course we all project onto our children. I’d also recommend asking your vet for more details about why exactly your cat is taking steroids - it seems common symptoms are things your cat already struggles with - so you’re always well-informed about their health. In general, if you or someone in your care is being treated for something, know what it is, what the treatment is, how the treatment works, and what the side effects are. It can only help."

He’s a genius of a kid, and he worries a lot about legal trouble if he gets busted preventing him from getting into a good college. Ideally, he could report his dad for what I’m sure is a long prison sentence of abuse, but whether his mom would assume custody or he’d be tossed into the foster care system, which is notorious in the US for its abusive parents, lack of homes, and penchant for exposing kids to drugs and alcohol, is murky at best. Right now, John’s only months out from college, which, with the scholarships he’s been offered by great schools, means freedom. Many kids are in these situations, and it’s always complicated. The system to protect kids from being abused and doing drugs is very flawed, and it usually puts kids in just another position to be abused and do drugs. What the US needs is programs to help kids on drugs get clean safely and prevent children from ending up in abusive situations. There’s a lot of systemic flaws to be addressed before minors vaping stops being a problem, but presentations are easy to do.

John came to school with a sprained wrist a few days later when he was caught drinking at school. He’s a brilliant chemistry student, plans to study biochem in college. He knows vaping is bad for him. Because of his crude sense of humor, he has few close friends at a small private school of mostly wealthy, white, female students. John has depression. He’s had it for a very long time. When he tried weed for the first time, the bad feelings went away. For John, vaping is the only thing that makes him happy. He sits through a lot of presentations where people tell him vaping is bad and chemicals are dangerous, which he already knows, and it’s not going to stop him. John has expressed to me his strong desire to quit using drugs as soon as he stops living with his parents, but he also expresses fear he won’t be able to because he’s been hooked since he was twelve years old. I don’t cast judgement on John for vaping. If I was him, I probably would, too. I’m glad he’s turned to drugs instead of serious crime or self-injury. Everyone who vapes knows it’s bad for you before they start, but vague statements are worthless in comparison to eight hours a day where John doesn’t feel sad or get beaten.

Presentations that I’ve seen have never even recommended that the many kids in the audience vaping talk to a doctor about it. Healthcare is not free in the US and appointments are very expensive, and the students ages 12-18 in question still do appointments through their parents, who they usually don’t want to tell about vaping. It would be really nice if kids could talk to doctors about it without fear of (possibly violent) repercussions from parents, but for many kids who vape, this isn’t an option. A lot of these kids don’t go to the doctor anyways. The money isn’t there, and the unhappiness being too poor for the things people expect everyone to have directly contribute to the craving for nicotine, which makes people feel temporary happiness while using it. The number of kids who vape is not small. In an audience of about 100 people during one presentation, I personally knew 20 who still vaped. Solutions and resources for quitting that are accessible to poor kids who can’t afford a doctor’s opinion or the beatings they’d receive from their parents or a prison sentence for being black and breaking the law are absolutely critical in preventing more people from vaping. If no one does it, people tend to think it’s less cool. Health is not a luxury for the wealthy and white."

unpopularopinion,ffz0v2t,t1_ffyyjsl,1580360383.0,"My apologies for being unclear; vaping leads to nicotine addiction if one uses the standard vape pens that contain nicotine. The “might as well pass out heroin” is hyperbole. A nicotine addiction is just that, like how marijuana will only make you want to keep smoking marijuana. The idea of a “gateway drug” comes from a racist and fascist movement against anti-war sentiment and Latinx immigrants. My point is that vaping bad and all but shunning is a useless practice."
MurderedByWords,ffz0oe8,t1_ffyyaq4,1580360224.0,"I bet a lot of conversations with you are over when you beat the same point into the dust. I sympathize with men being judged for their height, let me tell you, but society treats height like hair color, especially for women, while weight is a touchy subject all around, especially in places like the US where many people struggle with maintaining a healthy weight and there’s a lot of criticism for not being skinny. I think it’s fine for someone talking to someone else online to discuss height in order to establish that their partner isn’t turned off by it, but I in no way appreciate the idea that people come in statistical ideals. The woman might be 6’0” and worried that a man might feel uncomfortable going out with her if he’s 5’8”, or she could be asking a shallow question based on shallow tradition. Either way, don’t ask people how “heavy” they are, because it sounds rude."
unpopularopinion,ffz0aav,t1_ffyy80j,1580359895.0,"As with smoking, simple steps to weaning oneself off or advice on how to quit cold turkey if that’s better. Discussion of dosage, concentration, and types of inhalation so people preparing to quit know how and have a higher chance of success. Clear explanations of withdrawal symptoms and how to alleviate those that can be alleviated. Strategies for talking to trusted people who can help you quit and keep you on track. Right now, in the US, the system is meant to bust kids for vaping, not to prevent them from vaping. E-cigarettes are easy to obtain, at least where I live, and cops have a habit of cracking down harder on poor and black students who are often more likely to be exposed to drugs and vapes than wealthy white kids, who usually get a slap on the wrist where I live. Kids I’ve talked to who freely discuss their vaping habits also express that they don’t know any adults they can talk to who won’t tell their parents or law enforcement and cause them more problems. The shunning doesn’t work, and it’s making kids afraid of reaching out for help, even when they want to quit."
