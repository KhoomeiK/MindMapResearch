I remember when I came home after an acid trip. My brain was mashed potatoes 24h after dropping. Saw my mom and sister leave the house, and so I just quickly ran around to make sure I didn't need to talk to them... It was also my mom's birthday, so even worse."

GetMotivated,fg4b6di,t1_fg43nlj,1580500029.0,"It's not shallow. Maybe you should overthink his words, and realize how true they are instead. Literally every philosophy that helps with treating anxiety tells you the same as this guy just told you. It's on you to figure out HOW to do it though. HOW to stop an unhealthy thought right in its tracks.

GetMotivated,fg4awz1,t3_ewm3su,1580499870.0,"Not sure why so many are disagreeing with this... 

If there's one thing I learned from my anxiety and overthinking, it is that it's ME who's enabling it in the first place. I do things that enable me to overthink, and I don't kill the thought off when it's still easy to do so...before it gets obsessively out of hand. In fact, sometimes I'm feeding it, knowingly. 

You need to stop thinking, not by forcing yourself to stop thinking and worrying, but by doing something else right away. Something that you can't do while also overthinking. Some exercise is a great start. Come back to the thought when you're already feeling a bit better, less emotional. Work out a solution if there's an actual problem, else make sure you keep distracting yourself from the thought by doing something more productive or by actively creating a happy thought. 

I'll get downvoted for this saying this, but that's only because some of you think their overthinking is some kind of magical spell they can't undo... You can undo it, but you'll have to learn it, and it's gonna take some time to train your mind not to overthink in vain. Be proactive. Don't self-pity."

tressless,fft4gcq,t3_ev3na4,1580206594.0,"Bro... Just trim that hair. For real. I felt miserable too. It was last summer, and I wouldn't even go out to enjoy the weather because I had to make sure my thin hair was somewhat presentable. I'd try to wear caps as often as possible spending time on my hair. Had to comb my hair a specific way to hide thinning, had to use mouse... And needed to blow dry it for extra puff too. And sometimes the whole operation failed, and I'd basically have to shower again and redo everything for it to succeed.

God, just thinking of all the insecurity that went into trying to fix something like that ... I can promise you that it will be easier to just trim it all of man. I know, it seems like a big step, which it is. But it will give you so much peace. You'll find people to be pretty accepting. Heck, I'm a 21 yo that trims my head, and some girl in the library next to me was telling her friend how attractive she finds guys that trim/shave...People WILL accept whatever you look like. Some of the most likeable persons I know are also some of the least good looking. You're basically holding on to a dying person, and that's causing you a lot of pain and suffering. Let it go, you've blown the importance of your hair out of proportion enough. You shouldn't be suffering for it man. You can continue treatment while trimming your hair, but don't grow it when it's making you insecure.

LSD,ff4gma8,t1_ff4bnw5,1579563128.0,"I mean, weed does make the trip more intense... But same for me, the known territory gives me a feeling of calm during the storminess of an acid trip. I associate it with relaxation to such a degree that it can even relax me during a trip, even when it's making everything more intense in reality.

There's no way I'll recommend smoking weed to calm down during a trip though... This is a very subjective matter, and where for some it relaxes them, for others it can make things go south very quickly. There's just to many variables here to be recommending anything. It truly is something you'll only know from your own experience. It already starts with how different everyone in a group will react from the same acid dosage, I think that's enough of a lesson to not be passing around joints during a trip with the claim of ""here, this will calm you down a bit"" lol"
LSD,ff4fkt3,t1_ff4b4gh,1579562421.0,"Since thinking clearly about normal things is somewhat difficult, I made it a habit to clearly define rules for myself before I trip. As in, I'll have it known beforehand what the plan is gonna be (in broad terms, not a limiting way). I'll know where we'll be walking of we go outside, and I'll beforehand determine the risk of getting caught etc and make sure I TRULY believe in what I deduced so that there's no doubt in my mind about that. Then if I ever get paranoid, I'll eventually be reminded by that my sober self already determined that it's all fine and there's no need to worry, and since I trust my sober self I'll just leave the thought at that and do whatever lies in the predetermined boundaries."
LSD,ff4faz8,t1_ff45saq,1579562236.0,"I feel like there's several factors at play for me when I smoke weed during a trip (especially in public at night), for one it makes me less paranoid about getting caught... As I explained before. Also weed being that old trusted first time drug that I'm very comfortable using, it makes me feel pseudo-sober... It reminds me of just getting stoned, which is very trusted territory. Even just having a joint in my hand does that for me. 

At the same time weed makes my trips much more intense, but it going hand in hand with the feeling of known territory combats anxiety and fear. It makes everything just easier to accept (some CBD oil helps too for me).

I'm sure not a lot of people will share my experience, but it really does work for me. My last trip was ~500mcg with around 5 joints total... And although it was very intense, having the smoking be somewhat of a main theme focus during the trip made me and my friend a lot more relaxed. Sharing the joints was another story, us both have never been so stingy with passing a joint lmao"
LSD,ff45inc,t1_ff3vq9v,1579555997.0,"I remember on one of my trips that smoking a joint to felt like it made us less suspicious in public. We walked by a police car that stopped to let us pass, and I made a hand gesture with an obvious joint in my hand...

LSD,ff3vbyt,t1_ff3r1m1,1579549648.0,"Where I live tripping is legal, it's strictly the possession of acid which is illegal.

It's really only when you're in possession of quantities that signal that you might be a dealer that you get into trouble.

The willingness (and eagerness) to accept a new type of discomfort and make peace with it I'd say is the MOST important thing to avoid a bad trip. If you don't want a bad trip, then don't be afraid to experience one.

That's not to say I set things up to have a bad trip. I always put some extra efforts to take good care of myself both mentally and physically before tripping. I also use CBD oil for the come up jittery nerves, and ibuprofen for the itchy skin. Part of being able to challenge yourself on a trip comes from the confidence and positive mindset that good self-care brings.
