Minneapolis,ffisy2h,t1_ffhalvp,1579981927.0,That rate for the 1918 flu pandemic means that 2.5% of THE ENTIRE GLOBAL POPULATION died of the flu (some estimates are more than that). The rate at which those who were infected died was probably more like 10-20%.
MensLib,ffhwt2g,t1_ffh8m98,1579957395.0,"Lots of good role models of positive masculinity, particularly Sam Vimes as he grows into his changing role in the world. I’m not sure if any of the wizards qualify, though."
MensLib,ffh2mfl,t3_eti5cp,1579921439.0,"Someone else mentioned the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett, but I will elaborate on that. After the first two (which are just fun takes on fantasy tropes), the Discworld books are basically social commentary disguised as fun fantasy books. The witches series deals with why women are witches but men are wizards (and turns both of those ideas on their heads at some point). Monstrous Regiment is about a rag-tag military group that slowly discovers that most of them are women disguised as men. The later Sam Vimes books touch on female dwarfs, who have always had to look and act like their male counterparts, essentially “coming out” as female."

pointlesslygendered,ff7r7y4,t3_es3sdi,1579656398.0,I had a shampoo bar once that smelled like campfire. But only when my hair was wet. The smell totally disappeared when my hair dried. It was weird.
IAmA,ff3s5xq,t3_erek2q,1579547688.0,My daughter has a tree nut allergy that was diagnosed at 9 years old. She has had eczema since she was a baby. The allergist we have seen said eczema and allergies frequently happen together. What is known about the mechanism of action for this? Does the eczema cause the allergy somehow? Or does some underlying thing make you more prone to have both?
askscience,ff3ka2z,t1_ff3jx3s,1579542848.0,"I am an RN and used to work on a peds floor with seizure patients, so I was probably a little more prepared for it than most. I’ve worked with newborns for the past decade plus, though, and they have seizures for other reasons."
askscience,ff38v90,t1_ff34nyd,1579536435.0,"That article also talks more about recurrence than initial febrile seizures. I guess it’s harder to study the first one because you have no idea when it will happen. I wonder if because children who have a febrile seizure at a lower temp are more likely to have recurrences, the total number of febrile seizures (not per patient, but total overall) would be more at lower temps? This is the chart I want to see!

My daughter starting getting high temps with every damn thing when she was about 15 months old, usually around 104, peaking with a UTI at 3 years old that caused fevers in the 106 range for a few days. (If you want to have a bad time, try getting a urine sample from a screaming, feverish 3-year-old who is potty trained but afraid of toilets that aren’t at her house.) When she was 5, she had a probably viral illness with temps over 105 for five days straight. I used to be extremely paranoid about febrile seizures. She never had one."
askscience,ff331ja,t1_ff30pb3,1579532385.0,"I can’t seem to find any evidence to support that they are more common at higher temps. A little more googling this morning led me to [this study](https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/911417.pdf). It seems like if a child’s first febrile seizure occurs at a lower temp, they are more likely to have a recurrence (they have a lower threshold for them). Shorter duration of fever before the seizure is also correlated with higher risk of recurrence. All of which I find super interesting. Guess I’m reading about febrile seizures today."
askscience,ff2z9pf,t1_ff24q4t,1579529349.0,"I was under the impression that febrile seizures could occur with any degree of fever, and that they had more to do with how quickly the body’s temperature rose rather than the max temperature it reached. My daughter used to get temps in the 105-106 range with pretty much every illness, so I investigated this a bit when she was younger. It’s been 4 or 5 years since she’s had one that high, though."
todayilearned,ff1yrjx,t1_ff1ulde,1579489289.0,"That is definitely true, but it is not relevant to the initial point I made that it’s silly to blame the Baby Boomers for an injustice that was occurring when they were infants. The article does imply that Rankin pushing for the program to be administered by individual states rather than the federal government was a contributing factor. We can’t replay history with different inputs to see if it would have actually made a difference, though."
todayilearned,ff1bhi3,t1_ff14794,1579477161.0,"I guess there were probably members of that generation who were involved in various institutions involved in the GI Bill. The Congress member the article talks about is John Rankin, who was born in 1882 and definitely not a member of the Greatest Generation."

I use a little water to get the consistency I want, I have no idea what they use for the mass-produced stuff. I feel like I remember seeing somewhere that canned pumpkin sometimes contains other squashes. Maybe that’s the color difference?"
