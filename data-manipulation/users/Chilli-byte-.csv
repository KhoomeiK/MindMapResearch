Xiaomi,fftlkgk,t1_fftfcy1,1580223663.0,"What does the non Chinese one look like? It was MIUI 10, I've updated now but it doesn't look too different. I thought I had the global version (needed to run Google Services in China)... If not I might want to swap."
Xiaomi,fftldba,t1_ffth9ai,1580223523.0,What's a gcam? I recently found the added PRO modo on the standard camera app and the quality of my photos have already improved tenfold. I love it!
Perfectfit,fftkzk7,t1_fftjc51,1580223254.0,"Oh right, I didn't even think about that... I've never owned a mounted TV before, all my cables just come out the sides.


Thanks, that makes it even more satisfying"

EDIT: I'm an idiot, I didn't think about it being wired into the wall."
AskOuija,fftek4x,t1_fftcl8a,1580218255.0,But now I've gone and *blown* it all away.
Showerthoughts,fftdv5t,t1_fftcakv,1580217650.0,What about a jaunt?
Vaping,fftdt41,t3_ev56wx,1580217599.0,"I guess there's a possibility that you would inhale them. Do you fluff and tend to your cotton? Do you prime your cotton with juice? I like to pull the cotton a few times to remove loose bits and then get the cotton drenched before I start to vape, which holds anything else down."
Showerthoughts,fftdke1,t3_ev57rk,1580217381.0,Maybe they'll treat it better
AskOuija,fftcclq,t3_ev588p,1580216250.0,Goodbye.
Xiaomi,fft9qkk,t1_ffsyg92,1580213634.0,"No mods, and I didn't even realise MIUI was on 11 now! I thought all the updates were automatic and have been updating regularly. How did I miss a key thing like that?! Updating it now."
Xiaomi,fft9mjl,t1_ffsvk15,1580213509.0,"I woke up and my phone had gone down to 6%. Plugged it in and it started charging again, so I think it was something along these lines. Thank you!"
