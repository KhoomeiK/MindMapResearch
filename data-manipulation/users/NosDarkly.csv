The violence in TV and film is fake, while the genitals are generally real.

Perhaps three different families on the same block were keeping visibly broken pool tables in their houses for years and when one threw theirs away, it inspired the rest to as well.

""The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. ... They have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering ... and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world.""

 
Kaczynski argued that ""revolution"" that would trigger a complete technological breakdown was the only solution.
