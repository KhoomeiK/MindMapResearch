Second of all, there is no evil food, that being said, there are foods that are more nutritious than others. Like kiwi (An extremely nutritious fruit) is going to have a lot better micros and macros than a mcdonalds cheese burger. I would highly recommend counting calories if you can, and since you're still in school, I would probably meal prep a lot of your meals to make it easier on you to eat. For how much you should be eating, what are your goals? Do you want to gain muscle mass without caring about adding on a little bit of fat you can cut later, do you want to put on muscle but not gain fat (This is going to be slower) or do you want to just cut fat?"

Same goes for any Christian who is racist, homophobic, or hating other people of other religions.
