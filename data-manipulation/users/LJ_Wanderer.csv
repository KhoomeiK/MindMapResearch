CherokeeXJ,ffkbwft,t3_eu2zbp,1580020240.0,When you run the heat do you smell anything?  Like a maple smell?  If so your heater core has a leak.  You should also pull your plugs (one at a time) to check the electrodes.  You can look here to see what sick a fouled plug would look like: https://www.knowyourparts.com/technical-resources/engine/diagnosing-spark-plugs/

todayilearned,ffhj2ya,t1_ffhi804,1579937532.0,"Nah I've only been shooting rifles for 44 years in competition and recreationally, even earned Expert while I was in the Army.  My instructors include Jim Laughland.  I know the difficulty of the shot.  But experts like Hathcock know how their rifles / ammo react to temp & humidity, that's why they keep a dope book. That shot was talent intersecting with opportunity.  Few have the talent, most of us (myself included)will never attain his level of skill."

todayilearned,feln808,t1_felcp24,1579226214.0,"I don't know if the GAZ was reverse engineered or the Jeep was just an inspiration.  Though the Soviets did copy the Studebaker trucks we sent.  Japanese industry was directed to copy the Jeep during WW2, but the best of their copies were post war Toyota FJ40s.

The Jeep name was copywrited by Willie's in 1943 (which Ford fought for and lost).  It's origins are still debated.  Some say from GP (Ford's Jeep - Willie's were MBs); others say it's from the old Pop-Eye comics.  Eugene the Jeep was a critter that could go over, under, through anything.  Personally I favor the GP theory.

Neat to know Willie's is still used.  They owned Jeep for a while, then sold it to Kaiser (the guys that made a bunch of Liberty ships), then AMC had it, then Chrysler (which got bought by Dailmer-Benz, and now Fiat).  Though Jeep brought back the Willie's name for a variant of Wrangler a few years back."
todayilearned,felbkm8,t1_fel8vwa,1579218341.0,"You're quite welcome, I'm a bit of a Jeep nerd.  During the second trials Willy's Overland and Ford also submitted vehicles.  The Army selected bits of each vehicle (the engine from Willie's, flat fender and hood from Ford IIRC) to produce what we know as the Jeep.  Willie's got the largest party of the contract, with Ford #2.  Poor Bantam, who's design was used, was judged to be to small to produce for the War.  The few vehicles they produced were mostly sent to the Soviets on lend/lease.  As a consolation prize the Army have them the contract to make Jeep trailers."
todayilearned,fel2b8a,t1_fekobgx,1579212525.0,"No that was a photo op.  It was more like the time Bantam designed (5 days) and built (44 days) the Blitz Buggy, then immediately drove that prototype from Butler PA (North of Pittsburgh) to the East side of Baltimore MD for Army testing (they just made the contract time).  

Today we know the ""Blitz Buggy"" as the first Jeep.  Willy's engineers were present at testing and took many of Bantams ideas/design to make a vehicle for the next series of tests."
