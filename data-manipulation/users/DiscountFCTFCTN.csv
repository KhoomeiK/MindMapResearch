Austria,ff6mb94,t1_ff6f0at,1579630244.0,"Ein altbekanntes Problem: Linke Parteien kritisiert man, weil man sich besseres erhofft hat. Konservative ignoriert man großteils, weil man von denen eh nur Scheiße erwartet hat.

Unschöner Nebeneffekt: Am Ende steht überproportional viel Grünenkritik wenig ÖVP-Kritik gegenüber, was ein verzerrtes Bild vermitteln kann, wer wie viel Schuld trägt."

de,ff3eto1,t1_ff2p7nk,1579539619.0,"Islamismus ist ja nicht links, das ist ein unglaublich dummer, aber überraschend effektiver Spin rechter Parteien.  
Der radikale Islam ist lupenrein rechtsextrem wie sonst was. Islam und Faschismus mögen sich nach außen hin gegenüberstehen, aber unter dem jeweiligen Deckmäntelchen steckt doch dieselbe Ideologie. 

Was ich damit eigentlich sagen will: Der Name ""Horseshoe Theory"" passt au kaum ein Gespräch so schlecht wie auf eines zwischen Fascho und Islamist."
AreTheStraightsOK,ff3bp25,t3_er8rdr,1579538018.0,"Okay, I looked this up because I refused to believe that a quote that started ""Consider the woman who plays with her clitoris"" was real.  
It's real, the quote is from his books Sexual Desires, but in the version I found, he talks about the woman's lover in third person. Which, makes it like 5% less weird I guess?  

>Thus, when masturbation intrudes into the sexual act, it has precisely that freezing 
character which turns us from perversion. Consider the woman who plays with her 
clitoris during the act of coition. Such a person affronts her lover with the obscene 
display of her body, and, in perceiving her thus, the lover perceives his own irrelevance. 
She becomes disgusting to him, and his desire may be extinguished. The woman's desire 
is satisfied at the expense of her lover's, and no real union can be achieved between them. 
The incipient obscenity of masturbation threatens the intentionality of desire, and brings 
us constantly to the verge of perversion. Hence it is wholly natural to us to perceive our 
own flesh as 'forbidden territory', like the flesh of our family."
