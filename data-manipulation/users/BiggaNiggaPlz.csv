Empaths,fgmdilu,t1_fgm1m4a,1580922464.0,I would actually argue that the meme should be “99 problems and 89 that I refuse to accept as my own.”
UpliftingNews,fgmd4vt,t1_fgm6vp1,1580922268.0,Yeah they either don’t understand how vast of a landmass Canada is or don’t understand how weather works. Or hell maybe don’t understand how statistics/probability/data samples work.
Empaths,fgmcrmr,t1_fgm1icb,1580922079.0,This makes perfect sense and I think this is a very important distinction. Thank you for your insight.
Empaths,fgm073s,t1_fglq996,1580915180.0,"Ahhh gotcha. That actually makes sense.

However - one distinction between that and I guess from what I understood your original answer to be is - these are your own feelings. Not the plants. The plant isn’t really communicating with you at all, you are just putting yourself in its position and feeling on behalf of it. Does that make sense and would you agree?"
Empaths,fgm00s2,t1_fglq0zj,1580915065.0,I like this answer and I can fully understand and support this! Honestly one of the few answers here that make sense to me.
Empaths,fglzwqz,t1_fgloy1e,1580914991.0,"For sure ultimately how you feel and your own opinion of your feelings is really the most important thing.

As an outsider though I am just looking for facts or objective research (if that’s even possible) on the topic.

Thanks for your answers."
Empaths,fglkkg2,t1_fglkbrp,1580902235.0,I see. Well I don’t want to invalidate your own experiences so we’ll leave it at that.
UpliftingNews,fglkhhv,t1_fgksmnn,1580902135.0,This question has no serious answer because no general weather statement applies to all of Canada.
Empaths,fglk3se,t1_fgljfwm,1580901668.0,Ok and how do you know you aren’t just delusional or making things up in your head that are not actually real? It sounds to me like it’s never actually been validated that Empaths feel another person’s emotions...
Empaths,fgljzza,t1_fgljitu,1580901536.0,"Where is this stat from?

And again how does an Empath decide an emotion is their own or it’s another persons? Has this ever been validated by anyone other than themselves? It sounds more plausible that the person is psychotic or delusional than “feeling another’s emotions” and yet it’s never been confirmed as such."
LiveFromNewYork,fgliu15,t1_fglb3rl,1580899970.0,She nailed the impressions though?

Is there any literature/research on the reading energy/exchange phenomena?"
Empaths,fgli3iu,t1_fgl5fi4,1580898900.0,"This is one of the things that I can’t fully seem to grasp about empaths. From my experience most people are happy/satisfied/positive for the most part. Yes there are times people are troubled, upset, straight up miserable, but for that to be the norm and to be the vibes that Empaths always seem to pick up on makes no sense to me. 

Maybe it is though and humanity is truly miserable deep down... but it’s not something I have observed to be the norm. It makes more sense to me that Empaths themselves are the ones that are depressed or down but for some reason perceive that as other people’s emotions. 

My question then would be... how do you know the emotions are actually someone’s else’s and not your own?"
Empaths,fglhso8,t1_fgl4x3z,1580898457.0,"Fair enough man. Maybe it’s actually true and people do actually experience this. 

I would be be fascinated to do some more research on it in that case because it sounds really interesting. Are there any studies or documentaries about this? Is there any research that I can read as a starting point?"
Empaths,fglhnbj,t1_fgl2dge,1580898233.0,What’s hsp?
Empaths,fgkw6a3,t1_fgkfepg,1580875027.0,"So in a nutshell you are saying you are psychic?

Do you have some examples of such instances? How are you so sure this isn’t all just made up in your head?"
Empaths,fgkvtic,t1_fgj3r0t,1580874780.0,How can you say that it’s empathy rather than depression? Why so empaths always seem to only receive or talk about negative emotions?
Empaths,fgkv9n0,t1_fgk2w3y,1580874398.0,"Haha well my friend, I used to always consider myself someone with higher than normal empathy (but lower than normal sympathy - just based on self observation). I thought I related to empaths the more I read about it. Picking up on people’s body language, time of voice, phrasing, volume, eyes. Even skin tone, are they flushed or pale? Bags under eyes? Jittery/frustrated/relaxed? Being able to tell if a conversion is relaxed or tense, how someone is receiving and perceiving things. The list goes on - ultimately it’s very empirical  but subconscious interpretation of other people’s feelings. And I’ll admit sometimes not what I thought an encounter was when I recount it later.

But then I got to this sub... and I will try to be as polite as possible about this... I am trying so hard to understand what is going on here. Most stories and examples I see are either meta/precognition, sometimes even omniscient. Sometimes it’s vibes and energies, other times it straight up sounds like people are just giving examples of anxiety/paranoia/psychosis. So many posts have nothing to do with empathy or empaths. 

Anyways, I’m not here to troll but to truly understand. I made this thread to try to see what others thought. Going to go through the replies and be as open minded as possible."
Empaths,fgkt0g6,t1_fgiyan3,1580872947.0,"Can you elaborate on the plants part? Are you saying you can interpret a plants emotions beyond just its physical appearance?

wayhome,fgh0etz,t1_fggzmvw,1580773723.0,"I feel like if that same line up came out today though it would be sold out in seconds.

I agree many of your points. But cli don’t think Frank has had any (or maybe a few) festival appearances since then. Justice went in to win a Grammy for their WWW album and to this day is one of my top 5 sets. Porter is just now releasing an album after how popular Worlds and that set was. Flume has been headliner or sub on so many festivals since then. I don’t even like Marshmello but that year was probably his prime. Solanges album from that year was on most top 100 albums of the decade.

Like it’s nuts to think about but at least 10 of the artists from that year would headline or sub a festival like Coachella if they were to be billed this year."
wayhome,fggk5ya,t3_ey2m6r,1580763560.0,"I’m so pissed at the public reaction to the 2017 line up. Considering how well that line up aged - it’s so sad to think about the shit that went down that lead to the demise of this festival. The organizers didn’t even cancel it considering the low sales, they just gave out free tickets and put on one hell of a show.

Of all that festivals that got canned Wayhome did not deserve it at all. I would gladly go in blind and buy a ticket regardless of line up if they announced Wayhome was coming back."

The lyrics/singers are usually pretty subpar and even the arrangements are basic, but to say pop music isn’t well produced (for the most part) is a lie. 

Off the top of my head Starboy comes to mind as an album where production is the sole reason if was so well received.
