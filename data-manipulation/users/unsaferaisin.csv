Which frankly reflects exceedingly poorly on the people turning her down, since performance matters more than a name, but still. Her parents didn't seem to have considered that she would have to answer to that for the rest of her life, and that what's cute on a baby (as a nickname) might not work out the best on an adult."

I graduated college directly into the recession, so I really, really hear what you're saying about career and the fear that you'll never make it to where you've worked to be. It's really scary and it totally skews your whole vision of the future. To an extent I'm still in that, but I want to let you know that you can still get to a better place. I'm definitely underemployed right now, but the wage is good and I'm doing meaningful work and that's miles from where I ever thought i would be. It took years of sustained effort, but lucky for you you're already good at that. You can get out of this. I can't tell you when or how, but it's a lot like fitness- you keep putting in the work, you keep a critical eye on your habits so you don't fall into bad ones, and the work pays off. That might be hard to hear right now and that's totally fair, but you absolutely have it within you to do this."

I'm guessing that OP's parents are overwhelmed, and perhaps not connected with the appropriate resources for managing both their child and their own mental health/personal time. Which sucks, but which will not be solved by expecting one of their children to silently, passively take physical beatings. They're way out of line and they really ought to hear that from another adult, preferably one who can help link them up with caregiving and behavior modification specialists."

That's the time when kids are starting to experience new feelings while having to navigate changing and more complex social environments. I remember a lot of ""but it's not *fair!*"" from that time of life, because you're still more of a kid than you want to believe, so you end up leaning on the old playground rules to try to make sense of things.

You were a child yourself, living in a country with difficult healhcare practices, and you felt that you couldn't confide in your parents. You were doing this without the support and wisdom of fully-fledged adults. You felt that you had no choice but to pretend that nothing was happening, and while I don't know your parents, I do remember feeling terrified for my own parents to know virtually anything about my life. I remember well how much that can distort your thinking. And I know how that distorted thinking can make you blame yourself for everything, even things that never happened. Who's to say, definitively, that total best rest would have solved it all? It doesn't all the time. I know someone who followed doctors' orders to a T, as an adult, stayed on her strict bed rest, and still suffered a loss. It's tempting to believe that life has an order to it, and that if you just dot your i's and cross your t's, things will work out, but the truth is that things are also random.

LosAngeles,fdhb7n4,t1_fdh2i49,1578419258.0,"Yeah, I think it's down to how people are raised. You treat a kid in any culture like they can do no wrong and the sun shines out of their ass, well, you're probably not getting a very well-adjusted, considerate adult out of it.

I'm sorry that things worked out this way, but you're not a monster, nor did you come to your breaking point overnight. Please consider going to therapy to sort these feelings out. You're never responsible for another person's actions, and frankly it sounds like you have lingering trauma from the day-to-day of the relationship that is hurting you.

AskReddit,fdehwvw,t1_fde51xw,1578339389.0,"Also, that coworker, who is a full-fledged adult, slept with his college-freshman daughter (Having been both ages in my life, yeah, I was legally an adult as a freshman, but I knew way less than I did in my mid-20s), *while lying about his age and identity,* and potentially compromising the integrity of an investigation. There's a lot to be upset about that has nothing in particular to do with a dad thinking he owns his daughter. Like...his employee, who was supposed to be on campus in a professional capacity, started a romance with someone he was lying to. That's pretty upsetting on its face. You're totally right on this one. I'd have been really upset and creeped out if I found out my new boyfriend from Sociology was a grown man lying to me, and it wouldn't have been because I think sex is icky. I mean I'm not gonna claim to speak for every late-teenage girl, but I do kind of have a different angle on the situation, having been in the character's shoes as a college kid (and having been hit on by plenty of grown men, which was legal but oh so gross and unpleasant- a feeling I still have in my 30s), so there's that."

But in any case, the objection people have in this situation is that often, people pray to make themselves feel better rather than to help others (You may feel that's subjective; that's fair, as we can't necessarily know what another is thinking), and/or that people will pray without offering tangible support like donations or help with meals/cleaning/shelter (More easily measured; $10 helps the Red Cross demonstrably more than a Hail Mary). People also feel that attributing everything to prayer diminishes the extraordinary work and sacrifice that people make in times of crisis- like the surgeon and fireman don't count and shouldn't be honored, because someone across the world did it all because they prayed. That can seem dismissive and rude, and it categorically excludes volunteers of other faith traditions (or no faith tradition) by removing their motivations and ethics from their own work."
offmychest,fde3kc7,t1_fddxtz1,1578330403.0,"Material support for relief organizations is pretty much always your best bet. Most of the time, that will mean a monetary donation, as people who work for charities know how to allocate the money, can make sure they get specifically what is needed, and may have discounts that will help the money go farther. Some organizations may be requesting specific goods and that's fine too; just keep an eye on their wishlists and consider communicating with them before mailing anything out. [Here are some places to start](https://ktla.com/2020/01/04/heres-how-to-donate-to-firefighters-relief-groups-in-australia-as-deadly-wildfires-rage/) if you would like to donate.

She was dumb as a fucking brick, and needed extended training on very simple parts of her job, that she told us she could do already during the interview. I explained our filing system to her several times: it's alphabetical by vendor, newest stuff on top. She looks at an invoice from Local Sash & Door and asks me, seriously, if it's the same thing as an invoice from Neighbor Hardwood. Also looked for a vendor starting with T in the S file. That's not the extent of her stupidity, but it's the stuff that rendered me speechless.

EDIT: For additional context, this was well over a month into her job, which was simply to provide desk coverage for a supervisor who was often in the field. So all she had to do was read emails, reply to some of them, and help with basic office tasks when she had free time (Which was often). This was not during the first run of training. She had disclosed no learning disabilities and was a native English speaker. She just didn't give a shit, which combined with whatever other deficiencies she had to make...this."

That can be hard to manage sometimes, but when you step back and consider that our programming and recreation centers are the main or sole way they socialize and engage, you have an easier time listening.

She grew up in a time when people passed away more and younger than we're used to now, so being a woman who could work was simply prudence.
