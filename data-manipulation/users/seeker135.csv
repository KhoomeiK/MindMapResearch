pics,fex4ows,t3_eqqr7r,1579424294.0,"Science has proven what friends of dogs have known for generations. The loss of a fur friend can have the same effect, *or more*, on the heart muscle in ""grief reaction"" heart attacks.

The loss is real, the grief is real.

Our (mostly) brown-eyed, four-footed friends give so much, in so many different ways, that we can't help taking their companionship, their never-ending good nature, and their honest affection for granted, just a little bit.

And then suddenly, and too soon, it is the final goodbye, and afterward you feel like you just stepped off a cliff.

The warmth of her happy greeting is gone. Did you know that when you come home to your four-friend, their reaction, as measured by oxytocin levels, is the same as *falling in love all over again*. It's not ""over-reacting"". They really feel it.

We dog friends are given a kind of peace of mind  during their time with us, the one mankind has basked in for untold thousands of years, that if an an enemy comes, I have a warrior carnivore sleeping at my feet. She is my friend, and will give her life in defense of this homestead and her people. And now that feeling, too, is gone.

There is so much I have learned in the last six years from my thirteen -year-old Boxer, I regret not knowing most of it sooner. But some things can't be helped. Like the short lifespan of our most loyal and devoted friend. I would not like them to have eighty-year-lives and more, like parrots and men. But is twenty years really too much to ask?

But perhaps most important, the fur person in our lives will always *listen* when we speak, forever ready and willing to assist us in whatever we may do. They may not know exactly what to do in a new situation. But you know you can count on one hundred percent effort, one hundred percent of the time, no matter the task.

That's a better deal than you get from your mother, after about four years. Dogs, twelve, thirteen years later, still in there, pitching. Just the same as day one. And day one thousand. And every other damn day.

I no longer believe we are the only creatures with ""souls."" I have seen and felt too much from too many smart dogs. I have watched too many different breeds learn my language and *try to speak it* not to notice the intelligence, and the emotional changes in my friends.

@ OP: I will someday soon walk where you walk now. Feeling the joy of having had the experience is difficult when all you want is to wrap your arms around about seventy pounds of best friend ever, but the rules on this plane say you can't do that anymore. 

I wish you Peace."

This book was recommended to me by my therapist. It made, and continues to make, an immense difference in my life. You sound like you  have a couple of things going on that this book might help with.

Just so you know, I really, really don't like ""self-help"" books. I feel most of them are selling something they can't deliver to the majority of the people. Dr. Burns' book is entirely different. There is no jargon, no ""mumbo-jumbo"" of any kind. His words on the page are straightforward and understandable.

I found Dr. Burns to be *so* understanding of how this part of the mind works, he answered a question I didn't even know enough to ask. And it turned out to make a huge difference in my quality of life.

The opening section is a 1-5-scale response to statements and questions Dr. Burns poses, ie: ""Rate how true a statement is from one being the least and five the most true."" - ""I get upset when people don't remember my first name."" And from *that* exercise of  (I forget how many) questions, Burns explains what *that* all adds up to, and you move forward.
