Both before and after the uppercut has Lifted you off of the ground. Instead of an instant uppercut before and doing nothing for three seconds, the animation takes the entire .5 seconds. Similar to how they slowed down his punch. Doom is no worse than other brainless heroes like brig reaper mei etc."
Competitiveoverwatch,fe4a4w8,t1_fe47rfc,1578857249.0,"If they really want to nerf his uppercut but not make him feel clunky, keep the .5 second recovery time but make the animation fit it. Right now the animation is .2 seconds which leaves him in the air for .3 seconds stunned. Make the animation take .5 seconds. That way it feels smooth but he’s still more vulnerable during that time.

Competitiveoverwatch,fe0byi8,t1_fdzteox,1578809195.0,"First part, technically yes but I get your point. Second part where Ana is coming out of spawn, if the Ana was using fucking headphones, they’d heard a loud ass doomfist slamming towards them. He’s super easy to sleep during and after slam so the Ana just fucked up there. A super impactful nerf to doomfist would to increase the sound on his abilities and make his ult easier to track. He doesn’t need a straight damage or range nerf. Also just because he’s “meta” doesn’t mean “nerf him into unplayability.” Like they have in the past. As soon as something else becomes meta, people are just going to bitch super hard about that character being “OP” just like mei doom hanzo Orisa etc. at some point, the meta will shift and they won’t be the best picks EVEN IF NOTHING ABOUT THEM IS CHANGED. And then people will stop complaining about them and start complaining about something else. Sombra is a perfect example. She’s been buffed a few times and changed a few times and no one is bitching BECAUSE SHES NOT META. When she becomes meta even if she’s exactly the same, people WILL begin to bitch about her, same as they do with mei right now."

Competitiveoverwatch,fdzk7ca,t1_fdziq1c,1578790979.0,See that would kill him and make him dogshit. His punch has already been nerfed as well as his shields. I think he needs something like a damage nerf to his slam or uppercut. His punch isn’t usually used as a oneshot kill. It’s pretty hard to do at mid to High ranks because people are ready for it
