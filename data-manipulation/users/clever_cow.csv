Conservative,fgl1ze8,t1_fgkv7qp,1580879535.0,I’m proud to be an American too and have nothing against Trump but his elocution is pretty poor.
college,fgk2j1w,t1_fgjuqii,1580856147.0,"Software engineer is kind of a fast and loose term applied to anything from web developer to safety critical robotic control systems engineer.

One of those requires a degree, typically in engineering, CS or an advanced physics or math degree. 

Yes the skills are more important than the degree, but the degree is still important. Maybe in the 1980s you could get hired as an engineer with no degree, but these days you’re not going to be developing any real products without that piece of paper."

1492, 1776, 3/5..."
college,fgjtcmn,t1_fgjeh37,1580851003.0,"Eh? You do need an engineering degree to do engineering. Unless you want to be a “Tire and Oil change Engineer” at Jiffy Lube.

Libertarian,fgjge1j,t1_fgjbo7t,1580843491.0,I never said I was pro Republican spending. And every Democrat that has been elected hasn’t proposed as large spending plans as Bernie has.
Libertarian,fgjbhl4,t1_fgja9x0,1580840638.0,"That’s the thing. There’s no way of knowing the tax hikes will actually have real benefits to anyone. His plans aren’t well thought out so I have little faith that they will. They’re unrealistic and will probably hurt the economy and everyone’s retirement accounts in addition to getting a lot of people to lose their jobs.

That’s if he’s actually able to accomplish anything as grandiose as what he has planned... the reality is probably that he will make only be able to make small incremental changes that end up costing more in taxes with little or no benefit to anyone (see ACA). Then they’ll call it a victory and providing he doesn’t die of old age by 2024 he’ll get re-elected.

Republicans aren’t much better, but they don’t just flout multi trillion dollar government spending plans like they’re candy and propose the worst tax plans for the economy the USA has ever seen."
Libertarian,fgja71f,t1_fghkle0,1580840037.0,Yes and we should vote for Bernie because of his fiscal responsibility?
college,fgiylls,t3_eyqyfc,1580833610.0,"Those type of people aren’t very smart.

The actually smart STEM majors have a healthy appreciation of literature, the arts, etc.

Some people get a sour taste of the soft sciences in their mouth after doing Intro to Sociology or other similar bullshit humanities courses without diving deep into it and think that’s all those subjects have to offer."
Libertarian,fghiwjr,t1_fgh7yyr,1580785837.0,I’m all for restructuring how tax dollars get spent. Until that gets done though I am 100% against giving extra money to the government.
Libertarian,fgh7t06,t1_fggy6e0,1580778703.0,Speak for yourself. I’d rather spend money I earn on making a better life for myself and my family rather than throwing it away in a bottomless pit of government welfare.
Libertarian,fggy2iq,t1_fggu28d,1580772148.0,"The older, and wealthier, the voter gets, the less interested they are in Sanders."
Libertarian,fggjvgo,t1_fgggnmt,1580763388.0,The people that are voting for Bernie don’t have 401K’s
PoliticalHumor,fgga4xz,t3_ey7djv,1580757530.0,This was one of the first stories I saw that made me question the mainstream media on Donald Trump. Politifact should rate it misleading or false.
fakehistoryporn,fgemfbd,t1_fgekjei,1580703197.0,"I don’t understand how you can get that he was a nihilist from reading Nietzsche.

If his work were a self help book it would be entitled, “How to Avoid Being a Nihilist After Realizing Christianity is Bullshit”"

Libertarian,fgehrz5,t1_fge6h2g,1580699801.0,I think you forget who the other candidate was in 2016 or something. She had just as many obvious lies and horrible scandals.
nasa,fge1xej,t1_fgdlc0r,1580689656.0,You can tell cause of the way that it is
Libertarian,fgdqd7c,t1_fgckg3f,1580685444.0,I believe none of that. That’s called a non sequitur.
Libertarian,fgb2d3g,t1_fgaz340,1580657802.0,The average politician has done way more questionable shit than Trump has.

PublicFreakout,fg9rty0,t1_fg9liuj,1580642417.0,"No one has to be okay with it, it’s just how the world works. If you want a democratic republic and not brutal dictators to be in control."
ComputerEngineering,fg78mfu,t3_exa1xr,1580586562.0,"With your experience and GPA I’d expect at least 70K in a low-ish cost of living area or 80K+ in a medium high cost of living area like Portland.

If you get more than one offer and the difference is a couple thousand dollars between positions don’t sweat it just go with the one you like best obviously."
dataisbeautiful,fg6u71t,t3_ex6p69,1580576967.0,Goode’s map just cuts out Greenland lol
politics,fg6da8z,t1_fg54i5z,1580564456.0,Aren’t Trump’s approval ratings higher than before the impeachment though? This whole thing backfired horribly and I don’t see how this is bad for the Republican Party at all.
LateStageCapitalism,fg4gc49,t1_fg4dub8,1580502841.0,Move out of California.
interestingasfuck,fg4eiq0,t1_fg4e20m,1580501975.0,Yeah they checked the brain cameras and confirmed before writing the software

slowcooking,ffyu320,t1_ffytiyp,1580355158.0,I mean even if it’s staged it gave me a laugh.
