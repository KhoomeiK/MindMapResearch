NewGirl,ffxnyqh,t3_evpdd9,1580328990.0,"I don't know about that... I mean, they did the thing with him getting the job in England. They had a few episodes showing Jess struggling with the long distance (falling asleep in the hallway on the phone), them crossing each other over the Atlantic and ending up in each others' countries, and then him not making it out for her dad's wedding seemed like it was the straw that broke the camel's back, and made them finally realize it wasn't working. I guess maybe it just feels weird because we don't *see* him again - but that's because he's off in England. 

I think in terms of Jess' story arc it works because it shows her trying *all kinds* of relationships, including a long-distance one, and how in the end nothing works for her except Nick Miller."

It’s not unfathomable how men can be attracted to teens - I’m a woman but I imagine they’re kind of hardwired to be aren’t they? I think that’s a big difference compared to pre-pubescent children. Not advocating for acting on it, of course.  But it does seem like calling someone who likes teens a pedophile is like calling someone who punches people a murderer. It’s just not the same thing. I’m just talking semantics; seems odd to me that they’re all lumped together."
