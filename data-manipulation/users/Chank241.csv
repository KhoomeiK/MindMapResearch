gtaonline,ffiqf75,t1_ffiqcm8,1579980133.0,You can only own one bunker at a time unfortunately. You have to buy upgrades again as well.
gtaonline,ffipons,t1_ffipkgf,1579979617.0,I just purchased the farmhouse bunker. No regrets.
gtaonline,ffipeaf,t1_ffipc0l,1579979414.0,Not even tree fity?
RedDeadOnline,fffyem9,t3_etaw0s,1579894518.0,No body fucking helped me.
PS5,fff5ay6,t1_ffcyos7,1579876072.0,I always eject my disk using the options menu.
politics,ffdfdo1,t1_ffdepmi,1579819717.0,That's why I never get into politics with any of my friends/co-workers/girlfriend. I don't really follow political shit because it just blows my damn mind how something simple can become so complicated and convoluted that it just doesn't even make sense anymore.
politics,ffdexwn,t1_ffdeob5,1579819451.0,Damn shame. I wish I could meet someone who watches Fox news and believes it. Can't imagine how that kind of person would act.
politics,ffdefvo,t1_ffddrfv,1579819150.0,I hope so too. This is pure propaganda and just prays on the weak minded to reach their agenda. It's absolutely unacceptable. You can't call yourself a news broadcast when all you broadcast is damn lies.
gtaonline,ffd55hr,t3_estz68,1579813620.0,"Yes. This would be great. I keep saying they should at least show us how long we have untill our next spin. Like ""You can spin the wheel again in XX:XX."""
aww,ffcsr4r,t1_ffc4ktm,1579806503.0,Use the repost bot dummy.
pan,ffcslji,t3_esge48,1579806411.0,Just leave that shit on FFS.
AskReddit,ffcs1ug,t3_est2b4,1579806086.0,Shit.
politics,ffcrpk9,t3_esunnk,1579805883.0,Who fucking watches Fox news? I just watched those clips and my brain fucking melted. They will literally just lie and direct people in the wrong direction? Sounds like a cult.
PS4Pro,ffckeu1,t3_eshtea,1579801337.0,Burnout Paradise actually looks great on the Pro.
WinStupidPrizes,ffalkuo,t3_er5g6a,1579738792.0,Dude sounds like a chipmunk at the end.
WinStupidPrizes,ffajd71,t1_ffaj989,1579737174.0,Brad.
WinStupidPrizes,ff9tzem,t3_ern1eb,1579721249.0,Lit him up like a Christmas tree. What an idiot.
WinStupidPrizes,ff9tf1i,t1_ff62pt0,1579720869.0,Rule 1 on putting a fire out:  Don't fucking blow on it.
WinStupidPrizes,ff9ta2y,t3_esg4en,1579720782.0,His name would be Chad.
gtaonline,ff9qpll,t1_ff9qofx,1579718896.0,That sounds a little better.
aww,ff9b7ud,t1_ff8xsx5,1579709000.0,r/ihadastroke
gtaonline,ff8sgfk,t1_ff8mvkj,1579694323.0,Naw they will probably just continue to call it GTA Online. Or something different all together. GTA online 2 doesn't really sound good.
gtaonline,ff7b2q7,t1_ff75xa1,1579645161.0,Right. They still haven't learned that you have to work hard to get something you want. Mommy still buys everything.
gtaonline,ff7027w,t1_ff6zv9k,1579638416.0,"Yep, and knowing your way around the inside of the casino."
gtaonline,ff6ynml,t1_ff6ygl4,1579637592.0,The fools I was doing it with couldn't find their way out of a wet paper bag. Literally yelling at them to follow me and they just walk out infront of guards and get wasted. Over and over again.
gtaonline,ff6xq0x,t1_ff6wozm,1579637046.0,Well on the way out if you don't do it right you have to go loud and we went loud Everytime
gtaonline,ff6dv3i,t3_ertpj3,1579625052.0,I tried to do the heist for some random low levels. It was the big con. So pretty easy. Told them we should get through it no problem.  Quickly found out he did not do most of the prep missions. Mostly found out when I noticed the dougen guards were absolute tanks. I asked him if he even tried to destroy any shipments and he had no idea what I was talking about. Gave them 2 more good tries and then told them to hit me up when you get all the preps done.  This heist is easy as hell if you do all the preps.
PS5,ff65qz2,t1_ff4g9cp,1579619788.0,I love the assumption here. Anything can happen. They could launch the bitch with tons of games. I don't think they would come out with a new console and not have any games. That would be a terrible business move.
PS5,ff5z9e7,t3_erkgku,1579614970.0,I feel like after 3 system launches they should have most of the launch bugs ironed out. I've never bought a console on launch but I think I may be getting this one.
gtaonline,ff4cvkm,t1_ff390m3,1579560626.0,"Fucking helping people. Half the noobs I ever helped are ungrateful as fuck and just want you to keep giving them that easy money. It's never enough, some people get way to greedy."
GTASA,ff3fref,t1_ff2ob69,1579540142.0,Only way I know is chrome cast or something like that for andriod
simracing,ff1eaim,t3_equz6i,1579478097.0,Don't spill your beer when you shift.
gtaonline,feyk9iw,t3_eqqkbb,1579446633.0,I used to solo lobby all the time to do cargo and mc stuff. Started just joining random servers now. I get a little thrill know anyone of these 20+ players could blow my shit up. Let's just say I've gotten real good at asserting my dominance on a server. I don't fuck with anyone but if you throw the first shot. I hate it for you.
gtaonline,feyjrhw,t3_equfjj,1579446450.0,Pretty sure this a just a spin in a repost. Which makes it a repost.
PS4Pro,feyjceb,t1_feyg95w,1579446243.0,"Maybe you accidently crossed a wire or bent something while cleaning? The only problem I've had was the console had a faulty heat sensor and would shut the console down every 1 to 2 hours. Sent it in and sony fixed it under warranty for free.

Edit: I think you void the warranty when you open the console."
