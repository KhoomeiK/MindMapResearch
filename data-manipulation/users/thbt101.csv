But on the crypto side, it takes a lot of technical and business understanding to know the difference between all the sketchy schemes, very high risk investments (Bitcoin), and actual secure investments.  A lot of people do end up dismissing it all as sketchy, but there are well secured actual investments that don't fluctuate in value with the advent of stable coins. But it's a high barrier of entry to understand it enough not to immediately dismiss it as sketchy. Some of the market is returning to the point where there are major well-established companies creating opportunities that are licensed and insured and nothing like the much higher risk of a lot of what goes on in cryptocurrencies.

But most people have no idea what any of that means and it takes a lot of learning to understand the steps and understand it enough to feel secure with how it all works. 

Another example is private lending securred by real estate deeds which can earn 10-14% with far less risk than the stock market.  Or passive real estate investing in syndicated deals. Or turnkey residential real estate.  Or buying notes securred by real estate or judicial judgments.

Why would that be the case?  If you happen to be at 50% leverage because you've been paying it off over time, your monthly mortgage bill is still the same amount regardless of your leverage percent.  Or maybe I'm not understanding the scenario you're describing."
realestateinvesting,fdj9eeu,t1_fdhlrjp,1578462276.0,"Sure, 30-50% leverage is a fine goal.  But specifically what you want ideally is 30% (or whatever) of your properties to be completely paid off.  The kind of sucky situation to be in is to have a bunch of properties where each one is 30-50% paid off, because then you're still paying a mortgage on every property.  So you aren't benefiting from that big jump in cash flow that happens when no longer have a mortgage to pay on a property.  (I'm assuming you aren't doing a lot of refinancing... if you do a refi of a property, that can also change your cash flow because it can change your mortgage payment terms.)

Another way to look at it is having a mortgage that's 50%, or 90%, paid-off doesn't really benefit your immediate financial situation at all.  But when you hit 100% paid-off, there is a an immediate and significant difference that happens because there's suddenly no more mortgage payment."

When I first realized that equity just sitting in a house isn't making money and it's a missed opportunity, that was a revelation.  I was passing up an opportunity to buy more rental properties by refinancing and ""taking cash out"" of it.  So I did that and bought more properties.

But then years later I eventually had a second revelation that having a small number of paid off properties would be far easier to deal with than a large number of highly leveraged ones since you get the same cash flow but with much less hassle.  So I stopped feeling like equity in a house was a bad thing (and stopped obsessing over ROI) and started working towards the goal of just having a small number of paid off properties instead because that would be even better.

And I think both of those goals were exactly the right choices to make at those different stages of my life/finances."
realestateinvesting,fdj7q43,t1_fdhpb1c,1578460821.0,"I've heard that point made before, but I think it's only a ""risk"" if you don't have the emergency funds available to cover the expense when the vacancy occurs.

For example, lets assume that vacancy is 10% regardless of whether you have 1 unit or 10.  The long term result mathematically should work out the same over the long term.  The only difference is when your 1 unit has a month of vacancy, you notice it because you have a month of no income and a mortgage that you still have to pay so you better have the cash on hand to cover it.  But the other 11 months of the year are ""100% occupied"".  If you have 10 units, you may always have an average of 1 unit vacant, so you don't notice it as much, but mathematically the long term result is the same.

Another side point, in some areas (like here in Austin), if your price is low you can have close to 0% vacancy (we pretty much always have the new tenant ready to move in within a couple days of the last tenant moving out)."

As much as I would rather keep all of the $140k, I would be ok with the $112k if that was enough to perhaps pay off the balance on another property (and result in higher cash flow once that other one is mortgage free, with less properties to deal with).

There are probably a dozen times at this point that I have had lawyers, realtors, CPAs, plumbers, etc. realize that they had incorrect information after I did my own research on Reddit and other websites about a topic that I had been seeking their advice on.   About half the time it turns out the advice from Reddit was wrong, but about half the time it turns out the ""professional"" was wrong.

""Professionals"" are not infallible and are very often wrong or have incomplete knowledge and blindly following their advice is often a mistake.  The OP probably learned a lot and gained some new ideas from the responses here and they did the right thing by asking for more ideas and input.

On Reddit you may get a mix of right and wrong answers, but there's a good chance you'll learn a lot about ideas that you and your lawyer may not have considered.  If nothing else, it's a good way to find good questions to ask your professional to see if there are things they didn't know or didn't consider and to see if they're really leading you in the right direction.It's pointless when someone gets tons of useful advice from a Reddit question, and then there are some comments telling them they shouldn't have asked the question and they should should ask a professional and just trust whatever they say and don't seek any outside advice.

One thing I want to comment on is ""Shiller P/E also doesn't pay attention to competition from other investment types, especially bond rates.""  Well sure, it's true that it doesn't consider that, but it's not supposed to explain the ""why"", it just tells us that stocks are overvalued, regardless of the reason.  You're saying is that stock prices are high partly because people can't find anything better to put their money in.  Well ok that may be true, but that doesn't change the fact that the end result is they're way over priced (and therefore more likely to eventually tumble back down to a much lower low).

I'm not necessarily saying people should pull all their IRA money out of the stock market if they're not planning to retire anytime soon.  But I see posts from people saying things like ""I just inherited $xxx,xxx dollars, what should I do with it"" and people recommend putting it all the stock market all at once right now (""just put it all in a Vanguard equity index fund"").  I just don't think that's likely to be the right choice at a time when there are major warning signs flashing danger ahead.  I would be recommending very slowly dollar cost averaging right now, and if you have a mortgage you could pay off or anything else to invest in, seriously consider alternatives, and keep a significant chunk of it in something lower risk even if the interest rates and safe investment returns are small.  Because it sure looks like stocks are the most overvalued they've ever been right now, and that seems to indicate that the drop to the bottom, or even just to normal price ratios, could be severe."

Each time the PE has been close to this high, it eventually came back down with a major drop in stock prices.

laravel,fdd3mqx,t3_ekoq22,1578293414.0,"I don't. Personal I believe that you can write better code if you write the test after rather than before. I think there are two reasons for that. 

First, writing the tests first has a tendency to make people just code to the tests. The problem with that is it tends to make people focus just on passing the test and not think about all the other aspects of what makes good code good. I think it makes people less likely to read through their code and evaluate themselves whether it will work. They just assume it's okay because it passed the tests. But in reality bugs most often happen in scenarios that you hadn't thought of so you hadn't thought of and the tests may not cover those situations. And writing the tests first May 10 to encourage people to write code that is more easily ""testable"" but not necessarily a better design. 

The second reason is that it takes more time to write the tests and then code to it so by the time you reach the point of writing the code developers may be less likely to be open to the possibility that they need to scrap their solution or rethink it when issues with it arise because they've already sunk time into writing the tests as well as the code.

But when advantage of writing the test versus it doesn't encourage you to think about the final result in detail before you start the coding. But I think that can be accomplished by planning the results without necessarily actually writing tests. 

I think it just makes more sense to do it the logical way and write the code first and then test it."
