>Almost no reporting on plight of Muslims fleeing East Pakistan due to persecution by Indian Muslim press. There was some reporting by Patna daily Sangam about the plight of **""Bihari Muslims"" (non Bengali Muslims) who had gone to East Pakistan after 1947 partition and then fled back to India due to violent retribution by Mukti Bahini and Bengalis.**

The reason their mention was avoided was because they were contributors to the West Pakistan effort, and the Muslim press did not want to draw attention to them while they came in as ""poor refugees"".

These Bihari Muslims were entirely pro (West) pakistan and routinely joined with Pakistani army on their rape and kill missions. Interestingly, the favorite target of Bihari muslims were Hindu areas and townships. When the war ended, Pakistan said fuck you, we don't want you and left them in Bangladesh.
