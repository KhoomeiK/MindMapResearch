Because abs are postural muscles it's perfectly fine to work them everyday or 5/6 days a week as long as you don't go too intense.

Better safe than sorry would make sense maybe, but yours is just definitely stating its wrong so it's not quite the same"
The10thDentist,fdikrp3,t1_fdhyb0b,1578445099.0,"I mean seeing as trying to find a fat mate would be disadvantageous evolutionarily it kinda does make sense to classify it that way, same with specifically being really attracted to fat men.

Although I suppose the definition of fetish is more about a sexual desire to an usual degree"

Metal,fdhml97,t1_fdh6b5x,1578425842.0,"I was sad it was so far down too, not enough techdeath representation on the list imo, it's interesting to see the bands liked by this sub though, not what I would've immediately guessed. 

equipoise was amazing too, listened to that album so much this year"

funny,fdf624f,t1_fdeytzq,1578354135.0,"I mean I get your point but it also doesn't really apply all that much to the mcu because its all one big overarching plot that they've been planning in advance, it's all a story which interlinks, rather than just pointless sequels because they can't think of anything original. Each film has a unique plot and story"
manga,fdee1me,t1_fdedtzm,1578336987.0,"I don't have one and don't know much about them so never really crossed my mind, thought the UK would be fine and not censor it. If not I'm willing to try it out if there's a decent free vpn?"
