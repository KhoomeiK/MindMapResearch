CollegeBasketball,fc912ib,t1_fc900vs,1577545312.0,Yes! That’s what I’m talking about! Let Snoop shoot money at them IRL if he wants.
CollegeBasketball,fc90u7d,t1_fc8y6dq,1577545206.0,"Good! They should be using the money for other sports and around the campus! If it all went back to basketball that would be terrible. I’m just saying it would be nice to see them make some actual money, even off their likeness. Who’s ass do I have to kiss to get another NCAA football and basketball game."
CollegeBasketball,fc8x078,t1_fc8uvii,1577543418.0,"No I had no idea they had to pay a water bill! Wow!  University of Dayton is also recognized as a 501(c)(3) by the government for being a religious institution and are tax exempt. I’m sure they’re making enough money to give a couple more nickels to some kids.

Edit: Dayton University to University of Dayton"
CollegeBasketball,fc8u3lu,t1_fc8q41g,1577541986.0,"University of Dayton Arena has 13,435 seats. Just checked the cheapest nosebleed seats are 35$ so if every seat was that price they would make $470,225 for one night. They have 9 more home games the next 3 months which gives $4,232,025. 3 months X 2,000$ = $6,000. 6,000 is 0.14 percent of 4,232,025. That’s based on cheapest possible ticket prices and doesn’t include sales from merch. Yea you’re right, they deserve to get almost none of the revenue, since they aren’t the reason the university is making money by the bucketload."
CollegeBasketball,fc8ncxn,t3_egmkzk,1577538445.0,Too bad those kids don’t get a piece of that revenue.
