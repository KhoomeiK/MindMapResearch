You put down a layer of salt in a baking dish or Tupper ware (nothing metal), then sort of push the meat down into the salt. I go meat side down with the fat on top (I also cut a few slits in the fat/skin to let more salt in through the top). Sprinkle more salt on top so that most of the breast is contacting the salt. This sits in the fridge for a day and draws a lot of liquid out if the meat. 

Pat them dry and add your curing spices. You can add whatever you want. Traditional prosciutto usually calls for white pepper, but I bulk buy ground black pepper because I use a ton of it. The key to my approach is that I just want a little kick of spice without distracting from the rich cured meat flavor. Paprika is a staple for every new meat project I try out, and it worked well for a one week cured duck breast. For a 2+ week cure, the meat itself develops such an amazing flavor that it stands alone.

I wrap them in cheese cloth and hang dry them for 2 weeks (my preferred sweet spot of good flavor without being too dry). I use a deli slicer to get them super thin for serving as they are very salty. I've been plating them with a blueberry Stilton cheese, honey, and candied ginger, which are each good pairings.

A side note for specialty salts: most cured meats call for ""pink curing salt"" aka ""Prague powder"" but I've never used it in this recipe. The downside is that this recipe requires much more salt than most recipes using Prague powder. Prague powder is super cheap and goes a long way, while keeping meat pink and tasty looking (not necessary for duck). It's not to be confused with that Himalayan pink salt.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,fcnentx,t3_ei43pw,1577810158.0,"If your DAW has something equivalent to subprojects, you can still easily tweak each individual element if you need to, while decluttering your workspace. Subprojects appear in your main project as a rendered audio file that you can then mix and add effects to as a whole. Within the subproject, you still have all of the individual items which you can adjust; saving the subproject re-renders the audio file in your project.

I'll focus on making the whole drum section sound natural by itself, hit the broad brush strokes of mixing it with the rest of the instruments, then move it all to a subproject. I tend not to spend hours over-tweaking each teeny tiny detail dozens of times over, so opening, adjusting, and saving/rendering the subproject really isn't an inconvenience to me at this stage. 

It's worth playing around with and determining for yourself whether or not you find this inconvenient, and whether or not you enjoy looking at a less busy workspace."
