SanJoseSharks,ffi94uv,t1_ffhfwza,1579968275.0,"Right. The years you alluded to are all major major misses. 

Shit man, I remember when we were getting guys like Kaspar or even Goldobin more recently when there were still really strong like top 3/2 talent out there. 

Also, Merkely is going to be an interesting one. He definitely breaks the mold a little with DW getting a guy with reported off ice issues, but also talented. I really hope he pans out and keeps the post 2015 stretch respectable."

I am not sure if it's my favorite but it definitely shows that James Cameron is a fucking master. I mean, quality not quantity with this guy. Ridley Scott likely has more grade A films as he produces a ton, but he also has stinkers. The worst Cameron has done is Avatar and even that was at least a spectacle of unmatched proportions when it dropped."
movies,ffhdeml,t1_ex29cix,1579930768.0,Just streamed it. Wasn't aware there are two versions.

SanJoseSharks,ffgxpbd,t1_ffgo46q,1579917738.0,"Right. Even in years we came away with a solid guy there was generally a better option on the board. I do think we've improved in the last 5 or so seasons but it's still dicey, especially for north american players."

SanJoseSharks,ffe6e7w,t3_esxbvh,1579837914.0,"I feel like given the longevity it may be worth to take a stab with someone else. Not saying Wilson has been terrible. In fact he has been very solidly above average and has pulled off a couple fleece jobs that will be talked about for ages. But he hasn't taken the team where we need to go and he has seemed to focus on the past formulas for victory rather than charting a clear path of his own that will get it done. 

I do think that even should he stay we absolutely need a stronger head coach to continue to work with DW on a new generation's vision for the team. 

Also, we really need to address the drafting and scouting department in North America. I realize we often go in half loaded but we've also had quite a few misses during Wilson's tenure, especially in the 1st round. It has gotten better and a part of that is strong Euro scouting coming up (Hertl/Meier) but outside of Couture I can't recall another top round pick to make an impact since maybe Pickles back in like 2005."

He had a really good season that first year but then continued to fall off. And for the amazing sniping ability we were all expecting he largely ended up playing a bet front presence type role. 

Not a terrible move by any stretch but he was also not what I was expecting or the type of 50 goal guy I think we were mostly hoping for."

SanJoseSharks,fezn2dr,t1_fex0siq,1579459202.0,"I mean, I take an in between approach. I think they care and did want to compete this season for their own cup (and to get Jumbo there). However with Couture going down and the continual shit goaltending I think they have now just hit the point where there's really no more hope from the room that they can compete. 

It's shitty to see with 3 more months to go. And I do agree at this point that the guys making money are likely thinking it's better to just reign in and not get injured. 

Entering this season without addressing either the spotty goal tending or the major gaps opened up by letting Pavs, Donskoi and Nyquist walk was such a terrible choice from Wilson (I get Donskoi and Nyquist weren't stellar last season - but those were effectively contributors on the 3 top lines that we simply had 0 feasible plan to replace). 

I am morose."
Tempe,fezlsjc,t3_er00mj,1579458757.0,"I was in a house not apartment, so expect my numbers to be inflated for larger space, but to give you an idea we were paying - 

~$50-90 electricity between Oct-March
~$150-250 electricity between Apr-Sep (one house we were in would go up to about 300 for June-Aug). 

The utilities offer a program to stabilize your bill. Basically you pay over during the cool months and then build credit to help lower your bill during summer. We never did this but if you are concerned with the spike in cost it's a decent option. 

Water is cheap. You will likely not pay much more than 20-40 bucks being in an apartment. And that should include sewage/trash. Depends on how the apartment complex charges.

In our house with a lawn and other plants on drip I think we averaged around $75-80 just to give some perspective. Even in summer we didn't go too high over this.

Edit: my house was 1500 sq/ft - so not super big. It did have really good insulation and windows though. The prior home (which would get up to $300) was 1700 sq/ft and was much less insulated. Just something to consider if the building is older or newer."

I think the challenge is we feel like we need to go in there with our guard super up. And in general if you just know what you want and show the dealer you know their brand the experience will be much smoother. 

An alternate brand I almost went with was also similar. Guy knew I wanted the higher model and did a ton to get me into it. Was just my own needs that weren't met in the car that caused me to walk. And I appreciate that he hasn't blown my phone up after the fact."

funny,fekvc94,t1_fekk8i4,1579208358.0,"We need true reforms and funding for our K-12 system to ensure all kids both have a chance to excel in university and also have a foundation for solid success / civic engagement if they choose to not go into university. 

We need a more realistic approach to evaluating and fostering talent in our students - and leaving trade schools as a truly viable opportunity if a student is inclined. 

And we absolutely need reforms to address the debt one incurs if you go to university. Sure a doctor or maybe a lawyer (though less these days) can earn back their 100K+ debt incurred. But there are so many professions that require a benefit from college educated employees and simply do not offer the ability to pay off those loan debts in a reasonable time. We need to figure out a way to get back to the actual intent of the public university system - world class education with minimal cost to the students.

Frankly I think this country needs to reconsider it's willingness to be taxed and also it's boner for being the world's army. The above shouldn't be seen as some radical and non-practical math problem that cannot be solved. Other nations do it and we also have a massive economy which attracts skilled workers.

hockey,fdpg7ss,t3_eme1lf,1578627806.0,He goes down like this and or flops around so often. I fucking hated his tenure with the Sharks.
AskReddit,fdp7lpj,t1_fdp4k2i,1578621872.0,"My opinion is it was a mixed bag and likely a lot of people that had been engaged just felt dejected and then didn't vote (more than vote for Trump). And in some of those swing states the Bernie message resonated a lot harder than Clinto, so not showing up could have cost it just as much as swapping party."
WTF,fdoy6df,t3_emew3w,1578615570.0,Is this not how Dario Argento's 'Inferno' began?
worldnews,fdm80ie,t3_elu9pz,1578542071.0,We are legitimately in 1984. Both sides get propoganda victories and move on. Fucking ridiculous.

Ijustwatched,fdj1a4h,t3_eln6d3,1578455879.0,"I think the ending is that the Overlook has a sordid history and active ability to snag people into its demonic possession. So in the end he was simply added to the cadre of those that fell before to the hotel. 

Agree the atmosphere and cinematography is what really shines. The color pallet is amazing and is one of those films that makes you long for the days prior to post production saturation."

It's also our domestic economic stimulus package. 

It's a travesty, all around."
