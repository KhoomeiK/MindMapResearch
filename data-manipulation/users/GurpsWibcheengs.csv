DestinyTheGame,fgfk4j0,t3_ey47x3,1580740919.0,"The seasons model is trash. Straight up. It's built around FOMO and that shit needs to go. It's not working. 



The DLC model wasn't *flawless* as nothing is, but with the DLC model I could run through the content at whatever pace I wanted without missing anything, then take a break and play other games. I'm sure there is a workaround for the content drought issues with the DLC model, but smaller droughts can be a good thing because they make you take a break and do other things - and here's the good part: taking a break during the DLC model doesn't mean you miss a bunch of shit you can no longer play or acquire.



As it is now, we are renting content. It's that simple. You pay for a season and you get temporary content that goes away and gear that you can't get after the season - unless of course you buy the rest of the levels in the 3rd month. Bungie complained that the DLC model was not sustainable because it took so much effort to put out meaty, quality content each major release, yet now they're literally making shit to be thrown away - and it's not even that great. 


If you want me to believe the stuff goes away ""because it takes up too much memory on the game install"" that's horse shit. The *only* reason content goes away in the seasons model is to generate FOMO. That's it. You won't convince me otherwise. I'm honestly starting to think Bungie's strategy now is to convert the game/franchise as a whole into another cookie cutter megatransactions-ridden dump to fund their next IP with their new China friends. Make the game free to bring in the freemium crowd who bring with them the ""game is free so I don't have a problem with loot boxes"" argument because they'll buy more shit from EverCurse, cut their losses and let all us vets who have been around since D1 alpha abandon ship. They won't get a $45 finisher pack out of us so why not?


It's blatantly obvious that way too much effort is being wasted on EverCurse instead of real content and there is nothing to show for it. Sure, one ornament funded the whole zero hour mission, but scale that up to how much stuff is in EverCurse now and compare it to the content we are getting, and sure as shit, it doesn't add up. I'm starting to get heavily burned on destiny now because of the direction it's going. Bungie saw every other game using seasons and just decided it will work perfectly here. I got the collectors edition of Shadowkeep and it came with the season pass, but I won't get another season pass. Not for rented, cheap throwaway content. Destiny will fade fast if something isn't done about the season FOMO shit and everbad. There has to be some kind of compromise because this shit ain't working."
