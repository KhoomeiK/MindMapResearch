Missing411,fesw2io,t1_fessrtu,1579369611.0,That is in mo way what I said and to derive that from what I wrote tells me a lot about your level of comprehension. Its like arguing w a fencepost. Why bother?
Missing411,fesnm3r,t1_fer4t8w,1579367150.0,"Wow. This is incredibly wrongheaded on so many points. 

There is something called chain of custody. Imagine finding a body in the woods. A big gang of Missing 411 people tramp all over the forest surrounding the body. Find evidence. Pick it up and take it to the cops. BECAUSE HELPFUL. 

You have destroyed evidence, the chain of command, and if that piece of evidence would have linked to a perpetrator, that link has been totally obliterated and you don't win your case. 
People don't stay missing because goons aren't out there stomping all over evidence. That is the most incredible pile of crap I have ever heard. People go missing for a wide variety of reasons. 

I also don't know where you get this idea that perpetrators get caught because ""they know they are being looked for"".....seems you think all perps all act the same. Some murders adore the attention, they court it. Some don't. Some like toying with the police and collecting all the articles about themselves. Some don't even pay attention. ""Shouldn't matter how the perp is found as long as they are found....."" Do you know how many cases are lost on technicalities? This isn't the wild west. Again, chain of command. Follow procedures. 

Also, most LE do NOT go to law school. But they ARE trained in proper evidence handling. I am not LE but took many classes in criminal justice and crime scene investigation. I am also a certified fingerprint analyst. You are the perfect example of why people need training, and amateurs wanting to help can often hurt the very case they want to solve by not following proper procedures."

I 100 percent promise you nothing will change. Being in a relationship with a narcissist is not like a normal relationship.  You won't get a friendly goodbye, a hug, an ""I'm sorry I wish you the best"" etc. If he were like that, he wouldn't be a narcissist.  

What they deal in is POWER. over YOU. love is just a cover for their real intentions. 

Closure will happen when you realize who you are dealing with. Your feelings don't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Its just a transaction to get more power.

I think he DID kill himself.

Fool was a small-dick-having user of little girls. That's not a tough guy. He had soft hands, he was a fucking billionare, he knew he would get raped in prison, that he would not be able to handle it. People turning this into a conspiracy theory as if Epstein would have WANTED to live through a slow-motion downfall. He had his OWN ISLAND people. And here he was in a cell, looking bleakly towards a future of being someone ELSE""s bitch for a change. He would not have lived through it. He was a coward. It makes all the sense in the world that he killed himself. Not being properly guarded might have been due to the guards already knowing that this guy would have escaped justice one way or another, so let him kill himself.

The part where Henry Lee Lucas is crying and Otis is comforting him really just blew my mind.

There was this one section of the trail that absolutely struck me cold. Now, I go hiking a lot and I hate to have people go with me. I prefer to be out there alone. I am not the sort who is gonna make up shit in my mind. I believe in the paranormal but I also believe that most of the shit that happens to people has an explanation, and I loathe it when people think every single light in the sky they can't explain is a UFO or every sound a ghost. Its a time waster, people. FOCUS ON THE GENUINELY WEIRD or else you are just being a crackpot. So I don't get psyched out easily. 

But this was just instantly suffocating. I mean, I wanted to run. Its just a short job along this trail but man, it was so real, like a dark cloud you passed through. The trail is the least visited in the whole park because to get up it is difficult- its very, very steep and you won't meet many people if anyone on that trail. That's why I liked it. 

SO I take my boyfriend at the time on the trail. I say, ""there is a really strange part of the trail but I am not gonna tell you which part. You just tell me when you feel really strange."" Its a few miles. As soon as we rounded the bend to this weird part of the trail he too stopped cold and said, ""holy shit. Its this"". He was right."
