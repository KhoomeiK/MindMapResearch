horror,fdzr5we,t1_fdzixxy,1578793902.0,"And also you can add to that that, women when victimized often get an extra ""tax"".

Something I learned in lawschool and seeing cases while working for a district attorney, for example: men get mugged and beat up and thats it, women get mugged, beat up and in many cases sexually assaulted. This isn't even feminism or anything, just what happens in reality. 

That extra danger they're in imo gives these heroines an extra quota of courage while facing some degenerate serial killer or whatever the movie is about."
horror,fdz8l2l,t3_end8de,1578787732.0,"I think one of the reasons the heroines in horror movies are so badass, is because they're actually writen like women.

Now hear me out, Im not trying to be sexist, but its quite obvious that women are generally at a physical disadvantage. In action movies, this disadvantage is mostly ignored, and women are just writen like male action heroes, kicking all sort of ass (which is not bad, nothing wrong with either male or female power fantasies) While on horror, they use said disadvantage to make the character more vulnerable, as to make the movie scarier. So it's much more heroic when they finally stand up to some towering monster."
