HomeImprovement,ffql1qs,t1_ffqit4h,1580137473.0,"I see what you mean. Plumbing is not intuitive or easy for me to wrap my head around. Definitely my least confident diy skill (I’m a 24 year old woman much more comfortable with outdoor stuff). Next time I will give it a shot myself, thanks."
HomeImprovement,ffqiap8,t1_ffqh33d,1580135375.0,"Because the undermount sinks need to cure for 12 hours before plumbing being reconnected, and the earliest we can have this done is tomorrow morning. I work today, so I can’t mess with it and don’t have the confidence anyway with the all shitty DIY plumbing done by the last homeowner."
HomeImprovement,ffqg9pg,t1_ffqg1wy,1580133717.0,"Yes, there is one, but it’s not really a good option for us to have to shut it off for over 24 hours, so I was asking if there was something else I should be aware of and about that."
HomeImprovement,ffbuob0,t1_ffb76er,1579783362.0,Thank you!
HomeImprovement,ffb1s2g,t1_ffb1leq,1579749640.0,"That’s what I needed to know and couldn’t seem to find online very clearly, thanks!"
houseplants,ffag13p,t3_er1w0f,1579734890.0,I keep them in lots of light and water every two weeks or so and it’s kept them happy. The small one is a division from the parent plant. I got mine at Walmart 4 years ago!
hoyas,ff92hhr,t1_ff91pdg,1579703224.0,"Yeah, that’d be hard to leave. I have wanted to grow my staghorn fern outdoors to get it to hang-from-chain levels for years."
hoyas,ff90t02,t1_ff8yb5q,1579701962.0,"MN! Not that I want to live somewhere hot and sticky, but it sure would be fun to grow plants outside for most (all) of the year."
hoyas,ff8w0k1,t3_es3n3a,1579697960.0,There are mid summer nights here too cold for my tropicals..
HomeImprovement,ff4ojpo,t1_ff4npkj,1579568649.0,"Ohhh, i see. Not sure what it is, its very old and everything has worn off! W hat brands do you think are good quality for the replacement?"
HomeImprovement,ff4ily5,t1_ff4ie1h,1579564497.0,"We are in the process of updating the counters in there and other hardware anyway, so its a good excuse to just go for matching! Thanks!"
HomeImprovement,ff4hk2g,t1_ff48nf6,1579563776.0,"Do i just change the whole stem to do this?
I wouldnt mind updating that handles while I’m at it if so,"
HomeImprovement,ff404d1,t1_ff3if45,1579552638.0,Thanks! I’m not sure what you mean by make of the shower valve..sorry!
houseplants,ff3683e,t1_ff2wd5l,1579534659.0,Totally get it! I’m not sure if it doesn’t anything besides look structural and cool with its leaves but it seems like a rather easy keeper.
houseplants,ff2uik5,t1_ff2940l,1579524684.0,The one in the terra-cotta pot? It’s an Anthurium superbum! I just got it - I had never seen one before and it’s just too cool!
houseplants,ff0lffe,t1_ff0ceko,1579469966.0,Thanks! They’ve gotten so long I don’t even know how to manage them anymore aside from shoving them out of my dogs’ areas of interest lol
pics,ff041x7,t1_fez36g7,1579464953.0,"I lol’d at this comment for like 5 minutes straight. That first sentence gets me good, thanks"
gardening,ff006ze,t1_fezn2ty,1579463717.0,Same. It’s one of my favorite annuals here in MN and I have never seen it so big before! Love those cute yellow flowers.
aww,feywm03,t1_feyjkrk,1579451435.0,Beagle eyebrows for sure. My dog looks like this and is Meagle with jack Russell. DNA test approved!
aww,feywhsr,t1_feyklid,1579451367.0,My dog looks like this but is 15 pounds. She’s a beagle/min pin/jack russel. Look up beagle mixes - it’s the big “clown eye brows”!
mildlyinfuriating,feggd1x,t1_feff3p9,1579091855.0,"Oh man, I have a crazy neighbor couple - Bob and Betty, no less - that are constantly coming over and making jokes about us taking care of them as they get older. I’m 24. I didn’t realize buying the house across the street signed me up for elder care! But, as Betty says, “ that’s what it’s all about!.”"
plantclinic,feffl16,t1_fefb8zq,1579055283.0,"Yeah, doing that would at the very least buy you some time! These ferns are epiphytic, so in my opinions and schooling, growing them in pots of soil is not their happiest place to be. They love the air circulation of having their roots a bit more free. So I say go for it and just add some soil as needed as it grows! Yours looks very happy, so I wouldn’t even make as drastic a change as rehoming it."
plantclinic,feda5vj,t1_fecpicv,1579005367.0,"Hmm. Mine did not have any fronds stuck fo the Board. I’m not sure on that one, but I would probably make sure to water it well and soak a bit and then try to gently detach is using something flat. I’m not confident that’s the best way to do it, but it’s what I would try. If the frond started or tear I would stop. 

Good luck!"
HomeImprovement,fecgvq6,t1_fecfnry,1578973620.0,"We pulled the trigger on quartz late last week - after living in nice apartments with stone counters for the past 4 “homes”, the laminate in our new-to-us (or 1968 built) house just isn’t cutting it! Totally agree that quartz is the way to go with stone."
plantclinic,fecb00q,t3_eo4mfj,1578969879.0,"I have raised mine for 3.5 years on a plank of wood that I mounted it on myself. It has done super well, and I just re-mounted it onto a new board. The roots themselves had affixed to the old plank - I wouldn’t have even needed to use string after so long! It definitely needed to have some fresh soil after growing for so long, but the last 3 months its slowly been declining, which was my measure that it was time. I personally have had excellent luck with these mounted and as long as it were done properly, it should be able to stay on the plank a while. 

Reading some other comments and here’s my input on watering - I put mine in the shower once a week for 10-15 minutes then let it sit in there for an hour or two to soak up the humidity. It’s done so well!"
HomeImprovement,fec4sq6,t1_feburno,1578966652.0,"Oh poop. I might just be calling in a plumber for this one..
 Thanks, again, for your advice! You helped me figure out a tub faucet leak a while back too!"
HomeImprovement,febeiso,t1_feaqzfi,1578958042.0,"Here’s a pic of under the sink (its our utility space, hence the mess. The seemingly leaky area was like that when we moved in and hasn’t gotten anything wet since, though i never realized how bad those two water pipes are...)  https://imgur.com/gallery/zpsQiEw

And yes, the tailpieces will be shifted back, though not 100% sure how much. Probably around 6”, yeah. 

Any thoughts are super appreciated!"
HomeImprovement,fea3rmj,t1_fe9wrm5,1578944066.0,"Thanks - I know nothing about the dimmer as it was here when we bought the house. It seems like the previous homeowners had been using LEDs with it, but i think it has always flickered at least a little. We will test incandescents in the light and rule out wiring, then change the dimmer if needed, I think. Thanks for the advice!"
HomeImprovement,fe9ztqh,t1_fe83nod,1578942936.0,"In the post I mention that I am not sure about that. The dimmer was already installed in the house when we bought it in August - I know that there are dimmers rated for LED, but wasn’t sure how prevalent or how much flickering would be caused by that vs loose wire connections! Thanks!"
houseplants,fe5ir55,t1_fe5iofi,1578869985.0,"I put it in the shower and let it run for 5-10 minutes usually. The kitchen sink works too. Once every week or two, depending on the season."
houseplants,fe5icor,t1_fe5i34u,1578869827.0,"Thanks! It’s such a great, low effort plant. Also amazing home decor."

AmateurRoomPorn,fe3oves,t1_fe2tyr5,1578851441.0,"I have almost 100 houseplants and i still have to run a humidifier most of the year - in the summer my house is already humid but not because of the plants. Unless you start up a greenhouse, don’t worry about that, generally."

DogsAndPlants,fdrev9o,t1_fdqz4wy,1578683605.0,"Someone already found one, but mine came from Overstock. Sold a lot of places! It’s nice hooked material too, very comfy and sturdy. Green is the best!"

Horticulture,fdowiyi,t3_emhzq1,1578614486.0,"Sketch up and Dynascape are the two I know most landscape designers use in my area. I learned hand drafting in college, and i have done zero in my workplace. I use Dynascape for every project and took a local community college class to best learn how to use it, though all I did was have a professor oversee us watch some amazing YouTube vids for it. If you’re already pretty savvy at that stuff, just watch vids, but if you need hands-on advice, take a class. Ideally, find out which program your specific workplace is using or else you might be wasting your time if they aren’t willing to purchase the use of the one you know!"

interiordecorating,fd9t6sk,t1_fd9r00r,1578237709.0,For real. They could get a good price for this gorgeous piece with mid century being so trendy right now. Holy. Paint would be criminal!
