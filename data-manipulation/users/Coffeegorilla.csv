politics,fes0cci,t1_fer8ytm,1579360173.0,"Yang walked away from Medicare for All, the average family pays about $12,000 a year in medical expenses/insurance. Yang's UBI is $1000 a month which would probably just go towards paying insurance for the average american (and those costs keep going up). It also does nothing to improve medical care/coverage. 

Bernie's Medicare for All plan takes away the crippling debt that comes with our broken health care system, saves us money, AND gives us better medical care.

That's why my primary vote is locked-in for Sanders."
TooAfraidToAsk,fer8ml6,t3_eq6r0r,1579351180.0,"My dog, George, who lived to be 19, lost his hearing around 15. So, he wouldn't come when called, didn't respond to verbal commands, etc. My wife and I started retraining him to respond to hand gestures. Sit was a closed fist. Down was a flat palm facing down. You get the idea. The thing I loved most was if George was looking at me, I would sort of shimmy back and forth like I was wagging an invisible tail and George's tail would start wagging really hard and he'd run up to me and flomp on the ground for tummy rubs.

I don't know what being deaf is like to a dog, but I do know that George was just as cuddly and affectionate as before. So, love your puppy, try some sign language as a way of communication, and don't forget invisible tail wagging."
politics,fekp95a,t1_fekoke0,1579204767.0,"You have gotten the point entirely wrong. Exactly what “wrong doing” was Trump investigating? Was it that Joe Biden somehow got his son a cushy job on an energy company in Ukraine? If so, then Trump should immediately be removed from office for giving his daughter and son in law cushy jobs in the White House.

What Trump tried to do was use aid that he had no right to refuse to coerce another country into investigating his political opponent. What Hunter Biden was doing in Ukraine had no bearing on the US and therefore it was of no importance to investigate. It was an abuse of Trump’s power. Also, while the aid was eventually released, it only was after Trump got caught with his hand in the cookie jar and was told by several republican senators that what he was doing was wrong and if it continued he could be in heaps more trouble."

Omaha,fedu3bo,t1_fedmcnn,1579019916.0,"Surely you realize the odds of someone randomly picking your name, heading to your polling place, declaring themselves to be you, and attempting to vote is as unlikely. What happens when they say your name and the poll worker says, “But that person came in an hour ago?!” What if you are standing right there? The sort of “fraud” that ids purport to to stop is the most inefficient nonsensical type of fraud. It’s like counterfeiting pennies. 

A far more likely sort of fraud and far more devastating to voting would be electronic fraud but the government is literally doing nothing about that.

The ID laws are a way to suppress the vote. Period."

politics,fdzmq6b,t1_fdyz56z,1578791800.0,"The electorate wasn't 'more conservative', the electorate put a 'populist' into power in Trump. 

And if Bernie has less support this primary than he did four years ago, how is he somehow doing better at this point?"
politics,fdyrklg,t1_fdx7tno,1578782828.0,"Let’s rephrase the narrative: had Bernie Sanders been the nominee, we wouldn’t have Trump now. Hillary was grotesquely unpopular, as much as Donald in fact. Hillary did not campaign in the swing states that she thought she had in the bag. Hillary had bad optics like giving Wall St speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars. And Hillary engages the “pied piper” strategy of pumping up Cruz, Trump, and Ben Carson because they would be the easiest to beat. 

The media didn’t do anyone any favors by proclaiming day after day that Hillary was the greatest candidate to ever run for president and was unbeatable.

Here is what I think the media and DNC did to Bernie Sanders: they completely ignored that he started 2016 with absolutely no name recognition but by the time Iowa rolled around was polling within 10% of Hillary. Was this ignorance “rigging” things against Bernie, let’s say no, but it was profoundly stupid and short sighted, and they almost did it again this year, except Bernie didn’t start at 3% and had to build up, he started on top with a fundraising grass roots apparatus in place. And now, here we are, weeks from Iowa, post heart attack, with a myriad of other candidates, and another progressive in Elizabeth Warren and he’s TIED for first!

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. We have reached the “then they fight you” part of this little drama and I am very excited to see the look on all the pundits faces when they announce that Bernie has won Iowa and shatters the narrative that he is unelectable."
