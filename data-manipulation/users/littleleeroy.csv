DataHoarder,fep59cw,t3_eq9xii,1579312426.0,I too would appreciate any insight
LearnUselessTalents,fejwy1i,t1_fejnmnc,1579187744.0,That’s smart for the last 7! I can just picture the music staves from G and go down.
todayilearned,feiglp1,t1_feigiyr,1579138055.0,Aha yep!
todayilearned,feigg7y,t1_fehz5rx,1579137953.0,"Except no, as she was in a position of power over him. So he would have to be 18 for it to be legal."
todayilearned,feig9e9,t1_fei7ga9,1579137826.0,Read the bloody article before asking obvious questions.
web_design,fe8pm6u,t3_eo1q6d,1578928965.0,You can add koalas to that list now thanks to the bushfires in Australia...
DIY,fe7sson,t1_fe5t6wd,1578918875.0,"So is there a lot of empty space in the cabinet or do you use it to store bits and pieces as well? 
I also noticed the amp and xbox is on top. Is that for IR control purposes?"

DeepIntoYouTube,fe0jptg,t3_endinn,1578814542.0,Reminds me of the German opera Wozzeck
gardening,fdir17t,t1_fdhr7v6,1578449114.0,Will you be so kind as to show us once you plant them all? It’s be nice to see the plain garden beds then every few weeks see an update. Or even just to see your setup!
AskReddit,fddlfso,t1_fdctuj9,1578316754.0,"If you like these, you’ll love the [Educational Jargon Generator](Https://sciencegeek.net/lingo.html)!"
MeatlessMealPrep,fcxkm2p,t1_fcwuojo,1578065225.0,Not OP but from experience you should probably pre-bake pizzas before freezing them. The dough will cook better and your toppings will stay in place. Easier to reheat too.
thethickofit,fcwtuqs,t3_ej4cjf,1578037383.0,That’s the Prime Minister of Australia they’re shouting at (for those who are unaware.)
WTF,fctv61y,t1_fctnrv2,1577961179.0,"Most definitely but despite how stupid it may be, I 100% want to try it."
explainlikeimfive,fctv2be,t1_fcttwou,1577961027.0,"I learnt from your question, so it wasn’t stupid. You made me think how North America is so varied in climate but Australia is vastly dry when away from the coast. I didn’t realise mountains make such a big impact on long term change."
DataHoarder,fc700j7,t3_egj221,1577493902.0,"Have a google for HDD enclosures if you don’t want to install it in your PC. If you do, then you need a SATA cable to plug from your HDD to your motherboard. 
SSDs are a newer technology that is much faster to read and write than HDDs but costs more per terabyte to buy."
teslamotors,fc5pu5y,t1_fc42cc1,1577463391.0,I’m curious. How quick is the animation to update from the traffic lights? I’m guessing like half a second?
darkjokes,fc2stnv,t1_fc2no66,1577373021.0,Is it something to do with the swimmers being refugees who swim across to Spain?
IWantToLearn,fc0hs92,t3_efdvbe,1577291132.0,"In Australia we use the National Library as a good starting point. A lot of their collection is digitised so you can search for historical events or periods [there](http://Trove.nla.gov.au). (It might take a little bit to get used to the layout though.)

As others have pointed out for more recent events, the references on a Wikipedia page, or googling for the full speech/report may be the best way to find the original source and collating various primary sources (news articles, speeches, reports) is the best way to form an understanding of the issue/event/opinion. The more various sources you use, the better your understanding will be."
