My next big upgrade will probably be an Akra, and hopefully the rally raid spoked wheels too."

Dualsport,ffh8fkx,t1_ffh8age,1579926083.0,"Probably, that’s okay. I feel comfortable working through those and I bring the tools required to do so on the road.

I also travel with a starter battery capable of 30+ cold start jumps when I’m doing long rides in case the battery dies due to short or something and I’m unable to fix before the battery totally discharges"

Dualsport,ffg6jvw,t1_ffg6cgl,1579899536.0,"It's my first motorcycle so I went into it assuming I'd drop it. I definitely didn't think I'd have more drops than miles by the end of my first year tho...

Jokes aside I agree: I keep a careful eye on my bike and do a pre-ride check every time we go for a ride. She hasn't let me down yet"
Dualsport,ffg681n,t1_ffg5cax,1579899332.0,Hahahah this is brilliant
Dualsport,ffg656t,t1_ffg58ym,1579899284.0,"All the pics/vids -not- in the woods in the OP are from Neah Bay, actually (including the splashing slow-mo vids). Here are some more: https://imgur.com/a/nzjrCrM

That route to Alaska sounds dope, I haven't planned mine terribly far out in advance yet as I'm hoping to do it on a new bike and that may change my route. If not, I'll just end up going as hard as I can w/ the 310 and have as much time off-road as I can.

Riding in the Olympic Park can be beautiful but there are also plenty of beautiful coastal roads along the northern part of the peninsula. If you can take 3 or 4 days to do it, you can _absolutely_ do a nice trip out to Neah Bay which includes a short hike (30 min?) to the northwesternmost US point. I've done this trip twice and loved it both times"
Dualsport,ffg4uu5,t1_ffg4dqc,1579898496.0,"Dude! Very awesome, I'm doing my Alaska pilgrimage this summer after I also save up some PTO. 

I did a trip out to Neah Bay/Cape Flattery a few months ago, I'll reply to your comment again with a few pictures. Feel free to reach out at any point to talk about Olympic Peninsula tips/tricks (there are definitely quite a few to go over)"
Dualsport,ffg44v7,t1_ffg1186,1579898055.0,"Thanks for your experience, and for the handlebar story. I kinda had a suspicion the handlebars looked thin but wasn't sure if it was me, so that's good to know.

I'll keep treating it fairly and report back if she ever bites the dust for good (or until I get another motor on her lol)"
Dualsport,ffg40y9,t1_ffg1bwu,1579897985.0,"Thanks! And good eye! This is at Evan's Creek ORV park near Mt. Rainier. I've done a few rides to Vancouver from SEA, absolutely love it there."

Dualsport,ffg0bap,t1_fffzcxy,1579895696.0,"Thank you, may the farkle god smile upon you this year"
Dualsport,ffg053g,t1_fffzu2b,1579895590.0,"Yup, I'm definitely aware of some - but not all - of the design limitations on the bike so I do appreciate you bringing these up. I was careful in starting to use the bike off-road to see how it held up and it's done pretty well so far, no obvious issues and no issues found during the first dealer checkup following a few dual track trails.

I babied it at first, but now a little less.

What sort of issues do you think could be caused by dumping the bike badly on its side & taking that load on the crash bars?"
Dualsport,fffxzd9,t3_etf99l,1579894253.0,"My 310 is my first bike and it hasn't let me down yet. I've outfitted it with the following items/mods/accessories:

- Crash bars
- Skidplate & oil filter guard
- Headlight guard
- Radiator guard
- Hand guards
- LED fog lights 
- Heated grips
- Heated equipment controls
- Rear suspension guard
- Knobby tires
- Rear fender elimination kit
- Aluminum panniers & bag

These mods make the 310 into a capable off-road contender.
The following mods will be done before I leave for Death Valley in Feb: 

- Add extra fuel canisters
- Mount LED headlight
- Replace air filter"

I bet you can achieve a very cool texture & color if you use a higher surface tension and super vivid red paint. Maybe flick it onto the dial with a brush that you pull back and let spring forward.

BetterEveryLoop,fel43ju,t1_fekyhcp,1579213631.0,"That's what you'd be referring to with the ""sonic boom."" Jargon or explanation doesn't matter, it is incorrect.

edit: just read your linked nature article and I am wrong about you being incorrect. I am super surprised there's enough energy there to cause this effect, thanks for insisting you were right. Here is the relevant portion for anyone reading, and I'll leave the comment for posterity:

>To calculate the air velocities that would be seen at higher speeds, Gekle et al. simulated the system mathematically. Their model incorporated equations used to describe airflow in supersonic jet engines, but with modifications that took into account the constantly changing shape of the cavities formed in their study. By combining experimental data with numerical simulations, the authors found that air can be pushed out of the cavities at supersonic speeds — even though the pressure inside the cavity is only 2% greater than atmospheric pressure."
BetterEveryLoop,fektvxy,t1_feknglc,1579207504.0,The water droplet that pops up is actually a big contribution here! It's called a Rayleigh or Worthington Jet.
BetterEveryLoop,fekti3d,t1_fekn7k6,1579207276.0,"~~This is not true, the energy needed to create cavitation sufficient to cause the observed effect would far surpass that which is provided by the vacuum collapsing after the fat fella's passed through the water.~~

This is buoyancy in effect, combined with a ""drop impact"" causing a Rayleigh or Worthington Jet. edit: the jet has a significantly higher contribution to the launch than buoyancy, yes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_impact

edit: the cause I describe above is correct but I am falsely calling /u/gradies completely incorrect, he is right about the interesting effect causing a ""supersonic splash."" They linked a nature article in another comment where the last paragraph explains that portion nicely:
