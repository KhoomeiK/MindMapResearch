nextfuckinglevel,fgz26qe,t1_fgygwgi,1581189813.0,60 bucks?! Man fuck that it's just a movie ticket.
nfl,fgz0vwx,t1_fgyr08s,1581189453.0,Don't the Diaz Bros also eat fish? So even they're not completely vegan.
videos,fgunurx,t1_fgukf1i,1581125358.0,That's the point. Bombard the guy with questions and show how it's hard to answer anything quickly and honestly when assholes are in your face bombarding you with questions. And the dude in the video didn't even have the risk of going to jail lingering over him.
MadeMeSmile,fgtw8mu,t3_f0d1mt,1581110249.0,Why they fuck put that picture of thor at the bottom? The story itself is already great. Way try to make it a meme.
WTF,fgtrcu6,t1_fgslg2o,1581108375.0,Oh fuck. Guys take nsfl warning completely serious. Holy fuck.
todayilearned,fgrpuvy,t1_fgrp6zf,1581053580.0,Just don't like working haha. I'm fortunate enough to work at a place where I'm pretty happy to work at. Doesn't mean I'm eager to work tho.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgrihyu,t3_f04owi,1581047657.0,It only affects his x factor. Dickerson is still a top back in the game.
49ers,fgrfg5d,t1_fgqjsx3,1581045504.0,They say that about every coach cuz that's typically what they hope for.
WTF,fgquo32,t3_ezyeep,1581031866.0,Holy shit it's been awhile since I seen something that actually belonged in this sub.
49ers,fgqtgnz,t1_fgqoy17,1581031133.0,You probably think jimmy should be cut too huh? After they both had really good regular seasons they have one bad game and suddenly they need to be cut?
todayilearned,fgqmxx1,t1_fgq6z76,1581027287.0,Right? Like I would rather do anything than have to work.
todayilearned,fgqmt2x,t3_ezx1si,1581027214.0,I would also like to take days off whenever I want. But that's not gonna happen. This is stupid lol.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgqkx8o,t1_fgqkkk4,1581026166.0,"Yes. He's still a great back just not gonna be op. If someone dumps him cuz they can't abuse the x factor anymore, you know that person was trash lol."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgpsps9,t3_ezuqd8,1581011260.0,Won't be using too many of these on my theme team but well fuckin done ea.
funny,fgog2rp,t3_ezlo1q,1580968729.0,Holy shit I remember getting something like this in Mass fwd text back during flip phones.
nfl,fgobj8h,t1_fgo9ixu,1580964756.0,I mean kittle is definitely a better blocker. But that's not shitting on kelces blocking ability. Just as saying kelce is a better route runner isn't shitting on kittle.
todayilearned,fgo0n8o,t3_ezfzrk,1580957072.0,Yeeeah bullshit. They knew what they were goin for but some corporate guy probably got scared it would be controversial.
MMA,fgnz983,t1_fgnor4j,1580956182.0,Nah that shit was obvious as fuck. Anyone who couldn't see that is a dumbass.
pics,fgnyp17,t3_ezj5ro,1580955822.0,Didn't realize I was on Facebook.
49ers,fgno2q2,t1_fgno0k2,1580949112.0,Oh that's right shanny was oc for cousins in Washington huh? That's a good point.
49ers,fgnnxbj,t1_fgnnci4,1580949014.0,I could see that possibly happening if Jimmy does really poorly next season but I'm also not sure if cousins is a big enough upgrade over Jimmy to really get us a win in the Superbowl. It's only a slight improvement and that's mainly cuz cousins has more starting experience than Jimmy.
49ers,fgnmtlx,t1_fgncx8g,1580948289.0,The Superbowl has never gone to overtime before the pats and falcons. How bout Jimmy's the first mvp in 20 years to win it all?
49ers,fgnmpjk,t1_fgmtf8z,1580948214.0,I don't understand those people. Yeah George was probably frustrated in the moment. Anyone would be. You're running wide open and your qb doesn't even look your way. To act like they suddenly hate each other and the bromance was all fake is fuckin stupid. Shit friends argue with each other all the time.
49ers,fgnlz83,t1_fgn6p0a,1580947729.0,Not to mention the holding. I'm fine with refs not throwing a flag every holding. The game would take even longer. But you gotta call the egregious shit. Namely the hold on bosa on 3rd and 15. That was garbage.
49ers,fgnlmus,t1_fgn06ip,1580947501.0,It's weird seeing fuckin cowherd being one of the only talking heads defending Jimmy. He's keeps mentioning that yeah he had a shit 4th quarter. But he was solid the first 3 quarters and the rest of the season.
49ers,fgnljr5,t1_fgn62ij,1580947446.0,Now that the bandwagon fans have started to leave were seeing more rational takes on Jimmy. Yes he had a bad 4th quarter. But he still got us there in the first place.
funny,fgmyh2g,t1_fgmw0oo,1580934368.0,That is clearly an office job lol
49ers,fgmxo6o,t1_fgmpq01,1580933971.0,Also the refs weren't solely responsible for our loss. They contributed for sure but they didn't make us turn away from from the run.
nfl,fgmxhgo,t1_fgmq0nn,1580933875.0,Lol what. The dude shut down his side of the field in his prime. He's obviously lost a step. Injuries and age will do that. But to act like he wasn't a top DB for much of his career is just ignorant.
nfl,fgmx19h,t1_fgmvv9b,1580933650.0,"It's almost like the kittle vs kelce conversation. If you want a great receiver with good blocking you take kelce. If you want a good receiver with great blocking you take kittle. 

If you want a man to man corner who can shut down the best receiver you take revis. If you want a zone corner who can shut down a side of the field you take Sherman. Simple as that."
nfl,fgmwfyq,t1_fgmsqqy,1580933330.0,It's shit on the niners week. This sub is gonna be talking about how our team was lucky and overrated and our players are trash. All while only watching 3 or 4 of our games at most. Those guys think they instantly know our team.
nfl,fgmvedu,t1_fgmmraz,1580932767.0,Oh for sure. Mullens would be a great stepping stone if Jimmy g doesn't pan out.
nfl,fgmm5zx,t1_fgmku5h,1580927407.0,I doubt it. One bad game from Jimmy isn't gonna force him to get benched. He's a big reason we did as good as we did. The defense was banged up and the run game wasn't as effective against the saints or Cardinals. Jimmy lit them up. He made some clutch throws against the rams. He converted 3rd and 16 twice! I've still got faith that Jimmy is our guy. I do think he's gotta prove it next season or it might be time to consider moving on then.
nfl,fgmkaxo,t1_fgmjq2r,1580926302.0,And replace him with who? A 42 year old qb that we would maybe get 2 years out of? Jimmys not the best but there's far worse out there. I'm happy with him.
49ers,fglat95,t3_ez2jwf,1580888582.0,I'm surprised so many people in the NFL sub are shitting on George for this. This is fuckin badass. Feel bad for anyone who tries to stop him next season.
politics,fgkswdl,t3_ez1i5x,1580872878.0,Holy fuck. I thought I was watching wwe or UFC with USA chants.
politics,fgkpzlt,t3_ez1i5x,1580871057.0,What the fuck has rush Limbaugh done for the country.
politics,fgkpwk9,t3_ez1i5x,1580871006.0,Do you think pelosi is jealous of other Congress members who don't have to listen to some of this shit?
nfl,fgkfw7t,t3_eyzmuu,1580864612.0,Man I remember being hyped for this guy. Thought a punter with a personality would be really fun.
nfl,fgkfiew,t1_fgkaowh,1580864354.0,It's also a play we call pretty regularly lol. Deebo runs at least 3 or 4 times a game.
nfl,fgkf8oj,t1_fgkcsoh,1580864172.0,And both fit perfectly for their respective schemes. They're 1a and 1b basically.
nfl,fgkf5wo,t1_fgjg8x5,1580864120.0,Poor playcalling down the stretch and Jimmy not seeing kittle open on a few plays. But Kittles usefulness doesn't always show on up stats. He's a beast of a blocker and is a huge reason our run game was so good through the season. The few games he was out you could see a huge drop off in run production.
nfl,fgkesx6,t1_fgjr2wm,1580863879.0,Any niner fan actually saying that it wasn't close was either delusional or a bandwagon fan. They are 1a and 1b and it all depends on what you want out of them. If you want a great recieving threat with good blocking then you take kelce. If you a good recieving threat with great blocking you take kittle. And fortunately they are on teams that can capitalize on each guys talents.
nfl,fgkej69,t1_fgjks8c,1580863701.0,It's pretty nice that we got the best possible tight ends for our teams.
funny,fgke3me,t1_fgkdcoh,1580863421.0,"While I get where you're coming from, you don't think it's kinda hypocritical to say it's ok for kids to be watching men destroy their bodies and brains for out entertainment but watching women dance and dressed suggestively is wrong?"
AskReddit,fgkati0,t1_fgje3bg,1580861270.0,Yup just saying stomach issues or you threw up is all your boss needs to hear. Especially if your in customer service and even more so in food service. At least if you boss gives a shit.
49ers,fgka4r0,t1_fgk662r,1580860816.0,"That was so confusing to me. Five yards on first down is great. So fuckin run it again. And then barring a disaster of a play it's either first down again, 3rd and 5 or maybe 6, or 3rd and short."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgk9vbj,t1_fgk9tom,1580860652.0,It's in I form tight not shotgun.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgk8y1v,t3_eyzdq6,1580860058.0,Stretch is an outside zone play. Off the top of my head niners and raiders for sure have it.
49ers,fgk28my,t1_fgk1lxz,1580855980.0,I don't think we need to be worried about a Pettis type slump from bosa or deebo. Especially deebo. He learned from his mistakes quickly this season and seems to be really open to criticism and has good work ethic. After the first Seattle game he noticably improved his hands and didn't have as many drops.
nfl,fgk0cx4,t1_fgk0c6f,1580854915.0,YOU SON OF A BITCH
nfl,fgjzyx1,t1_fgjxyc0,1580854703.0,Wait a second we're supposed to make the jokes about you guys! You can't do this!
pcmasterrace,fgjzpp4,t1_fgjzocn,1580854561.0,Then shit go for it haha
funny,fgjzm2z,t1_fgju1hp,1580854506.0,I would rather people ask. At least that shows basic concern and they learn more about reptiles.
gaming,fgjyqcw,t1_fgjrjk4,1580854014.0,Pretty damn good game actually. Unfortunately it's been killed. I guess it's the devs way of forcing you to buy the sequels. Btw if you're interested there is no 9. It's just 8 then straight to 10.
nfl,fgjuosf,t1_fgjja1l,1580851742.0,Yeah fuck anyone downvoting you. That gif is a great example. It's either pi or it's not. Be consistent is all I ask.
nfl,fgjujla,t1_fgjjlnw,1580851662.0,It's similar to what got called in the Superbowl and the guy you're replying to was using it as an example of reffing being inconsistent. It's a great point he's making.
nfl,fgjugt3,t1_fgjljsl,1580851619.0,It's not even that bad and proves the original comments point. That usually goes uncalled. Consistency is what's important.
nfl,fgju8d9,t1_fgjlrny,1580851492.0,"Andy also just won his first Superbowl as a head coach. Brady, belichick and the Patriots have made everyone think winning the Superbowl is easy or normal. Shanny still has a lot to learn but he's shown he's got what it takes to be a hc. I've still got faith in him, Jimmy g and the team. We're still young and not completely fucked for the future."
funny,fgjth8y,t1_fgjl6yv,1580851076.0,Ah so it's similar to Google hiring. They don't care if you have a diploma or not but you need to be able to show you actually know your shit.
PublicFreakout,fgjqogp,t1_fgiglbd,1580849504.0,"Like someone else said, it's always been there. But with the internet and social media being as relevant as it is now, the idiots have a much bigger platform to be stupid and attract similar stupid people."
worldnews,fgjqagj,t1_fgjlad4,1580849283.0,Working in food service for just a little bit really opens your eyes to how few people actually wash their hands. Just the thought of not washing my hands after using the bathroom makes my skin crawl. Fuckin disgusting.
gaming,fgjogtv,t1_fgjgs0m,1580848234.0,Seriously. Gotta get a hobby that you enjoy doing. Otherwise why work so hard and worry about being healthy if you're not gonna do anything you enjoy.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgjnn3i,t1_fgjmd0n,1580847754.0,End topic. Pretty sure this is how it's taught in the skills trainer. Not that anyone does them. They would rather just ask questions here instead of doing them.
funny,fgjizod,t1_fgjavtj,1580845036.0,Was that the play where bosa get held like fuckin crazy? Yes I'm still salty.
pcmasterrace,fgjfmu0,t1_fgj7me8,1580843030.0,Don't even bother man. Half the people here don't know what pcmr actually is. They think it's a circlejerk sub to shit on consoles and console owners.
pcmasterrace,fgjfeu2,t1_fghutqd,1580842896.0,"Or maybe don't wanna deal with the hassle of gaming on PC. If they just wanna put the game in and trust that it's gonna work without worrying about drivers, or compatibility issues and shit then console is perfect for them."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgjb657,t3_eyt286,1580840492.0,Next year. Until they need his x factor there's no reason to use anyone else from a competitive standpoint.
Games,fgj9dsr,t3_eyrbzd,1580839578.0,"So is the switch just gonna be a system for ports? Like it's great Nintendo is more open to third party games than in the past, but release newer games not older games no one was really asking for."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgj8sb7,t3_eytijs,1580839227.0,Woooow kraelo. Basically saying shut up and be glad you even got one. Fuck you.
MMA,fgi5ab2,t1_fgi21yj,1580806231.0,And sometimes in a dominant loss I'm ok with it. Like Anderson Silva getting ko'd by weidman. When you're that dominant you deserve the instant rematch.
MMA,fgi58tf,t3_eyg3qg,1580806169.0,I'm a huge max fan but fuckin why? Max was a great champ for sure but he didn't have the long time dominance to get an instant rematch. And the decision wasn't even controversial.
49ers,fgi55p5,t1_fghimfp,1580806042.0,And we're not fucked when it comes to draft picks. The eagles just had shit luck. Probably one of the most injured teams in the league.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fghu5d0,t1_fghlzca,1580793947.0,Yeah you pay with money or with time in this game. Really hard to play casually and compete with other teams.
nfl,fggmr2a,t1_fggjipm,1580765095.0,I don't think the entire loss is on Jimmy but he's responsible for sure. Shanny deserves most of the blame imo. He just had to kill clock. Instead he wanted to put the game in Jimmy's hands and he couldn't deliver when it mattered. So blame Jimmy but also blame shanny for putting Jimmy in that position.
MMA,fggkv7p,t1_fggkugc,1580763979.0,Good point.
nfl,fggiik3,t1_fgg52uh,1580762579.0,Son of a bitch that's when I was able to really start listening to the game. Every niner game this season that I watched or listened to most of we ended up losing.
MMA,fgghz06,t1_fgggkfy,1580762258.0,If that's the angle he's going for I don't understand how that's a bad thing. Your opponent shows a moment of weakness and you jump on that and attack. That's the fuckin sport lol.
49ers,fggfqtq,t1_fggd5ao,1580760929.0,Hopefully another full off-season learning the system and not having to recover from a surgery will help take Jimmy to the next level too.
funny,fggfbd9,t1_fggf31z,1580760673.0,I'm been going bald since 18 and it was easy for me to accept. Nothing I can do to change it. So I'll just shave it. No one looks good balding. Trying to cling to that little bit is gonna make you look bad. Just shave it and accept it.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgg8rzo,t3_eybjrk,1580756696.0,Meanwhile if a defender even looks at my qb wrong he just drops the ball.
nfl,fgg7n55,t1_fgfi0ca,1580756003.0,Yeah anyone claiming Jimmy to be some top tier qb is either delusional or just a bandwagon fan. Most of us know what we have with Jimmy g. A solid qb with a ton to learn.
funny,fgg0mwr,t1_fgfy97x,1580751679.0,Just shave your head lol. It's not that bad.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fgg0030,t3_ey8v4h,1580751293.0,God dammit ea. If you're not gonna give Edelman speed give him top catch stats. Especially catch in traffic. That's what he's best at.
nfl,fgf11vg,t1_fgeh8un,1580718691.0,Anyone legit saying that is either blinded by homerism or was a bandwagon fan. We know what we have with Jimmy. We have a solid qb. He's in the upper half of qb's but there's definitely better than him.
nfl,fgf0yfu,t1_fgemqml,1580718553.0,"I mean you should know better than most that Jimmy isn't just a game manager. He obviously had a bad game tonight and needs to improve. But he's capable of winning games. The game against you guys was a shootout. If Jimmy couldn't sling it, it would've been a one-sided beatdown from you guys."
49ers,fgetyhu,t1_fgem6tz,1580709906.0,A full season without needing to recover from surgery will hopefully allow him to be even better.
nfl,fgeppbh,t1_fgenhbc,1580705869.0,Didn't rhcp play with their instruments unplugged just to fuck with the NFL?
nfl,fgep82d,t1_fgejt3h,1580705460.0,I'm completely convinced the media got in their head. Shanny wanted to prove that he does trust Jimmy to throw the ball. And look what fuckin happened.
nfl,fgeofms,t1_fgeicls,1580704797.0,How could that loss be on anyone but Kyle lol. He literally just had to run the ball and kick a fg. Boom falcons win.
49ers,fgenv5z,t1_fgemi7j,1580704336.0,Dunno man. We play in possibly the toughest division in football. No guarantees there. Compared to AFC west or NFC east.
49ers,fgemj1j,t1_fgem7xg,1580703281.0,Yes but mahomes is special. Jimmy's great but there's no way he could do half the shit mahomes pulls off. Not to mention the weapons on offense mahomes has. Much better than ours as a whole.
49ers,fgelx1r,t1_fgeibjy,1580702806.0,Especially against the chiefs. There is no room to play conservative against them. Do it and you lose. Simple as that. They can score at any point and from anywhere.
49ers,fgelprc,t1_fgeiuwd,1580702649.0,Always gotta remind myself that he's basically only a second year starter.
nfl,fge0u1g,t3_exx0qr,1580689234.0,"Alright Jimmy, there's your dumb pick of the game. No more aight."
nfl,fge02p4,t1_fgdzy7b,1580688874.0,My heart dropped for a split second thinking holy shit what a gangster way to announce your retirement.
nfl,fgdzysi,t3_exx0qr,1580688827.0,Fuckin Brady and Hulu with the fake out.
nfl,fgdzt58,t1_fgdzoeu,1580688754.0,He really will be. The shit he pulls off regularly is crazy.
nfl,fgdzoxt,t1_fgdzk3h,1580688697.0,They were scared of the pitch play. Try to lay out the qb and he pitches it to the rb.
nfl,fgdz20f,t3_exx0qr,1580688559.0,Glad Ward is back up. Good clean hit.
