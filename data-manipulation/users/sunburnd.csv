Really?  Let's see you show me why.

>Insurance companies are middle men, insurance is a cost sharing problem, so ultimately you need everyone to buy in for it to be sustainable (the public mandate) and we’d all rather that middle man be the government,

Is the cost not shared now?  There already *was* and is a public mandate that was supposed to solve this.  How did that work out?

>And we’d all rather that middle man be the government, ie the people, rather than some greedy fucking private company that pays its executives millions of dollars and lobbies to keep drug prices high.

Except that we know that Medicare just inserts private contractors as yet another layer of middle men.  If the contention is that the US government is going to put in place the infrastructure to handle 300 million beneficiaries in a couple of years that is fantastical thinking.  Medicare has been in place since the 60's.

I'd prefer to have other options than relying on the same government where leaders like Trump are elected and future congressmen are free to tinker with my my coverage to fit their current wedge issues.

But hey keep thinking that any objection is ignorance and treating people with disdain."

trashy,fesog9l,t1_ferpn36,1579367412.0,"You know how Medicare does that?

It relies on a network of private contractors and insurance companies who manage the 30 million beneficiaries for a profit.

That being said it also wasted about 8% of it's operating budget on improper payments.

There is no reason a public option can't be offered if people believe that people like Trump can make better choices about their health care."
trashy,fesmjqv,t1_fesg3w3,1579366811.0,">Lol. You think Medicare has a 4 trillion annual budget. Yes you do.

Are you serious?  The Health care industry is a 4T dollar industry. Of that 2T is is represented by the insurance industry with an estimated 3% fraud rate.

 Medicare represents $582 billion with it's budget.
Just recently it was estimated that around 50 billion was used in improper payments alone.
 About  8% of it's operating budget.

You win by showing that healthcare.gov providers denied about 17% of claims?  That says more about the ACA than traditional health insurance plans.  You win a trip on the short bus?"
trashy,fesjolg,t1_ferpffu,1579365903.0,"The USPS is funded by its own operations and by the people who utilize it's services.  It also has competitors in the market.

Medicare outsources most of it's administrative services to private contractors.  It is also the same agency that accidentally overpayed providers by almost 8% of it's budget.  

Speaking of which why would I want to put health care in the hands of someone like Trump?  After all if the idea is that the USPS can be neutered by the government nothing is stopping it for healthcare.

One party gains power and pretty soon reproductive health services are a target."
trashy,feshgnq,t1_fes1s6a,1579365174.0,"Do you know how Medicare works?

The CMS has about 6k employees and most every interaction is done through private contractors.

It certainly doesn't have the infrastructure to expand the program 10x.  It really doesn't have any infrastructure at all.

It hands off the majority of the workload to private companies who can accomplish the administrative tasks more Inna more cost effective way.

The amount of red tape I encounter with my private insurance is 0.  In the event something is denied coverage I have a state regulatory agency that will assist in resolution.  I've not encountered any snags with the exception of being forced to wait an extra week for surgery since the outcome was statistically better.

My son went through 4 years of chemo and the most I've ever had was the insurance company call to indicate that mental health services were covered in the event my wife or I needed counseling.

Meanwhile my mother spent the last 4 years of her life battling to get vancomycin approved for hospital aquired MRSA, every other week.

So when someone says that Medicare is more efficient it is a clue that they have never dealt with it."

Besides Medicare literally overpaid providers 8% of their entire budget in a single year.  Relies on private companies as a middle man whom take a cut.  

You keep saying that public health care requires *less* hoops but I disagree.  

Medicare contractors deny around 10% of all outpatient claims.  Meanwhile it is a pentathlon event to apeal decisions to the point that one has to get a lawyer.  Private claims process has an easier path thorough resolutions (in my state) that generally can be navigated by the provider without patient intervention.

Duh."

It isn't an either/or proposition.  If you want to opt-in to a public option then that is great.  Add a payroll deduction for those who opt-in and be done.

If the government can provide an adequate service at a acceptable levels then people will flock to it."
