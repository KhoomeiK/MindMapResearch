pathofexile,fei84un,t1_fegzzqj,1579132410.0,"Yess this reminds me of classic YouTube back when the video would be nothing but the content. Before we had to have an intro, and then ""Whatup Bros it's johnnyTV sorry I haven't uploaded for awhile I've been hella sick....."" 7 minutes later we get one piece of content at a time seperated by sponsors, and bullshit."

I was at 7-11 earlier walking my gecko and said whatsup to a guy who had the same shoes as me. Well it got really awkward because I didn't know he was gay, the guy just responds with a slow  ""hMmMMm"" and stares romantically directly in my eyes until I got weirded out and walked away."

fatlogic,fdlnbfn,t3_elmeam,1578527917.0,"These people drive me crazy because they think weight loss is a day to day thing, so if you're hungry for 18 hours and then eat a fat meal you'll be fine even if it's 5,000 calories. 

Hell you could gain weight and not even eat every day, if you eat nothing every other day and 10,000 calories on the other days you'll be fat.

Fasting is a great way to lose weight though I lost a hair under 100lbs two years ago with an 1800 calorie diet. For the first few weeks I would eat nothing until dinner and eat an entire frozen pizza. I got to lose weight rapidly and stuff my face every night."
