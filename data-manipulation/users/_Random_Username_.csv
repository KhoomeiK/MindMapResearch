What I meant here is that Amazon lorries for example will be using the roads etc, and if there was a fire at a warehouse, US firefighters would come put it out. Therefore amazon is using these services so should be liable to pay their taxes in the US. I'm not saying Jeff himself should be taxed, rather the company profits.
