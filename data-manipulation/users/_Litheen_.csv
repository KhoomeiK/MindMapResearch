NoStupidQuestions,ffbmews,t1_ffbkoca,1579772581.0,Sounds like two different matters: your brother was taken to court for trespassing. You should’ve opened a case specifically about the ownership of the dog? Where or how she lives is irrelevant and if you’d approached this via a legal route there’d have been no way that trespassing had come into play.

trashy,ff8mu0p,t3_es99qa,1579686414.0,Post itself is hardly trashy. The comments below it however... Trash talking somebody for no reason other than that op claims she used to be a bully?
Paranormal,ff6jxrl,t1_ff5jku8,1579628796.0,Just search for 'sleep talk recorder' these days there seem to be several apps so you can pick whichever.

Down voters need to get out of their Disneyland fairytale and recognise that some animals can actually kill and that this is a risky situation."
Paranormal,ff5ksda,t1_ff5jku8,1579597650.0,"Well, considering your issue doesn't seem threatening in any way, I don't think you'll be hearing demons. I used it for a while and I mostly just heard the blankets rustle when I'd turn around in bed. Not very exciting, so I stopped using the app (I was curious if I was a sleeptalker , turns out I'm not)."
Netherlands,ff5k88o,t3_err8c6,1579596841.0,He was literally doing his job. Would be shitty security to assume everybody who is on the terrain is automatic okay. People can sneak in and whatnot. You're overreacting.
Paranormal,ff5jgnu,t3_err3if,1579595746.0,"There is a sleep sound recoding app for your phone (or at least there used to be one) that will start recording when there's sounds (talking) during the night. That way you won't have to dig through hours of no sounds, it only records when there's actual sounds. Give it a try, see if maybe you both talk in your sleep and are only respond g to eachother."

relationship_advice,fex7gc4,t3_eqtqft,1579426009.0,"You did well in not only recognising the signs as it developed, but also to say ""know what, screw this. I'm out. "", instead of desperately clinging to an asshole."

Advice,femtv3i,t1_femq05n,1579269445.0,"That's a way. But since I'm only catsitting there once every few months it'd still not be a constructive solution for the cats wellbeing. (my own cats took to their scratching items right away, so I suppose it differs from cat to cat)."
Advice,femtobp,t1_femqz6n,1579269295.0,"Thing is I'm only catsitting there every so often. Once every few months mayne. So while I could bring and take them during my sitting, for the cats wellbeing it's not a constructive solution in the long run."
Advice,fempkys,t1_fempfp9,1579265796.0,"I'm not that regularly there outside of catsitting periods, and this cat won't even let me touch his paws :/ Besides, cat should be able to scratch. Clipping the nails is fighting symptoms instead of  taking care of the cause."
Botchedsurgeries,fejx7z7,t1_fejpaik,1579187923.0,Combined with the overal fitness and muscularity. I'd say this lady is simply in fantastic shape and has a booty to show for it. Doesn't look fake let alone botched.

Saying clothing is dirty after wearing it once is silly imo. Sure it's not as clean as it was when it come out of the closet, but it's not dirty enough either to immediately dump in the laundry.  
I got better things to do than to wash nearly clean clothes."

If that is what makes her happy and confident about herself, then she doesn't need her family to talk her down. Green eyeshadow and purple lipstick sounds pretty sweet.
It's not always about preventing to get bullied, because bullies will always find a reason to pick on somebody regardless of how they look. It's about doing what makes you (or in this case: her) feel good. And the rest of the world can kiss our sweet arse."

TwoXChromosomes,fbrtjmf,t3_ee8wzy,1577046128.0,"1) is unfair to be angry about. Because as a 13 year old you're really not mature enough to truly understand these things, know what do or who to turn to, especially in a situation like this. You wouldn't get angry with a 13 year old victim either for not seeking help, so why is a 13year old bystander suddenly held accountable for it? 

2 and 3 is fair though. Sometimes people get so stuck in ""everybody acts like it's no big deal so I guess it isn't"" that it becomes their reality. It's hard to break through that, because it makes things painful, awkward and complicated. I'm not trying to justify it, mind you, it's just why people often prefer to act like nothing happend. That way they can simply follow the norm, everybody knows how to play a happy family, that's the easy path."
