I'd much rather date someone who shares my hobbies (very rare) and who I could be open with and myself around than someone who most people would consider attractive."
depression,ffeluhf,t3_et5ufr,1579853588.0,"My family are the kind of people who think you shouldn't listen to anything negative and it'll cause you health problems. I was already in a bad state before I gravitated to certain types of music. No one I've ever seen for therapy has seemed to think it's a bad thing. Doesn't mean they're right of course, but I feel like it's saved me on many occasions and I see lots of other posts on YouTube saying the same."
depression,ffeldnk,t3_et709c,1579852967.0,"Good job! I would never feel comfortable enough to do that even though I've always loved video games, but I'm thankful for a lot of the people who make content (despite the way Google treats creators). Sometimes finding a creative outlet like that really helps people."
depression,ffejxsk,t3_et71qe,1579851114.0,"I don't cry, so I'm probably broken in some way, but some types of sad music whether it's instrumental (mostly video game music) or rap do make me feel very emotional."
depression,ffe7lj0,t3_et3ovi,1579838859.0,"I think I see what you're saying. It really sucks that a lot of people don't give a fuck about mental illness or other issues with the brain and it's unfair. I have seen a lot of people who don't normally care about other people suddenly be very empathetic when someone has cancer for example. 

Still, I do think there are even a lot of physical things no one cares about. For example, I've had debilitating chronic pain for over half my life that affects what I can do physically and mentally and no one notices or gives a fuck just like they don't with my disorders. They just assume I'm lazy and fully capable or that nothing is wrong with me. Even when I went to the ER for something else, my dad was just mad that he would be starting work late and was taking medication and blamed the problem on me taking medication (he's very anti-medicine). The nurse was a ***** too, but the doctor was a decent person after it took a long time to be seen.

I still think your point stands though about mental illness. It's always interesting that most people don't care until after someone commits suicide."

I don't know how to make the thoughts go away but I would imagine that most people wouldn't think that about you, and if you do find someone like that again, they're not the person to hang around. A lot of what people said in middle and high school probably isn't true."
depression,ffe0l7l,t1_ffbpot2,1579833598.0,"Easier said than done for sure, but that's good to hear that he's never indicated that. I think a lot of people place too much emphasis on accomplishments (perceived or real). Some people like being around someone who is genuine and not pretentious."

To be clear, I'm not suggesting they're cure alls as they don't work on all people unfortunately, but my preference is to do things where there is a greater chance of it helping, but I understand that other people feel differently. I haven't tried electroconvulsive myself, though, since it's not an option here unfortunately. Most people stick with anti-depressants and/or therapy of some sort."
depression,ffdxqnu,t3_et3fcx,1579831546.0,"I hate the political climate as well. There's so little nuance. Even though I identify with one side more than the other, I still have a lot of problems with both ends of the spectrum and see all kinds of cultic behavior. Call out the current president and you have TDS. Support universal healthcare and progressive taxation and you're a commie. Support Israel against Hamas and Hezbollah and you're right wing. Want ISIS to no longer terrorize anyone who doesn't follow their insane beliefs? You're a warmonger. Call out SJWs and identity politics and you're alt-right or a Nazi. Support genetically modified food, vaccines, and nuclear energy? You're a shill. Criticize other religions the same way you would Christianity? You're a racist bigot or phobe of some kind."
depression,ffdkiu4,t3_esyage,1579822816.0,"I would not recommend it. It's pseudoscience and not useful for anything, especially conditions involving the brain such as depression.

People like that were my ""friends"" too, but they're likely the ones with issues having to constantly put people down for social brownie points, not you. I'm sure it's really eating at you that they won't apologize. If they're still in your life in anyway (even online) cut them out if you can. I guess I don't really know how to get self esteem back but I bet you've at least got some good qualities and I know it takes a lot to go to college or do much of anything without friends."

It was in a somewhat joking way, but it annoyed me since i was often shit on for being quiet or shy throughout my life. Your experience would really piss me off. It sucks the negative assumptions people make about quiet people. Just remember that they're ignorant morons attacking other probably to try to look cool in front of their friends for social brownie points."
depression,ff4cqmd,t1_ff4b83h,1579560539.0,"Damn, sorry to hear that it hasn't been helpful. If it is just Tinder I would suggest trying the other major ones, but if you've already given others a shot then I don't know what to suggest. I've had a drought for a number of years and little success overall, but occasionally a bit of luck can strike if you happen to look at the right time. There are a lot of really judgmental people in online dating for some reason and few who are genuine, but it's unfortunately the main option available."
depression,ff49zu4,t3_ercc8c,1579558783.0,"It sucks being dismissed or demonized for that. Maybe you've tried already, but have you attempted online dating? If you want you can talk about it beforehand to screen people out who will dismiss you. It still hurts if someone rejects you there too, but it might be better than it happening in person.  I've barely had any relationships, but I dated someone for awhile who I learned was depressed right away and was glad she was open with me. I know there are people who are legitimately happy, but I'd rather someone be real and genuine regardless if it's negative or not. As for friends, I don't know, as I haven't had any luck with that myself, although some people recommend meet-up or support groups."

Putting it another way, if I lost my ability to see, and I found out that someone had lost their hearing, I'd feel horrible for them and I would feel lucky that didn't happen to me, yet that still wouldn't make me less distraught about losing my vision."
depression,ff2kirj,t3_era9hl,1579510354.0,"It's important to get the daily value, but there isn't sufficient evidence to suggest you need the megadoses some people try to push. In fact, high doses of certain vitamins can actually be harmful. If you're concerned about certain vitamins, you could get a test done to see if you're getting enough. Vitamin D could be low if you're rarely outside. Just be warned, though, even though it's good to make sure you're getting the appropriate amount, it won't necessarily improve your anxiety and depression (it didn't for me anyway)."
depression,ff2jocz,t3_era8lw,1579509188.0,"Agreed. It's not really a useful thing to say especially considering that there's pretty much always people who have things worse and others who have things better. You don't say to a person that has a broken arm, you could have no arm, instead, you try to solve the problem. Unfortunately, a lot of people are under the impression that mental illnesses are the fault of the individual who has them. Everyone has different genetics and environment, but that rarely is taken into consideration."

I have read a little about Armenian culture, but wasn't familiar with what you just mentioned. That's cool that they're supportive. I don't know why it's your co-workers' business anyway, but it does seem like too many invade personal privacy."
depression,ff2agps,t1_ff29rct,1579498676.0,"What happened was a guy made a post about a woman telling him to man up, and a woman who replied to his post told him that woman's behavior was because of toxic masculinity. Her comment received over 30 upvotes. I wish I had saved the link, as I don't remember the post title right now. That's not the only time I've seen the term used that way on the depression sub, and I see it frequently elsewhere online. I disagree that they vehemently oppose men being told to bottle up their feelings. The #maletears hashtag (mugs, shirts, etc.) was quite popular in the movement and I see popular blogs and respected people in the movement frequently disregarding or dismissing men's feelings."

Not to mention similar issues with friends and relationships."
depression,ff1up87,t3_er1qrp,1579486601.0,"I've not had a good experience mentioning it or anything else like my chronic pain either. Here's one example: Only mentioning it once after several months into dating got me deemed weak. The vast majority will not respect a guy if you have anxiety disorders either. I'd say 95% of dating profiles on places such as okcupid mention confidence as being very important. Not being bold is considered not masculine. Oh, and get this: A certain ""equality"" movement blames these judgments on ""toxic masculinity"" rather than admitting that both sexes are pretty damn shallow. I've even seen people using that term liberally on this sub (for example as an excuse for a woman telling a guy to man up) and getting dozens of upvotes."

The main reasons I started lifting weights back in the day were to cut down on bullying and to increase the chances of women being interested in me since I had my anxiety going against me and was often insulted for being skinny as well. I was eventually recommended to stop by a physical therapist and MD after I got severe chronic pain later in life, though. I still feel a lot of pressure to, but my days are already miserable enough as is."

depression,fewl5db,t3_eqpqzk,1579413286.0,"You're not alone. I have both exercised a lot, moderately, and not at all during my many years of depression, and vigorous exercise typically triggered suicidal thoughts. I can't do weights any more due to my already unbearable chronic pain (even opioids didn't help when I lifted), but back when I was doing it frequently for years it didn't help (it also didn't help with my sleep disorders). I don't mind someone suggesting it a single time, but it bothers me that they insist that it's effective with all individuals. Same with meditation. If even anti-depressants don't work on all individuals (even though they work on more than not), you'd think these people would realize that it doesn't necessarily help all people. I have encountered numerous people with PhDs that should know better. I've lately started walking again even though I need an expensive surgery to make it not suck (not the same issue as my chronic pain), but i also feel very depressed and isolated outside, not to mention very anxious when encountering people due to my bad anxiety and violent people I've encountered in the past."

depression,feefbo7,t3_eomc3t,1579032588.0,"I don't know how much it increases when you're off the pills, but I looked up the numbers for females and 50.5 is in the healthy BMI category. I don't know if a medical doctor told you you need to ""detoxify,"" but I know there are lots of scams out there that use this word and if they're hurting you and not medically necessary you should stop. I imagine it would really suck being obsessed with weight, but you're at a healthy weight. I don't know if you've been judged a lot, but if people are making negative comments they are not only rude but incorrect. If you really do gain so much weight that you're not in the range you want to be in off the pills, changing the amount of calories you consume and exercise can work, but I hesitate to suggest that since I don't know what you are off them.

I find those sorts of scales difficult as well. They have something similar for chronic pain, and while it would feel extremely high, I never wanted to be misleading so didn't know what to choose. Same with depression. The suicidal thoughts are more tricky, because that is something it's hard to know who to trust with. Up to you whether you want to do that or not. I think you should mention the eating disorder for sure. I don't have any experience with that, but I imagine it would have a major impact on the way you live your life.

Have you only started waking up drenched with sweat while on the medication? That is important to narrow down, so you know it's not some other health problem. With medication, it's always a gamble. Some you probably won't experience significant side effects and others you will. There are some people who experience that on certain medications. I know some I've taken I've had nasty side effects and ended up quitting, but others were more tolerable. If the side effects are unbearable, it would be best to try another. I know sometimes it's a difficult call, though, since it may actually be helping you, but it sucks when you're one of the unlucky ones that experiences a nasty side effect."

My parents blamed my depression on stopping going to church. I was a believer as a kid, but even not wanting to go to church sometimes wasn't an option or there would be physical consequences.

I did go to a Christmas gathering with my large family a couple years ago and felt pretty awkward there with all the Christian songs I was expected to sing (I don't feel comfortable singing, period) and the Bible verses.

It was all about ""How God gave his only son and died for you, Jesus loves you, etc."" I actually wouldn't care if they just read it along with their prayers they always do, but it was annoying that he said it was for me and my brother when he should know by now that we do not believe there is a god."
depression,fe663fr,t3_enrhnc,1578882623.0,"Having depression in no way means that someone is an SJW (not that they don't deserve help, either, though) if someone unfortunately gave you that impression. There are lots of people who're anti-SJW or neutral or who're also depressed and suicidal. Sorry that antidepressants and therapy aren't working so far. It's good that you're giving them a shot despite that. Anti-depressants help more people that not, but there are people who are resistant (my psychiatrist even acknowledged this). I would recommend giving them all a try for the proper duration as much of a pain in the ass it is, but it is possible that you are one of the unlucky ones like myself. Some people really seem to find help in therapy but that can be hit or miss too. It still may be worth trying other therapists, but I don't want to lie either and say it's all good, as I've been disappointed with mine.

Sorry that you feel isolated because of your skin color. I have heard people say stupid shit like ""only white people get depressed"" or it's only a ""first-world problem."" They're ignorant and wrong. There are loads of people of every ethnicity, race, sex, religion, atheist, etc. that are depressed, and it also exists all over the world. There are even studies from science journals showing this to be true.

Having read one of your comments below, you probably did the right thing stopping talking to the counselor if you can't trust her (I do not know how some of them get jobs). The pastor could be hit or miss. There do seem to be some who truly care about the people in their church (and care about other people period) but there are others who probably will just blame you for not having enough faith, doing the right things, etc. You could try once if you have no one else to talk to and just drop it if he's unhelpful. If you have any friends or trustworthy family members, try to let someone know what's going on. I'm assuming you're in high school, but once you're out, you could try joining a meetup or support group or something if that sounds doable for you."
depression,fe64189,t1_fe5sqpo,1578881296.0,"Looks like someone countered my up and downvoted your last post. This may or may not help depending on what your parents are like, but have you expressed to them that you feel worse when they bring up jobs and that you're not in a state to do one at this point? I guess you did say it's like talking to a wall so maybe not, but if you haven't it might be worth bringing up at least once to see how they react.

It always sucks when someone doesn't give an accurate self-representation. I mean maybe there are some that just have no clue what they're doing, but I'm sure it still is extremely disappointing when someone is not at all how they originally portrayed themselves. I also think it can be pretty hard to understand the other sex sometimes (both ways I mean) and what is and isn't a turnoff. If they're doing stuff like sending certain unwanted pics, though, then they should probably know better.

Sometimes it does seem to work out that way that holding back or putting some distance makes the other person suddenly more desirable. Not sure I'd personally recommend it, though, but it's up to you.

There wasn't physical abuse, but I definitely felt used and abused in other ways. It definitely made me more distrustful.

It's cool that you received supportive comments. It's hard to know what will happen online sometimes. I hope things get better with your family and that they'll stop pressuring you."
depression,fe5syq7,t3_enudv5,1578874259.0,"Definitely a ridiculous and stupid thing to say. The last girlfriend I had who was also depressed was very attractive and it's absurd to think that her smiling would magically make her problems go away. 

I've also been told that smiling will make it go away and even had a psychologist tell  me when I first came in, ""You're a tall good-looking guy, what do you have to complain about?"" I do think I'm lucky when it comes to height, don't think the good looking part is true, though, but even if it was it's a dumb thing to say."
depression,fe0xhf2,t3_enay1b,1578819856.0,"Don't mean to offend you if you're not an atheist, but in my opinion, no supposedly omnipotent deity worthy of any respect would have created this hellhole where people are abused and have all sorts of medical problems. It's too bad there are so many scumbag parents out there who try to justify their abuse with their religious or political beliefs too when really they're just shitty control freaks who should have never had kids. Hope you find a way to cope with your anxiety and ptsd."
depression,fe0v69a,t3_en7w5y,1578819084.0,"Sorry about the abuse you experienced, Your stepmom is trash, and hopefully if you do decide you want a girlfriend at some point you'll find an awesome lady. Definitely don't feel obligated, though, and just say right now you're not in a place where you want a relationship. You can use whatever reason you want, whether it's spending more time with hobbies or whatever goals you might have or just are satisfied kicking it solo or with your friends. Hopefully they have good intentions and are just of the mindset that relationships generally help people, but they really shouldn't be bothering you if it's something you don't want."
depression,fe0k51r,t1_fe0czbs,1578814788.0,"I'm not productive anymore (and haven't been for a long time), so I can relate on the motivation part. Last time I had much was after I graduated and had a horrible first relationship end and was suicidal for a long time, and saw some opportunity open up for my dream career and somehow found some temporary motivation, but that crashed and burned after giving it my all, but enough of that. Motivation just seems random sometimes like some idea will pop into your head when you feel like you have no hope.

That sounds really frustrating. I hope they don't truly believe that you're lazy. It really sucks having those kind of judgments thrown your way by family (or anyone for that matter).

It's unfortunate that you're in a place with immature childish guys. Who knows maybe it is a lot more common with males than I thought in general, though. I don't understand people like that. I consider the people that judgmental the real losers.

There's so much BS in online dating. I just didn't know what to suggest and thought you'd stand a good chance, but yeah, I guess if the selection sucks you can't do much about it. Yeah, it's definitely important to find someone who has a similar lifestyle no matter how hot they are. It gets old quick when you can never do anything you want.

It's pretty much impossible to say why he doesn't have feelings anymore unless he was willing to be upfront with you. I mean there definitely are people who are freaked out by people who are too clingy or desperate but it's hard to control feelings sometimes. Not sure if your city has a decent enough size population, but I would hope there's someone who will value your affection and reciprocate that also has the traits you desire.

You can definitely only go with how you feel on this. I guess one reason why I recommended trying to get past him is because my first relationship had a lot of horrible drama and I held false hope for far too long and was harassed for years later. It took me a long time to get over her and not feel the need to ever respond to another email (and fortunately she stopped texting due to moving back to her home country). That's awesome that you met through your favorite game. I hope it goes well if you decide to wait awhile longer.

I always worry the same when I make comments (especially long ones) since I also lack energy. Wasn't even sure that I should make an account, but over the past few weeks I thought about making my own post anyway so thought I would respond. Despite being drained, you didn't sound scatterbrained at all (and even if you did, that wouldn't make what you said less valid). If you go to college at some point when hopefully your depression has gone away, I don't think you'll have a problem when it comes to writing. Thank you for the wishes."
depression,fe0e08u,t3_en3vvo,1578811404.0,"I'm not a big fan of Reddit in the first place, but I get pretty pissed off (and more depressed) when I see what people often write about people with mental illnesses. Word of advice to people here: stay away from the comments on dating subreddits or at least disregard the rubbish they spew."
depression,fe0dmwk,t3_en795u,1578810992.0,"If you absolutely hate it, it's not worth going into, but if you think it will be a satisfying career it could be worth missing out on some things temporarily (as much as it sucks). You won't suddenly become a granny or too old to date at 30. You also don't have to give up your carefreeness. It'll be serious at your job, but act the same as you would now in your downtime if you'd like. It sounds like you're probably really busy now, but you could still try to find someone who's ok spending less time together temporarily."
depression,fe0cyks,t3_eneqq1,1578810263.0,"Depression often makes it harder to find motivation, but there are many factors for what you have observed. A lot of people are willing to try medication, and it does help for more people than not, but there are people who due to their genetics it has no effect on. Likewise, therapy can also be helpful and is worth trying, but some people don't receive adequate help and/or there are just poor therapists in their area. Same with exercise, some people benefit from it, but for other people it doesn't improve their depression and in some cases even makes it worse. All three of the above are worth trying, however, but some people might not do them due to lack of insurance, funds, transportation, safety, etc. As for supplements, they are generally snake oil so aren't worth trying unless there is substantial evidence to demonstrate their efficacy. Some people are fine with trying anything, though, so more power to them if that's what they want to do, it's just important to make sure the substance they're taking isn't dangerous first."
depression,fe07uy9,t3_enfmlz,1578805406.0,"Damn, sorry that things have gotten to this state. It sounds like you were trying so hard with university and everything. I do understand not wanting to bring him down and it's completely reasonable for him to show you things he's excited about, but I also think he should try hard to listen to your complaints. I mean, most people have breaking points if someone is being cruel to them or something, but I think it's good to be able to have someone else to hear you out and comfort you. I mean you did make it sound like you were trying to open up to him more. Maybe you could talk again in a few days and talk about how you'll do your best to let him know what's going on in your head and let him know that it's never your intent to bring him down and it would just be really helpful to you if you could share your hardships and do the same for him if he needs it."
depression,fe06f0q,t3_emuied,1578804233.0,"Not sure if this will be helpful coming from a 35 year old male who is considered a loser by most (although if they inquired about my health, I would hope they'd realize their preconceived notions about me were unfair). When I was your age I had a number of problems (although not as many as now), but luckily, I was able to go to college, work, buy a car, etc. Despite this, I was still considered undateable then too since I lived at home some of the time, but I would have not considered anyone in a similar situation to you a loser because you lived at home, didn't have a job or go to school, etc. Other guys I've known did not think any less of girls in similar circumstances to you. I personally would not have cared even if you weren't depressed.

I don't get the passion a lot of people have for life either. Good for you for still trying to shower and stuff. It's hard to figure out how to hang in there, don't feel bad about playing video games or browsing the Internet.

That's good to hear that your parents love you, although it sucks they don't fully understand (unfortunately most who haven't experienced depression don't). You're not a disappointment. Try to be easier on yourself and ignore judgmental assholes if they really do (wrongly) think you're a loser.

Although I understand what it's like to be into someone and them not feeling the same, I highly recommend trying to find another guy. It's going to hurt a lot and may take a lot of time, but I think you'll be better off by persevering on the online dating scene. Since you mentioned him being far, those types of relationships also often don't work out. I'm not sure what sites you tried, but if it was just Tinder or something you might want to try OKCupid (unless you just want a hook-up). If you haven't tried messaging anyone, I recommend giving it a shot. A lot of women have heard that they'll be considered desperate, but it's not true, and probably only the most shallow men will think that. Of course you have to be prepared for rejection, though. I don't message often unless the person has similar interests and doesn't seem overly judgmental, but I did this week after I found that I matched with someone who surprisingly previously liked my profile. She didn't respond (I think my joke was too cheesy), so I felt even more down about myself and am not sure why she liked my profile to begin with, but I'll just keep an eye out and hope someone I like comes along. Just warning you that it's not easy, but I still think if you give it long enough it'll happen. I guess I don't know much about you, but when I was your age, I would have loved to have met someone who sounds as nice as you and likes video games and cats. I still hope to meet someone who's similar in my age group.

Oh, also, I don't know if you play any games online, but you could try to meet guys that way too or on game forums if you're just fed up with online dating.

Anyway, I hope things improve for you. You're not a loser, and neither are the other people who've responded to your post in similar predicaments. It's better to be a ""loser"" anyway, than some of the greedy scumbags wreaking havoc here and elsewhere in the world."
