It's solidly put together, has a workable number of finger controls, is about half the price of the X-56 and you could generally do worse. It doesn't make sense to drop $500 on a Warthog, then two years later drop $1200 on an import HOTAS. It doesn't *really* make sense to drop $250 on an X-56 either in those circumstances, unless you are completely fed up with trying to make a very low end stick do things it simply can't."
hotas,ff9ay0s,t3_esdc93,1579708826.0,">How much of an issue do the internals become in the Warthog? How long are the switches going to last? It would get light/moderate use at first as I get into it

You would probably find the Warthog to be a completely serviceable setup that would perform fine for years and years of use. In the same vein, if you've never owned a HOTAS before and you're not 100% sold on it, an X56 is (in comparison to a VR rig) a small investment and a good kicking off point to see if you want to dive off the deep end.

When dealing with any enthusiast community it's important to remember that justifying a $2000 purchase to yourself is just as important as the actual function and one of the easiest ways to do that is to tear down competition and insist that small or minuscule tradeoffs make something completely unusable. Don't get carried away in people's gushing about how ""unusable"" a Warthog is or how ""garbage"" any of its parts are. The only reason they are saying these things now is because they have a higher standard to aspire to. Many in the flight sim community were perfectly content with it when it was the top of the line. Many still are.

Since VKB/Virpil are not likely to start selling through Amazon any time soon (at least none of the good stuff, just the tiny, monobutton stuff that you honestly might as well just buy a Logitech 3D instead of) I'd be looking pretty hard at the Warthog in your position. Alternatively you could get an X56 as a stopgap and pick up some [other peripherals](https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-Cougar-Flight-Control-Panels/dp/B002HH9TRY) for the extra buttons, which will serve you well if you jump up into a Belarusian import."
