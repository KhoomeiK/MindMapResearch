gtaonline,ffhwama,t1_ffhj2i5,1579956791.0,"Loooool no, u afraid of people with bounties on them? Don't be, most ones I see are low levels that stole cars.. , bounty doesn't mean griefer, you need to keep an eye on the feed above the minimap, it'll show whether the bounty was given to them buy a actual person or just by an npc for stealing a car, and same with mental state.. you dont have to kill players to get a high mental state.. you can kill NPC's, the mental state doesn't show if your registered as a CEO, MC president or if you have a bounty, but don't go being afraid of players based on what there icons look like.. a random guy with a normal white icon can just come and kill you, treat every player as if the are a potential threat, not saying shoot them on sight because some are friendly like me, but try to avoid them and if someone is chasing you check what they are driving, but if someone chases me while I'm selling I'll kill them regardless"
