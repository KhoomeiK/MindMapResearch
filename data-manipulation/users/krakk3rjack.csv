I use the word may because as history has proven, not everything we're told is safe is safe. Scientists once thought smoking was good. Where's the research showing spraying of aluminium, barium and strontium into the upper atmosphere is safe for us and the environment?? These dudes used to set off fucken nuclear bombs without understanding the long term effects of what they were doing. Babies are still being born deformed today in the Pacific islands.

Your idea of what chemtrails do and mine appear to be different. You're looking it from the perspective that it's only crazies who believe in it. I'm looking at it from the point that there are experiments and operations being carried out in the upper atmosphere. I don't know exactly what the effects of the said experiments are, but I want to know because I have a human right to breathe.


I'm skeptical because these people's hubris into thinking they can alter the entire atmosphere of a planet and think they know it all is just amazing..
