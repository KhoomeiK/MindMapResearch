In a Legends Episode they were doing what they do best and screwing up time and history, and they accidentally left a beebo doll from the future near some Vikings who just landed in America, who ended up creating Christmas and worshiped the doll instead of Jesus. Replacing Christmas with Beebo Day, the team travels back to the present day to see they made a huge mistake and now everything is all wonky. They fixed it but Beebo becomes a cult icon among fans and continually is dropped or referenced in the show.

In one of the Legends finales, they have to gather the totems to Summon a strong monster to defeat a demon and everyone imagined Beebo so they make a giant B to fight the demon and are successful. Ever since then he's shown up randomly across all the shows as a nod to the fans."

Infultraiting our online communities, labeling our protest as terrorist, throwing the race card back at us, whatever they do we just need to come together and stay strong.

Instead of it just ignoring what it's use to and only giving you a mild high.
