They're generally better and safer interfaces for in car use than using your phone directly for GPS, Music, messaging, etc, and much better than car GPS systems. But only a few german luxury cars have wireless CarPlay support. Until wireless is AA/CarPlay is standard in cars, and has been for a few years, I think people would be hesitant to switch to a phone that doesn't allow car connectivity by wire."
gadgets,ffj6pmj,t1_ffieoma,1579991773.0,"To be fair, I don't think I've plugged a phone into a computer since before phones had wireless charging. When I plug in, it's to charge, either with a wall or car charger.

I'm an Android user (S10), but until wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are common, I don't see anyone (including Apple) ditching charging ports altogether. I know wireless CarPlay is available in a few German Luxury cars, but until it's been adopted in mainstream cars for a few years, I think losing car connectivity alone would cost Apple a lot of phone sales.

Apple already switched their laptops and iPads to USB C years ago. I think we'll see them switch the iphone to USB C for a few years before they ditch the port altogether."

mazda,ffcizjp,t1_feo5x6v,1579800479.0,"FWIW, their EPA rating is a little underrated (like all diesels). But yes, the fuel economy is a letdown when there are larger, much more powerful V6 diesel crossovers with similar fuel economy.

Probably doesn't help that it's only available in the Signature trim and has a starting price of $42k, $4k more than the quicker Signature 2.5t. Not to mention the US's general stigma for diesels (outside of heavy duty applications) and the higher cost of maintenance.

spotted,ff9f7sa,t1_ff98xq9,1579711730.0,"Yeah, I think their reasoning was that they wanted to continue to improve upon the performance, and the mid engine layout really allows for much better balance and handling, as well as better traction for the drive wheels. The base car is already putting down decent track improvements over the C7, but I dont think well see the extent of the improvement in chassis limitations until the Z06 and ZR1 models are released (side note- rumor is the ZR1 model will be an AWD hybrid setup with nearly double the power of the base C8). Corvette has always been a great sports car for the money, and I think the C8 definitely continues that tradition, even if it does so in new ways."

television,ff2xhpp,t1_ff2uz6e,1579527749.0,"Depends on the bitrate?

Blu Rays can support up to 40 Mbit/s, which is 18GB per hour. Most standard BD movies are somewhere in the 28-34 Mbit/s range. UHD Blu Rays have a max bitrate of 100 Mbit/s (45 GB per hour). Compare that to Neflix, with a max bitrate of 5.8 Mbit/s for HD streams and 15.6 Mbit/s for 4k streams. Discs also use lossless sound compression, which is a huge advantage for audio fidelity.

Granted, the difference isn't as big as it looks based on bitrate because the streaming files are compressed, but you do lose quality with the compressed format. Compression is ideal for streaming because of the amount of data saved, but it's definitely not the same quality as you'd get on a disc.

Edit: Mbps to Mbit/s"

pics,ff24v1z,t1_fezqffs,1579493863.0,"Not that surprising really. Most Chick-Fil-As have really efficient drive thrus and are packed during meal times. The fact that they have several parking spaces helps tremendously (when its busy, the window is basically just for payment unless your order happens to be ready). And all the locations around me have 2 or 3 people taking orders on iPads, in addition to the regular intercom system, and a few people just running orders out to cars. So while most drive thrus have 2 people working them when its busy (window one doing orders and payment and window 2 handing the food), CFA might have 9 or 10 people working their drive thru (plus a system that lets fast orders bypass slow orders).

They tend to make your food really fast, and you can usually expect to get your food in less than 5 minutes even if a line is wrapped around the building. Honestly even though this is quick, I'm kind of surprised the record isn't more than this. My local CFAs probably pump out about 2 cars a minute every day at meal times and they only have a single drive thru line."

I actually haven't read the comic since Negan was introduced either. I've read through compendium 2 (first 96 issues). It was still solid, I'm just not buying them at cover price, and the last time I really thought about the Walking Dead, compendium 3 wasn't out yet.

mildlyinteresting,fexlikg,t1_fewt69g,1579432953.0,"There are coke bottling plants everywhere. Over 900 plants running worldwide, 71 in the US. Even so, transportation and distribution is by far their biggest expense. Its not just the cost of the product itself and overhead at the plant, they have a fleet of vehicles, fuel, drivers, salesmen, and merchandisers, not to mention retailer costs and overhead. And thats just from the plant to your door. There are plenty of corporate level expenses too, like market research, product R&D, advertising, and lawyers.

Not sure about where you live, but its priced pretty similarly here in FL, but its almost always on sale, either BOGO or buy 2 get 1 free. So realistically, its priced to still make them a decent profit margin when buy 1 get 1 free, and thats when most people buy it. Even though retail may be $5, average price paid is probably closer to $3-4, and a bit of that money goes into every step of the supply chain while still leaving coke with a net profit margin of around 20%"

AskReddit,feum25d,t1_feugfl4,1579387832.0,"I get that 28 Days Later is basically a zombie movie, but when you start blurring lines like that, there's no end. What if they're acting crazy and attacking but not biting or eating people? What if they're just acting insane but not generally violent towards people? What if they just have a virus like the flu? Are movies like Contagion and Outbreak now considered zombie movies?

If we're counting that, 28 Days Later is pretty solid. I'd definitely rank Train to Busan, the original Dawn of the Dead, and Shawn of the Dead as better movies, but I'm not even a zombie movie person and I can actually appreciate 28 Days Later and even rewatch it from time to time."
mildlyinteresting,feui5e4,t1_fetrpg0,1579386761.0,"They don't. A cane doesn't tell them where they're going or how to get there, knowing where they're going does.

The cane is just a guide to help them sense their surroundings just like how you see. They can feel objects in the way, feel the edges of the sidewalk (keeping them straight and off the street), and feel curbs and crosswalks. If they can feel these things out, they can find their way someplace (either with directions or by memory) just like you can by looking and seeing.

Assistive technologies these days can help too.

Also, generally a longer wavelength is better for fog, snow, and rain. Our eyes adjust to yellow light much quicker, theres less glare, and it doesnt strain your eyes as much as white.

The main convenience isn't the saving of time and effort. It's the smoothie shop being in the right place at the right time (because it's right next to where you work, by your gym, along your shopping route, etc), when you otherwise probably aren't going to have a smoothie.

A big selling point on the Accord for me was that it was affordable with a manual transmission and was a decent cross between fun and practical.

Not particularly cheap, but not awful considering the first 40 miles per day will be all electric (at a fraction of the cost of gas), with excellent fuel economy after that, plus Toyota has an excellent track record with hybrid reliability, and the 300+ hp powertrain should actually be quick and responsive.

television,ff2xhpp,t1_ff2uz6e,1579527749.0,"Depends on the bitrate?

Blu Rays can support up to 40 Mbit/s, which is 18GB per hour. Most standard BD movies are somewhere in the 28-34 Mbit/s range. UHD Blu Rays have a max bitrate of 100 Mbit/s (45 GB per hour). Compare that to Neflix, with a max bitrate of 5.8 Mbit/s for HD streams and 15.6 Mbit/s for 4k streams. Discs also use lossless sound compression, which is a huge advantage for audio fidelity.

Granted, the difference isn't as big as it looks based on bitrate because the streaming files are compressed, but you do lose quality with the compressed format. Compression is ideal for streaming because of the amount of data saved, but it's definitely not the same quality as you'd get on a disc.

So while most drive thrus have 2 people working them when its busy (window one doing orders and payment and window 2 handing the food), CFA might have 9 or 10 people working their drive thru (plus a system that lets fast orders bypass slow orders).

They tend to make your food really fast, and you can usually expect to get your food in less than 5 minutes even if a line is wrapped around the building.

The only thing like that I've ever heard specific about cat whiskers is that you aren't supposed to cut them if you cut your cat's hair, since they use them for balance."

One day, Pornhub was sending out free stickers as a promotional thing, and I thought it would be funny to order one and put it on his car.

Turns out, I was right. His dad was the first one to notice the sticker."

My parents still have an incredible rate of 3.3% at their credit union (which unfortunately I can't be a part of) on their checking account. I think that's actually down from last year as well though."

They might make exceptions for storms like that though, or they may just not care since weigh stations are probably shut down. Not really sure what the rules are, I just know what I've seen."

AskReddit,fcniqqt,t1_fcm8yfr,1577812497.0,"Time and effort aren't really the same as convenience though. Making a smoothie and washing a blender takes less time than going to a smoothie shop, parking, waiting in line, ringing up, waiting for them to make it, and getting back to what you were doing. It also doesn't take much more effort (if any).

The main convenience isn't the saving of time and effort. It's the smoothie shop being in the right place at the right time (because it's right next to where you work, by your gym, along your shopping route, etc), when you otherwise probably aren't going to have a smoothie. The biggest irony might be that if those smoothies were anywhere near as healthy as most people think they are, they probably wouldn't want them at all. The healthier options (like low calorie veggie smoothies) aren't usually what people are after."

mazda,fclh026,t1_fclfbfj,1577747579.0,"Yeah, I also don't plan on buying another car anytime soon. The plan is to keep the Accord for at least 10+ years, but I like to keep an eye on the auto market in case anything happens to it (plus I just find cars interesting and like to know what's out there). In the mean time, I'll probably get another motorcycle to scratch the fun itch."
mazda,fcle3mp,t1_fclc3vp,1577745675.0,"The estimates I've seen just say low 30s for the starting price, so that was just a guess on my end. I haven't really looked into it much or considered it, nor do I see myself getting one, but if something happens to my car it could be a possibility.

A big selling point on the Accord for me was that it was affordable with a manual transmission and was a decent cross between fun and practical. I'm now at a point where I could afford a larger, more practical car (especially if it was also more efficient), and still afford a second fun car (like a Miata), and really end up with the best of both worlds."
mazda,fclayup,t1_fcl85l2,1577743657.0,"Yeah, I've seen that. I'm honestly more of a hatchback/car person, and not generally interested in crossovers or Toyota, but the Rav4 plug in actually looks like a very compelling vehicle.

It should start in the low 30s though (probably within $1k of the CX9 GT's price). Not particularly cheap, but not awful considering the first 40 miles per day will be all electric (at a fraction of the cost of gas), with excellent fuel economy after that, plus Toyota has an excellent track record with hybrid reliability, and the 300+ hp powertrain should actually be quick and responsive.

Plus, not sure if they do the same sort of rebates on this sort of vehicle, but when I bought my current car (2018 Accord) in 2017, Toyota was already offering 0% financing on top of $4k back on the just released 2018 Camry. Toyota in general has excellent rebates."
mazda,fckthgc,t1_fcknql4,1577732838.0,"Honestly, if it wasn’t for the massive plastic cladding (also present on the CX-30 and a lot of other compact crossovers), I’d think it looks pretty good.

From the projected numbers though, it looks like it will have a hard time competing with other electric crossovers with nearly double the range and ~60-110 more hp for similar money."
