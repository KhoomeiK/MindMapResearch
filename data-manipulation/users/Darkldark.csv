But the reason we hunt is research and the damage they have done, like in mh4u gogmazios a really cool elder dragon was killed, because he plundered a human towns warehouse, but he feeds on gunpowder and doesnt have any evil intentions. Just like a starving kid stealing bread and for that getting killed."

2. From the perspective of someone reading a probably fictional story:
This is a perfect depiction of human emotions, the feeling of being undecisive and the repercussions in form of death, the traumatic experiences a mistake can do with humans, the solution we seek and the traumatic experience catching us inmidst of our healing process, tearing open the cocoon we form to forget, so our only escape left would be to overcome.

3. Thanks for sharing the story with us and try to experiment, observe and learn.
If you experience something post it here we will help"
