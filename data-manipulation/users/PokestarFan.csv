Cringetopia,ffj050p,t1_ffizz2j,1579987038.0,"I literally quoted the NHS. You know what else is a medical condition that can be treated that's not an illness? Pain. You shouldn't be feeling pain, and you can treat pain with painkillers. Another example is insomnia, which you can take pills for. You're the only one that's speaking bullshit. 

Also it doesn't always need treatment. It can **sometimes** be treated."

>While biological sex and gender identity are the same for most people, this is not the case for everyone. For example, some people may have the anatomy of a man, but identify themselves as a woman, while others may not feel they're definitively either male or female.  
>  
>This mismatch between sex and gender identity can lead to distressing and uncomfortable feelings that are called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, for which treatment is sometimes appropriate. **It's not a mental illness.**"
