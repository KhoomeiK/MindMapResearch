2007scape,ffgng65,t1_ffew5w2,1579910325.0,Just put it in next week’s update. Ranarr seed’s prices are going up stupidly high as is and the poll was to let containers get what they would pickup automatically placed inside of them. This by its very nature includes thieving from farmers.

I suggested diaries simply because of the varying things needed to complete them making would be botters less likely to do them."

They used it to pull viewers in and catch their attention and now that isn't as needed due to being well established on TV."

Honestly he also comes off as the most redeemable of the bunch. Looking at his whole story what's the worst that he's actually done? Get drunk and make an ass out of himself but none of it is as malicious as the other main characters."

Getting scammed out of my mithril armor while fishing in Catherby and following the dude up white wolf mountain having a casual conversation and not understanding what just happened. Hating mage training academy the day it came out because it was, and still is, poorly designed dogshit. Getting an ava’s device on release and thinking it was pimp as shit. Dope as shit CW games that were always packed and the only gear was barrows and ancients, bonus points because it was Saturday so Toonami had Naruto playing(fucking cringe)."
