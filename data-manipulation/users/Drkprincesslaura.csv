CatsWhoChirp,ffdd8q5,t3_esdk07,1579818432.0,Omg I love this!!! Chattering and chirping are one of my favorite things about cats. The other is when they sniff and their mouth hangs open.

AmItheAsshole,ffcnbye,t3_eqlbl1,1579803110.0,I'm just now seeing this post. Have you been able to talk with him? You are definitely NOT TA. How disrespectful of your MIL and your husband. I hope you are recovering well otherwise.
bridezillas,ffckwcg,t1_ffcknid,1579801633.0,It's easy to when you're used to reading posts with ages. Half the time I end up blindly reading over it.

breakingmom,ff8gw1o,t3_es212g,1579677938.0,"I'm a horribly picky eater. Idk how my son came out if me because so far, he eats just about EVERYTHING at 14 months. But, I'll take some choco chip pancakes!!"
ChoosingBeggars,ff8gpvv,t1_ff6w4e0,1579677715.0,The one I went to only had the free tootsie rolls. I feel so ripped off.

FireEmblemHeroes,ff8g7hl,t3_es6jae,1579677073.0,I want Volug or Giffca. But the chances of that happening are slim.
FireEmblemHeroes,ff8g45d,t1_ff8frgj,1579676960.0,But I can still see the post? I'm confused

aww,ff8abfy,t1_ff89b5l,1579670747.0,I'll see if I can find it on that F book site. Because I saw it there after seeing it here. There is confirmation of the doggo being deaf and partially blind.
toptalent,ff8a0rp,t3_es3tgm,1579670467.0,Talk about going through hoops for an achievement!
ffxiv,ff6z9jt,t1_ff6z2rr,1579637950.0,Ahh ty! I may have forgotten that detail since I obtained the class at 3 am lol
FinalFantasy14,ff6q2gn,t1_ff6oxv1,1579632508.0,"Apparently we started in Siren. So I won't be of any help. Sorry! My bf won't be home until probably about 5:30 so if no offers by then, I can ask him. =)"
FinalFantasy14,ff6p84v,t1_ff6oxv1,1579632004.0,I just pulled in to the house. Let me get the kiddo in his pack n play and I'll check. I think we started on Lamia and moved to Adamentoise(?) My bf would know the spelling better lol

JUSTNOMIL,ff6jg59,t1_ff6343f,1579628500.0,"I just seriously almost cried. I work for a Chinese restaurant and they treat me like family. My boss' parents I call mom and dad because I can't pronounce their names, but ""mom"" even gave me some money for my son for Christmas. She gives me money every year for Chinese New Year. And go figure, I originally got the job part time because of my nail lady. It's her family that owns the restaurant. I'm full time now but it's amazing how welcoming they've been. They even love my bf."
raisedbynarcissists,ff68vhx,t1_ff5v8wd,1579621873.0,Thank you! I was picked on in elementary and middle school so I in turn decided I would treat people better than I'm treated. I'm a total bleeding heart lol But this has also given the cause for people to walk all over me.
raisedbynarcissists,ff5dx5l,t1_ff5dqme,1579588796.0,My mom did it once because I blocked it off and she was going through menopause. She was horrified after. She immediately went to her Dr about it. I fortunately wasn't RBN but I do have them in my life. This sub has definitely pointed that out to me. I'm here in case I can be of any comfort to anyone.
raisedbynarcissists,ff5anmp,t1_ff5aase,1579585387.0,"The normal joke is: why did the chicken cross the road? The answer is to get to the other side. 

So in this case, the ""road"" is any boundary anyone might have. ""Don't come in my room without knocking."" Narc comes in every time without knocking. 

Why did the Narc cross the road? Because it was something you didn't want them to do."
AmItheAsshole,ff4s5gb,t1_ff3zmgh,1579571139.0,"I just read this response to my bf.  His response? 

""OH FUCK NO! Fuck her family and fuck his family.""

And let me tell you, he rarely swears. 

NTA my dear. PLEASE cancel. If they get mad, it's their own fault. Wake up early tomorrow and cancel, cancel, cancel!!"

TalesFromFastFood,ff44fl5,t3_erjptp,1579555310.0,"Good grief. Although in regards to frozen food at the grocery store, there are chicken tenders which are like a bigger/skinnier version of chicken nuggets and then there are chicken strips. Which are flatter/longer pieces of chicken. So maybe that's what he had in mind."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,ff3wr8q,t3_er85z8,1579550534.0,"And we love you!! We have one customer who tips $20-$25 dollars every time. And sometimes they order every weekend.
