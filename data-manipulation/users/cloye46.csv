CasualConversation,ffr13ge,t3_eumznr,1580148141.0,"Okay so I hate driving, I’ve never liked it and I felt so anxious when I first started. My sister always loved it and imagined herself in the car but I never did. All I can really say is that eventually it becomes secondhand to you, it’s really just about common sense. Turning will become natural. The feel of everything will become a habit once you start doing it on your own. The transition between permit driving and driving alone is a world of difference. Be careful and use your blinkers and brain!!"
