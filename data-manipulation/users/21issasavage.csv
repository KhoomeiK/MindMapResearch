cscareerquestions,ff41h83,t1_ff40dl1,1579553484.0,"If theres an email thread between you I would use that as leverage that's what I did, recruiters email alot of people so if you reply to the same email they sent you they'll hopefully remember who you are. For example, after being rejected by a company (where I talked to the recruiter) I emailed her in my last semester and let her know that I'm interested in a specific position and she was really helpful"
cscareerquestions,ff4183w,t1_ff40hfo,1579553328.0,"Thanks for the response, it's not about bigger being better it's more that I've always wanted to work for a big 4, the scale of the projects you'll work on and the millions of people that will use the things that you implement really excites me"

cscareerquestions,ff3ysas,t3_erhcff,1579551806.0,"It's very important, even though I got my internship on my own, I had a few friends refer me to companies they work at. From my experience this aalways results in someone looking at ur resume and almost always gets you a phone interview.  It's up to you from there to do well but getting a good word from someone who works there helps. I recently graduated and one thing I'd advise is to keep in touch with people in your major  and know where they work so that if you need a referral they could help"

ColoradoSprings,fdhterv,t1_fdh7c8x,1578429831.0,Maybe we could! Did you end up staying in the springs out of convenience? I kind of have a vague short term plan which involves working for this company for 6 months or so to get some experience whilst continuing looking for work in the Denver area. I also have a few friends in foco that can hopefully refer me to one of the companies they're at.
ColoradoSprings,fdh4ofn,t1_fdgx6ew,1578415308.0,Would you say you're happy you made the move out of foco ? Ideally I wanna be in Denver but the only offer I have rn is in the springs so I plan to stay there until I find something else
