canada,ff68emo,t3_ertwkj,1579621568.0,"Hey there, go to an Alberta supports office. The one at Northgate Mall is a bit more chill. 

Bring all of your documents in regards to applying for EI. Make sure you get there first thing in the morning as they are super busy. They can help you out with a one time payment and then it will be garnished from your employment insurance once it gets approved. 

Also reach out to the food bank online to get a hamper if food is scarce. 

All the best."
