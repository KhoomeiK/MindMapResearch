finance,ffim24i,t1_ffggru1,1579977119.0,Forced diversity is generally a sign of being to close to the problem to effectively create change. There will always be competent and qualified people from every walk of life. If you’re not attracting them then you’re the problem. People as a whole are notorious for our inability to self reflect on our own weaknesses and short comings. I find the higher up the power structure of an organization you travel the inability for managers and directors to recognize when THEY are the problem becomes significantly higher. Their abilities and instincts have served them well to this point so they don’t see how their ways of thinking and doing things could be a contributing factor.
