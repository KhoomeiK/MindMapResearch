ForeverAlone,fft5f8x,t3_ev0bda,1580208065.0,I dread ever seeing my face on photos or on camera. Especially at an angle it looks horrible. The difference between mirror and real life is staggering.

Documentaries,fffjafd,t3_eta0vq,1579885171.0,"This complete and utter disregard of human life that was so prevalent among the Soviets has always made me sick. It was so random and unpredictable. Everyone could be the next victim. And in many cases they didn't even bother to exterminate people in some quick and efficient (I dare not say humane) way, instead leaving them to die a slow and painful death."

ForeverAlone,ffbxfd2,t3_esp9ft,1579785885.0,Face rarely is the only cause unless you're deformed. How do you behave in public? What about your voice?
ForeverAlone,ffbqutt,t3_esmd2e,1579779082.0,">I have no hobbies or interests outside of gaming, which I know is super unattractive. Whenever I try picking up a new one, I get too frustrated/ lose interest and quit.

Many normies have no hobbies as well, other than consuming media/partying/travelling which actually are not hobbies at all.

>I dislike social media and smartphone culture

Actually a good sign. I know it's hard to find people who think the same in this fucked up narcissistic age, but trust me they are out there.

>Even if I were somehow invited, normie partying make me anxious. I'm sensitive to noise, so I dislike loud music and don't want to take part in any drinking/smoking  and don't want to take part in any drinking/smoking since addiction runs in my family. I've had relatives die of drug overdosage.

Drinking from time to time won't make you addicted on the spot, while it can help tremendously with socializing. Personally I can't stand such environments unless I'm drunk. But in the end it still accomplishes nothing, because people I stumble upon in such places almost never contact me afterwards and frankly most of them behave like animals.

Finding your crowd when you're in minority is tough. You'll have to search and search and search and have lots of patience, while simultaneously working on yourself so that you do not scare potential friends away.

But attracting mates still boils down to looks. Having friends increases your chances though by making you sociable and giving opportunities to meet new people. Not doing anything social outside of work/uni is the bane of many FAs, including me."
