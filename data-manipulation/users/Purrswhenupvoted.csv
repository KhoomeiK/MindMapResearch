ITCareerQuestions,ff2ds8z,t1_ff22z2s,1579502030.0,"It is possible to knock all 6 of the original out in 2 months. It is go at your own pace. The only parts that slow you down is peer graded pieces, Waiting for enough submissions for you to grade. While it’s not feasible for everyone, just know it’s possible. If you knock out all 6 they give you a 7th cert for it. so $100 for 7 certs makes it far more appealing. 
I hope that helps you because I 100% agree, paying monthly is stupid. It can also be highly motivating. Still stupid, but motivating."
