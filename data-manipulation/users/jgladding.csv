Sometimes the owner is too lazy to fix it up but a lot of times you get owners who don't realize they own a property (inheritance), or they live very far away and don't realize how bad its gotten. Tenants won't let them know in fear of rent increases.  


Sometimes the owner dies and there is no clear transfer of ownership. So it decays - and takes years before it gets bad enough that people look in to it."
