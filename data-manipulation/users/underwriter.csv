AskReddit,fexzh3v,t3_eqpqjr,1579438771.0,"I was completely broke and at rock bottom about 10 years ago. I was surfing craigslist gigs and found one offering $800 to clean out this guys back yard. It was filled with construction debris and I had a van, so I figured easy money. 

I drove ~1 hour to the property and immediately realized I was in over my head. A smarter person would have brought a second guy but I was not that smart. It took me 8 hours of work and I loaded the van full at least 20 times. 

The fucked up part is the guy gave me directions to an empty lot where he had permission to move the debris. I found out after he just had me illegally dump shit on some random property, so I almost went to jail or had a huge fine for doing this gig.

TLDR: Guy gave me $800 to break several environmental laws"

There were pristine depression-Era $100 bills neatly placed under the rug. We counted them out, it was nearly $8000 in all and I'm not even sure if any would be worth more due to rarity. 

We surprised the old woman with the money, she broke down crying.  Her (now deceased) husband had apparently been hiding the money for a rainy day and she never knew. Either that or he was robbing banks. She gave us quite a tip, about $1000 each"
