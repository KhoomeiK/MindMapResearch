So you can have sniper missions and battles across buildings. The ability to repel and smash through the sides of glass skyscrapers not because a mission called for it, but because you feel like it. Have all the classic JDM cars and insane ways to customise them so nobody’s car looks the same.

GTA VI will have to bring some major major content in a huge open world. Because that’s what we’ve come to expect, now we just need it one bigger.

Back when I worked in retail I had a resume come through a for a Christmas casual. Kid was 17, but on his resume he had put down that he had a Cert IV in Retail Management. This threw up red flags because he was still in school, his social media profiles showed he was a bit of a party goer who didn’t look like he went to school let alone did a qualification and this was his first ever job. We later got it out of him it was total bullshit 

Speaking of social media. You probably already know, but lock up your profiles a bit. We’re fine to see you go to parties and have a good time. But we don’t want to see you black out drunk in a bush or having a line of coke. 

For the most part the only thing I took away from resumes was their name and how old they were. I cracked quite a lot of information out them during the interview. People get nervous, it’s a good time to grill them, they tend to say the truth because they’re panicking too much to fabricate a lie. 

Out of the 18 applications I got for that Christmas casual position that year. I actually hired the kid with the least amount of qualifications. Simply because he handled himself well in the interview, he was dressed well, was clear and concise with his answers and showed a genuine interest in getting the job, not just because he got paid, but because this was the start of his working life. He was ready to dive in and get going."
