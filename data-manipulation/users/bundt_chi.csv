nova,ff84m1f,t1_ff81x7t,1579665852.0,This should be higher up. I think it's getting better but it still can be shit show most days.
Costco,ff48600,t1_ff40nfh,1579557636.0,If it's plastic how would it scratch metal?  There's definitely a groove there.  Maybe the plastic shield had a rock or something stuck in it?
Costco,ff3zoss,t1_ff3yriu,1579552372.0,Thanks for doing the AMA and your honest feedback !
Costco,ff3ygko,t1_ff3whrl,1579551600.0,"Thanks for the response.  Yes the pictures are from the following day after the service and the timestamps should reflect as such.  It was leading up to holidays, crazy work schedule and prior to traveling with the family so I took the pics as soon as I could knowing they might be useful later.

Maybe it was a new guy or something but yeah I wouldn't have expected that from Costco.

Again thanks for the validation and feedback.  I will try to make it back there this week to speak to the AGM but had I done it right away, what do you think they would have done after a 3rd party review ?  Replace the wheels ?  Offer to have the scratches buffed out ?   None of the scenarios seemed like they would have been quick or straightforward and at the end of the day worth the hassle.  Just sad mostly and disappointed."
Costco,ff3vi7q,t3_erd13x,1579549756.0,"I had my tires recently done at Costco and noticed a ring around ALL 4 of my wheels just under an inch from around the edge.  I assumed this was some leftover adhesive or something regarding breaking or setting the bead but once I got home and tried scratching it off with my finger nail it became immediately obvious when mounting my new tires they had scratched the wheels.  I was really disappointed by this and now it's over a month since it happened.  I didn't have the time to go back and speak to them about it (and quite frankly wasn't sure if anything would come  of it).

I don't really know what the best recourse is because they're obviously not going to replace the wheels and it's a cosmetic issue but I'm still peeved about it.

Do you have any recommendations given the time that's past and the nature of the issue on how to go about getting some compensation or something ?  Ideally I would love if they just comp'ed me some money back for my troubles.  I'm not interested in numerous back and forth trips to deal with it as the time alone would negate any compensation or rectification of the situation.

Thanks for any advice.

HomeImprovement,fesg0pr,t3_eqdzkt,1579364797.0,"I had this ingenious idea but i couldn't get anyone with the right expertise to vet whether it would work or was harmful to my dog. 

My idea was to include small amounts of tonic in my dog's meals and use a blacklight to find all the poop in the yard and pick it up at night because between the sticks and leaves it's hard to distinguish without walking the whole yard very carefully what's poop and what's not. I guess having to do that with a blacklight doesn't really reduce the work that much..."
Costco,fcz1wvv,t3_ejk5c5,1578092014.0,I did the same thing. My wife refused to get on top and dry hump me though... you know for science.
todayilearned,fcotecv,t3_ei899o,1577841042.0,I was totally expecting the outcome at the end of the article to beef something along the lines of... and that folks is there story of how velveeta or cheez whiz came to be... or something similar to that.
pics,fcbaka6,t3_egshlk,1577584507.0,I need to see it next to a soda can for scale...
todayilearned,fcayv6m,t1_fcas9ce,1577579338.0,I was just thinking the same thing. I was pretty sure Fox fucked up Firefly as well. The whole show was built in amazing character development and Fox went against Whedon's wishes and aired episode 2 first instead of the pilot episode intended to set the stage for the character development...
todayilearned,fc9jtv5,t1_fc9bnin,1577553724.0,"Yeah slim on details,  makes no sense. Sounds like a dog died for no good reason...

Cobras are not known to pursue and chase you so leaving should have been simple enough.

EDIT: For those of you explaining the monsoon season and rains flooding out the cobras and them seeking refuge in the people's house. That shitty article says absolutely nothing about that. There's one paragraph surrounded by ads, links to other articles and an extremely annoying accept my cookies disclaimer. If that's the case then yes you're right that makes more sense. Too bad noone of that is in the linked article."
todayilearned,fbu7z98,t1_fbth8wl,1577109514.0,I came here to post the same. I've heard people say Donner but most lyrics I've seen write Donder.
