aww,ff8tbjj,t1_ff8t7c6,1579695309.0,They will flatten their necks out to appear larger and more intimidating. They can't flatten them out to the degree a cobra can but it's noticeable.
aww,ff8sx1c,t1_ff8s7w3,1579694858.0,This looks like a completely standard Western Hognose to me.  That's weird that your girlfriends Hognose snakes hiss and strike at you. Even the wild caught examples I had as a kid (when it was still legal to catch and keep them where I'm from)  always mellowed out after I'd handled them a few times. They would stop doing the cobra neck and playing dead as well after a while in captivity.
DiWHY,ff8s9zp,t3_es9kee,1579694113.0,"I made something similar for my sister a few years ago. I used a 3 foot piece of Indian Rosewood, artificially aged and putted it, then polished it up nice and pretty. Instead of using the entire piece of silverwear, I cut the head off some spoons and just used the handles. Formed them into a J shape and used them for the hooks.

I thought it was neat, my sister likes it enough to still have it hanging up and in use.

These are OK but come off as a bit tacky."

It's worse with goats. The buck will turn his head back like a dog licking himself, pee all over his face, then go stick his head under the Doe's pee stream and come up doing the duck lips."

Nice looking tractors."

aww,fd961vi,t1_fd8i5ai,1578228939.0,I would say my cattle dog looks much more like a coyote than my jersey cows look like deer.
aww,fd1l4w4,t1_fd0c19z,1578132778.0,"I run a small herd of jersey cows. Guy who owns the property next to mine has it covered in tree stands and rents them out to hunters during deer season. That means a bunch of people from the city, and for many of them this is their first hunt. I keep my jersey girls well hidden in the pastures farthest away from the property line. 

I've thought about making a billboard to put up facing the road they all drive in on. A picture of my jersey cows and under it ""these are not deer"" and a picture of my cattle dog with ""this is not a coyote."""
