AskReddit,ffig7zc,t3_etohsu,1579973125.0,"Sapping, or knocking people out with a punch and then having them stay unconscious for a ridiculously long time (half an hour, a couple of hours, etc).

First of all, in order to knock somebody out with a strike one of two things needs to happen: either you hit a nerve bundle, such as the one at the hinge of the jaw, and cause so much pain that the person passes out; or you cause a traumatic brain injury and they lose consciousness.  In case one, they might remain unconscious for a minute.  In the second, the amount of time that they're unconscious is proportional to how much damage you do to the brain.  It's still not, generally, very long.  My mother received a TBI that permanently altered her personality, damaged her short and long term memory, broke her skull, and caused a hematoma at the back of her brain - and she was unconscious for maybe 5 seconds.

Second, the way they often go about doing it in movies, hitting somebody on the back of the head, is the one method almost guaranteed to cause permanent brain or spinal cord damage.  It is the absolute worst place to take a blow, since everything in that area is both essential to quality of life and fragile in the extreme."

Unless they're specifically trained to coordinate during a fight, they end up hesitating in order to see what their allies are going to do or out of fear of hitting/hurting them.  I've seen it happen.  The effect is magnified if they're unarmed, because reach is shorter and grappling is hard to contribute to safely.  A weapon, especially a long weapon like a spear, makes coordination easier."

There was a strong argument to be made, within the confines of English law, that the colonies needed to be represented in order to be taxed.  The war was entirely avoidable.

It's also true that the British government has a stronger monopoly on violence than the American one, but the guarantees of free speech are not as different as you're suggesting.  I would balance that against the fact that their representative democracy is a lot more responsive to the will of the public than ours."

The demand for representation might not have been fulfilled immediately, but the colonies would quickly become wealthy enough for its merchant princes to assert themselves in British politics.  That is much the same outcome.
