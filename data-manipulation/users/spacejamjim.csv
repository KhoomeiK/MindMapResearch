Sleepparalysis,ff7xujv,t3_es0t0d,1579660936.0,"This is not uncommon. Some people dream of others sitting on them. For you it was a hand on a shoulder. If you try now to imagine a warm hand putting slight pressure on your shoulder, you can come close to feeling it. In an altered dream state, it’s very possible it felt more real."

Make a playlist long enough to last until you wake. There are plenty of 2-3 hour ambiance tracks on Spotify, etc that can be played first to take up much of the ~8 hours and will help to ease yourself into sleep if you’re not used to music.
