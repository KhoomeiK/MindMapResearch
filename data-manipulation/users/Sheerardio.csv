I have very fine hair as well, and it loses its curl incredibly easily, so usually I won't use anything other than my fingers for light detangling.

There's absolutely conservative stances on many, many issues that I'd consider purely just a difference of opinion in how a valid problem should be handled. Trouble is, there's a deeply concerning number of conservative-identifying people and politicians who have used that word, and the Republican party itself, as a platform for also propagating racism, bigotry, misogyny, and other basic human rights issues. They've co-opted the words and made them synonymous with their bullshit, which sucks because your only options are to either use the same labels as them, switch to liberal/Democrat which you aren't, or call yourself Libertarian or some other small fringe group that nobody takes seriously.

I try not to immediately assume shit about a person who calls themselves Republican or conservative, but admittedly, it's hard to not feel defensive when those words have become synonymous with people who really don't want me to have equal rights. :("
