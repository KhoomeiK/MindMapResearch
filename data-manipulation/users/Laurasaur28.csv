goldenknights,ffisyds,t1_ffik4kv,1579981933.0,His dad passed away recently. :( But yes.
college,ffirxyv,t1_ffhrol0,1579981204.0,I definitely recommend that your children ask their financial aid offices to check if anything looks off.
phoenix,ffh6z8o,t1_ffgbjjk,1579924858.0,The wine festival is wonderful. I’m going Sunday!
college,ffh6xx8,t1_ffh0eb0,1579924827.0,The number of children in a household in college simultaneously is very much not a big impact on EFC. But COA and EFC have no direct relationship to one another. I definitely recommend that the school your second child attends is a reasonable financial choice.
college,ffh6rgo,t1_ffh4s3x,1579924680.0,Totally depends on the cost of attendance at your school. You’ll need to wait for your award letter.
college,fffwikt,t1_fffvrg7,1579893339.0,Ask your financial aid office. Depends on how they work.
college,fffwhhk,t1_fffo83r,1579893321.0,No worries at all! Best of luck and feel free to ask if you have any other questions.
phoenix,fffwcdi,t1_fff4q30,1579893231.0,This was a long and... fulfilling... comment.
college,fffo7tz,t3_etdjf9,1579888193.0,This is not /r/legaladvice. Any legal questions should be directed there.
college,fffnzch,t1_ffflovr,1579888052.0,"As soon as he turns 18, he should let the financial aid office know. And he’ll need to provide documentation."
college,fffnwez,t1_ffdx8om,1579888002.0,No. Every school does verification individually.
college,fffnubp,t1_ffdgsux,1579887966.0,Nope
college,fffnt4e,t1_ffdxi72,1579887946.0,You’ll still fill out the FAFSA as normal but any income changes should be reported to your financial aid office.
college,ffflhdb,t1_ffdgkph,1579886532.0,"She does. She needs to report all income from 2018 including child support. However since the child support will end when your son turns 18, he should do a financial aid review to show what your ex-wife’s income will be after the child support ceases. And his aid may be adjusted accordingly. Hope this helps."
college,fffl8si,t1_ffd5hjb,1579886383.0,"This isn’t really an important question, actually because your financial aid office will handle it based on the amount of credits you have. I would say you’re a third year since you’re moving towards your bachelor’s degree."
college,fffkzd1,t1_ffd0gw9,1579886223.0,"When it comes to federal student aid, honesty is the only policy because if you’re dishonest it’s fraud."
college,ffctauw,t1_ffc924f,1579806822.0,"Therapists are wonderful resources in situations like this. Please do get help, and bring documentation for your appeal letter. Write in your appeal letter that you were afraid of getting help (if that’s true) and explain your game plan for doing better in the future."
college,ffcstfe,t3_cwufdh,1579806540.0,This is a great example of how shitty the financial aid system is. I’m really sorry. I don’t have any advice other than to wait to turn 24.
college,ffcscg4,t1_ffb6o8h,1579806260.0,Verification is a yearly process just like the FAFSA so there’s no way to know.
Shrimping,ffan2gy,t3_es863s,1579739808.0,How adorable!!
goldenknights,ffan051,t3_ese9lj,1579739764.0,This is so awesome!
college,ff9xcrg,t1_ff9q750,1579723555.0,"Check your online portal if you have one— most schools will notify students via their portals. If you don’t see anything, definitely get in touch with your financial aid office."
