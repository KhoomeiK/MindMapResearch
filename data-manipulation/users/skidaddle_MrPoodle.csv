BattlefieldV,ffhlftp,t3_etjldn,1579940832.0,that would piss me right off.
AskReddit,ffh3fql,t3_etcyd6,1579922057.0,"Allow them to be open instead of telling them to ""man up"". The amount of times i've been told to man up over something is incredibly stupid. Treat sexual assault against men more seriously. The bullshit myth that men can't be sexually abused pisses me off so much. So many men stay quiet about issues because no one will listen and take their situation seriously. My sister's friend from high school ended his own life some time ago. No one could see it coming because he never told anyone.

Every life is important. Some people throw their lives away doing drugs or doing other things because their minds are all over the place. Talking to someone goes a long way. If you even think your friend (guy or girl) is having troubles then please talk to them. If you see marks on their arms from a blade or razor then talk to them. My friends would see my cuts and ask about them but would never check in. Checking in on your friends and people in general is important.

There are stories of random strangers talking people down from the top of a building or a bridge. Just talking to someone can make them feel special and good. I had my own experience with this. I met a girl on a dating app and after a few days of talking I found out she wasn't happy with her life. Many problems she couldn't see the answer to. One night she texted me and said goodbye. I called her 4 times and texted like crazy to make sure she knew I was there. I told her I was going to call the police if she didn't answer me. She picked up the phone and we talked all night. I was there for her and made sure she saw the light. She ended up ghosting me but I feel like I saved a life that night.

After she picked up I knew she didn't want to die. If she did she wouldn't have picked up. She would have been dead and there would be nothing I could do to prevent it because I lived 20 minutes away by car. I don't have a car. She just needed to talk to someone and get things off her chest and to feel alright and safe.

The point is that people need to help each other more. We're not meant to be alone. We're not meant to deal with things alone. We need each other. Race, sex, religious choices don't matter. We're all human. We need to be there for each other.

I want you to check up on people tonight. Ask them how they're doing upstairs. Ask if their house is in order. House meaning their head. Help each other out and care for one another. One more thing.. Never ever wish depression upon someone you hate. You may hate them but depression is a deep hole that takes so much work to get out of. Depression can make you tired and less motivated to do the things that make you happy. It is never ok to wish it upon even your worst enemies.

If a friend or someone leaves a vague facebook post or texts you a random goodbye then please check on them. Call them. Don't text. If they don't pick up and you have reason to believe they're not okay then dial 911 right away. Trust me with this. It's better to be safe than sorry.

Look up your local suicide hotline or kids help phone number. I myself have gone through a heavy depression. I've been happy and looking at life in the best way possible. I used to beat myself up for not having a job and being anti social. I still am jobless and still am anti social but I look at the good things in life. If you can't see the good then think of all the bad that will happen if you are gone. Your family, friends, the person that sits next to you on the bus everyday. Maybe it won't hit them right away but it will. It always does.

You can make it through hell and start smiling at the exit. You are worth so much. I may not know your story but you are worthy, you are smart, you are brave, you are so so strong for going on day by day. I love you all and stay safe. Speak to each other and help each other.

EDIT: If you read all of this then thank you for reading :) If you're going through some bad times right now then you can comment and i'll talk to you. Or you can PM me if you'd rather keep it more private. I'm here for you."

AskReddit,ffey8ni,t1_ffexzlu,1579870178.0,My sister has bought almost every pack for sims 4. She’s had saves and games bug out and glitch and has lost games countless times
AskReddit,ffey4l9,t1_ffexzde,1579870069.0,It sucks when a game that has loads of potential gets flushed down the toilet because sheep buy and support a company that can’t keep their games together. DICE is a big one for that. BFV is awful. Only way I play it is if I’m in the planes. Even then I have to deal with random disconnecting and bugs.
AskReddit,ffexsa4,t1_ffexniu,1579869734.0,MW2 and 3 will always hold a place in my heart. MW2 for all the shit talking in lobbies and 3 for rooftop sniping and pissing off try hards
AskReddit,ffexoju,t1_ffexioi,1579869629.0,Never played the game but I watched enough videos to know it would be a waste of money. I knew someone who was committed to them and bought everything to support them but after he lost everything to a cheater and bugs and tried to contact them he just gave up. He literally quit playing games and sold his pc. Haven’t spoken to him in a while
AskReddit,ffexiwp,t1_ffexfh5,1579869473.0,Black ops 2 was the absolute best cod they will ever make. Nothing will ever top that game. Everything was perfect and I’ll the miss the days of sitting in my old gaming chair on Xbox 360 destroying with the PDW on domination or doing quick scope 1v1s
AskReddit,ffexbp3,t1_ffex7b5,1579869269.0,I gave up all hope after advanced warfare. I was great at the game but never enjoyed it. I played it because I could drop 60 kills a match and that’s it
AskReddit,ffexaew,t1_ffex783,1579869231.0,FO76 was a disaster. Watched a video that followed the bugs and I was shocked. I don’t want to say BFV is worse but it comes close

BattlefieldV,ffex0sz,t3_et7i3v,1579868959.0,"Not a popular opinion but I enjoyed hardline. It’s nothing like the other battlefields I know but I really enjoyed it, I had my fun in it and spent almost 60 days combined time played. I really don’t understand why people gave that game such a “hard” time"
csgo,ffereor,t1_ffeq7wa,1579861804.0,Yeah same. Tired of solo queues. Teammates either bicker and complain about the team or you get a guy who thinks his shit don’t stink and goes deag only. Then you got the tools who only play ESCA and think they’re the next shroud. Or the guy who can get loads of kills but isn’t a team player at all. He’s there to get kills and maybe leave the match if he dies from a very basic level corner check or bait spot. Silver solo queue is awful but high Nova is just toxic.
BattlefieldV,femhcoj,t1_femhbba,1579255583.0,Ah miss counted. But still was amazing
csgo,feh4nrr,t1_feh2v3d,1579109063.0,"I have my perfect crosshair, my sensitivity is nearly perfect, I always use nades. I have 2 friends I can play with but one will rage if he keeps getting dumped on and the other is the worst team player. He buys nades but never uses them. Buys every round despite team eco, he will kill you for ""his"" awp back, if you try giving him some advice or anything of the sort he will say ""i dont care"". That is his catch phrase at this point. He almost always shits on randoms and once the randoms start clapping back he'll get me to join in on them for the fun of it since we're gonna lose anyway or he'll get banned. Once someone in our group gets banned the game is over. Everyone gets killed on our team and then it's only me and the random.

I need a team that will commit to getting better and playing as a team. Bonding as a team. It's hard to come by nowadays"

RecruitCS,feh24x0,t3_ep1m5z,1579107562.0,I'm a SEM with 2377 hours. My highest rank was GN3 2 years ago. That doesn't matter now but I thought you should know what i'm capable of. I was in game leader when my friends and I played every day in high school. I can entry frag and I think i'm pretty nutty with the AWP. I think I excel in clutch situations. I forgot some of the call outs but I know pretty much all the basics.

Then she turned her back and is ghosting me. I really liked her and it hurt but now I don’t care. She doesn’t deserve me. I’m a great individual and if she can’t see that then it’s her loss. Look at it that way. It’s that persons loss. You’re a great individual and if they don’t reply then fuck it. They aren’t worth your time. I know you probably don’t believe that but try to believe it.

BattlefieldV,fdnqhmv,t1_fdn49de,1578590897.0,Right? I heard someone in my squad complaining about the game but they had a lot of skins. I don't understand it. This game is soooo broken. The player base needs to just stay off the game for a month. I think DICE would break after 2 weeks. They don't listen to the people who play the game. How sad is that? They don't listen to the playerbase that MAKES the game.
