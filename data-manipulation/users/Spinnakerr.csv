NoStupidQuestions,ff76b11,t1_ff6t3us,1579641972.0,"Yes this is what I've learned as well, thank you for that awesome summary. After 5 years Shaw (my ISP) has finally made fiber optic available to us rural customers but I'm already getting quite fast, very stable speeds and the price of fiber optic is just ridiculous right now, certainly not for the average Joe around here. Shaw has made an extremely big effort to make sure they deliver a good service to almost anyone who wants access to it, and they've also got free WiFi (Shaw hotspots) around town and I can walk down the entirety of our little town's main street without losing wifi bars on my phone/laptop because of it. It's actually very cool of them and it makes them more popular with younger people too. Good way to market, especially if the ISP is holding up their end of the bargain with good service and speeds regularly. You just don't get that with the other ISP option around here (Telus), they're always going down, they're dead-slow and they're EXPENSIVE. It's baffling."
NoStupidQuestions,ff75w63,t1_ff6tinx,1579641745.0,"For sure, I get that speed right now (300mbps etc.) and while I can get fiber optic it's mostly for businesses and therefore the price is set at a business level, something like $500.00 CA per month which is not something that the average British Columbian can afford tbh. I hope it comes down in price. Do you have other ISP options?"
NoStupidQuestions,ff75qxf,t1_ff73nzn,1579641662.0,"Lucky! I have the option of getting it where I live (even rurally, believe it or not) but I don't need that speed (mine is way way fast already) and it's also more expensive too.. Which I hope is going to change in the next 3-4yrs. I hope it'll come down in price so it'll be like ""eh, why not?"" y'know? Haha. You must live in a good location!"
NoStupidQuestions,ff75mfr,t1_ff72c86,1579641592.0,"Wow, thanks for that reply. I guess everything I've heard about Comcast is absolutely 100% true. What a scummy, lying, cheating company they are. I hope that gets worked out soon and that you can get something much better than you have now! I have the option of having fiber optic (believe it or not in my location lol) but I simply do not need those speeds. Everything I do is well-below the 300mbps download 30mbps upload and I love it. It's also more expensive too."

holdmycosmo,ff6nyu0,t1_ff699a2,1579631246.0,"this girl is either incredibly lazy or she's in shock, because that was THE slowest reaction to seeing your shit on fire that I've ever watched before. It's like she thinks twice about putting it out, just lets it burn itself out on her goddamn window-sill. That is nuts. I'd have a little get-up in my go if I were her!"
Documentaries,ff6nlnx,t1_ff6knth,1579631027.0,"It was very entertaining for sure. It honestly felt like one very long, intricate 80s movie with huge characters and even bigger set-designs. I don't know, that's what I had in my head at the time of watching it I guess. I will finish it now. Thank you for the reminder!"
Documentaries,ff6kal4,t1_ff6i3d5,1579629013.0,So it's worth watching until the end? I watched some episodes but it didn't hold my attention like I thought it would.

UnresolvedMysteries,fekekiq,t1_fekcptx,1579198407.0,"Ehh, you never know really. Police departments have weird policies on a station-by-station basis and sometimes they give us more on something they only briefly mentioned and less on something that we assumed would be covered more. Investigations are tricky.

Needless to say.... I've followed this case since the beginning. I will check the update of this thread when I come home from work in a couple hours."
worldnews,feke62v,t1_fekdvfe,1579198170.0,Agreed. I think this is the mentality of a lot of traditionally-left-leaning Canadians too. We see it for what it is (which is not only awful but awful obvious) and we should ALL do our best to ensure that the kids that our generation raises (Millenial for me) know better from an early age. Teach them to be good people and to think critically.
AskReddit,fekdytc,t1_fek4ku3,1579198047.0,"DMT is most definitely a strong, naturally occurring drug (in the human body) but don't ever fear it. Don't fear other drugs either, sometimes psychedelic substances can be like one long, important and memorable dream that changes your life positively! And others, like weed, just make you giggly and hungry and sleepy and/or happy, sometimes anxious (but that goes away with good friends hanging out with you!). 

Just wanted to remind you never to have a ""never"" stance towards drugs. There are a lot of different ones and many are very safe. Recreational use only."
