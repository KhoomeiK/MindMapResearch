Are you just critically unaware that Calgary and Edmonton are basically never playoff-bound at the same time? What would they have had a rivalry about? Lottery spots? Same reason FLA and TBL have never given a shit about each other.

CGY/EDM easily fueled their rivalry by... wait for it... playing regular season games between division rivals who are **fighting for the same playoff spots**

You still have to pay for food ofc, but there are more/better options. You can see the ice from this smaller ""hallway"", it isn't separated from the seating like in the upper/lower bowl, and has tables scattered around. It's kind of cozier, I guess? Your seats are right there with the concessions.

To get to club level you take a separate escalator, which goes to suite level, and from suite level you take a second escalator up to club level. IMPORTANT: the best food in the arena is between those two escalators... ""The Cutlery"" and a stir fry place which I never remember the name of. They're both ~$15, good food, and HUGE portions. (Note: there is some sort of stir-fry place in club itself but the line is typically long af until late second period so I've never tried it, it may be the same or better)
