dankmemes,feeyrgq,t1_feexu33,1579044175.0,"Homie, is it that hard to just fucking google it? You didn’t ask for the sake of bettering your own intellectual understanding of what is and is not true about Elon Musk. Don’t pretend your just a young scholar out here just trying to learn. I would understand if he was citing some specific data set but not something that shows up on the first page of google. If you want reddit to link you shit every time you need to learn something a simple google search would discover I seriously pity you. If you really were just trying to change your ignorance you would have done a google search but sure you’re just a guy trying to learn who needs reddit to link him something every time he needs to check the validity someone makes online. Sure dude."
dankmemes,feeq82q,t1_feep64l,1579038906.0,"Wild you give this much charity to anyone other than Elon? Your like, “Weeeeeell it does seem like this is really bad but maybe it was ACTUALLY something more innocent. Idk man not enough context for the fired employee” when it literally has a link to the court documents that you can look at if you need more context. The first article allows you to look deeper at the things they don’t write a ton on. Vox sucks because of how they make their articles super simple and baby trained. Thoughts on the other articles? I find them much better."
dankmemes,feel11t,t1_feekb23,1579035899.0,"By surface level I mean, surface level in the sense that anyone who is talking about this should know that. If you speak on something like this you should know something that comes up pretty much every single time."
dankmemes,feeker7,t1_feeiixb,1579035536.0,"There are literally 10 articles on the front page of google I very seriously doubt that if we were to time them, it would be faster to google, “Elon Union” than to ask for a source under a comment saying something so surface level. I’m quite certain that the events covered in the articles are the events the man speaks about are one and the same."
dankmemes,feejjil,t1_feehxta,1579035035.0,"You asking for a source is cool maybe after you’ve done a quick google search. Why not do that? The logical conclusion is that you are either too lazy to or that you assumed their was none. The burden of proof (philosophically speaking) is on the presenter of the claim obviously but in this argument something so surface level that most people speaking on the subject know should t have to be proven. The claim, Elon Musk is bad, made with the argument, he opposes Unions is something that most people speaking on the subject of Elon should know. To ask him for a source for something so surface level proves that you either only seek to make discourse on the subject harder, are too lazy to a very basic google search, or figured he didn’t have one and wanted a quick “gotcha”.

Edit: if you continue to play the onus game with me your only proving you only seek to muddy the discourse on the subject which I doubt you want to do."

Literally just google Elon Musk union and you get your answer. If not I linked you some stuff that shows how he played a direct hand in the anti union behavior.

Did the suffragettes not fight for the right to vote because it doesn’t get at the underlying issue of a fundamentally patriarchal system? No that would be silly. I have been incredibly charitable to your ideas so I don’t see how these low bar digs at my intelligence are suppose to bolster your point in any fashion.
