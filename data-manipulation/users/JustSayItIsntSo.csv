I also noticed he takes responsibility for him being locked out as his own fault when he says something along the lines of wishing he made better or different decisions. This poor kid. He was so abused mentally and emotionally, if not in other ways too.

He had such a positive outlook about going to school and kudos to the Assistant Principal he could trust and his friends, both ""brick and mortar"" and cyber. I hope major accountability occurs with the parents."

My paternal grandfather served during World War II which actually disrupted a very promising baseball career. He never said that but I have learned about it over time. A few years ago, my dad and I were looking at where he grew up, not but a few streets from my Mom and Uncle, having attended the same high school. We were ""walking"" the virtual street view of the neighborhood and he pointed out two homes where two friends are still listed as MIA and one who was killed. My brother is in the Coast Guard and has been for almost 20 years. My son is seriously thinking of joining and I live in a military city too and so I guess my perspective is skewed towards the idea of many choosing to serve. Thanks for sharing a clearer perspective.

relationship_advice,fctc6oi,t3_eipct2,1577938707.0,"OP, I'm also going to share this because of some of the comments I am reading. I am not looking to devalue other contributor comments by replying to them directly. Their opinions matter but here is something else for you to keep in mind....

My entire professional background is about children, both educationally and psychologically.

While I don't condone name calling to a child, you were in the throws of being physically, painfully attacked and frightened. Biting, and then extended to her not letting go, is incredibly painful. It is also mentally and emotionally distressing to the victim. Again, very, VERY painful and dangerous as a wound. 

Biting someone showcases a very frightening level of scary.

You did not sign up to parent this child. You did not sign up to allow an abusive situation in your own home. The girl needs help in a way that you cannot give her and nor should you feel obliged to do so through some sit down and talk withs.

I am a huge advocate for children and I am a huge advocate for children who have special circumstances where they need additional support and I will give it to them all day long. That being said, I would not allow someone to hurt me in the manner with which you were hurt and not call them out on it. Yes, calling her a psycho b**** may not have been the best thing to say but at the same time you were in a traumatic situation. So again, I say to you that apologizing for your choice of words in the heat of the moment is something you can say one time but you do not need to grovel for anybody's forgiveness. 

There is something seriously going on here with this child and it may have to do with the fact that her brother, your fiance, was a significant role model in her life and she feels she's now going to lose that person. That being said, that is between her brother and her parents and you can step in when you feel it is okay to do so. But you are not obligated to treat this child better than you would somebody else who was attacking you and you are not obligated to correct her. Calling her out on her horrific behavior may just be the wake up call she needs. But that is also not something for you to decide. You just simply need to do what is best for you to ensure boundaries are set and you are not physically, mentally and emotionally allowing this type of environment to be a part of your life."

Please know that I Did Not initiate the road rage.... I consider myself a courteous driver so when people showed out, I hated it. 

Why did I make my promise and keep it? 

I could tell you it was because of the growing trend of it happening in my neck of the woods and ending in fatalities... Or that I was watching the news and saw lives wrecked or lost just being stupidly senseless, horrific and bringing sorrow to me. 

But the biggest reason is that in those moments, I didn't like who I was becoming, how I portrayed myself through my revengeful behavior, most of which branched from formerly being a victim... and why someone else was a distracted or bullying prick often didn't matter. Me not adding to an already bad thing did matter. So I felt guilty, realized the hypocrisy in it all, and stopped."
AskReddit,fcpcu18,t1_fcokpl7,1577858622.0,"I'm sorry you feel this way but I get it. I've felt like that at times too. 

Maybe a little tweak in your perspective may help you as it did me, on most occasions and in most connections...

Most people are busy and stretched thin between work, family, continued education (often not chosen but constantly required) and other obligations. 

But deeper, and still with these same people who make us feel ""tolerated""..., They have some level of inner-turmoil going on, feel they aren't worthy of others' time, love and attention. These factors all encourage interaction hiccups. 

Of course there are people who are narcissistic, sociopaths and make others feel like they are a pebble in people's shoes... 

And this also isn't your fault, or your ability to fix, so just put up boundaries quickly and with help if you need it. I am working on this myself."
