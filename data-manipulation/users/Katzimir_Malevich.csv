AskReddit,ffud9b0,t3_ev871i,1580239528.0,"We were pulling an all-nighter with four of my friends in college for a project and the ones who finished their parts could go to sleep unless needed. We were working on the house of one of us which was solid concrete. It was about 5 am and three of us were sleeping: one inside my friends room and two other in couches near the work table. When I finished my tasks and was my turn to go to sleep I laid down in a couch beside the other two girls and began dozing off, leaving the only one left to finish up the details. Then I heard screaming coming from inside my friend's room. It was screaming that was loud enough to be felt even though the room was fully walled in concrete and the solid wooden door was closed. The screaming sounded something like ""IT WAS BLACK! B L A C K! DONT YOU DARE PAINT IT RED! GOD HELP YOU IF YOU PAINT IT RED!""
I figured my friend who was awake somehow got into a fight with my sleeping friend for something that was left to be done in the project (an architecture sheet so coloring was not totally out of the question) and my friend tended to be temperamental so I just thought 'fuck we are gonna have to deal with this fighting crap in the morning'. I lifted my head to check the fuzz and my friend who was left working alone was still alone and just as surprised as I, just staring at her door. Turns out my friend who was asleep in the room was just very passionate about colors."
