Even though we were separated, she didn’t like that I would sometimes see other women so I couldn’t do it in the house. Anyway, I’ve been seeing this girl Claire Lee now for about 3 months and I felt a bit guilty because this week Lorraine passed away. 

Point of the story is, I can see Claire Lee now Lorraine is gone.

AquaticAsFuck,fdmat0a,t1_fdln9ys,1578544172.0,"So I was at a tasting on the start of this winery tour... They were telling me that you have to spit it out in this little bucket as you’re trying the wines. I figured it’s probably a good idea so I don’t get too drunk and make it to each of the three wineries scheduled in the one afternoon.

I was trying a red and it was lovely, didn’t really want to spit it out but also didn’t want to miss the whole tour and they had a few reds, whites & rosé’s on offer so what the hell, I spat it out in the bucket. The after taste was great and she started explaining to really swill it around the mouth before spitting it out.

Next we tried a Sauvignon Blanc, again, really nice but interestingly after you spat it out, the flavour was almost different to when it was in your mouth. It was a strange sensation and she tried to explain about palettes and whatever but to be honest I was just enjoying the swilling and spitting and the two distinct flavours like some odd magic trick.

Anyway, we get onto the rosé and it was really damn good I’m thinking it’s probably one of my favourites. This one I didn’t want to spit out as it was just amazing. I asked her for a bit more because it was just so good - it’s one I wanted to take a case or two home with me after the tour.

As I’m drinking it I’m getting an explanation from her about the red grapes/green grapes, red wines/white wines, etc. that’s when it occurred to me to ask how the hell they make the rosé if there’s no pink grapes.
