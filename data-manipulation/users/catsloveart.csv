news,ffcuvxk,t1_ffcjbuc,1579807746.0,"And as far as criminalizing it, something else to consider is what is a persons legal responsibility to be tested. 

Why should a person, who has intentionally chosen to not get tested for an STD for whatever reason. Has HIV or any other STD and spreads it to other people. Why should that person be off the hook because they were ignorant of their status? 

Seems unfair, that through a loop hole a person can escape prosecution. But I don't think mandating STD testing would go over very well or is even the right thing to do.  

&nbsp;

I decided to look up some studies on the topic. And there are some interesting studies. Although not exhaustive. 

Here is a Scotland study done in 2001, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1121648/


And this other study from the US completed in 2017, has some very interesting things in the conclusion section. This study reviewed a collection of studies on the subject. PLH is people living with HIV.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5218970/

I haven't read the whole thing yet. But based on this passage, it appears that decreased testing as a consequence is probably overstated. As is the idea that disclosure would increase. And the laws didn't change peoples sexual habits.


 > Study results also suggest that the laws do not deter HIV testing among persons at risk for HIV infection, or decrease or increase serostatus disclosure to sex partners among PLH. The laws also do not appear to reduce sexual risk behaviors among HIV-positive or –negative persons. Records of arrests and prosecutions reveal that many cases involve non-sexual behaviors or sexual activities that pose little to no risk of HIV transmission.

It also had this to say, 

 > Additional research is needed to determine the extent to which HIV-related prosecutions are informed by current medical and scientific knowledge about HIV transmission. Research establishing the cost of enforcement of the laws is also warranted, as is research on structural factors associated with HIV exposure criminalization including perspectives of policymakers and members of the criminal justice system, and studies that examine race/ethnic disparities in enforcement of the laws. More research is needed on policies and practices within health departments and HIV prevention and care services to inform PLH of their state law, and the potential effect of HIV exposure laws on patient-provider relationships and on public health personnel who must sometimes play a role in enforcing the laws.

At a glance, it would seem that from a public health perspective these laws don't have much impact one way or another. From a criminal perspective, It doesn't look like it has been an as effective deterrent as one would expect.  

So barring additional studies, my remaining question is, just how punitive should the law be and what are we hoping to accomplish with it."

&nbsp;

The flu virus, a quarter to half a million people die from it every year. But 3 to 5 million become seriously sick. 

&nbsp;

The roto virus, mainly affecting children under 5. Infects 111 million a year, roughly. Of which about 440,000 die of it, mainly in under developed countries. Mortality rate is 0.3%

&nbsp;

Dengue Fever infects between 50 to 100 million a year. The mortality rate is about 2.5 percent. That is about 1.25 to 2.5 million deaths a year.

No one is suggesting that she is reaching out to Russia or that she is a spy for Russia. Only that similarly to the methods and tactics that Russia used to help trumps campaign and hinders Hillary in 2016. Russia, could (and probably would) do the same to leverage Tulsi campaign as a way to help trumps reelection. 

Because she would draw votes away from a democratic candidate from swing and moderate voters. And this would only happen because her campaign received enough aid that isn't from US citizens to get to that point. 

In other words. She would be a useful tool and she wouldn't necessarily know it. It is in this way what is meant as a Russian asset. And for everyone else following the story from the very beginning, this is what is understood in context. Not what fox news entertainment's mediocre reporting consistently allege.  

Example case in point, when Trump's directed his personal attorney, Giuliani, to work with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to illegally funnel money from foreign donors through shell corporations to fund Trumps campaign and Trump PAC. 

Similarly, Russia would do the same with her campaign. Through third party agents and shell corporations. She doesn't have to be the one directing it (like trump did when he sent Giuliani).

And that isn't to mention the social media effort funded by the Russian government to help her campaign. Just like they did with trump's campaign in 2016.   


Normally, a candidate only has a shot at getting into the election because enough citizens support their cause. But when you allow foreign agents and countries to promote someone's election bid. The popularity and the support is artificial and isn't truly representative of the voters.   

However, thanks to Mitch McConnell preventing even debate on the bills sent to the senate that were meant to increase election security. Russian interference and artificially promoting campaigns will continue unabated.

Now you may be wondering what would stop any politician from being an an unknown Russian tool. Well that is where campaign finance law, transparency and accountability would come in. PACs and campaigns have to vet the money that they are getting. 

However if it isn't illegal or there are no consequences, then there is little incentive. So they would greedily take anything thrown their way. And it wouldn't be until after the election that the citizenry would know they were manipulated and duped. 

This is why campaign finance reform is important. Why it is important to maintain or place sanctions on the Russian Government and Oligarchs. Why election security is important.

Tulsi Gabbard, if you still seek context for the argument of her being a tool. Might I suggest this article that provides further background on the question.
