EngineeringStudents,ff8bht3,t1_ff8bc3w,1579671878.0,that's unfortunate. the rest of the previous comment should still help you out a little. Bottom line is you only really find out you enjoy something once you start doing that thing. So if that means you apply to schools as an undeclared and figure it out after taking some classes then do that because I know plenty of people who thought they knew what engineering was and dropped out or switched majors after realizing they hated it and it set them behind.

Other than that what do you enjoy? I love solving problems and fixing things. I also enjoy math and science. If that sounds like you then you will probably enjoy engineering.

Engineering is more about the application of something than the theory behind it. It makes math and science useful. 
You mention botony in another comment, bioengineering is a thing and I'm sure that plant engineering is also a thing."
