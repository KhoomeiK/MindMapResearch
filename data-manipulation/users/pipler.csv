> On 11 October 2007, two providers of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements, ConsumerLab.com and The People's Pharmacy, released the results of comparative tests of different brands of bupropion.[116] The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that ""one of a few generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, sold as Budeprion XL 300 mg, didn't perform the same as the brand-name pill in the lab.""[117] The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that Budeprion XL is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL.[118] On 3 October 2012, however, the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that ""Budeprion XL 300 mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.""[119] The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013.[119] As of October 2013 the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent.[120]"

The TL;DR is a lot of generics today are manufactured in India/China/countries with lower regulations. There are a lot of contamination/data manipulation going on and FDA doesn't have the resources to catch every single infraction and is under pressure to approve generics quickly to provide lower-cost drugs.  [Examples](https://hcmbeat.com/2019/10/30/dr-harry-lever-speaks-out-about-problems-with-generic-drugs/) [cited](https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/generic-drug-eq) in the book.

Not to mention the problem of dual-track manufacturing, where batches that don't pass quality testing for US/Europe markets are shipped to Africa/Asia/etc."
