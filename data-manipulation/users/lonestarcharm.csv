AskReddit,ffj6mk1,t3_ett7fr,1579991712.0,"Cheating. Never cheat. No matter how much your relationship sucks, no matter how attractive or caring they are, no matter how you can justify it... it will not end well and lives can be ruined. The cheater loses the respect of their friends and family, and their own integrity, and the person who gets cheated on loses all trust in people. Both people’s lives are forever changed just because you wanted someone to care about you. Bullshit. Not worth it. You will have a bad time."
MusicalTheatre,ffh01sv,t1_ffgow2p,1579919491.0,Seconding this.
ThanksManagement,ffe5j30,t1_ffck33l,1579837251.0,"So hurricanes are weird. There are 3 zones, and the studio was in zone C, where I was the first to go in Zone A. You could be in an evacuation zone and get destroyed, or just get a light rain storm. People are apprehensive about leaving for that reason. But seriously, if they’ve said to evacuate, that means GTFO and I thought that would have been respected. Apparently not."
ThanksManagement,ffbyskf,t3_ess2kb,1579787041.0,"I’ve had a boss like this before, who would rather me come in to work with small children when I’m sick rather than hear complaints from their parents that I missed two weeks in a row of teaching class. I literally brought him a doctor’s note, and even though he said it was not necessary, he still complained about me missing multiple classes. 

But what did I expect? This is also the same place that didn’t understand what a mandatory evacuation was for a hurricane, and called me “disloyal” because I chose to leave town and they refused to cancel classes.  Very happy to be out of there."

ThatsInsane,felgbfz,t1_fekrbcc,1579221506.0,For sure easier in pointe shoes. It doesn’t seem that hard but is a really cool picture.
ThatsInsane,fekqdnk,t1_fekpw14,1579205441.0,Nice! So glad you found that!
ThatsInsane,fekpkm2,t3_epl1z5,1579204958.0,"That makes sense. She might have been in an arc mid-fall, and able to somewhat stabilize. I’m almost positive stray hairs were photoshopped out though. That’s pretty standard procedure."
ThatsInsane,fekpatz,t1_feknryr,1579204795.0,Maybe so. I wish we knew who the photographer is so we could find out for sure.
ThatsInsane,feknrqa,t1_fekn16g,1579203888.0,Guys. Dancers “hold positions” in the air. We hold do things with our bodies that are not “possible”. It’s very real that she could have held this for 2 seconds and then fell out.
ThatsInsane,feklemz,t1_fekdkhj,1579202478.0,"If I was trying to achieve that, I would probably squat down, then while holding someone’s hand, roll up and over my ankles. Either that, or I would lower myself down from releve (being on top of my pointe shoes) with the assistance of someone, and stabilize once I got there. As soon as they got out of frame there would be a 2 second window of holding before falling lol"
ThatsInsane,fekl5gr,t1_fekk1x8,1579202326.0,"Honestly, I think she probably held it and then fell on her bum. No clean exit after that pose."
ThatsInsane,fekbljg,t1_fek2v3e,1579196639.0,"It’s a picture, so it was captured from a second of being still... She doesn’t hang out like this. Her ankle bones are leveraged at a way that allows her to press into the top of her feet but engage her glutes as a seat, so she won’t hurt her knees. If she’s using her core and her quadriceps properly, on top of leveraging bones at a proper angle, she can absolutely hit this position. Just takes knowing your body.

AskReddit,fd09op9,t1_fd0799c,1578115705.0,"IMHO If they’re a person, they inherently have value. Anyone who does that or says that to a person has just objectified them, devaluing them as a person. Therefore, no person deserves to be told that."
AskReddit,fcxl9r4,t1_fcxav50,1578065670.0,Who says that halfway through sex?! I’m so sorry. You absolutely didn’t deserve that bullshit.
The_Mueller,fcwsmou,t3_ej8td0,1578035965.0,"You’re not wrong. Here’s the problem: In the off chance I can have a family member actually listen to my POV, I can’t use curse words if I want to keep their attention or respect. I can’t show them half of the things I want to because as soon as they see cursing they’ll assume a “deficiency of vocabulary” from the author and write it off. If possible, I’d love to have things posted with less swear words so I can show them to my family."
