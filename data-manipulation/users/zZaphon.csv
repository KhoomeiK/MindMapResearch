awakened,ffdtrwo,t3_esx3z7,1579828729.0,"Well truly I take one day at a time. It really is an endless adventure for me. I pray that I draw closer to my God at every moment. At one time I feared the darkness within me but I saw it within every man. And though it held space within the human heart not moreso than light. And this light has only continued to grow. My joy surrounds me in my tale, it prepares the way before me in the presence of my enemies. It anoints my head with oil.

And as I look at it, the source from whence we came, it tells me of itself, of myself, of ourselves. This thing we call love is the seed planted within every heart waiting to be noticed so it can bloom.

 And as you stare at it, you become like it, that much more beautiful."
