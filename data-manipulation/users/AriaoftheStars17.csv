TrueOffMyChest,fffsufj,t1_ffeedzo,1579891050.0,">Is it not highly typical to be attracted to some random person on the street or in a bar or wherever before actually talking to them?

Personally? I would find them good-looking, but that wouldn't be enough for me to actually approach them. I tend to only develop attraction to someone once I talk to them - but if I approach someone, it's typically organic, or we have some common factor. I don't approach strangers out of nowhere just because they look pretty.

>Do people not have drunken one night stands without really liking that person?

Absolutely not. I have never had a one-night stand, I am not interested in one, and I likely will never have one. I don't see the appeal.

>Perhaps I’ve misunderstood something but I think it’s quite common to find someone sexually attractive without an emotional connection first and so I understand how a demisexual preference is different from the norm.

Exactly - it's quite common, meaning that people who don't find others sexually attractive until they have an emotional connection are a minority of the population.

By these standards, I would definitely be a demisexual. But the thing is... I don't think that's really an identity. Sure, go ahead and describe your sexual behaviours as demisexual, but that doesn't make you part of the LGBT community.

I feel like some people try really hard to fit into the LGBT spectrum, but regardless of whether your sexual preferences are demisexual or ubersexual or whatever, if you're straight? You're not LGBT."

I think it's really healthy to surround yourself with things that make you happy and comfortable, no matter what that looks like. For some, it may be a proper aesthetic living room with pillows that match the curtains. For others, it's the comfiest couch in the world and a rug that makes you laugh.

If these design choices make you happy, don't change them for anyone. Your comfort and care are the priority here; not the approval of friends who would rather doubt your sanity than acknowledge your positive choices.

One of the things I have done is create a ""wall of happy things"" in my room. I have taped old drawings, my fashion portfolio from back in the day, a glowing review of a big assignment from a professor I respect so much, paintings from my trip to Africa, posters of a group I love, pictures of my family, quotes and self-care strategies, anything that will make me feel nice when I look at it.

So basically, my research concerning paraphilias is in a qualitative context, wherein I retrieve data through online material (reddit, fetlife, porn sites, etc.) and through interviews (anonymously, usually by chat). The goal is not to examine physiological processes, but to examine the psychosocial motives behind deviant sexual behaviours. Given that this is a qualitative investigation, we are not searching to ""prove"" anything, but rather to investigate and gain understanding behind abnormal paraphilias. In sum: Why do people enjoy these strange sexual ideas?

While sex is generally considered to be pleasurable, many of these paraphilias involve quite negative feelings, like pain, shame, humiliation, helplessness, etc. These are the ones that are often most difficult for the general population to understand, and the ideas that I am most interested in investigating.

One of the first areas I looked into is the variety of ""rape-play"" fetishes. This is different from just ""rough sex"" because the participants actively simulate a rape experience and gain arousal from these violent stimuli. Some of the people who engage in this fetish are, surprisingly, victims of violence themselves. You may wonder: Why would rape victims want to relive one of the most traumatizing events of their lives? When I spoke to these participants, there was a theme that arose consistently: Simulating one of the most traumatic moments in their life helped them cope with what they had experienced. The thoughts and memories of what had happened still affect them today, but by engaging them in a sexual context, it seemed they were able to mitigate the fear. The simplest way I can describe it to you is: Let's say as a child, you were bitten by a dog. That might have been very traumatic for you, and maybe every time you saw a dog after that, you became very afraid. But, let's say one day you go to a friend's house, and they have a dog who is very calm and kind. You learn to become comfortable around them. Eventually, even if you may still be terrified of being bitten by a dog, you will associate the word ""dog"" with that really nice dog too, so the initial thought is not as scary as it used to be. Similarly, the memories of what had happened in the past could be crippling and affect some of the participants severely to this day. However, by engaging in this paraphilia, one is able to reframe these thoughts- instead of someone attacking you, it's your partner ""attacking"" you. Suddenly the vision is not so scary. It allows them to replay the incident where, rather than being afraid and hurt and violated, they are being excited and loved and pleasured. There's this idea of re-writing your own history.

Curiously, this seems to apply to a lot of different paraphilic behaviours. A new area I've been researching is cuckoldry - when a committed couple has one partner engage in sex with someone outside of the couple while the other partner watches (and is often humiliated). I don't have a ton of data yet, but something that shows up consistently is that the person being ""cucked"" somehow feels insecure about their sexual abilities (often due to self-perceived flaws of their genitalia). Thus, the solution is to find someone else who can satisfy their partner for them, since they are convinced they cannot. One hypothesis is that the ""cucked"" partner feels such insecurity about their sexual performance that it causes them significant distress and perhaps sexual impairment. Thus, they bring in the ""bull"" (outside person) because the ""cuck"" can feel reassured that their partner is truly being satisfied by someone who makes up for all the characteristics that the ""cuck"" lacks (even if the partner actually enjoys both equally). This alleviates the ""cuck's"" guilt because they believe that their partner is getting what they need, and helps extinguish the fear that their partner will leave them because of their ""flaws"" (and lack of sexual satisfaction). That being said, it's still a hypothesis at this point, and I'll need to do more interviews to see if these ideas are consistent with other people.

Keep in mind, these ideas are not intended to generalize entire communities, because everyone is very different. This idea of compensating may not even be a typical motive at all, and we will only be able to figure that out for sure when we move on to quantitative analyses in the future. The point is that it _is_ a motive, at least for some people.

There are several other possible motives that we are investigating, but it's soon to say if there is truth behind it or not.

It's incredibly fascinating work, and it brings up so many questions! For those who have experienced trauma related to their current fetishes, would they still be interested in the fetish if they had not undergone that trauma? Would the interest in the fetish subside if they went through therapy specifically aimed at coping with said trauma? How does the participation in this paraphilic behaviour affect their non-sexual relationship with their partners? And for all the individuals engaging in paraphilias who have not undergone related trauma, what could be their motives? Is it possible to enjoy these abnormal sexual behaviours without an underlying reason that shaped your preferences?

It's sooo interesting, I really hope I'll get the opportunity to continue researching these topics and further expand on these ideas."

creepyPMs,ff6jnm9,t1_ff6i1wk,1579628623.0,"Yep, just finished reading through your articles, and it's exactly what I expected.

Your articles focus on how the process of _becoming_ aroused is different for men versus women. Cool, I can agree with that. 

But actual _arousal_ really isn't that different between men and women. When someone of any gender is aroused, they seem sexual stimuli to help them relieve their arousal. That doesn't change between genders.

If the individual is sexually attracted to a deviant sexual stimulus (basically, a kink), they may seek it out for their enjoyment. When they have, uhh, ""finished"", their minds leave that heightened state of arousal and become more clear. They realize what they were watching and have ""post-nut clarity"", realizing that their stimuli is actually kind of disturbing.

This happens for men, women, any gender, anyone who may have an interest in (or come across) sexually deviant stimulus.

Basically, the game generates a list of traits that each sim is attracted/unattracted to - like green eyes, blond hair, thicc bodies, certain clothing styles - and I think it influences the success rate for flirting interactions. What's neat is that in the relationships tab, where you can view all the sims you've met, you can hover over different sims and it will tell you how much your sim is attracted to them. You can also ask those sims if they are attracted to you too! It makes dating a lot more interesting.

Oh, and once in a while you'll get a notification where your sim meets the sim of their dreams, where they basically fall in love at first sight. It's rare, but it's really cool when it happens!

What did I start? You're the one who began going through my post history trying to find dirt. I did not read through any of your posts until just now. The only time I ever clicked on your profile at all was when you claimed not to be suicidal, at which point I quickly checked your comment history to check if I was replying to the right person, and realized you post in MGTOW. Again, I didn't read through anything you wrote, because I honestly couldn't care less - the only important thing was that you are part of a cult, which helped explain a lot of your behaviours.

I never said I did - now you're projecting your insecurities.

I work two jobs so I _don't_ go into debt, so that I _can_ achieve higher education. That doesn't take a PhD to figure out, my bro.

>and probably won't get into his ""dream masters,"" a nervous wreck and a bipolar weirdo.

I mean, it's not because of any mental health condition that I won't get accepted into a Master's program. It doesn't make me a weirdo, it makes me an average human being. 20-25% of the US population has a mental health disorder, and 2 out of every 100 people has bipolar disorder. It's a lot more common than you think.

These are biological determinants of sex. Sex and gender are very different things. Sex is a biological quality, gender is a social construct.

Let me simplify it for you: If gender were determined solely by genitalia, as you claim, then no one would be able to detect another person's gender. You would meet someone and, presuming they have their genitals covered up, you would have no idea what gender they are.

But that's not true, is it? When you look at someone, you make an assumption regarding their gender based on a bunch of different qualities, like facial structure, vocal pitch, hair length, body language, height, clothes, etc. Whichever features you identify as being feminine versus masculine fit in with your perceptions of gender, which are shaped by social norms. Thus, gender is a social construct.

>Is it wrong to pity you?

You can sympathize. Like I said, I dream of getting into clinical psychology. It is the most competitive Master's program in Canada, so yes, the chances are slim.

If I don't get in, I can still get into Counselling psychology, Educational psychology, Social psychology, Social Work, Child and Youth Studies, Disability studies, and a tons of other stuff. I have the grades for that, no problem. But when it comes to Clinical Psych, I will have to work extremely hard to qualify and, even then, I only have a miniscule chance of getting accepted. It's no different than applying to Harvard, really - you have to be the best of the best. I do feel fairly pessimistic about it, to be honest.

That doesn't change the fact that I'm a straight-A student with a bright future. I have the grades and experience to go a lot of places - I would just really prefer for it to be in my field. If I decide not to pursue my Master's, it might not. I will still qualify for a bunch of other jobs, like a crisis worker or an HR rep or any other job that only requires a bachelor's degree - and of those, there are many, actually - but, you know, I have a dream. I dream of being in Clinical psychology. I might not get there, and that really sucks, but it won't stop me from working hard, you know?

As for working two jobs, you asked me earlier whether I have student debt. How do you think I've avoided it? Of course I work two jobs, and yes, it is pretty stressful. I love where I work, but when you combine the jobs with my full coarse load, my lab, my volunteering, my work at the crisis lines, and all of my other commitments, it can get very stressful.

It did, because he literally founded the university himself and managed anything having to do with it. He never denied involvement with it either - he wholeheartedly claimed full responsibility over the project while it was running and owned 93% of the company.

>and then you defend Bernie the rape fantasists who lied to his supporters

Rape fantasists? Lol, what? I have no idea what you're talking about here.

The example you use is how he changed his mind on supporting Clinton. I don't know whether he did - it's not my country - but if that is the case, weren't you the one stressing the importance of an open mind earlier? The fact that he was able to change his mind upon learning more about her views should be, by your prior argument, a very good thing!

Also, if the worst thing you think he has done is change his mind about Clinton, that's still so much better than every horrible thing Trump has done. You know, like his frauds, sexual assaults, racism/sexism/transphobism, inhumane treatment of refugees, the random bombing of a country without Congress's consent or knowledge, the severance and mockery of many foreign relationships, the pardon of horrible criminals presumably under bribe (or agreement with their crimes, which is actually much much worse), and more.

>Babies are not babies! 

Babies are babies. Fetuses are not babies.

>It's OK to abort a fetus - UNLESS that fetus has down syndrome, all of a sudden his life matters.

That's not what I said. You're allowed to abort any fetus you don't want, but it should be your choice. Your argument was that _EVERY_ fetus with down-syndrome should be aborted, which is what I vehemently disagree with. Authoritarianism is never acceptable, especially not in a country that claims to value freedom.

I never said he was, I've said that he has had 23 sexual assault allegations. That's not including a variety of physical assault charges he has had as well.

>there was never a trial 

He literally had a court appearance scheduled January 7th, 2020,  to fight the sexual assault allegations of Summer Zervos, which he has postponed with an attempt to delay it until after the re-election date. You know, because if he were found guilty _before_ re-election, that might hurt his chances even more than he already has

>You can absolutely overcompensate low self-confidence by being smug, self-entitled and arrogant.

>Bernier is a socialist

>How he tells people not to use cars because they pollute but travel first class.

You can say all you want about ""Fraud: no, assault: no"" but the facts are there. He has been convicted of fraud and forced to cease fradulent activities, he has been asked to pay up for damages in other cases, and whether the assault trials end in his favour or not, he has had 23 sex-assault allegations. That will never change.

>Psychology is hard and does not consist of reading a text and writing what your ""supervisor"" wants to read.

Nope, first you must do an extensive literature review, then originate a falsifiable hypothesis, then design an ethically-approved and statistically-sensible experiment, then spend months (likely years) gathering data, then perform statistical analyses, then write a structured paper describing your findings, then have your paper peer-reviewed, then submit it to a journal and try to get it published. It's quite an extensive process.

>Then you claim fetus aren't alive, are a bunch of cells, and that abortion is not murder, or something like that. The fetus suddenly becomes alive the second he leaves the mother's vagina? What about third term where the baby could be viable at the time he's aborted?

I have explained this over and over again: Something is only alived when it can live independently of a host. A pre-term fetus cannot. A late-term fetus can, thus abortion is illegal at that point. I have always been consistent on this topic.

I love the concept. I love the orchestral elements. But the whole thing seemed to lack musical death. It was the same chords all the way through, it stayed at this same mellow intensity the whole time, there were verses and ""do your things"" and what sounded like a pre-chorus (the ocean part) but may have been the actual chorus, and then the heavy autotune... and don't get me wrong, I like the idea about the overlapping voices, that was actually pretty cool. I just don't know whether they pulled it off, and I feel like doing it for the entire song was kind of overkill. It felt sort of gimmicky.

If this song had been released as a Comeback Trailer, then this song would be perfect. A comeback trailer is typically experimental and different from the rest of the songs, but helps predict the overall theme - like Hobi's Boy with Evil in Wings (a masterpiece). The comeback trailers are _supposed_ to be a little weird, and I think that given the album is titled 7, it would be very appropriate for the album's intro to be performed by all of them rather than just solo.

It's simply that I find a lot of people in relationships can idealize singlehood and perceive it as something much more appealing than it often really is. They might give up something really great to get that, and then end up regretting it when singlehood isn't as great as it seemed.

That's not to say OP definitely fits into that box, and he very well _may_ prefer being single. But I would rather hear his reasoning so that, if he does appear to have some really off perceptions, I can offer some perspective.

But as someone who, in the past, gave up something really great because ""being single makes you soooo free!"", I think it's worth asking for the context behind his choice.

By these standards, I would definitely be a demisexual. But the thing is... I don't think that's really an identity. Sure, go ahead and describe your sexual behaviours as demisexual, but that doesn't make you part of the LGBT community.

So basically, my research concerning paraphilias is in a qualitative context, wherein I retrieve data through online material (reddit, fetlife, porn sites, etc.) and through interviews (anonymously, usually by chat). The goal is not to examine physiological processes, but to examine the psychosocial motives behind deviant sexual behaviours. Given that this is a qualitative investigation, we are not searching to ""prove"" anything, but rather to investigate and gain understanding behind abnormal paraphilias. In sum: Why do people enjoy these strange sexual ideas?

While sex is generally considered to be pleasurable, many of these paraphilias involve quite negative feelings, like pain, shame, humiliation, helplessness, etc. These are the ones that are often most difficult for the general population to understand, and the ideas that I am most interested in investigating.

One of the first areas I looked into is the variety of ""rape-play"" fetishes. This is different from just ""rough sex"" because the participants actively simulate a rape experience and gain arousal from these violent stimuli. Some of the people who engage in this fetish are, surprisingly, victims of violence themselves. You may wonder: Why would rape victims want to relive one of the most traumatizing events of their lives? When I spoke to these participants, there was a theme that arose consistently: Simulating one of the most traumatic moments in their life helped them cope with what they had experienced. The thoughts and memories of what had happened still affect them today, but by engaging them in a sexual context, it seemed they were able to mitigate the fear. The simplest way I can describe it to you is: Let's say as a child, you were bitten by a dog. That might have been very traumatic for you, and maybe every time you saw a dog after that, you became very afraid. But, let's say one day you go to a friend's house, and they have a dog who is very calm and kind. You learn to become comfortable around them. Eventually, even if you may still be terrified of being bitten by a dog, you will associate the word ""dog"" with that really nice dog too, so the initial thought is not as scary as it used to be. Similarly, the memories of what had happened in the past could be crippling and affect some of the participants severely to this day. However, by engaging in this paraphilia, one is able to reframe these thoughts- instead of someone attacking you, it's your partner ""attacking"" you. Suddenly the vision is not so scary. It allows them to replay the incident where, rather than being afraid and hurt and violated, they are being excited and loved and pleasured. There's this idea of re-writing your own history.

Curiously, this seems to apply to a lot of different paraphilic behaviours. A new area I've been researching is cuckoldry - when a committed couple has one partner engage in sex with someone outside of the couple while the other partner watches (and is often humiliated). I don't have a ton of data yet, but something that shows up consistently is that the person being ""cucked"" somehow feels insecure about their sexual abilities (often due to self-perceived flaws of their genitalia). Thus, the solution is to find someone else who can satisfy their partner for them, since they are convinced they cannot. One hypothesis is that the ""cucked"" partner feels such insecurity about their sexual performance that it causes them significant distress and perhaps sexual impairment. Thus, they bring in the ""bull"" (outside person) because the ""cuck"" can feel reassured that their partner is truly being satisfied by someone who makes up for all the characteristics that the ""cuck"" lacks (even if the partner actually enjoys both equally). This alleviates the ""cuck's"" guilt because they believe that their partner is getting what they need, and helps extinguish the fear that their partner will leave them because of their ""flaws"" (and lack of sexual satisfaction). That being said, it's still a hypothesis at this point, and I'll need to do more interviews to see if these ideas are consistent with other people.

Keep in mind, these ideas are not intended to generalize entire communities, because everyone is very different. This idea of compensating may not even be a typical motive at all, and we will only be able to figure that out for sure when we move on to quantitative analyses in the future. The point is that it _is_ a motive, at least for some people.

There are several other possible motives that we are investigating, but it's soon to say if there is truth behind it or not.

It's incredibly fascinating work, and it brings up so many questions! For those who have experienced trauma related to their current fetishes, would they still be interested in the fetish if they had not undergone that trauma? Would the interest in the fetish subside if they went through therapy specifically aimed at coping with said trauma? How does the participation in this paraphilic behaviour affect their non-sexual relationship with their partners? And for all the individuals engaging in paraphilias who have not undergone related trauma, what could be their motives? Is it possible to enjoy these abnormal sexual behaviours without an underlying reason that shaped your preferences?

It's sooo interesting, I really hope I'll get the opportunity to continue researching these topics and further expand on these ideas."

Your articles focus on how the process of _becoming_ aroused is different for men versus women. Cool, I can agree with that. 

But actual _arousal_ really isn't that different between men and women. When someone of any gender is aroused, they seem sexual stimuli to help them relieve their arousal. That doesn't change between genders.

If the individual is sexually attracted to a deviant sexual stimulus (basically, a kink), they may seek it out for their enjoyment. When they have, uhh, ""finished"", their minds leave that heightened state of arousal and become more clear. They realize what they were watching and have ""post-nut clarity"", realizing that their stimuli is actually kind of disturbing.

This happens for men, women, any gender, anyone who may have an interest in (or come across) sexually deviant stimulus.

What's neat is that in the relationships tab, where you can view all the sims you've met, you can hover over different sims and it will tell you how much your sim is attracted to them. You can also ask those sims if they are attracted to you too! It makes dating a lot more interesting.

Oh, and once in a while you'll get a notification where your sim meets the sim of their dreams, where they basically fall in love at first sight. It's rare, but it's really cool when it happens!

What did I start? You're the one who began going through my post history trying to find dirt. I did not read through any of your posts until just now.

And yes, my future is bright, if I continue succeeding. I have a lot of opportunities right now, if I'm able to keep getting the grades I need and continue working hard. It's just that my dream of working in clinical psyc may not be achievable, and that kinda bums me out. I'm still going to try as hard as I can, but I have to be realistic with my odds, too.

>works two jobs for some reason because going $25,000 in debt when you will earn $250,000 per year as a psychologist is apparently life-breaking

?? Are you stupid? Yes, going 25k into debt would be a huge problem, because how will I afford to study for a Master's degree if I don't have any money? Are you an idiot? Lol. I work two jobs so I _don't_ go into debt, so that I _can_ achieve higher education. That doesn't take a PhD to figure out, my bro.

>and probably won't get into his ""dream masters,"" a nervous wreck and a bipolar weirdo.

I mean, it's not because of any mental health condition that I won't get accepted into a Master's program. It doesn't make me a weirdo, it makes me an average human being. 20-25% of the US population has a mental health disorder, and 2 out of every 100 people has bipolar disorder. It's a lot more common than you think.

>because you are frankly depressing me.

That's not me, sweetheart. If you're as suicidal as you claimed to be earlier, it's not me that's causing your depression. Maybe consider whether your cult is having that effect on you.

I mean, go ahead? If you identify as a woman, then you have every right to save up your money to get bottom surgery.

>so I guess DNA and chromosomes are full of lies too.

These are biological determinants of sex. Sex and gender are very different things. Sex is a biological quality, gender is a social construct.

Let me simplify it for you: If gender were determined solely by genitalia, as you claim, then no one would be able to detect another person's gender. You would meet someone and, presuming they have their genitals covered up, you would have no idea what gender they are.

But that's not true, is it? When you look at someone, you make an assumption regarding their gender based on a bunch of different qualities, like facial structure, vocal pitch, hair length, body language, height, clothes, etc. Whichever features you identify as being feminine versus masculine fit in with your perceptions of gender, which are shaped by social norms. Thus, gender is a social construct.

>Honestly, what I do is none of your fucking business.

>Is it wrong to pity you?

You can sympathize. Like I said, I dream of getting into clinical psychology. It is the most competitive Master's program in Canada, so yes, the chances are slim.

If I don't get in, I can still get into Counselling psychology, Educational psychology, Social psychology, Social Work, Child and Youth Studies, Disability studies, and a tons of other stuff. I have the grades for that, no problem. But when it comes to Clinical Psych, I will have to work extremely hard to qualify and, even then, I only have a miniscule chance of getting accepted. It's no different than applying to Harvard, really - you have to be the best of the best. I do feel fairly pessimistic about it, to be honest.

That doesn't change the fact that I'm a straight-A student with a bright future. I have the grades and experience to go a lot of places - I would just really prefer for it to be in my field. If I decide not to pursue my Master's, it might not. I will still qualify for a bunch of other jobs, like a crisis worker or an HR rep or any other job that only requires a bachelor's degree - and of those, there are many, actually - but, you know, I have a dream. I dream of being in Clinical psychology. I might not get there, and that really sucks, but it won't stop me from working hard, you know?

As for working two jobs, you asked me earlier whether I have student debt. How do you think I've avoided it? Of course I work two jobs, and yes, it is pretty stressful. I love where I work, but when you combine the jobs with my full coarse load, my lab, my volunteering, my work at the crisis lines, and all of my other commitments, it can get very stressful.

So yes, that's my situation. What about you? I've asked you several times and you've avoided the questions, but have you achieved _anything?_ or do you spend all your time getting upset over your cult?"

Is that why he's been personally involved in so many court cases? Do you really think he'd be brought to court if there was no evidence?

It did, because he literally founded the university himself and managed anything having to do with it. He never denied involvement with it either - he wholeheartedly claimed full responsibility over the project while it was running and owned 93% of the company.

>and then you defend Bernie the rape fantasists who lied to his supporters

Rape fantasists? Lol, what? I have no idea what you're talking about here.

The example you use is how he changed his mind on supporting Clinton. I don't know whether he did - it's not my country - but if that is the case, weren't you the one stressing the importance of an open mind earlier? The fact that he was able to change his mind upon learning more about her views should be, by your prior argument, a very good thing!

Also, if the worst thing you think he has done is change his mind about Clinton, that's still so much better than every horrible thing Trump has done. You know, like his frauds, sexual assaults, racism/sexism/transphobism, inhumane treatment of refugees, the random bombing of a country without Congress's consent or knowledge, the severance and mockery of many foreign relationships, the pardon of horrible criminals presumably under bribe (or agreement with their crimes, which is actually much much worse), and more.

>Babies are not babies! 

Babies are babies. Fetuses are not babies.

>It's OK to abort a fetus - UNLESS that fetus has down syndrome, all of a sudden his life matters.

That's not what I said. You're allowed to abort any fetus you don't want, but it should be your choice. Your argument was that _EVERY_ fetus with down-syndrome should be aborted, which is what I vehemently disagree with. Authoritarianism is never acceptable, especially not in a country that claims to value freedom.

>You can absolutely overcompensate low self-confidence by being smug, self-entitled and arrogant. 

But you didn't say I was compensating or projecting - you said I _am_ smug, which implies that you are describing a personality trait, not a projection. It is impossible for someone's personality to be both smug and unconfident.

So yes, I, as a psychology student, am understanding perfectly. You, as a non-scientist, are still incorrect, and just doubling-down to make yourself seem smart (when you're not).

>You are unable to see how Trump just killed one of the top terrorists

Who? He killed a war general, not a terrorist. Foreign war generals are not terrorists - if they are, then I guess every single country in the world is a terrorist, better let Trump know so he can bomb them all.

>Bernier is a socialist

...? I fail to see why that's a bad thing? Capitalism as a system is failing, and I think we ought to encorporate more socialist ideas. That's not to say we should switch economic systems completely, only that we should be incorporating ideas for both sides rather than just depending on one, when it's obviously not working well.

>How he tells people not to use cars because they pollute but travel first class.

Planes actually create less pollution than cars do, because planes can carry over 100 people at once. If all of these people drove that distance with their cars, they would actually create more pollution as a group than a plane would.

>You know, just because you can quote some random anti-guy Trump who said something somewhere doesn't make it evidence.

Nothing I sent to you was an opinion piece. If you had read them, you would see they are all objective evidence, such as a list of all past court appearances and violations of presidential regulations.

You can say all you want about ""Fraud: no, assault: no"" but the facts are there. He has been convicted of fraud and forced to cease fradulent activities, he has been asked to pay up for damages in other cases, and whether the assault trials end in his favour or not, he has had 23 sex-assault allegations. That will never change.

>Psychology is hard and does not consist of reading a text and writing what your ""supervisor"" wants to read.

Nope, first you must do an extensive literature review, then originate a falsifiable hypothesis, then design an ethically-approved and statistically-sensible experiment, then spend months (likely years) gathering data, then perform statistical analyses, then write a structured paper describing your findings, then have your paper peer-reviewed, then submit it to a journal and try to get it published. It's quite an extensive process.

>Then you claim fetus aren't alive, are a bunch of cells, and that abortion is not murder, or something like that. The fetus suddenly becomes alive the second he leaves the mother's vagina? What about third term where the baby could be viable at the time he's aborted?

I have explained this over and over again: Something is only alived when it can live independently of a host. A pre-term fetus cannot. A late-term fetus can, thus abortion is illegal at that point. I have always been consistent on this topic.

>but you're the hypocrite. 

How?

>there is something genuinely wrong with the way you talk and interact with people.

There really isn't. In a debate, i ask for evidence. You can't provide any, therefore you are wrong by default.

As someone who identifies with a cult, is incapable of logical debate, and propegates extremely hateful ideology, I'd say there is a lot more wrong with you than with me.

>Next you will argue men can become women and women can become men

Gender is a social construct. The rules are inconsistent and fluctuate over time, and can be adapted or manipulated at will. So yes, someone can identify as any gender they want. It won't change their chromosomal sequence, but it will change their gender identity, which is social.

Sexual assault is never okay regardless of age, I don't know where you got child mutilation from.

I can understand the deeper meaning, I can understand the intentions and the effort, but I still can't say I really enjoy the song. It's easier to listen to after a few tries, but if it came up in my playlist, i would probably skip. :(

That's alright. It's part of the beauty of BTS, they try different things with every era. Someone is always bound to be disappointed, and I really don't mind that much when I've enjoyed everything else so much. Plus, I don't think this is supposed to be the title track either, so I won't give my hopes up."

But I don't like the song.

When I first listened to it, I thought it was supposed to be the title song, and I was so disappointed. Like, really? I was so hyped, and this was just so underwhelming.

I love the concept. I love the orchestral elements. But the whole thing seemed to lack musical death. It was the same chords all the way through, it stayed at this same mellow intensity the whole time, there were verses and ""do your things"" and what sounded like a pre-chorus (the ocean part) but may have been the actual chorus, and then the heavy autotune... and don't get me wrong, I like the idea about the overlapping voices, that was actually pretty cool. I just don't know whether they pulled it off, and I feel like doing it for the entire song was kind of overkill. It felt sort of gimmicky.

If this song had been released as a Comeback Trailer, then this song would be perfect. A comeback trailer is typically experimental and different from the rest of the songs, but helps predict the overall theme - like Hobi's Boy with Evil in Wings (a masterpiece). The comeback trailers are _supposed_ to be a little weird, and I think that given the album is titled 7, it would be very appropriate for the album's intro to be performed by all of them rather than just solo.

But if this is supposed to be one of the tracks - and possibly a main one - I don't know. I feel very let down."

It's simply that I find a lot of people in relationships can idealize singlehood and perceive it as something much more appealing than it often really is. They might give up something really great to get that, and then end up regretting it when singlehood isn't as great as it seemed.

That's not to say OP definitely fits into that box, and he very well _may_ prefer being single. But I would rather hear his reasoning so that, if he does appear to have some really off perceptions, I can offer some perspective.

But as someone who, in the past, gave up something really great because ""being single makes you soooo free!"", I think it's worth asking for the context behind his choice.

No, to ensure that people graduating as clinical psychologists are thoroughly trained.

If you want the authority to diagnose, then you have to do years of Clinical research first.

Please note that Counselling Psych/Social Work have much less educational requirements and take much less time. Thus, there are many more registered psychotherapists than there are psychologists. Most issues can be handled by these psychotherapists, a psychologist only deals with diagnosis and very treatment-resistant cases.

Because it's extremely difficult. Clinical psychology is the most competitive Master's program in Canada, and there are a limited number of grad supervisors - about 12 max per school. So, 200 people apply to each school and only 12 max people get in. Furthermore, to become a psychologist, you have to do 4 years of undergrad, min-2 years of a Master's program, and then min-4 years of a PhD program. All of these are heavily research-based, and not many people are interested - or capable - of focusing so much on research.

It takes a lot of work to become a psychologist, which is why there aren't many. That's the real answer, not your baseless ""cartel"" hypothesis.

That's actually completely false. If you're interested, consider looking up Valerio, M. P., Szmulewicz, A. G., Martini, D. J. (2018). A quantitative review on outcome-to-antidepressants in melancholic unipolar depression, _Psychiatry Research, 265_, 100-110. It's a literacy review examining the results of 24 different experiments testing the effects of SSRIs on depressive symptoms.

Also, consider reading Caron, M. G., Gether, U. (2016). Antidepressants at work. _Nature, 532_, 320, which explains the neurological processes of SSRIs. Hopefully that will clear up any misconceptions you may have.

>That some of them lead you to suicide? 

That's a side-effect of any psychiatric medication - and even many physical medications. It's unfortunate, but it's worth the miniscule risk of this happening compared to the potential benefits that come with good medication.

I won't even comment on that. 62% of Trump supporters say they will support him no matter what he does - if you're willing to ignore his extensive list of crimes, his decimation of foreign relations, and his rampant discrimination towards every social group you can think of, then I doubt anything I say will help you see the light. I'd like to note that Trump voters tended to be much less educated than Clinton supporter, and that Trump supporters showed much lower basic cognitive abilities compared to other voters - see Ganzach, Y., Hanoch, Y., Choma, B. L. (2018). Attitudes Toward Presidential Candidates in the 2012 and 2016 American Elections: Cognitive Ability and Support for Trump.

Basically, Trump supporters on average tend to be a lot more stupid than other voters. You fit into that description perfectly.

>They create a bullshit waitlist so people feel ""priviledged"" to finally get in, and then don't want to quit that psychologist because they think they'll have to wait months again.

Or, they actually have a waitlist. When there are maybe only 6 psychologists in your entire region and at least 20% of the population has a mental health condition, the wait lists tend to be pretty long. My region has over 447,000 people. That means 89,400 have a mental health condition, if not more. Of those, let's say that 20% of them seek treatment from a psychologist - that's 17880. Given that there are only around 6 psychologists in my region - yes, I have checked - that's 2980 patients per psychologist. In an 8-hour day, a psychologist can usually see 8 people. That means in 365 days, they can see 2920 people - but that doesn't take into account weekends, holidays, and repeat clients (since they get more than one session).

So, yes, there are wait lists, and they are long. Psychologists don't need to keep people dependent, they try to pinpoint the issue, teach you strategies, and help you survive in the world on your own. Then they move on to the next client.

>You don't even know what a p-value (not p value) is. Shut up. Just because you barely passed Statistics 101 and barely skimped the topic of power doesn't allow you to become an expert on Statistics. Again, shut up.

Psychology is dependent on statistics. Psychology basically IS statistics. So yes, I know exactly what a p value means. I use stats every single day. Do _you_ know what it means?

They don't need to keep on patients for months because they have a long wait-list to replace them. That has nothing to do with meth.

Really interesting article by the way, I'll have to read through it when I get home. One thing I did notice in the abstract was that it said that all articles analyzed had a p value of at least below .05. That leads me to wonder - if most of these articles only have a p level of <.05, that's a decently high chance of being a type 1 error compared to, say, p<.0001. This article could be biased by picking articles with high p-values. Like I said, I'll have to check them out.

Source? I highly doubt the number is that high.

Either way, the replication of studies is considered a core part of science. If you had any idea of how statistics work, there is always the chance of a Type 1 error; aka, the chance that you find a result by coincidence. This is represented by the p value: the lower the p value, the smaller the chances are that you've found results by coincidence. Futhermore, we also evaluate effect size: The larger the value, the stronger the effect is (ex. The higher the effect size, the better a drug works).

You seem to ignore the fact that psychologists are in super high demand. As soon as one patient is helped, they are replaced by another.

Great question! The difference is that they are being provided with support and nutrients to survive, but they aren't actually depending on a biological host.

Similarly, an infant needs to be provided with support and nutrients via parental care, but they are not biologically depending on someone's body and are, therefore, alive. 

>Women that disagree with abortion aren't trying to oppress their own gender.

They absolutely are: They are fighting to remove women's right to choice and trying to control them against their will. That is undeniably oppression. Anti-choice supporters are not just about fetuses, it's about control.

>They believe abortion is morally wrong so they don't support it and that is it.

Then they can decide not to have an abortion themselves if they are ever in that situation themselves - that's totally okay! But it's horrible to try and force everyone around you to do what you _want_ them to do, regardless of free will.

It's no different than when people force others to convert their religious identities under the threat of death - ""You have to become Muslim (for ex.), or we will kill you.""

insanepeoplefacebook,fe62jzh,t1_fe5ov78,1578880353.0,"ðŸ™„ Yeah, you don't understand.

A 6 month old is dependent on care and support - not on a biological host. If given the nutrients it needs, a 6-month-old can live and thrive.

On the other hand, an immature fetus is dependent on a biological host. No matter how many nutrients you try to give it, once it is removed from a womb, it ""dies"". An immature fetus, no matter what you do, can not survive independent of a biological host (which is, in this case, its mother's womb).

So, just in case you still don't understand: A 6-month old may not be socially independent (aka needs to be fed and taken care of), but it is **biologically** independent, meaning it can survive as its own independent being, separate from any other (it does not need to be attached to a person or animal to survive). A fetus is biologically *dependent*, because it requires a host body to survive and will become unviable as soon as it is removed from the womb. Therefore, it is not a living being.

The only exception is when the fetus reaches the third trimester. At this point, even though the fetus is not fully developed, it typically _can_ survive outside of the womb. Thus, it becomes biologically independent, and voluntary abortion should be considered illegal. If you know anything about the associated laws, you'd realize that late-term abortion is already outlawed in every Western region where abortion is legal, and nobody wants to change that.

Do you understand now?"

Canada doesn't have laws for abortion because decades ago, it was decided that the government had no right to make decisions about women's bodies, especially when they are uneducated about these medical issues. Instead, the regulations are set by medical policies, and are very strict. Late-term abortions are restricted by these policies and never happen except in emergencies.

>I'm not arguing for or against abortion but to say a fetus isn't alive is just misinformed and idiotic.

The concept of ""life"" is philosophical in the first place. There is no biological consensus, you will find, on what is or isn't alive. So yes, I believe that a fetus is not alive and that it is ethical to remove it if a woman believes she is not capable of carrying a pregnancy or raising a child at that current point in time.

What it comes down to in this debate is whether you believe women should have a right to choose what happens to their bodies. Do you believe in free will or oppression?"
