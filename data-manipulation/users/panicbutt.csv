marvelstudios,ffy8vz8,t1_ffy8ixm,1580340850.0,"I agree, I also think the movie didn't do an adequate job of informing the viewers that she absorbs energy as part of her powerset. Not to mention the weird and uncomfortable thought of ""what happened to Fury's real boss, you know, the one Talos copied"" (not to mention anyone else they had to ""replace"" except Coulson, he's the lucky one I guess). The movie could have been better in a lot of ways, but it's not bad as the introduction movies go."
marvelstudios,ffy8ind,t1_ffptg95,1580340637.0,"I keep hearing that, but when it was all the talk almost the day after A:IW that the quantum realm would be a major issue in Endgame and that was all but confirmed time and time again, yet AM&W didn't even come close to being that big of a hit I wonder how well that argument really holds up. I think people largely underestimate how much anticipation there was for an Oscar winning actress to helm the first female led hero film in the MCU. The MCU is such a big thing culturally I think a lot of people felt a need for it to happen. Which is good, I know a lot of women who also appreciated she wasn't wearing ""a bronze corset and mini skirt"". I think a lot of things came together for CM, in a similar vein to BP. They will need a better overall movie this time around though, but if they get it, I think it'll continue on course."
marvelstudios,ffy7ivc,t1_ffkcdl6,1580340074.0,"Actually Carol absorbs power. If you watch CM the movie closely that is apparent, and when she first ""awakens"" her power she drains down the Tesseract to the point where it was dark. That's an Infinity Stone which is by definition (as per the Collecter) far more energetic than any star, so no, Carol could most certainly absorb that level of energy if she had a chance to prepare for it. Like Thor did, Thanos caught her with the Power Stone upside her head. It showed the look on her face she was clearly unable to defend against it. TBH i think in the MCU versions there's probably only differentiation between characters like that in certain areas, and that each one can do things the others can't."
marvelstudios,ffy6s5d,t1_ffkhz33,1580339656.0,"Well, also take into account that he had the gauntlet and the stones when he fought Carol and still needed to pull the Power stone straight off in his hand (which tbh probably should have blown the hand off) and hit her with it. Considering it was supposed to burn away the surface of entire planets on mere contact (as per GotG) that's pretty intense. What Feige really said was she was the one who was in a position to beat him. Considering both of their powers originate in the same way (being dosed with a stones power) I think it's probably safe to say they are in the same ballpark. To me Strange is the wild card, it's hard to tell what the limits of MCU magic is.

Your point about Wanda's powers countering a melee attack well is spot on though. She was kind of brilliantly matched against him."
marvelstudios,ffy68o8,t3_eu1uyq,1580339351.0,"Captain Marvel can absorb an indeterminate amount of energy. When she first broke free of the control chip she drained both the ships systems and the Tesseract itself (lights went low). Rewatch the beginning of the movie, the Accuser warheads were detonating at least large city sized explosions on the Skrull planet, but the ones detonated in Earths atmosphere made a minimal explosion as she flew into them, because she was draining the energy. Finally watch the power lines as she flies over them post space fight, heading to Yonn Rog, there's a clear arc of electricity following her. This is consistent with the way her powers work in the comics over the past 6 or 7 years. Which can potentially culminate in her Binary level power. I think this is how they want her powers in the MCU to work it just wasn't made very clear."
marvelstudios,ffy5q6r,t3_etlhcl,1580339062.0,No one.
marvelstudios,ffy2bni,t1_ffxupig,1580337207.0,"Not to mention the whole ""stiff"" thing through the first half of the movie. She was playing a traumatized soldier. Detachment and despondency is among the more common symptoms of ptsd, and considering her character was amnesiac (witch troubling dreams of a past she can't remember) and constantly being driven down by her ""friend"", she really kind of nailed it spot on. She wasn't stiff she was playing a character that was traumatized but couldn't show it."

FanTheories,ffe730v,t1_ffe5vbh,1579838448.0,"I mean, he did hide the most powerful Sith in history (Lucas's words directly) right in the window view of the Jedi council for something like 3 decades (first as a Senator then as Chancellor) and he clearly had massive control over the courts and the Senate even when he was still a Senator, he would almost have to have heavy influence over the press to keep that covered up. Plus it's a big galaxy with lots of places for people to be hidden. In one of the companion novels to TFA a character called the ""Controller"" (whom a lot of people were betting would turn out to be Snoke) was in control of a secret facility of unknown purpose on Jakku. Chances are Palps had a kid he more or less hated, because that kid was force-weak and he sent him to the galactic boondocks to be rid of him/her, who then met someone and after the fall of the Empire Rey was born, when they realized that Palps was still around and hunting for baby Rey thats when they decided to try and lead the hunt away from her. I'm imagining that being the non-force sensitive child of a Sith Lord doesn't make for a happy childhood so I'm sure both parties valued distance figurative and literal."

Also Sowers started with Atlanta in 2016 as an assistant coach for their training camp, and then stayed with the team through the season as a scout. When Kyle Shannahan left to become the 9ers HC after that season he brought her with him. Considering he grew up around his fathers Super Bowl winning teams he can't be an easy guy to impress."

Attack of the Clones was the worst overall movie, imo.

However, also imo, TLJ, while being an ok generic sci fi film, completely failed to work as a part of the overall series, so that has to be my answer. Even though I think, on it's own, it was a better movie than AotC, it just sticks out of the entire saga too much like a sore thumb. I can sit thru AotC and it makes sense, put TLJ into context as ep8 and it just doesn't fit."
StarWars,fer2qbv,t1_feqv8dp,1579348991.0,"In one of the TFA companion novels it's noted Palpatine had set up a secret facility on Jakku. Anyone who read that figured out that Rey's origins had something to do with that, until RJ came in and tried to force meta information that literally no Star Wars fan ever needed to be told.

We already knew the Force was democratized and bumped most people at random. The relationship between Annakin and Padme being forbidden is the engine that drives the entire plot of the prequels. If we were to think, as RJ seemed convinced we were under the impression, that Jedi could only come from ""somebody's"" or ""force-royal bloodlines"" then literally the prequel trilogy doesn't work, because there would be no more Jedi left after relationships went from more or less taboo to outright banned for millennia.

RJ's wagging his finger at us was kind of insulting and only muddled the issue. JJ had intially intended Rey's origins to involve that Jakku facility."
StarWars,fer18ei,t1_fepun9i,1579348489.0,"Yea, it was my favorite of the sequel3 too. However, I think a lot of people missed JJ setting this up a while back.

The idea that his son or daughter would be working there, or perhaps overseeing it is kind of obvious in retrospect."
