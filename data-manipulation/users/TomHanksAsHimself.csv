AskReddit,ffjc7hf,t1_ffila8x,1579995234.0,"Until you were out of money, did you have fun riding your bike across country?

If so, maybe you could get out of your limbo by doing it again? Just this time, be smart about it. Save a good deal of money. Make a plan, go places you’ve always wanted to visit, do things that you don’t normally do. Transient lifestyle can be some seriously formative life experience if you’re responsible about it. By responsible, I really mean one thing:

FIND.
WORK.

There’s no reason you should run out of money quickly if you’re smart, you should really only be using the money you’ve saved for emergencies, or maybe a treat if the world has been treating you well. It’s pretty easy in most places to find someone who needs help for a few days and is willing to pay you cash day to day, maybe even provide you with a place to stay/shower.  If you’re okay with physical labor, I’d suggest hanging out in front of hardware stores with a sign asking for work,as well as an explanation of why you are looking for temporary work. A few days of laying pavers, and now you’ve just earned yourself a couple hundred bucks. This means now you get to spend a few weeks camping and celebrating your freedom. When the money from the last city starts to get low, you go into the next town.


Repeat as necessary until existential crisis is averted."

You find yourself experiencing a feeling you’ve never felt before. The front of your Garfield costume is getting tighter below the waist. You’re feeling a little short of breath. “O-okay, you’re really cute, do you want to come inside? I just made some lasagna, do you like lasagna?”

*pauses to nuzzle you and sniff your neck as I walk by* “of course I LOVE lasagna, handsome. And if you don’t mind me saying something forward, *shyly plays with my hair* s-smell incredible.”

You’re in heaven.  You lean your head back and close your eyes as I begin to suck on each of your toes, starting from the left pinky and working my way back and forth, like a sensual Pan flute made by Pachamama, the Incan goddess of fertility, herself. You feel something cold on your right big toe, and start to get excited. You’re tortured wondering what’s next, but you don’t want to ruin the surprise by looking. 

Then you hear a whisper, you can’t understand so you moan for me to tell you again. 

“It’s the only way.”

You look down, and your heart sinks as you see my hand tighten around the cigar cutter. You utter a silent scream directed to your parents for christening you with such a cursed name.
