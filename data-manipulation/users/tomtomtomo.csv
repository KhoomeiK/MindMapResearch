 **GALLAGHER PREMIERSHIP | STEPHEN JONES**

**November 10 2019, 12:01am,**  
**The Sunday Times**

*Rival teams have no right to crucify Saracens for breaking the salary rules*

*Stephen Jones, rugby correspondent*

Last week, Rob Baxter of Exeter Chiefs discussed possible scenarios if Saracens had fielded a different team in recent Premiership finals — one that conformed to the salary cap, to which all Gallagher Premiership teams have signed up.

“The whole truth is, if Saracens had been operating with a different group of players last season they may not have got to the final,” the Exeter director of rugby said. In the 2019 final, his side lost 37-34 to Sarries.

Baxter was speaking after a storm of hysteria when three big legal beaks concluded that Saracens had broken the £7m salary cap in each of the three previous seasons.

The sanction was a staggering 35-point deduction and a fine of £5.3m. Saracens immediately appealed.

The Harlequins Bloodgate scandal in 2009 — involving the cutting of mouths, bogus blood capsules, the near ruination of the careers of two medical staff, long bans and a £260,000 fine — remains, for me, the most ghastly rugby controversy.

Saracens’ fine effectively means that what the beaks saw as essentially culpable administrative errors is seen as 20 times more serious than Bloodgate.

The component parts of the storm have been pious, two-faced sermonising: the settling of unrelated old scores, the operation of the Harlequins Formation Frothing team, the breaking of a dam of jealousy that sent anti-Saracens bile flooding through the sport, plus in some cases a principled criticism that Saracens had, according to the beaks, infringed.

Here is the first inconvenient truth.

We can reveal that the judgment says that “no deliberate deception” was committed.

Here is the second, which is much more telling.

None of the teams Saracens sent out in those seasons would have changed in any position had they been rigidly underneath the salary cap.

On the field of play, and whatever was going on in the financial probity department, nothing would have changed.

Every point would still have been scored.

Does anyone seriously believe that any member of the Saracens squad is only there because Nigel Wray, the chairman, by whatever means he chose (and we will come to that shortly would have retained them with only a salary rise?

That otherwise they would have joined another club? Utter nonsense, of course — their club salaries are a relatively small proportion of total earnings.

Every team who lost to Saracens in the past three years lost because they were not good enough — Exeter by a sliver, and perhaps there were grounds for their complaints.

In the present era, Saracens players have arrived and stayed for many compelling reasons, none of which is additions to salary.

They have the best culture and environment, the best academy system, hungrily feeding on the knowledge about sport and life which the club ethos provides.

They have also had the best coaching team, from the pathfinding Brendan Venter down to Mark McCall and his colleagues.

Had England won the World Cup last weekend, I would have been tempted to name McCall as my coach of the tournament.

Take out the Saracens players from that team and where would they be?

Whatever the motivations of critics, everyone is shooting in the dark.

Sport Resolutions, an independent dispute service, appointed a judge and two wingmen.

Their public report on Monday amounted to about 145 words.

When I asked Sport Resolutions’ communications executive when the full report would be issued, not only did she not tell me, she said she could not talk about any aspect of the case, apart from confirming her name.

What about Premier Rugby, which appointed Sport Resolutions?

Paul Morgan, Premier Rugby’s communications director, said: “The regulations for the salary cap signed by all the clubs say that we do not publish the full judgment.”

So, were Saracens £50m over? Or £2.50? Who knows? The fact is that everyone involved in the dispute is shooting at targets which may not exist.

We had to make our own inquiries.

The alleged overspend does not relate to basic salary or bonuses paid to players, but to business agreements between Wray and Saracens players.

It is these that took the club over the salary cap.

Wray points out that these arrangements are not salary, they are investments, of which every penny could be lost.

He made no attempt to hide these, as each company was named after specific players in documents lodged with Companies House.

Some such agreements can stand outside the cap, others cannot.

But Saracens did go wrong.

It is not up to clubs to decide which agreements are valid under the salary cap and which are not; they must declare every transaction and the independent salary cap manager will decide if they count.

The report concludes that Saracens made no deliberate or wilful attempt to exceed the cap, but we understand the panel held that Wray had been “reckless” and, reading between the lines, almost cavalier.

Wray admits to poor administration. Saracens were also late with some declarations, which compounds the overspend and is an offence.

The sooner clubs are allowed to help provide for their players in retirement the better.

The transition from playing into retirement is one of the biggest causes of mental health issues.

The background to the Premiership clubs’ problems is clear: the near insane demands of international rugby are increasing the pressure on their finances, players and existences. Premier Rugby is also at fault.

It must stop being bought off by Twickenham for yet another chunk of its employees’ time to be devoted to the international team.

Owen Farrell, who would play every week if he could, appears for Saracens for about 38% of their games.

There are more regulations to throw on the pyre.

Every time Saracens or any club produce an England player, they have to share the proceeds from Twickenham with all the other clubs.

Of the money paid for every player produced (about £180,000) only £60,000 finds its way to the club.

What is the point of developing England players?

The club are planning to build a new stand. Across the existing stand is posted their ethos — “Honesty, Work Rate, Discipline, Humility”.

They could put up another sign saying “not very good at filling in forms properly”.

But it’s not catchy enough.

They are entitled to leave the other four maxims in place.

They were earned the hard way and if the losers haven’t taken it well, that is their problem."
