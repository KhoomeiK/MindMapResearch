Oasis.  While the music was good, they were one of the most boring bands she had ever seen, they looked like they were just going through the motions.

Delaney and Bonnie:  The sound system cut in and out, no one could fix it.  So the vocals would cut out, then come back, then the drums would drop, then come back, here's the bass but oh no the guitar is gone - like someone was running around in the back randomly unplugging things and plugging them back in.

Silver Apples:  they were trying to embrace the sound of synthesizers, which at that time were only capable of doing one note at a time.  So it was basically eeee eeee eeee eeee aaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa oooo oooo oooo oooo  for 45 minutes with the volume up to 11 (she had to flee the venue).

Blue Cheer: If their volume and instruments at the concert were Indian food, they would be a bowl of Ghost peppers with Ghost pepper sauce.  Nothing else.  

Me:  Iron Butterfly:  By the time I saw them they had had a few changes in the lineup.  They played 'In a Gadda Da Vida' and it sounded like a pop song, like the Osmond Brothers  - it wasn't as good as the Jackson 5 would have done it.  The drummer didn't even do a solo.

A friend of mine: Sly and the Family Stone.  Friend's around 12/13 at the time and spends her birthday money on Sly and the Family Stone tickets.  There are two shows that night and she gets tickets to the first show.  Openers play their set and go offstage - Sly and friends sit backstage getting stoned.  It's now almost time for the next show to start and they come out and play three songs for the first show people and then go backstage - where they then sat for hours until almost the end of the second show, when they came out and played three songs. 

The next day the radio stations who had sponsored the concert apologized for how badly everyone had gotten ripped off and broke all the Sly and the Family Stone records and 45s they had at the station and did not play his music again.  I didn't hear it on the air again until I was in my 40s."

But it's always; ""Oh, you just haven't had **MY** version of the thing you don't like!  My version is better than everyone else's, you'll like **MINE**!"".

No, no I won't.  I'll probably try to choke down a small amount since you've decided my not eating the thing I don't like is your hill to die on, then I'll spend whatever time I have remaining with you desperately trying to not touch any part of my mouth with any other part of my mouth, counting down the time until I can go home and industrially clean my mouth and wash my clothes since they smell like it now..  I'll make a mental note to never again be in a 'food' type situation with you, and will probably just fade off into the sunset."

While you are busy giving birth to a child is not the time for him to be getting his bath fix.  You are going to need to explain the problem to your pediatrician and the hospital, so this doesn't blindside them - also to get clear Dr's orders that he is not allowed in the birthing tub."

So, pretty much every sentence you write about Sarah is this dismissive of what Sarah thinks or feels.  You give the impression that her emotions and physical well-being are just irritations to you because they interfere with what you want to happen.

> i have never ever and will never be a controlling person so this really hit a nerve with me.

Every line you wrote in your post drips controlling.  You do nothing in your post to show that you have any feelings for Sarah besides contempt - for her being a responsible pet owner, for her having endometriosis, for her having the nerve to not agree with you.  After all, your opinions and feelings on the subject are the only relevant and important ones."

In my defense, my family tends to skew to looking very young for their age.  Both my mother and grandmother were still getting carded well into their 40s by new grocery store clerks who thought they looked too 
young to be buying cooking wine (this was way before mandatory carding laws).  And I didn't finish the sentence by telling her that she looked older than my grandmother, which would have also been true.

But I still feel bad for the woman, she didn't need to hear that from some random second grade child."
