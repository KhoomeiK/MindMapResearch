I'd liken it to a very long and slow process of learning to ride a bike.   Once you finally get it, you can't imagine the struggles you had before.  It's now just second nature.  But it was sure painful getting here.

Real talk for a second though.  When I got out in 97, (please don't anyone say thank you for your service) I had a big-ass, odd-colored mole that was growing pretty fast on the outside of my eye socket.  I was not too terrible concerned about it but my mom was.  She just lost a friend to skin cancer at the time.  A few months go by, this thing is getting noticeably bigger and it's growing its own blood supply system, little veins.


I was working seasonally cleaning pools in the summer and teaching skiing and snowboarding in the winter.  So I didn't have health insurance, but thankfully I had VA insurance.  My mom wears me down, I contact the VA to have this thing looked at.  Really long story made short, in order to get started I pretty much need to go into the VA hospital and sit in in the ER.  That's the only way to get a primary physician.  [Eleven. *Fucking.*  Hours.  Later.](https://i.imgur.com/kQp2Yns.png)

Seriously, it got a little rough up in there.  The admins and nurses were wholly and completely unimpressed with me that day, ""you're here for fucking ... what now?""


When I finally got seen by a doc, he treated me like a decent human being.  It was 1 AM, he could tell we had put in the dues.  I explained to him that my mother could not be talked off of this ledge.  I HAD to get this sorted.  

So he takes a biopsy.  He explains he knows the lab guys that are working, it won't take them long to put the tissue from the shaving of the mole on a microscope to see is the cells are jacked up.


About 25 mins later he calls me back in the room.  Sure as shit, [Basal Cell Carcinoma.](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/basal-cell-carcinoma/)  It's cancer but not the serious kind.  It needs to be removed for sure before it turns into something bad.


***Now*** these motherfuckers are hopping.  No bullshit, papers are flying forms are filled, it's not funny anymore to them.


I get a call the next day from the doc explaining that the Oregon VA hospital is not equipped to handle the newly developed [Mohs surgery](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/basal-cell-carcinoma/bcc-treatment-options/#mohs) that I was going to need, but he had already gotten approval to have the entire thing fast-tracked over to the Oregon Health Science University hospital and completely funded by the VA.  I was in and done by the end of the following week.

Say what you want about the VA being spread thin, a little cynical maybe.  But when the excrement hit the airconditioning, (kinda) they lit up and got shit did.  I am grateful and I think people should know."

Dogs.  He says you just always take a couple dogs out with you.  The dogs will typically find the snake and engage on your behalf before the snake finds you.  If the dog gets bit, you get another one.  That's just rural life in the upside down.
