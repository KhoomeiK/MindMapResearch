shittyrainbow6,fe029rc,t3_ene6u5,1578801276.0,"See I'm at a mid point from this kind of stuff and I get hate from both sides for it. I play casual to win, I do. My ultimate goal 90% of the time is to win. Occasionally if I'm with some buddies I'll fuck around but I won't subject others to me just fucking around. That being said, I've never been the person who starts throwing out names, harassing, or trying to kick people. I don't think I've ever vote kicked a person. Even when they're toxic in mic, I just mute em or ignore it. At the same time I expect some level of decency from my teammates. I won't shit on someone who's playing bad or new or anything like that, but if they're just fucking around to fuck around, it's frustrating. It's wasting my time even though I'm in casual. I've had people harass me for even giving call outs or using my mic, stating I'm a try-hard and to go back to ranked. 

I fucking HATE ranked. ranked is just not fun to me because people in there expect a lot more than I am able to give. I don't like going ""the best"" ops, and I just want to have fun. 

My version of fun is having a fair, rewarding match where you just play seriously. If you lose oh well, but I'm trying to win
