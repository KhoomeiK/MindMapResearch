Yes. There's a preponderance evidence in testimony to show that Trump changed face due to the complaint. We have testimony from first hand witnesses, as well as Trump's own words before and after the White House was informed, where he first begins to mimic the language of the complaint. We have no evidence whatsoever that he was already planning to release the aid.

It is preposterous to simultaneously argue these three points:

1. The aid was tied to anti-corruption efforts.

2. The aid couldn't have been tied to a Biden investigation because the aid was eventually given with no investigation.

3. Trump was planning on releasing the aid even though there was no anti-corruption investigation or verification.

beer,ff5gze2,t1_fesugd1,1579592438.0,"Eh... The whole farm operation is like 40-50 people. That's the vineyard, winery, kitchen, and brewery. Pretty sure they're a 3k bbl / yr brewery on a 10 bbl brewhouse. 300 brews year is 6 a week. But hey, some of those have apparently 300% puree added, so let's call it 5 days a week.

So probably not a big team. Lead and a shift brewer or maybe two.

The owners started the winery themselves, so they should know. That when you add 300% puree, the ABV drops.

Maybe there is a brewery manager who is between the 2-3 brewers and the owners. Seems like a small operation to not just have the lead brewer handle pretty much everything though.

Personally, I think the 9.5% -> 2.6% ABV mix-up is a bit of a red herring. I don't particularly care that people got less alcohol than they thought. Yeah, it's scummy, but that specifically doesn't harm me.

My problem is that fruit puree with a tiny scrap of alcohol should be pasteurized. It's both dangerous due to potential infections AND can bombs. ANYONE working in their brewery should know this. The company is small enough to go straight to the owner with this concern. So to me, either the owners or all of the brew staff (maybe both) are crooked.

No. I literally pulled it all from the article. 

He didn't share how close he was. She **realized** it. Only way for her to do so was by looking up his data.

It doesn't say she went on break or used her lunch.

Even if she asked for his location, she's still on a company phoneline, company call, and that data belongs to the company.

I've worked US call centers. You aren't going to get more than a 30 minute lunch and the 5 minute break an hour (and it's doubtful you even get that, even though illegal). Unless she clocked out (article doesn't say so), she was on the clock."

The minute she used private customer data for personal reasons... Boom. Fired.

Getting supervisor permission to leave work doesn't change that. Just means the supervisor violated policy too.

I think she is awesome for doing it. Sucks that she got fired over trying to do good. But I 100% understand why. She violated policy that is there for very obvious reasons: Customer privacy. Customer safety. Employee safety. Risk reduction.

She should've exhausted everything she could do on the bank side. Like get a manager to waive overdraft fees. And if that didn't work, go on lunch and conduct the rest over non-company phone. Still a huge violation, but at least unlikely to get caught."

To me, abortion was just something careless sexual deviants used as a form of birth control because taking pills was too hard and they didn't like condoms. That was my reality.

Bad:

* Relies on slave / sweatshop labor

* Uses unsustainable practices

* Wanton disregard for shared resources

* Use of disinformation to push agenda

* Theft

Good:

* Values human life

* Transparency of business practices

* Community building

Breadit,fen2yq8,t1_femxk6b,1579275813.0,">I assume the downside of enamel is that if it chips you are semi-screwed? 

Not necessarily. Most manufacturers are going to tell you not to use any enamel cookware with internal chips, as you may ingest further chips. But they also usually offer a warrantee.

However, that's also partly them just covering themselves legally. You could just oil the underlying metal as you would a normal cast iron. Just watch it for more chipping... Don't eat chips.

I have both styles... You have to baby both a bit, but in different ways. Enamel you avoid temperature shock, scraping, abrasive cleaning, rapping spoons, etc. Cast iron you oil and build up seasoning.

I kinda lean towards the enamel, but the reasons have little to do with bread. I don't fry in a pot, so building up seasoning would be active work rather than passive, like with a frying pan. I do simmer sauces though, and highly acidic liquids simmering for a long time can strip seasoning, so enamel makes more sense.

For bread though? Either is fine.
