But that's why it seems like parents have to take a lot of time off to deal with sick kids--a kid who seems a little off and has a 100 degree temp can happen so easily with the germ factories that masquerade as schools and daycares. And a lot of adults don't even KNOW when they have a fever that low because until they get chills (you're not likely to at that point), they just dismiss it as being a little ""off"" that day. Teachers/daycare providers are much more likely to take a temperature if a kid seems off than just shrug it off until they start saying they feel cold but have hot skin or are shivering in a warm room."

People are human and have lives, which many workplaces don't seem to want to acknowledge. It's a sign of poor work/life balance to get upset about someone needing to do normal human things like take care of a child, spouse, or elderly parent or run an errand that might go a little long on their lunch break because the place they need to go to is closed outside of their own work hours."

And they can't help if their kids get sick and are too young to leave home alone or they have to go to more appointments because, well, kids can't drive themselves and doctors' offices keep ""normal"" hours with few offering later evening or weekend hours. Just like you can't help getting sick or needing appointments, it's just that their likelihood is multiplied. 

And instead of taking it out on them, you should be holding your management accountable. Speak up. Get others to speak up. Don't go all emotional on them over it. Just calmly point out discrepancies.

It’s definitely low fantasy in that the only magic that happens is the time travel, though, so if the magic is an important element of fantasy, it might not be for you.

I’ve bought at every duty station but one, and sold each time we PCSd. (Helps to have two VA eligibilities to draw on.) One word of caution I’d emphasize is not even bothering if you’re not absolutely guaranteed at least four to five years wherever you’re at, preferably through a controlled tour. 

Another is to absolutely not max out whatever you’re approved for. The rule of thumb is that your housing costs (and for a mortgage that includes the actual mortgage as well as yearly taxes and home owner’s insurance) shouldn’t be more than 30% of your gross monthly income. I would say rather for your purposes that you should go no more than your BAH for both mortgage/taxes/insurance AND estimated monthly utilities. This is very important in case you can’t sell when you PCS and have to rent it out. Doing it this way will make it much more likely that you’ll be able to afford making the rental amount mortgage plus 10% of the rent to a property manager. 

Also, as far as using a VA loan, please note that there IS a funding fee that comes along with that. Most mortgage brokers will attempt to convince you to roll it into the loan, but if you didn’t follow the first advice and may need to sell in less than four years, you’re far more likely to come out underwater overall when also looking at realtor fees and closing costs on both the buying and selling ends of the transaction. It’s better to pay the funding fee, which I believe is 1.5% of the total loan amount for first time buyers, upfront vs rolling it in if you think things will get tight.  

Also, as I said I’m dual mil, when we were E5s our house was $125K with a with dependent BAH of $1K. We were comfortable there while using one BAH as advised above. (The other went to daycare.) Looking at the BAH rate for your area, I wouldn’t go above $125K if I were you."

This is very important in case you can’t sell when you PCS and have to rent it out. Doing it this way will make it much more likely that you’ll be able to afford making the rental amount mortgage plus 10% of the rent to a property manager. 

Also, as far as using a VA loan, please note that there IS a funding fee that comes along with that. Most mortgage brokers will attempt to convince you to roll it into the loan, but if you didn’t follow the first advice and may need to sell in less than four years, you’re far more likely to come out underwater overall when also looking at realtor fees and closing costs on both the buying and selling ends of the transaction. It’s better to pay the funding fee, which I believe is 1.5% of the total loan amount for first time buyers, upfront vs rolling it in if you think things will get tight.  

Also, as I said I’m dual mil, when we were E5s our house was $125K with a with dependent BAH of $1K. We were comfortable there while using one BAH as advised above. (The other went to daycare.) Looking at the BAH rate for your area, I wouldn’t go above $125K if I were you."
DaystromInstitute,fezhnwt,t1_fez1muy,1579457437.0,"That was seven years prior to the time that she jumped to, and three decades prior to her own time. People change their minds and regret their own actions all the time, and I’d be willing to be that with each crew member lost, that regret grew for her. It was enough to make “present” Janeway listen to future Janeway, so how much worse must future Janeway’s regret and guilt have been with even more crew/family (because at that point they were) dead when they might not have been if not for her actions?"

ChronicPain,fevpe88,t3_eqpn8y,1579399962.0,"I feel so fortunate to be military even though they’re probably what caused me to have issues in the first place. I saw my neurologist in December and a week later had a brain and neck MRI. Saw him for a follow up this past week and have MRIs for the rest of my spine set up for the beginning of Feb. There’s something to be said for social healthcare, which is what the US military has access to. I wish everyone else in my country had it so easy in this regard."
Veterans,fevotgf,t3_eqmopp,1579399759.0,"You’re depressed—like for real depressed. As someone with chronic depression, those are some of the more obvious signs. When you separated, did you get at least 0% for depression or any other behavioral health issue? If so, you can get free behavioral health care through the VA."

todayilearned,feuw078,t1_feuuqum,1579390459.0,"LOL No it isn’t. There have been so many so-called pastors who not only are rapists and child rapists but who get supported and forgiven by other so-called Christians only to do it again and again. And conservative Christians are the ones more likely to be pushing against the concept of rape within a relationship/marriage. All of that is only what’s happened in the past fifty or sixty years. Before, for thousands of years it was even worse. 

 Also, Catholics ARE Christian."
