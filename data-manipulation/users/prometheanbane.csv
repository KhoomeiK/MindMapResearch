gifs,fgvitpk,t1_fgv3mua,1581149415.0,"As a Seattle guy, I know a lot of people with Bill Nye stories. I have never heard a positive or neutral story about a Bill Nye interaction. Notably, my grade school science teacher was a huge Bill Nye fan. She was an older sweet lady who was passionate about science and her job. A couple years after she retired, she had the good fortune to meet him. (This is third-hand.) Apparently he sort of belittled her for having been merely a grade school teacher and was generally dismissive. This was told to me by another teacher in grade school. I have since hated Bill Nye on a personal level."

worldnews,fgudhgd,t1_fgtzqmb,1581118146.0,"It's worse because those clergymen are institutionally protected from consequence.

It's extra sickening because they work in an environment with a lot of children where they hold power that might be interpreted as power greater than natural law by those children.

It delegitimizes the Church. Priests perform sacraments. Sacraments are direct lines to God. Priests who abuse kids also perform these sacraments. Surely God would not allow for such sinful men to perform these most holy rituals. So who's turning a blind eye? God? Believers would say certainly not. So the answer must be the Church. And suddenly you seriously question whether the Church has any sort of divine authority granted by God."

A lot of times this person is someone I've written. So my own characters on the page possess me, so to speak. Also, my heightened manic self feels like a possession. Sometimes that possession manifests as a scripted movie. Like I'm a character tasked with driving a plot, hence conflict."

Like if I showed my kids my 10 favorite songs, they'd all be wildly different, and I'd bet that at least one of them would resonate with them."

My friend had a good party house. He'd take 25%. We didn't make much money, considering supplies and brew time, but it was fun. People would knock them back like they're Coors, and their stomachs can't handle that much high gravity beer. Ended badly. Stuck to pale and hefe after that.

Music,ffrunld,t1_ffqxl8j,1580166214.0,They didn't really make her in the same way that some pop stars have a manufactured sound. She and her brother produced Ocean Eyes and labels jumped on it. The two of them were given an uncommon amount of creative control and the label threw tons of money into marketing her. This happens a lot. It's a bit cynical and disingenuous to dismiss her sound and say that she was created. There are plenty of artists with self-made sounds who are propped up by a label who quickly drop off the face of the Earth.

nfl,ff4acdv,t1_ff3ndro,1579559004.0,"Points: disrespectful to the game? What does that even mean? Does the game take offense? Did he insult the game? Or was he passionate?

Next point: kids swear. A lot. Just not around adults. I've heard young kids say absurdly vulgar things. Setting a bad example of how to handle oneself on national TV? Who are all of these kids making their way on to national TV? Also, kids aren't stupid. They can contextualize that he's amped up about the win. He doesn't come across as vulgar, he comes across as so passionate that he can't filter himself. Kids don't miss things like that. Anyway, point being, kids are bombarded with ""vulgarity"" in a lot of media they consume and in their own social groups. 

Last point: black eye on the game. Along most violent widely televised sport. Slew of violent, dangerous players off the field. Slew of horrible injuries. NFL actively promoting youth football.

Seahawks,fetrldz,t3_eq8nhs,1579379018.0,"Yeah honestly I'm fine with him. He needs to work hard on those false starts. Work with a sports psychologist this season--I don't know. That really bad sack where the DE went unblocked was kind of on Homer (I think it was). But really it was just an excellent recovery by the DE. Ifedi had no chance to make that block. Very few linemen could. Best case scenario would have been a massive hold, which would have been fine. Clearly he panicked when he saw that he most certainly could not get in position, but there wasn't much he could do anyway. It was a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

They should see what the market is, and if no one wants to pay him since there's good options in the draft I think we should pick him up for a one year prove it contract and hopefully he busts his ass. But, in all likelihood, he'll walk for a slightly below average contract.

Given our situation, I don't think he's worth any more than a two year extension for 12 with no guarantees."
