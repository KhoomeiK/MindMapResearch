Meaningless...you know how they all tell you ""happy birthday, i wish you the best in the future....etc."". But  i'm sitting here wondering how long i'll survive these thoughts of mine and how long i'll manage to neglect the fact that i want to disappear without a trace in the world. Such wishes have no meaning to me. People all say those same words just because it's been generally accepted as a common courtesy."

kpophelp,fedy332,t3_eogo4k,1579022323.0,"Considering the info you gave us about her, maybe a taeyeon or iu album.
If she's been a long time fan then maybe you can get an old school album like 2NE1's orr even more old school would be Fin.K.L or Wonder Girls or SNSD or Turbo....there's a lot,we need more info on which artists she likes"

SuicideWatch,fdb4d03,t1_fdb1qlr,1578253632.0,"Ah...that f*cker....i know him. He's such a pain in the ass that it actually makes me cry sometimes. You know...no matter what, never believe him. I got him too and i've also had moments where people got sick of my overthinking...but they didn't leave, because i managed to overcome that  by telling them exactly what was going on in my head, including the demon. Simply put...I reavealed his identity xd"
SuicideWatch,fdb2y6c,t1_fdb03pg,1578253186.0,"It's not about chasing them, it's about staying strong until they found you or you found them. Life is... the existence? of humans... So it actually is for everyone. It's just about whether or not you find it interesting enough to exist in this world of shenanigans xd"
SuicideWatch,fdb105s,t1_fdazkbi,1578252500.0,"One of the people that i mentioned is actually a person who i had feelings for and they didn't return them. But at the end i decided that they are too important for me to cut ties with just because they didn't have the same feelings for me. So i still shared and they cared, and now we are friends...and that person actually once managed to save me from suicide just by hugging me."
SuicideWatch,fdayghm,t1_fdav713,1578251788.0,"I know it's a lot of things...but the feeling we desire is always the same - a sense of freedom, a calm mind, just wanting the weight to disappear off of your shoulders. And...i have come to realise that there are people who can give us that feeling just by a simple hug. I have found such people, and they aren't people that i can say truly love me. They are actually people that I ,myself, love. I do not have a reason to love them, yet i really do. And i have also realised that when i am deep in the dark, the thing i most desire is to hug them and that suicide has gone to second place. So instead of the escape always being only one option (suicide)...there is now another one."
SuicideWatch,fdaw5rx,t1_fdaugek,1578251038.0,"You know, I don't think people like us need positive things. I think all we seek is understanding. I've realised that when i get too deep in the dark, all i desire is just to hug someone i truly love, because there are these people that make me feel...safe...and secure from the world itself and that sense of security is enough to make me feel actually calm and...free - the same feeling that people seek when they commit suicide"

Hi,  
I was born in 2002, in Bulgaria. I often have dark thoughts and I am...mm not sure, my sister yesterday told me i was sometimes an extrovert ,yet most of the time an introvert... but anyways, i've always been interested in people's thoughts, so i'm here if you need to talk."
SuicideWatch,fdassts,t1_fdapbd1,1578249648.0,"i always keep asking myself if everything that i'm anxious about is really worth worrying about...i get through a whole day constantly worrying over stupid stuff like how ppl saw me that day and what i did and didn't do, and i keep remembering moments when i was afraid or i was yelled at....and then at the end of the day i'm alone, staring into nothing, realising none of that stuff mattered, yet i still let it ruin my mindset and lead me to dark thoughts"
SuicideWatch,fdaqvzz,t1_fdapcev,1578249078.0,"I'm not gonna lie...I don't know you and i really don't care much about anyone, yet it still feels wrong in my head to let somebody die like that, maybe it's just human instincts"
SuicideWatch,fdana7n,t1_fdajpg6,1578247917.0,"it still doesn't mean they won't blame themselves for it...i don't think suicide is a bad thing as long as you don't hurt and ruin others' lives because they loved you too much, so just think about it"
