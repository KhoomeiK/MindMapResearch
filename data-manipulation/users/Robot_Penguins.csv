If theres no way you can find a way to feel that connection, then you dont want to feel it (which is understandable) and you need to separate. People lose that connection all the time. It's possible to reignite it and it takes work from both sides because people grow comfortable in relationships and forget to keep dating their spouse. So if you think this isnt possible with a non-ADHD person, that's incorrect. It takes work and it wont feel natural at first, its awkward, but it gets less awkward with time.

Horrible anxiety, throat felt like I was being choked. I was also tired all the time, napped in the afternoon and still kept easily. 



**What was your process of diagnosis like?**

Horrible. Physician has blood work done and an ultrasound of my thyroid. Then gave me synthroid because ""I needed to level out."" Didnt explain anything. Sought a second opinion and he wasn't sure what my messed up thyroid levels meant so he referred me to an endocrinologist who properly diagnosed me. 



**What did your doctor do to treat it?**

He ordered a halter monitor for my palpitations and started me on synthroid. 



**Did you do anything on your own to treat it/use any alternative methods?**

No. 




**What worked for you?**

Synthroid. I tried cytomel but my body responds poorly. I also think diet changes have helped. I've cut gluten out. 


__How did your quality of life change throughout your diagnosis and treatment process?__

It's been poorer since diagnosis but not by much. Things are more difficult and you have to stay on top of blood work."
