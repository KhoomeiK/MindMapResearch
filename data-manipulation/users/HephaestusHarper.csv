Then they have to find someone who does that kind of work in short order and isn't booked with other dresses which, depending on location could be a breeze or a nightmare. 

Then, horror, what if they pull the dress out and it doesn't fit sis in an unalterable kind of way? And now she has five months to find a gown, which see above re: breeze or nightmare, especially depending on size. 

Basically it is totally doable, I just can't imagine cavalierly waiting til that close to the wedding before even trying on the dress."
