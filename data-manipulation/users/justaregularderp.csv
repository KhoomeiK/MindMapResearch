rarepuppers,fd77j2d,t3_ek2q41,1578200448.0,Awww what a cutie. I had a poodle for over a decade that went deaf and blind. She was the best dog ever!

relationships,fcvm9ea,t1_fcv68je,1578005135.0,"This has nothing to do with growing up, it’s simply how men and women are wired. As I said, maybe it’s possible in SOME cases. But in most, someone will either be sexually attracted or develop feelings. As a 30 yo woman who has attempted to have platonic friendships with men, that have always ended in A) the guy telling me he has feelings, B) the guy telling people we’re dating or C) the guy coming onto me, it’s just hard for me to be convinced otherwise. I’m not a flirtatious person, which makes it even harder for me to believe."
shittyfoodporn,fcu89f4,t3_eiuzzo,1577974903.0,It’s Brie so that’s 100% acceptable. I’d do the same!
relationships,fctfohi,t3_eiry4e,1577941767.0,I may catch shit for this... but this post kind of confirms the fact that I believe it’s nearly impossible for men and women to have platonic friendships. Someone will always catch feelings.
TrueOffMyChest,fctfgzd,t3_eik86h,1577941580.0,"As a 1-year Vegan, can confirm that Vegans like this do exist and they’re the absolute worst kind of person."

unpopularopinion,fcn2mq8,t3_ehyxb6,1577801538.0,"To a certain point, I think it helps. But there are plenty of people with money that suffer from depression. Your financial situation is such a small part of being a happy human being."
CozyPlaces,fcn2i00,t3_ehy9ve,1577801427.0,What a view! Did you have to book yours well in advance? I’ve found that it’s almost impossible to find a good Airbnb in Colorado that’s available unless you book 6 months to a year in advance!
unpopularopinion,fcn0rui,t1_fcmq6p0,1577799918.0,You’re entitled to your opinion!
unpopularopinion,fcn0peb,t1_fcmglht,1577799855.0,"So this post was in NO way meant to bash people with real depression, and if you read the entire thing I think you’d understand that. I’m truly sorry that you’re going through what you’re going through right now, and I hope you get the help and support you need! Much love."

A huge NOPE."

unpopularopinion,fck5ghj,t3_ehfy7n,1577717132.0,"I absolutely agree with this. Alcohol is no excuse, and it makes behavior a thousand times worse. My ex used to say terrible things to be when he was drunk and would act like nothing happened the next day. No apologizes, not even acknowledgement of his behavior. He was a shitty person sober, so alcohol only amplified it."
Cooking,fck578p,t3_ehl101,1577716925.0,"It’s not so much for flavor as it is appearance. It’s meant to give a glossy, evenly brown appearance on the top of pastries."

TrueOffMyChest,fc7llkn,t3_eggusn,1577511414.0,I feel your pain man. I have a dog that is old as sin and a puppy under a year old. Experiencing both ends of the spectrum is REALLY special. You’re a good guy for taking care of them for your gf!
unpopularopinion,fc4083x,t3_efx0ov,1577403203.0,Thank you for posting this! There is so much confusion and misinformation about lab grown diamonds. My boyfriend and I have discussed my wishes for an engagement ring and I definitely want one.
