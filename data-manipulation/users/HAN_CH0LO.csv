gifs,ffqmv6a,t1_ffqbowy,1580138792.0,"You know for certain Kobe raped that girl huh? Unfortunately, even the me too movement breeds ugliness. There’s a girl in Cyprus right now that falsely accused men of raping her, probably believing she’d get away with it because everyone has to believe to girl right? She was found guilty of lying and yet so many people like you still say “I believe her”. 

I even have a friend who was nearly convicted of rape then later proven innocent. He had consensual sex with a girl who later regretted it and that was her way of retaliating. Don’t believe everything you read. Makes you ignorant, not smart and woke like you think."

When you die people will say “he left stupid inconsiderate comments on Reddit in an effort to be edgy” and then no one will give a shit. As I said before, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart...FUCK OFF."

ConvenientCop,feydh55,t1_feycnj9,1579444125.0,"I mean I don’t think it’s necessarily just social media either. People will act like this even for the quick laugh in front of just their mates. Social media does amplify this kind of stuff to the millionth degree I do agree, but I think it boils down to recognition and attention in any form."

ProRevenge,feck3gh,t1_fecjifc,1578975841.0,Never even heard of such a thing. Do you know of any “reputable” drama channels your could point me to? Maybe a DM or something if it’s not too much trouble.
ProRevenge,fechgbp,t3_eoeug5,1578974010.0,"My little brother won one of these accounts for a gambling type Instagram guy. The prize was $1000 of you tagged 3 friends and guessed the score of the Eagles and Giants Monday night football correctly in the comments. He did it all was told he won by the Instagrammer. The instagrammer keeps stringing him on for over a month now claiming he’ll pay him next week and then the week after. 

We’ve pretty much given up hopes on him getting that $1000. If anyone has any revenge advice, please let me know...."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdk91tx,t1_fdk2wce,1578498835.0,I had a D.A.R.E. Police officer in 5th grade that used to massage my shoulders all the time. He would always tell me I reminded him of his son and flat out started calling me “My Son”. Always made me really uneasy. I found out a few years ago he was arrested for child pornography.
