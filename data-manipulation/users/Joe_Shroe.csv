truetf2,ffdy1i4,t3_esw2df,1579831760.0,"Demo is not terrible for pocket which is why you'll see demos getting ubered quite frequently. Demos have lots of ammo and can deal reliable medium range damage and splash damage. However scout and soldiers are able to chase weak targets faster and defend the medic against close range enemies more effectively. This is why demo is a core member of the combo but not as the main pocket role.

Heavy is simply too slow to make the most potential out of a pocket role. Heavies are only really effective when players are close by and caught by surprise. Otherwise he can easily be avoided by running/jumping away. He's also a big and slow target to get focus fired down, and he can't retreat when he's in danger.

Scout is actually used as pocket in higher level divisions because a player with good aim can defend against any other traditional 6s class very well. They can also boost medics out of a fight, stop jumpers dead in their tracks, and destroy stickybombs with ease. For lower level scouts though, they might not have the ability to do these things reliably which is why soldier is a better choice.

Two roamers is also a strategy used by higher level teams because scouts can lead the combo effectively by themselves. This strategy doesn't fit a lot of teams and it depends largely on players' strengths and weaknesses, so don't run it by default in every team or lobby you play on."
truetf2,ffdwr3c,t3_et00vm,1579830839.0,"In regards to your last sentence, we as the community have done all we can do to make competitive TF2 accessible to the general playerbase. We have community run leagues with prize pools and medals, weekly Newbie Mixes events to teach beginners the basics, community created pugging sites to practice in a competitive environment with teammates, and community funded tournaments with streams and professional production crews.

In short, we've put in a lot of work and passion to make competitive TF2 come to life. Valve has only implemented an in-game comp system that was dead in the water within months, and without any major changes made since beta. We've left constant feedback for improvements over several years that have fallen on deaf ears. It is 100% up to Valve to get their shit together and fix their system if it's any priority for them at all. The community has no responsibility over how the official comp system functions."
