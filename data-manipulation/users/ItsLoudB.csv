Wellthatsucks,ffm04qu,t1_fflqqi9,1580046390.0,"> If I pay you to sweep a fucking floor, find another goddamn job. When you can be replaced by a stiff breeze and you think that's what makes your day a good one in the eyes of the checkwriter... You're goddamn delusional.

Man, you sound like you worked a whole month in your life and think youìve got everything figured out. Or you're just brainwashed.

Notoriously, when you get to sweep the floor in any labor job, you're told to do something while a technician fixes your machine, or you already finished you job for the day but you still have 1 hour left on the clock. So, if anything, your boss paying you to sweep means that you did good and they let you finish your shift.. Or they just have to pay you for the day anyway.

> You're talking about your personal opinion on the value of a day. Sorry to say, but that doesn't mean shit. When you work a shop floor and have the ability to do menial, thoughtless, physical labor, the value of your day is not in how you perceived the water-cooler chats and how long you got to sweep a broom. If you can push a broom for 2 hours a day, you can go drink beer with a fishing pole in hand for 2 more hours a day. Ahem..... You're not getting paid to fish either. Clock the fuck out if you can't make yourself useful.

I'm not clocking out (saving anyone any money) if I'm not told to. I don't understand should I feel pride and honor in saving money for the factory owner that doesn't even know my name..?

> 2 types of job in this world, the one you use your brain and the ones you use your body. Body jobs don't have to stress anything more than clock in and don't get hurt. Brain jobs have more stresses involved with the maintaining of said job.
> 
> I say this having worked both sides and from the top. Training replacements is harsh, management would much rather keep you around, but if you want me to hire an extra person for the offchance we may have an extra hour of work every now and then (and you don't OT). I would see about straight curbing your nonteamplaying ass and give the new guy your position with some OT.

> How are robots not cheaper? Initial investment? Because they damn sure win out over the long run. I'd rather pay 2 years of worker ""d"" salary to purchase a robot that works constantly without complaint and never calls out for whatever reason...like another commenter said... Bumping up in the portapotty over break. Manual labor is a liability and can wreak havoc on overhead costs when incidents occur. Robots don't OD over lunch and don't fatigue after 2-3 hours. Cheaper.

Like I said, you have no idea of what you're talking about. Robots DO call out, they get broken and need technicians to constantly be around and fix them. In some cases they are damn convenient, but for most tasks they are no where near being flexible enough to make for a good investment.

And they're not a ""2 years of worker ""d"" salary"", try 20."

Wellthatsucks,ffli2hw,t1_ffjrpym,1580039951.0,"1) Robots aren't cheaper
2) Everyday I could sweep the floor chatting with people around for 2 hours instead of doing a repetitive job at high paces was a good day
3) Labor is labor. You're not worth keeping around if you move bricks or are a chain worker in a factory. Someone could learn your job in a couple of hours. Maybe not do it as good as you, but good enough for whoever is paying you.

That ""I'm so good that they have to keep me around"" mentality is what's wrong with labor. It's a job, you gratification shouldn't be that you feel like others are expendable and you aren't because ""you do your job real good"" but rather because you have skills other people don't have and you are a good worker without selling your soul (i.e. never complaining, never calling in sick, etc..)"
