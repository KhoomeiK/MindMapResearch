TaylorSwift,fgs86vo,t3_exw7zn,1581076037.0,Late to the thread but I agree. I was so worried when 1989 had released that Taylor finally stopped writing vulnerable songs because of all the pressure from the media. I loved it but at the same time thought it's never going to be the same now.
TaylorSwift,fgomccg,t1_fgo10jv,1580975772.0,I agree. A lot of the things could've gone better with the statements Taylor's PR team has put out for some of her most infamous moments like the Kimye thing.

ChrisEvans,fg49cx9,t1_fg48ynu,1580498921.0,I too want kids and fantasize about having them with him. I keep wondering if he only wants white kids or if he is okay with mixed race kids. If a guy only wanted to have kids that are purely of his race that would turn me off.
ChrisEvans,fg394at,t1_fg37rap,1580474923.0,Oops. :D
ChrisEvans,fg2qmu1,t1_fg2qh2c,1580452060.0,It's an exaggerated joke at worst. No one is holding their breathe to date Chris Evans.

Fencesitter,fg0dgr0,t3_ew5dxj,1580405485.0,"If it's the early years you're afraid of then why not adopt?   Does the idea of adopting an older kid feel more relaxing than having to start from the beginning?

 I have heard adopting older kids is easier than adopting infants."
Fencesitter,ffyy1df,t3_evpafa,1580358068.0,How did you know sacrificing all the time and energy and taking a backseat when it comes to your job would be worth it before having this positive experience? (that's what keeps me on the fence)
AskParents,ffho7f4,t1_ffgnnew,1579944975.0,I know right? Sometimes it seems as if not having kids is the only correct choice. But then I realize maybe I need to hear stories from the other end too. From happy parents.
AskParents,ffho53m,t1_ffgvt49,1579944877.0,Awww. That was so heartwarming. Thank you for sharing. :)
AskParents,ffho2ts,t1_ffgj0ni,1579944779.0,I never would have guessed you weren't a kid person. If someone who was never a kid person can end up being so happy about it then so can I. :)

TaylorSwift,ffdalwf,t1_ffco34f,1579816728.0,I imagine a bunch of women singing it at a sleepover wearing all kinds of cute night time clothing like silky knee length gowns or huge button down shirts and pyjamas with fluffy slippers because the woman who is hosting the sleepover really wants her boyfriend to propose. :D

childfree,ff93cvd,t1_ff934k6,1579703844.0,Normal people don't just become serial killers. It would be paranoid to think that. Really more chances of them accompanying you during old age than them doing psychopathic things like that.
childfree,ff8rwb0,t1_ff8rs3u,1579693661.0,I don't want to be accommodated by them. I will save up for retirement plans. I just want someone during the holidays and someone to be there with me during my last moments and someone to cherish their dad or their grandad when he passes away.

I want kids I can love. But I am not sure if living humbly is in the cards for me."
Fencesitter,ff8js60,t1_ff8josr,1579681787.0,I am on the fence and my biggest concern is not knowing what would be more gratifying. Hard work of raising a kid and seeing the result or having more money to spend on lifestyle. What will give me a more satisfying life in my fifties and sixties.
Fencesitter,ff8jbxw,t1_ff8j4l4,1579681148.0,"If your job prospect is the same you'll obviously live more humbly when caring for kids than compared to being CF and making spontaneous vacation decisions etc.

All the families I know have a good grandparents to parents to kids relationship. I keep reading on the internet about parents not being visited in nursing homes but if you really raised your kids well and they had a happy childhood then I think they'll visit you.

breakingmom,ff5pbeb,t3_eroso4,1579604500.0,I would judge a guy who has been in a long term relationship with me for ditching my birthday nonetheless for missing his kid's birthday. Seems shady.
TaylorSwift,ff5p0y7,t1_ff5mgwf,1579604082.0,I think she is never going to be okay with John Mayer. He hurt her a lot it seems with the way she describes him in Dear John. My guess is she just wants to go through life without ever having to deal with him.
TaylorSwift,ff5ou73,t1_ff5lke3,1579603803.0,"Yeah I like the music of Paper Doll for sure. 

I just wish whenever I can travel to USA and be able to catch a John Mayer performance that he is still performing Vultures. I don't wanna die before watching it live."
TaylorSwift,ff5l44w,t1_ff5l01v,1579598137.0,It's on my bucket list to see him perform Vultures live. love that song so much. Lol doesn't that song make fun of Taylor Swift?
TaylorSwift,ff5kz3q,t1_ff5ks7q,1579597927.0,"Some people she wrote a song about are worse than the others though. Like she already said she feels bad about blasting Joe Jonas. She wrote an apology song for Taylor Lautner. She made up with Katy Perry.

I think the worst people she wrote songs about (other than her political opponents) are John Mayer and Kanye. Though I am not cancelling John Mayer but gladly cancelling Kanye."
TaylorSwift,ff5kr82,t1_ff5kpzd,1579597605.0,Did he perform Vultures?
TaylorSwift,ff5ec76,t1_ff5dws9,1579589262.0,"Yeah that's what I tell myself. Taylor is way too big to worry about petty things like her fans enjoying the music of some of her exes (even if they treated her badly).

You guessed it right. It is because of the whole ""Dear John"" fiasco. :D"
TaylorSwift,ff5e5ey,t1_ff5d70m,1579589049.0,"I would definitely disagree when it comes to Chris Brown  though. Probably shouldn't like Chris Brown songs proudly. :P (and probably not Kanye either but it's easy for me to say since I am not much into rap)

I love his live performance of Vultures. It's so soothing. And I really like this underrated song of his called Love Song For No One. And I like the usual Who Says, Your Body is a Wonderland, Half of my Heart, New Light, Heartbreak Warfare."

Pets,fehwp9u,t3_ep90gq,1579125369.0,Yes getting neutered will help. Get him neutered and then observe his behaviour. if he is bored you can start walking him like a dog. Exercise will wear him out and he'll be asleep all day when you're at work.

Pets,fehebvb,t3_ep4ztw,1579114786.0,"Like the first comment mentioned-just the vet costs will be the most noticeable thing. You'll have to pay to get them all spayed and neutered, get their yearly vaccinations and take them to the vet whenever something feels off.

Other than that, just more hair all over the house, more litter boxes, more sand for the litter boxes, more pet food, more efforts if relocating or something.

That's pretty much it."
Pets,feh5q9k,t1_feh1psd,1579109696.0,If he is young he can still learn to adjust and gel with other pets in the family. So you can also get another puppy or cat for him to play with. I would still recommend pet sitting a cat first but it seems that luck might just be on your side since the puppy is young and impressionable. Young age is the best for your pets to learn to get along with other animals. It gets difficult after they grow up and have a more defined personality.

Pets,fegbahh,t3_eowzp5,1579086038.0,"My dog prefers my cats as family members than other dogs because of jealousy issues and because my cats obey her and don't try to push her buttons like some of my foster dogs have. She was very unhappy with other dogs inside the house.

Since you have a hyper dog you have to be sure that he is a cat friendly dog because my dog is very docile and gentle and gets along with my cats just fine. She is like an aunty to the cats. But I had fostered a hyper dog once and he was a nightmare for my cats. I would have had to abandon him if he hadn't gotten adopted after just 5 months of me fostering him.

Your dog might prefer a new kitten as a buddy because there might be less ego issues but if that means the cat is constantly feeling stressed out and threatened it's not fair to the cat.

That's all I can say. Hyper dogs can be really stressful for cats to be around but my cats love my docile doggie. So maybe try pet sitting for another cat to see if they get along with your dog and observe if your dog can be nice and friendly towards feline family members."

And then that same kitten who was now supposed to be my oldest cat ran away (she was an outdoor access cat) and my other two cats who I adopted after her don't even seem to remember her.

I like to imagine that they don't know how to comfort themselves over the loss of a family member so they like to get through the mourning process quicker than us. Maybe it's a survival thing. Time to move on."
