So, I guess this all hinged on my use of “still”, which you read to mean “up to and including the present” from the reference point of the building of the Memorial, despite me trying to explain that that wasn’t what I meant.

Allow me to blow your mind:

**Still, adverb “nevertheless; all the same.”**

So, to put it all together: “they [confederate soldiers] were [past tense] *nevertheless*, legally speaking, traitors”... regardless of the point of reference now or when the memorial was built or during the Civil War itself, **which you later repeated back to me and agreed was true**.
