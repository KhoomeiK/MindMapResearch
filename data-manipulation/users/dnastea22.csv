AskReddit,fdlyc8f,t3_eluch8,1578535421.0,"Several years ago I had really, really bad lower back pain. I was a poor, uninsured college kid. I dealt with it for about 3 years, as it continued getting worse. Eventually it got to the point where sneezing made my knees buckle, and I couldn't even turn my head to back up in my car (a '98 subaru, pre back-up camera).

My girlfriend at the time was the daughter of a General Physician, and called in a favor to get me an MRI, free of charge. It turned out I had several Ependymoma tumors on my spinal cord, in the Cauda Equina (horse's tail) area.

Two spinal Laminectomy procedures later, I'm pain free, but do have some lasting neuropathy and other surgical side effects. 

If you have severe back pain, best to get it checked out as soon as possible!"
