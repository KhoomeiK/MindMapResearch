todayilearned,fedqo7j,t1_fed9d5r,1579017805.0,"I’d guess it’s like today. A small number of people actually understand how things work. If you took a random 1,000 people from a major city as the sole survivors of WW3, no one will be able to describe how Instagram actually works. How to repair the power grid. How to read stuff on their Kindle. How to grow food. Most people I meet don’t even know, broadly, what culture is. You mean NASCAR and hunting, right? Some small traditions might survive, but for 1,000’s of years? Not likely.

Most everything would fall into disrepair and ruins. Survival would take priority over education. People would quickly become illiterate. The only thing that *might* survive would be spoken record, but as language changes naturally, it’d quickly become incomprehensible and more myth like. Consider even languages spoken for only two thousand years. The ancient versions are very different from the modern.

Hospitalized for acute pancreatitis. Keeps drinking. Hides mini bottles all over the house. Goes on & out of the ER without insurance, because he can’t keep a job. Racks up a few $100k of debt he’ll never be able to pay back.

Gets married, doesn’t file the paperwork. Keeps drinking, cheats on his baby momma and gets kicked out. More hospitalization. Gets addicted to the opiate drips, so he takes up pills.

His lady takes him back. He continues to get smashed every night in front of his family. Cheats some more. Starts saying terrible shit to his lady, even in the rare times he’s sober. Get’s kicked out again.

Disappears for a bit. Breaks into a dude’s house during the day, when the guy was home. Jail. Gets out. Family takes him in. Keeps drinking. Gets kicked out for stealing and being himself. Disowned by most everyone, including his kids.
