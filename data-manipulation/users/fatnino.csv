This is not AOL HQ. They just owned the building. AOL was only the top floor and they didn't like the other tenants going up there and seeing how much of a ghost town it looked like. Second floor was occupied by some game company that eventually became part of Disney. Half the ground floor was a company that did something medical related, maybe they were making some medical device. I have no idea beyond that. The rest of the ground floor was us, a Cafe, and that startup incubator this guy was part of. They had a kitchen down at their end of the building and a big room with glass walls that looked like a highschool computer lab inside. There was a couch in the kitchen and there always seemed to be someone crashed asleep on it at all hours."

My ask is to remember how many ticks have been processed so far before focus was lost and resume from there.
Also maybe add a wake lock during extra tick processing so I don't have to change my phone screen power saving before opening the game."
