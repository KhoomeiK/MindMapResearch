This past Christmas, I flew to LA to visit some family and my goodness, I hadn't realized how much of a brat my little cousin is. Whenever she does something she isn't supposed to such as playing with hammers or annoying her 5-year-old brother, she instantly plays the victim and cries in the corner whenever she's told to behave. The worst part is, that my aunt passively encourages this behaviour and consoles her by saying *""Did your brother hurt your feelings?""*

2 weeks in and while everyone's on the couch watching TV, the yorkie hops on the couch to cuddle with the family as it was a cold evening. **My cousin then proceeds to kick the yorkie off the couch while sucking her thumb.** At that moment, I was furious and told her in a firm voice to not treat the dog that way. I also wanted to yell at her but instead, I just gestured to the pup to sit next to me.

I know it sounds kinda mean but whenever my cousin trips and falls, I couldn't care less. I choose to ignore her every time she tugs at my sleeve to ask for junk food coz if I chose to interact with her, I might be forced to cuss her out. I'm a decent person and I don't take myself too seriously, but if your attitude is the same as what comes out of your ass, then my threshold for tolerance is significantly lessened.

If you voice an opinion about something, I can choose to agree or disagree respectfully. Vice versa. The discussion doesn't have to escalate any further.
They treat facts like a buffet. SJWs simply choose what they like to digest and simply leave out the rest because it doesn't go down well.

Take for instance:
Vegans who support abortion. They cry injustice for any animal/creature on earth that are killed or are used for food, but when it comes to killing unborn babies, it's simply a ""choice"" and isn't even regarded as a human being, but merely a ""clump of cells"".
Though lots of SJWs are against racism, they also support Planned Parenthood. Look up Margaret Sanger and her real advocations towards racism.

* But yes, getting back to the discussion. Fair point, I agree.
However, I just didn't like the fact that during the episodes where Michael calls Jim and Dwight in the conference room to address the complaints against Jim's constant pranks, or during that episode where Jim identifies as ""Bill Buttlicker"" during Dwight's training exercise, Jim gets away with it along with any other pranks. I like John Krasinki but man idk, something about his and Jenna Fischer's characters on the show just make me cringe like heck.
* As soon as the ""Nard Dog"" was introduced, I knew I'd dislike him. Helms always comes off like a middle-aged dad, trying to be the kewlest daddy-o in the neighbour trying to impress his children. It's painful to watch. 
* Random show suggestion; If you haven't watched Firefly, please check it out when you get the chance. Cowboy smugglers in space."

Not to sound sappy but yesh, reading your post just gave me a brief hit of nostalgia the first time I fell madly in love with the game.

* Exploring the beautiful map for the first time outside the Embrace and learning how to hunt wildlife to improve inventory space.
* Discovering your first Tallneck and gazing upon how awesome they look.
* Learning that my aim wasn't too bad with Bandit Camps.
* Immersing myself into the beautifully-written story. Even though any side-quest in any game nowadays is undoubtedly a fetch-quest, HZD rewards you with good gear and/or valuable information that help you understand the world that Guerilla Games created."
horizon,fbx58ej,t3_ee8qau,1577169884.0,"The DLC map is fully integrated into the main game seamlessly.
So yepper, you can jump in and out of either maps as you please with no loading screens.

As much as I enjoyed Marvel's Spider-Man and Dying Light, the DLC's for either game are only playable within their own separate maps.

Happy hunting =)"
