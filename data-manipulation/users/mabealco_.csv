I am not a fan of the ending - it makes me wonder if he was thinking about Robin the whole time he was with Tracy. And sheâ€™s just so special, in my opinion. :/ 


But, #1 best show ever, hands down."

simpleliving,fcyooec,t3_ejfhs9,1578083998.0,"It may not be what youâ€™re looking to hear, but Iâ€™d say just deal with the backlash. Youâ€™ll be happier in the long run. Itâ€™s YOUR life. Do as you please. 

And if it makes you feel any better, Iâ€™m in the same boat as you. I have a small apartment, and plan to have a small house, or even just an RV. I am very minimalist, and do not buy anything unless I absolutely have to. I do not invite friends or family over. Allllll of this drives my family, especially my mother, absolutely crazy. Iâ€™m just introverted - and happily so. Itâ€™s just me, my boyfriend, my dog, and my cat. And I am HAPPY. Everyday. I stand my ground, and just let their words roll off my back. 


You should make your 2020 New Years resolution to do more of what makes YOU happy. ðŸ˜Š"
