Best you can do is go in, say you’ve been evaluating their performance over time, and say it’s not working out. No need for theatrics or coulda/shoulda games, just short and to the point. Don’t take it lightly but don’t take any of their bullshit either. Had a dude get violent once as if that was gonna help him save his job. He lost his job AND left in handcuffs.

LifeProTips,ff8ub0p,t1_ff8ty7u,1579696335.0,"Government jobs are a whole different beast, yeah. By law they have to post those even if their ideal candidate is internal.

Keeping copies of previous applications is pretty common. I almost always go back and read the notes about why they were rejected when I see they’ve previously applied. As long as you weren’t an asshole and it’s been a bit since you last interviewed with us (a year or so) then it’s fine."
LifeProTips,ff8u3an,t1_ff8tq5l,1579696120.0,Agree. For every role I hire for I list these as a preference and not a requirement. It’s dishonest to make someone think a degree is required when it isn’t. Hands on experience is usually more valuable to me than some degree (and I say this as someone with several degrees haha)
LifeProTips,ff8tz0c,t1_ff8tp31,1579695998.0,"This one is a bit trickier because it’ll depend on the company and role. For sales, it seems like experience always trumps having a degree. There’s a certain point where having a degree doesn’t outweigh hands on experience. With ten years of experience they may not even notice the lack of degree on your resume because you’ve been in the field long enough.

But I’ll also say it’s really stupid if they list a degree as a requirement if they don’t actually require it. People like to list out “ideal candidate” requirements but don’t realize it’s off putting to qualified people who don’t tick every box."

LifeProTips,ff8tby9,t1_ff8t4gm,1579695321.0,Yeah my advice assumes you actually want the job you’re applying for and have taken steps to get there. I’ve hired boot camp grads with virtually no experience and the deciding factor in interviewing them was their portfolio/involvement in tech communities. I also regularly get resumes from folks like you just described — those people are just spamming their resume out to see what sticks and yes it’s a waste of everyone’s time haha

LifeProTips,ff8szcy,t1_ff8smsj,1579694933.0,The best way to solve this is with a cover letter IME. No one does them anymore so when someone actually bothers with one I take the time to read it (as do others). You can do one per role to highlight your strengths for each position and generally keep the same resume unless the roles are vastly different. Most hiring systems will tell us you applied for both and it allows us to go talk to the other hiring manager to see where you’d be a better fit.

WhitePeopleTwitter,ff8olmq,t1_ff8j47d,1579689104.0,This is where I’m at. Pretty soon I’ll be 40 and nothing will have changed. I know my negative patterns and behaviors and I’ve fought hard to fix who I am or at least come to terms with it and it never gets any easier. I still end up in toxic relationships and have toxic friendships and at some point I just have to accept that the problem is me. It gets worse every year. I tried to hang myself and failed so honestly there’s no escape either. Do I just keep disappointing myself and the few people who have stuck around forever? Even my best friend stopped trying to help.
LifeProTips,ff8o1yq,t3_es9cor,1579688278.0,"Hiring manager here. It’s not up to you to determine whether you’re qualified for a job, that’s my job. Cater your resume towards each position you’re applying for instead of sending the same one to each. Use the job post to help outline what should be on your resume. If your day job doesn’t align with what you’re applying for or you don’t have enough hands on experience, highlight extracurricular work you’ve done to get up to speed. Also “no” doesn’t mean no forever at most places. Consider it a “not right now” and try again later if it’s your dream job."
