StopGaming,ffcxwti,t3_eswy9c,1579809554.0,"I’m not an expert by any means but also, no one has responded so I thought I could give it a shot. It seems to me like you have replaced one method of dealing with your depression( I.e gaming) with another( I.e shopping.). Personally, I did something similar.  I thiNk the issue could be that you are still having trouble dealing with depression. For that I recommend a good therapist, cognitive behavior therapy( other kinds work, I just found that kind helpful myself).

Another possibility is you have trouble with rewarding yourself in proper ways at proper times. This part might seem a bit too out there, so disregard if you think it is not the issue. It could be related to ADHD and or depression. The brain makes less than helpful cognitive behaviors when you are dealing with depression, ADHD or both.  Just a thought to investigate. 

In any case, good luck with it!"
