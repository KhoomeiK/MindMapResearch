BeforeNAfterAdoption,ff51r75,t3_erlp35,1579577882.0,"Healing a dog's broken heart is tougher than treating the heartworms.  You did good, OP.  So glad Patches found his rescuer and that you were able to help him on his way to his forever family.  Excellent work!"
aww,ff2hr2p,t1_ff2g79b,1579506672.0,"K, we're gonna need you to get a video of this and post it!  Sounds like a quality r/aww post."
cats,ff290zf,t1_ff28k23,1579497361.0,I bet he would have said the same about you.
aww,ff287aw,t3_er65cl,1579496637.0,"Sorry, but you're the side chick now, OP.  Don't take it personally.  It's hard to imagine *anyone* competing with this much kitteny cuteness. **;-)**"
cats,ff27p90,t3_er7fi9,1579496203.0,Gingers are some of the absolute best cat buddies you could ever have.  I imagine that he lifted lots of spirits in his job as clinic cat.  It's extra nice that you could be with him at the end to ease his passing.
cats,ff1zeu3,t3_er6815,1579489755.0,I'm so very sorry.  It's always tough to lose a best friend.
BeforeNAfterAdoption,ff1ymqn,t3_er4tec,1579489196.0,"Those ginger boys are always such awesome personalities.  You got yourself a good one, OP.  And, it looks like he got the home and family he was hoping for.  Excellent work."
cats,ff0vjf6,t3_eqx4ut,1579472710.0,"Those ginger boys are the best snugglers!  Hope you're feeling better soon, OP.  Although your cat might appreciate a few more days of an extra warm human and fuzzy blankets.  **;-)**"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,ff0v1uw,t1_ff0msal,1579472547.0,The fish oils in the salmon must help make her coat extra lustrous. She deserves some special yummies in her diet.  :)
BeforeNAfterAdoption,ff0ko2b,t3_eqoe4m,1579469771.0,Hard to believe she's in her golden years.  That shiny coat in the bottom left pic makes her look like a young lady.  You must be treating her right!
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fdtuqfq,t3_emorh7,1578722521.0,"He's got quite a pair of ears!  He's so very lucky to have found a good home and a special person to care for him.  Wish all the lost, lonely, scared little orphan kitties could be so lucky."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fdtu0ij,t1_fdsr0mq,1578722191.0,"Well, she seems to live with (on top of?) a dog now, so maybe she's just trying to relate on his level.  ;-)"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fdttqb0,t1_fdsyxay,1578722054.0,"Not OP, but we're a medical foster family.  I'm always amazed how vets can manage to reassemble some pretty broken and sick little critters, and how hard the little guys fight to live.  Always a big win when the cat you least expected to make it pulls through!"
aww,fdr1a76,t1_fdqabkq,1578678134.0,He knows *exactly* how he likes his blankie.  :)
aww,fdpw93s,t1_fdozcla,1578643112.0,"K, we're gonna *need* pics of this!"
Eyebleach,fdpw3qd,t3_emjfiu,1578642930.0,"I'm not a bunny expert.  Is this normal bun behavior, or is this some special breed of retriever bunny?"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fd7lhoa,t3_ek5cch,1578206320.0,That epic tail deserves a rug of it's own.
cats,fbi4ehl,t1_fbg8s19,1576890462.0,"Wish there were something I could say that would help with this pain.  But, I know from experience that there aren't really any words.  All of us here on this sub *completely* understand how painful it is to lose a beloved cat.  

If you're still volunteering at that shelter, maybe consider fostering?  It would be a way to see if a new kitty gets along with your little litty man without having to make a lifelong commitment."
