If she didn't overtly lie to you, I think that saying she's not really your friend is overreacting just a bit.

 I would calmly ask her about it. Maybe she kept it from you and partner to keep from hurting you?

Having someone already ingrained in the family to openly stick up for her will go a long way.

 Call out your inlaws on the gifts too,  like this ""oh! MIL, you must have forgotten, its SIL who likes elephants not me."" Or ""Oh, you guys must have put my name on her boots by mistake."" 

This does 2 things, it implies that they are getting senile and it makes them explain their shittiness outloud. Older people survive on being quietly petty, they don't typically have the balls to be overt."

When this first started, I said, ""well, maybe he isnt getting enough time or needs more often walks."" So I extended his walk length and frequency. That didn't work. I do keep the back part of the house shut off, but there are times when the door gets left open (for example last night there was a weird noise outside. We grabbed the guns and the flashlights and rushed out to make sure nothing was trying to eat our herd. Door was left ajar in the kerfuffle, he pooped in the bedroom before we got back inside) 
I was hoping someone would have a word of advice as to what may have triggered this sudden onset of bad behavior so I could maybe try to focus on that. Instead I have gotten lectured about how he doesn't get enough time on his walks, I dont watch him closely enough, and we should rehome him because we aren't willing to work on his problems.

Her paranormal experiences started one day while her husband was at work. She was in the shower while the baby was napping. The shower curtain moved. Now, Big Mother being a tough bird and a reasonable woman thought prehaps someone was in her house and trying to peep at her naked. She jumped out of the shower in an attempt to catch the would be pervert. No one was there. She checked the whole place. All doors and windows were still locked (she didn't trust her neighbors here in ""the city""). Nothing was out of place, so she decided it was her imagination and dismissed it.

A few days later, she was in the kitchen (just her and the baby) when suddenly all of the cabinets began to open and slam closed. The baby is wailing and she's terrified... then dishes started to smash on the ground. That made her angry. Here was some invisible SOB breaking HER dishes (the nicest dishes she had ever had, being previously very poor).
