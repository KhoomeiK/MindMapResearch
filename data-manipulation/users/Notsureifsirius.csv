AskReddit,ff6atjg,t1_ff5k5ds,1579623128.0,Truly underrated comment of the thread.
AskReddit,ff6abfn,t3_err9f0,1579622804.0,"My answer is a bit different, since I’ve thankfully never had a truly morally challenging case (i.e., representing someone or something absolutely reprehensible). Sure there’s been some injury defense cases or cases where someone got screwed by a deal, but we always recommended the client (or their insurance) pay up and not drag it out. 

The most challenging was this case where man was sick with cancer and sued every possible product he encountered. This is very typical in product liability cases; plaintiffs will cast a wide net and then, over the course of discovery, you narrow down to a list of a handful of likely suspects. My client, thankfully, was highly unlikely for reasons I won’t elaborate upon for obvious reasons. 

The morally challenging moment came when I was chatting with my boss one afternoon about scheduling depositions, discussing how Plaintiff clearly lied about XYZ because of ABC, and joking around about something unrelated when our phones both buzz at the same time. We both got an email: Plaintiff has died, and his attorney (and family) were going to re-file as a wrongful death case. There was a beat where we just stood there in silence before my boss gave me instructions for advising the client while he made phone calls to the other parties’ counsel. 

That moment hit me hard overtime. Not because I thought my client had anything to do with the disease - I genuinely believe it didn’t. Rather, it was a combination of two things. First, it was the first time someone I actual met (at deposition, in the course of work) died mid case. Usually in my cases, someone would either already be dead or just have injuries they recovered from. Second, it was the fact that - by necessity - we only had a moment to take in Plaintiff’s death before treating it like a litigation event to deal with. 

A few months later, I left that practice area behind for business dispute litigation instead."

explainlikeimfive,fefwexp,t1_fefnrts,1579067400.0,"The confusion comes from the context of your first comment and subsequent comment. If they were reversed, I’d be less prone to explain the standard.

I admit I get worked up when I hear people develop and reinforce cynical (and often incorrect) ideas of our justice system. Certainly, our justice system itself often gives us reason to be cynical. But it also doesn’t work if we don’t try to follow through with it. 

I understand, know, and Agree that we enter with biases. Similarly, I agree that some people view a mere indictment as a sign that “this person is probably guilty.” If it weren’t for the last two sentences of your first post, I probably wouldn’t have made a second comment.

ETA: Also, the part about prosecutors only devoting resources to tee best cases and not churning crap cases is simply not true. They’ll push coin flip or outright bad cases for any number of reasons or no reason at all. There’s plenty of great men and women in that field -including friends and mentors- but it’s rarely safe to assume they’re putting resources on sure things unless it’s high profile."
explainlikeimfive,fefkui5,t1_feeysgi,1579058466.0,"That is wrong. All you need is what’s known as “probable cause.” Probable cause does not mean “probably guilty.” If legal burdens of proof were percentages, it would need less than 50%. Cases define it as “a state of facts as would lead a [person] of ordinary caution or prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion'"" of the fact to be proved."" People v. Hardacre, 109 Cal.Rptr.2d 667 (Cal.App. 6 Dist. 2001).

A suspicion is just that, and cases get through that stage with the flimsiest of evidence. They aren’t rubber stamp, but it isn’t much. 



My friend once saw a case make it to trial where a man was charged with stealing 90 shoes in an hour. Never mind that 1) there was no evidence shoes were stolen at all (there were just empty boxes), 2) the “smoking gun video” showed it was almost impossible for the defendant to have stolen even one pair, 3) the guy had a perfectly reasonable explanation for being in an otherwise suspicious area. The jury, who were fairly bright, thankfully, “Not Guilty” pretty quickly."
explainlikeimfive,feey85i,t3_eoqu2n,1579043829.0,"A lot of the other comments hit good points about why it’s good for the public to know who has been arrested (and on what grounds). There’s something else in your question, though, that needs to be addressed!

1) In the USA, defendants don’t have the burden of proving they’re innocent. 

2) The phrase “innocent until proven guilty” is what’s known in law as a rebuttable presumption (i.e., something that is true unless shown otherwise by a given standard.) It is a mindset placed on the jury that is assembled for a criminal case. The prosecutor must prove to those jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the crime. Until the each side presents their case and the judge sends the jury to deliberate, the jury is told to *not* come to any conclusions, discuss the case, or otherwise treat the defendant as anything other than innocent. It’s a tough philosophical and mental exercise. 

Think of the burden of proof like a boss fight in a video game. When you show up to the boss fight, the boss is gonna stay around unless and until you can knock them for enough hit points. You can throw as many badass moves as you want at them, but until you hit them for enough HP (i.e., present enough evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant is guilt), then nothing changes... legally, anyway. 

Trial by media is a real concern, but the fact is that innocent until proven guilty only applies to the cogs of the justice system that process the defendant’s case if that makes sense."
Cooking,fecwkq1,t3_eo386o,1578987496.0,"I had just moved into my apartment a week or two prior and wanted to make spaghetti aglio e olio for a date (the Chef / Binging with Babish version).

We haven’t used the clause in 200 years and more or less formalized the policy post civil war.

Cooking,fdxp3uk,t3_enbold,1578771410.0,"Edit: Is it the one that looks like a frying pan or the one that looks like a pot? My advice originally was geared towards a frying pan type pan. If it’s more like a pot or sautée pan, the same advice applies but I’d add braises and soups, too. 

Googling it looks like it’s a pricey stainless steel pan. Stainless steel pans are great for a lot of things that you would normally make in other kinds of pans like searing meats and vegetables. One advantage it has over nonstick and (to an extent) cast iron is you can use them to make pan sauces. 

A pan sauce is exactly what it sounds like: making a sauce in your pan. The reason why they’re good for that is because when food sticks to the pan, it will form what the French call “fond” (i.e., brown bits and residue from what you what you just cooked). That fond can get unstuck from the pan when you pour in a flavorful liquid like wine or stock, and will add a fair bit of flavor.

My question to you, though, is how have you been feeling physically? I moved to California after living in the east coast for 20+ years. When I lived out east, I had a near-supernatural sense of smell and taste. I could smell someone walk into a large cafeteria from the other side of the room before anyone else. When I moved out here, however, it went away. I also started getting colds more often - or so I thought. After seeing a few doctors, the running theory is that I’m mildly-to-moderately allergic to the particular flora of SoCal   As such, my sense of smell and taste are dampened here. It could be a similar thing for you!

>Alweg was founded by Swedish industrial magnate Dr. Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren in January 1953 as Alweg-Forschung, GmbH (Alweg Research Corporation), based in Fühlingen, a suburb of Cologne, Germany. The company was an outgrowth of the Verkehrsbahn-Studiengesellschaft (Transit Railway Study Group), which had already presented its first monorail designs and prototypes in the previous year. The Alweg name is an acronym of Dr. Wenner-Gren's name (Axel Lennart WEnner-Gren).[2]

>Alweg is best remembered for their role in building the original Disneyland Monorail System at Disneyland, which opened in 1959, and the Seattle Center Monorail, which opened for the 1962 Century 21 Exposition.[3] Both systems remain operational, with the Seattle Center Monorail still using the original Alweg trains which have traveled over one million miles. A third system, built in Turin for the Italia 61 exposition remained unused a few months after the exposition closed and was destroyed by a fire in the late 1970s, most probably set by vandals. The remnants of the system were scrapped in 1981, with the north station now being repurposed as an office building.

>In 1963, Alweg put forward a proposal to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for a monorail system that would be designed, built, operated and maintained within Los Angeles County, California by Alweg. Alweg promised to take all financial risk for the construction with the cost of the system to be recovered through fares collected. The supervisors voted down the proposal.

>Alweg's technology was licensed in 1960 by Hitachi Monorail, which continues to construct monorails based on Alweg technology around the world. What was for decades the world's busiest monorail line, the Tokyo Monorail, was completed in 1964 by what was then the Hitachi-Alweg division of Hitachi, and today's busiest monorail system, Chongqing Rail Transit, is also based on Alweg and Hitachi technology.

>After Alweg ran into financial difficulties, Alweg's German operations were taken over by Krupp. Krupp wound up all Alweg operations by 1964.[1]

>In the 1960s there was a plan to build an ALWEG monorail in the High Tatras in Slovakia.

AskReddit,fc32rha,t3_eft9mt,1577380102.0,"Preface by saying I’m horrible at connecting names to faces. I may recognize them if I’ve seen them once or twice, but it takes a few more times for me to spot someone in the wild (without the aid of photos) to say “Oh that’s Jane” or whoever. To make matters worse, I have a generic face and I’ve been confused for other people on the regular. 

I’ve had two incidents where that has massively bit me in the ass. 

1) I start talking to this woman about my age at a professional mixer. We’re getting along fine, though every once in a while she’ll say “I swear, it feels like we’ve met before.” I can’t remember her face so I assume we either met at similar event before or she’s confusing me with someone else. “No, that’s not it.... Have we gone on a date before? Do you use [app]?” I insist, stupidly, that it’s almost impossible since I don’t remember her and I haven’t used that app in years. She starts giving details of the date saying “Yeah, I’m pretty sure we did. We went to [Restaurant].” Now I’m super adamant I’ve never dated her because I hate dinner dates as first dates. Finally, she gets exasperated and we go through her phone’s message history.... and there - a few years back - is a text exchange between us that shows we went on that dinner date. I was mortified and felt so bad for making her feel so forgettable. 

2) I matched with someone on an app a few months ago. After a few messages, she reveals that we went on *several* dates before and - like girl #1 - I both don’t remember it and deny repeatedly. Once I realized she was right, i tried to apologize profusely and asked if I could make it up to her; she didn’t respond, and deservedly so."
