Some acquaintances of mine are native English speakers in Portugal and even after years of living there, they still struggle."
womenEngineers,ff2x9k5,t3_erbctf,1579527533.0,"Hi! I’m an engineering student and while I can’t give you insight on actual hiring of female engineers, I can give you another idea on how to approach this.
In the country where I’m studying, many companies do mentoring programs for woman studying STEM. I ended up participating in one and it was great. Many students end up doing internships and even staying in the companies they got to know. 
How it works is that for one year (or six months) you get a mentor within the company that gives you professional advice. You also get to shadow your mentor one or two days and visit the company grounds. They should also be there to build a bridge between the company and future graduates. 
It’s a more of a long term approach but it seems to be quite successful at getting more women engineers."
AskReddit,feq95uq,t1_fepv0x8,1579339044.0,"This was my problem with them! Don’t get me wrong, I like some good drums during the concert but it seemed like they were playing their songs only 30% of the time, the rest was the drums."
AskReddit,fegtk6v,t1_feg20jh,1579102214.0,"That description sounded almost sexual. But damn, I bet you, it’s a good feeling."
KnitHacker,fee4i5v,t3_eoixx5,1579026223.0,Funny. I looked at the picture and thought to myself this must be Portugal. Turns out I was right! Great idea to make this unique streets even more unique.
todayilearned,fdrcydb,t1_fdrbzo9,1578682698.0,"A saline injection would do the same placebo trick for a fraction of the price. I agree with you, placebo is science, but homeopathy shouldn’t be legitimised."
todayilearned,fdrcjr3,t1_fdr9632,1578682527.0,It’s all about being reasonable. Don’t overmedicate but don’t ignore serious things. People need education (especially on antibiotics) more than they need extremely overpriced sugar pills.
todayilearned,fdrc3ep,t1_fdr24pn,1578682402.0,"Money? At least in the system of the country where I live, doing homeopathy on the side would bring you more money than real medicine (at least in your first years as a doctor)."
todayilearned,fdqyfl4,t1_fdqxr5c,1578676747.0,That is a good point for anxious people and I hope that some doctors use it that way. I’m just concerned for the dishonest ones and I feel like the damage outweighs the good in it.
todayilearned,fdqy3fz,t1_fdqxvmv,1578676542.0,That’s not homeopathy. Homeopathy is about getting a substance to be diluted in water. People believe that dilution will make the drug more powerful.
todayilearned,fdqwofw,t1_fdqw6dp,1578675939.0,"It’s still legitimising homeopathy. Dishonest doctors will still choose to do it for money. 

Better just putting homeopathy completely out of the table."
todayilearned,fdqvi21,t1_fdqtgwm,1578675493.0,As it shouldn’t be. How can an MD do homeopathy? Those two are absolutely incompatible. You either do science or you don’t.
PandR,fdjjrev,t1_fdjiszr,1578474077.0,I don’t know why people get so offended with this... I’m with you.
PandR,fdjha97,t1_fdjerbk,1578470765.0,Out of curiosity: why do you think Ricky Gervais is transphobic? And please tell me the answer isn’t Caitlyn Jenner.
AskReddit,fcmltwh,t1_fcmbiri,1577780718.0,Also in German Brett means (wooden) board. Now you have another reason.
confessions,fckqwdh,t1_fcjpc1l,1577731248.0,"I also donated 5€. 

I’m a broke student but Wikipedia is extremely important. Their foundation does great things and it should be kept free and available to everyone. (Also I wouldn’t have come so far in my degree without them tbh)"
AskReddit,fbvd81r,t1_fbumga3,1577129130.0,Twenty one pilots is a huge example of upbeat songs that have a darker/sadder meaning behind them.
