ItalyInformatica,fgkl0my,t3_eyr54h,1580868018.0,"**Io non so come aiutarti, mi dispiace, ma un pensiero voglio scriverlo qui:**

Il funzionamento di Internet è cavi, ripetitori (antenne), routers, server e apparecchiuature varie (per non essere prolisso mi limito a scrivere questi); tutto il resto, ossia call-center, uffici e simili, sono completamente inutili (ad Internet), ovviamente sono utili a chi ci guadagna, da questi altri. In Italia comunque hanno fanno così ...

1. unica rete telecomunicazioni (SIP, poi denominata Telecom Italia) gestita male a livello prima statale, poi con la privatizzazione ... gestita male comunque, con molti imbrogli e malfunzionamenti, e anche con problemi legali
2. liberalizzazione delle telecomunicazioni (libero mercato), con ancora al vertice Telecom per la linea telefonica, di cui ancora detiene il controllo
3. ritardo nell'implementazione di un servizio moderno (e attualmente gran parte dell'Italia non ha [ne FTTH ne FTTC](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTTx) ... ossia, ancora ADSL)

Ora Io vorrei proprio sapere perché diavolo dobbiamo avere 10-20 compagnie Internet? Le principali sono: TIM Telecom, Infostrada gruppo Wind Tre, Vodafone che è UK, Fastweb milanese, Eolo (una lista non completa [qui](https://www.facile.it/adsl/compagnie.html)); e ce ne sono davvero molte di sconosciute, che comunque detengono potere di provider.

*inoltre tutte queste, nella maggiorparte dei casi si appoggiano alla linea telefonica Telecom col FTTC, dove comunque Telecom ha un guadagno (e spese, che ritengo inferiori al guadagno;* [fatturato e utile netto 2018](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecom_Italia)*) percentuale, e per qualsiasi problema queste compagnie possono declinare su disservizio Telecom .. e comunque a Telecom finché c'è la linea telefonica intera/parziale guadagna ...*

Tutto questo intricato (assurdo) sistema, che vantaggio può realizzare a livello del funzionamento del servizio? E anche a livello del costo del servizio?

Un articolo interessate (2018) su come stiamo messi a confronto con il resto d'Europa: [Confronto costo fibra ottica in Europa: in Italia più proposte e costo nella media](https://www.comparasemplice.it/informazioni/internet-adsl-fibra-wimax/confronto-costo-fibra-ottica-europa)

*non mi sembra comunque che la situzione sia cambiata molto, e non mi sembra neppure un vero libero mercato ...*

A me non sembra che tutto questo libero mercato aumenti veramente la qualità del prodotto abbassando i prezzi, come tutti i bontemponi pro-libero-mercato vogliono far credere. Dunque mi dispiace per te e per molti altri, ma dove c'è il libero mercato, oppure un ""falso e malgestito **singolo ente** (statale) avrai comunque questi problemi, e in più non protrai neppure chiamare in causa l'utilità di un unico ente fatto bene, perché tanto l'hanno già applicato male nel passato.
