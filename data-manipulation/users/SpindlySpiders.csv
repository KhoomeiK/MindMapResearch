He said a complete sentence, so a period to indicate the end of a sentence should naturally be included within the quotation marks. In your second example, ""the spot"" is not a sentence and shouldn't include any punctuation."
NoStupidQuestions,fffhm2e,t1_fff6u7f,1579884144.0,"I take issue with this. If you're quoting something, then putting the punctuation inside the quotation marks means that the punctuation is part of the quote. Why would you include the comma as part of the quote? That doesn't make any sense. The comma is clearly not intended to be part of the quoted text, so it should not be inside the quotation marks."

Edit: actually the secretary of transportation draws the official time zone boundaries. This is totally doable by moving states to different time zones and not observing dst. Idk why yang and everyone else talk about permanent dst. Moving the time zone boundaries seems way easier.
