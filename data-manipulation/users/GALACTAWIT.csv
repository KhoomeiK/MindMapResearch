ReverseReviewing,fdjp2gb,t3_ele8r8,1578481690.0,"Boring customer paid on time, and only needed a few small things moved. Not our ideal job because we like to move things!  We were surprised that she even needed a moving company for such small things... I mean seriously lady!!! The work took a short amount of time as expected because we are pros at our craft and we work quickly. Customer did not offer refreshments or snacks and job was barely worth our time. Customer gets a 2/5 for not challenging us and wasting our time."

trashy,fc2p08k,t3_efp5mw,1577369655.0,"I'm not in the field of psychology but I find the field fascinating and study it often. This behavior is called object permanence. To describe the behavior, it's as if a toddler has a toy and it is taken away so they immediately start crying. The child truly believes that this toy is gone forever.  People with personality disorders also have this problem with object permanence where if they're in a relationship with someone and their SO is gone, it's as if they truly are gone.

Edited: confused object permanence with cognitive dissonance."
