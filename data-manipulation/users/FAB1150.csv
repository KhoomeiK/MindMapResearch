mildlyinfuriating,ffd7lsx,t3_esvlb9,1579814979.0,I'm guilty of this. After a few hours I just think of the pen as mine and start playing with it/biting the cap. Then 1/2 seconds in suddenly it clicks that it isn't my pen and I feel super embarrassed lol

Showerthoughts,ff96pds,t1_ff9655z,1579706128.0,"Using the phone while charging isn't bad at all for the battery, if anything it charges it slower extending its lifespan. The only good charging habit there can be is not charging it to 100% but rather going at max 80-85%, and discharging it to min 25%. That's it. Charging speed makes a very minimal difference in lifespan, when you stay in the low current range (up to ~2C charging rate). If you're curious about what does 2C mean, feel free to ask! :)"

Monero,feqb1vs,t1_feq9tak,1579339620.0,"Yes, only if they are more profitable in that moment. It switches automatically between them. If you optimized your rig to mine in xmr it will mine them, don't worry.

When you start the miner for the first time it benchmarks all the coins it can mine so it knows what to do, pretty seamless. You do get paid in monero"
