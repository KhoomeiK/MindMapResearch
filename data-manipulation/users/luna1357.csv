retailhell,fgihfbf,t3_eyapne,1580821725.0,Yessssssss.    Literally want to destroy someone when they say this.  Pardon me that I had .4 seconds to breathe after my last customer.  I'm a robot and should not ever stop moving or I'll be told I look bored!
endometriosis,fgih8li,t3_eyji4s,1580821561.0,"I know surgery is what started my Endo problems, but mine was from a C-section, and so cells from inside my uterus, from being cut open, were pulled through and started growing on the outside on my uterine scar,  and all through my abdominal wall muscles.   Been 12 years and I have had 3 surgeries to remove tissue, but once even one cell is out there... It'll regrow with every single period.  Fun!   I'm not sure how the tubal works, or if your uterus is cut open for that? But maybe they are related somehow.   Good luck!  I hope you get it figured out!"
retailhell,fgigsyi,t3_eyhrfx,1580821179.0,"Is there anything better than when a lazy entitled idiot doesn't care that your arms are full of heavy stuff, and has  to make you do there shopping for them because they don't feel they should have to actually open there eyes and try to God forbid, LOOK FOR THEMSELVES, because ""that's your job"" lol.   I will never understand people."
retailhell,fgicg8n,t1_fgh91mz,1580816664.0,Seriously what kind of an entitled boob to you have to be to tell another human being that they don't deserve to take their break until you serve them lol.  I would have wanted to smack her in the face with the closed sign and say NOW DO YOU SEE IT???   (I cashier at a grocery store as well.....PEOPLE SOMETIMES!!)

Anxiety,fg7wnr7,t3_exdzz8,1580603369.0,"I'm ok unless it's really crowded, in which case I start hyperventilating and have get out as fast as I can lol.   I also get really nervous when the person behind me in line gets too close."
depression,fg61scp,t3_ewxtsr,1580549135.0,"It bothers me so bad when my family thinks depression is just ""something's bothering her right now but she'll get over it"".   I don't think anyone really understands unless they are truly depressed, what it's like to feel so exhausted by living every day and so hopeless, that you dream of not having to endure it another minute."
