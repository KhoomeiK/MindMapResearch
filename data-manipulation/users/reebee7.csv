One thing I will note is that the “stick my penis into as vaginas as possible” moment. Didn’t remember this in the novel itself, but I know Franzen has said his friend David Foster Wallace has said such a thing. And while it’s definitely minimalizing—you say misogynist, and I get it—I wonder the context. To me it’s always sounded, in Wallace’s thought, as a statement of *his own self loathing*, and at a question about the futility of existence: “despite it all, am I just a carbon, gene-carrying machine, whose only real purpose is to pass on those genes whenever I can?”

edit 1: For instance, I neither am a leftist nor consider myself a feminist, but this:

>13. Many leftists have an intense identification with the
problems of groups that have an image of being weak
(women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel
that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to
themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they
identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest
that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)

>14. Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. Clearly they are
nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and
as capable as men

Is absolute drivel.

edit 2:

>But the leftist is too far gone for
that. His feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he
2
cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist. He can feel
strong only as a member of a large organization

Though I think he's correct, this is a quirk of human psychology that, in leftists, is expressing itself a certain way--there are plenty of 'rightists' that have succumbed to the same quirk, that derive value only as a member of something larger. 

I won't continue any more. He's obviously not a dumb man, and his arguments have some merit, but I find them too sweeping, too un-nuanced, too hypocritical and hypocritically illogical to really take seriously."
