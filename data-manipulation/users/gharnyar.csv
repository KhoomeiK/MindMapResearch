Honestly, the things in there that look weird are probably because of me learning to use the app. But the measurements are correct. That day with the tiny amounts of lettuce, onion, cucumber and tomato are from a mixed chopped salad I made. I ate a handful of it and eyeballed the veggies in it. One of the few things I've ever eyeballed but I don't think it's practical to measure out each of the veggies after they've been mixed. Note to self: Don't make mixed salads anymore.

The Baked Tilapia in Olive Oil is a recipe I made in the app. I used the exact weight of my tilapias and poured exactly 1 tbsp of olive oil over them.

The tuna is very low mayo yes, it barely wets it but it's because I've been trying to keep it lower fat. 

In any case, I do admit that I've only been tracking via app for one week. I'm going to keep it going for a few weeks like this, and of course I'll attempt to get better at tracking everything.

personalfinance,fda1oau,t1_fd9ugfr,1578240705.0,"In what world is it not workable? Assuming OP's numbers are true:

Let's be conservative and assume they take home only 65% of their Salary: $95,000 * 0.65 = $61,750

**Annual Fixed Expenses** =  $(1150 + 510 + 190 + 150 + 80) * 12 = $2080 * 12 = **$24960**

**Annual Credit Card Payoff (one-time)** = **$8,000**

Annual Variable Expenses (This is always what gets people and OP didn't list anything about it so this is what we have to work out. This includes Groceries, Luxuries, Hobbies, Personal shit, property taxes, pets, pretty much everything else)

**Annual Savings** (according to OP) =  **$0**

**Left-over money** (Take Home Income - Annual Expenses) = $61750 - $24960 - $8000 = **$28,790**

So ~$29k Leftover, being pretty conservative with the take-home estimate. 

The amount left to pay off the student debt is the Leftover - Annual Variable Expenses. 

In my experience, the biggest contributor to this is food. Is OP being frugal, buying reasonable groceries and making most of their meals at home? Or are they ordering delivery every night and going out to a restaurant for lunch every work day? Do they smoke / drink / vape? Are there other big monthly expenses for hobbies? 

Let' assume OP's **Annual Variable Expenses** = $1,000 / month = **$12,000 / year**

**Debt-Payoff 2020** = $29,000 - $12,000 = **$17,000**

If they don't accrue any more CC debt, next year it will go up by $7,000.

**Debt-Payoff 2021+** = $17000 + $7000 = **$24000 / year**

If they can figure out a better car and phone situation, and work on getting their variable expenses even lower, then they'll have that much more to pay-off the debt.
