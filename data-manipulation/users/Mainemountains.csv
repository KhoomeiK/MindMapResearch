stopdrinking,ff9lns4,t1_ff95zai,1579715604.0,"I feel being an atheist has made me more critical of what I read. But I also find beauty in devotion, hope, the ritual of prayer - the illogical feelings attached to religion and spirituality are what I struggle with myself, it's why I never found home within religion, personally. However, staying on the periphery has helped me to remain unbiased, I consider every new text as a discovery mission. I love parables, especially those that come from the east. The story of Arjuna standing on the battlefield wondering why he should fight the battle is one of my favorites because his dilemma is not the one many previous scholars thought it to be."

offmychest,fekrkso,t3_epndfj,1579206144.0,"I will say, as someone who is finally starting to get a handle on life at 34 (I'm still a baby) - everything you do wrong, just the growing list of wrong helps you build enough character to find *your* version of right.  My right isn't everyone else's version of right but I'm finding this thing called being satisfied. Happy? No, I don't think I am capable of ever feeling happy but I'm on this track to being like, ""Okay, I can work with this"" or ""okay, this is working for me"". I am forging my own path instead of finding someone else's that I try to change myself to follow.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to blow smoke up your ass, I still get really fucking miserable too. I don't have a spouse/partner/person or even get laid. It's the one thing I want like CRAZY  but I want to figure myself out enough so that when I do get that person, we are right for each other and it isn't a total fuck-up and it isn't wrong, again. I always find shit that's wrong, usually it's me. I'm trying to figure out the right version of me and who she needs as a romantic interest. I'm so tired of being wrong for everyone, I'm ready for someone being right for me.

NarcissisticAbuse,fekplm3,t3_epjv2n,1579204974.0,"I saw what my exnarc thought of me. I was sent his text messages between him and his exwife where he called me a **prostitute**, **disgusting**, **ugly**, **desperate**, etc. That really pissed me off instead of helped me to heal. Do you want anger too? Speaking from experience, it's better to wonder what he thinks of you than to *know*. 

If he is using you as a job reference you can either endorse him or straight up tell prospective employers that he is lazy, unmotivated, and not a team worker. My exnarc has been unemployed almost 2 years now because he won't take a job ""beneath him"" even though he was fired from his professorship for fucking students and staff he worked with.
