joker,fecyf2b,t3_eoi894,1578989775.0,"I have bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, a scary combo I must say. I don't know if it said much about mental illness to you, but it was relatable af in the areas of childhood trauma/abuse, family members (biological or not) affecting your growth and development. The fact that he was seeing the world in terms of all good or all bad, instead of gray colors. And much more, making you realize anyone could go astray. He started getting worse and snapped after he didn't have medication anymore combined with bad life circumstances.
I have to take periodical blood tests to check my lithium blood levels, if they are too low, well by then I knew I was having episodes after episodes. I don't think I have to tell you my life story, but the struggle of mental illness depicted in the movie is there...
Though, of course, it's not about stigmatizing or demonizing mental disorders. The movie just colored those struggles in an even darker color to set up the mood of the whole movie (a comic book story).
Anyway, It really resonated with me."

The thing is that fortnite is not only battle Royale and it seems they want to invest more on Fortnite Creative. It might last as long as minecraft has, who knows. I do take breaks sometimes (one week or 2-3 months without playing it) only to enjoy it at its fullest again, or because I feel like I've gotten too addicted to it and it's stopping me from being productive."

FortNiteBR,fe6alh2,t3_enwttp,1578885548.0,"Check your settings and not only key binds. Didn't have this exact problem but a very similar one. My keybinds were fine, I had turbo building on and everything. I played on the switch and when I tried to build it was all over the place. I would only try to place one wall, and it built 2 instead. or I wanted a ramp, and it would build 2 or 3 and walls too. That was when I was on exponential and legacy settings. It got fixed when I changed to linear. After a week I went back to legacy and I didn't have the bug anymore. I don't really know what was it. Play with all of your settings. Hope it works."

bipolar,fdfxtl9,t3_ekz2xn,1578373207.0,"I experienced a mixed episode like 1 or 2 weeks ago. I was depressed most of the day but starting around 5pm I would get very irritable and would snap at people. I would cry a lot. Have racing thoughts, can't sleep and it's like a long panic attack because you get scared of how your body feels. Then my brain gets into a shock and I get dissociated or catatonic around midnight, would have to wait about an hour to start moving slowly, it takes 2 hours to be able to talk at least slow. And an hour more to talk normal again, but my thoughts are still low and I feel fried."
bipolar,fdfwaxw,t3_ekta31,1578371946.0,"I take Lithium since 2017 but it was 900mg. Had to take a whole other cocktail to feel the difference. I've tried a lot.

Now I take 1200mg of Lithium because for some unknown reasons I took the blood test and I went way under the therapeutic levels. My psychiatrist doesn't knows why that happened and me neither. I also take 100mg of Lamotrigine.

I have a liver disease so we stick to medications that don't affect the liver, which is why Lamotrigine is on a low dose as well. I'm somewhat okay now, went into a mixed manic/depressive episode for almost a month.

I take this dose now since January 3rd, wish me luck!"

FortNiteBR,fcscf8r,t3_einuu7,1577914588.0,"Exponential is a good middle ground maybe, it works for some better and others don't. This means that it doesn't gives you absolute advantage on either aim or build.
Legacy and Linear are what the pro players use the most. Legacy's aim assist is kind of like using a robot - It's too good. But your building might feel clumsy.
Linear gives you absolute control on everything you do, your sticks, sensitivities, etc. You get more precision in various areas. The aim assist in linear is very weak, but you can master your aim with practice and building runs smooth and fast.

I use the Nintendo switch to play (overall a bad console to play in AND with joycons), I got victory royales with both exponential and legacy but I was NEVER able to build. It built all over the place no matter how much I tweak the settings. So I switched to Linear 2 days ago and my building had gotten waaaay better, I still have some practice to do in both areas (building and aiming) and its what I feel comfortable in. No victory royales yet! But it's worth it because it's the type of settings that will make me grow into a better player."
