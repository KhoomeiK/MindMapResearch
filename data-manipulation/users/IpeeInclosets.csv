oldfreefolk,fd7msfe,t1_fd71qd9,1578206884.0,"I think you forget that this war would not be Iran and us only fight.  Also, for what?  When do we end it?

MY OPINION only, we need to pack our shit and leave before it turns into a proxy hotbed fustercluck.  There's not economic, social, diplomatic, or military advantage here.  We'd only fight to save face because Iran did X to our ships/troops/citizens.  This shit is a losing proposition for the US with Russia and Iran set to gain based on our domestic sentiment.

Our government completely lost the narrative by not exclaiming why the fuck is the second most powerful Iranian is in Iraq.  I blame the toxic relationship between our media and the executive branch, but the ship has sailed.

Now, I will say suppressing the narrative is why the operation was a success.  I think the strategic gain would have to paint this guy a terrorist sympathizer as part of the embassy attacks, prior to the attacks.  But I'm not a general.

Sorry, end rant."
oldfreefolk,fd7kpi2,t1_fd53u2d,1578206001.0,"Tbf...Trump has already backed off regime change.  So the only thing this attack did was limit options in the middle East to basically GTFO or freedom the fuck out of everyone.  This pussy foot half measure of increasing a few thousand troops is only going to put more of our servicemembers in a threatening space.

I hate to say it, the collective might be correct in stating we might be better off getting in their face hot and heavy.

Thinking through this really limits executive decision space in terms of anything teneble.

Most of those fucks are corrupt assholes that only want the D$.  I hope and pray this operation gained us a significant strategic advantage.
