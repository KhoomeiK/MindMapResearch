depression,ff4z5bx,t3_erjdah,1579575961.0,"If not a therapist, I suggest hiding your thoughts in something. Mine used to be hiding myself into my video games or sleeping so I wouldn't think about it.

Otherwise just let yourself flow through the thoughts and spill them onto something. Typing paragraphs of my thoughts would help me cope a little.

Coping mechanism can do good work for short time frames, but in the long run make it worse."
depression,ff4ykzk,t3_erjoya,1579575564.0,"Doesn't get any better either. Act sad everyone makes you feel like your an eyesore and push you away. Have a ment break down of sadness and still acted like a freak for having emotions instead of friends and family helping.

Men can't have emotions outside happy or basic anger from sports or games. Sadness is illegal in the mindset of society for men it seems.

Unless your a woman crying then they don't care. A man show a shrivel of sadness you're a freak and a weirdo.

Maybe with a girlfriend that cares could help, but idk anything about that. No one has ever loved me to find out."
depression,fevh6g9,t1_fevfbqc,1579397384.0,"Don't know if you don't try. Plus who knows what they will give you. Sadly I'm not to familiar with it. Since the medications I've gotten have only made it worse or done nothing.

Not saying it's the only answer, but anxiety is usually dealt with medications."
depression,feuqplw,t3_eqk81u,1579389025.0,"I feel you, with enough time you will think darker thoughts or start getting panic attacks that will make things worse.

I'd suggest getting meds from a doctor with it just getting started/worse. Outside help is the key to depression I've learned."
depression,feuo8h2,t3_eqndfm,1579388407.0,"Yeah I get this just about everyday, for work I put music in my ears right when I get up to push through it. Days off I just sleep til I gotta get up to eat.

One of these days I'm just gonna give up though, it's creeping up."
depression,feum8fj,t3_eqe3d6,1579387888.0,"For me I'm going out with hanging because my organs will be still good for use and their won't be a mess to clean up. Having only to cut the rope and bag me up.

But I'm just thinking about others after I go"
depression,feul4gt,t3_eqme9w,1579387592.0,Makes me envious of their happiness. Wish I could be happy like them without faking it.
depression,fet5uf2,t1_fepvzwq,1579372110.0,"Yeah disability is really long and drawn out, I always forget that. Chop your leg and get a protestic limb. Boom problem solved. 

Nah you could get her on some mental disability possibly. If not at least mention it to her if it involves money she may go all for it by the sounds of her. All doctors take mental illnesses seriously no matter who you are unless your doctors are terrible."
depression,fepu2e7,t1_fem5kl0,1579331302.0,"Sounds like my mom with bipolar. Disability isn't an option? By the sounds of it you sound like youcould apply. If not that, unemployment. Suicide isn't an option but as a fellow depressed person I get it and won't say that it doesn't enter my mind everyday.

Hell your mom could even get some kind of disability check at the rate she's going mentally. 

The hole your in is rather terrible been in one similar  myself only way I got out is outside help from my brother getting me a job with me carpooling with him."
depression,felhxh5,t1_fejyq5b,1579222586.0,"By the sounds of all this you need to leave and find someone else to help you. What she's doing isn't healthy for you in any way. If your stuck with here than no much u can do besides try to please her? It sounds like a shitty situation your in either way.

Gotta get outside help if you can't help yourself (not meant to sound like in a mean way)"
depression,fegddnt,t3_ep0hw6,1579088684.0,"I suggest burying the hatchet. Release your emotions to him then remove him from your life along with those who are connected to him. Can't leave anything unsaid or it will haunt you. Best way I've gotten over shitty people that I held close to my heart.

Now for work I suggest lying about having a high school diploma and try to get a factory type job since they usually pay above minimum wage and aren't to bad as long as you can listen to music. 

Jobs and depression sucks really bad, only way I get through is listening to emotional music that fits my feelings. Break up songs for break ups and angry songs for being pissed at people."
depression,fegd0f4,t3_ep0j8b,1579088242.0,Should confront her about this and ask what the hell the deal is. Ask why she went from loving you to hating you. Not your fault you can't heal at the speed  of light.
depression,feaduez,t1_fe7fvrh,1578947418.0,"Glad to help, if you have a sample or a link I'd love to give a listen"
depression,fe9bbhw,t1_fe6meb3,1578936036.0,"Usually it's single songs from certain bands or rappers. Sometimes I go through all their stuff though.

Rock bottom - Eminem, Snuff - Slipknot, Let Me Die - Lil Happy Lil Sad, Someone Who Cares - Three Days Grace, Suicidal Thoughts - Jake Hill & Josh A, Falling - Ollie and the best for last Broadripple Is Burning -  Margot & The Nuclear So And So's (uncensored). 

I also listen to classical piano music, but most people don't get emotional from a solo piano."
depression,fe5of82,t3_enpa4x,1578872144.0,"I feel you. I can't recall the last time I've been truly happy. Theirs the fake/short happy I get from laughter at a good comedy/joke, but otherwise I feel miserable and suicidal."
depression,fe5gjxm,t1_fe4n8kz,1578869174.0,"Thinking the same thing, sounds make believe"
OkCupid,fc4lm6p,t1_fc477cf,1577420298.0,Hmm I'll try this. Ty
