If you don't know to resist the hatred they are trying to sell, well... that's where the extremism is being made.

I'm not neccesarily defending nor supporting mgtow. I'm just explaining my experience with it after being cheated on in 6 year relationship for succumbing to illness/disability. They definitely use those sorts of situations to sway opinions.  It's hard to differentiate where that line is though. Was mgtow meant to help guys in the beginning, but was infiltrated?
