I didn’t know this until recently, but apparently after every session, even when I was going 3x a week, I want to play one. I don’t know the last time I played a board game but apparently something about ECT really makes me want to haha"
ect,ff9ce1i,t1_ff852x2,1579709801.0,"Yup the acute phase was the worst for me, but luckily now I barely remember it haha. Definitely MUCH better when it’s only once a week"
ect,ff9cb7w,t1_ff6e68t,1579709741.0,"Sorry for the delayed response; I also have chronic health probs and have been in a flare since last week, so I wanted to reply when I had a little less brain fog (and had to ask my mom since my memory now sucks and I also don’t really remember the acute phase, but that’s normal). Still have some though, so I hope I make sense haha. 
Okay so I have more side effects than most I believe, esp since I have those chronic health issues, so don’t take what happens to me as it’ll def happen to you. I have a lot of nausea and pain (including migraine) after treatments. They give me something in the room as a pre-treatment, and I take my own meds, but there’s still pain (one of my issues is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which causes lots of pain, so I think it aggravates that). I usually need a nap afterwards (but I also go early in the morning so I had less sleep beforehand) and am very drained for at least that day, and often the next day. I have problems with getting IVs run there, but that’s again due to health issues that I have. I’ve had a lot of memory loss, but stuff does come back to me. It’s like it’s behind a veil now, so once something triggers the memory, I have access to it again. But I have trouble with short-term and long-term (again, I don’t think it’s a typical reaction, so remember this). My mom said I had problems with twitching and itching during the acute phase, but it’s been a while since I mentioned it. I’d still say it was worth it, despite the problems I’ve had, since I was battling suicidal thoughts just about all day every day again. I can’t take Lithium because of one of my other disorders, have tried 20+ pills, and TONS of different kinds of therapy, but none of it lasted for long. Both my depression and anxiety are a lot better now. I stopped having PTSD dreams (well, I stopped dreaming at all for quite a while) at some point after I started treatment too, so that’s also a bonus. Now that they’re more spaced apart I’m dreaming sometimes again. I think my BPD is better now too, but that’s not something I’ve been purposely tracking/keeping an eye on, so I can’t say for sure. I’ve had a lot of struggles, but it was worth it. I’m hoping I can soon get to a point where I don’t need them anymore, but there’s still some issues I’m having. I have treatment on Friday, and it’ll be the first time it’s 4 weeks in between (not on purpose), and I’m mostly still doing well, so it’d be awesome if I could bump it down again. I’ve heard lots of stories about people who just need an aspirin afterwards and they’re good to go, so don’t let my experience hold you back. I think I have like 15 physical+mental health diagnoses, so I have a lot of things to irritate during all of this lol. I hope yours goes well!"

ehlersdanlos,feinhbk,t3_ep4b0y,1579142653.0,"Yup, all the time. I’ve dislocated one of my knees a few times in my sleep and subluxate a lot. I sleep with five splints on (both knees, both wrists, and a trigger finger splint). I also use pillows to help prevent my knees from hyperextending. Want a u-shaped pillow. Sleeping on my back only I discovered helps a lot, but I still have to adjust during the night because I can’t stay in exactly the same spot for too long without that hurting either. I agree with others - I want to sleep because I’m exhausted, but also don’t want to because it’ll be painful."

I’ve learned that gastroparesis is common with EDS (along with POTS and MCAS). That sucks they think you might have that! I see a gastroenterologist tomorrow since I’ve been having more problems again (also have Celiac, IBS, GERD, and fructose malabsorption). I’m hoping I don’t have gastroparesis, but we’ll see. Thankfully I don’t have MCAS at least. There’s some good channels on YouTube of people who have EDS that you could follow (Izzy Komblau is one and she has gastroparesis too) for more info. Obviously not really for medical advice, but it’s nice watching people with the same issues and seeing what kind of things they do for symptom management to get new ideas. I hope you don’t have vascular either! 

I’ve been told I’m a tough cookie haha but I never really believed anyone until recently when I was writing out things that have happened to me (I’ve only scratched the surface here lol). You sound tough too! It’s been nice talking to you today as well. I’ve been rather anxious about my MRI coming up. Not so much about the test itself, but what the results may be. Chiari and CCI sound scary, but at least it gives me something to treat and potentially relieve some of my symptoms. I can’t do a whole lot anymore and it’s really frustrating (as I’m sure you understand!) I’m glad I’ve been able to help you out."
POTS,fe3x0w6,t1_fe3qeuc,1578853609.0,"That’s the main reason I got an Apple Watch too! I’ve been too scared to wear it in the shower though. Logically I know it’s supposed to be okay since swimmers can wear it, but I’m still not used to electronics being able to get wet lol. I get pretty symptomatic in the shower though, so I should probably start doing that. Since chlorine is okay, I’m guessing shampoo/conditioner and soap is too?"

chiari,fe2xa3l,t1_fe2pd7p,1578843897.0,"Yes I meant to ask if they said which type they think you have/if you’d seen a geneticist. My doctor was sure I had the hypermobile type. I had a heart echo done just to be sure it wasn’t vascular, but I agree that I have hEDS (and most geneticists won’t test you if that’s what you have since they haven’t found the gene for it yet).
That’s good you started the suing process. It’s astonishing seeing the types of people who are in the medical profession sometimes. Someone’s got to graduate at the bottom of the class, though. That sucks it’s taking a toll on you though! Do you have people in your life that can help you out? I just have my mom helping me out when she can, but she’s 70, so we’re quite the pair lol (I’m 32). My two cats are pretty awesome too. I don’t have seizures on my own, but I have induced ones via ECT (to treat my depression), but they at least give me something so my whole body doesn’t spasm as much. Those are painful, with meds, so I can’t imagine how much pain you must be in! It’s nice having people to talk to who understand though."
chiari,fe2k503,t3_enncuh,1578839359.0,"Omg that’s horrible!! I’m so sorry. I wonder if you’d be able to sue the hospital for negligence? I’m not sure what else to say; I’m getting my MRI in a couple days (they’re also looking for CCI, so it’s an upright MRI). I also have POTS and hEDS though (and a ton of other things). I was diagnosed with POTS in 2011 and hEDS last year, but I’m here if you want to talk about either one. Online support groups are a great thing to join (in-person ones too if you can find them in your area/are able to attend them). I hope the surgery works wonders on you and your symptoms improve!"
chiari,fdwwxo5,t1_fdwrtmb,1578763115.0,"Oh man I’m sorry your mom isn’t supportive. I hate it when people act like that. I don’t *want* to be sick, but I *am* sick. Well, hang on to the hope that things will change come May.  At least you have a record of it getting worse for the next neurosurgeon you’ll see. Still, sounds hella frustrating. I hope you can find a way to manage the symptoms somewhat until then. I’m just trying things out to attempt to make things more manageable to soldier on until I find the out the results (like I recently discovered sleeping on just my back and putting something under my neck helps me not be in as much pain)."
chiari,fdwpfxt,t1_fdwm51u,1578761103.0,"I know I’ll need a neurosurgeon at some point if it’s Chiari, but he wanted to just start me with someone in case that’s not what it is since I have almost daily migraines that no one cares about so far (my last neurologist treated me like I was making it up and told me she couldn’t do anything for me. My shitty PCP put me on a beta blocker even though I was already on one, so I switched even though I knew I shouldn’t have, and ended up in the ER with a low hr. I have Medicaid so the only PCPs I can see are students and it’s terrible). I figured the neurologist might have a better idea of neurosurgeons in the area, but if I end up needing any of the surgeries, I’ll probably have to travel across the country for a doctor who has a lot of experience in it. Plus I have to have referrals for specialists with my insurance, so I basically just have to wait for the results to come in and go from there. My test is on Tuesday, so hopefully I can get the ball rolling soon (although my next rheum appt isn’t until the end of the month, so I may have more impatiently waiting ahead of me lol). 

Yes, he is a dream, I’m so grateful to have found him! As for your diagnosis, maybe print out the Beighton score and demonstrate how you can do enough of the things for a diagnosis? I wish more doctors would listen. Yes we do online research but we LIVE with all these symptoms, so we know what we’re talking about. It’s not like it’s super hard to figure some of these out; they just have to get over their ego and listen to the patient once in a while. I found Chiari and CCI through EDS groups and there’s symptoms I was always told weren’t an issue (like my head feels too big and is hard to hold up on its own) that are actually related to those things, so it’s good that we have the option of online research. I made a list of all the symptoms I have of each thing and took it into the doctor to show him, that’s how I got my scans ordered. That’s the only advice I can think of. I hope you find your answers soon so you’ll be able to treat the issue instead of just suffering with it!"

chiari,fdwkaku,t1_fdwht7b,1578759586.0,"He’s actually my rheumatologist! I’m in Michigan in America. I was surprised how well it went when I brought it up. He wasn’t that familiar with CCI, I’m the one that told him it needed to be an upright MRI, and he was just like “oh, okay” and wrote it down. It was amazing. I have a referral for neurology, but the place he was going to send me to doesn’t take my insurance, so I have to see someone else. But yeah, this doctor is amazing. He diagnosed me with hEDS this past year (I’ve had many other doctors laugh at me when I brought it up) and he treats me with respect, something that doesn’t happen too often, sadly. He believes the things I tell him and looks upset when he doesn’t know the solution, but he *tries* to figure it out. I wish he could be my doc for everything! That’s crazy you’d have to go to a different country for that MRI. I have to go a few states over but that’s not nearly as bad. I hope you find a doctor who figures things out for you soon (and is actually nice)!"
chiari,fdtgz4n,t3_en06p9,1578716615.0,"I (and my doctor) suspect I could have Chiari and/or CCI. I’m getting my upright MRI next week (have to travel out of state to do it). I totally understand the hoping to find something. If they find something, then it gives you a plan on how to treat it and (hopefully) make symptoms improve/go away. If they don’t find anything, then you’re stuck with not knowing what to do. I hope you find answers soon!"
ehlersdanlos,fdocddo,t1_fdninrs,1578602608.0,"You can get finger splints on Etsy now, too, for a much cheaper price than the silver ring splint company. I got a swan splint for one of my fingers from EvaBelleJewelry, and it’s working great. My hand therapist thinks it’s great and even said he was going to start recommending them as well, because my splint was $85 instead of $100+ (and they have discounts a lot) and is excellent quality. I also agree with others for OP to go to a hand therapist so they can see what splints would be beneficial and get the proper measurements. Splints definitely help."

facepalm,fckek38,t1_fckdbap,1577723568.0,"Thanks! I’m actually doing waaay better than when it first happened at least, but still have a bit to go. After I got the protection order (which is no longer current) I never heard from him again at least. From what I heard, he moved in with another chick he was cheating on me with and I think they were expecting a kid? I feel bad for those kids (she already had 4 or 5). But thankfully I live in a different state and don’t hear from any of those people anymore. I have a ton of health problems (not related to that) that I have to deal with, but still better than being with him!"
facepalm,fckactg,t1_fcjt8p4,1577720786.0,"We were at a party (at my friend’s parents’ house). He was pissed because it wasn’t a big rager, just a normal gathering of people that involved drinking. I was sick of him treating me like shit all the time (we were still together at that point), so when he started yelling at me I told him to fuck off. He said he was going to take the car and go back home. I bought the car, it was in my name, I just let him drive it since he didn’t have a car. However he thinks everything is his, so he wanted it, and said he didn’t care that it was mine. I fought back just about the entire time, managed to jump over him while he was sitting in the car, got the keys, and threw them so he couldn’t drive. He knocked me out at least once (I can’t really remember all of it) and choked me a bunch. I eventually yelled for help (was scared to do it before then), people came over, he ran away. He was found. The cops interviewed me in a room full of people who I didn’t know. Never even attempted to get me in a room alone or ask anyone to leave. I was afraid to tell them everything, especially with a bunch of strangers staring at me. He ended up getting the very minimum domestic violence charge. When I told my story in court the judge got visibly pissed and said he would’ve never signed off on it if he had known what happened and that my ex should’ve gone to prison for 10 years for attempted murder. My ex tried to say a lot of it didn’t happen but the judge believed me. He also tried to get a reduction in his sentence because the day of his sentencing hearing was his 30th birthday; he actually thought that would work. I’ve gone through a shit ton of therapy but still shook while writing this out. Not the first time I’ve almost died, but the first time it was caused by another human being (others were medical). I don’t want to go into super specifics of that night or the other things he did to me during our relationship, but did I answer your question enough? I would’ve been curious if I happened across that too haha"
facepalm,fcixhfq,t3_eh9mbj,1577672166.0,"I said a statement at the sentencing hearing after my ex tried to kill me. Was a few pages (a lot had happened), but nothing fancy about it. Afterwards, apparently he and/or his mother (who was also there) told everyone I wrote a poem, because they didn’t know how to articulate that I had a statement. Like, thanks? I’m not good at poetry, and definitely not a few pages worth, so thanks for the compliment? People are weird.  I have no idea how they got “a poem” out of that, but it still makes me chuckle (and glad I’m no longer surrounded by people that dumb)."

I sublux and dislocate in my sleep and wake up in too much pain to be able to sleep without them. Maybe look into wearing splints while sleeping?

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fca9ksl,t1_fc98pdg,1577565196.0,"I once had to drive myself to the ER, in a massive amount of pain, because my boyfriend at the time didn’t want an ambulance showing up at his house since there were drugs and stuff. I got there and found out I had a DOUBLE kidney infection and was hospitalized for a few days (well, I found out the next day after I woke back up). He refused to visit me because he’s “afraid” of hospitals (he’s just an ass. There are people with legitimate fears but he just lies about everything). I finally left after he tried to kill me because I wouldn’t let him steal my car. That’s just a couple of the many stories I have of that guy. I have hEDS, POTS, and a ton of other things (physical and mental). I have yet to have a relationship where the person I’m with actually believes me in regards to how sick I am and how much pain I’m in.
