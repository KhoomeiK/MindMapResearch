I was raised mostly on pop (in terms of what my peers listened to) and largely was indifferent to my parents' eighties bands. I'm learning guitar because it's fun and also I want to write and play pop songs.

To my untrained ear, many Beatles songs sound nice, but... They *sound* simple. It's been mentioned a few times in this thread, actually. In contrast, I keep hearing about how simple modern pop songs are, but they seem to have more going on.

How do I differentiate between those kinds of complexity? Basically, how do I go about learning to appreciate music?"

selfimprovement,fepgchk,t3_eq4b8q,1579319801.0,"I would advise slowing down. Read one personal development type book, then read one or two books of a different subject--perhaps something relevant to your field or a hobby, or perhaps fiction of some sort (if you aren't usually into fiction, it's worth trying books and short stories that have won prizes.)

That gives you time to process, practice and apply what you've learned. I'm not suggesting that you forget about self improvement while reading (listening to) the other books. This is the real test.

Example: I listened to Cal Newport's *Digital Minimalism* in about 7 days of walking my dog. The book suggests starting with a 30-day unnecessary electronics fast, then a slow and conscious addition of devices and apps that actually improve your life. Had I started the fast on the first day of reading, I would still have 23 days of fasting left. Reading another book with different advice and suggestions in the meantime would diminish my tech fasting experience. (Although during the tech fast I should not be listening to audiobooks either, so perhaps not the best example.)

So, add a buffer."

selfimprovement,feido75,t3_epb16r,1579136080.0,"High school is four years of your life during which you deserve to be happy as much as any other four years in your life. A long commute and few friends (in high school, where people can have more friends that we do as adults) are not a recipe for happiness.

If you're a serious enough student to get 9/10 in your 8th grade exams, you're good enough to break ahead of the pack in this new school. You can impress universities just as much by being a top student in a little pond than an average student at a prestigious high school. If you're serious about university, I do recommend you try quite hard... but again, NOT to the point of sacrificing your happiness. I tried way too hard in high school and it took a huge toll on my mental health and eventually my grades nosedived.

Basically... don't take high school *too* seriously such that you live for the future and not for the present, but at the same time, take it seriously enough that you'll have a future you're happy with. It's a question of balance.

By the way, high school students can definitely do more than high school with their time! The most impressive students at my high school did one or two extracurricular activities very well. Some of them were organized activities like band or sports, but some were completely outside of school, like a research project under a local university professor, or writing a novel... The point is, you are much more than the prestige of your school."
DecidingToBeBetter,fecmvko,t3_eo9sh7,1578977865.0,"I usually journal for as long as I need to about why the goal matters to me, whether I'm considering any alternatives, etc. I do try to get very specific. I make sure to include SMART goals (tried and true) and now James Clear's method detailed in *Atomic Habits* (which is new to me.) It looks like this:

Goal: have clear skin

Habit: Skincare routine twice a day

* Make it obvious: leave skincare products on counter
* Make it attractive: use warm water when washing, use products with a neutral or pleasant smell, use a soft towel to dry off
* Make it easy: ...It's already pretty easy. I guess here I'd put ""don't overthink things and change up the routine too often.""
* Make it rewarding: take daily pre-routine selfies. Have a laminated paper taped to the mirror where I check off each morning and evening with a dry erase marker.
* Keep getting better: Keep checking for unusual irritation or appearance. Swap out products no more often than once a month, one at a time, and with careful research. Check my selfies (if you have a menstrual cycle, it's important to do it on roughly the same part of your cycle since that can affect your skin quite a lot.)

There can be multiple habits for a goal, and multiple goals for the same habit, but the important thing to note is that goals are met by building systems to help you achieve them."

Wednesday I started a group on Meetup called something like ""Free fitness for beginners."" Meetup announced it locally and there are now ninety members!!! I guess I'm not the only one intimidated by the cost and social aspects of exercising.

DecidingToBeBetter,fe1v76q,t1_fdztcss,1578831192.0,I am starting something new tonight based on my reading of James Clear's book Atomic Habits. I'm going to keep my phone in the bathroom along with clothes for the next day.

selfimprovement,fe1u1mv,t3_eni1nq,1578830822.0,"The fact that this came on suddenly sounds like depression. If it isn't, then it's depression-like. If you at all can, see a doctor about a diagnosis.

I would prioritize your sleep schedule. I have depression (bipolar actually) and sleep is the cornerstone of my health. Try changing your sleep habits. I can elaborate on that if you want, but in short, try switching your gaming to the day and your sleeping to the night. (When I had a similar problem, I started up 24 hours until evening and then crashed. A sleep doctor actually recommended this!) It's small, but it's something to build on. You can even start by keeping the windows covered during the day, but then the next step is to open them. Sunlight (in moderation) is very important. No screens in the evening, etc. The standard sleep hygiene stuff.

When you don't know what to do with yourself in the evenings, read Atomic Habits by James Clear, then apply what he suggests... Like, actually do that. It's so easy to read books like his and passively learn. Don't do that. Use what he says to build good sleep hygiene and move on from there.

Commit to something that you think is important or feel that you have an aptitude for (a good place to start.) Commit to it for three or six months and work on it regularly.

DecidingToBeBetter,fdv2zmv,t3_en2c6i,1578742606.0,"Agree about talking to a counselor. The focus thing could be either a symptom of depression or another mood issue, or it could be a roundabout cause. Those require different approaches for treatment so it's important to know which it is, and no one can tell you but a mental health professional.

If you do choose to go to a counselor, be an active participant, not a consumer. Ask for ""homework"" and do it whole-heartedly. I find that it's important to set up trigger events it a schedule for doing therapy homework, or I don't think to do it. Give everything a fair try, but once you have, don't be afraid of taking only what works for you. There are many treatment options it there that work better for different people.

Finally, some encouragement. Although I have a mood disorder, I find it fairly easy to focus in class. This isn't really due to conscious strategies if some sort. It's the way I am naturally. There is no reason you don't deserve that same leg up.

My feminity is a significant part of who I am. I strive to be a ""good woman"" not in a stereotypical, subservient way, but in a way that embraces the best aspects of feminity--compassion, gentleness, and a passion for equal rights in every way.

 I am in no way saying that someone of another gender can't be proud of having these traits, just that I associate them with feminity just like I associate toughness and stoicism with masculinity.

I want to be clear: everyone is free to strive for any of these traits without ridicule (or should be). But whether gender is a social construct or not, ""we live in a society,"" so it is very much real."
DecidingToBeBetter,fdp3bk0,t3_emb1b3,1578619001.0,"It isn't all about whether people like you. It also matters whether you like them. If someone leaves me on read, I like them less (trivially so unless it happens several times with no explanation.) You deserve to be treated with respect and politeness, and it's polite and respectful to respond in a conversation.

If you have social anxiety or low self esteem, you may feel like you aren't in a place to be picky, and you just want people to like you. I think you should act like you deserve that respect anyway. Fake it until you make it--it's not just a cliche, it's advice that multiple books and multiple therapists have given me (in different words.)

It isn't easy to just say ""find better friends,"" because how do you do that? But if you look at each relationship as transactional, and not just you hoping to please them, you might feel more confident. Remember, confidence isn't knowing you won't be rejected, it's knowing that you'll be fine if you are.

That's all assuming that these people are leaving you on read an excessive amount. The larger a group chat, the less likely people are to respond... even close friends. It drives me crazy but it's true, and it isn't personal. It's just psychology. So your class chat is probably an example of that, a sort of bystander effect if you will. However, in a one on one convo, a worthwhile friend will respond if they can and apologize if they can't do so in a timely manner (the length of time depends on what you've established given each others' schedules etc.) If your friends aren't living up to that, don't dump them, but do consider adding a bit of emotional distance.

I was a bit nervous that she wouldn't read it at all, but she referenced it several times throughout and had actually read quite carefully. Talking about my history took up about 30 minutes of the session. She let me start where I wanted, which for me meant jumping around... I started with the events since last May (when I was hospitalized and got a new diagnosis) and once I reached present say she asked some questions that led me to talk about my origin story.

After that, I asked her a few questions about her therapy style. I'm not a very coherent interviewer, but she responded very well to the question ""so what is this going to look like?"" Then we talked a bit about my insurance concerns.

Note that I was evaluating her the entire time: whether she had read what I'd written, how well she listened, what I thought of her insights, etc. It is so tempting for me to go with the first person who schedules a consultation because getting to that point is arduous.

selfimprovement,fd37q9l,t3_ejvb85,1578155535.0,"Pick your career very carefully. If that means going to college, then work hard in high school, pick a major carefully, and work hard in college--not just in your classes but also in relevant career experience such as shadowing, volunteering, internships, etc.

Choose your career according to that has good earning potential in California, won't give you too much debt, and is something you think (after research and shadowing) that you could stand to do. And within that choice, give yourself options where possible. For example: I went to college for microbiology. The math, physics and chemistry courses offered a life sciences track and a physical sciences track. Anyone could take the physical science track, but if you took life sciences you were stuck with them. Assuming I would enjoy being surrounded by biology students, I took the life sciences track. Two years in, I realized how much I hated the life sciences... But I was stuck. I wanted to switch to computer science and couldn't. So, options.

An author I very much respect named Cal Newport wrote a book called ""so good they can't ignore you,"" which says that true enjoyment of your career comes once you have built a certain level of competence. You don't need to love it immediately, but you need to be able to live with it until you get there.

The most important thing about chasing a career is that you have to take initiative. I learned that too late. You need to go out and meet people with that job and related jobs. You need to ask for internships, etc before they offer.

Frugality matters as well, but if you don't have money to manage as a high school freshman, then just learn about it and worry more about it later. Your career is something you can prepare for now."

January is a ""no-spend"" month. I pay bills and spend the minimum on groceries, personal care products, underwear if needed... But no frivolous spending on movie tickets, eating out, books, etc. Books are good, but libraries exist for a reason! I'm not trying to cut out just bad spending but anything that's optional. It isn't intended to be sustainable, it's intended to force me to reflect on my relationship with money. And it's going well so far!

One of my goals for this year is to get to a point where I don't dread reading books. The idea currently intimidates me. That's a subset of the goal of improving my focus.

Whenever these thoughts popped up I forced myself to remember that I ate animals products every day of my life until one day I didn't. When I mentally criticized those people, I was mentally criticizing myself.

We are all worthy of criticism at some point, but what that mindset allowed me to do was have compassion for non-vegans (aka most of the people I know and love.)
