Based on the ""but we killed loads of Vietnamese, so we won!"" argument, the USSR were the losers of WW2, but that's not the case. They were on the winning side, gained territory, and became a world superpower."
electricvehicles,fewuc5o,t1_fetpv2h,1579419613.0,"What are these signs that VW isn't focussed on EVs? This is just a QA mistake in some infotainment software. It's an amusing mistake, but it's not really a big deal. 

They've investing way more than anyone in EVs. They're converting old factories. They have the most inexpensive EVs on the market. They're rolling out charging networks all over Europe and North America.

Their CEO literally said that their choice is to embrace EVs or end up like Nokia.

To say they aren't focussed on EVs is at worst a lie, and at best a conspiracy theory."

UKPersonalFinance,feriu4c,t3_eqfdmd,1579354444.0,"This is why I frequently butt heads with people online when the topic of ""I'm in a position to buy a house/flat, should I buy in a lump sum?"" comes up and people go ""NO. NEVER! Put just enough in to get a lowish interest rate and invest the rest!""

Yeah, it's almost certainly better in terms of money alone to have a low-interest mortgage, and bang the rest of the money into a S&S ISA or something, but the feeling of relief of having a home paid off forever must be a lovely feeling.

I felt immense tranquillity, joy, and relief just at paying off my car when I was able to. Imagine how a bloody *house* would feel.

E: People are saying I'm not making sense because you're worse off. I KNOW, THAT'S MY POINT! You're worse off financially, but you should *also* consider the mental aspect of it. Having no mortgage payments to pay and no debt has a profound and extremely positive mental impact, even though you'd *probably* be better off dumping your money into savings."
Android,fergxkx,t1_fer557a,1579353710.0,"Nope. That's not the case. Retailers and even OEMs may try to tell you this, but that's not what the law is.

And to OEMs like Apple or Samsung, as well as legal jurisdiction, there is no difference between you repairing your device and some other not-apple/samsung certified repair shop fixing your device."
electricvehicles,feqrywd,t3_eqee7b,1579345352.0,"TL;DR:

Drag racing, the Model 3 Perf. had a much better start, but the 911 would eventually pass it to win.

Rolling drag race, Model 3 again pulled off quicker and whilst the 911 did again eventually overtake the Tesla, it was at a very high speed that you're unlikely to drive at unless you're on a tremendously fast road. So Tesla won there.

Not particularly surprising.

Braking test was very surprising to me, though. It was a draw. I was expecting it to easily be a Porsche victory.

I know it was ""only"" a Carrera model, but I was expecting a braking victory for Porsche nonetheless."

E.g. If you break your phone's screen, then get it repaired by yourself or some guy at a stand in a shopping centre, your warranty *is not* void. You'll still have the at least 2 year EU warranty (More in some places)."
