So are we done or do you want me to respond to the rest of your message. Is it really that difficult to discuss an issue with someone you has a different outlook than you?

The problem is that you are focusing on fairness instead of rights. It's not fair that women get to have sex first and if there is an undesirable outcome they have more options. It's not really fair the women should bear the physical toll of pregnancy but that's just the reality of the situation. A woman exercising her options is not a violation of the fathers rights.

It's not fair that people born into wealth have nicer things than me but I that doesn't give me the right to take their things.

The right to remove a fetus is granted by the same right that says you may remove a parasite. The fact that there are other consequences doesn't remove that right.
