AmItheAsshole,ffhguiv,t3_etmif3,1579934654.0,"NTA I have a friend who’s 22, she’s not on the spectrum but no one knows what’s wrong with her (something in her brain stopped working right when we were 13) and she carries a beanie baby every where she goes. She’s done it for almost 10 years as a comfort thing. If it makes your daughter feel safe or secure then your good. While I can see where your other children are coming from they need to understand it’s something they’re sister still needs right now and they need to suck it up and accept that"

Me and my older cousin would be at his house and we would go take turns sitting and talking with him in his room. When it was my cousins turn I would go to the bathroom but I would have to walk passed the computer desk, which for some reason had a T-Rex skull sitting on it. When I would go past it, it’s eyes would light up red then it would grow into a full T-red skeleton and talk to me. I wish I could remember what it would tell me, but I would always wake up before we finished talking. I still have it every once in a while 15 years later but it’s rare"
