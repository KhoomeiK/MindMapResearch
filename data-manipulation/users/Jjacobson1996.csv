It’s a lever, a very very heavy lever that requires conscious effort to hold in the on position. At times it gets to heavy to hold any longer and you let go. But then next time you put your weight behind that lever again and you will be able to hold it for a bit longer. That lever will always be there, sometimes it will be light and others impossibly heavy, but you’ve  got to keep pushing back and it will get easier and easier. But never gone."
