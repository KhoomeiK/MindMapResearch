BreakUps,ff5s528,t3_ertk3k,1579608157.0,"Firstly, I'm really sorry you're going through this. It SUCKS, like it really sucks. 

The best thing you can do right now is go no contact, I made the mistake and still am making the mistake of being in touch with my ex. At the beginning it only hurt me more, I'd be waiting by my phone for the next text, whilst he was out with god knows who doing god knows what whilst I was at home in a mess ... I'd find out information that would only cause harm and more upset. If he wanted to contact you .. they would. Show him how strong you are. 

I know this is a hard time for you right now but things get better I promise. Right now you need to focus on you, cry if you need to but don't sit in and let it consume you, get outside in the fresh air, chat with family/friends, write it down, go out and have a bloody good time and don't look back!

 Here to chat if you need someone to listen :)"

But as time goes on it gives you time to reflect and actually realise why they left ... he will realise but he will do so only on his own terms. He's most probably using this as a coping mechanism right now, anything to feel anything other than sad.
