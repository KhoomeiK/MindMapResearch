antimeme,ffl96xi,t1_ffl542e,1580036650.0,I think what you mean are photochromic lenses which get darker the more UV light hits the surface but that doesnt necessarily mean they are better. Normal sunglasses that have a set light filter always have an UV filter in them unless you buy them from some cheap store but even then they almost always got an UV filter. The color alone wont tell one how good they filter ultra violet light.

TIHI,ffio1ke,t1_ffhz7fj,1579978484.0,"I understand vegan people who do it for the healthy part and vegan who do it for the ethnicity, I am vegan myself. But I cant wrap my head around the mindset of people who are simply vegan because they need to tell people how bad they are. Are they trying to shine the light of shame away from themselves so they can point fingers at others? Do they simply like to put guilt in other people's hearts? I just dont get it. People like you are the reason why so many laugh about us. You should feel embarrassed.

We are probably the only kind of species that effectively kills their food with as little pain as possible and I dont see what's wrong with that. Sure, you could cherry pick the big companies and say that this is literally how everyone treats animals but that's just not true. The number of humane slaughterhouses and farms where the comfort of animals will always be priority number one keeps increasing, regulations get stricter every year and people slowly start to get such a mindset that eating meat once a week is enough. But here you are, saying that everyone who eats meat is a sick fuck. What about other animals who put venom in their pray to eat them alive? Let them bleed to death by ripping off their testicles or crawl inside their belly through the arse to eat them from inside out while they are still breathing? Why are we the badies? The badies here are people like you who just yell bulkshit instead of doing something."
