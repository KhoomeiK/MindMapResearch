If you hear a kid going MOMMOMMOMMOM... you know that mom has taught the kid she will ignore him until he says her name enough times. (By not responding until sue gets tired of hearing him say ""mom"" over and over.) He's not trying to piss her off. He's communicating with her the way she's taught him to."
