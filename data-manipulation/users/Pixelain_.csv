Dogtraining,fe1bht8,t3_enc66e,1578824714.0,"I have a mixed herding pup and he does this! So far it happened only when his close pack (my boyfriend, our other dog and me) separate in any combination. He particularly dislikes to lose sight of his brother (who is completely blind and still learning to walks in crowded environments) and will stop and bark in a very sad way. 

Clicker training is definitely helping! They are usually bad at generalising things, don't worry, It'll work eventually. In the meantime, try and teach her the quiet command, maybe? Just so everything gets less stressful for everyone (:"
Dogtraining,fe10qqn,t1_fe0xtu0,1578821226.0,Thank you for your response! Would you be able to tell me if those puppy socialization times usually happen under some sort of supervision of a behavior professional? Do big chains offer these or mostly local businesses?
puppy101,fe0z80g,t3_enji1j,1578820657.0,"I'm glad you shared this thought. It's so easy to be overwhelmed by the constant jumping, biting, running or barking and tired of that permanent state of being paying attention to them... Then they grow up and you're suddenly missing those days. Hell, I looked at a picture from 2 months ago and I already miss those fluff balls of craziness they were! I cleaned poop of the WALL for two weeks in those days, what the hell am I thinking?? Hahaha.  

Hey, your puppy is gonna be ok in no time! Money sometimes (or maybe very often in my case) is tight but we always make it work somehow. He's lucky to have you and he'll always remember who takes care of him in those bad times (:"

puppy101,fdy4imp,t1_fdxls4x,1578776059.0,"I usually threat them, with my nicest puppy voice, with chopping off their paws and feeding it to the street cats. I felt kinda bad the first time but it gives so much relief for all the $100 stuff they destroy and stopped feeling bad. I still love them more than anything in the world and they know it haha"
dogs,fdy21wb,t1_fdxx5ef,1578775214.0,"Hm, we're clearly joking. Some people are scared of dogs for a number of reasons and are in their right to not love random dogs in their path. Even my mom doesn't show grand feelings toward my dogs and she's generally ok with having them around - I don't think she's any less of a person for that. Some people are thinking of their problems or having a terrible day or suffering from a hellish headache, they are not obligated to love all random dogs the same way I do. If seeing dogs doesn't make their days better, who am I to say otherwise? That said, dogs or no dogs, I hope you have a nicer day!"
dogs,fdxj3zl,t3_en286p,1578769185.0,">I take great personal offense if I'm walking her or we're driving somewhere and she has her head sticking out the window and I notice people that don't even shoot a brief glance her way. Even worse are people who do notice her but don't seem to, for whatever reason (mental deficiency? an inability to appreciate beautiful things?) really take in the splendor and majesty of the creature they're witnessing. If I was Supreme Dictator of Earth (a title and position I made up just now) this would be the test used to determine who gets sent to the labour camps or live freely under my just an benevolent rule.<

I just wanted to say I fully understand this feeling. My dogs are beautiful and incredibly awesome, they behave wonderfully for 5m olds and they DESERVE people's attention. Who the hell are you, young lady who passed us by and glanced at them with NOT SO MUCH AS A SMIRK IM YOUR FACE? Ugh, these people. Ugh."
RedDeadOnline,fczupau,t1_fctnzbi,1578108930.0,Just found it thanks to you!
puppy101,fcu16s9,t3_eiwwvl,1577969054.0,"My puppies have free reign over one puppy proof room ever since they came home. I had to deal with the chaos of stepped-on poop and random pees and destruction of the barriers (I had to seal off some areas of the room I didn't think I'd have a problem, like under the large furniture where they decided to poop...). Contrary to everything I used to believe as a dog trainer, they did not unlearn where to do their business and, given some freedom in the house, will almost never miss the designated area. They sleep all night (in my bed!) with no accidents, are learning how to show me they want to go out (sometimes they rather pee on the outside spot). They are now almost 5 months old (2 of then with me), one of them is completely blind, reactive and a heavy chewer and we have been managing just fine.

Maybe it's all a matter of perspective. I don't mind them chewing on stuff I forgot to put in a safe spot and I don't mind (much) cleaning their mess on that one room because I didn't have money for buying two crates - I have absolutely nothing against crating, it just wasn't an option for me. I play a lot with them before leaving for college and I leave plenty of water, regular toys and those balls filled with treats so they can play. I make sure we have the nicest time when I come home, doing tricks, obedience training and general play.

What I mean to say is: there is no way we, normal people, are gonna live in that pink world where we get to see our puppies in the middle of the day on a regular basis. She havs you and you are a nice human who worries about her enough to come and ask stuff about her well being, a human who leaves for work everyday so she has nice food and a healthy life. 

TLDR, I'd go with free(ish?) roam, but the crate should be ok at 9 months as long as she exercises before and after. In any case, work it up little by little, understand what you're getting yourself into, take deep breaths and remember you're gonna be fine."
