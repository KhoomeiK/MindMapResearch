BipolarReddit,fc6si3t,t3_egetff,1577488359.0,"This happens to me a lot. My mom constantly tells me â€œyou need to learn how to get over things fasterâ€ and that Iâ€™m just dramatic for â€œsulking.â€ They donâ€™t understand that I canâ€™t really just get over it. My brain just doesnâ€™t let me, it just feels like when one thing makes me really upset I just spiral downwards."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fbz3ayz,t1_fbz2ruz,1577233794.0,"> If the losses of the Antarctic Peninsula and parts of West Antarctica continue to increase at the same rate theyâ€™ve been increasing for the last two decades, the losses will catch up with the long-term gain in East Antarctica in 20 or 30 years -- I donâ€™t think there will be enough snowfall increase to offset these losses.

While yes Antarctica is growing, if things continue the way they are itâ€™s going to get worse. Also, this doesnâ€™t account for the ice caps melting in the arctic which have been the ones that most people refer to since these are geographically closer to the more developed countries. The Arctic isnâ€™t replenishing itâ€™s losses so just because Antarctica is doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not still a problem."
