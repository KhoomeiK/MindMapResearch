ElizabethWarren,ff24p5l,t1_ff2490w,1579493731.0,"It's true that any plan will end up being less comprehensive than us starry-eyed dreamers hope, but I have a lot more faith in Warren getting something useful done than Sanders. Warren has proven she knows how to make things happen. Sanders has passed almost no legislation in his 30 years in Congress."
LosAngeles,ff2468r,t1_ff220lk,1579493319.0,"Even a no-kill shelter will occasionally have to euthanize pets that are beyond repair, and I would assume that both physical and psychological factors would come into play in that decision. Though certainly some of these dangerous dogs are recoverable, given enough time, kindness and knowledge, if there is someone willing to provide it."

ElizabethWarren,ff1ypfy,t1_ff0yzmi,1579489249.0,"Within a couple of days, she presented an entire plan that didn't raise taxes that had been vetted by multiple economy experts. While Bernie still hasn't presented a plan that would actually work with the system of government we have in place. So: no."
ElizabethWarren,ff1xwro,t3_er12kc,1579488700.0,"A progressive candidate would be great, if they didn't have dozens of scandal-worthy revelations waiting to be exposed. Sanders appears to have quite a few untold stories from his past, and Warren seems to have very few exploitable issues that haven't already been beaten to death."

aww,ff1x2g3,t1_ff1wlhg,1579488146.0,"The meet-and-greets would certainly be uncomfortable for most cats. I've never been to one of them, but I've always assumed that cats that are taken to conventions are more extroverted than your average cat. Because your average cat would be hiding or fighting in an environment like that."
