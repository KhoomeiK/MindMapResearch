mycology,ffja7o1,t1_ffj8lai,1579994048.0,"It really depends on the type of fungi you go for. Some of them, like the Lion's Mane, are very resistant to contamination. Others can be a bit more finicky. Generally, I would suggest growing separate types in separate containers, but there are a number of solutions for fruiting conditions. There are autoclavable bags which can be used for inoculation, and cut on the sides when they are ready to fruit, I've seen 5 gallon buckets used for fruiting, shotgun fruiting chambers using perlite, etc. If you already have the ability to control and maintain the temperature and humidity of the environment, you're ahead of the game. I've even seen someone who developed a method that uses a closed environment to reduce the possibility of contamination.

As for specific environment, most fungi I'm familiar with require fairly high humidity levels, but differ in temperature requirements for both colonization *and* fruiting. The biochemical signals to start fruiting are typically different for each strain (many of them are seasonally dependent in the wild) and so their colonization requirements will also be different. There are a wealth of teks out there for growing psychedelic mushrooms, and the specifics to the strains may not be of use to you, but the *methods* they use to get there are generally effective as they are still saprophytes, and most of them drill pretty far down into scientific methods to achieve the end result. Different substrates are needed for different strains, and some require actual logs, some are fine fruiting from grain spawn, others will grow on cardboard or straw."
mycology,ffj73en,t1_ffj5un6,1579992038.0,"If you go the route of making your own agar plates, malt extract is a fairly effective wide-range nutrient, and you can really use any kind of agar you can get your hands on-even the stuff in the little packets for food. Inoculating loops can be overly expensive, but you can make your own with a roll of nichrome wire and an exacto handle with replaceable blades. Most plastic petri dishes come in a sterile bag, but I'm planning to upgrade to autoclavable borosilicate glass because I don't like the waste. You can make your own SAB (still air box) for the purposes of working in a sterile environment out of a large, clear storage container simply by cutting holes in the side that allow your hands to work inside the space. If you go that route (I highly recommend it, as working under sterile conditions from the culture phase *really* cuts down on contamination) a moist towel under the SAB can go a long way towards making a fairly effective seal around the edges.

I chewed on them until they admitted she had been singled out for being brown, while they had grabbed me from the line to expedite my process. They were tripping over themselves to let me skip the line, but wanted my wife to submit to questioning. I went the whole nine yards. Management, accusations of racism, all of it.

She knows that if she tries to challenge an authority figure, that no matter how right she is, she will still be wrong because she's a *Hispanic woman.* That's two marks against her.

relationship_advice,ff7ddji,t3_es2a8s,1579646951.0,"For seniors in high school, the teenage hormones might make this a bit difficult, but I'd suggest just letting him know that you have something you want to talk about that's bothering you. Relationships are built on communication and trust. A huge part of that is being able to honestly talk with one another about things that are genuinely bothering you. That extends pretty much to every ~~fact~~ facet of your life together. Without communication, you can't build trust, and without trust, you don't have a relationship. I'm extremely lucky, and I have a wife that I can talk to about *anything*. She has the same with me. If there is ever something that is bothering either of us, we both know it is incumbent on each of us to bring it up to the other. If you hold onto it, it's going to fester, and then you will eventually start to resent that person. Relationships take a *lot* of work, and if both of you aren't invested in maintaining it, then there are going to be some pretty significant problems. My wife and I have been married for several years, and I absolutely adore her, but there are some things that she does that drives me a little crazy. Not that ""oh, it's so cute because she's insane"" crazy, but more like things that she gets stuck on, or hung up on. Sometimes I need to tell her that she's being an ass. Not in a mean way, but just to let her know that she needs to tone it down a bit. She does the exact same for me, and we've gotten really good at checking one another when the worst of our personalities start getting the best of us. Hell, sometimes we even have to let it go and come back to it after 10 minutes, an hour, or even a day. We *always* come back to it, though. My point is that the best way to do it is to be direct. Not mean, but straightforward. Trying to imply stuff doesn't work. If you have a problem, you *have* to talk about it. If you really care about the relationship, it's important to address the problems that *you* have with what's going on. If you don't, then he won't know you're having an issue. On that same token, though, he needs to be just as willing to talk about these things. I know it can be tough, but I cannot stress enough how incredibly important it is to simply be able to talk openly and honestly about little problems -- If you can't talk about the little things, then you will ***never*** be able to discuss the important things.

Since you're both in HS, along with being in your senior years, keep in mind that you're *both* going through some really big events personally.

mildlyinteresting,fcttzac,t1_fctntk7,1577959415.0,"The *only* reason it upsets people is because several decades ago, when a group of scientists realized that it *could* be done, they spliced (like the guy who failed at explaining what transgenetic modification was briefly explaining) a luminescent gene from, I believe, either algae, jellyfish, or fireflies (it's been a while since I had the lecture) into plants. The result was a regular plant that happens to glow in the dark. Activists went fucking insane, because plants that glow *must* be evil. The goal was actually to engineer plants that can be easily harvested at night. The added gene would have had zero consequences for any subsequent consumers. The practice was then publicly bashed into oblivion for about 3 or 4 decades, because people didn't like the idea of ""playing god.""

If memory serves me correctly, this particular line of modification comes from the utilization of horizontal gene transfer via bacterial plasmids. Essentially they came up with a way to use bacterial tools to add certain genes into plants in order to change their phenotype (outward physical expression of genetics). Right now, we are using more robust tools that can do even more than plasmids in the form of CRISPR Cas-9. It's more or less part of a bacterial immune system which, instead of implanting a whole gene, gives us the ability to implement single nucleotide changes.

Worth noting is that while utilizing HGT is frowned on in creating food crops, it hasn't stopped us from using it for other things, like producing medications like insulin, or antibiotics. The way we do that, is we take a model bacteria, like E.coli, and we hijack it's DNA with a plasmid to force it to produce the molecule that we want to harvest. Previously, we procured insulin either from cadavers or animals, but that wound up being obviously problematic. This process is used to produce a very wide range of medicines, industrial products, and many, many other things which would be otherwise difficult to produce or use. In the case of insulin, we get the bacteria to produce *human* insulin. It's a really interesting field of science, and has a whole world of applications.

It would be really nice if we could use these methods in agriculture, but people are scared of media buzzwords, so we probably won't be ending world hunger anytime soon. However, you don't see these ""woke"" people protesting the use of insulin to save the lives of diabetics, so maybe they just like to be told what to believe in by the television, or an orange turnip wearing a suit topped by the top part of a tumbleweed."
