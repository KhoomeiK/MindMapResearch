Fitness,ffh01gd,t1_ffg87eo,1579919484.0,"I started out around 160# nine years ago. When I started college I started working out and eating more, quickly shot up to 180. I stayed in the 160-180 range for a few years until a bad breakup in 2015.  
That's when I started taking this seriously, not taking breaks during the summer, counting everything I eat.  
I'm not strong at all, not for someone who's been working out as long as me and I'm a bit ashamed of that.  
I usually bulk conservatively, since I have to eat a lot more than what I'd feel like. But I bulk for 5-6 months at a time, with short cuts in between."

I feel like I'm lagging of my legs a lot. Been overestimating how much weight I can take on a high volume program. I'll probably take off a few dozen pounds off my squat, see where that'll lead me.

So, what do I need? I feel like my upper pecs, triceps and legs are lagging behind, but apart from that?"

politics,ffe6txa,t1_ffdzx0x,1579838250.0,"What part of the ideology do you agree with? Why do you agree with it? What experience has led you to agree with it?  
Do you feel like the whole democratic party would misrepresent race issues? When/how have they done that already? What do you think of victims of racial inequality and their own experiences?

As per your above comment, what kind of appeal to emotion? What statistics would you like to bring and how would you place them in their context? Are you able to look past the simple numbers and understand what made those numbers?

Because all I get from your recent comments is ""I derive an identity from this political party and its current leader so my choices are unreasonably influenced by such an identity"". I'm paraphrasing, of course. It's totally normal, by the by.

You seem to understand the importance of rationality and reason. I respect that. But do you understand why those are important? Or have you simply learned that some people put them above everything else when making decisions? Would you believe me if I told you despite all that, you're still a little ball of flesh that feels and as such, can't take purely rational decisions. 
Maybe you're purely utilitarian, though. That's one way to approach problems. What led you there?

I'm a white male too. I've never been accused of racism because of it. I've sometimes said insensitive stuff which I later learned how insensitive it was. I've used that to grow as a person and to understand how the world differs from my little own experience. Some people have it harder than others. Skin color is one big reason why. Wouldn't you agree that, being part of a group that has historically had it better would tend to give white males, on average,  some steps ahead? Or that some people just don't have it as cozy as others, just because they don't happend to be born with the right genitals?

So... you need to be a pedophile with a camera or somebody who's into that. Please report postings of that link to mods/admins in the future; I've already done so in this case. It's a CSS thing, and a pretty well-known one at that. Kinda like how a few circlejerks change usernames to reflect a theme, except mirroring other subs cosmetically while the links direct to kiddie porn assuming you're using some tool (it's like TOR, I think, but I don't really pay attention to the shady side of the net - if you're tech savvy I'd guess you've heard of it). So this sub moves around whenever it gets deleted, and it's up to people reporting it and the users maliciously linking to it to get the admins' attention. I assume they report it to authorities, but these subs keep popping up. I miss the days when at least you knew [r/creepshots](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepshots/) would be the disgusting borderline sub instead of having to be wary of every sub you get linked to. Also, most of the links there will attempt to install some nasty viruses on your computer if you don't have the requisite tool. Unless you're using VirtualBox or have a trustworthy firewall I'd recommend a virus scan."
