About half the customers would actually ask their kids which they wanted, and some would tell me at the window that they appreciated the effort, but the other half would get inexplicably pissed off about it."

AskReddit,fdp54qm,t1_fdp0fhm,1578620219.0,"Same here, though I’m a left-leaning registered libertarian. None of the economic plans look at all appealing, so I’m mostly going off of social and foreign policy. If it’s Gabbard, Buttigieg, Bernie, or maybe even Yang, then I’ll probably vote democratic. If it’s Biden then there’s no way I’m voting Dem."
