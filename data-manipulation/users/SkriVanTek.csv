IdiotsInCars,fdafczd,t1_fd6lkcg,1578245462.0,the increased safety from diesel has nothing to do with the diesel engine itself. diesel has much lower vapor pressure than gasoline meaning that it produces less fumes over an open container. this is the reason why it's safer
IdiotsInCars,fdaf172,t1_fd6g66n,1578245336.0,not true. diesel fumes burn easy. it's the low vapor pressure that makes diesel safer than gasoline meaning it creates less fumes over an open container.
IdiotsInCars,fdadv3a,t1_fd70nr2,1578244977.0,the flame is NOT the problem. it's the spark that ignites the lighter that's dangerous. it is obviously hot enough to ignite a mixture of air and fuel fumes.

the funkytown people want their victim to suffer extreme pain, but ultimately therefore the victim has to be alive. they even gave their victim meth to keep it from becoming unconscious. sure in the end theykill their victims but that's not what its about for them.

gallagher gets off from the act of killing it self. he's the guy that drives a knive slowly in your hart and look you in the eyes to see you die. he's not really interested in making you suffer physical pain. he wants to see the angst in your face.
