I'll often feel very unenergized and cranky and I *know* I need to eat but I just don't feel hungry. Then when I do eat I get nauseous because eating when not hungry at all is just not pleasant.

But yes, it is easy to stay slim. I still often wish for a normal appetite because meals are an almost daily struggle."

fatlogic,fcx8vh8,t1_fcx8ggv,1578055800.0,"Yeah I stopped seeing her for many reasons, this incident being one of them. I'm just super anxious especially around doctors and haven't tried again because I don't want another ""lecture"", even though she was very gentle about it. I think I'll discuss this with my new doctor now, thanks for the encouragement."
fatlogic,fcx8edk,t1_fcvxw1w,1578055309.0,"I tried this but my doctor said it wasn't healthy to avoid knowing my weight and that it's an important step in recovery to be able to look at it :( 

She was very nice about it though and sat down with me and comforted me before telling me the number. I haven't tried to avoid it since even with other doctors but I always hate it so much. I'm not sure I'll ever be happy with my ""healthy"" weight."

(Btw there exist apps to measure the decibels of your surroundings.) I just recommend reading up on this online, there are a lot of informational and interesting articles on the topic."
