JordanPeterson,ffbg1yl,t1_ffaqcuo,1579763698.0,"He's definitely doing some gatekeeping. But he isn't doing what you are saying. When we take his answer from your quote and mine   


\>I'm not suggesting in the least, and have NEVER suggested that there's no domain for social action, I'm suggesting that people who don't have their own houses in order should be very careful before they go about reorganizing the world. 

&#x200B;

\> I think that generally, people have things that are more within their personal purview that are more difficult to deal with and that they're avoiding and the way they avoid them is by adopting pseudo-moralistic stances on large-scale social issues so that they look good to their friends and neighbors.   


He's definitely pointing out that people avoid their own issues by latching on to other issues. They do that. Virtue signaling is real and very pernicious. With visible effects. 

  


There is gatekeeping but it's not a sweeping argument against collective environmental action. The first part cancels that out so long as you are serious and have your shit together. 

The second part that you point out makes it gatekeeping. I'm ok with that. I've said before here that I am ok with Greta as an example and I am glad she has inspired my oldest daughter. Whether I agree with her 100%, Greta has a good support team and has all of her gear in one sack.  

And the question isn't should you care about the climate, or should you participate collectively. It's should your collective responsibility override your individual responsibility? 

It's like asking a link, what's more important, you or the chain? You can't be a good link if you are weak, and he isn't saying don't be part of the chain. Be strong first and then do whatever you want.   


If we look at it that way it's not a bad thing to remind the links they need to be strong.  It's actually very very necessary."

JordanPeterson,ff96az3,t1_ff93clg,1579705862.0,"No. He does not. There's nothing pernicious about taking responsibility for yourself. And I would be interested to see an  example of a wrong Peterson has caused.

And I've seen other videos where he explicitly says that there's nothing wrong with collective action.

Your interpretation of the video does not seem sound, when he says **""I'm not suggesting in the least, and have NEVER suggested that there's no domain for social action, I'm suggesting that people who don't have their own houses in order should be very careful before they go about reorganizing the world.""**

That that means he's not suggesting in the least, and he has NEVER suggested that there's no domain for social action. He's saying you need to not be a loser with nothing to offer in order to lead large movements. If you are going to rewire our entire society, you had better know what you are doing. That seems unfair or pernicious to you? Action is great. Thought is great too. 

The quote above certainly contradicts what you are saying he said and it shows that the Churchill example is bunk as well. Churchill's autobiography shows it. 

And if you insist that Peterson's politics have had visible negative effects like Hate crimes, or physical violence, wars, loss of planetary battle stations and stuff like that, then name it. 

It's not rose tinted glasses. There is plenty to disagree with JBP about. But we have to argue with what he actually said, not some strawman bullshit mischaracterization."
JordanPeterson,ff90t1t,t1_ff904ya,1579701963.0,"I don't believe that about Peterson for a minute. His desire to help people is genuine. I think he does believe that if you don't train up before you attempt to retool the entirety of western civilization, that you'll fail, spectacularly and that you are wasting your time. And for those folks he probably doesn't have a lot of respect. But his advice is genuine."
JordanPeterson,ff8spdg,t1_ff8o4xf,1579694610.0,"Now that would depend on how you see gatekeeping. There's a massive difference between asking someone their opinion on whether you should do X, or whether you are allowed to do X.   


Peterson is saying, you would be better off doing Y and then doing X. If you try without being prepared, you'll fail, and your goals won't be met and you'll be sorry you wasted your time. Follow my advice, and you'll be fulfilled and prepared to attempt whatever you want.

Churchill was actively prohibited from fulfilling his plans at a number of points. He either took it and carried on, which what you are saying, and that was fine, or he beat his opposition and made them eat crow. Like Boris Johnson did recently.  Either way works.

He means get motivated, organized and whatever you do, do it well, accept responsibilities, the more the better. The climate can certainly be included in that. If you want to be a Petersonian climate activist let's say, then be organized, effective, be a leader in your community, know your arguments, tell yourself and other people the absolute truth, do not compel, but lead by example, personally.

The left cancel each other and are happy to call anyone who disagrees with them a right wing hack etc. Constantine Kisin is an example. He's a liberal comedian, but has been labeled alt-right, By Kate Smurthwaite because of his free speech stances. I was like Kate? What? You have to be kidding. Speaking of free speech...

Dude claims The left is against free speech. That if you disagree you lose the right to speak, that you must be either evil or stupid.

Strangely and bizarrely arguable as well. Free speech is now considered a right wing dogwhistle. I've seen enough people call Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson, or Joe Rogan Stupid evil Nazis, to think that maybe the Dude might have a point. Shapiro isn't right about alot of things, but he's not stupid, or a Nazi. Peterson is brilliant but doesn't sell his ideas so well sometimes, and Joe Rogan is about freedom of expression but he's a left wing as fuck. But I've seen the left mob Rogan because he's an Alt-right gateway. That's some bullshit.

Dude said the left is growing somewhat anti-democratic and Brexit is a good example.

I personally thought that Parliament all deserved to lose their jobs. How many votes do you need to have?

Dude said that the left is hypocritical, e.g. Patriarchy is bad, but Iran is ok, because the left can't abide anti-islamism.  Certainly arguable

Dude says the left is bizarrely critical of the west to a point of unreality. The west is unbelievably racist and sexist to the point of being unlivable, without any positive commentary to balance the argument.

The left is bizarrely anti-capitalist, but devoted to criticizing the state of the world without being able to look at the benefits of modernity or the positive statistics about our global situation.

These are good points and places to begin a constructive critique frankly."
