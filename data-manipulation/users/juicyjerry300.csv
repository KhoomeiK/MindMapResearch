No one is denying that there are pitbull attacks but that trash ass website is exactly what I said in my above comment.  Also, pitbulls aren’t more aggressive than other dogs, they are just stronger, therefore an attack by a pitbull is much more likely to be reported. Also also, many of the people that own pitbulls are attracted to them because they want a big mean dog which leads to it being untrained and raised poorly, which further increases attacks.
