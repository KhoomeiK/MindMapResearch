TwoXChromosomes,ff4zl27,t1_ff4e0nr,1579576279.0,"You also have to consider the difference between a privately owned school and a corporate entity. The corporate one has MUCH higher operation costs due to paying the higher ups.

Also, a research based curiculum costs to either buy the rights to, or develope and up keep.  As well as the fact that, have you ever seen how much preschool furnature and toys cost? You can buy a simple CD player for 3x as much as you could at your local store, but many schools require individual sights to buy only from approved places due to liability issues and recall notices. 

Additionally, most schools cost less the older the child gets due to ratios increasing. 1 fully stocked  classroom with 1 teacher and 5 infants cost more than 1 fully stocked classroom with 1 teacher and 14 5 year olds (my states basic state ratio) because you have 5 families paying for the upkeep of that classroom as aposed to 14 families.
