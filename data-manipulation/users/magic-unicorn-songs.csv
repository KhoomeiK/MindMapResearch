weightlossdiets,ff47si4,t3_erfg7q,1579557405.0,"You didn’t gain all that fat in 2 weeks so don’t expect to lose it so fast! Relax and don’t be so hard on yourself, but also don’t be pathetic about it. It’s hard. It takes commitment. And it’s worth it. If you want to be slim then stick with it. If you want (all the reasons you started this process in the first place) to remain then give up. 

Tough love my man. 

Really though, don’t be too hard on yourself. You don’t need to work out 6 days a week. And you don’t need to starve either. Walking 250 calories and being 250 calories below your TDEE creates a net deficit of 500 calories which is plenty. It’s also more sustainable than binge dieting. 

I believe in you."
