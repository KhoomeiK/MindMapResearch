cursedimages,fevhhyu,t1_feu2q9a,1579397517.0,"The pygmy, if enraged actually can't leave the mother, but grows into a twisted beanstalk like creature. It's skin and muscle twisting around it self to allow its growth upwards that slightly extend its reach beyond the behemoth that once protected it. It feeds off the corpse of its mother, directly embedding itself into her the roles now reversed. It stays short ranged and acts like a twisted plant, lashing out in swathes at attackers, hoping to keep the mothers corpse safe and to its self. Could also break through the floor like The Cursed Greatwood.

Alternatively in a way like the Asylum Demon, it breaks the floor if you return. The initial fight can only have the pygmy knocked out but, nonetheless will crawl on top of the behemoth and weep. On return the floor is cracked from the sustained weight and will break on entering.  The pygmy will recognize you and angered by you and your interrupting of its mourning it will grow enraged. Everything else is the same essentially. Maybe drop section if the remaining floor from time to time or as it enters a new phase."
AskReddit,fevdfyq,t3_eqies2,1579396118.0,"Was driving late one night like close to midnight and heard a plane passing overhead. Looked above me at the night sky and saw it pretty close, likely landing at the airport near town. It was close enough that I saw a couple details on the fuselage and such. Yet as it continued yo make sounds it didn't move. Like I heard the sound but it was one solid tone and it looked like it floated in the air which threw me off cause there was clouds (or smoke/steam from the factories/reactor) passing by it. It was weird as hell and almost made me drive into oncoming traffic."

AskReddit,fcxyaem,t3_ejdlbw,1578072121.0,"About 1 week. She cheated on my best friend more than once, never responded to any messages I sent her and she started to get nasty to her other friends that I was also friends with. Sucks because she was my oldest friend after I moved here.

Its that or within a week I lost my second oldest friend  later that same year I think. He broke up with someone I sort of knew but, wasn't the best of friends with. However, they were together for 2 years and he texted her that they were done and it wasn't the first time he did that either. She tried to starve herself to death until I started yelling at her to eat at lunch because being nice wasn't working. Eventually she got better and we became great friends, she said I was like a brother to her, which is still the nicest thing someone has ever said to me to this day. He got with a freshman and still is, I said what he was doing was being a pedophile by legal standards. He got mad and threatened to beat me up and I called his bluff time and again. He was always an asshole that just showed me how much of one."

aaaaaaacccccccce,fcregqz,t1_fcqwrn2,1577900733.0,"Go with what makes the most logical sense to you. I tried to gather ""evidence"" and it led to me being asexual as the most logical conclusion. I was indifferent to the idea of sex but, when put practically I have a dislike for the thought of it. So because I don't like it and/or want sex, I'm asexual. There's flexibility to be had and I'm not well versed enough to explain but, I'd suggest some research. Over several months it all lead me to asexual biromantic, mainly by way of indifference lol.

Essentially, find what makes sense to you and if its what makes you happy, awesome possum. Don't feel pressured to label or not to label based on those around you. Also if you have questions ask around this sub, everyone here is crazy nice and way smarter about this stuff than I probably am lol."

Talking about sexuality is fine as long as the group is fine with it, no reason to make someone  uncomfortable. The more comfortable people are about sexuality the better, so no one feels like an outcast, or that something is wrong with them for being that way. You should talk about it because it's possible to not get it dead on the first time, but talking about it can help."
