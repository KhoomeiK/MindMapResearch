trees,fecdj69,t3_eob8lm,1578971358.0,"Oh man!!! What a sucky way to find something out like that. 


When I was, I don’t know, 9 maybe? My mom bought 2 boxes of the Captain Crunch Coco donuts cereal and I ate 2 bowls when she brought it home. 
About not even 10 minutes later my arms and legs get red and rashy (a lot like your pictures) and my face got tingly. 

Quick trip to children’s hospital to find out I’m allergic to a specific kind of coco powder... Mom threw out both boxes. 

Fun stuff!"

You’re not giving any credit to those who work endlessly to try and get the info of climate change out the those who are ignorant to it? What about Greta Thunberg? And all the younger generations she’s inspiring? Or the other, good people, who are in office pushing for serious climate change action? 

You’re so quick to say “Welp, were screwed” instead of looking around you at those who are working endlessly to do something, anything to try and help."
wholesomegifs,fdkwxo7,t1_fdkrbvv,1578512857.0,"Maybe not back to “normal” right away. But this is nature. When a volcano erupts, it destroys all life that the lava and ash touches. But over time, beautiful and fresh life is born from the ash. The seeds that survived will have the best soil to grow in because that’s what the fires did. 

It may take a long time, but the wildlife will come back tenfold. That’s the best part about Mother Nature."

Also, if you asked your mom not to say anything till you feel comfortable telling him yourself, I’m sure she’ll understand. 


You’ve gotta remember you’re parents have been around for a while so they know a thing or two."
gaming,fdkorbt,t1_fdkny68,1578508003.0,"Hey! I’m 25 and bisexual. I came out to my parents and friends when I was 18. My mom said “Oh, I know”. And I was afraid to tell my dad for a little while but, when I did he said that the only thing that’s bothering him is that he has to worry about guys AND girls breaking my heart. 

If there’s one thing I’ve learned in the very short amount of time I’ve been an adult, it’s that just be yourself. Whoever you want to be. This life is hard enough, man. Be happy by being yourself. And if people around (including parents and other family) judge you for it, then they weren’t meant to be apart of your life. There are so many people out in this world that will love you the way you are and will be the family you NEED. Don’t let abusiveness pass just because they’re “family”."

Damnthatsinteresting,fcs8015,t1_fcr8xvo,1577912728.0,"You’re correct! Each blue lobster (that has been documented) is usually put somewhere to live out its life for research purposes. 

In this case, I’m pretty sure this is [the same](https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2019/06/14/restaurant-blue-lobster-donates-aquarium/) lobster, who did not get eaten! But instead is now living out the rest of his life at an aquarium."
Unexpected,fcktmhk,t1_fcke5jm,1577732923.0,"I mean, not necessarily, what was that video a while ago about the construction worker unclogging a highway drain to get rid of the flood taking up a 5 lane highway? Ah, [here it is](https://youtu.be/vJnAowdUyK4). Don’t get me wrong. Not as deep in the slightest, buuut I have no doubt the guy probably just had to move some debris out of the way in order for the water to be able to drain. Once he felt the water moving I’m sure he just high-tailed it on up the latter."
