WingsOfFire,ff8s877,t3_es59ba,1579694054.0,Can you draw my oc Vortex? She is a sea/night hybrid with dark purple-almost black scales. Her head is a NightWing shape with SeaWing GID scales. Her eyes are a gray-green color. Her wings are black with powder blue star scales and a spiral pattern on the edge. Her talons are webbed and the webs are silver. She wears an aquamarine pendant earring in one of her ears and an armband made out of pure obsidian. Her wings are a bit on the large side but other than that she is pretty small.
