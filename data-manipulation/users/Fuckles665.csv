AskReddit,fd37ye6,t1_fd351ka,1578155612.0,"You’re wrong though. People have become better drivers because the technology has made it easier. The old metric for setting speed limits was how quickly one could break over a certain distance. Now we can break much quicker at faster speeds. Not only breaks, but invocations in suspension and drive trains have seen tremendous improvement as well. My car is awd and sticks to the road and handles like nothing I’ve ever experienced. Impaired driving is way down compared to twenty or thirty years ago. And not to mention where I live the fastest you can drive on the highway is 62 miles per hour or 100 kilometres per hour which is just excruciatingly slow. But I mean go ahead a “hur dur I like to go slow so everyone should go slow” all you like."
AskReddit,fd30pbe,t1_fd2vqew,1578153649.0,"The left lane is meant to have you go faster than the other car and get ahead of them as quickly and safely as possible (barring exceptions like turn offs and merging lanes where I will ride the left lane to avoid having to interact with merging drivers). I’m Canadian. So our highways are usually set at 100km/h, I’ll pass at 120 (and usually drive around 120 if conditions are ideal) so that I get around the other drivers quickly and safely. If I have to slow down because someone is taking their time in the left lane I risk having to jam my brakes and get back behind the car I was trying to pass if the passing section goes away (not all of the highways where I live are 4 lane’s continuously and often they are three lanes where opposing sides switch who gets the passing lane). If you’re doing 105 to pass someone going 100 you’ll Nearly make it in time and I’ll be stuck waiting until the next passing lane, where I’ll then have to pass you both. Realistically our speed limits are too low and were set in the 70’s when break technology was shit. We need higher speed limits on our roads."

AskReddit,fffituh,t3_etcig5,1579884891.0,"My parents have had huge fights as long as I can remember. It really fucked up how I viewed relationships. As a kid I would pray for them to get a divorce (they never did). As I got older I learned that if I eventually came up and yelled at them louder with more curse words, that they would shut the fuck up. I never once beloved they were in love. Once I got older and both my sister and I moved out, they get along a lot better. But I saw them kiss the other day (Iâ€™m now 25) and was so weirded out. My mother had undiagnosed PTSD for the first 20 years of my life and my dad drank to cope. As a teenager I had no idea how to talk to girls, and got very nice-guy esque. I developed one hell of a temper, which took a lot of self work to get in check. It took me 6 years to get a 4 year degree because once I was out of the house and away from my mothers extremely controlling personality I used excessive alcohol abuse to cope.  I got that under control. But Being drunk for 6 years straight meant I did a lot of things Iâ€™m not proud of and wish I could take back. Iâ€™ve since cleaned my act up and am in a healthy relationship with the most amazing woman (not one who uses me for self validation or pot). Hurt people hurt people. Youâ€™re not responsible for being hurt, but healing and moving on from that is your responsibility. If not, youâ€™ll just continue the cycle. The worst part was that to everyone I knew, my mom was the sweetest most thoughtful person, until they left. Then her true form (giant cunt) came out. Sheâ€™s been in therapy for the last few years and is getting better. But she has 20 years of abuse to make up for and canâ€™t understand why constantly just blaming PTSD isnâ€™t enough for me to forgive her. She still has a lot of the same habits. Even my girlfriend noticed all her small slights and jabs that she makes in a daily basis. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever forgive her. But Iâ€™m trying to before she dies. Pro tip, apologies that donâ€™t follow a change in behaviour, are empty and not worth the air the are carried on. She still needs to realize that."

AskMen,fdjjygw,t1_fditow6,1578474354.0,"Itâ€™s the same as fat girls getting upset that a man says heâ€™s not attracted to fat girls. However being short is worse, as you can loose weight. You canâ€™t gain height. For some reason outright stating you arenâ€™t interested in fat women is met with people calling you an asshole, where as no one bats an eye when a girl says she wonâ€™t date under 6 ft.

When I had long hair (like past my shoulders) I used to think I looked like and artist and didnâ€™t need to develop my body at all. I was never super fat, but it feels like once you shave your head, you take away all the bullshit that you used to focus on when you had hair away. And you can get a better look at yourself if you know what I mean. Without constantly worrying about how my hair looked I was able to concentrate on the other parts of my appearance I had neglected until that point. Because when your hairs falling out. Itâ€™s on your mind constantly (weather it be how you think you look, or how you think others think you look). I also dress a lot better now."

So hopefully you have a nice jaw line or can grow a beard. Itâ€™s just hair man. Look baldness in the face and say â€œfuck you, Iâ€™m going out my wayâ€ like I did. Anything is better than those pathetic hair cuts where you try to hide it. Long hair on a blading guy just looks sickly and sad (can confirm, grew my hair out for two years as a last hurrah before it receded too much) once the widows peaks go beyond a certain point, it looks really bad."
AskReddit,fd37ye6,t1_fd351ka,1578155612.0,"Youâ€™re wrong though. People have become better drivers because the technology has made it easier. The old metric for setting speed limits was how quickly one could break over a certain distance. Now we can break much quicker at faster speeds. Not only breaks, but invocations in suspension and drive trains have seen tremendous improvement as well. My car is awd and sticks to the road and handles like nothing Iâ€™ve ever experienced. Impaired driving is way down compared to twenty or thirty years ago. And not to mention where I live the fastest you can drive on the highway is 62 miles per hour or 100 kilometres per hour which is just excruciatingly slow. But I mean go ahead a â€œhur dur I like to go slow so everyone should go slowâ€ all you like."
AskReddit,fd30pbe,t1_fd2vqew,1578153649.0,"The left lane is meant to have you go faster than the other car and get ahead of them as quickly and safely as possible (barring exceptions like turn offs and merging lanes where I will ride the left lane to avoid having to interact with merging drivers). Iâ€™m Canadian. So our highways are usually set at 100km/h, Iâ€™ll pass at 120 (and usually drive around 120 if conditions are ideal) so that I get around the other drivers quickly and safely. If I have to slow down because someone is taking their time in the left lane I risk having to jam my brakes and get back behind the car I was trying to pass if the passing section goes away (not all of the highways where I live are 4 laneâ€™s continuously and often they are three lanes where opposing sides switch who gets the passing lane). If youâ€™re doing 105 to pass someone going 100 youâ€™ll Nearly make it in time and Iâ€™ll be stuck waiting until the next passing lane, where Iâ€™ll then have to pass you both. Realistically our speed limits are too low and were set in the 70â€™s when break technology was shit. We need higher speed limits on our roads."

Itâ€™s like their PokÃ©mon are slowly turning into the animal races in elder scrolls. The bunny is a kasheek with long ears and no tail and inteleon is just an argonian.

Iâ€™d like Inteleon a lot better if it didnâ€™t have that stupid way-too-human pose and was on all fours as a skinny lizard type creature. If Pokemon start to look and act human, it beings to feel a little like slavery instead of pet and master to me."
