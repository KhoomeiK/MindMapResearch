aww,fffctmo,t1_fff3i3g,1579881138.0,"That's how my girlfriend's cats were with me at first. But once I basically acted like I didn't care about them, that's when they slowly opened up to me. Now the boy cat in particular can't get enough of my affection."
rush,ffe3eot,t3_et176h,1579835665.0,"Hey there! Music teacher and fellow Rush fan here: this is so wholesome and I loved every second of it. I'm so happy to see young musicians continuing the traditions of rock, especially Rush of all bands. Since you mentioned wanting some notes, here are my thoughts:

**Things I liked:**

\- The ending note was solid and together- great job!

\- Every's passion was visible in their playing.

\- This is clearly not a half baked performance- you guys must have put in a lot of work (*individually and as a band*) and it shows.

\- When things don't go as planned (*dropping sticks, for example*), recovery time is quick. Definitely can save you and get you through those ""make or break"" moments.

\- The band's collective understanding of the song is obvious in the performance. That is something that's not always given credit- well done.

\- The drums had several fills that locked in very well and with good tempo control.

**Things that I think need work:**

\- I think the second guitar is unnecessary for a song like this- instead the guitar player stage left should play keyboards. As I look closer at the video, this looks like possibly a high school jazz band concert, so I understand if setting up a keyboard would have been tricky (*I don't see a piano*). But it goes to show how surprisingly important the key parts are to this tune! (*Especially the intro and after the guitar solo, but I'm sure keys could work throughout the whole thing*)

\- The guitar player stage left was facing away from the audience. It's something you don't always notice when you're focused on performing, but it's good to keep that in mind- face the instrument to the audience. (*However, feel free to turn and communicate with the band when necessary-* ***that*** *I did notice you guys do and that's good too.*)

Overall, you guys did a **great** job! As you progress and gain more experience, all of the basic tenets of music and performing will come into place and you'll be killing it. Keep working hard and doing what you're doing- the world needs more of this."

lightsabers,ffdwgq5,t1_ffdcka3,1579830633.0,"That would be about $90 in today's economy. How much is it to go there today?  


EDIT: Google search showed me it can be as low as $97, so it's statistically not that bad."
StarWars,ff4zbxd,t1_ff4hqoc,1579576093.0,Sam is so knowledgeable about star wars.... like it's scary how much he knows lol. I went down a rabbit hole the other day watching videos of him discussing SW with people- he really is a jedi master lol

OculusQuest,feitfdi,t3_ep8286,1579146743.0,GENERAL KENOBI!!! Lol I wonder if that would work for both the Quest and the game Vader Immortal III with the Maul double saber
lightsabers,fedvdxm,t1_fedt540,1579020700.0,"Do they come with blades or just the hilt? Very cool collection man, I want the Obi Wan ep 1 so bad. It's my favorite saber of all time."

lightsabers,fdxilwg,t1_fdx3uok,1578769052.0,You built this at Disney? The parts I’ve seen so far look nothing like this- how do you go about building this saber? I think this looks so freaking cool!!!
rush,fdpunub,t1_fdpshue,1578641196.0,"Ah man Kid Gloves is a banger for sure thought! That opening guitar riff gave me inspiration to mess with delay and create my latest tune (nothing released yet, just a thought experiment). But yeah that tune slaps"
StarWars,fdp2jlk,t1_fdnv6ax,1578618476.0,Yeah I think you're right. I also vaguely remember something I read recently that said Luke spent about six months to a year with Yoda before facing Vader the first time and it isn't explained very well in the movie. The justification being that the Falcon didn't have warp drive available so it took them a while to get to Cloud City
lightsabers,fdp0xgu,t1_fdnrw54,1578617382.0,"That’s fair, I totally see that. So I’ll definitely take note: perhaps the saber of your dreams is actually a mixture of sources. Makes it feel more like a treasure hunt lol"
lightsabers,fdnlu49,t1_fdnfsgb,1578588493.0,"Vader's Vault is overpriced and their sabers look stylistically dull. I'd take an Ultrasabers one over V V, but that's just my opinion."

StarWars,fcwkth7,t1_fcw0mq9,1578028391.0,"If these were movies made with a smaller budget, I'd totally see that. But this is Star Wars, they could have done another take if that wasn't clearly the tone they wanted. My point is that I think they wanted us to see that Anakin didn't want kids, yet we keep saying that he did."

StarWars,fcu0pcz,t1_fct7npi,1577968505.0,"That’s what I never understood- he doesn’t seem to be happy about having kids. Why does everyone keep saying that? When Padme tells him she’s pregnant, he looks and sounds so off put by it and never seems to give a shit about having a kid. He hesitates for super long and then says “that’s wonderful” in the most unconvincing tone I’ve even heard. So no, Anakin was not excited to have kids."
