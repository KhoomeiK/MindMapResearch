When someone sits and tells me their experience, I focus on keeping my face a bit neutral. The lack of shock has led to many opening up more.

One just needed to talk it out, and my face allowed her to feel comfortable. 

Sometimes I get so caught up describing something I blank out, then see the expression and it jolts me. One time was in a game store when I was touching on an ex, and without thinking went into details. Poor woman was shocked at how nuts he was.
