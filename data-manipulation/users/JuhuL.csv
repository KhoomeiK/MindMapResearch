However, when you type that share code (GP6M+WJ Les Haies) into Maps, it puts you down pretty close to where the place seemed to be. Google estimates that it would take around 4 h 30 min to drive there from Nice with some traffic. Without traffic it would be pretty close to 4 h 20 min, which I still consider a win.

While you could plug them with whatever you want, you'd have to remove it every time you want to take the side panel off.

Some kind of a gasket around the edge could work, as explained by other users. You could probably glue the gasket into the top panel, as long as the gasket isn't too thick, and the top panel can still slot in properly."

As you can read from the Wikipedia page you linked, 99,7% of people suffered no permanent damage from getting tazed. Even then, I'd GUESS most of the injuries caused by taser use were related to the perp face planting into the curb. Not from the electric shock damaging their brain."

I was thinking about it from the other person's perspective:

1. Video talks about what an electric shock does to your body

2. Original comment mentions how it's still better to get tazed than be shot

3. I misunderstood your comment, as arguing with the the above-mentioned fact.

Jos haluaisin vielä tehokkaamman kirkasvalonlampun, voisi sitä käyttää herätysvalon kanssa, jolloin pelkkä on/off kytkin tuskin häiritsisi. Kunhan se ei menisi salamana päälle pimeässä huoneessa.

Kirkkaampi herätysvalo voisi kyllä olla kivakin: Kuvittelisin, että kirkkaamman valon voisi laittaa kauemmaksi sängystä, ja osoittamaan vaikka seinään, jolloin valo olisi tasaisempaa ja muistuttaisi enemmän aurinkoa. Tämä saattaisi helpottaa heräämistä entisestään."

Android,fc44ktb,t1_fc3kjfs,1577406474.0,"The ""Best Buy look"" describes having way over the top saturation to make the display stand out from a wall of TVs. Cranking the saturation up results in bad color accuracy and often makes scenes look unnatural, which is why it's frowned upon.

As for smartphones, use what you prefer. I personally use the most vivid option, since I don't like the washed-out look and I like how the UI elements pop with an AMOLED display.

If I was doing color-sensitive work, I'd use something more reasonable and accurate, like sRGB, but I very rarely do anything like that."
