comicbooks,ffotasn,t3_eudpxq,1580081493.0,That’s awesome. Thanks for reminding me I’ve got to get Compendium 4. I put it off because I’m scared of the ending.
Shitty_Car_Mods,fforyyx,t1_ffoq9v8,1580080908.0,Right? Some kind of “Jesus take the wheel” ideology I assume. The whole thing was so odd.
AmItheAsshole,ffmx96i,t3_eu995c,1580059821.0,NTA she’s a trash b**** who thinks Chop House is fancy. If she’s so big money she should have a country club membership and eat there away from the rest of us.

TooAfraidToAsk,ffgpotu,t3_eti3qc,1579911903.0,"I worked hard in school to get a title that would enable me to spend my days in service to others and enough money to share with friends, family, and coworkers. I love to buy things for others and myself. When I get to the point where I can’t enjoy my things any longer, I’ll have fun giving them to other people who like them. You’re right that this life is temporary and I’m choosing to have a good time while I can. Nothing to lose."
Sneakers,ffgm7no,t3_eti859,1579909483.0,I wore them for 3 days straight. My coworker made the comment that she’s never seen me in the same shoes more than once.

watchthingsfly,fff5d39,t3_esjljy,1579876116.0,Just slightly bumping the reef will cut you instantly. The cuts almost always get infected as reefs are composed of tiny organisms that then get introduced into the skin. I can’t imagine crashing into it full speed.

Sneakers,fevyrsh,t3_eqqkqg,1579403237.0,They would look great with the Super Mario Vans. I think there were some Nintendo themed Air Max as well as Puma RS-X that would look good too.
