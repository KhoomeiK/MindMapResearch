However, some 6 years ago I bought a Texas Instruments TI-36X Pro. It was among the most advanced calculators allowed in my university (mechanical engineering). It is awesome once you get used to it. You can enter 8 variables in its memory, which can be a huge deal for longer equations (write up the equation with the variables, then just change the variable and recall the equation from history, it made me very happy once I figured this out...). I think those were the best 20€ I ever spent, and I got so used to this calculator I would struggle to swap now. The display is really nice...


I know many universities require graphing calculators, but overall I think that's not such a great idea. A nice math problem can easily be solved with a standard calculator, or even without a calculator if the numbers are really nice (okay, plenty of more complex engineering equations usually never make nice numbers...). But those advanced graphing calculators can probably even connect to the internet nowadays, opening up loads of ways for cheating.



The RPN calculators also seem very cool, I'm thinking about buying the HP 35s for a while now, but I'll probably just miss mi ti36x..."

Besides the huge language barrier which is required by pretty much any citizenship (in comparison, almost everyone in Europe speaks English so it's not a problem when migrating to the US), naturalization is generally much harder. I live in Slovenia - I doubt any foreigner ever truly learned our language unless he grew up here, but for naturalization, perfect knowledge is not required (but enough for simple communication and understanding). You need to renounce your foreign citizenship, and you need to live here for at least 10 years before you can apply for it. It is easier if you are married (as it is everywhere...). If I look across the border, I know getting the Croatian citizenship is almost impossible for me, even if I were married to a Croatian. I know the laws are very strict in Austria too, they also require you to live at least 10 years there, know German, and they really do not want to give citizenship to immigrants who just work there (because a lot of people do that for the higher wages).


In the US, you inly have to live there 3-5 years for naturalization (I think depending on what kind of a visa you have when you live there before gaining citizenship).



You can still gain US citizenship and then decide to move elsewhere. But if you live for 10 years in some European country, you'll probably already settle down and have a family...


However, it's interesting to see how you have to have a wife for 3 years in the US to apply for citizenship, but only for 1 year here in Slovenia. Probably because the US has a problem with fake marriages to gain citizenship...



Besides, the US has a major problem because anyone born there can get the citizenship. Asians go there specifically to give birth, to later gain citizenship through the children. I don't think any European country gives the citizenship this way, unless the baby has no documents or known parents."

But they had those oiling problems, and apart from basic maintenance servicing it was problematic. It may make sense on paper, to put the clutch up front - replacing it is very easy. But the wet clutch lasted a long time. Instead this bike had the generator at the back, and a burnt stator meant you had to take the whole bike apart to get into the engine (complete opposite of older BMW boxers and Guzzi twins where you had to take the bike apart to replace the clutch - though the clutch generally lasted at least 80k km and gave warnings in top gear before it wore out, while old stators were commonly fried and are still problematic even on modern bikes).



Ironically, the current watercooled BMW boxers suffer the same problems with the stator - it's a huge PITA to replace it. Really annoying, considering the previous models (r1100, R1150, oil cooled R1200 like the rninet) simply used s belt driven car alternator which was easy to replace and pretty much never failed like a permanent magnet motorcycle generator tends to (this is because regulating a car generator with a magnetic central rotor is simple, you can shit it off, but permanent magnet motorcycle generators always produce power and the excess has to be turned into heat, which eventually always causes strain...).



But it isn't just this, the CX engine is very complex to take apart. To replace something as basic as piston rings (keep in mind this is a 70's bike with iron bores, they need to be replaced a lot sooner than on modern engines with nicasil lined cylinders), you need to take everything apart as well, and even then it's hard without special tools. Valve adjustment is easy, but anything else is not.


Also, the oiling issues were quite persistent. Because of that, they didn't produce them for long.


The VT line which replaced it proved to be a lot better, and they were made for three or four decades, up to today (not sure if they still make the transalp or the deauville, but I know they still did a few years ago).

The VT had a narrow V angle with offset crank pins. Really neat layout, makes it function like a Ducati V twin in a narrow layout, but does not have the parallel twin vibration problems.

It is not the measure of the useful mechanical work produced (e.g. turbines which turn electrical generators, transforming thermal energy into mehanical energy, and then into electrical energy). But it is the measure of the total power plant efficiency."
