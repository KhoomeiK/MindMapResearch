relationships,ffhw8sj,t3_eti2yk,1579956729.0,"It’s probably because they don’t want to be your friend, and they do want to have sex with you. It’s a natural dynamic, especially in a place where testosterone is spiked from lifting. Even if someone ends up being your friend, the thought is still there."
ChoosingBeggars,ffhvh76,t3_etmcdi,1579955786.0,Why does she think she can speak for him? That’s an issue in itself.
lordsmobile,ffhvd2s,t3_etpo22,1579955644.0,"As a new player, focus on construction and research and look up the heroes that help you do that like trickster  for research and both Scarlett and safe for construction. Once you beat their elite stages with three stars, you can run through them without playing them in order to get medals to upgrade their effects. Upgrading their rank is important too, but usually unlocks battle powers and not passive powers/boosts."
relationships,ffhv205,t3_etl7ge,1579955250.0,"I can see how you’d be hurt, but the flip side is he felt comfortable enough to say that to you. I think that means he trusts you enough to just be able to be supportive in that moment of weakness. Obviously we all move on differently, and just because he still has feelings come up doesn’t necessarily invalidate his feelings for you."
sex,ffeojyj,t3_et70ys,1579857502.0,"Congrats! Because you’ve had trauma, make sure to see a therapist that is experienced and try not to use alcohol as a catalyst for getting comfortable enough to orgasm. Happy cumming ( ;"
tabletennis,ffeoaex,t3_et74rl,1579857100.0,That’s some of the best footwork in table tennis today getting spanked on returns. One of the best coaches of all time.
relationships,ffeo6bm,t3_et15a1,1579856931.0,"You seem extremely emotionally erratic if you have to force someone to lie after they tried doing something with you so they can speak openly. Maybe both of you should stop editing yourselves and just say what you really mean, but you need to learn how to rationalize you emotions and communicate in a healthy way where if he says something to you you take it at face value and don’t sit in a corner letting this anger build up over something you don’t know to be true. Go to therapy, he’s a young guy and if this is the way you approach the relationship now, he might love you but he won’t like you if episodes like this keep happening."

relationships,ffbq8c1,t3_esoiqp,1579778259.0,Use meetup and pursue things you find interesting. All kinds of groups including dating and they are open to new people.
socialskills,ffbq5z1,t3_esmd94,1579778168.0,"You don’t talk to a group when you are public speaking, you hop between individuals. Just approach it that way and take chances in talking and you’ll get better with the uncomfortable aspect. Exposure is best."
NoStupidQuestions,ffbq0w6,t3_esentn,1579777969.0,I’m not quite sure. Presumably you’d be the size that a Jaguar would hunt. But I don’t know that jags typically hunt things with aposematic coloring so it would be hard to say.
relationships,ff8xdjd,t3_es3qcm,1579699175.0,"You’re marrying the guy. Isn’t that like the ultimate “he is yours” moment? I used to just use social media to fool around on and not take so seriously. I didn’t want my relationship to be on display because my relationship shouldn’t need to be approved by other people. It’s like you’re ramming it down his throat instead of letting him post something because he wants to of you. He definitely doesn’t like you doing that to him and then when he does post you he’s frustrated about it because it is coming from a place of obligation instead of love since you keep having these serious talks to him about posting on a site that sells your big data and can manipulate you. As a man he wants to do things out of the kindness of his heart, not because you’re in his face telling him what the right thing to do is. If he doesn’t want to use social media that way, as long as his profile doesn’t explicitly say single, you shouldn’t die on this hill."
FiftyFifty,ff8wjyd,t3_erwgq0,1579698443.0,"Ehh never saw a cow in that much water, wasn’t too fooled. Last pic is hilarious tho."
socialskills,ff8vqdv,t3_es7zst,1579697704.0,"Well man, the sad news is that you’re ugly. But the good news is that women kind of look at us from attributes/achievements down to looks whereas we kind of look at women from looks up to achievements. An ugly girl has it a lot harder. Here’s the numerous ways to make your situation better: you can develop your confidence, humor, charm, charisma, work out, educate yourself, and find your purpose as a man on your mission and I guarantee you women will be attracted to you. There are plenty of confidence courses out there, things to help you learn to talk to women, and apps like meetup where you can go meet others and pursue your life interests. YOU NEED TO BE PROACTIVE. You are a shitty unsolved rubix cube atm but if you keep spinning and twisting you’ll learn how to be social and confident. 

For daily life: Search Charisma On Command.

For dating and seeing just how to have fun interactions with women: https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuqoHdZbJI8k9dq-MsOL5AMqSDnVJP6ZY (these are more examples but show how you don’t have to be the best looking guys to have fun interactions).

Being social is all about reps. Search for social challenges on the internet you can go out and do in your every day life that desensitize you to your limiting beliefs. For example, go lay down in a super market for thirty seconds and take a pic of your feet. When you get up, you’ll realize no one cares and you should stop worrying about what people think. You’ll also feel this rush of power. Doing things that put you out of your comfort zone will help you develop a social muscle. Anyway, it’s a lot of work but if you truly want to be someone you’re proud of, you have to begin somewhere. Best of luck to you my friend."
changemyview,ff8u36o,t3_es9ouk,1579696117.0,"I think an argument could be made that a healthy person has a moral conscience to not do harm to others. In your example about beer, the beer is not bad. It’s an inanimate object. It doesn’t go around pursuing drivers en route to get them drunk. Drivers go to a place, pick up the alcohol and either consume it or take it home, and then make the decision to drive once intoxicated. Therefore it’s not an accurate comparison. Someone whose been traumatized and has not learned set boundaries because of that might pursue what they know to be wrong but are recreating what they’ve been through and it’s stimulating to them. Therefore, a person that becomes a homewrecker has responsibility in the situation and ends up having intent whereas the beer can’t. No one is pardoning the cheater in the marriage, but why would you go after a taken person if there is not something wrong with you and your intent when you can be with a single person?"
relationships,ff8swy8,t3_es84np,1579694856.0,This is your fault man. You need to communicate. You feeling bad about something isn’t a reason to not talk about things. Like be really willing to take an L and not settle if it means confronting her about it because then you give her the option to make the choice of whether she wants to go back to living with her parents or staying with you and still having a cushy life while contributing more.

CBT,ff8s8ok,t3_ervy3q,1579694070.0,Not practicing it actively in order to ingrain it into you as a habit. I carried around sheets with me for the first month and would work things out like case studies.

You were having a troll baby the whole time.
tabletennis,ff5qi7t,t3_ermjpt,1579606138.0,Awesome vid but feel like they should’ve highlighted Ma Long on his year or two of destruction to the Olympics instead of 2017-2018 which were relatively not as good of years due to injury.
terracehouse,ff5ie9n,t1_ff2c5jv,1579594278.0,"I don’t think so. I do think it sounds like you hear racism as a buzz word a lot and aren’t sure how to use it. Based on the episode this week, you can see Kai just has no flow or setup in his punchlines. But however dark what he said was, there’s also truth in it which is sad. He just didn’t make it funny. There’s a clear difference between saying the truth and calling something racist."
CBT,feln79d,t3_eplt6c,1579226199.0,"You’ll learn in CBT that one of the cognitive distortions we go through is all or nothing thinking, discrediting your good qualities, and blaming the situation completely on you when sometimes it’s out of your hands.

If I were you, I would reframe this thought to say “I am proud of myself for seeking help, and even though I missed my appointment today I am taking the steps forward to a better me”. 

This is how (with some practice of course) you will begin to talk to yourself and it will greatly relieve your anxiety. This is why you must keep your appointments because I know you are tired of feeling the way you do."
toastme,felmm5m,t1_fehd68p,1579225799.0,"Yea, you definitely should. You need to learn how to be okay living on the daily and the al anon meetings are one thing that will do that.

You know where I’m going with this. I was going to say listen to your husband when he says good things because he means it, and you are superimposing your thoughts and insecurities onto him. What I don’t get is the comment, is this a thing he’s said before? You’d benefit massively from CBT because you’ll learn how to control your thoughts to be more positive and fight off anxiety and depression with some work. That’s one thing (among others) your therapist should specialize in."
AmItheAsshole,fegdr04,t3_eov4l6,1579089115.0,"NTA. I’ve seen arguments in here for women being afraid to approach by themselves which is valid if they feel intimidated. That’s not the case here because she wasn’t alone. Your gf came off insensitive and then when she didn’t get her way, she acted like a bitch to you because you were being compassionate. What I’ve heard from homeless people is that it’s not even the lack of money that hurts as much as the lack of being acknowledged as a person. I think you should really consider what you both value because it’s clear she has an ugliness/ fear in her when it comes to this stuff."
toastme,fegdd7g,t3_eorlnj,1579088668.0,"Al anon meetings will help you deal with your mother’s disease. Your family should realistically go too so you know how to handle her and hopefully get her into recovery in such a way that you’ll support her when she’s sober and not bleed your heart out when she’s not sober, because you’ll know how not to enable her. I know it’s a lot right now but she is still your mom and for your and her sake, eventually it might be a road you should explore.

tabletennis,fegcqjm,t3_eooi5m,1579087909.0,"I would say no. Op is for any situation. I think the situation you are coming across here is maybe your partner doesn’t have a ton of experience with playing against them. Also, you don’t see the same type of aggressive game against pips in the women’s game that you see in the men’s game unless we are talking about top of the world players (where every single ball is looped hard) so maybe since there is more short game overall, it’s much easier to make mistakes with a ball that will come back differently every time."

terracehouse,fed64o6,t3_eogm32,1579000742.0,How do you even conclude racism from what he said? I agree they just weren’t that funny of bits but it’s hard to see how a joke lands without an audience. ALSO....comedy has the right to be offensive and often is where you hear the truth people think. Much of what is important to talk about risks offending another person. There’s no two ways around it so why not comedy? At least you step away from the suffering that all of us experience temporarily to laugh. At its surface he told a shock joke. At the jokes core he is making a statement about the high prevalence of suicide these people have because they’re conditioned to work themselves to death. Does that mean we don’t do it because our generation embodies a softness to criticism and upsetting anyone for any reason? No. If you choose to be different you will be criticized if you are out of the ordinary because people don’t understand you yet. That’s also a healthy response because it’s how we recognize things that are actually not good and worth discussing. The shift will keep progressing too because censorship and not leaving everything to be spoken about is even being torn down by some of the biggest comedians (like Chapelle) because they’re tired of it.

Build yourself up to be a man whose time is valuable for yourself by figuring out what your grind and purpose is, and she (Or whomever ends up in her place) will chase you to have some of that time.

Like if you have a conversation with someone do you tell each other right away or tell each other when it’s immediately relevant? I prefer the first way and would think that she should’ve brought it up to you, but I don’t know you guys. I just think you need to confront her and say hey, I know you went and saw your ex. I need you to be honest about why. Don’t let her take over the subject because you looked at her phone, because if she diverts it she probably has a reason to."

If you’re “conventionally attractive” and get hit on a lot, I find it hard to believe you don’t already know what’s going on.
