rhino,ffz2yvh,t1_ffz1pnr,1580362253.0,So..I just made this. I know it's not the exact same thing and I know your shape is more complex but I did it by creating the outline path. I drew the circle connected the peaks and joined them together. I placed the square cross section and did sweep 1 rail and got this. [https://imgur.com/a/0aaq0Vg](https://imgur.com/a/0aaq0Vg) Now It sounds like you would like it to sizes in the cross section. Thicker in one part of the ring and thinner near the underside of your finger (typical for most rings) If that's the case then I don't know. I just played around with that for a few minutes and I sorta got it but I'm not sure if it's a best practices type of deal or more like...i made it work in the least best method.
rhino,ffz0w4r,t1_ffyzxqd,1580360407.0,I think the problem is your using industry jargon for things I'm not aware of. It just took me this long to figure out this is for jewelry. Could you dumb it down for me? What profile (cross section) do you want to flow along the circle portion and what cross section do you want on the I'm guessing you'd call it the addition?
rhino,ffyzir2,t3_evznid,1580359263.0,I wanted to show you the differences I got from joining one and not joining one. That being said I'm still not exactly sure why your circle is segmented. [https://imgur.com/a/UelK3vU](https://imgur.com/a/UelK3vU)
rhino,ffyysrd,t3_evznid,1580358669.0,I've had this problem before and I think the solution was to join the segments together. but the pipe command is going to get you a circular pipe...it looks like your profile isn't a circle
rhino,ffx0lpy,t1_ffx03kq,1580315180.0,There’s dozens of ways to do this. Really
rhino,ffwq91h,t1_ffwp6t8,1580308367.0,You can also just draw that shape out and extrude it into a block and use the chamfer command but I find it harder to get the exact shape you want using those modifiers.
rhino,ffwp6t8,t3_evncnq,1580307597.0,Draw the curvature of the steel and offset it by idk whatever looks good. Move that offset up slightly and connect them via a line segment. Then use the sweep two rails command and that’ll create the complex shape.

videos,ffth7s9,t1_fftgeja,1580220458.0,Yeah I could see that. I’m not sure there’s one right answer but ideally it would be able to be both. The Navajo would be one of the richer tribes due to size but I’m not sure they would have that sort of financial means.
videos,fftgyvm,t1_fft6plu,1580220260.0,Yeah but ask the Egyptians about having their relics in museums. Many of those relics went straight into museums. Theres and argument to be made either way but let’s be honest most of the indigenous communities do not have money to buy their artifacts back or money to display them in a true museum quality and therefore it wouldn’t even be considered to send them to their homes because the lack of preservationist and historians to care for the objects. It’s slightly ironic that the people whom they best belong to are least capable of taking care of them. It’s something to think about and I’m not sure what’s right
videos,fftgehf,t1_fftcoth,1580219800.0,No. They’d have to have reason to believe he had knowledge of the worth and even still probably not. Whose to stay despite the worth of an object that you have a market ready to buy it.
videos,fft57tt,t1_fft4q15,1580207753.0,The appraiser bought the second blanket and sold it a few years later to a family that was making a massive donation to the Native American heritage something or other. It wasn’t known if the blanket was going to the organization but it was sort of implied that it was going to end up there at some point if not with the artifact donation perhaps in the future. But it’s not been explicitly said for sure. Turns out the native Americans weren’t happy because the items didn’t find their way back to the tribes but instead Went to the met on loan. Many items the tribes insisted had to be looted or bought on the black market due to the nature of their usage. https://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2017/diker-collection

videos,fft1ppz,t1_fft16fp,1580202350.0,well then you're not thinking about the concepts that it took to make those things. Arrowheads thousands up thousands exist. Why? because they were a neccessity and they were easy to make. Anyone with a little of training can use a hard rock and piece of leather to nap a piece of quartz or obsidian into an arrowhead. Grindstone? Yeah they too are of value. I know this because one town over from me an entire museum is dedicated to modern grinding stone and ancient cherokee stones. The area was a historic grist mill. Now textiles. First off blankets were a luxury because it took refining a plant into thread or trading for enough thread and additionally it takes a specialized individual to make the blanket by hand. Then to obtain dye which was rare and valuable.
videos,fft0s8k,t1_fft0ccu,1580200970.0,"so. historical things are historical and people pay whatever for rare items. I'm sure someone out there has paid audacious sums of money for irrelevant things some less interesting than that. Hell, Barrett Jackson every year someone will pay three-four times as much for a factory production vehicle simply because it has number 1 in the vin number. Is the number 1 of the car worth 3 times as much as the one sitting on a showroom floor right now? To say it's a blanket doesn't really matter because it no longer performs blanket duties. It's not going to sit on some old ladies lap while she nits cardigans and sips earl grey. It's an artifact. It's a museum item. It'd be like going to the Smithsonian and saying it's an old pair of shoes, etc, etc. So yeah if the main point is that's so much money for an innocuous item then we could literally go down that rabbit hole all day."

Oh and because of that episode a man who was watching realized he had a similar blanket and found out it was in fact also worth 1 million plus.

rhino,ffkl6ms,t1_ffkkgo2,1580024591.0,"yeah honestly, it's looking like this is probably the answer. It just doesn't make sense why contour isn't smarter. It would be no different from running contour along the chosen axis to contour along a certain object. I had this problem before many years ago when I was trying to build a large scale waffle model of a hot air balloon. The the balloon was symmetrical so I just used the profile over and over again but the basket I had to do it by hand. It was only 8 wall sections for that so it wasn't so bad but I was hoping to run a command to make it a little more time efficient."
rhino,ffkiyq2,t1_ffkh7yx,1580023540.0,Okay here's the problem to that and sorta what I've been trying to explain. The area centroid is helpful but once you polar array the lines it becomes sorta useless. The line in this picture will illustrate why. I have to build this thing so if I polar array it the lines will not fall perpendicular to the surface it will fall along whatever angle the array is. Imagine building that wall out of flat surfaces (studs) the studs have to run perpendicular to the wall surface. [https://imgur.com/a/q8xwzr7](https://imgur.com/a/q8xwzr7)
rhino,ffk3yqi,t1_ffk3ggr,1580015090.0,yeah unfortunately that's not the important part. The important part is trying to get evenly space wall sections because as someone else pointed out you can use the intersection command to get the shape but it would be at fairly random intervals. Even if you used the polar array command since the object isn't circle means the sections are necessarily going to be perpendicular.
rhino,ffk3ay6,t1_ffk2rls,1580014499.0,"That actually did a fairly decent job. It extracted the curves when you select ""extract all."" it didn't do the thickness but it maybe be a good start. Thanks."
rhino,ffk346w,t1_ffk2xts,1580014334.0,not really just extrude the lines and where they overlap just boolean...difference I think...it's been a while since I've done it but it creates the half laps nicely.
rhino,ffk2yze,t1_ffk1xv1,1580014205.0,"right but that's the other top suggestion. The problem is the shape isn't perfectly circular so the line array wouldn't be evenly spaced around the object and since it's not perfectly circular the ""wall sections"" are might not be perpendicular to the intersecting lines you know? Like...it's not a terrible option but if this has to be a large scale thing it can't have that much error it it."
rhino,ffk1xzh,t1_ffk1dw7,1580013316.0,yeah unfortunately I don't have grasshopper and also am running rhino on a mac. It's just insane to me that contour only works along an axis. Why isn't there a contour function that can just follow along the object.
rhino,ffk1u6d,t1_ffk1jrn,1580013226.0,not the answer I was hoping for but probably the correct one. Extract wiremess sorta works but it gets pretty hazy with all the extra details and like you say it's not an equal intervals.
rhino,ffk1qtm,t1_ffk1b0q,1580013146.0,"Like I've said contour only works perpendicular to the project. That won't work, I need contour to go around the object so that I have ""wall sections"""
rhino,ffk1mhk,t1_ffk1gjx,1580013043.0,that gets rings not wall sections though.
rhino,ffk0lgn,t1_ffjyia9,1580012155.0,"This is the closest answer, however, that would assume the shape is a perfect circle and it not. If you polar array a section plan around a non circular shape then the Waffle profiles won't be perpendicular to the thickness of the shape."
rhino,ffjzgz9,t1_ffjy6jp,1580011225.0,"a lot of people keep suggesting using array. Did array change? for me array was to take an object and to create duplicated along a circle or in a matrix. I am trying to get the ""wall sections"" of this shape. If you use contour it does that but it only does it directions. Since this is a hollow tube shape I need the sections to travel in the shape of the object. I've posted a link above in my first comment."
rhino,ffjz9wp,t1_ffjywdf,1580011069.0,"no like the shape above. lets say i need to make that shape out of plywood. So the thickness you see represents the walls. So in order to make it I need the sections of the walls to create a ""waffle model"" imagine if you were to extract wiremesh from the object you get all those lines. I need the linework but at equal distances from each other."
rhino,ffjy21a,t1_ffjxbzz,1580010102.0,so I just watched a video on that command and that took a line segment and revolved it around a shape. I'm not sure how that would extract the shape I'm looking for? Could you explain.
rhino,ffjwi2s,t1_ffjwefs,1580008863.0,I just made a new post on her because no one understood what i was talking about and it has a photo.
rhino,ffjvscm,t3_eu17ji,1580008310.0,There seems to be some confusion so I made a simple weird model. Basically I have an open ended shape that I need to build a waffle model of (not exactly this but close.) The basic contour command goes along one axis or the other it doesn't revolve around the object. My question is simply this how can i get the contour lines to create a model from this that goes along the object. Extract surfaces work but it doesn't group them together and it's a pain. I want something to work similar to contour. like this [http://torabiarchitect.com/parametric-array/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/04\_Nina\_Hattemer\_M%C3%B6bel.jpg](http://torabiarchitect.com/parametric-array/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/04_Nina_Hattemer_M%C3%B6bel.jpg)
rhino,ffjtxsa,t1_ffjszfw,1580006853.0,that's how to build the shape. I'm talking about creating a waffle model. I have a vase (lets call it that) and I want to build that vase as a waffle model. I want the structural member to run around the object like this. Contour works by asking you to contour in either the x axis or y axis and i need it to do this. [http://torabiarchitect.com/parametric-array/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/04\_Nina\_Hattemer\_M%C3%B6bel.jpg](http://torabiarchitect.com/parametric-array/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/04_Nina_Hattemer_M%C3%B6bel.jpg)

howto,ffjds5i,t1_ffjdcc4,1579996149.0,Tell you what why don’t you message me the details. Im going out for dinner right now and I’m not really able to detail it out. Also if you could provide me some details that would be great. Like who is this for (your client or yourself) what type of general budget (the ideas I’m giving you may end up being over budget) and any It would be awesome if you could maybe annotate the drawing with guesstimates of measurements. Heights some width etc.
howto,ffjd3rs,t1_ffjcqwg,1579995754.0,The structure is the easy part believe it or not. Like for me I could model the thing up in 3D and have the plans laid out for the CNC in a couple days. We built similar things out of cardboard and while this is much more permanent the ideas are still pretty similar. You could even use the jig saw to do it but that would be a nightmare.
howto,ffjcfyx,t1_ffjan4x,1579995370.0,Sheet metal is really expensive and takes a lot of work to form it well. I’d try the bendable plywood first and then another idea if you’re willing to alter your design. A friend of mine during college was the head of the art workshop. We were down there one day and he says come in here and let me show you around. He had taken his office and ran some two by fours all over it and when anytime there was off cuts the students didn’t want he would grab them and just screw them into the framework. He was showing up what looked like the literally inside of a bird nest. If you did the framing I was speaking of and then did that instead of a solid surface it would be bird nest like. Also another material that I’ve been diving into deeper lately is sign makers foam. When carved and coated correctly it can give some magical appearances. It’s what Disney uses on a lot of their exaggerated details like window frames and roof facia boards etc.

howto,ffj9r7v,t3_ety053,1579993757.0,so I’m someone who studied architecture and fabrication in college and the way I would go about the curved walls is the most professional way would be to get the structure Cnc’d. We wall this the waffle model in architecture. It’s clean and it pieces together well for installation. The skin would need to be determined if it’s a rigid or flexible material. If rigid probably fiber glass. If it’s flexible then any material of your liking. Or even bendable plywood. Feel free to email me I have like a ton of different ways to build it in my head I just need to know your limitations.
KitchenConfidential,ffg3afo,t1_ffg2x68,1579897530.0,Yeah but he was EC at Husk Charleston then moved to Nashville to open that one and when the Greenville one opened I expected him to have some involvement that being said he never did. I think it ended up being one of the long time chefs of the Charleston location but to be 100% honest I didn’t keep up with it.
KitchenConfidential,fffe8fz,t1_fffbu3k,1579882034.0,Skinny is a stretch. He’s definitely down some pounds but that’s probably attributed to not drinking anymore. He does look tired though. Like I say it’s a pressure cooker if it normally takes 20-30 years of a normal jobs stress to break you down a kitchen job can achieve that same great level of brokenness in just 5. So much more efficient!
KitchenConfidential,ffenmfo,t3_et7q3u,1579856106.0,"I was unaware that Brock had stepped away from his restaurants. I lived in Charleston for some time and I grew up in Greenville so Husk is a big name around these parts but I didn't know why he wasn't involved with the Greenville location until now. I love his ideas of reinterpreting history and lost cultures into the modern forefront by using those forgotten flavors. I used to work in restaurants and while I enjoyed it I knew ultimately it wasn't going to be for me in it's current form. It's a pressure cooker and  most restaurants don't align with my viewpoint of waste reduction and using what is available seasonally. Well, not until you hit very high end cookery. In college I found myself interested in architecture and fell in love. It's something I knew I was meant to be but always wanted to keep an ear and mind to the food world. At the end of this interview, Brock really details what is a concept that would be considered quite nouveau by stark traditionalist who are more worried about the accolades of how many scars and battle wounds you can carry without dropping. The idea is equal parts healthy lifestyle but something it would be straight out of an architecture design collaboration to better design a business practice that can admittedly by quite taxing and draining, as I'm sure you are all quite aware of. The idea that food is healing but the individuals providing the meal cannot go without that same mental nourishment is succinct but a noble endeavor and I wish him nothing but great success and for his continued influence to extend into realms previously untested in this field."

KitchenConfidential,ff8pxkq,t1_ff8ps7k,1579691052.0,I agree with what you’re saying to the max. I’m for it but I live in a state that will not unionize.

architecture,ff8plbj,t1_ff8p2hf,1579690569.0,Maybe 10 years ago that stigma would still persist but people have diseases were they constantly feel pain without any reason. The nervous system is just being overloaded for no reason. If they feel it isn’t visual so not reliable remind them not everything is and sometimes the worst pain is from our bodies turning on themselves.

KitchenConfidential,ff8pcpz,t1_ff8oyvu,1579690220.0,I agree report them but the idea of lawyering up because you’re going to be  able to sue is unrealistic and probably couldn’t win without concrete evidence basically the owner admitting it.

architecture,ff8nixv,t1_ff8n4za,1579687472.0,I definitely agree with that but the entire post was about nothing new in old cities and I’m saying if you’re not forcefully tearing something down it’s unrealistic and even when repairing/renovating we have to have the ability to modernize for a number of reasons infrastructure etc. I’d also argue that building on suburbs is not relevant in terms of building cities because the scale and the type of construction doesn’t compare. Sure you can build a few dozen houses but is someone going to literally go and build a city and streets. Design a CBD and allow it to manifest under controlled design for 30-50 years. The only city that I know that did that was Brazilia just a new city from nothing. You could also maybe say what the UAE and those extremely oil rich nations are doing but again it takes massive levels of income to create a new city
architecture,ff8mjju,t1_ff8m4y0,1579685959.0,I think sometimes we look at professors as this hardened people who are intolerant of excuses and some are assholes to put it lightly but if you come in with humility being open and honest most of them are more concerned with developing good people into better people and not about breaking someone down so they can bill through. I think that’s a very antiquated way of teaching and fortunately I’ve only seen one or two still using it. I hope you are able to figure out the headaches. I’ve recently went through some weird things myself and I feel for you on the motivation side of it.
architecture,ff8mauo,t1_ff8lzel,1579685580.0,I commented about this below. No one has the economical means to completely just build a new city every time someone deems an entire sector as historically significant. I’m not saying tear it down and start over but if circumstances dictate to build a need building in a old city you should be able to do so if land is available.  Most towns and cities have some historical significance so if when is your history more important than someone else’s. You can’t build here but build over there because their buildings aren’t quite as old? Again I’m not saying tear something done to build new but new content can and should be built in old context. That’s literally how cities have always been created.
architecture,ff8lzgw,t3_es965r,1579685091.0,I think first and foremost is providing the information to all of your professors and letting them know you are taking as much action as possible to curb the pain. Maybe a quick email and provide them an opportunity to speak with you in private about the matter so if an event occurs where you are unable to complete something on time they might be willing to work with you.  We had a student who was narcoleptic and he would randomly fall asleep throughout class. Unfortunately he used it as a crunch and while he started out a year before me I’m not sure he even graduated a year after me because he was unwilling to complete his work even at increased deadlines. So first off let your profs know. All of mine were super helpful and encouraging for those who had unusual circumstances.
architecture,ff8976u,t1_ff86eak,1579669702.0,"how many opportunities is there really to create new cities? Real world applications, how often is a new cities just planned from start to finish? 1...that I can name Brazilia. And it wasn't walkable. The idea we can just build new cities is a really lovely one but we forget that there takes funding and a desire and still even then it's not likely. Maybe in emerging countries it's possible but think about the feasibility of that in the US or Europe."
architecture,ff88vw8,t1_ff85mm3,1579669420.0,"But in the same vein the job of the architect is to design within the parameters we've been given. We cannot control the whole of the city just the effort we put together for each individual plot of land we've been assigned to. None of us have the ability to paint with broad strokes unless you're Hausmann in Paris. The city is a patchwork of timelines and artist and style. Just because something is new doesn't mean it is unjoyful or inherently less integrated within the fabric. Cities are not a demarcation of one period in time they are these cyclical evolving organisms. As for the public and fairness we can only generate a building that relates to site, scope, and time and do our best to not alienate the audience but even that is not of our volition. We have clients and codes and architecture boards to answer to. I understand what you're saying in many regards but how many cities are actually the seamless fluidly designed objects that you're referring to and not collections of individual efforts that merge together to create a framework for use to place our own designs into?"

Some buildings are only historically relevant due to their building practices so that would really be detrimental so certain aspects. Some buildings aesthetics are completely dependent on the structural members also. I lived in Charleston for a while when I was studying and the preservation of those buildings (from the city's POV) boils down to not only appearance but in the methodology and the materiality. It makes it extremely difficult to work within the confines of the historically district. You have to source certain bricks, certain mortar, restoring windows takes experts because it's absolutely forbidden to alter them in significant ways. It's very granular, so much so that an entire college/ training program developed within the city to teach those preservation methods. Everything from timber framing and blacksmithing to moulding details. It's endlessly fascinating but you take a step back and you wonder what is this in service of. Is it to maintain culture or to romanticize a time long forgotten. I think preservation should be a case by case situation with the idea that as time moves forward we too move forward and begin seamlessly blending the two cultures. Charleston does not take this point of view. They are more museum that city in many regards."
KitchenConfidential,ff7eftv,t1_ff5npax,1579647653.0,"This is always the advice to people who are fired from a bad restaurant get and honestly it’s not good advice. First it takes years to build a case, second lawyers typically aren’t going to take these cases without some sort of money upfront because how often it results in nothing. Third if you’re in a right to work state your rights aren’t super important in that state to begin with. Last, how do you prove it. It’s not like there’s a camera in the walk in and unless someone else is willing to go to bat for him which probably isn’t the case he’s screwed. This is just some super romantic ideal that justice is always served and unfortunately more often than not it just ends up with the business going under and the person never seeing anything from it. I worked at a place who regularly shorted people’s checks 10 people or so all had complaints to the labor force. Nothing."
architecture,ff7cphn,t3_erzwbx,1579646500.0,But there’s a line to preservation. We are modern societies with modern infrastructure and completely different lifestyles than hundreds of years ago. It’s important to preserve the history but to put it under glass and acting like it’s a time capsule is completely ignoring the fact that it is in fact a city and not a museum. Where do the line get drawn. Is it buildings older than xyz can’t have modern additions? What about renovations/repairs   do we ignore modern building codes? It’s certainly possible to maintain without modernizing but it becomes not only costly but inferior in many regards. There is a line and I think the success is in properly implementing that.

HomeImprovement,ff4u8wa,t1_ff4tekn,1579572576.0,"that is a point, maybe considering backing off the decking from the door. Like leave a pencil or two width gap and those decking are permeable so they allow water to flow through it"

HomeImprovement,ff4r49h,t3_erm119,1579570430.0,Why don’t you just tear down the walls and leave the slab and depending on how it’s built have a small step down. Or level the land off around it. It’s impossible to give you full options without seeing the building method. I mean is it literally just a 6 inch slab? If that’s the case I’d buy some of that outdoor floating decking and veneer over it and have a raised deck that would allow you to mount the pergola columns into it.
HomeImprovement,ff4hij5,t1_ff4he7f,1579563746.0,I mean it’s just a lot of cleaning and then I definitely would invest into a sprayer because painting by hand upward would take forever.
HomeImprovement,ff4770x,t1_ff46qbc,1579557039.0,Basically like this. It’s less overbearing that black but still hides everything well. https://unskinnyboppy.com/2017/08/painted-basement-ceiling-remodel/
HomeImprovement,ff46vcl,t1_ff46qbc,1579556836.0,I mean if that’s your bag sure. I’d probably go like a blueish gray to lighten the space up myself. Looks like a basement and unless it’s like a entertainment space black would be very industrial/ warehouse.
HomeImprovement,ff46ib3,t3_erjy9p,1579556613.0,Maybe try a light mixture of bleach and water and a tire brush. Alternatively you can white wash/ bleach the wood but it’s work and probably not worth it. Maybe Murphy’s wood soap would work but it’s gonna be a lot of work and I doubt it’s going to be super attractive. I’d paint it.
architecture,ff0tlrc,t1_fezlyxl,1579472161.0,"You have to remember modern architecture began initially in the layout and less detail from the exterior. Frank Lloyd Wright was taught under Louis Sullivan and their buildings were considered the primer to modernism, adopting open floor plans and less ornamentation than many of the buildings of the times but if you look at all of Sullivan's work it's still quite elaborate compared to what we think of today, glass and steel wouldn't come to some time later."
KitchenConfidential,ff0g2yf,t1_feyi1mi,1579468585.0,"While I’m sure someone else had managed to can food prior to the 1809 competition that Napoleon and the French government issued it wasnt widely known or commercially available . I’d venture a guess and claim it was not in tin cans as those were in fact invented by a Frenchmen. Each can had to be soldered shut as opposed to the crimping action we have today. Furthermore, while the advent of the can opener does supersede the can itself my point was that we had over 200 years to design a more adequate can opener. The fact it took them 40 years to still fuck it up is irrelevant. My minor was packaging science and the facts here are the once presented to people in the industry including the ones that make the cans themselves. (Yes it was a boring lecture I had to sit through but I got a can top out of it...you’re right that is worthless)"
KitchenConfidential,fevwuhb,t3_eqkf9x,1579402465.0,Canned food first began during Napoleon's reign. It was a way of transporting and preserving food for his warring troops. It's been over 200 years and yet that is still the best can opener we can figure out. We can run our world off of the sun but yeah...this colossal fuck up is the standard.

rhino,feewinr,t1_feeu7yo,1579042735.0,So. I was looking at the handle profile and that’s gonna be a bitch. Its not crazy hard just difficult to explain. Probably create the outline of the circle. Then the handles (all this is in linework) use fillets to get the right curvatures. Create that inner shape and lower them into place. You can then use the blend surface command or maybe loft depending on which works better. Its a lot to explain to someone just starting out. But it could work.
rhino,feej5k6,t3_eoo73c,1579034813.0,Hooookay so my process would be to create the profile of the pan without the handles. It will look like and double walled L. Revolve that 360. Then create the handle and Boolean them in. Then fillet the connection to smooth that out.

I feel like if we are having problems with it already it would be better to just replace it and not hope it's just the battery and allow the return date to expire and be out of luck.

MovieSuggestions,fdhqnae,t1_fdhp8ai,1578428259.0,When it first came out I watched it idk maybe 5 times or something like that. It was super well made but it was sorta big Lebowski-esque building up to this grand subplot that was actually the driving narrative and it’s like well nope that doesn’t really matter too much. I sorta took it as the Paul andersons take of the ramblings  of a incoherent druggie. Where everything is connected and it’s all a conspiracy but in realty it’s just a lot of little interconnected happenstances
