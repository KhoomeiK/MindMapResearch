AskReddit,fe6rxcc,t1_fe6nx2u,1578902533.0,"That has been my experience.  I audited a fair number of graduate classes by simply asking the professor if they were ok with me sitting in on the class.  Granted these were small seminars and I never took a seat from anyone that was paying, but I bought the literature required and took notes diligently.  Only one time that a professor actually required something, a five page submission that was to be presented in front of the class did I balk at.  I was too afraid of making a fool of myself in front of everyone that had been studying for years to get to where I was loafing about."

gaming,fe6r10x,t1_fe6pdhx,1578901328.0,"Ha I get that.  I took a break myself and came back, somewhat forgetting the toxicity of some players.  My response to someone getting all worked up?  'I don't play this to get better, I play it to have a good time.'  They couldn't really grasp that and I simply said, 'oh well, maybe you'll get it'."
explainlikeimfive,fe6qn0t,t1_fe6q6np,1578900833.0,"I was debating that internally.  initially I was going to put nescio but due to the fact the rest of the subjects have the a at the end, I thought it was necessary to keep it all the same.  I guess I saw it as, the person speaking did not know what it was, referencing the thing he did not know it was and since it was in the feminine, to keep it all the same."
worldnews,fe6qh40,t1_fe6pppz,1578900622.0,"Thanks for the food for thought.  It got my gears turning and if definitely is a new playing field that we will be looking at.  It used to be (20 years ago) you had to have some service in the military to really be taken seriously as a candidate, and that is now the minority, and almost looked down upon.  I personally would like to see someone that understands they are accountable to others as opposed to attempting to win on basis of their (cult) personality.  I am not against new blood or the need for change, to me it is more those that are calling for such and what their ends will be."
worldnews,fe6ox8w,t1_fe6olfn,1578898699.0,"Very true, I wonder what the incentive is.  Isn't it the case, that if they get 5% of the vote they get their campaigns funded or some such?  But really, that is a drop in the bucket of their wealth.  Does he hope to run in the future?  Perot was a billionaire and didn't get far, but I guess with a self-proclaimed billionaire attaining the white house, the others may think we are sympathetic to their plight?"
explainlikeimfive,fe6ocli,t1_fe6o2gg,1578898017.0,"Latin has a way of spicing things up for some people.  The japanese took advantage of such in the early 90's.  'oh I have a lexus', 'law' and some fudging.    I drive an 'acura', 'precise' and some flair.  I guess even the germans did too: 'Audi' loud?  hear me?  not sure if it was a cry for help or a boast."

Tonic–clonic seizures are the [seizure type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure_type) most commonly associated with [epilepsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy) and seizures in general and the most common seizure associated with [metabolic imbalances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_disorder).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_tonic%E2%80%93clonic_seizure#cite_note-:0-2) It is a misconception that they are the sole type of seizure, however, as they are the main seizure type in only \~10% of those with epilepsy.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_tonic%E2%80%93clonic_seizure#cite_note-:0-2)"

I always contacted uber and they promptly refunded me the charge.  Sorry you have dealt with such."
atheism,fe674gv,t1_fe60eiu,1578883285.0,"That has been my experience with 'powerhouses of intellectual thought'.  I have interacted with a few due to grad school and attending various conferences, and it is always one of those 'don't meet your heroes' kind of moments.  They are human and it may seem as if their intellect is this vast world of perfection but that only exists for the select few ideals that you may share.  beyond that it becomes painfully clear, they generally are mired in as much bs as the rest of us, they just happened to be succinct enough to clearly state something or were at the right place at the right time."

lansing,fe655c5,t1_fe63g1b,1578882006.0,"Fair enough.  Still doesn't hurt to peek around.  There are plenty of properties that don't operate on the usual move out/in times.  Those actually in my mind are preferable cause it generally means they weren't student houses, but probably a family or something a bit more responsible.  Depending on the area, they may have been GM workers or sparrow/mclaren professionals that decided to move on to other things."
lansing,fe630lp,t1_fe62j8o,1578880642.0,"Personally, I avoid rental companies.  Too often there is a 'gotcha' moment and prefer to deal with individuals who own the properties.  Usually don't have to pay some 'application fee' that is miraculously twice as much as it costs to actually run a credit report.  I find the best option is drive around a neighborhood you like around moveout time and find a house that has a 'for rent' sign out front and go from there.  Most are locals or even live a house or two a way and they care about their properties so it's not some guy looking to make a buck, but rather would maintain the integrity of the neighborhood.

edit: look on zillow or frankly craigslist.  Most rentals in that range probably are going to have some 'character' to them but mainly are updated for the most part with newer kitchen appliances.  I always avoid the washer/dryer hookup situation as that is a big deal breaker for me.  And there is something to walking into your own 'home' as opposed to drudging up carpeted stairs or whatever and having to deal with what other people consider to be their standard of living.  When I lived in apartments around here, even decent ones, the sight of someones garbage or shoes hanging out at the front of their door was irking.  I prefer my privacy and the ability to operate on my own schedule without consideration for others.

2nd edit: Don't think that these new apartments going up are going to last in terms of quality.  They were built on the cheap and are filled with cheap appliances that, if you're the initial tenant, may not have any issues, but even a place that has only been around a few years is going to show its age due to the sub par materials and equipment used.

3rd edit: also, anecdotally, the private owners aren't so much concerned about market value as much as just making the payment on their loan for the property.  Only once have I had an owner up the rate due to the fact that other properties were charging more in the area, and you know what?  I moved out and found a place that wasn't subject to such."

lansing,fe5xc4w,t3_encfmo,1578877037.0,At those prices and still paying for utilities why not just rent a house?  You're not on the hook for maintaining it and you get the whole thing to yourself and hey you may have a yard and don't have to answer to anyone but maybe some nag who thinks they own the neighborhood.
