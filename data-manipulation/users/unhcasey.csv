CapeCod,fedaiev,t1_febpnb2,1579005712.0,"Yes!  That was somewhere in Europe I believe.  The cellular company voluntarily shut down the tower but didn't inform the public about it.  At a town meeting, everyone showed up complaining that their symptoms had worsened since their last meeting at which point the cell company provided proof that they had turned it off immediately after the last meeting proving that it couldn't possibly have been the cell tower causing their ""symptoms."" <---read symptoms as psychosis."

Firefighting,fe9dza5,t1_fe8t3kp,1578936680.0,"It would be extremely uncommon for us to show up at a motor vehicle crash without cops already on scene but if we show up and they're not we'll absolutely shut the road down.  And our police work well with us so if we say ""close the road"" they will in an instant without asking questions.  I know some don't have that luxury but ours are quite professional."

Firefighting,fe7tx6g,t1_fe6t5cd,1578919204.0,What?  We have streets narrow enough that our mere presence would dictate that a street is ‚Äúclosed.‚Äù
Firefighting,fe5811r,t1_fe48h2a,1578866436.0,"We definitely have them we just don‚Äôt put them up for random people to use.  In most areas, if we shut a street down, there‚Äôs an easy way to get around by going around a block or something."

AskReddit,fe328z2,t1_fe2x8au,1578845228.0,Weird.  I'd much prefer to put the fire out.  Putting the fire out prevents further destruction to the body (and any other evidence inside the vehicle) and if I can't get the trunk open quickly (it isn't always easy though it may have been easier back in the 80's) the risk and danger for everyone around goes up.
AskReddit,fe2v4ku,t1_fe1xue6,1578843198.0,I mean...we do that anyways because we have to put the fire in the trunk out.  We also pop the hood but we‚Äôre not looking for bodies in there! üòú
Arkansas,fdxjeyi,t1_fdtxrmc,1578769246.0,Lol yeah I live near Boston and spent time back home in Arkansas last week. Arkansas has nothing on most metro areas when it comes to shit driving.

Firefighting,fclnvp3,t1_fclkizm,1577752210.0,"Long long ago, in the Land of Probie, I was assigned to HQ and the reserve ladder truck was an open cab truck older than I was by a fair amount.  One of my first shifts, that truck went into service because our tower ladder went out for some sort of malfunction.  Of course, this happened right before a major winter storm slammed us and I spent all night riding around town getting snowed on in that stupid open cab."
Firefighting,fclfiu6,t1_fclezkl,1577746606.0,Not in the winter you wouldn't! ;)
technology,fcgmur7,t1_fcglwon,1577641794.0,"I hear ya, I used to live down south and had little issue with it then.

There's some good YouTube videos where guys have done comparisons with some sealers, rubberized coatings, etc. and some of them do a good job while others do not.  Top that off with the fact that it can run several hundred dollars to do it yourself and even more to have it done professionally and I don't necessarily see the value.  In the future I just have to count on replacing vehicles every ten years or so."
technology,fcglyz0,t1_fcgiz0i,1577641566.0,"Well yeah but when it rains or snows every few days and there's residual salt on the roads nearly all winter it's damn near impossible to keep it completely off the undercarriage.  By contrast, we've had my wife's car for 8 years and there's VERY little rust/corrosion on the undercarriage and she drives about 4 times more miles every year than I do with my truck.  I think at that time (that truck was a 2009), during the Great Recession (2007-2009), some manufacturers were really cutting corners and not coating frames all that well.  I've read in some forums other owners who have had similar issues with trucks from the 2007-2011 time frame."
technology,fcgl62g,t1_fcgitff,1577641315.0,"I've read and heard very mixed reviews about them.  I bought the truck when it was already five years old so there was already some rust.  Sealing rust in isn't a good idea and sanding it all off would've been a nightmare.  Looking back, I should have washed it more regularly but I also expect a modern pickup truck chassis to last more than 10 winters."

technology,fcg15oz,t1_fcfybtc,1577635519.0,Last month my ten year old truck's frame literally snapped in half and was completely rusted through in several spots.  Crazy how quickly that shit destroys a solid metal chassis.
aww,fc6k4kz,t1_fc6jttw,1577482484.0,They used to but stopped doing it (which is why we never did my younger daughter at her one year checkup and had to get it done at the mall.) I‚Äôm assuming people probably complained and said it was barbaric or something so they stopped.  I don‚Äôt really recall what it was but it wasn‚Äôt a gun like at the mall.
funny,fc5kavv,t1_fc5fhi0,1577459897.0,Haha...I did that a couple months ago actually and she was soooooo confused by that.
aww,fc5b4or,t1_fc58vub,1577451793.0,We did our first daughter at one year old (the pediatrician did it and did a great job...took her time and did it properly) and she barely made a fuss.  Our second we did at the mall at around 3 years old because she asked for it and she made a huge fuss.  I wish we had done it younger because it is much easier.
funny,fc5ane2,t3_egajsr,1577451252.0,Ahhhhh....hahaha...we did the exact same thing!  My daughter goes ‚Äúwow I never knew paper was so heavy!!‚Äù
aww,fc5a3e0,t3_eg9fz7,1577450603.0,That one cat is kinda doofy looking but he‚Äôs got a cute seal pillow!
Arkansas,fc4lfot,t1_fc4j3mo,1577420141.0,Yeah but...you can be charged as an ‚Äúadult‚Äù for many crimes at ages as young as 12-13.  It‚Äôs not always as easy as just picking one age for everything.  You have to look at things like ‚Äúat what age do children know wrong from right‚Äù or ‚Äúat what age does the brain stop developing so as to make alcohol and tobacco consumption less detrimental.‚Äù  I agree this is a good thing.  It‚Äôs a huge health crisis that costs everyone both physically and financially.
