She was with her for four months. Then she came back to try to work things out. We lasted a month. Then broke up, she came back again and asked for forgiveness since she had cheated. Of course it didn’t work. After only five days of us not talking she posted pictures with her new gf. Some people can’t be alone it’s scary for them to be alone. The best thing you can do is take care of yourself and be alone. Learn to love yourself and then you can share that love with someone."

It’s not right for me to get someone involved at that level, at end we will both loose. I’m evolving mentally, physically and emotionally. I’m so blessed that I was given an opportunity to finally open my eyes and do the right thing for myself. It has not being easy, but it has being worth it. It’s amazing to love and care for yourself. You start seeing the world a different way. You radiate and everything looks so beautiful."
