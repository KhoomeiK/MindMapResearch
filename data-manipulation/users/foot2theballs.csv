GolfGTI,ffokoho,t1_ffl8jqj,1580078646.0,"Gotcha, thanks for the info! How do you mitigate undercarriage rust from road salt? If I’m honest, my car having any rust at all is one of the bigger things I’m worried about when thinking about moving there"

I’m considering a move to the PNW, but I’ve lived my whole life where it only rains if you really *believe* lol, so I don’t know how large an impact Seattle’s amount of rain would have"
GolfGTI,ffil7qy,t1_ffihevx,1579976535.0,"Good info to have! I’m planning on grabbing an aftermarket replica OEM knob and seeing if I can add weight to it, because that’s a lot of peoples’ only complaint about it-myself included. Would have been nice to have a weighted stock option instead of having to buy a new knob"

It’s on everyone’s minds because it’s tough to get away from hearing about. Prime example: Epstien.

GolfGTI,fffablu,t3_eta8cc,1579879555.0,"Interesting! I might have to see if there’s a trim piece like that for MK7-I kinda like it. I bought a Boomba knob recently and it’s...okay. It’s honestly too short for my tastes, so I put a 1/2 inch nylon spacer inside it to raise it up just a bit, and now the height and weight are pretty perfect imo! Still wish the delrin was grippier though."
GolfGTI,fff9tpf,t1_fff8ols,1579879232.0,"I mean, BFI sells a heavy knob that’s dimpled like the golf ball, but it’s pretty far from the stock look. Still though, if you like the golf ball look and want a heavier knob, that’s not a terrible way to go"

My guess would be something along the lines of eye-catching nails being in higher demand than things like sculptures, so they allow artists to more reliably make money while still allowing them to create"

LifeProTips,ff50x6l,t1_ff4rdka,1579577260.0,"Agreed! I’d rather have fewer friends that may as well be family than more friends that are closer to acquaintances, and I think a lot of introverts are similar. However, I read some of your other comments in this thread and I think ‘extroverted introvert’ might be the most accurate description I’ve heard for myself haha.  
  
Recently I’ve discovered your advice to always accept invitations myself, and I have to straight up convince myself to go sometimes, and even fight off the urge to make some excuse to not show up once I’ve already accepted. But once I get there and find my element, my pre-arrival jitters calm down and I become more myself, and more outgoing.  
  
The issue has always been keeping in contact with people because I feel like exchanging numbers with someone is weird if you’re not trying to date them or something. Which I know is completely untrue, but my neurotic brain tells me otherwise lol. I think your method probably leads to the most natural resolution though. All this is to say I’ll have to give it a shot the next time a blue moon rolls around and I’m actually invited to something with people I don’t know haha"

I’m the same way-I listen to a lot of different genres, but I’ve always been pretty picky with hip hop and rap, and Aesop Rock is my favorite. I’ve been listening to Windmills all morning and they quickly worked their way into my top few hip hop artists!  
  
Courtesy recommendation: Foreign Beggars  
   
They’re not really similar in style to any of the artists you mentioned, but their first couple albums are more of my favorite hip hop/rap"
