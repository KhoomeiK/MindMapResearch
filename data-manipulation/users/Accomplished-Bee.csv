In which case, I also wanted to mention some [interesting statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_among_LGBT_youth) about other factors which impact lgbtq suicide rates...

1) Researchers estimated approximately 130,000 fewer lgbtq people now commit suicide *each year* since same sex marriage was legalized in America.

2) One study found that schools without a GSA (gay-straight alliance) club had lgbtq suicide attempt rates of 33%, compared to 17% in schools with one.

3) 27% of black trans youth report having been sexually abused. 49% report having been homeless (5 times average). In a plurality of cases, because they have been kicked out by their families.

It seems to me that, if we are to consider being lgbtq a mental illness, then empirically, the best treatment for said illness is loud and clear acceptance by society. Which to my knowledge sets it apart from any other mental illness I know. Not being assaulted and disowned by one's family also probably helps. And last but not least, do please consider that gender confirmation surgery also [reduces suicide risk](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/sex-reassignment-surgery-yields-long-term-mental-health-benefits-study-n1079911).

In which case, if we're still going to call it one, we have at the very least *seriously* blurred the lines about the meaning of ""mental illness,"" no?

Edit: even more revealing, look at the effects that a [highly stigmatizing culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_ideation_in_South_Korean_LGBT_youth) has on suicide rates. There we see an attempt rate among lesbian and bisexual high school students of **47%**! I've been to a pride parade in Seoul. People had to wear masks. The cure for alternative sexualities is... acceptance.

Edit 2: Something else that lowers suicide rates? Those super controversial (but cheap, effective, and reversible) [puberty pausing therapies](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/23/health/transgender-puberty-blockers-suicide-study/index.html) for transgender minors."

pussypassdenied,ffccuwi,t1_ffc5v0l,1579796709.0,"Let's do this then.

First, although it's a distraction, yes, left-handedness is linked to higher rates of mental illness such as [schizophrenis](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-are-left-handedness-and-psychosis-linked-110713#3) and [PTSD](https://www.healthline.com/health/left-handers-and-health-risk#psychotic-disorders), and left-handed people overall [die younger](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/04/us/being-left-handed-may-be-dangerous-to-life-study-says.html) than right handed people. I did spend some time looking for statistics on suicide specifically, but I just could not find any. I doubt the study has been done. There's a topic for your thesis.

Of course, statistics are harder to find for other groups I mentioned such as atheists in Saudi Arabia (less suicide, sure, but only because the government does the job for you). Atheists overall have a [higher suicide rate](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.161.12.2303). Is atheism mental illness? Interestingly, in antebellum American South, black slaves were estimated to have *lower* [suicide rates](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247871044_Suicidal_Behavior_In_African-American_Slaves/link/5b14059c0f7e9b498108a41d/download) than whites at the time. Was being a slave a sign of mental... health? Of course, there were the deterrents to suicide put in place by the masters. Mutilation of corpses, threat of torturing survivors, religious injunctions, etc. Had to protect their property. Valuable investments.

Here's a much more interesting topic though. Let's ignore trans people for a moment and drop the T from LGBT. What are the suicide risks just among the lesbian, gay, and bisexual people? If we look at [high school students](http://www.sprc.org/sites/default/files/migrate/library/SPRC_LGBT_Youth.pdf), one study found that in gay or bi males, 28% had attempted suicide, compared to 4% of the heterosexual male population. While that is a striking example showing this particular group to be 7 times likelier to attempt suicide, the overall averages from this literature review showed the risk in LGB subjects to be about 3-4 times the risk of hetero subjects. For comparison, trans people are at about 4-5 times the risk of hetero subjects. Not really all that different, and when you think about it, gay and lesbian people usually get the privilege of hiding their orientation when they don't want to show it. Trans people are not always so lucky. Many wear their unwanted gender history for all the world to see and mock.

So I bring all this up to get you on record: gay and lesbian people clearly attempt suicide at greater rates than the general population. If elevated suicide risk is a sign of transgenderism being mental illness, then does this evidence that being gay or lesbian also raises suicide risk mean that being gay or lesbian is also mental illness? If no, why not? And why stop there? Veterans are at about twice the rate of the general population for suicide risk. Are people who choose to join the military mentally ill? If you can reconcile all these beliefs without tying yourself into knots of logical fallacy or resorting to full-on hetero supremacy, I'll be shocked and impressed. I'll gild you. I'll eat my hat. Please do so.

But you won't. You'll say something about how this post was too long to read and that I put too much effort into writing this, while you were just here for the lulz, so fuck me, right?

UpliftingNews,fe98fcl,t1_fe951rx,1578935326.0,"This is not politics. This is medicine. I'm glad their family is lovely, but the kid is going to have a hard life (do you disagree?), and oblivion in contrast doesn't hurt. From a bioethical as well as a medico-legal perspective, it is objectively correct that the doctors made the right recommendation during the pregnancy. Which is why they made that recommendation, irrespective of their own political stances.

More importantly, the treatment in Australia is clearly quackery. If you really do know the family, please let them know there is no solid evidential basis for these therapies. Look at the search results on Google Scholar for [Ken Ware's Neurophysics Therapy](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C38&q=%22neurophysics+therapy%22&btnG=). The only publications on the subject are authored by Ken Ware himself, alongside one other article summarizing the research done by Ware and concluding that the [evidence is anecdotal and limited](https://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/106108/atterbury_therapeutic_2019.pdf?sequence=1). It's probably not any better than established therapies closer to home, and almost certainly more expensive (for travel costs alone, if they are traveling from England to Australia). Long way to go for snake oil..."
UpliftingNews,fe7h0k3,t3_enx6zs,1578914409.0,"If his goal is ""learning to walk,"" then I seriously doubt he is ""learning to surf"" in any more meaningful sense than somebody hooked him up to ""specialized automated wave movement equipment.""

Great for the kid, but everything in that article seems to be about smugly ""proving the doctors wrong"" since the parents were older, and told that the kid would likely have developmental problems, and now that he does, they desperately need a way not to feel guilty for insisting on carrying a risky pregnancy to term (""I think possibly if younger people were offered that choice, they may have felt pressured into taking it. Because we’re older parents, we know our own minds and we’re positive people. We wanted to give Noah the chance of life.""). But that kind of denial and ego defense in the parents will lead to a lot of suffering on the kid's part, since his disabilities may have been better than expected prenatally, but [spina bifida](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spina_bifida) is still no walk in the park, and he undeniably still has that condition, and probably more complications, many of which like academic difficulties not present until he is older (and his older parents are dead and unable to help), despite their insistence that the 6 year old is ""bright as a button"" (which is easy to claim before children get to school).

They are also relying on a ""radical"" Australian therapy that the providers didn't even want to give because he is too young, so they needed to be ""persuaded"" to allow the boy to begin ""preparing"" for the therapy ""when he is old enough,"" a therapy which is not evidence based, created by and uniquely practiced by this one guy in Australia, and whose claims are ludicrous at face value (literally the first paragraph on [their website](https://www.neurophysicstherapy.global/) reads ""It’s a method of advanced training and rehabilitation that helps 100% of people 100% of the time without discrimination and at the most fundamental level of the human system."" You can't fucking help 100% of the people 100% of the time, Ken.).

This news isn't uplifting. It's just denial of reality. This is arguably a miracle relative to the worst-case scenario, but it is much, much worse than normal. In short, the doctors were correct to make the recommendation to abort, even knowing what we know now 7 years later."
