startrek,fe5d2l4,t1_fe5akzu,1578867878.0,"True, most of what I wrote had to do with the entire universe as presented in the show. TNG and even TOS gave us a universe filled with wildly different species--DS9 concentrated on humanoid species that stood in for human issues and, as I said, seemed to be stuck in the kind of interactions that we would have recognized in the 1990s. But yes, I do think Section 31 was meant to be, not a rogue element, but a part of the Federation. (As to the Farengi, just google--lots of critics have made the comparison. YMMV.) The thing about DS9 for me was that it didn't feel enough like the future. So the message I read was--some things just don't change."
startrek,fe56xwo,t1_fe55xdc,1578866176.0,The Federation harbored a CIA-like agency that treated civil liberties as a joke. Vulcans were murderers for ridiculous reasons. Every society other than the Federation was warlike and authoritarian.  The Farengi were a compendium of anti-Semitic tropes. All that advanced technology and most species behaved as though they were living in Game of Thrones times.
startrek,fe555wp,t1_fe54ba4,1578865744.0,"DS9 was pessimistic in that it rejected the possibility that societies can actually transform for the better---that eliminating scarcity with matter/energy conversion would necessarily change the way that society is structured and the ways that people treat one another.

startrek,fe4usft,t1_fe4u21y,1578862998.0,"Nah, not for me. The issue was the reactionary world view. Odd, because in a few episodes, the ones in which Cisco fell into the body of a Black science fiction writer in the 1950s, they offered one of the best critiques of racism to be found in any Star Trek--and we finally had a Black captain. But then, that Gen X conservatism posing as subversion would come right back, even having Cisco's partner criticizing him for not enjoying old school crap from racist eras on the holodeck."

Also---it reflected, again, just in my opinion, the USA's self image projected through the Federation--the Fed was the only attempt at democracy, every other formation was some kind of authoritarian or monarchic society, which makes little sense given that the Klingons, the Romulans, and even the Dominion were as advanced technically as the Federation, which means they too could have built post-scarcity cultures that did not require rigid hierarchies.

Judaism,fe4iivx,t3_enpa1q,1578859671.0,"Congratulations on beginning your Jewish journey! I don't mean to be cringey--you are in a tough spot because of the isolation. Thank God for the internet! You are always welcome here and it's a place to learn--I believe that there is now a study thread reading a book by Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel--always an inspiring place to start if it's the spirituality of Judaism that is drawing you in.

I suggest that you ask yourself what, in particular, is calling to you about Judaism and start learning about those things. There are FB groups of people who learn or who start discussions about Jewish topics. People have made friends that way. Also--you might travel! You don't say where you are in Europe--I know that in Paris and London you will find a variety of Jewish shuls, from Orthodox to Masorti to Reform to none of the above and also a variety of social groups with diverse Jewish cultures and, if it interests you, political leanings.

There are so many websites that offer teachings about the weekly Torah portion (in whatever language you are comfortable with), Daf Yomi (the daily Talmud page) and Jewish topics in general. Again, in several denominations and with many perspectives. You might find that some rabbis and teachers really speak to you. Perhaps you could write to them?

Also, you're internal life can be as private as you want it to be for now. If you are not ready to share with your family yet, you don't have to. This can be between you and HaShem and a chosen community.

Again, welcome and Mazel Tov."

IMHO, the interesting thing about TNG was the premise that ""human nature"" as we understand it would change radically in a post-scarcity society.

Down with the Seleucid imperialists and all their running dogs!"
