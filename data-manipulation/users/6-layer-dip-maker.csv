Neid reegleid ära nii üks ühele võta. Esimesed kolm kuud oled sa seal SITATÜKK ja sind tambitakse igast otsast. Reeglid keeratakse sinu vastu ja üldine reegel on: ""kui mingi asi pole ekstra lubatud, siis see on keelatud.""

europe,fcfl09f,t3_eh5rz3,1577631137.0,"TL;DR; One wrong turn on the mountain with a snowboard followed by 320km of car ride to rescue friends.

2016 we went snowboarding in Tatras. There was a ""free ride zone"" (snow powder zone) and we mostly rode that part of the mountain. Then some of my friends went too far to the right and end up on other side of the mountain somehow.

Asap we didn't meet near the lifts, I knew that something was wrong. All their mobiles were ""out of range"" and I kept calling my friends number for about 1.5 hours repeatedly. At last I got connected trough somehow but by the time, it was already getting dark outside.

So after we connected, I beg them for GPS coordinates(mate didn't know you could access GPS without internet connection), and to stay near where they were. We had to ride 160km to the other side of the mountain. By then it was pitch black outside, couldn't see even a meter in front of you in the woods. No cars had been on the path, where we had to ride, for ages.

In the end we parked our vehicle at some random roadside nearest to the GPS coordinates they sent us, sent them our coordinates and waited there. After about 30 minutes we saw phone flashlights from a couple hundred meters away i guess ( lights were pointed at the sky somewhy). This was the most relieved I've ever felt in my life, that my friends were OK and safe."
