malaysia,fejg4x8,t1_fejeyj4,1579172629.0,">My Lai massacre was covered up at every level by the US government.

From the link you provided.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My\_Lai\_Massacre#Reporting,\_cover-up\_and\_investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre#Reporting,_cover-up_and_investigation)

It was being investigated and discussed by congress and even had wide coverage on US news. Everyone knows there were atrocities commited despite the government trying to cover it up.

So what about China. Where are China's investigation or their journalist covering atrocities commited by their government? Nope, nothing at all. Anyone dare to imply that gets sent to detention camps.

You keep implying that I claim the 'US is the good guy'. I have never said that, it is all your own strawman. The US is not the good guy but neither is China.

Look at it this way, among all the replies I've had with you, I have not once even disagree that US committed atrocities.

What about you? Have I heard you said anything negative about China at all? Nope, 0, zilch.

So who is getting influenced by whose propaganda here? Me by the US or you by China? I can call out US on their bullshit and still recognize they are no threat to any form of Malaysia's sovereignty right now. But you have done nothing but respond as a Pro-China sympathizer."

Nobody is saying the USA didn't commit any atrocities in Vietnam, that's just a strawman placed by you. Everything had been declassified by the US government.

China on the other hand, they did nothing but wonderful things like providing training to the Uigyur people and comfortable camps they can live in and having nothing significant happen on July of  1989, no massacre of sorts.

At least USA came clean with the horrible shit they did but China just sweep everything under the rug. Are you telling me not to worry about the country that hides all their atrocities?"
malaysia,fejdvl7,t1_fejd9ew,1579169246.0,">South Vietnamese government was a puppet government propped up by the US

If you could make sure false claim like that, anyone can say that the North Vietnamese were also puppets of China and the USSR.

>It collapsed like paper after the US withdraw.

Because the USA withdrew support but China and the USSR was still supporting the North Vietnamese?

&#x200B;

>US involvement in Vietnam is one of the biggest mistake by US.

You even changed your wording from invasion to 'involvement'

Again nothing you said suggest that the USA invaded Vietnam, they even withdraw their support after facing congressional/populace backlash at home. Can you imagine China pulling out from the Spratly Islands because their congress (oh wait they dont have one) or people (if they even dare to protest against the CCP) told them to do so?

Again are you telling me we should be more afraid of the USA than China right now?

&#x200B;

>Even the US military admitted they had no business being in Vietnam.

Will China admit they have no business claiming the Spratly Islands as well?

If the USA can own up to it and by your claims, they are the one we should fear more, would China do the same?"

Because they didn't? The US was supporting the South Vietnamese forces whereas China was supporting the North Vietnamese Communists, similar to the circumstances of the Korean War.

But nobody goes around saying, ''The US invaded Korea'' like what you're pulling. 

Using the same logic, doesn't that mean China invaded Vietnam as well since they were supporting the North Vietnamese."
malaysia,fejc9wv,t1_fejbm9b,1579166811.0,">Clearly it doesn't hold ground that US is after oil and will go after the top oil producing countries.

Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada and China are a few of the top oil producing countries, yet the USA didn't invade them. Afghanistan has less oil than Malaysia

&#x200B;

>Its been years since those islands were built. I don't see any military action.

The USA have tons of military bases all over the world that doesn't see much action. That doesn't mean it isn't there for a purpose. China is doing what every other military nation did when they want to claim stake to an area; send your troops/ set up military bases in that area.

&#x200B;

>No navy how to contest anything? Use mouth to contest? Don't say China, you think the rest of South East Asia all buddy with us?

So you're implying the only way to contest dispute is through military force? Guess you have learnt nothing over the decades of wars. Why even have the UN, lets regress back to the early 1900 where every country use military might to take things from other countries."
malaysia,fejb921,t1_fejabbr,1579165273.0,">US would invade and kill us all if we had enough oil

As a recurring joke, this statement is bearable but as a fact, it doesn't hold ground.

&#x200B;

>The only reason they left us alone is because we are insignificant to them.

So basically you're enforcing what OP is saying. If US is leaving us alone because we are insignificant, then why should we be worrying about them more than China?

But again this statement isn't grounded in facts because [the US is investing in Malaysia, more than China is recent year](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/11/29/chinese-investments-in-malaysia-halve-us-inflow-soars/1814558)

&#x200B;

>We should be distrustful of them because of some claims on the South China Sea?

Some claims? They're literally building artificial islands to use as military bases to enforce their stake in the claims.

&#x200B;

>We have a barely functioning Navy and you think we can contest South China Sea.

I don't see how this is even a valid point. If we didn't have a land army or an airforce, should we also give up our claims to our lands and skies?"
malaysia,fej8scl,t1_feiv0on,1579161826.0,">In Brazil, an overwhelmingly Christian country, their supreme court just ruled that Netflix can continue to stream a locally produced ""Gay Jesus"" comedy film.

Supreme court =/= the people, they aren't even an elected position so they do not define the general populace. There were a lot of outraged Brazillians over the release of the film.

EDIT: To clarify, this isn't an argument that Brazil isn't as secular as you claimed, my point was to show that the supreme court will follow the rule of the law and does not depict what the general populace interests are. Even if the majority of people wants the film banned (petitions are not a good metric), the job of the highest court is to make sure the law prevails. 

Malaysia do have freedom of speech but has a provision in Article 10 which state;

>such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of the Federation or any part thereof, or public order;

And if I'm reading your implication correctly, that heads will roll if a Gay Muhammad movie is allowed to be shown, then it won't be allowed because by the interest of the security and public order, the film will be banned, not because the Supreme court judges are not secular, but because the law states as such."
