I'm not arguing that billion dollar companies can't afford to pay more. But then again, you're very much just oversimplifying the issue. How do you know what the profitability margins are for every company?

And if you have a problem with the ultra wealthy then fine. But don't blame capitalism. There are ultra wealthy in socialist and communist countries as well. The difference is that it's much more worse off in non capitalist countries with much less social mobility."
