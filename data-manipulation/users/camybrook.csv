- Miley (for my love of Miley Cyrus of course)
- mocha (my favorite coffee order)
- coffee (duh?)
- yoshi 

Maybe I should say screw it and get 4 because I can’t choose between these names"
NoStupidQuestions,ffcwwi2,t3_esyam1,1579808967.0,I would definitely be showering every 1-2 *days*. Months  is not healthy. I’ll go a few days not showering but that makes me feel gross. Also I do laundry 1-2 times a week which is normal as well. Every 1-2 months is not good.

relationship_advice,ff3vlij,t3_eri8s9,1579549812.0,"Wow I’m so sorry to hear this. I hope you can go seek medical help to see about this certain issue and if there’s a resolution.

If not, I’m not saying “fake it till ya make it” but sex isnt all about pleasure. It’s a time to be close to your partner and connect that way. I am so sorry you can’t feel anything, but sex with him can be a way for you to connect with him better. It’s okay for him to be the only one feeling pleasure. But you need to talk to him about how you can’t moan or react if you can’t feel it. But you can’t be just a rag doll laying there while he does the work. 

I hope there’s someone else who is in a similar situation to help you, but pleasure him the way you would even though you can’t feel it. 

I would also seek a therapist. This can’t be easy for you and I’m so sorry."

When researching about if it raises glucose (I was interested because of dieting) there was no evidence saying it rose blood glucose significantly."
