BlackPeopleTwitter,fe0bk9q,t1_fe0bdsi,1578808794.0,I saw a pic post a few days ago of a British tabloid criticizing Meghan for “holding her baby bump” and then compared it to the same tabloid praising kate for doing the same thing a few years earlier. I’d GTFO to Canada too lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe0b9go,t3_enizhc,1578808501.0,"American here. Didn’t realize how dragged through the mud Meghan got from the British press. American press love her. Makes me sad, she seems nice and like a genuinely good person. She does all the same stuff as kate and kate is praised and she is hated? Wow. Just let this family live in peace. They aren’t in super direct line for the throne anymore just let them live"

dogs,fcy3lq2,t3_ejdvsq,1578074327.0,"Are you getting the puppy for him to have a friend? Make sure that having two dogs is really what YOU as the owner want. It really doesn’t make that big a difference for the dog (unless they are a bonded pair). Having one dog with a calm owner is better for the dog than having a stressed out owner and a “dog friend”. Two dogs are ALOT more work. 

Whatever you decide - congrats on your new dog! I second the 2 week shutdown - I did that with my pup when I adopted her. I didn’t do the “leashing to me” thing because I didn’t even know about that - just didn’t have any visitors etc for two weeks to really let her bond to me. No dog parks, etc."

dogs,fckftbn,t1_fckfgrp,1577724370.0,Oh I see them listed on a graph. I feed my dog “the honest kitchen” clusters. It’s grain free but I don’t see it on this list.

dogs,fcgcl75,t3_eh4web,1577638648.0,Are lavender and peppermint safe? My sister got me a diffuser for Xmas and I have a dog. The peppermint helps my migraines.
dogs,fc08j9u,t3_efftn1,1577282982.0,Base of tail means fleas usually. My dog has several allergies and the only time she has really bit the base of her tail was during flea season when her flea collar wore off
