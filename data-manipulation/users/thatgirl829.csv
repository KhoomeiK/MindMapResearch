I did something similar for a customer a few years ago.  They were getting a delivery, but when the delivery team showed up, they realized they didn't have the right products.  I got a call from the customer and realized they were 10 miles from me and I had the product they needed in the shop.  I called a DM (not mine) and got approval to close up shop for 30 minutes to personally deliver this product to the customer.  When my DM found out, he was livid and wrote me up saying that 'we just don't do that here.'  Like I'm sorry, I thought we wanted to build solid, happy customer relationships.  My bad."

This guy is screwing himself out of money by making his deposits so low.  A 5-6 hour sitting at our shop is $500.  That way, if the client bails for some reason, the artist isn't out a $700, they're only out $200.

Obviously she sucks for not reading the rules you sent to her before hand, but customer's do that with everything, I bet even you have signed something without reading all the TOC before hand.  Her reaction was over the top and definitely earned herself an asshole judgement.

But you are the asshole too.  If I've learned anything from where I work, it's that when you're planning an all day/multi-day sitting, you meet with the client before hand.  You take a look IN PERSON at the area that you are going to be working with.  Photos are terrible.  They can't always accurately show the area you're working with and sometimes (like in the case of this client, where she has scars she's self-conscious of) can hide very important things you need to know before hand.  Not to mention this first face-to-face meeting is a good way to find out if you have a compatible working relationship.  Too many times, we've gotten clients into our shop asking us to finish up half done designs they have because they just didn't ""vibe"" with the artist that started it."

There could be any number of things mental issues with your sister that is causing this behavior that literally no one is dealing with, especially if she wanted to keep the baby to begin with.  What you did wouldn't have helped those issues and might have made them worse.  It may have been truthful, but it was cruel.

Did your sister even want the child to begin with?  Because the events that you describe happening, it sounds like she didn't want the kid and was kind of pressured into it by your parents.  Why else would they keep the baby home with them when she went off to college?  Since you don't describe what happened when your sister informed her parents, my guess is that you either know and don't want to add it or you really don't know at all what happened when she told them."
