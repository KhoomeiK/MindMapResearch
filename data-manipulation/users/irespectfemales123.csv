I simply cannot NOT iron EVERYTHING as soon as it's dry, and I don't even own a suit. Wrinkles look bad."

Depending on where you live you should be able to pick up two of them in used game stores, and eBay the other one.

Games,ffd305b,t1_ffczwi4,1579812412.0,"That's my thought too -- if you have PC hardware and want to play video games on a regular basis, just fucking install Windows 10. It takes like 20 minutes."

PS4,ff5odxy,t1_ff4vdsb,1579603137.0,"I don't think OP hasn't played much, which is fine and I understand, but earning stuff is absolutely not an issue in this game.

I had 40 Gold when I logged in for the first time around 6 months ago. Bought that Outlaw Pass with it (not real money), from there you earn stuff very quickly and never really have to pay for fast travel.

I'm basically done with Online now because I have everything you can earn, and have only been playing for about 3-4 *weeks*. Plenty of games out there which want you to spend real money -- I'd say this isn't one of them.

I do agree, though, that **PvP is abysmal**. Slow animations and character movement don't do you any favours here."

I found someone selling a sealed Canadian copy of the trilogy for £20 and snapped that up last year because I much prefer the packaging on it instead of just 3 boxes in a cardboard sleeve.

You don't need the Outlaw Pass to get any trophies.

Yes, it boosts your XP gain and just grants you lots of useful items to help you progress."
Trophies,fehlcqb,t1_fehj7kn,1579118883.0,"It's like the games ['Battle Pass' system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_pass) -- An in-game ""membership"" you can purchase with either real $$$ or in-game gold, and it unlocks additional rewards and items as you level up. Some of the most useful items are in-game vouchers which grant you something like 1000 XP, or 5 gold bars, or free fast travel, or 50% of any horse, etc...

You also get 'parcels' which contain loads of ammo, consumables, and sometimes collectibles.

It costs 40 Gold Bars, can be bought at any time, has 100 ranks to progress through, and all of the items unlock retroactively (so if you're already level 30 you will unlock everything in the Outlaw Pass up to level 30)."
