offmychest,ffcla5r,t1_ffc5a2h,1579801866.0,"Truly one of the few times Reddit is a disappointment is when these types slither out if the woodwork to defend the poor helpless pedophiles. I'm not crossing that line. I have four children including two daughters and two sons and my biggest concern for them in this world? Pedophiles. Pedophiles should all be dead. They are an abomination and the embodiment of evil. You're not changing my mind with ""they can't help it. You're hurting their poor feelings."" Forget that."
offmychest,ffcjj6q,t1_ffciaqa,1579800807.0,"This is exactly how it starts. Every. Single. Time.  I'm not having this conversation with you. I feel no empathy for pedophiles. Just like I feel no empathy for people who beat dogs or murder people. If they don't act on their urges, are they really pedophiles? If they recognize the disgusting and vile nature of their desires and seek professional mental help instead of satiation are they really pedophiles? Pedophiles are vile and their acts are vile and every one of them should be dead. The consequences of their actions are life long (possibly generational) and a perversion of everything good in this world. And nobody's sexual kinks is worth an iota of that."
relationship_advice,ffc7pu8,t3_esha56,1579793460.0,"Is there a number you can call in your state for children possibly in danger? In Colorado we have Safe to Tell. You don't have to decide if there's abuse, just suspect it. She's messing this kid up for life. Making him take her nude pics and being hyper sexual in front of and with her newly pubescent son is gross and disturbing. At least call and let someone else look into to make sure he's okay. Maybe they can say to her face why her behavior is so wrong and maybe she'll listen.  It's anonymous to call those types of numbers so she won't know it was you. Please help that kid."
relationship_advice,ffc6osa,t3_esnt01,1579792791.0,Yes. Immediately.

He treats you like shit. He lies about random stuff so accuses you of lying about random stuff. When he's mad he attacks you and treats you like shit. He's a bad boyfriend, period. Like, not a good person. 

You can do better. Seriously, there are men out there who would cherish you and have compassion for your body's issues and show patience. Look for one of those. Lose the dick weezle."
toastme,ffc5upu,t3_ess6sv,1579792235.0,"There's nothing wrong with getting help when everything is going wrong inside. Talk to a doctor, try for help. Your kiddos need you. And if you give up then they've lost you and that's forever. I know how you feel. I'm just on the other side. And I'm telling you that you CAN sing flesh back onto the bones and heal. You don't have to suffer. Life can give a smile, just ask for help."
bulletjournal,ffc5lgp,t3_esqb4t,1579792062.0,"I've considered doing the same. I have some trackers I love to use but don't have the time or will to recreate them monthly. A binder would allow me to produce better quality trackers on a computer more quickly, leaving more time for the journaling. Keep us up to date on how it works out for you. Would love to hear."
offmychest,ffc5a2h,t3_esswv6,1579791850.0,"Death to all pedophiles. I've said it before and will say it again. Every time I've said it here on Reddit I've been downvoted and slammed because ""not all pedos act on their impulses"" or ""they're misunderstood"" or ""it's a fetish"". Um, no. They're baby rapers. They are disgusting, mentally ill, disgusting animals who put their sexual kicks over a child's entire life and wellbeing (because the effects are truly that awful). The world would be better off without that perversion. Death to all pedophiles."
relationship_advice,ffc466u,t3_escy8d,1579791098.0,"I've been in your shoes, and felt for your pain. The emotional/mental fallout from my husband's cheating was worse than my mother's death. Her passing was awful and unfortunate. His actions were a conscious choice and betrayal. Your boyfriend didn't forget you existed or your relationship, he chose her over you in that instant. As someone who stayed in the relationship after infidelity (we have young kids) my advice would be to leave. No man is worth the mental gymnastics you're going to have to pull off to stay with him, rebuild trust, not drowning under the constant second guessing over everything he says and does from now until infinity, and not lose yourself under the strain of coming to terms with what he did. You're not married and haven't mentioned kids. You're worth finding a better man who will never choose someone over you. There are an amazing amount of good men out there who will cherish you. Leave that boy to his overpriced whores and live your best life."
history,fev44my,t3_eqg798,1579392927.0,"Leonardo DaVinci was an artist, architect, engineer and more. I'm curious how he financially sustained his lifestyle so that he was free enough to create and explore as much as he did. Was he born of nobility? Did he inherit wealth and didn't need a day job? Did he work days and draw/paint/build during the nights? Was his world more friendly toward the arts and he enjoyed the patronage of a king? What sort of existence did he live on a day-to-day level that allowed him to reach such creative and constructive heights? Any insight?"

needadvice,fetluvq,t3_eqjn3r,1579376731.0,"Growth mindset. Don't feel like you can't ever be good at something just because you aren't right now. Take this as a moment to pause and reinvest in training and education. Even the best dog behavioralists had to start somewhere. If this is what you love doing, keep doing it with a mindset to learn more and do better. And just be grateful for the injection of reality into your situation now before you got hurt or got someone else hurt. Then pick yourself up and carry on. Ever upward!"
AskWomen,fencm4i,t3_eps958,1579281817.0,"I haven't. We were so poor growing up that my brother and I would mob the grocery bags when there were some and hide cans of soup. We didn't  know the next time we'd have food. To this day I have an unhealthy relationship with food. I feel panicked when I'm hungry and overeat. I've been trying intermittent fasting to try to get to a healthy weight and it makes me panic. I hope I figure it out someday, and in the meantime encourage a much healthier relationship with my kids and their food and pray they never have to deal with the stuff I've been through."
AskReddit,fel2oj4,t3_epis01,1579212754.0,"After they were born one of the boys had to be on oxygen for the first two months. One day during that time I was fiddling on my computer and it was their naptime. One of the boys woke up so I picked him up and put the oxygen back on him for him to sleep. He was unusually fussy but soon fell back to sleep. After nap time I realized I had put the oxygen on the wrong baby. I have no idea how. Why was the oxygen off his brother in the first place? This was almost 12 years ago. I have no idea. Those sticky pads were a pain, so maybe he pushed it off when I wasn't looking and so it was just laying between them? I honestly don't know. I chalk it up to new mother/exhaustion/twin chaos. But it would explain why he fussed so much about the oxygen when I put it on him. It wasn't his!"

And they make fun of your clothes? Even if they were dipped in gold would they not be worth your time or effort.

Take a deep breath and cut the toxic fake friends out of your life and promise yourself you'll find good, real, 3am friends (the kind you can call at 3am in trouble and they're there) soon. Find YOUR people, not these rude ones. You're worth so much better."

It's up to you to stay or leave but as someone who chose to stay in a situation similar to yours my advice would be to run. No man is worth what you've been through, are going through and will go through. The ocean is vast and deep and there are men out there who will CHERISH you without compromise. I'm sorry this happened to you."
