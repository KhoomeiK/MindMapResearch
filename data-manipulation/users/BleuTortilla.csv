quityourbullshit,fguptdg,t1_fguotbu,1581126632.0,Show me some math then. It will float. Hell a glass bottle will float if it's closed. Not all kayak designs will float but I can guarantee some of them would.
quityourbullshit,fguo18h,t1_fgumyee,1581125469.0,Fill up your sink and put in a bowl or cup right side up. It will probably somewhat float. You could for sure make a glass kayak float. Still a bad idea but not because glass doesn’t float.
quityourbullshit,fgunsz7,t1_fgul14j,1581125326.0,It does when the volume of air inside it brings the average density up above that of water.
quityourbullshit,fguazdc,t1_fgu9pnl,1581116470.0,"I mean dipshit as in they’d make it then actually try and use it and cause environment and personal damage when it inevitably breaks. Dumb idea period. If it was an artistic thing like what you see in Dave Chihuly or others work, that’s different."
quityourbullshit,fgtvmgx,t1_fgtqbls,1581109915.0,Most of them are a lexan type material. It’s almost as clear as glass and super strong. I’m sure some dipshit out there made a real glass one at some point.
FunnyandSad,fgrhapx,t1_fgr11d6,1581046797.0,"Depends on the district, school starts as early as the first week in august in some places."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgqfjc4,t1_fgpcyjg,1581023202.0,"We showered at my high school in Florida, but we were a little more athletic based than most. I don’t think I could make myself go to class without taking a shower after PE. This wasn’t until high school though"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgonta0,t1_fgomgw7,1580977737.0,"It's not elevate, but a similar company. The interest ends up somewhere north of the 200% range and is compounded daily. Then there are fees that are close in price to the interest rates so it's more like 400% when you add that in."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fgoiuo4,t1_fgo2liw,1580971580.0,"What's even worse are these ""flex"" loans that aren't as high interest so they don't seem as bad, but they essentially look at your income and charge you enough interest where you can pay the minimum but can't ever pay off the full amount. I unfortunately fell into getting one during some tough times last year and haven't been able to pay it off. Thankfully I'm about to after my tax return, but I've paid more than 10x what I borrowed originally.  It's crazy."
personalfinance,fggkdm4,t3_ey8l7i,1580763687.0,I used credit karma tax after TurboTax told me I had to pay 40 so I could get an 8 dollar credit for my retirement savings.
insaneparents,fgdj1y3,t1_fgd3yib,1580682986.0,"Acetate is in many different things and isn’t necessarily a bad thing, assuming it’s been approved for food use. It’s often used in flavorings and fragrances in tons of food. However just straight ingesting food safe essential oils is still a bad idea in the same way that drinking an 8oz cup of 190 proof uncut grain alcohol can be terrible for you. Just because you can doesn’t mean there aren’t side affects. EO’s can often burn or damage tissue, some even reduce the skins ability to block UV rays and will cause sunburn. So in conclusion fuck Essential Oils."
ProRevenge,fgbfbcm,t1_fg9sgx4,1580661484.0,Things like that are still covered under HIPPA. Your buying gum with a prescription at your local pharmacy is protected info under hippa because it’s associated. Visitors to the clinic regardless of reason are protected.
DiWHY,fg8xks9,t1_fg8vh1z,1580631172.0,"Thanks, I actually really enjoy hunting, I just don’t have the time/land to do it. I’m morally opposed to plantation style hunting, but true wild hunting for personal use is fine with me. Im mostly vegetarian at this point and working towards being as vegan as possible for environmental and moral reasons."
DiWHY,fg8uj1p,t1_fg8i17j,1580629853.0,I like to ask my hunter/redneck friends to gift me any excess skin and bones from their kills to use for various things. I once wrapped a snare drum using tanned deer skin.
agedlikemilk,fg8nw6c,t1_fg8ek85,1580625938.0,"Twin cam means it has 2 cam shafts to operate the valves, sometimes they’re variable. 16 valves means it has 4 valves per cylinder to let air and fuel in and exhaust out. More valves means you can move more air which means you can theoretically make more power."
PublicFreakout,fg7fbqx,t1_fg73gjb,1580591123.0,Sentencing isn’t supposed to be about retributive punishment. This will blow Reddit’s minds but the point of our justice system is supposed to be rehabilitation not retribution. Though the execution of that idea is shoddy. Hopefully that time spent in jail will have an effect of their psyche and will change for the better. Taking their life away won’t bring back the one they took.
BrandNewSentence,fg5tnek,t1_fg5q2yc,1580538449.0,"I read the opposite. I head the more southern/southwestern accent is like British, whereas the Appalachian one is more specific to the Irish/Scottish ancestors of the people that moved there. I’ll have to look into that and see if I can find the paper I read.

Edit: oh never mind, looks like the current southern accent is considered an offshoot of the Appalachian, and the Appalachian is a mix of the old British and Scottish accents."
WTF,fg5pw28,t1_fg40fh8,1580534639.0,Maybe not as much as you think. It’s providing some lift. I wonder what the net effect is.
todayilearned,fg5kjv5,t1_fg5c9je,1580530010.0,I may look into that. I honestly didn’t even think of that.
BrandNewSentence,fg5a2w1,t1_fg53hqr,1580522103.0,I always heard it as the American Southern accent is more closely related to the British accent of revolutionary times than the current British accent is.
todayilearned,fg59t7z,t1_fg56m7w,1580521906.0,I don’t know how to explain that. It’s something to do with the sentence structure. Every sentence reads as a declaration of a matter of fact. Seems like most of those sentences could be combined to make a more concise and clear article. It’s more like a list of facts than an encyclopedic entry.
TopMindsOfReddit,fg56tma,t1_fg3odi6,1580519715.0,"Could be referencing Greek mythology directly, but I doubt any of them have read more than a sparks notes on Greek history for dummies."
mechanical_gifs,fg2oft8,t1_fg2m602,1580449879.0,Heat sink is just put on something to give it more surface area to dissipate heat. Radiators use fluids to dissipate that heat remotely. Sometimes radiators are also used in reverse to warm things up like living spaces.
trippinthroughtime,fg2o954,t1_fg1x5sy,1580449703.0,I used to do that instinctually in my suit wearing days. I may have subconsciously picked it up from classical paintings but I think it was just me not knowing what to do with my hands. That and my cheap ass suit often had the pockets sown shut for some reason.
powerwashingporn,ffxm6yn,t1_ffwg1cn,1580327959.0,"It’s just a low pile carpet, those don’t absorb much. A lot of offices and commercial spaces use low pile for that very reason. If they let it sit for a minute it would maybe start to set in and be harder to clean."
gaming,ffnnzzu,t1_ffmbm2c,1580068365.0,Yeah the hangar fees for my small county airport is 10k a year.
todayilearned,ffn76wa,t1_ffmfrbz,1580062698.0,"There’s white noise which is an even eq of static across all frequencies. Pink is where there an exponential factor applied as the frequency goes up(I don’t fully understand that science of it) so pink is a little more biased to the lower frequencies, it’s “warmer” sounding. Then there’s also grey and brown noise. Brown is similar to pink but instead of having an exponential eq the it’s just a straight 20db reduction every octave going up I believe. Grey is like white, but with and equal loudness instead of pure energy. Because we hear different frequencies at different “loudness” 20db at 100hz isn’t as loud as 20db at 10000hz.

Theoretically pink noise would be more pleasant over white to most people. Ideally you would tune it to the environment because our pink noise piped into any room will be affected and you won’t hear true pink noise."
theydidthemath,ffebl4r,t1_ffe5wdo,1579842241.0,Finish work and rough work are vastly different jobs and rates. More than likely they’d just hire a bunch of dudes to dig ditches and dry fit the pipe for cheap and have a plumber or two come along and do final assembly and pressure testing.
theydidthemath,ffdtbcd,t1_ffdjfje,1579828402.0,"Yeah, I was thinking about just pumps and pipe, with those nozzles I’m sure it’s closer to that, maybe more."
theydidthemath,ffdc55x,t1_ffda3j6,1579817738.0," Ball park for a basic system with no redundancies would probably be 15-25k USD. That’s just materials. Probably 10k or so for plumbers and what not. So realistically probably closer to 50k or more installed.

Edit: I seem to have forgotten about the nozzles in this estimation. They look pretty complex, so go ahead and double that total price cause you’ll probably have to pay to have the companies technicians come out and install them."
AskMen,ffcitxs,t3_esruuu,1579800386.0,"Not married but I like rings. I only take my silver ring off for cleaning. My dad likes rings also(he made mine), but only wears his for special occasions. He works with machinery and has seen several dudes lose fingers."

powerwashingporn,fepjoq3,t1_fepi2gx,1579322246.0,"Transmission Fluid, is basically oil with soap in it to keep the gears and whatnot clean. Usually red and tastes disgusting."
powerwashingporn,fepg0i5,t1_fep5uel,1579319562.0,"Oil is usually amber or walnut colored, dirty oil is black. There’s one kind that’s green. Idk of any that are yellow. Tranny fluid is usually red, but maybe there’s a yellow one."
facepalm,fej3rrp,t1_feiv3ht,1579155805.0,Yeah it’s obviously meant to be metaphorical rather than literal. We attach breathing to life so it’s an artistic depiction of sacrifice. Or it could mean something different to someone else.
IdiotsInCars,fej2n8o,t1_fej0ohu,1579154617.0,"It’s kinda hard to see. You countersteer with your arms but a lot of people also steer the correct direction with their legs/body. You can see him shift his weight right before the car almost hits him. 

Next time you’re out and the lanes around you are clear try turning just the handlebars left or right. If you’re over 15mph or so the bike will lean itself in the opposite direction."
IdiotsInCars,feiueiy,t1_fein6pv,1579147483.0,"Yeah that seems to be the case. The safety class I was in never got about 15mph and they kept telling us that at speed you would have to push in the opposite direction to turn and no one understood. I tried to explain it, but until you get up 20+ and try to turn it’s hard to understand. 

Hell I didn’t realize it until I was about 20 when I was fucking around on the blue ridge and I’d been riding for 10 years. It was all instinct at that point. I don’t care how long someone’s been riding I think it should be required to take a safety class period. There’s a ton of things you may already do, but being actively conscious of them makes you a better rider."

apple,fe5khlr,t1_fe32qtw,1578870571.0,That’s why I opted for the xr instead of the xs. The battery lasts longer despite being smaller because it doesn’t have to push a higher resolution hdr screen. I can’t really see a difference in mine and an xs in most cases.

youseeingthisshit,fdxyaor,t1_fdwrfc7,1578774163.0,"Yeah a base student school model is cheap, but most Steinway pianos are north of 100k even the mid range ones. Just to get an old one reworked by Steinway is 35k+ depending on what needs to be done."
