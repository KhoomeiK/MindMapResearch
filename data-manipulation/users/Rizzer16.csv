datingoverthirty,ffg5cgt,t1_ffg4iao,1579898795.0,"I don’t think it matters how long you are single. It’s more so the loneliness/frustration/worry that comes and goes. There is no guarantee that I will ever find another relationship. But what is guaranteed is that I will feel lonely again and start actively dating. Then I might get frustrated and take a break. This is all my experience, though. I cannot put a blanket statement on this."
datingoverthirty,fffx991,t1_fffm9xi,1579893803.0,"It took me 2 years to get to that point. I wish I had the formula so I could use it again, but I don’t. I think I was just tired of putting energy into something that just wasn’t making me feel happy. I made myself so busy that I realized any extra time I had, I wanted to spend with friends or volunteering or relaxing. Those were things I knew would bring joy to myself."
datingoverthirty,fffjtmm,t3_etcyvq,1579885501.0,"My last string on dates/dating was really getting on my nerves. I just felt like I couldn’t connect with anyone. I stopped the dating apps for now. I currently have been so busy that it is distracting me, but it’s a welcome distraction. It reminds me that even though I’m single, it doesn’t mean I’m alone.

To your other point, I’ve gotten to where I am today because I always took action. My brain tells me that when you want something, you put in the work, and you get it. I have to keep reminding myself that this part of my life is out of my control. The more something is out of my control, the more worried and anxious I got. Right now, I’ve accepted that I can’t control this aspect. This allows me to be at peace with it. I don’t know how long it will last, but I’m enjoying it at the moment. I can’t tell you how I got to that point. It just kind of happened.

Basically, I just wanted to let you know that you aren’t alone. Also, that the feeling is temporary. Things will change as always."

You’re thinking about the idea of having someone, not the actual person.

Many times when I’m upset something didn’t work, it was the idea of having someone rather than the person. I could honestly say “insert any man” when talking about a specific person."

Listen, the best thing my ex ever did for me was leave me for another woman right before Christmas. I’m 2 years out from that, and my life is so great. I’m single and happy I didn’t waste any more time with him. I’ve grown so much after I was stunted in that relationship. Go no contact. Cry, vent, go to work, go out with friends. Continue on. Because you will, and you will be happy again."

datingoverthirty,fcndrbb,t3_ei43x7,1577809572.0,"I donâ€™t have children, but I travel often for work. Sometimes itâ€™s last minute. I just want to reiterate that just because someone doesnâ€™t have children, doesnâ€™t mean they are available all of the time."
datingoverthirty,fci31ha,t1_fchsgn3,1577657155.0,"I really had to take a good look at myself. I was part of that toxic relationship. Why did I stay until he left me? It forced me to see cracks within myself. Now that I am aware, I can be more mindful. I donâ€™t know how to date healthy, but Iâ€™m learning little by little. I have taken a break from dating and found that Iâ€™m the happiest Iâ€™ve been in these past 2 years."
datingoverthirty,fchoxu4,t3_ehb7x9,1577652599.0,"Having a narcissistic ex takes a while to move on from. Iâ€™m 2 years out. I will say that as soon as someone I am seeing starts to remind me of my ex or doing things that are similar, I end it. It immediately freaks me out. Trying to healthily date has been more of a challenge and I constantly doubt my â€œgutâ€. I run things past family and friends to get there perspective."
datingoverthirty,fc6ehob,t3_egfzu4,1577478663.0,"This is something I do. Iâ€™ve basically taken a break except for 1 or 2 dates I went on. Iâ€™ve been spending time with family and friends, and have found out that when I make time for that, I have less time to date. Youâ€™re thinking about the idea of having someone, not the actual person.

Many times when Iâ€™m upset something didnâ€™t work, it was the idea of having someone rather than the person. I could honestly say â€œinsert any manâ€ when talking about a specific person."
datingoverthirty,fc49cb8,t3_eg3q3x,1577410154.0,I donâ€™t nor do I even know how to tune my face. I am what I am. Iâ€™ve also been told numerous times I look better in person. Iâ€™d rather someone be pleasantly surprised than horrified.

I would wait until the holidays are over and life is back to normal. See if things even out again. If not, then I would casually bring it up without an accusing tone, or a â€œyou donâ€™t do x y or zâ€."

datingoverthirty,fc1m5y1,t1_fc1lqgb,1577322932.0,"Ok, this is going to sound harsh, but wake up. Why on earth do you want to be with someone like that. Listen, the best thing my ex ever did for me was leave me for another woman right before Christmas. Iâ€™m 2 years out from that, and my life is so great. Iâ€™m single and happy I didnâ€™t waste any more time with him. Iâ€™ve grown so much after I was stunted in that relationship. Go no contact. Cry, vent, go to work, go out with friends. Continue on. Because you will, and you will be happy again."
datingoverthirty,fc1jsak,t3_efnz5h,1577320865.0,"Iâ€™m close with my immediate family and I have a few close friends. My family always â€œadoptsâ€ anyone myself or sister has dated as part of the family. Honestly, it isnâ€™t a big deal to us at all, and it makes us happy. If itâ€™s because your partner or their family judged you, I wouldnâ€™t give up on everyone that is close with family or friends. However, if this is something you canâ€™t or wonâ€™t accept, then there is nothing the other person can do to convince you otherwise."
datingoverthirty,fc1j1j9,t1_fc1euyy,1577320230.0,"Is she ignoring you because no matter what she says, you wonâ€™t take â€œnoâ€ for an answer? Thatâ€™s not abuse, and honestly from how you described the situation, it again doesnâ€™t sound like abuse. Maybe you are leaving important details out of this post. We can only comment on what you write. 

Youâ€™re hurting and Iâ€™m sure having all of the mental illnesses magnifies it all 10x. But continuing to reach out isnâ€™t working. Itâ€™s not making her feel better and itâ€™s not making you feel better. Stop all contact, for yourself. And maybe donâ€™t hit up dating apps for a very long while."
datingoverthirty,fc0nhp6,t3_efj1he,1577295246.0,"For me, it wouldnâ€™t really matter. Itâ€™s not really on the level of deceptive that is an issue. As long as you say, oh my name is actually X, once we get chatting."
