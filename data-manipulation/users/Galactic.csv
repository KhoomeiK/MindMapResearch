What's funny is I'm not even downvoting you, [someone is upvoting me and downvoting you at the same time.](https://gyazo.com/57fd17b1a73ee6525321c8ebd9f0d1c2)  You probably say a lot of stupid shit on reddit, don'tcha.  I doubt your stupidity was contained to this one thread.  Downvote butthurt, talk about pathetic.  I'm done talking to you, I wouldn't want any more downvotes to hurt your fee fees.

But since you're sperging so badly I went back and edited the comment to read ""can asexual women be cucks?""  Even tho it was obvious that's what I was asking to anyone with a brain.

You seem pretty protective over the term cuck.  Is it like the N-word, only you cucks can use it?"

>I wonder how many men your cousins wife has fucked, probably in the hundreds. Have you fucked your cousins wife?

Literally zero.  She is asexual.  They just love each other and she feels bad that she has no desire for sex at all so in order to keep him happy they are in an open relationship, which means while they both could technically have sex with other partners, he's the only one doing it.

>My point is though that women will have many many more partners than the man and that is absolutely some cucked shit.

Your point is wrong, especially when you say 100%, which you did earlier."
LivestreamFail,ffen14w,t1_ffemwtp,1579855239.0,What?  I never denied sex is easier for a woman to get.  That had nothing to do with my point.  I only stated him saying 100% of open relationships is a guy too beta to end the relationship is false.
