You’re right though, this game missed the mark with what they created, they weren’t shy about their creative direction, but it was always wrong and they never listened entirely to feedback.

I found a lot of enjoyment out of this, until the addition of spotting. Fortunately life got busy around then too, so I can’t jump on Xbox loads anyway, when I do now I’m enjoying the COD campaign on crazy hard."

You posted a clip on a forum that encourages responses both positive and negative.

I’m not disputing the fact you killed 4 people, as I said, if that’s an achievement for you then enjoy yourself.
