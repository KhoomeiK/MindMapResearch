AskWomen,fee3qo8,t3_eofn21,1579025773.0,"Me personally, there came a point in my life when I truly stopped caring what people thought of me. I had to learn to define my own version of what I thought attractive/sexy was and not what society considered it was. Once I mastered that, I started becoming more and more comfortable in my own skin and it started to radiate."
offmychest,fcknvnh,t3_ehjuor,1577729391.0,Self betterment! That’s always great. Good for you man!
offmychest,fckns52,t1_fckcs59,1577729330.0,Damn. “Don’t waste time on someone who isn’t interested in you.” Thank you for this!
offmychest,fckbrxz,t1_fckb8pi,1577721759.0,"A parent’s absence does truly have an effect on their kid’s lives. It sucks, but, forgiveness is the most important. It’s not for them, but for us- I keep telling myself this hoping it gets easier. I appreciate your kind words, thank you and Happy Birthday!!"
Adulting,fc6oswc,t1_fc6obhd,1577485712.0,"I get that, but, what good are you doing yourself constantly worried and living in fear? You’re going to make mistakes- that’s life. You make them and you do better next time. And it’s also about perspective, always remember that. Who’s to say that your next “loss” isn’t preparing you for something greater? You have a full life ahead of you- learn to conquer it."
Adulting,fc6nh5s,t1_fc6nctd,1577484770.0,If you don't have to rely on anyone because you have your own life. Good for you. Your choices in life are what makes you an adult.
Adulting,fc6nctd,t1_fc6mx9t,1577484685.0,"Handling your responsibilities like an adult as you seem to be doing. Not having a car and someone telling you that you're immature shouldn't validate if you're an adult or not. I'm 28. My place is messy right now, so what. I'm an adult. And the fact that you're an ""awful"" cook doesn't mean anything either. Practice makes perfect. You're only 20. Stop overthinking it ;)"
