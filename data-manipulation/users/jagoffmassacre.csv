fatlogic,ff0mshq,t1_ff0j05e,1579470337.0,I think that was the guy named [Murray](https://youtu.be/joly1lVa8mU)
fatlogic,fett1jc,t1_fetlexu,1579379729.0,I’m so sorry you went through all that. That’s why I can’t stand the warped HAES language and the way they co-opt ED recovery phrases. It’s fucked up.  Having out of whack eating habits is not the same as a full blown eating disorder. 😟
fatlogic,ferk5t4,t1_ferc8q3,1579354929.0,"I usually go for foods to feel full that are high in fiber protein, and foods that are voluminous but lower in calories. Like leafy greens are low cal but you can eat a lot of them, they’re high in nutrition etc. A breakfast I often eat that keeps me full is a serving of quick cooking steel cut oats with 2 TBSP [PB2 powder](https://pb2foods.com/products/pre-probiotic-powdered-peanut-butter/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7_zHhqKN5wIVl5OzCh2gsgJdEAAYASAAEgI0r_D_BwE), a banana cut up on top and a TBSP of maple syrup. Pretty good. 

Psychologically I usually just tell myself to review mentally what I’ve eaten so far that day and remind myself that I’m not actually gonna wither away or pass out. Lol. Ask yourself if you’re hungry/bored or hungry actually. Sometimes I am feeling some other emotion that I’m not addressing. 

Also the plasma thing and walking a lot probably contribute to your hungries. I’d just make sure you’re hydrated & eating well. 🙂"

fatlogic,fddhzh1,t1_fdcfjz7,1578313070.0,A 26 min 5k is great. I’m always trying to get under 30 myself but it’s the getting there that’s half the fun.
fatlogic,fd9u39z,t1_fd9sbam,1578238016.0,It’s like turning into a pumpkin! Lol
fatlogic,fcyvm13,t1_fcyu6yv,1578088048.0,In that boat too. Let’s do this! 😏

fatlogic,fc6r0p0,t1_fc6podq,1577487278.0,"Ugh you’re right. That’s what started me losing weight 6 years ago, horrible photos of myself. Aka candid. Thanks! I have only 10 extra to lose but that would still help."
fatlogic,fc6pi4y,t3_egc9c3,1577486210.0,If anyone has any tips or suggestions on how to get one’s ass cheeks in gear and into the “in the groove” zone and out of the I’m just Fucking Around in Denial Zone let me know. Asking for myself. 🤔
fatlogic,fc58pzs,t1_fc57qfp,1577448876.0,Healthy weight people are unusual nowadays. 😯
fatlogic,fbkrlc0,t1_fbk7bsj,1576954600.0,Yeah people with this mindset really don’t get it. We may not know when we’re gonna go but if you have healthy habits your quality of life is so much better. Live in the moment.
