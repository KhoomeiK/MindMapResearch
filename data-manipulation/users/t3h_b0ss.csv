You're still fixated on that theres two biological genders. The whacko libtards are trying to say that your gender expression of who you are is based on the role you fit in to society or some bullshit like that. Basically, there are expectations for boys, and expectations for girls, but pretending to be genderless is easier for them to admit they're not interesting and have zero value on the sexual marketplace. The issue is when they say things like bigender; that means it's probably a lady who wants to be masculine (i.e. rude, for some reason this is always the 'masculine' trait they pick) but also be considered dainty and feminine. This is the figment of some mental retardation that stems from a poor childhood (and likely molestation or maybe emotional neglect), but it is fully acceptable in that same line of thinking - they do not want to be viewed by society's context of what their sex is, they want it skewed in a gradient between male and female. It makes sense when the native Americans did it - there were boys, girls, masculine females, feminine males, and genderless. I'd still subscribe to the fact that everyone is on this spectrum somewhere BETWEEN masculine and feminine, and the new-age libtard pseudoscience fuckery isnt wrong about that, but when you start making up 40,000 other bullshit names and different pronouns, you're being an unreasonable snot nosed bitch of an entitled human being. Stop taking yourself so seriously and get over whatever problem you had to make you come to this stupid conclusion, and live your life. That being said, there is for sure 3 genders, but everyone is on a spectrum of that, and that's what gave rise to this weird place we are now where some people say ""you cant count the genders"". Yeah, dipshit, you cany count from zero to one if you name all the infentecimal steps it takes on the gradient from 0 to 1. Just to be clear, anything with aliens or animals is a psychosis, and that person should be medicated.

Tl;dr I got big problems with those weirdos, but theres at least 3 genders (male, female, none) and an infinite gradient of combinational possibilities in between them, but naming them is more of a logistical problem than a cultural one.
