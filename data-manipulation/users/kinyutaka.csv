The fact is that not everyone can avail themselves of a free ride college scholarship, where even food is paid for, then pick up a good paying tech job right after.

**But**, if they can get into a situation where they can afford to pay rent, then they should be good enough to get a home loan.

For example, the general consensus is that you pay 1% of a home's price in rent per month, so if your rent is $1000, your home is worth $100,000. Also, you'd probably end up getting the rent raised regularly.

If you get a home loan for that house with zero down and 3.8% interest, your monthly payment, including property taxes, insurance, and PMI would be $791. It would drop to $750 after the PMI expires.

That means you would save $210-250 a month if they were to issue a home loan.

Furthermore, for all the people that have bad credit and shit, their creditors would be able to put liens on the home to allow for them to eventually get their money without fucking over people's lives. And they'd still be using credit for starting up unsecured accounts.

But if we are going to say that everyone deserves a roof over their head, we need to fucking **mean it**."

Well, the demon hand, it was choking her, right, but then it possessed her, made her head spin around and vomit pea soup like on The Exorcist.

Then she jumped into me and made me have sex before causing the house to explode.


It's a pretty stupid board game, but I like to think I won."

Microsoft has been very smart so far, requiring developers to make XB1 games followed by a XB1X patch, which allows the XB1 to continue playing almost all games 

That won't happen for the crossover.

New XB1 games are probably going to continue to come out, some even might have XBSeX patches. But if it is designed for Series X, it will only be playable on Series X."
