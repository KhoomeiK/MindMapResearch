Your brother seemed to want to be lenient about the weed smoking but seemed to have let it build up and then snapped on Sunday (which is generally quiet time for most people) and you assumed because he said yes it was fine, that you could do it, even though you know he doesn't really like it or approve. 
Also- what's with this ---> ''he thinks he has a chronic debilitating illness'' ? That is kinda assholeish."
AmItheAsshole,fe9e4cc,t3_eo68s0,1578936732.0,NTA. He doesn't have any respect and frankly seems quite childish (more interested in football games and food over his wife?) Manbaby. Tell him to grow the fuck up

Honestly, i think you should go to whoever you reported it to, and make sure they understand how the situation really went before he loses his career and possibly has lifelong job repercussions because of this"

Disappearing for 20 hours straight, turning your phone off, would induce panic and worry in most spouses and that's probably what you wanted. Did she go off to fuck someone else? Was she kidnapped? Is she ok? You probably got off on the fact that it dumbfounded him. He sucks way more than you for being a shit dad, but you suck for that one behaviour you did."
AmItheAsshole,fe9alh2,t3_eo5rhi,1578935891.0,"ESH. Just different perspectives, and insensitivity to money issues on his side. He did pay for your flight which was really nice, but i don't think he took the money thing as seriously as he should of. Sounds like he's been more privileged and doesn't understand how it works when you're broke or even just kinda-broke. You're also not the ahole for not being able to pay for everything on a trip when the reason you didn't go in the first place is because of money. You knew you were going for 2 weeks, so did he say he was going to pay for everything or mostly everything? And why didn't you go see him when he asked you to?"

Tell her once again to fuck off, and if she wanted favours off you she shouldn't have cheated. I would even go as far as to say you'll consider her constant nagging for money as harassment from now on if she continues as you've asked her to fuck off already."
