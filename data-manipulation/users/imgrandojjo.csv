philosophy,ffn5vzw,t1_ffn2p2a,1580062354.0,Not sure what the point of that rant was.
philosophy,ffmy5zc,t1_ffm94dn,1580060131.0,"you're in a philosophy discussion forum.  Bias goes with the territory.  

When I give my opinion, it's going to be my opinion, which is my bias.  Telling me that my bias is biased is literally the most worthless possible response to my statement.

I am ignorant of the absolute specifics but I know for a fact based on my studies that the planet has been warmer in the past than it is right now.

The real skeptic debate isn't the presence or absence of warming or even of AGW.  It's a debate between positive feedback and negative feedback theories regarding the anthropogenic component.

To whit, do environmental factors accelerate or mitigate the warming 

Based on what I think I know about cloud albedo feedback, I favor negative feedback theory -- that the natural forces will adjust and form a new equilibrium. As warming increases, it seems logical to me that additional moisture in the air, additional cloud cover, and a resultant reduction in solar energy absorbed will mitigate the surface warming over time.  Of course that doesn't mean we can go hog wild with no regard for environmental damage, just that the forces involved will seek a new equilibrium, and as long as we don't screw things up too bad, will eventually find one.  And it will probably be one that humans can survive in. 

The positive feedback theory is effectively a downward spiral where any failure now guarantees apocalypse later, like films like Day After Tomorrow, and I tend to believe that given what we know about natural warming and cooling patterns from the geological record and other sources, if that was the case the environment wouldn't have existed as a biological community for milions of years.  The pressure we're placing on the environment is unprecedented, but it seems to me that if things were going to fly off the handle it would have already done so during the era between the 1670s and 1960s when we weren't really caring how much environmental damage we did."
philosophy,ffm5nam,t1_ffiehkx,1580048870.0,"If you wrote this post on your own personal device, you're part of the problem.  You realize that, right?"
philosophy,ffm4u3p,t1_ffkao32,1580048571.0,"The biggest part of the disconnect on the political spectrum is that in the process for making the appeal for change to combat climate control, the left almost always incidentally increases government overreach.  This naturally and automatically makes them the enemy to classical liberal and neoconservative political worldviews.

The classic mistake of leftist movements is to assume that when something needs to be done on a massive scale, the vector for action should always be the government.  Government action can start a process and encourage popular action but only popular action will actually achieve the goals inherent in mitigating the worst damage of climate change.

And by making an enemy of half the nation, left-wing political activists encourage those individuals to dig in their heels and deny harder, which only makes popular action all the more difficult.

If left-wing activists spent less time condemning those who aren't on their level yet, and more time leading by example, we may have already solved the worst of the climate change issues by now.

I'm personally of the opinion that climate change has happened, is happening, and will continue to happen, with or without us, and that more study is needed to separate normal climate fluctuations from the anthropogenic (man made) element.  I see a disturbing amount of thought that any climate fluctuation at all is automatically anthropogenic and that gives humanity entirely  too much credit IMHO.  We are not as powerful as we think we are."

What Musk is talking about is basically a standard demographic shift that's been happening as long as there has been humans.  Wealthy families will have fewer children and focus on raising them carefully.  Poor families will throw children into the world and see who survives.  This, combined with the rich having greater access to life-extending medical care, will ensure that the rich lean old, and the poor lean young.
