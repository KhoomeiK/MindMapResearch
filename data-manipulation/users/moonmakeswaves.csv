depression,fff1b2r,t1_ffe51ot,1579872954.0,"Of course! I’m so glad to know it’s had a positive impact! There will always be something we “need” to do or “should” do. Don’t let it make you feel like a bad person if you don’t do it, but let it make you feel awesome if you do! Progress is never linear. Be kind to yourself. 

This morning I didn’t get up for the gym, I felt really tired and knew that I wouldn’t be able to make it through my work day if I didn’t get enough sleep. I prioritized my work over the gym this morning and that’s okay! Maybe I’ll workout later today!"
depression,fff106r,t1_ffdxn5t,1579872699.0,"Yes! It’s like the gym becomes the neutral. If anything, you know you can ride the confidence you get from the gym for the rest of the day. I’m sorry you’re having a hard time building your freelance clients. I’m actually planning on starting my own freelance design business soon. Remember processes aren’t always linear and that’s okay. You’ve got this. Keep at it and don’t give up!"
depression,fff0tx0,t1_ffdv2q5,1579872552.0,Hell yeah! Keep at it dude. I’m rooting for you! I hope you kick ass in your workout today.
depression,ffdqbw2,t1_ffdok0t,1579826398.0,Hell yeah dude that’s awesome I definitely think you should try and follow through! I find that a good workout playlist helps tremendously. Depression gainz.
depression,ffdq3ry,t1_ffdls2b,1579826256.0,"I definitely relate to this. I make my bed as soon as I stand up so it takes more work to crawl back in bed. I think a good strategy is to not necessarily ignore your brain, but just let it throw a tantrum while you get up anyways. Like a toddler. 

I’m in my early twenties now and I definitely can relate to how you feel. I like to lay my gym clothes out the night before, set my alarm on my phone away from my bed so I have to get up to turn it off, and when I wake up the next morning I try to repeat to myself “your past self set this alarm for a reason, do your part”."
depression,ffdpqom,t1_ffdimjp,1579826027.0,"That’s awesome to hear you’ve got some goals in mind! I can relate to that disappointment feeling. When I feel like that I try to remember all of the good things I’ve done and all of the great things I can bring into the world, no matter how small they may seem. There may be places where I fail, but there are also places where I kick ass. I’m rooting for you!"
depression,ffdphi4,t1_ffdgq2s,1579825867.0,"Hell yeah! It’s important to remember that our feelings themselves are valid, but the depression is another thing. I like seeing it as an opponent to beat. It helps me remember that me depression isn’t me, it’s just something shitty I’m dealing with."
depression,ffdhirj,t1_ffd7gqt,1579820987.0,"Thank you! Honestly the way I see my negative voices is that they’re liars. I have this narrative that inside my head there is a constant battle between my true self who wants what is best for me, and my fake self who is conditioned, damaged and has negative thought patterns that are distorted and false. 

So sometimes when I wake up and the thoughts start pouring in, “You’ll never look the way you want to look”, “none of this matters anyways”, “rest comes first”, “I’m so tired I can’t do it”, “skipping today’s workout won’t be that big of a deal”, “just go after work”.

My response is always: “You’re a liar, and you have no power here.” 

Theoden that hoe."
depression,ffd2wm6,t1_ffctjo2,1579812358.0,"Right! Even a tiny little decision in the positive direction can start your day off right and ripple out to positively affect the rest of your day. Some mornings I just make the decision to take a deep breath, then a decision to put both feet on the floor, then a decision to stand up. I break it down to the smallest decisions so it doesn’t feel so overwhelming!"
depression,ffd2nmv,t1_ffd0wlw,1579812214.0,You’ve done a lot of awesome things I’m sure. Don’t feel bad about yourself for needing some time to recharge and reset. Most projects aren’t linear and have their fast and slow moments. You’ve got this!
depression,ffceu9q,t1_ffc1l8i,1579797941.0,"Thank you! I love the days when I win the battle in my head over choosing to get up or stay in bed. I never regret it, that’s for sure."
depression,ffcepnx,t1_ffc744o,1579797864.0,"Thank you! I’m definitely proud of myself :) 

I’ve had problems with sleep as well, I recently got a white noise machine and it’s actually made such a huge difference in my sleep quality. It keeps my brain in a “cloud” as I like to call it and helps me relax a lot more before bed. Just a thought. I hope you get a new wave of energy soon!"
depression,ffcegag,t1_ffcbr1t,1579797701.0,"I think it is endorphins! I can definitely tell a huge difference in my mood before and after my workout. Like I mentioned it’s not a magic fix, it doesn’t fix everything, but it definitely sets the day off on a positive note rather than just dragging myself out of bed last minute for work and not having time to eat breakfast, which is what I do when my depression wins. Morning exercises make you feel super productive too, bc by the time everyone else is up for work, you’ve already gotten the hardest part of your day done with! 

Thank you so much for the encouragement!"
depression,ffce5r7,t1_ffccfik,1579797519.0,"The hardest part is just getting to the gym. After that, you have no choice BUT to work out. And seeing other people there working out gives you a sense of community and motivation. Like look at all these other people who also battled with their mind this morning and ALSO chose to get up and come here despite feeling like shit.

Something that helps me tremendously is laying out my gym stuff the night before so that everything is as easy as possible for when I wake up. Sometimes I even sleep in the shirt I’m gonna wear just so it’s one less thing to do!  

I’m cheering you on. You’ve got this!"
raisedbyborderlines,ff6duff,t3_ersj0h,1579625040.0,"Oh my god my mom does this all the time. She literally tried to make me feel guilty for not calling her to check on her when she had a heart attack............... I literally had no clue. Did she expect me to have some sort of spidey sense or something to call her? It just baffles me how much she tries to make me feel guilty for not talking to her on a regular basis. 

“You would’ve known I had a heart attack if you talked to me on a regular basis.”

Translation:
“You would’ve known I had a heart attack if you were still codependent enough to NEED to talk to me in order to make ME feel better.” ME ME ME ME MEEEEE!!!!

I’m so sorry you had to deal with this. It’s not right."
Anxiety,fejnvj1,t3_epe6k3,1579181123.0,"I deleted my fb account about 6 months ago, along with my Spotify which was connected to it. I tried so hard to talk to customer service at Spotify to see if I could salvage my playlists and stuff and because my Spotify account was made specifically by using my Facebook account, they couldn’t be separated. So I just bit the bullet and destroyed them both lol.

Point is, I deleted my fb account bc I was tired of feeling obligated to stay up to date with what everyone else was doing. I also hated the fact my mom would always say “it’s so and so’s birthday, don’t forget to say happy birthday to them on fb”.

I’ve loved being Facebook free. It gave me a shit ton of anxiety too."
raisedbyborderlines,fejni5j,t3_epclac,1579180796.0,Dude... this 100% could not have come at a better time on my feed.
Enneagram5,fec5dxi,t1_fe8df92,1578966904.0,"Oh shoot I missed “female” in your post. My bad! But cap marvel doesn’t seem like a 5 to me. But I think she definitely has five traits. Maybe a 6w5? My brother is 6w5 and her character is extremely similar to his personality. Not sure, just a guess. 

I feel like Princess Leia from Star Wars could be a five?"
Enneagram5,fe84x00,t3_env1sg,1578922618.0,"Marvel anyone? Bruce Banner seems like a 5 to me, and so does Bucky. Also maybe Clint (hawkeye)"
