Now coming for visits and living here are two completely different things, the way taxes work kinda perplexed me, as well as the changes in laws (I used to always carry a pocket knife on me, now I only ever have one while at work). The steps to getting a drivers licence ( as well as the cost ¬£¬£) the rise in crime figures.
