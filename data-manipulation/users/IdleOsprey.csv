AmItheAsshole,ffmapst,t3_eu5q5j,1580051469.0,"NTA. Back in the day when I moved back in with my mom for a bit, I made a kind of arrangement like this with her but because it was mutually beneficial. This was in Canada, so I’m not sure whether this can be done in the US, but essentially I had excess tax credits - I’d already maxed out my refund - so I was able to assign the remainder to my mom. She went from owing a few hundred dollars to getting back nearly $1K. I was happy to do it for her then, plus, my mother might have her own issues, but she’s not an asshole.

If she’s bumped you off her insurance, she’s already cut the apron strings. Your money is yours beyond what you’ve agreed to pay her for rent. Time to leave the nest - I’m sure you can find better roommates, and it’s time the rest of your family started figuring out their own shit. It’s not on you."

AmItheAsshole,fe2h7tu,t3_engdkr,1578838335.0,"YTA. Your bridal party should be made of people who are important to you. You’re making the dresses more important than the people. Perhaps you should just put a few mannequins up next to you with your ‘perfect dresses’ on.

I’m going to totally rant on you here so skip if your feelings are easily hurt. I spent over a dozen years as a wedding photographer. I’ve seen pretty much everything that happens at weddings. The best weddings have happy people in them. You are totally being a bridezilla if perfect dresses are more important to you than the feelings of those you love. Shove those girls in dresses they’re uncomfortable in and suffer the consequences at your wedding. Unhappy people, unhappy in the photos, and pissed at you underneath.

Also, why do you have to have matching dresses? That’s totally 1980s. The current fashions are for coordinating dresses - similar dresses in tonal shades, or one colour but different styles that each girl likes. This matchy-matchy business is so outdated.

Do everyone a favour and stop with the strapless dresses already. Very few people actually look good in them, they’re tugging them up all night long, and again, so cliche. Don’t even get me started about all the back fat and muffin tops I’m subsequently asked to edit out. For the record, my rate for that is $10 per pound.

Stop being a shallow selfish shithead and try to get a handle on what a wedding should be about - you and your intended telling the world you want to be together forever, and celebrating that with the people most important to you. A wedding is not about perfect dresses, flowers, chicken or fish, or mason jars. It’s highly unlikely you’re going to be featured in Modern Bride and if that’s your goal, you need to reassess why you’re having a wedding. To be honest, most weddings are pretty fucking tacky and everyone can’t wait to leave. 

The best weddings I’ve ever covered were smaller affairs with people who all adore each other, wearing whatever the fuck they want, in a beautiful place they love. You’ll remember the moments forever if it actually has meaning to you."

On New Year’s Day, it’s traditional to attend a levee, or several levees. These are basically parties/open houses at different government and military establishments (eg the lieutenant governor’s residence, a town hall, a naval base) where anyone can go and be greeted by the high lord or commander or whoever in charge, have a drink, etc. Some places have a traditional drink they always serve - at one of the naval bases, for example, it would be this half-curdled concoction called moose milk. Back in the day after a night of New Year’s Eve revelry, we’d start making the rounds of all the different levees around 7 am, still dressed in our party clothes, and still fairly drunk.
