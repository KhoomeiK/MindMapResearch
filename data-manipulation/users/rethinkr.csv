Yes, the fellow man was already turned against him, as he had behaved with discrimination, but being 'more american' can never be used against someone, if it is really a humble, righteous position."

But thats just because there's no such thing as more american or less american, and there shouldn't be a fight over integrity or humility or a superiority within the same nation, even if someone has been racist to you, you don't fight it by using race again and using the american card. Its a small point but important. Not racist and do oppose racism, but its falling for the same trap- thinking the anthem is being sung for you- thinking its good to be more american than others. Good speech though and good work ethic, and good to see someone like that getting some words in, but there should be no superiority in america, even over a racist, because it continues a cycle of self righteousness- even if justified- it causes polarization between people."

Dont forget we evolved from geometric shapes and structures which can be found across the universe and there is a finite number of possible chemicals- limiting any life form anywhere to a lot of shared foods in comparable sized organisms.
