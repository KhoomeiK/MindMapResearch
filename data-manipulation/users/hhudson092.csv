Endo,fegnnf2,t3_ep1701,1579098130.0,"This exact thing started happening to me around 7 or 8. I also had several MRI and ultrasounds on my kidney because of pain, had suspected kidney stones.

Endo,fdct41t,t1_fdcm9um,1578283557.0,"Thanks! I'm all good now. Same goes for you! I do find that I have been pleasantly surprised that none of mine have compared to my ""bad one"" (3rd one, 32 staples) and recovery hasn't seemed bad for the other 7. Hopefully this one is a breeze compared to your last one."
Endo,fdcimwb,t3_ekidmh,1578275834.0,I've had 10 endo surgeries in 4 years. Many of my scars have been cut into many times and heal fine. Once there is too much scar tissue they will make a new incision
