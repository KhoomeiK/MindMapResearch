AEWOfficial,fdgkaoc,t1_fdfe7kp,1578400149.0,"I.E. Jurassic Express / BFOC - Eh. They tease a lot of that stuff on BTE and even after matches. They haven't come close to acknowledging anything between Trent, Chucky, and Freshly Squeezed. In matches he comes through. Best Friends have been well, friends with the Jacksons a long time and OC has been friends with Chucky a good while in the Indies. I can def see Orange getting a more singles push, but I don't see there being a rift between OC and BF."

SquaredCircle,fddv614,t1_fdcn659,1578324760.0,"I was in town in Dallas for business when Dynamite was there.  I obviously got tickets for it. When Justin Roberts was announcing the Dark matches, we were all collectively holding our breath. He finally gets to the last card and it was TH2 and Pac versus... ""Trent! Chuck Taylor and.... FRESHLY SQUEEZED, ORANGE CASSIDY!!"" The place went apeshit and then we all realized we would have to sit through the entire show (which was amazing) just to get to Best Friends and OC.  He is the real deal and I absolutely cannot wait to see how he progresses. He is perfect for AEW so he can work other promotions and not have his character ruined by the McMahon family."

I got out of the car and immediately looked to the window with a smile expecting to see the little face and hear happy yips. Took me a second to remember that she would never be in the window again and the wave of emotions hit me like a brick in the face. It hurts every single time, but I promise it gets better.
