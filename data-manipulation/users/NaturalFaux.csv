Considering that she probably didn't have any access to birth control or abortion, coupled with the fear that her father would literally kill her and possibly the baby as well, she decided that she would risk one life instead of both of their lives.

rpghorrorstories,ffintad,t1_ffig32d,1579978329.0,"He actually based it off of the Pathfinder game that we played, the starter edition. I was playing a DM PC and had my brother (the Folk Hero in our D&D game) and a friend. When we got to the end of the cave there was the young black Dragon Lair and he spotted it and immediately wanted to try and befriend it. We actually got its health down pretty quick and in the module it says that it flies away when its Health gets too low. Well my brother decided that when it was flying away he would try and throw an axe to hit its wing, down it, then Stockholm Syndrome it back to health, thus gaining a life long friend.

He rolled a 1.

Well I had a nifty little sheet that determines what would happen on a crit fail. I can't remember exactly what number he rolled but it landed on "" your attack lands but hits the wrong spot"". So I rolled to see which spot it would hit.

Right in the neck.

So he rolled for damage.

Nat. Fucking. 20

So we were all pretty much screeching non-stop as I tried to explain how he threw an axe 30 feet up into the air and nailed the dragon right in the neck, killing it instantly. On their first dungeon. On the only time we've played Pathfinder. When it was supposed to take way longer for them to get it to half health, and the dragon was supposed to show up in a later module.
