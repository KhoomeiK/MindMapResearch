unpopularopinion,ffi71im,t1_ffhwssg,1579966781.0,What? This comment is confusing. I attempted to define toxic femininity. It doesn’t have a consensus definition but I gave it a shot based on the definition of toxic masculininity. People like me? Chill out dude. You don’t get to just say I’m wrong and not explain why. And there’s zero reason for you to be rude to me for attempting a definition of a term that doesn’t have an official one.
unpopularopinion,ffhqnh7,t1_ffhq84k,1579948754.0,"The mentally? 

And yes, we will certainly have to disagree. Because not long ago it was “common knowledge” that women couldn’t run marathons because it would injure their delicate lady parts. What people “see” is often just dead wrong from a scientific perspective. And if we as a society can be so naive about basic physical abilities, then it’s really not a good idea to claim we understand something as complex as mental differences. 

To actually understand inherent differences between men and women, we would have to effectively control for things like culture, education, and environmental factors (like nutrition). It’s not an easy task."
unpopularopinion,ffhpjah,t1_ffhi6du,1579947033.0,I am!
unpopularopinion,ffho52n,t1_ffhnmz4,1579944875.0,"My expectations? I didn’t state any in my comment at all. I agree, it will take hundreds of years to reach that point, absolutely. But the timeframe is irrelevant to whether or not we should be working towards it. It took us thousands of years to reach the industrial revolution. Progress can often be slow, especially social progress. 

As for the differences between men and women, I must stress caution on any kind of confidence in what those exactly are and how much they affect desire and behaviors. From a research perspective, we know there are some average brain differences between men and women. We agree there. What we *don’t* know with any amount of confidence is how those differences really affect us and to what degree. Basically *every* study that has tried to show intelligence, interest, or ability differences between men and women have had zero replication or were statistically insignificant. Even the brain scan differences, upon further study, have shown significant variation and overlap between the sexes (meaning whatever average differences there are, they are small). So, yes, men and women are different, but exactly *how* we are different from a brain and behavior perspective is extremely unclear. 

This is why I say it’s important to just stop trying to encourage differences in expectations. People will sort themselves out whether or not we try to predict what they’re going to do. And when we stop trying to funnel people into what we *think* is best for them and, instead, just let them choose, outcomes tend to be much better."

Unfortunately, the subjects that would really lead to better outcomes are rarely required: financial literacy, philosophy (logic is included in this), ethics, and basic homemaking.

unpopularopinion,ffhjgyn,t1_ffhjbsp,1579938053.0,"Not exactly a helpful response. Part of the problem is there is no consensus definition of toxic femininity.

It might be illegal to discriminate. But workplace discrimination is still a big problem. And it’s not just for women either. Men still face gender role problems too. I think a truly equal society requires that people stop looking at others as categories and more as individuals, which we definitely haven’t achieved. Like, it’s absolutely okay if in a truly equal society people end up choosing things in a gendered way. But that should still be the choice of an individual rather than an expectation. We definitely aren’t there yet. We still squabble over who *should* do what, rather than just letting people choose what they really *want* and not judging, say, a woman who wants to weld and a man who wants to raise children."

Where are you at that trash is piling up?"
interestingasfuck,ffdkgwg,t1_ffd6w18,1579822784.0,"Ehhh, you’re not entirely off base, but Japan does still have some pretty massive social issues that I feel make their society less “harmonious” and more just scared of repercussions. Their streets are clear because littering gets you sent to Japanese prison, which is among the most draconian on the planet. You do NOT want to be sent to Japanese prison, which uses extreme isolation on a regular basis. The same thing with the low crime rate. And Japan likes to tout its lack of homeless people, but that’s because those same people are often pushed into asylums or, again, prison. 

That’s not to say that they aren’t doing some things MASSIVELY better than the USA. But it’s always good, IMO, to note that even something that looks very functional on the outside can be built on some ethically unsound ground.

You are the people who are so ignorant and dumb that you just can’t handle a world that doesn’t pander to you. Shame on you. Shame. As I sit here and tear up about how cruel humanity can be to each other, I tell you I see no difference between you and those who denied the benefits of the GI to black veterans.

Especially private ones. Most of those exist to help lessen the historical gap that was created by a lack of opportunity to disenfranchised groups. Crying racism or sexism to something that’s simply trying to correct racism and sexism is pointlessly paradoxical."
unpopularopinion,ff6ph8w,t1_ff60qun,1579632154.0,"Great question. So, I think one thing people don’t consider is that there are many different types of open relationships. Some go as far as having multiple romantically (emotionally) linked individuals. Those would be too complicated for me. For my open relationship, we are essentially an emotionally monogamous pair. You would never know we weren’t an average straight couple by looking at us. Because, emotionally, we are! The only people we feel a deep, emotionally romantic connection to are each other. 

To us, sex is just sex. I think this is the hardest part for some to wrap their heads around, so bear with me. For your average couple, sex is an integral part to the emotional connection between them. It’s all wrapped up in their romantic feelings for one another and, because of that, sharing would never work. It would be an emotional betrayal. And that’s normal and fine! If you are a person who needs sexual monogamy because it’s intrinsically linked to your emotional monogamy, right on. That is most of the people on the planet. 

But for a poly person, we simply don’t view sex the same way. It’s a fun, physical activity, but that’s all it is to us. There are no emotions wrapped into the sex act and it is not essential to our emotional bonding. Sex is just something fun to do. And this is something you see in most if not all poly relationships, a separation of sex from the emotional part of a relationship. BUT, at least in my kind of polyamory, emotional monogamy is still important. And that’s where respecting your partner comes in. 

My SO and I have a simple but effective system. We always have to ask permission of each other if we want to have some funsies with someone else. A quick text will do the trick. And both of us have complete veto power. This means that, for example, if my SO texts me wanting a roll in the hay with someone and for ANY reason I’m just not feeling it that night, I can say no and, no questions asked, my SO will accept that. It doesn’t matter why I’m not feeling it. The point is that I said no and my SO will honor that. And I do the exact same thing for my SO. 

To us, sex is a fun activity, but we reserve our hearts for one another. And in being open and respectful of each other, it has made a very successful relationship for us. it allows us to be the sexually curious people we both naturally are while still fulfilling our need for a partner to love deeply and have for ourselves on an emotional level."
unpopularopinion,ff5bs05,t1_ff5b153,1579586503.0,"No there aren’t. Universities aren’t allowed to use any federal funding to provide scholarships solely to minority students. Or solely to white students for that matter. Any school-based aid must be based on need or skill, but cannot exclude an entire ethnicity from consideration. 

I believe there is one exception, and this is for historically black colleges. My info might be outdated here though. But I believe historically black colleges do provide scholarships that are intended for black students. And this is because of a stipulation in the law that says the scholarship can be ethnically based if it’s trying to counteract historical racism, which was certainly the reason for the existence of black colleges. 

As for private funds. Is it discriminatory to provide funds only to men? There are several scholarships for that. How about to athletes, musicians, or debate kids? There are scholarships for those as well. People are perfectly allowed to choose a group close to them or that they think needs to money. It’s their private money and it’s certainly a stretch to call something racist because it focuses on minority students. These generally exist because of historical disenfranchisement. I certainly don’t feel bad that I will never access an athletic scholarship. I could work out my entire life and never make the grade for that. I wasn’t born with that capability. But I don’t consider that discriminatory at all."
unpopularopinion,ff5afqx,t1_ff54iqf,1579585178.0,I’m not really seeing anyone agree with him though. Mostly because most people haven’t seen this actually play out. I’m among them.

unpopularopinion,ff595on,t1_ff58np5,1579583979.0,"Oh yeah, it’s absolutely insane. If you look into it, there’s a pretty typical history of political chicanery involved. Inflation has eaten away at real wages since the 60’s. And ever since the rise of the student loan industry (aided by lobbying that ultimately led to guarantees that students could never default on their debt), tuition prices have also skyrocketed to profit from the guaranteed income. It is absolutely insane. It’s why I support progressive political candidates that want to fix that system and cancel a lot of student debt. It’s absolutely absurd how predatory our current system is. I’m sorry man, it absolutely sucks to be saddled with that kind of debt :( I know the feeling."
unpopularopinion,ff57ocu,t1_ff577jm,1579582638.0,"Indeed, it is what it is. I was also very frustrated that I didn’t get any after applying to so many. Some of them seemed so small and niche, too, but I didn’t get those either. Trust me, I feel you. It genuinely sucks. I just think we shouldn’t go looking for scapegoats for our frustration. Scholarships are crazy competitive. I even know black female friends with stories like mine, seriously. I know more than one peer from Penn that I commiserated with because we kept not winning any scholarships. It happens to a lot of us, because ultimately there are millions of students every year competing for what amounts to a handful of scholarships. There’s certainly something unfair there, but we don’t need to make it a fight amongst each other. We should work to make it so education is affordable for everyone instead."

I make okay money now, was a 4.0 student with many extra-curriculars (in high school, GPA was average 3.5 in college). I also applied for many scholarships. I also received none. The only aid I ever received was the income-based school aid that any student could receive from the university if they met the income restrictions. Surprising as an apparently educated person that you would make the mistake of trying to generalize your personal anecdote into some broad conspiracy against your race and gender. The fact is, all scholarships are highly competitive. For every one there are many thousands of applicants usually. For whatever reason, you and I didn’t stand out to those offering the scholarships. I would never claim, however, that this was some conspiracy against me or my gender. It was just bad luck. Such is life."

unpopularopinion,ff52zjo,t1_ff529xq,1579578820.0,"Actually what? Nothing you stated refuted what I said at all. You’re just trying to turn this into a men vs. women fight without noting at all the context behind what you’re saying. You act like this is some kind of conspiracy. But these are *private* scholarships. There have, historically, been way more men’s scholarships until very recently when private citizens and groups made a concerted effort to add scholarships for women. They were highly successful, to the point where there are now more offered to women. But you could easily remedy this by putting in the same effort as a private citizen or part of a group to create scholarships offered only to men.

But there are still MANY scholarships a white male could apply for. General ones with no restrictions, geographically based, need based, skill based (like ones for musicians regardless of gender) and even ones that specify men. So, again, for OP to state he had access to none because he’s not part of a minority group is entirely false."
unpopularopinion,ff4pu14,t1_ff4nf8e,1579569543.0,"Correct. I worked in admissions for 5 years. No school that isn’t already accepting most of their applications (so any school that’s even mildly selective) is accepting a 2.0 GPA as a full-ride regardless of race or gender. Actually, for that matter, neither are less selective schools. They are slightly more likely to accept a student into the school, but they still aren’t giving a full ride. There are strict limits on these kinds of scholarships."
unpopularopinion,ff4mpg7,t1_ff4lw2y,1579567348.0,"By the way, you were definitely qualified (to apply) for several scholarships.

If the government was trying to censor that information, an investigative journalist would blow that open in a second. Again, this is why we KNOW what we did in Latin America, which was some fucked up shit. We KNOW about what we did in Guantanamo. I’m not a history buff, but basically if you look at a region in the world, you can look up US abuses and get a very good sense of what we’ve done. This is not the same in Japan. Remember, I never said America was lily white, but we can’t be compared to Japan in terms of denying human rights abuses. Nah, we don’t have to because we are the world power. We know what we’ve done, we kinda just don’t care. Is that better? I’d say no. But it’s a separate problem from information repression."

AskReddit,fewzudx,t3_eqies2,1579422038.0,"I used to have an ornament I made in class on the doorknob of my childhood room. My dog, Abby, would always knock into it when she came into my room and send it swinging. The day after Abby passed away, I was sitting on my bed doing homework with the door open. Suddenly, the ornament started swinging as if something had knocked into it. I looked around, but nothing and no one had entered my room. When I called out, my mom came from down the hallway. I asked her if she or anyone had just entered my room and she said no, everyone else but me had been sitting in the living room at the time. It was the most eerie, bizarre thing to happen to me and I have no explanation. There were no fans on, no windows open, NOTHING that could have explained why the ornament moved. 

Well, a day after that, my entire family started reporting weird occurrences. My mom had a dream of petting Abby and woke up with her scent on her hands. My brother distinctly heard her barking from the living room, but of course it was empty when he checked. And my father, whom Abby absolutely adored, said he felt her lick his hand and heard her heavy sigh while he was drifting off for a nap in the living room (they used to nap together all the time). I’m not an especially spiritual person, but that was honestly freaky. We like to think these were Abby’s goodbyes to us."

unpopularopinion,fetlzj7,t1_fetdj5o,1579376775.0,"Let’s not start that. She’s much more likely to just be sensitive about the topic because of the number of anti-feminist men she’s encountered who have a warped view of what feminism is. I don’t agree with her (clearly), but that doesn’t automatically make her a misandrist and we don’t need to descend into the immaturity of name calling without really knowing anything about each other."
unpopularopinion,fetlgv5,t1_ferzvg0,1579376587.0,"Just FYI, it’s “inherently”. And that’s fine to call those activities masculine. Just don’t assume only men like them. Women don’t produce zero testosterone and they are certainly not non-aggressive. Many women like these kinds of activities. Which is why I say the activity isn’t really gendered. It’s fine if more men like it, but let’s not pretend ONLY men like these activities. 

And as I mentioned before. It’s fine for there to be activities that draw more of one of the sexes. But it’s bad to turn that into something exclusionary. Gendered preferences are okay, but we shouldn’t make the mistake of assuming that means no men or women like an activity that stereotypically the opposite sex likes. And it’s not productive in any way to turn that into something prescriptive that bars the opposite sex from partaking in it like gender roles do. Gender roles hurt individual choice. And we’ve found there to be much more overlap in interests and abilities between men and women than most would assume. So it’s inefficient to try to force a separation based solely on gender. Individuals are much more variable than that system allows."

unpopularopinion,feqgv92,t3_eqcnoj,1579341727.0,"I was prescribed the medication I became addicted to (adderall). I was 17. Absolutely no one warned me this could become a problem. It took me 7 years, but I quit cold turkey and never looked back! I’ve now been 4 years without any and I’m a much happier person. I, like many, didn’t make the choice to take the medication alone. Professionals I trusted told me to take it. And still others are simply unaware of just how easy addiction can happen and try a drug once and then boom! Addiction isn’t just a desire, it’s a compulsion driven by the body. I would absolutely consider anyone who has fallen into that awful trap a victim. We may choose to take a drug one time not knowing what it can really do, but what it does to you is so much more powerful than a non-addict can understand. Anyone going through that is a victim IMO.

I definitely held some people up behind me once while I awkwardly fumbled for change while getting on. Man, even the thought that one of the people behind me might have yelled like that gives me a little anxiety. Did I do something wrong by not having my change already out and ready? Yep.

Feminists are in the whole much more likely to sympathize with differences in treatment IMO and, thus, less likely to act superior.

unpopularopinion,fep7m0l,t1_feowbue,1579313940.0,"Yes, gender roles ARE arbitrary. Gender roles and gendered preferences are two different things. One is descriptive and one is prescriptive. 

I’d very much hesitate to call any interests inherent. The only differences we can conclusively make between men and women scientifically are average muscle mass per weight. Everything else, including interests and brain differences, are hotly debated and by no means conclusive. For every single “male” or “female” hobby I know, there are many men and women who equally like them and are simply shamed for admitting it.

I have to strongly disagree with you about gender roles, there are none that are acceptable. Every individual should be evaluated as such and having an interest that’s not considered stereotypically kosher should never be shamed. I don’t consider this an over-correction at all. It’s fine if we do find that there are some inherent interest differences down the road. But turning that into a system of gender roles always hurts freedom of choice (please note gender roles are something that are enforced and inherently limiting based on gender, gender roles are why single dads get so much shit, why men can’t be seen as nurturing or emotional, why women have to fight SO hard in workplaces dominated by men, etc).

When you try to categorize people’s interests into male and female, it automatically limits individual freedom and usually creates toxicity when people try to cross those gendered lines. It’s important to not fall into that trap of a mindset, for everyone’s benefit, men and women."

Women are showing they can succeed in things they’ve been barred from. It’s other people who are still gendering those accomplishments."
