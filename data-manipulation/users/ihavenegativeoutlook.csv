You're right. I haven't seen a ton of controller ow games. The way this guy moved from his first person perspective really didn't look like a mouse and keyboard. I play low to mid sense and even moving the mouse horizontally at that speed will create some vertical slides and it didn't really look like it here. Plus, from a gameplay point of view, this is how controller players play given the camera/movement limitations. You are it in EVERY controller fps.

Everyone's so quick to think I'm shitting on controllers and I didn't lol. I'm pointing out the very obvious play styles for them. All of which are in this video.
