AskMen,ffwjugp,t1_ffvvmk1,1580303342.0,"Their need that’s not being met might be having sex with someone other than their partner. The idea that you need a lifelong monogamous relationship to ultimately be happy is deeply ingrained in our society, and a lot of people strive for it while harboring a desire for sex or intimacy outside their relationship.

Estimates of 25-50% of people cheat in their lifetimes."

MurderedByWords,ffuacjo,t1_ffu9o3x,1580237801.0,In the US our President literally thinks if we dip bullets in pig blood we'll be able to stop terrorism in the Middle East. It's insane.
MurderedByWords,ffu9rbp,t1_ffu99y5,1580237457.0,"Probably Starbucks cups. While they didn't write happy holidays on it, some conservatives, including our President, suggested boycotting Starbucks when they had a red holiday cup rather than anything that explicitly celebrated Christmas."
nba,ffu930z,t1_ffu5rpv,1580237059.0,People aren't all that good at judging risk. You might as well make a pact to never ride in the same car as your spouse.

WatchPeopleDieInside,ffu317l,t1_ffu2ujm,1580233411.0,"The justice system needs to accommodate the fact that they convict innocent people. If you’re remorseful, plead guilty. If you have to be convicted in trial, it shouldn’t matter that you say you’re remorse after the fact."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffu2sjy,t1_ffu1u31,1580233264.0,"I’m not speaking to this exact situation. Generally, in order to get parole you need to express that you’re guilty. People who maintain their innocence will effectively get longer jail time than those who don’t. 

But I don’t see why anything he might say in that moment should have any impact on his sentence, which in all likelihood it probably didn’t."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffu1vua,t1_ffu1ed3,1580232704.0,"A contrite criminal who apologizes and is ready to do their time should plead guilty. If they fight it in court and then apologize after being sentenced, it shouldn’t mean shit.

Innocent people have and will continue to be convicted of crimes. An infallible justice system is not humanly possible. The risk of heaping extra punishment on an innocent person because they refuse to lie about being guilty is reason enough to just not use that metric to judge the severity of a punishment."
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffu0vep,t1_fftz296,1580232076.0,The fact that a sentence could be wrong is the entire point. Your punishment shouldn’t be more severe just because you maintain your innocence after trial.
