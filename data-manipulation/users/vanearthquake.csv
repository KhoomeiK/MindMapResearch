These are the same people that don’t by home insurance and cry to the media for help when their house burns down. These are the same people that don’t use their signals or need a taxi to get from their car to the curb. These are the same people that get a car loan based on the payments instead of the value of the car. These are people that treat a new credit card limit as cash to spend. Sadly, they are people that are not setting themselves up for success; so when it snows, they can’t afford to not make it into work that day."
