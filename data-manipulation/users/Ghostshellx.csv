news,fcivbny,t1_fcitxnn,1577670686.0,"I have a very custom sleek leather shoulder holster that fits my Bullpup9 and 2 extra mags. So it has a low profile that's just cause I take it into places where I shouldn't have it meetings and what not. I personally wouldn't mind a bulkier one for it to be obvious if I wasn't in more professional settings.

I wear Top jackets, Suits, and Puff Vests and people don't know unless open and reaching for something above me or away from me that would make it flair open"

news,fci0wnk,t1_fci00mz,1577656436.0,But victim 1 was off to the left 5chairs down while the guys was point blank with victim two he had a very well opening had he reacted as the response shooter did who in the video shows excellent gun control and precision!
news,fchwxtc,t1_fchv8cu,1577655104.0," Seen the video I just wished  the first victim that got shot would have instantly drawn instead of  slowly standing and second guessing pulling his pistol.... he would be  alive as well as the second victim I do believe...

Edit: some people seem to think I don't think he was heroic or that I'm trying to say oh I would do better. I'm not one bit, I was mainly making a point of view that's clearly seen in the video. That is all."
pathofexile,fb8ozsw,t1_fb8lx1p,1576618626.0,I know people that have house sit  just because someone wanted someone in their home while they're gone usually because it's a nice home or something like that if they're out for a long time.
