depression,fdm40en,t1_fdlzjuv,1578539265.0,"Yeah its kind of like how there were all those cliques back in school and if you werent in with the ""popular kids"" and were in the fringe groups, you now have to completely change and become like them in order to survive in this world as it is now run by them. 

The way I see it, its sort of class based as well. If you think about it most of those cliques, at least when I was in school, were kind of seperated by social class and wealth.  Wealth, even of middle class, breeds (for the most part) confident children who end up as jocks, preps, or what have you. Even those of them who had mental illness were probably diagnosed by a good psychiatrist and medicated from an early age.  In adulthood their parents have connections so they many times end up as managers, business owners, etc.  Then they expect everyone to fit into their box of what they perceive to be normalcy and look down on those who do not quite fit the mold because theyve never experienced any other way of living.  Not to say all children with wealthy parents fit this bill but statistically speaking and from personal experience, id say a good majority do. 

Of course, thats no excuse for a lack of social skills, as were are social creatures and our very survival and progression as a species has always depended on social structure and communication.  It does, however, create a stigma and as a result, a severe pressure and anxiety for those of us who were not so blessed with the geneological roll of the dice."
depression,fdlz0vw,t3_elycos,1578535886.0,"Yeah for sure.  Im nearly 30 but some days and in certain I feel like a child still. Even though I am a fully independent and functional adult in the eyes of the world, when all the responsibilities are over, I kind of just revert somewhat.  I dont know why or how to fully explain it but I think its mainly just missing out on so much of the social aspect of maturing because of the depression and anxiety.  In my case, in those crucial developmental years, everyone else went out and made connections and learned key social skills, while I stayed home in my safe bubble in isolation. 

May not be your case but its something ive noticed about the workings of my weird little brain"
Anxiety,fdly3ns,t3_elyqvm,1578535258.0,"Im in a similar boat man, though I havent had it quite as fucked as you have.  Fairly severe mental illnesses brought on by childhood emotional abuse and daily bullying that have nearly destroyed my marriage and all attempts at social normalcy. Like you,  I also see her as the only good thing left in my life.   Idk why I cant bring myself to pull the trigger either.  Sometimes I sit and hold in and stare at it for a long time, even all the alcohol I can slam back doesnt give me the balls to pull it.  

All I can think is we must still have something left to do in this life.  Even if we dont see it now and hope is a fucking joke and we are the punch line.  Thats all I can figure.  We must have something keeping us here that we must do before we go."
Anxiety,fdlxb7a,t3_em1ci6,1578534725.0,If you ever figure it out please let me know for real
Anxiety,fdlx6yq,t3_eltp11,1578534646.0,I am exactly the same way and people think this.  Its a normal human response apparently.  We gotta learn to walk the walk I guess or at least emulate it
Anxiety,fdlx2dm,t3_elz73p,1578534561.0,"Yeah, every single conversation ever"

gaming,fditkuf,t1_fdio92f,1578450735.0,"I think its that and also kind of an implanted nagging at the back of our subconscious. More or less along the lines of ""this doesnt earn me money, therefore its a waste of time.""  So the older we get the less we allow ourselves any hobbies purely for self gratification/enjoyment."
AskReddit,fc5tknh,t3_ega9qc,1577465574.0,"Here are some ""golden rules"" for gym etiquette that I have come to learn over the years.  Though, mostly just what I wish others would actually do.  I do feel like all of it could be summed up by the first two but hey, I like details.

1) Be considerate

2) Dont be a douche

3) Wear deodorant amd wipe your sweat off, especially cardio machines.

4) Put your weight plates/dumbbells back where you got them after use.  

5) Dont ignore people.  its ok to want to be left alone while working out, but dont hardcore just ignore everyone. The gym isnt an excuse to be an asshole.  

6) Use weight you can actually handle, especially at first.  Learn the proper form and do it correctly, THEN start adding more weight.  Literally noone is impressed by dudebros slamming mediocre weight around.  Dont copy these idiots.  

7) Dont take 5-6 minute cell phone breaks between each set.  Other people paid just as much to use the same equipment and prob have other shit to do that day. Plus, unless you are a legit powerlifter, that much rest time is actually detrimental.

8) If you are a total newbie,  Dont feel ashamed to take a few training sessions, especially for free-weight exercises like the squat or deadlift, these are essential to learn how to do correctly to avoid injury and even more importantly, to avoid being the quarter squat bro. Literally noone likes quarter squat bro.  

9) Noones watching your every move and if they actually are then they probably arent all that fit either.

10) Have fun with it.  Nothing above is all that hard to do.  Just be a kind and considerate human being as you would be anywhere else and be focused on your progress.  Before too long it will all be second nature."
