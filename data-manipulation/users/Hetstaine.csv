All, or most, of the bigger trucking joints will do same for same, most keep stock of fast moving items like lenses, lights, mirrors etc. Even most of the smaller companies and  even single truck owners like their gear to be 'factory' or at least the same if it's addons. 

Plenty of times though you get a truckie come in the door with something you just can't match. Out of production, something they bought at a truck show or some out in the sticks truck joint. They buy one unit to be legal and keep trucking and hope they can match it further on down the road.

If it's a council truck or an old dog work slut with a bunch of different drivers, then it's open slatter."

Tamiya sprays lovely and only requires their X20a thinners. Plenty of colour available via mixing and if you troll the net you'll find a ton of mixes to match Luftwaffe and other colours.

Vallejo i buy as i need, sonetimes i don't feel like mixing so i have bought a bunch of their premixed versions. I buy them singly as i need them like the Luftwaffe rlm74/75/76 schemes and some IJN colours.

With Vallejo i move around a bit with thinning. I've used their thinners brand, their flow improver as well as windex original (works great) 

Atm i have most colours that will cover WWII RAF, Luftwaffe early and late and IJN as well as some cold war stuff. About 60-70 colours in total between both brands.

On top of that you have acrylic/enamel washes, oils, white spirits, mineral turps, pigments and weathering kits."
