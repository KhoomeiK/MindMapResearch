 That is the ideal mindset. Weed is not the cause of all of your problems. But weed stifles your motivation and makes you content with the shit show until it finally becomes unbearable. As long as you work on yourself, things will get better. It's hard to see what you need to change and work on it when there is so much fog and a lack of motivation. Good luck on your journey."

apexlegends,ffe88nq,t1_ffdmjru,1579839381.0,No it is not at all. You clearly don't play Pathfinder. You can grapple the ground and hit a or d and jump and go flying at any moment. The only way a good Pathfinder can be caught is by another good Pathfinder.

Now that im an adult and have matured, I've realized how much damage I've done. Lucky for us, a majority of the damage marijuana causes can be reversed with time. Im still far from out of the depression but can see that light at the end of the very long tunnel. I have some hope and motivation again. Weed got me through some tough times in my childhood, but it has also caused alot in my adulthood. I will win. We will win. Good luck man."

Caustic shouldn't effect teammates with a slow. 

Watson is kinda op right now.

Bangalores ult shouldnt give a slow to teammates, so you actually use it offensively instead of defensively. I think it should also start blowing up quicker.

Cryptos drone should be deployable without the need to be instantly switched to it's view. That way you can deploy and emp quickly. Also, maybe make it like directable. Like tell it to fly toward a building automatically so you can tactically emp and still push with your team and not be so vulnerable / leaving your team to 2v3

Bloodhound should have something similar to wraiths ""im being watched"" thing but just for general area. Like ""I smell someone in the area"" or some shit.

Octane should have a stim gun instead. Kinda like doc from rainbow six siege and be able to shoot a stim at a teammate to help them engage or disengage quicker."
apexlegends,fev8rsi,t1_fev0xxq,1579394453.0,"You should be able to send your drone out without being forced into it, kinda like rainbow six siege added.

Then you can actually push an enemy with your team and time the strike for right after the emp goes off."

Im trying to change my diet, working out, going to the doctor, seeing a therapist, changing my clothing style, hair cut, going back to school and much more.

Just don't expect sobriety to get you right on its own. It gives you a clear head and much more motivation to work on yourself.

Weed has hindered my thought pattern and ruined my motivation for so long. Good luck on your journey man it's going to be tough in the beginning but it gets easier and it's very much worth it.

I had so much evidence the judge literally laughed at her attempt to defend herself. I filmed myself turning the water back on to the toilet and it flushing perfectly fine several times. I also stalked her Facebook and  got posts saying ""roommate is still sleeping at 11am, so we're blasting music to try and get him to leave"" when I worked from 4pm - 1am at the time. Also, had pictures of me coming home to my door being off the hinges and I had missing Xbox games etc. It was a pretty shitty situation but made me really feel grateful when I was able to get my own apartment by myself. Also, I got all money I ever paid in rent to them and a little extra pocket money back. I was very very lucky that the woman's grandmother owned the property and not her, because the grandma knew I would attempt to put a lien on the property so I was paid in full before the minimum required 30days that you must wait before collection can start."

 That is the ideal mindset. Weed is not the cause of all of your problems. But weed stifles your motivation and makes you content with the shit show until it finally becomes unbearable.

Bangalores ult shouldnt give a slow to teammates, so you actually use it offensively instead of defensively. I think it should also start blowing up quicker.

Bloodhound should have something similar to wraiths ""im being watched"" thing but just for general area. Like ""I smell someone in the area"" or some shit.

leaves,fd5fd47,t1_fd44k0q,1578177077.0,That's actually the way I looked at my relapse. I quit for a week and then relapsed. Then I told myself of try for a month and then maybe smoke again. Turns out around week 2 to 3 I decided it would be for good. 10 weeks tomorrow.
leaves,fd5f048,t3_ejwznp,1578176971.0,"I quit for 7 days and then relapsed for like two weeks, quit again and now im at nearly 10 weeks and never going back. A lot of the time it's part of the process. Don't worry, you got this!"
leaves,fd5dj7z,t1_fd4kdbs,1578176569.0,"Honestly, to me, the first few days were the hardest. And it slowly but surely diminished until around the 2nd to 3rd week where it actually got easy. So stick to it and stay strong. It's worth it in the end buddy."

I've only been sober for a little over 2 months after a 15 year habit. Im still having lows, like today for that matter. But im going to go see a therapist soon and continue my journey. No more numbing, no more forgetting. Only improvement. Good luck, stay strong. It may get a bit harder before it gets easier. Stick with it and you will be happy you did, I promise!"

aww,fd21078,t1_fcznw4f,1578139969.0,"I sued for her illegally entering my room without 24 hours notice primarily, which is a $2k fine per incident in the state of California. I also had evidence of them trying to annoy me into leaving, shutting off the water to the toilet claiming it was broken, stealing stuff from my room, and making it a very hostile living space. I had so much evidence the judge literally laughed at her attempt to defend herself. I filmed myself turning the water back on to the toilet and it flushing perfectly fine several times. I also stalked her Facebook and  got posts saying ""roommate is still sleeping at 11am, so we're blasting music to try and get him to leave"" when I worked from 4pm - 1am at the time. Also, had pictures of me coming home to my door being off the hinges and I had missing Xbox games etc. It was a pretty shitty situation but made me really feel grateful when I was able to get my own apartment by myself. Also, I got all money I ever paid in rent to them and a little extra pocket money back. I was very very lucky that the woman's grandmother owned the property and not her, because the grandma knew I would attempt to put a lien on the property so I was paid in full before the minimum required 30days that you must wait before collection can start."

Source: Judge Joe Brown contacted me when I sued my old landlord. Unfortunately I found out that the woman I was sueing wouldn't have to pay any money out of pocket when I won, and she would actually make money. So I declined, took her to court, kicked her ass, and cashed a $4k check."

I always wanted to quit but never did it because ""weed is the only thing keeping me sane"" but in fact, it was one of the biggest contributing factors to my depression and anxiety. If you decide to take the plunge and kick it, this community is a great place and will welcome you with open arms. You got this man."
leaves,fcwppxo,t1_fcuwsp1,1578032866.0,Are you actively working on improving yourself? maybe that's why I feel like it's getting easier it's because I'm working on so much stuff on improving myself that it's honestly occupying a lot of my time and thoughts

If you can't do that and really want to quit, dump it. Stay strong on your journey, and know that it will all be worth it in the end. I never thought I would quit, and im now 2 months sober. Good luck, stay strong."

You will experience some withdrawals, but I promise you it will get easy after a few weeks. Stay strong and remind yourself it will pass. You will start to get very very vivid dreams that will almost leave you exhausted when you wake up, that too will pass. After a few weeks it's only upward and your motivation will return as the fog lifts. It's worth it, I promise. Good luck and stay strong! IT GETS EASIER"
leaves,fcti4ch,t1_fcteydx,1577944048.0,"You may need to just force it for a bit. Maybe just focus on keeping yourself busy. If you had a special spot that you would smoke at, rearrange that area. Change it up to help break the habit. My anhedonia was at an all time peak before I quit, and after about 2-3 weeks of sobriety I actually got back into cooking again. I once wanted to go to Culinary School, and for 5 whole years I dreaded even thinking about it. You got this man. **STAY STRONG AND REMEMBER IT GETS BETTER**."
leaves,fcthn3z,t1_fct8099,1577943585.0,"Weed was very good to me in some of my darkest times, but once they passed, I stayed in that darkness because weed removed all motivation to work on myself. I would sit there dreaming and hoping for things to change but had no motivation to actually work on those things. YOU are the only person that can change your life. Having some good support helps, but you must work hard for yourself if you truly want progress. Stay strong. I promise you, **it gets easier**!"
leaves,fcthdug,t1_fct8c1d,1577943339.0,"The light at the end of the tunnel is still very far along this road but I feel like I can finally see some shred of hope in myself. Quitting weed was the first step for me to get my motivation back. Its still been a hard battle after I got sober but I can personally say its a million times easier to work on myself and fix the things that I hated about myself now that i'm sober. So make sure you focus on improving yourself beyond just getting sober once you do it. Focus on all the things that are within your control and tackle them one step at a time.  It took several weeks of sobriety before I started to get that motivation back somewhat, so stay strong and remember that  **IT GETS EASIER**."

Getting rid of guns will NOT stop the amount of suicide we have, they will find another means. It just so happens that guns are the quickest and usually least painful way of guaranteeing and committing suicide. Also, there have been plenty of people committing mass murder with Cars, Bombs, Knives,  and everything in between. When theres a will, theres a way.
