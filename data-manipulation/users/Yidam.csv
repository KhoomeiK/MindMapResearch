Why? If you lose your memory your are no longer you, and if you are no longer you, you have nothing to worry about. It might be tougher on your caretakers, but you do not suffer. On the other hand dying in agony is agonizing, having your wits about you doesn't make it any better, worse in fact, having caretakers do not ease the acute pain of suffering either, you remember them but you dont want to see them or talk to them depending on the severity of pain involved, it will consume all your mind and your soul, but hey, you're still you!"
