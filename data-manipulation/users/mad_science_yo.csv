fatlogic,feyxfs6,t1_feyu32y,1579451617.0,Tbh I think there’s some truth to this. A lot of lobbyists were involved in crafting the original food pyramid and not many scientists. You should tell them it also has us eat a lot more meat and dairy than we should...

fatlogic,fcuwaoa,t3_ej0fld,1577989833.0,"I love Lizzo, and I think it’s great that she’s so active during her shows, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t negative health consequences to obesity. It just means Lizzo is probably in good health right now. We actually have no idea what goes on behind the scenes with her health. Maybe she looks amazing on stage and feels like shit after. Plenty of thin performers go through this too! Of course, I wish Lizzo only the best, but she, like all obese people, is at higher risk for certain health issues. Doesn’t mean I don’t like her though."
