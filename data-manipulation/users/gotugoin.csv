Part of the teaching.  And if everyone has a gun, then you'll respect the NAP.

>Providing clean running water to only to those who can afford seems like a one way street to rioting. I mean things like roads that extend beyond the needs of business. Things like the interstate cost far more than a business is going to put up, and relying on them to do it seems like you’re going to create a situation where corporations like Walmart form their own proto-states

When more people are forced to work more people always will.  Those who truly can't will be provided for by other means.  Let's say you want to bring goods into your state, how you going to get them there? Or travel, you want to go to other places?  You'll be amazed what people will do when they need something.  And you mean like Walt Disney world?  Look into that. Look how well it's ran.

>Scarcity still exists and is integral to any market system. As long as you have that people will be willing to fight for it, but let’s not forget all the other reasons people decide to butcher their neighbors.

Yes, but you're still buying, you still would without the government.  Why would you fight for it when you can go buy it?  And again how many criminals do you think there actually are willing to hurt people on the constant when they don't have to."

I'm not advocating for returning to a government either.  I'm saying some people would because they can't live without it. Hopefully, through NAP they respect the people who choose not to be governed in such a manner or well that's what guns are for.

>Which is not the same thing as the common good. I’m no socialist, but I think we can agree that the poor should also have access to clean water.

There's plenty of streams, go drink.  Catch all the rain water you want.  Ask a neighbor for a drink.  Go to any shelter that a charity has created out of their own and get some water.  And common goods, you mean like roads?  You'll be amazed at how many businesses would pave for a way to get you to come buy some shit from them.

>Factions are inevitable though. Trade was huge even in ancient city states. The issues come when there disputes over limited resources.

You're not thinking free market enough.  Factions would be more for protection than trade.  So as an example, my neighborhood decides we need a couple of security peeps to protect us.  We get together and hire private well and better trained individuals to watch our street.  They suck, we fire them hire new ones.  
We aren't going back to the Stone age of they got it we can't have, free markets still exist.  You make shit you sell shit you buy shit.  You want a phone go get it.  Yada yada yada."

That's where teaching people about not having a government means and what happens when it gets too big and how to defend against that.  Why go back to the shit we are retreating from?

>The problem here is that people generally hate paying for thing.

They pay for what they want.

>People generally don’t stand up well to gunfire. This only works if you assume one section of the towns interest wouldn’t be vastly different than another’s

It's not this against that though. You're creating factions and a we are going to hoard everything from other towns.  You want something, you go to the city you buy it."

But you don't pay in you don't get what they have. Of course you can hire whom you choose or what have you.  These things would have to be taught. You can't just fully submerge a whole society into it.  Those groups can also choose to help those in need how they choose with their money.  And everything is always an opt out situation.

How about we start teaching people how to survive without government instead of demanding a government that will always lead to wanting more power and attempt to supress more freedoms in the name of possibilities or political correctness, or to stop hurting feelings.
