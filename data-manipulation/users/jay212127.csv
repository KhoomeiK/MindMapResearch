It can also cost less in the long run, let's say you're a journeyman who needs $3,000 of personal equipment that you don't already own but need to use. You can rent and slowly save up, or take a loan to buy it now. If a rental is $100/mo compared to a 10% APR loan comes out to $25/mo in interest the debt is cheaper than slowly building equity and in the long term is a better deal.
