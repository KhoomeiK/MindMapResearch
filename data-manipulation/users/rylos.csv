IAmA,fewkdml,t1_feujpng,1579412558.0,"When I was living in Silicon Valley, I was chauffeur driven to a job interview in a car that was a lot nicer-looking than I was. The company I was leaving was like a real-life Dilbert scenario, so it just seemed fitting to use a compay car (and driver) to interview at another company. It was fun, as the company I interviewed at had the usual glass-fronted lobby, so the receptionist & some secretaries got to witness the grand entrance. The driver opened the rear door of the car, letting me out, then trotted on ahead to open doors and such. Then waited patiently in the lobby until time to leave, then did the whole door-opening thing as we left.  They hired my boss instead, even though he told them that I was better at electonics then he was, but he had the degree."

We were driving down a side street, and I pulled into the alley behind the store, saying ""Let's hassle this bum!"". So I hollered out the car window at my dad, something derogatory. My dad, who appreciated a good prank, yelled something back. Pretty quickly we were yelling at each other, and I sped off with him coming after us with his pole, with my not-yet-wife freaking over the whole deal. 

A few days later, I took her out to ""meet the parents"". Yep, she recognized the dumpster diver. 

Got lots of cool stuff from dumpsters over the years. Our pizza pans came from Pizza Hut, damn fine pans. Got a pay phone once that wasn't nailed down enough. For a long time my dad managed to get day-old donuts by the boxful. He would come by, with literally hundreds of donuts of all kinds. I'm pretty sure he got them before they hit the dumpster."

I was looking up stuff on the internet, and went down a rabbit hole of entirely unrelated stuff. I ran across a list of aspartame poisoning symptoms, and realized that my wife had a number of them, and they'd all started after she'd switched to diet soda. I then looked for more reliable sources of information. Even found that same list on a page on the U.S. health department site. Also on a government site where military pilots weren't allowed to drink diet soda, due to risk of seizures.   

so I call up my mom to ask her about asapartame, because moms know everything, particularly if they'd studied biochemistry, and used to work for Nutrasweet. Boy, did she give me an earful. So my wife quit anything that had aspartame, and after a few weeks, the symptoms went away.

Got it for free, though, as the original owner gave up on it after about the third breakdown in it's first two years. And it's pretty easy to work on, the self-diagnostic codes are very handy, and it only takes about 10 minutes to swap out the water pump.

AskReddit,fdey7q8,t3_ekx7gi,1578349123.0,"Depends on the situation. I was with my daughter the first time she got pulled over. She'd just gotten her license, and we were in a local town, at night, in the rain. If there was a speed limit sign where she pulled onto the street, neither one of us saw it. In our town, the legal default speed on unmarked streets is 30, so that's the speed she was doing in this town.  Several blocks in, there's a sign stating 15 mph, so she immediately drops down to 15. 

A few blocks further on, she gets pulled over. When asked ""Do you know why I pulled you over?"", her meek reply was ""speeding?"".  the cop noticed that she was a new driver, and probably realized how it had happened (unintentional), was very professional, let her off with a warning. 

I stayed out of it, as she was going to have to handle police interactions on her own normally, this was as good time as any to get her feet wet. 

One of the most memorable phone calls I got from her started with ""Guess who took a selfie in the back seat of a police car!"".  That time it was just the police giving her & her groceries a ride to where her car was after the police chase involving her mother-in-law."
