GenderCritical,fdi6tng,t3_elafc9,1578436770.0,"The other day I was watching groups of women of all ages do presentations. Nearly a hundred of them. Maybe it was the lighting, maybe it was the sleep deprivation, but they were all gorgeous. Every last one of them. Heavy makeup, no makeup, grey hair, short hair, long hair. All body types. It's my opinion anyone who thinks a woman isn't beautiful isnt looking at her right. 

All that is beside the point, which is that relationships need to be founded on more than physical attraction."
