I'm just saying, it's one more message to mothers who couldn't/didn't want to breast feed that we are shameful and hurting our babies.  It's one of the worst parts of being a mother, all the shame society sends our way, no matter what we choose."

I’ve mostly made my peace with it but it always gives me a little pang when I see articles like this. There’s so much pressure on parents and this just feels like one more way to fail, you know?"

I'm an American radiologic technologist who moved to Sweden, and my language certification requirement to transfer my license is the same as a physician looking to transfer theirs.  I made it in about a year and a half with a six month intensive program and otherwise working hard to immerse myself in the language.  :)  We've got lots of non-Swedish doctors here, if you're serious about it it's do-able, but not easy, and you'll probably have to work a non-physician job for at least a couple of years while you get your language and license rolling."

God bless Sweden, because it was 35 hours of labor, an emergency  c section, an epidural gone wrong that required recovery care for me, and a sick baby who had trouble maintaining blood sugar for the first three days and needed bloodwork every two hours around the clock. Would have cost us a fucking fortune in the US."
AskWomen,fcwxugw,t3_ej6n0r,1578042269.0,"Yep. The first time I ever went was because I had just dig myself out of a deep dark anxiety/depression hole, and was looking to make some changes to ensure it never happened again. 

Honestly, it was endlessly enlightening and one of the best things I’ve done. I, at age 30, was diagnosed with ADD for the first time. I learned so many coping tricks that have made my whole life better. I worked through some complicated emotional stuff that I didn’t even know was brewing. AND, later down the line when I needed therapy to work through a problematic situation, it was a big scary thing because I’d already been before and knew what to expect.

curlyhair,fcaebss,t3_efv8cs,1577567777.0,"Hey all!

I've always thought I had straight hair, but as I get older, and especially post pregnancy, I've come to suspect maybe not.  

LOTS of curly hair in my family, including my daughter now.  My hair itself is incredibly fine strands, but a bajillion of them (fine, thick), stylists always comment on how incredibly many hairs I have.  I wonder if maybe this is weighing it down?

I've ventured into curls a littttttle, and if my hair is allowed to dry without brushing it gets.... messy?  Maybe wavy?

Knowing this, do you think it's worth it to give the curly method a try?  My hair also gets incredibly disgusting and greasy, I've tried no silicon/sulfates in the past and it was still super greasy, so I want to know if it's even worth the time to try it again.

Thanks for any help you guys may have to give!"
