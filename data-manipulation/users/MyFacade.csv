For example, the same person could answer this question with -

* They fibbed on a state test when they didn't technically do something that could have gotten the school in trouble, despite knowing it was inconsequential.

* Not counting a student tardy to school because you know they lost a loved one the night before.

It's also much more difficult to pass out if you are seated and especially with your head down.

I'm not being dismissive of your concerns and other people on here have addressed other aspects of your feelings. Just remember it wouldn't really be a big deal if you did faint.

* You faint. Your friend guides you to the ground. Some people get concerned (which is a good thing as it shows they care). Your friend lets them know you're okay and that it's nothing to worry about, that you knew it might happen and it is just stress related. You come to with your friend next to you letting you know you're okay. You sit up slowly, maybe get a drink of water, and find a place to sit or else excuse yourself with your friend to a place you feel comfortable.
