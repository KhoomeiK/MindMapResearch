That's what I assumed. Iirc solar panels still use a lot of heavy and precious metals. I can't otherwise see how it's ""not renewable."" Maybe if they're thinking of solar steam generators, in terms of water usage? It's just such a bizarre comment."
todayilearned,ffp1qad,t1_ffn5hpa,1580084426.0,"Less than you'd think. I work for a tech support company, and one of our clients is a wealth management group. Each employee is given a laptop that they pretty much exclusively use to remote into a virtual workstation. The infrastructure is the biggest cost, and that's basically the same as it would be for on-premises server equipment anyway. Plus, it has the added bonus of preventing data leaks if a laptop is lost... Or left in the TSA bin at JFK."

I grew up in a small town in upstate NY. If you're not from the northeast, it's basically the deep south (racism and all) and my very large, very Catholic, very conservative family wasn't in the least bit supportive of The Gays^(TM). I assumed I was just confused or wanted more close male friends and was misinterpreting it. 

Flash to about 6 months after the crying incident, my dog and I were camping. I'd enjoyed more than a few fireside beers and something just.... snapped. I realized that I'd been lying to myself, and I could no longer deny what I think I secretly knew all along. It fucked my entire life up in the worst ways, not the least of which being I was basically entering an entirely new dating pool for the first time at 24. Ultimately, though, I've found someone who is in every way amazing. So net positive."

worldnews,fel98ca,t1_feknvur,1579216824.0,">Actually, PrEP is free in America.

I can assure you, it is not. Gilead offers co-pay assistance, but it's limited to a certain dollar amount per year. If your co-pay is low, you'll get your scrip for free, but if your insurance is bad or you don't have drug coverage, Truvada becomes very, very expensive.

The program you're talking about is called ""Ready, Set, PrEP"" and doesn't actually provide funding or any real assistance. It depends on a commitment from the manufacturer to supply the drug at their cost to ""200,000 uninsured per year."" It's a start, but nowhere near a guarantee. For one, it's only applicable if you have no insurance coverage, not if you're under insured. It also has no accommodation for the required testing and screening, so you're SOL there."
