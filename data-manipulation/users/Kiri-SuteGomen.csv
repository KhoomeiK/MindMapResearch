AskReddit,ffde1ye,t1_ffasm4j,1579818920.0,Yeah I can tell if a song has a happy or sad vibe but I just personally don't get influenced by it either way. Like happy songs don't make me happy and sad songs don't make me sad. So I just listen to what my ears like.

I think this fighters pass was pretty well rounded personally. I didn't expect to love all five characters and I don't but that's just the nature of these things."

The10thDentist,fel4fmc,t1_fel3jkz,1579213836.0,Okay fair enough man. I can respect that you tried it and it's just not for you. Personally I hate tea and that confuses people so I get where you are coming from.

unpopularopinion,fel3ym0,t3_epqnfz,1579213548.0,"Keyboard and mouse is way more precise for competitive gaming but if you just play casually it doesn't matter and you can use controllers on PC. The real reason PC is ""better"" is because you can upgrade individual parts rather than having to buy a whole new PlayStation when the new one comes out. 

Plus the mod example you gave was a joke mod but with games like Skyrim, mods make the experience so much more enjoyable. Plus graphics are objectively way better if you care about that. And games usually have more settings to tinker with. Basically PC gives you more freedom."

NoStupidQuestions,fel2iwa,t3_epqfcn,1579212658.0,"A few reasons. One is because they can keep the in game currency consistent across all countries but charge different prices for the currency depending on where you are. 

It's also a way to trick you into spending more money, like they purposely make the ratios inconvenient so you can never just spend the exact amount you want. And having a few gold coins (or whatever it is) left over makes you wanna spend even more. It's a very scummy but effective tactic."
AskReddit,fel096m,t3_eppnj3,1579211289.0,Same as my wallowing songs. I don't have an emotional attachment to music if I like the sound of something I listen it's as simple as that for me.
AskReddit,fekzjgz,t1_fekwtgd,1579210864.0,Agreed. I support all trans people but definitely think there needs to be an age limit on taking hormones or doing surgeries. A 14 year old kid shouldn't be making decisions that can permanently change their body like that.
AskReddit,fekzbg3,t1_fekycck,1579210731.0,I'm as accepting of people as they come and have several trans friends I support wholeheartedly... that being said that is incredibly fucked up. A four year old doesn't have any concept of these things.

residentevil,fdpp4rv,t3_emmo62,1578635288.0,Leon for sure. I never really liked Chris as he's just always felt like a basic dude with hardly any personality. The closest thing he has to being interesting is his rivalry with Wesker and I don't think that arc was particularly well done or anything. Capcom seems to think Chris is number one though.
AskReddit,fdpoz2e,t3_emmk69,1578635131.0,"Take the advice of these other comments, but for me personally I simply wasn't capable of getting better without medicine.

NoStupidQuestions,fdpoley,t3_emmidv,1578634762.0,It's normal for people with traumatic childhoods. Also if you deal with depression (not saying you do) that can really affect both short and long term memories. You can forget entire parts of your life ever happened. It's an aspect of depression that people don't really talk about as much but it's very real.
NoStupidQuestions,fdpoeaa,t3_emmie4,1578634574.0,I have this same problem you aren't alone.

There is still a good chance you won't enjoy any of their music, like I said I'm not a huge fan of them either (they are still quite ""brutal"" and not everyone likes that vibe) but it's a good rule of thumb to at least listen to like 3 songs before you write a band off completely at least that's how I look at it."
