AmItheAsshole,ffk9lcd,t3_eu2i3e,1580019206.0,"NTA. I have 3 kids, and we each have a place in the kitchen we put our ""special snacks"" that aren't shared, and a big box with random ""anyone, anytime"" snacks. 


Could you ask (or get your husband to ask) your MIL if she could give you a shelf or a drawer in the kitchen to keep your snacks you don't want to share? 


If you don't have an income, SIL eats your snacks, and your husband tells you to buy more...How does he propose you pay for them? Is he giving you some spending money? If he is, them you need to ask him for some extra to replace the snacks.


Also, If they are amenable to the shared snack box, it's really a good system! The kids never have to ask me to get them a snack, never ask permission if a particular snack is okay to eat. I don't put anything really amazing in there, fruit snacks, peanut butter crackers, Cheeze-its, little boxes of cereal. But they like knowing they can grab something when they want it."

Even if they could get an 8 hour per day job at home they probably wouldn't have the stamina to sit at a desk for that long to do the job. Especially if it was the type where they had to wear a headset and type information into a computer at the same time. I don't think that could be done from bed very easily or comfortably.


These people desperately need health insurance, and if they could do part-time work from home then they would probably lose their state health benefits."

Honestly other than the visit to crazy town when Buddy broke up with her she seemed like a cool person.

A trip/vacation is not a ""once in a lifetime experience"" - you can go anytime, no matter how old you are (within reason).

Heck, in my daughter's first year we went to Bermuda, Canada, California, Florida - all from Boston. It wasn't a big deal, especially because there is a 2 parents to 1 kid ratio in your situation.

Regarding coffee - if I go to the drive-thru I don't tip. Mostly because I pay with an app that doesn't have a place to do it after the fact - and I'm not going to pre-tip before I even get it because my order is often wrong or they hand it to me dripping coffee down the side and 1 tiny napkin.

entitledparents,feep34y,t1_feefqul,1579038252.0,"Hi, nope, there is another K who is at the bus stop (with her mom) who gets in line with the rest of the kids while her mom stands on the side. In the afternoon the bus won't let the K off unless they see the parent, though.

And definitely no PK, you have to be 5 to attend this school, it's K-4th. I wanted my daughter to attend when she was 4 years, 11 months, and 19 days but they said ""Nope, next year."""

This totally depends on if you have kids that need childcare or not. Even if your kids are in elementary there are still tons of half days, early release, and days off. We're 2 weeks into the new year and mine have already had 1 day off and 2 early release days."

entitledparents,fedul1c,t1_fedp38j,1579020217.0,"Well sure, she can wait there every day if she wanted to (she doesn't, she usually drives him) but that doesn't give her the right to cut all of the other kids who are lined up waiting.

But anyway, I know all of these kids and their parents. And that's just how she is. Her older kid came around selling Girl Scout cookies and demanded that I buy some. I said ""No thanks, _daughter_ is in Girl Scouts so I already bought some."" She threw a full-blown temper tantrum on my porch."
entitledparents,fedtviy,t1_fedqixh,1579019785.0,"Oh, I don't think the kid is - but if his mom teaches him to cut the line every day he will think it's normal. And will lead to entitled line-cutting later on."
