We are not taught growing up that working together elevates all; rather we are taught that through hard work and perseverance in the face of adversity, you can succeed alone. We are taught that failure is a result of laziness, foolishness, shortsightedness, or some other deficiency of character. We are taught to ignore the fact that good people can do everything right and suffer for no reason, or that wicked people can be wildly successful through their misdeeds. Couple this with America's puritanical background and ""God's Ineffable Plan"" (the favorite comfort food of the resigned poor) and you get what we have today.

*Unless* a more electable Republican is available without splitting the party. Then it's a toss-up, because those folks you're talking about are the same ones who elected the Republican congressmen long before Trump changed parties.

>I hope the Democrats control the House, Senate, and presidency to enact real progressive legislation. It could spell the end of conservativism.

We said the same thing when Obama was first elected. We spent years trying to be fair, respectable, bipartisan, and mindful of established tradition and procedure. Then we got voted out, by the same fickle voters you're counting on, and all we have to show for it is gay marriage, a neutered ACA (which was a half-measure to begin with) and *Trump.*

And it could very easily happen again. Look who's in charge of the House: Nancy Pelosi. She's been there forever. Look who's running for pres: three old Democrats (and a handful of younger candidates who have a snowball's chance in hell). Look at the party in general: it's a goddamn retirement community. Yeah, we have our AOC-types but they're vastly outnumbered by the oldsters. 

They're set in their ways, and fixated on how things *were* instead of how things have *changed*, and a Democratic majority will most likely be hugely underwhelming. They won't be likely to pass any groundbreaking legislation, especially with a Supreme Court that would just smack it down anyway."

Do you hear yourself? Do you honestly believe the Palestinian leadership would reject an opportunity to have internationally recognized borders, their own legally recognized military and police force, and a seat at the UN? 

Let me tell you this now, because there's gonna be loads of pro-Israel propaganda that pops up the second this idea starts to go anywhere: the only thing that will stop the two-state solution is Israel demanding something unreasonable, unsustainable, and untenable, and their allies refusing to apply pressure to them to drop it. Which is absolutely what will happen, because why on earth would Israel ever scede an inch of land to anyone unless they were made to? All their neighbors despise them on general principle, and the nation itself only exists because Western powers *forced* it into existence. When talks break down, there will be plenty of propaganda detailing how the Palestinians were unreasonable, and of course you'll have to dig to hear about how Israel deliberately sabotaged the process."
therewasanattempt,fftoeyi,t1_fftlzm7,1580225591.0,"You wanna know the difference between conservative and liberal comedy? 

When liberals make fun of conservatives, they're mocking people who choose ignorance. People who deny science, people who would prefer a government devoid of empathy. People who would cut their own social safety net to prevent folks they don't like from using it. People who believe their religion gives them the right to restrict the freedoms of others. People who want to tell others what they can and can't do with their own bodies, because *they* feel uncomfortable. People who only vote for one issue or another, and are willing to support *literally anyone* who makes the right promise, and don't care about any other consequences. People who don't believe in diplomacy, don't care about geopolitics, and don't understand nuance. And these things are funny, because everyone knows someone like that. Everyone knows someone who can't be bothered to learn, and gets offended at the suggestion that their uninformed opinion might not be valid. Everyone knows a racist, or a sexist, or a homophobe, or a religious nut. And we all know what they have in common: the people they choose to represent them.

When conservatives make fun of liberals, it boils down to ""look at these stupid kids who care about stuff, why can't they just mind their own business instead of trying to tell us what's right and wrong, can you believe they actually want us to *not hurt people's feelings and care about people*, haha we should shoot them, American Pride beer beer city folks are dumb""

Conservative comedy isn't funny. It doesn't even make me angry, it just depresses me. It's a direct line into the conservative ethos, and it's utterly devoid of empathy, wisdom, or wit. Good comedy is relatable, but great comedy makes you question what you think, and why you think that way. Great comedy dares to make you uncomfortable, while inviting you to laugh at your own discomfort. Conservative comedy doesn't do that. It's junk food for the soul. It's cheap, familiar, and reassuring, and never expects you to question yourself.
