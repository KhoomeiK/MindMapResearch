I will post what the ""lov om hittegods"" says in norwegian. 
""I følge lov om hittegods skal finnerlønnen normalt ikke settes høyere enn 20 prosent av gjenstandens verdi, og ikke over kr 15 når verdien er kr 100 eller mindre, 15 prosent, men ikke over kr 50 på gjenstander av større verdi opp til kr 500, og ikke mer enn 10 prosent når gjenstandens verdi er over kr 500.""

Basically. 
The finders fee cant be higher than 20% of the real value. 

Cant be over 15 kroner if value is 100 kroner or less, 15%, but not over 50 kroner if its worth up to 500 kroner. 
And not more than 10% if value is higher than 500 kroner."
