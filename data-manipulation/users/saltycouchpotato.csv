ChronicIllness,fffo2to,t3_etah46,1579888109.0,"I'm 29 and dealing with similar. I have Medicaid and I thought as long as you made less than a certain amount of money, you qualified for Medicaid. What was the exact reasoning/wording in the letter telling you you've lost your Medicaid?

I'm applying for SSI and I just got my denial. I'm going to appeal with a lawyer, who should take a percentage of my backpay if I win my appeal.

Look into charities, including churches and religious groups, to see if they have a program to help you. The last time I was in the hospital, they sent me the hospital Social Worker to give me a list of resources and such.

You can also post to r/legaladvice which might have more suggestions."

ActualHippies,fffifu8,t3_etc82n,1579884653.0,"A hippie to me puts Peace, Love, and Understanding above profit or victory. Hippies have a ""we're all in this together"" mentality.

For practice I wear a headband, bandana, headscarf, or beanie.

If you're still struggling with the baby hairs, can you try a hoodie or scoodie? Something that covers the head, neck, arms, and upper torso."

ehlersdanlos,fffdbxs,t1_fffc7nr,1579881460.0,"I agree with this. I also don't think there is enough education for geneticists to assess Hypermobility accurately across the board. They need training that they are apparently not getting in medical school. My geneticist just kind of looked at me and moved my fingers around; he didn't even measure my Hypermobility with calipers or a protractor. He ended up saying I'm ""not that hypermoble"" which is not a number on the Bighton scale, and he mentioned the ""Circus Disease,"" so I know he was thinking primarily of Classical.

My cardioelectrophysiologist on the other hand, who specializes in POTS and comorbidities of EDS, gave me an exceptionally thorough clinical exam including with the measuring devices, and said I'm a 9/9 on the Bighton, and ""extremely hypermoble.""

How can there be such a discrepancy?!?!"

Do you wear sunscreen and a hat? Those help me.

Do you have GI issues? Rosacea can be exacerbated by SIBO and other gut issues.

I'm sorry about your dad and his son but that sounds like a personal anecdote, not public policy.

I'm not a Leftist I'm an anarchocommunist, and I'm gonna burn this whole sucker down.

I feel an obligation to protect and uplift our most vulnerable community members: old people, sick people, LGBTQAI+ people, people of color, women, the disabled, and children. Plus animals and the environment.

Do you feel the same way?

Woke or otherwise, I am drained by the ""I've got mine"" attitude at the expense of everyone else. In politics, behind the wheel, or at the dinner table, I expect us all to be acting in good faith and at least trying to work together for the benefit of the group.

The center and the right usually platform on cutting social services, privatizing public programs for profit, and denying climate change, all through voter suppression and opaque multi-million dollar kick backs.

If those are in line with your values then by all means, continue to vote center right. No judgement on you, just your values."
