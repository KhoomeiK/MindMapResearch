science,ffip6e2,t1_ffilikk,1579979260.0,"Doesn't that make sense though? The more you use a social network the more you get pulled into its little social rules. It's why it feels like being in high school again (along with many of these users still being in high school). When a lot of people who care about societal standing, popularity or fake points hang in a collective then it creates this toxic context where everyone tries to desperately appeal to others while simultaneously playing up how cool they are.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, we are indoctrinated into a culture of narcicism and insecurity, and social media is just another means of pulling us into that version of the world."
