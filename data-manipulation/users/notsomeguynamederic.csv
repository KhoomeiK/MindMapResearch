He manages to hit Tom by total chance.

He is shot with paintball guns until he is literally writhing in pain on the floor. Despite not being hit by his own team, he blames Toby for it anyways.

Jim pulls one of his trademark Jim smirks before being shot by the Parks Department team. Pam picks him up and the two of them just leave the office.

Meanwhile, Dwight, using dry-erase markers as war paint, sneaks around, ducking and weaving behind desks, stealthily eliminating targets with his paintball gun.

While most of the other Parks Department people aren’t going to do particularly well, Ron is a complete tank, and he’s basically carrying the entire team throughout this match, powering through the Dunder Miflin team.

Eventually it comes down to Dwight and Ron. Dwight sneaks up behind Ron, but accidentally sets off one of Jim’s pranks, alerting Ron to Dwight’s presence. The two face off in a Western standoff. 

After exchanging quotes, Dwight and Ron fire at the same time, only to discover that both of them have run out of ammunition. Ron throws his weapon to the ground and chases after Dwight with his bare hands, who is frantically leaping over desks and throwing furniture on the floor in an attempt to slow him down. 

Dwight trips and falls to the floor, with Ron towering over him. Just as he is prepared to finish off Dwight, a single paintball from behind hits him in the back of the head. A mysterious masked figure covered in body armor emerges from behind an overturned desk. He helps Dwight up, who asks the name of his savior. The masked man takes off his helmet.
