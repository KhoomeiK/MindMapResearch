relationship_advice,ffi1d7e,t3_etne2x,1579962144.0,"You don't have to try hard to stop him. You don't have to even try at all - other than saying: stop. If you tell him to stop and he doesn't, he is doing something wrong. I don't want to sound too harsh, because you're so young. But I feel it's important that you know that it's not on you. If you say no or say stop, that's all it should take. If a guy doesn't respect your ""stop"" - he's pretty much crossing the line to rape in my opinion.

I'm in my late 30ies and so consent these days is not complicated. But during sex things can happen. She can get a cramp (or I can) or something. Or whatever. And from one second to the next, she's not into it. She doesn't want to continue. Even before she tells me, I'll know. Because I know my wife. But either way - when something like that happens, I stop. Obviously. And yeah it sucks I couldn't ""finish"", but so what? There's always next time - or there's doing it yourself. But in that moment I'm not thinking about finishing, but worrying about my wife and feeling bad for her. She's not getting to finish either. It's not something she's doing me - it's something that is happening to both of us. And after a second we usually have a laugh, try again or don't try again that day.

And yes, 18 years old, hormones and so on... But that's no excuse. Especially with his dismissive behavior afterwards. I swear I don't usually say stuff like that here - but you should seriously consider dropping that guy. If he can enjoy sex while you are not, there's something wrong with his ability to empathize. Again, sorry if this is harsh. I don't mean to be. But in my opinion a person who doesn't respect their their sexual partner's ""no"" is pretty much a rapist. No means no, as cliched as it may sound."
