Ive brought a car seat to panama and rented a car just fine. You may want to be sure to print out your agreement and keep it on you while doing the initial rental and return since they can be a bit dodgey. Also buying a dash cam would be a good idea.

Flying with a car seat can be a little odd or stressful since its oversized so you often have to pick it up somewhere else than the belt.

Driving is fine, you have to drive different is all. Extremely defensively. No matter the lights or signs, just watch whats happening. Once you adjust you may learn to be safer even when home.
