Blackops4,fd4pacq,t1_fcw1l8q,1578169697.0,"Gas may be devalued in the future because our economy, sources of energy, and politics could change in such a way that wind and solar energy are the primary sources of energy. Even now, it is known that there is enough land area in the plains of the U.S. to build enough wind turbines to power our whole economy. Just the technology hasn't been funded and/or built. But it will in the near future. Wind energy first came about in 1976, so it still a developing technology. So if you think of it in the way that computers have grown, there is a long time of development. And computers were created before 1976, but thats beside the point. The point is, gas, which is a nonrenewable resource and contributes to environmental degradation may become obsolete (no longer used)."

Blackops4,fcmhdk8,t3_ehi87m,1577775330.0,"My win percent is nearly 1 out of 4 games in solo (24%). My W/L in multiplayer is 4. I wish I could play quads with a group that didn’t care if my mic was on. My quad win percent is about 13%, but that’s only so low because of people raging or playing badly (e.g. running out into the open)"
Blackops4,fcmh63y,t1_fcmgn9z,1577775102.0,What is LTM
AskMen,fckfe14,t1_fcj00ao,1577724099.0,And/or no one cares
Blackops4,fckckkz,t3_ehi87m,1577722286.0,"Thanks for the feedback guys. It seems it’s unnecessary in MP but helpful in Blackout. It must just be me...I think I’ve given up trying to find people for quads...the mic just does it in for me (it’s too much to focus on), so I’ll just stick to solo."
Blackops4,fckced6,t1_fcjm4u6,1577722172.0,"No actually I have really good time in multiplayer being a level 500 master, with a 4 W/L ratio. And you’re being toxic"
college,fcjidk1,t3_eh8h0c,1577688748.0,"I wait until the class (whether it’s homework, lab work, whatever) requires me to open to a page in the textbook before I rent (1st priority) the book. If you have to buy a book, see if you can sell it online for others to use at the end of the semester. Similarly, consider looking for people who are selling used books online."
Blackops4,fcjgt9l,t1_fcjghxq,1577687063.0,Thanks. I think the amount of effort it takes to maintain a social life on Xbox isn’t worth it.

AskMen,fchbsow,t3_egz7x9,1577649071.0,That’s definitely not at all how I see my life. Lol
Blackops4,fcad4o1,t3_egr7h2,1577567127.0,"Yeah I agree. I feel like, as a master prestige 500+, I can say that there is a huge learning curve even as I continue playing now, in the 500’s, I’m changing my classes and playing better/learning. So I think they underestimated the value of a master prestige player, and thus, if you are a 7th/8th prestige, you appear close to master, but really it’s not like that...oh how much I’ve changed since hitting master......."
Blackops4,fc46xpw,t3_efkfec,1577408269.0,Yes but don’t buy any DLC
