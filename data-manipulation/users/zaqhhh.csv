Probably the same reason I came out to my family and social media on the same day. I assume people close to their families, that would be a lot bigger deal and would take more out of them."

socialanxiety,ffmmec3,t1_fflqcmu,1580056650.0,"I think this happens to people who are generally anxious. As someone who is very anxious, I had really bad reactions with friends my first 3-4 times. You are losing control and that loss of control is scary. 

After a while though for me at least, it went away. Now it's easy for me to smoke with everyone else around. 

I just tell myself look weed is supposed to make you chill. You are fine, no one is going to make you do anything, just enjoy the moment."

High School I just blended with whatever friend group would take me. The people who I ended up with weren't even really people I liked. Didn't socialize much at all outside school.

In college, there was no social hierarchy. So I came out way more confident. Still had social anxiety but I put myself out there just enough to land some great friends. Still had to be pushed to do a lot of social stuff but it did happen. 

I enjoyed college 50x more than HS 

Just so people know there are positives."

If I look at those numbers 5 years later, the out number has grown to about 25. 

So the answer is yes, depending on where you live makes a difference too! I lived in TN which had its ups and downs.

I get the thinking ""Well if a child sees me this way, clearly everyone else does."" 

Kids nowadays are more attuned to that kind of thing and sensitive to the fact that there are differences. Many older people still have this default assumption of sexuality as straight."

My parents relationship also sucked (my mom had a very horrible attitude, but my dad's passivity enabled it which sounds like your situation.) 

As far as easing your situation a bit, definitely check with your college's financial aid. Don't buy books new if you don't have to. Look for online PDF and or device compatible versions that may be cheaper when possible. Also, talk to people who took the class before you. Sometimes professors say you need them and you don't."

askgaybros,fe9grdo,t1_fe6uo73,1578937411.0,"I guess that's where I differ in that they are totally irreconcilable. 

I believe in a clockwork theory. That God created everything in the beginning (lead up to Big Bang). But that science dictates the Universe today. Hence, I don't believe in miracles etc. So would we really have any substantial difference? Jesus maybe being an exception. 

Like I love talking Science and Philosophy with my friends even when it's someone like Christopher Hitchens etc. 

In fact I tend to agree with many atheistic critiques of mainline Christianity. Of course I reject certain ones, but I love hearing the rationale and I never feel as though my beliefs are threatened if when my friends think a point of mine is null. 

I just think most atheists have a very stereotyped ideal of what a Christian is and how they would be compatible."

askgaybros,fdmc0m8,t3_em2hfr,1578545143.0,"I'll give a very honest nuanced answer to this question. Growing up, I had a sibling with a severe disability (Couldn't walk, talk, communicate, or do basic activities). Having that experience took away many aspects of living my life to the fullest (although there were a few positive aspects it instilled as well). I felt that I was largely robbed of my own childhood. 

So my answer to this question is that I never say never but I would be highly skeptical of dating someone in a wheelchair (fully acknowledging most disabilities are not as severe as my siblings). Part of that is for my sake and part of that is for theirs. 

Anytime I would get upset, I don't feel like I could properly work through that without entangling my past hangups and punishing them for my own stigmas and trauma."

Also, similar thing happened to me. I left an account signed in and my professor went to look something up and left part of my video history up. Luckily, I don't think anyone noticed.
