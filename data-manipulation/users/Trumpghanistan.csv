No. It's just a fact. Educating people on the benefits and risks of a treatment is what people should be doing. Telling people to never talk about them is straight up lying."

Source?"
facepalm,fef4rvs,t1_fef3sbj,1579048164.0,"I've noticed that most people on both sides of this argument are uneducated. We have the anti vaxxers who think that all vaccines are dangerous, and then we have the other side who thinks there are no negative side effects or think that they're so rare that they're not worth mentioning.

I mentioned that there are possible negative side effects and that I had a severe negative reaction from a certain vaccine as a kid, and nobody in my family has had a history of negative reactions. Got downvoted for even mentioning it and basically got called a liar because there's *no way* a vaccine could possibly cause adverse reactions. Lmfao. Most people don't know what the fuck they're talking about. Both sides are fine with lying and deceiving in order to push their points."
