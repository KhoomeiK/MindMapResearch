afkarena,ffg7i4g,t3_etdtvh,1579900125.0,I would ferael. My M+ ferael does absolute work on some stages (ch24). However my nara is only L+ so I can't speak for how good she really is (I use her in tower basically only and she is next to take to ascended)
afkarena,ffg7d4s,t1_fffya4o,1579900039.0,"Sounds about right! I went back and just pushed to 24-40, I'm done for the day lol"
afkarena,ffg79no,t1_ffg05vx,1579899979.0,Don't worry. At res crystal like 250 I finally went back and stomped them first try without both fire/ice. It's a silly reason to hold onto her! I just feel maybe one day her huge dodge would've helped somewhere but meh
afkarena,fffyb0p,t1_ffdg4ef,1579894457.0,"It worked for me!

Idiot me did athalia though. I should have done twins/mehira but oh well lol"
afkarena,fffy4mm,t1_fffxbcc,1579894344.0,So I suck lol. Damn
afkarena,fffy3hh,t1_fffxdrh,1579894325.0,What do I upgrade lol? I'm going to post my lineup and see what people think
afkarena,fffxryl,t1_fffnqu5,1579894125.0,Do whatever is fun for you. Personally I like working towards 1-2 celestial/hypogeans that aren't in shop. Currently working on faction emblems though
afkarena,fffxkfh,t1_ffezzs0,1579893995.0,"Same, I have about the same SI levels and heroes as OP, at 259 and cannot beat ch24. I suck :/. Safiya doesn't have the right SI level though."
afkarena,fffx5jm,t3_etf59u,1579893739.0,What res crystal level are you? I'm stuck at 24-36 at 259 and want to know if I just suck or what
afkarena,fffwwo0,t1_fffmety,1579893586.0,"I've fed Raines, thanes, kazs and gorvos. I kinda regret Kaz and gorvo, but I've got so many other Wilders to work on at the time lol."
afkarena,fffwpb6,t1_fffuabq,1579893458.0,"Or they might be referring to just Kane.

If they took away these bosses, could you imagine how hard it would be to get virtues?

I'd prefer if they kept this, but just finally added gear to formations. I'd have one formation for each boss and that's that."
afkarena,fffweoc,t1_fff2sje,1579893271.0,Kk lol I tried athalia and it didn't help but I'll try nara out.
afkarena,ffexke3,t1_ffexctl,1579869513.0,"I've been trying to use Nemora instead since charm is better, but the comp just isn't strong enough. My Athalia and nara are both only L+ as well :/.

I guess I havent tried arden lol just foddered him away but he always comes in clutch I guess"
news,ffetowk,t1_ffe9u4d,1579865048.0,"Regardless of whether you won the legal case or not, if I'm going to be executed by cops playing judge, jury, executioner, I'd rather at least have an attempt to fight back.

Hopefully makes the rest of them think twice before walking all over citizens."

I guessed the tide pods were $7, and I do my own laundry :("
afkarena,ffes1hi,t1_fferrp8,1579862750.0,"That's what I thought too, but he just fuckin explodes in campaign. He's very good in tower (where I have no other choices really) and pvp (sets me up big for khasos/safiya to do nasty AoE) but in campaign where I'm out leveled by 30-40 levels he just ignites, ESPECIALLY since he pulls everyone towards him. I have full faction gear and almost 20 SI so not sure if he'll ever get better at dodging (besides of course M2, but people have gotten way past my chapter with M2)."
afkarena,fferdy6,t3_et8gv2,1579861771.0,"Also, honestly I feel like Eironn kind of sucks. Even against a nearly full mauler team (24-36) he doesn't do anything and just dies. SI is only at +17 but I can't imagine more damage will help. He barely dodges, even with full M1 faction gear and 1\*"

I say this all the time for gun control stuff too. There's a middle ground somewhere. Just because you don't agree with one extreme doesn't mean you should just halt all progress in every direction."

Frugal,ffdpg3d,t1_ffdojjr,1579825843.0,"You haven't lived in a winter state I see lol. Go back to swerving every time it rains more than an inch. Literally every small car sucks in winter, good tires or not. I just would like an SUV or truck but actively trying to keep the car."
quotes,ffde7fs,t1_ffddqtx,1579819012.0,"I thinking you explained it better than I could have. I still am curious, but like do I really need to know and be right about things like the affects of minimum wage hikes when like 90% of the time it won't really affect me nor will my life be unliveable because of it. I just try to do what's right and if new info comes along, great I'll reevaluate"
PublicFreakout,ffdcctm,t1_ffcx006,1579817875.0,"I guess out of all the comments I'm going to choose to respond to you. The whole incident started because the woman went off on the Chinese guys that he's asking for ID from. Makes sense, they're the ""victim"". We also don't know what happened after.

Does anybody really think that a cop wants to enter a racially charged environment where people are fired up, he's on camera, and he just wants to ask for ID from an immigrant to flex on them as a racist? Really inopportune timing lol."

edit: I replied to the wrong person please stop hurting me lol."

Only thing that sucks is driving in the winter and I'm sure the safety features aren't up to par."
