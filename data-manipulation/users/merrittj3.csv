You have not abandoned her, as you have suggested that you would be able to spend the time and effort saved into advancing your relationship together. You are adjusting her care plan as you should.

news,fez61eh,t1_fev70o9,1579454141.0,"Surprising that I didn't feel insulted and even more surprisung that I am compelled to respond. You are entirely correct that my spelling was horrendous. I'll plead diminished culpability on 3 fronts. Fat fingers/auto fill for one. What is written is not all as typed and combined with typing quickly away on my phone, I am many times amazed at what appears on proofreading. I take entire responsibility for being lazy too many times not taking the time to unravel a mess that appears. Secondly, of my own responsibility/lazyness is that I became way too reliant on word perfect/autocorrect as a crutch. Easier to review the highlighted words than count on remembering syntax rules and grammar issues. Finally, a cognitive issue little mentioned but grossly affecting so many people. I'm sure there is a medical term for it, but I will simply call it post anesthesia cognitive impairment. Not only does Fentanyl glue your lungs together during sedation, but emerging from the fog afterwards is a process unto itself. It's not discussed by the Docs beforehand, there's no memo, the nurses don't tell you after surgery and it is only until you the patient realizes it and mentions to someone that ""I just feel a bit off"" that professionals tell you. ""Oh yes, some take months to recover most of their mental acuity"". Like a mini stroke, if you get back 99%, over let's say 3 or 4 surgeries, it becomes apparent. Some lose directional bearings, for some,spelling , others advanced (or even basic) math calculations are no longer automatic, when 'dividing in your head'. Gripping that oft used word may not be so automatic or fast. And although it is somewhat comforting that these things are a syndrome or an effect, it doesn't do an affected person any good when what appears in writing bears isn't as automatic or as correct as one assumes by history. All of these things, auto fill, spell check and cognitive misperceptions make it difficult at times to be taken seriously when things look so careless, ignorant and poorly thought out. I take your comment to be accurate and insightful, and a reminder to slow down and recheck to make sure that what I want to express is what I've said. Thank you."
