india,fdjxuvm,t1_fdjlvmw,1578490915.0,"Boomers everywhere are basically the pampered kids of the WWII generation that saw the harm of right-wing politics/fascism (Nazis, WWII, British colonial bullshit and Partition in India) and the harm of right-wing economic policies (Great Depression) with their very own eyes. Their time as youngsters was nothing but suffering, suffering and more suffering, even in the West (unless you were rich). So when the WWII generation had children and reached the age to gain power in society, they sought to build welfare states and promote human and civil rights - because they knew very well how brutal life is without those things. They built a happy and caring world for their children, Boomers, because ultimately, no parent wants their child to suffer? 

So, Boomers grew up privileged and in a stable, caring society that helped them succeed in life. But they didn't see it that way, they thought their success was all down to themselves and only themselves. They rejected their parents worldview as lame, stupid and instead stripped society of all the good their parents had done for it. And so, now we're here, learning first-hand just as the WWII generation did, why right-wing bullshit is bad..."

formula1,fdji25a,t1_fdjd0l3,1578471761.0,"This is a terrible attitude to have towards teams. Look, we only have 10 teams, literally each of them is precious. We need to keep all of the existing teams alive until we actually see at least another brand new team added to the grid. If we hit a 9 team-grid, we'd be at the lowest amount of competitors ever in Formula 1. And its not just Williams with existential issues - Sauber could be in trouble when Alfa Romeo decide to move on. The two manufacturers Mercedes and Renault will leave the sport on a whim so you can't really rely on them as such. Gene Haas might get tired of the team and seek to move on whenever really, which really only leaves us with 4 teams with secure futures on the grid. And 2 of those teams are actually owned by the same guy, so its more effectively just 3 teams.

This is definitely one of the main reasons why Liberty pushed for the budget cap. Once we have a budget cap, we'll get more teams so that we never risk dipping below the 10 team mark."

It kinda is but in part also because the top 4 teams haven't always seen as or been title-challenging caliber teams. For instance, in the Hakkinen-Schumacher era, both McLaren and Ferrari retained their driver line-ups consistently, but if you add in the 3rd and 4th teams, then there were a lot more changes. 

One big reason why we've had such fluid driver line-ups over the last decade is simply because we'd been blessed with an outstanding group of drivers. I mean, we had 5-6 champions on the grid in the early 10s, so that ultimately meant a lot of them would always be shopping around for a better seat. But now that most of those champions have retired, we're basically seeing the driver market slowdown. 

But another reason why we're seeing a market slowdown, and this is one I absolutely do not like, is the young driver system. Teams having a dedicated young driver system has basically screwed Ricciardo out of the top teams because instead of Ricciardo, Red Bull want the newer, shinier kid on the bloc in Max Verstappen instead and Ferrari will be sticking with Leclerc for a long time as well. So a driver like Ricciardo basically gets sidelined because the big teams already had their favorites settled and sorted like 5 years ago itself. It makes for a sterile sport and a sterile grid. Part of the excitement of the sport, any sport really, is seeing which young players ultimately develop into the best and its exciting to think of each time a good young driver emerges, how their career will develop, which teams will they join etc. Nowadays we know that which big team they'll be driving for literally when they join F3 itself, not even F2 or F1. It's all just so terribly boring."

You sure about that? Trump wants to keep the military in Iraq.

> To protect US interests in the interim. It's similar to the troop surge in 2007, which was immediately followed by a pretty quick drawdown of troops in the region over the next few years from over 160k in late 2007 to sub 100,000 by early 2009, and around 50,000 by 2011. Right now, with the 3000 additional troops we're only at 8000 overall; that can be withdrawn from the region pretty quickly.

I know/agree but you missed the point I was making, or perhaps I wasn't clear enough, but - if Trump tried to spin being kicked out of Iraq as a positive action of his own, but then sends troops back again to the Middle East, then he can't really say he's got our troops back home. Well, he can always lie, sure, but it would be a lie. 

This might be moot anyway now, as Trump seems to want to keep troops in Iraq. Though issuing threats and then not following-up with anything extra but calling it a stunning win is another Trump MO, so that's what he's probably doing with his threats to Iraq."
