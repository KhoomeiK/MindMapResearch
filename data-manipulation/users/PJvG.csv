COMPLETEANARCHY,ff8kxr2,t1_ff8hzdg,1579683486.0,"From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAW_Patrol):

> PAW Patrol is a Canadian CGI–animated television series created by Keith Chapman. It is produced by Spin Master Entertainment, with animation provided by Guru Studio. In Canada, the series is primarily broadcast on TVOntario, which first ran previews of the show in August 2013. The series premiered on Nickelodeon in the United States on August 12, 2013.

> The series focuses on a young boy named Ryder who leads a crew of search and rescue dogs that call themselves the PAW Patrol. They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on emergency services professions, such as a firefighter, a police officer, and an aviation pilot. They all reside in doghouses that transform into customized vehicles for their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called ""pup packs"" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.

One of the dogs, Chase, is a police dog. He's more or less the main character imo, as he is almost always the first to speak and goes on almost every mission. And because it's a kids show, everything is put in a really positive light. So in that way it can certainly be seen as police propaganda."

Nee hoor. Als ze er een puinbende van maken kunnen ze echt wel ergens anders weer aan het werk. Zo lang ze maar geld en een goed netwerk hebben. Dan word dat gewoon gezien als fouten waarvan ze kunnen leren zodat ze het de volgende keer beter kunnen doen. En anders beginnen ze zelf toch gewoon een nieuw bedrijf met het geld dat ze hebben.

De gewone werknemers zijn juist degenen die in de problemen raken, eerst stress hebben van het harde werken om het bedrijf levend te houden, dan de stress hebben van je baan verliezen en een nieuwe baan moeten zoeken omdat ze niet genoeg spaargeld hebben om lang zonder baan te zitten. Zo'n topmanager heeft het wat dat betreft echt wel makkelijker.
