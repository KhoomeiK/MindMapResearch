pics,fffenbg,t3_et7t5x,1579882297.0,"Actually these hunters help wildlife far more than you Liberal anti-hunters do. These trophy hunters pay huge amounts of money that go to animal conservation in the country where they hunt. The meat from their hunt goes to needy villages to help feed them.  You anti-hunting Liberals in the US cry and whine about hunting and how it should be abolished but the truth is you anti-hunters need to shut up because you really have no say in it all because you don't contribute to wildlife conservation like these hunters do.

Plus these hunters take animals that are out of their prime.

They way our animal conservation is financed in the US is through our states Fish and Game departments and people buying hunting and fishing licenses, very little if any money comes from the tax payers. So you anti-hunting Liberals really have no say in it all or at least shouldn't because you don't support wildlife unless you buy a hunting or fishing license.

P.S. If you contribute to one of these Liberal anti-hunting orgs in the US  that claim they help animals you're being lied to. Most all the anti-hunting orgs in the US give their monies to anti-hunting politicians to make more laws against hunting. Very little of the money actually goes to help wildlife."
