offmychest,ff6y7oz,t3_erzuzn,1579637331.0,"Yea, you were sexually abused by your sister as a kid. 

Now, what to do? You are right to want to bring this up, especially now that you are remembering and ""experiencing"" the moment. But you are also right in not wanting to open a can of worms, with a sick mother and a depressed sister.

You need to ask yourself. In some exchange with your sister/mother what do you want out of it?

Just that the truth is said?
An apology from your sister?
Pitty from your mom?
Ect.

Now see how likely you telling either will get u what u want. Lastly look at the collateral. All the things that can happen that u don't want (the rest of the worms).

Only you can weigh it up. I cannot speak from ur situation, no one really can. 

If u can, for the sake of sister and mother. Forgive and not bring it up, without compromising yourself, I would recommend that as it's the path of least destruction.

On the other hand talking to your sister from a place of forgiveness might really help both of you. It's very likely she is haunted by this too"
offmychest,ff6wadu,t1_ff6rk7j,1579636200.0,"I feel for her bf. I would hate to be in his position. Part of me wants him to know, just as a command decency. He should know what she has done if he is going to move country for her! But, it's not my place or my problem. I'm staying well clear now"
offmychest,ff6w27u,t1_ff6rk7j,1579636066.0,"You are right. That is what eats me up. I should have had the self respect to drop it right there. There is no good outcome in that situation, just pain for me and those involved. 

I fucked up and a I feel really bad. It's no excuse but I really wouldn't have gotten involved just for the sex, I had developed genuine feelings for her and it was fucking confusing.

Now, we both lost a friend and a bunch of respect for each other and ourselves. If u play with fire u gonna get burnt"
offmychest,ff6rct9,t3_erz2bv,1579633272.0,"White privilege exists. The white guilt stuff is bs tho. There is oftern a cross over there tho. 

White people are generally more privileged, partly because they are white but mainly because of their socio-economic position. (On average)

White guilt says I should feel eternally guilty that I'm born white with privileges built from exploitation of blacks by whites from a previous generation. While I do believe this story is mostly true. I did not participate or choose what my ancestors did and I will lead my life in a way I see fit. Guilt won't help, only hurt"

offmychest,ff6ql74,t3_erkltn,1579632818.0,Good job buddy. Onwards and upwards!
offmychest,ff6of6p,t1_ff6moy0,1579631519.0,"Thanks for the reply. You are right on all counts. I would have had a similar disposition, in fact I still do. Although I do believe in forgiveness, good people fuck up. I plan to forgive myself and possibly her too. I know it all sounds like a throwaway but she has been a great friend to me before all this. It will never be the same, but we see each other everyday at work, it's more pleasant to be amicable"
diablo2,f852tre,t1_f84n14b,1574266414.0,"You can. Just be super careful. 

Make sure that your last plugy stash page is blank. So that when atma loads your stash it's empty. If u load a char in atma whose last stash was a full plugy page, the items don't fit and it bugs. I lost half a page from that once. I keep collectables in atma and possibly useable items in plugy shared."
