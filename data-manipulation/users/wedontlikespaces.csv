If it were possible, I would delete the knowledge from my brain because it's just taking up space been pointless tat and it's pushed out the bit that tells me if it's bin day or not."
CasualUK,fffmtpp,t1_ffflqfs,1579887350.0,"Yes, but normally you can point to an ensiting reason. 

For example, I don't like my new neighbor because she keeps parking her car  in front of my drive, because she is a bellend.

If  Meghan  did that as well I would also not like her. But it takes a special something to not like someone for no reason."

web_design,fffbzrv,t1_fff9tje,1579880620.0,"I honestly wouldn't worry too much about WordPress. If you know HTML, CSS and JavaScript you figure WordPress out should the situation arise where you need to use it.

You're probably better off learning React and/or Vue as those tend to be sought-after skills. If you've got those down, then WordPress will be a cakewalk, though it will still royally piss you off.

It's also worth noting that companies already know this. You can still apply for WordPress jobs even if you don't have that much experience with WordPress because experience with *anything* related means that you've got transferable skills.

It's kind of like being a chef making a new kind of dish you never made before, your experience with other dishes will help you make this new one more easily."

 Essentially they try to make you pay the ""consultant"" and say they'll pay you back, which obviously they don't do, and the ""consultant"" is just them."

 Neither of you are having a sensible conversation, your just shouting at each other about something *that has not even aired yet*.

Most of the time people just use contactless, pay by phone or if its a big item, old style chip and pin. People hardly ever use cash anymore even for small purchase, and definitely not for large ones so there is no need for £50's anymore.

CasualUK,ffcipke,t1_ffc1k8d,1579800311.0,">£20s are so much more likely to be faked because people accept them without a thought.

Yes, that's a point, were they not going to update the £20 so that it was new plastic notes? I *thought* that the whole point was to update the easily(ish) to forged £20's and £50's so that stores would expect them again. So far they only seem to have updated the £5's and £10's"
css,ffbwep3,t1_ffa2pbq,1579784989.0,"If you work on the 2 version back rule then the only MS browsers you should really be supporting are Edge current version (the chromium one), and IE11.

So realistically you're right no one should be worrying about 10 or 9 or bloody 8 at all."
css,ffbw7zo,t1_ffa3wpe,1579784821.0,IE11 supports the older spec for Grid (along with prefixing it) so your prefixer is probably just moving to the old spec as well as prefix in it.

I think part of it may have to do with the fact that mirrors and not massively reflective in the IR part of the spectrum. And inside out seems to use some weird combo of IR and visible light."

I used to work at Vodafone ISP who had the same issue. Management **hated** it because it really pissed off customers, but they actually have no policies in place to do anything about it, if someone cold transferred a customer, there was no way to work out who did it, all the transferring advisor had to do was not log the call."

todayilearned,ffahilw,t1_ffa4jy6,1579735868.0,"It's a pretty well-known story in the UK. Schools in the UK don't work the way they do in the US, they are not supposed to be making their own independent rules up. There is no school districts, they are all meant to follow the same set of rules regardless of where they are in the country. None of those will say that people can't wear short if they want too.  The closest you'll get is ""*students must wear appropriate uniform*"", but there's nothing preventing ""appropriate uniform"" from including shorts.

So basically it's a somewhat famous story about a school being ridiculous and going beyond its remit."
css,ffaf8lh,t1_ffa7wou,1579734339.0,"Oh, right, yep that won't work. That's because the length of the path is not defined by CSS, it's defined by the SVG itself (kind of). 

If you look at the underlying code, the length is not specified *anywhere*. A start point and an endpoint are specified. The length is merely the distance between those two points.

So you can't make it any longer, because the pixel coordinates don't change simply because you scale something up. You will need to modify the actual inline SVG via JavaScript, and change the actual pixel coordinates, if you want to change the length of a line. The other option is you could mess around with dashoffset (which *is* CSS property) to give the illusion that the line is shorter, then change the offset to make the line look like it's growing longer."

 The thermostat is located in the building managers office. The building manager got fired for some reason and never returned the office key and no one apparently had a spare so we literally couldn't get into the office to turn the damn air-con off. In the end someone kicked the door in to get to it. 

I don't know why we even have air conditioning in the UK. It never gets hot enough to justify it, but there it is, blowing away all the time wasting god knows how much electricity. There's probably some nuclear power station someone whose entire job it is to power all the pointless air conditioning systems."
