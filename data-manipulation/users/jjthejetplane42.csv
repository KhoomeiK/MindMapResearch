HawaiiVisitors,fepud6q,t1_femd3vc,1579331609.0,I say Kauai! I haven't been to Maui but have now been to Kauai and Ohau and Kauai is a LOT quieter and overall a completely different scene.

Portland,fe62par,t1_fe6272e,1578880442.0,I live near in like Beaverton/Hillsboro so I probably should have gone to a game... but no I did not lol. I don't really care for football the sport so I only go to games for atmosphere and I dont get the idea that's there's much of a traditional college atmosphere at the games.

birthcontrol,fe615o2,t3_envwbt,1578879466.0,"I want to preface my experience my saying everyone is different and will react different, but nonetheless this was my experience. 
I briefly had the cooper IUD. I had two periods on it (then fell out). Before having the IUD my periods were like average? Lasted about 4 to 7 days with day 1 being heavy ish and getting significantly better each day, and really never have cramps. 
On the IUD, my first period was really just like spotting the whole week. It was weird but I was like okay whatever. My second period I had.... ouch. There was so much blood and I had a ton of cramps for about 7 days. It was so bad that my IUD fell out.... which this is seemingly common with the cooper IUD?? 
So yeah for me personally it made my periods a lot worse, but again everyone is different!"

portlandstate,fdyy1y4,t3_endfwo,1578784710.0,I have about an hour commute (car and max) and I am fine. I have a rather decent social life. It's not too bad to not be right next to classes. Just dont take classes earlier than 10am!

AmItheAsshole,fdo3kzq,t3_em7edc,1578598257.0,NTA I work at retail store and I don't do cashiering often but I'm pretty sure we are told to only check bags/containers that they are purchasing.. not personal bags.

Periods,fdlr1os,t3_elzu21,1578530451.0,"I think your date of January 15th to see the doctor is a good idea. **Plan B can affect a period**. It sounds like it did work, and even if it did work, it is good to have a doctor check up about your late period, since you took the Plan B. Try not to stress about it too much (harder said than done I know), but that can also cause the period to be late. You can always take another test again in a few days just to triple check, but yeah seeing a doctor is best bet at this point."

I left my pills in the car for 12 hours once (summer day) and my pharmacist said they were fine, but I didn't believe her so I called manufacturer and they said they weren't. So I would just get a professional opinion!"
retail,fd4n4wd,t3_ek0h8r,1578169099.0,"Same situation where I live! I got a call the other day from someone who was asking if my store was included in the ban, and then proceeded to complain about the quality of the reusable bags my store offers... They seemed okay with the fact we don't use plastic bags anymore, but I, a minimum wage worker, is not gonna be able to change how our reusable bags are manufactured."

birthcontrol,fcusqq1,t1_fcuojak,1577987768.0,"If you are nervous about hormonal side effects the Copper IUD really is a thing to look into. It didn't work for me, sadly, but doesn't mean it couldn't work for you!"
birthcontrol,fcusl55,t1_fcuojak,1577987682.0,"Hormones definitely affected me. It made my mental health shit, but I think it helped my skin? I dont think it caused me to really gain weight, maybe a few pounds?"
birthcontrol,fcunk4y,t3_ej0ggn,1577984803.0,"The Pill- I've tried a couple different ones, and one just made me more depressed and anxious. The other one I tried completely killed my sex drive, and made me more anxious and such. 
The Patch- I liked it better than pill, but still some of the same side effects. It didn't completely kill my sex drive but like the week before my period I was never horny, but rest if month was fine. Did make me kinda anxious. 
Copper IUD- yeah I do not have a positive story. It was super painful insertion. Then proceeded to fall out 2 months later... (I am really lucky my insurance covered it...) 
So now I am BC free right now, using condoms solely, (risky I know), but I am in between doctors, so giving myself a break and honestly I feel so free right now."
