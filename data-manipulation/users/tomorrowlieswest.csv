greenday,fel3hbn,t3_epn9kt,1579213251.0,It's a shame the song sucks but this super cool.
greenday,fekpipz,t3_epj8iq,1579204927.0,"You know, the more i think about the sample, the more uncomfortable i am. I know they're donating the royalties but everytime i hear this song, I'm gonna think of Gary Glitter and eugh."
greenday,fek8m0o,t3_epj8iq,1579194880.0,I love this band more than anything. But they do not make it easy. Yikes.
aww,fe8ql2o,t3_enxm4k,1578929377.0,She's a keeper
theLword,fe8ltei,t1_fe8kz8p,1578927649.0,"That's fair. The Tess thing made me dislike her even more, tbh. She very clearly told her she was sober and just been through a breakup and Finley still got drunk and hooked up with her."
theLword,fe8k67i,t3_eo4lnn,1578927056.0,"Really loved seeing Bette and Tina again.

I still absolutely cannot stand Finley though."

northernireland,fe41qfy,t3_enqulm,1578854954.0,"There isn't really any shops that would take them, but if you're wanting to sell them, there's apps like musicmagpie or ziffit that might take them. It really depends on the book though and they usually offer pennies.

If you want to donate them, there's a few charity shops in Belfast that only deal in books. Oxfam has one on Anne Street and one on Botanic Avenue."
northernireland,fe3zqwm,t3_enquyb,1578854416.0,"I think it depends on your personality. If you're a really organised and self-motivated person, then it might work for you. Personally, I quit after a few months of it."
theLword,fe3ss6u,t1_fe3px63,1578852556.0,"Sure, but if it was a question like that, it wouldn't be tagged as a spoiler. Totally spoiled it for me tbh."
aww,fe31h4d,t3_enmxdg,1578845020.0,Thought you'd stepped in dog shit for a second
ukpolitics,fe30z2s,t3_enl8t7,1578844848.0,Probably a dumb question but why is there a first and deputy first minister? Seems unequal
theLword,fe308pk,t3_eniw5r,1578844720.0,Yup
