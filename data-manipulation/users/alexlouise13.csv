caving,ffy44u5,t3_evg2y3,1580338187.0,"As a British person who has never been to Australia, the phrase 'Australian cave' fills me with terror. I'm already uncomfortable with our puny British cave spiders-what the hell lives in the caves over there?!"
todayilearned,ffszmht,t1_ffsaxsc,1580199340.0,"Did you say that because they have a different voice that refers to them as 'you'? I find it strange that my monologue addresses 'me' as 'you'. Do other people's monologues speak in the first, second or third person,I wonder?"
todayilearned,ffszcsf,t1_ffs65ae,1580198974.0,"I have the black mesh,too! But if I concentrate on the image I don't so much see it as feel it. For example,if I have to picture a gold necklace I'll see the image faintly,but in detail. If I want to explore the details I 'look' at it closely and it's a similar experience to running my palms over something. Brains are so weird."
TinyHouses,ffqxb4c,t3_euq1qd,1580145741.0,"I agree... although having said that,I would only live in a tiny home in very specific circumstances. I mainly just love the idea. The thing that got me into tiny homes was the 'free from the system' thing, and that is definitely being lost. I love to watch shows featuring clever design,low cost,hard work and individual modifications and style.

 Sadly the shows are being taken over by beautiful but unoriginal spaces that cost almost as much as my conventional house, and some of them are actually bigger than it! Bring back Gary,the itinerant brickie who likes to surf all summer and knocked together a shed on a trailer with customized board storage! Or Stacey who doesn't really like people very much,so she walked way out into the forest and whittled her own roundhouse and lives off the land with her trusty German shepherd!"
truechildfree,ffqvwc8,t3_euem08,1580144838.0,"Thanks for asking. These are good to read. I'm lying on my sofa in my house that I own. I'm in my early 30's and I have just figured out what I want to do in life,so when I'm not enjoying my beautiful house I'm trying to get on a course that will train me for my dream job.

There are lots of things I thought I would have done by now, and I used to feel sad that I hadn't, say, travelled much or developed a good friendship group. However, because I didn't have kids I have had the chance to try several careers, and take risks rather than have to stay at a job I didn't like to support my family. Because I don't have kids I will be able to focus on my new career. I will also be able to travel in my 40's, when I'm established in my field (hopefully!) and have more cash to spend.

 Basically,not having kids has opened up more time in which I can achieve my dreams."
truechildfree,ffqv1vx,t1_ffp2oh1,1580144289.0,"Thanks for sharing that. It's nice to know I'm not alone when i'm a little sad that being CF has excluded me from certain experiences,but also that we're both able to rationalize it."
truechildfree,ffquogy,t1_ffp12pg,1580144049.0,"Ah, that's interesting! Is 32-35 the danger age? I have just entered it and now I'm worried."
truechildfree,ffquj4i,t1_ffoordw,1580143952.0,"I can't see us being able to retire quite that young,but if we continue to live in our modest house and keep the same hobbies I think we could both go part time at that age. That's the dream! Lots of time for van adventures!"
childfree,ffqu5s6,t1_ffqkaq4,1580143711.0,"Oh, don't you worry-i'm sure it'll make its way over here eventually, just lake baby showers and that idiotic event where you find out what the baby will have between its legs!"
vegetarianketo,ffqttj5,t3_eup2s6,1580143490.0,"You didn't mention fruit- my go-to breakfast is frozen yoghurt,made by putting unfrozen full-fat Greek yoghurt in the blender with frozen raspberries. Raspberries are low in carbs (12g carbs per 100g) and high in fibre. I have it as breakfast but it would totally work as a snack,too, and it is DELICIOUS!

I also like to do tuna salad by adding chopped celery,dill and capers to tuna mayo. Just a way to get a bit more greenery into tuna.

I make my own soups, and you can get those very vegetable-y."
veganmealprep,ffqszec,t3_euhh3p,1580142942.0,"I love tabbouleh, and I can't believe I didn't think of quinoa tabbouleh myself! Thanks for the inspo!"
childfree,ffqsroy,t1_ffqa1wg,1580142802.0,"Haha,I have never watched little house on the prairie. That very episode was randomly on the TV one day, and I was so confused because I read all the books, and that was definitely not in any of them!"
truechildfree,ffqruv6,t1_ffpv9zw,1580142201.0,"I go to the other sub for a good rant sometimes. I think I'm in the middle of the 2- I don't mind kids existing in most public places,but I definitely think there are some places that are just for adults (pretty much anywhere with alcohol and live music in the evening, for example). And if a baby is screeching on a plane I will be grinding my teeth for the entire flight.

 I pretty much am a parent for 4 days and nights a week,but to older kids. (I work in a children's home) And you know what? I LOVE those kids. I love the way they talk and their hilarious sense of humour, and am heartbroken when they tell me their stories. I remember their birthdays and their favourite foods and I give them hugs. I just don't like under-5's,like, AT ALL. I like what I do,though-i get to have a positive effect on a child's life, and experience something of parenting, without having to do it 24/7."
sewing,ffo4b7l,t3_euaw9f,1580073997.0,Not jealous *at all*
antiwork,ffn0zjg,t1_ffmzu54,1580060875.0,Yup! So much easier to leave your job when you don't have dependents :)
childfree,ffghqej,t3_etes9u,1579906501.0,So happy for you guys!
childfree,fffmv9v,t1_fffgtid,1579887377.0,"Yeah. Went to one baby shower-after that I have managed to dodge every single one! They are awful. You have to draw the line somewhere,and baby shower is my line (that was a difficult sentence for grammar!)"
relationships,ffbxr5w,t3_eslw7w,1579786168.0,"While you're in negotiations, please take extra precautions. Desperation to be a mum does some weird stuff to formerly good people-a friend of mine who I always admired was planning on tricking her partner. Luckily another friend told the partner and he got out of there...the point is,I would never have imagined this friend capable of such deception. Protect yourself!"
loseit,ffbw3uj,t3_eowi3i,1579784717.0,"Hmm. I'm quite fit and active,size 12 UK. I have been on keto for just over a week, and I took the decision to stick to it because since changing jobs to one where I move less,even though I also eat less,I have put on over half a stone. I did try to do more exercise but I just couldn't lose the little bike tyre that's forming round my middle. After just one week of keto I'm already noticing a difference that I just wasn't able to achieve on a more conventional method."
rescuecats,ffbr2s6,t1_ffblli2,1579779366.0,"Haha,I would probably advise against it,then. If your cat is really curious, and you don't feel silly doing it, maybe a cat lead would work?"
