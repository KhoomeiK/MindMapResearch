AskMen,ffw650l,t3_evay0q,1580286111.0,"I think interest and transparency is good, but genuine trust is even better. Being obsessive for no reason, and not knowing boundaries of ones privacy is a red flag, doesn't mean that there is ill intent, trust comes to people in various amounts of time and ways. But if it's already a struggle that you have to question it, then that's a clear early red flag. I would personally allow all the freedom to my significant other, having opposite sex friends, texting them, hanging out with them etc. If I/she don't have the basic trust to do that then that's something that needs to be worked on, if you both agree to do so, I want her and me to feel safe and be vounrable at each others side with full trust. We are all a work in progress though and we compromise or inspire each other to be better"
relationship_advice,ffw5kl1,t3_ev66yp,1580285354.0,"Honestly ama be blunt. Run bitch. What the hell is this bullshit. You don't need this shit, unless your kink is being in an abusive, manipulative ""relationship"" my mom has been in this situation, my best friend too. I'm so sad this is so common. The heart is fucked up, sometimes because it falls for someone doesn't mean they are good for you or they just reveal their true colours later on. Do yourself a massive favour and don't keep beating a dead horse. Remove that toxic shit from your life even if takes a weather storm to do it. Life is fucking short and everyone deserves their equal. It will be an eternal cycle. They will never change just manipulate you to staying that ""one more time"". You need to be the change, end the cycle, remove yourself from their life honestly. After I failed to die I definitely filter all the unnecessary bs in my life. Nothing is worth that shit over my own happiness."

Saying the green felt like holding grass would make no sense, you can't associate the green with the object because you don't actually know how it looks. For a better example imagine how you would describe water, it's colourless, so it's like saying it feels blue and refreshing like the ocean and it's breeze, but you don't know blue. I guess it sort of works but not exactly. Am I making sense it's 8am why am i awake"

depression_memes,ffs7w0u,t3_euoaka,1580175315.0,"Is being a certain sexuality still seen as a negative thing? Like honestly who cares lol. No one comes out as ""straight"", that should be the case with whatever you identify yourself as. Just live as you, do what you do, people ask, tell them, but like straight people don't announce it nor should anyone else have too imo. People still are living in old age thinking, gotta be more accepting! People have some silly reasons Why it bothers them..."
depression_memes,ffs77ms,t3_euv2f6,1580174835.0,"That's the fundamental phenomenon of mental illness tbh. People say they are depressed when they are working a lot, or they have a strict deadline, reasonable stimuli to get them on edge and stressed which is understandable. But actual depression for example can come from no where at all, that's the worst type of anything. When it hits and you don't even know why or from where, so you can't just ""finish your deadline"" or ""take care of that"" and have that stressful period of time be over. It comes and stays for no reasons sometimes. That's what mental illness is. 

Most people in my life assume I'm going through harship etc, probably fundamentally deep down there is cause and effect of course, but for example my suicide attempt happened whilst my life was at it's peak, i was getting my life together and enjoying it more than I ever have. I myself didn't really realise the heaviness of this phenomenon until now. Don't just assume if you fix a certain situation that the persons problems will be ""cured"". No I'm not going to try to die again today, it doesn't mean that I'm cured and that ""phase"" went away... I'm a continuous work in progress"
TooAfraidToAsk,ffqmep7,t3_eukwcp,1580138467.0,"Society is good at making us feel there is no other choice, you either slave away all your life, or die (but we know suicide is frowned upon) so what else is there but to slave away? It's literally forced torcher in my opinion. I should be able to choose if I want to live this life or die. I feel like I'm trapped to do this and I hate it. So what's the point for me to keep living? Just because? All the things that give me joy are distractions from everything necessary to keep me alive which I hate. Yes there's good things and joy etc. But if I had to choose I'd rather not have any joy and be nonexistent if it meant I didn't have to be forced to live for nothing. That's cruel society. :("
