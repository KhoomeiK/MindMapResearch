DeepIntoYouTube,fete21x,t1_fesvucp,1579374429.0,"That's what makes this post great. *""The person that's buying the sex""* works amazingly as a punchline because the title doesn't give it away."
badwomensanatomy,fet52b4,t1_fepu1mn,1579371863.0,"Depends on how bad you got it, I personally wouldn't say *any* food is worth going through such pain. Though luckily lactase supplements are a thing."

Er zal dus zeker een markt voor blijven bestaan. Wel is het mooi dat boeren zich dan meer kunnen focussen op kwaliteit als ze toch niet gaan winnen op prijs, dus dan kunnen zij het zich ook weer veroorloven om beter met hun dieren om te gaan."

KamikazeByWords,fe96rh3,t3_eo6pc7,1578934889.0,"Targeting Reddit as a whole has been considered low-effort by our rules for a while now (we even made a secondary sub in an attempt to get those posts out of here: /r/KamikazeByReddit), but so far it has always been more of a guideline than a rule.

Consider this post a last-ditch attempt to step up the quality of the sub before we have to be stricter with our rules."

FellowKids,fdw7i5u,t1_fdvu707,1578755907.0,"Yes, but nowadays it's just criticizing capitalism in whichever way possible, instead of sharing boringly distopic images highlighting the horrors of late-stage capitalism."

coaxedintoasnafu,fdg01lp,t1_fdfz62s,1578375182.0,"Whatever the case may be, good on you for not wussing out and deleting the comment. A sub like this should be able to recognise satire without it being explicitly marked as such."
coaxedintoasnafu,fdfxsh4,t1_fdfqgp5,1578373180.0,It's obviously just someone making fun of shitty novelty accounts.
SponsorBlock,fdb44jg,t1_fdaci72,1578253534.0,"That's an excelent idea. And indeed, it would be beyond the scope of SponsorBlock. I'll keep an eye out in case you ever decide to toy with this idea, but I can imagine that it's quite an undertaking, and you probably have your hands full with SponsorBlock as is."

todayilearned,fd5ar99,t1_fd4y9an,1578175809.0,"Depends on the rationale behind it. You're obviously an idiot if you keep emptying your wallet for tickets in the hope of turning your life around, but if you're just buying a ticket for the excitement - and to give you something to daydream about in the case of Powerball and the like - I don't really think it's all that bad of a deal."
doggohate,fd4su1k,t3_ejs815,1578170812.0,The poem is kinda neat if you tidy it up and correct the grammar and spelling.
europe,fcyblfi,t1_fcy7e7s,1578077717.0,"It was kinda central to his ideology and rise to power, so you can hardly call that ""no reason""."
SponsorBlock,fcvq4lu,t1_fcvpdnu,1578007574.0,"Gotcha, that's understandable. Though you could just disable auto-skipping by default for padding and separating the option from sponsor auto-skipping; an optional ""to the point"" button shouldn't bother anyone, even if opinions of what 'padding' is differ."
