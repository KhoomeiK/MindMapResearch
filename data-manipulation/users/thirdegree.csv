But there's no world in which he wins the nomination. Like, if Sandars, Warren, and Biden both simultaneously die and in their will tell every supporter to vote for Yang, he would have a chance. 

I do hope he gets a place in the Sandars administration though, he has some great ideas and we need more people in government who know the difference between a computer and a monitor."

You pick one door of 100. The presenter dude closes 98 doors. Do you switch? Obviously yes, you had a 1/100 chance of getting it right, which means the only other door available is now 99/100."
