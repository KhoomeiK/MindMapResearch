Also you seem to forget that  as much as China is a dictatorial country, they do need general support from the public. CCP is very sensitive about it.

Now if it's just one human, that's a different story. But it's too much of a risk for 3 wolves to handle a dog and a human. 1-2 could sustain injuries which could mean death in the wild.

I'm not the biggest Jordan Peterson's fan. But he made a salient point back then when he talked about how the 10% of the US population has lower than IQ of 83 and we need to do something about it. I know IQ is not a reliable way of measuring intelligence, but we do have to admit that if we have 30 million people who are in the bottom 10% of any intelligence measurement, it behooves us to educate them for a better future of the country and society. But no. We decided to segregate them into poor areas in each region, and forget about it in our safe, cozy, polished neighborhood. 

We need people and society to look at our country's future in long and big perspective.
