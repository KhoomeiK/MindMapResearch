science,fes5hlf,t1_fes4udz,1579361611.0,That would actually make a very fascinating experiment. Higher average body temperature  should (ideally) mean poor healthcare facilities.

Keep us updated and stay safe OP!"
science,ferv4em,t1_fers35d,1579358614.0,That's a fair point but I do think that the gradual change in our environment is another important factor
science,ferrkjj,t1_ferqi62,1579357541.0,"Mhm. It's crazy to think that sometime in the 1800's though, it was a little higher. We've just adapted to our changing environment."

premed,fctuzdu,t1_fctue16,1577960907.0,"I completely understand where you are coming from. If I constantly doubt myself I will never really get anywhere. Being a doctor also calls for lifelong commitment to the subject, so thinking about your life goals and where you want to see yourself in the future is important."

premed,fctgpva,t1_fctadao,1577942719.0,"Just the thought of not knowing where life will take us down the road is overwhelming, but no one really does, and that's the best part of it all. I think I never thought about the fact that if you love something enough, you will have the motivation to do it. You made that pretty clear so thank you. Thank you for also making it clear that everyone goes through something like this and that it's pretty normal. Really appreciate it!"
premed,fctfyv3,t1_fct6um2,1577942028.0,"Thank You! I think your analogy really just helped me see what having a passion for a career is like and it is no different from the passion one has for any other hobby. I think I needed just that and you delivered, so thank you once again.

I wouldn't say I have a particular reason but yes I do want to be financially independent by maybe 26. When I made the post, I was in a pretty dark place and everything just seemed overwhelming, hence the 'But I feel like right now, I don't even think I would be able to do that.'"
