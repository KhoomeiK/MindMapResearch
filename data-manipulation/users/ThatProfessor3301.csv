AskProfessors,ffpcaze,t3_eufv6o,1580091477.0,"I would email asking if you could be an adjunct. Then I would mention being willing to teach a course about x specifically. If they are interested, they can offer it under “special topics” or something like that without going through the long process of having the course approved."
RightCantMeme,ffm4905,t3_eu16fq,1580048182.0,So. Many. Questions.
Professors,ffm43uv,t1_ffjtc8z,1580048075.0,"It’s not just when she teaches. I met her off campus for lunch once and she wore that.

I don’t think it’s bad. I just cannot imagine wearing high heels unless it was the most important of occasions."
Professors,ffjcwmv,t3_etw04y,1579995639.0,"It’s not bad but I work in a regional university in the management department. So not a fancy business school.

We hired a professor who always wears high heels and dresses... like always, not just when she teaches. The rest of us are either business casual or just casual. I always wonder if she thinks we are slobs."
Professors,ffiilnm,t1_ffiglks,1579974742.0,This is what everyone should be telling students. I am in management. We have a good job market. I still talk people out of doing a PhD. It’s not for everybody.
AskAcademia,ffi03p7,t3_etp3yn,1579960940.0,"Try the academic job market. It depends on which social science you are in . I would take a cc job rather than an industry job.

I’m in the business school, there’s tons of jobs for us. There are bridging programs that can make you employable in a aacsb accredited business school."
AskAcademia,ffhzxp9,t1_ffhxqbj,1579960776.0,It depends on the university (system). My health insurance is fully covered by my university. I don’t know anyone in the private sector who an say that.
AskProfessors,ffhznkz,t1_ffhw0iw,1579960494.0,"I ha so many students, I don’t have time to ponder implications. Move on."

I only give them 1 - 2 per day. They are skinny like straws because my dogs are small."
nextdoor,fff8ohu,t3_etbhiv,1579878475.0,This is great. It's nextdoor Karen. Older than regular Karen but still annoying.
RightCantMeme,fff8dso,t3_et2syn,1579878270.0,I love it. Fox news hasn't mentioned it so it must not exist yet.
AskAcademia,fff797z,t3_et9ub0,1579877490.0,"This sucks.

When you are in this situation, you are truly competing for the job. I don't know if you saw it that way though.

We had an internal candidate once, and she put very little energy into the process. She's a nice person but her presentation was one of the worst I have ever seen. Later, I heard she was having personal issues. None of this matters when you are interviewing, unfortunately.

We hired a candidate who asked good questions, had an amazing presentation and put in a lot of effort and energy."
AskProfessors,ffdrazy,t3_et1nbr,1579827013.0,"I have strict deadlines. I think some professors feel pressure from peers or self imposed pressure to be kind to students because they perceive that some students are overwhelmed and don’t know how to deal with the world. 

I honestly don’t think most students are helped by lax deadlines but that’s just my opinion."

Okay, maybe the course objectives. Who cares about those really?"
AskAcademia,ff9b4i1,t1_ff94dy5,1579708942.0,I have done this as a reviewer. Minor revisions may improve readability (doesn't like that it was the case here though) and then I really see the problems with the paper.
AskAcademia,ff9avoo,t1_ff975xt,1579708786.0,Something like this is the case in Texas. Check with someone at the university you are targeting.

I also remember coming home on second grade and telling my mom that I hated Jews. The boy sitting next to me was annoying me and he was Jewish so .,. Do you want to know what my mom did? She told my uncles because she thought it was cute that I said that. 

Gross. I’m an adult now and I’m horrified."
AskAcademia,ff6iuok,t3_erx4yu,1579628136.0,"I have a PhD in management. Doing a PhD in business and working in academia is very different than your finance job. A PhD in finance pays very well in academia (I’m guessing around $160k in an R1). The job market is not saturated. You will find a job months before graduation.

I recommend that you investigate this path. Talk to professors in both fields. Ask about the job (not just salary, but employment opportunities, culture, etc.) not just the PhD program. 

If you are a racial minority, look into the PhD project.

A PhD in finance will take 4 to 5 years. There are no legitimate part time phds in business."

Cringetopia,fdqpvtn,t3_emq6u1,1578672320.0,So the fetus turns into an English-speaking baby in heaven (?). Yeah ... okay ...
AskAcademia,fdqpqhf,t3_emqy6u,1578672226.0,"Relationships (with professors or people in general) are reciprocal. If you like a professor and invest time and effort in her class, she will like you. If the 'liking' is superficial (student likes my jokes or my outfit), my liking will also be superficial. But if he likes what I have said and the way I explain something... then I like that student."

ApplyingToCollege,fdp45au,t1_fdoptz8,1578619564.0,Any international student can see the writing on the wall. Heâ€™s trying to cut back immigration.why else do you think they come to study here?
college,fdoeu1l,t1_fdobw3m,1578603784.0,"I am a professor with a type A syllabus. Students have told me that they thought I'd be an a--hole but that in person, I'm much nicer."
college,fdo5gae,t3_em9mqb,1578599224.0,I used to be in one of these committees. Pretty much every MBA applicant wrote about how their dad was their role model and inspiration. I get that they may have come from old-fashioned families where women didn't have a job outside the home but please write about an uncle or grandma ... someone else?
ApplyingToCollege,fdo3y0h,t1_fdncfdw,1578598454.0,"... for whatever reason?

Because the orange one is making it clear that America is going to express their xenophobia more openly. Also visa restrictions."

AskAcademia,fdn6jb3,t3_em8abl,1578578653.0,"We interviewed a guy who asked about the gym. Then he turned to a colleague of mine and told him, ""You obviously don't use the gym."" My colleague was not skinny but also not overweight. 

Needless to say, this dude didn't get an offer."

Professors,fdlxe64,t3_elvaqm,1578534781.0,"I (woman) have not experienced much of this. I am sure it happens to many women though.

I post this in case it is helpful to anyone. My policies are super rigid. My syllabus reads like Iâ€™m an a***hole. But in person, Iâ€™m actually super easygoing and if a student faces an actual crisis, I give her/him an extension.

This treatment of women is not fair but itâ€™s not likely to go away either. Trying different tactics may help."
AskProfessors,fdiq4f4,t1_fdid8k2,1578448526.0,"Someone may look at it as reason why your gpa is low, rather than lack of effort or ability. Others may look at it as if you didnâ€™t get as much knowledge from undergrad as you should have, regardless of the reason."
Professors,fdi88yi,t1_fdi749c,1578437500.0,They are not selling 'notes'. They are selling papers and quizzes. Maybe some notes here and there ...

Also, what am I missing?"
Professors,fdi3zyq,t1_fdi1m5q,1578435329.0,"If you use textbook exam banks, those are copyrighted. Also, itâ€™s in my syllabus that they are not allowed to upload documents from class.

I cannot copyright a studentâ€™s work either."

Professors,fdhrvbh,t1_fdhqb4k,1578428966.0,My university doesnâ€™t. They say that we should vary our assignments and tests instead! So all I can do is try to find who uploads something and ask them to take it down.
AskAcademia,fdhj1dd,t1_fdgiq0i,1578423684.0,"This. You only know the professors who got jobs. You don't know the ones with PhDs who ended up working in something else after searching for a job several years in a row.

Humanities is not the way to go if you want financial stability."

ApplyingToCollege,fdflwq9,t3_el2jab,1578364741.0,I donâ€™t see how being without guidance prevents you from submitting things on time though. Thatâ€™s just a basic life skill.
college,fdf2ehg,t3_ekwk7a,1578351750.0,Professor here. I make students partner up. Each student introduces their partner. They share answers about their worst haircut and favorite restaurant. I hope nobody dreads it. Itâ€™s meant to be an ice breaker.
college,fdf17m6,t3_ekxla9,1578350998.0,"Did you actually calculate your average? Donâ€™t email or complain to anyone until you do that. Maybe you earned that f. (Or D, whatever)."
Professors,fdemdfr,t1_fde9y80,1578342076.0,Agree. Especially because that advise is usually based on hearsay.
Professors,fdem896,t1_fde2xoc,1578341990.0,"I suspect you have adequate high schools. American high schools are very heterogeneous. Some are very good and well-funded, others not so much. You cannot assume that students who enter college know basic math or that they have writing skills.

Does this sound sad? It is."

Don't just be a show off, contribute with helpful comments in class."

college,fdcoo07,t1_fdanurw,1578280159.0,"I had the same experience last semester. Two students in an online class were experiencing homelessness. I told them to speak to the office of the Dean of students. They were able to help at least one of the students.

In general, itâ€™s good to disclose major hardship and illness early on rather than wait until you miss a deadline or something happens."
Professors,fda1lzp,t3_ek8o81,1578240678.0,"There is no gossip going around. But if I were to start a rumor it would be about the Dean taking a long winter break (is he interviewing?). His wife was a VP of something and got demoted so maybe they are both looking for a job. 

Coincidentally there is a new nepotism policy so he is breaking it if he stays."

Iâ€™m curious to hear what the advantages are from someone who has done this."

college,fd67gfa,t1_fd66aow,1578186639.0,"They donâ€™t â€œmakeâ€ it confusing. Accounting is hard for students because they have never done it before and it involves numbers. 

Itâ€™s required because employers need you to know this. Itâ€™s a business core course not a gen ed course."
