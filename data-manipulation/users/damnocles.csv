todayilearned,ffxiywr,t1_ffxhxbd,1580326088.0,"First thing I thought. Something with that level of intelligence shouldn't be 'owned' except in very particular circumstances, if in fact it does possess it. Even *less* so when referring to a huge fucking bird of all things. 

Animals in cages make me sad as is, let alone the type of animals that have wings."

No, no I do not see irony in that. I see an absolute scourge being steadily deleted from humankind. Call me whatever you want, but I give exactly zero fucks that your disgusting beliefs are being eradicated.
