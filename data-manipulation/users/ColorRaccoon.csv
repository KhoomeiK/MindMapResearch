sabrina,ffy0mtt,t1_ffxxlaz,1580336186.0,"Just finished the season. Yes you're right, it still feels weird though the fact that having Lucifer's blood means nothing. I understand she has mortal blood, but it appears to me that being a Morningstar matters only when it's useful for the plot. She lost her powers just like any other regular witch, and then she was like ""I'm more powerful now"" what why. 

She is a badass when the plot requires it and then she's stupid when the plot requires it and while I get she's a teenager, it doesn't feel like the same person at times with the decisions she make."
