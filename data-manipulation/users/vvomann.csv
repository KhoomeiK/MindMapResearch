bipolar,ff9lc42,t1_feu9mak,1579715415.0,"Omg I had 8 mugs, 4 glasses, 2 plates, a bowl and a bunch of cutlery that I took out before filming this lol. It’s so bad—but it’s okay"
bipolar,ff9l9dj,t1_feuavyh,1579715371.0,Yay! Thank you!
bipolar,ff9l8u9,t1_fevcdsv,1579715362.0,"Do the best you can love. Always help yourself before you try and help someone else. It won’t always be like this, you have each other and that’s such a beautiful thing <3"
bipolar,ff9l4vs,t1_few3voz,1579715298.0,"I have been reading and working through all the comments and I have never in my life felt so unconditionally loved and supported, I feel no judgement and only acceptance. It’s overwhelming in the most beautiful way. I never thought I’d find my people, but knowing this sub exists is enough to get me through those hard days <3"
bipolar,ff9l0b8,t1_fezerwy,1579715223.0,"I really hope you did! And if not, there’s always tomorrow <3 sending love"
bipolar,ff9kydl,t1_feto5z3,1579715191.0,"Yeah I think about that all the tine. My life is a roller coaster compared to all my friends and family around me—and maybe that comparison is what’s inherently making me feel so much guilt. 

And I’m with you on the acid 😛 so healing in the right setting"
bipolar,ff9kskw,t1_fetqh6r,1579715096.0,I’m not too sure if I’m ready for something like that but if that changes I can let you know :) thanks for reaching out and for the work in awareness that you do <3
bipolar,ff9kq1r,t1_feppijl,1579715055.0,"Yeah. I’m always grateful. When the abuse was bad, I would wish my BP1 dad wasn’t in the picture anymore but it’s gotten better and he’s not an alcoholic anymore. I’m still very grateful. 

I’m sorry if you don’t have your parents. That must be really hard. Sometimes I think about when I’ll lose mine, and I become accepting of it more when I realize how much of them I carry in me. My personality, my mannerisms, the small things. But also the big things, my passions in music and cinema and art especially—trying to live ethically and compassionately. My siblings and I will carry their memory on that way no matter what. 

I wish nothing but the best for you <3"
bipolar,ff9k80d,t1_ff8ht5b,1579714759.0,"Honestly I can relate to not wanting to share anything. I’m always writing up comments or posts then thinking “what’s even the point”. 

I think for me the anti-depression and anti-anxiety meds I’ve been put on are working. It’s been a little over a month now and I’m feeling okay with participating in small ways.

I didn’t think anyone would watch this, or comment, or care but I guess I was wrong. The support has been so kind. 

I’m trying to be more open with my experiences and be kinder to my heart and forgive myself for what has happened, what I’ve done, and ultimately who I am. This is it, this is everything I have and I need to be okay with all of it. Cleaning is therapeutic and I was feeling good that day and I wanted to document it for myself. I felt really proud of myself and this overwhelming task doesn’t seem so big when I time lapsed it like that"

JusticeServed,fezldht,t1_feyjjhe,1579458592.0,"I don’t find this funny at all, but truly terrifying. I can’t even imagine what reality is being played out in her mind. I truly hope she gets the help she needs. I think people need to witness mental health in alll it’s varying forms so we can understand it better, rather than laugh or start confronting someone aggressively if we see them in a psychotic state. 

Thank you for the work that you do and the understanding you provide."

bipolar,fewkfyn,t1_feppkyb,1579412613.0,Awww this story is so beautiful. Makes me see a light at the end of this tunnel. It’s funny because while I was on the drugs they gave me I kept going off about how much I love nurses and how helpful they are and how I just wanna help people and kept telling them how I was going to become a nurse. It was pretty funny but who knows? Congrats on your baby girl! She’s lucky to have you ❤️

bipolar,feucct7,t1_fepcrm6,1579385242.0,"Thank you :) I’ve been trying to make it as cozy as possible. I used to have it painted black and it was a literal cave with black out curtains, but the white walls and art help me a lot. This diagnosis is so messy and hard and confusing. I feel you on that for sure. I feel like I’m always taking 1 step forward and 10000 back."
bipolar,feubts8,t1_fep7xp4,1579385065.0,"Thanks you! Yes, the hardest. It feels so overwhelming like everything else. It’s too heavy"

I’m trying so hard to be more organized and keep structure—it’s so easy to slip back but I need to change my perspective on it and see it as an act of self love. To respect my own space and environments. We got this."
bipolar,feteb5u,t1_fep85j3,1579374522.0,This comment really hit me hard. I don’t feel like a strong woman but you saying I am made me feel stronger. You don’t know me but you don’t judge either and that’s all I need. Thank you so much. The pain is heavy but the unconditional love and understanding you have given me makes it lighter ❤️
bipolar,fetdzru,t1_fepcxv9,1579374404.0,I freaking diddddd! Finally!!! Things are looking up I think ❤️
bipolar,fetdwwi,t1_fepj2eg,1579374376.0,"I’ve started to use that term more openly with family and friends so they understand why my floor is covered in clothes and garbage. Why I only sleep on 1/4 of my bed because the rest is taken up by stuff. It’s the only space where I feel safe, where I sleep away all the overwhelming thoughts. 

I believe you can do this. It’s an act of pure self love, I think we all need more of that. Sending you so so so much love."
bipolar,fetdhw0,t1_fephhfz,1579374230.0,"Exactly. I have so much trouble finding motivation to do things for my self. This is an act of pure self love, so long over due"

ENFPMusic,fel2i0o,t3_epqgfa,1579212642.0,It’s beautiful.
AmItheAsshole,feemr4n,t3_eoq0fz,1579036903.0,NTA. My family has lived in front of a school/park for 28 years and we have heard kids playing/screaming outside everyday of living here. It’s hardly a bother. If I do hear some “screams” I will peak my head out to check on the kids to make sure they are okay but I have never once thought that children in a park should be quiet. That’s ridiculous. They need to get their energy out and it’s better that it’s outside than indoors. If they don’t like the location of the park they need to take that up with the city and get evidence that it’s causing a disturbance.
