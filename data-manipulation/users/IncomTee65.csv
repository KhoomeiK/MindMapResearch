""Using"" or ""wielding"" the force for a Jedi is about faith. Luke realized this in the climax of A New Hope. Rey realized this in the climax of Force Awakens. Rey let go of all of her doubts and let the force guide her every action. That is how she beat Kylo. The force willed it and she allowed that will to guide her. 

Also, we know that force sensitivity, that level of guidance the force can provide, is hereditary. Rey has a pretty strong force heritage..."

The original trilogy changed filmmaking forever while telling a classic heroe's story. So to see the prequels throw out all rules of filmmaking and story telling to make the mess that they are was disheartening. And then to see Disney, a production company know for their heartfelt character stories, rush a trilogy storyline to where they didn't even plan out their character arcs was frustrating. Star Wars holds significant cultural importance and deserved more time and respect than it's later iterations received."
