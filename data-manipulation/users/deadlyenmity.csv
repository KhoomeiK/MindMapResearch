Every time you get this feeling you have a choice. You can give into the overwhelming feeling, and make it the truth or you can fight against it and do something, anything. Even if it’s the tiniest little nothing, it’s at least a little something and those add up over time.

Journeys like this are hard because you can only really see your progress after a long length of time, but one day you’re either going to look back and realize that you made so much progress even though it barely felt like you did or you’ll be standing in the same spot realizing that you had so much time. 

You’re in that second spot right now, and you can’t even drink yet. This may feel like the pits of despair but you have a secret that puts you ahead of everyone else. Most people don’t realize this feeling until it’s too late. You’re just out of the gate. The road is open ahead of you. Use this feeling to fuel you. Every time you feel the hopelessness do anything at to make progress.

You’re not incorrect. There are instances where this could be totally innocuous. It could be young girls bragging about the fact that they text drake when in reality they only exchange a few messages.

And you are right that people are making assumptions but that’s based off of drakes past behavior. He has a repeated thing with underaged girls and it’s becoming kind of apparent that these aren’t one off things.

The reason people take such a hard stance on it is because for a long time people in his position would get away with with child abuse because signs like this were ignored.

People think it’s everyone being over sensitive but it’s really about calling out that behavior and removing the safety that they feel that allows them to continue their abuse. And unfortunately a lot of men see that as an attack on them because suddenly women hold a lot more power in sexual interactions and that makes them uncomfortable. Before men could act with impunity and even if you made people uncomfortable nothing would really happen to you. The thing with inequality is when you’re working to create parity between groups, help to the ones in need will feel like oppression to the ones that are ahead because they’re losing these advantages that they’ve had their whole lives. Advantages that might not have actually done anything for them or they might not have ever had to use so it feels unfair but these advantages allow people to abuse others and the fact that anyone has it at all is what creates the space for it to exist.
