pics,fdgpwoi,t1_fdgmc8o,1578405198.0,"Those were my own opinions. I looked that quote up afterwards. But nice try to undermine my integrity. Why would I use my precious time and waste it on you? You have made up your mind and I don't see any reason to continue discussing the issue. You appear to be an ignorant and arrogant person. You excuse me of thing that you do yourself, just like Trump does. Quite clearly a projection. Go live your ignorant life then. And calling me not being objective? Don't make me laugh. As a scientist, I am obliged to being objective. Can't say the same for you. Once you have build up a perception of the world, you will ignore any information to the contrary. Your brain is already taking up about 20% of your energy, so changing the way you think is going to be quite cognitively costly. Maybe you should still try before it's too late. It appears I can't help you with that. I'll ignore you from now on."
pics,fdgllbq,t1_fdgf6m1,1578401428.0,"Just to finish of my point: The British historian Jane Caplan, for example, wrote an analysis in November 2016 directly addressing the question of whether or not Trump was a fascist.
Caplan didn’t reach any definite conclusions, but she did point out quite a few striking similarities between the rise of fascism in Germany then and the current political climate in the United States now. In short, she feels that America is in a vulnerable position right now – one that radical forces can use to their advantage.
A few months later, Yale historian Timothy Snyder published “On Tyranny.” His book similarly concludes that America under Trump bears striking similarities to Germany in the interwar period and reads like something of a how-to manual for resisting the rise of authoritarianism in today’s America."
pics,fdgkm4z,t1_fdgf6m1,1578400471.0,"Ok I can see that you are not able discussing this issue on a rational level. You misread my text and by insulting me shows that you are way too emotional. 
But just one example since you asked. The disregard to human life I was referring to, was the drowned Mexican father and daughter which he kind of made fun of or at least dismissed. 
Like I said, it's a different scale and extremism between Trump and Hitler but the **patterns** and **tendencies** are similar. If you can't see that, I think it's hopeless to argue with you. BTW, I'm not the only one that has stated those similarities. Many scholars in Germany (and around the world) have made the same observations. 
Anyways, I don't want to waste any more of my time writing long texts to someone who is clearly not willing to step back and take an unbiased look at what Trump has done so far. At least that's what I can gather from your response. Have a good day."
pics,fdgcdm3,t1_fdetzhv,1578389910.0,"You seem like a rational person so I'll elaborate but try to keep is short. First of all, I only said he is **basically** a Nazi so of course there are differences but there are also a lot of similarities. Here are some examples: 

* Hate speech, 
* Nationalism, 
* Incarceration of minorities, 
* Nepotism, 
* Separation of children from their parents, 
* Threats to political opponents, 
* Disregard of human life, 

I could go on but I think it already proves my point. Please take 30 minutes and read a history book on how Adolf came to power up until he started the war. The similarities are astounding. Of course A's acts were worse and much bigger in scale but he also had more time. I hope Trump does not get that much time, because I fear that he is capable of the same acts. I used that strong word because I want to trigger people to wake up. Back in the 1930s we Germans did not call him out soon enough. We let him do his atrocious acts for too long and ended up with WW2. I believe he Trump gets his way, he might be capable of bringing us back to the stone age. It really isn't about my political view (I disagreed with GWB but still respected him) but this POTUS is a DANGER to the whole planet."
