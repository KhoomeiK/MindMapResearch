SuicideWatch,ff1dml2,t1_fez18vf,1579477826.0,Checked myself in. At this point I’ll try anything. But honestly I’m losing the little hope it gave me.
SuicideWatch,fert2q3,t1_feo72k4,1579358079.0,That was the point asshole
SuicideWatch,felxfqi,t1_feld9nl,1579233377.0,"Damn, I don’t have any words. I just got out of the psych ward - it actually gave me hope. If you’re still here I hope you call an ambulance. Sometimes an attempt is what we need to realize we don’t actually want to die."
SuicideWatch,fdr4w2j,t1_fbxh8mo,1578679561.0,"My standards aren’t even high, it’s just that when I decide I like someone I’m just fucked. Like my whole body operates differently. It’s weird though, like I’ve got this fear of intimacy even though that’s what I want most, maybe because I’ve never experienced it and feel like I never will."
SuicideWatch,fdkyll7,t1_fcm1kdj,1578513833.0,"I feel that, like I don’t want anything to happen to my dog, but it would mean I can finally leave this world. Huge paradox."
SuicideWatch,fc3cikb,t1_fc2qw7o,1577386772.0,"Thank you for writing all that. And about that guy in college I know I wasn’t drunk that night because it was early into college and I hadn’t yet made friends to get drunk with, nor was I old enough to buy alcohol. If anything, I just smoked a little weed, watched Dexter and fell asleep. So you can imagine my surprise waking up next to someone I had only met once or twice. It’s entirely possible nothing happened but I ruminate about any and everything. Thanks again for the kind words."
