In English, words for Animal/Meat of the Animal are usually paired between the German animal name and the French rooted meat name. The way I think of it is the aristocrat ordering the food speaks french, the guy slaughtering the animal spoke German, and the chef in the kitchen had to learn both so he could tell the guy what need to be slaughtered.  ""Cow"" being a germanic word for the animal where as ""Bovine"" is the Latin word, but ""Beef"" is the Latin rooted word for meat of the Cow.  You can see this in most animal/meat pairs: swine/pork, deer/venison, chicken/poultry. Also why specific cuts of meat usually have french root words (or just direct imports) such as loin or fillet.

It took ~100 years before the Norman aristocrats supposedly knew enough English to be able to speak it in a conversational form.  Prior to that, most aristocrats were raised with family in Normandy, not in Britain.  Britain was essentially a satellite extension to their already existing kingdom in Normandy, not a new home that everyone flocked to.

> Dr Kay, who was the lead author on [one of the largest reviews on pre-performance stretching (PDF, 307kb)](https://www.anatomytrains.com/wp-content/uploads/manual/acute_stretch.pdf), believes the reduction in performance from pre-exercise stretching has been overstated. ""It is likely that durations of stretch used in the warm-up routines of most recreational exercisers produce negligible and transient reductions in strength,"" he says.

The NHS page does seem to be consistent in stating that stretching does increase range of motion.  And that's pretty much what we're after when stretching for an activity like jogging.  Likely for a legitimate couch potato, when starting something like C25K the range of motions your body is going through are *not* within your *normal* range of motion.  In addition, as you get more exhausted through your exercise, you pay less attention to posture or environmental variables that may impact how your foot strikes the uneven ground.  Small stumbles that could cause you to move outside your normal range of motion may actually be within your stretched range of motion - which could reduce the total injury, or avoid it entirely, and that's all we're really aiming for.


Personally for me, after a light 2 minute jog + a few jumping jacks and windmills I did general stretching for 10 minutes.  Then C25k for 30 minutes. Then general stretching for 10 minutes, and targeted stretching for another 10 to continue to limber up specific areas I knew from my own experience would have some issus like knee & hip (bursitis), lower back (stiffness), and calves (general muscle soreness)"
