WarshipPorn,ffiux95,t1_ffiedr5,1579983337.0,"It's unfortunate, though I guess not history wise if they had a better navy things could have gone wrong...

But the reason for their bad design is after ww1 Germany was not allowed to build warships and were also banned from researching submarines (they did that anyways) so when they needed a navy quickly they just went off the knowledge they had from ww1, which considering the insane amount of progression in technology was quite outdated, this is why they used the turtleback armour scheme not only on the battleships but also on the ships in question, the hipper class cruisers, this was ineffective on the battleships because it took up a lot of space so a lot of vital tech was placed above the waterline and wasn't heavily protected, on the cruisers this problem was even bigger, although the radar and gunnery tech the Germans had was impressive for the amount of time they had to develop it"
