Well because we grew up in different time periods and are at different life stages naturally we gonna have a lot of differences in our personalities, views/values, abilities. Personally I think it really helps to balance out each other.

I wonder if people who are looking for partner will usually look for someone similar? I mean it's a lot easier to build life together when you agree on most things.

I don't want to build my life with someone, I want to complement each other on their own personal life journey."
