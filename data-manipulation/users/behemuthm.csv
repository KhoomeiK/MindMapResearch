The only one that is remotely close is Darrows in Carson. I’ve been eating at Darrows since their MDR location in 2003. Sadly, the landlord tripled their rent and their second location in Carson became their only location.

Cool thing is their poboys are really decent (cornmeal on the shrimp!) and they have a brisket poboy which is super tasty. The beignets are overcooked unless you tell them to make em light.

Humans evolved from Africa over tens of millions of minutes and migrated across the Middle East and Asia across the Alaskan land bridge in the 80s. By the early 90s, the reduced amounts of sunlight naturally reduced the pigment of their skin (lighter skin can absorb more Vitamin D in lower UV climates).  By the early 2000s, we see the spread of Austronesian peoples from Southeast Asia to Australia and eventually the Polynesian peoples, all with differing amounts of skin pigmentation due to their local  amounts of UV. Unfortunately, not too many fossils exist from the great migration of the 80s, save for a few skeletal bone fragments. Fortunately, archeologists are dedicated to fill in the gaps where needed for a more complete picture as to what exactly happened in human evolution over the last 26 million minutes."

Societies that are nonreligious tend to have higher education, while heavily religious areas have lower test scores and more obstacles to teachers. And I’m not just talking the US.

Another issue is income inequality - lower income areas suffer disproportionately. We need to really bring up the education quality in these areas.

The matte paintings and matte edges are *really* obvious in Blade Runner. Think you need to rewatch it. Rose-tinted glasses for sure.

And the reason you can see all those optical mattes flickering in Jedi is because the gamma is different from when it was shown theatrically. I promise you, when Jedi was shown on 35mm film in a properly-projected cinema, you didn’t see the garbage mattes (which are the rough shapes that were cut to hold out various elements during printing). Perfect example of the contrast difference would be [the Emperor’s face](http://agraphafx.com/StarNet/Newstuff/cgi.html). I’m guessing Jim H is Jimbo Hillin but Terry Molatore was the artist who painted those black blobs. She was horrified when she first saw Jedi on VHS because you could see her painted blobs on either side of the Emperor’s head which *in no way* could you see in the theater originally. In fact, if she’d known it would’ve been such a big deal, she would’ve held a mask shape rather than painting every frame (she would’ve been better off doing this anyway but Jedi was her first roto job). I worked with Terry at IMD and Jimbo at Sony. But remember they checked all this stuff in dailies, just like we do now, and the end battle shots had to be reprinted multiple times, and in some cases we’re talking printing over a hundred passes *per frame*.

Anyway, cut these guys some slack and show some respect. This was almost 40 years ago and they were absolutely pushing the envelope, and their work was legendary. You have *no idea* [how much work](https://youtu.be/ONDQVeoKiZw) these films were to make."

There was a lighting artist on my team who couldn’t even do the most simple tasks. We called them aside and asked if there was a communications issue at all and they said not at all, and was really bright and cheerful about it. They didn’t get it that we were about to send them to HR. 

My supe finally did go to HR and HR said to give the artist one specific task and a week to get it done. During that week, we heard nothing from the artist. No updates, no shots in dailies, nothing.

When we confronted them at the end of the week, their shot had barely been touched, and only a few nodes were moved around. We couldn’t believe it.

HR called them in and gave them their notice. I’ve only heard this next part secondhand but apparently they freaked out on Facebook and claimed that we were all out to get them and that we’re a horrible company to work for. Keep in mind, this is at a place where I’ve spent over 15 years at and think it’s extremely well run and the people are great. But we don’t suffer fools. I felt we all bent over backwards for someone who clearly were out of their element. I’ve seen people wash out much faster than that, but that was one case that stuck out.

Other times, junior artists were putting work on their reels that weren’t theirs. And my friends are usually good about telling me when my work shows up in reels at other places.

LosAngeles,ffccw60,t1_ffc5u6m,1579796730.0,"No more old people in the White House. I want someone completely different who can unify this country. Someone who I see eye to eye with but who can also bring both sides together. Ask any Republican what they think of Bernie. He can’t just magically change. He’s been consistent for sure, but in no way do I see him unifying everyone. We need a different approach. Remember when Presidents at least tried to unify both sides? What was the first thing Obama said during his Chicago victory speech in 2008? Go and listen to that speech again and tell me honestly if you think Bernie could pull that off. 

I’m done with the divisiveness. This country is broken. The two party system is broken. Obama was a moderate centrist and I see Pete as one as well. That’s at least a start. If you want to bring in someone after that (who’s also not an old white man) who’s more left, at least we would be warmed up in 8 years. But not now. We need to unify as a people first and start working on real solutions. I really, really like Pete’s plans:

* [The Douglas Plan](https://peteforamerica.com/policies/douglass-plan/) - working to dismantle the systemic racist structures which have been a part of this country since it was founded. It’s not “affirmative action” it’s an investment into communities 

* [The Infrastructure Plan](https://peteforamerica.com/policies/infrastructure/) - Remember in 2008 when the economy was in the toilet and Obama started all those federal projects for states to fix up their roads and bridges? This would expand on that idea, from clean drinking water to high speed Internet. 

* [Climate Change](https://peteforamerica.com/policies/climate/) - becoming net-zero on emissions by 2050. Because we have to.

[Full list of issues and plans here](https://peteforamerica.com/issues/). When I first heard Pete talk, there was this hopeful positive message that reminded me of JFK when he was debating Nixon in 1960. [Watch this debate](https://youtu.be/hdVHFESjTsE) and you’ll see what I mean. Here we had a young candidate with a hopeful message. And I feel that same sense of hope from Pete.

America needs to come together before we can start swinging our entire society in one direction or another. I have never seen our country so divided as it is now. And I feel Pete is the one who can really give this country what it needs Day 1 after Trump."
