Machinists,ffhxw9o,t1_ffhgvms,1579958656.0,"Continuing here...

The processes all have noted and programs linked to them. The program page has tools which all have a tool inventory system that tracks the tooling inventory for the tool crib. When tools need to be ordered, you click a button, say the quantity, and it notifies the ordering person. I’d like to have the system automatically check the tool inventory based on orders which is a simple script I’ll add.

The inprocess inspection and FAI create PDFs and save the files to your order folder.

The entire database actually structures the network drive while using it. It’ll create folders and place documents in correct areas as you use it.

The orders Gantt charts uses excel to keep track of machine schedules. Linking the access table to excel allows for a reasonable scheduling system as it’s harder just in access.

CARs, CIs, and ECRs are done in the system and will flag production through the part form.

Signing into a job is done on a PC, so I’m not really using tablets there. I have a plan to us DPRNT on the CNC to print the current program onto a shared folder and then fetching with a VB script to automatically sign into jobs. 

Measuring equipment, customer supplied material, and process records are all in the same system. 

The program page is linked to tools. My plan is to link this to MasterCAM so you’ll be able to select tools once while programming and you’re good to go. 

There’s a Pareto system built into the database when reporting errors. Basically, you can report how many parts you’ve made and then you need to report errors as well. There is a Pareto system where you select reason codes and write a story or add a picture. This is also linked to tools and Part families  in the event that you are having a unique tooling issue.

I think I covered the basics..."
Machinists,ffhxcom,t1_ffhgvms,1579958032.0,"I’ll try again.

The reason I create this system was to help companies that want to certify their quality management system do their tasks more quickly.

The system is really meant to consolidate managerial tasks. I’m not aiming for shops larger than 10 people but I’m sure it would work for larger shops. There are thousands of machine shops that have 10 or less people working for them and probably will never grow. 

I based the system off of the work I did to get certified for ISO9001:2018. My QMS was unique to the shop and is not a solution for everyone because as everyone should understand QMSs are not general applications but need to be unique to their shops.

The system starts with a quote estimator. It’s a customizable quoting tool. It requires a part number, revision, and customer. This tool then links to a quoting tool that creates a quote for the customer. It creates the quote into a PDF and sends you an email with the file using an email account that every customer makes for themselves. It’s not necessary to use the email but it was easier for me. 

When the customer sends a PO, you can select the estimates you made in the quote to create the order in your system. The PO form can be placed in a scanner and you click a button on the database, it’ll scan your file and place it in a unique folder.

Since you created the estimate in the quoting form, you can use the data you input to create a part number in your database with all the operations, programs, quality FAI, process inspection, manufacturing orders, etc."

AskEngineers,ffgs38f,t3_etc5ca,1579913628.0,"So my experience meeting people in big companies has been, “Yeah, I tried a startup for 7 years and decided to come here. I was promoted because I learned so much being hands on at the startup blah blah blah.” The perks of a startup are that a lot of times, you’re not working through the red tape of someone else’s design. You have a little more freedom to maneuver. The downside, you a lot of times are redesigning the wheel. You find that you need to spend a lot of time developing systems that exist. Then you realize the importance of those systems for larger companies. I always tell people, they’re going to learn where ever they go. You might learn how to do things right or you might learn how not to do things. It’s really hard to say what’s right and of course you’re making the decision for yourself"

CNC,ffgl4hq,t3_etcl0m,1579908745.0,"Ok, some important places to start are understanding the fundamental equations and relationships between chip load and tool diameter and sfm.

RPM = SFM * 3.82 / Diameter

Feed = RPM * Amount of Flute * Chip Load

Depth of cut changes based on the amount of radial cut. Most tool guides have suggestions and HarveyTool has great descriptions of this stuff.

I generally tap slow like 500 RPM on a 8-32 on 6061 and do a lot of peck tapping for steel. On a Haas peck tapping is funny but I can supply you an example if you’d like.

Know the difference between carbide, colbalt and HSS. This is key to knowing when to slow down and when to speed up.

Get your SFM suggestions from the tool supplier and make sure tool stick outs are appropriate to what you’re doing. Longer stickout, slower RPM and depth of cut. 

Please ask questions if you have them. Please also watch some YouTube videos about tools and how they cut. Tool suppliers usually have videos online"
