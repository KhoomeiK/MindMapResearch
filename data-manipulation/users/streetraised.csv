beermoney,ffe6hpw,t1_fczew3u,1579837991.0,How do you get these apps? Can’t find them in the iOS App Store. Are they on third party app stores? Haven’t found any app like Mistplay since I moved to IOS
cats,fey5r39,t1_fewi8my,1579441177.0,Lol so true.
personalfinance,feiygnj,t1_feilupz,1579150750.0,"Exactly! I completely understand that, and this doesn’t have to be your last. If you are a first home buyer, look into a first home buyers loan which have low interest rates blah blah. Google is your friend"
personalfinance,fehnez8,t3_ep5h4d,1579120076.0,"Don’t listen to these prude as people. Help your family out. We don’t always want to do these things but often is the best we can do to assure a better future for yourself and them. Besides after you buy the first home it’s easier to buy another. Take your time. Think it through, but know that it’s not only for them but for you as well."
personalfinance,fehn9zg,t1_fehbt9c,1579119996.0,"Dude it’s okay if your older, my brother in his 40s still lives with my parents but has always chipped in and helped them. My middle brother is disabled and a total nut job so he always stayed around. He feels guilty sometimes but now we’re buying a home together. Buy a multiplex, that way you have your own apartment. that was my brothers stipulation that he wanted his own apartment which I totally get because he’s older and wants to finally have his own spot."
personalfinance,fehn072,t3_ep5h4d,1579119839.0,"Do it. Helping each-other pay the morgage is easier than 2 people paying it. I’m currently in this position, looking for a home along with my older brother to buy with my family. My mother is 68, Dad is 70, and my middle brother disabled. My oldest brother and me are moving forward to buy a house together because one, paying a mortgage among 5 people is peanuts compared to two people as i mentioned. Also, my mom fainted/passed out Christmas Eve two years ago and we almost thought we lost her. It was crazy because my disabled brother and dad panicked and if my older brother wasn’t there idk what would have happened. This is what lead us to buying the home together."

depression,fdzsz7f,t1_fdx6fyb,1578795079.0,"And I’d be lying if I said I don’t have any insecurities now. Everyone has them. Even the people that look plastic and take a million selfies for social media. I work in the beauty business, you wouldn’t believe the prettiest people have the most insecurities, not that it would make you feel better, but I hope one day you chose to love your self a bit more. And I hope the same for me too."
depression,fdxcyz1,t1_fdx6fyb,1578767560.0,"I know how that is, but remember that you will grow into your body with age. Your gonna look cool as F in your 20s and 30s your going to be looking even more Sharp. H.S is like a war zone, people suck but it gets better I would say"

unpopularopinion,fdtlfxm,t1_f2o6gmo,1578718464.0,"Dude, don’t even bother. These people are not that critical with the information they chose to endure in Lol. That was interesting how you put that to rest. Research is your friend people."
depression,fdtic4w,t3_en17kx,1578717172.0,"Be as vocal as possible. Your doctor is there for you and paid by you. Whatever you don’t feel comfortable taking listen to yourself and let them know, they will often try other meds like without those symptoms. Best of wishes buddy. I have a brother who suffers with depression, and he often goes through the same thing, where he stops a medication cause it doesn’t make him feel good, but I try to tell him that he should tell the doctor everything he feels under a certain meds.
Virtual hugs your way"
