After decades of social interaction suffering I started to come to the conclusion that the magnitude of what happens in these situations is only really in my head. To me it was 95% obvious and all I can think about, to the other people present it is about 5% obvious, like if someone had a spot on their face and you glanced at it and thought about it for a few seconds. When you start to realise that it really doesn’t matter, and it is massively overinflated in your own mind, and that people actually like you, and that people actually want to spend more time with you, despite all the best efforts of your brain to contradict this reality - you start to feel much better about yourself!!"

TRUMP: Well -- you have to give him credit. I spoke to him very recently, and he's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And -- he does good at rockets too, by the way. I never saw where the engines come down with no wings, no anything, and they're landing. I said I've never seen that before. And I was worried about him, because he's one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius.
