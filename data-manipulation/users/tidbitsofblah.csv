theydidthemath,fgf2hpb,t1_fgeqq0x,1580720826.0,This still matters. If the sunset takes longer it means the horizontal speed is lower. It's because the sun travels at a smaller and smaller angle towards the horizon the further from the equator you are. And if the horizon speed is lower it will be visible for the giraffe for longer.

If I want to tell a story about someone I want to have a word to describe them that accurately describes what role they play in my life when it's relevant to the story, and often it is.

I have one person who I haven't found a lable I'm comfortable with for.. and it gets complicated to talk about him when the fact that we sleep together regularly is relevant. I don't need a lable in my interactions with him, just with others."

climatechange,ffxj7qc,t1_ffm9ww5,1580326229.0,Climate science definitely doesn't just exist as long as there is hysteria around the issue. Climate science from before there was an hysteria around it is for example how it was discovered that we had this issue. And this is kind of the case with science in general.
nonmonogamy,ffrhito,t3_eunxos,1580158139.0,"I relate very much to all of this. I've never found myself in your particular situation. But I feel the same about the idea of openness being the most important. I crush on people a lot but it rarely goes to the point of a relationship. But I want to feel like I can interact with people without worrying if I'm flirting or crossing any lines.. because apparently I'm very flirty without really trying.

A thing I had for a whilr with my ex who I was monogamous with was One ""free pass"". As in an ok to sleep with someone, not specified, just anyone, Once. Then the pass would be used so if it had been difficult for him to handle, he would know it was a one time thing. And I wasn't trying to use it, but it felt so much better to know that I had it in case. It didn't change my behaviour, it just made me not feel guilty and trapped and shit like that.

But I don't think I would be comfortable in entering a monogamous arrangement. I would probably be tempted if I found myself in your situation. But I have a hard time picturing myself actually falling for someone who doesn't share at least the same basic view about not wanting those strict rules in a relationship... But that's probably easy to say"

DesignDesign,ffovih5,t1_ffojday,1580082329.0,"If it's a thing you need to change 5 times a day then I'd agree. But this you probably only change for just some specific ocations.

I have a dining table that folds. It has 3 modes. Fully folded, where it takes very little space but you can't use it; half folded, where you can use it to eat at two or 3 people; and max size, where you can fit 6 people (8 if you squeeze).

I have it half folded 90% of the time. But it is very useful to have a space to eat or play board games if I invite a few people over. Or to be able to fold it away entirely if I invite a lot of people or need extra floor space to play VR or something. These tables seems like the same type of thing to me. Mostly they'll be folded, but sometimes you have guests and needs a lot of tables and then it's great.

If it were a table that doubled as a bed or something else like that so that I would have to keep switching back and forth cor everyday use, that would get annoying really fast though."

Especially when you love them and wants to be with them, but you are just not compatible because no matter what you do, one of you will be miserable.

Walking away when you notice you are hurting someone, even though you don't want to, is hard as it is. It becomes *so much harder* when the other person can't see how much you are hurting them by staying and is telling you that you'll hurt them more by leaving. That it'll hurt them so much that they won't want to live.

therewasanattempt,ffelm0e,t1_ffd981v,1579853274.0,"It's separated. Which is what you asked about.

I agree that it sounds less demeaning. In the -man cases it just seems like the scenario was: at first only men did it, as, with most trades because women weren't allowed to work, so the name happened to include ""man""... so then when women started working as those things we obviously needed a name that didn't have ""man"" in it. It's based in the history of women not being allowed to work, but there is no value about men or women in it.

While with actress and waitress it seems more like the process when women started getting into the trade went something like ""if it's a woman doing it she's not a *proper* actor/waiter so we need another word for what it is that she is""... Which is much more demeaning, yes.

And taking into account that this happened with words like actor/actress and waiter/waitress... it seems likely that it would have been the attitude about police-/fire- and mailwomen too.

Then there's the situations where neither policeman or policewoman would work, for example because you don't know the gender of the police officer you are talking about. So sometimes the gender neutral version would be more accurate even if it's less descriptive."

bi_irl,ff90d09,t1_ff8x3cg,1579701609.0,"I relate to ""angry-crushing"". When you crush on someone in a way that makes you angry. It is not that I think the person I'm crushing on isn't good enough for me to have a crush on or anything like that. It's more like the same as being angry when you see a cute animal. The ""it's so cute I want to strangle it to death"" thing. Cute aggression (https://www.techtimes.com/articles/236948/20181231/what-cute-aggression-study-finds-brain-response-much-adorableness-lead.htm) That coupled with crushing being a pretty consuming feeling that you don't always feel like you have time for. The thing where some people tend to angry-crush only on one gender is just some weird thing with how their attraction works (and for me personally is part of the reason why I consider myself bisexual rather than pansexual) it's just a thing that happens, and there is no value towards any gender in that.

I get that if you don't relate to angry-crushing, this would read as ""I don't want to be attracted to men"".. And that might be how it's intended too. I don't know, I didn't write it. But I can relate to it as  angry-crushing thing, and I think it's meant to be.

Don't mean this as trying to invalidate your feelings about this and similar posts. I just felt that it would be unfortunate if you felt hurt because of a misunderstanding that could maybe be clarified."

daddyissuesclub,few27ag,t3_ed15vv,1579404451.0,"When I was 18 and started college I hung out with a few 26-29 year olds and I thought ""hey, their just like me"" which was nice because I had a lot of anxiety about getting old and boring, haha. So it was nice to realise that you can be much older but  be on the same page about stuff. You can talk to a 30 year old and they don't feel older than you. Sure, when you were a kid, age mattered, it ment different interests and maturity. But when I was 18 and hung out with 27 year olds, I felt like I was past a threshold, age didn't really matter anymore. 

Now I'm 27, and I recently went back to college, and now I study and hang out with a bunch of 19-20 year olds. And I have a ton of fun with them, I like them, they are awesome. But also: they are kids. Fun kids. Awesome people. But kids. One time another older guy who is also in this friend group sometimes implied that I was checking out one of the 19 yo guys who had his shirt of because Halloween or something. That creeped me the fuck out. They are kids! Sure, they are fucking each other and that's fine. But just thinking about being involved with any of them myself.. I feel totally creepy..

I realise that this likely comes of as condescending. I really don't mean it like that. I'm sure that you are mature and that you and your long distance boyfriend have really meaningful and great talks. I had a guy who was like 30 who I met when I was 13 and we connected super well, I know what that is like. And it's not that there is anything wrong with connections like that just because of age difference. You learn a lot about yourself from talking to people generally. And people who have experienced more of life are interesting when you actually connect and they aren't just old and boring.

But. This is more reasonable as a sort of mentoring situation. Him telling you he loves you.. it makes me worried. And again, I'm not trying to be condescending or invalidating, but this will make sense to you when you are 30, likely way earlier. Do you know any 14 year olds? Think about how it would feel to hang out with them. That's way less of an age difference than 30 vs 18. But you'll notice it pretty strongly. Yet you felt quite mature at 14 probably and would have felt it wasn't weird to hang out with an 18 yo. Age differences are just more noticeable from the older perspective. And you just can't know how noticeable it is for a 30 year old when you are 18. That's not a jab at your maturity.

There will be other amazing guys. You don't have to worry about that. You should explore and meet all kinds of people and not settle down with the first one who says he loves you. If you really have a great connection you'll be able to stay in touch and meet up and be in each others lives until you feel like you can actually tell if you actually do love him or if you are just projecting an idea onto him that you love."
