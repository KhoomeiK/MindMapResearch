ElderScrolls,ff42ax1,t1_ff3iuac,1579553995.0,"It's not difficult, it just takes more time to find where you need to be. Which will have you exploring the world as part of the game as in learning the map. Exploring in games like Skyrim is just ""oh that looks pretty, let's go there"". As far as combat goes, level a certain combat skill and it will prove helpfull. Vanilla morrowind has a lot more durability than Vanilla Skyrim, I restarted Skyrim over a dozen times with different types of characters just because I wasn't overly invested in my character. I only restarted Morrowind twice and have about equal time spent in the game. I mean I love both (actually all, since Daggerfall) but the argument that Skyrim is dumbed down to Reach broader audiences is kinda right..."

todayilearned,fezmqiv,t1_fezlrfb,1579459090.0,"You might be right, Wikipedia seems to suggest two to three seconds due to loss of blood pressure.


 ""Decapitation is quickly fatal to humans and most animals. Unconsciousness occurs within 10 seconds without circulating oxygenated blood (brain ischemia). Cell death and irreversible brain damage occurs after 3–6 minutes with no oxygen, due to excitotoxicity. Some anecdotes suggest more extended persistence of human consciousness after decapitation,[16] but most doctors consider this unlikely and consider such accounts to be misapprehensions of reflexive twitching rather than deliberate movement, since deprivation of oxygen must cause nearly immediate coma and death (""[Consciousness is] probably lost within 2–3 seconds, due to a rapid fall of intracranial perfusion of blood."")."""

Which was why it was used for upper class executions, rather than hangings which were for the execution of the poor. So not much room for making shows. 

Also, the Nazi regime made more use of the guillotine than any other governmental body.

And last but unpleasantly least: a beheaded head is believed to still have eleven seconds of conciousness."
