No offense but you are the definition of why women don't date virgins,  not only do they generally suck in bed due to inexperience but they are known to be clingy. And even by virgin standards youre being exceptionally clingy. Latching on for dear life is usually a sign of someone who doesn't have much of their own life so they latch on to someone else's. 

You need to learn to curb your attachment,  first off youre not in live,  it's been less than three months this person is more idea than reality as you haven't known her long enough to actually know her. Second off jumping in to the ""i love you"" is just another thing that screams desparate. 

Why are you latching on so hard to anyone thatll have you? And breaking down after someone you've only really been with for a month breaks it off?

This whole thing screams if emotional instability,  I'm not trying to rip on you but sweet lord man youre a mess.  Get since therapy,  learn to date in a healthy manner and slow the fuck down.  Get your own damn life,  don't latch onto to others.

If youre not and these girls aren't romantically interested in you then your doing something wrong,  your either coming off in a way that turns them off ie needy,  clingy,  lacking confidence, etc or your just going for women that aren't a match for you ie lacking common interests,  or you don't know how to talk to women or read them nearly as well as you think.

love,fdh9j5e,t3_eldpti,1578418304.0,"It's hard for a guy to hold off on that,  specially with so many women that are so willing. 

Beyond the pleasure of the act itself it's the intimacy,  its the pair bonding,  its a physical expression of your feelings,  its so much more than just wanting to get laid.  It's wanting something more with your partner.

Now that's not to say just go out and lose your virginity,  any guy worth his salt who likes you will earn it. And ive been with plenty of women who have had difficulty having sex due to trauma,  vaginismus and other issues.  There are always ways to work with that or around it, however don't feel pressured to have sex.  With the right person you'll want to. 

Ive always believed that if you want something truly real that person should be capable of being your best friend,  would your best friend ditch you just because you wanted to wait or needed a little extra help? 

Sorry im ranting,  long story short you should be open to the idea of sex if youre going to date however it should happen in your time no matter how long that is"

At first i had nothing,  no pillow,  bed,  furniture,  tv, computer,  games,  literally just the carpet and my cell phone.  After about 2 months i saved enough for a tv and a ps4 that sat on the floor, man,  video games for as much as people shit on them that xcom 2 got me through the worst time in my life.

love,fdeb48o,t1_fdbz3wz,1578335157.0,"Op don't do this,  accept that you screwed up and grow from it. There is nearly never fault entirely on one side only,  don't try to validate it or excuse yourself from fault. When it gets hard is when you should be hard on yourself.  Work extra hard to be better,  physically,  emotionally,  spiritually,  never deny your fault or foolishness in things so that when there right one comes along again you won't repeat things.  

Allow yourself to hate what you did and grow from it, those who learn nothing from history are doomed to repeat it. Don't treat yourself like a victim who deserves better,  be better and you'll attract it."

politics,fcgpea6,t1_fcgd4y0,1577642675.0,"While that may be the case i just wish people had that same fervor aimed at those who deserve it more.  That was a petty thing for him to do specially given how rich he is. 

But Hillary literally rigged the democratic primaries to be the democratic candidate and then had the whistleblower killed that outed her,   people died in the bengazi scandal and she let it happen for her own gain,  she supported her pedophile husband that was a frequent flier to Epsteins island.

Most of the Democrats are equally corrupt in different ways,  some Republicans too. The media has people whipped into such a anti trump frenzy they lose all sense of perspective.  So yea, maybe he is a crook, but we have far far worse in the Senate and in Congress. We should be focusing on the top down,  so yea, put him in jail but not before hillaries been executed for murder,  bills in jail for participating in human trafficing and under sex and aoc and her cronies are in jail for accepting massive bribes by corporations.

I guess my point is maybe he is a crook, but there are far far worse your letting off the hook in your anti trump fervor.  If you want real justice,  bring the worst offenders down first and get to trump after their done.  

I can see your point so i hope you can see mine,  just reading so many other comments there are so many people blinded by hate and fervor that they don't see what's far worse right in front of them."
politics,fcg540d,t1_fcafjwd,1577636552.0,"What persistent illegal activity though? Because that sounds pretty vague at best and if it's anything like the impeachment then it's more or less bogus. Don't get me wrong,  I'm not saying hes squeaky clean,  he cheated on his wife with a pornstar and then bribed her to stay quiet.

Hes sleazy,  yes,  dishonest,  yes,  combative, yes, but a crook? I see that as a stretch,  at the very least hes far less of one than the vast majority of presidents we've had.  

I personally can't stand the left backing people like Hillary who have had people killed and married to a man who was friends with Epstein and went to his pedo island on a regular basis.  Or Aoc taking fake pictures crying beside a empty borderway pretending to be looking at a border internment camp spouting ideals while being in pocket of big businesses. 

Sure hes not squeaky clean,  but he's not Democrat levels of debased and morally bankrupt.  As i said before,  he's the far lesser of two evils"
politics,fcaejjp,t1_fca9o9x,1577567882.0,"There crook part, he's scummy and a liar for sure,  but the crook part is entirely based in heresy and flimsy arguments. There dens spent 3 years putting together a impeachment case and they only head one actual witness to anything supposedly illegal,  to which in his testimony he verified there was no quid pro quo. I hate trump sure but i do support a lot if what he's done and how he's changed things. 

The Democrats however i loathe,  they've wasted 3 years throwing a temper tantrum over a democratic loss and rather than do anything positive they trumped up this impeachment farce,  it's a egregious adviser of power in the level of treason.  I honestly think most should be imprisoned for treason at this point."
