ForeverAlone,fee71hr,t1_fee2tdd,1579027723.0,I looked for some older cat to adopt but couldn't find one that would be ok here. I'll pick up another cat in 20 years if I'm still here.
AskTruFemcels,fe3xcg4,t1_fe3n8nq,1578853715.0,I love her! She was in Mystery Men.
ForeverAlone,fe2x3c3,t3_ennm83,1578843805.0,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dODSHuvuoTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dODSHuvuoTM)

Can absolutely confirm. If you skip to 1:45 ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dODSHuvuoTM&t=1m45s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dODSHuvuoTM&t=1m45s) ) you can see my reaction. My stork is broken. The stork before me was drunk and cross-eyed."
ForeverAlone,fe20g58,t3_enich0,1578833140.0,"I think it would be a good thing but I don't think it would make me personally happy. A robot or simulation doesn't really care whether you love them. I want to be with someone who wants to be loved.

If they could actually fool me that they were real that might be different though. I'd totally date replicants or something like that. Though it seemed like those developed emotions of their own anyway so I'd consider them people."
AskTruFemcels,fe1jni0,t3_en6ptp,1578827362.0,"I think they can antagonize feelings of loneliness if you were already feeling lonely, if something happened recently or if the movie itself has ties to someone (it doesn't even have to be romantic then).  


Some movies are just too good not to watch though."
ForeverAlone,fe1g06w,t1_fe02trw,1578826083.0,">even if some chick thinks you shouldn't pursue a career as a ladies fashion influencer on insta or whatever anyway.

You can't spell fabulous fashionista without FA.

Well you can but then you get -bulous -shionista. Sounds like the name of my very great friend in Rome."
AskTruFemcels,fe1c19s,t3_emth7y,1578824825.0,"My initial reaction was that nobody would say this to their partner, or they would show other signs of being undesirable before this point. My initial reactions come because it seems to defy some social conventions or other.

Maybe they've phrased it horribly but it's kind of demeaning and sounds like they'd be unfaithful or only chose you for that reason specifically.

People make dreadful mistakes or say things they don't mean sometimes, or phrase them like shit. So if we were together for years, and this was the only time they slipped up, while I think it might be an unforgivable thing to say, it basically depends on our history together, and what they actually mean. If I flip that sentence around a few times, I've definitely heard much worse in relationships that didn't break up. So are they a good person otherwise? etc, the context matters.  


I've heard similar joke-y things before but they kind of hurt and stick around in the memory too. So my reaction could be based on sensitivity too.

If they show signs of being unfaithful or something after that though,  then I'm out. If they just meant I'm the best person they've been with and they actually directed that inwards, then I'd stick around."
ForeverAlone,fdyy7v4,t1_fdyrzsn,1578784731.0,"A lot of worse things have happened to me and others though. I always see a similar post that I can relate to and I'm like, damn why I didn't think to write about that or in that way, maybe someone would understand better. So the ""help or amuse someone"" is the right way to think about every entry really.

That's right though, I'm always trying to do things better than before anyway."
suicidology,fdy950u,t1_fdy7c2n,1578777305.0,"Alright. Well thanks for reply. I'm removing this since somebody important to me needs me (unrelated DMs from today), and that's enough for me to stick around."
AskTruFemcels,fdy1pjd,t1_fdv06ki,1578775090.0,"The first 5 decimal places of the Pythagoras Theorem are 3.147  


I like you. Feel free to correct me. Although Piers Morgan is the numpty that said the above, not me."
suicidology,fdxzbud,t1_fdxy5lm,1578774442.0,"Hmm, I automatically read this backwards. As least likely, etc.  


I do kinda think that just travelling somewhere I'm likely to die would be a great way in theory."
depression,fdxwumz,t1_fdxvm1i,1578773755.0,"Yep, lonely, low human contact. It's really difficult and I'm wired that way, but I put effort in for people I care about.  


I care about your cat. Good job there, I'll know you take care of him :)"
SuicideWatch,fdxv6wh,t1_fdxukh0,1578773252.0,"Thank you. I'm grateful for your parents too. Even here, I've been through having a litter of kittens die, or even young cats (<1 year) going missing. It's awful.  


With Timmy I do think it's much worse. Because I knew him for 6 years. He died young but I got to know him for so long, and I don't have anyone else. Thanks again."
SuicideWatch,fdx7v1r,t1_fdx6gje,1578766169.0,"Thank you. 

No, it probably wouldn't hate (typo: help) me. The only cope I have is keeping him around until we have to bury him, and desperately hoping that he wakes up because I don't have anyone else.

I think I have to worry about it. If people didn't hate me my life would be easier and I wouldn't feel bad. I feel like when I'm just trying to be friendly with people I must be doing something wrong."
SuicideWatch,fdwulv7,t3_emjyxh,1578762442.0,"Your post history is super-relatable, it's so many of the things I've felt but can't even say. I hope things get better for us after we die and that we find peace one way or the other.  


I delete most of my suicidal stuff because otherwise we're seen as not ""normal"". We can suffer, but talking about it is really taboo or too difficult for most people."
SuicideWatch,fdwk3b6,t3_en8tjw,1578759528.0,Why is my cat dead and not me? Why can't they be alive and me dead?
SuicideWatch,fdwelp0,t3_en2lly,1578757912.0,I agree with you I feel like everything would be better if I was just excluded permanently from the timeline.
SuicideWatch,fdwc1x6,t3_en2jde,1578757194.0,"I'm sorry for what happened to you. I'm going through similar feelings and I have done so in the past, when something bad happens and then it seems to stack up against you. I really wish I had some advice for you.  


It's absolutely possible for you to talk about this with someone, and it's not a burden it would be normal to seek help after something like this. I'm sorry for everything."
shortcels,fdvbe8n,t1_fdv9xsh,1578745621.0,"Damn ok I was wrong, I see how your viewpoint was legit now. Deus ex machina."

PhoenixPoint,fdqduvk,t1_fdqdph0,1578664070.0,"Oh I know that, but there are more enemies on Legendary. So I basically got swarmed at the end of turn 1 from a side-tunnel. People died (not like they can even miss with OGLs), and I haven't played since. Seemed unreasonable."
PhoenixPoint,fdpvjln,t3_ebvf4g,1578642247.0,"Do you still create mods for this game?

Is there are any chance for a mod that removes grenade launcher arthrons from the smallest alien bases? I literally haven't played PP since I got grenade spammed out of nowhere on Legendary."
Petloss,fdpcy95,t1_fdolqmt,1578625484.0,"I'm really sorry for that. That was horribly unfair to you, and completely wrong. Grieving is really difficult. I'm sorry your loved one passed so soon."
Petloss,fdoh8ng,t1_fdogxzj,1578605100.0,Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss. I do hope I see my cat again someday.
GenderCriticalGuys,fdob127,t3_eldrqh,1578601956.0,I think it's pretty accurate. It can be deadly accurate depending on someone's personal experiences. I think it's a fair thing to say. Men can be just as shitty to each other as they can to women. This statement could come from any gender.
Petloss,fdo4m5a,t1_fdo4aow,1578598809.0,Thank you.
no_sob_story,fdnmgl7,t1_fdnhzmh,1578588859.0,Your downvotes mean nothing to me I've seen what makes you cheer.
no_sob_story,fdnl654,t1_fdnis3o,1578588102.0,"""... post it on r/cats or r/aww ...""

Your comment is gone but READ THE RULES

**2.Title doesn't add any context to picture**

The original title doesn't add anything to the post that the picture didn't already convey.

The title was ""My cat just passed away"" - does that look like a dead cat to you? No, then it's adding context.

I didn't post a picture of a dead cat. He also died literally less than 24 hours ago. I can't imagine someone posting about their dead cat on r/aww either. Most are posted to /r/offmychest but I can't post there, next was the subreddit I posted in.

Regardless, whatever your intentions, as a consequence someone linked my username here which means I get a notification of someone else talking shit about my late pet."
no_sob_story,fdnjsur,t1_fdmuvme,1578587289.0,This submission breaks Rule 2. I posted this. My cat just passed away. That was the title. I didn't post a picture of a dead cat.
no_sob_story,fdnis3o,t3_elyvjb,1578586680.0,"Rule 2 and you're sickeningly heartless.  


Anything for karma huh?"
no_sob_story,fdnhzmh,t1_fdljt21,1578586206.0,Real cool of you tagging my username so that I also get a notification about this.
AskTruFemcels,fdmpx5o,t3_elyd91,1578559979.0,If she's into me? The story ends happily ever after. Otherwise heartbreak again but I can deal with that.

CasualUK,fdk5k8l,t3_eltzpe,1578496565.0,"I was in denial and carried him in a basket to the vets because I thought he was still breathing, his stomach rumbling etc. I had to wait a little while because no vet was available, I asked for one to come to confirm but I didn't have much hope because by the time the vet arrived I could feel his paws going cold and his body had lost some warmth, and he showed other signs of passing.  


I'm just a little sad now because he was my companion and family, was the sweetest cat that never hurt anyone and he went before his time at only 6 years but hopefully he's in a much better place now. I brought him back home so the other pets could grieve in their own way, and we're going to bury him in the back garden. Everyone says he looks very peaceful now."
justlegbeardthings,fdk3mek,t1_fdjzelg,1578495244.0,Oof.
