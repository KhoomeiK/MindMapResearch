The flu is usually much worse. A lot of people end up hospitalised when they get the flu."

I did get sick when I went to Vietnam for the first time though, which makes sense since it's unlikely I would have been exposed to the various bacteria there before then, and it's a very different environment to what my body is used to."

Android,ffh91dc,t1_ffh7x1z,1579926607.0,"Email also has size attachments. I can't email a video without compressing it to hell and back because the maximum email attachment size sits around 20MB. MMS is still not free for some people, even in New Zealand, and the point is to include as many people as possible. Since Bluetooth and WiFi Direct connections are available in almost every new-ish smartphone and don't require any internet access points or cell service whatsoever, it's far more accessible and ubiquitous."
