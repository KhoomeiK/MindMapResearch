teenagers,ffgz17w,t1_ffgymfn,1579918729.0,"you see I felt like I couldn't tell my parents because I thought that I'd be the one to blame, I was very insecure back then. Though I've had ex friends ""victim blame"" me for just being who I am."
teenagers,ffgybk8,t1_ffgwul7,1579918197.0,"fucked up thing: the teacher didn't believe me because ""he's such a good student!"" and ""No else else saw anything happen!"" the thing is, I went through almost a full school year of that fucking teacher never believing me. I hated going to my last *2* class periods because it was a double class on math. the teacher really fucked me over and decided to just ignore my complaints, I remember going to my schools shitty councilor and she's the one who changed the dudes schedule, I was lucky to have her there tbh."

pansexual,ff1zy70,t3_er23wn,1579490146.0,"\*insert triggered pan noises\*lol, lets break it down  
pan- root word meaning all  
ex- frying pan- can fry ""all""  
sexual- well no explanation needed here  
so pan means sexually attracted to all genders/genderless  
Bi- root word meaning two  
ex- bicycle- 2 wheels  
so bi means you're sexually attracted to male/female or male/nonbinary vice versa or gender/nongender or gender or just  
pansexuals- HUMANS?! YES.  
Bisexuals- These \*insert gendered or non gendered\* people?! yes.  
edit-   
ok so before someone says  
""bI lIKEs oNLy 2 BinARy gENdeRs""  
Ive met some who are attracted to females and nonbinarys etc"
