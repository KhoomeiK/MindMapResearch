SelfAwarewolves,ffdokl5,t3_et0yve,1579825292.0,"Her entire point is not, ""listen to me, I am an expert,"" it's, ""listen to experts, something is wrong."" I know Republicans are incapable of acting in good faith but come on."

It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple 'man walks into a bar' joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again."""

SelfAwarewolves,fcur9eo,t1_fcupcg7,1577986882.0,Because conservatives irrationally fear Muslims and have never and will never take any time to understand anything about them beyond the most cursory level.
