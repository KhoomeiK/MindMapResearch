CCW,ffh6zom,t1_ffgyfhq,1579924868.0,"It's much more what the jury may determine is reasonable. And as a person who was in that role, I can say that my first thought as to reasonableness was, what would a normal person do in that situation. If someone threatens you with murder, do you stick around and continue talking to them? However I also had to consider additional questions as to reasonable action. At the moment he pulled out his firearm, what was he thinking and was that reasonable? In my mind, it could be seen as reasonable that if a person who had been threatened that the person was going to go get a gun was turning towards the place where they could go get a gun, it's reasonable to see how someone could think thats what they were doing. It's also reasonable to think that someone might assume they were running because you pulled a gun on them."
CCW,ffh6ocv,t1_ffh5j3h,1579924608.0,"Because I don't like overly broad rules. I also want criminals caught and prosecuted.

On the overly broad issue. a blanket statement that you should never talk to LE without a lawyer makes no reasonable sense. If you are in your parking lot and see two people fight and a death results, should you call a lawyer before making a statement? I would say no. If police come to my door to ask about some crime I had nothing to do with, I will probably say so.

I recognize that police typically solve crimes because of people, often without legal representation, coming and providing information to them. And I recognize as well that many criminals do make statements to police that get them caught and rightfully taken off the street. If tomorrow no one ever spoke to LE without a lawyer present the solved crimes rate would, IMO drop immensely. And truthfully the number of crimes would increase as people know they can get away with it, for some time.

There are also some other situations where I really find it difficult to justify. If someone I know is murdered in California earlier today, and the police call or come see me. I feel fairly confident in saying I don't need a lawyer to make a statement saying ""I was in Florida at that time, either in the courthouse, at home for about 2 hours, and then back in a place with cameras, in florida."" I don't think I need a lawyer for that. 

Now if they are questioning me about something that happened years or decades ago and I may not reasonably be able to validate where I was, call a lawyer.

Now if someone says ""If you are innocent, and being questioned as to your role in a potential crime, do not speak to LE without a lawyer present"" I would have much less issue with that. I like this as it's a reasonable statement that someone can take as is."

That directly is counter to his belief that the planet could survive if the bees died.  So you need to back up the claim that the planet would not survive without bees, or provide some qualification or evidence. Not just that bees are vital to our ecosystem, but to the survival of the planet.

Now [this](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140502-what-if-bees-went-extinct) article starts by saying:

>It would mean a lot more than fewer stings and breakfast options.

Now that doesn't sound like the earth would not survive. Now based on the text below the video:

>We may lose all the plants that bees pollinate, all of the animals that eat those plants and so on up the food chain. Which means a world without bees could struggle to sustain the global human population of 7 billion. Our supermarkets would have half the amount of fruit and vegetables.

Again, while this would be a detriment to the HUMAN condition, and certainly have other impacts on animal life, it does not state that all life would cease, which was OP's point. Life would continue.

[here](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/science/this-is-what-will-happen-if-bees-go-extinct/ar-AAFtAVw) is an alternate source.

>If all the bees died, it wouldn't mean extinction for humans, but it would cause widespread hardship, and possibly famine. This is because a lot of the foods we regularly consume wouldn't be available anymore.

I know some people think kids will ignore what they are taught in class, I disagree. I remember many things I learned in school (half of it was lies or half truths anyway right?), and most importantly I remembered things that I believed could apply to me. Guns are a part of our society. Kids need to grow up understanding how to treat them before they ever get their hands on one.

I'd also like to see advertisements on TV encouraging adults who own firearms to get training, not just once, but continuously. And advertising reminding adults and kids to always treat a weapon as if it is loaded. Again, have someone that people know come on TV and talk about when they thought the gun was unloaded and had a ND. It will drive the issue home.

Same for identifying a target before firing. We've all heard a story or two about the son/daughter/bf breaking in and getting shot. Again, there are reasonable actions we can take to avoid these.

But I can say that there are a lot of gun owners who have never harmed anyone needlessly and probably never will. And there are good ways we can reduce those numbers without negatively affecting gun owners. I only hope that one day we start looking at some of those solutions.

>Ask someone that's never had to use a weapon, but is still safe, if their no-weapon kept them safe.

That's a hard question to answer, or prove. It can be proven that a weapon kept someone alive. It can also be proven that it caused someone's death, ultimately it is a personal choice, which i'm fine with. I do want people however to acknowledge that when you are in a defensive encounter, you don't make up the rules. You don't get to decide if it happens most of the time, you don't get to determine when or where, but without a weapon, or preferably with one, you have to be prepared to respond, the only person you can ultimately rely on is you."

Most cops who find out a citizen is legally armed don't care. They know you are likely not the person who's going to hurt them. Now of course there are outliers. But in general, no matter your race, in the US if you are legally armed and interacting with LE, it's not an issue."

[The Army Site](https://www.goarmy.com/ranger/join-the-army-rangers/requirements-to-join.html) has a list of requirements. It includes workout [plans](https://www.goarmy.com/ranger/join-the-army-rangers/army-ranger-workout.html). I'd also get familiar with using a map and compass. There are likely some YT videos giving you the basics. Don't get lost but you can probably find some public land where you can *safely* navigate using a compass and maps.

There's also a document on [this](https://www.75thrangerregiment.org/pre-rasp) site which has another workout plan.

Finally there is [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCatNYjvtrlV1JNnxwJEhfnQ) YT channel, I like his videos, go look for his tips on becoming stronger mentally, physically, and then finally his ones for Ranger."
