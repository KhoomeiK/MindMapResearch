insanepeoplefacebook,ffjg1od,t1_ffjamle,1579997484.0,"We have been told over and over that there are hordes of people grifting the system. Millions of welfare moms pumping out kids just to buy fancy clothes and steak dinners on the tax payer dime. Or people just refusing to work and would prefer to live off of unemployment. Teachers who have easy jobs and summers off doing the bare minimum for kids. Stuff like that. It’s been hammered into us that we shouldn’t support people who need it because there are people out there that will abuse the system... and the last thing any god fearing American wants is for poor people to ‘steal’ from tax payers. 

The data is out there that clearly reveals that early prevention with social services for addicts, homeless folk, mentally ill, supporting low income families, and delinquent youth pays off long term. It lowers crime as those young people grow up supported and believing they have a future. It helps people become functioning members of society as homeless, addicts, and mentally ill people get the support they need to help them work through their problems and live as productive of a life as they can.  The reverse is also true, Places that don’t support people who are at risk or need help see a spike in crime and unwanted pregnancy as those kids who grow up living with those individuals come out hopeless, less educated, and so they turn to what they can. If people think they can’t get ahead in normal society, they will work outside of it, or find ways to scam it.

There still exists the myth that if people work hard they can come out of poverty. The reality is you have to be very lucky, and find support/opportunities to find your way out. If you or your parent/s are sick, or if your school hasn’t had funding in a while and is full of teachers too burnt out to care anymore, or if you’re physically/sexually abused, or if you cant go to school because you or your family lives on the street.... what are the odds you’re gonna not only find opportunity to move forward, or that you’d even recognize or feel strong enough to take it if you do have it?

I’d rather pay higher taxes too vs have more than half my taxes support the military and basic utilities. When we have to vote on levies for the school I always vote yes even though I don’t have kids, because I want kids to have a chance to explore who they are and have access to shit. However people around me see taxes as taking their income, not paying towards services we all use, indirectly or directly. 

It’s a propaganda mindset we’ve been fed by republicans as long as I can remember."

politics,ffg12gd,t1_fffdcm5,1579896156.0,"There’s a line of thought that the government isn’t really who’s in charge, it’s the corporations. Sure governments handle the basic management of resources, military, and laws, but at the behest of corporate interests. You know, the ones who financially back candidates, petition with lobbyists, and have ex CEOs and/or people linked to corporate interests placed in high positions of government or put on as ‘advisors’.  Trump has been knocking down environmental regulations left and right, instilling conservative judges, and is planning to cut Medicare and other entitlement programs, and has boosted funding to the military. All that means corporate profits. It means the wealthy (and not just American wealthy) can buy up land and resources and exploit a workforce that is scrambling to make ends meet.

We assume that people are good, that people who choose public office care about the greater good.  I’d wager if you asked anyone who is elected to office if they cared about regular folks, including Trump they would say yes, and probably believe it. However there’s a disconnect centered around the ‘i got mine’ mentality. It’s about caring about themselves and people like them and using everyone else who in their minds, chose to live in poverty or deserve it. 

Or something like that. I like to remind myself that nobody ever sees themselves as the villain. All those people believe they are right in their decisions because it serves and benefits what they believe in. It’s why people follow Trump, they believe in his narrative, and think any information about him doing anything that could hurt them are lies. America has been primed for this, ever since standardized tests became a thing with our education system funding only successful schools and punishing (poor) schools, and teachers. People are growing up less informed, more likely to believe in snake oil like anti-vax or goop or that whoever is the republican president is now a Jesus figure (that is [nothing new](https://youtu.be/oWvIOPiKFrs) ). 

Ugh I’m ranting. But I guess basically what I’m saying is to understand is to accept there are people who have chosen to have no empathy for people not like them. People who aren’t in lower financial classes, and  people who aren’t the same religion or skin color although I’d say money is the main focus, everyone else is exploitable, expendable, only good for the money they spend and the labor they provide. It’s all about money, even what’s happening at the boarder is about money in the end. 

In the early 90s I met a guy who told me that the United States was in death throws, and in a few decades we would collapse due to corruption. I thought he was some conspiracy theorist hippy. The wall came down a few years before, Clinton was president (before impeachment), and everything seemed pretty hopeful. I look back, and i can see a lot of what we are dealing with now got started well before I got out of diapers. I’m now that old conspiracy theorist.

Physically you can’t ‘suck it up’. Hours of PIV every day for days on end just sounds painful to me. If the sex was mostly foreplay and didn’t revolve around sticking things into me the entire time I would be more cool with it... but goddamn if you’re not physically used to that of course it’ll hurt. The vaginal canal is a muscle just like your thighs (which also hurt) and being fucked is physically demanding (you’re literally taking it). This is not the only way to be intimate! 

Everyone has limits. If he’s putting his own pleasure above yours and is guilting your into sex that is a gigantic red flag. This is only the second time you have spent time together. He should want any sex you both have to be mutually pleasurable. Being sore and bleeding isn’t pleasure (unless you’re into that which you are not), and his response is to act like a selfish whiny asshole? You have a right to be mad about that.

AmItheAsshole,ff7wsoi,t1_ff71vug,1579660218.0,"We don’t know what the kid has been exposed to.

What we do know is this kid grew up on a narrative that he’s learned *at least* since he was 9 years old about his father and then later his stepmom. 19 yr olds are baby adults, meaning they may or may not have the life experiences or ability to have personal insight about themselves, their place in the world, and a perspective on how their behavior affects others. 

You’re saying that given what he could have learned that he should have developed some maturity and self awareness. Some people given who they are and how they grew up don’t learn this until later in life, if at all. You can find people in their 50s+ that are petty, rude, and will do everything they can to make whatever is happening to them someone else’s fault. Having self awareness, empathy, and personal insight is not a guarantee skill set for adults. 

Remember, this narrative that has been supported and positively reinforced is his by his own mom. Also he has had to face no strong consequences in his behavior, especially from his mother. In his mind she’s the good guy, and probably the wounded party in why his parents split up. He believes the story he tells himself, and his mom helps support and nurtures those feelings he has against his stepmom . That same narrative is what he will tell his friends and anyone close to him, and why should they question it? They don’t know her, or what is going on really. Only that he’s their friend and for that they will support him. 

OP is right to set a boundary, and OP husband needs to get that he needs to decide if it’s more important to support his wife who is done with the mistreatment  or his son who’s behavior is causing all of this.

Documentaries,ff491nz,t1_ff3c5n1,1579558190.0,"I agree with you. Thing is though every fat person has heard they are fat and need to lose weight.  Odds are you’re not delivering news they haven’t heard before, especially since nobody gets to be morbidly obese overnight.

When I’ve been told this news, it felt like hitting a wall because I know my lifestyle isn’t healthy, but it’s what I do to emotionally cope with stress both past and present, and it’s the patterns I am familiar with. Changing lifestyle habits is hard, especially with no support which is why many people fail.  The doctor may as well tell me to grow wings. 

I should preface that I’ve been told I needed to lose weight since I was a teenager. I’ve been put on a doctor monitored liquid diet at 16 which did help me lose weight but also made me miserable and didn’t teach me any new healthy habits. What I didn’t know then, but know now is my diet is largely the problem. This I’m sure seems obvious, but it’s very easy to over eat and misjudge portion controls as well as learning how much sugar is in *everything*.  I didn’t learn that from a doctor, if a doctor offered solutions like help me develop a plan with a nutritionist to help slowly adapt to my new lifestyle vs ‘here’s what is wrong with you go fix it’, it would have helped loads... but I’ve never gotten that kind of medical support. I’m sure it’s too expensive and not something most basic insurance would cover... but it would be nice.

Documentaries,ff47qzx,t1_ff2z5b4,1579557380.0,"It’s because we correlate beauty with self esteem and personal worth.  This isn’t something new at all, or specific to our society. All things value that which is ‘beautiful’, because it’s an indicator of health. Birds with the brightest crests and the best dance will mate. Mammals with a healthy look and can demonstrate strength or physical ability will mate. Humans are just like that.

It’s true that humans don’t have to be extremely thin to be desirable, you can look at western art history to find plenty of examples of thick ladies being objects of desire. For us being desirable means we are better able to attract people as lovers or friends, which we all want. To think of ourselves as undesirable can make many self abuse and self isolate. This is what the body positive movement is supposed to be about. Not encouraging people to be fat, but to encourage positive thinking and self worth so that these people can engage in the world again and be more active in life. 

I think it can for some become a echo chamber feedback loop because when you are that fat, losing it can seem impossible. If you’re locked into a pattern of eating/drinking and being sedentary and that’s the life you’ve known for decades... where do you even start? Nobody gets morbidly obese overnight. It’s process that takes years, and seems to kinda creep up on you. Every fat person on the planet is told they are fat, mocked for being fat, passed over and ignored because they are fat, and have this pressure to lose the weight quickly. Changing lifestyles is enormously difficult no matter who you are, especially when the habits you have may be linked to emotional eating or trauma like physical or sexual abuse. Then  expected to lose all the weight over a few months to a year with no setbacks and often no support? 

No morbidly obese person chooses to be that way,  but if a person thinks they can’t change, they have to find self worth where they can, hence why the body positive movement for many has become seemingly encouraging the “lifestyle”.  Think of it as insulation from having a large portion of society telling you that you and people like you are worthless pieces of shit and if you don’t change you should just kill yourself."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ff44j2k,t1_ff3j1cq,1579555371.0,">Whatever happened to the days when journalists actually investigated stuff? They're all just fucking mouthpieces at this point.


Because that’s exactly what they are now. Within the last 20/30 years big media companies have been buying up newspapers, radio stations, you name it. When I was a kid in the 80s and early 90s radio stations and newspapers were Independant owned. They didn’t answer to anyone and their integrity was synonymous with their value. 

Today nearly all news and radio media is controlled by [15 billionaires and their media companies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2016/06/01/these-15-billionaires-own-americas-news-media-companies/#f75323c660ad). I’ve seen the shift in my city from local news and radio being truly local to... well I live in Columbus Ohio. The local paper. The Columbus Dispatch was sold to Gannett Media Corp which is the largest publishers of print news, mostly in the US but also venturing into the UK [list of assets here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Gannett). They just merged in a hostile takeover with GateHouse Media late last year. Before the merger Gatehouse published 144 daily newspapers, 684 community publications, and over 569 local-market websites in 38 states. Their parent company is New Media Investment Group [and here’s a list of all their subsidiaries ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579684/000157968419000003/newm-20181230ex21.htm) 

The reason why journalists sound like mouthpieces is because for much of the time they are. A story gets approved from on high and it gets [passed down to local news and radio stations and print media to be reported on](https://youtu.be/QxtkvG1JnPk) . That video is from Sinclair media, but all these big media companies do this. Many of these media conglomerates are in bed with other large companies and politicians, so if a journalist wants to investigate something that may hurt a corporate interest, what are the odds that story gets squashed?  If say a politician wants to return to taxing the rich and supports unions which would fight for workers rights wants to be elected, what are the odds that the media company would kill stories about that guy and push the narrative for the politician they like. Big media conglomerates are more interested in profit than anything. 


Media companies started buying each other out in the 70s, but things really got moving when local papers had a hard time competing with online news because people weren’t buying print anymore starting in the late 90s. People were streaming music instead of listening to the radio which killed their ad revenue that supported them. For many local papers, news and tv stations the only options were to go bankrupt or sell out.  Today YouTube and podcasts kinda help with that gap but most are run by individuals with jobs that can’t do full time investigative journalism, and if they don’t stick to the info-tainment model they may not be seen hardly at all. Also it’s important to note a lot of news companies are [still dying ](https://www.thenation.com/article/facebook-media-die-off/)

Vantablack is not a pigment, it’s a coating that has to be applied using high heat. Even the spray on version has to be baked on. The company that invented this process is Surrey NanoSystems, and they keep a tight control on their IP. They don’t want the process of how they make this coating to get out and only see it’s uses as it relates to science. [If you check their website faq](https://www.surreynanosystems.com/about/faqs) they won’t give out samples to private individuals, only verified companies, education or scientific facilities that have gone through the process of providing proof of identity and credentials can get samples... just samples. If they are that tight on samples, imagine how crazy (and expensive) the process is to get anything coated. 

On their site they say that the coating has no artistic use.... which I disagree, but that attitude is one major reason why they don’t see a reason to market their product to artists. They don’t sell to individuals samples, let alone will coat anyone’s work for creative expression... except Anish Kapoor,n and why is that? Anish Kapoor is a UK based artist with a long standing international reputation and dude had to probably pay out the ass to get access to the spray version of Vantablack. In response to the controversy Kapoor said ""Why exclusive? Because it's a collaboration, because I am wanting to push them to a certain use for it. I've collaborated with people who make things out of stainless steel for years and that's exclusive.""

But Surrey NanoSystems ain’t the only game in town no more. Nanolab, a carbon nanotube manufacturer based out of Waltham Massachusetts, partnered with Boston artist Jason Chase to release a nanotube-based black paint called Singularity Black. This company is less restrictive and offers classes to students to show how the coating is made [you can find out more about them here ](https://www.nano-lab.com/optical-black-coatings.html). They make a low temp coating that you can activate with a heat gun or even a hair dryer that you can actually get a hold of, so go nuts you crazy cats

Stewart Semple does not (to me knowledge) have the equipment to create carbon nanotubes. The best guess is the pigment he uses is regular carbon and has been experimenting with different acrylic binders to create a matte effect. Carbon blacks as a pigment in general are matte though, and I personally found black 2.0 a letdown. There’s a reason why you don’t see a lot of professional artists running out in bulk to buy this paint. 

The way I personally see it is carbon nanotube coating as a process will in time become more accessible, and Surrey NanoSystems in the attempt to bogart the process by limiting access is an effective way of shooting themselves in the foot.  By limiting who has access, they are creating a high demand for competition."

S-VIS is not as black a other vantablack coatings due to how it’s applied to the surface. Like others have said this surface is much more likely to attract dust, and would be a bitch to clean because of it’s matte surface. A car with this coating used in the world would probably look like dirty shit real fast."
pics,feyj740,t1_fevym6s,1579446176.0,"Vantablack has to be baked on, it’s a very expensive process involving extremely high heat. It doesn’t exist as an acrylic paint because the carbon nanotubes have to be stacked vertically. Light instead of bouncing off like it does with most surfaces ends up ‘bouncing in’ (for a lack of a better word) so to our eyes it looks unusual. Vantablack in short is not a pigment, so it can’t ever be a paint. Strictly speaking it’s a coating. 

You can get carbon black though, when looking at artist grade paints the pigment code is PBk6 (all pigments have a code and quality artists paints have them listed). It’s one of the oldest paint pigments in the world and is easy to manufacture.

It’s impossible to have the ‘blackest black’ with acrylic as the binder because acrylic polymers that carry the pigment by nature can’t lay pigment in any particular way to further advance it’s matte qualities. No medium can do that. Not watercolor with gum arabic or oils  with their nut based oil/resin/wax combo. Paint simply don’t work like that yo.

I do have Semple’s black 2.0 btw. Bought it as a curiosity.  It’s just a matte black. He doesn’t list his pigments and I’ve dug around to find what the paint pigment is, but the nearest guess I’ve found is it’s probably just PBk6 like other carbon based blacks. It’s easily scratched so if one wanted it to be more durable they would have to put a varnish on it. You could just save money by using lamp black which is PBk6 by another name  and put a matte varnish on it. Also Semple’s paint always fucking has a cloying smell that relates to some sort of fruit. Black 2.0 is supposed to be blackberry if I remember right. Acrylic paint is not supposed to smell, and black 2.0 is the only “artist grade” acrylic paint that skunks me out of a room. I’d say the dude managed to create a very good gimmick to sell his paint, but dude did not invent anything that didn’t already exist. He just found a way to market the shit in a clever way

The idiot scrapey thing he’s doing is probably so they can see enough to pull over. Stopping in the middle of traffic is extremely dangerous and can cause a pileup. Smaller clumps of snow may only blind someone for a moment but that’s enough to cause an accident.  

Bonus round if the upper layer of snow turned into an ice sheet. Depending on how thick it is it could crack windshields or cause an accident as a sheet of ice cones flying at the driver.

AmItheAsshole,fep4jsz,t1_feo1fpo,1579311976.0,"I don’t think OP really knows what body dysmorphia really is or how serious it can be.  Lily is undiagnosed also, OP only ‘thinks’ her sister may have BD, but doesn’t know, and at 19 wouldn’t have a the knowledge or experience to know how to treat someone she suspects of having any mental illness... let alone her sister who has been teasing her for 10 years. 

Doesn’t really sound like Lily has had a serious enough wake up call to really understand how toxic her behavior is to herself and others. Stack on top of that her previous enabling now ex boyfriend who paid for these surgeries. Who wants to place bets that that was an emotionally abusive relationship (although who was abusing who.... could be either party IMO). 

I wouldn’t say that letting people not face the consequences of their actions helps them heal, especially if they don’t know they have a problem.  I’m sure OP could have been more tactful, but Lily needs a mirror to see herself as others see her, as mean and judgmental.  Lily is focusing so hard on her and other people’s outsides and refusing to look on the inside or value people for who they are... she doesn’t even see that as a problem;  Facing the truth is uncomfortable.... but nobody can heal or grow without being uncomfortable. 

Also, OP has been dealing with Lily’s verbal abuse for her entire teenage life. When someone repeatedly digs at you, it’s really hard to have a kind compassionate response, and OP isn’t’ the curator of her sister’s feelings.  What OP did was call Lily out on her shit, which she deserved to be called out on. Lily’s BF clearly didn’t know which means she wasn’t honest or forthcoming about her surgeries, which aren’t that big of a deal. Lily clearly is ashamed about it though, and she cant heal from that if she continues to lie and have her lies enabled. 


Yeah something is going on, a lot of pain, a lot of family history, and lots of feelings for everyone spread all around. Lily can’t get better if she doesn’t get presented with the consequences of being a judgmental asshole. OP needs to work on developing a spine, as well as learning how to pick and choose her battles. This isn’t a 1-1 asshole scale. Everyone has shit they need to work on and heal here, and they aren’t gonna get there until they hit bottom or get fed up with being on the bottom."
AmItheAsshole,fep2jsa,t1_fen7wnq,1579310703.0,"> what adult thinks it's OK to make fun of people like that?

An adult who is VERY insecure about their appearance. 

She likely grew up having body dysmorphic views about her body, so when she got the chance to get surgeries to ‘fix’ her, she jumped at it.  Thing is about having that condition is you’re never ‘fixed’. That’s why she’s had so many, thinking a little week here, and some bone shaving there, some implants and some laser treatments.. When she’s perfect she will stop, but she will never be perfect, so she will never want to stop. She has a psychological problem, not a physical one. 

In making fun of others, she’s trying to build herself up by putting other people down. This behavior may be. Ignored or not responded to when she’s younger but she’s a grown adult now. As her peers mature the uglier this behavior looks.  She will eventually either grow to understand that being attractive is about who you are and not as much about appearance as she thinks, or surround herself with superficial enablers."
Paganacht,feozn3d,t3_eq6w2t,1579308863.0,"Gods help those who help themselves. 

Saying this because it’s kinda a common thing that new folk try to do when coming to paganism. People are looking to -get- something. Knowledge, power, influence, whatever. Divinity that have a specialty niche in the arts say don’t (I have found) don’t inform, or ‘teach. They may help guide you but only if you’re paying attention to things like your gut/feelings.  They aren’t like parents or teachers, and if you want to petition their help you need to develop a relationship with them. Some divinity you may have a stronger affinity than others, and that divinity may not have the laundry list of traits you were thinking about... but they may be able to influence you in ways you needed to be influenced.  

There’s no patron deity of cartoonists because back when we wrote the myths of the gods cartooning as the art form you’re familiar with didn’t exist.  They ain’t like catholic saints (although some became saints to help recruit their cults). 

Also, when you’re talking Celtic, which one? There are many different cultures and mythologies within the Celtic umbrella. Celts are folks who are untied by language, not mythology or culture. Ceridwen is Welsh Celtic for example and her mythos ties in with Taliesin aka Merlin, Lugh is Irish, and he’s the big daddy fo Cú Chulainn who’s story also involves the Morrigan. Some Divinity may encompass more territory/cultures, although their names and roles within that culture may vary a bit. For example Bridgit is what you’d call my patron deity. People know her as a goddess of smithcraft, poetry, and healing, but she’s more complicated. Her worship once extended all over the British isles down into Northern Europe, and she has various aspects and names that can all be traced back too her. Bridgit as most know her is part of the Irish pantheon, and while she is nothing like Ceridwen she (IMO) would also be a goddess that can inspire. 

My advice, read the mythologies. Start [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/076519824X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_VwLiEbTAQKP10). Read about [this dude](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0815623534/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_ezLiEbXFDR9QR). Get into [this shit]( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1JTJNY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_IALiEbT1MD0GE) and more and more, 

There are no short cuts as a creative (trust me I wish there was). Get to know the mythologies, keep an open mind, and meditate on the gods and stories that speak to you. That’ll get you on the path you want.

Also fun footnote, all them myths and fairy tales will give you lots of fodder to make cartoons with.

Now you’re frustrated and complaining about it. That’s on you though. You set that up by lying to him. This is a difficult lesson fo,r many people to learn, that for a relationship to work you need to be honest and open to working through solutions *together*.  Hardly any couple comes together instantly great at pleasing one another despite what movies and TV shows tell us. If you don’t advocate for your needs and wants no one else will.

AskReddit,feiau1s,t1_fegqxyz,1579134179.0,"There’s a thing called a ‘death plan’ where you do all this in advance whether you think you’ll die or not. Have an envelope that contains all important things like birth certificate, proof of military service if you served, a list of all accounts and their numbers. Passwords, a list of property and vehicles (include VIN number), and anything else you can think of for whoever will handle your estate. You should also include any personal messages, and what you’d like done for your funeral and if/where you want to be buried.

It’s a PITA to be the one who has to find all this info after you pass to track down this info after you pass. It can take a while for the death certificate to come and you wont be able to access anything otherwise. This could mean bills going into default (because bills don’t know you’re dead) or problems access property or any number of issues.  With the funeral if you don’t have that written down, people will have to guess. When my dad passed he had his affairs partially in order because he was aware he would die eventually (he was 92), but there’s a lot he didn’t give us, like where/how he wanted to be buried, and trying to figure out his passwords for his internet accounts was a nightmare (didn’t help he forgot them himself in the last few months of his life).  We buried him alone in a cemetery with a service in the church we grew up in  practiced by a minister who he had never met. Weeks later when my brothers and I were going through his condo we found a paper hidden in financial documents that said he wanted to have the service in a specific funeral home with a Masonic service (he was a member for 60+ years) and buried next to his parents. We had no idea. He feared talking about death and on some level I don’t think he thought he would ever really die... he still had plans up until a week after he went into the hospital.

I have decided that death is always inconvenient. Even when you know it’s coming you’re never prepared emotionally, but you can have your shit mostly in order to make it easier for the family you leave behind.

Share the location of this info with 2 people you trust, or tell them how to find the location if you’re paranoid (put a letter in a safety deposit box and info to the bank with who has permission to open it).  Make sure to keep the info up to date.

People are going to form opinions about you no matter what. Nothing you can do to stop that, also it’s important to note you can’t please everyone. That’s hard because we all want to be liked by as many people as possible. Lots of people hide and lock parts of themselves away that they think others won’t like, or capitulate too much so that they will be liked... you get the idea. People will sell themselves out to be as non offensive and as pleasant as possible. You should ask yourself, is that any way to live? Constantly compromising all the time just to try to not be judged is a good way to lose your spirit. 


Will some people judge you and reject you if you play with gender expression in fashion? Maybe, probably. But you’ll also attract people who are like you, who are into the kind of person you are, who will see you as admirable or brave because you’re willing to express yourself and experiment. 

Being your authentic self is a brave choice, especially when parts of you may not fall into the realm of what certain societal circles define as “normal”. Some people may run away or be assholes about it, but those people are assholes. Some of those assholes may be reacting that way because they envy you and fear what is inside themselves, and some are just ignorant holes of ass. Either way, you don’t owe them anything and by them showing their ignorance or fear they are showing you that they don’t deserve your time. 

But there will be people who do ‘get it’, and who will want to know you for the person you are because your coding in your fashion would identify you as someone who is open minded.

Back to the quote at the top. It’s a waste of your time to fret about what other strangers think of you. Fashion is a way to indicate the kind of person we are. Of course you should be strategic about it, like if you want a certain kind of job you may have to restrict some choices, or if you live in an area where being queer is dangerous you should consider when it’s a good idea to take the risk.  But if you’re safe, and not trying to get a job where you have to present a certain way, I would highly encourage you to be your authentic self. 

This is your journey, you choose how to walk it. Your sense of style will both attract and repel, but that is gonna be true no matter what style of clothing you are wearing. Your sense of fashion and personal grooming is a way to help find your tribe, something to keep in mind.

If you’re unsure, start small. You don’t have to push the boundaries all at once.  Also if you’re still in school, just know it gets better after you graduate. 

Good luck

The Coca Cola bear (I think that’s what that was in the gif) represents a company, not a personality so much, and there are guidelines for how they behave, with some creative wiggle room, like the characters from Disney parks or sports mascots.

I am gonna guess for furries it’s not so much about the suit as it is becoming a character they invented. The suit just adds to the immersion so people see them as they imagine themselves.

Like during the overt rape scene from what I remember June falls a part for like... a moment, and then pulls her shit together so that she could survive this, hopefully with her baby.  

I also have seen the moments where June and Serena seem to connect as a bit... Stockholm-y. Not that June buys into what’s happening, but with all the people she’s known since leaving the handmaid camp she;s been around Fred and Serena the most. Serena for her part bought into what Gilead became but also misses the respect, freedom, and power she had when she was writing and doing public speeches for her cause. Serena keeps telling herself that she wants the life Gilead tells women they should have, but given how she took control when Fred was out of commission really illustrates how she misses work and misses the excitement of affecting real change. Wanting a baby has become an obsession with her I think because a child would be the only legit legal thing she could make a difference with. She’d probably end up being as controlling with a child as she is with the household and with June (running from being cool to a psychopath in a blink). 

Terrible people are never terrible all the time. This is how abusers find relationships, they can be wonderful and charming until it’s safe not to be. Serena is the same way. Also it’s important to recognize she is doing not only what she thinks is right, but is entitled to do. Everything with Serena is a means to an end, including how she abuses June. I think June in some way recognizes that and tries to use that to her advantage playing off what Serena wants to get what she wants when she can. 

Just about everyone in this show is morally grey, but I don’t think it;s good to think about the show in those simple terms. The Handmaids, Marthas, stolen children, and the other people who were forced into the system against their will are all in survival mode which can mean doing pretty fucked up shit in the moment. Survival mode means you can’t weigh your choices against morality, because to be moral society has to agree on what moral is. People who believe in Gilead  have a different set of values defined on class and gender structures in which following a different moral code could get you killed.  So anyway... I think given how the last season ended Serena and Fred are about to finally face some consequences for their actions. I don’t know if this will ‘redeem’ anybody, because much of what that couple did can’t be wiped away. But I’m all for either of them coming to terms with how shit they are and how much damage and pain they had a hand in creating. I don’t think feeling that would redeem them, not even if they manage to parley a deal and move on with their lives. I think the show runners get that the audience wants to see Fred and Serena suffer."

AmItheAsshole,fdz23uk,t3_en90gx,1578785860.0,"Pushing her away is a good way to cement those beliefs in her mind.  However how she is behaving can certainly be contingent on whether you continue to fund her tuition. Like if she’s bullying gay class folk or is actively taking part in hate racist rallies and such. 

You could say ‘I’m not going to tell you what to think, but I want you to be educated’ and require her to sit in on a few pflag meetings n such. You could let her know she has gay family in her history. I doubt your brother is the only one.... although I can get that can be tricky without concrete proof... and may not help cement in her mind what she’s actually doing. I’m not sure that telling her right now that her dad was gay would help, as she may see being gay as the thing that took her father away from her. In fact I wonder if she already knows somehow and this is why she’s behaving this way. 

This is really difficult, because I can see things both ways. You don’t want to fund someone who is actively campaigning to limit human rights. She may just be a young person wanting to find community and this is just where she landed. Maybe it’s a phase, maybe not though. The early 20s are a critical time as people begin to build their adult identities, and without an experience where someone she cares about affects/challenges her way of thinking she may not ever. 

Only way I can personally think fo to challenge this is for her to get to know GLBT folks, or for folks that she admires to come out so that the issue is humanizing for her. I grew up in a conservative homophobic and mildly racist household, and I was only really able to work on that because I met people who were smart, funny, and challenged my POV. College is a great place for this... depending on the college.  If she’s in a bubble of people who think like that, it will be hard for her to meet people who will have an impact on her that aren’t in that echo chamber. 

I guess I’m arguing to keep her in school, but to make school contingent on taking classes or engaging in activities that will force her to meet different types of people. Like maybe have her get a part time job as a waitress when she’s not in school, or whatever. Treat it like your running a scholarship of one, and if she wants to keep her school funded she needs to get out of her comfort zone. You cant tell her what to think or believe, but you can make your money contingent on her expanding her experiences and not promoting hate."
AmItheAsshole,fdpey1w,t1_fdpbqq0,1578626882.0,"I was thinking the same thing.OP hates her dad and would warn anyone away from him if she could.

Does he deserve it? I don’t know, we only have one side of the story here, and not a lot of it. OP’s dad may be the monster she says he is. Or maybe he’s just a flawed damaged person who behaves the way he does because that’s all he knows. People should have boundaries with toxic people, I’m not saying OP should let him into her life, but I would suggest working through her feelings, preferably with an unbiased third party, for her own sake. 

I also don’t think OP ‘made’ the fiancée run. We don’t know what kind of fight the fiancée and OP’s dad had (I would assume the fiancée asked the dad to explain himself before hitting the nuke button) that’s probably what made her leave. However OP did kind of stick her nose in. Even though she was asked, she seems pretty happy about destroying this relationship. Maybe it was the right thing...

TwoXChromosomes,fdohii6,t1_fdnvxsa,1578605258.0,"There are moments like that where the most important thing is to get to safety. She felt physically threatened by him, and he didn’t care about causing a scene so she did what she thought in the moment would appease him.  She didn’t want him to escalate or continue to follow her and harass her more, so giving him what he wanted in the moment felt like the safest option. 

You can’t make sense or rationalize with crazy. Bonus being physically weaker and smaller means physical options are not an option. She couldn’t defend herself against him if he got physical and she knew it. Giving out her phone number is like a lizard detaching a tail to escape from prey. It’s not ideal but it’ll get her to safety while he thinks he has a prize. 

It’s important to trust your instincts in these situations. Most guys can be shut down with a no, and a refusal to argue about it (you don’t need to give a reason). But some people know how to get under people’s skins or are used to getting their way by pushing through like this guy did. When people ignore you and your body language, and you get that feeling in your gut that you’re not safe, it’s better to listen to that gut and get out as safely as possible.  


Later on, I think explaining the reality of the situation from a safe distance was a good thing. Everyone is the hero in their own story and people don’t always understand when they are being inappropriate or how they may appear to others. Dude may not listen, or maybe he will have a think about how he approaches women.  Either way, she said what she felt she needed to say, nothing wrong with that."

My response to repeated ‘why nots’ and ‘why won’t you give me a chance’ is  ‘because I said no’, ‘because I’m not interested’. I don’t care if it makes me sound like a broken record, responding in any other way can be seen by them as flirting. I know it feels uncomfortable, especially the first time, but it gets easier.   

You don’t have to give a reason, or argue at all. If it goes that way you can say ‘I’m not arguing about this. I said no’.  Calling out what is happening usually diffuses the situation, no dude wants to look like an idiot by begging a girl who is just repeating the word ‘no” at them.

TwoXChromosomes,fdod68l,t1_fdnqvpc,1578602991.0,"There’s a book I like to recommend to young people that I wish I read when I was in my 20 called [The Gift of Fear](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Fear-Survival-Signals-Violence/dp/0440226198). It’s about how to protect yourself in all kinds of scary and  violent situations, as well as recognizing abusers before you get caught up with them.

Short term advice is make sure everyone knows if they don’t all know already. Don’t be ashamed, this isn’t your fault. Document everything he tries to do, dates, times, all that. Write down what you remember too, and everything else you know about him. You may need this info later. Be sure you or someone who has your back have made it clear you want him to leave you alone. That may sound obvious, but there are lots of people who will turn any answer other than an absolute **no** into a maybe, despite how obvious the signals are to everyone else. Set all social media to private, and be sure that it is. Self google search yourself and make sure none of your info is easily found. 

If you want to carry a weapon, carry only weapons that can’t be used against you or that you can wield confidently. You don’t want to run the risk of being jumped and disarmed and have that weapon turned on you. If this is happening at work, make sure your bosses are aware and always leave with another coworker when it’s late at night. Remember to check the back seat when you get into your car. 

Taking a self defense course can help you regain your confidence, same with taking practical measures for your safety. It helps to develop a ‘death stare’, which is when you think murder fuck-you thoughts and let it play on your face. When walking alone this helps, I’ve had people come up to me to talk shit and then think better of it (I can glare like a motherfucker). I have had two stalkers, one was an ex who wouldn’t leave me alone for a couple years, and I got him to finally stop when I reamed him publicly after I just got fed up with constantly politely turning him away. The other I ignored until he eventually gave up.  

Here’s what my old ass would want to tell 19 year old me. Never give them an in. Never tell someone they have a chance ‘just to be nice’ when they don’t. Don’t say ‘maybe later’ or ‘not right now’ or any other gentle brush offs, because that can be taken as a ‘maybe’ and some dudes don’t stop with that. You don’t owe anyone an explanation for saying no to them, but we all know how some people want to negotiate. Key there is honestly just repeating yourself in various ways. With being hit on at work you can shut that down by simply saying you don’t get involved with customers. You can smile and laugh while you’re saying it, but you’re still saying no.  Btw when I was younger I also had [one of these keychains](https://thekittykeychain.com) which helped me feel safer. They aren’t legal everywhere (Texas has laws against knuckle weapons) and you can’t fly with them because they are banned by the TSA now. I liked it because it was kinda cute and it couldn’t be knocked out of my hand easily. I never needed to use it thankfully but it helped me feel better. 

This can take practice, because we ladies grow up feeling like we need to please and not offend (generally speaking). However the earlier you practice strong boundaries like this the easier it gets. Believe it or not role playing with your friends can help. 

Last thing, always trust your instincts. If you get a gut feeling that telling someone outright ‘no’ could get you hurt or killed, then say whatever will get you out of there. Your instincts are your best line of defense. Listen to them always."
