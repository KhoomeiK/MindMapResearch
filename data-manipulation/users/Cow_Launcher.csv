Oh, and you're NTA, though you might want to take some time reflecting on who you choose as friends in future. As dozens of others have said, these fuckers are just using you."

cats,fclqkrr,t1_fckzyaw,1577754059.0,"First off, Odin is a little sweetheart! Secondly, here's an expansion on the whole M thing:

**Egyptian:** ""Mau"" is the onomatopoeic Egyptian word for the noise a cat makes. It's also a homophone for the word for ""light"", and since cats’ eyes appear so luminous at night, they are associated with the moon, and their marking is said to reflect that relationship. This totally ignores the fact that the M glyph didn't exist in Egyptian language. 

**Christian:** Christ was in his manger and cold. And a female tabby who saw this decided to hop in and warm him up. Mary 'rewarded' the cat by marking it with her initial. The problem? Once again - Aramaic did have a /mem/ sound, but it looked nothing like a Roman M. In fact no language extant at the time had a letter that looked that way. 

**Islam:** Mohammad refused to dislodge his cat (Muezza) who was sleeping on his sleeve. This was in part in gratitude for the cat killing a venomous snake that had been threatening him. Again, a lovely story... but the Arabic alphabet **did not have an M glyph**.

All of those stories are false back-stories. The reason a tabby has an M marking on its head is because tabbies have M markings on their heads. It's genetic."

LOL No. You pay a 60 pence-per-litre ""fuel duty"" (about $2.80 per Imperial gallon) over the price of the fuel, and then you pay 20% tax on the total.

Or to put it another way, you pay a tax on a tax."

Something to do with the fact that the gene which controls pigment also controls development of the inner ear?
