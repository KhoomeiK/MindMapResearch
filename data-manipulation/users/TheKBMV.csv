The only thing Respawn confirmed somewhere (sadly I can't source it) is that respawning and pilot regen does have an in-lore explanation and they are just not telling us.

On the other hand, we know that precision phase-teleport tech exists (Titanfall 2's titan phase embark and the evac dropship's entry animation as well as the phase rewind boost) and we notably don't see bodies after killing legends, only their stuff. 

So what if legends are tracked while in the arena and upon entering critical condition are phased to high class medical teams standing by?"
titanfall,ffmn9tl,t1_ffmej5t,1580056858.0,"Makes you think about licensing, really. It's possible that the P20xx line of pistols is \*designed\* by the Hammond corporate group but they sold the production rights to Lastimosa Armoury. I mean, why else would you name one of your handguns after the founder of the IMC/Hammond Inc.?

Also, most weapons on the Frontier are made by them but a lot of them don't share characteristic design elements pointing to a different designer behind them (in-lore, I mean). 

Another option is that LA is another giga-corp like the IMC that monopolized weapon manufacture."
FallenOrder,ffm8fj8,t1_fflzicz,1580050264.0,"Yes, time. But in software development ""takes time"" =/= ""difficult"". Obviously planning the mode itself and the implementation, modelling/texturing needed extra assets and then writing/testing/debugging the framework code all takes time, not to mention level building and all that. 

But with the already existing assets (enemy models/textures/AI, combat gameplay elements, code base etc) if the game itself is well made an arena mode shouldn't be difficult to do. If it's a different mode, accessible only from the main menu you can probably also cut down on integration tests because the mode wouldn't influence the story mode. There is a very good reason modularity is usually stressed during development. One lesson they keep repeating in classes is that if adding features to your program is difficult because you have to rewrite a lot of code, you're doing it wrong. 

Now of course Fallen Order is a few magnitudes larger in scope than any project I've ever worked on so far and I obviously don't know their internal coding standards or the game's architecture, so all I wrote here is just based on what I know and what I was taught."
FallenOrder,fflpkxr,t3_etwcs7,1580042524.0,"Hmm... Standalone arena where you choose a map, a list of enemies to spawn in waves and you get to use your current save's progression. I like the idea!"
FallenOrder,fflpc41,t1_ffk37es,1580042377.0,"Well, if it's a well designed, well structured and well implemented software, it should be. At least, that's what I've been taught in the relevant class. Alas, reality often disagrees."
FallenOrder,fflnqq3,t3_etx7rw,1580041862.0,"I'm of a mixed opinion on this whole thing.

For one, representation matters to a lot of people, and I wholeheartedly agree that everybody needs characters they can see themselves in. That's the point of stories really. And if somebody needs their skin color or sexuality to match to be able to identify with a character then that's a valid need, end of story. 

However, I don't think that the way to go about that is to constantly complain about other stories because all that will achieve is alienating creators/other audiences. And be honest, forced representation, for the sake of ticking off a chekcbox (a frequent result of constant complaints in my experience), that's not going to move things forward constructively now is it?

A third point about it all is that as progressive a world we live in, cultural inertia is a beast, it will take a long time for things to become commonplace and undebated and we're still in an early phase of such transitions.

So yeah, this is a complex and important issue but it's also a live minefield so maybe we should approach it with cooler heads."
FallenOrder,ffljq1m,t1_ffl70we,1580040407.0,"While the animated Clone Wars series doesn't really show it, you could count the movie clone troopers into the representation list as well. Temuera Morrison is of Maori descent."
FallenOrder,fflixrb,t1_ffjrq3i,1580040213.0,"To be fair, I'd be surprised if she wasn't bi, seeing how the Dathomir witches lived in sisterhoods and segregated from boys and men most of the time (if my SW lore is correct here). I'm not an expert on what such circumstances mean in the development of attractions though, so I might be way off here."
FallenOrder,fflhxmq,t1_ffju8l3,1580039920.0,"I think what Cal represents goes deeper than skin/sex/etc. He tells the story of a traumatized young boy dealing with self-doubt and blaming himself about something he had absolutely no control over. You could probably put a mild case of PTSD (is that a thing that exists, mild PTSD?) on that list as well, but I'm really not qualified enough to make an assessment like that.

And then he finds new friends, most likely a family in the long run and healthy, encouraging relationships that puts him on the road to dealing with his issues and accepting, moving forward.

EDIT: Sorry, I managed to leave out my main point: I don't think Cal is bland at all."
