Tizen,fdkq4jk,t3_eis69z,1578508821.0,"I had a moto 360 and then eventually the fossil gen 5 which I returned for the Galaxy active 2.

In my opinion the Tizen OS is much more refined and just works better. The fossil watch didn't have native sleep tracking, so you needed to download a 3rd party app called sleep as android, which sucks. 

I found wear os a little slow and choppy feeling and the fact that I had to download 3rd party apps that seemed to cause pretty bad battery drain just to do basic things was a turn off for me.

The Galaxy active 2 is much smoother and responsive and battery life is about 4 days vs the Fossil gen 5 at 1-2 days. It has native sleep tracking screen is very vibrant and crisp looking and slightly bigger than the gen 5 which is quite noticeable. 


I haven't found anything so far that I can't do on the Tizen OS vs wear os. Although I do prefer the lol of the gen 5 slightly over the active.

Hope that helps"
