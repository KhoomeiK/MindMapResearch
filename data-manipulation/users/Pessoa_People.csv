askdoctors,fey77g7,t3_eqa8tn,1579441660.0,"How hot is your shower water?

I also get this and I'm 90 percent sure it's because I like my shower to start out warm and finish in the depths of hell"
AskDocs,fey18ff,t1_fexya17,1579439453.0,"The doctor already made a pap smear, but the results won't come for 2 to 3 months, so meanwhile we're trying to figure it out through other means. Thank you for the reply!"

AskReddit,fedw0wf,t1_fedjqf6,1579021080.0,"Oh, I misread your situation. I'm sorry you haven't had anyone willing to overlook this. May I ask how old you are? (or age range you date)

I wonder if it's something people might grow out of, because it seems very inconsequential for your partner, as any wanted penetration could be achieved with help of a strap-on or something. You'd be getting the short hand of the stick, no pun intended, not them."
AskReddit,fedj17t,t1_fedikci,1579012773.0,"I think a heads up would be favorable to you and your partner. Just tell them, without any awkwardness or self-deprecation, that sometimes your penis gets too excited and finishes before you even start.

It's very unlikely that premature ejaculation will be a deal breaker for anyone. Your attitude towards it is what matters. If you're willing to keep going, make it about your partner's pleasure until you're ready to go again, then you'll be okay!"

trippinthroughtime,fe0x7j8,t1_fdyxbbo,1578819719.0,"Generally, neither is being fat.

Being fat is as much a choice as someone who got lung cancer from smoking"
trippinthroughtime,fdxpkl4,t1_fdwt7rw,1578771580.0,"So, I hear you say that being fat is seen as unhealthy, and therefore ugly, right? By that standard, people with cancer aren't attractive, disabled people aren't attractive, mentally ill people aren't attractive.

What you should be saying is they're not attractive *to you*. Because I sure as hell can find anyone attractive, given they're the right kind of person to tickle my fancy"

BikiniBottomTwitter,fcz82mi,t1_fcz7mmz,1578095561.0,"Most men wouldn't survive basic army training. And every single meme I've seen today in this subreddit is about ""healthy mid 20s male"" scared shirtless of being drafted. But yeah, women are weak haha"
BikiniBottomTwitter,fcz7na0,t1_fcz2r09,1578095317.0,That is totally true and it sucks that trans people aren't seen as fit to protect their country (or whatever the reason for going to fight in a war is). Doesn't make the lil joke right.
BikiniBottomTwitter,fcz7gy3,t1_fcyz7ax,1578095216.0,"It usually isn't... Doesn't change the fact that it's an overused joke and makes trans people seem like they're trans for ""a purpose"" (like the very famous ""I wanna get into the ladies' bathroom, oop I'm trans now)"
BikiniBottomTwitter,fcz7alb,t1_fcyw8c9,1578095116.0,"I know, right? Like, transphobia is so boring, and so are the people who make jokes about it!"

bujo,fcjwg0o,t3_ehipum,1577708024.0,"I recommend that you watch the videos and read the explanation on the basics of BuJo on the official website. The original method is simple and efficient, without any of the aesthetic components in the journals we see on social media.

You can learn a lot from there and you can adapt it to your needs. I still go there a lot when I'm feeling overwhelmed or just need a kick back to the traditional ways.

Ninja edit: there's also an official book. I'm halfway through and it's helped me a bunch!"

It's so great I've filled 40 pages in 2 months (as opposed to 10 the rest of the year up until November)"
bujo,fchqquk,t1_fc57cjf,1577653162.0,"Ohhh, you could write how far along you got at the end of the day /when you stop doing the thing. For example:

Dec 29
. Thing one
- Thing two (___ of 350)


Dec 30
. Other thing 
- Thing two (___ of 350)


That way you know how far along you are. Maybe get a new signifier, so it isn't a task that you'll cross off, but something you record progress on.

Hope it's not too confusing!"
BasicBulletJournals,fcbah0h,t1_fc7vh5p,1577584474.0,"Same, I had to give up the idea of my bujo being pretty or perfect. I just focus on productivity and get, if I ever feel like adding a doodle or some colour, then fine. But I don't have to

I've even stopped correcting my spelling mistakes (I'm dyslexic) on my dailies, because it was making me skip rapid logging. I'm gonna be the only one to look at my notes, so I'm the one who needs to be able to read them!"
