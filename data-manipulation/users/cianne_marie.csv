I'll be unpopular and say this: your girlfriend and her mother are being ridiculous and childish. NOT because they want you there, but because they can't understand why you would feel conflicted over this and would immediately guilt trip you for faltering. Then again for passive-aggressively telling you to essentially go away because you don't love them enough. Sorry, I know they're grieving and emotional and also probably shell-shocked, but that doesn't give grown adults licence to act like toddlers, or at least not to check themselves after they act as such. 

In an ideal setting where everyone is being understanding, I'd hope you could be with your gf up until the time you have to leave, dip out to the wedding to see your buddy get married and do your duty, and then come home and be with her in the aftermath of the funeral. I agree with orhers that after it's over may be an even rougher time, not that she probably realizes that yet, and while it's not ideal for her to not have you with her at the funeral, she'll probably be more focused on her mom and other family members, and be able to cope without you. I think you could best serve both of your people this way. But it's clear that that's not acceptable to her. 

I think that you should let your buddy know what's going on, but wait to see if you hear from the gf in the next 12-24 hours. If she contacts you with an apology, and wants you to be at the funeral, then I believe you've already agreed to go and should tell your guy you won't be there. But if there's no contact, or if it's hostile angry contact like ""are you coming or not?"", then I wouldn't go. If you show up without being told it's okay, there could be drama - which will definitely not get you anywhere. If she's not able to be an adult and say some variation of, ""I'm sorry I wasn't able to be reasonable in the moment and I would like you to be there"", then go be there for your buddy and re-evaluate your relationship afterwards. I'm *not* saying dump her over an emotional outburst that was wrong but somewhat understandable, but figure out if it says something about her ability to communicate and cope under stress, or about her as a person. 

Good luck. I don't envy you."

I mean, assuming Edward had a son and the son grew up to be an adult and blah blah blah."
Siamesecats,fdsf7cz,t1_fdrp2ri,1578701359.0,"My meezer is pretty closely chained to me. If he falls asleep and I leave the room, that's okay (he'll just holler for me when he wakes up), but he can only go to sleep in the first place if we're in the same room. Sometimes he's on me, sometimes he's not, but no walls in between. NO WALLS, HUMAN!"

toronto,fdpjeg6,t1_fdp8f10,1578630238.0,"I stopped for groceries one night last winter, during the few days (?) when it was ridiculously, old-school-Canada freezing cold. There was a lab tied to the bike rack. I scowled and ranted in my head about assholes who have to walk their dog to the grocery store in minus twenty weather to pick up milk because ""dogs don't mind the cold"", blah blah blah, and hurried inside.

Came back out a good thirty minutes later loaded down with bags and this poor dog is still tied up alone, now tap-dancing on his cold feet. I know I checked the temperature, I want to say it was like -16 or -18 ish. It was wretched, whatever it was. I went back inside and went to the customer service desk and asked them to page the owner, because otherwise I was going to call police (not that they'd have likely done anything, but I was steamed). The girl at the desk was horrified and immediately paged overhead, and we waited for about ten minutes with no one showing up. She was pretty young and wasn't sure what to do. I set off back outside to see if the dog would get in my car or, failing that, come stand inside the lobby between the doors. In the meantime, the owner had apparently skulked outside, untied their poor freezing dog and dragged it back home."

I completely diasgree that making a valid, perhaps uncomfortable-to-hear point to her father was disrespectful. Furthermore, I really hope stepmom *did* hear it, because she sounds like an ass."
