AskReddit,fdsjaav,t3_emuqkb,1578703831.0,"A shopping app that populates your shopping list based on the meals you input.  For example, say you know what you like to eat every night of the week, if you put in black bean salad it populates the list of ingredients you actually need to shop for based on the meal.  Repeat for each meal.  You like Turkey Ham Sandwiches? It'll fill the list with the ingredients while asking you about synergy inputs.  Like sandwiches? Don't forget a spread.  Like pastas? Here's 8 different sauces to pair with.  Salads? Here's 5 dressings to try.  The idea is simplifying your shopping to the meals themselves. 

The real sales pitch though? Sell ""suggested"" brands options to companies who want their product featured as an option."

And I loved it, it combined my nerdy love of the classroom with the interesting discipline and self awareness and physical fitness of a sport.  It was social because your training partners/sparring partners could be your best critiques and in many ways, your dojo is your team/second family.  I cannot encourage people looking for a way to socialize, get fit and fall in love with everything that is martial arts.  

Brazilian jujitsu will teach you to think critically about body movements and mobility in ways you may have never thought about through traditional wrestling methods.

Sparring within a few weeks.

You were dealing with compulsory educative sports where egos and emotions rule in sports, where developing minds and inhabit emotional bodies.

Fitness classes/Sports, most people could do with more health and wellness in their life, but going to a class changes the game entirely, not only will you probably learn to work out properly/better, but you may meet people doing it too.  I recommend martial arts because 1. It can be fun in the right setting with the right people, shop your dojos.  2. It can be a fun alternative to getting fit and also learning a skill.  3. It is a contact/partner sport so it forces you to interact and engage with others in a social setting.  Bonus: If you take up something like jiujitsu it's like getting your hug quota in for personal growth.

Various clubs/programs and volunteering,  I have a friend who runs a local communtity hackerspace that opens up to the public for fun projects. Volunteering is a great way to meet other people who might share similar passions about what you are volunteering for.  Volunteering to take care of people, animals and various community projects can be great methods to meet others.
