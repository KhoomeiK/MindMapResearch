BreakUps,ffg3mao,t3_etfxka,1579897732.0,"Agreed. I hardcore BINGE watched all the youtubers you mentioned and would stay in bed, panicking and watching all these videos instead of getting out my house moving on. I would religiously follow all the advice and get frustrated without results, and obsess over the No Contact rule and count each day that passed. It only prolonged my moving on process because those videos gave me a lot of false hope and wasted my time. Also, for video calls with coaches and workbooks you have to pay! Just for something that probably wont work because theres no steps you can follow to get an ex back. Everyone has a unique situation and story. Accept it and let it go."

Makeup,ffesdb4,t3_et6kgd,1579863222.0,"I have black hair pale skin and I find light makeup looks really nice. Orange eyeshadow, mascara, bit of bronzer and pale lips! Pale pink lipstick looks so nice to contrast the black hair. A different kind of look that looks amazing is the pinup look like Dita Von Teese. Eyeliner and red lipstick looks beautiful with black hair!"
BreakUps,ffeg119,t3_et4vhp,1579846589.0,"For me, exes have always come back everytime. One of them  came back after 5 months, one of them after 3 months, one after a day. But that doesnt matter. 9/10 when they reach out again the intentions arent pure. They may try to hurt your feelings by showing you how they've moved on and be petty like that, or on the flip side they'll beg for you back but you shouldn't listen to that because they'll be not good for you anymore. You broke up after all. I know it's hard but it doesnt matter if an ex comes back.  It means nothing."
