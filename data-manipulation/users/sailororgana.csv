skinsTV,ff48wcu,t1_ff46j3c,1579558098.0,"Just my take on it, but for me it was mostly because there was no ""Effy"" character. And I don't mean someone who acts like Effy, but rather someone from the previous gen who was younger than the others and went on to sort of lead the next gen. Effy wasn't heavily featured in gen 1, but she was there, she was featured in a couple episodes and we got attached to her. Seeing her development from gen 1 to gen 2 was, while a bit heartbreaking, still very satisfying. Same with Pandora to a lesser degree since she was also introduced in gen 1. 

But gen 3 kinda lacks that previous attachment. There's no carry-over character from the previous generation that you always wanted to see more of. Granted I haven't watched past the first episode so I don't know if there's any cameos or anything but for me that was the thing that stopped me from getting into it. It was hard to get attached to a whole new group of characters without any connection to the characters I loved. 

That said ever since joining this sub I've seen a lot of love for gen 3 and I've been considering watching it next time I do a rewatch. Here's hoping I can get into this time. Sorry this is such a long response lol, I never know if my point is getting across so I might have over explained it"

She'll be able to work during part of the pregnancy and I'm sure she'll be happily welcomed back afterwards, especially since it's a job from her dad and not just any boss. I don't think it'll be a tragedy, it really seems like everything is coming together right now."

It doesn't mean you're required to wear anything you don't want to. It's about *not* conforming to society's made up rules. No one's trying to make you dress in a way you don't want, that other person likely said that because your post makes it seem like you do wanna wear those but feel like you can't because of your gender.

I mean, even if they haven't actually watched the movies, they probably already know, right? It's not like it's a well kept secret that only SW fans know lol. Unless we're talking about young children who don't have internet access or friends that have seen it, they most likely know stuff like that already.

And if they really are completely in the dark about it wouldn't it be just as shocking to see Anakin's story without already knowing what's gonna happen? Not really trying to argue that either way is better, just saying that both ways of watching for the first time will have it's own benefits"
