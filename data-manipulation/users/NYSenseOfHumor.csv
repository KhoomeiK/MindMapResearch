The trial process can take a year or more. There is still no trial date set for the Pittsburgh shooter, but he has been charged."

You may want to work on basic socialization with the dogs. Another important skill is leash walking. I suggest buying a few harnesses in different sizes to really focus on this skill. A lot of adopters don’t realize how many dogs don’t have this and a good foundation in leash walking will set the dog up for long-term success."
reactivedogs,ffvwvj0,t3_evi8c4,1580275736.0,"First step is to keep him safe. 

Have you looked into [extra heavy duty zip ties](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07944FZ8Y/)? They are tested to a break strength of 250 lbs, so securing across every place where two sides meet with one at the top and bottom of each wire intersection may be enough to keep him from bending the crate. If you haven’t tried these, I suggest trying this first. 

If it’s in your budget, I also suggest 16 [climbing carabiners like these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BT7DMCX) in addition to the extra heavy duty zip ties. The twist lock can’t come undone just through friction and the dog hitting the crate (a regular screw locking carabiner can be unlocked this way). The reason for 18 (if I counted correctly) is that on each of the four corers you put one about 1/3 from the bottom and one about 1/3 from the top, plus four on the door about 1/3 from every edge.

If none of that works, the next option may be a [heavy duty crate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BXDJNTN/), they come in all the standard sizes so you can find the one right for your dog. Due to the price of these crates, it may be worth trying carabiners first, 8 carabiners are $80, and if it doesn’t work you can just return them.

Companies like Ruffland [make stronger, non-wire crates](https://rufflandkennels.com) but those get very expensive quickly.

You also need to work on keeping the dog calm. Talk to your vet about medication, but also try a [Snuggle Puppy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000C9YHFS/). Some people also have success with  using both an Adaptil [collar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HPVH6O) and [diffuser](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AW71ILU/)."

The only thing in this whole situation I like less is the government anointing the GP is the gatekeeper to you seeing any doctor you want."

Anti-Zionism is antisemitism.

Before anyone reacts too quickly, there is legitimate criticism of the Israeli government’s policies, but that’s not “anti-Zionism.” 

Anti-Zionism is saying Israel should not exist and then uses various conspiracy theories and lies to justify the position."
