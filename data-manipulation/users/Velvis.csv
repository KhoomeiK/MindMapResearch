They knew he was in the area because it was surrounded. They ordered everyone inside and they methodically searched the area knocking on doors trying to find the POS for like 24 hours. Yeah it looks like a warzone because those shitheads killed innocent people with a pressure cooker bomb filled with nails and shit. An 8 year old kid among them. They then killed a campus security guard for no apparent reason and hijacked a guy in his car telling them they were going to times square to set off another bomb. The person who they hijacked made a break for it at a gas station and told the police what they were driving and what their plan was. They chased the car into a small neighborhood and the two fuxkheads opened fire and either had tried to set off another bomb or had more bomb making materials in the car. One of the POS ran his brother over and killed him then managed to escape. This photo is the following day trying to locate him. The next time there is a 20 minute shootout by terrorists in your suburban neighborhood let me know if the military/police presence is unwelcomed.
