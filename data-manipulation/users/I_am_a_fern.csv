I always have, and always will buy my kites used. You can get gear from last season that has been flown less than 10 times for half the price. Is it a little damaged, has it been repaired ? Even better, lower than price even more. It's not like it's going to change its behavior in any way.

Kiteboarding,feml9ge,t1_femid8e,1579261123.0,"A local business on my home spot that rents and repairs kite gear also designs their own kites. They use the same software, manufacturer and high quality materials as everyone else. They're pretty damn good kites that sell dirt cheap : 840€ for a brand new 9m.  

But you'll never see one anywhere else but this spot.  
The lack of promoting and the extremely low price make them appear as cheap off brands, whereas they're actuelly much better than some well known brand. I bought a ""used"" 2 year old 7m that flew twice for 200 bucks, with bar and lines. Best kite I own.  

Pricing can be a very deceiving thing. Cheap doesn't mean bad, expensive doesn't mean good, yet in the eyes of customers it needs to be above a certain price or they'll get suspicious. That's why companies have to adapt their prices to the market.

On a personal note, I don't give a single shit about how famous is a brand. I'm only interested in the product, especially in this sport where 99% of the market is branding and communication. Think about that : famousness doesn't fall from trees, it costs money, and that's money that doesn't go into the product.

As a result, obesity is going down (from 18%), but more importantly, constant communication made it universally viewed as a medical condition that needs treatment, rather than a genetic or choice thing.
