Sometimes a tach is nice so you can check what gear you’re in without pulling your hand off the wheel and for other ancillary functions, but it’s not critical to the operation of a vehicle in the same way that the speedometer, temperature gauge, and fuel gauge are."

worldnews,fe09556,t1_fdztw3t,1578806529.0,"The computer thought the plane was actually pointing way higher and so lowered the zero point of the control stick. Since the sensor was broken, it didn’t know when to stop lowering the zero point and eventually the pilots pulled the stick all the way back and the computer was so far negative they couldn’t input enough control to keep the nose up."
worldnews,fe08rg3,t1_fdzsf5o,1578806190.0,"The bigger engines made the plane more prone to stalling, so Boeing implemented a system that would see if the plane was pointing too high compared to the air flow. The only thing MCAS controlled was the elevator trim, basically where the nose would point if you let go of the control stick. The idea being that if a stall was imminent, the plane would make it so that it wasn’t pointing so high. 

The problem was the system only read from one of the two angle of attack sensors, and so when the sensor failed, the plane started nosing down and kept nosing down. Because it was controlled by the computer, it overrode the pilots trying to electrically reset the trim, and the pilots pulling back on the stick made it so the manual hand wheel would’ve been very stiff. Of course, all of this was happening while the computer was saying everything was fine. 

It really is a shitshow"
worldnews,fe089uc,t1_fdzqqzy,1578805755.0,"It wasn’t a stick shaker, the system (called MCAS) would automatically change the trim of the elevators if the angle of attack got too high. In other words, if the computer thought the plane was pointing too far up relative to the air it was moving through, it would essentially change the zero point of the control stick to bring the plane’s nose down (pilot says “give me 10 degrees elevator”, computer says “okay, I’m changing 0 to -2, you get 8 degrees”). 

Thing is, this system only read from one sensor despite there being two on the aircraft for redundancy. So if a sensor failed, the plane would be flying level, the computer would think it’s pointing up, and quietly adjust where  zero actually was for control surface position. Then when the plane noses down, the pilots pull back, the computer thinks it’s pointing even higher up, drives the nose down more and the plane lawn darts itself. 

Because the computer overrode the trim settings, it ignored the electrical trim commands, meaning the only way to override it was to use the manual crank wheel which can take a lot of force if there’s a bunch of air pressing on it because the pilot is trying to not die. So, from the moment the sensor failed and the plane started going down, the pilots would’ve had to skip straight to the manual trim wheel while not making any stick adjustments so they could still crank the wheel."

movies,fcj4g16,t1_fcizqk8,1577677029.0,"I agree with the bulk of your thoughts. Here are some things I’ve thought of in response to some of your points:

The fleet is a continuation of the Empire’s massive hardon for blowing up planets. They started with a moon sized space station that could blow up a planet, then when that blew up they made a space station that could fire faster and blow up planets or ships, then when that blew up they made a planet that could blow up a bunch of other planets at once, then when that blew up they finally decided to stop putting all their eggs in one basket. I think they’d be better off if they stopped trying to blow up planets, but hey, I guess they know their strengths. 

[Force Healing](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Force_healing/Legends) has been a thing for quite a long time now. 

It wasn’t lightning in space, the fleet was still in the atmosphere. Also he was the greatest dark side force user in literally millennia, dude’s got a lot of juice for those lightning bolts. 

Ray literally fought her dark side self, doesn’t get much more struggly than that.
