curlyhair,fenbe89,t1_fena296,1579281067.0,"I get some crunch with the B-Leave-In, but got a bit more with the Ultra Defining Light. I didn't like the latter, though. I feel like it was sticky and made my hair greasy and stringy, hence the switch up. 

I definitely liked my results with gel when squeezing water out first, that's when I get a better crunch for sure. Maybe try that before plopping and see if you get a different result? I feel like 90% of CGM is trial and error haha."
curlyhair,fenaxcf,t1_fenachz,1579280776.0,"I added the Volume Foam to my cart, too. I feel like my biggest struggle is volume, especially after the first couple hours/day 1, so thanks for the recs!"
curlyhair,fen9ve2,t1_fen819e,1579280121.0,"Not OP, but I do something a bit similar. I scrunch in the Cantu after the shower when my hair is wet, then I scrunch with a tshirt to remove extra water, then I scrunch in Deva B-Leave-in Gel, then plop in a tshirt turbie. I feel like it's the only way I could get gel to work the way I wanted. 

I also used to use the SMCH Milk, but I like the Cantu better. Sometimes I use Deva Wave Maker with a pea-sized amount of Deva Deep Sea Repair, but I think the Cantu is the better buy."

curlyhair,fen7rvn,t1_feml9ug,1579278832.0,I found a turbie twist made out of tshirt cotton instead of microfiber to reduce frizz and I love it. [$6 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M3S4OAQ)

wood,fekaxyk,t1_feak5pw,1579196254.0,"Thanks for the tips - I have some spray lacquer left over from another project, I'll see what the label says in regards to water and wood. I've had a normal mat in there for years, but I wanted to elevate the room with a bit of a re-design. I ended up getting a bamboo one off Amazon that wasn't expensive, so I'll see how long it lasts. My friend in the same climate says hers has held up well, so we shall see!"
