Just realised that my entire warehouse is full of Chinese imports. Fuck. Me. When get orders every other day."
PublicFreakout,ffjdxn6,t1_ffjdr5n,1579996237.0,"On UK tv it said it had 1k capacity. Perhaps I misheard. This is more realistic, but still not enough is it. It's the incubation period that scares me. It's just exploding."
PublicFreakout,ffjczpd,t1_ffjcux3,1579995687.0,"I remember the SARS outbreak but for some reason, this one is scaring me."
PublicFreakout,ffjc6vj,t1_ffjbizb,1579995225.0,"I know. I would put a few zeros on the total, 1k+ infected out of the population of China is NOTHING. And yet they are racing to build a hospital, from scratch, in a week especially for this virus and closing down cities? It's very odd."
PublicFreakout,ffjb69s,t3_etpveg,1579994623.0,I genuinely think that this is worse than what we think and it's being very downplayed. Building a hospital in a WEEK for this virus? Hmm.
