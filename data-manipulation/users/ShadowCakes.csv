Jealous,fgp3tsl,t3_ezo8cm,1580996106.0,"The best policy is always communication. I have a serious jealousy issue, and I am in the same sutuation. My boyfriend has played online games all his life and he talks to a lot of people on line. Everytime i see a new girl pop up in his messages it eats me up unside. Think its important to mention that weve been together six years now and this still gets to me. It’s a long and hard stuggle, but nothing can get better if you keep it bittled up. Ive always aknoledged that my feelings were out of proportion and very much infounded but also I can not simply turn those feelings off. My boyfriend tries very hard to understand and to make me feel as comfortable ad possible. If i see a message of someone new I will try to ask him who this person is without accusing him of anything. He is aleays open to talking about it wich to me, is key for me in a partner. 

Good luck with this, it’s like anything else in life, if you have the right tools, you can overcome these feelings. But don’t beat yourself up for it. Its counter productiv. Just try and do better every time."
