It's a non-fiction memoir so it doesn't get the same attention as his other works for that reason I think.  It's also focused on an almost-forgotten event, the Spanish Civil War.  Finally, in contrast to his contemporary Hemingway, Orwell makes it clear that not only is war not romantic, but also that it's bloody as all hell.  And that war was coming.  I'm not sure of any other book from that time period that more adamantly raised the red flag against fascism, including Nazism, than Homage to Catalonia.

Nazi beliefs are not good, period. There is no wiggle room, no gray area. Nazis are not ""doing their part for what they believe is good"" because none of their beliefs are good. These scumbags aren't some quaint community with a quirky belief. They're not wearing wooden shoes. They want to subjugate other citizens of other races, to the point of elimination.

Second, all parent transactions. 

Third, how to do it. I do a few ways. 

1. Email. If there's a significant transaction, I'll shoot an email to guidance. Any parent interaction gets cc'd to guidance. Careful how you write, however. Keep it professional. Emails are discoverable documents. Follow-up with guidance in person. 
2. Skyward or grading program. Skyward has a section where you can make notes on a kid's profile. Sometimes, I do that. 
3. MS Word. If something feels off, and I'm not comfortable putting it an official channel, I'll type up the interaction in word, and start talking to an AP about whatever the problem is and get their input.
