fatlogic,fghgcrr,t1_fggx1mu,1580784202.0,"thanks for explaining this. I never knew what to make of it and always pronounced it in my head as ""latin ex.""

European lanuages where the whole sentence follows the gender are gonna be a tough nut to crack, for sure."

RagenChastain,fdfrxap,t1_fd6ef3b,1578368713.0,"Those are the ones where the depression really shines through. It's very sad. I know a guy who uses comedy to deal with his mental health, but in a way that's not helpful. He makes a joke out of everything, or tries to, to avoid serious discussions, and it's only to his own detriment. A lot of comedians seem to be like this."

That really made me LOL, love it! This is my term for when I just did an intense weightlifting session and I can barely lift my arms enough to wash my hair. Feels great though :D"
RagenChastain,fdfqwp8,t1_fddmjjg,1578368028.0,"And own the HAES Trademark so they probably make money off of it. They have a captive audience, so there's money to be made!"
RagenChastain,fdfqp0j,t1_fddmnh0,1578367890.0,"I would think that creating a new pronoun would be more easily accepted, that way people aren't having to shift their definition of an existing pronoun. Especially in languages that are super gendered (any European ones). It might not be the most desired thing, but I'm thinking strictly from the acceptance standpoint. I totally get why people are torn on which way to go with it tbh."
fatlogic,fdfp8rf,t1_fdebzqt,1578366931.0,"Since the participants signed gag orders, I expect that Jillian's and Bob's were much more extensive. She can say little negative about TBL or face legal action. I think her leaving the show was the biggest message she could have sent without getting sued, especially since she was probably making good money on it."
fatlogic,fc3ddco,t1_fc2u9a1,1577387309.0,"Same here, slight hypoglycemia and I eat at maintenance so I don't have excess available all the time. Sometimes a small sugar intake can make me functional again. But these days the low carb fans like to accuse people with different diets of sugar addiction to affirm that they picked the right diet."
