NintendoSwitch,ffdzpp8,t1_ffdcrns,1579832968.0,"You can't really ""screw up"" anything in Stardew Valley. Play at your own pace. You don't have to do everything as soon as possible. That makes the game, or any game really, a chore. There's a lot to do and you don't have to min-max stuff just to enjoy it. Just do what you want each in-game day and you'll enjoy it as much as how people here enjoyed it.

StardewValley,ff8owzk,t1_ff8o9vl,1579689574.0,Of course. The valley has secrets. We are all here to uncover them.

EnterTheGungeon,ff5b0km,t3_erq9hv,1579585740.0,"There's a mimic in a secret room by the shop a few floors above and it made me lose the shopkeeper so I've been thriving on broken chest armors (which are very very rare) and this is what the blacksmith's stock on the forge looks like. **This.** I brought all of the other useless items she got so I have more money before the SS.

Salt to the wound: Also, this is a rainbow run and one of the floors gave me the option of all the three items be 2 HEART CONTAINERS and a HEART SYNTHESIZER. Yeah, screw you too gungeon."

OnePiece,ff24v39,t1_fezxqw1,1579493864.0,"I can see him doing that, but also it's connected to Luffy's greatest dream. And with how much he's grown since the start of the series, I really hope he doesn't have this reaction when that time comes."

EnterTheGungeon,feskgjt,t1_fereu34,1579366176.0,I got a naturally spawning one as well. Only used them in Rainbow Runs and took the time to pick one item. [Imagine my face when I realised I can pick em all up.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PertinentDisfiguredChipmunk-small.gif)
EnterTheGungeon,fesjsm9,t1_feqxryd,1579365942.0,"Well, here's a tip: you don't reload it. You reload it when it's safe until maybe 6 times, then only shoot using long press and not tap to avoid accidentally reloading it. If mag's empty, use a secondary gun for a passive reload!

EDIT: DISCLAIMER: Passive reload still gives penalty. I have no idea about it."
