Showerthoughts,ff7ijy9,t1_ff6yik9,1579650373.0,"What's yours guys points? When I was 20 I moved away and ran a restaurant fully, 60/70 hours a week for a year until I took over two other stores, I guarantee I worked as hard as a CEO and would cry from the back pain and paperwork/computer work. Still only made ~30k a year after taxes. Still ended up in debt after a couple years. Never had credit, no loans from parents , didn't know how important straight A's were, my school was insanely competitive in 07. 4.1 athletes barely got scholarships... And not to anywhere special. Even if I got accepted to harvelard or Princeton I would never afford the cost of living in those areas, still rack up huge debts and have nothing and nowhere to go when I graduated. It's not about hard work it's about not being taken advantage of, being very street smart, and having good opportunities like gates, bezos or any of these guys. But 2020 compared to 2000 or earlier is a whole new ballgame, the wealth gap increase since 2000 has fucked everything. I could have saved every penny and never had enough to open my own stores after 20 years....because by then, it's gonna be even more expensive to find a decent location or franchise or whatever..."
