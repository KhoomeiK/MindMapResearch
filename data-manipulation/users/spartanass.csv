>The aspect of insta that is all about showcasing your best life and comparing yourself to others negatively impacted me

Yesss, this exactly! This was exactly what i wanted to convey , my wording isn't exactly good per se, but I feel like deleting those apps just make it easier for me reinstall them and getting back on easily. :^)"
CasualConversation,fcj96g0,t1_fcj8kvc,1577680390.0, Im thinking about what I'd do in the time that's spent around on Instagram if I've deleted it I casually use Instagram for about an 1½ hours daily ( im a coffee student and I only get around 5 hours of free time after reaching home before I doze off)! So you can see it's taking up a majority of my time
