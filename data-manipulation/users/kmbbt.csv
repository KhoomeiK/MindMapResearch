Weddingsunder10k,ffh85zy,t3_etlkp8,1579925855.0,"disclaimer: my situation is completely different than what most weddings have. 


we weren’t planning on hiring a coordinator but found one for a decent price and HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPIER. when we had our meeting for before the wedding (when we still thought the wedding was happening in sept) she brought up things i wouldn’t have thought of on my own. 

our wedding got cancelled/rescheduled due to a hurricane and she not only contacted every vendor to reschedule but she made a chart showing which vendors could work which days so we could pick the rescheduled date that gave us the least amount of work to reschedule certain vendors. i was beyond thankful i didn’t have to contact all these people when all i wanted to do was curl up into a ball and cry. 


like i said, i doubt anyone’s wedding compares to the crap we’re dealing with. but it really was a load off our chest to know we don’t have to talk to 10 different vendors while setting up and dealing with this late person or whatever. i recommend it and i haven’t even had my wedding yet."

weddingplanning,fd24xsw,t1_fd245nv,1578141747.0,i’d only take her feelings into account with the caterer then. maybe bring her along and let her pick out an appetizer? or if you’re deciding between two meals i’d give her the option of which she think would be best. if she feels actively involved in one part of the wedding she might lay off in other aspects. giving a food budget doesn’t mean she gets to decide how you dress. my MIL put money towards our beverage tab so i asked her about her favorite types of wine to make sure she felt ‘part of the process’ and i feel it helped a bit.

i have no idea how your mom is involved financially but it did seem to get her off our case  a few times. maybe gently remind her that it’s *your* day, not hers."
