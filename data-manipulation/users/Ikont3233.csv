I hope US never gets to be as bad as them. Spoken like a true ignorant mate. While Americans are overworked and try to find comfort in buying material things, as seen by the fact that 69% of Americans have less than $1000 in savings and live paycheck by paycheck, other nations have a different view on life. There are currently 26 countries with a more powerful middle class than US has but they don't have the same consumerist mindset to go and trow the last penny on a brand new car and get into debts for things they can't afford. In Germany for example I've meet many people who could easily afford a new car, but they were still driving their 15 year old one, using old furniture and such because why change it if it's working? Also most people there also have quite substantial savings and would rather save the money for things that matter in life. Look at the pension and savings stats in many European countries, they are more than triple the US numbers. I suggest you go live there for a while, you'll realize people use their cash more for what matters in life, not blind consumerism."

They would also come with a book that you had to read if you were to get anywhere. With the rise in popularity they moved towards a simplified Action-Adventure style, RPG on rails to carter to the masses. They became easier, introduced all kind of hud elements, simplified quests, compass directions and quest markers which kind displeased the RPG fan base. They became easier to appeal to a larger audience, and then there are idiots like you who after the introduction of all those aids ( quest logs, compass direction, quest marker, uncovered map etc.) still can't figure it out and complains about it being to difficult pushing the industry to create even more idiot proof games."
