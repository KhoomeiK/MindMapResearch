preemies,fdj3pwa,t3_elejvc,1578457628.0,"My 27weeker stayed in the Nicu for 2 months. I had a nanny for about 6 months after he came home and then we transferred to daycare. We did choose a daycare with stricter sickness guidelines but he would still catch colds pretty often. We did the synagis shot throughout rsv season and flu shot and have been extremely luckily that he has yet to catch either (2.5years now).  Now that he’s been in daycare for about 2 years he’s rarely sick and when he does catch a cold it’s pretty mild. Both daycare and having a nanny do have positive and negative aspects so I think go with what you feel more comfortable at this time. Either way you chose, you can always switch if it’s not working out for you all."
