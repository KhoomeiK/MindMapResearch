AskWomen,feo3hf0,t3_eq15b9,1579294614.0,"I’m going to preface this by saying: 

1. I was in a dead end job and wanted to get a different one.

2. I moved to a new country, Germany, that I had visited multiple times before and knew I wanted to live there since I was 17. I moved over when I was 25. I’m 33 now.

3. I was friends with my now husband since I was 17.

My husband and I stayed friends for many years and eventually became more than friends. We wanted to give our relationship a real shot, so that meant one of us had to change countries. He was very willing to move to the US, but unlike me, he wasn’t in a going nowhere job. 

So it made more financial sense for me to move to Germany. I also have a career field (university lecturer) that is able to function across different countries/continents.

So, I leaped. It has its constant pros and cons. Living away from your friends, family, culture, and language can be tough. But it can also be very exciting. 

I have no regrets. I’ve been married for 6.5 years and have a 2.5 year old son. However, my happy ending is far from typical. Most relationships don’t make it. 

So my advice is that if this move also fits something you want for your life more than just “the guy I’m into lives there”, then consider going for it.

Good luck!"

I definitely speak the language, not perfectly, but the only thing Iâ€™d have trouble with is if a high level of German was required (like if I had to write an academic essay). If Iâ€™m ever anywhere with my husband, people will never address me, only him, even though I understand everything and had made no grammatical or pronunciation errors. 

This includes things like doctor appointments. It drives me insane. I feel invisible. 

Or, they will just try to switch into English with me, even though, again, I did not say a single word in English."

KindVoice,fdlqesn,t3_elv5fg,1578530016.0,"Other advice given has been good. But is there any way you can get yourself to do even a tiny bit of exercise? A 10 minute walk, 10 minutes of stretching, a little gentle flow yoga? Nothing that is too strenuous, for too long. Just a little bit to help you get some feel good brain juices flowing? 

When I lost my dad at 17 (32 now) my world crumbled. So I understand a little bit of how you feel. 

Also, try to eat just a little better. Start really small. Trade in one soft drink for some water. Or one dessert item for a piece of fruit. You donâ€™t need to go full Keto to start feeling different, health wise. 

Look into a free meditation app too. This can help with sleep, stress management, anxiety attacks, etc. 

The point is, go slow. And these are all things you can do alone if being around people is too much to handle. 

Other than that, split your day into hours if you need to. Sometimes surviving the whole day feels impossible. So survive for the next 10 minutes, then 10 after that, and 10 after that. Before you know it, an hour will go by. Then two. Then three. 

PM me if you need or want to talk."

I rarely see an untrained dog over here. However, when I fly back, I rarely see a consistently well-trained dog in my home area."
