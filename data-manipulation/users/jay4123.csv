depression,ffzkub8,t1_ffzkow4,1580384021.0,I o ow you aren't interested in medication. But from personal experience it gave me some time to think logically. Consider medication. Make the time to think deeply about what is really important. When you realise that you have a life where you can literally do anything if you put your mind to it. You'll be unstoppable. You are the captain. No one else will help you. You have to help you

Understand that building on yourself is the only reason you'll be able to live a full life is vital. Then keep doing it"
depression,ffzk785,t3_ew3nru,1580383191.0,The most important thing tpnubderstand is you need to love your life for you. No one else. If you think for a second that happiness comes.frik pleasing others you're kidding yourself. DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. BE WHO YOU WANT TO BE

depression,fe6fifb,t3_enz24l,1578889347.0,I suggest discussing your depression with a doctor and start on anti depressants as soon as possible. Just 4 months ago I was feeling your exact emotions and now I haven't had a single suicidal thought in months.

australia,fe17jdx,t1_fe1708x,1578823454.0,Just because a male feels like a woman doesn't make it true. All these people are doing is grooming children into believing it is true. Which I believe is horrible especially when they aren't fully developed
australia,fe13kqj,t1_fe12etz,1578822155.0,Would you like doctors to allow schizophrenics to believe what they're hearing is real? Let's see what happens. Let's accept their hallucinations and enjoy the ramifications
australia,fe11x31,t1_fe106o3,1578821557.0,I don't have a problem with people who believe they are what they aren't. That just comes under mental disorders which I'm aware some people can't help
australia,fe1042m,t1_fe0yl2i,1578820913.0,No I'm just saying children need to know there are most commonly only two sexes
australia,fe0yx12,t1_fe0yenz,1578820523.0,While I'm not homophobic I do believe that children should be taught that fact that men are men and women are women. Seeing a man dressed as a woman can be confusing to a child. In saying that I don't mean to say boys can't be feminine. I just think it is fundamental for children to know there are only two genders instead of being confused
