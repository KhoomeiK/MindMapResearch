Games,fg0tc8r,t1_fg0sjtw,1580414620.0,"Which less features? What is considered unhealthy competition to you, doesn't necessarily have to be unhealthy to others. EGS has all the features that I need, while in my personal opinion, Steam has become bloated since the 17 years it first launched. I, and many others, don't want EGS to become as bloated.

That said, Valve games are exclusive to Steam as well. Is it because Valve developed the games, so they have the right suddenly to FORCE people against their will to use their service? Well... Epic paid the developers for exclusivity (thus helping their development), so why is that any different?"

I've been playing point & click adventure games since the early 90's, so I don't mind the gameplay either, it's just that the main story hasn't captivated me. I'm 10 hours in now and I keep hoping something interesting will happen with the main story, but it's all so mundane (and rather predictable). I really like the host of skills that talk, but it's not enough to keep me engaged. I wish they had a more unique story to offer.

I'm hoping things will change after finally solving the murder case and getting out of the ""island"", but my prediction is that the game will end there."
