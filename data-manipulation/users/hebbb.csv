I am excited to play it, but I can see why some people may be apprehensive. Just know that this game is cheaper than Sw/Sh (newest installment of Pokemon), and you don't have to pay for online functionality. Not to mention you can play the entire game co-op. This game seems more worthwhile than Sw/Sh for me."
