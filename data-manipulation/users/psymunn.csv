wildhearthstone,ffenpj9,t1_ffeh049,1579856235.0,"Doesn't really change the fact that patches is free stats you can consistently hit early, and this is mediocre to bad stats. Doubling imp is not a playable card. And a 2/4 and 2/2 for 3 is not.significantly better.  Certainly not enough to warrant warping your deck with cards like vanilla 2/1s with no pirate tag. 

Again, if you really don't like the 3 drops, try gryphon master. Doesn't dilute your deck, gives you better stats (3/4 and a 2/2), also works with fungal and corridor creepy, and only costs you a weapon charge and some face damage. Also, there's always magic carpet.

You also didn't say why it's better than doubling imp. Drawing and playing a 2/2 is no different to making a token, especially in a deck that draws as few cards as odd rogue. If anything your 'thinning' makes it more likely you'll draw Baku, and imp doesn't require you run bad 1 drops. Imp also doesn't sometimes put a 1/2, a 2/1, or even a 1/1 in play. Try carpet. Try gryphon. Instructor may have some use, if.there's ever a.combo deck. That requires 1 drops in play. But it's just a bad card stats and tempo wise"
wildhearthstone,ffegfsr,t1_ffefyb1,1579847029.0,"Literally no one thought patches was a bad card. The card was spoiled in the final MSG dump, looked beyond broken, and was. Pirate decks were everywhere say 1. Patches is free stats. He turns any 1 drop into the best 1 drop, eg. a 1 mana lost in the jungle that adds a card to your hand and one side has charge.

Skydiving instructor has a bellow cost body, where as most pirates are fairly costed and playable when they aren't fetching patches. Even kvaldir isn't a super high roll, and battlemage  really is just doubling imp. You'd be better running gryphon trainer, which is more stats, more consistent, and synergies with hero power."
