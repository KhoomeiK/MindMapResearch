Edit: Also he DCed and you could've left it at that but instead you seemed to provoke a response just to post it on Reddit I assume. Just leave people like that, it's not good for anyone and feeds into the toxicity"

deadbydaylight,ff5rh86,t3_erqtcp,1579607373.0,"Yeah, tell you what's not fun. I'm rank 4 and alot of the time I'll run the killer around, not be toxic, they are rank 14 or something so it's pretty ez and then I just get facecampers upon first hook because all gens have been completed, or farmed off hook instantly. I swear I've only escaped these last few games because when I get unhooked and the killer waits so they can just slap me I have DS
Edit: And let's not mention how I need to wait at least 15 minutes for a game now. Honestly I think this game has lost fun for both survivors and killers"

fo76,ff5jbcl,t3_eree2h,1579595540.0,"Currently waiting for wastelanders before I start playing again but I do believe fallout 76, whilst sometimes a bit lacking, is a good experience nonetheless. I think while many YouTubers do have a point about problems with the game alot of their ciritcisms are based off what they've heard from sources and the problem with that is they spread it to their subscribers who will automatically take up a negative outlook on the game without being able to make their own opinion. I don't have a problem with YongYea but he is most definitely milking the Bethesda Bad cow and it's pretty detrimental to fallout 76 & it's playerbase"

deadbydaylight,fdmluyh,t1_fdmlp9h,1578554876.0,"No, I guess you don't understand it yourself then. You can't say you said it's widely considered crutch as it wasn't was it. The meme relates to things in a similar state. You could've said: Is also used 80% of time but you also said crutch perk which leads me to believe you are saying it's crutch and it can't really be looked at any other way"

deadbydaylight,fdlnf8k,t1_fdlmiw7,1578527986.0,"I play killer as well, granted not as much as survivor anymore because it's just fcking boring but when I did play alot of killer and when I played with the rift I rarely encountered unfair DSes, sure it happened once or twice where I won a chase and killed the other guy who had just been on hook but those cases were few and far in-between.
DS isn't even that great a perk, it really helps in those situations with shit killers that tunnel but rarely helps any other time. If you actually have any game awareness you will keep an eye on if there is the obsession. You will remember who you've hooked etc."
deadbydaylight,fdlkr65,t1_fdkt600,1578526233.0,Hmm but what is a crutch perk. I thought it was a perk that bad survivors needed to get a boost hence the name crutch. Like the survivor needs a crutch to actually play the game. An antitunnel perk doesn't seem like a crutch perk unless I'm getting the definition wrong?
