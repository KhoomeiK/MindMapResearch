namenerds,ffakcjd,t3_esectg,1579737887.0,"So I immediately thought of the name Adelina, which could have the nickname Addie or Lina. 

I also think Frances or Francesca could have Annie or Frannie as a nickname. Frances seems like a good blend of girly and simple. 

But for Annie as the definite nicknameI thought of: 

Annette, 

Annabelle/a, 

Antonia, 

Anastasia, 

Andromeda, 

Lilianne, 

Ianthe, 

Julianne, 

Roxanne, 

Danica, 

Evangeline, 

Christiane, 

Diana, 

Joann, 

Liana, 

Adrienne, 

Ariana, 

Anneke (pronounces Anna-Kay), 

Andrea, 

Annalie, 

Annalise, 

Briana, 

Savannah, 

Vivianne, 

Roseanne, 

Xanthe, 

Hannah, 

Hope this is at all helpful! Congratulations!"

It wasn’t the virus itself that blinded her, her brain swelled as her body temperature rose. Her body was overwhelmed and hurt her trying to protect her. I hope that makes sense!

OpenChristian,fdhkony,t3_el9tnj,1578424684.0,"I moved five years ago and am still searching for the right church. You should feel comfortable there. Take time to look and listen to their message. 
Church is also just one place. It doesn’t make you less Christian if you don’t go. I believe there are places that livestream their services so check out those!"
OpenChristian,fdhke66,t3_elc2u3,1578424508.0,"I was young so wasn’t as much atheist as I was agnostic. I was raised by Christian parents who told me I was free to develop and hold my own beliefs. I was baptized and went to Sunday school. My belief started to fade as I got older was learned that supposedly you couldn’t be LGBT+, couldn’t change your gender, etc. But my parents sat me down and told me that God is loving and He loves all people for they are His. I thought about this and prayed. I asked if it was okay to have questions and not agree with some beliefs in the Bible. And after I felt a wave of calm, it was simply that He was there, and the said it was okay. Now, I understand better that the Bible was written by man and is an interpretation of His teachings. God is loving and can be a source of comfort, not stress and sin.

AskDocs,fdem201,t3_ekz62d,1578341887.0,"Obligatory NAD, Can she keep anything down? If not she should be started on an IV for dehydration. If she can, keep her hydrated, not just with water but with Gatorade or something with electrolytes. If within a few days she is still this sick, definitely go to the doctor. Listen to your gut as well. I don’t know your mother, you do. If you think something is really wrong, I’d say for certain take her to the urgent care and ER. Better safe than sorry.
