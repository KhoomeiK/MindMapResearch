My cats who just passed away (sobs) was named Binx. She was the best. She was a black maine coon and she just wondered up to my mom’s house out of the woods. We took her to the vet to look for a chip (nope) and put up signs around the neighborhood, but no one claimed her,  so we kept her."

Instagramreality,fepk1od,t1_fenc9dp,1579322517.0,Exactly! I just sent this to my sister and she can not believe it. She asked how the photos can be so different and why all of her other photos look like she has nice skin. The thought never crossed her mind!
