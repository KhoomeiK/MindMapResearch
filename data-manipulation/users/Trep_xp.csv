I didn't enjoy the SWAT gametype, and realising I would have to play it ad nauseam to get the Randy Scout unlocked really killed it. So the best thing to do when FOMO is the only real motivation to do something, is to stop. There are so many other games out there. Destiny currently isn't rewarding your time spent effectively, and all the really cool stuff is behind Eververse. It's insulting."
