cats,fcbhggb,t3_egwzvs,1577586914.0,"Congrats! We just adopted two sisters! We were only going to get one, but the other freaked when I took her sister from the cage, so we decided to foster her. Three weeks later we decided we couldn’t imagine parting with her, so now they get to stay together forever! Your boys look very comfy!"
