AmItheAsshole,fg59d4p,t3_ewr9qk,1580521573.0,NTA sounds like she's in denial or simply doesn't care about your feelings. I think their relationship is pretty worrying and if continued is very likely to end up in some kind of physical or emotional affair.
creepyPMs,fg4y3kf,t1_fg3qbuw,1580513704.0,Report her for what exactly? I'm not underage their are no children in her care. I get what you're saying but I have no idea what she should be locked up for lol I think that's a bit of a stretch. Sure I'll avoid her but I do anyways. I haven't seen her in a long time but still care for her wellbeing and like to check in with her hence not blocking her number... yet.
