povertyfinance,feh8qsf,t3_ep4mmw,1579111482.0,"Congratulations! You have not only gained a monetary raise, but grew tenfold in personal worth - which is truly invaluable.  Also, before you invest in a mouth guard from the dentist, do it the old school way and get one from a discount store for $5.00, heat and fit it yourself.  This way you can get your feet under you before a big purchase. Good luck!"

Edit: Spoiler: What I found most interesting was the mother, all the way to the end. She had no problem with the original cat video, called the Facebook group stalkers (I wonder how they feel/felt about the man who committed suicide - I would have liked to hear what they had to say about that aspect of their investigation) and felt he wasn’t responsible for the death in the end. I was also struck, once again, by the fact that we lose sight of the victims in these cases."
