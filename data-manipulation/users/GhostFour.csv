Hemophilia,ff7vds1,t1_ff7li2p,1579659259.0,"Yeah I'm thinking about switching to Hemlibra.  I'm actually still on Recombinant which is pretty odd around here.  My HTC said they only have one other patient that is still on Recombinant.  Most switched to Eloctate or Advate or one of the other longer lasting products.  I've been doing really well on my Recombinant prophylaxis program and I'm not anxious to change something that has worked so well.  I was late to the prophy game so when I started avoiding bleeds almost completely, I didn't want to mess with success.  Switching products would take me from 12 sticks per month to 8 sticks per month but that didn't seem like a big enough incentive for me to experimenting with another product.   Now with Hemlibra, it seems like it might be worth the change.  My HTC offered it to me last June but I wanted to wait a year to see what popped up.  So far everything I've heard has been positive so I'll probably switch to Hemlibra this June when I go for my annual HTC visit.  Hemlibra was created for those with inhibitors which is probably why they have you labelled an ""ideal candidate"".  I understand not wanting to get pushed into a new product but it seems like this one might be worth the change.  That and the fact that I'm finally starting to have a little trouble with my veins.  I wouldn't mind an easy subcutaneous shot these days.  I'm still looking for an example or two of guys that didn't stay on Hemlibra though, just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm convinced it's a great product but I'm not convinced any product is 100%.  I'd like to hear about the problems or reasons people switched back to a traditional IV Factor VIII just to balance the reviews a little bit."
Hemophilia,ff7juyz,t3_es1nen,1579651259.0,"I haven't made the jump to Hemlibra but I'm severe A mid 40s with plenty of damage.  Didn't get on the prophylaxis wagon until late 30s.  As far as pain, I've noticed ""new"" pain is the worst.  I guess we find ways to tolerate chronic pain in the same place.  Probably something built into humans and animals to survive but when something different than usual pops up, it can be rough.  I've also had issues where certain joints give me another level of pain.  Most bleeds were low, throbbing, constant, dull pain but for a while, an ankle or elbow bleed would have me considering some dark options.  My ankles finally got worn out enough that they're tolerable and overall prophylactic treatment has kept me from dealing with ""new"" pain.  Sounds like Hemlibra might be a good option for you.  Also, I took ibuprofen by the handful for many years.  It's unmatched for OTC pain medication but it also encourages bleeding so I was only making things worse in the long run.  Talk to your doc about Celebrex or Meloxicam for an anti-inflammatory that won't encourage bleeding.  From what I remember talking to a Hemlibra rep, once a month works decent but depending on the dose, you may be forced to spread it out over the month, hence once or twice per week.  But I'm not an expert and it's been a while since I asked about the ""once a month"" reality of Hemlibra.   Just some info based on my personal experience.  Hopefully it helps you work out a comfortable program for yourself."

Probably an hour total prep/cooking time and it was fall-apart tender.  I didn't expect it to be as good as a slow cooked roast but I was surprised.  I like a crock pot but sometimes I'm gone too long to let a roast cook the entire time so I tried a quick Foodi method and was satisfied.

Add the food to the fry basket (maybe put the rice on some foil so it doesn't fall through the holes), and pressure cook for 2 minutes.  If you don't add enough water you'll get a error because it can't build enough pressure but honestly if it sat in the basket over steaming water for a few minutes, even if the Foodi doesn't build pressure,  the steam will still heat the food.

NinjaFoodiOurRecipes,fdbdk64,t3_ejrxf5,1578256329.0,"Fresh pasta is going to cook fast but the filling needs to be heated through so you might need a couple tries to get the cooking time right.  Add 2-3 cups of water into the Foodi, add some salt, maybe a teaspoon add tortellinis to the air fry basket, put pressure cooker lid on Foodi, pressure cook on high for 10 minutes (I'm guessing on time and you'll need to adjust depending on the filling).  If I were you, I'd cook a single tortellini following the above instructions for 6 minutes first to see if the filling is hot and cheese melted.  If not, add a minute or two until you find the perfect time."

NinjaFoodiOurRecipes,fcu4m9t,t3_eii88z,1577972428.0,"If you want to make this fast and easy, dump everything in the bottom of the pot, turn it on ""pressure cooker"" for 15 minutes and you're done.  A few minutes longer for large or frozen pieces of chicken.  

If you want to prepare it more like a meal for yourself, and cook things separately to give the ingredients their own texture...
Bake chicken on a rack or in air fryer basket (350 until done, like an oven)
Remove chicken, add rice and liquid to bottom of the pot (leave chicken drippings in pot), add raw vegetables to rack or basket and pressure cook for 15 minutes.  (White rice cooks much faster, 3-4 minutes).  If you are using frozen vegetables, you might want to steam them separately for a minute.  The only difference for ground beef is to dump it in the bottom of the pan first on sear/saute and brown as usual (if you're cooking everything separate).
After a couple of times you'll learn to adjust the amount of liquid and times to get everything perfect.  You can't really hurt anything, just dump it in and turn it on.  Good luck!"

The ribs come out ""fall off the bone"" tender but we like them to be tender without falling off the bone.  I'm just backing off the time in the pressure cooker until I find that magic number.  Might be time to cook another rack.  Reading about them when I'm hungry is a good motivator."
