socialanxiety,fcssle1,t3_eiogpr,1577924059.0,Join the discord of this subreddit if you want that.
socialanxiety,fcqz072,t1_fcqxnb9,1577894329.0,That's a great idea. I guess friends and family would definitely be willing to do that.
socialanxiety,fcqu9rl,t1_fcqmvms,1577892294.0,"It might be a good idea to make a list of situations and think of how you could make eye contact in such a situation. What I noticed with my current guideline is that if you are talking yourself and the other person is only asking questions sometimes that you are still not really making eye contact. Then if you have these guidelines you actually know concretely what you can do which could possibly turn into a habit.

An concrete for example could for example be if you are shaking someone hands you could look the person in the eyes. But I am not able right now to make up a list like that just out of the top of my head. I think you will need to encounter a lot of situations and write down the most general ones and then think about what would be a proper way to make eye contact in such a situation. I guess you could possibly even ask a therapist for help, maybe this even already exists somewhere. But I suppose it is possible to do also do it by yourself."

socialanxiety,fcq374a,t3_eidgoy,1577877737.0,How are you planning to do that? My guideline right now is to look at someone if they speak and look away if I say something.
socialanxiety,fcnocsh,t3_ei2z33,1577815319.0,Deleting it. These social media only exploit your data for money anyways.
socialanxiety,fcnnz4e,t3_ei2am5,1577815104.0,With friends
socialanxiety,fcnno9y,t3_ei5rwv,1577814936.0,Do you have a school counsellor? I can remember that there was something for fear of failure in my high school. Maybe you could try that.
socialanxiety,fcmtnlt,t3_ehxy6b,1577791716.0,"Well maybe you could start by just mentioning that you have troubles pronounciating words at the beginning of the presentation. After that I would suggest making use of tools like a powerpoint. If there is a word you cannot really pronounce you could put that on a slide. If people have read the word already they will probably understand you.

You could also use like your phone as a tool in normal conversation. Just mention your problem and then type out the hard words on a note. I guess people will understand it then."
socialanxiety,fcjtzk2,t3_ehgrtt,1577704627.0,"I would just try it, if it fails you can always fall back on Zoloft."
socialanxiety,fcjt45g,t3_ehir4w,1577703353.0,"One trick you could use if you wish to practice conversating is the following:

Start a conversation and ask about general stuff like work or education. If you notice that someone is excited about something continue asking questions about that topic. This way the person will do all the talking and you will barely have to expose anything about yourself. Moreover, the person will probably also believe you to be a nice person. 

Also the more you expose yourself in social situations, the better you will be able to learn to cope with it. Avoiding it is a great short term strategy, but in the long term it will make it even worse."
socialanxiety,fcik3f4,t3_ehaqoq,1577663878.0,"I also thought about doing that lately, but the fun I have with friends keeps me from seriously considering it. I also hated high school severely and I was happy when that shit was over. I got one of my best friends from a sportclub instead of high school. In high school you have a lot of brats collected involuntarely in a classroom, but in sports club or other clubs related to your intetests you might find more like minded people."
socialanxiety,fcie6t5,t3_eh9tn7,1577661208.0,Well imagine a time you feel very stressed about something and then add that feeling to every social/performance situation.
socialanxiety,fcidvh2,t3_eh71q4,1577661079.0,There is no solution. The only thing to do is exposing yourself and try to learn to live with it.
depression,fc6oec0,t3_egfnor,1577485422.0,"I would suggest trying to create a good diet routine. You could for example try to create a list of healthy meals and unhealthy meals you enjoy. Than if you have this list you could plan for a whole month every day what you are going to eat/cook. You could for example try to eat healthy 5 days of the week and unhealthy for 2 days of the week. This way you will eat healthy and still enjoy the pleasure of fats, sugars and salts. 

If you have gotten a schedule for a whole month what you will eat each day you can try to repeat this for multiple months. If you manage to accomplish this you will be able to make a routine of it. The major contributor to losing weight is also your diet, exercise can help, but not as much as your diet. Thus, if you manage to get a good diet routine you might also loose weight in a comfortable way. A great way to get exercise might also be by getting a pet. This will force you to go outside with the pet and create a routine of it."
