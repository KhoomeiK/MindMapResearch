TwoXChromosomes,ffp4lq8,t1_ffoqs1w,1580086102.0,I'm definitely working on it. I've had to learn that just because I'm not bothered doesn't mean we both feel that way. Doing my best to be intentional about being better!
TwoXChromosomes,ffo69v0,t1_ffnzxag,1580074535.0,"I am female in a heterosexual relationship, and I am a big offender of not taking initiative on household tasks. I am a slob, I'll own it. My boyfriend likes things very clean, and he gets frustrated when I don't feel the same. We've been talking about how we can bridge this gap before we move in together in June."
fatlogic,ffn1vvd,t1_ffmluok,1580061082.0,"""High BMI"" doesn't even start until a BMI of 25. You likely are at a fine weight for your height."
fatlogic,ffn10jo,t1_ffl001l,1580060885.0,"I see people complain about this all the time, but my Versa is pretty on point. It matches online calculators for my TDEE. Maybe the later models are more accurate or something?"
fatlogic,ffn0nei,t1_ffmxar8,1580060755.0,"In some ways, I miss my competitive swimming days. My body looked awesome and I ate basically whatever I wanted. The workouts were brutal, though, so pros and cons."
fatlogic,ffigakn,t1_ffi8juu,1579973175.0,"Just wanted to say that I feel for you and this is the worst feeling. I recently weighed myself after noticing that my jeans weren't fitting right, and found out that I've gained almost twenty pounds in a year. I guess I wasn't just bloated. 

We can do it!"
fatlogic,ffig0qr,t1_ffi83vf,1579972988.0,"I'm a 6 at Target, which is crazy because I'm 5'6 and 174 pounds. I definitely need to lose twenty pounds and I am not a small person."
fatlogic,ffifppu,t1_ffi6kmk,1579972778.0,"I don't know, have you ever seen the calorie counts for cashews? One ounce is like 160 calories. If this person wasn't weighing or otherwise measuring, it seems like it would be really fucking easy to accidentally smash like 800 calories of nuts."
GreatDane,ffe242e,t3_esxghi,1579834707.0,"Mine had her tail amputated, and she was just fine. If anything, it was a positive in the long run for everybody involved! (The velocity of the tail is no joke.)

Now she wags her whole butt if she's happy. It's kind of adorable.

Best wishes to your pup. I know it's hard."
grandrapids,femz0ih,t3_eq0ymb,1579273214.0,"I lived at Richmond Hills for a year and paid $825 (including one very large doggo). It's in Walker rather than in the city, but an Uber downtown was fairly inexpensive. I really liked living there - the staff is friendly and helpful, and the apartments are pretty well-maintained. Best of all, heat is included!"
loseit,fdhoeif,t1_fdhn82c,1578426924.0,"I would really like to understand your position about this post, since you're all over this thread talking about how much you dislike it. 

I'm not seeing anything about this doctor not believing that being overweight causes health issues. All they seem to be saying is that strategies should be provided in a helpful, empathic way, in a way that they can hear, and that this makes it easier for people to make a lifestyle change.

Do you feel this person is outside of her scope of practice? Do you feel that your profession is being devalued? Is ""tough love"" just more your thing? I'm asking these things because I would really like to get where you're coming from."
loseit,fdhmopw,t1_fdhhhxi,1578425900.0,"I think OP's point is that the two are not mutually exclusive. You can address the issues related to excess weight, and do it in a helpful, empathic way that makes people more likely to follow through. Demoralized people typically don't want to follow through on anything."
loseit,fdhld55,t1_fdhi166,1578425102.0,">**Along with a nutritionist** and a therapist, I then started an education/support group for patients who were struggling with issues related to being heavy.

Seems that they did this exact thing in their group? 

I also have mixed feelings about some of the details in this post, but I really like the overall spirit of it. Self-hate only gets you so far. People who have an unhealthy relationship with food or don't understand the role of food in their life will logically end up where they started."
loseit,fcz84j6,t1_fcyjffy,1578095592.0,"To add to this, I go to the gym often and I literally cannot think of one specific person I've seen there."
fatlogic,fcz55re,t1_fcyrdas,1578093878.0,"Also, someone please correct me if this isn't right, but I've also heard that she told them to fuck off and didn't end up losing said 35lbs."
fatlogic,fcjial4,t1_fcjdnk4,1577688655.0,"As a person who cares deeply about social justice, I have this theory that people who equate fatness with racial discrimination are almost always white."
fatlogic,fbrekds,t1_fbpvkqh,1577042113.0,I'm with ya! Depotatoing for 2020!
