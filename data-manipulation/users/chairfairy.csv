technicallythetruth,fgsb710,t1_fgrotha,1581079190.0,"I grew up in the rural Midwest so I spent plenty of time learning about conservative views. I don't think the problem is the original reasoning behind the positions. What I struggle with is the bullheaded refusal to consider solutions that we know have better outcomes just because it goes against some arbitrary principle.

Example 1: abortion. They want to minimize abortion, but they refuse to implement social programs that have been shown time and time again to reduce abortion and teen pregnancy. States with better sex ed that teaches about contraceptives and/or make contraceptives freely available to teens show dramatic decreases in abortion. ""But kids might learn about sex!"" is the only counter argument, even though kids definitely already know about and have sex. Abstinence only education is self-righteous posturing and it helps no one.

Note that my reasoning doesn't even touch the not-unconvincing argument that abortion control is really about controlling women and poverty. Plain and simple - they act like 17th century puritans who are afraid of sex.

Example 2: welfare. They claim welfare is bad because it means I have to pay for poor people and all those welfare queens will just take advantage of that (which, let's remember, is a fiction created by the GOP). So what about programs that actually stimulate the generation of more tax dollars than they cost? Food stamps and, to tie in example 1, programs involved in contraceptive availability / sex ed both result in more tax dollars coming back to the government than were spent to fund the program.

So if we're all about society spending less money on poor people, then we should implement these programs that generate tax money. But they refuse! Because ""principles.""

Publicly funded healthcare also fits in this boat. People don't want to pay for someone else's medical care, but guess what we already are because people who can't afford insurance / medical care are forced to go to the emergency room because the ER can't refuse to serve someone who needs it. And who pays for those unpaid ER visits? The rest of us.

And guess what - with the ER as their only option they're also waiting to go until they're severely sick. You know what's more expensive than regular checkups and preventive medicine? Treating someone who is severely sick. Publicly funded healthcare would let people stay healthy, which is much cheaper than emergency treatment. So if our goal is to minimize cost, then we should use the cheapest option. The cheapest option is clearly not whatever version of the free market we have now, so maybe we ease up on arguing that capitalism will fix the problem that it created.

Free market capitalism isn't a *moral* philosophy. American exceptionalism has no basis in Christianity. Yet the GOP pretends otherwise."
