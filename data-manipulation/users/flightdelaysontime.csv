news,ffvti6v,t3_evbtz5,1580272804.0,"My kids are 16 and 17. I’m counting down the months that I no longer have to give their fucking deadbeat mom anymore money. Sure, that sounds harsh but their mom refuses to work, has a BA, and is fully able bodied and capable to work. She spends the money on organic food and weed. 


Fuck the child support system. It’s completely designed to fuck men over and drives disparity and suicide rates."
WeightLossAdvice,ffrttyz,t3_euruso,1580165687.0,I switched to black about 5 years ago. But for me it was cream AND sugar. The sugar reduction was good not only for my fitness goals but also for my teeth because I drink coffee pretty much all day here and there.

“Muscle is much denser than fat, which means muscle occupies less space (volume) in the body compared to fat. Muscle has a leaner appearance due to its high density whereas fat occupies more space (volume) in the body. Two people could weight the same but could look very different depending on their body composition – a person with high body-fat percentage versus a person with high lean muscle percentage will be in two different sizes of clothes and health risk.”"
