EGID,fffjvqo,t1_fffjliv,1579885538.0,It is. Its extremely painful. And exhausting. I'll see what I can find out.
EGID,fffjci0,t1_fffj6uh,1579885206.0,I could ask. I've been sick really bad since june. And didnt know why. Then I had my colonoscopy friday and got my biopsy results yesterday.
EGID,fffivjw,t1_fffijhh,1579884918.0,Thank you. Dairy is my main trigger. Also gluten so far. Egg bothers me alot as well. I'd like to meet with a dietician but because they cost without insurance it's something I'm afraid I can't do. So I'm trying to do alot on my own. I'm waiting to see my gi doctor in April and see what recommendations they have
EGID,ffen3sb,t1_ffebd06,1579855345.0,Thank you. I would try a dietician but my insurance absolutely doesn't cover it. And I had talked to her and she charged too much and I'm low income. I'm a single mom. So I'm pretty stressed already. Although I know it would probably help alot. I'll see If my doctor and I can figure something out. Maybe they have some info.
SingleParents,ffa9tj2,t1_ffa47p0,1579730688.0,Yeah agreed it's a hard thing I get it. Plus it's more pain when you do talk about it
SingleParents,ff9zztq,t3_ese4my,1579725113.0,Yes I'm always afraid to tell people I'm a single parent and they ask what happened to the father and judge me. His parents are barely involved either and ex has a new baby he cares more about than my almost 3 year old. I think you are doing your part as mom and that's all the matters right ?
LesbianActually,ff6a493,t1_ff5fi66,1579622676.0,Yeah that definitely sounds like a mood booster :)
SingleParents,ff3bzyg,t1_ff3bp4f,1579538173.0,Oh its okay. Sorry when I type sometimes I tend to accidentally leave things out. My exes mom sadly went through alot because my exes father was alot like my ex. He put her through alot. Its just history repeating. But my daughter doesn't deserve it and she comes before them. But Its just a be civil situation you don't want fighting and resentment.
SingleParents,ff3be6n,t1_ff3b3tz,1579537867.0,I've never not let them see her. My door was always open to them. Unfortunately neither of his parents kept in contact as much as I did. I told them you are welcome to come see as often as you like as long as I'm not busy.
insomnia,ff2i7as,t1_ff2hylh,1579507237.0,Oh yeah. Its terrible
insomnia,ff2g47t,t1_ff2fn27,1579504665.0,No problem
alopecia_areata,ff26xcw,t1_ff26reh,1579495546.0,Yeah it's been pretty itchy in that area. The only thing that helps was lots of conditioner.
insomnia,ff22jje,t1_ff22hwk,1579492060.0,Lmao pfft who says adults can't have stuffed animals ?
alopecia_areata,ff215vs,t1_ff21032,1579491024.0,I'm pretty lactose intolerant and try to stay away from dairy. That's a good idea thank you.
alopecia_areata,ff20csy,t1_ff1zq90,1579490439.0,That's the only spot. No where else. I've been itchy for awhile. But I guess all over my head. My dermatologist said it looks like I have pretty bad dandruff but otherwise nothing stood out besides alopecia and she wanted to do steroid injections.
SingleParents,ff1plg5,t1_ff1pji4,1579483348.0,Very:( I was very close with them.
insomnia,ff1p53g,t1_ff1or2b,1579483061.0,Oh yeah I'll definitely test that out. I think my best friend said there is stuffed animal ones you can warm now to
SingleParents,ff1nxiy,t1_ff1npck,1579482330.0,It wasn't easy ever. But I try to do the right thing
SingleParents,ff1hofp,t1_ff1bt04,1579479392.0,Thank you I try my best every day
SingleParents,ff1hj0r,t1_ff1cuot,1579479321.0,Yeah I was fine with him coming around as long as he knew not to show pictures yet. I've always told exes family they are welcome at my place.
insomnia,ff1hcnt,t1_ff1d0im,1579479238.0,Oh that's a good idea. She might love that.
SingleParents,ff1h9lq,t1_ff1egbx,1579479199.0,Thank you. I'll have to see what my state guidelines are. I try my hardest not to say anything bad. I mean shes more verbal being almost three. But I find something slip out and I'm like oh no I didn't mean
insomnia,ff0kp54,t1_ff0kdum,1579469775.0,Thank you so much
insomnia,ff0k3tr,t1_ff0jry8,1579469598.0,Bath time is too much stimulation. But she does love scents. Could try tea if its sweetened a little she might drink it. I just saw a melatonin lotion.  I might try as well.
insomnia,ff0j3zm,t1_ff0iig2,1579469360.0,Yeah she is so miserable she comes out crying to me and lays on me exhausted. But at her age they don't recommend anything beyond melatonin or benadryl. And that had to be okayed with her doctor. So got her a weighted blanket to try to get her a few hours of a nap. But I know her misery.
insomnia,ff0h46i,t1_ff0fxmx,1579468847.0,Definitely my daughter has insomnia to. With her autism. Shes going on 3. The harder it is for her to sleep the less sleep I get. I feel for my kid. And anyone with it honestly
insomnia,ff0eeez,t3_er1jg9,1579468097.0,I had insomnia before my daughter its just a double whammy with kids. Don't let anyone tell insomnia isn't hard. I remember being on tons of sleep medications before my daughter. I tried so so many things. You get to that point of I haven't slept and I'm going crazy.
SingleParents,ff0dhdx,t1_ff0bjdw,1579467879.0,Shes going on 3 in march. And thank you so much. When I do go out I usually have my mom with me Haha I don't have a ton of friends.
SingleParents,ff0au26,t1_ff0aig4,1579466991.0,Yes agreed. It's not often I have anyone babysit. Maybe like once every 3 months or so and even then I feel bad. I was pretty alone after her dad wasn't around. So I'm so glad for this sub reddit.
SingleParents,ff09lom,t1_ff092ji,1579466641.0,It has been. My family Is close by but its mostly me. They baby sit when they can so I can rest. She's an amazing kid and I want someone to see that to. We are a package deal. Since joining reddit I've realised there's alot of people out there who feel the same as I do. Its alot less lonely knowing that.
SingleParents,ff08en1,t3_eqvk1d,1579466254.0,I know how it goes. My daughter is autistic and takes up all my time. I haven't dated since she was born and my ex husband walked out on us. It's a hard thing to get back into. You always got the kids on your mind first. I miss it to. And dating apps are really my only source of a way to date but they aren't great and I don't want to bring people in and out to confuse her either. But hun hang in there okay? All of us get how that feels. How hard it is.
depression_help,fezjt50,t1_fezj1n9,1579458083.0,Yes it is
depression_help,feyv6e3,t1_feyv2bo,1579450935.0,Thank you. I'm trying. I try to get out of my own head for awhile to
LesbianActually,feys2d7,t1_feyrb76,1579449890.0,"Yes definitely. As far as I know there isn't alot of LGBTQ members in the area and if there is not talked about much. I grew up in such a small town. If you even tell people you are gay , or bisexual. Anything but straight and you turn heads. But I think we have alot more progressive adults anyway. Which is pretty cool. Especially at my age almost 27."
socialanxiety,feyl5dx,t1_feyjqj2,1579447046.0,Agreed. I have no idea honestly which app is decent anymore.
depression,fexl4wl,t1_fexl0i3,1579432779.0,I know :( that's why also falling in love is hard. Making friends. You just never know
depression,fexkl7w,t1_fexkco3,1579432497.0,I hide mine as well until I'm comfortable and like someone which is when I then open up. I'm not usually very open.  So it's hard when I'm alone all over again.
depression,fexjvjm,t1_fexjozv,1579432170.0,Yes agreed. Depression sucks. I'm often called toxic because I'm such a downer. Like I'm sorry I don't mean to be
depression_help,fexj1xe,t1_fexhjpp,1579431798.0,Right it's hard when I relate to alot of people because I wanna help
depression_help,fexejb5,t1_fexects,1579429704.0,Thank you I try. It's just the mom in me. I don't like to see anyone sad.
pansexual,fex5q74,t3_epjo0z,1579424893.0,I feel the same ! My preferences make no sense and I feel confused. And I couldn't ever label it. So I think you are valid. Being pansexual isn't one way or the other.
offmychest,fex4bha,t3_eqtaen,1579424097.0,You got this. You are ambitious. With your mindset you can achieve that and so much more. All of us are rooting for you. I don't know you but I'm delayed from cerebral palsy and epilepsy but my goals changed throughout life. Delayed doesn't mean stupid. You seem smart. So keep at it.
depression,fex3xnw,t1_fex3azt,1579423897.0,Yes agreed. I've started to disassociate alot I dont know if its trauma or not but it's terrible. I dont feel like I've ever really lived life for what it was. But I wanna be happy like really happy. And I wish that for anyone with depression.
offmychest,fex3lrb,t1_fex3e19,1579423730.0,Thank you I'm trying. I'm still recovering from mental and emotional abuse my ex husband put me through so I gotta focus on that so I can be the mom she needs to.
offmychest,fex1b0e,t1_fewzlaz,1579422695.0,Thank you.  Luckily my family was always supportive. My daughter knows love from me and them. But it doesn't make that hurt any less. I hope one day it will hurt less. For my daughter I'm not sure though. My hope is that I meet someone who loves and adores her the way I have all these years.
offmychest,fex0zt8,t1_fewzi4p,1579422565.0,Thank you
socialanxiety,fewzbsb,t1_fewww73,1579421799.0,I think I had used meet me in 2016 ?? But years ago it was my year book. I dont know all of them are terrible now. And I've had people be just really mean in general. But I can say there is genuine people out there. It's not the apps.  It's more so finding the people who are there for the reasons you are. Right ?
socialanxiety,fewwhr1,t3_eqt51a,1579420567.0,I hear ya it's the hardest platform. I met my first few boyfriends on those platforms. Got married. Had my divorce in 2018. Just now getting back into dating and it's horrible. I feel like people aren't all that authentic.  I'm always honest. But it's always hit or miss. I've tried several and it's hard for me to meet people otherwise in my circumstances if not from online. I'm sorry like I really am. Because I know how it feels. I'm using them right now and no such luck myself.
depression,fewvl7h,t3_eqsuib,1579420175.0,Hope you are okay ?
depression_help,fewut4o,t1_fewuj40,1579419823.0,One day I will. I have one good friend we live far apart. My others it's very rare occasions they don't make the time although I've invited them over. So I just started to focus on my daughter and me because my health hasn't been the best. But when I see someone who is out there hurting it makes me sad for them. I know how it feels
depression_help,fewt3xs,t1_fewrcq9,1579419091.0,I've been there. Many times . But you need good people
depression_help,fevrvbv,t3_eqme8c,1579400785.0,I hope you find people who care about you. Who consider you a first option not a last. Depression sucks as is. Please don't let those thoughts you feel now be the last you have on your mind as you go to bed. They must hurt.
socialanxiety,fes7ng5,t1_fes6w5a,1579362210.0,Thank you
socialanxiety,fes6itw,t1_fes681h,1579361911.0,Right I'm excited
socialanxiety,fes5w4l,t1_fes5si6,1579361762.0,We get to see each other this summer. And social media helps
socialanxiety,fes3yqh,t1_fes2rot,1579361145.0,It is I spend alot of time alone. My closest friend is a thousand miles away.
socialanxiety,fes2ap9,t1_fes24m5,1579360652.0,That's great. Everyone needs that
socialanxiety,fes1r9x,t1_fes1esa,1579360557.0,No problem. Anxiety is hard alone that's a big step.
depression_memes,fes015v,t3_eqcim9,1579360084.0,I had friends until I got really depressed and dealing with epilepsy it was too much for them. So they stopped coming around essentially and now I'll run into them with a promise to hang out sometime.
socialanxiety,ferznno,t1_ferzi15,1579359944.0,I'm so happy for you
socialanxiety,ferym63,t1_ferygug,1579359672.0,It's all I'm good at. Unless it's my best friend lol
socialanxiety,fery7xo,t1_fery3d9,1579359550.0,Me neither. I'm better in text than I am starting conversation.
socialanxiety,ferxl60,t1_ferxcl2,1579359366.0,Thank you. It's easier today. I go grocery shopping and other things. But it's hard to talk
socialanxiety,ferwkmq,t1_fervvzm,1579359041.0,Yes they can. But regardless I grew up kind. I'm 26 now and i refuse to be anything less. Alot of people need that. Of course social anxiety makes it hard ..everyone just thinks you are shy it's so much more.
socialanxiety,fervgzu,t1_ferujw2,1579358748.0,I'm so glad. Most of my classmates up through high school bullied me for it. Except for one. He was gay hadn't come out until after high school. But all those years stuck by my side to make sure I was okay. I never forgot it either.
socialanxiety,ferufsg,t1_ferml65,1579358475.0,Oh no. If people were more aware of anxiety. I think it would be great. Once I got to high school my teachers said no more speeches or anything it's too much. It was written in iep.
pansexual,feru43x,t1_fer23ay,1579358357.0,Thank you I might have to do that
socialanxiety,fertygi,t1_fernx5x,1579358299.0,I'm really sorry
depression,fepnpqm,t1_fepniru,1579325429.0,You can always message me. Its alot of weight to carry you know? No there isn't. I was pretty young when depression hit. And I don't relate to anyone my age.
autismacceptance,fepnm9c,t3_eqbzil,1579325352.0,I don't hate it. But I feel like it's misunderstood. My daughter is autistic. I have a younger brother with autism and a best friend. All important to me. I'm sure you having autism it hurts to see.  I try to raise awareness. I spend alot of time researching and trying to understand it. But I would never hate someone who has it. You are a person and unique.
bipolar,fepn1y5,t1_fepmu85,1579324883.0,I hope so hun.  In my state I don't know much.  I've heard psychologists are good for diagnosis but I know for children therapy worked great. You gotta find what works for you.
depression_help,feplrp6,t1_fepll5e,1579323850.0,I tried actually. My epilepsy was torture. But my doctors and nurses and family all standing around me as it was happening. I ended up in the er. And I think it was my best friend who gave me my strength back. But i lost all the other friends I had.
depression_help,fepkzih,t1_fepkvlo,1579323248.0,I'm so sorry. My longest streak I wanna say was over 6 months. I hope you get through it I really do. Because no one deserves the hell that is depression.
depression_help,fepkndo,t1_fepkjnn,1579322982.0,:( yes. I push on for my kid. Because that's what keeps me going on.  But it's hard everyday. I dont know how to explain it  I was 11 when I first felt depression.
depression_help,fepk16c,t1_fepjwij,1579322506.0,Yes. It's a sad reality. I dont wish depression on anyone. It feels like a weight on my mind and body.
depression,fepjvjd,t3_eqb9d0,1579322386.0,Oh hun. I think we all ask this. In 2016 I first diagnosed with nonepileptic seizures. In 2019 epilepsy. New years eve alopecia areata. In 2015 bipolar with depression.  It feels like there was never a normal. My mom wants to give me a normal life so badly. Especially after I lost my independence. You aren't alone. At least in the fact.  That you have so much going on.
socialanxiety,fepioam,t3_eq9aem,1579321494.0,"Yes. I have severe social anxiety. I was in 8th grade and I was forced to give a speech and I broke out in tears trying to talk and all the kids were looking at me and I wanted to run from the room. The teacher had to get up and stand by me.  I heard whispers of them saying , "" why is she crying ?"" I was so humiliated. I'm 26 and I still think about it."
depression_help,fepib1w,t3_eq4l5i,1579321219.0,I agree. When I have a horrible day or months. I cannot be positive I feel way worse forcing it. I'd rather deal with it the way I know how than pretend I dont feel depressed. You cannot snap out of it .
bipolar,fepg8wt,t3_eq7w9s,1579319730.0,Well I'm glad you got a diagnosis. My daughter is level 3. If you are an adult and need resources just ask around. But I hope it provides clarity. It can be hard to accept.
bipolar,fepd5mu,t1_fepcz5e,1579317596.0,Yeah I suppose that's a different way to think about it. I guess I only sent nudes once I really really liked someone. But i have anxiety to. So I'm really bad about how I see myself. I'm working on it.
jacksepticeye,fepcbiv,t3_eq4rup,1579317030.0,Aw hun. I'm glad you have his videos. So sorry for your loss. Hang in there.
bipolar,fepbt6c,t1_fepbdgu,1579316688.0,Sure !
bipolar,fepb840,t1_fepazlj,1579316299.0,Yes I totally know what you mean.  I can experience mania for a few weeks then slowly crash and feel everything at once. And I'm so emotional.
bipolar,fepavsv,t1_fepariq,1579316068.0,I'm glad it's not just me. Like the second I got into it and I felt crushed because once you send those pictures you can't unsend . It's there forever.
LesbianActually,fepaqw6,t3_eq64uj,1579315975.0,Trans girls are just as valid as any other woman. I would still date a trans girl. The only thing that ever matters is respect in a relationship.  It's hard being trans honey.
bipolar,fepaldg,t3_eq7pzz,1579315869.0,Hypersexuality is terrible. When I liked someone I found myself sending nudes and I'm like why do I do this when they aren't going to stick around? What if I look easy to them? I judged myself so so hard for it. And it's not like it wasn't reciprocated. The person liked me back.
u_emmyhurd93,fep9r29,t1_fep9n1x,1579315316.0,Thank you !

alopecia_areata,fe6jdnn,t1_fe6j3z1,1578892798.0,"I took the plunge after my hair began to fall out in clumps and all I had left was the hair on the sides and could barely cover up the bald spots. I cried pretty hard. I think being bald was less emotional. I mean yes I still get emotional. Because my family will say I don't like that wig on you or that hat. Blah, blah, blah . It does get hot and cold off and on. It was 14 degrees this morning though I could see my breathe going outside. So if you arent bundled you'd freeze"

SingleParents,fe6cs2s,t1_fe6c7i6,1578887161.0,I understand. I don't want to hurt her at all. I feel like there is no easy way to do this. But one day I would give her a choice when she felt ready
