When I realized none of my contacts outside of family and closest friends were interacting with me on it, I got rid of it.

Like take into account that society has evolved into something that is more progressive, even if some oppose it. When he took office, it wasn’t even twenty years after the Civil Rights Movement.

About fifty years after that movement, we had a black President who invited two people who had conflicting views on race and law enforcement over to the White House for a beer.

For the potential hire, it puts them in an awkward situation where they may not know how to respond. And depending how they respond, they may feel as if they’re wrong for being who they are.

For the company, it puts them at risk for bad PR and a lawsuit. Say you ask a potential hire in an interview if they go to church. They say “No, I’m an atheist.” If you choose to not hire them, or hire them in with questionable pay, they may have grounds to stand on to file a discrimination lawsuit.
