depression,fdigmca,t3_elhxst,1578442457.0,Thank you for posting this. I struggle with these things as well and no one seems to get it. Its a challenge just to get out of bed on a daily basis.
depression,fd89hrr,t1_fd87v3x,1578215472.0,"Thank you so much. With therapy I'm getting there, but it's traumatizing to me how much loss it created prior to this. Yay I'm starting to fix it! But it doesn't matter because it's too late, it's already taken away everything"
depression,fd87nku,t1_fd87aij,1578214853.0,"Exactly and most importantly, you have to get to the root cause of the problem to solve it."
depression,fd82yg1,t3_ejx4cu,1578213346.0,"Thank you for posting. I was traumatized as a young child and when I expressed sadness or cried I would hear ""You should be lucky you have a roof over your head!"" or ""He is a spoiled brat and needs to be punished!"""
depression,fd0aavf,t3_ejnao7,1578115964.0,I can relate. Especially as a male. People treat me almost like I am defective because I have anxiety and depression
depression,fcx2u6e,t3_ejamne,1578048761.0,I wish. For me it's the opposite
depression,fct8jv1,t1_fct3ujy,1577935732.0,That is a good one but for me when people can't see it they don't believe me
depression,fcsywtm,t1_fcshf6x,1577928588.0,"I've heard that my whole life. Along with ""Why don't you smile more?????"""
depression,fcsxpx4,t1_fcs0v0x,1577927748.0,"That's exactly it. Its not about how you look or what you have, when it's part of your bio programming that you are bad, should suffer and feel horrible it happens before you can even think about it"
depression,fcsxjni,t1_fcrq16d,1577927627.0,"Yep, or since it's not physical you can obviously change it if you really wanted to"
depression,fcpfr95,t3_eidxlt,1577862018.0,I really thank you for posting this. At least I know I'm not the only one who feels like this. I'm literally a burden on everyone. I wake up to be alone and beg for help.
depression,fcpf6sq,t3_eibe9y,1577861331.0,I definitely can relate. Sometimes I feel like I already have stopped living
