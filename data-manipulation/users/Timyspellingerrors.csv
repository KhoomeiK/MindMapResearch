kansascity,ffna765,t3_ettdck,1580063586.0,"Everyone is encouraged to call the district office and complain, the new superintendent and his cronies are running the district into the ground. The idea is that they are going to rent 1 venue for 1 day and do all of the graduations that day to save money at the expenses of struggling families getting to experience their children's graduation. The other side effect is that the ceremonies will be rushed in and out to get the next ceremony going. Also the district office is pushing the backlash off to the school principals who have no say in the matter.

Edit: it's been a while since I've caught up on this so they may have adjusted the time frames but the idea is still the same, trying to get more bang for their buck out of each venue rental, although when I graduated we did it at the school and didn't seem to have much of an issue"

You should never assume that any money goes mostly to an employee, do you tip your electrician, car salesman, mechanic, etc. That ""labor"" or ""delivery"" charge also goes to cover overhead costs like office staff wages, vehicle costs and maintenance, that t.v. that you broke that one time, and other expenses that you can't bill anyone for"
YouShouldKnow,fds8coc,t1_fds60ur,1578696662.0,"After doing a little looking into it, your laws are somewhat misleading, your security guards appear to have a similar level of authority to civilians, only modified by the fact that they have responsibility to the employer. Say if I was a civilian and saw you hitting someone I could legally intervene with a citizens arrest? And a security guard could as well but maybe a security guard could do similar acting in the interest of the property where a civilian would not. But it appears both civilians and security guards have more authority than a regular employee because you have to be licensed as a guard to do that kind of thing for the company. What aweful laws you have."
