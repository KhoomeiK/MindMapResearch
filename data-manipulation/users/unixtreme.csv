What annoys me is the polarisation, I either stomp or I get a 3v2 and have an uphill battle. 

Still I'm just complaining for the shake of complaining, I haven't climbed too high yet (just above 17000) so my win rate is 55% on a bad day  and 65% on a good day (tracking with the api).

Once I climb to face people that don't suck then my teammates also won't suck and the matches will be more difficult, more fair and more fun (and my win rate will dip to 50% or below)."

Additionally, brock at some point has to reload, making him even worse in comparison in terms of raw dps.

The downside of course is that with bea you need to hit two shots in a row to do any damage.

Then he went through trauma, lost his place in life and just gave up. And then, when Thanos returns to end it all, he didn’t give a fuck. He was fat, full of self hatred and doubt, and wasted no time suggesting they walk straight into whatever trap was waiting and kill him properly. Then calls in 2 weapons and goes to work.

Sometimes you aren’t your best. And you don’t want to work. Maybe because of loss. Maybe something else. But people who have a good heart will always do what they can when it matters. He couldn’t have snapped everyone back, but he wanted to. And when someone else did that the right way, he was more than willing to die fighting to protect it.

An entry/mid level programmer doesn't need to know the circumventing technologies, specially on 200+ programmer teams, people just know they take X data and provide Y API or feature and that's it. Sure if you are coding for networking you need to have some idea but you don't need to know everything about everything. 

Don't get me wrong, I know it's generally great to know these things. I've designed and deployed production networks 10g/sas/fc OpenStack private and customer clouds, esxi, windows clusters and so on and all that knowledge is literally useless 360 days a year.
