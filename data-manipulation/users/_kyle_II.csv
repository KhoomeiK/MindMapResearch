college,ffv2ja7,t1_ffv2eq0,1580254192.0,"Yep same, I really struggle with finding the will to write papers, I'd much rather do the more interactive stuff in my degree so if I don't do it now I just procrastinate till 3 hours before"

college,ffuuuhg,t1_ffuroxb,1580249766.0,"I'm not sure, I'm sure its major specific but I've been through 4 semesters and haven't written a paper more then 5 pages. Most campuses also have places you can go for help writing."
college,ffur7y3,t3_evc1cg,1580247798.0,"Well, at least from my experience I definitely glad I started right out of high school. Yes taking a break is nice and a lot of teachers recommend it. I'm currently a junior and I am studying electrical engineering, and I really hate writing papers but I've already taken English comp 1 and 2 and oral communication. To be frank it's not that bad, I think the longest paper I had to write was about 3 pages but I usually have a 2 page paper every other week which isn't to bad. It does depend on your major though, plus I prefer getting the year head start because the sooner you get done then you can focus on your career instead of being a year behind.   

Pro tip: always sit on the front row, or second. I hate sitting in the front but in my experience the teachers will treat you a lot better and be a whole lot more lenient with you if you just sit near the front and somewhat listen."

Citra,ffk13ne,t1_ffk0n0o,1580012591.0,"Np, the main ones are when you go into sett in ng make sure it's in New 3ds mode and make sure to enable CPU JIT. It should be at the top of setting. On my phone it went from 50% speed to 97ish. Right next to the frame rate there should be a percentage. That's the speed of the game, as long as that is 90ish percent you should be good. My s10 runs at 98% and my cpu run almost 100 all the time."
