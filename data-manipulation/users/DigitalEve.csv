If they've written papers about their industry, read them. Find something they've done that you admire or aspire to be and talk about that. 

Bottom line, (most)people generally LOVE talking about themselves. So get them to talk about their work, experience, what they love about their job/industry. 

Find something in common with them no matter how thin and build on that.  When you are reviewing their Linkedin profile or papers they've written or papers written about them....create a psychological profile of this person. 

Learn some basic psychology about 'mirroring' people and how they behave.  

If I like you, I probably will be easier on how I 'grade' you. If you are unlikeable, I will likely 'ding' you for even minor points. 

Don't be 'fake likeable' though. That's is probably worse than just being unlikeable in general. 

Be as sincere as you can about what every it is you have or would like to have in common with the person or persons interviewing you. 

Be prepared. Learn about the company, their product, their mission and values. Take something from their values and mission and tie it into who you are or a past experience where you've demonstrated you share that value. This again ties into liking people who are similar to us, sharing our values etc..

This one packs a beautiful punch. So much said in a single sentence. The beautiful and sincere mind of a child.

'mommy & daddy' sees OP and husband AS mommy and daddy. Doesn't see the ex husband and wife as 'mommy & daddy'. 

'I'm going home!'  - the child doesn't see her bio fathers house as a home. Wanna bet there are reasons for that in her mind that she may not have expressed. Yet

The ex maybe upset by the 'daddy' comment but I'd bet money he's upset by everything else behind that sentence. 

NTA btw. Keep the stability between your daughter and her 'daddy'.  Your ex needs to get over himself and think about the fact that his child is happy, healthy and with people who love her when he's not there."
