BodyDysmorphia,fdcxe3l,t3_ekp0m5,1578287121.0,I know exactly how you feel and I go this this feeling every single day and every single time it triggers me emotionally and causes me to shut down right then and there. It’s awful. Maybe taking some time away from them would be best that’s what I’ve been doing(even though it’s more isolating for me) it helps.
xcxheads,fdcgvux,t1_fd7fpyx,1578274590.0,Break the rules and boom clap I feel like would be best

depression,fcwp2zo,t1_fcwi2g6,1578032229.0,I’ve tried talking to a school counselor but I got I in trouble with my parents because they don’t believe in metal illness so I’m stuck. And I can’t get therapy once again because my parents and I don’t have a car so I can’t take myself. (I’m underage) and I feel awkward around him because he like purposely avoids me and it makes me annoyed because I’m over the situation but him doing that makes it seem like it’s some big deal and I was so heart broken. It also feel like he has some type of sympathy towards me that I don’t need because I have absolutely no feelings for him anymore. It’s annoying and it drives me crazy
depression,fcw6gwl,t1_fctk4v0,1578018251.0,"No there’s no point I’ll be hopeless either way. Like I said no matter what happen something bad will always be right around the corner. I’ve dated someone very nice before and they broke up with me with no explanation. And when I got rejected it was all fluff he was just trying to be nice, and when I see him in person he make sit super awkward. Trust me it won’t be worth it for me."
depression,fcthhsq,t1_fctezfc,1577943442.0,I’ve got broken up with years ago and semi- recently I got rejected(signs to stop trying). I’m still young so I would have to go to college before starting my career but it probably won’t be worth it

depression,fct3hge,t1_fcrik66,1577931909.0,Because I know there will never be anything that will make me happy or content with life. No one will ever love me and I’ll most likely never makes any achievements or start the career I desire.
depression,fcri6i3,t1_fcraw73,1577902138.0,Idk what you mean but I’ll try to explain a bit more. I feel like no matter what I do I’ll will never be fully happy  and one day I’ll eventually kill myself there’s no escape from me taking my own life.
Louisvuitton,fcrhcpe,t1_fcreakh,1577901836.0,Thank you so much!!
