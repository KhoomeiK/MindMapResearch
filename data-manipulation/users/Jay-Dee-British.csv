Mine now know that carbs can be problematic (if you have insulin resistance) and that you can eat yourself INTO insulin resistance if you go HAM on carbs. They now know that the best carbs are from veg, and dairy and that ingredients lists on foods should not read like a chemistry experiment. 

They have the info and it is up to them if they want to use it - they are thin and active but they also know their youth forgives a lot of dietary sins lol.

I'm sorry if I seem overly shocked, I went to school in the UK and they covered all this stuff, including road building - I guess that's communist too as it's paid for by taxes (not even /s as the schools here seem to not be useful in social subjects at all)."

todayilearned,fdm4pvv,t1_fdm3ih3,1578539740.0,"That argument by some people that it's all 'communism' is crazy to me. I mean, why do none of those same people rail against paying taxes for trash pickup, water cleaning (waste and potable), fire service and police? Surely that's 'communist' too by their logic?"

The polio one was a drop of medicine on a sugar cube iirc.  If anyone was going to 'get the autism from vaccines' (seriously have no idea what mental process makes people believe this), it would have been me and my siblings and we are all fine.

I've had others as well, since being a kid, due to extensive travelling to many '3rd world' countries (I'm basically a pincushion at this point)."
