depressed,fd82qql,t3_ek96kt,1578213258.0,I suggested you go to a doctor/therapist because as times go by without treatment it got worse. I took about 6 years to get diagnosed with depression and it fucks my teen life so much because I didnt what it is was before.
depression,fd8286c,t3_ek60m6,1578213043.0,I guess maybe they experience the pain and they don't like people feeling the same pain.

depression,fcwzbag,t1_fcwyzzz,1578044162.0,"My parents knew because I was admitted to the hospital at the beginning of the year of 2019. I was depressed when I was like 14 year old and now Im 20. They knew but they proceed to use ""suicide"" as an attempt to gain self guilt to us. Making us feel bad and it sucks. My siblings doesnt really bother, my bro wasnt at the hospital when I was admitted and my sisters doesnt really know what the reason I was in the hospital. They dont really bother asking too. Im too scared to ask my friend, I sometimes feel ashamed of it. Im glad your parents begin to realised it and help you. Maybe I just need to pulled through all this."
