TwoXChromosomes,fedakt1,t3_eok6os,1579005777.0,"All I see is strength in your story. You say you used to stand for women. But right now you're standing for yourself and your daughters in the most powerful way imaginable. You say you used to be strong. But right now you're facing an uncertain future with vulnerability and courage. 
Your daughter clings to you because you are still the rock she knows you to be. You will show her who she is - a daughter of strength. 

Congratulations on the steps you've made. Don't beat yourself up for the steps you have yet to take. Just keep stepping. 

So happy for you and your precious family. Be safe."

I'm reading the book Mindf*ck about the creation and downfall of Cambridge Analytica. They created software to identify these traits in Facebook users. Research demonstrates that if they have enough data, they can understand your personality better than you or your closest friends. They can deanonomize the data. The purpose is to select individuals with narcissistic traits and move the needle on their behavior by exposing them to bias posts. After CA developed them, these techniques were picked up by governments, political groups, and other companies. The book explains it way better than I can."
