If it's a great deal and something you want then do it yourself if you can.   There's so many layers of issues with what your girlfriend did.   Maybe she doesnt want the apartment and shes putting it off, plus she said she would do it and didn't, then ignored you."
relationship_advice,ffc2wi5,t3_estv80,1579790198.0,"Just go with the flow and don't demand an answer.  Things seem good now, maybe he's scared a conversation about it might make it weird.  Just enjoy your time before you leave."

It would be different if she stole the idea and used it before the wedding, but she didn't.  You said it was a blast when you did it so just go with the flow and have a great time."

Next event wear the same dress you did that time somebody asked if you had worn it before...  making it three times.  Lay it out at least a week prior to the event so your husband sees it.  When he asks let him know you will also be politely declining the hair appt as well.   Oh and you'll be wearing the same shoes and accessories as well. 

If he says anything let him know you absolutely cant afford it. And if he wants you to keep up appearances to the tune of $1200 a month you will gladly stop paying all household bills to afford this luxury.  Unless he would like to stop being a douche and help you out. 

And if he disagrees you wear that dress with pride each and every time.  And if somebody is rude enough to ask if you've worn it before you tell them, ""Yes, I absolutely love this dress""

He'll come around"

relationship_advice,ff6q8nw,t1_ff62368,1579632612.0,"Right, I understand you're worried that it may become more.   I would cross that bridge when you get there.  At this point if it brings him happiness it's really not hurting anybody.  But keep an eye on it"
relationship_advice,ff5vw67,t3_erucvq,1579612031.0,"As I was reading this I thought, ""$100 per month for your dads happiness is not a lot of money""...   even though we both know it's a scan, its something that is giving him something to look forward to. It's not like he's a teenage boy who is going to realize it's a scam and move out and on with his life...   he is probably stuck in the place till he passes away. 

If it really is just $100 a month i would let it go.  Think of her as like a $25/week therapist that keeps his hopes up."

It's his child because he loves him.  You don't have to be genetically related to be family.  You should definitely leave him, he deserves better."
tifu,ff2w1zr,t1_ff2jogm,1579526331.0,"Okay then that makes more sense.  I honestly thought you were trolling.

I still think writing down a schedule helps immensely.  Your baby and her needs will change as time goes on, and having a piece of paper to look at, add notes to, and edit is a huge help."
tifu,ff1yule,t3_er6wst,1579489349.0,Ummm....  if this is even true you need to write down a schedule for your baby and make sure she is getting fed.

Yes, pregnancy can suck but it doesn't give you the right to treat anybody that poorly.  You sound emotionally abusive and I hope he does move on because it doesnt sound like you've done anything to change.

You should seek counseling."

Frankly it's weird he is so caught up in it.  

So what you do is for the next couple of weeks say please please please PLEASE!!!! before every sentence whether you want something or not.   And thank you thank you THANK YOU THANK YOU after every sentence.   

He will be so annoyed with you he should drop it."
relationship_advice,fetiiy1,t3_eqkrkn,1579375798.0,"Yeah she's gross.  I mean, she is looking at them as she is closing the cover....  can't say she actually forgets.  

Start taking a shit on top of the cover whenever she does it.  See if that changes anything."
relationship_advice,fervm25,t1_ferne3q,1579358808.0,"Alright well I was just curious about that, but to answer your question this relationship can absolutely not be fixed.  He has taken it way too far and has become abusive.   Those things only go one way and that's down hill.  

While what you did want nice or right, nothing warrants abuse."

I think you both have a reason to feel a certain way.  As a mom, you were probably the most important text of the day.  As the hours went on she was probably starting to get hurt.  She didn't realize you were going to call. 

You had every intention of calling her and waited for her to be home and available.   You meant no harm.  

No assholes here"

relationship_advice,fedd1s4,t3_eol5ml,1579008061.0,Tell them asap.   There's no way you'll be able to go to the wedding.  Waiting will just prolong the inevitable and they will be mad you didn't tell them sooner.

relationship_advice,feae78e,t3_eo9p60,1578947534.0,"You need to do what's right for you.   If your family is aware of what she is doing (because that's part of my advice is to make sure her parents and/or family is aware of her behavior before she dies)...   then you need to stay away.  

I give you credit for being true to yourself so far and not following her. Hanging with her could eventually catch up to you, as in being in a car with her when she has drugs, being around the wrong people...   I know somebody that got the date rape drug slipped in her drink as a ""joke"" when she hung out with her older trashy sisters friends.  

You have to make sure you and your future are safe.  And that's by keeping her at a distance until she cleans up her act."
relationship_advice,feacq5m,t1_feaa1vx,1578947084.0,"Cool thanks for your input!

And she's really only fighting fire with fire.   The other girl is immature and petty (and thirsty)...   nothing wrong with thanking her for her service all while letting the world know your man made it back... safe and sound to your arms."
relationship_advice,feacglz,t1_fea6o03,1578946982.0,"And there is no way anything is going on between them (even though she may wish there was)...   because he would never have ""let"" her post that picture if he had anything to hide.  Ever. 

So when friends and family get in your head about it just blow it off and remind them that your relationship is strong and you're not threatened, but thanks."
relationship_advice,fea6gck,t1_fea69o6,1578944894.0,And then drop it....   but def let me know if she comments LOL
