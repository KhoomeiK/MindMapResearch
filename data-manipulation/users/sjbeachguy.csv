Synthetic oil is supposed to be less prone to sludge.  I don’t see how what I am proposing would really adversely effect the engine. It’s in a constant state of new oil being added.

Still better than changing ALL the oil at 10,000 then adding a qt every 2000.  I’d like to see the true “sludge” value of the oil  doing it my suggested way.  I never did it, I traded in the cars, one for a 2016 Prius and one for a 2015 VW TDi wagon.

Toyota acceptable burn rate is 1qt/2000 miles.  Which means you never really need an oil change.  Just change the oil filter every 10,000 miles since you’ll put in 5 qts in that time, more oil than the engine holds.  You are always adding fresh oil anyway so why bother dumping it all and adding new? Seems foolish."
