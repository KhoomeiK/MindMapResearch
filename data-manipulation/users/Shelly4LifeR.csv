raisedbynarcissists,ff9d7tv,t3_es2xzm,1579710427.0,Feel like that all the time.  I'm still having a hard time learning it wasn't my fault.
Dogfree,ff6b74c,t1_ff5t4al,1579623366.0,"no, they said to call the non emergancy line if it happens again.  Unless the dog is attacking me or my cats I'm not allowed to do anything."
depression,ff4swz2,t3_ererwo,1579571670.0,"I agree with this post.  I get so tired of hearing just take it one day at a time, or tomorrow is another day and it might be better."
Dogfree,ff43ww4,t1_ff41cgs,1579554990.0,The dog was thankfully gone when I went outside.  It knocked a panel down and the panel is now frozen to the ground.  I'm looking around to see if I have anything to block it in the mean time.  I'll probably have to call like you said the non-emergency number if it gets in the yard again.  I think the dog belongs to my neighbors but they are dog nutters.  Their dogs do no wrong and can go wherever they want too.
depression,feyvyy7,t3_eqs4h8,1579451112.0,"I hate hearing this too.  And it isn't normally true.  I've been depressed since childhood and it seems to stay the same or get worse.  Unfortunately some of my depression is from physical problems.  Including chronic pain, that never goes away.  And those problems I am told will get worse with age.  So yeah, my depression is never going to stay away."
Dogfree,fevmi2m,t1_fevklcf,1579399110.0,I'll have to look!  Thank you for the suggestion!
depression,fenpltx,t3_epym4o,1579288997.0,Happy belated birthday!
Dogfree,fcxuq3o,t1_fcwfont,1578070681.0,I know.  As a young child we learn from them so to say something like that.
Dogfree,fcxtbic,t1_fcw7syw,1578070105.0,Yeah my uncle is odd about things.  His dogs can do no wrong.  I really thought they wanted to eat me.
Dogfree,fch13go,t1_fcgg9l6,1577646204.0,>The sad thing is that dog was a really well behaved puppy that I did use to play with.  I don't know if it was the owners or if dogs just turn after a certain age.
Dogfree,fch07gv,t1_fcgl5pw,1577645897.0,Yeah I didn't get it either.  Thankfully the cuts didn't get infected.
disability,fc9qswe,t3_egk9us,1577556804.0,"My family does the same thing.  You're always in pain so why can't you do this or that anyway?  Um because sometimes the pain is worse than others.

Edit:  Good for you to still do something you love despite the pain!  They should be proud of you."
raisedbynarcissists,fc71twl,t3_egdps7,1577495287.0,Yes!  Having a cold was horrible because coughing was a no-no.
raisedbynarcissists,fc58a8q,t3_efzywu,1577448289.0,"Yes, my mom did the same thing.  Should I walk past her room without saying hi or should I say hi.  If I didn't say hi she'd get mad at me for not saying hi.  If I did say hi I was up to something."
raisedbynarcissists,fc45ooz,t3_efvfa8,1577407301.0,yes.
raisedbynarcissists,fc2vtv0,t1_fc1u55j,1577375395.0,thank you.  I was worried I was just being to dramatic.
raisedbynarcissists,fbl4t2c,t1_fbhk1l1,1576958454.0,I'm at the point were I might get a lock on my door with a key.  But I think he'd just take the door knob off if I do.  He also thinks he can use my stuff.  No boundaries at all.
