If it's on drywall, you'll need to perforate the paint. They sell many versions of the paper tiger that are designed for this. Assuming the wallpaper was properly hung, you should be able to soak it off.

Try about a 2 ft section of wall. Perforate, soak, scrape. For the soak, I used warm water with a splash of vinegar (mostly for smell, I don't like paste smell) and a large sponge. You want the sponge almost dripping wet, water should run down the wall a bit when you wipe on. Soak the area, wait 5 minutes, soak again. Repeat until you see some separation of wallpaper, then scrape with a 4 inch floor scraper. This should leave some glue and maybe some paper fiber. Soak and scrape the residue, then wipe with clean water.

I found, for my place, that water worked as well as anything else including steam. Doing a 12x12 room, by the time I finished soaking all the walls, it was time to start another soaking. I didn't have paint over mine, but I did have 5+ layers of wallpaper.
