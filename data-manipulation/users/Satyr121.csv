Casters are much weaker in 1e in that they can't make concentration saves and damage just means instant death, that's the only way we were able to survive.  I almost got killed because one of them cast heat metal on my Armour and I wasn't able to address it until it was too late.

There is also the case of ""why am I paying for you to go have sex?"" (this applies to men or women getting birth control).  I know that it wouldn't be a huge amount of my taxes but this goes into the whole sex if a fun luxury and not required.

These are the reasons I have mixed emotions."

1.  When people are out having sex yes they should practice safe sex and therefore we should make it more accessible and birth control shouldn't be taxed.
2.  Sex isn't necessary it's actually closer to what I would consider a luxury.  Therefore birth control should be taxed."

ShitAmericansSay,ff247ej,t1_ff22v0e,1579493345.0,"No way it's definite satire.  I though I commented on that earlier but I guess the comment never went through.  I've had crappy internet today.

Like I said I've not gotten to experience another country so I do believe the video has points in the fact that we aren't the worst, but I'm open to the fact that somewhere may be better.

Gosh I really don't agree with free Healthcare, that teachers should make the same as engineers, or with very high taxes.
That being said I don't have a problem with other countries trying it and I hope that it works.

If it works in the long term then it's probably worth considering.

I definitely want to travel elsewhere and maybe live elsewhere one day.  I love outdoor activities like mountain biking and hiking and so many place outside the US have great ones.  Plus the chance to meet people who don't share almost the exact same life as I have would be great."

Not trying to get into a debate or to catch you in your own words.  I really want your opinion on this.  1.  Could you give some examples of the countries that you are talking about?  2. Why is that country better than America?  3.  What issues does said country have and why are those issues better than America's issues?  4.  Is this based off of personal experience?  Did you live in the U.S. ever and have you lived in said country ever?

Like I said.  Not trying it make an argument I just am curious.  Also feel free to answer with as much or as little detail as desired as well as only answer the questions that you wish.

Thanks for your time and thoughts!"

ShitAmericansSay,fezwu1z,t1_feztqdm,1579462699.0,"As in what subreddit I'm in.  I'm in a subreddit that mocks what Americans say.  I've found some of it quite humourous really.  I definitely don't feel like I've done anything wrong by commenting on the fact that I disagree with a statement that is mocking America when I presented my comment in a way that feels like it was calm and shouldn't be triggering anyone.  All I wanted to do was state my opinion on the issue and try to better understand yours.

TLDR yes I see the humor in my making these comments in a subreddit that makes fun of things it finds dumb about America.

ShitAmericansSay,fezk2qn,t1_fegb63e,1579458174.0,"One could argue that more guns and arming guards would be an effective way to lower the chance of most of them happening, or at least having an armed and trained population.  Not saying that this is the best solution, but it's a solution that wouldn't get rid of our freedom to protect ourselves.  As for the jingoistic I can see where that mindset comes from.  As there have been conflicts that we have been involved with in the past that weren't necessary, but if you are referring to the iran conflict it was an attack on our embassy which is U.S. Soil.  So while we made not have handled our response in the best way we didn't do something wrong by responding."

DnD5e,fej89ht,t3_ep7kpb,1579161144.0,"I know it already exist but a decanter of endless water is pretty sick.  I had it in a short campaign during which my and another player were fighting vecna with the help of anubis (really we were just trying not to be killed by vecnas mooks).  I got surrounded so I used the geyser option to rocket jump away.  Also during this battle vecna had both his hand and his eye.  I decided since those gave him power that I would knock his hand off with the geyser.  After reading the rules the dm let me due to creativity then promptly has vecna power word kill me.  Totally worth it!  (plus in the end anubis revived me).
