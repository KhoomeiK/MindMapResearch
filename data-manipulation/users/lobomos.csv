Anyone can charge you 'high-end' prices but still sell you out of spec cables. They don't have any visible differences or labeling generally. Amazon basics are cheap and not 'high-end' but they are the proper standard and fixed mine when it had these issues. Barring that you may need an active adapter to drive them.

If you swap the cords/connections from the one that runs at 60hz to the one that runs at 30hz and vice versa, does that swap the refresh rates between them?

If it's an option, I would probably just swap to displayport cables personally."

AskComputerScience,ff14dz6,t3_er33e8,1579475111.0,"For 4, I think you would need to use breadth/depth-first search. This may not be possible though on larger boards. Could also use dynamic programming and split it down into easier sub-problems that you could piece together. This link explains possible algorithms:  [https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/hamiltonian-path/tutorial/](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/hamiltonian-path/tutorial/)

In your example problem on the 10x10 grid for example: starting at 1,1 you know that you have to end at 2, 100, or 8 so those would be where you would check from next. So from 2 you would get 3, 82, 7, 59 as your next valid points to check from. Any time you jump off the board or visit something you've already visited, you can prune that section and move on to your next search point.

For 5, I think this would also be dynamic programming.  I would do something like this. Check for a linear goal, if you have one then you're done. If not keep count of the least number of players in your way. From here, we want to split the left and right sides at the middle. You're going to check from the middle of each side towards the goal so you only have to account for a single bounce.  Then we want to split it again and repeat but stopping where we previously started.  Then keep working your way back until you hit a gap where your bounces will always hit a player. I don't really know what the math on that would be though."

NetTV appears to be an actual company that implements this so however they’re doing it is probably proprietary but: I don’t think the bandwidth packages they offer would even come close to being able to handle all of the channel data being streamed all of the time, it would be feasible to only provide a stream for the channel you have requested and use your actual internet connection to get the data, you could test for this by maxing our bandwidth on computer and seeing if tv signal degrades. I’d imagine you have to register your TVs since they have a cap on how many you can have, in that case, that device could have its own dedicated bandwidth. If they are actually using fiber I believe you can also push multiple streams over a single fiber cable using different wavelengths of light, this probably could actually handle all of the channel data but in that case I’d expect higher bandwidth internet too. These are just my speculation on possibilities though and a real answer should be interesting."
