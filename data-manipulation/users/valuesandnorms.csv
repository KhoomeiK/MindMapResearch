I’d love to dig deeper into the numbers.  How many went to temp agencies after rather than permanent positions?  How many are in recovery and did they get any extra support?  How many have criminal records and what sort of convictions do they have?  In my experience employers like to pat themselves on the back about how they love to hire people with criminal records but when you ask them what records they accept it turns out it barely above traffic tickets.  

I used to help “returning citizens” find jobs and employers would perk up when I asked about hiring people with criminal convictions but them say they didn’t want anyone with violent or drug related convictions which is pretty damn hard to find for people who have been in and out of jail a lot.  And forget about people with CSC’s.  we seem to hope they just live off food stamps and section 8 than get a job and support themselves.  

 Not saying that there aren’t a number of professions that particular convictions should be an automatic disqualification.  But employers are often over zealous.

I hope this didn’t come across as too negative, I do love this program"
