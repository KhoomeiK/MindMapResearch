WTH is Light Salt?

""50% less Sodium""?

Couldn't you just,  I don't know, add less *regular* salt?"
HGTV,ffwr0v3,t3_eqm6n5,1580308919.0,"Brian Patrick Flynn is a terrible ""designer"" who apparently gets all his ideas from browsing Instagram. 

He also seems to think the sole purpose of a home is to host parties. 

He also doesn't grasp the concept that a garage is a place most people want to use to store their car. 

It's not a 4th dining room, or TV lounge, or pool hall, or sex dungeon. IT'S A FREAKING GARAGE!"

It’s also dumb because Trump’s mom was a skank well below his standards. Now if the sign said “daughter fucker” then it would be more believable."

3Dprinting,ff87qu8,t1_ff80dq9,1579668415.0,"Since he works there I doubt he would give an unbiased opinion. I have owned many tools from multiple brands over the years. In my opinion Black and Decker tools are poor quality. A few have literally been worthless (the battery powered “chainsaw” I got on sale could not cut through a 1” branch)
Their home appliances are also not worth the money as they just license their brand name and don’t actually have anything to do with the product beyond that. 
Sadly Stanley took over a controlling interest in the company and most of their other brands have dropped in quality as well."

DesignPorn,ff382xi,t3_ercvho,1579535912.0,"The material all those building are attached to seems *extremely* thin.  I would imagine a real life version would flex like crazy. All those building on the curve are going to snap off and eventually the whole thing will break.

It looks cool but is completely impractical.

I would either cut off the cantilevered section or make the base the same length as the top. Then enclose it all in plexiglas (or glass). That would add structural integrity AND stop most of the issues others have mentioned (dust, pets, kids)

It will still look cool and be functional too."
GeometryIsNeat,ff2us5m,t1_ff2u2w9,1579524984.0,If you have creative cloud then AE would be included. Someone described it as “Photoshop over time”. It does some things differently (masks are created from the layer above the thing you want masked for example) but it isn’t too hard to learn the basics. You can import native illustrator files so you can reuse what you already have drawn.

Eldar,fezfasy,t3_eqv3xd,1579456748.0,You spent more effort on the top one so it’s hard to compare accurately. That said I prefer the top one but I would make all the black parts the same bone color. If you want three colors maybe make the bottom and stock “bulbs” the same yellow as the helmet.

LearnUselessTalents,fesczos,t1_fes948i,1579363982.0,Good advice. I would add that it helps if you try to think about “aiming” the flow of air. Try to blow up towards your nose then shift down towards your chin. You should find positions where the whistle sound is more distinct.
