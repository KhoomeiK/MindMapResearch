todayilearned,ffk1fly,t1_ffjjjc3,1580012876.0,No term limits create a state within a state.
todayilearned,ffj8xne,t1_ffj4z69,1579993244.0,That part is also true. We need to disestablish the uniparty and keep lobbyists away from DC.
todayilearned,ffj8r40,t1_ffj7rfy,1579993129.0,"Apples to oranges. Other democracies are quite different culturally, economically, and demographically. In the American case, term limits should be a no-brainer. Presidents have term limits, the same should apply to Congress and Senate. Otherwise you end up with corrupt and feckless ""legislators"" who neglect their constituents and get nothing done."
todayilearned,ffj3l6h,t3_etvx4v,1579989516.0,"That rule needs to change. There are way too many ""career"" politicians who sit in Congress and Senate for decades without accomplishing anything meaningful."
todayilearned,fffx1kh,t3_et75yh,1579893672.0,"Freud was a fraud and a sexual predator as well. His entire ""psychoanalysis"" theory was just a way to get rich off naive upper class ""patients""."
todayilearned,ffedbq8,t1_ffecp01,1579843859.0,He was kinda trying to survive though...
todayilearned,ffe9pht,t1_ffd1fed,1579840587.0,"Yup, that sucked for him too. Maybe he would have gotten Onoda's deal had he opted to go to Japan instead of Taiwan once he finally surrendered. Or maybe Japan would have sent him back to his island quietly. Who knows? It's still unfair that Japanese authorities honored Onoda and gave Nakamura chump change. If anything, Nakamura's refusal to surrender is even more impressive as far as loyalty is concerned. Not only was he Taiwanese with no connection to Japan whatsoever, he didn't even speak the language or know anything about Japan until the Japanese came to his country. 

At least part of the Japanese public saw his case for what it was, and demanded the Japanese government of the time treat him better considering he fought 30+ years for their country."
todayilearned,ffe9761,t1_ffcgrmo,1579840164.0,"Personally I don't think Onoda acted in bad faith, during his almost 30 years of ""fighting"" a war that had already been over. He did do what you say he did, that is beyond dispute. He was however under the impression that the war was still going, and he had to survive in order to keep on fighting. Maybe he was too ideologically driven to see the many signs that the war had ended for quite some time, or maybe he chose not to believe it due to extreme paranoia, hard to tell. 

His hero's welcome was in part to celebrate Japanese time-honored virtues of courage and loyalty. Certainly what Onoda did after the war (killing unsuspecting villagers to steal their food) was not very heroic or honourable in retrospect."
todayilearned,ffcagja,t1_ffbzryg,1579795203.0,At least he got a hero's welcome and a generous pension when he returned to Japan. The other famous holdout Teruo Nakamura didn't even get that. Poor guy was indigenous Taiwanese and when he returned to Taiwan in 1975 was seen by many as an enemy combatant.
politics,ff9crnc,t1_ff92pz4,1579710088.0,"Dems have been acting in bad faith since Trump announced his candidacy. I don't blame him for being uncooperative, and I hope he takes a tougher stance against political corruption in Washington next term. Now go take a chill pill and enjoy the ride."
politics,ff8oufp,t1_ff89rh8,1579689468.0,"Trial? This is political intrigue, not a trial. Congress voted to impeach on hearsay, and Senate will vote against impeachement because everybody who is not suffering from tds sees this clown act for what it is. Expect to see a lot of 53-47."

todayilearned,ff6iw7r,t1_ff6hmw0,1579628163.0,"Crassus was certainly the richest before and during the First Triumvirate. After that, Caesar made a fortune through various means and left 3/4 of it to Augustus. Once Egypt was added to the pile, the same Augustus ran it as a private fief and the Senate had no choice but to let him get away with it. In theory, that would make Augustus the richest person ever, beating Mansa Musa, Rockefeller, and Fugger just to name a few. Most of his wealth was not liquid though, so make of it what you will."

As for college, the only fields that I can agree should be subsidized are those fields where talent is sorely needed. Most of humanities and social sciences would not be useful to the country's economy."
