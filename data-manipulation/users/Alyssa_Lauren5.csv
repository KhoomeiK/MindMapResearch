I was a kid about 7/8- walking out of the doors at the mall with my parents as he was walking in with a small group of people. My dad was so pumped he asked him for his autograph.  Steven Tyler was really nice, talked with us for a minute and signed my baby brother’s onesie and my t-shirt. I’m sure my mom has both saved somewhere."

AskReddit,fgeu2e2,t3_ey2bd0,1580710018.0,"My grandpa was a fireman. Told me a story about two young kids in a mustang convertible that speeding past his fire station one day. Kids lost control of the car and wrecked into a wooden telephone pole. (This was in Ohio where everything is older and above ground at the time.) No seatbelts caused one kid to hit the pole face first so hard some of his front teeth ripped out of his head and stuck in the wood. He said the other kid was in such bad shape his brain was in pieces on the road. Obviously neither kid made it out alive. So awful. As a kid, it freaked me out so bad that I’m 33 now and I can still hear him telling me about it in my head. Speed kills. Literally."

She’s very upset she has to stay home and rest so she doesn’t split her stitches. I’m not sure the cheese she gets makes up for it though. She’s a grudge holder.
