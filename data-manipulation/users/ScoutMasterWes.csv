Second, this song is BUMPING AS FUCK holy shit this is exactly my taste in music. Is this genre something you listen to often? Because if so I would love some more recommends from you!"

happy,fdoj42l,t1_fdoiyx4,1578606180.0,They didnt hurt the entire time! They were definitely sore whenever the ortho would tighten them but it wasnt so bad for me that I'd lose sleep thankfully

happy,fdogys6,t1_fdogewt,1578604941.0,"Sure you can ask! 3 years were when I was super duper young and they tried moving my teeth around before I had all my adult teeth, and that did not work at all. I got braces again when I was a bit older (pictured), and it still took a while then since I moved off to college and could only visit the orthodontist a few times a year for adjustments. We didnt switch to an orthodontist near my school because it was too expensive to switch."
happy,fdogn24,t1_fdogcee,1578604755.0,"No it's ok! Basically they took before and after photos of me. The picture that I posted only has the before image on it, but the after one is there too. The final ceph (although I dont know what ceph means) was just the time stamp on the picture they took when they removed my braces. It's ok to ask questions!"
happy,fdog80c,t1_fdog4kk,1578604512.0,"The page they printed had both pictures of me before and after on it, so the final 2020 one was the one they took that day"
