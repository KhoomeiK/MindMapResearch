AmItheAsshole,fcj0zv6,t3_ehf4fk,1577674585.0,"I'm a bit confused. As someone sho spends way too much money on makeup, most of my palletes have plastic cases that wouldn't let juicer in unless its sitting there forever and seeps in. The ones that aren't, if closed would all mostly be fine. I guess I don't understand how they were all ruined, unless left open and even then if they're stacked up how did they all get ruined, were they sitting in a puddle for a while? 

Makeup isn't cheap at all. But I also didn't have any sort of income at 14 to spend a grand on anything, let alone makeup.

Shit situation all around but I need more info."
