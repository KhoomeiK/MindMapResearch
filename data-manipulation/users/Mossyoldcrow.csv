science,fejkkun,t1_fejiu3v,1579178016.0,There’s an app called headspace that has free beginner courses to walk you through the basics. Don’t pay after that though. The basics are all you really need to know.
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdrfn0m,t1_fdr799n,1578683855.0,"It’s all about dosage probably. I didn’t try shrooms until after I’d taken acid several times on 250-300 ug and only had 1.5-2 grams. So it seemed very gentle and friendly in comparison. Also different times in my life. For most of my early acid trips, I was at my bf’s apartment with his roommates that we didn’t really like hanging around. When I took shrooms later in life I was married and we had our own place. Much more chill. Idk why but I’ve thrown up coming up on lsd 3 times and didn’t feel nauseous at all the times I’ve taken shrooms. 
The shorter duration is the biggest reason I’d recommend shrooms for a first timer with anxiety cause honestly? You can’t control what’s gonna give you anxiety when you have this disorder, and there’s an equal chance (shrooms/lsd) in my eyes for a bad trip for an anxious person for that very reason. So if it does turn out to be a bad trip and you can’t stop it or turn it around, then better to suffer for 6 hours rather than 12. I had a bad trip on lsd and spent 12 hours tensed up in a corner. Had muscle spasms for days afterwards."
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdqiwjs,t3_empe2n,1578667781.0,"I have generalized anxiety disorder and have tripped 20+ times now on lsd and a couple times on shrooms. I’d recommend shrooms over lsd any day for a first time experience, very gentle. But I’d say you’ll be fine either way. Just make sure you are in a safe environment with someone you trust, and make sure nothing sudden or unexpected may turn your trip—so no unexpected visitors, maybe turn your phone off and tell people you know some excuse so they won’t try to contact you out of the blue. There will be times that you want it to stop, like, just for a fucking SECOND. But it’s like a rollercoaster, you can’t just get off. Resolve yourself to that and write a reminder somewhere that you can always see (I write with sharpie on my arm) that you are okay, this WILL end, you WILL feel normal again, and you AREN’T dying even if it feels that way. Make sure you have some tasty snacks on hand (fruits, nuts, and other “natural” snacks recommended), PLENTY of water, and some nice pillows/blankets. Make a good relaxing playlist beforehand of music you absolutely LOVE. An animated feel good movie is great to watch while you’re coming up. Just know that you will not be in control. You can either stress about that the whole trip or accept it and have fun. Explore your surroundings to your comfort level and be weird. Lsd is weird and freeing. You’ll see. If you feel panicked at any point and need guidance, you can message me."
