HytaleInfo,ffqh3rp,t1_ffq9g3f,1580134416.0,"When making the suggestion I actually thought of slime-morphs. But later decided that it wouldn't really fit my vision. Slimes are mindless blobs (except for Omega Slime) and are meant to be looked at more like wild animals than intelligent monsters.

I think that other mobs could fit this role better, f.e. doppler, polimorph, shapeshifter, etc."
HytaleInfo,ffq7ag0,t3_eullrl,1580124269.0,Ahh yes. I'm going to make more suggestions. But I thought that suggestions in here get heavily downvoted.
hytalesuggestions,ffq1dpc,t1_ffoim1z,1580115051.0,"I tried to create Slimes in Craftstudio. And I think simple cubes work the best for animating. When a Slime jumps it could flatten and when it slides it could elongate, etc. It feels like jelly. With more complex shapes those animations don't look as smooth. 

As for brewing. Yeah, that could work. I was just giving examples of what you could make. I'm going to make few more posts as I will try to mod them to Hytale when it releases."

HytaleInfo,ffmzfsp,t3_eu9p7z,1580060451.0,"In their FAQ it's stated that Hytale will in no way be connected to their Minecraft Hypixel Server. 

They are 2 different games. They are worked on by 2 different teams. The games are written in different languages."
HytaleInfo,ffmgkv1,t1_ffmg3xq,1580054351.0,Yeah. I'm okay if there would be some gamerule like in Minecraft.
HytaleInfo,ffmftam,t3_eu7pdf,1580054086.0,As an adventurer it seems very cool. But as a builder I'd hate it. There would need to be glass and reinforced glass just for the sake of building buildings that'll last.
dataisbeautiful,ffm91f8,t1_ffm46yh,1580050693.0,"Yeah I was using Polish studies, as I am Polish.

Main points of the studies are:

- Over 1/5 of Polish Gen Z declares themselves as right winged

- Gen Z support leaving the EU twice as likely as rest of society

- Gen Z are more religious and have better opinion of church than Millenials (Church is hated by most of Polish society).

- Most of Gen Z declare that if their job was good, they could do it for their entire lives.

- Most of Gen Z claim to rather have a little less paying job that is closer to home. 

- Gen Z are less likely to travel.

Depending on studies some claim that Gen Z are everyone born after 1995 and some claim everyone born after 2005. Also Polish right-wing might be different from American right-wing."
dataisbeautiful,fflye18,t1_fflwqdf,1580045715.0,"It will be interesting to see in a few years as studies show that Gen Z are more conservative than Millenials. 

Also typical left and right around the world have very different views on economy. That's one of the reasons why in other countries people don't use the words left and right."
gaming,fflmwki,t1_fflk5jp,1580041581.0,"You know. If everyone was like you, then psychology wouldn't exist.

Even if we can just change the control schemes if we want to in pretty much every modern game. There is a reason why some people prefer certain control schemes. And there is a reason why some are more common than others.

You don't have to justify or explain why you prefer certain scheme. But that knowledge may become important to psychologists and game developers in the future."
gaming,fflhxwo,t1_ffl3ah9,1580039923.0,"There is logic to both.

Default - Think of how mouse and cursor work. You push the mouse forward, the cursor goes up. You push it left, the cursor goes left too. Now in the games by that logic. If you push mouse forward then the crosshair should go up. There isn't some media for you to control the character. You are the character.

Inverted Y axis - Imagine that the thumbstick is a head on a neck. You push it forward, the head goes down but when you push it left then the head only tilts. Now when playing games imagine you are placing hand on top of characters head. Thumbsticks and mouses don't have any rotation. So left/right tilting must be used for rotating the head.

Inverted Y and X axis - Imagine you are behind the camera. You must push the back of camera down to look up, or left to look right. When you are playing games imagine that character has a stick at the back of his head. And you are grabbing just that stick.

Inverted X axis - Imagine that the screen is a mirror. When you look up, your reflection also looks up. But when you look to your left, your reflection looks to their right. This is the least common of all the playstyles."
gaming,ffleoou,t1_ffl4odi,1580038735.0,"Depends.

The inverted gang is having a camera behind a character. Or are grabbing the character's head.

But the default gang are playing as the character directly.

gaming,fflaonu,t1_ffl5ej3,1580037194.0,"If I had a stick in the back of my head. And I pushed it right, my head would go left and vice versa.

[https://imgur.com/yvgNiFE](https://imgur.com/yvgNiFE) 

If you imagine the stick as your neck, then the tilting argument would work. But then Y wouldn't be inverted.

The only time your argument would make sense is if the stick is directly on top of the head."
HytaleInfo,ffjidbg,t1_ffjho5c,1579998884.0,"Yeah, Devs said they are sorry for the misconception their concept art brought. The zones aren't going to be separated into rings. Think of those as of biome clusters. 

As for difficulty. In the last blogpost they said Zones 1, 2, 3 are going to have the same difficulty and maybe you'll start in any of those."
minecraftsuggestions,ffj6t5p,t1_ffivpit,1579991840.0,"The old mobs have very inconsistent in-game resolution and body parts. Compare bat to ghast. 

While the newer mobs are more consistent. Look at the ravager and parrots (one pixel on a parrots is about the same size as one pixel on ravager). Also newer mobs have better models, animations, more variations. 

Jappa has officialy said that he will release all the new mobs consistent with each other. But he won't change the old mobs."
