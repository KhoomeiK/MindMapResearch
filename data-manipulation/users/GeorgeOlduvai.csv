On the front on the grip, is it a small piece (as above) or a full length sort of deal?

I found myself here through various subreddits and my own ideology (for lack of a better term).

Is there a reason they're not common on modern pistols? Customer dissatisfaction or ergonomics?"
progun,ffkqicz,t1_ffkpwwj,1580027120.0,"A fair point. My bad, I should have specified. I've heard of Dragons Breath and seen video of said rounds. I wasn't aware that incendiary rounds were a thing for anything beyond spectacle. I suppose I should have worked the logic through to conclusion. 

Thank you for the information and education."
progun,ffkpgw3,t1_ffkg6y8,1580026617.0,"I was reasonably certain it was a safety. I asked because I wasn't sure. I don't own any guns, have never fired one. I think they're, from a physics stand point, downright cool.

I know just enough about guns to be a fan; I believe in the 2A (despite being non-American). I ask questions because I'm curious and wish to expand my knowledge.

I'd heard about grip safeties, I just wasn't certain how that might work in practice. I thought it might be a grip strength thing (from the sides, as it were). 

I do have one further question: ""jw"" = Jesus wept?

My apologies for intruding."
