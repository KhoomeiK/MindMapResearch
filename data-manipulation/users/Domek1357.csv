depression,ff5zwsu,t3_erqjbv,1579615502.0,"I've been thinking about something like that for over a year now, and the fact that I ride a motorcycle makes it even more real. Sometimes I just want to get hit by a car and get injured and have a 2 to 3 months recovery, see who would care, see if some people would even notice that I've been gone, take a break and after all of that get my shit together."
depression,fej4z1a,t3_epflwr,1579157104.0,"I'm on SSRI's for 5 months now and they did help me, but I wouldn't say they make you mentally numb what could happen is that you worry less about the consequences (for example you didn't do something you had to do). That's just my personal opinion on them so."
depression,fdjz6sr,t3_elqwy9,1578491977.0,"For me for the biggest part is the people that I trusted used and hurt me, then some friends abandoned me so I feel lonely all the time, also anxiety that it created doesn't allow me make new friends or relationships, to finish my childhood caused abandoned issues."
depression,fddtuxd,t3_ekpvdz,1578323835.0,"I miss that feeling so much it's all I want, just that one person to cuddle with or even a hug."
Anxiety,fcq29ly,t3_eih8ty,1577877178.0,"Yep, almost always when I'm with group of friends or any group I feel like I might fit but don't belong there and just stand there like there would be no difference if I leave."
