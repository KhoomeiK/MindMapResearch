VeryCavallari,ffhmhrk,t1_ffgsrvf,1579942378.0,I have to skip all of their interactions. It's too cringy to watch
VeryCavallari,ffhm996,t3_esxf4g,1579942025.0,"No but she told everyone and their mom that she ""might be pregnant."" What grown ass woman runs around telling everyone she might be pregnant before she bothers taking a test? I seriously can't stand her and her storyline."
Onision,ff62v07,t1_ff4hlxj,1579617744.0,Seriously. I really don't get that mentality. Of anything it proves he's more concerned with his own well being than his daughters life. Something really messed up was going on there.
Onision,ff5n2tk,t1_ff4d7wf,1579601154.0,I don't understand how filming his daughter and where the window is would protect him anyways... what is the logic in that?
Onision,ff5mgsi,t3_ers0ei,1579600208.0,"Yikes... ""art"" imitating life"
Onision,ff5m6qs,t1_f9oe4fi,1579599779.0,"Im down a rabbit hole tonight...

The sere training thing gets under my skin. Sere training is common for airman that will deploy and be airborne. It's not special. It was common in my air force intel career field. He was security forces (military police), not special forces. There is a career field called sere Specialist that is considered an air force special operations but it's not a combat career field. There is a definite distinction that needs to be made between being a sere Specialist and attending sere training. I think he likes to pass off attending, and failing sere training, as him being selected as special ops.

I could be wrong but if he got booted from sere training for refusing to kill the rabbit, I dont think that alone would have been enough for a general discharge as it was likely part of a training requirement for a deployment (or some kind of ancillary training) not for his actual career field. Sounds like he collected a lot of paperwork and this may have just been one of many incidents.

You are right, everyone knows about killing the rabbit in sere school. And there is noooo way you can get pushed into a career field based on your pt score. That's not a thing. My husband scored straight 100s and I was high 90s. No one ever told us we had to enter a different career field because of pt scores. Air force pt standards aren't high so high pt scores are not a rarity.

 Security forces is not always but often where people are put when they enlist without a chosen career feild, aka open general. It's kind of a catch all because every base needs them and the test scores for entry aren't all that high..."

AskReddit,fen7wb8,t1_femhfch,1579278910.0,I had an aunt who stole her children's inheritance and blew it on coke. We started screening our phone calls because she would call my dad asking for money after she spent everything she had on drugs. She didn't know my dad knew about it.
VeryCavallari,fdpwmof,t1_fdpey1s,1578643576.0,First episode of the new season and I've already had way too much of their relationship. I was hoping the breakup meant we didn't have to watch their drama
AskReddit,fdl2goh,t1_fdl29ib,1578515928.0,I have no idea but there was a resturant that had the most amazing butter with their bread. Germany's was always good too
Veterans,fdkyx4o,t1_fdkxok0,1578514025.0,"I did not know that. I can tell you, ID me isnt aware of that either because their reviews are awful and they have people with the same complaints I had. But that is good to know in the future. You cant trust any review wholeheartedly"
Veterans,fdk7vv1,t1_fdk7ab9,1578498092.0,"Oh man, I tried that. It was at least a week long ordeal with them that ended in me blasting their facebook and on them on the VA facebook and I finally got a response. I got feeling their customer service is just a facade. I couldnt access ebenefits because ID me had two accounts for my social. It was a huge mess and the va kept telling me there was nothing they could do, that I had to contact ID me. Its resolved now thankfully but had ID me drop me from their program so I only use the va's login. 

ID me has horrible ratings on the BBB website... I got real petty and had to look haha"

AskReddit,fdj2hoq,t3_elhw94,1578456735.0,"This is so random but I've been seeing this ""fix her crown"" post trend on facebook. It's all about women supporting and empowering other woman. But I have to laugh because 2/3 women that have seen post it are women who I worked with that started having sex with married men I work with... 

I guess it's all about supporting women until a married dick is involved"
