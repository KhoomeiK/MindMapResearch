audioengineering,fgo4m4n,t1_fggda9r,1580959659.0,"Dude this actually happens to me all the time. I mixed for fun for like 2 years before getting a few people to work for. There were some people who weren’t even paying me and I didn’t really put that much effort into their stuff. I basically just did what I considered to be a bare minimum in like an hour, sent the guy a bounce, and he just fucking loved it.

I think it’s because when you’re learning you constantly are trying to hear what isn’t quite working in the mixes you work on. After a while that becomes all you focus on, and then you forget that all the stuff you did right is still massively outweighing the things you think should be better."
audioengineering,fgo41bk,t1_fgfqsvn,1580959275.0,"Dude you know what? I had a similar experience with audio engineering school being a gigantic gate-keeping thing. You go there, you learn all these concepts, you do some recordings, some mixing ect....

But none of what we did was really anything like what working in a studio is actually all about, even less what music production really entails. I basically know how to mix but everything I’ve ever mixed was already “worked-on,” by a pro producer first so I didn’t have to worry about anything other than mixing.

Now that I’m actually trying to be a producer solo-act AND I actually bought some nice gear I suddenly have realized that I basically have no idea what I’m doing.

Taking a song from scratch to a finished production involves so many little in-between steps that permeate the whole process, that no amount of of learning how to set-up mics, record, comp and edit, and then mix, really makes you a “producer.” I’ve had a few embarrassing moments where I was with clients, they asked me to do something, and I had to explain to them that I basically had no idea how to do that and then it got super awkward. Just random shit that you’d know cold if you actually worked in a studio for even like 6 months, like managing headphone mixes and crap, and other stuff like composing synth lines and making EDM drum beats on the fly, which is something I’ve never even spent time learning.

Imo working in a studio is what really gets you ready to run your own studio. The whole school thing is kind of a massive scam. I probably could have taken half the amount of money I used to go to school and used it to bribe someone to intern me lol."
audioengineering,fgnr1wr,t3_ez4h63,1580951001.0,"Honestly you can just abuse dynamic EQ with a lot of sources and it does amazing things that normal EQ just can’t do.

For example, say you want to boost midrange in a vocal. Well, depending on the syllable/note being sung, you will have a completely different balance of harmonics in the sound. So if you just statically boost 1k or whatever, on some notes it will sound right and on other notes it will be too much. If you dial it back so that it’s never “too much,” you end up losing the bulk of the effect on most of the words.

Dynamic eq is something that I basically always use to make vocals sit in a consistent place in my mixes. The same thing applies to the guttural low end of guitars, where some chords or palm mutes may have drastically more or less 80-200 Hz kind of stuff than others.

The other thing that comes to mind is cymbals, but since the advent of that plugin “soothe,” you can just slap that on and it handles the harshness of the odd cymbal hit that’s a bit too loud more gracefully than a dynamic EQ can.

Edit: to confirm what I’m talking about for any true noobs, if you set the dynamic boost in the vocal to be at a level where it sounds good most of the time, but is too “honky,” on one word or another, then you slowly dial down the threshold, while playing those words on a loop in the DAW, and then just listen for when that word starts to sound like it is EQ’d the same as the other words, and then you’ve done it. The end result should be that you don’t hear “EQ,” on the sound, you just hear a sound that can be more distinctly separated from other elements in the mix, which may require you to do some small cuts in the same frequency range. I really just think about it logically. There is only so much frequency, and so much panning room.  If you give the vocal some nice 1k and some 8-12k, and maybe some 2k, then boosting say your guitars at 1.4 or 1.6, and then doing small cuts at 1k and 2k, will be a natural way to seperate the sounds. You obviously have to “use your ears,” but you’ll be doing this sort of thing regardless, just not with a set of pre-ordained frequencies. You have to make a democratic decision between what makes each instrument sound better in solo, versus what you have room for in the whole mix. 90% of the time I’ve found that 1k on vocals is a good place to start, the same way you’d boost 45-80 Hz, (usually 60 tbh,) in a kick drum. The eq varies slightly now and then but really.... I mean we’re really EQing the same instruments over and over, am I right?"

The framer was building like a house every 2 weeks. He demanded perfection from everyone as well as overtime hours and insane speed of cutting, measuring, ect. His policy was that anyone who failed to show up would be immediately fired. Like literally only death would stop this dude from doing his job and he put that level of pressure on everyone else as well. Also would raise his voice instantly as soon as anything started going wrong. The dude could cut stringers in like 5-10 minutes, and have a set of stairs built and installed in like half an hour to an hour. It’s was literally fucking insane, I felt like I was in the army.

I’m kind of just sick of women in general. I work with a lot of older women... You have to watch what you say a lot because you never know who might be offended by what. It’s kind of like this: if a bunch of guys wants to haze you they just insult you to your face. But when a bunch of women don’t like you they just talk behind your back and say nothing to your face. That whole thing is completely unrelated to my mom but holy shit. I don’t think men are really welcome in certain career paths which have historically been dominated by women. Ironically what I’m currently doing for a living is housekeeping. I’ve been at this place for 13 months and I still haven’t really made friends with the core group of “lifers.” They’re super abrasive to interact with and the only thing I’ve ever talked to them about is wether I’m “really cleaning everything,” or not. I would love to go off on them about how nothing we’re doing is as hard as some of the construction jobs I used to have were, but that would accomplish nothing. It’s just hard to look up to these people when they show me nothing other than distrust and then act like they’re better than me when I know that if it came down to it for real I could work circles around them. I’m literally 28 and these women are almost 50. I feel no desire to “prove myself,” to them, I only feel annoyed by their attitude of superiority.

This is definitely the right sub for these rants at least! Btw I’m potentially going to get a job housekeeping for 20 dollars an hour soon. After what I went through to climb to 20 working on that framing crew I can’t believe how completely screwed men can be if they end up in the wrong line of work, by which I mean, in a male dominated line of work. The amount of work a young man might have to do for that wage compared to what a woman in a hospital worker’s union has to do is absurdly different. I can only speak from experience with these two jobs though, and I know carpentry is like 98% male, and hospital work is probably like 50-80 percent female. Haven’t looked it up."

Some of us would probably love to talk all about it but the unfortunate truth is that there is such a massive stigma surrounding the whole thing that it’s better to just pretend like we’re not “psychotic,” to begin with. Honestly that word is basically offensive to me at this point.

The drugs I’ve been told to take as so life-destroying it’s unreal that anyone ever considered them to be a good thing. Borderline narcolepsy and feeling woozy all the time is pure hell. I had a day where I slept for 12 hours, woke up exhausted, tried to do something for an hour, then fell asleep for another 3, then woke up for about six, then took my meds again and slept for another 12. I stopped taking them soon after. I had to go through a 4-6 week withdrawal period after going cold turkey that was insane. Massive headaches and nausea constantly, as well as an extremely irritable mood. If I hadn’t stopped taking them I probably would have lost my job eventually because the drowsy ness and loss of ability to focus that the medication causes was turning me into someone who just showed up to work and did the bare minimum, and was beginning to just outright skip doing certain things that I figured wouldn’t be noticed.

I could go on in detail about how the “voices,” are often nice to have, basically just a distraction from the drudgery of everyday life for the most part. If I need to focus on something I definitely can. They aren’t invasive, and I feel like if they were, Id want to take some AP medication.... maybe for a day. Or two days. Usually when I do this it “resets,” the whole thing because the medication basically forces you to sleep. The only bad thing that can happen is if the “voices,” start to be like.... A feedback loop coming out of my own worst fears. It can make you feel paranoid, or scared, and then the result is insomnia. Since I’ve been using the medication only when I really need it, I’ve had like.... Three days where I felt I actually needed it out of the past 4-5 months.

I’m terrified of going back to the psych ward and being forced to take this medication, and because of this fear I’m literally never going to tell the truth to my psychiatrist again. He believes that the medication needs to be taken daily, and that the whole “voices in the head,” thing is a disease that needs to be “cured.” I honestly don’t even think it’s a bad thing. He’s also sure that A.) if I stopped taking it I’d immediately have another “psychotic episode,” and would end up being admitted anyways, and B.) that “the withdrawal from drug-that-I-won’t-name-because-I-don’t-want-anyone-reading-this-to-be-able-to-identify-me “isn’t that bad, and would be nothing to worry about.

Based on him telling me that he “knows,” those things with more or less absolute certainty, I’m pretty sure he’s basically a complete fucking retard and I can’t stand that I still have to go see him every once in a while and pretend that I’m taking it. But anyways.

I honestly don’t think it’s even a bad thing. Sometimes I just feels like I have an over-active imagination. 

I think about having like tardive dsykenisia in 20 years from taking this fucking poison and it’s terrifying. Being found out as being “off my meds,” and then somehow being forced to take them imo would be worse than death."

Depending on the scope of your work I might not even worry about going much higher in price than one of those 6C/12th ryzen processors. But 32 of RAM and a decent amount of nvme storage will be really great in the long run. You can update the processor later if you need to, but to start if you just use pro tools 12, you’ll be running plugins with AAX format instead of RTAS or VST, which means you can use the same plugins but use less processing power.

TooAfraidToAsk,ffrrkne,t3_eukwcp,1580164251.0,"There just isn’t really an alternative lifestyle that’s realistically an option. Eventually you connect with enough people through work who are older than you and have already accepted the “work is what life is all about,” kind of attitude, that you start to also adopt that attitude, and then things start to seem more normal, and older people will begin to respect you as they notice your work ethic.

Either that or you’ll go through a traumatic series of firings and hirings, and you’ll adopt that attitude out of fear.

By the time it’s over, (ie: when who you were as a teenager is truly dead, like around 30-40,) you’ll begin to hate and belittle people who aren’t worker bees. They aren’t a part of the in crowd yet."

AskReddit,ffjlgbt,t3_ett7fr,1580000958.0,"Tbh, I worked on a few framing crews for like 3.5 years total. It was insanely hard work, outdoors in all manner of cold and wet weather, and I’ll be proud of myself because of it... Basically for the rest of my life.

But I didn’t really make any money doing it, I just paid off a student loan. I have this random pain in my hips and legs from carrying around all the stupid tools around my waist that I don’t know if it will ever go away. I’m only 28 and I have this stupid pain bugging me, but the worst thing is, now that I’m in a different line of work, no one knows what I went through and I’m having a lot of problems connecting with people and forming meaningful relationships. If you’re talking to someone who’s 40 plus and you complain about any sort of chronic pain you won’t get any sympathy.

I remember being in high school, taking a shop class, and thinking: “well if there’s one thing I really don’t want to do it’s carpentry,” and then lo and behold I ended up at a temp labour agency one day and the rest is history.

So not only do I have this hip pain, but I also don’t really “look up,” to a lot of people who I’ve met in my new line of work who haven’t been through the kind of stuff I’ve been through. I think in every career path there’s sort of this “hazing, then raising,” phase that everyone goes through at the beginning.... But you can’t really go through it more than once. I won’t really be anything other than a framer for the rest of my life, (on the inside,) but fuck actually doing that shit for 40 years.

So it’s a net-negative effect on the whole because now I just have what most people would consider to be a “bad attitude,” and potentially a life long rsi."
DestinyTheGame,ffjjuca,t3_etpu7x,1579999861.0,"There’s something else you failed to mention, and that’s the fact that everyone who is satisfied with the game they’re playing isn’t taking the time, (usually,) to say anything about it on social media and forums.

The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Developers end up making changes to try and please people who are already “on their way out,” (so to speak,) because their displeasure with playing the game stems from a fundamental psychological flaw which will cause them to eventually leave the competitive gaming environment anyways. That is that they attribute their failures not to lack of skill but to a problem with the game’s design. People who are somehow hard-wired differently, to look for ways to change their own gameplay to adapt to the game in order to find success, will almost always find enjoyment in competitive games regardless of what things are perceived by others as “imbalanced.” After the game changes, people who were already used to the “way things were,” will potentially be alienated by the fact that some things which they have internalized are now “wrong,” and the people who were complaining will find new things to complain about anyways.

The end result is that the complainers leave, (they will never be satisfied,) and some of the core audience also leaves, (they will begin looking for other, similar games to start over with.)

Anyone who has been following the drama on the official WoW arena and battleground forums for the last 8-10 years will know exactly what I’m talking about."

I think it’s just the way he talks about transgender people as mentally ill. I don’t think any of his other views are “hard right,” or “hard left,” but just having that one thing to say probably makes a lot of people question if there’s anything else behind that which he isn’t saying on air."

gaming,ffef71v,t1_ffed464,1579845715.0,"Everything about it is so..... Damn balanced. The classes really feel unique and they have specific strengths that can counter others. Just the classic spec load-outs like SV98 recon or XM8 with underbarrel shotgun assault or Gustav engineer are like cult classics. Nothing really feels too overpowered, the recon can kill you instantly but requires the most skill, the engineer also can but requires a longer reload time and no motion sensors, whereas the assault can string together more kills in quick succession without stopping to reload anything, but can’t use splash damage or motion sensors, but also still has the one-shot opener from the shotgun.

The fact that I can play an all-infantry map and feel like I have an equal shot at doing well with each load out but merely need to adjust my play style accordingly really speaks to the dynamic balance of the game."
