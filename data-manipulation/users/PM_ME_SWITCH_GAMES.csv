college,fffc0aj,t3_et7sfu,1579880629.0,"There is only one way to do it. break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do you go for the vault? No. Go for the chandelier; it's priceless. As you're taking it down, a woman catches you. She tells you to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. You say no. You make love all night. In the morning the cops come and you escape in one of their uniforms. You tell her to meet me in Mexico but you go to Canada. You don't trust her. Besides, you love the cold. Thirty years later you get a postcard. You have a son. And he's the Chief of Police. This is where the story gets interesting: You tell Tiffany to meet you in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for you all these years. She's never taken another lover. You don't care. You don't show up. You go to the United States for college which you pay for using the chandelier."
