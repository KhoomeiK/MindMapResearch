Preferably with staff that are experienced in helping customers find a style that fits their face profile, and where customers can return to have the hat maintained.

AskReddit,fengl2a,t1_fen5ytn,1579284236.0,"Eh, when we went to Red Rocks this past summer for Shpongle it was my first time out west. Enjoyed the countryside much more than the bit of shopping we did in Denver. Did get a nice jacket.
Was surprised to find no decent hat shops except for Gorin Bros... which is so-so.

We stayed in Golden. The dinosaur trail and Red Rocks park in general was great. Hot springs were nice. The wide open spaces were very freeing compared to here.

Oh, and they say go to Mt Evans instead of Aspen. Unfortunately the access road was closed while we were there."

Previously, the machine would just reboot after a few minutes. I'm not sure why it made a difference in the actual install process."
