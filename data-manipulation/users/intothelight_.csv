AskReddit,ffczj9v,t3_esxbov,1579810474.0,"Education. I’d want to take as many courses/ classes as I can. No amount of material belongs compare to knowledge, for me at least."
statistics,ffce1bk,t1_ffc9kuv,1579797444.0,"Nice, I’ll give this a try. Thank you for the suggestion!"
statistics,ffce01t,t1_ffc9kno,1579797423.0,"This is a great idea, I’ll try doing this. Thank you!"
statistics,ffcdx6u,t1_ffc7u3o,1579797372.0,"Thank you for the link! I tried to Google examples of what I was looking for and got rather confused and found the examples didn’t exactly apply. I’ll ask another professor for a copy of their syntax though, that’s a great idea!"
statistics,ffcdrt2,t1_ffc7cx0,1579797278.0,"Huh, that’s brilliant. I think I was overthinking it because my supervisor said to type out the syntax."

Professors,ff6u12i,t1_ff6tp6q,1579634867.0,"See, I definitely respect that because certain things need to be explained in more detail. From my experience the majority of my professors will read the syllabus in detail and then dismiss the class after. Sometimes I wish professors would offer bonus marks or something on the first day if students could answer questions about the syllabus... Clearly I’m bitter about how many times I’ve read the syllabus before hand and had to sit through having it read aloud to me haha."
Professors,ff6sxe8,t1_ff6mbk9,1579634220.0,I wish more professors were like this. I’m in my fourth year and even in my seminar courses the first day is still devoted to discussing the syllabus. If students can’t figure out how to read their syllabi by fourth year they’ve got bigger issues...
Embroidery,fep9th5,t3_eq9rth,1579315361.0,This is so cool!!
MadeMeSmile,feow2l6,t3_eq7ry6,1579306651.0,This is so awesome. I know it’s not possible but it feels like my heart is smiling haha.
millionairemakers,feovy0i,t3_eq81a8,1579306574.0,"I’m not sure what qualifies as being a top level comment. So, I hope who ever is reading this is having a great day and knows that there’s someone out there rooting for them."
