These: Yummy AND pretty? Can’t handle it. 

Are the ones on top red velvet, or vanilla with food coloring, or something else?"

A few decades ago there was medical treatment—that we considered effective and reasonable—that would now be considered inhumane. We thought we understood things that we clearly didn’t. We seem to mostly agree that we are making progress. 

But right now, in this moment, it is very likely we are approaching some problems ineffectively. It has been happening since forever. I think it’s worth a look into what might need to be overhauled. But there seems to be a sense of “No but this is different, this is the *present*; *I’m* here”. 

This might seem a bizarre tangent, because it is. I tried to explain my thought process but I decided that made it worse so I deleted it. I just don’t think we necessarily understand problems that we think understand. I’m so sorry for rambling."

I don’t make up problems, but I (and many, many others) apprehend problems other people don’t, which is basically the same as far as they are concerned, I guess. 

You know how we look back at the way certain disabilities and developmental issues were treated decades ago, but less than a hundred years ago?

Why is it that people insist on operating under the assumption that RIGHT NOW when THEY happen to exist, we have it all right? Doctors can’t be wrong, protocol, SOP can’t be wrong, because it’s 2020 and we know better than those ignorant old silly billies?"

Do I have to know he was a gamer? He just...was overweight and looked very much like one. I mean maybe he wasn’t but...a lot of guys play video games and if I had to put money on either gamer or not gamer, I’d go with gamer. Anyway. 

I was approaching an intersection and this dude had his car almost parallel to the crosswalk. Light was green, he was blocking both lanes. I began to get mad until I got closer and saw a little old lady walking painfully slowly across the street. My view of her had been blocked by dude’s car. 

I realized he had done that to make sure she didn’t get hit. I wanted so badly to ask for his number. I was too afraid of rejection. 

I would have done things to him that I don’t want to describe here."

Because I’m grateful to have someone wanting to talk to me, but I feel incapable of being any good to anyone, so I just want to hide, so I feel bad because my behavior screams “taking y’all for granted” when I don’t at all, I just, can’t be normal enough to talk at the moment and really, really don’t want to talk."

todayilearned,ff7pq0p,t1_ff65mxs,1579655348.0,"The bitch of it is, a lot of people seem to think depressed people just aren’t trying hard enough to appreciate life. The big things depress the fuck out of me, so I really try to appreciate the little good things. Then when one of those things goes wrong/disappears/just goes to shit, it seems like I’m overreacting to something small. But it’s difficult to appreciate a little thing and give it value, and then brush it off when you lose it. This is probably a result of PTSD too though. Every disappointment feels like the worst ones did. Thankfully it’s often temporary because something else always comes up. Such a fucked up cycle."

So no one with depression needs anyone saying what you’ve said here. We have said it to ourselves literally ad nauseam."

I understand most kids are able to participate and remain unharmed but if I had a kid who wrestled I would be losing my shit every match. I think I might expressly forbid it. And football. And don’t worry, I know this is bc of my shit. I own it. So I’m not having kids. Ever. I don’t know how mothers even breathe."

PublicFreakout,ff5ad4v,t1_ff59up0,1579585109.0,"Sorry, I was specifically asking the guy who said it’s the fault of the kid being slammed. It appeared to me just as you said. That’s why I wanted to know why anything that kid did before he was even lifted up could be blamed for what the slamming kid proceeded to do.

Edit: The guy being responsible for the safe return to the mat of anyone he lifts up makes tons of sense to me. And this guy’s talking about hip position, etc, but if a kid can’t accurately assess the situation and compensate by adjusting his approach or doing something else, he shouldn’t be doing that kind of heavy lifting (sorry). That seems both intuitive and pragmatic.

(I get that it doesn’t matter what slamee did, slammer is responsible, I just want to understand that commenter’s reasoning)"
AskReddit,ff59qmj,t3_erhu3x,1579584517.0,"I was headed for a mission in a spaceship that looked kind of like the Gravitron (the carnival ride) with a bunch of my peers I really liked (in the dream, not real people I know) and we got launched into space via something like a giant slingshot. It was terrifying but space was so beautiful. I woke up like “Nooo that was so cool; let me go back”.

I actually have a lot of these. That was like 4 years ago. I’ve had a lot more. Hell, this even happens to me with nightmares. I’ll wake up and sometimes I have a normal reaction—“Phew just a nightmare”— and sometimes I’m like, shit, I preferred that nightmare to this one"
PublicFreakout,ff5826f,t1_ff4n4k4,1579582978.0,"I admit I don’t know shit about wrestling. This is a sincere question.

If you’re talking about the arm the kid hooked around his opponent’s neck: that appears to have happened before his opponent even lifted him up. Is the idea that the kid had the intention of doing a legal move and that arm fucked it up, leading to that illegal move? Why isn’t the onus on him to account for that arm and do something else?"
