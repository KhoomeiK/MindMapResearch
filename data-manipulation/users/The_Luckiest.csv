nba,fgtdo0e,t3_f0c6q5,1581103048.0,"In hockey the play is stopped when the ref “has the intent to blow the whistle”, not when the actual whistle sounds. So it doesn’t matter if the puck enters the net just before the whistle blows, since the ref had *intent* to stop play before that. 

That’s similar to how timeouts should work. Check to see when the coach first signaled (physically, with a T), and set the game clock accordingly."

politics,fgpgb9n,t3_eziurm,1581004234.0,"I have a question... the Senate was voting on whether or not Trump was guilty of the actions described by the House, correct? 

It seemed as though the GOP’s argument was simply “although he may have done it, the actions are not impeachable”. But the House *already* determined that the actions *were* impeachable.

Isn’t the senate supposed to vote on whether or not he did it? When they vote “not guilty”, it seems as though they are claiming that he is “not guilty” of doing those actions. It wasn’t really refuted that he didn’t do them.

TL;DR I don’t understand how the vote was on whether or not the actions were impeachable - the House already determined that they *were*. Seems redundant.
