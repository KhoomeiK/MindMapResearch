financialindependence,fgk49b5,t1_fgjwaao,1580857160.0,One guy on this sub wasn't sure if he'd be able to make enough to live independently and retire early. His income was 560K and his rent 10K per month.
Lightbulb,fgjvejn,t3_eyv7jp,1580852144.0,There are gifted schools and schools broken into academies for that. There's also pull-out programs and advanced placement courses. I like your idea and I think what you may be saying touches more on reshaping curriculum in the classroom instead of adding more gifted and advanced programs. Please forward your lightbulb idea to r/teachers where they would have a much tailored feedback for you. I'm a also a teacher and I'd love to hear their input. We have a great community there.

interestingasfuck,fgju3m0,t1_fgjokfk,1580851420.0,Wow. I never looked at it that way. I just realized how incredibly small that number is. It's no wonder the Japanese hold a celebration come spring time for the pink tree blossoms. Thank you for bringing that to everyone's attention.
interestingasfuck,fgjttf3,t3_eypivj,1580851264.0,"I love how you started and ended with winter. It makes spring and summer right there in the middle all that special.

dataisbeautiful,fge7xcz,t3_exnh2c,1580693397.0,"If I can give my two cents - 


I don't think it's religion, I think it's the fear and paranoia of not wanting to be cast into hell that leads into a spiraling degradation of social standards by adhering to insane obsessive compulsive ideology and requirements that usually the people in power--men-- enforce, that oppress the masses and leave the population in a culture of darkness and superstition. Those men who are privileged to shape such a society receive an elitist education and are enlightened. They then deceitfully continue to grow a dark ignorant population while they thrive in riches, sleep with hundreds of women, and live in gold decadence. This insanity then leads civilians to severe economic problems and daily civil unrest between each other until they hate each others ethnicities.

Terribly different from what Jesus declared - Follow me and you will be set free."

Christian,fg79y1m,t1_fg79dm1,1580587450.0,"Okay. So for future references: NEVER apply make-up to any burn. 

Apply pure unscented Vaseline onto it and cover the burn area with a sterile bandage or gauze.

I suggest you visit a dermatologist...If it's a 2nd or 3rd degree chemical burn, please head straight for the emergency room."

I'm curious to know if there is a test you find accredible? If not, how do you assess your personality traits?"
extroverts,fg72nb9,t1_fcypwqi,1580582556.0,Yes my co-worker actually told me that being shy could happen to either an introvert or extrovert. And that the E or I is meant to assess where you take your energy from. I'm an ENTJ.

Christian,fg6x8r1,t3_ex7mxe,1580578991.0,"For goodness sakes. God is also the master of common sense. Stop using the powder and go see a doctor! You simply had an abnormal allergic reaction to the powder. You should NEVER be putting anything on your face especially after surgery. 


You probably have been getting nightmares because your face is burning. While sleeping, the nervous system gets disrupted when you're uncomfortable or in pain, so when youre asleep, your brain fires pain signals that interfere with your sleep system. Thus you have nightmares. Please be informed  and educated. The devil pries on ignorance. Knowledge is power. Knowledge casts out darkness. That's how you fix your situation."

offbeat,fg3fw6m,t1_fg3btfu,1580480494.0,"Oh that makes a lot of sense, if our brains could interpret jumbled words why wouldn't someone be able to read a headline with just a few missing articles?  You know, I'm still trying to understand why I misread the headline. Perhaps comparing it to jumbled words wasn't the right analogy. Maybe something along the lines of commas save lives? Like ""Let's eat grandma"" vs ""Let's eat, grandma"". Or perhaps it's that hypen between man and riding that was established in my mind while reading it although on the headline it wasn't present. If the headline was read out loud to me I'd probably assume the hyphen was there. This turned out to be quite interesting to me. Thanks for your insight!"
offbeat,fg3bhyn,t1_fg2zbus,1580477043.0,"Right right good point. But our brain still deciphers things like that regardless. Like have you ever tried reading a paragraph where all the words were misspelled but kept the first and last letter? Interestingly enough it still made sense to the brain. The process of reading comprehension is quite fascinating. I pasted a sample below.
