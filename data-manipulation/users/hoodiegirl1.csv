You do also have to take into account that some states include tips in wages. So states like Indiana, if you are a server that gets tips, you get paid about 2.13 an hour from the business and the rest has to come from tips."

MurderedByWords,ffdjecy,t3_esy8ce,1579822129.0,"Just want to throw in my two cents. I work for a company that owns and manages apartments. Depending on the property and it’s location you have to gross 2.5 to 3x the rent per month to qualify to live there. The calculations below are how our leasing teams calculate annual income and qualifications. 

7.25 (hourly rate) * 2080 (annual hours) =
$15,080 per year pretax 

Divide that by 12 (months in a year)
15080/12 = 1257 per month pretax

If the property is 2.5x the rent:
1257/2.5 = 502.70

If the property is 3x the rent:
1257/3 = 419

Anyone trying to rent a one bedroom for that is going to be hard up for a place to live. In a tiny town, they might make it, but in a city, they don’t stand a chance. In major cities, these days it’s hard to find a 1 bedroom for less than $900.
