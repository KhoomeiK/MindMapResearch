unitedkingdom,fffdf5g,t1_fffazh0,1579881517.0,Sounds like a class action waiting to happen!
unitedkingdom,fff0cvl,t3_etabfb,1579872145.0,Anyone with any sense could've told the government this was an idiotic idea that couldn't possibly have been effective.
todayilearned,ff6v505,t1_ff6v0v5,1579635522.0,At least that makes logical sense.
todayilearned,ff6bhot,t1_ff66g6b,1579623555.0,"This is because state-run monopolies are noncompetitive and inefficient.  When I visited the US it was really striking how churches seemed to be competing with each other to get people to go.  In the UK, churches do absolutely nothing except exist and almost everybody only goes for weddings, funerals and christenings."
todayilearned,ff5zjp8,t3_eruymq,1579615204.0,"The up side of this is that, if you've getting tired of an online discussion, you can put a swift end to it by making a Hitler analogy."
YouShouldKnow,feylg53,t3_eqiuii,1579447171.0,"The science museum, natural history museum and Victoria & Albert museum are all right next to each other, all free and all amazing. 

The National Gallery just off Trafalgar Square is also free and amazing

My favourite free one is The British Museum though. It’s worth going just for the Rosetta Stone and the Elgin Marbles."
gifs,feyhjam,t3_eqr6ns,1579445663.0,Makes you wonder how they found it in the first place under all that snow!
bald,fer75oh,t3_eq8kr8,1579350630.0,"Buy yourself some hats. Also, it pays off in the summer. Just remember sunscreen!!!"
todayilearned,fekt8xp,t1_fekmf7a,1579207126.0,"It restores my faith in humanity that comments like these get so many downvotes. Every community has bad eggs and person who left this comment is obviously one of them, but it shows me that the community as a whole is good."
AskReddit,fekqw4i,t3_epj100,1579205743.0,"Steel Division: Normandy 44

Why this game isn’t more popular is beyond me."
todayilearned,fek2dgi,t1_fek2595,1579191139.0,"Well the soviets kept him locked up for five years after he was captured, but to be fair that doesn't really tell us much."
todayilearned,fek291j,t3_epkvqc,1579191063.0,Are you seriously telling me that beef production is only considered to require so much water because it rains a lot where cows live? Oh....
todayilearned,fe9qj7o,t1_fe9k4sz,1578940581.0,"The government and the judiciary are separate, but to be fair the government probably feels the same way."
todayilearned,fe8j7zq,t1_fe8is7u,1578926720.0,Exactly! Buying things like cars is a bit different though because people tend to pay more attention so are less likely to be confused. The “moron in a hurry” concept applies more to low cost things like groceries.
gifs,fe3sivw,t3_enmlow,1578852472.0,"This also makes the gate close under its own weight whichever way it is open. I walked through a few of these gates around Ullswater in the Lake District. 

OP, do you know where this gate is?"
todayilearned,fdqnvcq,t3_emrjfq,1578671057.0,Because it's fraud.  It should be a crime everywhere.
todayilearned,fdqcjtp,t1_fdoownm,1578662997.0,Please also apologise to him on my behalf for inadvertently informing you about this.
todayilearned,fdnuiod,t1_fdnuaw9,1578593105.0,"I really, really hope this is true."
todayilearned,fdnt315,t1_fdnre8c,1578592278.0,"Sorry, dude."
todayilearned,fdnjwdr,t3_emb9gh,1578587347.0,"It is possibly also the only time that nuclear weapons have been used to save lives.  The prospect of Japan not surrendering and the Allies actually having to invade really doesn't bare thinking about.  Supposedly, the US produced so many Purple Heart medals for the invasion of Japan that they still haven't run out."
todayilearned,fdnjo2y,t3_embf1n,1578587211.0,This is how capitalism works.

todayilearned,fdk9hbj,t3_elu05i,1578499105.0,The whole point of the post of Prime Minister existing is as a counterbalance to the power of the monarch.  It's like they're trying to copy off other countries but have no idea what they're doing.
worldnews,fdighkg,t1_fdhgv8t,1578442370.0,Season 1 was bad enough but season 2 got reeeeal dark. Not sure I’ll be tuning in for the next one.
todayilearned,fdgnfje,t3_elb1qd,1578403116.0,"It's such a shame that skills like this are thrown away as soon as they become remotely uneconomical.  In a couple of decades when people start to really value these skills again, there will be nobody left who knows how to do it."
todayilearned,fdgnax9,t3_elan1j,1578403003.0,"It's difficult to see how this could be economical for the restaurant but I suppose it is a status thing.  If they want to be seen as the finest sushi restaurant around, they have to use the most expensive tuna."
todayilearned,fdgn5l4,t3_elb578,1578402873.0,I genuinely don't understand why this painting is so famous.  Can anybody shed some light on this for me?
todayilearned,fdgn0u7,t3_elayen,1578402755.0,"Calling it ""digitus impudicus"" makes it almost seem classy."

todayilearned,fddtygl,t3_ekuxns,1578323906.0,I expect that the low level of corruption and stable democratic government are the key factors here.  Many other countries have extremely rich natural resources but fail to develop because the proceeds get swallowed up by corruption (many Sub-Saharan African countries) or government mismanagement (Zimbabwe and Venezuela).  It is the human element that makes the difference.
todayilearned,fddp3hf,t3_ektb9t,1578320106.0,Finland does have an advantage over a lot of other countries in that they have a relatively small population and plenty of land.
todayilearned,fddoywk,t3_eku2qb,1578319995.0,That's a fancy name for everybody's new year resolution.
todayilearned,fddotm9,t3_ektt5p,1578319869.0,He can't have been very good if he failed to resuscitate 85 of his victims.

AquaticAsFuck,fd3ohlt,t3_ejvbti,1578160287.0,"Not to get all medical on you but that finger has nail clubbing which can be a sign of serious medical problems. If anyone knows the person who made this video, tell them to see a doctor."
menwritingwomen,fclu5mt,t1_fcgdyd0,1577756534.0,This sounds like paedophile erotica. I had no idea this was a thing.
AmItheAsshole,fciboh2,t3_eh8f8j,1577660196.0,What you or your family want isn’t really relevant. It’s entirely up to your fiancé. It’s their name.
todayilearned,fchg4xw,t3_ehady7,1577650186.0,I feel sorry for everyone else who sold up for market value.  It's not like this couple deserved more money just for being obstructive and holding up a project that would create jobs for local people.  All the land owners should've banded together and negotiated jointly so everyone could benefit.
todayilearned,fchfgbc,t3_ehaarf,1577649945.0,"I understand they trained the dogs to run under tanks by putting their food there.  The problem was that they used their own tanks rather than captured German ones in training so the dogs didn't recognise the German tanks and ran under their own tanks instead.  

I would say ""Karma sucks"" but it's not like the Germans didn't do anything worse than train dogs to be suicide bombers so...."

SyrianRebels,fc9aa51,t1_faeptu7,1577549567.0,What a tragedy for another Syrian family that has already lost so much because of this war. The sooner this is all over the better.
todayilearned,fc8h9by,t3_egpwnh,1577534872.0,Apparently swan isn’t very nice and tastes kind of fishy.
todayilearned,fc8h68s,t3_egpqk7,1577534814.0,Well they need one to keep Sauron in check!
todayilearned,fc8h4qe,t3_egpliz,1577534786.0,Pedestrian safety doesn’t seem to be much of a consideration when people are choosing which cars to buy.
todayilearned,fc8h0f0,t3_egpkb8,1577534708.0,So there was fifty years between him being wounded and dying. That is an awfully long time for his death to be attributed to his wound!
todayilearned,fc68sh7,t3_egfajp,1577474902.0,"Mechanical harvesters leave huge amounts of crops behind that usually just gets ploughed back in to fertilise the ground for the next harvest. If you’re going to collect it, just remember to wash the food really well before eating it."

todayilearned,fc68f1k,t3_egepli,1577474656.0,"The RAF also use Xbox controllers for armed drones. At first it seems strange but if the technology works (and, let’s be honest, already familiar to the kinds of people who are likely to be using it) then why go the the trouble and expense of developing something different?"
SyrianRebels,fc66w9s,t1_fc4sa8x,1577473644.0,I’ve seen people say some very sick things like this on here. I wonder what’s wrong with you to make you have such disgusting thoughts.
todayilearned,fc5p4ki,t3_egcdix,1577462998.0,The kid who played John Connor in Terminator 2 also had a bad time later in life. Getting famous as a kid is really a mixed blessing.

IdiotsInCars,fc4cutn,t3_efyrw3,1577412987.0,I was surprised when the car door opened and a person and not a blind retarded monkey stepped out.
