Successful services and products generates revenue.

But money does not necessarily generate successful services and products.

I hate seeing companies fail, and on such large scales, over very easy to recognize irrational decision making processes. It's so much worse that in this case it adds unnecessary risk endangering human life."
Physics,ff55gob,t1_feic7ji,1579580770.0,"I was thinking about this as well, it seems to me a black hole is a poor comparison to the state of the universe prior to the big bang. Black holes form within the universe, within the gravity and laws of physics inside of the universe. This must be a fundamentally different phenomena from the infinitely dense universe prior to expansion, there must have been entirely different physics at play prior to the start of expansion. The laws of physics as we know them now would never allow a black hole to become a sudden expansion of spacetime, that concept doesn't exist, and so I think the common comparison of pre-big bang to black holes must be flawed.

Although I can't mentally reconcile what pre-big bang universe even means, are we inside of an infinite set of nested universe that started expanding? Or maybe the universe has been expanding forever into the past and there was no 'start' to the expansion, maybe the big bang has always been occurring... at different time scales... for eons.

I forgot where I was going with this, my mind hurts.

edit; Oh yes, another point, black holes experience Hawking Radiation, but I doubt pre-big bang universe did as well. I continue to make my case that pre-big bang universe must have been something entirely different from a black hole, maybe?"

PrequelMemes,fe31j9b,t1_fe1eusp,1578845045.0,"She sat down with George Lucas at Skywalker Ranch and he told her, to her face that the extended universe exists. This was before any of the films were created or even written. She was not the only person there that day, and there were many days since that fact was brought up. This is clearly explained in more than one behind the scenes and interviews with George Lucas, others around her knew as well, also it was her job to know what Star Wars is and what material generally exists.

She is lying, she did lie then. She blatantly lied. She did that because she is a narcissist with an agenda and does not give a shit about the truth, she cares about her idea of making money. If in her head the random idea that ""X"" will not make money appears then she looks at doing ""Y"" instead, logic and rational is not applied towards storytelling, it's driven towards the perception of what she thinks generates profit.

It has become known that JJ Abrams, despite is epic levels of cool and self-control in public, was fraught with frustration in his directing duties by having his hands frequently tied, what we have seen is not actually his vision, which still would have been better what we got.

George Lucas had treatments for the new trilogy made which were given to Disney on the day the acquisition occurred, she knew all about that. And we've learned that it would have actually been quite interesting story. She refused to understand any of it and/or just did not care.

It comes down to her and her betrayal of George Lucas.

That's how the new Star Wars films became what they were."

space,fdxy6lr,t3_emxlce,1578774125.0,"Can they physically exist as we know them now after even millions of years in space? Would eons of particle collisions slowly erode them into unrecognizable heaps of metal? Also factoring in the probabilities of random collisions over time?

I don't think we've ever seen an asteroid/meteor that wasn't pummeled with craters, after a while I imagine the Voyagers will look the same... so I kind of wonder if there is an ""entropy barrier"" for space travel without some form of active self-healing or repair/maintenance to maintain form. By ""entropy barrier"" I mean a radius from earth where given a set of probabilities one would not expect a satellite or ship to remain in functional or recognizable form without active repair/maintenance.

Side note, I suspect we'll develop propulsion technologies that allow us to catch up and pass these satellites within 500 years, we'll probably have to launch new voyagers outside of the galaxy at far greater speeds by then."
Physics,fdvs0of,t1_fdvjqqx,1578750892.0,"Closed containers with specific pressure will sustain or collapse in pressure differentials depending on how big the pressure difference and the strength of that container.

Imagine that the air is full of countless atoms moving around, bouncing into everything. In fact, the air can be thought of as an ocean. The actual ocean is comprised of water (H2O) which is much more dense than air. The air comprised of nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) mostly, both are vast volumes of atoms that move around like a liquid but at different scales and densities. For the same reason that the ocean of water falls down below the air is why weak containers collapse under vacuum in the air. Also the same reason why the deeper into the ocean you go the higher the pressure on you. And even coming into earth from orbit, the closer to the ground you come the higher the atmospheric pressure on your body. Air has weight, your body is sustaining itself against the pressure of the atmosphere above you.

Now back to sucking air out of a bottle, you are removing matter from the container (gas/air), making it lower in density than the environment outside of it. When the bottle is low enough in density it is trying to sustain its form against the weight of the environment, at a certain point a given container won't be strong enough to hold its form and collapse under the pressure.

Imagine a thousand pounds of weight sitting on you, your body will squish and be crushed. That's the effect of pressure on an object, it's just different scales and different matter.

You've evolved and learned to live on the surface of the earth without appreciating what that really means. You have sufficient mass of matter (fluids and solids) to hold up against the pressure of the atmosphere. Go down into the depths of the ocean without a submarine though, you'll be literally be crushed to death. All the same concept.

Creating a vacuum in a container increases the impact of the environments pressure due to the presence of the atmosphere on said container. Very strong containers can hold up with a vacuum while very weak containers will collapse under the environmental pressure.

Also another thing to consider, there are no perfect vacuums, not even space is a perfect vacuum, some areas of space I'm sure are nearly perfect.

We exist on a world of varying gasses and fluids with varying pressure depending on how deep you go into each."
movies,fdpr2gx,t1_fdpllb6,1578637266.0,"If you're not familiar with the history of The Hobbit's production you should look into it, it was an utter nightmare. Peter Jackson was forced to jump in at the last second with no planning to get the films completed on time, it really was the studio's fault and not his.

PJ had many years of prep work available for LoTR, the studio did not allow him that for The Hobbit. Guillermo del Toro was the original director for The Hobbit but the studio strung him along with no start date for so many years that he had to quit and come back to his family. He actually relocated for many years to where they would film and he was away for so long and the studio never let him begin the project.

The highest density state of matter we are aware of prior to a black hole forming is I believe a quark star, this is more dense than a neutron star. Further than that may very well be possible with Quantum Mechanics, it's General Relativity that readily produces singularities because it doesn't have the ability to describe physics at those scales.

Wikipedia says; ""Observations released by the Chandra X-ray Observatory on April 10, 2002 detected two possible quark stars, designated RX J1856.5-3754 and 3C58, which had previously been thought to be neutron stars.""  And there's more then that too...
