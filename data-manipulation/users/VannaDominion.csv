Eventually you will come to an acceptance that ypu are not running the show. That the most high loves you, died for you and wants you in his kingdom.  How many people are willing to die for you? How often do you feel like noone gives a crap about you? He does and wants you to be woke and have a personal relationship with him. ♡♡♡"

homeless,fci40w8,t1_fchzkt1,1577657514.0,"I live on Philadelphia rd. I would get hit by a car if i attempted that. I have tried to get foodstamps i had them for a month but because they wouldn't let me do phone appointment they took them from me.  I clean the house in the a.m. when my brother is asleep. I cook and clean up. I have ptsd from being beaten an raped in the past. My panic attacks are crippling when im around people. Bus lines dont run anywhere near me. I just was able to get medical insurance because I started spending more time upstairs to make phone calls. I was gong to get a doctor lined up and make appointments right after new years so i could get help for all the abuse i have been thru. I was wasted away hiding and when i try to help myself i get into an argument defending myself from my brother because im upstairs too much an my presence annoys him. Im desperately trying to help myself. Now ill be on the streets. Its freezing raining. Shelters are not taking any one unless its 30 degrees below, mom said today to me as she ha been looking to get me out to somewhere they can help me heal."

depression,fcbteru,t1_fcbqt0o,1577590766.0,"Gratitude for the advice. I will lookk for a running van now. Who knows, maybe i can find one donated or very cheap. My mother has told me she already called the only other family i have, an aunt an cousin an they said they can't.  I'm praying for a timeline to make these calls, ive made a few already and most will return to work on the 4th of January... my birthday is the 12th... what a way to end this year, start anew and be so alone. I would be dead already if not for tinker, my dog. Her love for me keeps me going. She's very aware of my emotions, my panic attacks... i am thankful God gave her to me. I just wish i was smart, strong. I would know how to fix this.
Many thanks for your time.."

depression,fcbmeqf,t1_fcbih0t,1577588536.0,"Omg, gratitude for letting me know! If i lost her then i would go on a rampage to find her. Sure i would die trying. I love my dog, she's 5 she was the only one i could save from my abusive husband. He killed my other babies. I was lucky to get her back."
depression,fcb7lp1,t1_fcb71fl,1577583404.0,"I have been looking. But maryland has no shelters that will take dogs.

I would live in my car."
