fatlogic,fgj19qg,t1_fgiuvgz,1580835065.0,"I'm 5'2 and 120 pounds, and people look at me like I'm nuts when I say I wanna lose 10 pounds. At this point, alot of my weight is in my boobs, and it's painful/expensive to have them. 30/32 DDD bras are hard to find, though it's a hell of a better time than trying to find the 32H bra I needed 35 pounds ago.
Also, when I briefly dipped to 117, my mom kept forcing me to eat even when I wasn't hungry and making my sister check on me if I was in the bathroom for more than 5 minutes because she thought I was anorexic or bulimic, which is rich coming from the woman who's in denial about her emotional eating habits."
fatlogic,fgj07w7,t3_eyqgxm,1580834494.0,"Lmao, my sister is 5'10ish and is 210, and is overweight (working on getting her weight down, and gaining muscle), what makes these people so deluded as to think that being simultaneously shorter and heavier than my titan sized sister is perfectly healthy and normal?"

fatlogic,faiobqj,t1_fah0bjo,1576112710.0,"But let's be real, that's the start for many people who have to teach themselves how to eat right. Swapping regular soda for diet, telling yourself to put away the cookies, saying no thank you to the doughnuts your well meaning coworker brought in. Little diet changes add up, and add up quickly. Baby steps into the lifestyle change that has to happen for major weightloss."
