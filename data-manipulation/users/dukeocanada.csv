UpliftingNews,ff72m26,t1_ff71mg7,1579639873.0,It's about the concept of incentives though. There have been a number of studies on it.

AskReddit,feup6nl,t1_feuokt2,1579388705.0,True. I guess I shouldn't compare the fight for fundamental rights to the occupy movement considering the 2A is so much more important than whatever occupy was trying to do.

politics,feu8prk,t3_eqmp6d,1579384248.0,"The idea and suggestion that the rally in Richmond is prepared by ""white supremacists"" is a full on perversion and smear job of the media to demonize firearm owners. Will there be racist people there, of course there will be, because those disgusting people will take advantage of any situation. 

But any right-minded gun owner who is planning to be there (which will be the majority) wants nothing but a peaceful protest and will do anything and everything to keep it that way. Any sort of incitement or wrong-doing will be disowned by those who are there to do nothing but ensure their voices are heard by the government. 

The author of this article utilizes terms and associates them without any sort of context, lest it takes away from the ""conservatives are racist"" narrative. 

We give the benefit of the doubt, why can't it be the same on us?"
