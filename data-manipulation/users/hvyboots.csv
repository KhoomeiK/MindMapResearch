Second off, if this *is* a spiral bound book, you need to build and lay out the left and right design masters separately to stop this effect. On pages where items are supposed to go across the spread, build them as a left and right element meeting in the middle and then drag the pages apart when you lay them out such that each alternating page is a spread unto itself."

HumansBeingBros,ffs9rna,t3_euwfen,1580176606.0,"Man, I had an experience like this. Supermanned into a wash right at sunset, lined up everything perfectly to smash the top of my humerus flat, and the *very last* mountain biker through the park showed up like 3 minutes after my crash. He walked my bike out and I gimped the two or so miles back to the trailhead and then he drove me and my bike to my folks house, which was pretty near the trailhead. Would have been kind of screwed if he hadn't come because I don't think there would have been any way I could have pushed the bike out and gotten myself out simultaneously. Let alone drive a car anywhere to get medical attention."
aww,ffrigbf,t3_eupxdq,1580158647.0,"I befriended a yard cat the same way once, lol. For a couple weeks I would see him flee the yard and stare at me suspiciously from the wall until one day I meowed at him. He was like, ""Oh you speak cat! Why didn't you say so in the first place!?""

Proceeded to jump down from the wall and trot straight over to me. Showed up every day for months to be petted right as I got home from then on, lol. (Pretty sure his owners moved away eventually—he would have a collar occasionally until he could ditch it again.)"
css,ffr73iw,t1_ffr6sd5,1580151882.0,"Yeah, but given the choice between just adding Bootstrap and defining it universally for all browsers through there or tweaking a bunch, I went Bootstrap. Appreciate the input, though! It's always good to learn new tricks!

(Also in my particular case, the website is just being served locally as a front end to the functionality of a Surface Pro being issued to students so everything serves at SSD drive speed via a local instance of IIS and ease of updating elements far outweighs any concerns about how ""heavy"" the package may be.)"

And then if you want to install Windows onto it also, use the Bootcamp Assistant, which will partition your HD with a second Windows partition and install Windows into it for you."
simracing,ffr61j8,t3_euqraz,1580151229.0,Bought one in like 2013 and it's pretty awesome up until you want to start strapping a gearshift and handbrake onto it somewhere.
