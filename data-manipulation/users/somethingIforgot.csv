This meant that when the control rods increased reactivity and caused the water to start boiling, the bubbles created by boiling water further increased the reactivity of the core. There were several layers of problems that contributed to Chernobyl - something of a perfect storm."

AskReddit,felgt65,t1_fel8dov,1579221829.0,"I really really fucking wish more people understood this. Why are tomatoes the only ones singled out? What about peppers? Pumpkins? Cucumbers! Green beans? 

I've explained this to dozens of people, but I still hear people parroting it frequently without really thinking about what they're saying."

AskReddit,fdswc15,t1_fdsvvel,1578708787.0,"She decided to just throw away everything expired in the kitchen. It was very upsetting. She also threw away apple cider vinegar and canned food.

The white distilled vinegar was the most upsetting though."
AskReddit,fdsnsz3,t1_fdsn4ng,1578705631.0,"That's pretty interesting information. I've only had the float test fail once with eggs that were roughly 6 months expired.

But I know in a lot of countries they aren't typically refrigerated. It's just how they are washed in the US that (supposedly) requires them to be refrigerated."

It's really a stupid amount of overkill."

He should not be in control of our military."

I think he's just an idiot though, as opposed to being unwilling to change."
