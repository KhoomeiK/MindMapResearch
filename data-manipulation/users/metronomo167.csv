I’m all in for saving the planet, do you want to live in a jungle or do you want an advanced and civilized world who happened to know how to get energy from reusable sources?

La mia critica non solo era volta al lato umano, che evito di voler approfondire in quanto futuro medico e si spera, futuro psichiatra (vedere che posti su r/depression mi fa passar la voglia di infierire)

Bensì era rivolta alla mancanza di fonti scientifiche delle vostre asserzioni. Pretendete di capire cosa sia la biologia, la fisiologia parlando di ormoni e pretendete di capirne qualcosa degli aspetti neurofisiologici e psicologici, quando le uniche “vostre” fonti non godono di revisione paritaria e non hanno consistenza da un punto di vista epistemologico.
