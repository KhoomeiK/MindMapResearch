AmItheAsshole,ffc2hry,t1_ffbpcms,1579789896.0,"It's not clear if it was international or domestic adoption, but it's pretty explainable either way:

- domestic adoption, they just adopted whatever baby was available first regardless of race. Makes sense that none would be white, because unfortunately white babies tend to have waiting lists. 

- international adoption, they went with whatever country had the easiest laws at the time. Most primarily Caucasian countries are hard to adopt from, so it makes sense the kids would be a different race, and if laws changed in between kids or they had an awful experience adopting from one country, makes sense why they'd switch to a different country."

I hate my job, but have no idea what I'd rather be doing. Haven't had a dream job since I was 9 and was told I was already too tall to be a jockey."
AmItheAsshole,fepgqxx,t1_fembjlp,1579320078.0,"Based on OP's post history, this is either made up or he's the son. If it's the latter, poor kid!"
AmItheAsshole,fepf7lf,t1_fenihza,1579319002.0,"My mom has always been ""naturally thin"" (her appetite matches her activity level) and at 50 is still a size 4. According to his logic I don't have to worry about my weight at all! (Spoiler: I was overweight for several years and had to lose 50lbs to get to my current healthy weight, and I'm still heavier than my mom)"
fatlogic,fekwunb,t1_feizj9f,1579209255.0,"And this kind of thing happens to thin people too! My sister is very slender and had to get surgery on her jaw last year. Well, turns out the abnormality that made her jaw need surgery also made her throat super narrow, and the anesthesiologist said she needed to reschedule so they could have child-size equipment on hand in case the adult throat tubes didn't fit."
AmItheAsshole,fee3kep,t1_fedykyc,1579025670.0,"I disagree, I don't think it's about narcissism or an industry pushing a narrative. It's about wanting the person you love to know what you like. 

My fiancé picked a ring that is so 100% perfectly me, and every time I look at it I feel super happy because it's a sign of how well he knows me. 

If he had gotten me a big square diamond ring or something on a gold band (or a bulky art deco ring, as in the post), I'd still have accepted his proposal, and I'd still be excited to spend my life with him, but I wouldn't get that daily shot of happiness when I saw the ring."
AmItheAsshole,fedn4wl,t1_fed6ewx,1579015568.0,"Exactly.

For example: My brother likes women with dark hair, almond shaped eyes, and golden skin. Speaking in stereotypes, a lot of Asian women fit this description, but so do a lot of Hispanic, middle eastern, and even caucasian women. It would make no sense for him to say ""I only date Asian women"" based on physical characteristics, so anyone who says that is almost certainly basing their statement on preconceived notions of what Asian women are like."
fatlogic,feamh23,t1_fdzgt3k,1578950288.0,"That's fascinating to me--I much prefer being depressed vs anxious. For me depression is just... numb, whereas anxiety feels like I'm doing everything wrong and none of my problems are resolvable and everyone's going to hate me when they find out what a loser I am and everything is overwhelming."
fatlogic,feajr4v,t1_fe0do4u,1578949655.0,"Hey just wanted to say it's definitely possible that the next few lbs might come straight from your boobs!

I lost ~50lbs (210 to 160, 159 is normal BMI for my height) and barely saw any movement in my cup size. Went from 36J to 32HH. 

Lost another 5lbs, and suddenly--seemingly overnight--I was a 32G. 

Lowest weight I've ever gotten to was 145, and I was down to a 30FF. I could wear bralettes!!!

(Back up to 157 currently, but planning to get down to 135 eventually and hopefully they'll continue to shrink!)"
fatlogic,feah7xt,t1_fe4et5m,1578948685.0,"I'm not sure on the medical terms--it could be their issue wasn't technically under the umbrella of obstructive sleep apnea--but both my brothers had major issues with snoring and being unable to breathe while sleeping, and it ended up being their tonsils and adenoids. One brother was 3 and at a healthy height and weight when he had them out (and literally underwent a personality change overnight because he wasn't sleep deprived anymore), the other brother wasn't quite as bad but ended up having to get his out at 18, also at a healthy weight for his height (185lbs at 6'3"")."
AmItheAsshole,fdsl6yk,t1_fdshiri,1578704607.0,"But he said she only had to start working 3 years ago, so the kid would be at most 12 by now, right? I'm confused by the timeline on this."
Instagramreality,fdrzecg,t1_fdp63zn,1578691976.0,"My hair went from stick straight and dark brown to light brown/dirty blonde and curly when I hit puberty!

1500isplenty,fdquhvm,t3_emdbw6,1578675111.0,"Me too! I generally intermittent fast through breakfast and lunch so I can eat nearly as much as I want for dinner and still have a bit of room for dessert. 

But I have friends/family who get hangry if they go that long without eating, or who can't eat that much in one sitting, so different strokes for different folks I guess!"
loseit,fdqsx0s,t3_emqm32,1578674186.0,"For me-- I don't know if I'll ever really look at myself straight on in the mirror and be *happy* with what I see. I hope so, but I'm not counting on it. I'm ~60lbs down and I'm definitely *happier*, but I still see so many things about myself I'd like to change. 

But it really hit me when I caught a glimpse of myself in a large mirror out of the corner of my eye, and didn't realize it was a mirror for a second, and thought ""oh that girl is cute!""

Basically I'm overly critical of myself, but if I saw someone who looked exactly like me, I would never in a million years nitpick her appearance the way I do my own, and that's what I try to think about when I'm focusing on ""my thighs are flabby"" or ""my arms are still too big"" or ""my boobs shrank too much""."
fatlogic,fdnssct,t3_em00tr,1578592109.0,"One time some friends and I were pretty toinkered and decided we needed snacks, so we walked the ~mile to a gas station nearby. As we were leaving, there was a very large man out front who couldn't get back into his car because someone had parked too close to his driver's side door, and he asked us to help by pulling his car out of the spot. We were all too drunk to feel comfortable driving, even just the few feet in reverse, and felt so bad for the guy... Hopefully he found someone quickly, or the other car moved quickly."

fatlogic,fdgwzsh,t1_fdf0qe4,1578410397.0,"Y'all are blowing my mind right now because my fiance hates all sauces and condiments and salad dressings and I've always been so confused by it because if I cook chicken in the exact same ingredients as a dry rub he likes it, but as soon as it's a sauce he can't stand it. But maybe it's an aversion to the texture? Not entirely sure as he does like stir fry etc as long as I don't add extra sauce to his plate but it's something to think about."
AmItheAsshole,fddp0bc,t1_fddkvrq,1578320029.0,"I think it's usually a good place to start-- definitely never a *replacement* for a lawyer, but posting there can often help people figure out which kind of lawyer they need, or what they absolutely should or shouldn't do while waiting for their consultation, or whatever."
loseit,fdct9lg,t3_ekb849,1578283678.0,"Carrots and cucumbers, for me! They're both crunchy which is super satisfying. A whole cucumber is like 30 calories and it leaves me almost uncomfortably full."

bestoflegaladvice,fcv1vrv,t1_fctdtfm,1577992917.0,"Seconded. I'm a 32G as well (down from 36J after losing 50lbs) and while I definitely can't run without a bra on, I don't understand how they'd be causing back pain. (Shoulder pain yes, if you're wearing the wrong size bra and using the straps to support your breasts). 

Boobs don't actually weigh that much-- IIRC even 36J only averages about 3lbs per breast."
