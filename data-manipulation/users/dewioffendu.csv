stopdrinking,ffumw8t,t3_ev5mxv,1580245324.0,"So, here's what I did for my weight loss program and I lost 10 lbs in 2 months and 20 lbs in 4.  I'm a 5' 9"" Male currently at 185 so 20 labs is 10% of my whole body mass.  I'm smaller and look fucking  great compared to a year ago.  
Fast from 8:00 pm to 12:pm and cut out the carbs and sugar.  The first week sucks ass but once the weight starts coming off, you will not want that cookie or cake anymore.  Weigh yourself at the lightest time of the day.  Mine is post shit in the morning after a workout naked. I know it's cheating  ut I get every ounce off that scale and you'd be surprised.  The weight stopped coming off as fast after the first month but it's still coming off.  I eat what I want on special occasions and I don't preach about my plan because it's not that much of regiment. Make healthy food chance.  As for working out.  The beat way to lose weight is to raise your heart rate for extended periods of time. Walk more, try a short jog.  If it hurts, stop.  Don't kill yourself. If you fuck up and eat a  box of oreos, oh well.  Tomorrow's another day."

ChoosingBeggars,ffuj8r5,t1_ffuflnv,1580243116.0,I'm pretty sure my 8 year old knows that Santa is not real and is playing the Santa card thinking he'll get more gifts.  EOAS is the same thing.  They know it's fake but it's still fun.  Kind of like my marriage except it's not that fun.

science,ffqh6ea,t1_ff6idy6,1580134477.0,I dont think so much have grown as much as tightened.  I have this arguement with my wife.  She is scared that she will get too much muscle if she works out. I wish I had the heart to tell her that she is so overweight and out of shape that muscle definition is the least of her worries.  I've been hitting it pretty hard and barely have any definition that I notice.  I feel better and I'm not as fat so that's what's important.
