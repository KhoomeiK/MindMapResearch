insanepeoplefacebook,fc9f2mf,t1_fc7qddn,1577551726.0,"I think most people agree that a Christmas tree isn’t a religious symbol of Christianity, however, it very much is associated with Christian religious traditions. It’s great that your neighbors decided to make their own tradition around it. That’s not the experience of all Jews in the US. My own personal anecdote is my roommate’s girlfriend told me that overt Christmas celebrations (like trees being up in public places) is a constant reminder that she’s a part of the cultural out-group.

I get that there’s no passage in the Bible about Christmas trees. You can talk about them originally being Pagan celebrations all you want. But when someone walks past a Christmas tree in a department store, 10 out of 10 people will understand that that tree is meant to celebrate Christmas"
