AskReddit,ffif3rw,t3_et781d,1579972360.0,"Ordinarily I wouldn't give a shit having cast my presidential vote for several different political parties. However, I would have a lot more difficulty voting Republican due to the fact that every single one of them is marching right alongside trump. They have chosen party over country, and supporting that would be a tough pill for me to follow. They don't even speak out against his daily casual lying and juvenile behavior. They are more concerned about reelection than the American people. I would feel exactly the same if any other political party blindly followed a despot and would have difficulty giving them my vote too.


So I guess my answer is no. The Republicans have proven themselves to be 100% supportive of trump despite knowing full well what he is. If some of them had the courage and moral fortitude to speak out against what is happening then yes I could vote republican again. But none of them do. They've had a thousand chances the past few years."

However, they don't, at least I've not heard of any and voting records support my observation. Every member of the republican administration has been complicit. Sure, I bet there are some who dislike what is going on, but they continue to remain silent and to vote whichever way they're told. Party before country. This could have been a wonderful opportunity for republicans to stand up to the corruption, to stand up for the U.S., and to bring an OUNCE of dignity to the grand old party.

Let's try something the rest of the us in the world call ""critical thinking"". Say it with me now: KRIT-eh-kal THINK-ing. Here we have a self-described christian school in an extremely conservative state called Kentucky (ken-TUK-ee). Now, what do we know about a majority of christians in the southeastern U.S.? Well, we know the three things they hate the most: abortion, HOMOSEXUALITY, and any religion that deviates in any way from their fucked up interpretation of the teachings of jesus christ. They hate those things SO much that they often want to kill people who fit into any of those categories. Now.....we have a teenage girl who is having some REALLY mild rebellious urges that PALE in comparison to those of nearly every other student in every school in the country. Knowing what you know about christianity in that part of the U.S. and knowing what you know about teenagers, which do you think is most likely?

1. The girl's class skipping and barbershop visits were so inexcusable that she has to be removed from school before she negatively influences the other kids at the school who are doing THE SAME KINDS OF THINGS

or


2. The wingnut christians are aghast that a homosexual is in their midst and are making up bullshit excuses for removing her.
