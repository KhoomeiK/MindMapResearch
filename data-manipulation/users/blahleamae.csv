JobFair,fdog5ci,t1_fdoe7j2,1578604469.0,"Hrm. That is tough. Because 10 months is a long time to do something you can't stand. Have you considered doing food service or retail in between, just to tide you over? In speaking for myself, I did Starbucks in between jobs and that was great in terms of being hired IMMEDIATELY, still putting money in my pocket, while also providing me an ass ton of time to sit down and jobs search in earnest. People run for the hills when they hear ""food service or retail"" but you can def be strategic about applying in a lowkey area (in a retirement community, a ritzier area, etc). In N' Out where I'm in in CA, for ex, starts as high as $18."

AskReddit,fdoauze,t1_fdmxqbt,1578601874.0,Well. That opened up a box in my memories that was stowed away... \*flashbacks to all the Slade and Raven porn\* (my current interests in occult sex and goth shit now makes a little more sense lol)

AskReddit,fdl6hga,t3_elssvy,1578517868.0,"That the older you get, your body temperature raises and you overheat more at night. I used to barge into my parents room as a young kid when I'd have nightmares and they'd be naked a lot of the times. They always just told me to go back to my room but that's how I recall rationalizing their nudity lol"

JobFair,fdkmf3v,t1_fdjgegv,1578506579.0,"Try your hand at looking at an office services position (the better bet of not encountering an absolute demand for prior legal knowledge). That's how I got my start. Entered in absolutely COLD, no prior legal knowledge, as an Office Services assistant (strictly doing print jobs, mail, service orders, etc.). Transitioned into a Receptionist once I developed and expressed a more administrative interest (wanted an overhead view of the practices, get a hang of the jargon and lingo, and to see what practice I could tolerate working for haha). And after some time, I'm now a Litigation Assistant.

I can 100% empathize. I remember getting parents who were expecting me to parent their kid when that's THEIR job. You are not alone in realizing working with kids ain't for you. Mad props to people who take up that mantle but yeah, it's rough.

Personally, going from working with kids to the legal industry was a little serendipitous. Had no concrete direction post-college, a lot of ppl in my discipline entered education so I felt it ""made sense"" for me; was also not aware of the larger job market out there. But as mentioned, it didn't work out. In between trying to figure out wtf I was gonna do after I quit teaching, I got a job at Starbucks. One of my morning regulars was a Legal Assistant. When she learned I had a degree she encouraged me to apply to her firm. I was worried about me not knowing anything about the industry but for several entry level positions turned out all you needed was some decent proficiency with handling technology, solid social skills, and the ability to learn fast! So try your hand at applying! Who knows!"
TooAfraidToAsk,fdingky,t3_elg1a9,1578446826.0,Nah. I'm 24 and my plushies lightweight occupy more room on my bed than my own body lol. Plushies facilitate better sleep and prioritizing better sleep is a very healthy choice!
JobFair,fdiddxj,t3_elgmsp,1578440360.0,"Have you considered becoming a legal assistant/secretary? There are some entry level administrative positions if you wanna ease yourself into it. I know you said you prefer a hospital/medical setting but some firms deal in Intellectual Property and you still get some exposure to the STEM you studied in school. (The engineering and chemistry background of my fellow assistants seem to come in handy for them from time to time especially when they're supporting patent agents and stuff.)

I did a somewhat similar transition. I previously worked as an after school program leader for a middle school for 2 years. Low pay, very stressful. Wanted a regular corporate desk job because I was DONE dealing kids. I had a BA in English/American Studies. I wanted to get exposure and experience in the legal industry without becoming a lawyer so why not just work for them? Something to consider if it interests you. The ability to articulate yourself is always handy and your minor is helpful in indicating that."
starbucks,fdi8bv5,t1_fdhwad3,1578437543.0,Lol totes fair. Probs only funny to me and the partner in that moment. The hobo was making light of being a hobo and basically saying he typically wouldn't have access to ice anyway so why would he request ice water. It was one of those moments where I was amused to find a hobo joking about his situation like that since most of the ones I served as a partner were (very understandably) not happy campers.

SuicideWatch,fdhmira,t1_fdfhxlb,1578425801.0,"WOAH. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I empathized with the idea of not having a career. Suggesting someone ""do the next right thing"" was advice that brought ME great comfort and allowed me to reassess suicide as something that was NOT the only way out when I had the inability to pursue specific ambitions post-graduation. This was my form of ""non-judgmental peer support"" that I thought I'd just reshare to OP. It's fair for you to misunderstand me but I don't think I deserve to be called a ""massive piece of shit"". It's better to ask for clarification than jump the gun and telling me I'm telling someone to do something that has hurt a lot of us on this sub. (Edit: grammar)"

We were not close but his suicide affected me way more than I ever anticipated. I have these random moments where I just scroll through his dormant social media profiles. Don't worry if you can't articulate why either...I too cannot pinpoint why I do it or what it exactly does for me. Well wishes!"

SuicideWatch,fcy65au,t3_ejfifm,1578075294.0,How sweet! I forget how as a little kid basic stuff like crossing the road needed to be taught. I remember just screaming my ass off and running as fast as I could to the other side when I didn't hear or see a car.

SuicideBereavement,fcnmohv,t1_fcm0u7j,1577814408.0,"""Autopilot"" is a good word for it. Thanks for the reminder to allow the feelings to just kinda happen. This is the second loss to suicide of someone meaningful to me. The first time I held back and it was physically painful doing so. It relieved a huge knot in my chest not trying to keep it all in and just crying for my friend."
