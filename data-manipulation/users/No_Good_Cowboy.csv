Yes, you have basically a wild card in the VP. They can do or take on whatever you need them to. States and foreign governments can't tell them to 'pound sand' or 'this is out of your jurisdiction' because they represent the entire administration.

politics,ff6sn0x,t1_ff6h86b,1579634045.0,"[Here's a NYT article about what Joe biden did in Ukraine](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/joe-biden-ukraine.amp.html)

Here's an excerpt of that article.  

> A key to Mr. Biden’s relevance as vice president was his willingness to take jobs nobody else wanted. In early 2014, as others on Mr. Obama’s team raced to finish big-splash deals with Cuba and Iran, Mr. Biden told the president he wanted to take on three of the most unappetizing foreign-policy tasks left undone: containing the Islamic State, curbing immigration from Central America and keeping Russia from devouring Ukraine.

Now whether or not you think Joe biden performed well as VP in this instance his role was time consuming.  He went to Ukraine 6 times.  He's spent hours on the phone with Ukrainian officials and likely hours coordinating with his colleagues in the US.  He took on lower profile, but highly important, tasks that weren't on the Secretary of State's to do list.  

Foriegn policy is just one facet of the VPs job.  The VP is the president's personal representative.  It's a job that requires 100% attention and it can't be phoned in.
