I stare at this lake and get tunnel vision and suddenly the path I followed through the woods disappears. I’m on the iced over lake with this doe. This doe and I stare at each other and around us the seasons speed along.

When I got on the lake it was summer. When I finally turn my attention to my left a new path opens up for me. The doe has disappeared. I follow this path leading to who knows where (I’ve yet to find out.) The path feels very cold it’s not fall or winter, probably mid spring. I stop mid-stride and there in front of me is a buck. I stare at him and he stares at me. It then runs off into the sky followed by the doe I saw before.

TheLastAirbender,ff1oi4w,t3_eqyyg1,1579482667.0,"I find that the underrated parts are that you realize that Tae Lee and Mai are really just victims. 

After watching the series you realize that one of the most badass non benders has an existencential crisis because of her family and being used by Azula. When you first meet her you know without a shadow of a doubt that she only followed Azula so that the traveling circuis folk didn’t end up getting hurt. During the episode where they went to relax you realize even further that Tae Lee is just being used and abused for Azulas purposes. Even going so far as saying how beautiful Azula is despite seeming to know that that is not the case. (Did enjoy the small heart to heart they had which ended with a very awkward first date for Azula.) The bullying and stress comes to a head when she saves Mai and essentially the escapees, thus betraying Azula in a quick decision process. The part at the end also “made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside” (yes I did quote her from the aforementioned episode) because she finally found her place in the world with the Kyoshi Warriors.

Mai is seen as a no emotional non caring crazy woman. From the very first episode you get very little from her and she was just very annoying to me. You come to realize that trying to be the perfect child has made her this way. If she doesn’t obey Azula it would dishonor her family and there’s no telling what would happen to them. She’s trying so hard to protect them while at the same time trying to protect herself. The way that they showed her as just emotional enough with Zuko was great during that episode on the beach. You also got your first hint that she’s going to betray Azula for Zuko. She goes out of her way to confront Zuko for leaving. Then that battle was amazing, and I was really worried she was going to get hurt. (Real friendship is great.) I also really loved the jealous pissed off girlfriend scene at the end “Don’t Ever Break Up With Me Again.”

I actually wish that I had seen more of their friendship blossom before the betrayal to Azula. But after rewatching the series so many times you pick up subtle things here and there. 

I also wanted an ally to Korra to suddenly appear that looked like Tae Lee and use the Kyoshi Warrior fighting technique mixed with chi blocking."
