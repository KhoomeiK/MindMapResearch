politics,ffi0l27,t1_ffi0h2n,1579961410.0,Makes sense. Twitter is such an echo chamber now that I don't even use it. It's become a new 4chan with fake accounts and shit posts. Nothing there is ever really viral.
politics,ffhz9jp,t3_etks9x,1579960102.0,Is this how we are defining viral now? Media outlets publishing the speech so it is viral? Viral means it has widespread distribution by individuals on the internet. Not corporate owned media.
syriancivilwar,fffc2xc,t1_ffexaea,1579880674.0,Glad to see all the Iranian trolls are shitposting here today.

nursing,ff9uaox,t1_ff9t8ba,1579721488.0,Thank you so much for the advice! This is real helpful! My wife works for a private facility so no trauma but I may be able to shadow an operation. I've dealt with death and gore before so I know it doesn't bother me in the least.
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff9tupb,t3_esaukv,1579721154.0,Glad they filmed it. Same thing happened to me in high school and I suffered a concussion but there were no videos back then. Eyewitnesses corroborated my story so they suspended the kid but no criminal charges.
nursing,ff9remc,t1_ff9p2sd,1579719446.0,"That is really interesting to know about the loans! Thank you! My current employer has tuition reimbursement but it would only cover 9 credits per year based upon in-state tuition rates (which are really high anyway). At 9 credits per year I would be finished in... 6+ years!  
  
My mother was a psych nurse and my wife is a surgical nurse so I have a good idea about the job. I used to shadow my mom on psych wards (not that I would ever want to do that). Being a first responder, I'd really like to do something more intense like trauma surgery. Right now, I have a lot to weigh though as this would be a ton more debt to incur that I can't afford."
nursing,ff9bwrw,t1_ff9bpc5,1579709451.0,I received my Masters in December 2018 and I am located in New Jersey.
UnresolvedMysteries,fejlf34,t3_ep9yus,1579178857.0,9/11 worker here. The amount of fraudulent claims after 9/11 was mind boggling. So many people came down to Ground Zero claiming they lost family or friends there only for it to turn out they were looking for money/attention. I left in January 2002 but heard it only got worse down there as it was a foregone conclusion we wouldn't find anyone alive and most bodies were pulverized. If NYPD detectives charged everyone with a false claim they might have ended up putting 20 people in jail per month.

Pete_Buttigieg,fdw2f5w,t1_fdw1wd2,1578754319.0,Take my upvote. We should all have standards and not settle. That's how the GOP got Trump.
Pete_Buttigieg,fdw0hrz,t1_fdw06t6,1578753702.0,Booker is running not because he thinks he can win but because he is setting himself up for the future races (he probably thinks Trump will win 2020 and 2024 is his year). He also likely wants a spot on a ticket as VP to earn the POC vote.
Pete_Buttigieg,fdvzf9e,t1_fdvxz9d,1578753465.0,"Booker was a great propagandist. He stopped armed robberies, hung out with gangs, shoveled snow off sidewalks, etc. All of it made front page news here in NJ. As mayor though, he fundamentally changed Newark by removing anyone local from the bureaucracy and filling it with his friends and allies. A NYPD cop as police commissioner, corporate shills on commissions, etc. These people, like Booker, worked to build their own reputations off Newark and then as soon as Booker was gone, so were they. Booker himself was called ""the absentee mayor"" because he was often out gallivanting with celebs and other high profile politicians. Now, he is ""the absentee Senator"" and does the exact same stuff except on a state level.  
  
He did a few good things like lowering the murder rate in Newark and bringing in millions of corporate dollars for revitalizing some neighborhoods but when he was gone, the murder rate again skyrocketed and much of that revitalization has ceased."
Pete_Buttigieg,fdvxdxv,t1_fdvwlfy,1578752803.0,"Sanders and Warren have always has been only interested in increasing their personal wealth. They talk the talk but never walk the walk. Sanders makes these grand, progressive bills and puts them up knowing most will never even get out of committee. Why? Because he can say he is continuing to try and push progressive causes but the others are stopping him.  
  
He could make deals but why? He gets by on rhetoric. Go ahead and look up yourself how rich him and Warren have become since they have become politicians. It is disgusting."
Pete_Buttigieg,fdvv67n,t1_fdvuxqh,1578751824.0,"My state (NJ) is already going Democrat. Always has and will for a long, foreseeable future. I can rest easy not voting for either of those two scumbags."
Pete_Buttigieg,fdvunld,t1_fdthjci,1578751667.0,"As a NJ native, please don't. Booker was a horrible Mayor for the people of Newark and has been an even worse Senator. Even Democrats here don't like him and he'll probably be unseated next election by Hirsch Singh."
Pete_Buttigieg,fdvu8d2,t1_fduyoim,1578751572.0,"I am also going to disagree despite the downvoting. I will not support Sanders or Warren in a general. Not to say I will vote Trump either. I will just vote third party or sit it out. I will not look my children in the eyes one day and say, ""I went with the lesser evil."""
Pete_Buttigieg,fds6w1k,t1_fdrx457,1578695702.0,USPS has $120 billion in unfunded debt and obligations.
Pete_Buttigieg,fdqptfe,t1_fdqp2vj,1578672279.0,"[You are correct.](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/07/how-pete-buttigieg-would-boost-teacher-pay-077516)  
  
""We need to honor teachers like soldiers, and pay them like doctors"" - You don't need to pay me like a doctor but pay me for what I am worth. I have a Master's Degree and work with 140+ children a year that will go on to become nurses, doctors, engineers, police officers, firefighters, carpenters, masons, electricians, etc. I not only teach them but instill morals, civic virtue, care for them when they are upset, feed them when they are hungry, and find them help when they need it. In some cases, I am the only adult that ever gave a damn about them. I have to work 2 jobs just to make enough money to keep a roof over my own family's head and my wife has to work 50 hour weeks. Insanity."
Pete_Buttigieg,fdqohzz,t1_fdqagc0,1578671451.0,I made the same point in my post. Mom and dad in surburbia who have their own cars don't give a damn about public transportation in the city or the train that brings someone in their neighborhood to the city. I honestly wouldn't care much for spending on public transportation either being that I live in a rural area but my students are inner city and rely on it.
Pete_Buttigieg,fdqobed,t3_empmpt,1578671337.0,"**Our Competition**  
Bernie: $1 trillion in infrastructure spending  
Biden: $1.6 trillion...  
Warren: $10.7 trillion...  
Trump: $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, most has been held up in Congress due to disagreements over how to spend it.
  
**What I Like in Pete's Plan**  
* He talks about ""Resilient Communities"" which shows he knows about emergency management. No other candidate has even touched this but it is critical to reducing federal spending. Communities need to learn to be self-sufficient in a disaster and resilient to bounce back.  
* Roads & bridges are in desperate need of repair. Our infrastructure is a D- and for every 2 bridges we repair, 4 more need it.  
* Complete streets are very modern and very necessary in urban environments. (But is there room? Not likely.)  
* National broadband internet is great for low income households.  
* ""Protect against wildfires, including by recruiting 5,000 firefighters and fire management experts."" This will be needed more than most people understand.  
  
**What I Don't Like in Pete's Plan**  
* $150 billion+ for public transportation. Unless you are in an urban area, this is not popular and does not play well with the middle class.  
* $80 billion in grants and loans to repair classrooms and facilities but what about the vastly underpaid teachers? We shouldn't have to work 2 jobs to feed our family.  
* National broadband internet sounds like a big mess that would make the USPS look good. Censorship, illegal monitoring by government agencies and disgruntled workers, etc.  
* ""zero-emissions autonomous vehicle technology"" - Americans will never go for this. We like our freedom to drive our own vehicles."

Parenting,fddlh9c,t3_eknqoz,1578316796.0,"My toddler daughters have a love-hate relationship with it. They will sometimes brush their teeth just after a meal or snack because they know it is the right thing to do or just want a fresh tasting mouth. Other times, it is like wrangling a rabid koala.  
  
Our dentist is great though. She calls their teeth ""princesses"" and cavities are ""villains."" She has our girls convinced that they have to clean the princesses to keep the villains away. Most nights this analogy works well on them but other nights it is full scale war on dental hygiene."

todayilearned,fd40k8w,t3_ejwxed,1578163267.0,"A lot has changed. Growing up, my dad's career as a firefighter was seen as more important than my mother's as a nurse since he made more money. I was born in 1984 so this wasn't long ago. Today, I am a firefighting instructor and my wife is a surgical nurse but my wife makes the most money out of the two of us. She also works longer hours so Monday through Friday I have to be the one doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, taking care of the kids, etc. Dad roles have changed and it isn't necessarily a bad thing.
