gaming,ff3a0rs,t1_ff32n8q,1579537159.0,"Valid points friend. I will agree, I think the game succeeds the most in its writing. As for combat & travel, I'll agree too that these can become a problem when in excess! The trick is to use fast travel posts *whenever* you can & never fight random monsters you encounter while traveling. There is no need to grind levels or materials in this game, so fighting them outside of quests just ""wears you down"" mentally over time. As for the travel, I used to be a purist in the sense that I wanted to walk or ride everywhere in every game, for the realism. Well, what I've realized is this only really succeeds in keeping me from finishing the game. I too get worn out. So, if you fast travel (buy those vendor maps!) & ignore the random mobs, don't chase every ""?"" mark, and just speed from mission to mission the game has a much more enjoyable flow. For me, at least.  
  
Also, to stay focused on task, I will mostly do a quest from start to finish without interruption. That means even if there is a quest board right next to where I am walking, I will leave it untouched for the time being so that my mind doesn't wonder off to unrelated subjects & I can stay with the flow of the story."
aww,ff395ym,t1_ff32tc4,1579536630.0,"**Leg press:** yes! So long as you don't feel any discomfort, the increased range of motion is good for your progression. The other important thing to pay attention to with leg press (and all squatting type exercises) is that you are careful to keep your knees ""centered"" between the foot & hip joint, aka not moving the knees inwards or outwards (left or right). When your knees move in those unintended directions, the joint is actually *twisting*, similar to wringing water out of a towel! Far worse than if it were just bending that way as it appears. You can look it up, it is called genu valgum & genu verum. The other thing I'd add applies to all weight resistance activities... breathe out as you overcome the resistance, and breathe in as you return the weight to the start of the next repetition. Don't hold your breath until the rep is finished, breathe along through each rep.  
  
**As for the squatting girl**, as with most things in life it's fine in moderation. Stay in that position too long and your body will tell you it didn't like it. Yes... her knees are way beyond her toes. BUT... realize also she is not performing multiple repetitions of standing and squatting over & over. She's just in a rested position. The real stress on the joints comes when overcoming resistance, aka lifting weight (including her body weight) as she rises up. Do it from that position once & then move on with your day? No problem! Repeat that movement 10+ times, rest a minute, do 10 more, rest & repeat... well the problems will certainly come in the not too distant future. Our bodies are built to support us in these activities & positions, but when you're repeating them over & over while also increasing the weight resistance THEN she will find her joint health deteriorating. Also, note that when you squat you have 2 knees/legs supporting the weight, yet the lunge relies on just one, so it magnifies the issue."

The ant would achieve this seemingly impossible feat with the use of technology. We are not some stick rubbing rock throwing cave people. We are using technology to mass produce pollution. This pollution, in all its various forms, impacts other things like a domino effect, one ""thing"" pushing the next. So yeah, us humans living and breathing isn't the problem.

aww,ff2tzhx,t1_ff2t77h,1579524088.0,"Yes indeed, it could in theory wear your knee joint down as well! The foot placement on those machines will dictate this. Watch your knees (or those of someone else using the macine) and you will likely see that their knees are either extending as far out as the toes, which is ok, or are slightly behind them (even better). I'm not in a position to test this out for certain at the moment, but my initial thought is that with both feet flat on the machine plate, your knees won't be far out in front of your toes were you to draw an imaginary line between them.
  
Where people will get themselves into a harmful situation is when they are pressing the leg press with the balls of their feet, allowing their feet to place much lower on the plate then would be possible with their heels doing the pressing. I like to place my feet higher up on the plate, so that I can go through the full range of movement without compromising my joint health. Rewatch the adorable video again to see just how far his knees are extending ahead of the toes! Ouch."

For the average person trying to get into shape, static & walking lunges are similar enough, targeting mainly the quadriceps & glutes. I'm guessing you're more on the end of being an athlete or body builder, in which case you would want to explore a variety of exercises which target the same muscle groups in different ways. But for the majority of people who want to exercise, reading about lunges in /r/aww, they just need to know the proper way to do a few exercises to get them started & encourage a reduction to the risk of injuries.  
  
**Edit:** I neglected to address more of your ramblings, man. 

>force on knees and joints  
  
You do, and you will, receive this force on joints following my advice. You *do not* want excessive amounts of force on your joints, however. The further your knee moves forward, the more force transfers *onto* the joints and *away* from the muscles. We want our muscles getting most of the exercise.   
  
>press with your whole foot  
  
Ok, I can understand the confusion. Let's take a *step back* and first realize the majority of people doing lunges & squats etc allow their heel to raise off the floor as they press with the ball of their foot (& toes; you can see this demonstrated in the video!). By pressing with your heel, you are engaging the muscles you want to engage more effectively. I am not saying lift the front of your foot off the ground & balance yourself peculiarly. I'm saying let your heel be the main channel for the driving force, rather then the ball of your foot."

aww,ff2o1q5,t1_ff28990,1579515722.0,"*Highjacking to save some knees*  
  
When doing these lunges, be sure to keep your front leg's knee behind the toes (try to keep it more above the ankle) to prevent high amounts of stress force on the knee. It can cause injuries. You want the force on your muscles, NOT your joints (knees).   
  
Also, with your front leg, press with the *heel* of the foot, not the toes, while returning to the standing position. This engages the intended muscles properly.  
  
In summary, the man in this video does it incorrectly & will wear down his knees.  
  
**Pro Tip**: you can do these in one spot, without marching across an entire room. Rather then stepping forward, step your trail leg back, then return to standing position. This will both encourage your front knee to stay above the ankle AND keep you located in the same spot."
