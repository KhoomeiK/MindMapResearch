depression,ff8f4xa,t1_ff8elhc,1579675804.0,"Years ago yeah and it was as expected; little to no value. Paying a stranger to talk to me, who otherwise would have nothing to do with me, only to essentially tell me everything I have heard before or already knew, does not sit well with me. Especially seeing as I already know I will be advised to force myself to try to join a club, meet new people, start a new hobby, travel, get another pet, go to a gym, etc. What could being told these things do to help me? I already know what most people do to be happy and to move on in life. But none of it solves the root cause of my problems. Forgive me if I come across as confrontational because I know you told me to try a therapist with your best intentions, but I've probably read that question dozens of times by now. Similarly to how I've read and heard the same things recited by what a therapist would say so many times too. Hopefully you understand why at least to me, it all seems hopeless."
depression,ff85ova,t1_ff7ykje,1579666699.0,"I promise you that I genuinely wanted to meet that one person face-to-face but it just didn't happen. I remember everything that made me happy with them, and fondly so, but if anything it exacerbates the pain because I will always know what it was like to taste true love and happiness without any way to rekindle the flame that is lost. I would sacrifice everything that I have to be able to rewind time and correct whatever the causes to produce the effects that led me to losing it all, but I can't. You may be correct about my heart trying to protect me from the pain, but what seems more accurate to me at this point is that I am so acclimated to the pain that it's causing me to slowly forget what comfort and joy feels like.

Also, I don't feel belittled at all by your comment. Thank you for your kind words."

I've lost my best friend and the love of my life and honestly don't know what to do with myself. It's been two weeks since, and there are so many unanswered questions that haunt me but the one thing I know is true is that I truly deep down love her and therefore it is absolutely driving me insane that she's gone. I know that I'm easily replaceable as well... which makes it sting even harder. I'm so sorry for what you went through, I hope my comment at least helps reassure you deep down that you've got some other lonely people weathering the storm with you."

Would be so awkward to ask him  after not having spoken in years ""hey remember like nearly a decade ago when you told me and so-and-so about the time you fucked a fridge door when you were like 9 years old?"" but tbh I don't think he stole it from the skit because he genuinely was a pretty weird guy in a funny way, this wasn't even too unusual of a story from him compared to some of the stuff he'd say about his life back before moving to the US"

AskReddit,fe633ri,t3_enu36l,1578880698.0,"Back in like 2010-2011 I worked at a bar and one of the bartenders was a pretty eccentric and horny dude and we worked with a lot of female bartenders. We'd often times kid around and some of them were pretty close, innuendos and playful comments pretty often. Anyways I don't remember the context of this one male bartender telling me this story, but somehow we got into the conversation one very slow night when the first time we each masturbated and his story was hilarious. He basically said that when he was about 9 years old he got into the habit of fucking his refrigerator door to the point where it was difficult for him to not feel aroused whenever he opened it for years. I remember laughing and asking him ""how the hell do you fuck a fridge?"" and his explanation was that the cold air during the summer just felt all tingly and he was perma horny at that age, so he would close the door on his dick and thrust. Weird as hell but it was hysterical to hear that story at the time, especially because English wasn't his first language, and his accent made the delivery of it even funnier"

depression,fcvslh5,t1_fcvqel1,1578009168.0,"I obviously am rooting for you too, that's why I'm posting on your thread and trying to convince you to keep on... I see within you a genuinely caring individual that has had a difficult life and there are so many people who lack the same compassion and intellect that you have yet you still find yourself in a seemingly impossible to escape from bubble of despair. Well you know what, despite the fact that you may be alone, you're a good person and you will pop that bubble. You may find yourself in another one, and another one, and yet another one, but each time it happens you'll be more the wiser. Life is a never ending experience and I hope yours improves in all of the ways you want them to. Same with me :("
depression,fcvjm31,t1_fctvhc4,1578003488.0,"> On the other hand, you met a person like this that made you feel that way, is there a reason why you could never find another person like that who would make you feel like that again? Also you said you're life ''transformed'' when you met her, maybe you can check and see what changes you made yourself at that time and try implementing them in your life know.

I know it probably sounds silly but I am 100% fully confident I will never be able to feel this passion with anybody else, for many many personal reasons but the general gist of it is that if you believe in soulmates, well I know who mine is. I have experienced love so intense that it changed my world, and ultimately gave me the motivation I wanted to better myself. Sure I can and have dissected the ways that I've changed over the years, and one of the conclusions that I've come to is that ever since early childhood I've struggled with self-confidence and making my own decisions without hesitating. I tend to be a very calculated overthinker, always have, and it can be both good and bad. From that it's obvious that I don't like pure independence, I want independence but yet in many ways I want to depend and be depended on as well, because again I'm the type of dude who just craves love and affection. I want to give it just as much as I want to receive it, if not more.

Also take it from someone who is also a very logical kind of thinker... sometimes things just can't be rationalised. For example, being in love is irrational. That doesn't stop me from craving it and being completely driven by it though. Life itself is illogical, but it's something you have, and it could be taken away so very easily. We will all lose our lives inevitably one day no matter how much we try to protect them, so what's the rush? As long as there's even a tiny fraction that you could one day discover true happiness, you may as well stick it through dude. No one knows the future with absolute certainty, and it's possible that you could be completely blindsided by something wonderful."
depression,fct2lc3,t3_eioypk,1577931239.0,"I know what you mean man. I've tried to rationalise that so many times and the truth is that ultimately what it comes down to is that I am a person that's always clinged to close relationships with others, and craves love. Whenever I'm left in isolation is when I am suffering greatest, and right now that is exactly what is going on. Honestly I have upset so many people by trying to reach out to them in desperation to try to have my perspectives changed, because deep down I know that it's not *right* to want to die. It's definitely seemed logical because if you're suffering, you hate yourself, and you hate life, then why live? Why continue to suffer? 

I met one person that completely blew my mind and transformed my life. I loved her more than anything. *Anything*. Still do. I'm all alone now though. I don't have any idea what to do with myself. I can relate so damn well to the thread titles I see as I scroll down this subreddit, especially one that came up as ""I wish I could just give my life to someone that actually would want to live it"" because I'll be honest, I really don't think there's much of any hope for me. I'm turning 30 soon and have not a single person outside of my mom, brother, and my sister which care about me still. Sure, there might be a few people that would feel bad hearing about ""the bad news"" provided I'd pass away but in all reality I have just about no impact on anybody's lives anymore and that makes me very sad and feel worthless.

But that aside, I'm still alive. I may feel like it makes no difference either way if I exist or don't exist, but I'm still chugging along with the wish that for once, life would turn in my favor and I could have what my heart desires. I would feel slightly better to know that somehow my comment here lets you know that despite the fact that you and I live entirely different lives with no overlap, I've heard your story and relate to you in a lot of ways. If I can keep going despite my misery, you can too. Maybe one day we won't suffer anymore."

relationships,fcj2xop,t1_fcj1vwe,1577675947.0,"Okay so what if someone hasn't had any longterm relationships until they're 30. Does that mean they have to spend years dating different people before settling with someone? Also what's the big deal if a couple survives from high school to their late 20s or whatever and decide to get married. There are people who *do* date many different people before settling down and getting married to someone and they *still* go through divorces. I don't know about you but I only use statistics about this stuff as reference points and don't let them warp my judgment. If a couple works out really well, they both love each other, feel confident in each other enough to settle down, then that's their decision to make. No one should be dating people only because they're ""supposed to"" be, they should be only because they *want* to be."
