skiing,ff849dl,t1_ff7vqyc,1579665582.0,"Not to sound cynical, but pole plants are the least of most people's problems in the bumps. I see many people saying they need to focus on plants while their legs are stiff as a board and/or they try to ski fast between the bumps.

I still like to have the poles for some added stability and/or timing, but that's a secondary skill that comes more naturally once the foundation (aka doing stuff correctly from the waist down) is in place. I just fear that people that learn bumps with empty hands will struggle to add poles. It's easier to say ""Ok take that pole you already have and tap it. Now tap it harder. NOW plant it for real!""

Again, though, there's textbook and there's what's right for each person. To paraphrase Mike Tyson, everyone has a plan until they get hit. The difference between ok skiing and really good skiing is what you do when you ""get hit"". Some people freak and jam their poles in by instinct, and wind up cartwheeling. Those people shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a pole! Most people, with practice, are able to use the poles to get/keep their sh-t together. There's no right/wrong, just different."

Some people that prefer no poles in their personal skiing will use them during lessons/training drills as an aid (crutch is maybe a little harsh) and then leave them when they go out to just ski.

My experience comes from personal skiing as well as PSIA clinics and exams where the clinicians/examiners have required me to demo well timed plants, and when I'm doing that I definitely see/feel that I'm at my best. When just skiing rather than doing demos or drills, it's just my preference."
