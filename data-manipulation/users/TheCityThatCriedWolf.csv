Theatre,ffz7cqh,t3_ew0nn0,1580366258.0,"Please don’t take this personally, but I have no idea what you’re talking about. When you’re performing on stage you’re expected to have control over what words you’re saying and not. I would argue this isn’t exactly high expectations. In fact, I expect the people I ride the subway with to not randomly say out loud random words that occur to them as they plumb the depths of their own regrets. If people do start randomly saying words I tend not to make eye contact. 

Perhaps it is possible you have a form of Tourette’s syndrome, in which case, I apologize if I’ve been insensitive. But even then you may want to specialize in a form of performance that is not reliant on verbal communication like instrument playing or dance?"
Theatre,ffz6zss,t3_ew0nwc,1580365940.0,"It’s tricky. You know what they say, one bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. 

That being said, I think if you do think you have a good shot of getting the role you want and you’re a little squeeked out by possible racial inappropriate casting, I think you have a lot of reason to decline and take your chances with Shrek. This is entirely dependent on your own self evaluation, but it seems clear from your description that it’s not so much that you doubt your ability on the shrek from but asking is it wise to turn down a sure thing. 

Go for the one you want. Be circusmpect and thankful when declining the role. You may very well want to work with them, or people associated with that production again. The worst that can happen is that they don’t cast you and you wind up not doing either, but considering your history with the organization and that you’re clearly in demand they’ll probably offer you *something* even if it’s not the role you want, and again you’re under no obligation to accept that either.

puzzles,fftc72w,t3_ev37h5,1580216104.0,"For me, what makes crosswords fun and doable is that there are multiple points of entries. Whether it’s American style (in which letter is part of an across or down word) or cryptic (where it’s every *other* letter) the format gives people chances to solve or guess words and then use the crossing letters as clues to help solve additional entries. 

In this puzzle the majority of entries only intersect one other word, and considering they’re all fairly long words having only one letter to help you (assuming you’re able to solve the other word) is not much help at all. 

I’m assuming these are supposed to be cryptic clues, but for the life of me I am having difficulty figuring out what kind of mind reader I’d have to be to solve them. But I may just be stupid."

relationships,fft9rre,t1_fft959g,1580213670.0,"Okay, well here’s my take. 

If this kind of physical treatment is just normalized in your culture then i wouldn’t Blake your sister too much, however regardless of your culture if you explain to her how much it upsets you and explicitly ask her not to do it again, and she does then you need to set your foot down. 

You talk about forgiving people for all kinds of abuse and behavior and likewise you expect to similarly be forgiven for any bullshit you do. But that’s not healthy to my mind. 

If someone is abusive or mean or just unpleasant to me, whether I’m related to them or not, I’m going to make it clear that they either apologize and promise never to do that kind of stuff again, or I’m literally cutting them out of my life. 

Life is too short to put up with other people’s bullshit and you shouldn’t expect other people to put up with yours. Treat other people with the kindness and respect and maturity that you would want to be treated with. And learn to expect the same from others. You deserve it."

Theatre,ffsu2i7,t3_ev0h0e,1580192501.0,"It completely depends on the director. There’s no standard answer. I know for myself I definitely want to see what someone’s base accent proficiency is before I cast them in something requiring that accent. But the artistic director I work with feels *strongly* the opposite way, and feels that auditioning actors get too bogged down trying to get the accent right and lose focus on actually being in the scene. She always requests actors not use accents during auditions, though has had brought in a dialect coach during callbacks to independently assess actors base skill level, and also ability to tame accent notes.

relationships,ffsrbmj,t1_ffsqby6,1580189695.0,"Of course. It is sad. However... I’d advise you that not all is lost. You just have to exercise two things: 

1) Patience. If you love him as much as you seem to, then give him the space and freedom he needs right now. You’ve already been through a lot and while it probably seems disastrous right now, you guys are still super young. There is no need to rush this. I know you’re getting antsy but if you can find it within you to be patient with him, then please exercise it. 

And 2) 

You’ve been putting a lot of planning  and importance into this relationship. It’s where you’ve put a lot of purpose into your life. While you’re giving your boyfriend time to figure out his passions, it’s time to branch out and discover your own. 

What beyond having a family excites you? Is there a creative outlet that you’ve secretly wanted to explore but never had the time or energy for because you’ve been too busy setting up your business so you could be financially set for your upcoming family? Are there places you’ve wanted to visit but haven’t? Maybe you want to start thinking of your business less as a means to an end, but as an end itself? 

Things don’t always work out. Things do not always go according to plan. If you set up the whole meaning of your life in one basket then you’re likely to get shattered if things don’t go exactly as you want them. You need to diversify where you yourself find meaning, outside of this relationship, outside of plans for children. Meaning is something we sometimes have to discover and make for ourselves and to invest yourself too deeply in one thing isn’t healthy. You need to have multiple avenues of joy and purpose. Maybe volunteer work or activism or maybe writing a book? Whatever inspires you and makes you eager to get up in the morning, regardless of whatever’s going on with your boyfriend, that’s where to look. 

Think about it this way: when you do have children, which passions do you want to share with them? You need to explore and develop them yourself before you can enrich their lives by sharing that passion with your child. 

You’ve got this. Best of luck."

relationships,ffspnfi,t1_ffsosj4,1580188137.0,"I see. Gotcha. Yeah, that sounds like a really unpleasant situation. I totally understand both of your perspectives and it sounds like after eight years of being in a relationship you want a long term commitment from him and you’ve been expecting him to have those same priorities. 

But he’s also in his early twenties and while it’s extremely impressive you’ve accomplished so much at such a young age, most people at that time of their lives are still figuring things out and want/need the freedom to pursue those opportunities where they take them. I think he’s within his rights to want that too. 

The truth is you want to settle down and he’s clearly not ready to make such long term commitments, which frankly at such a young age isn’t unwise. 

The question you have to ask yourself is: is he worth it for the lack of relationship security he’s going to give you? Would you be willing to do long distance again? It’s obviously not what you want but you’re never going to change the fact that he’s still figuring out what he wants to do with himself. If you pressure him or “force” him into not pursuing those opportunities you may get what you want from him in the short term but you’re also sacrificing his own self-discovery journey to make *you* feel better. 

I’m not saying you’re unjustified for wanting what you want. I think you have extremely reasonable expectations, but those are expectations for someone who has built their lives and career around the stability of creating a future family. That isn’t where he is. That’s somewhere he might end up in the future, maybe even near future, but until he has the opportunity to experience and explore those options he’s going to be dissatisfied.

That being said, I think you should start at the very beginning. There’s a reason this game launched a thousand spin offs. It’s not as smooth as some of the later entries but these games are all about the writing and humor and mysteries and that’s a consistent high point throughout the series."

The idea of movement or pleasure had not been covered."
