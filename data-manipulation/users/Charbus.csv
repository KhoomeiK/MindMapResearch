When I was selling my 911 I was getting nasty emails telling me I was downplaying the issue on my Ad. If you have a preference facelift model the chance of failure is 3% per LN engineering.

MitsubishiEvolution,ffb6kjh,t1_ffb6emt,1579753154.0,"The RE71R doesn’t grip till hot, so it’s an autocross tire essentially but when it grips it grips HARD and doesn’t let go even when it’s worn down.

It also overheats pretty easy, more for time attacks rather than consistent road course lapping.

R888 is illegal in SCCA if that matters to ya

they’re probably not a good tire for you. Try Dunlop Direzza star spec"
