todayilearned,ffz0stn,t3_evwpbp,1580360328.0,"I call bullshit.  I had an angelfish couple that laid eggs on my aquarium's filter.  They'd take turns guarding them from the other fish.  Eventually, George the giant plecostomus caught whiff of them and quickly gobbled them up.  That night, the female angel jumped out of the tank to her death.  The male survived for many years but remained a very unhappy fish."
oculus,ffyywfu,t1_ffxsh9z,1580358750.0,"Not sure if you have control over this, but it would be helpful if there was some smoothing/lerping of head motion when aiming, especially when zoomed-in.  The sniper rifle missions are difficult, as even the tiniest head motion gets amplified when you're looking down-scope.  (Lerping between current and previous frame rotations mitigates this nicely.)

Also, if there's a way to disable the random camera sway during cutscenes that would be wonderful.

I love the work you've done here!  Thank you so much!

Rockstar, you need to hire this guy for his initiative and ability to get things done!"
DataHoarder,ffqiwh8,t3_eung4g,1580135849.0,"I'd re-encode.  The extra space will give you room to make more videos.  Presumably, your future videos will be better and of higher quality as technology improves.

That said, given how cheap external drives are, I'd just make it ""policy"" to buy them as needed and never again waste time considering ways to squeeze-out a little more diskspace."
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffqhp9l,t1_ffqf5pl,1580134901.0,"They try, but the birds are usually too fast/clever.  

I watched gators stalk a mother heron and her child for hours once, just waiting for an opportunity to strike.  The mother was vigilant while teaching the baby to avoid the hidden creeping dangers, similar to a human teaching about cars and crossing the street.  Since they live in close proximity their entire lives, they've learned each other's limits, and thus the gators don't waste much energy trying.  (They occasionally do succeed, however, just as cars do.) Herons eat baby alligators, too.

Also, they often fish together, which is to their mutual benefit."

ipad,ffox1yl,t3_eub6ml,1580082834.0,I've used a Standzfree in bed with my iPad Pro 12.9 for years.  I tuck the feet between matress and boxspring and swing it over/back.  It works well for the price.  https://www.standzout.com/products/standzfree-universal-1
ipad,ffh533h,t3_etlbx6,1579923343.0,"I had LTE on my previous iPad and rarely used it.  Wifi is everywhere these days.  Also, AT&T used to allow you to toggle their billing on/off as needed, but disabled that feature 6 months into my contract, so I was in no hurry to give them more money.

So, when I bought my Pro I decided to skip it.  Haven't regretted it once.  (I can use my iPhone as a free hotspot if necessary, but find I never need to.)"

television,ff3ktan,t1_ff2xslb,1579543172.0,"You're not alone on Dracula.  First two episodes were amazing (8.1 and 7.7 respectively, but I think they were even better than that) 
 but the final episode was a different, and not very good (5.1), show.  Here's the ratings graph:

Another Steven Moffat failure, it seems.

That said, if you haven't seen it, the first two episodes are MUST WATCH for any Dracula fans!  I found it to be the best portrayal of the book to date!"
