MadeMeSmile,fdgho1j,t3_ekwdyf,1578397219.0,honestly as somebody with a young face it took me a while to realize that this was supposed to be sweet and flattering and not a prank because stuff like that feels demeaning sometimes

insomnia,fdg298v,t3_el4145,1578377342.0,"I totally get that frustration, hearing the same solutions that haven't worked for you from people again and again feels defeating and even obnoxious sometimes.
