teslamotors,ffvkm2p,t1_ffrtiqy,1580266331.0,You should try doing it in reverse! Lol. Let me know what the final resolution was. All my reading on this suggests replacing or refitting the pads will do the trick.
teslamotors,ffsh6ey,t1_ffsfzbj,1580181609.0,"You’ve obviously never had to deal with Tesla service. I have, many times :)
Edit: dear Tesla fans, you realise many people have had the exact same experience as me right? I’m glad some of you love Tesla service, but I’ve never really had a satisfactory experience, and I’m pretty easygoing."
teslamotors,ffrxjc9,t3_euwk3f,1580168149.0,"Good for you man but just put your head down and keep going. It’ll feel way better when it’s not even a big deal to pick up a Tesla, instead of blowing all your savings to do it."
teslamotors,ffrx27z,t1_ffrwofl,1580167826.0,"But, what else can you do beyond that? Tesla service is likely not going to do anything, you’re not going to change the brakes, you’ve already tried to clean them, the only thing left is to change the pads. Best of luck."
teslamotors,ffrvdp4,t1_ffrtiqy,1580166702.0,Just change the pads if it’s really driving you nuts.
teslamotors,ffrszib,t3_euvt5d,1580165152.0,Turn off regen completely and do some hard braking from high-ish speeds. This fixes it on other cars with disc brakes. I think because the Tesla barely uses the brakes the pads don’t stay as clean and smooth.

teslamotors,ff28tj6,t1_ff27h0j,1579497175.0,"So, you’re going to choose avoid looking a little neurotic over taking possession of a 40-60K car with issues? Who cares what the salesperson thinks, you’re not inconveniencing them in any way and I’m sure they’d understand if you’re nice about it. I wish I had done the checklist, would have saved me a ton of hassle."
teslamotors,ff01n9x,t3_er1c9b,1579464223.0,"LR costs too much more given you don’t care about the range. It’s such a massive upgrade over a gas car that i think you’ll just get used to what you have and love it anyway. RWD is totally great in the snow, I’m in Toronto. Also I reco waiting for the Q4 earnings call, they may drop the prices as they’ve done in the past."
teslamotors,feybnsh,t1_fex2vyo,1579443353.0,Do you have a Tesla? You’d be surprised what “quirks and features” they have on pickup. Personally I feel that when buying a $40-60K car one should take a moment to check it out.
teslamotors,feybga7,t1_fewrbgp,1579443257.0,Do you feel you are owed something?

todayilearned,fejpdpu,t1_fejizu9,1579182390.0,Exactly. I can’t imagine having held out past 20 or 30 grand.

todayilearned,fej1coe,t1_feiyr13,1579153365.0,"Thank you. I agree. It only bothers me because I am materialistic, and think about all the things I could have bought. But really, I live a great life and couldn’t be much luckier :)"
todayilearned,feix7xg,t1_feivx1d,1579149706.0,"Yes. When I remember it, my knees begin to tremble a bit on the inside and I feel like I’m going to pee a little. I feel like I’ve just been violated by a ghost. The worst part is, this is 1 of 3 times this has happened to me in my life with various investments, but definitely nothing of this magnitude."

teslamotors,feeuvy2,t1_feeevj7,1579041727.0,Exactly. I wanted to say this too.

teslamotors,fedf1t1,t1_fecy5mg,1579009748.0,Lol I usually turn off the auto lane changing because it sucks anyway
teslamotors,fecu03l,t3_eohmhi,1578984559.0,"Not worth it IMO. It’s cool but it’s better to buy it when it’s more developed, despite the higher price point down the road, because at least it will be clear what you’re paying for. I would have rather taken that money and bought Tesla stock!"

Edit: oh dear god, just read your story. No judgment, I promise, but that is the CRAZIEST story!!"

teslamotors,feaoyzu,t1_feamq5g,1578950932.0,"I think people are misunderstanding, you are just placing a deposit online. Once done, you will work with the local rep to find a suitable car. This was my experience."

teslamotors,feajl7w,t3_eoa7oi,1578949598.0,"Very strong opinion—get the 3. Test drive both and it will be much more obvious. S is dated and long overdue for a refresh. You are correct on being left behind with the tech on the S, for the most part. I’m sure people will elaborate much more than I have but it’s a no-brainer for me."
