lexapro,ffh36gk,t1_ffgvjes,1579921858.0,"Well I’m not a new user of lexapro , I just took a hiatus for several months and so that’s why I felt inclined to continue my regular dose of 15mg . I take it at night, does that make a difference in my sleep ?"
lexapro,fffl04i,t3_etczp5,1579886236.0,Yo I literally keep waking up at random times every night so far and it’s so annoying ugh
lexapro,ffal5rg,t3_esgmud,1579738499.0,I was going to ask about the libido ! Pls tell me if the sex drive goes back to normal lol
lexapro,ff7xkwh,t1_ff7wc8x,1579660750.0,"I stopped because I would be way too tired to finish my homework and submit resumes for my internship class. Basically gave 0 fucks about my senior year of college. I was able to socialize and “date” tho lmao. The withdrawal was pretty smooth, I was on 15mg the whole time then took 5 mg for a week or so before stopping. just felt a little dizzy for a few days but that’s it."
lexapro,ff7tpul,t1_ff7sz9q,1579658132.0,Thank you! And that’s great to hear xx
lexapro,ff7rnuh,t1_ff7ox85,1579656706.0,What MG are you on? I gave up on lexapro bc it made me too lazy in doing my schoolwork ironically. Now I’m back on it (15 mg) after so many months so I hope it actually does something for me :/ I need to be more socially outgoing for the job I have or else I will suffer :(
lexapro,ff4mh0u,t1_ff0x5og,1579567181.0,Same here!
lexapro,ff4mf6f,t1_ff1hhe2,1579567144.0,How long until you regain your appetite? I can’t finish my food and it’s stressing me out
lexapro,ff4mc0k,t1_ff1evyf,1579567082.0,I really hope this happens to me bc I have a weak ass appetite and been trying to gain weight for the longest time .
ARFID,feivu3z,t1_feetcau,1579148600.0,"Omg... this is me. I kept telling myself that I could never get a boyfriend bc of my weird eating habits/disorder. I have huge social anxiety of going on stereotypical “dinner dates”. I was put on antidepressants and I felt that helped with my fear of eating in front of others but had to get off due to other reasons. But eating in front of boys I like is a huge NO which is so embarrassing to say.     I also am seeing this guy I really like, but I keep stringing him along since he asks about eating together.... I wish I can just snap out of it but I can’t so I resonate with you :/"
ARFID,feiv1jd,t3_enykgc,1579147975.0,Literally every time I am (forced) to go out to a restaurant I can never finish my food and end up saving it for home consumption. I believe this stems from social anxiety and fear of eating in public. My throat closes up and gag reflex is at an all time high. Do u feel you have social anxiety?
depression,fei2rcl,t3_ep4bw6,1579129005.0,I resonate with this on many levels But u gotta realize the depression is making you think like this
socialanxiety,fefqlhl,t1_fefnxr7,1579062388.0,"Thank you for the motivating words. This really helped , along with the convincing of my mom. I’m going to get back on my antidepressants ASAP which has been known to help my appetite issues. I’m just so used to running away from my fears bc my self image has always been so low. The eating disorder issue just makes it a lot harder to dismiss since everyone sees eating out at restaurants a normal ‘social’ thing"
socialanxiety,fecpzc0,t1_fecm7f0,1578980426.0,"I try my best but tbh I have too much trauma , my only way out is to take meds but I don’t have any rn just cbd"
socialanxiety,fdrl9ke,t1_fdran1i,1578686166.0,Bruh This was me .
CBD,fdje0nn,t1_fdiz2f0,1578466897.0,"Thanks for the detailed reply! I do wanna try sticking with Lazarus because they have a really good reputation and reviews. If I do go with the isolate, will I feel the effects as quickly as the full spectrum tincture? I only weight like 100 lbs so I feel like I don’t need much of a high dose. I just need something effective enough to keep my anxiety at bay when I start my office job."
CBD,fdirjoe,t1_fdi7gte,1578449442.0,Not a guy but ok weird flex
CBD,fdhfcvy,t1_fdhf307,1578421465.0,"Yes me too, I’m very very picky about finding the best quality cbd brands so that’s why I went with Lazarus. I’ll prob just end up getting the capsules when I get paid"
Anxiety,fdhbex8,t1_fdgdy33,1578419362.0,"The one I tried is from Lazarus naturals French vanilla flavor and it’s way too strong in flavor, almost a weird medicinal taste. I mixed it in with oatmeal and it’s still making me gag a little bit but a little less. I’ll try the Nutella. 

I feel like I should’ve just gotten a flavorless one."
OnlineDating,fcz2xdi,t1_fcz181o,1578092585.0," ironically I went through very similar situations many times...even recently, I think he isn’t in the mood to talk. This is a sign that you should fall back and do your own thing . Whether he’s the shy type or not, He’s clearly not putting in much effort and you sadly u can’t force someone to reciprocate the same energy :/ and if you guys are friends on social media just post yourself living your best life without him imo lol."
relationship_advice,fcw3n4p,t1_fcw3ha2,1578016390.0, Because I’m trying to see if he’s willing to meet up or reconnect since he was in town... but apparently still getting mixed signals
relationship_advice,fcw3f3m,t1_fcw0btf,1578016239.0,But the thing is I knew this person irl and had a good friendship with him
relationship_advice,fcw3cc5,t1_fcw1xtf,1578016186.0,"Yeah I mean I just gave it a shot, guess you win some you lose some"
Tinder,fcssktb,t1_fcsieie,1577924046.0,I think it gives us a feeling of “closure” knowing we follow old friends/acquaintances on social media just to have them there in the background. I’m not sure how to describe the feeling though but it feels like its mandatory to follow almost everyone we meet on the socials.
socialskills,fcp4wxd,t1_fcohavv,1577850574.0,"Preach brother, preach"
lexapro,fcp4pq3,t3_ei8zu4,1577850394.0,"To be honest, I don’t think the fatigue will go away until like 2-3 months of taking lexapro consistently. You reallly have to push your body against that feeling. In my personal experience, I couldn’t deal with it bc it was making me lazy about my schoolwork so I had to taper off or else I’d fail."
Indiangirlsontinder,fckewse,t3_ehkhdu,1577723794.0,Psycho much
Tinder,fcke8xd,t1_fck7win,1577723367.0,Lol yes they do?
Tinder,fcke669,t1_fckcr8k,1577723316.0,Lmaoo and I highly doubt any girl would even bring up reddit in the beginning of a convo
socialanxiety,fckcsod,t1_fcjs483,1577722431.0,I was on lexapro for a while and that didn’t work out. I always thought about trying Xanax bc I’m at the verge of giving up on finding remedies. So Nice to know it does something for you
Tinder,fcjltw9,t3_ehi2wd,1577692992.0,She sounds dull anyways
socialanxiety,fc463i9,t3_eg0uc7,1577407616.0,"I too have noticed that when some people claim they have social anxiety , it doesn’t seem as crippling as they make it out to be. I think it’s a subjective thing."
