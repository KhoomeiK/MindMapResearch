politics,ffe9osr,t3_esunnk,1579840571.0,"This is so true and I saw it’s effects in person. 

My father is a hardcore Trump and Fox News supporter. I know, I know...I can’t believe I’m 50% made from his genes at times. 

But my point....I was visiting him last night and of course he had Fox News on,..... So we started “discussing” Trump/trial and he made comments about what Schiff had “said” ....my father said that Schiff had said: “Bc Trump stole the 2016 election and will probably steal 2020, democracy doesn’t work bc we can’t trust our elections. He didn’t believe in democracy and democracy can’t work.” 
Father said Schiff used the word steal so many many times, that it’s obvious the impeachment is to get back at Trump for winning. 

What!?!

Just bc someone is corrupt and cheats a system doesn’t mean the system is wrong/bad (might mean it needs work or better safe guards but that’s a different discussion). it means the person is bad/wrong. 
If someone gets drunk then steals and wrecks a car, it doesn’t mean the car was broken/bad and no one should be allowed to drive. It means the person that stole and wrecked it was being bad and shouldn’t be allowed to have a license,, etc.

Fox News/ Fuck Carlton did another bit, while I was there with my Dad, about how Biden said we should pay illegal immigrants reparations for the harm we’ve done to them. And they showed a short clip of Biden speaking at a town hall style campaign stop. Carlton was outraged, saying Biden said we should give them money. 
Biden didn’t say we should pay them. He said “reparations” in regards to how families have been split up and we as a nation need to “make them whole again”, in regards to working to get their families back together again. He didn’t mention monetary reparations 

Reparations is usually associated with money but it’s definition: making of amends for a wrong one has done, by paying money to OR *otherwise helping those who have been wronged*. That is what Biden meant.

Fox has a amazing way of twisting things into attacks on specific values/beliefs that their base audience hold and believe the left threaten....like democracy, gun rights, religion, etc. it’s the ultimate in fear mongering."
relationships,ffdwoqv,t1_ffday9x,1579830792.0,"Let me first say that the children’s safety is paramount and I’m in no way encouraging  putting them at risk. if she doesn’t feel right about it and feels something is off, don’t hang out with him. 

But...

-she has known this guy for a very long time, has he ever given her other moments of concern? 
-just bc he likes her kids doesn’t mean he is harmful....maybe he just enjoys kids. She also works with children, so it’s a bit far fetched to use that as an example of his potential to harm them.   
-would she have thought it weird that he was tickling her. daughter if she didn’t know he had a tickling fetish?
-he said he has fetish for tickling adults sexually.....doesn’t mean he is attracted to Kids. People have all sorts of weird fetishes but doesn’t mean they would hurt a kid. 
-if someone has a foot fetishized are they not allowed in shoe stores?
-kids most always say stop when they are being tickled....unless she was yelling or seemed distressed, it doesn’t seem odd to keep tickling IMO.  (It’s really depend on the situation. My little guy loves being tickled, he laughs hysterically, then run away and run back for more...while saying don’t tickle me. So it really depends on situation. I 100% agree if a child says they don’t want to be tickled or to stop tickling them, their wishes should be respected. My point is just that many kids will be laughing and enjoying tickling while saying stop.)

It’s seems very extreme to consider contacting his work or anyone to share this info. You could ruin his career, life, etc.
-if she doesn’t want to be around him, don’t. But making an accusation based on that one experience is wildly inappropriate.

Edit: Was responding to multiple comments so please don’t take this as me targeting your comment specifically.

I can’t stress how serious and important it is to me to keep our/all kids safe and I don’t want my comment to be misconstrued otherwise, 
Also don’t want to see a persons career/business to be destroyed because of an false allegation or rumor. It’s better to be safe than sorry for sure, so if she’s not certain he’s safe she shouldn’t risk it."

He has  never puked on any other beds or furniture....obv pukes pretty regularly like most cats do but it’s like he held it n went to her for revenge....

He’ll still be able to be around the family but not in a way that will creep anyone out and the majest n power of a big oak tree is a much more comforting story to tell his little ones about as they grow n learn the story of their father. 


I’m so sorry for your current circumstances and the possible loss of your husband n father of your christen. That is incredibly hard to handle and process.

Your pets are part of your family and you would feel so horrible and guilt ridden if you went through with getting rid of Henry. 

And if he honestly cares about your feelings, he wouldn’t want to put you in a position to choose between your cats and him OR want to risk you being sad after you got rid of one. 

If you honestly think he could harm your animals then you need to stay where you are and not move with him.

HappyWoofGifs,fdorr8t,t1_fdnm4xl,1578611425.0,"Ok, clearly my comment was sarcastic and in jest, bc it’s ridiculous that anyone is saying this baby is obese or being poorly taken care of. 

This is a BABY, an infant. It’s probably around 10 months old. Usually people would be worried about a baby being too skinny at that age before worrying about it being too fat...bc it just doesn’t happen unless someone is force feeding it or giving it only sugar water or something crazy like that. This little dude probably is still on a formula and limited soft food diet. 
Yes once they are up n walking, eating solid foods, drinking juice, etc. if they are fed a poor diet high in sugar, carbs, fat, etc. they will prob get fat or even obese. which is very wrong and I agree with you that it can negatively effect the rest of their lives. 

But Babies are almost always chubby around that age. Some may be more so than others but With all the growing they do in the first 2 years of their life, that baby fat is burned up as they grow, learn and become more mobile. Unless their parents immediately start feeding them poorly; which unfortunately plenty of people do feed their kids constant junk, soda and fast food, which has led to the over weight issues we have with a lot children in the United States.......just not babies."

I was laughing n throwing up at the same time. (Obv he was ok and got extra loving in cuddles for the trauma) 

He also insist on watching the toilet vowel flush as the water goes down. He’ll come running from the other side of the house if he misses someone using the bathroom and hears the plumbing kick on. It’s hilarious when new people visit and are interrupted by a cat charging in...if you put the seat down n he can’t see he whines.

He also, plays in the closet in the bathroom when I’m using the toilet. He’ll find things in there and bring them out to me. Like the random dropped Q-tip or hair tie, etc. by the times I’m done I’ll have a little pile of random things sitting on the rug next to me."

I think sometimes he understands more words/verbal language bc he reacts to all sorts of comments and is conversations. And fed knows when we!re talking about him. 

The one thing that I think speaks to the fact they are somewhat tone based in their understanding...my husband was quite ill recently and had a very bad case of laryngitis so he sounded like nothing like himself. Howie man was scared of him for the first few days he was sick...after that he seemed to adjust but he was fed thrown off by the change in tone.

He is not worth your time. Break up with him and move on. Lesson learned from this chapter of your life...you're even stronger now for living it.

Like set the table, empty the dishwasher, straighten up her toys, etc.. age appropriate tasks....be fair. 
Also, have her donate old toys when she is getting new toys...great opportunity to talk about those less fortunate and how she can help make a difference. 
Also, your wife not allowing her to act that way by putting the toy back and saying she wont have her crying when some kids get nothing...was a good start in showing actions have consequences. Follow through with a simple explanation once she has calmed down. 

Next time she begs for a toy she has to have, explain to her that she didnt take care of the walkie talkies she ""had to have them"" as well. So this time she is not getting the toy bc you think she needs to think about what she wants and how taking care of her things is important. She can earn this new toy by doing x.

Obv she is 7 n deserves toys just bc she is loved and is a kid. So dont go overbowrd on the earning things. Little seeds of knowledge and encouragement will go a long way.
