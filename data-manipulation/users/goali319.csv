dating_advice,ffawo5y,t3_esgag2,1579746226.0,"“beauty is in the eye of the beholder.” everyone often forgets how subjective the entire concept of beauty is, so they constantly judge the choices of others based on *their own* standards. so a person they do not personally find attractive could be amazing to another, which is exactly your case. 
as others have said, do not let others influence your thoughts. you *know* who you like and why, they don’t. dont justify yourself to people who only criticize and belittle your choice."
