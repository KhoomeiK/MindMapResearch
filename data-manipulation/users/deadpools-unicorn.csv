badwomensanatomy,ffhbado,t3_etbweg,1579928663.0,Short version: “I don’t like that women have mood swings due to hormone fluctuation so I made up a bunch of crap to make women feel bad for something they can’t control.”
AskReddit,ffh6cpo,t1_ffgpz82,1579924347.0,Fair point
LifeAfterSchool,ffgke6t,t3_et5fnu,1579908254.0,"I definitely do. I was hanging out with two girls my age last night and we are all in vastly different places in life and took different paths. I have a degree, I’m unmarried, no kids, and my job is moving me several states away from home. One of the girls also has a bachelor’s degree and is married and has purchased a home. The third girl is married with two kids, but they don’t own a home, and her husband works a good blue collar job so she can be a stay at home mom. I thought by now I’d have my degree and job (so, check) but also be married with a house and a dog, and working on a family. So far I just have the dog, the degree, and the job. It’s not so bad but I’m not dating anyone and likely won’t be married before I’m 30."
AskReddit,ffgjx7y,t1_ffgjss4,1579907943.0,"I think it depends on the profession, but you’re right. I’m a woman in a STEM field and a lot of times I am told I should apply because being a woman will give me an “edge.” That’s more what I was referring to."
AskReddit,ffgjqu5,t1_ffgj3g9,1579907827.0,"Lol, you’ve caught me! Anyway, I just mean to say that we should support each other. It’s not right that we expect men to speak up for women (referring to #heforshe) but we don’t do the same for men. And I’m sure that the situation isn’t nearly as black and white as my statement makes it sound, at least I hope it’s not, but sometimes it seems that way."
AskReddit,ffgjj9t,t1_ffgir52,1579907689.0,"I’m a biologist, so I am familiar with the evolutionary value of the sexes, but you’re right, it isn’t relevant in society. I think the reason we have those things happen is it’s maybe part of our biology and we have to actively work against it to create equality? I’m not sure. But I personally don’t like the elevation women get. Getting a job just because you’re a female applicant vs getting the job because you’re the best candidate regardless of gender is honestly not a good feeling, and, it hurts well educated and well qualified men, which doesn’t help anyone and hurts society overall, especially if the man is the breadwinner in the family. Everything is just so backwards, it’s a shame."
AskReddit,ffghdi0,t1_ffg3ann,1579906267.0,"That seems so backwards. Why can’t we just take care of all the people, not just the girls? Boys and men are people too and somehow that gets left behind and it’s awful."
AskReddit,ffgh8d0,t1_ffgcdea,1579906174.0,"I’m a girl but I’m not like that, and I won’t shoot you down for your gender. If you need to chat with someone, I’d chat with you!"
Iamactuallyverybadass,ff86y46,t1_ff6bm1p,1579667741.0,"We have them out here in the west as well, and the coywolves are supposedly out near the Grand Canyon. We were out looking for our small (7 lb) dog last winter when he went on an unaccompanied adventure and even as an adult I was concerned about the coyotes. The packs run right behind some peoples houses and come into the neighborhood often, even by the houses not on the edge of the neighborhood. Their noises are spooky. Anyone that is attacking the dad for killing the coyote know nothing about coyotes."
AreTheStraightsOK,ff4xvte,t1_ff4xpy8,1579575079.0,"That’s great! And parents are always learning, too. I hope that now that the fourth kid has taken off, the parents relax a little, like yours did."
AreTheStraightsOK,ff4x9ro,t1_ff4wj5h,1579574652.0,"I have none and I’m kind of jealous. And I think some people do great with big families. In my personal opinion, the family with 9 kids that I know isn’t a family that is accepting of individuality, and I don’t think that’s healthy, especially with so many different individuals. Your family is likely very different and that’s great."
AreTheStraightsOK,ff4rpsn,t1_ff4omse,1579570841.0,I know a family with 9 children. The oldest 4 have fled their home city to get away from their mother and attempt to forge their own lives. The rest are carbon copies of each other. It’s shitty.
