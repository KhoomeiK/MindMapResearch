aww,ffiz5zj,t1_ffixz67,1579986327.0,"6 out of the top 20 posts currently on aww are reposts, Not sure what your point is that is how r/aww has always worked. There is no rule about reposting on aww anymore and before that the rules was 2 weeks before it can be posted again just because you are a mod doesn't mean you can abuse your position. If there is no rule against it I am not in the wrong even if you don't agree with reposts it's no against the subreddits rules. Most of these people don't use reddit daily and haven't seen this content before."
