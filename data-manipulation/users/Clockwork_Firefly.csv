musictheory,fffz99y,t1_fffwkdy,1579895044.0,"It really depends on the context and the genre, but two tools that are often helpful are chord classes and avoid notes.

The first one can be helpful when thinking about the overall structure of the piece and is most important when looking at cadences. For example, if a phrase ends on a V, you're going to be dealing with a half-cadence, and that defines a lot of how the music flows. Using another chord with dominant function (such as a vii°, a iii, or a tritone substitution) will often fit more naturally than if you used, say, a tonic chord. Not that you can't or shouldn't, but you need to realize that choosing a chord with a radically different function at a cadence may change the structure of the music in a way you'll need to be careful about.

Perhaps more importantly, you can narrow down your search by considering what chords would clash with the main notes in the melody. Any note a half-step above a chord tone (e.g. an F over a C major chord, or a C over a B chord of any type), will cause a lot of dissonance, and you *generally* don't want the strongest melodic notes to sound that unstable over your chord (with the exception of some tensions in dominant chords in Jazz)."

todayilearned,fdm05wl,t1_fdlxdte,1578536672.0,"That's a very interesting response! I'm not sure I fully agree, but I think some of the disagreement comes from a difference in understanding of science.

""Bracketing off"" certain beliefs, so long as they are about the nature of our universe, is precisely the kind of tension I was talking about.  Claims about the world as a gift, whether talking about a literal claim about the mechanics of creation, would still fall under this purview.

I am using a fairly strict, kind of priggish definition of science maybe, so perhaps that's causing some confusion.
