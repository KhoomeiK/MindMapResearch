This is the kind of build ive always wanted. Now its here. Cable management could be a lot better and its really bugging me. Runs warm 45 idle. Planning to try eco mode this week. Ive read some air coolers also hitting 45 so... i may consider switching to air later on. Having to remove the radiator and awkwardly place it on something so it doesnt stress the tubing... not fun to say the least. Have not tested anything yet though.  Cheers"
