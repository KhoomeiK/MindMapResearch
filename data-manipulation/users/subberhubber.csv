AlexisTexas,ff9yel3,t3_esgp35,1579724182.0,There's no point in buying someone's content if they have a ton of better free content in my opinion. From what I've seen her onlyfans and the like seem to just be occasional non risky nudes and sometimes she plays with her pussy. Meanwhile you can find videos of her getting ass blasted for free

ufc,ff4lf5b,t3_ermf86,1579566451.0,Jones isn't as much of a personality and he's scared to play the bad guy role so he plays the fake choir boy singing Christian songs and acting like he's a good little boy because he doesn't like to be painted as the bad guy. Mcgregor relishes being painted the bad guy even though he's now shown us he can play the good guy pretty damn well too. It's just showmanship

Marijuana,felaphq,t1_felabz5,1579217771.0,"Well I just ask thinking that maybe someone in a legal state spoke with their therapist about it and got a straight answer.

Being high isn't what makes me feel better and cbd literally fixes the same issues for me marijuana does.. I think I'm looking to deep into it. I do that with everything I feel like lol.

Thanks for your 2 cents though, I appreciate it."
Marijuana,fel9dcy,t1_fel9992,1579216913.0,"It's illegal where I live. I'm 25 and my ""therapist"" is a social worker who would just love to have a reason to get me in trouble. I'm just going to fuck off with asking people lol."
Marijuana,fel99mo,t1_fel6u2i,1579216846.0,"Mainly I wanted to ask the opinions of people who don't have a biased against it seeing as it's illegal in my state and therefore my therapist obviously is going to say it's a problem.

My main question is, am I soothing my symptoms with an alternative to anxiety/depression medicine, or am I creating a whole new problem for my self?"
Marijuana,fel8ox1,t1_fel6u2i,1579216477.0,I'm saying is it alleviates my anxiety and depression symptoms. I wouldn't exactly call that it causing grief in my life. I'm just saying I use it a lot and don't feel normal if I don't use it... But I didn't feel normal before I started using it in the first place.

depression,fekht0b,t1_fejmubq,1579200332.0,Yup! But life isn't completely meaningless. Just mostly. But life being meaningless is okay. That's the point of life. You don't have to have some greater mission. Just survive until it'd your time to go.

I'm sorry I don't even listen to local news most of the time because they are fear mongers.

I hope you don't end up going to a war bud. Do anything you can to hang on to school."
depression,fejhjnp,t1_fejffh0,1579174540.0,"Thanks for not diving in dick deep. Maybe try lsd one day though. LSD makes me feel like I'm losing my sanity while I'm on it. It has an antidepressant feeling for me but it's the day after I did it not while I'm on it. The next day it feels like someone hit a clear cookies and cache button on your brain... But if you have depression your cookie folders going to fill up again fast. It doesn't feel like a fix. Shrooms on the other hand just feel like bliss to me. If you micro dose shrooms it will feel like a medication. Idek if you can microdose acid. Of course you can but.. Idk what it would do for you.

Good luck friend."
depression,fejhbup,t1_fejfnkq,1579174258.0,"Not saying it's good for everyone it's a sort of mask. I started smoking to have fun, not knowing it would make me feel... Normal. I micro dose but the feeling of not feeling that way I usually feel is so great it gives me something better than getting high because I'm use to being in fight or flight mode. I think my issue might more so be anxiety than depression tbh."
depression,fejh7yj,t1_fejfnkq,1579174114.0,"I smoke marijuana and also use low potency cbd. Marijuana isn't legal where I live and I can't afford strong cbd.

I feel like there are constantly knots tying in my brain and the knots tie knots and their knots tie knots.. I don't know if that make sense but when I get intoxicated in anyway it untied the knots. Marijuana keeps me in control, gives me an appetite back, and maybe the joy is kind of fake but it's joy and I don't get joy out of being the normal brained me."
depression,fejh2vi,t1_fejg8ck,1579173926.0,You have a point haha
depression,fejf895,t1_fejex0o,1579171294.0,This is why I'm scared to get medication. I self medicate with marijuana because of it and I'm not sure it's helping.
depression,fejf0wy,t1_fejd60k,1579170985.0,"LSD is a really fucking intense drug dude. You don't want to start with it I promise. And LSD fucks with your head and can sometimes make you worse. Please try shrooms over LSD. I have depression and I've done both but to be fair I had worked my way up to LSD with drugs I probably should have never taken.

I self medicate with Shrooms and marijuana/cbd. My brain always feels like it's tying up in knots on top of knots on top of knots and if I do ANYTHING that alters my mind including things that are bad like alcohol the knots untangle and I can think and my head stops hurting. Sobriety isn't for me but neither is being out of control on hard drugs and alcohol. There's a haply balance and it's micro dosing weed and shrooms for me but everyone takes this stuff different. Some people have negative effects.

Please don't dive into LSD. I've done it. It's so fucking intense you want to at least be familiar with some form of tripping first. If you insist on doing it try shrooms first. Shrooms are like a less intense version of acid in a way... Not really but kinda to me."
depression,fejeq6i,t3_epfy1y,1579170528.0,I'm so thankful I have my girlfriend. I take showers but I mean she knows how I get. She does my laundry and cooks for me and usually does most of the cleaning. She knows it's not just me being lazy I just feel hopeless.. But when she does those things it kind of puts me in a better place. Clean clothes and a full stomach even if you forced the food down and didn't feel like taking a shower always feels better than three days without a shower. I literally have a mental change when I shower though. Showers do a lot for me mentally. Maybe showering more often will make you feel better? Sorry my advice sucks.
depression,fejejyj,t3_epg6d9,1579170266.0,"It sounds like you're in love with the idea of being in love and not in love with a person. No one wants to be a fill in slot so you have to first distance yourself from thinking you need to find someone just for the fact of finding someone.

Make friends with the sex you're attracted to but don't try to push anything on them if something clicks it does.

Dating isn't easy anymore. All anyone wants is a quick fuck and you're not in high-school anymore so networking with people your age is going to be harder.

I believe in you just please remember ""don't fall in love with the idea of falling in love, fall in love with a person""

It's not fair to the other person if you're dating them just to be dating someone.

If you re looming for someone to date just for the fact of wanting someone to date then go download tinder or grindr or whatever fits your fancy friend. Good luck."
depression,fejebop,t3_epgee5,1579169920.0,"Why choose that deadline?

Suicide is selfish. You're not ending your pain you're giving it to the people who give a shit about you.

Imagine having a kid sending them through school and to pay you back they kill themselves, how much of a failure of a parent would you feel like? You really want to do that to your family? 

How about you don't be selfish and fucking keep living for the people who give a shit about you and try to find purpose.

I mean what's the point in finishing school if you don't plan to do anything with your degree?

Only assholes commit suicide.

Life starts when you finish school and become an adult and start carving your path and you're not even going to give it a fucking chance.

You need to read a book called tears of a tiger. Book literally made me realize how much of a selfish asshole I was for wanting to kill myself and shit on what my parents invested in me. They're good people who don't deserve that.

If you're not willing to live for yourself live for the people who care about you. 

I'm not sorry if this sounds harsh either because being harsh on myself on the subject is how I broke the cycle but I do hope you find a path and you find peace."
depression,fejdylr,t3_epgic1,1579169372.0,"Being a teenager is a confusing time. Mainly emotionally.

Not impossible you have a chemical imbalance but it's hard to say when you're a teenager because all teenagers are a bit imbalanced because they're coming to age becoming an adult it's confusing and your mind and feelings and views on everything around you is changing."
depression,fejdvyh,t3_epgk37,1579169261.0,Well I mean obviously you know why you're having issues with keeping friends. You stop talking to them. If you want friends talk to them even if you don't feel like it. A stranger isn't a friend and if you distance yourself like that you become a stranger and you can't expect other people to pull your weight in the friendship. You have to make an effort.
depression,fejdqr0,t3_epgnrw,1579169044.0,"Best case scenario you love someone forever and then what? Either you have to watch them die or they have to watch you die and there's nothing either of you can do to stop it. That sounds miserable to me and I personally think it might be better to be alone.

But if you're really that in need of it then go download a dating app or something. Don't fall in love with the idea of falling in love, fall in love with a person when it happens. Just have friends of the gender you're into and eventually you'll click with someone. Don't rush it. You can't force love and if you do it will fail 100% of the time."
depression,fejdkt2,t3_epgopu,1579168798.0,"I think the purpose of the human race is to destroy the world. The world has a way of evening itself out. For example at one point the world was covered in trees so dense nothing else could really happen or grow so termites came about and cleared the world out so the rest of life can start.

We're the termites. We're killing the planet. It is our purpose."
depression,fejdegd,t3_epgs1j,1579168530.0,"I feel you. Life's pointless. I'm 25 and I've already lost 7 friends. I only have two left and they hate each other.

But I'm still going to live it. I should probably just get medicated and I'll be fine but I'm scared of pills. Two of those friends who passed were from prescription drug abuse."
depression,fejcyux,t3_epgtnt,1579167865.0,"Saying things like you don't want people to care about you and that you don't want to exist sounds like suicidal talk. You might want to call a suicide help line I'm not sure reddit can help with that.

Hope you get better."
depression,fejctow,t3_epgufx,1579167646.0,"It sounds like you're not happy at home. You should move out and start living life for yourself and stop trying to get your parents approval. You're an adult now and it's time to make your own path. It will make you feel better about yourself and give you a sense of purpose to get out on your own. I had the same issue with my mom I just didn't cut myself. I moved out and realized all my time was starting to be taken up for work and when I got off I just wanted to relax and unwind from that bs day. Eventually my mom who never really showed me compassion found herself being proud of me for getting out and taking care of myself and she even grew to miss me. She use to be extremely mean to me. Insulting, threatening, putting me down, now she is extremely nice to me now that she doesn't have to see me her grown child at her house every day. I wasn't a child and I was still playing the role for a few years, I think that made her disappointed in me. I actually left home at your age. I'm not saying it will help you I'm just saying it might it certainly did me. I know it's hard and scary but it might be time to spread your wings, leave the nest, and chart your own path. I hope you find something that doesn't result in you going back to cutting.

You're not allowed to own guns here with that sort of thing... But you're obviously not in the US since you're talking euros.. What country are you from that has a draft every year?

depression,fejc6nk,t3_epgz43,1579166676.0,"Mushrooms are a much much better option than LSD. LSD doesn't always go a good direction for people who have mental troubles.

If you're going to use drugs as medicine you need to micro dose them. You will still get the benefits of the weight coming off your shoulders but won't trip balls.

I can't promise any of this is a good idea. If you ask a therapist about using any form of drug that's illegal in the area they'll try to take the easy way out of what your problems are and say it's the drugs.. At least in my experience."
