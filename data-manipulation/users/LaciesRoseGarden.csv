I ended up finding some other friends who genuinely respect me. It’s not a squad but I can approach them individually if I feel like it.
wholesomememes,ff6xvqm,t3_ervset,1579637139.0,I had a friend like that once. She dropped me after I stopped being useful to her.

Philippines,ff5g49b,t1_ff59oy8,1579591370.0,"They can prolong their life with the medication that they can afford, and not to mention, they still have the OPTION to make healthier lifestyle choices because IT’S WITHIN THEIR BUDGET. 

The poor struggle with getting enough income for medication and the transport expenses to receive health care. And not to mention, the poor are more likely to live and work in more dangerous environments that can be fatal to them, if not put them into debt if they have to pay for the medical fees. What they get lucky with is that they either can’t afford to buy more food or more unhealthy food (desserts, fast food, etc), or that it’s just difficult to get unhealthy food in their area anyway (pretty likely in very rural settings, and in places where vendors feel like there won’t be a market to sell to because people wouldn’t be able to afford it).

The poor might be healthier because they have no other way to live, but the rich brought their health problems onto themselves because of their own lifestyle choices."
