offmychest,feoal07,t1_fenyj9c,1579297359.0,"Thanks, that was helpful and interesting! I usually    send only a few applications in a month, and not even that if there are no good jobs. I got to interviews fairly easyly a while ago, but havent been in those since August.

I do apply also for jobs that aren't necessarily my field, but I get discouraged when I don't even get to interview state. It's like what's the point? The city I live in is also pretty difficult place to find job. By Finnish standards, it's pretty big but here's also university and other schools. Which means there's plenty of competent workers competiting for jobs. The job I applied last month had 78 applicants. 

To be honest, I haven't applied for regular jobs like customer service, because from my previous experience they also get a tens of applications. Also I worked in phone customer service some time ago, which left me pretty traumatized. Imagining doing customer service just fills me with dread nowadays..."

The writing and editing actually takes me only few hours, but I want to have time between the sessions so I can notice spelling mistakes etc. better."
