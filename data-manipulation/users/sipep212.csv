I feel sorry for all the families affected by the helicopter crash. Kobe got a damn great 41 years out of life that most will never get. 

Everyone I have talked to when we saw on Flightradar24 that the helicopter went 127 knots into the mountain in a controlled flight all had the same possible reason how it happened.  
Kobe saying ""just get us there.""
Everyone has said the same thing to me, even before hearing me say that as a possible cause.


There is a point in the radar track where the helicopter makes small circles waiting to get cleared to enter the next air traffic control zone (responsible helicopter pilots avoid straight hovering unless it is completely necessary.  Instead of hovering, they maintain a minimum altitude and forward speed so they can safely auto rotate to the ground.)   They had to have been getting close to being late to practice.  The pilot could have been pressured to take a few additional risks to get them there on time.  Fog is a rare occurrence in southern California,  so the pilot may have been rated to fly in fog, but may have not flown in fog a lot.

Was very surprised to hear that helicopter was purchased for $500k from the State of Illinois.  They sold five aircraft, including the helicopter, at auction for 2.5 million. 500k for that helicopter is a steal. For perspective,  a tillered truck (second driver steering the back end), like Dallas Fire has, costs about a million equipped.  A new Sikorski S-76 is 15 million dollars.  There are plenty of people in the market for pre owned executive helicopters.  Surprised it didn't go for 4 or 5 million, unless there were huge maintenance issues or repairs needed. Helicopters require quite a bit of maintenance compared to fixed wing aircraft."
ChicagoMed,ffsytix,t1_ffrme8x,1580198263.0,"They take a number of the patient stories from real life patients. However, this is pure propaganda about vaping.  Vaping has got tons of people to quit smoking, including me. I don't vape THC, which is what has caused the lung injuries and deaths.  I'm glad e cigs/vapes came out that were decent. There were some that came out in 2003ish that tasted like burnt cardboard. It was horrible. I needed to quit when I found out my blood CO level was 13%, while our medical control doctor was telling us anyone over 10% needed to be transported to the hospital.  Two weeks after vaping, I was down to 2%.  A week later, 0%.  I then started getting vape juice with less nicotine,  as I started very high to get addicted to vaping over smoking.  Now I vape at the very lowest level of nicotine to keep me from wanting to go get cigarettes."
