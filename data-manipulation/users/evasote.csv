movies,ffssw2f,t1_ffsk8gz,1580191248.0,"Yeah from an interview with the president, they give lots of freedom, then say when it’s complete “this is for streaming, this is for theatres, this is for Netflix” whatever. They kind of decide after the film is made how much they will support it but give huge amount of freedom first"
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffekacb,t1_ffejxs8,1579851556.0,Lots of ways! Just buy the tools you need for a project- you don’t need to get a bunch of stuff just to have it. There are tons of great teachers online. Paul Sellers is really great for starting off affordable with hand tools
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffegs31,t1_ffecf8h,1579847409.0,"It gets better! The first week is the toughest, but you’ll get bored without a hobby. I took up woodworking. Turns out there’s a lot of time in the day when your head is clear. Started off just whittling while watching baseball games and making a coffee table, now it’s my full time job"
Economics,ff3b135,t1_ff34p7m,1579537682.0,"This is the trick. I moved companies about the same, even came back to my same old job at one point with double the pay. Only way to get a raise"
worldnews,ff26elj,t1_ff23kni,1579495111.0,"Oh god.
I remember this. I was taking a Russian history class by a different man also named Mikhail Khodorkovsky at the time. My teacher was not a fan of Russia or anything/anyone having to do with it. He was from right near Chernobyl and barely escaped to America"
ObscureMedia,ff0enif,t1_ff0bvew,1579468179.0,"I worked with a company that made those room sized flight simulators on hydraulics recently. They took a year or so to build. They made military ones, but we didn’t have clearance to go into that room (half my team were not US citizens) but they were amazing. Cost upward of 7-10 million"
interestingasfuck,fewsjvz,t1_fewmnj1,1579418848.0,"I mean, Deniro himself in The Godfather part II as a young Vito goes to show how hard, and how rare it is"
todayilearned,feum0pm,t1_feue5i2,1579387818.0,Fuck that not in jail. People who say that have never spent a night in jail
todayilearned,fepq7kz,t1_fepncsy,1579327631.0,"It’s a place that’s a metaphor for our time, not hard scientific speculation"
Unexpected,fem9l97,t1_fem4sb6,1579244869.0,"I’ve heard this is important to remember if you’re ever helping in a catastrophic situation around lots of people. Some people just utterly freeze. And you have to watch for that too, just as much as someone running in a panic"
politics,feksczo,t1_fekp1f3,1579206601.0,"What we have here is basically getting him fired from his job, and stopping him from harming the country further. Honestly that’s good enough for now and what we should focus on."
DIY,fe9ojo2,t1_fe57nmm,1578940012.0,Fuuuck. I live in a rural zoning and never want to leave
StarWars,fe4fpyo,t1_fe472w9,1578858760.0,We really needed the sequels of Luke’s rebuilding and the fall of Ben Solo. We missed the boat on the actors being the right age
StarWars,fdpv8n2,t1_fdpu5fi,1578641882.0,Cause it looked goofy as hell. I grew up with the “original” Palpatine on VHS and even though it was a hologram is was clearly a funky suit and voiceover job. I imagine when they wrote him as a full proper character in Return Of the Jedi they realized it had to be a real dude
AskReddit,fdoy5bo,t1_fdo1dz4,1578615551.0,"Their third, free album was great. Sad that they were like “we got dropped from our label, no one wants this, here it is for free” and broke up, because it was awesome"
videos,fdmoshi,t1_fdmfjzo,1578558464.0,"It was a noble attempt. He certainly acted the hell out of it, he’s the ewan mcgregor of the last trilogy. 

But it’s hard to imagine anyone else at this point, as I feel they wrote around him to a point"
todayilearned,fdl3lvp,t1_fdkwn2e,1578516480.0,Good question. I ended up working 8 years at one of the best marketing firms in the country. None of us had marketing degrees. I had a fine art degree and some coding classes...
todayilearned,fdjjt6n,t1_fdjiewz,1578474146.0,"Mcafee is similar, but no one famous or powerful  wants to associate with him. He might be worse than Epstein, though, but it’s a race to the bottom fast"
chicago,fcxve8v,t3_ejg8gq,1578071033.0,Used to go there a long time ago. Looks like things haven’t changed a bit
news,fcgj95f,t1_fcghfr5,1577640713.0,Could you read the article? You can find out if he did or not. Reddit isn’t your research assistant. It’s a website full of links to articles
BlackPeopleTwitter,fc9oqp1,t1_fc9l653,1577555883.0,Yeah nah. I used to do comedy with him on small stages in Chicago. He’s funny but unhinged as a person.
