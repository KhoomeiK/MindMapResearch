I contested the ticket in court, and of all the cases before the judge in that session almost none of the cops showed up to prosecute so everyone got off scott free. Everyone else there was going 90 or above and the judge made it a point to lecture everyone about safety even though he technically had to dismiss their tickets. I was the only one he didn't lecture."
videos,fdflt17,t1_fdfce55,1578364675.0,"> he’s not portrayed badly either

I disagree. It shows him being a dick to Sharon's dog. 

> and the alternate reality ending indicates things working out well for him

>!I mean that tends to be the case when your wife doesn't die. Making that a criticism of how Polanski is characterized isn't really fair to the character of Sharon Tate. The movie isn't about him, and so that completely erases her agency as a person and a character. Historically she's always been seen as ""Roman Polanski's murdered wife"" and not much more, and this movie attempts to rectify that by giving her a life of her own.!<"

todayilearned,fctoakp,t1_fcmcpk4,1577951253.0,"Yeah they do. In the electoral college system, smaller states get more votes relative to their population. Hence, living in the middle of nowhere gives you more say than living in a city. 

I don't think people living in cities have the right to determine laws everywhere. I think where someone lives shouldn't have any bearing **whatsoever** on how much say have. That's where you and I seem to differ.

Furthermore, your remark about me not respecting people in small towns is dumb. I've spent years living in small towns. They're great people but they don't deserve any more or less of a vote than I do."
todayilearned,fcmak5h,t1_fcma7fw,1577768773.0,"I don't need a lecture in the inner workings of how the electoral college functions, I know that. I'm obviously talking about the intent of the voters when they choose their electors. It's 100% irrelevant. The electors are not representatives, the president is. 

You're the one who seems to be having the hard time understanding simple concepts here. The thing you think the electoral college does is already accomplished by the senate. You're not doing an adequate job explaining why living in a podunk state should mean you get more of a say in how the country is run than someone living in a city."
todayilearned,fcmaa1o,t1_fcm3tm0,1577768529.0,">-doesn’t encompass entire U. S. (Don’t care) 

Maybe you should considering the claim is that there are 3 million ""illegals"" voting throughout the entirety of the US. 

>-questionable methodology (like what)

Maybe if you actually read your own article you would know the answer to that question. You may have even noticed that the article points out on numerous occasions that allegations of voter fraud are unproven. 

But unsurprisingly, you did not read it.

>-may include inactive voters (not even close to the number)

lol according to who?"
todayilearned,fcm9tyh,t1_fcm3wos,1577768154.0,"> They serve the same exact purpose

No they don't. Once again, the president represents everyone. Everyone gets to vote for the president. Senators are accountable only for the people in their state."
todayilearned,fcm3pao,t1_fcm2bss,1577763427.0,">What's false: Such estimates do not encompass the entire U.S., are based on questionable methodologies, and **may include voters who are listed on state rolls as ""inactive.""**

Yeah real slam dunk, dozer. 

Let me know when Kris Kobach comes up with all that damning proof of voter fraud. Oh wait... his commission was shut down because it came up with exactly nothing. Womp womp."
todayilearned,fcm3dac,t1_fcm2qtx,1577763177.0,"The system already has another check in place to prevent people in Los Angeles from running over the little guys in South Dakota and giving the small town folks a say in law writing, and it's called the Senate. The half million people in Wyoming get to cancel out 40 million people in California with that. There's no reason why having fewer neighbors next to you should give you a massively disproportionate amount of representation across the rest of the government too. 

The president is supposed to be someone who represents and is accountable to ALL Americans. One person should mean one vote. The size of your municipality should have no bearing on that."
