>I'm not remembering this wrong in any way

Memory is a flawed recollection of an imprecisely encoded event.  No matter how well you think you are remembering anything, there are distortions and missing information, which your brain either fills in, or develops a narrative to explain.  It is impossible to know the fabricated components.  There is much research on this bizarre phenomenon.

Every time you remember something, you are not recalling a perfect recording of the event, you are remembering the last time you remembered it.  It gets distorted over time, and was not perfect to begin with."

Venn diagram of overlapping, categorisations. You could probably make a score of how good a country is, by the percentage overlap.  Countries which do things like reducing the impact of money and lobbying in politics, definitely score higher."
politics,fezauh9,t1_fez84dk,1579455472.0,"It Depends on which country you live in.  It has been subverted in many ways by the powerful and privileged to some degree everywhere, but that is not what the law is.  The law is the rules of society, which have been iterated over many thousands of years.  There are many laws that limit the rich and powerful as well, and protect the weak and vulnerable.  I agree there are immoral laws, and breaking them is moral, but it is still a crime. This is where common law can work quite nicely, because the Judiciary can affect how instances are judged in the future and change the law appropriately, based on the case specifics.

Countries like Saudi have unreasonable and immoral laws set, as you say by the rich to protect and benefit themselves (they also enforce them selectively), and these lie on one end of a spectrum.  The US is probably right of centre,  Scandinavia, and western Europe is towards the more reasonable and Moral end of the spectrum.  They all have exceptions."

politics,fez4s5u,t1_fez16n6,1579453854.0,"I am talking idealistically when I say it is a crime.  the system being broken is a separate issue.  I agree there are aspects of many systems that are morally wrong, and they should be fixed.  The mechanisms to fix them are often not easy to implement.    I don't think anybody has the right to commit a crime just because they don't agree with the law.  Where do you draw the line, and who decides on where it should be drawn?  That's what the law is for.  The fact that there are extenuating circumstances should not affect the fact that a law has been broken, but they should affect the sentencing, and that could be no penalty, because this is a reasonable situation.   In reality, life is not as clear cut, so this is why we want reasonable Judges, who can be sensible, rational and fair in their judgements.  Maybe AI will do better when they take control"

The Virtual ARP first hop protocol is much better than VRRP/HSRP, and is active/active, so you also get throughput improvements.  I find Arista Support to be much better than Cisco these days.  The only down side to arista is their attitude towards third party optics and their pricing of their officially branded ones can be quite high.  Their management platform is quite nice as well.  You can also do more on the switches, as they are essentially running Linux under the hood, and you can get a shell on them and run your own scripts."
