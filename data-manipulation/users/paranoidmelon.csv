Insults? I haven't insulted you once. You called me moronic. And what argument fell apart? You just don't want to acknowledge that screening can occur for multiple days. 

Concussions don't have a blood test. You can make observations, but nothing is concrete till you have symptoms. They stated the 11 transported was as a precaution...this would imply that they weren't serious enough to be noticed in the moments after the attack. It's acceptable and obvious to understand moments after an attack you're more concerned in deaths and injuries that are dangerous than walking wounded. More so, if the symptom of a concussion haven't shown up immediately you can't say that you have an injury. 

It's pretty basic. But whatever, I'm a moron. I should have asked my doctor to give me a blood test for concussion instead of that week it took from EMT , emergency room, to primary care to verify and determine how bad it was."

As in no reported injuries. If screening is occurring, which they stated as such, then no injuries have occured till they fall through the screen.

Concussions aren't physical injuries you can see on the person easily. They are related to the brain and can't be observed instantly. 

Just paste what I wrote already here

And what? Sports leagues take precautions. That is what the screen is for. But directly after a hit you're gonna get a bit of damage. But that little damage doesn't mean they will instantly remove your contract. And highly unlikely you'll retire if you're 99% and making millions. It's only when they go unconscious does any sports league react. Other symptoms come up overtime. That is why PTSD and concussions go untreated.  They even reportedly expect all concussed to be returned to active duty. Which may mean the level of concussion was low to nothing but still they're taking no chances."
worldnews,ff3yabm,t1_ff3xanw,1579551493.0,"Yes..injuries after the attack. Concussions take time to screen. How is this hard to understand? When someone dies you know they are dead quickly. When someone loses an arm you can just look. But when someone has PTSD or a concussion it'll take time to screen for and diagnose. This is obvious. 

So because it's so obvious when they said there were no injuries it was assumed and understood that they meant deaths and physical injuries.  It would take time to access cognitive or mental issues. 

Not a difficult thing to understand and not a difficult thing to accept. 


With the 11 people discussion , You're being truly pedantic on a strawman you created from something I didn't say. 



I assumed you agreed with my stance and others and the govt and Military and Doctors and journalist reports. I didn't know you thought you could screen for concussions instantly. sorry.

I wouldn't have said people. Because guess what, not everyone is combat , and not everyone is military in a military base. And even more amazing in a US base in a foreign country there is going to be non Americans. Crazy. So yeah 11 people.

Like I told you and I'm sure others have wrote. Concussions aren't exactly something you can see instantly. There is most likely a nesting period. So firing someone for what?

So maybe several thousand there. 11 having concussions sounds like a very low figure. Even makes sense that such a low number would show signs or finally be noticed showing signs of concussion.  

More so we don't know protocol. For all we know they don't report concussions after an initial attack. As concussed people could still be effective. They also might have a protocol to remove from a combat zone after x days , instead of removing one at a time..it's not like their care will be much better.
