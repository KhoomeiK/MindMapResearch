Her boiler feed water tanks leaked so much there wasn't much fresh water available for anything else, and salt was constantly contaminating boiler tubes so they'd have to scrape em out. 

Great book, not sure about the accuracy but it does have a picture it claims was taken at the moment she blew up, from *Prince of Wales*, that I've never seen anywhere else. Shows just the jet of smoke similar to the drawing by Captain Leach done later in the inquiry."

Austin,ff79jc2,t3_es1p9o,1579643894.0,"my go-to is Craigslist, to be honest. If someone has a decent car for a decent price, and has maintenance records, it's way better than a dealership. You can get pre-qualified for financing and just take that check to a private party for purchase (when I did this last I just did the deal at the local bank and they handled it). Call UFCU or Velocity and see how they do private sale financing. 

Someone was just asking about  mobile pre-purchase inspections, so you can do that if you have no idea what to look for in a well-maintained car."
