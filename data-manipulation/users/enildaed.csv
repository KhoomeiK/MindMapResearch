My second guess is the moment he got caught he realized what he had actually done and was so ashamed he left immediately to avoid facing his Icarian fall from grace. Unless there's a chapter II to this story revealing his close ties to counterfeit group. Let's hope he's a good guy who has learned his lesson.

papermache,fgi0hbk,t3_eyakl0,1580800080.0,"Be better to ask when you know what you're going to make. But, biggest issue with making art pieces of paper mache is mold. I suggestion add something to it to prevent it. If you work slow it's not so bad, but I have zero patience and prefer to build on bulk quickly. Even this though depends on your technique. If you use something like foil or something else to build up bulk you'll have less layers of paper and therefore the paper will dry quicker. I think it takes an inch of wet paper before I have issues. I do live in a humid environment so this might not be universal. As with most art projects, bigger is always better for detail. I think this is much more true of paper mache. If you have a dremel reshaping will take sooo much less time, but keep in mind that paper dust is very very very fine. Not great for the lungs."
rapecounseling,fghxunc,t3_eyhx0u,1580797334.0,"Gave me flashback of when my sexual molested me after I said no, and pushed him away multiple times with force. I think what matters more is that you felt violated. There's probably no legal case because it was so long ago, so what really needs focus is on how you can heal and reclaim your sense with bodily autonomy, which seems like it wasn't terribly well formed to begin with, unless you were under the influence.  I don't think you need it to be rape to take it seriously when it's clear that is continues to cause to emotional trauma.   


That being said, no consent was given, in fact the opposite was the case. You put out numerous signs that you didn't consent. I think even from a legal standpoint this would be rape. Even more so if you were intoxicated."

If you're not familiar with the hyperfocus specific of ADHD I suggest you learn about it so you can identify your triggers. It's mostly talked about as a negative, but when you're dealing with a flashback it's rather handy, because my brain can't be bothered with anything but what I'm hyperfocused on. It's even more handy for anxiety. I also found lucid dreaming as insanely helpful. I was able to work through my past trauma as I relived it in my dreams. I thank lucid dreaming for having only a several night terrors a year.

I stated it before but it's rather vague and comes off as a body image problem.

As to say my example of the man, if he wasn't straight and therefore not looking for my feedback it seems a bit odd, unless it's stated, like in the sub ahead of time. If some said ""gay man looking for feedback from gay men about my insecurity about my single"" then I definitely get being irritated, but that wasn't the scenario put forth. Likewise if I posted with no context that I don't like my boobs, I'm not sure I should feel self righteous anger if men replied letting me know there's nothing wrong with them.
