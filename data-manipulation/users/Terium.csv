classicwow,ffp200v,t3_eu6sig,1580084570.0,"My guild's best time is 51 minutes and we just started doing split runs in MC with alts and socials getting allowed into the mix. Did the first split this week with 34 people (didn't bother with pugs) and it went pretty smooth and will definitely allow for the more populated classes to get the rarer items faster. I'd say we're doing good but we need more Shamans!!! We've also been blessed with both bindings for our MT so we can't wait for BWL. We use Loot Council and so far it's worked great overall, although we have played together since before Classic (Ely/LH) so I imagine a lot of the drama new guilds bump into, we'll be able to bypass with relative ease."

AnimeCollectors,feungs7,t3_eouw59,1579388241.0,"You shouldn't even consider thinking about if your ""taste is refined"" my dude. Just watch stuff you enjoy and don't give a shit about what others think. Telling people what is good and what is not is the wrong approach. It's much better that you take the initiative to read a review or something yourself if you want information, but even then, people tend to deal in extremes. If a show is popular, they'll give it a 1 out of 10 just to fuck with the people who like it. Once again, it's okay to like whatever you want. And no, I'm not a lover of SaO, but I don't think people should have to feel bad for liking something. It's detrimental to the entire community to point at people and ""correct"" them. You do you! Watch enough stuff and your taste will evolve by itself without the needless corrections from the ""I'm not an elitist, but... etc"".

gatesopencomeonin,fen2o9p,t1_femutlp,1579275628.0,"Anime doesn't have an art style, but most popular shounen series or comedy series from the last 10 or so years do share a lot of common visuals. Try looking at stuff made by Yuasa Masaaki for example. It looks nothing like todays popular shows. Go back 2 or 3 decades and stuff looks completely different as well. I do agree with you that the community around certain shows can be incredibly toxic though."
