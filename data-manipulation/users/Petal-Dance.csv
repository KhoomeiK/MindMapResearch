Never actually fixed the game, and forced buyers to jump through hoops to get the goodies they were promised *after* trying to tell them to fuck off, followed by giving them ~$4 of in game currency which could only buy a garden flower. 

This is the prime example of the issues with preordering. 

Yes, Im sure youve preordered a game and been satisfied with the result. But across the board, preordering encourages studios to prioritize flashy (*read: lying and purposefully misleading*) promo material and demos rather than actually creating a good product. 

Normally, a game sells fairly well at launch and sustains sales as word of mouth spreads about its quality. 

With preorders, however, you sell based on hype, not gameplay. So if you get enough players to buy in early, you dont actually need a good game, you get your money early. Throw in some cheap bonus bullshit at a markup, and you get them to pay and extra $5-25 for something that cost ~0.75¢ to produce. 

If the game isnt good, people will peter out, but you keep the cash. Corporate sees it as a success. 

If the game is real bad, and people demand refunds, you rush a patch. Hell, if you know the game wont be good, you start working on the patch the day it ships, to try and reduce refund attempts. 

And with nintendo just winning that germany lawsuit making it legal to block any refund on preordered games, companies are only going to push harder for hype trains over quality gameplay."

NatureIsFuckingLit,ff321cv,t1_ff3000o,1579531613.0,"When does weather become climate change? Its when you zoom out. 

Weather is a daily, sometimes weekly thing. Climate is the monthly to yearly scope and trend. 

For example, the sahara has a typical climate of hot dry days with very cold nights. However, day to day, this could vary in terms of temperature, or even rarely some form of rain. When you zoom out and look at its monthly high, low, and average temps for the year, tho, you get that climate average of hot dry day, cold nights. 

So weather change doesnt mean much, because any given day could experience a deviation from the norm, like rain in the sahara. 

But climate change means a lot, because its the change in the average over a very long stretch of days. 

So in the drought example. A climate trend increase would have that drought be hotter, or maybe more intense with far less water, or last longer before breaking, or happen more times in a year. And while any one given day may be a ""normal"" drought, its influence is stretched out a bit on each axis, making its effects longer lived and more impactful"

Im not twisting shit, you moron, **thats what was the entire conversation from comment one.** We were very pointedly talking about how the lgbt community cares about transphobic statements, and jk made one. 

And then youre dumbass waddles in, and starts trying to claim that caring secretly means you need to already be obsessed with everything the person did before and after every action. Which 1) isnt what that means and 2) wasnt what was being talked about from the beginning

You responded by saying we dont care that she supports transphobic shit. 

This is incorrect. Because we *do not want people spreading transphobic shit.* 

If you dont want someone to do something, and then they do it, *that means you care about the fact that they are doing it.* 

If you dont care that someone does something, you wouldnt object to it being done. But since gay people **do** object to people saying transphobic shit, *we explicitly care about when people say transphobic shit.*"
