I feel you about the collector role. It's a really adventurous feeling when my controller faintly vibrates and I know that I've found something. Also the horse picking plants animation is adorable and gets me to pick up way more of those haha"

Instagramreality,fe4smlx,t3_ek492g,1578862371.0,"Im 20 now but this shit was already somewhat going on when I was like 13 and I remember not being able to identify how fake it was most of the time. That Realisation came with age but I still feel pretty bad being faced by all this perfection and not being able to even remotely compare since nature just didn't equip me with a good face.
I think the added volume of perceived perfection does a lot of harm concerning what we regard as normal (scars, cellulitis, visible pores etc). It just gets ingrained as something that's gross or wrong and noone treats it as normal anymore. So no wonder many people feel extremely insecure about things that are a normal part of their body.
It's weird and sad that this is what's going on everywhere."
RedDeadOnline,fe1zsmn,t1_fe1zl05,1578832850.0,I think that's a good idea! I'd be up to find it.

So I missed out on everything that builds all these peoples lives. Relationships, vacations, parties, sport clubs, activities etc.

I feel bad for not practicing anymore, for not improving while everyone is surpassing me, like they always do.
It's unfair that even these joys get taken away and no matter how hard I try they won't come back to me.
