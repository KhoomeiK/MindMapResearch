Tinder,fevh56v,t1_fevfn8f,1579397369.0,"Yea sorry I shoulda been more clear. I just found it kinda weird mostly bc of the not being able to text, the social media was just smaller additinal red flags(at least for me). I get it if people dont enjoy those platforms but id personally like a way to make sure theyre real and it makes me feel safer. So when he said he could barely text or anything, I was like hm you gotta give me something to work with man"

depression,fefxz5k,t1_fefwv3l,1579068968.0,Maybe you can tell them whats going on just as a heads up. it may seem like you dont see any point in having them around but youre gonna yearn for them again eventually. The same thing happened to me and now all my friends are out of reach and I have no one to turn to. It would also help them bc maybe theyre wondering why youve changed
depression,fefxlps,t3_eoybah,1579068579.0,"If your family is as abusive as they sound, im not too sure how to tell them that you want to get treatment/more tests done. Im sure if you have to theres a way to do it without your family knowing, you can ask the therapist about confidentiality. If thats not an option, tell your parents then. Maybe you can tell your mom?"

depression,fefrjr5,t3_eoxfgh,1579063116.0,I often think about this. I didnt want to be born in the first place so why the fuck am I here. If I had the consent I would not choose to be conceived. This shit was not worth it and now im forced to be alive for another 60+ years. It pisses me off
depression,fefrdx8,t3_eoxgoo,1579062991.0,Me too. I have this and was wondering if I was bipolar (I really have no idea dont take this as fact). I was feeling so confident but then something tiny could send me spiralling into a pit. I can also usually have a 5 minute sobbing meltdown and then recover within seconds. Its weird Im not sure what it is
SuicideWatch,fefqv50,t3_eox70i,1579062587.0,What the fuck is even the purpose. Waking up to go to a job just so you can afford to wake up in the same bed in the same house and continue to do the job to make money to wake up in the bed in the house etc. is this really what im meant to do?
SuicideWatch,fefqlrs,t3_eox8yd,1579062394.0,I just wanna die
depression,fefpsws,t3_eox1ug,1579061790.0,"Constant reassurance is always good. But make sure you let her know that youre not annoyed when she asks you these things. Even if you might be exasperated, shell probably be hyperaware of your response if she asks you “do you think I look good?” Or something like that. 

What sounds good imo is something like “youll always be beautiful to me no matter what youre wearing” etc. You could also compliment her more? Even if she doesnt ask for your opinion, something small like a “you look good today” would probably go a long way"
