gaming,ffoqhhm,t3_eu72rl,1580080477.0,Before my father died his desk area was set up with some flight controls and flight sim. He was disabled and it helped him to find purpose and escape. It was my way to encourage him to walk and ambulate. We are always so quick to pass judgement but we never know what a person’s struggle may be.

Need,ffhsi7k,t3_eto9pe,1579951628.0,You may want to see if your area has housing assistance for mental health diagnosis. My area offers it through the one agency. Phone I would swap to government phone like safelink or Alibi it is free. I’d talk to the landlord and be honest and ask what your options are. Often times when I sign mental health warrants some landlords are helpful and understanding. It’s worth reaching out. Regardless I’m proud of you for getting help.
DumpsterDiving,ffhi8hp,t3_esjfau,1579936419.0,As a handicapped person they suck. The hinge snaps easily after use. Invest in a metal one with a folding swing arm and suction cup tips.
Frugal,ffh81pz,t3_ethr3p,1579925755.0,Frugal to me is a combination of buy it for life meets poverty finance. Just because you try to save doesn’t mean you can’t have some quality. Quality over quantity is a good measure of frugal if you spend more on the back end sometimes you’ll save more on the front end. Electric devices we shouldn’t skimp. It’s better to have solid function than a fire.

I’m transitioning between companies at the end of the month. Without my husband working things are getting tight. Would just want something from my practical list to keep my home clean so I don’t feel down despite everything going on. Honestly I just want a new cane strap. Mine started to sag badly last night on a call and I stapled it. So it doesn’t fall off. If you pass over me I understand and I’m grateful you are caring for the others here."

He replied because it’s so wet in here. The third baby said he wanted to be a hunter. The other two asked why. To catch that fucking weasel that keeps coming in here.
povertyfinance,feg4vxq,t3_elryxp,1579077039.0,I may add Walmart and Cvs have $10 prescription lists. Also paying for good rx gold you can add multiple family members and there’s some deeper discounts depending on the medications.

konmari,fefm3cr,t1_feflmcx,1579059259.0,"So if that’s the case re go through the collection see what stories speak to you and you identify with. They are what you keep the less involved either scan, find digital, regift or I sometimes decoupage book ends to make something more meaningful I’ll use. It’s hard being in two places at once."
konmari,fefkepu,t3_eo9dod,1579058196.0,What I did was kept a few that sparked joy and replaced others with digital copies. I think it’s like wearing a nerd suit for street cred but knowing you transcended it and not knowing where to go with it.
TumblrInAction,fea336s,t1_fea1xe4,1578943857.0,If you look at the National suicide prevention sites states usually it goes gun shot then hanging for men in the us. Globally I would assume it would be different due to means access. My county more than 50% of suicides last year committed/completed by men were gun shot in my county. Followed by asphyxiation. Females in my county tended to be a completed suicide via overdose.
TumblrInAction,fe9y4ja,t3_eo6bm1,1578942494.0,The reality is men attempt suicide with more lethality than women. They will choose guns and hanging while females tend to choose over dosing. There’s more likelihood to recover from an overdose than a gunshot.
EatCheapAndHealthy,fds60hn,t3_emqfvz,1578695138.0,Just a thought. Maybe try hello fresh or blue apron trial. For a month the reason I say this is because the recipe cards are broken down to learn to cook and teach you how to explore and do techniques. Even as an experienced cook it was eye opening. Once you have those basics down investing in cheaper and healthy meal alternatives is more worth while. If you can’t afford those options those same sites do have recipes online and you can reconstruct. It’s how I ended up adding red cabbage to my diet.
scambait,fdod8oe,t1_fdo6acp,1578603022.0,I just want to relax not worry about tinder dick.
scambait,fdo45zg,t3_emcsof,1578598568.0,I wish I had a patterned on words that didn’t want to talk. I had one guy hitting on me and accuse me of being a scammer because of my pic I told him to get bent. I miss games being less personal.

Honestly I believe in surveys that have a lot of product testing as it give u free items to use you won’t need to buy that trade off can be worth while. 

Check class action lawsuits 1x a month to see if you qualify. 

Always grab extra sauce packets when out on rare occasions. Those I use for cooking and to stretch condiments. 

Try to use farmers markets to stretch your money for healthier alternatives. 

Keep freebies sites book marked use a junk email. 

Save grocery bags for trash bags. I also use it to knit reusable grocery bags. 

Use libraries for books, movies, games music etc 

Plutotv and crackle are some nice resources for free tv. 

Always take note of stores that price match.  I saved $40 the other day at PetSmart with coupons and price matching. 

Coupon wisely. Sometimes it’s better to get a smaller size with a coupon than a larger one. 

Forums like visible mending, zero waste, upcycling, beermoney, slave labor, and dumpster diving can be really helpful to augment tricks. 

Always try to negotiate service fees, interest rates, and  try to transfer balances to 0 percent interest cards if possible.
