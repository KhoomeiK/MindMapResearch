TwoXChromosomes,ffo91jr,t1_ffnyi0q,1580075269.0,"house maintenance is cool, and legit. however, i think you’d be hard-pressed to find a typical house that needs the daily care equivalent of raising even one small human, much less more."
politics,ffo79vp,t1_ffnnp9h,1580074860.0,"well it’s not like he stopped doing awful things; he’s continued to rolled back every environmental law & rule he can, further enabled anti-abortion forces, passed even more money to the 1%, hired & encouraged cabinet members who loathe the agency they run & consequently destroyed lives, continued the trend of the supreme court & many other federal courts listing right, further disenfranchised immigrants, muslims, rainbow people,  women & non-christians, and made such a worse mess of our foreign dealings that we will not be trusted again for decades. with mcturtle sitting on every decent bit of legislation that the house has passed since midterms, every day this man is in office he fucks things up even more."

i’ll be facetious and say every time he makes a critical comment, he should pay $500 I know that’s not realistic but it’s just something I thought."

mildlyinteresting,ffk2x3o,t3_etw8ks,1580014158.0,would it be terribly unsporting to bring a tarp & a pallet? elevate the bottom & rainproof the top for cheap.
mildlyinteresting,ffk2luk,t1_ffjl32l,1580013882.0,"i concur. source; i live in the carolinas. it gets cold in the mountains, but the ‘lowlands’ mostly 40-60, december thru january [ so far] and multiple all- day rains. if you have to walk at dog at midnight [ ahem, doggo sleeping at my feet] then a coat is necessary. otherwise, at most, a sweatshirt. really, seriously, concerned about summer. 

also wondering when the exodus from floridas’ costs will start."

HomeDecorating,ffk0kde,t1_ffjs9pm,1580012129.0,": ) so we will. imo, clean = sterile, simple = boring, bright = ow my eyes, refreshing - nah, i like different. tho’ there is something worse than white; builder beige ugh. 
but the world would be so bland if we all liked the same thing. i’m currently exposing dark red & grey brick walls in my home [ pulling down drywall] so that’s very nearly the opposite of your bright white."
HomeDecorating,ffjo7nt,t3_etqg9u,1580002825.0,"yet another vote for off- white if you must  maybe mix the taupe with white to keep it in the same family, but basic white is boring. 
i’m planning to paint all of my door trim the color of the walls,  because who wants all that bland white interrupting everything?  why do we outline windows & doors anyway? [ and have different color garage doors from house? ] can we not find the doors & walls otherwise?"

AskReddit,ffha0w8,t3_etbrdf,1579927488.0,"one of my cats would herd me to bed. she’d follow me to my bedroom, stand on the bed commenting on my progress, and follow me to the bathroom & back. when i laid down, she’d curl up on my pillow around my head. i don’t move much in my sleep, so she’d still be there most mornings. 

for a while i had 5 cats in a really large house, so sometimes it was hard to find them all at night for ‘bedtime’. but if i gave up, the eldest/smartest would jump on the bed at 4 am, ready to go to their bedroom. why i had to escort my little cat pack, her first, the rest following, i will never know. but it was the rule. eventually i realized that she was always on time, to the minute. none of this 3.59 stuff; 4 am on the dot, cat on my chest, patting my face, staring me down. and she never did it to any of the other people who lived in the house - that privilege was mine & mine alone."
