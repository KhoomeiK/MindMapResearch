He just gets asthmatic (lightly) during certain seasons or when the pets shed out their undercoat in the spring. He can run 20k no problem though."

AmItheAsshole,ff2bpav,t3_er5mf1,1579499881.0,"NTA- Just this past fall, I went back to school for a new degree and to get a better job, but that did not change the rest of my life. I’m still working full time, and I take care of my son everyday because my husband has clients starting at 6:30am and gets home at 7pm. I don’t have my license,  so I bus, walk or bike everywhere.  I also do all the cooking and most of the housework. I’m crushing it because I know what it takes to support the family.

Your husband is being TA. You’re only asking him to get a part-time job."

AskReddit,fevgr8n,t3_eqies2,1579397207.0,"I was talking to my mom one day when I was about 12ish, about how much I missed going to my great grandmother’s house for tea and playing in her flower beds. I also talked about how weird it was how vividly I remembered her funeral despite being 4 when she died (I can remember holding my father’s hand, that it was raining very lightly and the red jacket I was wearing). Then my mom said, “No that was your sister. Granny died before you were born”.  Somehow I have all my sister’s memories of her experiences with our great grandmother, and my sister claims she doesn’t remember any of it. My sister is 10yrs older than me too. So this all happened way before I came."
relationship_advice,fepwrzi,t3_eq9k3e,1579333702.0,"All I have to say is context. 

Would it be acceptable for an everyday average person, to tell their partner, that they want artistic renderings of their favorite porns on the walls? Or would it be ok if someone’s partner bought a “real doll” and expected their partner to participate in threesomes out of the blue? If these things seem “off” in a more traditional arena, then it’s not ok for her to push them on you just because you are both into playing in other formats. As far as I know most fetish people are upfront and respectful. They communicate. So this sounds like y’all need to have an honest communication about your expectations, sex lifestyle and future expectations."

Fortunately for me, back then, there was no licensed stuff. There was no such thing. But I did go nearly broke making sure the damn bear had the actual wardrobe (furniture) and filled it."
relationship_advice,feple8x,t3_eqap9q,1579323562.0,"My husband has clients at 6am. So he gets up super early. This used to be a problem for us. He used to hit snooze a lot and we got into fights.

He quit hitting snooze so that helps. But now he also uses his apple watch for an alarm. It just vibrates his wrist and there is no sound, so I never hear him get up anymore. Also our bed is on a super sturdy frame, so I don’t feel him leave the bed. We used to have a cheap frame and his moving used to bug me. These changes have brought me back into the bedroom. 

Now, if y’all want to spend a few nights separate so that you can both be happy, that’s fine. I sometimes sleep on the couch when my anxiety is off the hook so I don’t keep my husband awake. It’s about what works for you. People just think sleeping separate places=fighting. So don’t worry about them, because they have outdated thinking."

It wasn’t until I was 12 that my mom told me Dame Edna was a man in drag. Even then it didn’t change my perspective much. It was extra funny; yet still classy.

In my family, we learned to dish our own plates early in life and the rule was ‘you eat what you take’. Well in his family his parents dished everyone up and gave it to you. So i felt extremely pressured to finish a plate. Problem was, I was just coming off anorexia (ballet dancer in high school), and couldn’t eat much in one sitting because my stomach was so small. My MIL would often act offended that I “didn’t like her cooking”. Which was not the case. It was good, I just couldn’t eat much at one sitting. Finally after she reduced me to tears one night, my husband let them in on what the issue was (he didn’t feel like it was his place to tel them before). And they let me pick what I could handle after that."
