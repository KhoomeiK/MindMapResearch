politics,fgmslc3,t1_fgmgjc1,1580931204.0,"Yes, brilliant because he's going to hate that she stole the show.  Everyone is talking about it and that's all they're talking about.  Nothing irks a narcissist more than someone stealing the show.  There will be some immediate kickback because a lot of misogynists will hate that type of an expression from a woman.  But it's a powerful move on her part.  It was full of lies anyway."
politics,fgm6djc,t1_fgm4rdp,1580918807.0,"I agree, and she nailed it.  Really brilliant."

dogs,fgg730g,t1_fgfu060,1580755658.0,What's weird is a refusal to actually read the story.  The people left a note saying she was too old when they released her.  Was it your dog?  Do you have insider information that no one else has?  Do tell....
worldnews,fgg6gvj,t1_fgfz9t0,1580755273.0,"Sometimes I think the ""Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" phrase in the Dec of Independence has doomed us to a state of constant pursuit.   You may not achieve actual happiness, but you're free to pursue it."

politics,ffaepb0,t1_ff9fhm7,1579733927.0,"The beauty of his pathological narcissism is that he can't help but dig the hole deeper, especially if he thinks he can get away with it.  It's pretty amazing to watch really though sad for those who suffer as a result."
AskWomen,fekw0aq,t1_fejcr8c,1579208754.0,"Absolutely.  He would complain about being tired all the time too, and I told him it was because he was working so hard to breathe at night.  But if he wasn't willing to address a significant health concern, I wasn't going to hang around to have to deal with it night after night."
AskWomen,fei5hze,t1_fehssmn,1579130726.0,"I ended an engagement because he refused to admit that he needed to see a sleep specialist.  He would stop breathing and then make these horrible sucking noises and it got to the point where I couldn't get any rest.  He would stop breathing for remarkably long segments of time and I would push at him to try an get him to breathe, but his refusal to admit there was an issue was my last straw."
dogs,fehvjz6,t3_ep5jpm,1579124723.0,"I agree with the other posters.  Don't second guess yourself, it sounds like it's time and you're doing the right thing.   And 15-16 is a long life for a sweet doggo.  I'm so sorry for your loss."

You might want to look for an Al-Anon group and get some support that way.    Sorry you're going through that."
AMA,fe8zl26,t1_fe6owo9,1578932608.0,Actually you sound more naive for being focused on the superficial.

WeAreTheMusicMakers,fdlobl3,t3_elzjyi,1578528597.0,"I love all aspects of making music.  From engineering and production to live performance.  I'm lucky in that somewhat OCD, so I'll keep editing and refining until I get the mix and I have a natural curiosity for technology so that works well when it comes to a creative approach and production."
