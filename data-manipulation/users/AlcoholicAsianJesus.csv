politics,ffje5g5,t1_ffj78mo,1579996359.0,"I didn't say nullification, just slight modification of vote weighting. I'm more interested in having a discussion about improving our elections than I am about having my ideas implemented without consideration.

I'm not saying there isn't a better method, or that my previous suggestion is infallible. In fact, now that I've read your response, I've realized an egregious error.

My error of judgement was to assume that the ability to comprehend economic or social issues would somehow equate to a more objective vote. Now I realize that one has nothing to do with the other. 

Someone with a nuanced understanding of political issues is still susceptible to the influence of those who would lead them astray in order to co-opt their support to benefit their own personal agendas.

Also, about your statement that poll tests are unconstitutional. Not that I'm disagreeing with you. I'm just curious as to whether or not the constitution mentions poll tests specifically or if there's some indirect statute that prohibits limiting voting rights based on certain criteria.

I remember reading once that the text of the original constitution did indeed require voters to pass a test for the right to vote, only it was an economic test requiring all voters to be land owners. I know this is no longer the case, and owning land is no more an indication of intellect or integrity than my misguided ""questionnaire"" suggestion. 

Though it does show that the sentiment is not without precedent. How do you feel about convicted felons not having the right to vote?"
politics,ffj1tk2,t1_ffiv81j,1579988259.0,"Voting is only half of the solution. We need more upstanding people running for office.

We need a political overhaul. We need to separate money from elections. If anything should be nationalized at all, it's the election process.

Instead of allowing candidates or special interests to use their deep pockets to control the airwaves. Each candidate should be allowed equal airtime, and each should be given the same scrutiny. Each ad should have the same, objective format.

All ballots should be devoid of party affiliations. Instead of long lines of voters queuing up to use a small amount of available booths, there should be great halls filled with high-walled cubicles. In each cubicle, a chair, a desk with built-in touch screen/monitor, and a pair of head phones.

On the screen by each candidate's name, an icon that allows navigation to an in-depth report of their political leanings, with a bias toward empirical data like historical voting records for candidates who have previously held office, complete with warning indicators for red flags like votes that contradict their stated intentions, or votes that contradict previous votes, or votes that are cast contrary to the wishes of their constituancy for the benefit of privately held investments, or for corporate and state-sponsered political donors.

Voting should be, at minimum, a two-day, paid holiday for those that vote. Conscientious objectors can also forgo voting in exchange for volunteering their time to help set up and staff the polls, or as a shuttle driver, ferrying voters without adequate transportation to and from polling places.

If we want to minimize the impact of voters who cast their votes based on llittle more than popularity or emotion , it may be beneficial to have each voter complete a short questionnaire designed to assess their economic and sociopolitical acumen, which could then be incorporated into a new, weighted voting algorithm of some sort."

Of course it would probably take some thought and practice to create small isolated events that could be rearranged as needed and without making the narrative feel disjointed or random. Of course, life can be disjointed and random.

AnimalsBeingBros,fehd4uf,t1_fegv9j2,1579114097.0,"Man, that reminds me of the times I used to visit my grandparents. They had given me a pellet gun for christmas one year and I kept it there. Every time I would visit I would go in the back yard and shoot at stuff.

Anywho there was a tree in the back, and it was usually filled with black birds of some sort. They were smaller than crows, but they may have been corvids of some sort. Every time I would visit, I would spend a good deal of time shooting at these black birds in this tree.

I must have spent something like 8 to 10 solid hours trying to shoot a bird out of this tree over a two or three month period of time, never hitting anything of course.

Until one day, I hit one. It fell out of the tree and flapped around on the ground in agony for a momemt before dying right in front of me. I don't know what I had expexted to happen the whole time I was trying to shoot that bird. Growing up in the south, hunting is very prevalent. But this wasnt hunting. I didn't eat this bird. They weren't destroying my property or annoying me at all really. I just straight up murdered another living creature for my own amusement.

Well I got way more than I bargained for. Sure, you could say that I was young and naive. But the moment it happened, I knew I was fully culpable for my actions. I mean, I was shooting at this bird with a relatively powerful pellet gun. What the hell did I think would happen?

Maybe, since adults always spoke so blithely about shooting animals much more substantial than birds, I assumed that I would feel equally indifferent. I still swat at biting insects and I've been known to employ chemical weapons to engage in large scale waspicide.

I don't recall feeling remorse watching the writing bodies of the dying wasps. Maybe I thought I would feel the same after bird murder."

Your average redditor will probably be unable to differentiate between a positive post from a fan, and one crafted by a decent PR firm though.

Now that the ad agencies have had a decent amount of time to perfect their methods of generating buzz via sponsored content, I would imagine that it isn't used as often as people think it is.

If they let the astroturfing get out of hand, their intentions will become obvious. Most marketing and PR firms are aware of how detrimental it would be if they are exposed trying to control public opinion from the shadows which, if they're intelligent, is something they will avoid at all costs.

Therefore it's much more desirable to use one well-timed and carefully crafted sponsored content ad than it is to flood the social networks with wall-to-wall posts.

Usually, their contributions will be the initial post that kicks off a rapid succession of fan-generated organic posts in response."
