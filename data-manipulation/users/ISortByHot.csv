Conservative,ff4zhm9,t1_ff115hu,1579576209.0,I wasn’t able to find a source for puberty blockers causing infertility. Can you provide please?
Conservative,ff4njgz,t1_ff41sjg,1579567937.0,"Thank you for taking the time to respond. The 80-90% statistic that gender confusion passes in adolescence is compelling. Your hyperbole is less interesting, but I appreciate your passion for raising kids. 

The assumption about the conclusion I’m postulating is, I will admit, a far stretch. I apologize if my setup is both offensive and so absurd that the real question I’m asking is being missed. My question is this:

Is a transvestite who is easily identifiable as such better or worse off than one who isn’t? 

I actually don’t care about whether sex changes are right or wrong or that it’s a problem only bad parents face. I definitely DO care about protecting children from their poor judgment and setting them up for success in life. 

With regards to your question about my son, I probably wouldn’t support it because of the statistic mentioned. But more importantly because of my own bias: I just believe it makes life WAY harder and I want him to be happy. It boggles my mind that becoming a transvestite would be remotely worth it. The potential of being a target of violence, isolation from family and community, discrimination, disfiguring ones body. And yet people still do it, so I’m of the opinion that their pre-op suffering is sufficient to consciously choose isolation and discrimination.  

I wasn’t able to find any sources confirming that puberty blockers cause sterility. Not sure if you believe American academy of pediatrics and Mayo Clinic are credible sources. But they don’t support that claim. Can you please provide your source?

If you have any number of drinks a day and suffer for it, there’s an open chair for you in pretty much any AA meeting (if you want support). There are alcoholics who find recovery before their lives are in utter ruins, who have the behavioral characteristics of alcoholism, without the intake of a grizzled old “pro”... I count myself as one of them. I was lucky enough that my mom was dating a dood in NA who introduced me to program when I was in my early 20s and spiraling out of control.

Conservative,ff1eerx,t3_er2v7p,1579478145.0,"Honest hypothetical question from a father of an awesome toddler son: assume you have a son who, in spite of your objections, will undergo gender conversion at some point in his life. The longer he waits the more painful that transition and his ensuing life will be due irreversible physical changes caused by testosterone (masculine Adam’s apple, broad shoulders, thick jaw, etc). These changes cause him more stigmatization and discrimination due to having a masculine appearance and build. 

After the inevitable transition, would you want them to look more like a female or a male? Would you want people to be able to immediately know just by glancing or would you want them to be told at the right time?

I ask because, while I would be saddened if my son wanted to change gender (I want grand kids, man!), I’d still want him to have the best life possible."

To those parents I say this: greater empathy, tolerance, and understanding of your children can result in greater cooperation from them. From like the age of 2? 3? (Someone please correct me here) Your kid is a whole human being who is able to experience the full range of human emotions.
