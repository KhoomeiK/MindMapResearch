You're a fucking wizard! This ! I didn't have my mom or dad in my life ( drugs and jail) and even though I met alot of great people and have people who love me in my life, theres a big ass hole there ! And even though my parents are ""clean"" now Idk if the dmg is irreparable. I sometimes you to myself like damn ... how can anyone love me if the 2 ppl who brought me into this world gave up on me ... true I found love in the form of friendships and past relationships but that thought still crosses my mind I'm 22 (m) as well! So I feel for you. Hell my best friend had a daughter and on one of my worst days she anchored me back to reality when I was on the verge of growing up and I hadn't even met her yet ! He invited me to her bday party and I realized I always wanted to meet her and not only that, but he had it rough too and I took it as a personal quest to make sure he/we become men she can look up to. Please keep going for her sake ! I know you care so much about her because otherwise you wouldn't have even took the time out to type this!"
