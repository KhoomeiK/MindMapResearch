depression,ffp9xgd,t3_eu945z,1580089819.0,"Oh yes, I'm totally worthless. Showing who am I is showing an antisocial loser with no skills nor passion. I wish you the best tho."
antinatalism,ffmroh6,t3_eu7k24,1580058237.0,Noone will ever support this. It is against humanitu.
leagueoflegends,ffhtbjd,t3_eto2q6,1579952838.0,I know I can't really improve so I play to prove I am at least master player.
depression,ffgyx95,t3_etk08v,1579918645.0,"Depends if it won't have negative effects like for example bullying in school, making your every day miserable. If not then sure, if you think you want it go for it."
antinatalism,ffatbrl,t1_ffap4mj,1579744008.0,I mean we should eat either nothing or everything. The best option would be ofc if we all die. Like why is it ok to kill a fly but killing dog is not so ok?
antinatalism,ffaoyal,t3_ertgh3,1579741079.0,"Yes i think eating meat should be illegal. I also think eating plants should be illegal, plants live aswell."
heroesofthestorm,fegpve3,t3_eout02,1579099713.0,Reading some of that makes me think you are just really bad at the game.
depression,fefb5k5,t3_eoomu6,1579052447.0,"I just hate the rivalisation. It's everywhere. In school you are fighting for grades, you are fighting for a job, for a gf/bf/friend. You compete in sports, video games, making better haircut or whatever else. And you know what? I suck at everything. Even if I'm good at something there are better than me and I hate it. I'm not ok with being just a normal guy and the world overwhelms me.

The other thing is just that it's better to not be borned at all. With the improvement of life quality I expect more depressed/suicidal people."
leagueoflegends,feex5cl,t3_eoosar,1579043138.0,"The most op (or maybe annoying to play against) are Rengar, Nocturne, Evelynn, Twitch - no simple counterplay and easy to play."
depression,fdk8aac,t3_elqwy9,1578498347.0,Because i am useless. I don't have social skills and I'm good at nothing. I don't know how to function in the current world.
nihilism,fczhhyg,t3_ejfoet,1578101367.0,I'd love to get a war. War must be fun.
heroesofthestorm,fcsixov,t3_ei9lsb,1577917402.0,Putting Probius outside of tier D is just not ok.
depression,fcotjf9,t3_eib3yr,1577841154.0,"My dad is sociopath drinking every 2 days. He said I'm not his son, screamed at my sister and mother, his siblings hate him. Disgusting person. I have mixed feelings about my mom, she does care about me but the relation isn't great. I started college but I think I'll drop it soon, find a job and move away from home.

You have to be strong now. That's a really hard moment in life."
depression,fcopbz2,t3_ei9s4u,1577838006.0,"I've spend time with 5,7k other people watching a stream. Are we a failure? To some extend yes. We didn't do what society expected us to do. But fck it, I had a good time."
nihilism,fcol50f,t1_fcojv6s,1577834978.0,"Just make sure you won't fail, it's not hard."
depression,fcoklm2,t3_ei9ihs,1577834590.0,Life is all about sex. Reality.
depression,fchaf7s,t1_fcgur5u,1577648748.0,It's impossible for me to answer it now. I don't really know how I want to live (if I want to). Nothing makes sense to me. If nothing matters you may aswell be positive and chase happiness. There are things I really enjoy so I may just live for these things.
depression,fcgnv6z,t1_fcfj3ad,1577642218.0,It has nothing to do with what you have. It's asking questions about existance. But it is nihilism/absurdism or whatever you want to call it then.
leagueoflegends,fcexyre,t3_eh3z5p,1577624763.0,"Ziggs, Lux, Morgana, Xerath, Twisted Fate, Malphite, Varus, Yuumi, someone out of them."
nihilism,fc6x67x,t3_egdoyl,1577491789.0,Quest log appearing in my hud.
