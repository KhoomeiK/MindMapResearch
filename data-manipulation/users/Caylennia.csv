weightwatchers,ffcj4v7,t1_ffcezec,1579800567.0,That’s awesome! I’m at 9 months and I never had any supply issues until about 6 months. I also always have enough for her to eat when I’m with her. I only have trouble pumping at work. 45 pounds is amazing! Great job!
weightwatchers,ffciqfd,t1_ffc4c13,1579800326.0,I definitely appreciate the suggestions but alas I have tried them all. I can’t do “power hours” at work but I was doing them at home all the time. I just recently stopped because at this point I’ll be able to make it a whole year as long as I can continue to keep up 6 oz a day (I have a pretty good amount frozen) I’ve tried massaging and hot compresses but it doesn’t help much. I’m doing ok though I was just wondering how many people are breastfeeding while on WW and in the same boat as me.
weightwatchers,ffc1cjw,t1_ffby55x,1579789042.0,I’m sure I’m making at least 28. I know that she gets at least 5 oz from each side in the morning I am up to pumpin 7.5 at work then she eats straight from the tap 3 times from when I get home to when she goes to sleep and recently has been waking up once in the middle of the night too.
weightwatchers,ffc03x6,t1_ffbazts,1579788087.0,"I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be having any trouble if I didn’t have to pump. But I’m not going to complain, I’ve made it 9 months so if I can just keep up a little supply for pumping I’ll be able to make it to a year no problem!"
weightwatchers,ffbxvzs,t1_ffb8c8j,1579786280.0,Thank you for the suggestion! I barely use Facebook but I will see if I can remember my password and join that group. I don’t really like Facebook though so I haven’t been on for a while. I’m definitely not using all of my points but I’m still finding that my supply is increasing from calorie counting. I’m on the purple plan so there are a ton of free foods! I made a delicious chicken and navy bean soup the other day that I found online and it ended up being zero points but absurdly filling and really has everything you need! I’m also eating a lot of fruits which seems to be helping and I just made some chocolate peanut butter overnight oats with premier protein shake and pb2 powder with 26 grams of protein and only 2 points! It’s absurd!
weightwatchers,ffbn4uk,t1_ffb69bg,1579773691.0,"I don’t think I would be having any supply problems if I were able to stay gone and nurse her all the time instead of pumping. It’s only when pumping that I’m having trouble producing enough. I already have worked oatmeal into my diet, in fact I have some chocolate peanut butter overnight oats in the fridge right now with premier chocolate protein shake, mashed banana and pb2 powder! I’m also already taking pink stork true milk and drinking mothers milk tea. My supply has gone up since I started going back up since I started weight watchers. Wish I’d tried it earlier!"
weightwatchers,ffb2vwo,t1_ffb1ii7,1579750410.0,Wow! How did you lose that much weight so quickly and keep up your milk supply!? What plan are you doing? I’m so interested in everything that you are doing (not trying to be weird sorry if that came off weird)
weightwatchers,ffaw0ju,t1_ffats9o,1579745787.0,Thanks! I’m thinking about breastfeeding forever for the extra points! (Definitely just kidding!)
weightwatchers,ffavyb2,t1_ffakwm3,1579745745.0,"Thanks for the luck! I started on the blue plan but I just decided to switch to purple today! I’ve got a 9 month old and a 10 year old and parenting is definitely stressful! I had gotten down to 118 on weight watchers in college. That was a long time ago. Was that what the green plan is now? I don’t want to get that small again though, it was to thin then and it would look extra weird on me now with all the extra skin ha!"
weightwatchers,ffavjcv,t1_ffakjsj,1579745474.0,I tried a couple of different ways to lose weight including counting calories and intermittent fasting since she has been born but everything has significantly decreased my supply. She is 9 months old now and I finally made the decision to focus on my health first because at this point as long as I can pump 6 oz a day at work and breastfeed when I’m home I have enough frozen for her to never need formula. I had been calorie counting for about 3 weeks before switching to weight watchers and was pumping just under 6 oz at work yikes! So I switched to WW and it’s still my first week but mo day I got 7 oz and today I got 7.5 so it’s definitely helping so far!
weightwatchers,ffab79c,t1_ffaaxi2,1579731484.0,My daughter is nine months now and so far I haven’t used any formula but I also wasn’t able to keep up on any weight loss plans for more than a couple of weeks before my supply dropped and I was worried I wouldn’t have enough. I’ve finally gotten to the point where I’m going to have to take care of myself too and I’m so glad that WW is allowing me to do both at the same time!
AskReddit,feo35j8,t3_eq1wzh,1579294535.0,"I know this is selfish and crappy but about $225,000 after tax would make my life right now. My husband and I could pay off all of our debt and actually be able to put aside money for our kids to go to college. We have been slowly working on paying it down but it’s a long road."
AskReddit,feo2hzc,t1_fenbkyx,1579294202.0,Congratulations!!!! Good luck with the pregnancy!
gaming,fehbvf5,t1_feh2tx0,1579113364.0,Thank you for asking. It enabled me to order the book just now! My stepson is in therapy for several different issues and he also loves video games. The therapist has cut down his screen time allowance so that he barely has time to play. I’ve been hoping to find something that I might be able to use to encourage her and his mother to allow him to play more. I don’t know if this will be it but I’m sure it will be an interesting read regardless!
AdviceAnimals,fefes73,t1_feenflo,1579054789.0,I think a lot of people buy multiple similar items and return the ones they don’t like as much. I know several people who do this.
FondantHate,fe5emau,t1_fe53cli,1578868470.0,Omg I just noticed something. Was your dress lavande fondant? Funny that I discovered this on fondant hate.
FondantHate,fe2qhc7,t1_f5rk2i9,1578841746.0,I know this is an old post but I had to say something. That dress is amazing! I looked up the shop and found exactly what I had been looking for in a wedding dress! To bad it’s almost 2 years to late. If we renew our vows I will definitely be getting a dress from their! Thank you!
gaming,fdt66pd,t1_fdsp7p8,1578712437.0,My husband and I have a 10 year old and a 9 month old and we find time for both! Just got to be quiet(ish) after the kids go to sleep and be willing to have long breaks in between gaming sessions and be a zombie because of lack of sleep. It works out.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdss8lp,t1_fdsm5rl,1578707274.0,Actually mine was never that bad until I got pregnant last year. I thought it would go back to the way it was after I had her but it hasn’t. Right now my diet is very focused on what’s best for breastfeeding so I’ll have to wait another 3 months to try changing up my diet.
Fuckyoubrooke,fds84du,t3_emyk7y,1578696512.0,Don’t forget ugg boots and yoga pants or leggings with one of those fuzzy comfy sweater/sweatshirt things
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdryuvx,t1_fdrulx2,1578691819.0,Any suggestions on skincare? I’m looking for something to help with limited success.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdrqtok,t1_fdrpi1c,1578688224.0,Yeah my redness is more blotchy and on my cheeks chin and forehead his is very full coverage. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that before. Maybe I just don’t know any older alcoholics.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdrh44j,t1_fdqsats,1578684497.0,I’m very red. I am female and not an alcoholic. I just have rosacea.
AskReddit,fdpsmia,t1_fdprugr,1578638899.0,"No shit, that doesn’t mean you can’t point out that you spend a lot of money on things like feeding and clothing them when they are being a snarky teenager."
AskReddit,fdprl69,t1_fdov74n,1578637804.0,I didn’t say that it was what you said. I was responding to what you said. It’s perfectly reasonable for people to tell their children that they are expected to contribute and if the child responds by demanding payment then I don’t see what’s wrong with pointing out that you pay for literally all of their living expenses.
FuckYouKaren,fdopdyf,t3_embbtk,1578609900.0,To be fair I would also make that sacrifice. It’s the loss of one game of uno vs potential issues with Comcast and it At&T for the rest of my life...
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdnst9r,t1_fdmjsng,1578592122.0,I’m using breastfeeding to avoid mine. Counting the pregnancy I haven’t had a period since July 2018. Damn that’s a long time. Probably can’t keep it up much longer though she will be a year old soon.
AskReddit,fdnpemc,t1_fdmgygo,1578590391.0,"You are also expected to teach your child life lessons and how to be a decent human being, good family member and contributing member of society. Also to give them the skills that they will later need to raise their own children if they choose to have them. Babysitting can be an excellent teaching tool and the expectation that you occasionally contribute to the wellbeing of your family without a monetary reward is completely reasonable. Thinking that you should never have to do anything to contribute to your household and family’s wellbeing simply because you are their child is entitled and narcissistic. We don’t need to be raising little monsters who grow up and think that the world owes them everything for nothing."
aww,fdn1tik,t1_fdmz59e,1578574708.0,They’re *?
breastfeeding,fdm2h3c,t1_fdm2fst,1578538230.0,Me too!
breastfeeding,fdm1zjl,t1_fdm1oss,1578537902.0,Yes. As long as I am able to pump at least 6-7 oz a day and have enough to feed her when we are together I should almost make it to the year. I was feeling awful about it at work because I wasn’t getting much milk pumping and when I took of the pump I tried to see if it was just the pump by trying to self express but I didn’t get anything. As soon as I got home she started eating though and after 10 minutes of eating she coughed and spit a huge mouthful of milk all over me. That was the happiest I’ve ever been to have milk all over my shirt! I must just not be responding to my pump very well anymore.
breastfeeding,fdm1kig,t1_fdm0wbr,1578537622.0,I understand what you are getting at but the point of my goal is that I don’t want to use formula. I’m not saying that there is anything wrong with formula and I know that lots of people use it and I completely respect everyone’s right to make that choice. I just firmly believe that my body is capable of feeding my baby and her increased growth supports that. I realized after I got home tonight that I have plenty of milk when she is actually eating though some I’m feeling much better. If I’m only going to fail at being able to pump enough for her during the day I can live with that.
breastfeeding,fdm07en,t1_fdlyxsg,1578536700.0,The problem is that I’m able to move less and less. I was in physical therapy but my insurance only covered 8 sessions. I’ve tried yoga but I hurt myself worse and could barely walk for 5 days. Even grocery shopping is hard. My left butt cheek hurts after very little walking and my left leg starts to go numb after being on my feet for any length of time. Eating cleaner doesn’t help if you aren’t burning more calories than you are taking in and my limited mobility is making burning calories very difficult.
breastfeeding,fdlv3j5,t1_fdlqha9,1578533197.0,Thank you! I’m sure if it comes down to quoting I’ll find a way to feel good about how far I got but I’m a very stubborn person and I am having trouble with the possibility that I might not succeed in her never having formula and it’s heartbreaking. Right now I’m sitting on the floor playing with her stack cups with her and she keeps stopping and climbing into my shirt to eat so at least I must have some milk left when she’s eating straight from the tap!
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdl1mkz,t1_fdl026f,1578515478.0,The very skinny tip.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdkwyde,t1_fdkwpvy,1578512869.0,Maybe but she apparently has normal sized nipples and was also (possibly) able to push out a baby. She must* have had a c-section.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdkwlui,t1_fdkwdc4,1578512663.0,"Oh man I can’t even imagine trying to have sex with a baby carrot sized penis. Like how would the even thrust, it would pop out constantly... confused on they would have managed to have children."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdkw69o,t1_fdkvt2t,1578512409.0,A baby carrot is probably to big for mine but I’ve got 19mm flanges that I had to order from a third party because spectra only goes down to 20mm. My pump came with 24mm though so maybe a baby carrot would fit in that.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdkvnlz,t1_fdk7o8l,1578512102.0,I’m pumping right now and that would have to be a very very short skinny penis. Like 1.5 inches long and less than an inch around.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdkbtsu,t1_fdk6ngw,1578500566.0,I don’t think I’ve made it before. I do say that I have the reflexes of a tree stump fairly often though. My sensei actually pointed it out to me in High school.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdk644i,t1_fdjle2c,1578496933.0,I didn’t even blink. Then I started reading the comments and now I’m concerned that there is something wrong with me. I’ve always had the reflexes of a tree stump though so maybe it’s just that.
facepalm,fdh5aay,t1_fdh2dth,1578415684.0,"Oh man a chihuahua crossed with something larger with a strong jaw like a Rottweiler, German shepherd, pit bull, Doberman or something? Terrifying."
facepalm,fdgxwf2,t1_fdgtplc,1578411025.0,The most aggressive dog I’ve ever met was a chihuahua.
facepalm,fdgxnw7,t1_fdgnvoa,1578410861.0,"Mine too and he didn’t require any extra training to be kind. He is far more gentle with my 9 month old than my mother in laws husky, German shepherd and lab. He also cuddles with my cat, completely sweet and wonderful."
mildlyinfuriating,fd67lt1,t1_fd5f68n,1578186700.0,Oberweis?
funny,fd5z16v,t1_fd5ol3g,1578183299.0,Damn! And I thought the postpartum anxiety I’m dealing with was a difficult problem. Thank you guys for helping me put things in persepective.
insaneparents,fd2j3a4,t1_fd0ovl9,1578147957.0,We don’t have nearly enough background information to draw any conclusions at all. There could be a perfectly reasonable explanation. Of course it’s more likely that you are correct in your assumptions.
breastfeeding,fczng3q,t1_fcznagm,1578105053.0,"Yes, I feel the same way."
breastfeeding,fczn6wa,t1_fczml9j,1578104896.0,I was making an overly dramatic joke about the loss of a single drop of breastmilk to my husband because I think I’m hilarious but am actually not funny at all.
2meirl4meirl,fczgk75,t1_fcymz2e,1578100775.0,"Exactly, jet packing is my favorite!"
mildlyinteresting,fcygm42,t1_fcyg6yi,1578079784.0,I guess that makes sense. I’ve never spilled any kind of milk without cleaning it up right away before. Do you know why it does that?
mildlyinteresting,fcygj6u,t1_fcyfvpr,1578079735.0,"Interesting, that would never have crossed my mind. Also I’m fairly certain that it would be very irresponsible to use cocaine while breastfeeding. Well now I guess I understand why someone made a comment about all the coke I snort. That was originally a little upsetting so it’s nice to understand."
mildlyinteresting,fcyfqh2,t1_fcyfjw2,1578079455.0,I always take a picture of how much I got in my pump so that I can keep track of my production. I took the picture of the spilled drop to send to my husband. I was joking about the great loss of that particular drop.
mildlyinteresting,fcyfjpc,t1_fcyffo6,1578079340.0,"I don’t think so, it’s to precious to waste. That’s why I took the first picture. I was being overly dramatic about spilling a drop."
mildlyinteresting,fcyfd7i,t1_fcyf708,1578079232.0,Oh yeah my desk is pretty shiny it’s just a glare from the lights overhead. How does it look like coke?
mildlyinteresting,fcyf7q1,t1_fcyf0on,1578079189.0,"That’s a ridiculous and rude accusation.
Edit: I have been informed that the glare on my desk looks like white powder which people are assuming is cocaine apparently. I suppose it wasn’t as ridiculous an accusation as I first thought. Still a little upsetting though."
mildlyinteresting,fcyf6ia,t1_fcyf08q,1578079169.0,I went to put my milk away and get a paper towel but ended up getting stuck on a phone call. When I was done and went to clean it up it was clear and shiny.
mildlyinteresting,fcyez99,t1_fcyejll,1578079046.0,What other shit?
mildlyinteresting,fcyejpp,t1_fcyef25,1578078954.0,Definitely not what I would have expected to happen.
Perfectfit,fculld2,t1_fcujrjg,1577983676.0,Thank you! Happy new year to you as well!!!
Perfectfit,fcuirkr,t1_fcuf1u1,1577981931.0,Lol definitely just 2 rings!
Perfectfit,fcuik6d,t1_fcua88z,1577981794.0,"It actually is a perfect fit, my ring is rounded on the edges, I have a video that I took showing that you can lift the rings up and they stay together. I don’t know how to post the video though unless I did it as a new post."
Perfectfit,fctdhf8,t1_fct3ywi,1577939810.0,Hahaha
Perfectfit,fctdfcp,t1_fct6g9z,1577939759.0,Well a couple of weeks ago he was in the shower and I managed to get the baby down for a nap so I went into the bathroom to join him. I noticed his ring was on the counter so I decided I should take mine off too. I took my  ring off and decided that the safest place for it was inside his. I dropped it in and it got stuck. I had to have him separate them when we got out. Now you know!
Perfectfit,fct3rqo,t1_fct3dz0,1577932118.0,Hmmm. Definitely not.
Perfectfit,fct37hm,t1_fct2i16,1577931703.0,That’s disturbing.
AdviceAnimals,fclnnsn,t1_fcl9uty,1577752061.0,Even if they were in family counseling for 8 years that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t stick together. Family counseling can be a very helpful tool in a marriage. Especially if one or both partners have mental issues that might make it hard for them to always communicate effectively.
AskReddit,fcljf6w,t1_fcl1k2f,1577749186.0,Are you my husband? He would say that too...
wholesomememes,fc5a82i,t1_fc4hz31,1577450757.0,"Thank you for that, being a step parent is often a thankless endeavor. Especially with a moody preteen."

WatchPeopleDieInside,fdrqtok,t1_fdrpi1c,1578688224.0,Yeah my redness is more blotchy and on my cheeks chin and forehead his is very full coverage. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever seen that before. Maybe I just donâ€™t know any older alcoholics.
WatchPeopleDieInside,fdrh44j,t1_fdqsats,1578684497.0,Iâ€™m very red. I am female and not an alcoholic. I just have rosacea.
AskReddit,fdpsmia,t1_fdprugr,1578638899.0,"No shit, that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t point out that you spend a lot of money on things like feeding and clothing them when they are being a snarky teenager."
AskReddit,fdprl69,t1_fdov74n,1578637804.0,I didnâ€™t say that it was what you said. I was responding to what you said. Itâ€™s perfectly reasonable for people to tell their children that they are expected to contribute and if the child responds by demanding payment then I donâ€™t see whatâ€™s wrong with pointing out that you pay for literally all of their living expenses.
FuckYouKaren,fdopdyf,t3_embbtk,1578609900.0,To be fair I would also make that sacrifice. Itâ€™s the loss of one game of uno vs potential issues with Comcast and it At&T for the rest of my life...
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdnst9r,t1_fdmjsng,1578592122.0,Iâ€™m using breastfeeding to avoid mine. Counting the pregnancy I havenâ€™t had a period since July 2018. Damn thatâ€™s a long time. Probably canâ€™t keep it up much longer though she will be a year old soon.
AskReddit,fdnpemc,t1_fdmgygo,1578590391.0,"You are also expected to teach your child life lessons and how to be a decent human being, good family member and contributing member of society. Also to give them the skills that they will later need to raise their own children if they choose to have them. Babysitting can be an excellent teaching tool and the expectation that you occasionally contribute to the wellbeing of your family without a monetary reward is completely reasonable. Thinking that you should never have to do anything to contribute to your household and familyâ€™s wellbeing simply because you are their child is entitled and narcissistic. We donâ€™t need to be raising little monsters who grow up and think that the world owes them everything for nothing."
aww,fdn1tik,t1_fdmz59e,1578574708.0,Theyâ€™re *?
breastfeeding,fdm2h3c,t1_fdm2fst,1578538230.0,Me too!
breastfeeding,fdm1zjl,t1_fdm1oss,1578537902.0,Yes. As long as I am able to pump at least 6-7 oz a day and have enough to feed her when we are together I should almost make it to the year. I was feeling awful about it at work because I wasnâ€™t getting much milk pumping and when I took of the pump I tried to see if it was just the pump by trying to self express but I didnâ€™t get anything. As soon as I got home she started eating though and after 10 minutes of eating she coughed and spit a huge mouthful of milk all over me. That was the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been to have milk all over my shirt! I must just not be responding to my pump very well anymore.
breastfeeding,fdm1kig,t1_fdm0wbr,1578537622.0,I understand what you are getting at but the point of my goal is that I donâ€™t want to use formula. Iâ€™m not saying that there is anything wrong with formula and I know that lots of people use it and I completely respect everyoneâ€™s right to make that choice. I just firmly believe that my body is capable of feeding my baby and her increased growth supports that. I realized after I got home tonight that I have plenty of milk when she is actually eating though some Iâ€™m feeling much better. If Iâ€™m only going to fail at being able to pump enough for her during the day I can live with that.
breastfeeding,fdm07en,t1_fdlyxsg,1578536700.0,The problem is that Iâ€™m able to move less and less. I was in physical therapy but my insurance only covered 8 sessions. Iâ€™ve tried yoga but I hurt myself worse and could barely walk for 5 days. Even grocery shopping is hard. My left butt cheek hurts after very little walking and my left leg starts to go numb after being on my feet for any length of time. Eating cleaner doesnâ€™t help if you arenâ€™t burning more calories than you are taking in and my limited mobility is making burning calories very difficult.
breastfeeding,fdlv3j5,t1_fdlqha9,1578533197.0,Thank you! Iâ€™m sure if it comes down to quoting Iâ€™ll find a way to feel good about how far I got but Iâ€™m a very stubborn person and I am having trouble with the possibility that I might not succeed in her never having formula and itâ€™s heartbreaking. Right now Iâ€™m sitting on the floor playing with her stack cups with her and she keeps stopping and climbing into my shirt to eat so at least I must have some milk left when sheâ€™s eating straight from the tap!
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdl1mkz,t1_fdl026f,1578515478.0,The very skinny tip.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdkwyde,t1_fdkwpvy,1578512869.0,Maybe but she apparently has normal sized nipples and was also (possibly) able to push out a baby. She must* have had a c-section.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdkwlui,t1_fdkwdc4,1578512663.0,"Oh man I canâ€™t even imagine trying to have sex with a baby carrot sized penis. Like how would the even thrust, it would pop out constantly... confused on they would have managed to have children."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdkw69o,t1_fdkvt2t,1578512409.0,A baby carrot is probably to big for mine but Iâ€™ve got 19mm flanges that I had to order from a third party because spectra only goes down to 20mm. My pump came with 24mm though so maybe a baby carrot would fit in that.
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdkvnlz,t1_fdk7o8l,1578512102.0,Iâ€™m pumping right now and that would have to be a very very short skinny penis. Like 1.5 inches long and less than an inch around.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdkbtsu,t1_fdk6ngw,1578500566.0,I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve made it before. I do say that I have the reflexes of a tree stump fairly often though. My sensei actually pointed it out to me in High school.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fdk644i,t1_fdjle2c,1578496933.0,I didnâ€™t even blink. Then I started reading the comments and now Iâ€™m concerned that there is something wrong with me. Iâ€™ve always had the reflexes of a tree stump though so maybe itâ€™s just that.
facepalm,fdh5aay,t1_fdh2dth,1578415684.0,"Oh man a chihuahua crossed with something larger with a strong jaw like a Rottweiler, German shepherd, pit bull, Doberman or something? Terrifying."
facepalm,fdgxwf2,t1_fdgtplc,1578411025.0,The most aggressive dog Iâ€™ve ever met was a chihuahua.
facepalm,fdgxnw7,t1_fdgnvoa,1578410861.0,"Mine too and he didnâ€™t require any extra training to be kind. He is far more gentle with my 9 month old than my mother in laws husky, German shepherd and lab. He also cuddles with my cat, completely sweet and wonderful."
mildlyinfuriating,fd67lt1,t1_fd5f68n,1578186700.0,Oberweis?
funny,fd5z16v,t1_fd5ol3g,1578183299.0,Damn! And I thought the postpartum anxiety Iâ€™m dealing with was a difficult problem. Thank you guys for helping me put things in persepective.
insaneparents,fd2j3a4,t1_fd0ovl9,1578147957.0,We donâ€™t have nearly enough background information to draw any conclusions at all. There could be a perfectly reasonable explanation. Of course itâ€™s more likely that you are correct in your assumptions.
breastfeeding,fczng3q,t1_fcznagm,1578105053.0,"Yes, I feel the same way."
breastfeeding,fczn6wa,t1_fczml9j,1578104896.0,I was making an overly dramatic joke about the loss of a single drop of breastmilk to my husband because I think Iâ€™m hilarious but am actually not funny at all.
2meirl4meirl,fczgk75,t1_fcymz2e,1578100775.0,"Exactly, jet packing is my favorite!"
mildlyinteresting,fcygm42,t1_fcyg6yi,1578079784.0,I guess that makes sense. Iâ€™ve never spilled any kind of milk without cleaning it up right away before. Do you know why it does that?
mildlyinteresting,fcygj6u,t1_fcyfvpr,1578079735.0,"Interesting, that would never have crossed my mind. Also Iâ€™m fairly certain that it would be very irresponsible to use cocaine while breastfeeding. Well now I guess I understand why someone made a comment about all the coke I snort. That was originally a little upsetting so itâ€™s nice to understand."
mildlyinteresting,fcyfqh2,t1_fcyfjw2,1578079455.0,I always take a picture of how much I got in my pump so that I can keep track of my production. I took the picture of the spilled drop to send to my husband. I was joking about the great loss of that particular drop.
mildlyinteresting,fcyfjpc,t1_fcyffo6,1578079340.0,"I donâ€™t think so, itâ€™s to precious to waste. Thatâ€™s why I took the first picture. I was being overly dramatic about spilling a drop."
mildlyinteresting,fcyfd7i,t1_fcyf708,1578079232.0,Oh yeah my desk is pretty shiny itâ€™s just a glare from the lights overhead. How does it look like coke?
mildlyinteresting,fcyf7q1,t1_fcyf0on,1578079189.0,"Thatâ€™s a ridiculous and rude accusation.
Edit: I have been informed that the glare on my desk looks like white powder which people are assuming is cocaine apparently. I suppose it wasnâ€™t as ridiculous an accusation as I first thought. Still a little upsetting though."
mildlyinteresting,fcyf6ia,t1_fcyf08q,1578079169.0,I went to put my milk away and get a paper towel but ended up getting stuck on a phone call. When I was done and went to clean it up it was clear and shiny.
mildlyinteresting,fcyez99,t1_fcyejll,1578079046.0,What other shit?
mildlyinteresting,fcyejpp,t1_fcyef25,1578078954.0,Definitely not what I would have expected to happen.
Perfectfit,fculld2,t1_fcujrjg,1577983676.0,Thank you! Happy new year to you as well!!!
Perfectfit,fcuirkr,t1_fcuf1u1,1577981931.0,Lol definitely just 2 rings!
Perfectfit,fcuik6d,t1_fcua88z,1577981794.0,"It actually is a perfect fit, my ring is rounded on the edges, I have a video that I took showing that you can lift the rings up and they stay together. I donâ€™t know how to post the video though unless I did it as a new post."
Perfectfit,fctdhf8,t1_fct3ywi,1577939810.0,Hahaha
Perfectfit,fctdfcp,t1_fct6g9z,1577939759.0,Well a couple of weeks ago he was in the shower and I managed to get the baby down for a nap so I went into the bathroom to join him. I noticed his ring was on the counter so I decided I should take mine off too. I took my  ring off and decided that the safest place for it was inside his. I dropped it in and it got stuck. I had to have him separate them when we got out. Now you know!
Perfectfit,fct3rqo,t1_fct3dz0,1577932118.0,Hmmm. Definitely not.
Perfectfit,fct37hm,t1_fct2i16,1577931703.0,Thatâ€™s disturbing.
AdviceAnimals,fclnnsn,t1_fcl9uty,1577752061.0,Even if they were in family counseling for 8 years that doesnâ€™t mean they shouldnâ€™t stick together. Family counseling can be a very helpful tool in a marriage. Especially if one or both partners have mental issues that might make it hard for them to always communicate effectively.
AskReddit,fcljf6w,t1_fcl1k2f,1577749186.0,Are you my husband? He would say that too...
wholesomememes,fc5a82i,t1_fc4hz31,1577450757.0,"Thank you for that, being a step parent is often a thankless endeavor. Especially with a moody preteen."
AmItheAsshole,fbjjyni,t1_fbigwuj,1576934962.0,"Thatâ€™s certainly possible, we are only hearing his side of this after all. If you only heard my husbandâ€™s side of something you would have no idea what actually happened. Perhaps he should pick up a copy of the Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work and read it while he is out of town next week."
