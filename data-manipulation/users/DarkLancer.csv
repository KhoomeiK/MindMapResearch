science,ffi8ygc,t1_ffi0ci5,1579968148.0,"While comparing ourselves to fake images may contribute to poor relationship skill, I believe the way social media changed how conversations happen to be a bigger culprit. My main argument is how social media makes it easier to disengage from a conflict in comparison to a face to face interaction or, talking at someone versus to someone. They then do not know how to navigate conflict in day to day interactions.

So why not just have relationships online? Well as much as people want to disagree, we haven't evolved in tandem with our technological improvements. We fundamentally require physical engagement which a screen cannot provide. Studies such as the wireframe monkey or those showing the benefits of green space confirm that we as a species need this natural contact.

So I think we are lonelier in part because we try to substitute online relationships for real ones (I understand why) and they are just not as fulfilling. Key note, this is a generalization of the US population."
