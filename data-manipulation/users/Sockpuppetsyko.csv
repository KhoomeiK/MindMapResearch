wholesomememes,ffhzg2j,t1_ffhv4gi,1579960286.0,"Let me answer that with a quick story.  We have a mini schnauzer.  When she was like 3ish we also had a pair of rats (for those that dont know pet rats are like mini dogs).  We would have them out often and our mini, Midnight, would just watch.  Well eventually the rats wondered over and started play with her beard and she didnt mind.    

Eventually they got scared one day and ran to Midnight.  She put her paws around them and just kind of shielded them from anything.  Eventually the rats pretty much just hung out with her and she would watch them like a mother.     

Eventually things happened and no more rats.  Midnight didn't do much but lay around, look were their cage was and so on.  We took her to a pet store hoping to break her funk.  Near the floor level was the rat section of the rodent area.  She saw them, say there and just whined a bit.      

So when people say dogs dont love like us, I just think they haven't spent enough time around the right dog."

gachagaming,feublyl,t3_eqfh16,1579384984.0,"The gameplay itself is decent and requires more thought then most gacha.  Story is a mixed bag, yeah it has a nice setup and world, but for all the talking very little ever happens.  It's a lot of text that says very little.           

Replay mode is just a wierd auto.  It just records what happens and then you need to sit and wait each reply.  So either nothing changes and it's a waste of your time or something will change here and there and it's a faulty auto system.  I just dont get the logic of it.        


The while base thing is way to over player pressuring.  Morale to watch, facilities to constantly click for stuff and so on.  It's like a constant reminder of hey you should click back into the game again.  Which is too bad because it could have been something cool, like what X-Com had.  Instead it's just a means to push the player back to the gacha more often.           

Gacha rates are not good and your dealing with 3 through 6 stars, with 4 being the highest chance.  However many tiers of rarity are very useful.  Characters are way to female heavy though, like there is maybe a 10 percent male character ratio.  It seems like they wanted a wiafu game but chickened out at the end.  (Though I read this does get more equal with time).     

Graphics though, wow they are cheap.  Very poor detail, barely animated chibis.  Clean line work just goes to waste with how poor they look.  They move as well as a south park character as well.      

In the end I will try for a bit as there is enough good points here to make it worth while."
