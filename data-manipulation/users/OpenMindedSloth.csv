Miami,fef7j4v,t1_fe54gtj,1579050030.0,"I have 2 friends that I've known for years. This year, I had an opportunity to witness them driving and they're the assholes hanging out in the passing lane that we all hate.




Them: ""idk why everyone is riding my ass?""




me: ""you need to move over""





them: ""but I'm going the speed limit!!""




me: ""bitch you're doing 63 and the flow of traffic is 75""





unsurprisingly, both of them suck balls at driving and have cops for parents...."
