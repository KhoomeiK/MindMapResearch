Your furnace will only turn off when the thermostat gets to the set temperature, if it working correctly. Place a reliable thermometer next to thermostat to see the temp. Use a hair dryer or electric space heater in that area to get the temp above set temp to see if it turns off. If not it is probably a thermostat problem. 

Too hot upstairs, cold downstairs? As another poster suggested open vent downstairs and close or limit the ones upstairs. Set up a $20 box fan to move air from up to down to balance temps. Kind of like an internal whole house fan. 

I am assuming 2nd floor vents are in the floor so would be adjacent or share ducts with downstairs. If you close a bunch of vents does the flow of air from other vents increase a lot? If not there may be a leak in the vents, but I don't know where that air would go. Where is the actual furnace located, have you checked all the ducts you can reach? Have you replaced or cleaned the filter?"
