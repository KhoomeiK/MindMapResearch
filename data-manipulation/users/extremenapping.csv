gaybros,ffcgspl,t1_ffc2mmn,1579799140.0,Get an app that can track your eating habits....watch your carbs closely. If you skew the ratio too much you go into ketosis and that's like having the flu.
gaybros,ffbsc9u,t3_esmshl,1579780891.0,"Depending on your balancing of micro and macro nutrients 2-4 weeks is correct. 

Did you ease into the diet change or go cold turkey on everything? 

How low have you gone with carbs?
 You could push yourself into ketosis which is no fun especially if you dont expect it. 

A way to ease the highs and lows is to get yourself on a meal schedule. Just make it routine and you body will adapt accordingly."

If so, I got counseled for being near two battle buddies while they ate lunch at the hospital cafeteria. They both had appointments, one ran late so we couldn't make it to the DFAC for lunch. They bought sandwiches and I got yelled at for not stopping them. I had to write a 500 word ""essay"" on how what happened can effect morale.....I wrote a 500 word criticism of my punishment and never heard a word about it.

At my Father's funeral this past July I asked people to stop apologizing, that it was not their fault and ""sorry"" was not going to bring him back. My brother and I asked for stories about him we never heard before, we asked people to share positive memories. My Father wanted his funeral to be a celebration of life, all it needed was an open bar to become a party. The first viewing my mother cried the entire time, the second everyone was smiling and laughing talking about how great my father was."
