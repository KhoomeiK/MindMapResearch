Stormworks,fel4a8r,t1_fel35zv,1579213746.0,"Okay, I give up: I was referring to the small fusion reactors that are more typically referred to as ""Hydrogen Bombs""

The ""lighting up"" I mention was a very factious use of the phrase. But you must admit, they do produce a great deal of energy. Admittedly not electrical and more heat and air movement."
Stormworks,fel26cg,t1_fekynxv,1579212440.0,"I read about it in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. They say that there are very many, very compact, fusion reactors currently stationed in submarines, missile silos, and airbases around the world. Ready at a moments notice to be swiftly delivered to places that need a bit of fusion. Why, some submarines have dozens of (admittedly dormant) fusion reactors ready to provide fusion energy to cities around the world.

Of course, the people at the Bulletin are quite concerned by this.

Again: I'm being needlessly pedantic."

Of course, they aren't currently active, but I've been assured they can begin producing prodigious amounts of energy at very short notice. Yes, these fusion reactors are ready to begin lighting up cities, factories, and military bases in as little as 15 minutes.^^but ^^I'm ^^being ^^needlessly ^^pedantic"

rue (v.)
""feel regret,"" Old English hreowan ""make sorry, distress, grieve"" (class II strong verb; past tense hreaw, past participle hrowen), from Proto-Germanic *khrewan (source also of Old Frisian riowa, Middle Dutch rouwen, Old Dutch hrewan, German reuen ""to sadden, cause repentance""); in part, blended with Old English weak verb hreowian ""feel pain or sorrow,"" and perhaps influenced by Old Norse hryggja ""make sad,"" both from Proto-Germanic *khruwjan, all from PIE root *kreue- (2) ""to push, strike"" (see anacrusis). Related: Rued; ruing."

todayilearned,fc0cmev,t1_fc0bx5g,1577286982.0,"Well, the soviets were worried enough about it that they incorporate armor specifically designed to absorb neutrons, but I'll give you that it probably wouldn't be super effective regardless.  

But it was the 50s and 60s and any engineering or defense problem was likely to be answered with ""But what if we made it atomic?"""
todayilearned,fc07x7t,t1_fby0g8t,1577282313.0,"> neutron bombs

Eh, not really. Everyone talks about the 'they kill people but leave buildings intact' thing, but the actual purpose was as an anti-tank weapon.

The problem is that tanks are more or less invulnerable to the blast and heat effects of a nuclear weapon, even when the explosion is fairly close(meaning you would need lots of bombs to stop large tank formations). So the idea was to use a nuclear reaction that produced lots of neutrons, which could get through the tanks armor, but still produces a rather substantial nuclear explosion as a byproduct.

The problem is that this kills the tankers, but not very quickly. So they would still have several days or even weeks to cause trouble before dying all while probably being willing to fight harder because they know they are already doomed."
