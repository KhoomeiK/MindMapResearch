Our village/town is small enough and we all know each other, so when the END comes, I am set. I have already made heavily detailed plans on how to build the castle and how it should be run. My 3 childhood friends are the only ones I will trust and they all have invaluable skills in such situations. 

One is a mechanic that can build anything simpler that a helicopter (he owns a scrap yard 20 meters from my house), second one is in our countries Special Forces (he would make Daryl Dixon look like a boy scout), third guy is an engineer (very handy when we build Castle Z) and I, a doctor with 2TB of survival docs and manuals and supplies to last me 1 year. Between the four of us, we may commandeer the castle and live our lives as we see fit.

I have shared my plan with only my friends and they are the type of people that no matter how crazy it sounds, if its coming from a friend, they're in. I have planned (as best as a human can) for a nuclear fallout, because my prepping philosophy is: If you prep for nukes, everything else is just a walk in the park.
