Stoicism,ffsxqg9,t1_ffrpn9a,1580196864.0,"I do regular mindfullness meditation. I use an app called Headspace. It helps you develop focussed attention and visualisation techniques. You can add Stoic mantras to them if you like. 

Meditation helps me, both during the excercise and the day, to understand my emotions and actually feel them which allows me to deal with them and remain in control over them. 

I'm not sure what you're referring to as random bullshit, but the app Headspace is pretty good. You get a free trail with just the basics to get you started. I also read a book on Mindfullness with lots of scientific research on the effectiveness of different strategies. I can't remeber the name at the moment, but I'm sure you can find something similar.

Anyway, during the conversation I remained calm. In the car ride to the office I saw this as a possible outcome for today and I have accepted months ago that this might happen (when I first got sick). I discussed possibilities with my employer for future opportunities, drove home, explained what had occured to my girlfriend, went to the gym, medited when I got home and am now enjoying a glass of wine before we get some sushi. 

I could've lost my shit but what would be the point. The decision is made, and although illegal, I can't change it. Because I remained calm I have future possibilities at the company. 

This is also a chance. I was already questioning if this job was it for me, and now I have motivation to try new things. 

I have been meditating for about 2 months and reading up on stoicism for the same amount of time. That has been instrumental to my response here. My gf even noted this afternoon how well I'm handling all of this for the past few weeks.

In 3 weeks time I managed to built enough stamina to run a 5k in just over half an hour (35 min) on grassy, muddy and unlevel terrain. Pretty happy with the fast progress and I can't wait to see how my improved cardiovascular health by not smoking a fucking pack a day will translate to my gains in the gym.

Also, after two years of being lazy I can still deadlift 100kg (220lb) for 5x5 so that's nice. I hope I can get back up to my pr one day.

Edit: just finished a 7k. I didn't time it but I guess I did it in about 45. This going really well. I'm shocked how easy I'm building my stamina as a non-smoker compared to when I smoked. Ofcourse I knew it would be much easier but it's simply incredible how large the difference is."

CasualConversation,ffih7ox,t1_ffi9usd,1579973802.0,"Yes there is research on it:

""The link between marijuana and psychosis goes beyond a short-lived high. If you already have schizophrenia and use the drug, your symptoms may get worse. You may have more psychotic episodes and spend more time in the hospital.
Researchers also have found that if you carry certain types of specific genes that affect brain chemistry, marijuana use can raise the chance you’ll have schizophrenia. One of those genes is called AKT1. Another is called COMT.

Cannabis may cause schizophrenia symptoms to start earlier in life, too. Typically, men show signs of the disorder in their late teens to early 20s, and women in their late 20s to early 30s. Using marijuana may make symptoms show up as much as 3 years earlier.
The age at which you start using marijuana also might make a difference. Earlier use, especially during the teen years, may mean a greater chance of having schizophrenia, perhaps because your brain is still developing during this time.
If you have a parent or sibling with schizophrenia, you already have a higher chance of getting the disease. Using cannabis can make your odds even worse, taking them from one in 10 to one in five.""

Edit: because I have some visibility here, let me add a few things you can do to help. 

Reduce red meat consumption. I'm not saying you have to go vegan, but red meat is production causes huge amounts of forests to be cut down, produces tons of GHG's and costs tons of water. Eating steak every now and then is fine, but opting for chicking or just vegtables some days helps. 

Fly less. Don't go on cruises.

Plant trees or donate to tree planting organisations. Trees suck huge amounts of CO2 out of the air. Planting 1 trillion of them could potentially suck 25% of all carbon out of the air, our about 2/3 of humanities carbon output of all time: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76

Possible donation site: https://www.trilliontreecampaign.org/donate-trees

This however *is not the solution* if we don't stop emitting these GHG's. It will just buy time if we keep doing things as we currently are so, for the love of whatever you believe in, vote. Vote for candidates with plans and goals to cut out CO2 emissions completely and effectively. This is by far the most important thing you can do. Citizins can only do so much, politics and business is where the *real* change must come from. After voting, hold your politicians accountable to their promises.

Edit: voordat iemand aankomt met ""het gebeurd wel dat men niet moet stoppen met roken"", dat klopt. Maar dat is omdat het ophoesten van teer voor zeer zwakke mensen fataal kan worden. Dat heeft *niks* met de verslavende werking van nicotine te maken of met hoe moeilijk het afkicken ervan is in tegenstelling tot bv. Alcohol, waarbij een dilerium tremens dodelijk kan zijn."
thenetherlands,fddbk99,t1_fdd9ikk,1578304190.0,"Hoe snel en makkelijk je verslaafd raakt en hoe moeilijk het is om ermee te stoppen zijn 2 verschillende dingen. 

Je raakt makkelijker verslaafd aan roken omdat het sociaal geaccepteerd is en je na gebruik nog kan functioneren. Als je een lijntje coke neemt is dat niet zo. Dus waar het laatste door veel gebruikers bewust word genomen op feesten en verder niet of nauwelijks, laat staan als eerste waarmee je opstaat, is de kans op gewoonte-vorming vele malen lager. Dit is een zeer groot onderdeel van verslaving. Als je die gewoonte-vorming wel hebt bij bv. Coke, zoals gebruikers van herione of crack meestal ook hebben, dan is het ermee stoppen *extreem* moeilijk. 

Ik zeg dit als ex-pakje per dag-roker en iemand die met 'junkies' heeft gewerkt, mijn stoppen met roken kwam niet in de buurt van wat alcoholisten of coke verslaafden meemaken."
ClimateActionPlan,fda85va,t3_eke8vk,1578242838.0,"No. 

We've done horrible damage and the fires are a partly an outcome of that (also because of the budget cuts to the fire service). However just because we can see outcomes, doesn't mean we can't save our civilisation. This is to be expected and should encourage more action, not spur indifference, fatalism and inaction."

I don't really feel like arguing over it at all. My point was just that because one homeless person was an asshole, others should not be judged over it. That is all.
