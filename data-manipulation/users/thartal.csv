deadbydaylight,ff4su08,t3_erhpll,1579571612.0,"That's rare. When I play killer and win (4k), i rarely get a GG. It's mostly rage-quit or shit-talk. 

Guess when I get GGs? When I did poorly as killer. 

I get the bitterness, survivor mains. I play survivor too and when I get my ass handed to me, I am sometimes bitter and angry. But I can still squeeze out a ""gg"" and so can you."

cats,fekg308,t3_epjsv9,1579199306.0,"It sounds like you're very much in the midst of grief, so I'm not sure how you'll receive this. I also imagine you already know this stuff so I'll just offer it up as a reminder. Maybe it will help out.

Remind yourself that pet ownership is about giving them a good long life, which you did, and not about having them live as long as you do. In other words, having pets pass away is a part of the deal. You delivered on your end. Take solace in the fact your kitty had a good long life with you. 

Pet owners typically have big hearts. They love animals, and they love that they can give an animal a good life. We are caretakers. It might be too early to think about this, but if you agree that pet ownership is about giving the animal a quality life while they live and that it is always temporary (from your perspective, because you outlive them), then you know that it is also time (or soon will be) to give that same kind of love and care to another animal. In other words, you did a good thing by having her, and by having her for so long! Now, you can do it again for another furry-soul."
