Rateme,fe8t2dl,t3_eo1oo2,1578930477.0,Goddamn! You are extremely attractive! No need to improve.
Rateme,fe6ncgx,t1_fe6n3rk,1578896889.0,"I see now that you're actually just a child so I won't take this much further, but I'd just like to point out that the only way you could have won a spelling bee is if all the other contestants were your students. It's okay, kid, I wasn't great at spelling when I was 8 either. You'll get there. Good luck, champ!"
Rateme,fe6mwlj,t1_fe6mm25,1578896413.0,"Whatever hahaha. You clearly don't even know what either of those words mean. Plus, you literally just copied what I said to you so I can't even give you a participation award. Oh, sorry. You probably don't understand big-brain words like 'participation' so I'll put it in terms you will understand. You spell bad... and... you don't... even put effort into your... insults..."
Rateme,fe6jat7,t1_fe02g2c,1578892722.0,"You not finding someone attractive doesn't mean they shouldn't put themselves out there, you conceited prick."
Rateme,fe6iywy,t1_fdzv83l,1578892403.0,This illiterate douche-bag gets a 0/10 from me.
Rateme,fe2lfjd,t1_fe0xp62,1578839933.0,"I appreciate the advice, and I hope it doesn't sound like I'm just rejecting it without consideration, but I think t-shirts and flannels have a wider appeal. Certainly they aren't for everyone (nothing is,) but I think most people either like or are okay with t-shirts and flannels. It could just be where I'm from too. It's quite cold here and it rains pretty much year-round so I would look like a real doofus wearing a collared shirt around here. I'm glad you like my glasses, though :) Good to know I'm not the only one who likes them because SPOILER ALERT: I'm not losing the glasses haha. I think they look good on me and the confidence they give me definitely outways any slight reduction in attractiveness that some may perceive."
Rateme,fe072xk,t3_emkm0y,1578804766.0,"You kinda look like a mix between Jake Gyllenhall and Brendan Fraser. Not really a good or bad thing, just an observation."
Rateme,fe06x8m,t3_emns8v,1578804637.0,"I think you could be very attractive with a couple of changes. I'd lose the lip-ring, cut the hair a bit shorter and I'd say yes on the glasses, but not those ones. I think you'd look better with a thinner set of frames. I could be wrong, though. I personally wear thick frames too and I love them."
Rateme,fe05xlg,t1_fe02hux,1578803865.0,"Not really, unfortunately. Probably just have someone else take them. You can't really get a good angle on yourself."
