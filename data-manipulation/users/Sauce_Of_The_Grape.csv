facepalm,ffu9aji,t1_ffu5yt4,1580237180.0,Are his words or facts being perverted for this context? No. Ivanka was communicating with her dad how government doesn’t change or the media. People will always be ready to jump something for their own advantage. The irony is while she is addressing this someone literally does it to her.
facepalm,fftzrf3,t1_fftuxd6,1580231312.0,Actually he was the uneducated one here as the quote Ivanka used was from a letter to his sick daughter. It had nothing to do with his denial of the rape charge. Before just taking what a random person comments look for the actual information. You can find the original letter and quote in the links of some other comments.

facepalm,fftlspi,t1_fftcfoq,1580223825.0,No it is not dumb shit. This is a quote from a letter Thomas sent his SICK daughter apologizing how work had been so busy. The guy is outsourced and false in the comment as it was not at all related to that case.
facepalm,fftllq7,t1_fftdqy1,1580223688.0,That is a tragic story. However the tweet here is outsourced and false. The quote Ivanka is taking here is a letter from Thomas to his daughter apologizing that he cant come to see her due to work. She was sick at the time so it was really hard on both of them. Someone found a link to an online copy in the comments if you are interested in reading the whole thing.
facepalm,fftl98z,t1_fftj4sj,1580223444.0,Ikr? Since the invention of the internet we have had the best spread of knowledge and communication however it has equally come with a downside. Ignorant and just completely unsourced and discredited information spreads like wild fire and no one attempts to combat it. I recently came upon a group on discord that tried telling me the holocaust didnt happen and the concentration camps weren’t bad because this book called The Jewish Persecution: Fact or Fictions says so. Like I’m sorry what is wrong with you? Anyway thanks for trying to pursue the spreading of actual fact

Not everyone has to know it all but that doesn’t remove the value or importance. In our current society we specialize in the knowledge of our position yet we still possess knowledge of other things. Tell me how is understanding or possessing intelligence on other matters useless? During the medieval ages wether you were going to be a tax collector, Knight, or farmer if you went to a school you were taught the knowledge of all these aspects because it’s better to know than be ignorant. Plus it ensures you have the best opportunity for what field you desire to go in. Modern education system function in much the same way so I yet to see how any type of knowledge is useless."
