Create it by eg:

Import into script with:

    $Creds = Import-Clixml -Path  'C:\script\pwd.xml'
For use with Powershell cmdlets you can probably use the `$Creds` object as is. For use with other stuff you can extract the username with `$Creds.Username` and `$Creds.GetNetworkCredential().Password` respectively.

The user that creates the file must be the same as the one running the script, and it has to be on the same computer. If that's not possible you can also use a keyfile to encrypt the password (should be able to find some references if you google ""powershell encrypt password keyfile"" or something like that. Anyone that can reach the keyfile can decrypt though so make sure to keep it safe.

You could also store it in the credential vault in Windows as a third option.
