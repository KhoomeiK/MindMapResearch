BobsTavern,ffg0z13,t1_fffvv6h,1579896098.0,I think what makes demons feel more oppressive than the other strategies is that you hit your build around minions so early. Juggler and watcher are both tier 3 meaning there are more of them in the pool and you get them so much earlier than something like brann or baron.  You can have lobbies where five people are successfully going demons which isn’t really possible with most other builds as there’s too much competition for scarce resources.
VictoriaBC,fffwhcn,t1_fffrm6v,1579893319.0,Not that homeless population hasn’t exploded but a second factor is that Pandora is starting to gentrify so the homeless are less concentrated in that one area and have been pushed into all the downtown neighbourhoods making their presence in the city much more visible.

BobsTavern,ffcm475,t1_ffchsz1,1579802366.0,Yeah I don’t get the arguments that demons are fine because they lose to divine shield murlocs. Divine shield murlocs are insanely difficult to pull off requiring tier 5 and 6 minions and taking a ton of mid-game damage while demons are one of the easiest strategies to get to the late game with.

Demons are strong early game, very strong mid-game, and transition well into the late game only losing to divine shield murlocs. There’s not really any way to tech against demons either.  A single zapp wrecks any baron build but a single maexxna isn’t doing shit to a late-game demon board."

Half the time there are people lined up next to you so you have no personal space and the other half you’re sitting like two feet away from a stinky bathroom.

The Bucks cruised to the ECF going through Detroit, who were by far the worst team in the playoffs, and Boston who spectacularly imploded.  They had like 10 days of rest and home court advantage for the ECF.  

Toronto was their first real competition and had just been through a brutal 7-game series with Philly, had basically no rest after, and shut them the fuck down. They made the entire team, and Giannis in particular, look one dimensional with their strong defence. 

That’s why people think the Bucks underperformed - it’s not because they lost to the eventual champs it’s the way they lost. They had every advantage but once the transition buckets dried up and they were facing a strong half-court defence who had seven games to make adjustments they got convincingly stopped."
