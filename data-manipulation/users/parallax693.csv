schoolpsychology,fctckst,t3_eisi5m,1577939036.0,"It really depends on whether you would seriously leave the area.  Higher pay is attractive because usually the rest of your raises are a percentage of your base pay (I'm in IL, strong union).  I'm not sure how nonunion schools work in regards to raises, tenure, and all of that.  The lead psych thing is a bummer but if you are assigned to fewer schools and like the team(s) in the schools you'll be assigned to, I would stay and gain 3-5 yrs experience while doing research in the parts of the country you are thinking of moving to.  My first 5 years was just learning the ropes and gaining experience.  So much that my grad school experience did not cover back in the day."
AskDocs,fcs8yro,t1_fcs8lc7,1577913137.0,"I should also say that for conditions like autism, early intervention is better, ideally getting services starting through your state or country when a toddler, but still giving them an extra year of preschool, waiting a yr more for kindergarten."
AskDocs,fcs8lc7,t1_fcraqyx,1577912975.0,"Within the spectrum of all kids, with the influence of nature and nurture, most will not need to be redshirted. (REDSHIRTING is a sports term but loosely means holding someone back now so they can participate at a later date.  In my school district our cut off for kids entering a grade is September.  The youngest kids in class are usually born in August.  But a few kids, with a young birthdate, and possibly not enriched academically at home, and maybe premature, and male, seem to be most likely to end up needing special education services. Some conditions are predisposed more towards males, like autism and ADHD. In my 19 yrs experience, these have been my observations.  Some potential school difficulties could be helped by holding these kids back a year before they even start kindergarten, to get another yr to socialize, and develop."
AskDocs,fcq4p8e,t1_fcpc20r,1577878648.0," NAD but an elementary school psychologist.  I think it depends on the length of gestation.  I work with students age 5 and up and most of the premies born  6+ weeks premature are lagging in some areas.  Consider redshirting kids born around the cutoff date for school, the extra year helps with development and school readiness."
