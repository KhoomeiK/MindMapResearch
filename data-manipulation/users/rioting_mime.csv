television,fek5u5d,t1_fej4b13,1579193230.0,"I think she has some level of self-awareness. Actually I think she does shit like this on purpose because 

1: She wants to and is legitimately a petty, mean person

 2: She knows she won't actually suffer any repercussions, meaning her shitty behavior just gets her in the news for a few days."
EatCheapAndHealthy,fek5iko,t1_feif4as,1579193042.0,"I am also curious about this. I add frozen veggies to stir-fry all the time but it's very tough to get them crisp.

Edit: did some quick googling and it looks like one suggestion is to throw them in a colander before cooking and run cold water to thaw them out."
giantbomb,fejxrb6,t3_eoxwsx,1579188265.0,Wow it's a good thing your character doesn't blink a single other time during the loop or getting to the Quantum Moon would be really annoying!
Games,fehh6eq,t1_fehdfd6,1579116450.0,"Yeah I ended up looking it up after the fact and saw that. It sort of goes counter to what the game taught you up to that point though, which is that if a leviathan does aggro on it's too late to be quiet and you should run tf away.

Also, nice username :) Check yourself, at the door!"
Games,fegnmr4,t1_feg8yi9,1579098117.0,"The pacing of the game was seriously out of whack. I enjoyed exploring the world, chatting with people, taking side-quests. But then you'd get to a dungeon and be slammed with unsatisfying (imo at least) puzzles for hours on end."
Games,fegn9kg,t1_fegcv4b,1579097844.0,"I liked it a lot, played for probably 20 hours or so.

What made me stop playing was, after I spent the time grinding materials to build the great big sub, getting murked by a leviathian literally like 5 minutes after I got in the thing. I didn't understand how to get away once it was aggro'd on me and it chased me what felt like halfway across the map to blow me up.

Didn't feel good to lose all that progress. Even survival games need ways to mitigate stuff like that imo."
Games,fednh4m,t1_fedm7c0,1579015787.0,Tbh any ability to predict characters went out the window when they put fucking Duck Hunt Dog in the game.

Games,fe08931,t1_fdzymus,1578805736.0,"Nope. I bought one for the portability and ease of use, plus the price is right. The slightly lower specs don't bother me and I can hook it to my computer if I want."

giantbomb,fdsghyg,t1_fdqis6v,1578702268.0,"Playing Judgement now. It's a great time but it's not much of a detective game outside of the story (which is really good). The actual gameplay is still quite Yakuza, with some great QoL changes."

truegaming,fdc7805,t1_fd5hxga,1578268461.0,"I mean, yeah maybe. Imo if you aren't capable of at least matching the quality of a series you should just do something new instead. That way there isn't as much baggage associated with the name."
truegaming,fd58e1u,t1_fd55vlo,1578175158.0,You're describing Mass Effect: Andromeda though...
OkCupid,fcuzxcj,t1_fct9rvf,1577991835.0,Lol I'm really curious what your logic is behind that.
Games,fcugyop,t1_fcugao3,1577980715.0,"In my opinion the issues are more with the writing than directing. There's no reason a movie based on a game HAS to have trash writing, but it seems like studios don't bother getting decent writers because ""it's based on a video game, why should the plot matter?""

And then the director gets there and tries to mold a terrible script into something watchable, can't do it, bails before they are forever associated with a trash-fire."
truegaming,fcugo00,t1_fcruzo7,1577980513.0,">Do a indirect sequel and/or reboot in 2022/23.

There's your problem. At some point they kind of have to make a NEW game, and the current team at Bioware has really been showing their incompetence in recent years. I doubt they're capable of the quality of the OT."

giantbomb,fcl74qq,t3_ehmipa,1577741250.0,"Tbh as I've gotten older I've started to care less about finishing games. Like, I didn't finish Control. But I got all the abilities, I did the combat, I saw what the story was going for, I feel like I got a full picture of what that game was. So what does it really matter that I didn't see the ending? 

The only thing that really impacts is a person's ability to speak on the quality of the overall story, but I think you can pretty easily speak to the overall experience with the game without finishing the story (and with most games having optional content these days, you can even finish the story and still miss chunks of meaningful content).

Life is too short to stick with a game you aren't feeling anymore."

Games,fc7uied,t1_fc7jaax,1577518979.0,"I enjoyed Infamous 2 but I can't help but feel disappointed with it too. The main character's ability to drain powers could've led in some really interesting directions, especially with some DLC."
