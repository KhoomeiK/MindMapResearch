dogs,ffee8s8,t1_ffc4vh6,1579844752.0,"Yup, you don’t know what you’re talking about at all. Science completely disagrees with you."
dogs,ffee1fn,t1_ffbseln,1579844552.0,"Just a year, though? The science is saying to wait until the dog is fully mature, which is usually around 18 months. That’s very young."
movies,ffe70x4,t3_epu0qu,1579838402.0,"I don’t get how people are mad that a child didn’t want to sacrifice her own life to stop the rain. Seriously, would you volunteer to be a human sacrifice for the weather gods? We can feed you to the rain fish. Real fun stuff. 

It makes no sense to me. Sure, you don’t think her life matters much, but to her, that life is everything. Why is it so wrong to want to live?"
dogs,ffdtgh5,t1_ffdqaxo,1579828504.0,"Huh? Creepy? How is leaving a shirt that smells like you with your dog while they’re in an unfamiliar place creepy?  I think even if you don’t like it, creepy seems like the wrong word to use in this situation."
dogs,ffd3ank,t3_esy7dw,1579812580.0,"What the FUCK? I’ve never heard or seen a club use such terrible methods on their dogs to this extent. I don’t want to believe this is real. So terrible. I use all R+ at my club, and I train with balanced trainers, but they would never, ever go this far with their dogs. Holy shit. Don’t even know what to say right now, expect run. Run far away from these people."
dogs,ffcuzho,t1_ffct0xw,1579807805.0,"I wasn’t going to click on this thread because I thought I’d just leave frustrated, but it is so nice to see a comment like yours! I couldn’t agree more! 

I was passionate about GSDs. I wanted a dog I could do IPO/bitework with, and that would be willing to work with me, and that is the dog I got. He fits so wonderfully in my life, and I’m super thankful that I got him. I’ve raised labs for a service dog organization since then, and that made me even happier that I went with the breed I wanted for my first dog. I would have been so resentful and unhappy if I had gotten lab/golden, which is what people were telling me to do. I adore those dogs, but I didn’t want to keep any of them. 

I really don’t think gatekeeping dissuades people, either. If you frame dog ownership as something that is only for the “elite/exceptional” population, you’ll get people that get the dog anyway out of spite. I really think gatekeeping hurts people and dogs in the long run. We should we focusing more on educating people as much as possible instead."
dogs,ffabbcb,t3_esicks,1579731548.0,"I think you said you wanted a cockapoo? Well, those aren’t generally recommended by this sub because mixed breeds are unpredictable in fur, temperament, health, build but more importantly no reputable breeder is breeding these mixes. You don’t want to support unethical breeding. The only ethical place to get a poodle mix would be the shelter, but it looks like you’d rather go through a reputable breeder, so never mind that. 

I think either a cocker spaniel or a poodle would be a good fit, though. I really like both. They’re some lovely dogs.  An english setter might work, too. French bulldogs are great!"
dogs,ffa90kb,t1_ff9nibx,1579730231.0,I see a lot of trump supporters over on those subreddits (like r/dogfree and r/banpitbulls). Because they tend to attract uneducated people.
Pets,ff6vk74,t1_ff585sy,1579635766.0,"I promise that you don’t know as much about this topic as you think you do, and calling me an idiot shows your immature and lack of life experience. You clearly have some growing up to do. 

I’m not sure what your point is. All dogs are going to have medical issues, but reputable breeders are actively health testing their dogs, so they are spending hundreds, if not thousands, to prove they are giving you the healthiest dog possible. My experience comes from being around several, well-bred working line GSDs, and I’ve met several awesome breeders. It’s not from r/pets, which upvotes terrible advice, and is really not super knowledgeable about dogs. 

My current well-bred dog has lived through three of our families shelter mutts. I really think you need to research reputable breeders because your lack of knowledge is showing. I recommend to start [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/a0m3r4/discussionlink_reputable_breeder_guide/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"

dogs,ff573vn,t1_ff56xkq,1579582139.0,"Yup, very important life skills! 

And I love the fun stuff. I’m big on trick training silly things, and I love parkour. I recently taught my 80 pound dog a rebound, which was truly a mistake. What parkour tricks do you do with yours? It might give me some ideas!"
Pets,ff56ugq,t1_ff46i6l,1579581916.0,"A responsible breeder is showing/working their dogs. If you are buying from a breeder that isn’t doing these things, you are supporting bad breeding."
Pets,ff56qvd,t1_ff3hni0,1579581832.0,"Yeah, that’s BS. You went to a BYB/Puppy mill.

Reputable breeders actively show/work their dogs. My own breeder has IPO3 titles on all of her dogs, and if they were unsocialized/neurotic messes, that would never have happened. 

Please go to r/dogs and learn what a reputable breeder is like, and don’t support BYBs in the future."
dogs,ff561pz,t1_ff3ztqq,1579581245.0,"I wouldn’t recommend their plan, though. It’s the absolute worst. I regretted ever getting on it, tbh. It might be different in other areas, though."

dogs,ff2cbt6,t1_ff29vmz,1579500507.0,.....Did you just say that your dog can kill people on command
dogs,ff2b0jc,t3_er8tf3,1579499203.0,"It isn’t the same training schedule for everyone. It really depends on your priorities. Some people focus super heavily on leash walking. Some people teach a lot of tricks. Others focus more on bond building. If you ask me, I’m big on recall/off-leash skills since off-leash hikes are a big deal for me, and something I want my dog to be excellent at in the future. 

I’d think the basics are a good place to start. Going to the bathroom outside, bite inhibition, sit, down, stay, etc, but there isn’t really a specific time you NEED to have all these down by. Some dogs learn faster than others, go at your own pace! And enjoy!"
dogs,ff13y3p,t3_er20td,1579474981.0,"Damn. I’m surprised reading these comments. I barely ever have to cut my dogs feet nails, I think I’ve only cut them once or twice. His paws I cut probably once every three or four months. They seem to barely ever grow."
dogs,feznwak,t1_fezh4af,1579459479.0,"Oh, I really didn’t think of that! I’m actually going to need to go to a behaviorist instead because we’re going to need anxiety medication for the vet. I didn’t think my problem was “major” enough for a behaviorist, so I was worried about going, but that’s probably ridiculous. I’ll look into a board certified behaviorist around me instead. 

And yes, I wish I had gone to a fear-free clinic this whole time! My vet is great, but she’s the kind of person that’s like, let’s just get this over with, even if the dog doesn’t like it. They tried to restrain my dog for thirty minutes to give him a shot, which made him a 100x more anxious about being at the vet. Stuff like that has done for much more damage for him in the long term. Even if it did mean we didn’t have to come back multiple times."
dogs,fezgiby,t1_fevsx5i,1579457108.0,"Thank you for the answer! I’ll keep that in mind. It’s really easy for these type of dogs to verge into anxious/obsessive behavior like that. The first one is definitely true. I think he settles pretty well, but he does check in to see if I’ll throw his ball a lot. I should have ignored it, but usually I’ll throw it for him once, which just encourages his obsessive behavior. 

I do have a iaabc trainer that specializes in anxious/reactive dogs that I’m training with next month because mine is doing terrible at the vet office. He is very anxious there, and won’t take even take treats anymore. I’m sure to ask him if my dog is verging into anxious territory. Thank you for the answer :’)"
dogs,fev37oj,t1_fetr3qp,1579392626.0,"Thanks for the response! I’ll definitely ask about that. If you don’t mind me asking, what behavior was she exhibiting that made you realize she can never turn off?"
