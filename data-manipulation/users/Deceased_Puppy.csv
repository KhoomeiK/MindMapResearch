gifs,ffelskn,t1_ffel0bf,1579853516.0,"Brazilian jiu jitsu. Two different gyms. But we often had wrestling style mats to train on as throws, slams and falls all necessitate a floor that doesn’t bounce. We’d break more bones if we threw each other into spring floors, especially new people who don’t know how to fall.

Maybe not wrestling mat, but those look kinda like the “puzzle mats” or tatami’s also used in grappling arts for falls. I feel like in a TKD gym a non-springy floor would still be necessary for live sparring.

I love me some spring floors for tricking, gymnastics and parkour. Never did TKD though. Air tracks and the tumble tracks that were extra springy or essentially long trampolines scare the shit out of me. I always did gymnastics as a hobby, and I’m still just there using it as an adult social club. I rely too much on just brute forcing my skills versus clean technique. So the extra power is amazing for those people who have control. Instead I already throw skills all at max power amd it works for me.

In grappling/mma I have a lot more control, I don’t just smash my partner in case you wonder."

Personally once I’m close enough to a skull that I can throw it and not land on my neck (doesn’t have to be my feet, just not on my neck) then I’m comfortable doing it on just the spring floor.

news,fef3okr,t1_fednj76,1579047429.0,"Apple products look like they come from a totalitarian, dystopian future, but it’s nice to see them willing to attempt to stand their ground on this. As you mention, the government can be a bully and with enough people willing to corrupt the system for their own gain, you don’t know how impenetrable the stance is. However, I do believe they sincinerely understand the consequence of such an action.

For all we know the government has already hacked it and they can already break the encryption, they just want Apple to open the gate so they can be public about it. I sorta just assume any device I use to connect to a network (cellular, WiFi, GPS, even Bluetooth) can be and is already collecting and sending data on where I am and what I use the device for. When I meet people who won’t use Alexa/Google hone type devices because the listen to you, I remind them they have a phone in their pocket. If you actually use it as a phone I assume you haven’t physically disconnected the microphone. We already know many apps listen to you to send ads. Also google and other map/GPS apps track your location even when not using the app, that’s how they find new routes and know traffic patterns. Even disabling the GPS, just pinging without connecting to WiFi networks can allow them to sorta still get data on where you go. It’s probably harder to track someone by checking which networks they ping as they drive down a street, but it’s doable. The same people who fear Alexa also cover their webcams with stickers but don’t open up and unplug the microphones in their laptop. I get that leaving antennas and microphones connected to the rest of the hardware is necessary for any actual utilization of the device but it seems irrational to allow so many other privacy/security flaws in ones life but Alexa and webcams are somehow the most dangerous enemies.

I’m not super into conspiracy theories, but the technology is already there. Maybe it isn’t being used nefariously but considering some of the ways it s already utilized to make life convenient, it doesn’t seem like a stretch to assume the data collected by apps that track your GPS and use your microphone to send targeted ads can’t also be used outside of the private sectors."

Main exposure to Japanese culture is through combat sports (mma and kickboxing), it seems like they really like white people, but clearly have signed some black fighters just because of how they look. Sometimes it feels like the subtle racism also applies to some of the ‘merican fighters too.

I’ve also heard that due to the historic relationship between China and Japan that a Chinese American like myself isn’t always welcomed.

Of the top of my head Franklin/Liddell. Franklin still throwing punches with the broken arm. He knew his arm was destroyed and his back was against the wall. Do or die for violent Jim Carey. Do or die and he defied to go out on his shield.

Tangent, but another warrior, by the name of Jacare got his arm snapped in a bjj tournament, but was up on points. The monster just tucked his arm into his belt and proceeded to run the the clock out."

At this point I’d love to get it back but I’d almost rather start over build a great new box and send her a picture of the new one. If she’s a good person she’ll send me my old box or drop it off where I told her my parents own a store so that I can combine the two boxes.

Insect pinning is super fun if you’re into thing being very “neat” and symmetrical. When you catch a bug, it loses a leg and you’d rather throw it out or give it to another classmate than use it you know you’re actually enjoying the project. I ended up giving away handfuls of nearly perfect insects that were still beautifully pinned. Then any complete insects that I pinned I would trade for fresh dead but not yet pinned bugs.

My classmates weren’t always good at pinning so I rarely traded for something already pinned."

Ever since my zooology Professor never gave my collection back because she wanted to “keep it for one more year to use as the example for next year’s class.”  Since she only teaches the course in fall due to no insects in winter.

Well that was 2012-2013, and she no longer replies to my emails... lady I put so much work into that project. There’s no way she’s more proud of my display box than I am and I almost didn’t take the project seriously until I realized how much better my collection was going to be than anyone else’s in class."

holdmyredbull,fdf6bza,t1_fdevtg9,1578354316.0,"Oh we absolutely have competitive kickboxing. Amateur circuits tend to be regional, but any serious MMA gym should have some pros in-house. Pro circuits still end up being regional, just like mma. Small promotions on Indian reservation casinos. But I think Glory has done a few shows stateside.

Most of the people I trained with weren’t there for exercise, but they also weren’t the guys hoping to go pro. I’d say they were more hobbyists, they took sparring quite seriously, but most didn’t compete unless it was an amateur inter-intragym tournament. Most of the ones that actually had decent amateur records had goals of being pro in either mma or kickboxing."

Honestly though most gyms let you learn at your pace. If you’re not ready to spar they won’t push you to spar. If they do and you honestly don’t feel comfortable being in the ring sparring you should find a new gym. But if you wanna get in there and spar and they trust you won’t be a danger to yourself, they usually start you with someone much better than you.

The reason being you’re less likely to hurt them on accident. New people tend to not be able to dial down the power for friendly sparring. Also the more experienced fighters have more control. They might “hurt” you but without actually doing real damage. They’re usually also better at controlling emotions."

videos,fdeeaoh,t3_ekus0z,1578337145.0,"This is not a safe. In the firearms community, among people who take firearm ownership seriously both as a responsibility and a super fun hobby, we call these residential security containers (RSC).

Even the 50 rifle large looking box that could fit fit a could fit a body or two we call residential security containers. The advent of portable power tools really changed the game. That’s not even the easiest exploit here.

That little box as mentioned is only meant to keep children and honest people from getting what is inside. A thief would just pick it up and walk out the door. Don’t even fantasize your security camera will actually catch them, nor your alarm. Time yourself from your front door or back door to the time it takes to walk to your bedroom, open all your drawers and closest, spot a box, then mad dash out the door again.

Oh you have a cable lock holding it to the dresser? They’ll just smash the dresser, or even easier a pair of tin snips in their pocket and that cable lock is defeated.

A bigger RSC, isn’t much better if t can be knocked over so the thief can use gravity for leverage to pry on it.  Ow if the rest of the house isn’t secure and the thief can take their time 15-30 minutes, uninterrupted with down power tools, good luck... This isn’t to say they’re completely useless, but real security begins with the person who has something to secure. Don’t advertise you have something worth stealing to strangers and your neighbors. Also how is your house setup? Does it look easier to target than the house next to it?

I’m tired of writing but those are just the basics. Before you think, someone would report power tool usage... would they really? How often have you heard construction that you couldn’t see, and then gone to investigate or report it? Don’t you just assume it’s a repairman or a hired job?"
