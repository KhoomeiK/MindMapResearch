I believe you have mistaken me for someone else... by the way, racist and sexist ideas are not only present in the real world, they currently lead part of US politics. If someone were to grow up in a racist family that believes in white supremacy do you honestly think they would be able to casually talk about human equality over dinner? No.. instead they find an outlet (social media, video games, etc.) that allows them to voice their opinions without concern, or just relieve stress! There are plenty of platforms that support this kind of thinking. Go look further than the toxic FPS communities (which aren’t even that bad). Great job jumping to conclusions. 

(Response to this one):

So apparently you looked at what I said and didn’t actually read anything. As good as it might be for people to experience the real world, you must admit that it can be harsh. Not everyone is able to handle large amounts of stress, so they find a way to feel comfortable. I don’t understand why you believe that people will always feel worse about themselves after doing something they love for a long period of time. And yes, you did (in a way) say that video games are ruining our society. The people who inhabit the “real world” are also the people who make up the “fantasy world.” By saying that video games cause social ineptitude and pain for those that play them, you are also saying that they keep people from effectively participating in our society."

facepalm,fd0u5fl,t1_fd0rw8e,1578123796.0,Okay never mind I hope this is a troll account.
facepalm,fd0pjy3,t1_fd06ydo,1578122035.0,"Congrats.. you’ve successfully reworded the claim that “video games are ruining our society.” I don’t know why this is considered a valid response to any argument, but since you have chosen to use this claim I am going to assume that you are easily offended. There are good and bad sides to the gaming community, just as there is for the global community. You’ve apparently only experienced the more toxic side. And saying that the gaming community is more toxic than the global community makes no sense whatsoever.. are you saying that you can’t participate in both? The toxicity that makes up part of the gaming community doesn’t just appear as a result of playing video games.. it’s just that this “fantasy world” is a great outlet for all of the stress that is caused by real world problems. Maybe if people were able to share their views without fear of being ridiculed in the real world they would do it more often. Regardless of your beliefs, please try to respect the views of others, no matter how much you disagree with them, or how poorly worded they are lol. 

P.S. Everyone’s experiences are different, so  when you tell someone to just get out there and see the world you are actually just telling them to find things that back up your viewpoint. Thank you for coming to my ted talk."
