that type of thinking affects real people in real life in very negative ways. it might be time to give up your trolling and start advocating for sanity. and for the love of anything you stand for. look up ego and what it is. just be aware of it. that’s all i ask. you don’t have to change or do anything other than look into it for 20 mins or so. just get acquainted with the concept. pleeeeease. you can tell me to go to hell. but as long as you secretly do some reading about it, i’ll take all your scorn and jabs you want to throw at me."

but in all seriousness trump supporters have been baffling as in an existential crisis kind of baffling. trump supporters are CLEARLY less educated and can essentially only say “no you” in response to any argument. 

“the left can’t meme” is straight out of the fact that right sucks so much as memeing, we had to make a subreddit so as not to shit post in unrelated subs... in response to that. trumpers say the left can’t meme. this is just one example of how fucking dumb people who support trump are. but once they see their own reflection and comprehend the logical steps one needs to take in order to grasp existence, it’ll change pretty quick. 


just lose the ego trump supporters. it does you only harm. stop getting so defensive. disingenuous conversations lead no where."

we are treating the word probably as it should be treated. unless something happens to change his mind, he will vote for bernie. essentially an unofficial endorsement. 

analyze the semantics all you want. you ain’t joe and to say any thing more in the subject is kind of pointless. joe clearly states his vote is going to bernie. 

when you say probably it might mean something different. hell, it might mean something different for joe. but all we have is a generally accepted definition of what probably means; YES."

todayilearned,ffgyvkb,t1_ffgttzv,1579918609.0,"it’s not absurd to consider which dams have ruined wildlife habitats and to remove them. what’s absurd is you seem to think it’s all or nothing and that removals are only useful because they don’t work or damaged. 

do some dam removal google searching and learn about wild life rehabilitation. it’s super interesting and puts dams in a whole new perspective. 

dams that are in salmon spawning areas are especially crucial to remove. most of those dams were built with zero accountability to government codes to preserve wildlife. some locals around the dams would literally carry fish around the damn because of how important it is for salmon to spawn. that’s where salmon ladders come from. a lot of dams never got ladders installed because no one was checking on these corporations and building codes. a plus side of government regulations making sure capitalism greed doesn’t ruin the planet."

PoliticalHumor,ffgu48b,t1_ffgk241,1579915107.0,well the rats and the ship have an interesting relationship. it seems the ship has either given the rats some fucking bomb ass cheese or the ship has some dirt on the rats and the rats are scared to get that dirt wet cause it’ll become mud and they don’t do well in mud. so best stay with the ship cause it’s certain death to leave now. while it’s only maybe death if they stay in the dirt with the ship that might not sink. hopefully it will though.
todayilearned,ffgt83o,t1_ffgoy1b,1579914456.0,"also nuclear power is the only power in which all carbon or negative impacts from the plants can be calculated. unlike wind and solar, nuclear can provide accurate info on all impacts to wildlife and nature. not that it’s that much, but i find it interesting that no other renewable resource can provide such data.
