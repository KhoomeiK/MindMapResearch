AskReddit,ffzi7ho,t1_ffzhuhl,1580380422.0,"That can happen when a doctor is involved. A banker does not just say, *you know, person who walked into my branch off the street I've never met, I'm making this end-all-be-all determination about your mental state and deny you this loan.*

That's absolutely not in a banker's power to do. A coordination between underwriting and medical professionals would allowed for that but otherwise, just no.

And on the risk of a customer suing, how is a large settlement with the customer and/or regulatory fines for fair lending violations *negligible* compared to a $100k mortgage that goes partially unpaid? Your math is wrong."

Just because YOU would run a bank in a discriminatory fashion doesn't mean that that's just how it works.

I have given mortgages to people in their 80s and 90s. It happens whether you like or not or know it or not. We don't all live in this conservative fantasyland where banks just deny or approve loans based on whatever the fuck the banker is feeling that day."
