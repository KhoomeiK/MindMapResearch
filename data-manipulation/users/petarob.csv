AmItheAsshole,ffhm837,t3_etaue7,1579941976.0,"NTA. I think you’ve just described my son. Leave. Protect your girls. He’s an adult, there’s not much you can do for him now, if he takes his pills, well and good but if he doesn’t you can’t force him anyway. He is who he is, nothing you can do now for him. I know it’s a difficult decision, but you have your girls as priority. Go be happy for a while, enjoy the change"

Maybe another family member. But you won’t get anywhere by approaching him yourself, that’s too much"
Parenting,ff4nv2n,t1_ff2r0vv,1579568163.0,"Yes, I get that. My family situation turned me into someone who reacted differently to what “I” would have. My only way out was through. 

And what helped me get through is knowing that when they were 18 they would go off to college. And THEN I could go back to being me. That helped me enormously, knowing it wasn’t literally forever. 

I had to accept that I sacrificed a lot to raise kids. I love my kids for sure. But I had to eat the opportunity cost of not being able to do other things such as have a career. I had to make peace with that choice that I had made. 

Then two of my kids moved out (One to college, one to my ex-s gone), and I had more mental space to grow and think. I had already gone back to school via a Bootcamp to increase my skills which led to my current full time job that I am over the moon about. 

I just met up with a friend who I have known for over 25 years, where we met in a graduate program. She didn’t have kids and looked after her career and just negotiated a very high six-figure (or 7) salary as a VP. She can afford to retire in 3 years. I am so envious she got to be able to do that! I’m on a mid 5-figure salary that doesn’t even get me over the line each month. It’s heartbreaking, it’s my choice, and is now my reason to grab opportunities for upward development. And closer and closer to my ambitious self where I contribute to the world. Good luck in your journey!"
Parenting,ff2ojjn,t3_er9uh4,1579516475.0,"I laughed and laughed at your post! I think it’s the absolute desperation you feel when teenagers push you to the edge, and you’re teetering there, hoping you won’t fall, and instead end up crying in bed at 8pm. Hilarious!

I too have no advice for you. Although I am with you, my three teenagers have single handed my wrecked my life. Wrecked any career I could have had. Introduced me to a world of pain and sorrow, so I know the feeling of crying between the sheets, wondering who these crazy strangers are. Unfortunately my husband wasn’t nearly as helpful as yours. Best of luck to you,"
AmItheAsshole,ff2msd4,t1_ff2guwa,1579513761.0,"That is horrendous. You’re probably not looking for relationship advice, but let me say this. I was in a similar situation. I had to start thinking of me if ever I were to work again. Best decision ever. Please don’t let him be so controlling of your time."
Parenting,ff2m8h5,t3_er8jvl,1579512896.0,"Sure, your wife is right, exposure your new things is important for kids. But over their life’s time, not all in one week! Pick ONE activity for each kid, MAX, each TERM, and over 12 years they will get lots of exposure to new things. Slow down, enjoy the kids, and let them enjoy life."
AmItheAsshole,ff08ysh,t3_eqvx55,1579466473.0,"NTA. You are too trusting for your own good. James is a total jerk who doesn’t care for his guests - dirty kitchen, filthy living room, disgusting living quarters. Stand up for yourself.

Either 1.gave a heart to heart about why things are failing, or 2. Hire a private detective to actually get evidence. 

Best of luck!"

AmItheAsshole,fcmg8dn,t3_ehpxix,1577774095.0,"Tell your wife that the delay she’s maki g in calling an ambulance, waiting to to the ER etc are all critical that could eventually harm your daughter who Needs Cooling Down Immediately!!! It’s not the money, it’s the time wasted that is important. At least step her through alternatives, like running a cool bath for your daughter, but you have to get her to figure out her own system that is immediate response."

TrueOffMyChest,fc86nud,t1_fc84p3y,1577528059.0,"Sure, I get it. I understand your personality and your viewpoint. And condescension is the worst! And I know people who are extroverts can have similar mental issues to those my daughter had. Thanks for your concern. I guess my point is that sometimes it is hard to get through the barrier that shy people put up, and as a parent I needed to and failed. I feel very badly for what happened to her, and encourage people to talk, it saves lives literally."
TrueOffMyChest,fc8403b,t3_egnhmh,1577526364.0,"My daughter was born an introvert. She never really spoke up or got mad at people or made a fuss. She was quiet. So when she was sad, she never told anyone. When she starting cutting in middle school, she never shared that with anyone. When she was suicidal, being the introvert, she never reached out for help. And when she was assaulted? You guessed it, she told no-one. Never reached out for help. Her mind is so fucked up right now, and she cannot find her way forward because she let shyness stop her from talking. 

So yes, there might be a reason someone is concerned about you because they haven’t heard from you."
