Oh sweet summer child, the teachers unions aren't the reason we see sub-par teachers, it's perhaps  the 35k to 40k USD per year starting salary for a job that requires a bachelor's degree only to have to babysit shitty kids because they have shitty parents. 

Cheap labor isn't skilled, skilled labor isn't cheap.

If the average pay across the US for K-12 teachers jumped by $20,000 per year (what the position deserves and more), do you think we'd see many shitty, don't give a fuck teachers? The job would become competitive. Money is why we work. Sometimes passion for what we do, but we gotta eat. School districts could not only begin attract better talent, they'd be able to be more picky about who they hire."

And this also applies to skilled labor who are paid what may seem like a higher wage but everyone is underpaid for 2020. All working class folks are underpaid. It doesn't matter if you are making 35k or 110k per year.

Our Journeyman wage in Phoenix just hit $30 per hour.  We deserve more for what we do and the training required.  So it's not just minimum wage folks.   It's hard to go through a 4 year apprenticeship and then bust your ass everyday in 2020 for 2003's wages."

Electrical trade is so freaking vast. No one can know everything and they are always adding and creating new stuff for us to use/do. Why I love it.  But also think about this--for almost every trade, there is a residential/service side of the trade and there is the commercial then the industrial job sites.  I've only worked big ass industrial jobs as an electrician.  Our union, the IBEW, really doesn't even train us in residential. We compete in the commercial and industrial sectors.  So interestingly enough, after years, I've never installed a basic 20a receptacle or wall switch.  I've built a lot of support racks out of stainless steel strut for boxes and conduit. I've bent a lot of Rob-Roy conduit (pvc coated rigid conduit). I've put up a lot of cable tray.  I've been down in a lot of trenches putting in underground pvc conduit.  Pulled a fuck ton of big ass wire.  Haven't done a lot of terminations.  I'm actually looking at going to a commercial job soon to finally get some branch circuitry and lighting experience."
