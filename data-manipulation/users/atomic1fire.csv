news,ffybscs,t3_evpyxk,1580342678.0,"I don't see why fake meat has to be a debate.

If you want vegan/vegetarian substitutes then they have to have market demand.

Ignoring all the debates about cow farts and co2, what it really comes down to is taste. If fake meat tastes good then there's gonna be a demand for it. If they can make it healthier then the actual thing then there will probably be a demand for it. If neither of those things are possible then they'll probably pull the product off the menu.

The existence of vegan anything doesn't detract from meat in fast food restaurants, it's just another option as fast food restaurants try to expand their audiences.

A vegetarian who absolutely wants to eat at a fast food restaurant will probably just buy a bunch of side dishes and call it a meal.

edit: Personally I'm waiting for someone to release a food menu item that includes both fake and real meat, just to offend everyone at once. Blasphemy Burger when?"

worldnews,ffxyudr,t1_ffxcqnm,1580335116.0,"I think Trump will probably win re-election IMO, but I also think that in 2024, he'll have to step down and either Pence, Cruz, or someone else will campaign instead.

The biggest problem with the Trump = Putin theory is that the US constitution actually forbids more then two terms, not more then two consecutive terms.

Putin was essentially able to take another role in office as prime minister, then come back a few years later to retake the reigns.

Plus while I am pretty sure you can appoint a former president to your cabinet, Trump couldn't parlay that back into a presidency unless he got the constitution amended, which requires an almost universal agreement (more of an opinion of mine really, but I doubt you could get a majority of the states to allow it) to amend the constitution as a matter of practicality.

Plus I don't think Trump would do great in a cabinet position post-presidency. As the head of the executive branch he sets policy, but I'm not sure he would work nearly as well under someone else's leadership. Regardless of my political views on him, he doesn't seem like the type to stand back and let someone else take the lead. For lack of a better word Trump is too in your face to be a palpatine."

Apperently the LAPD grounded their chopper fleet because of the thick fog, so it's possible that the pilot either ignored the weather, or was specifically asked to fly anyway. edit: or perhaps they were just unaware of the weather until it was too late. I'd rather not blame the pilot for a mistake that anyone could make.

I can't understand being an NBA player, I have no interest in sports, but I do understand what it's like to find out that a family member died and to have questions about why it happened, and wait weeks for answers. Plus all the drama that comes with their loss.

I assume that for the people on that helicopter, some if not all of their family and friends will change. Maybe they'll grow closer, maybe they're gonna be more distant, but it's going to be scary, uncertain and for some people extremely upsetting, but it will probably happen.

I don't think Microsoft Edge should be based on Gecko, even if MS/Mozilla/Free Software advocates want it to. (That is assuming they do, which I'm not sure if it's even an argument at this point)

There's a reason Apple didn't start with Firefox when they made safari. And there's a reason Google Chrome wasn't a firefox fork either. And why all the major linux browsers that aren't firefox or Chrome all use webkit.

That reason being that as much as Mozilla wants an open web, they've got a not so great track record on having a platform easy to develop for third parties. edit: Although they did make rust.

If they had made servo something like Webkit and had a standalone API (with no legacy cruft) for it, we might see some browsers come out of it.

But a lot of the cruft holding Firefox together like XPCOM is part of the reason that Apple used KHTML instead. The things that made it a great browser made it really bad for starting anything from scratch. Hence why I assume Mozilla chose to rebuild key parts in rust with the servo project.

As for ""Why not just do it with Webkit"". Everything targets Chrome anyway, Blink is a web-kit fork, and Microsoft's efforts are much better spent improving chromium's performance upstream. Especially when Apple sort of gave up porting safari to windows outside of Itunes, and only really cares about IOS/Mac products.

As for ""Why chromium"" Google might be evil, but they have been developing chromium in an extremely modular way for a long time. Key chunks of the browser are all modular, and projects like CEF and electron exist because of that. Point being, Microsoft gets website support, and a platform that they can rebuild however they want whenever they want because key parts are isolated."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL6hp8BKB24

Sometimes CGI can exist in a scene and you don't even realize it's there, because that's the point.

I feel like a big reason for CGI is just to create scenes that would be impossible, or extremely expensive with practical effects.

""That scene don't feel real"", of course not, because it's impossible to film that way.

Practical Effects might as well be called illusions, because they're designed to trick you into seeing something that isn't there. CGI is there, but it's all rendered by computers so if a movie studio is willing to put the effort/money in, it can look really good.

If someone used CGI in addition to trying to trick the viewer, it probably would look great.

Hence Jurassic Park being a dope movie.

edit: For me I guess special effects shouldn't be everything in one basket. You can mix practical effects and CGI together or even just use one or the other, as long as the writing/directing/acting sells the scene.

Powershell was basically created to do things that CMD couldn't do and supplement or improve upon the scripting support that Windows had before it.

So I would assume that Powerlauncher (assuming this isn't just a proposal that people are hyping up) would do the same thing, but for the run command instead. Like Launchy or one of the other apps they were taking examples from.

news,ffas0kr,t1_ffakpv2,1579743134.0,"From what I googled, it looks like the big difference is that service dogs can be trained for tasks that address PTSD.

For example, your (fictional) buddy dave starts freaking out at the sound of a firecracker, the dog might pull him away from people so that he can calm down. Or just walk the human home.

Perhaps the dog can detect the signs of a panic attack, and instantly provide comfort when Dave is having an episode. Such as licking the face or hands, or trying to get the human to do something else like play.

Or maybe Dave has some kind of mental or physical impairments as well, so the dog takes on more routine tasks like getting medicine, or performing tasks that Dave struggles with.
