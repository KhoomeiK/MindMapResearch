No one even mentioned black people. No one was angry. It's pretty clear that you saw two black guys in a gif, and you projected your own insecurities onto other people's comments... If this is how you regularly interact with people, I'd seek therapy soon. You're a shining example of the old quote, ""if you run into an asshole in the morning, they were just an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole"" just replace the word ""asshole"" with the word ""racist"", and you've pretty much described yourself.


Furthermore, it's pretty racist of YOU to assume that only black kids don't have dads... Believe it or not, any kid can come from a single parent household, regardless of race or ethnicity. 

Take a look in the mirror buddy, and a take a deep breath."

Most women cannot meet the physical demands of the job, as there is a biological difference between the strength and cardio capacity of men and women; that is biology, ***NOT*** sexism. Do you know the difference?


I literally don't know how else to break down for you, you are literally refusing to even answer an elementary school level question about biology. We're you home schooled? Is that why you don't know the difference?

You continue with the gaslighting... I am repeatedly referencing *strictly* biology, and you are calling it sexism. That is gaslighting.


I guess having women compete in their own sports in the Olympics is sexism. Not letting male mma fighters fight females is sexism. Not letting women die in a fire because they are incapable of dragging a 200lb dummy 50 yards is sexism. 


FOUR TIMES you have refused to answer the simple question: is there a biological difference in the strength and stamina between men and women? Fifth time ive had to ask you. Yes or no?"

Furthermore, you said the Bible has a part about ""not fucking your family"". I said the Bible has contradictions, and provided one. I then provided several, including ones specifically about incest. God says incest is bad, God says incest is good. My statement was absolutely correct. 



Anti incest: “And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter…it is a wicked thing….” — Leviticus 20:17


Pro incest: “And God said unto Abraham, As for Sara thy wife (Sarah is also his sister) …I bless her, and give thee a son also of her…” — Genesis 17:15-16



Absolutely nothing I said was wrong."
therewasanattempt,ffj2k29,t1_ffj20os,1579988784.0,"That's not what I did, nor what I said.

I said that there are biological differences between men and women, and women are not often able to meet the physical demands necessary for a job where you will literally die if you cannot perform. You cannot repeatedly fail at a minimum requirement, and then blame culture. Most women cannot meet the requirements, and it is due to biological differences. 

Do you disagree with basic biology? Yes or no.

BTW, I'm a firefighter/paramedic who has been in three fire academies, spent two years volunteer wildland firefighting

In my EMT class, there was one female out of roughly thirty students.

In my first volunteer fire academy there were no females.

In my paramedic school there were three females.

In my collegiate fire academy there was one female who failed out on the first day because she couldn't do a single pushup off of her knees. 


Females are under representated becuaee they choose to be. They do not choose the career path, they do not earn the prerequisites, they do not volunteer. Yet, YET, they are afforded significantly more opportunities in paid municple departments... This is the opposite of toxic culture... This is giving women a chance despite having less qualifications, and women still failing, because they cannot maintain the physical fitness needs necessary for a job with a high death rate.


Once again, do you disagree with biology, yes or no?"

Incest

[But what was god’s reaction to Abraham, who married his sister — his father’s daughter?] See Genesis 20:11-12


“And God said unto Abraham, As for Sara thy wife…I bless her, and give thee a son also of her…” — Genesis 17:15-16

The Permanence of Earth

“…ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.” — Matthew 5:39

Circumcision
“This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.” — Genesis 17:10

The phycial test exists for a reason. If you can't pass it, you will literally die. Females cannot pass the test as easily or as often as males.


Do you have a problem with that?"
therewasanattempt,ffiorfr,t1_ffioi6c,1579978973.0,"Chill? You called me a fucking bigot and lied about what I said. 


Men and women are not equal biologically, and that difference comes out on these incidents, and people literally die.


You're acting like men and women are biologically equal, and that isn't true. Furthermore, when it risks your life, your teammates life, and the people that you protect, it's very relevant.
What needs to be clarified here?!"
MakeMeSuffer,ffim514,t1_ffily04,1579977175.0,"Maybe. The Bible contradicts itself a lot, because it's written by men, and God isn't real. 


Genesis 19:32-38 King James Version (KJV)

32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father."
therewasanattempt,ffilh92,t1_ffijr80,1579976718.0,"First off, I never fucking said that ""a woman cannot pass at all pass the requirements"", so don't fucking put words in my mouth. If you have to resort to lies and arguing in bad faith, then jsut shut the fuck up and don't bother replying. 

You're repeating yourself without listening to what I'm saying. 


Another thing that you don't understand: after the academy, there are no more tests. There are no annual physical qualifications... So regardless of the training, and regardless of the the ""many fit women who put in hard physical training and can pass it"", it needs to be ***maintained***, and guess who doesn't do that? Most people. You know who doesn't give a shit about how you passed the basic requirements when you went through the academy five years ago? No one. No one gives a shit, especially if you can't even run a mile or drag your partner NOW. After the academy, most firefighters default to your natural state.... Which brings us back to basic biology: most females are not able to meet the physical demands of the crazy incidents that they ***will*** be called to.

If you think that it's as simple as ""training hard and passing the academy"", then you are showing precisely how little you know about firefighting, what the career entails, and what happens on incidents.



You don't seem to understand how firefighting works. You don't seem to understand that every single firefighter DOES go on crazy calls. 
Women often fail, significantly more often than men, and they do so on these crazy calls. I literally do not know how to make this any clearer for you.

A firefighter WILL go on a crazy incident. Whether it happens rarely or not, is irrelevant - is there something that you don't understand about that?
