If you can't handle a tiny punishment, just talk to the principal and see what they say."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,ff7anji,t1_ff7a7i8,1579644782.0,"You're still in high school, so technically even though you are 19, you will be treated like a younger teenager/ a 'child'. 

I'm currently majoring in education, so from what I've learned so far - each classroom has their own set of rules that work alongside the rules of the institution - if students fail to follow those rules, educators have the right to 'punish' the students as they deem necessary as long as it doesn't break any of the institution's rules, union rules, and state/federal rules.

My advice? Just be grateful that you didn't get sent down to the principal's office for something so minor. 

Students are at schools to learn and not get their way all the time, even in college it's like that. Sure there is more freedom but you still have to abide by the rules of the educator."
