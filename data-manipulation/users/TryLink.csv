Mmmm, yummy.  Nom nom nom."
politics,ffmdokl,t1_ffmdgp3,1580053033.0,"The DNC aren't the Russians.  They're a legitimate political organization that can support whoever they want.  Ergo, nobody cheated.  If Bernie wanted their support maybe he should have played nice."
politics,ffmb9vr,t1_ffmapbc,1580051726.0,"If Bernie had actually gotten more votes than Hillary, you'd have a point.  You don't spend your entire political career shunning the DNC, then feign outrage that they don't like you when it's convenient."
politics,ffm3dpw,t1_ffm35b4,1580047834.0,"I'm sure if Bernie would officially switch from independent to democrat, than the DNC would be more than happy to offer up additional support in a couple of years."

politics,ffm1ar7,t1_ffm13yz,1580046947.0,"The DNC isn't part of the government, they have every right to pick and choose who they throw their support behind.  Hillary was a democrat for decades.  Bernie is only a Democrat every 4 years when he needs to be on a debate stage."

Everything about this is super shady obviously, but I don't think even Trump would order a U.S. ambassador to be assassinated."

politics,fffudg2,t3_etene6,1579891994.0,"Has it been confirmed this recording came from Parnas?  If so, I think that's the bigger story here, considering Trump's denied even knowing the guy.  The whole ""take her out"" part is ambiguous at best, and the White House will just spin it to mean ""fire her,"" despite how mobster it sounds."

I was definitely leaning that way, but your endorsement has pushed me over the edge.  Thank you."
WaltDisneyWorld,ffd6yrz,t1_ffd6h9u,1579814630.0,Skyliner isn't a huge deal.  I wasn't planning on going to the parks for this one night anyway.  Just looking for a chill place to hang out by the pool and enjoy the sights & sounds.
WaltDisneyWorld,ffd3zdv,t3_erpvn2,1579812969.0,"I've recently been given the choice between staying at Port Orleans Riverside and Carribean Beach resorts for one night.  I've never stayed at either, and I can't decide.  What say you guys?"
politics,ff94ird,t3_escvtg,1579704655.0,That's how you can tell Tulsi is a Republican plant.  They're the only ones that feel the need to sue people everytime their feelings are hurt.
politics,ff93stp,t3_escq7b,1579704157.0,"Trump just tweeted this.

>They are taking the nomination away from Bernie for a second time. Rigged!

It's so fucking transparent that they're trying to stir up infighting among the Dems just like in 2016.  Do *not* fall for it again.  

Whether it's Bernie or Biden vote blue no matter what.  And don't skip voting altogether because you're butthurt your preffered candidate didn't make it.  Trump is the greater evil here, and needs to be defeated at all costs.  We can deal with the rest later."
