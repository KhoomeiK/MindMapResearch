depression,fc755xk,t1_fc6jqtf,1577497815.0,I think you can go to china and teach before you're 26. That might be fun.
depression,fc74qgo,t3_egdm43,1577497486.0,"Ugh. I hated living with my family. If I wasn't able to move out on my own when I was 18, like I did, I would have probably moved in with a sugar daddy or something more terrible. Even people with a degree can't afford to live on their own! And high school sure doesn't prepare you for anything to be able to afford to live. Even with roommates, we pay like 750 minimum and that's without utilities. I'm sorry for those struggling to live at home in shit situations and unable to run away."
