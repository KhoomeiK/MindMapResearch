How damn selfish and pig headed do you have to be to say to someone that you want to throw them a party, have them say no, and then go ahead anyway? OP shouldn’t need to provide any reason or explanation at all, because “I don’t want one” should be sufficient. Anyone who persists just has their head up their own ass and wants to feel good about what they’re doing, not actually do something nice for the other person. 

Also, your comparison to a proposal makes no sense because that involves someone changing their mind. Op didn’t change their mind once."

AmItheAsshole,ffworqy,t1_ffwiuqr,1580307287.0,"'Don't wanna' is a good enough reason, though. No is a complete sentence and doesn't require justification.

Combination of no coverage + anxiety and my mouth needed a lot of care when I finally got coverage through my work. I've had a couple of root canals, a crown, fillings, some extractions and I'm going to have an implant, too. So I know what it's like! I like reading through the posts over on dentistry and seeing that other people have the same fears and came through ok."

Mine were all done under local and the worst thing about it is the pressure involved - when I got my wisdom teeth out one went flying out of my mouth in the process, haha. 

If you're worried about dry socket, follow their aftercare instructions to the letter. They should give you gauze to bite down on when you leave as well as extras, use it. If they don't give you gauze, then use a regular moistened teabag to help the clot form. 

Don't use a straw for at least a week, don't smoke. Only eat soft foods - I'd stick to blended soups and yogurt and very soft scrambled eggs at first, that sort of thing. Do salt water rinses but just let the water move around in your mouth and then let it stream out, *don't* spit. Basically you're avoiding anything that puts suction in your mouth as that can dislodge the clot. Sleep with your head elevated."

educationalgifs,ffvo93b,t1_ffvfh2b,1580268819.0,"Not a dentist, but my understanding from my own experiences is that if you have a lot of pain then the nerve is probably involved. If that's the case then that's why they'll recommend a root canal, to basically remove any chance of further decay. But then the tooth is 'dead' which is why they recommend a root canal. 

Did she take any x-rays? If you have copies you could share them over on /r/dentistry and see if anyone there has any advice for you."

Certainly not too tough for a 9 and 11 year old with adult supervision. You're talking as though she's asking them to make a three course meal. On top of that she's 'even when', which means the majority of the dinners they're just helping, not doing it on their own."

I just find it annoying that a ton of comments aren't even *addressing* OP's actual question and why she posted here, and instead yammering on about the babysitting. The babysitting has nothing to do with the incident that happened: soda got spilled on the laptop and OP is wondering if she should believe the babysitter and/or whether she should pay. If she'd paid the babysitter would that suddenly make it okay for her to not pay for the laptop? Probably not if someone feels that she should.

AmItheAsshole,ffthvnx,t1_ffthr90,1580220969.0,I've seen multiple posts where there will be one sentence buried in the middle of a complex post and people will latch on to that to give judgement while ignoring everything else. I just think it's rude to ignore what OP is actually asking.
AmItheAsshole,ffthrbz,t1_ffthip7,1580220878.0,"But it's irrelevant to what OP is asking about. She's asking whether she's an asshole for not paying for the laptop/believing her niece. The babysitting money has nothing to do with it. It's just odd how people will latch on to something that's a tiny part of the story and give judgement on that while ignoring the actual question at hand. 

Tbh even if she *was* asking about that I wouldn't see what the big deal was - I was paid when I went over to my cousin's house to look after their kids, but when our out of town relatives came by and stayed with us I was never given money for watching the younger ones. That's just how family works."

INFO: you need to tell us how old your daughter is. I think you've left her age out deliberately here. She's old enough that you know that she feels sick if she drinks soda and reference her reading and having a phone, but you say that she couldn't have gotten up on the desk? If she's old enough to be able to do all of that and insist that she didn't leave, she's old enough that she could have knocked over the soda onto the laptop even if she wasn't drinking it."

AmItheAsshole,fftf8te,t3_euy27c,1580218841.0,NTA. Sounds like the kids need a wake up call about how much you do for them. Seems reasonable to me. I don’t get all the pearl clutching in the comments as though you’re turning them out on the street in rags.
AmItheAsshole,fftf6im,t1_ffs7bzn,1580218788.0,"Reading the actual context of the post, they’re being little brats about their chores and expect her to wait on them all the time. I think they’re old enough to learn a little lesson about how much she does for them, and it might just teach them some appreciation. I don’t get the freaking out and YTAs here."
AmItheAsshole,ffsk2fe,t1_ffs9xsx,1580183638.0,"It's totally because it's okay for them to imply that because it's about OP, but when she does the same then it becomes about their precious son, and they just can't have that. Good on OP for turning it around on them tbh."
AmItheAsshole,ffsbgy6,t1_ffs016h,1580177749.0,"To me what stands out here isn't so much the debate about the cat, but the fact that the sister basically told OP to gtfo and her parents didn't even speak up. I wouldn't want to stick around after that either and quite frankly the cat would be better company. If the sister had just said 'I'd prefer to eat without the cat' or whatever the whole incident probably wouldn't have happened."
AmItheAsshole,ffs5qta,t1_ffs5aq3,1580173812.0,"Yes, I do. (And I read your entire comment, I just completely disagree.) Because realistically speaking, the only reason the person feels the need to be 'encouraging' is because she's overweight. The implication is that she needs to be singled out from the other people there, even though there are probably plenty of out of shape skinny people out there, or thinner people who have that muffin top they want to get rid of, etc. Why wasn't she going along telling them that they were doing a good work? If you really think OP's weight had nothing to do with it then imo you're being really naive. 

Patronizing an overweight person about how omgosh it's so awesome that they're working out is not at all equivalent to 'you look nice today'. OP had every right to ask why she specifically was so deserving of a 'compliment', and maybe the woman will think the next time she wants to pat the overweight gym-goer on the head, and for good reason.

Edit to add: also, even if OP was skinny, I'd still feel that it's condescending to tell another gym-goer that in most situations. Unless you overhear them saying they're going to try and break a personal record or something like that, there's no reason to comment on them at all."
AmItheAsshole,ffs3ou4,t1_ffru6o4,1580172351.0,"I really, really feel like if this woman had some epic backstory she would have explained herself. 

Beyond that it's condescending af to single out a person to give them encouragement unless they're showing signs of frustration, etc. It's especially condescending to single out a person who is overweight. OP's not the asshole for simply asking the person what their motivation was."
AmItheAsshole,ffs25ue,t1_ffr8v13,1580171291.0,"They're treating her like a walking corpse, not someone who is precious. Like her husband is already pulling away and basically telling her 'so since you're clearly going to die, please sort out your shit'. That's not okay in the slightest."

canada,ffqxhgs,t1_ffq4uxb,1580145854.0,"The system as it is, is so overburdened. Canada in general is just not prepared for the amount of seniors we are going to have, especially seniors who are living longer and require more and more care - everything from the basic stuff like assistance if they go blind or deaf, to help around the house, to the heavier duty stuff. It's so unfortunate because often older people don't want to be a burden and the stuff they end up putting up with is unfair."

BeautyGuruChatter,ffqr360,t1_ffqik5m,1580141682.0,"Tbh I think a lot of it is driven by viewers. Obviously people here object, but what do the viewership numbers actually say? I believe that I've heard people in the booktube community say the same thing - they find that haul videos get more views than some of their other stuff.

Of course things are not the same for everyone, but really - thanks to my mother and sisters I've known more than a few people who are happy to do absolutely nothing as long as they have a means of basic survival.

AmItheAsshole,ffjd92m,t1_ffjcyhq,1579995839.0,"Because there are zero symptoms in anything she describes of depression. Sitting around playing video games is not a symptom of depression in and of itself because as I've said already - some people are really, truly, just that lazy. You seem to be completely and utterly discounting the idea that there are some people in this world who just want to sit around and not work and play games all the time - do you really think they don't exist? Because I've known a few in my lifetime. 

Beyond that, even if he is depressed, tbh he still needs to be kicked out on his ass. He's 27, not 17 - he has to figure his shit out for himself."
AmItheAsshole,ffjcfbk,t1_ffjc4er,1579995360.0,"I think this is something you guys need to do. Maybe set March or April 1st, depending on how much leeway you want to give him. In the meantime, start taking away some of those comforts he has like wifi access, etc. Stop with the sex stuff because that's just kind of weird."
AmItheAsshole,ffjc6pk,t1_ffjbhx3,1579995222.0,"From OP's comments, there is nothing wrong with him. He is content and insisting that he can't get a job in this economy, but he's not even trying. 

So. There's no indicator of depression, and no sign of any phobias or anything like that. He is lazy and what he needs is to have the safety net of Mommy and Daddy removed. I don't agree with OP's methods but I certainly agree with the idea that he needed to be out yesterday. Some people really are just lazy and prefer to lounge around doing nothing without anything being 'wrong'."
AmItheAsshole,ffjbch9,t1_ffja0jy,1579994725.0,"I'd stop buying him anything and tell him he's responsible for everything. Needs groceries? He needs to buy them himself and find a way to get there. Change the wifi password and tell him he needs to pay for his own account if he wants it. Don't do his laundry, and make sure he knows you expect him to get his own soap, etc."

Given this description: 

>he never even applied to a job. Fast forward another year and he's still home, mostly playing video games and doing nothing.

It honestly just sounds like he is lazy af and enjoys sitting around doing nothing."

AmItheAsshole,ffip0kz,t1_ffiofox,1579979147.0,"I don't think that it's semantics at all. You're trying to undermine the fact that everyone is saying NTA while ignoring the fact that that's what the vast majority of people are saying and also how long they've been together, and how many people are mentioning that they volunteered their passcodes, they weren't coerced. You were implying that 'everyone does it' when that's not true at all, and OP has the right to keep his phone to himself. He should, given how his gf reacted to it. She's insecure and needs to get over it."

AmItheAsshole,ffihits,t1_ffi6ghp,1579974011.0,"Depends on the time of day when they were flying. I've found that it can be really bright as you are up above the clouds and the sun could be coming directly in the window. Also, a lot of people who have issues with light either use programs like f.lux or a screen cover to drastically lower the amount of light coming from the screen, or filter it to a tint that they are comfortable with. 

Still doesn't mean that OP had the right to do that, just wanted to point out some possibilities."

That does not bode well for their future. Now of course the other comment is a bit knee jerk, but there are a ton of couples out there who are no longer together due to one person not being able to balance their spouse and their parent."
