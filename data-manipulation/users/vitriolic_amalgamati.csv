CryptoCurrency,fglxsop,t1_fglwlus,1580913549.0,"The point was crypto exchanges, particularly the smaller ones, don't make enough money on trades to stay afloat. The honest ones lose money and sell their business until a new owner decides to sell all user KYC data on the black market

Not to mention all the physical fiat currency people ""deposit"" to the exchange to trade for crypto just goes straight into the exchange owner's pocket. Typically, any intention of holding it in a proper honest custodial fashion is relatively short lived when they can just spend most of it on anything they want for themselves without anyone noticing, because the fiat was basically duplicated to be passed around in digital form on the exchange for who knows how long while the actual physical fiat currency can be freely spent without repercussion.. liquidity in crypto is the biggest illusion keeping this industry going

the slight of hand is in the exchange platform, people think they're trading crypto for $$ while only a fraction of them withdraw it afterwards. Usually they just keep that symbolic digital value of $$ on the exchange and wait for the right moment to use it to buy crypto again... But that fiat isn't just sitting in the exchange owner's bank account going unspent while he's wondering why no one's coming back for it. That's why it takes so long for most exchanges to allow withdrawals to go through. Most of the exchange owners have to scrounge up $$ fast from new deposits to fulfill any recent withdrawal requests and the wait can take weeks or months

if there's too many big orders at once, the trend is to just exit scam... $3.1 billion stolen from hodlers in 2019 alone

I suppose the difference is, in my experience there doesn't need to be an intelligent hand in anything at all for everything to be exactly as it currently is

The big bang I suppose is among the most mysterious points in the history of our universe, where arguably, scientifically, we know the least and it's the single most unfathomable event in the cosmos that only a few are even capable of somewhat grasping

Does there need to be a God to trigger it simply because we don't know how it happened?

Some physicists have found evidence that with enough nothingness, something happens. When the ever expanding cosmic currents of our universe will carry astronomical bodies and galaxies away from each other at speeds that will eventually breach the speed of light at which point the night's sky will be an empty void if we're around to see it

When that's gone on for long enough it's possible there will be enough nothingness at a specific point where the fabric of space and time is torn apart and trigger a cosmic rebirth and it's just part of a 100 billion year cycle

If a God isn't even required to trigger a Big Bang when that's the last vestiges where we need a deus ex machina to pretend we have a grip on things then what is even the point?

Maybe there is a point, but it's beyond the physical... Maybe if God or religion is to have a place, it doesn't need to have to play a part in how anything came to be or how anything happens"

There's plenty of exploits to pull on BTC the way it's been left open, take your pick of attacks

Replace by fee double spend attacks are different beasts though..

The LN hub and spoke model leaves it open for other means of abuse, mostly in terms of gov and bank

It's why this wouldn't be feasible in India or Venezuela where those institutions have become hostile to their own people and sooner make crypto illegal than allow it to solve the problems of a community in financial upheaval - experiencing runaway inflation of national currencies

Those are the primary use cases for a global decentralized digital cash solution.. The biggest opportunities for growth"

CryptoCurrency,fg3fkh3,t1_fg2yqrd,1580480255.0,"You wish.. BTC has been going over its mempool limit regular past few years. It can't grow as it is now

Bitcoin also needs closed loop ecosystems to survive long term. That's what it was originally designed for. BTC is being built as just a store of value, removing any of its utility

CryptoCurrency,fg3cb02,t1_fg2sm1c,1580477710.0,"A quick look at BTC average TX fee compared to mempool and you'll see that it moves up to a few $$ sporadically because it's hovering around its limit

If popularity spikes like it did at the end of 2017, there's nothing to stop fees from going as high as $50.. If you think that doesn't stop new serious investors or discourage existing ones, you're mistaken

Nothing's been added that protects the end user from this issue"
CryptoCurrency,fg3bo7p,t1_fg2v5v1,1580477188.0,"If a 2nd layer solution is the only way to scale up moving forward then it needs an honest attempt

I hope it ends up better than it looks now, but I'm skeptical this is a solid plan"

CryptoCurrency,fg1asyt,t1_fg14qz2,1580423863.0,"BTC could never do anything close to 2,000,000 txs on chain in one day because of its fixed blocksize, even if it was comprised of a centralized server cluster containing 98% of the BTC nodes on the same server rack. That was my point.

Node relevance is negligible next to that"

CryptoCurrency,fg0r4jr,t1_fg0qddi,1580413385.0,"That could work... But then what would be ""Bitcoin""? Blockstream's continued LN/Liquid push on r/Bitcoin to further reduce the blocksize and limit on chain transactions further for the purpose of ""rallying more nodes"", or the new hard fork that can process more txs? Would it be different in some way from BCH? BCH development has been adding from BTC and ETH

You're not against further splitting the community? Risk draining valued gains from BTC to yet another flavor of Bitcoin"
