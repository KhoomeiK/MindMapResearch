No, the argument is usually that you don't have to engage in gambling and just buy stuff on the market. You don't have to. Vast majority of other loot-box systems don't provide that option."

Base guide. CI requires slight modifications.

Weirdly 60exa doesn't really help. Base build can reach around 30 exa. To go CI you need helmet enchant on Memory Vault, which can cost 60 exa, you might get merciless enchant, which is 20% instead of 30 for much cheaper, which I managed to do. Anyway it's an expensive leap. And then there is RRGGBB +1 Skin of the Loyal, which cost me 45ish exa to maximize the HoaG. Watcher's eye is a cherry on top. It's a weird scaling, because the build has like 1 or 2 rares and the rest are uniques.

SubredditDrama,ffjjmd6,t1_ffjirgt,1579999714.0,"I know what victim blaming is.

Acknowledging that the kids did an asshole thing does not in any way reduce the responsibility of the psychopath who murdered them. This particular case is also very clear cut, because the psychopath in question didn't make any mistake resulting in kids' death, but went out of his way to murder them. 

There is nothing to learn from his actions. There is something to learn from kids' actions. They played stupid games, they won stupid jackpot. No, they did not deserve what happened to them."

Neither does the guy being a psychopath, make the ""ding-dong dash"" any less of an asshole thing to do. Those things are independent.

Then why is it so terrible? Did they sculpt the sets out of paper mache $1 bills and coins? Burn the money in those fires? That didn't look high budget at all. They got rid of the cavalry with cheap CGI send-off, FFS! If by ""high-end"" you mean a sit-com, then maybe.
