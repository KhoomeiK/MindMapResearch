One final edit::  In order to quit (which I had attempted several times.  I ended up checking myself in to a rehab program.  They helped and gave me the resources to bring home with me to succeed.  My insurance covered this (though I think if you don't succeed the first time they won't cover it again).  If you can't check yourself in, there's ALWAYS a meeting nearby, find a directory online!  There are things besides AA as well, but you'll have to dig deeper.   GOOD LUCK!"

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffc7rsp,t1_ffc1tnw,1579793494.0,"Back when Diablo 2 was big gold was worthless, though the same thing is going on with it is described above.  There was little value to it except for use in the ""gambling screen"" which only a small number of enlightened players ever used, and if you knew what you were doing (which you likely did if you were gambling) gold was very easy to come by so you'd never need to use it for trade with another player.

In Diablo 2, the gold simply became a non factor and people used a different currency, SOJs. 

Exactly as you described.

Now if you're the people left out of the loop because there was never any ""new"" gold being added, what will you do?

Just make your own economy and trade with each other.  Bye bye sales tax, and the haves are probably losing too because there are fewer to trade with.

BeachBodyWorkouts,ff9a1x5,t1_ff97eli,1579708271.0,"Right.  More range of motion, more work on the muscle. (Which is what you want when you're working out.)  So how is this not better?

Edited to say more: You can do the same partial motions on a bench I would think.  The reason the partial curls work is because there is nothing for your hands to ever rest on.  So there's more time under tension at the bottom of the motion. So on a bench you're getting the same more time under tension if you only bring your elbows down to shoulder height (like a partial curl)  If you do this you're building endurance rather than size.  More of a Bruce lee, less of an Arnold.  Doing reps with more range of motion will build size and strength."
