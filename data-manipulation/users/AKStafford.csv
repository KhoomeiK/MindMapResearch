And they the same unit numbering at the top. His is 1001. We had 1001 through 1021. 1007 drove the best but they were all maintenance nightmares. The mechanics hated them. 
Granted, they were a cool concept. Holland America originally bought them for a cruisetour they offered between Skagway, Alaska and Dawson City, Yukon. The trailer portion was set up as a lounge area with a galley and an attendant. You could grab food or a drink. The front held 48 passengers. 
But that road beat them to death. There was no way you could stand in the back with a drink when you could stand at all with the bumps. And that trailer section would bounce.... And that is where the restroom was out. I used to feel horrible for people as I would see them go in right before a bumpy patch. 
By the time I drove them they had tore out the back lounge and put in seats. So capacity for 68 passengers. We’d use them for the “cattle haul”; taking cruise ship passengers between the port in Seward to the Anchorage airport. 
They had some nasty tricks. The AC system like to dump all the moisture at once onto your windshield. So you’d go from clear windows to completely fogged up in about 5 seconds. Going up Turnagain Pass they’d drop all the way down to 12 MPH climbing the hill."

todayilearned,fezoqrr,t1_fezigpl,1579459768.0,"So this has me thinking.... I work for a non-profit organization that provides education programming to the Department of Corrections at no coast. One of the goals is to give incarcerated individuals the tools needed to break the pattern of recidivism. 
The US has 2.4 million people incarcerated today. 95% of those will serve their time and be released back in to our communities. 
The current recidivism rate is 66% nationally (and also in my state). 2 out of every 3 people who serve their sentence and get out will be back. We call it “ridin’ the be-back bus”. 
Theoretically, if we could eliminate recidivism, we’d drop the prison population to 800,000 people and I’d probably be out of a job. 
But I’m okay with that. I can find another job. I’d rather see the positive change in our society. 
So I’m sure there are some non-profits in it for the money and want to do whatever they can to keep the cash cow mooing. But for me, and I’m sure for many others, we’d rather see the problem fixed."

My 2nd week of training they told me they wanted me to get checked out in those coaches. I thought it was an honor based on my driving skills. And maybe it was. 
But they were used as cattle haulers (not real cattle... just people herded like cattle) running people between the port in Seward and the airport in Anchorage. Three days a week I spent 20 hours a day doing this. (At the time Alaska has special commercial driving rules that allow 20 hours on duty, 15 hours behind the wheel).

Day two: head north. Matanuska Glacier Guides operates winter hikes on the Matanuska Glacier. And the drive up to Hatcher Pass on Palmer-Fishhook Road is scenic. 
With your limited time and the limited daylight hours; I think getting as far as Seward or Homer is trying to get too far. Google Maps gives you accurate mileage, but you can add another 30% to 40% to their drive times.
