Raynauds,ffhaspi,t3_etl923,1579928196.0," Have been doing the Raynauds thing a long time.  Here is what I learned:

Don't get cold.

 Don't get wet.

 Don't get cold and wet at the same time. (Just don't.  Hurts like a mofo)

If you live in a cold climate, get a long handled ice scraper/snow brush.  You want to keep your hands away from the snow and ice.  All else fails post ice storm, you will want de-icing spray for your windshield.  Just don't get it on your paint.

If you can do it, get a wood stove or pellet stove.  That radiant heat during a flare up is a godsend.

Avoid stress.. 

Be sure your doctor knows to flag your medical records; medical folks who don't know freak out quick, or, turn interesting colors and need to be sat down before they fall down. 

Be patient with folks who just don't know.  

Be prepared to shut the mean folks down promptly.

Take up drinking tea.  

 Get on a first name basis with the customer service reps with your favorite cold weather outdoor outfitter.  I recommend LL Bean or Cabelas.  


Buy a down comforter (pricey but worth it) and down couch throw (less pricey but still worth it). 

 Buy an electric blanket or heated mattress pad (you pick, Sunbeam is cheap and holds up).  

Cotton sheets for summer. 
 Microfiber, Jersey or flannel sheets for winter. 

 Quality blankets (Pendleton is good if you can deal with wool and it will last forever if you take good care of it; same with the down comforters and the sheets  

 Be prepared to make your own outdoor gear if you cannot find what you want..or make friends with a gear maker (hi!) 

And always know where your gloves are."

IllegallySmolCats,ffdhe1h,t3_ess0pf,1579820907.0,It's the most rewarding thing to see feral kittens get with the program when it comes to being petted.
offmychest,ffddv49,t1_ffd71ay,1579818808.0,"Asking someone to prove themselves only leads to being asked to prove more..and it doesn't necessarily lead to acceptance.  

Just ask anyone who has ever been in a relationship where they were essentially checked out by thier intended's family and friends to make sure they weren't like the ex.   It's a useless, dysfunctional and demoralizing process, and in due course, people run out of patience with it, and when they see even a whiff of it happening in  another relationship, the situation becomes 'I have seen this nonsense before and I'm just not going through that again!'  Enter some unpleasantness and a breakup, and..rinse; repeat.

Same goes with some so-called professional interviews.  Eventually one thinks, ' I understand that your last hire didn't work for some reason, otherwise we wouldn't be here. 
However, if you're going to test me with a kind of crud right out of the gate when you have my resume in your hand  and my social media available to you, basically the entirety of my life on a platter...how do you treat the people you actually hire'?

It's not about 'proving yourself as not lazy'. 

 It's about establishing professional behavior on both sides and not wasting company or interviewee time.   And a lot of companies could do a much better job of it."
UnsentLetters,ffd6ugy,t1_ffcfha6,1579814563.0,"I've been in your shoes.  After losing one of my last dogs unexpectedly, I couldn't look at another dog without bursting into tears.  

I didn't think I could be a good dog Mom to a new dog either.  

One day, a few years down the road, I discovered that I could look at and pet another dog without needing to go have a good cry later, and called it good.

Years after that, I wound up getting a job that involved me working closely with dogs.  

6 months later, I was in a space where a watchdog was a good idea. My watch cat (I am not kidding) is getting up there in years.

I walked into the shelter and about 30 minutes later I had been chosen by a big Labrador. 

That dog, slowly but surely, became MY dog.  And even my cat, as opinionated as he is, said 'OK'.

My dog _isn't_ like my old dog that I lost.  He _isn't_ comparable.  And that's OK.  They're very different dogs.    

 And I have space in my heart for both of them. 


You will, too.   Once you've been a dog mom..even if you need to take a break, you will always be a dog person to a point, even if it is just as an honorary auntie who knows how to give the best pettings.

The day will come when there's a nudge in your heart to be a full time dog Mom again..and it will be all right."

Dogtraining,ff4vhp9,t3_ermzwi,1579573426.0,"I've got a Lab and a TerrierX.  Both of them are very good dogs as long as I allow them to play to thier strengths.   

My Lab is a big sweet well mannered goof.  His big neurotic thing is biting at himself sometimes.   He got stung by a bee awhile back and that's what set him off; his feet and sides have been fair game since. In the summer, I lay in a supply of Benadryl and doggy tshirts and call it good.

  His big obsession is tennis balls.  He loves them.  His big thing when outside is sniffing everydarnthing.  His biggest thing, though, is guarding me, as well as watching over our neighbors small children as they wait for thier school bus.

My  TerrierX is likely crossed with a smaller herding breed.  I've seen her, neat as you please, cut a larger dog out of a pack of dogs at the dog park, and pen it into the small dog area and wait for commands on what to do next.  This is impressive by itself.  But when you add in that she only has 3 legs, it becomes phenomenal. She does better on her 3 legs than some dogs do on 4.   (I had no idea she could do that until she did it.)    

I've also seen her love on my neighbor's kids.

Her big fault is that she tends to over groom herself and has had given herself a wicked hairball.

Both dogs are shelter dogs."

March into the sewing machine hospital and tell them what you're making. Advise that you're looking for an all metal mechanical machine that will do straight stitch and zig zag through layers for not an outrageous fortune.

Chances are they have the correct old iron for you sitting lonely in thier back room and will be willing to sell it to you after they service it.

Raynauds,fel1ey0,t3_epoq0i,1579211976.0,"Fellow pale person over here.  I've  done the Raynauds thing for decades. 

Here's what I learned, to 'blend in as normally as possible', because it does feel lonely to have this and walk around like this sometimes.  The whole thing sucks and I hear you, OP.  I haven't forgotten what it feels like to be 16 and hearing what others had to say when I was just chilled.  If I actually turned colors...eesh.  kids can be mean. So-called adults can be worse.

Anyway.

 Protip1: nail polish.  Avoid blue. Avoid pastels.  (Unless of course you're trying to make the Raynauds look worse, in which case, you do you). 
OPI, Essie and China Glaze polishes cover the blue well.  

Protip2: learn to sew (sewing machine and serger; you can find cheap, good quality machines and other equipment you will need at estate sales, just get machines serviced at the sewing machine hospital before you use them) and especially kimono, sweater, coat and overshirt patterns.  You can do a LOT with those.  If your school doesn't do Home Ec anymore, sewing lessons are easily had through any church or quilting store. Or, my favorite, YouTube.  

If your parents bitch about the expense, tell them it could be worse, you could be into far less wholesome things.  

Bear with me a moment:

   Kimono in cotton interlock fabric or silk are casual or classy (depending on the fabric) and air conditioning friendly arm cover-ups in the summer.  Make your sleeves a little longer and you've effectively covered up your hands until it's time to roll up your sleeves and get something done.  Lots of folks find that a/c isn't always thier friend in the summer, so you won't necessarily look out of place unless someone looks close.

  In the winter, fleece kimono are clothing-layers friendly clothes; think; long sleeved t-shirt or turtleneck base layer, sweater-ish insulation layer, kimono on top.  Bonus points for fingerless gloves. 

Also good are flannel and denim overshirts.   There are a bunch of patternmakers with cute clothes to make to keep you warm, and Mill Yardage Fabric or Seattle Fabrics should have the technical fabric you need.  Joanns has some flannel backed satin for classier looking kimono.  If you can find pretty silk on sale, grab it.

Protip3: On those days when you need some extra covers, an insulated barn jacket is your friend because it has large pockets for putting hand warmer thingies in them.  LL Bean is my go-to for this.  Or make your own.

If you cosplay, do it in a character that wears a cape or cloak.  Easy to sew and you can add interior pockets for hand warmer thingies.

Protip4: fleece or wool socks are your friend, and a yard on fleece on sale can make you socks with mittens and a hat to match. 
(Hey, if you can't not be blue, at least be awesome color coordinated and comfy)

Protip5: wear a medic-alert necklace.  Raynauds can advance _quickly_ and present in strange ways and EMS/ medical personnel is going to need to know WTF to do with you.  

Protip6: Raynauds can go batchit under stress and people aren't always going to know how to deal.  Some of them may freak out completely.  Be prepared to take the proverbial bull by the horns and set someone down safely if they start turning pale or green around the gills at the sight of your hands turning color or worse (if you cut yourself, you may not know at first; walking around as a talking anatomy lesson is a guaranteed freakout).  Make them put thier head between thier knees and breathe and keep breathing until they're not dizzy-sick any more.

Protip7: tea or hot water in stoneware travel mugs will warm your hands asap.  

Protip8: microwave heat packs will help warm your hands/feet/ extremities should you need it.

Protip9: hot paraffin dips followed by massage will help with warming your hands back up and helps with the dry hand skin some of us get, especially in the winter.

Protip10: acupuncture may help. Massage therapy may also help.  Explore alternative treatments; you may find one that works for you to lessen the severity of your symptoms. 

Protip11: use this as a superpower once in awhile

Protip12: no matter how you warn people or try to prepare them, some may not take it well or will try to make you feel bad.  Remember how they feel about your condition and react to it is on them; how you respond to them reacting to you and your condition is on you. Be a professional until it is time to NOT be professional about it. Don't be afraid to (be a bitch) self-advocate; your legitimate medical needs overrule someone snowflaking out.

You will face down fearful people. You will face down those who are prejudiced against the breed because all they know is what they see on TV.

 You will face down ignorance. 

You may (although I pray you don't) face down violence. 

You may face down (again I pray you don't) dog thieves, or those who will wish..or actually do..your dog harm.

You will also face people who love your dog and have no fear of it.  Treasure these people. :)"

dogs,fdj2im8,t3_elm6iu,1578456753.0,"The shedding isn't that bad on a Rough (long) coat unless your dog has a coat type closer to cotton candy than a classic, correct, weather resistant double coat.   But when it does shed during the change of seasons, it will give your vacuum a workout.

The Smooth (short) coat will give your vacuum a workout year round.

That said. Learn to properly brush the coats down to the skin, run an air filter, and use a really good vacuum, you should be fine with either a Smooth or a Rough coat Collie."

If all else fails, there is always de-icing spray from the auto parts store.  Use it carefully because you don't want to have overspray mess up your paint job."

vintagesewing,fd095a0,t3_ejr5ko,1578115483.0,That looks like a low shank adapter and a new thumb screw would give you a presser foot option.  Www.sewingmachineparts.  com is a good place to start; the customer service people really know thier machines and should be able to help if you need more than that.    A good oil/clean/electrical inspection plus parts should get you into operating condition.   Hope this helps!

Kitchenaid,fct7laf,t3_eiruxm,1577934985.0,"Yes.  It does take some doing, though.

Here's whatcha do: 

Set up your mixer like usual.  Make your raw ice cream base (there are lots of recipes online).

Assuming you are making a custard base ice cream base, cook it according to the recipe.

Before reaching the critical stirring stage during cooking, line a large pyrex dish with a sheet of tin foil. (This will make your life easier down the road; also, I use my pyrex lasagna pan)

Once your custard has cooked, pour your hot custard into the lined dish.  Let cool; then freeze for a few hours to the 'almost too hard to be soft serve' stage. 

Dump the lot into your mixer bowl.  With the stand mixer & paddle (it's probably too hard for the whisk), incorporate some air into this mix.  

Put your tin foil back into your dish. 

Add your beaten mix back into the bowl; freeze to desired consistency. Serve."

newhampshire,fcs14ns,t3_eilqt7,1577909793.0,"Try some of the smaller towns around Nashua; it's less jam packed and doesn't add a whole lot of commute time back into Nashua if that's where you need to be.  

 I'd suggest Milford, or Hollis if you can sneak back into Nashua by way of Exits 1, 6, or 8 and be OK with commuting that way.

I'd suggest Hudson if you can be OK with coming back into Nashua by way of DW Highway.

  I'd suggest Merrimack if you need to be right there on the Rt 3 corridor and you're coming into the area around W. Hollis or Pearl St. 

   If you can be further out and still be OK, try Brookline.  

There are other little towns too.  So, you have options. 

Your best bet is probably to contact a realty agency,  ask for the property management division, and have them direct you appropriately, because for what you're describing, you will likely wind up dealing with a private landlord as opposed to an entire apartment complex. 

Good luck!"

dogs,fckyq8e,t3_ehpj7h,1577736055.0,"Dogs have senses better than ours, especially when you start talking about the working breeds.  If a dog is suddenly stopping dead, refusing treats and sweet talking, etc., _something is wrong and you need to trust it, even if the dog is new and has a reputation for being a silly pants about certain things._

Find an alternate route to walk, especially if you're a woman.  Creeps are out there and the dog may sense them before you do."

Then again, there _are_ dogs that throw the wrong signals, creating a 'is this really the right call to make' situation.

That said, I have always erred on the side of caution and have elected to keep my dogs out of situations that could create a problem. 

Better safe than hurt, dead, or getting reamed in court."
