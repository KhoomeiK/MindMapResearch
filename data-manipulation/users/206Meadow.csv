13 hours (several times in the last few years at my current job. Regular shift and most of the next one when they are short staffed in winter)

14 hours (a food truck that made funal cakes. I got $140 and all the food i wanted even if it wasnt from our food truck) that was a fun job. Was a two hour ride though."

hiking,fffhsl1,t1_fffeorb,1579884256.0,I want to hike most of the National scenic trials but not Floridas. Mostly the gators and snakes keep me from wanting to.
AskReddit,fffgizm,t1_fffby3c,1579883468.0,There was an insult i hear once that this reminds me of. Something about being so stupid they had to carry a houseplant to replace all the oxygen they used up with stupid questions.
AskReddit,fffga2e,t3_etc0z5,1579883314.0,"I bring my own bags when i go shoping. They are bigger and most of the ones i have are insulated. No double bagging groceries i can get 30+frozen pizzas in one bag i love those bags.

I have a set of silverware that i bring with me everywhere. Everyone is so concerned about the straws but those plastic forks and knives and spoons add up too. That and those plastic knives can't cut shit anyway.

I reuse the same water bottle. I have huge packs of water at home. We recently had a huge storm and i went out and bought water incase the town i live in didnt have power for a week. The water towers rely on a pump to get the water up there but no power means when that water runs out no water either. We were out of power for 24 hours but i had coworkers out for a week or more. Every time i grab one to bring somewhere i bring it back home and refill it. In the future when i get my own place i will have a hand pump in the yard so i will always have water.

I will be starting a garden in my back yard this year for the vegetable i eat a lot. This will cut down on waste, all the plastic bags that they sell the stuff like spinach in, unused food, transport costs. It will be organic so no nasty chemicals on my spinach and stuff. 

I will have my car paid off this year. After i do i will find a job within 2 miles of my house and walk or ride bike there for most of the year (i live in northwestern Wisconsin and we get lots of snow and often spend months below 32°f before we get a warm spell. I will only use my car for the big grocery shopping haul once a month or if i need to get to work in the winter.

I plan on makeing homemade bread to cut down on the number of plastic bags that come in the house.

We dont have a bulk food store in the area where you can bring your own containers but that would be something i would love to do. Unfortunately driving over an hour to get to one is not practical. 

I got a presser canner for the new year and plan on canning all the foods from the garden that i can't eat right away. 

When i go hiking i have a cold soak Vargo Bot to rehydrate the food without the need for fuel from my stove. I can soak my pasta in the Bot for 30 minutes or so before hand and if i need to heat up  it only takes a minute to heat up rather than the 10 to boil the water and cook the pasta. (i love pasta)

When i walk the dog i pick up trash i see on the side of the road and on the trails. Lucky dog got a free tennis ball we found on our walk."

AskReddit,ffehinn,t3_et5hqp,1579848232.0,"$250 a day magical shows up in my hand at midnight every night forever.

I dont need to eat to survive.

I will be in perfect health for the rest of my life even if a plague kills us all.

I can become invisible for 24 hours if my life depended on it.

I would be 20% stronger than i am now.

I would be able to memorize anything i read.

I can breath under water for 1 hour.

I am alway the perfect temp. No need for big winter coats or blankets.

I can learn any language in 5 weeks and be like a native speaker."

DnD,ffegfwx,t3_et5i5g,1579847033.0,Henoce Marguthra. Bastard child of a prince in a far off land. Was covered up so well even Henoce doesn't know. Was raised by a farmer but ran away after a plague killed off the family. Was an apprentice to a blacksmith for a few years but was accused of stealing from the shop next door that sold pastries...well they were really good... but it was just once...a week. Left town and found a lumberjack in need of a new axe head. Made a new axe head in exchange for a few lessons in tree felling. Built a house in the woods slowly over several hard winters. Still steals sweets from time to time. Likes to tinker and invent things not very good at it but Henoce doesn't care.

AskReddit,ffeet32,t3_et5ig9,1579845313.0,Now. The plague is coming. The end is near. There will be mass crop loss again this year. We can not stop it. We can not win. But we must never ever give in. For this too shall pass. We will be forgoten. For we are all just the miserable downtrodden.
WouldYouRather,ffeea2r,t3_et5j72,1579844788.0,"Give everyone 1000. There are people out there that need a boost out of what they are in. Maybe they need food, maybe they need to replace an appliance, maybe its a ticket home to see a loved one before death. For some it will be a toy or a vacation or a night out with friends. Others will not even notice the difference but some family of 10 will have 10,000 to spend between them maybe its a down payment on a vehicle or a house renovation. Maybe the its the start of a savings account for a young teen or child. Perhaps its a new school uniform so they stop getting teased about the old shirt that has been in the family for 4 years and is 2 sizes to small for the youngest."

AskReddit,ffec50q,t1_ffeb4pc,1579842745.0,"I second this. There are a lot of bridges out east that are shorter or have lower weight limits due to the old days with horses. I have watched many a uhaul get the top riped off going under short bridges. Also unless you know the roads you will be taking it will be exhausting. The roads out east are more twisty and are not laid out in a grid pattern so fiding your way around could be extra stress you dont need not to mention all the one way roads. I would pack all the things you need right away toilet paper, plunger you heard me right, soap, towels, a pot and pan for the first few meals, all work related things, anything you need in the next 24 hours like medical things, a cpap machine anything you cant live without in your new place in you vechile and drive there behind the moving truck. If you have to stop along the way you have all the things you need in your car so you dont have to unpack the moving truck for your toothbrush."

AskReddit,fen51mi,t3_eq13iv,1579277125.0,"26 I wasnt on my parents health insurance anymore. My work had me fill out all the paperwork for insurance. The flexible spending account...my mom told me $50 the HR lady filling out all the stuff on her computer and I had a miss communication. I paid $50 a pay check. I thought it was supposed to be $50 a month. My mom ment $50 a year. Between the health insurance and the flexible spending account I went from $50 a week just on eating out with friends or buying pizzas for my coworkers to having $2.16 in my bank account. It was a steep learning curve. For the next 7 months before i could change my plan again I lived so close to poverty if i hadnt been living with my parents i would have been homeless. I wouldnt change any of it though. I learned so much so quick about money, budgeting, saving, sales, coupons, price per portion of things, how to streach a meal out with rice or pasta, drinking more water because it was free.
The next year dad got cancer. I spent 40+ hours a week taking care of him along with working 40 to 48 hours a week at my job. After he died i took over most of the household stuff he did. All the little jobs that were gross or only needed to be done once in a month. That i wish i could change. I have so many questions i wish i had asked him about how to do stuff or about family tree stuff."
