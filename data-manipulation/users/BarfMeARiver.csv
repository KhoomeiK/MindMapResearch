Edmonton,ffqiknz,t3_eufvu8,1580135592.0,"Have you called the police to report the suspicious activity? 

In our neighbourhood we report suspicious people or cars and the police send a car around more often to check. We had a community league meeting a few years back and two officers attended, they gave us contact info for the station that takes care of our area. 

If you see the van again, I'd call the police. They'll come and knock on the door and speak to the occupants. They wouldn't come back again after that I'm sure. 

A lot of people complain about the police but I am of the mind that they can't police what they don't know about."

Whenever I'm stopped in traffic, my eyes are on the rear view more than half the time, because I was rear ended once at a red light in standstill traffic. Traffic that had been stopped for a few minutes during rush hour. There was no reason for the other driver to have hit me. My car was nearly written off; I had lasting injuries for years that affected my ability to work and quality of life. 

I guarantee this poor driver will be anxiously looking in the rearview for the rest of his life driving. I feel like once you've been hit, you're expecting it ever after."

asoiaf,feyypz4,t1_feygpae,1579452125.0,"True. 

I love how this text gets one questioning, with the POVs being unreliable, or skewed, or tinged with certain personality traits, as all people's POVs are. 

We could read this endlessly and come up with theories.

I was just struck by the 'laughing purple eyes' comment. Why is that there? Do we know Ashara could not have been strong enough or experienced enough to wield a sword and fight off the 3 squires? I feel like nothing is certain but death and taxes."
asoiaf,feyycje,t1_few0xkf,1579451978.0,"That's interesting, that never occurred to me as a possibility!

I am loathe to try and come up with theories because I can think of something that fits 9/10 memories but there's always a 10th that denies my theory.

I do not believe Ashara's baby died, and I have a feeling she may still be alive and did not throw herself into the sea. Sometimes I think Ashara may be Jon's mother, and Ned or Brandon is the father. But Barristan's thoughts about how Ashara was dishonoured make me think it wasn't above board (eg. the man who fathered her child was married) and that it was Rhaegar; and perhaps Ashara and Rhaegar are *Dany's* parents.  

Further, having read this post, I wonder if Lyanna protected Ashara in some way, or aided her in hiding her pregnancy?

I just find the 'laughing purple eyes' a curious comment considering the tourney's mystery knight."
asoiaf,fevlpg6,t1_fetzd4g,1579398820.0,">Also, you should review the other story of this event. The one that Meera tells. Meera telling the story from her father's point of view describes Ashara as having laughing violet eyes. Meera can't believe Bran has never heard this story. The part of the story involving Ashara Dayne isn't seen as a tragedy. Makes you think.

Tinfoil on - could it be possible Ashara is the Knight of the Laughing Tree?"
Edmonton,fevhx1p,t3_eqp4r7,1579397670.0,"Something to do at home if she has a smartphone is Duolingo. It's free, it's a language learning app, and it might just provide a bit of practice. 

The library is also a great resource like the other poster mentioned!

Edit: Duolingo doesn't have Tamil as a currently spoken language, but there might be some language learning apps out there that do have it. I would suggest taking a look."
