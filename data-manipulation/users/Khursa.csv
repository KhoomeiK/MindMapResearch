GetMotivated,ff26xgx,t1_ff26h6k,1579495548.0,"You can say that you dont want to insult my belief all you want. But saying ""it really is"", is just that. Next time you want to act openminded about different beliefs, may i siggest using a wording like ""to me it is"" og ""that is my belief"". It's getting your feelings and point of view across without saying ""my belief is right, yours is wrong"""
