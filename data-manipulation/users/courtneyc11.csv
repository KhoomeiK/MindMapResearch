offmychest,felseur,t3_epfsk2,1579229777.0,"Myself and my boyfriend are long time vapers, going on about 5 years now. We both used to smoke. I have not picked up a cigarette in I don't know how long. I don't even get the urge to smoke a cigarette and the smell of them just grosses me out now. I have felt so much better since I quit smoking and I recently started about a year ago making our own juice. I know everything that goes into the liquid. I control how much nicotine goes into the juice and have been cutting it down. So no there is not more nicotine in a vape then there is in a cigarette. I actually did the research and a cigarette has about 40x the amount of nicotine then a vape does. There are no studies out because vaping hasn't been out long enough for them to do one. The only study they have been able to do are the cig a like e cigarette's i.e the blue cigarette. I have talked to many vapors and people that have even been vaping longer and there all fine."
