""the customer is always right"" is used by companies as an excuse by lazy management to excuse customers who are rude and abusive because managers are afraid to stand up to them.."

What are autistic people good at? Extreme attention to detail. What makes a good car wash worker? Here in Australia they call it ""car detailing""

An example, and I am not suggesting that this is the case, but sometimes, people who have been sexually abused with, in an attempt to take back power in their lives, will become sexually active.

Any negative feelings about your hobby are entirely their own responsibility and you have no need to judge yourself harshly because of it

Does the practice cause any harm to you, or as an expression of some sort of mental health issues that need dealing with? (no judgement, this is a question for you, not for me or anyone else) 

Would you be prepared to give it up if it became a requirement to stay in the relationship? Now is a good time to consider this, before hormones get in the way. (similar but different, I was happy to move countries to be with my wife. But 6 years before, that wouldn't have been an option that I would have considered)

Any negative judgement about your hobby is based on historical cultural practices which were about the ownership of women's bodies. However, in a committed relationship, cultural beliefs have to be negotiated if they aren't in agreement.

So first of all, you are going to have to think about how to make everyone feel ""at home"" things I have seen are coffee cups with people's names on them, and a chalk board with names instead of loyalty cards.

Next, become a place that makes people money. Buy as much as possible of your products from locals. I don't know the food laws, but what if your hotdogs featured a relish made by the local PTA featuring Aunt Mables old family recipe?

Then you offer the place for free to community organisations in the evening when it is quiet. One of the big problems in rural areas is social isolation. You have a big, mostly empty space. With cheap coffee and grandma's pecan pie.

Then become ""the mayor of the area"" let local community groups use your space to have car washes. Advertise that parents get a free coffee for every A on their child's report card. Every time something good happens in the community, a picture goes up on the bulletin board. Every time there is a tragedy, you are the Center for collecting.

You want to build a culture where, because you have done so much for the community, people feel guilty if they fill the tank up on their way home at the next town over, where gas is 5 cents cheaper. You build a culture where you have given so much to the community that brand loyalty becomes something that is enforced by the community.

This was ""free"" as in no financial exchange.

And there was no promise of anything. Had she not been a remarkable person who really impressed me, I wouldn't have referred her. There was no discussion of that it wasn't ""come help me, I'll get you a job"""

I had a young woman who was a second year marketing student do some free consultation with me, and she made me a logo. I introduced her to a small business owner who wasn't doing any marketing but had a good, well established business. Without my telling him to call her, she never would have gotten a foot in the door."

However, that is fairly immaterial. The fact is that the Forests were dryer than dryer then ever before, earlier in the season than ever before.

That is the fact that the Murdoch's were trying to distract from."

Now I just laugh about it. I use it as a tool to make connections with people. I can decide that I don't know certain social conventions which I don't find convenient. So I'm awkward. So that mean I can talk to anyone. I can tell a person I think they are amazing because I want to.

If you want to become a blacksmith, don't reinvent the wheel unless you have to. Start by looking to see if there is a blacksmithing association or a men's shed in your area.

The membership was $30 a year at the time. A lot less than $700"
Economics,feglvkh,t1_feg4l0w,1579096756.0,"This is the exact thing I realised recently. All the solutions to climate change involve product which are much better than what they are replacing.

My interest is passive solar designed houses. A house that, in most climates will have little to no additional energy needs. Warmed by the sun, cooled by the prevailing breeze.

Electric cars meaning that for most people, you aren't spending ten minutes every week enveloped in a cloud of a known cancerous agent filling your tank.

Some friends are working on a process of farming called ""regenerative agriculture"" it renders farms far more drought tolerant. The streams start running again.

Hemp is an incredible product. Most of the ""disposable"" plastics can be made from hemp. Houses using hemp that is rendered are far more fireproof than a lot of other current building methods.

So many great solutions. People just gave to get better at marketing them to the general public."
