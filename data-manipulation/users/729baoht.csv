donorconceived,fepycsk,t1_fepxwuj,1579334529.0,I hope it is helpful. I also know of donor children who don't know at all. And I imagine what it must be like for them when they finally do find out
donorconceived,fepuefs,t3_ebvsrm,1579331645.0,"May be a little late to the party, am a donor child myself.. looked for a subreddit on it, am browsing through. 

I was told young, like, young young. And I worked out the particulars myself around 9 years old. 

What I was told was I was born via a sperm donor. Simple as that. When I worked out what the terms meant, I could work out the rest. By 9 years old I realised my father wasn't my father. And as a 31 year old now, who has met other donor children who found out later in life, I'm glad my parents told me the way they did. I would have been so angry finding out later, but this way my child mind didn't see anything different about it. 

Just my own experience for you there as advice. 

Have also met my donor! Very strange experience but not a bad one. Keep in touch via Facebook now"
