The two minds are qualitatively similar in that they have the exact same memories and personality traits, but they can't be the same being (numerical identity) because no object exists in two places at once, and what Person A in the real world sees or experiences isn't necessarily going to be shared by Person B in the computer simulation unless they are somehow able to function as a hivemind.
