If the festival is in may id wait a bit longer for prices to fluctuate. I live in LA now and I still drive to Vegas to fly out because it’s cheaper than anywhere in Cali. 

Try spirit. The flights suck but spirit do be having the lowest fares.

But I wish the best of luck and enjoy the festival. 

If you need any advice on dope spots in Vegas lmk."
TravelHacks,ffh27p9,t1_ffh1u8l,1579921127.0,"That seems expensive for that. Which airlines are you trying and what days are you planning? Try landing a day or two before the festival and after. 

Sometimes Thursday and Friday flights are the most expensive since that’s the high demand. Especially if there’s a festival. I loved in Vegas for 7 years and the worst time to fly in is Friday since everyone starts their Vegas trip on fridays."

Shoestring,ffgyc55,t3_etjlcl,1579918209.0,"Depends if it’s a “personal item” or an actual carry on bag that is like a big backpack or a small suitcase. If you pay ahead of time it’s cheaper. If you pay at the gate it’s always wayyyy more expensive. 
The website should say the dimensions of both a personal item and carry on bag"

Ever hear a noise in your car,  and think “fuck time for the mechanic to look at it” 
So you go to a mechanic and then the noise disappears and the mechanic is thinking you’re stupid? 
Well joy cons are the same thing. They work randomly but then will fuck up when you’re by yourself. They play games on you. 

But it sounds like either the joycons didn’t connect or they are buggy on every game but possibly doesn’t show as much in odyssey"
MarioKart8Deluxe,fffzpfr,t1_fffz6iy,1579895322.0,"When you buy new joy cons from like game stop, they give you a warranty. I use my switch mainly as a handheld because I watch tv( listen watching, I call it “latching”) so unfortunately I go through joycons every few months if I’m lucky"

MarioKart8Deluxe,fffy3h7,t3_etdewd,1579894325.0,Check your joycon. Sometimes it will have troubles reading movements. I had similar issues where I’d randomly run into walls and my character react to my commands.
