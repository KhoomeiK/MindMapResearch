Down in Vic we’re fuming. We have a strong labor base but even so as you said any Liberal leader of Australia should be able to handle this situation. Scotty from marketing has done an abysmal job and is embarrassing us on a global scale. 

I’m so proud of our volunteers and even the communities not affected by the fire that are donating money and goods needed for the victims. 

But not Scummo. As he said, his job isn’t to hold hoses. Yet even bloody Abbott did. And we ridiculed him as you’ve said, but he has pulled his weight as an Aussie citizen and fought with the battlers regardless of how we treated Abbott when he was PM.

chihayafuru,fdchpoo,t3_ekjqh2,1578275174.0,"She’s seriously shook by it because it makes her realize she has misinterpreted the foundation of their relationship for years. She always thought it was the love of karuta that held them together, and now she realizes both boys have loved her romantically. I think it’s this point that she also sees how misleading and unfair she was to Taichi throughout their high school years. 

As a huge TaichixChihaya fan, I still don’t have a lot of hope of the couple because it’s taken so long for Chihaya to reconcile her relationship with Taichi and come to the understanding that not all of her friends love the game as much as she thought. 

It’s been a great change for her personality, but I never saw it as a hopeful nod towards their relationship. Truly I wish they will be together at the end but I think the best scenario realistically at this point is she doesn’t pick either boys and leaves it open ended romantically."

Large cats in captivity or desensitized to humans, lose their fear of humans. Besides that they get bored in small enclosures, so a man jumping the fence straight into their play area is hella exciting for a bored tiger. The amount of misinformation out there is terrible."
