IncelExit,ffcaq0r,t3_epuhhf,1579795367.0,">You're not supposed to compare yourself to other people.

That's true and it's a difficult cycle to break. I doubt I'll ever be able to entirely rid myself of comparisons but certainly in recent times I've began to care a lot less. 

I won't go into specifics, but there's certain things with regards to comparisons I know I was doing three years ago or so that I have little desire to do now. I don't know how or why I've changed - unless I've just increasingly 'accepted' my position over time and focused more of my efforts away from issues that upset me. 

>Improvement doesn't happen over night, and is a consistent process.

Indeed, this is true also. There's no specific time frame. Some people, like myself, can spend years of our lives doing what we can to improve our lives. In some cases it works and in others, unfortunately myself included, where you can do what you can but it makes not one jot of difference. I only wish those who repeat the same old phrase and pieces of generic advice accept that we have made effort and that, for whatever reason, those efforts haven't been acknowledged. 

Personally speaking, I'm proud of the steps I've taken in order to 'bring me out of my shell' more. Given I deal with bouts of depression and social anxiety - it's certainly no easy feat. I've done things outside of my comfort zone which whilst I'm pleased of doing, hasn't seen my image improve or be respected any more than it did previously. It's been an incredibly frustrating process. 

>People have different preferences

This is something which I'm not *entirely* convinced about. Of course people have different variables on what they look for, I've come across too many coincidences and patterns in my lifetime where I personally feel there's certain preferences which seem to be quite constant."

I think I first felt 'age' when I got to around my mid-twenties and then realised those basic lifetime progressions had been made by people five years (plus) my junior. 

Now that I'm approaching my mid thirties and nothing has changed - it's something I dread to think about for too long now. There are people near enough half my age who have already achieved what I've spent my adulthood (and adolescence) dreaming of. 

To say the situation is humiliating would be an understatement. Especially when you've already been openly mocked and stigmatised in public.

I won't say 'never' to anything, but I have to be realistic of what's achievable now.  A lot of damage (emotionally) has been done and I do genuinely question whether that's repairable or not. A few years of 'nothing' is something which you can just sweep under the carpet and get over - but your entire adult lifetime to date? Much trickier... Those 'lost years/decades' (and counting...) are very much at the forefront of my mind. 

I'm unsure I would be happy if I was to ever find romance now, because of the stigmas I've had to deal with in the past. 

I'd be interested to hear from any former 'incel' who managed to achieve their first date and lost their virginity upwards of the age of 30. I'm sure there is a positive side to that, but at the moment I simply can't forget about what *hasn't* been - despite my best efforts."

You've probably been told this before, but at your age you do genuinely have plenty of time left. I appreciate the frustration. We've all been there... For me, things started to go from a 'steep incline' to almost vertical when I got to around the age of 25. At this point you aren't only dealing with the problems you face today, but also previous baggage. It's around this age when you'll find the number women who haven't had kids starts to drop. Get to 30 and this drops off again - very sharply. It's the same story with the expectations. 

I more or less accepted I'll remain the way I am by the time I turned 30, although in my heart I kind-of knew it a few years prior to that. I just didn't say anything at the time. 

For me, I limit my social exposure. Far from ideal of course, but in turn this limits the criticisms, personal questions, jokes and stigmatisation I often face when I attend any social get-together. I'll only go to such events if absolutely necessary. Even then, I find myself 'clock watching' waiting for the end to come. 

I accept that this probably isn't good for my mental health but as someone who deals with Social Anxiety and bouts of depression (largely because I remain a dateless virgin with no lifetime progressions), it's the lesser of both evils.

Having no friends is far from ideal, but lesser of both evils. I had a few people I'd consider to be 'toxic' who clung on towards the end of my teens. I found them to be problematic, time consuming and frustrating. Once they'd walked out of my life, I honestly felt like a huge weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I went ten years with no friends at all. 

Then, back in 2015, purely by chance I bumped into my former best friend who I hadn't seen face-to-face in those ten years. Cutting a long story short he wanted me to remain in touch and at that time, I was trying different methods to improve my social life. So, I did... In previous years (and what I'd do again now) is to basically not stay in touch. 

Anyway, we met up a few times since then for drinks and it become apparent after even after the first meeting that the reasons why I no longer wanted him in my life were still there - if not even stronger. He was still blaming me for all-sorts, too extroverted (which he never was until around the age of 16) and incredibly self-centered. We did meet up for a few months following this, but the meet-ups quickly become less frequent following that and now, I don't think I've seen him for around two years. Maybe a little more.

Firstly, I'll act in a similar nature to a 'statue'. I'll be largely mute and won't move that much. This is the state I find myself in at the moment... Just keeping my head down, having to ignore everything going on around me the best I can. 

Alternatively, I'll be a chatterbox but this is when I usually open myself wide open to the usual criticisms of ""*not taking a breath whilst talking*"", accused of talking too quickly, accused of being wrong and often stuttering words if I've not predicted the direction of the conversation correctly. 

It's usually because of the second reason is why I often revert to acting like the first. It's just how day-to-day life is for me, really."
depression,fdd8xqg,t3_ekfp0m,1578300277.0,"I'm really enjoying my sleep again at the moment - and that's not usually a good sign with regards to depression. 

I spent a lot of the Christmas period asleep or dozing during the day. So much so that I'm into my third day back at work, amongst people who generally ignore or loathe me, and I'm still struggling to adjust getting back into the swing of staying awake all day."
FA30plus,fcxidfv,t3_eizfe6,1578063681.0,"The short answer is basically - 'survive'. The same as any other year, really.

I suppose if I had to have a goal, it would be to perhaps lose a bit of weight. I lost quite a bit a few years ago but I appear to have gone half way back to what I was. Especially over the last seven or eight months. 

Any other goals I have and have tried in the past are simply beyond my own capability. I no longer wish to frustrate or upset myself any more than I already am."
IncelExit,fcxh5y5,t3_ej3hzp,1578062817.0,"From my experience, it makes no difference. 

Barring a period of a few months (as I was made redundant), I've been in full-time employment for approaching 19 years. 

I've never made 'good' money and until the last 18 months or so have been on or close to the minimum wage (here in the UK). I don't have a 'fancy' job title although now I'm earning what's a reasonable amount for the title I have. 

There's several factors I feel it's down to and have discussed them at length in the past. Keeping it on topic, one of the reasons could be down to the fact that I do lack that high-profile job title. I'm not considered important or 'worthy' perhaps..."

A classic!"
britishproblems,fcuc2fe,t3_eiv33u,1577977479.0,"Fortunately the majority of our documents at work are printed and they're already date-stamped by the computer which is making things easier. 

If it wasn't for that, it would be more like the first quarter of the year I'd be doing this!"
FA30plus,fcu9dxb,t3_eiefno,1577975651.0,"Firstly, a Happy New Year to yourself and everyone else who has contributed to this thread. I wish you all well for the year ahead. 

I can confirm that I was in bed by around 10:40pm on New Year's Eve and was just beginning to doze off when the usual fireworks kicked off outside. In previous years I've done similar or watched the new year in on TV. 

It's one of the most anxiety-inducing and depression-raising times of the year for myself and no doubt many others here. I loathe New Year and have done for around half my lifetime now, I'd say. 

New Year? So what...? New Decade? ""*Meh*"", I'd say. Nothing ever changes. One day is very similar to the next and they all roll into one for me. The only difference is that I'm a year closer to shuffling off this mortal coil. Another year (and decade) of worry and facing the same old problems which are never resolved."
FA30plus,fcu8dzu,t3_eisj6w,1577974981.0,"The standard 'Forever Alone' reddit is much more active, but indeed, is largely filled with nothing more than classic teenage angst. Whilst I'm sure we can understand the frustrations, they do genuinely have time on their side. Unfortunately, they will have to wait until the second half of their twenties to really appreciate what we mean by that. 

Unfortunately, there's very few out there for the likes of ourselves which escape the 'darker' side of inceldom, memes and the same use of tedious phrases. 

There are a few forums out there (not directly incel-related, but have boards for life-long single people) but unfortunately, the moderators certainly don't like these problems being discussed. Ironic really - given one such forum is heavily focused on depression, wanting people to open up... This was certainly the case up to a few years ago."
depression,fctz146,t3_eiqkvo,1577966524.0,"I turn 35 this year and to think I've been alive for five decades is a genuinely sobering thought. 

In 2010, I already knew I was facing social issues and I knew it would be a real struggle for me to find romance in my life. At that point, I was probably just at the correct side of the 'tipping point'. By that, I mean where I probably still had some sort of chance if not only I pushed myself (difficult with Social Anxiety and Depression) but found a woman in her early/mid twenties willing to date a dateless, virgin man. 

Fast forward to 2020 and those hopes have long since diminished, I'm afraid to say. Nothing changed or progressed for me during the entire decade. I'm just a joke to people who know me and that's regardless of what I've done in recent years. 

I'd love to have all these 'lost' years back (which to be fair can take me back to pretty much the turn of the century) and it's at this time of year where these thoughts are very strong indeed."
britishproblems,fbujh54,t3_eeiz9l,1577115454.0,"It's like our place...

We've had to come in today - for one day. Since about 11am there has been virtually nothing to do. What's been done was just Friday's backlog. Deliveries have dried up, there's been two phone calls all day and the small trickle of orders that have come in all have completion dates in the second half of January... 

We currently have one van out on the road with six different deliveries to make. He's currently on his way back, having been out since 7:30am this morning and only being able to complete *ONE* of those deliveries. Everywhere else is closed. This could have been discovered if the boss had waited for the likes of us to come in to call to inquire first - rather than sending out the driver early. 

Fortunately I booked off the 27th and 30th last year (the two days we're open in-between this year) but having worked previous 'in-between' Christmas/New year periods over the years, it's at least as quiet as it has been today. You find yourself literally one of about six businesses out of hundreds in the industry that's open.  It costs more to open than it does to give staff a proper Christmas break which no doubt they'd respect more. 

It's time for mandatory Christmas shutdowns I think... Many bosses really do take the absolute mick at this time of year with regards to their staff. You work to live, not live to work."
