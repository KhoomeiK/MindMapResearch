No it means other countries won't go to war with us unless we attack them directly.  How was that unclear?"
facepalm,fd4bair,t1_fd48ewl,1578166035.0,You accuse me of bragging for stating a fact then tell me you're just agreeing with me.  What are you talking about?
facepalm,fd46r0l,t1_fd1szqu,1578164923.0,"Or it's just a fact to support the idea that no other super power is going to go to war with us unless we attack them.

AdviceAnimals,fczjn3t,t1_fcy3m7q,1578102687.0,Because you have to be crazy to think this is going to lead to anything like a world war.  The guy wanted to kill Americans.  You can question the methods that we used to kill him but if someone doesn't like us for killing someone like that then they didn't like us in the first place.
