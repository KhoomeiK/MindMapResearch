suggestmeabook,ffukta2,t3_ev4f8v,1580244062.0,"Michael Chabon has written many wonderful books. But I keep coming back to his first two. They are beautiful, funny and very human and real.

The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is his first novel. Should you enjoy it, definitely skip the awful movie.

Wonder Boys is his second novel. Whether you ultimately love the book or not, the movie with Michael Douglas is wonderful.

Good luck as you work to heal. I definitely know that getting and staying healthy is the hardest and most profoundly productive work I will ever and continue to do."
