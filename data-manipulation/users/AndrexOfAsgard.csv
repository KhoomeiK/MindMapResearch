The only real major difference between their rating system and the ESRB is the use of numbers instead of letters.

People who claim men and women perform equally across the board are the equivalent of Flat Earthers. Men and women are designed evolutionarily to perform different tasks from each other. Anyone who thinks otherwise should retake high school biology.

The company sucks for constraining the job opening to only allow women. Kinda sexist. 

You suck because you phrased your recommendation in a way that made it sound like absolutely no woman could do that job, even if that’s not what you really meant.

Two sides of the same sexist coin, everyone sucks here."

If a person is a respectful tourist, they’d say something along the lines of “do you speak ‘x language?’ Anyone who isn’t just visiting has no excuse to not be able to speak English. With the length of time it takes to go through the *legal* immigration system, one should have plenty of time to at least reach some form of basic conversational fluency in English before they immigrate."

Asian Giant Hornets (wasps, hornets, same thing) will absolutely ravage nests of honeybees, killing hundreds in a few minutes. Japanese honeybees don’t have stingers, so they developed a way to combat these giant flying a**holes. Turns out these honeybees can survive at a slightly higher temperature than the hornets, so a cluster will surround them and furiously beat their wings to heat up the air to a temperature high enough to kill the hornet, but not the bees."
