> The detainment or restraint of a person or thing for the purposes of determining legal rights as regards a thing, or suspicion of criminal activity as regards a person.

> These words were adopted in Canada in R v Whitfield (1970).

Looks like restraint and suspicion of a crime is sufficient to count as arrested."

Your idea is the same as saying that everyone that plays football gets to play in one league, and everyone that boxes will box in one league, and everyone that plays chess will play with everyone else. Age doesn't matter. Ability doesn't matter. Gender doesn't matter. We'll just throw them all into one colossal round robin and sort out the winner through ""true equality"".

Don't be daft."

Option 1: No murdering the other guy.

Outcome: I didn't murder him! I accidentally choked him to death!

Option 2: If the other guy dies, he wins, you lose.

Outcome: . . . dammit!"

For example, in the Dravanian Forelands, there is a river called the Whilom River.

Whilom is a word. It means ""former"", implying that the river used to be much bigger.

Maybe it's a common word somewhere else and people recognize it, but that's the first time I had ever seen it in the wild."
