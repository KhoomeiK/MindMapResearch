WeightLossAdvice,ff3dgk6,t3_erfli2,1579538905.0,"A lot of that is water weight if that's how much you're drinking so you probably have lost some weight. Also, you should be so proud of your diet and exercise! You really wanna go back to eating junk and sitting around? Maybe you need to switch up your exercise routine. Try strength training (which is very possible at your size). Start heavy lifting to get your legs and upper body in shape, and soon running and cardio will be a lot easier. 

Dont give up."

TooAfraidToAsk,ff3bvtr,t3_erfhp1,1579538113.0,"No, I dont think that makes you a bad person. You know what might be a great option for her? Let her be a  outside cat and let her eat and drink at your house. I moved out of the city and my indoor cat became an outdoor cat. She used to scratch and bite and be kinda indifferent to us, but ever since she got to be outdoors she cuddled and purs and never scratched or bites unless I'm playing with her. Maybe you live in an apartment so it's difficult with a cat but if you're in a house, it works great. And the cat won't get lost because you feed it, but it wont be in your space as much and can live a very happy life"

WeightLossAdvice,ff3avn3,t3_erfdt4,1579537608.0,"Weight training is a great way to lose far because you will strengthen+tone your muscles which will make you appear thinner off the bat, plus it will be easier to run and do other cardio activities because you'll be in better shape, thus lose weight easier. 

Weight lifting is also fun! I'd start with bench press, curls squats, and calf raises, then get into more advanced when you're comfortable."

PublicFreakout,ff38b7v,t1_ff36luo,1579536065.0,I dont think he was trying to purposely kill him. They're kids not professional athletes. I wrestled and played football and teenagers love to hurt eachother. It's why they play the sport. So obviously they're gonna break the rules so they can hurt eachother when they feud on the mat or field. And yeah he should totally be ejected but I'm sure the kid who got slammed on his neck has slammed other people on their necks. That's wrastling baby

TooAfraidToAsk,fe05x53,t3_eniuxc,1578803855.0,"Most high I've ever been: first time I hit a bong. My vision was a little crossed after ripping it, but I got adjusted and could walk and see fine. My brain was fucked though in the sense i had no idea what to do with how high i was. 

Most drunk I've been: I drank a ton of rum and could barely walk straight. My vision was crossed and I was tumbling over everywhere. I went up on my wet roof for no fucking reason other then I was really drunk and was. Idk what I was thinking at the time but probably some drunken nonsense. I threw up and felt sick the next day.

Getting high is awesome and you'd be suprised how many people are high doing day-to-day things. It's a great way to relax and socialize.

Getting drunk is fun as long as you keep your wits. Definetly shouldnt be an every day thing but nothing wrong polishing off a few drinks with ur buds."
