todayilearned,ffnezd6,t3_eu5wt2,1580065111.0,"People bitch about privacy all the time (rightfully so) ... so what do big corporate office businesses do- open concept offices which destroys workers privacy, aka trust.

It’s a terrible concept - company I work for went to smaller private cubicles to more open.  We are currently reverting back to smaller private cubicles because most our business isn’t doing well.  Imagine that."

PS4,ff36doa,t3_erakws,1579534767.0,It’s a great looking game especially on Pro.  Some of PS4’s best games on Pro really still hold up very well to powerful modern PCs.  Take this game or Uncharted 4 - it doesn’t get much better in terms of graphic fidelity.  Sure they aren’t native 4K but they are great looking games that play well.

gadgets,feuit10,t1_fesfr26,1579386887.0,"If you can guarentee 100 million sales (bull) vs what single individual pc consumers buy .. yes you can get some very high end products cheaply especially after consumers on pc already over bought the first flight of units on pc.

I own both console and pc I don’t care.  I like ps4 exclusives and the Pro’s image quality while not native 4K still looks brilliant.  I think the PS5 will have some very impressive looking games that’ll rival the best pc games we see.  The best PC games now really aren’t too different from what we see on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro."

Great job with OC it shows the rate and how hot nicely!"

PS4,fe92v9t,t1_fe8v46n,1578933611.0,What’s the physics system capabilities because while a lot of these creations look quite impressive then the gameplay physics looks like from ps1 and floaty.   Is it lack of implementation or just limits of Dreams?  I feel like in full game development the physics engine usually is what crushes the computational power hence why I haven’t seen a Dream creation with somewhat great physics.  Maybe it’s just what’s not being shared

PS4,fdmkb9l,t3_em1rbl,1578553092.0,"People who want backwards compatibility all the way back to ps1/ps2 .. go try to play those games, they’re all complete shit sorry.  I get it there are classics but most have crap resolution crap graphics and outdated gameplay / controls that are clunky.  Even ps3 games feel like that.

That said I need ps4 backwards compatibility if I’m a ps5 early adopter otherwise I can wait."
