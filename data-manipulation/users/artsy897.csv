wholesomememes,ffyzx3a,t1_ffxr6oc,1580359592.0,"My therapist says and I agree with it, is that there was a moment in time when you were constantly berated that you began to believe and agree with what was being said about you.  You took it in and it was all lies.
So now you have to find out the truth about your worth and begin to believe it.
You have to learn to reject the lies as they come up.
And that can take a professional helping you recognize the untruths that you believe with all your heart and hold onto today that are causing you pain and trouble.
30 is a great time to start getting help!"

You will begin to gain ground.
Go talk to someone before it becomes a bigger problem.
It’s not weak to ask for help it’s brave and courageous! 
It’s scary but it helps a lot!
If the first person doesn’t help keep looking until someone listens and what they say helps!
You are worth it...big time!"
wholesomememes,ffywrma,t1_ffxvqae,1580357093.0,"I certainly understand your feelings. I’ve had a lot of those same ones. It is a big wall you build around you when from a young age you have been on your own to survive.
Not everyone understands it because they can’t.
To have no one at a young age puts terror in your spirit.

But...the ideas about yourself you come up with to explain why no one wants you are lies.
It’s not because you are defective, it is because those appointed to watch over you are defective! ( a lot of time it is generational)
You are worthy of great love and being cared about.
You were always worthy.

To get better you have to exchange those lies for truth.
And if the damage is deep enough you need help to do that and you need the right therapist to help you get past all of it at your own speed.

I must say that the love that comes out of this place for complete strangers is amazing!
You guys are great people!"

Love yourself as you would a wife or child....

Do it sooner than later...those that love you will still be there."
AskReddit,ffwlgwp,t1_ffwbeq5,1580304700.0,"Yes that’s not right. I’ve been in therapy for 3 years and I get frustrated with myself because I take it so slow but she never says a word and tells me ways she can see growth in me. And I can verify that with my own feelings.

I have grown and feel stronger but some things take time for different people.

I tried 4 different therapists before I found this one.

But there has become a trend in the US to bash parents.
Sometimes I think the most privileged young adult children do this and that is wrong to me.
