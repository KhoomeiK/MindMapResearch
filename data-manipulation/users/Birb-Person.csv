Karl’s brother eventually died from what is assumed natural causes, resulting in the French being unified under Karl. Karl then invaded Central Europe, Italy, and Iberia, along the way slaughtering the pagan Saxons and the previous protectors of the papal state, the Kingdom of Lombardy. The Pope then brought Karl to Rome for Christmas on the year 800 and crowned him the leader of the new western Roman Empire , aka the Holy Roman Empire. (some historians refer to this as the Karling or Charlemange empire instead and use the 2nd founding of the HRE as the official starting point). The title of the HRE eventually fell to Italian nobles who fought for it until the death of the last claimant and the empire itself in 924. The empire was brought back by the German king, Otto I in 962. This has been your requested history lesson over the Charlemagne empire."
