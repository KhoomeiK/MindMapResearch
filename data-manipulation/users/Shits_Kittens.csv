Ok. 

Well, how about instead of complaining about someone else‘s work, why don’t you go ahead and download the same program to make it the “right” way. 

We’ll wait."

But fr, NJ is a beautiful state, great food, great beaches, and contrary to popular belief, some pretty great people. We honestly don’t care that our state gets shit on, because those of us from NJ know what we’ve got and it’s not on us to convince everyone else how great it is. If people want to base their opinion on a running joke in movies/tv, have at it, we’re good without ya."

funhaus,fek8ypz,t3_epgycv,1579195089.0,"I’d like to add that their editing is great! I can’t always tell, usually it’s a voiceover that gives it away, but it brings me back to the older content that had more “where tf did that come from” type edits tossed in that are strangely and perfectly hilarious."

AmItheAsshole,fedl2c5,t3_eogn3v,1579014181.0,"OP, you’re still getting the short end of the stick here. While I’m sure you’re happy about the 10k, this is still horse shit. You’re never going to forget this situation and the blatant favoritism displayed is going to cause (I’m sure it has already) some very warranted resentment that’s only going to grow with every moment they show even the slightest bit of favoritism for her. You’re probably already looking back to see if this has been happening all along. The good feelings you’ve got right now over a semi-solution by your parents is going to fade pretty quickly. Probably every time you see your sister in her brand new car. If it’s not obvious, my response comes from a place of understanding, and I truly am sorry you’re going through this. You really need to sit down with your parents and have a talk about why they felt justified in buying her a new car and you a phone case... hell, link them to your original post so they can see what the internet thinks. That way if they try to tell you you’re being ridiculous, you’ve got thousands of others who say different. Is it the most mature solution? Probably not, but having some backup couldn’t hurt. Remind them reddit is anonymous,  should they try to deflect with anger about strangers knowing how shitty they played you. Best of luck, OP. If you ever have a conversation with them, come back and tell us how it went."
