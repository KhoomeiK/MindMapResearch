> “I was saying that anyone who **needs** to read Ancient or Classical literature, i.e uneducated or ignorant people, just won’t.

Now, note that emphasis. Who would you qualify as being anyone who needs to read Classical Lit? It’s only logical to assume you actually meant anyone who has yet to read it, rather than anyone who *must*, because that was the topic of the conversation you dropped into. Please correct me if I’m wrong here and you actually think people have a biological need to read.

Moving right along with that operational definition, your use of in et is transparent about your true thoughts, though I guess putting extraneous words between your subject and  its appositive confused you. “ **anyone who has yet to read** Ancient or Classical Lit, **that is, *uneducated or ignorant people...***”
People who have yet to read the arbitrary literature you’ve chosen are  therefore uneducated or ignorant. Really wasn’t much of a logic puzzle, surprised it stumped such an intelligent genius

worldpolitics,fdzxat8,t1_fdzwe6f,1578798055.0,"Hey, so I think a lot of the problem that leads our friend to believe you’re on the spectrum is that you are taking a very egocentric approach to parenthood. I don’t want that to sound combative, but there are social cues relating to pretty basic decency that you’re not picking up on, and the spectrum is the first place people tend to go when they see that behavior.

It’s great that (presumably) parenthood has made you happy, and I certainly hope it’s made parents across the world happy. But it’s not okay to force what makes you happy upon others by criticizing those who choose not to have children, because these things aren’t universal. What makes you happy will not make everybody happy, and pressuring somebody into a situation that would make them unhappy because it fits your perception of a correct or wise life is not an appropriate thing to do. I should also add it’s certainly not fair to the child, to be raised by a parent who didn’t want them. Can’t imagine that’s a good life to live."

FuckYouKaren,fdyjvpg,t1_fdyegq0,1578780598.0,"Did. Did you just ask what feminists are fighting against? In the wake of the #MeToo movement? Or was that not feminism by some stretch of your imagination? I quite like:

>“There is no laws that say the sexes should be ''treated'' differently. If they are it is societal and just how humans behave. “

Because it insinuates a couple possibilities: 

1) you don’t think the genders are treated differently, which contradicts your earlier points about men’s inequality.

Or

2) you *do* think the genders are treated differently, which must be illegal if you also believe the law leaves no room for discrimination by sex, but that’s just human nature

It’s also rich that you complain that I saw through the feminist strawman you’ve built up for yourself and “didn’t make any good points” when I not only provided examples of feminism tackling men’s rights, but outright explained to you the egalitarian nature of the movement. Combine that with your idea that somehow having a law written ensuring equal rights is the end of a movement (Civil Rights activists in the 50’s and 60’s should have stayed home, the 14th Amendment had existed for almost a century), and you’re making a real good case for being the misunderstood centrist who lefties just relentlessly bully. Definitely not just utterly misguided, no siree"

Someone without knowledge of music theory probably wouldn’t have been able to write something both as unorthodox *and* entertaining, not because he was exhibiting theory’s principles but because he purposely and carefully went against them. I’m all for experimenting with and expanding music, but part of that is understanding what we already know."

FuckYouKaren,fdy8id5,t1_fdxg0p9,1578777178.0,"Fighting for equality between two groups is not an example of class divide, fighting to preserve such a divide is. Furthermore the “feminists don’t focus on men” drivel is tired; not only is this some serious selective memory ( *Craig v. Bore* was initiated by feminists to overturn a drinking age law favoring women; rape was only legally defined in a way that included men after feminist appeals to Director Robert Mueller in 2012), it’s a deliberate misinterpretation of a movement for equality between the sexes in the vein of “All Lives Matter” counterpoints. You’re right that men are treated in an unequal way, and feminism also aims to put an end to that by enforcing equal treatment regardless of sex. The reason you see more focus on women’s issues is that there are more of them to focus on, it’s irresponsible to ignore the fact that feminism has and does advocate for men. 

You can keep repeating that feminists are forcing this perceived “equal outcome” that you fear so terribly, but the basic truth is that you’ve developed an incorrect view of *what* feminism is and stands for. Which honestly explains a lot about your first paragraph; you are so certain that you’re correct in your perception of the feminist movement that even after you’ve been told where the error lies in that, you continue to use it. I doubt this will actually affect how you perceive the feminist movement, since no one else has, but now you can’t say someone hasn’t explicitly explained how you’re wrong."

One person’s orange room could reveal an omen of death, perhaps hinting to something they’re anxious about; while another may find nothing at all, maybe on account of feeling shortchanged in a recent deal. Much like dream interpretation, DTYM is very subjective. But the fact that you’re asking about it means it was likely significant at least.

How did the door make you feel? Do you have any particular feelings about orange or orange things? Was your instinct to open it or turn away? Did you notice the color of other doors or did this stand out to you in particular? If you did open the door, what was inside?
