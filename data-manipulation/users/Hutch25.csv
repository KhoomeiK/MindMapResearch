We used cold water on it so it loosened its grip and we took it off and put it back in its enclosure. I’m not quite sure what it was doing but we had to make sure it’s blood got back to temperature after the water. I’m not sure what it was doing, it would wrap around his arm sometimes and be completely fine and just chill there not harming him but I’m not sure what the snake was doing cause it just wrapped around his neck and it tightened its grip pretty tight. I’m sure it was trying to just sit there on his shoulder and it needed a place to grip onto. Scary scary time, the thing is, is that this snake was super nice to everyone still is in fact as he still has it. But we did teach it not to do that again."

aww,fef1493,t1_fee9jd0,1579045711.0,"I’m not adopted myself but I do know there is a positive way to look at adoption. Basically most people who would adopt get to chose the baby or child they wanted and u happened to be the one it shows ur worth something and u can do something in ur future, it shows that ur now parents are gonna love u and care for u till the end of time cause ur their child now no matter if u share a bloodline or not. Being adopted and being born into a family isn’t much different ur there for the same reason and ur parents love u the same. That rumour probably comes from people who didn’t take the ur adopted talk very lightly. Such a shame adoption has such a bad name yet it’s such an amazing thing. Adoption gives the chance for less fortunate parents to get themselves back together and give their child a better home. The decision isn’t always easy but once it’d done its done"
