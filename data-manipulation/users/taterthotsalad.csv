aww,fepqasf,t1_fepoqib,1579327711.0,"Correct. Many people are still not aware that a pit bull is a generalized term for several breeds of canines. I have a Staffy and immediately saw the traits, although this one does look to be less than full, but still, what a great breed Staffies are!

intel,fe6xu4z,t1_fe6tqzj,1578907496.0,"Is it? They occur all the time to reinvent, reprioritize and change the current roadmap to favor stability instead of the current status quo, which is not working. A shakeup at the top trickles down to all departments and teams.  The point is status quo is chaos, so a reaction to that is a stabilizer, or at least an attempt to do so."
intel,fe50xy9,t3_ensrgk,1578864640.0,"I cant tell if the current issue for Intel is one of panic, management politics, marketing flood gates being opened to save the ship and market share, or all of the above. One thing is certain, a management shakeup at the highest levels is warranted right now to stabilize things. Doing so will change the thinking and future road map in a positive way for everyone, including consumers of all sizes."

Spokane,fd5nkbz,t1_fd594l9,1578179409.0,"One of the things I hate about the process is that if it is stolen and recovered you will get burned twice. Once, by being violated by the theft, and then again by having to pay to release it from impound. Now here is an unpopular takeaway for this situation. Its almost as if the victim is not respected or cared about by our government. Tragic really."
security,fczxy3e,t1_fczdczi,1578110540.0,I felt the same way reading this. The language is very different from other companies that have gone through this. I would not at all be surprised that they are quietly shifting money and assets so when the time comes it looks like they have less to liquidate if it goes to court. It smells of shit.

They can either submit less than helpful tickets or they can learn now and understand the process and how to help be part of the solutions. It’s not like they wait for a damn SLA. Lol. Ask a kid to wait four hours to fix their game crash. I’d rather listen to ten hours of being Rick Rolled.
