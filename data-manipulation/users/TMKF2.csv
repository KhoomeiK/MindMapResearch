Of course, after proportional uproar they passed bills to implement changes but not in time for the subsequent election cycles. Civil rights violations and their remedies can be strategically timed to impact the outcomes of elections without significant adverse effects."
Michigan,ffzw2is,t1_ffzs83k,1580394396.0,"Correct. The plan is to start at the trailhead and go NE until we hit the NCT, then north for about six miles. Then, on day two to hit Silver Mountain and get situated a little further south of there in the afternoon. Then, river conditions permitting, head south along the Little Silver River. Then back East along the West Branch of Sidnaw Creek and on until we hit the gorge. From there, back out to the road and up to the vehicle. 29.9 miles.

politics,ffy35zs,t1_ffxvr6j,1580337669.0,"Auctioneers still have to document the transfers through FFLs and clear the buyer (thus the one sheet and the phone call). This admittedly was slightly more difficult than my voter registration, but I had to drive further to vote, and did incur the cost of having to renew my drivers' license early due to changing of the ID requirements. 

Private sales are a bigger disparity both in ease and in comparison. I can legally have a private seller that I met at the firing range or the sporting goods store or the bar deliver a firearm to my living room and pay cash for it without any paperwork or phone calls involved. If the firearm was made before 1968 it may not even have a serial number or any record of being made or transferred. 

The point I didn't effectively state is that there is a significant faction of powerful people actively working to make it more difficult to vote and those same people want to make it less difficult to possess and transfer firearms. They will argue a liberal interpretation of the 2nd amendment, but suddenly get very squishy about interpretation of the ""right to vote"" which is specifically mentioned five times in the U.S. Constitution."

The law puts the responsibility to ensure the validity of the relationship between the parties and their age onto the individual that carries the beverage operators license or the premises. Which means it's up to the bartender or the owner to determine if they want to take on that risk.  
At a restaurant where I worked we actually had a log where we recorded the guardian's name, DOB, and how we verified it (usually drivers license), the relationship, and the kid's name and DOB, then the date and our initials and had the customer sign. We didn't serve kids that often, but occasionally we'd have families come in for private parties like weddings or anniversaries or granny's 100th birthday, and being Wisconsin we'd occasionally have people that would insist that we serve kids champagne, wine, or straight up bar drinks. 

Depending on the bartender, they'd either just serve the guests anyway, or if they felt weird about it, they'd pull out the log book and ask for an ID and a signature from the ""guardian"".  Usually at that point, people that weren't very interested in being responsible for getting a kid a drink would opt to get them a kiddie cocktail or something elese."
wisconsin,ffxovkg,t1_ffuwh7o,1580329500.0,"""they are just as politically gerrymandered"". I'd like to see some proof of that. Everything in published data science shows that there are relatively simple modifications to the algorithms that eliminate bunching bias, and very few of the algorithmic models produce only one plan. Most of them produce several plans that can then be tested and reviewed for bias. 

Conversely, if we've learned anything from REDMAP, it's that algorithmically districting to maximize bias is possible. So it is nearly a mathematical certainty that an algorithm that minimizes partisan bias is also possible."

When I called them to get it fixed, they said that because I bought (ordered and paid for it) it at a store several hours from our house, they couldn’t let us get it serviced through the store three miles from our house.
