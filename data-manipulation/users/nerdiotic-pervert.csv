Chihuahua,fdfe9j6,t3_ekxy8u,1578359653.0,"My little guy did the same thing when I first adopted him. Took him to the vet and they x-rayed him. Turned out he was just full of poop. 

He was anxious from being new to the home and wasn’t going full potty. And, I was getting used to portion size for such a little dog so slightly over feeding him. 

Vet just said to not feed him for 48 hours and it fixed itself. He got more comfortable here and I have the feeding down pat. I hope it’s something as benign as my problem.

Edit: he would yelp and a reach if I tried to pick him up. And he would try to bite at my hands. It seemed like he was in terrible pain. Just giving a description of how he was acting so you can have a frame of reference to compare to your situation."

Vile, mean, those your your words to me. If I had realized I was speaking to a minor this whole time I probably would have used better language. (I called you a POS but that was more of a ESH moment.) I need to remember what sub in.  You win buddy, you think    this hijab is sickening because it’s goofy. Cool opinion (insert eye roll).

All I said was, LITERALLY,  “You need to explain yourself homie”. I never once made any accusations. I made that comment because OC had already gotten like 50 downvotes and I wanted to know where the word “sickening” came from. Did it come from a place of racism or just personal style. I needed to know why I should downvote this comment. That’s all. Please tell me how I jumped down OC’s throat."
