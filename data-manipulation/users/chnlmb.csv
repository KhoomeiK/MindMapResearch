thanksimcured,ffg0g5b,t1_fffhtuw,1579895779.0,And you are :)
AmItheAsshole,fffypku,t1_fffry2g,1579894709.0,And again not everyone has $500 dollars and people living paycheck to paycheck (as most college students without rich parents are) aren’t going to be able to save that up. Why are you acting like $500 is a trivial amount of money
AmItheAsshole,fffmeyy,t1_fffm5ak,1579887097.0,But in this specific case there were only two so I’m not seeing the relevance of this
AmItheAsshole,fffevdj,t1_fffepbi,1579882442.0,It’s low relatively but not everyone has $500 to throw around. And especially not most college students.
AmItheAsshole,fffe7di,t1_fff9c1e,1579882015.0,For the small price of $300-500 dollars! Come on don’t be ridiculous like those glasses are some easily accessible thing that people can use.
AmItheAsshole,fffdnky,t1_ffeu1qg,1579881662.0,It’s not necessarily. Some people don’t go to a doctor regularly or have one they can just see for a note. Also some schools have more difficult processes. To get accommodations for my ADHD I would’ve had to 1. Find a doctor because I haven’t had one since we moved 2. Convince this doctor that I do have ADHD since after years of dealing with it I’m relatively well function and then 3. Come back to our SOAR office and make the case that I need accommodations. But back on topic it would’ve caused the professor absolutely no inconvenience to use different markers so it’s not really necessary.
bodymods,ffed4q5,t3_et1fs3,1579843676.0,Vertical helix if you’re into that because you’ve got lots of cartalidge on top and I’m sure you could do something interesting with it. Like maybe two vertical helixes with a chain in between them when healed? Get creative
AmItheAsshole,ffdv179,t1_ffdglkq,1579829625.0,Yeah gonna have to disagree with you that OP should go through an entire school exam and paperwork just so that a prof will (at no personal inconvenience might I add) change marker colors.
AmItheAsshole,ffc2phq,t1_ffaroqn,1579790055.0,To be fair 20k is a whole world of different from 4K.
trashy,ffa1col,t1_ff9lft6,1579725908.0,That’s why they run credit checks. Most new graduates are likely to have good to decent credit because they haven’t started making payments / have been making their payments on time. Also 100k credit card debt is a whole world of difference from 100k student loan debt.
unpopularopinion,ff9w1gm,t1_ff9liez,1579722749.0,Counter-point: what does this have to do with the anecdote about a person being fat shamed for no reason.
AmItheAsshole,ff6xvv1,t1_ff6muko,1579637141.0,It was a month and they didn’t have sex but okay
AmItheAsshole,ff6xu3s,t1_ff6mdgn,1579637112.0,She literally told him before they had sex. He has no reason to believe that she wouldn’t tell another person before they have sex. OP is the asshole
AmItheAsshole,ff6fmv7,t1_ff3dji7,1579626154.0,She didn’t know that the dad forbade it tho
piercing,fewlffo,t3_eqrmfb,1579413566.0,Honestly I would recommend getting pierced with a seamless ring/changing to a seamless ring as soon as safely possible because mine didn’t really heal with a horseshoe simply because horseshoes are too prone to movement however overall it was very easy to heal because generally you can sleep on it and it’s easy to clean. Mine had no major complications. I had irritation bumps for a few months but then they went away when I used the seamless ring.
AmItheAsshole,fenaw0l,t1_felwv2d,1579280753.0,Bro no one is an asshole for deciding to drop out college isn’t for anyone. And they’re bf/gf not wife and husband. OP isn’t on the line for anything .
Jarrariums,felb742,t3_epi3sl,1579218091.0,Is that a SOP or SOT? Either way he looks pretty
college,felakvj,t1_fekwzn6,1579217687.0,Literally no where did they say it’s a loan. You can get more financial aid then you need and get a refund for it. Next year I’ll be working as an RA which will end up giving me around a 5k refund check.
college,felahic,t1_fel1eue,1579217628.0,FASFA does not mean that you take out a student loan. FASFA also gives out pell grants.
college,fel8e82,t3_epqken,1579216287.0,I would say get a roommate for the experience of having to live with a person in harmony but I would recommend suite style living if cost isn’t too much of a factor. At my school at least though the price difference between community and suite style living isn’t high enough for me to give up the privacy and cleanliness of having your own bathroom.
college,fel7i7a,t1_fel77er,1579215727.0,Totally! And if you find it doesn’t suite your needs most colleges have so many things to try out that you couldn’t do it all in four years if you wanted to so I’m confident that you’ll find something you like and best of luck in that search!
college,fel6yd3,t3_eppijq,1579215384.0,"Honestly you need to find a cheap easy non-time consuming hobby and maybe a club or two. I personally just found friendship bracelet making (highly recommend and there is a wealth of knowledge out there) and it’s super fun and I can pick it up or put it down at any point. My roommate enjoys watching a movie before bed when she’s done with her readings. A good college hobby will help you a lot when you feel like you’re just wasting time and help provide you will good stimulation at these times. Then also join a club that you’re really interested in and no matter what it is, if you’re passionate about it it’ll be fun. I personally joined a bible club at my school and it’s fantastic and about 2-3 hours a week. So it’s not too much but in the middle of a stressful week I can sit down and chill with likeminded people. Or even if you find an on campus job that may be fun like the library or the gym

TLDR; Staying not bored is a mixture of finding a hobby and maybe a club or a job that you really enjoy. It’s up to you to decide to pick something up to fill extra time if you find yourself depressingly bored."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fejrr7k,t1_fej8ols,1579184219.0,Yeahs just a quick read https://www.verywellfamily.com/can-an-ectopic-pregnancy-be-saved-2371464 that says that the average chances of a viable ectopic pregnancy are about 1 in 3million. So yeah very low but possible. I remember watching this strange pregnancies series and it featured a woman who went through with a successful ectopic pregnancy. Very interesting precarious situation
ShitMomGroupsSay,feiz111,t1_fedwpeo,1579151244.0,Actually a very small percentage of ectopic pregnancies  can be viable with diligent monitoring and if they’re in the right (or rightest wrong) place
unpopularopinion,fef5qrz,t3_eop98k,1579048820.0,It’s fucking reddit dude go outside talk to a person
AmItheAsshole,feck20h,t1_fe9y3bw,1578975814.0,1. Not the asshole implied that the daughter is an asshole for wanting to meet her birth mom
iamatotalpieceofshit,fe5z3pn,t1_fe4u3fd,1578878154.0,With just the given context she didn’t scam anyone. Guy willingly bought her drinks hoping she’d sleep with him. She didn’t. No scams here just typical bar stuff.
AmItheAsshole,fe5jgss,t1_fe2zvk5,1578870192.0,So they should allow a child of color to be this couples experience for undoing their racism? No that doesn’t sound traumatic in any ways.
financialaid,fe593li,t3_entp4u,1578866703.0,Remindme! 2 days
AmItheAsshole,fe0l41v,t1_fdvlfwq,1578815359.0,Then whose the asshole?
AmItheAsshole,fe0g5e9,t1_fe0e2la,1578812877.0,They’re racists. They literally asked a white kid “where is your dark little friend”
AmItheAsshole,fdxcyz9,t1_fds38mm,1578767560.0,NTA implies that the wife is an asshole
Aquariums,fdx0q2j,t1_fdx030f,1578764164.0,Well he’s coming back to college with me so full water change lmao. Can’t get to any stores until Tuesday so if he doesn’t look better then I’m gonna get some antibiotics in case he got sick. But besides moving a little slower he seems relatively okay so maybe now that he’s in clean water he’ll perk up.
personalfinance,fdryd2u,t1_fdqp9zm,1578691550.0,A show bred chihuahua is pretty low maintenance. Sometimes you can find a real “ugly”(not show quality) one for relatively cheap and chihuahuas aren’t prone to too many issues. Most common issues are some have knee issues and a few develop epilepsy but most are healthy.
conservativecartoons,fdpvhmh,t3_em8pt4,1578642181.0,Bruh what the fuck are you talking about
irredeemables,fdpg9nc,t1_fcxd07e,1578627845.0,I’m surprised you didn’t get downvoted for stating facts
IdiotsInCars,fdmqu0d,t1_fdmqsyq,1578561254.0,On he’s definitely an idiot but the lady who was recklessly driving is also an idiot nonetheless
IdiotsInCars,fdmqreu,t1_fdmqqkz,1578561154.0,Idk going almost 70 on a 40 is pretty dumb.
Kanye,fdlf3iv,t1_fdk87py,1578522658.0,50 thousand on my head is disrespect
TheRightCantMeme,fdj8vag,t3_el064y,1578461806.0,This seems to imply the getting drafted is a right
AmItheAsshole,fdi3vuf,t1_fdi0tpm,1578435274.0,Not everyone does that though. Just shitty managers who can’t get times down organically. I worked at McDonald’s for 2 years and hardly any of my managers tried that shit. Not every pulled up car is the workers trying to artificially get times down. Sometimes in the morning things need to be pulled and cooked quite suddenly as you realize that there’s no more folded eggs left in the cooler or that you’ve used all the coffee thats stored up front and you gotta pull cars up while their shit is being made to keep the line moving.
AmItheAsshole,fdhz5fr,t1_fde7siy,1578432816.0,Bro you can literally click “hold” and it moves the order to a different part of the screen (what you’re supposed to do) you should never serve it off before an order has been handed and drives off.
