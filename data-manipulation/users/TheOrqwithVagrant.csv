Just to be clear, Sanders is my #1 choice, but *until* I saw the above proposal I was pretty annoyed about him calling himself a ""Democratic Socialist"" when all his policy is pretty solid SocDem stuff.

politics,fco7ecl,t1_fcnhipw,1577825510.0,"You're echoing the delusion the GOP itself seems stuck in. They're *absolutely* in trouble.

They lost two senate seats and six house seats the year Trump *won*.

They lost another senate seat in a special election in between elections. A special election in GA-6, which had gone 16%+ (R) in the 2016 election was almost lost, showing a 15%+ swing away from (R) after just a few months of Trump actually in office.

In 2018, that district along with another 40 previously republican districts went blue, getting the Democrats the House with a 36 seat majority. While the republicans did gain back 2 senate seats due to a senate election map that was exceptionally favorable to the GOP, that still doesn't actually restore the senate majority they used to have under Obama. Oh, and they lost 400+ local seats too. Know how republicans love to brag that they won 1500 or so local seats under 8 years of Obama - well, they lost 400 of those in a single election after just two years of Trump. 

So yeah, they're in trouble. Trump has actually been electoral poison for them from the very start. They've lashed themselves to an anchor that they're trying to turn into a lifebuoy by just *believing* hard enough."
asoiaf,fco5mc0,t1_fcnpjz3,1577824530.0,It's mind boggling to me the degree to which some people get hung up on that quote. It was just one item in a list of things he felt Tolkien glossed over when he made the 'blanket statement' that 'Aragorn ruled well'. It's literally next to the MUCH more interesting question of whether Aragorn pursued a policy of systematic genocide against the remaining Orcs as part of his 'good rule'. Yet people keep bitching about the mention of 'tax policy'. Each and every one of the people who do seem to have *utterly* failed to comprehend the point Martin was actually making.
