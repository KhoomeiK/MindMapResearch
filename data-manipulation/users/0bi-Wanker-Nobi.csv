watchthingsfly,ffbso1a,t1_ffb3dvb,1579781267.0,More than 1 at least
FortNiteBR,ffbkckj,t1_ffba7tt,1579769434.0,"Two fights was pretty unlucky, but my point is that if we had something like launchpads we could’ve avoided the fight altogether :)"
FortNiteBR,ffbjr9s,t1_ffb0y5b,1579768594.0,"I appreciate the advice until you went and attempted to insult me. Oh and if you’re going to comment on my intelligence, at least learn to spell first. *whine"
FortNiteBR,ffaomke,t1_ffalymn,1579740861.0,Actually the one person who gave me civil constructive criticism I acknowledged. I’m annoyed at epic for removing staple items from their game. Don’t accuse me of being salty when I’m simply pointing out a valid problem.
FortNiteBR,ffai8dd,t1_ffag8el,1579736346.0,Thank you for being civil. I agree there is some stuff we could’ve done better but what fun is it to have to play 100% perfect just to make it out of the gas? Just 1 launch pad could have saved our entire squad. ( also was no boats and a squad by risky river) :(
FortNiteBR,ffaha1o,t1_ffageth,1579735712.0,"Pushed by a squad near weeping river and boat by middle island was taken, I question people’s sanity when they think that one vehicle that can only go full speed on water is sufficient enough mobility for a map of this size."
FortNiteBR,ffagd24,t1_ffag464,1579735111.0,You’re really going to try and tell me that not having launch pads in the game has made it more enjoyable?
FortNiteBR,ffafh99,t1_ffafb4i,1579734513.0,"Will do man, I’ll just throw on my invisibility cloak and sneak past everyone on the way. It’s not that easy."
FortNiteBR,ffaeegk,t1_ffae2g7,1579733685.0,"No. We killed the squad, didn’t even take white health damage, but the delay it caused was what led to our demise. If they had something like launchpads in the game then we could have either avoided the fight altogether or got out after it."
FortNiteBR,ffadkh2,t1_ffaczy9,1579733040.0,"Disagree, we left as soon as we finished fighting. As I’ve said on multiple occasions we got pushed in zone trying to swim, in past seasons you could avoid situations like this because there was safe, reliable ways to get around the map. The river from Holly to centre Island flows upstream so wouldn’t have been beneficial and there was a squad next to the risky reels river. We weren’t the only ones running from zone. Please don’t try and defend epic’s poor development choices."
