WatchPeopleDieInside,fejoddz,t1_fejnv1i,1579181548.0,">Local businesses have disappeared and most companies just hire illegal immigrants they can exploit leaving Spanish citizens unemployed.

The best way to make sure workers aren't abused is to have worker protections that apply, regardless of legal status.

Otherwise, those with capital will simply find poorer people to exploit. For example, by moving production off-shore. Or literally just hiring new migrant workers once the old ones get deported. 

This is the way."

I'm always puzzled as to why energy in Kenya costs more than it does in the US. 

Why does Kenya embrace coal? Nuclear plants produce a fraction of the radioactive pollution that coal does. I am skeptical of this idea that Africans don't have the technical expertise to run a nuclear power plant."
