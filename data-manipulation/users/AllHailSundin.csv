I started a new job recently, and listened to audiobooks while working, but found it easy to get distracted while doing very basic work and trying to pay attention to the audiobooks. The narrators were also pretty awful (I know some are a lot better than others, and have heard Michael C. Hall narrates Pet Sematary. That's one I've read.) I don't think they're for me, but may give them another chance.

I bought most of Stephen King's books over the last couple of years, and was given others. I have new copies of a lot of them and should really put them to use. I ended up with multiples of some, as well, like IT which I have four copies of.

(My OCD makes me like to have perfect copies, and I had to ask for replacements. I also like to collect different editions.)

I hope your depression is better. I've been dealing with severe depression and suicidal ideation for 10 years, along with grief, OCD and anxiety. The OCD started when I was a kid. I've gotten lots of help and tried meds, but nothing helps much."
52book,ff7wxmc,t1_ff7wn2z,1579660312.0,"You might be right. I'm not sure when to read them, or if I even will this year.

To be honest, I've been putting them off for 2-3 years, because my mental health has affected my attention span. I want to get the most out of the books and not have my mind wandering. But it hasn't gotten a lot better with help, and while reading 117 books since the beginning of 2018.

My goal is to read all of King's stuff, and I've collected almost all of his books. I've only read about 13, but I did re-read Gwendy's Button Box and read Cycle of the Werewolf this week. Also read The Outsider, Elevation and The Institute when they came out.

I got the boxed set of The Dark Tower, but am wondering if I'll like it because I struggle with fantasy. I read the first book when I was 14, and found it kind of overwhelming, confusing and not that great. Just okay. I was a smart 14, but no matter how much I try with fantasy, it's difficult outside of video games."

I got more than half-way and really liked it. Still have the copy I borrowed from my friend, too, because he stopped talking to me because of my depression, but I left the slipcover at his place so it wouldn't get damaged and wish I hadn't since he didn't care about or want the book that he received as a gift. Also picked up the trade paperback for cheap. Gotta read it someday soon.

I've been to the town where they filmed the miniseries, and still have friends in the area. My one friend's cousin got hit on through Instagram by James Franco's bodyguard, who propositioned her for him after they'd met on the street."

I started getting glum, then my mom got sick, so I felt even worse. That was the perfect breeding ground for this terrible depression that still exists and torments me.

A guy gave me his when I offered to buy it, and I got another for $2-3 from the thrift store I volunteered at.
