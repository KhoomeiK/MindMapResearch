It’s a value system. People can have opposing values.

Some people don’t care about a specific issue and can just interact within, upon, or adopt someone else’s in a given situation.

Some types of ethics are Personal Ethics (what a person believes to be correct and good) and Legal Ethics (the expected standards for a legal proffessional) and Political Ethics (process for political action and judgment of policies and laws)

Functionally, it can be imposed upon you, in a legal sense, despite agreement contrariwise.

Ideally, politics would use sound arguments and agreements to determine what is “abuse” or “unfair”; instead of rhetoric.

To be personally unethical, you have to go against what you believe to be right, 
or, you don’t have a stance on a given subject but promote or fight against a certain side anyways."

technology,fe0y643,t1_fe0awb8,1578820180.0,"Yeah, but eventually companies and governments will be able to profile you based on what you talk about in private. And that’s on top of your comments on facebook, reddit, etc., as well as what websites and physical places you visit, and what you buy. So nearly your entire life could be scrutinized and broken down to data points that could be sold to anyone.

Luckily there is already privacy legislation coming through that is fighting against some of this."

Like maybe a focus on unlocking actual action-oriented abilities through the skill trees and/or trainers instead of just do 10% more damage.
