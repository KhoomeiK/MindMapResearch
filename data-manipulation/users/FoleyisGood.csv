Zero truth to this. I bring my dog with me to lessons (and class) all the time. She is calm and doesn't usually even look at other dogs. Great for work with reactive dogs. I use her as the demo dog too. Sometimes client dogs are too worked up. The client will practice with my dog instead so they can learn the mechanics and not get frustrated by their dog.  Then, once their dog has calmed down and in a better frame of mind to learn they can practice what they learned with my dog. 

She is great in class especially Orientation (owners dont bring their dogs). She calms down the owners of leash reactive dogs so they are more relaxed while I talk about class. I find this helps them pay attention and make them more comfortable to ask questions

This is very important as many people get into dog training thinking they don't have to work with people. I was one of them. Now I find it is one of the parts of the job I enjoy most"
Dogtraining,fdvjulk,t1_fdszhxq,1578748148.0,"> It is a great hobby, but not profitable as a career.

People really need to stop saying this. It totally can be profitable, especially if you have a niche that isn't easily filled in your area. I could branch out into 2 or 3 specialties in my area and make a good amount of money. 

Good trainers make good money. At first I thought nobody would pay $1000 for a training package, but they do. If you do not make good money either you are in an area with too much competition or you just aren't good enough (I know plenty of trainers that wonder why they don't get clients - they just aren't that good. I was one of them at the begining). 

That all being said this isn't a career for everyone. The pros need to outweigh the cons for you. Dealing with lousy clients, travel, traffic, last minute cancellations, expensive conferences to continue your education. The dogs can be a whole other story!"
tolkienfans,fdvfovy,t1_fdu28hv,1578746955.0,This is a good idea. I'm a big reader but I don't think I would have ever read LOTR and definitely not Silmarilion if I hadn't seen them movies first.
movies,fdrb3yi,t1_fdr9nh7,1578682003.0,"Fair point. I honestly haven't seen many of Will Smith's recent movies either. 

Keanu was pretty bad in Bill & Ted 2 :)"

I use it for work but I don't need anything heavy duty. I also take it when I travel for watching videos."
calvinandhobbes,fdr9at0,t3_emuh7y,1578681231.0,Have you read Calvin & Hobbes in English and Danish? If so what kind of differences do you notice?
movies,fdr8f1n,t1_fdr4vk8,1578680935.0,"I sorta agree. I don't know if I'd say Will is better than Keanu, but I think he may have been able to pull it off."
dogs,fdr7anb,t3_emtk6k,1578680500.0,"> I need help on this

No, she does. She is a danger to your dog and herself. And I say that out of concern. This is way more about her mental well-being  and she is taking it out on your dog. 

I won't be like everyone else here that says dump her (make your own decision about that) but she is the one in need of some counselling. She should also be staying with her mom until further notice."

From the sidebar: Unprotected directories of pics, vids, music, software and otherwise interesting files."

cordcutters,fdn6qya,t3_em9woa,1578578818.0,Did anyone actually call Verizon and discuss with them first?
HomeNetworking,fdlknx7,t1_fdljzxo,1578526176.0,Just an FYI I didn't need to call Verizon when I swapped routers. I just made sure I released the WAN IP before making the swap.
Dogtraining,fdkewzi,t1_fdjuhlf,1578502417.0,It happens. Unfortunately there are many people that think there is nothing wrong with a prong collar.
Dogtraining,fdkeqeh,t1_fdhj46n,1578502305.0,"Does your kids school have cameras to make sure teachers aren't smacking them around? What about at the doctor, band practice, baseball practice, church? Does your boss have cameras in their office to make sure nobody is acting inappropriately towards each other? 

Probably not. Yet we still go to these places. Tell me you aren't going to send your kid to a school because every room doesn't have a camera you can tune into whenever you want"
