Paranormal,ffpzm4y,t1_ffprtkl,1580112500.0,"Exactly. Plus you're more likely to capture ambiguous footage in the dark which can be interpreted as paranormal. Like OP said, it's mostly for show."
Paranormal,ffn55wb,t1_ffimxpt,1580062150.0,"It's been quite literally the most difficult experience of my entire life. Losing him destroyed me and destroyed my life. 

Idk what I believe honestly. I want it to be true so I can be with him again. Like if we had concrete evidence that there was life after death and that we get to be with our dead loved ones, i would've killed myself the night he died. But I guess we'll have to wait and see. 

The weird thing is, he knows what happens after death. The most pervasive question of humanity has been answered for him. It's weird to think about."
Paranormal,ffhsxr6,t1_fffwhmy,1579952271.0,But didn't you say he wasn't found until hours after his death? Wouldn't that imply he died with nobody around?
Paranormal,ffhsjnq,t1_ffhjnmt,1579951688.0,"Idk why you're being downvoted, this is absolutely true. And it shouldn't detract from your belief in the supernatural/paranormal. Seeing stuff like this, you should focus on debunking rather than proving. So if you *do* find something you can't explain, it stands out that much more."
Paranormal,ffhsgxc,t1_ffh613s,1579951574.0,"I see the same thing, leaning on the wall on the right side of the room. Eerie. Someone should run this through one of those programs that detects evidence that the picture was edited/photoshopped."
Paranormal,ffhscvs,t3_etocnl,1579951402.0,"I had a similar experience last night. I was chilling in bed with my cat and I heard a little girl giggle. I couldn't tell if it was in my room or outside the door, but it was in that area. My cat and I both looked up in that direction at the same time. She started batting her tail as if she was agitated. I guess it could've been my little brother messing with me, but it didn't sound like his voice at all. And usually when he messes with me like that, he reveals himself after. 

Hearing or seeing something unexplained is one thing, but when your pet reacts to it too... freaky."
Paranormal,ffhs4td,t1_ffhg8vm,1579951062.0,"I mean even if you excluded the part about your dreams, the fact that he stopped his truck to make eye contact with you is probably enough to at least have them create a report for the incident. That's creepy. Especially given that you were fourteen at the time."

Eyebleach,fex3bwp,t1_fero5wt,1579423609.0,"Bro have you ever petted a hedgehog? Particularly one who isn't familiar with you? They do this hiccup thing where their whole body convulses. Even though their quills are soft, they still hurt when they're jolting up into your skin.

There's a reason they can be called an ""ouch mouse"""

watchpeoplesurvive,femfqwp,t1_feklm23,1579253161.0,"This happened to me when I was like 10. Almost exactly. Got sideswiped and knocked the mirror off the car. I genuinely did not see the car coming. I looked both ways, and stepped off the curb and **BAM!** Next thing I knew I was waking up on the ground, my mom is crouching over me bawling her eyes out and my friend's dad is rubbing capris sun on my cheek (for some reason), I cry cuz mom is crying, ambulance and cops come, sirens and commotion everywhere, I'm freaking out. 

Ended up with just a couple cuts on my face and no injuries. 

I still really don't know how I didn't see the car. My kid brain must've just been so absent that it didn't register. But I wasn't dumb enough to just run out without looking both ways."

LucidDreaming,fdjqhm1,t1_fdjp06p,1578483550.0,"Thank you very much for your kind words. I'm going to therapy and working to get my life back together. I'm hoping at a certain point it won't hurt so much, so often. But we shall see. The 14th of next month will mark one year since he died and I'm so not ready for that. 

Also I write a little bit sometimes, usually poetry and music though, not so much actual creative writing. But thank you for saying that, I had no idea that I was a good writer. :)"
LucidDreaming,fdjoim1,t1_fdjmjgd,1578480931.0,"I know what you're trying to say. It's really complicated. It would be nice just to tell him how much I love him and how much he meant to me. And to apologize for all the shitty things I said to him throughout our relationship (we had a rocky relationship at times and would sometimes say nasty things to each other) and tell him that none of the stuff I said was true and how I've learned just how special he is to me. I'm thankful our last conversation was so loving and positive though. He'd just gotten fired from his job and i called him to talk about it, and he at the end of the call thanked me for not being mad at him. Not even half an hour later I got a call from his mother that he was in a bad car accident and was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. So I raced to the hospital and wasn't even there for ten minutes when they told us he was dead. 

I digress, I will definitely try. I don't think it'll help much, since my grief seems to be more complicated than just needing closure, but I can't imagine it'll hurt. 

One dream that I had which was particularly haunting: we were setting up a tent near the mouth of this huge cave, next to a dock which led to a lake, and on the other side was this English-style cobblestone road leading up a hill. There were these huge webs with giant spiders above us. It was a freaky scene, but I remember feeling really happy. I look over at him and say ""see? If you just stay with me, here, like this, everything will be okay."" He was silent though, his face was expressionless, as he usually is in my dreams, which is weird to me. Then one of my friends shows up at the bottom of this hill, so I run over to talk to him. We talked about something I can't really remember, when I suddenly became lucid. I was excited beyond belief. I turned tail and sprinted to my boyfriend as fast as I could screaming ""Benji! Baby we can be together again I'm right here I love you so much!"" But as I'm running, the scene began to deteriorate. Everything melted before my eyes into blackness, including his form. I watched the skin melt off of his face exposing his skull as he stood staring blankly at me. I screamed ""no no no NO NO NO NO!"" and woke up sitting straight up in my bed, panting and sweating. 

It was jarring and horrifying, and pretty traumatic. Idk what the dream was supposed to mean and why my mind would conjure up something so horrible, but even still, I was just glad to see him again for a little bit."
LucidDreaming,fdjmfbs,t1_fdiqnzg,1578477928.0,"I dream about my late boyfriend sometimes. I have had very jarring, intensely emotional lucid dreams about him and every time I wake up and immediately try to go right back into the dream. Makes me wanna get back into lucid dreaming just so I can be with him more. Maybe that isn't healthy though."
