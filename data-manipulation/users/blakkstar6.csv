creepy,ffo44nf,t1_ffnwc8w,1580073935.0,"No worries. It's not an easy gig at all. It drove me to a complete mental breakdown actually, so I understand getting defensive. Lots of people have to experience a family member declining like that, but that one case is their only reference point for the broad spectrum that is dementia. They never know how many iterations there are, unless they spend some time in the home. Having to teach family members how to deal with their loved one in their new state was one of the more difficult tasks, and I had to ask more than one to leave on occasion, because they could not understand that their behavior was just making things worse. In a lot of ways, the resident is suffering less than anyone else involved. But they could be kept happy once you learned how with each one, and those were valuable lessons and moments for me.

Your comment was a bit snarky and insensitive, yes, and I fully understand where it came from. Professional distance looks ugly to anyone not in the field. But you recognised that, and you are already performing a sacred service, so all's well. Keep it up, and I hope you are taking care of yourself as well as you can. It's absolutely necessary in that line of work.

creepy,ffnzqv4,t1_ffneamv,1580072728.0,"We have different sources of information, then. All I know is that in my memory care facility, there were many residents who were mentally functional but physically limited, and all of our licensed RNs referred to their disorders as a type of dementia. The Parkinson's one is of particular note because it is clearly neurodegenerative.

If all we are debating is semantics here, then it isn't really worth it. My point was that to be trapped in your own body and barely able to communicate when your brain still works was a bit sadder than the people who just lost their minds. You could redirect and console those residents. You could not console someone who was slowly dying and knew it."
creepy,ffn7hye,t1_ffn2l4w,1580062811.0,"Yes, it is actually. If you lose motor control because of a breakdown in the brain, it is the same dementia as the kinds that limit cognitive function. Dementia means any loss of function in the brain, which can manifest in as many ways as there are processes the brain is responsible for. Parkinson's is a kind of dementia, for example.

He was still fresh from the Academy, with Starfleet stars bright in his eyes, one of which was the legend of Red Squad. Being a good officer doesn't always mean exercising your authority anytime it is within your purview; sometimes you recognise the cohesion of the established team and let them do their job as they see fit. These two attitudes would have combined and resulted in him staying starblind to the reality of the situation. It wouldn't be much longer before he was personally and irrevocably altered by the war; this was his last moment of innocent optimism.

arizona,fffygzg,t1_ffffw44,1579894560.0,"Do not move into a neighborhood with palm trees. They nest in them. Otherwise, they are common enough that we know how to proof against them mostly. A few tips:

Hang your shoes up at the end of the day. Don't store them on the floor. All our creepy crawlies love to hang out in shoes.

They despise concentrated essential oils like lavender or peppermint, so if you do end up having a problem, you can spray some of this in strategic spots, like entry ways and window sills. Also, maintain a clear, trimmed perimeter around your home. They like to hang out in shrubs and can get in your home that way.

It's a good idea to have a portable blacklight if you are outside at night. They are nocturnal, and they will light up like ravers under a blacklight.

There is not a chemical in the world that will kill these things (don't listen to anyone who says they can). If you do encounter one in your home, ye olde boot is the only reliable way to take them out. And *put your full weight into it for a few seconds*. They are tanks. And then burn it. Especially if it has babies like in the pic.

The majority of our species are not venomous, and the worst of them (the bark scorpion) won't kill you unless you have cardiological issues to begin with. Rule of thumb: the smaller they are, the more venomous they are. 1 inch or smaller: handle with care.

All that being said... It's really not that bad. We aren't at war with them. Having lived here for my whole life, I've only encountered a handful at very sporadic times. Arizona is a beautiful place; you just have to realize that it is a desert, and life is on the extreme end of kill or be killed here. A measure of precaution and alertness is necessary when in the wilder spots. The learning curve is part of the experience, and you will learn to appreciate it, I promise :)"

The scalpel, the ointment, psychological deconstruction; all are merely agents of change. All involve the destruction of something. Morality can't be honestly applied until the aftermath, because to do so beforehand is to come to an absolute conclusion about an act in a universal sense before it becomes a complete action. And an action is not complete until its consequences are observed.

As is said elsewhere, a huge chunk of our modern medical understanding is due to horrific experiments conducted in the past. Awful as it was, though, no sensible person would compromise modern medicine by going back in time and putting a stop to them. The cost in human life since would be astronomically greater. This is, of course, easy to twist into justifying performing such actions before those consequences are observed. The vigilance might be naive in every sense of the word, but it is absolutely necessary to maintain the balance. Because change is coming, no matter what you do.

It's the trolley question. You have to apply your own level to it, but consequences of both sorts are always there. And that balance can't be accounted until after the switch is thrown. Or the cut is made, and the return to equilibrium actually observed."

How she thought being on offense the whole time was going to gain her points is beyond my fathom. It would have been far more satisfactory to see someone who could roll with the punches a bit more. I think if then-Cardinal Francis had been a part of it, it may have gone more smoothly.

I don't side with the church on any of this; indeed, I left my faith behind a very long time ago. So this is from a purely objective position when I say that I wish it had been a more fair fight, so to speak.

teslore,fegccb2,t3_eoshyx,1579087421.0,"In addition to being an Elder Scrolls buff, I am also a Trekkie. We Trekkies understand the concept of Mantling as being analogous to the Trill symbiote relationship of Star Trek. If you are not familiar, the Trill are a race that coexist with symbiotic parasites that live on their world. The host is a typical humanoid with a more or less typical lifespan, but the parasite can exist for hundreds of years. As a result, a parasite acquires multiple hosts throughout its life, accumulating the memories and experiences of each. Consequently, the new host receives all of these memories upon joining, and in that moment, the symbiote and the host are no longer distinct entities, but a whole new one as a result of the blending of the two.

With a few liberalizations taken with the concept, it could easily be applied to Mantling. CoC the Host was joined with Sheogorath the Symbiote. It is a new mad god comprised of both original beings, each sharing the previous experiences of the other, and extrapolating a new identity from them. As for which is more in control... This is Sheo we are talking about. Control is a silly concept to apply here. Which, in a way, means that Sheo wins automatically, as any control the CoC ever tried to exert would be inherently negated.

The CoC is still there. He has a degree of influence on the new Prince. But he's mainly going with Sheo's flow now, because he's been around a while. He knows what he's doing. Plus, it's just more fun ;)"

To add to this, I like to think Sheo was working it out for himself as well. He was the Hero of Kvatch a mere 200 years ago. He must still be fitting into the role of Mad King, and learning what it really means. A part of that (maybe a large part) is delving into the memories of Pelagius III, which are memories he inherited from the previous Sheo. As the experience was granted rather than earned, he would be outside looking in and sort of 'rationalizing' it to himself through the actions of the LDB."

The connotations of 'fantasy' and 'sci-fi' are pretty strongly defined for most people, and new authors have been blending the two into their own style in an effort to break convention. We could debate for days and never come to a satisfactory definition. The only way one can decide for themselves is to take in as much material as they can and make their own judgments. Speculative fiction as a term won't catch on cuz it's technical and not sexy, but it is the only one that encompasses all of these components, and thus would be the name of the spectrum that is at the heart of the matter."

startrek,fedpuj1,t1_fedomjl,1579017291.0,"Valid plot device, but yeah, pretty poorly done."
fantasywriters,fednu3b,t1_fedfxj0,1579016018.0,"I accept your answer as an elaboration on my own. The detailed exposition need not be there exactly, particularly in a visual medium, as that would become tedious quickly. What counts is that the technology has just enough implied fact in it to seem plausible in sci-fi. The technology is such a part of the setting that it is nearly a character in itself. Those things are summarily dismissed in fantasy tales in favor of exploration of plot, as you say.

A written sci-fi story will often contain such exposition, either directly or indirectly, but as we agree, it is not a solid law. Just a general tendency."
startrek,fed8ge0,t1_fed6exx,1579003596.0,"Technically Gary Stu, but this is it. The only episode where he is actually interesting as a character is the one about the accident at the Academy, because he finally gets a real conflict to deal with. Otherwise, his whole 'pinnacle of human potential' dross with the Traveler... ugh."
fantasywriters,fed6nr8,t3_eog9tk,1579001435.0,"I'll say what nobody else appears to have said yet:

The difference between sci-fi and general fantasy is the level of investment into explaining the basic rules of the world in a way that fits 'realistic' logic. Sci-fi goes deep in defining its technology with precise language, and the forces at work can be explained logically with real-world physics. In fantasy, these things are often handwaved. Even in the case of a hard magic system, the fundamental 'rules' have no basis in factual physics.

These are not at all hard and fast rules, as it is far more a spectrum than either side of a fence, and that is why you are seeing Star Wars being labelled as fantasy. Despite having space travel, lasers, and droids, they don't spend a lot of time defining how they all work. They just expect you to accept that they do.

So the genre of your own story will be determined by your level of analog to logical laws of nature, not just the use of certain elements that appear to belong to one or the other."
startrek,febfz19,t1_febe30j,1578958417.0,I like to think that they did revisit the basic premise as the Changelings in DS9.
startrek,febfdwf,t1_febdapv,1578958213.0,"The other episode I still remember giving me nightmares when I was a kid was the one in S07, when the Enterprise crew all started devolving. Worf the Crab Monster was the most frightening thing ever."
startrek,febem4v,t1_febde7f,1578958073.0,"The value of the dream itself is still hotly contested to this day. The current lean of the scientific community seems to be that remembering your dreams can actually be detrimental, as it means that you haven't processed some function entirely. The subconscious has a job to do, and merging its operations with the conscious mind is an error in the system that can result in a short-circuit-like effect. So no more dream journals, guys ;)

Alright, I'm going back down that research rabbit hole. Thanks for the inspiration :)"
startrek,febco5w,t1_feb5h1e,1578957524.0,"I can't quote relevant studies, but I do know that it is absolutely true. REM sleep is when you process new neural pathways and perform vitally essential chemical reactions in the brain. Without it, the brain goes toxic on itself and gradually fails. Elderly people who lose this function almost invariably develop some type of dementia, though whether it is a cause or a symptom is up for debate."
startrek,febatho,t1_feb1nhf,1578957018.0,"Yeah, sorry about that. It was the first link that fit the criteria. It's significantly less awful via Netflix, which is where I saw it just before posting."

startrek,feauzxg,t1_feas9rq,1578952430.0,What that has to do with this discussion is as mysterious as why they made that episode in the first place ;)
