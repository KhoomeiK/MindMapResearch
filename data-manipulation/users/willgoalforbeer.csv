fender,ffdtz6l,t1_ffc4zu2,1579828872.0,"When I removed the tiny Chinese speaker I took a picture of it next to the Eminence & sent it to my buddy, the difference was so ridiculous, he ordered one on the spot. The magnet alone must be six times the size. Thick fibered cone vs thin cardboard. Guys will drop thousands on a guitar for “tone” but not less than a hundred on a quality speaker. Takes seconds to swap."
fender,ffc08z8,t3_esmctr,1579788197.0,"I own the discontinued 10w VibroChamp, which is essentially the same amp with the same features. The trick with these amps is to lose the cheap Chinese speaker. For about $65 I used an Eminence Patriot. My friend used their Texas Heat in his. Huge difference. While changing it, it appeared it could be increased to a 12” if you’re handy with a jigsaw. The next mod I did was upgrading the 2 cheap tubes, which my friend also did with his. Both amps sound amazing & the old components are so shoddy it really makes me scratch my head as to why Fender shoots themselves in the foot by doing this"

WinStupidPrizes,feclsa6,t3_eo9t3r,1578977065.0,Yawn.....that’s 59 seconds of my life lost watching some poorly scripted bullshit.
howtonotgiveafuck,fd2fnob,t1_fd0npa9,1578146529.0,You’re likely making a great move. I completely cut all ties with my mother 35 years ago & it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Some people are simply evil & just because you are related doesn’t mean you have to wear them like an anchor around your neck for the rest of your life.
guitarporn,fckncwf,t3_eh90sa,1577729066.0,Thank you! I’ve almost unsubscribed to this sub due to the flood of crappy new  $300 Chinese Epiphones & Squires. Beautiful vintage or high end custom instruments is what this sub should be about. I have expressed similar opinions in the past & been trashed by the cheap guitar crowd. Don’t care. Mass produced new guitars are rarely guitar porn. Maybe if there’s some insane wood grain.
guitarpedals,fc956cj,t3_egrjep,1577547214.0, The FS-6 dual switch with a TRS cable makes the timing so much easier.
BetterEveryLoop,fc2n97f,t1_fc2g9ve,1577367914.0,"You are very likely correct. However, with all the garbage & horror constantly in the media & internet, it is fun to pretend that this dog appreciates the T shirt. A small sliver of happiness in the cesspool of reality."

Only practice on the days you eat."
BarnFinds,fbalmo9,t3_ec6rbq,1576681299.0,"I scored the same double Mac box to the left, but also with the side hanger box about ten years ago for $200 out of an old barn. It was covered in pigeon poop. I power washed it, removed and polished all the handles, painted it, installed fresh drawer liners, greased the rails, and wow! Is she pretty! Built like a tank. You did very well. The older stuff is well worth cleaning up. In this case, the old saying “ They don’t make ‘em like they used to” definitely applies. Enjoy!!"
