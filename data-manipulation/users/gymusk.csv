AskGaybrosOver30,ff3mynh,t3_ereony,1579544500.0,"Stereotypes exist because a lot of people fit them. ‘Creepy old men’ is not the same as ‘old men.’ They’re a lot of creepy old men out there hanging around young men who aren’t interested because that’s who they are: creepy old men. They were probably once creepy young guys who hung around young guys who weren’t interested in them either. 

What’s creepy, is not their age, it’s their pursuit of guys who are not interested. 

I’m 62 and happily married. I love talking to young men; I learn a lot of interesting things from them that make my life more interesting. I also, surprisingly, have found a lot of young men interested in sex with me. Usually, but not always, for creepy reasons. Like young men, I try to avoid the creeps. And because I’m happily married, I also avoid nice young men just interested in sex. But the rest, I throughly enjoy. 

I think the stereotype exist because young men are shocked at the cluelessness and the creepiness of the creepy old guys while they just dismiss the cluelessness and creepiness of the young guys as what they already know to be real. I mean we all expect and hope that people will grow up and evolve with age. For young men, the creepy old guys prove that doesn’t necessarily happen. And that’s both shocking and discouraging. 

The only time the stereotype has ever pissed me off is when some creepy young guy is loudly asserting that I want to ravish him because I didn’t want to buy him a drink or whatever. 

Creepy is creepy; age is just a number."

I don’t believe in shaming fat people anymore that I believe in shaming smokers or alcoholics. But if you call any of that ‘body positive,’ I will tell you the facts. And that’s all Jillian did. 

We have real problem right now with facts. They hurt too many people’s feelings and we’re choosing to ignore them and suffer instead of simply doing the right thing.

Yes, I can see you’re fat. I can also see how you eat. I can see how hard it is for you just to move around and sit. I can also see that people, generally, do not find you attractive. 

So yeah, be fat, no problem, most of the country is fat. But stop with the fatlogic. It insults everyone who does watch their weight and exercise. We all know the truth."

Ragen doesn’t have enough friends and family to make it. She couldn’t even get more than a handful of people to show up for her epic triathlon fail. However she does have tons more material about failure; triathlon, fat athlete, dancer, writer, activist. 

Unfortunately, the comedy of failure is a downer unless you learn from your failure and somehow, in someway, become more enlightened. No one wants to hear over and over how you failed pointlessly. And Ragen has made it abundantly clear that she wants nothing to do with enlightenment of any kind."

As one of the guys who’s corresponded with you and values your insights and thoughts, I want to say that I appreciate this one too. 

One of the things that I’ve found about interesting and worthwhile people is that they have so many things going on in their lives that it’s hard to find space for anything else. But Reddit is something that does fit into those spaces that we all have; a few minutes here, a few minutes there and sometimes an hour or two, all absolutely whenever you have the time. 

Bringing Reddit friends into real life requires time and coincidence, or serendipity. You keep talking and sooner or later, you’re both in the same place at the same time and you have some extra time. I have a friend from here in NYC and I go to NYC and he comes to LA frequently but it took years before we were both in the same city at the same time and we both had time to meet."
