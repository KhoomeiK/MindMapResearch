Accounting,feobir3,t1_feo1958,1579297724.0,They know your going to give them a clean audit opinion anyways because you want those sweet sweet fees.  Why waste everyone's time pretending to work in the mean time?
Accounting,febbk92,t1_febarnz,1578957168.0,What are you competing fore in Canada? A F100 controller position?  Those are few and far between here.

Happened to multiple people I know, it's not really a exclusive club.  Big 4 isn't worth too much in Canada, every idiot has it and there aren't many F500 HQs here for it to really matter."
Accounting,fe6lvwy,t1_fe6dg83,1578895311.0,Not really getting in to big 4 in Canada is pretty damn easy.  I stumbled my way into a offer and my GPA was shit.
Accounting,fe6lkmf,t1_fe61pn8,1578894982.0,Come on a majority of kids in public are upper middle class white kids.  You don't live on 30k in high cost of living areas without your parents help.
Accounting,fe6l8ed,t1_fe5sthm,1578894631.0,"Accounting definitely atracts trust fund kids because no one can really survive on 30k/year in high col.  Then these same kids will laugh at people who leave for industry saying ""they couldn't make it in public""."

hiphopheads,fdt61g2,t1_fdt0gx5,1578712382.0,They sell the most of rappers.  To do Eminem numbers you have to sell to everyone.
hiphopheads,fdpr854,t1_fdpohsr,1578637429.0,They can be two different song but they still compliment eachother perfectly.
hiphopheads,fdpr5kl,t1_fdpq0qy,1578637355.0,I'm absolutely fine with that.  Most songs on WATTBA where absolutely taken over by one or the other.  Give them both to breath and hope there is a few diamonds dancing where they both come through.
