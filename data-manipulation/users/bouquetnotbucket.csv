bramptondrivers,ffddqhe,t3_et0o7n,1579818732.0,Infuriating AF. He stared people down as they scrambled to go over the snow and onto the sidewalk. The entire block was snowed in and this was the only entrance. People had to walk through incoming traffic. Sad.
words,ffaki0t,t1_ff9qai0,1579738003.0,"Vindication has almost a gleeful quality to it. Like you were right at the end of the day despite the naysayers and opposition. However, you are right; there is also a non-emotive way of using it. I think it depends on the context."
words,ff8w5eq,t3_esamdh,1579698081.0,"Vindication.

Edit: Vindicated."
canada,ff33e6d,t1_feyhsrx,1579532650.0,"I was surprised to find out that NHS across the pond covers CBT with a registered therapist as the first line of defence against depression and anxiety. I know someone who went through it and he said it was a straightforward process to get an appointment and help.

Meanwhile, we are stuck with a complex network of agencies and sub-agencies. You need a referral, wait, then another referral or appointment. By the end of it, you just want to give up especially if you are dealing with crippling depression or anxiety.

Edit: I want to simplify the difference. My friend met a CBT therapist for 8 sessions where the they broke it down and told him how to use it for everyday life. Much different than what I went through in Ontario."
cats,felol9d,t1_felo54w,1579227152.0,Yes for sure.
Brampton,fekas8g,t1_fek84jm,1579196161.0,Yeah! That’s not a bad idea! Maybe serve up some killer chai lattes in all of Brampton.
Brampton,fek7oor,t3_ep1c5l,1579194331.0,"Oh this is not even the latest information. I know someone who lives here and the last time I counted, the number has gone up to 8 IIRC. 

Also it’s one of the few streets in Brampton that has a roundabout. It’s an interesting and quiet area. I just wish one of these shops was a cafe."
explainlikeimfive,feiomsu,t3_ep6iy7,1579143412.0,"I really needed to read this post. I think I have developed an eating disorder and I am trying to get my eating patterns in order. I think I am too fat even though I am probably on the lower side of the BMI for my weight, age, and sex."
lgbt,fege91r,t1_fegc2f1,1579089683.0,I’m going to follow what you have suggested. I have already begun packing but I’m having a difficult time as I am very methodological and struggling with managing this and my emotions and thoughts at the same time.
lgbt,fegbrh1,t1_feg9q9t,1579086669.0,"It’s okay, you don’t have to make a clever comment. I’m just grateful that you read this and said something positive. I do need to cut them out. I dislike that I have to do this but it seems like it needs to be done."
lgbt,fegbo9m,t1_feg9tcy,1579086551.0,I appreciate that. Thank you.
lgbt,fegbnl2,t1_fegafbb,1579086526.0,"Thank you so much. My intention is to move to such a place. I don’t necessarily have to live where I am. I get it and that’s what people have been telling me.

I just have collected so many precious things (like books, stupid coffee mugs, and other things that may sound trivial) that I need to either donate them, recycle them, or pack them. 

It’s just so overwhelming to up and move and pack your entire life. I know it’s difficult but it needs to be done."
lgbt,fegbj31,t1_fegaoo7,1579086357.0,"Ok. Well so here are my next steps. I’m going to find housing and employment and try to stabilize for a year or so. 

I reached out to a crisis line two days ago. Yesterday, I met with a social worker and we talked for an hour. She gave me more information as to what would be best to do next. 

I am in the Toronto area and lucky enough that there are resources here to help people in my situation. I do live in the sun-urbs and don’t have a car at the moment so that makes it difficult for me to move around. But that’s ok. I’ll find another way to make it work. 

I just don’t want to be stuck with this any longer."
lgbt,fegalif,t1_feg9og5,1579085082.0,"I am not going to disappear like a coward. I need to resolve this and move forward. I feel sad when I hear or read about people that just walk out on relationships.

Edit: You are a 100% right though. I think my perspective on this is a bit skewed at the moment. I will reflect on your suggestion for sure."
cats,fectkgy,t3_eo7ydp,1578984074.0,Your cat is so mf cute. Yup.
cats,fe3i735,t1_fds6hy7,1578849469.0,She is absolutely chilled out. I got lucky with this gloomy head.
ontario,fdna94p,t3_em9hxv,1578581367.0,"I think it’d be great if the secular school system can learn from the catholic school board and improve it’s status as a provider of quality education.

They consistently score better in rankings of quality education with more graduates and higher test scores. The top schools in my city are Catholic. Same with cities around me. Toronto, Mississauga, Vaughan. 

I dislike the homophobia, sexism and outright bullying. It needs to stop. I don’t think there’ll be any change though. There are a lot of discriminatory people out there who often hold attitudes that belong in the past. If they could adopt to the reality of the way the world is now, we would have seen more tangible change. 

 I’d like to see a unified system as well. I don’t think taxpayers should pay for you to indoctrinate others into what is basically a cult. (I’m an atheist and lack patience for sky gods.) 

But they seem to be doing something right and we have to learn from that before we innovate as all to a unified newer public education system."
