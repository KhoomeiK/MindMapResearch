I get into an argument with my dad at least once a week over the dumbest, most trivial things. My self-esteem has pretty much crumbled because of situations like this, so I really do get it. I always feel like I do everything wrong or like Iâ€™m not doing enough because of how they talk to me."
SuicideWatch,fecebea,t3_eo9o49,1578971876.0,"Sending you a lot of love. Reading this post broke my heart a bit and I hope you know how many people care about you here. I know depression is so hard to deal with and it wears more and more on you it seems like until you can barely stand it anymore, but I want you to know that you are loved. Wish I could give you a hug, but the next best thing I can do is tell you so. Hang in there and tell your cat and dolls hi for me (Ps. I love dolls too. Have all my life)."
