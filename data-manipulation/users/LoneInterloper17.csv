The millenium bug happens but on smaller scale: the systems just exceed the maximum time amount but instead of just going back to 0 they go back to 0 and something, effectively going from 2019 to 2009. Nothing excessively serious happens but just small problems and bugs that are easy to fix but inconveniently long and tedious to work around. Like when you build a PC and you are not kind of sure of what the fuck is wrong with it, or like when the printer does that bullshit everytime."

Everybody gangsta till they send the women's lmg division. They doesn't even care about the toll, since we all know for men getting sick gets way more debilitating than for women. Since they recover faster in anything, even after orgasms, with this ability and the ability to fulfil difficult tasks even under the effect of debilitating causes the combat capacity is always efficient even without the monthly rage. You think you will most fear the killbots and the super soldiers, but may god have mercy for you poor fella when you win a battle and the next month your kill comes back after you looking to shove her rake looking hand up your ass.
