Some killer whales will hold up to a thousand individual bones in their stomach at a time before regurgitating them up. As some killer whales age they find it harder and harder to regurgitate all these bones and will sometimes die because they have too many bones inside them. One dead killer whale was found to have nearly 2500 bones inside it which is almost as much as your mom."

PublicFreakout,fcw2rpj,t1_fcw0o1g,1578015807.0,"I doubt you could buy a place without signing HOA documents in advance. And they have a solid foundation. The neighbors band together to make sure they can stop people in the neighborhood from letting their property become run down and drag down the value of the surrounding properties. Imagine your neighbor let their yard become full of broken down cars and junk couches, effectively making the value of your own house plummet. Without an HOA you have no power to tell them to stop doing something on their own property. Builders building neighborhoods will often establish HOAs and force everyone buying a house to sign on to a contract that also forces anyone they sell to to sign on to this HOA. It's to protect everyone. 

But then, since it's run by the community most often, you get retirees on the board who have too much time and power on their hands and will try to police the neighborhood to keep it up to their own standards, instead of what is needed to maintain value. No one with a job can be bothered to show up to an HOA meeting at 9pm on a wednesday except the board. So retired old ned passes a new rule that garbage cans must be stored inside because he just feels that's the right way and the rest of the board doesn't care. So you start getting fines and warnings to set up a lien on your property because your cans have been outside for ten days in a row. It's a decent idea gone awry."
