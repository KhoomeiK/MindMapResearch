One thing that has always stuck out to me when doing the 2C variations is that it feels very ""toggle-abble"". I can enjoy my trip and let it take me wherever it is going, but if I need some clarity or ""sobriety"" it feels like I can have the trip take a back seat to whatever I need to do, like finding my lighter that I dropped somewhere in my pitch black tent.  

I'd like to note that I put ""sobriety"" in quotes for a reason. I'm not trying to imply that you can just snap your fingers and suddenly you're no longer impaired. This is just my personal observation and take on things, and I certainly wouldn't try to drive while on it or anything like that."

StoriesAboutKevin,fg4iom1,t1_fg3w7rn,1580504045.0,"> If so, Xanax must have some wretched side effects.  

This is putting it mildly.  

And sort of regular or prolonged use results in a vicious cycle that goes like this:  

1. You start experiencing a ""rubber band"" effect. The drug helps control your anxiety, but when it wears off, you end up more anxious than you were before.  
2. Your tolerance increases rapidly, causing the drug to have both a lesser effect and a lesser half-life in your system.  
3. Withdrawals from cessation or even just cutting down the dose results in dangerous and severe insomnia, mood instability, panic attacks, and an array of related symptoms. This goes far beyond feeling discomfort. Banzodiazepanes like Xanax, Ativan, and Valium can literally kill you if you suddenly stop taking it (the only other drug that does this is alcohol, both play havoc with your Gaba receptors in similar ways, which is part of why mixing booze and benzos is so dangerous). Possible efrects of quitting cold turkey include strokes, seizures, heart attacks, and death.  

This makes it very, very easy to get locked into a cycle of addiction. You want to get off them, but that completely rational fear of dying keeps you right in the thick of it.  

I was addicted to benzos for about six years. I tried numerous times to cut down, but this caused my anxiety to spiral out of control. When I tried to go cold turkey I had a stroke. It took a two week supervised medical detox to finally get off them. It then took about two years before I finally felt somewhat stable. I'm three years clean from them now, and there are parts of who I was before that I don't think I will ever get back."

I also use at least a little bit of pbp in my non-pbp games to cover things like downtime and personal side quests and such.  

As far as using a West Marches style, that seems like  good fit for your particular circumstaces. My only concern would  be that the collaborative nature of Dungeon World when it comes to world building and adventure structure might not be the best fit for a West Marches game.  

PbtA games like Dungeon World tend to work best for following an ongoing story that stems from the personal goals and motivations of the individual characters. If those characters are coming and going in an unpredictable manner, you might run into some issues juggling all those different threads and rationalizing PC motivations.  

Personally, I feel that West Marches games work better with a more defined world and lots of pre-planned adventure locations. For example,  a traditional West Marches might have a map with various dungeons and ruins. Each one of those locations has something to offer just about any character, such as wealth, experience, and power. Because different parties will often go to the same locations, those locations work best when they are consistent and created in advance.  

A well run Dungeon World game, on the other hand, works better for impromptu and free form stories and locations. The whole ""make maps but leave blanks"" idea reinforces this concept, as does ""play to find out"".  

You can certainly use Dungeon World and run a West Marches game, but these are the issues that I think might occur. Not every West Marches game is how I've described here, nor is every Dungeon World game.  

Best of luck!"
