Is there a time of day you tend to start drinking most of the time. For me it was the evenings after work. I needed to just get through 3 hours, not 24. If I could get stay sober until 8 pm I was largely on the clear for the day, because an hour or two, and that’s not nearly enough time to tie on a good and proper drunk. What’s the point of having one or two? I found a way to use my “what’s the point?” attitude for me, rather against me.

i started meal prepping healthy meals for the week at work, trying to stay around 1800 calories per day. My Basal metabolic rate is about 1800-1900 calories a day. (low fat, low sugar, low carb, high protein - so a lot of chicken, some fish, but grilled chicken is awesome, and i'm getting pretty good at grilling)

i also joined a gym called 9rounds. 30 minutes, high intensity interval training (hiit) exercises, no class times. you just show up, jump into the rotation, and kick and punch, and squat, and push-up  for 30 minutes. the first two weeks were rough, but i went 4 times a week, kinda feel 3 times a week would have been better to start with. eventually i got up to 5 times a week. it is pricey about $110 a month, but i thought the financial commitment, because that's a lot to me, would keep me motivated. it worked. i kept at it. the end of this month will be 4 months of a pretty clean diet, and exercise. i am leaving the gym after this month, because i have some holiday bills to pay, and i'm a little sad. i was just starting to interact more with the trainers and other members, and feels like i have to start that process over again, (i have no social life, so trying to build one in middle age is challenging) but i have a plan, and going to keep at it.

first two months seemed really slow, but into the third there were noticeable changes.

stopdrinking,ffqakem,t3_eun6gg,1580128304.0,"Yeah, you definitely have a tendency to alcohol abuse. Like you I started early. I was actually thinking about this yesterday while thinking about “moderation”. My junior year in high school I drank once or twice a month, excessively. Senior year about 8 times month. That summer after graduation probably 3 times a week. And by the time I started college I was excessively drinking about 4 times a week. I never drank moderately, and never had control, but I think that is kinda what I was after a little, just losing control.  

Needless to say I never found a way to drink moderately, and if you compare the “good” times to the “bad” it’s not even close. I had some memorable and pleasant moments but spent the last 10 years on the verge of suicide, and a self hate no one should have to experience. I’m 44 now, and this is the first time I have felt comfortable in my adult life. Lots of lost years, not to mention a whole host of other issues health, relationships, financial - kinda the big 3

And you are also right that life can be, and is still more rich, and satisfying than that vacation with 10 drinks a day. Kinda makes you sick to the stomach.

These past four months, the first two were constant thoughts of drinking, and not drinking. The last two, not nearly as much, and I am finding that I can keep myself relatively entertained. Today was tough. I did a lot of chores, and my kiddo was pushing my anxiety, and I probably spent a good part of the day reminding myself drinking does me zero favors.

i may be off base here, but after the relationship ended you probably spent a little time in the head space. wondering where it wrong, where you went wrong, where they went wrong, could it have been different if? what now? how could there ever be another now?

this is all natural, and important for you to search through, but not necessary that you live there. most of the stuff in that broad focus doesn't really even have a concrete answer to it, and if it did it likely wouldn't matter because what happened happened, and it's not likely going to change.

so, if you are dwelling on the relationship, or other big issues, it's okay to set them down, come back to your present truth, or a present task, like not drinking for this day, or something simple like washing your undies, the whites, dude. occupy your mind in the present, your subconscious will tackle some of the larger stuff for you. revisit as necessary, just be sure not to set up shop there."

what's funny, is that i have been approaching this sobriety attempt strictly from a behavioral standpoint. wanting to change two behaviors, 1. going directly to store after work for drinks, and 2. not taking that first drink. reading through the model i felt i had moved closely aligned with the ""precontemplation --> contemplation --> and preparation"" steps all these years, and on my own moved to action - not driving to the store after work, and then repeating that.

here i am almost 4 months later, and i know we say it all the time, but this really feels different. it's a behavior i can change, it's a behavior i want to change, and so, it's a behavior i try to change. i don't really long to have a drink. the thought of it makes me a little physically ill, and i clearly see drinking as a choice between self-destruction, and self-creation. i may have had a little incentive with a poor health report, and all signs pointing towards an ugly, and ignoble death, but i made the decision to action the change i want.

the changes in my body and mind over the past four months are simply unbelievable. i understand that at any moment i could lose it all, but seeing the problem as a problem of behavior, and habit that can be changed through forced action, and not so much as a problem of addiction, or personality which can seem a little overwhelming has made this time better. and, tackling the habit of drinking is making it easier for me to address the more messier parts of why i picked up this habit.

what is so unbelievable, is not just how long i believed all the lies, but how thin that veil actually is. i mean, it's like, once you see through that lie, you can;t comprehend how you ever believed it. what the fuck was i on all those years?!?!? - then, oh, yeah. i was drinking myself into delusion. well, don't want to do that again.

3. The way the ladies are responding (I’m kinda playing, but I am not that afraid of eye contact anymore, and am usually greeted by a nice warm smile. I realize they are just being nice and not wanting to jump my bones, but having even that simple interaction really helps, and who knows, some may be thinking about jumping my bones:)"

I have been reading that glycogen, some type of sugar compound, is mostly stored in the liver, something like a third of its weight is this glycogen stuff. Glycogen has been linked to sleep regulation among other things, and drinking damages the way the liver can store, and use glycogen causing poor sleep.

So, your liver may need some time for recovery before regular sleep is possible. At least that what’s I’m telling myself. 

Hang in there. I had many nights where 2-3 hours was all I was getting, slowly it seems to be getting better, but you should just prepare yourself that it could take several months, or years - idk, I don’t remember the last time I was sober a year"
