1200isplenty,ff7yov5,t3_es3d63,1579661522.0,"Read the community info page. 1200 cal is minimum for women. Not sufficient for men, teenagers, or those working out regularly. So if you're not already a slim woman you should probably eat more than 1200 Cal. I'm currently eating 2000/day and losing weight. So don't take the title literally. It's an unfortunate title because1200 is not always enough but I like to follow this subreddit because it reminds me that I can eat what I want and stay under my calorie allotment no matter what it is."
bipolar,ff7y14o,t3_es3k7n,1579661063.0,I've always enjoyed writing and would write a ton when manic but it's mostly rambling nonsense. Now that I'm medicated I have actually completed 4 chapters and have a good start on another 4 or so. I never had the ability to finish anything when manic but now I can. My creativity is still present just in a more organized way.
bipolar,ff7xgc2,t1_ff7vcl6,1579660664.0,"Ok, those all sound like valid concerns. Some docs won't even diagnose if you're using rec drugs. Think of it all as a science experiment. If you change 5 variables at once then you don't know which caused what. So getting you off rec drugs and adjusting your current meds first does make sense before introducing a new drug. What if getting off weed helped, then you wouldn't need another drug. Is your sleep study done now? I'd probably give her a little more time. Continue to express your concerns and negotiate with her. It takes a long time to figure out. I've been on meds over two years and last appointment was the first time we didn't adjust something. I think when doc prescribed too much all at once is when people feel like zombies. It takes time to observe the effects (positive and negative) and adjust to find the right combo for you. But it also doesn't hurt to call your doc before your appointment and say that it isn't working. I've had my doc make adjustments over the phone and then we could discuss how that change is going at next appointment. Just my thoughts. Hope you find some relief soon."
bipolar,ff7wcqn,t3_es445p,1579659920.0,"Yes I think it's possible. I've been stable for months now. Taking meds at same time, sleeping, and no rec drugs including caffeine are the 3 big parts for me. Seroquel changed my life by helping me sleep. Currently working in eating healthier and exercising more which is easier to do when stable in meds. So I feel like stability can gain momentum by getting healthier in other ways. The more my meds help me stay sane, the better I can take care of myself, the better I'll feel, etc. If you're going through hard times that makes stability harder to hold onto. Just keep fighting. I think we can all get there eventually with the right doc, a good therapist, and determination. Good luck!"
bipolar,ff7uzjd,t3_es4cbm,1579658994.0,"This all sounds really fishy. Is this a psychiatrist you're seeing? Any pdoc should know that therapy, exercise, and self care cannot fix bipolar on its own. Medication is necessary. Why won't she give you Seroquel? Did you ask her directly? It makes sense to only change one med at a time so you know which drug is causing which effects. So is that her thinking or she honestly thinks you don't need drugs. If she's not helping you, is there another doc you can see instead? Sorry you're going through this. Hang in there."
Bipolar_ADHD,ff7u8me,t3_es4fut,1579658492.0,"I relate to this so much. I was diagnosed with ADHD  in my late 20s and then bipolar 1 two years ago at age 39. I too had a very hyped up, demanding presence. I used to think everyone was so fake, that polite fakeness. I was real, I was honest. People who didn't like that just couldn't handle the truth. But meds have changed that. Seroquel is my magic chill pill. I used to value the adventurous, crazy party girl in me. Now I'm having to let her go. Let go of the intensity. Life is actually really good without it. Learning to enjoy the quiet moments. Be patient and give meds an honest try. It took over 2 years to find the right doses for me but I've been super stable since then. Good luck. You got this!"

All these are pretty pleasant symptoms. But it cues me in to make sure I don't get worse because next comes intense irritability and anger which can be destructive. Usually I talk to my doc and therapist, adjust meds and make sure I stick to my sleep routine."

bipolar,ff4y70t,t1_ff4xgc8,1579575296.0,Really? How do they get your medical records? Maybe you could move to an area that has more supports and confidentiality. All I'm saying is something is possible. Your life is more difficult due to bipolar but it's not impossible. Maybe check for free clinics. Support groups are like free therapy and could connect you with other resources. Check NAMI and DBSA.

bipolar,ff4uxgh,t3_ernnyd,1579573040.0,"Yes, if you start trying you will start to make steps towards a productive life. I may have changed jobs every 6 months when I was your age but I was working. Yes I did get fired a few times. Then I found another job. I worked in many different fields until I decided to go back to school in my late 20s for teaching. Teaching had given my life more purpose. I quit drinking and partying all night because I had to be a role model for my students. It's a really hard, stressful job but it also helps me stay on track. I have to show up each day. You can't just call in sick without writing sub plans which just isn't worth it. Anyway it's not for everyone but it works for me.

I think a lot of people your age go through what you are. It's not all unique to bipolar. It's the quarter life crisis. A lot of young adults finish school and then think their life will magical materialize. The American (or consumerist) dream can be very disillusioning. Very few 20 year olds are in their dream job. Most people do change careers numerous times. So don't worry about finding your calling right now. Just fine a job and do you best. You will learn from it and then you'll find another job and another. Until eventually you might get an idea of what you want to do. 

But you are right that there is stigma around mental illness and especially bipolar. So do NOT ever tell your job about your diagnosis. They do not need to know. You can just say you're sick, you do not need to say anymore than that. 

You're still so young. Adulting is hard for everyone and mental illness makes it that much harder. But you have to start somewhere. Do you have a psychiatrist and a therapist? Is there a support group you can go to? Are there some part time jobs that interest you? Working at a gas station is pretty chill as long at it's a safe place. Your customers come and go without too much demand or argument. A lot better than waiting tables. There's something out there you can do. Give it a try."
bipolar,ff4kjif,t3_erks3i,1579565841.0,"Ask your doc. What does he think it is? Why doesn't he think it's bipolar? You're allowed to ask him questions. If you ask and are still not getting answers, seek out another doc."

bipolar,ff4ix2f,t3_erm2su,1579564709.0,"Mania is not ""feeling good"". Mania is an elevated state which can cause a lot of negative feelings. I connect a lot with the term dysphoric mania. Others use the term mixed episode. It's hard to define these things in yourself at first. It's good to talk it over with doc. I use to different mood tracking apps. Dalio to note my overall mood (good or bad) and symptoms and side effects. Emoods help me track my mood states better. You can mark the level of depression, hypomania, anxiety, irritability, etc. On separate scales so you don't have to decide which it is. But for me elevated states are often hyped up and very angry."
loseit,ff0por5,t1_fezg8s2,1579471115.0,Maybe a deficit of 1400-1500 a day is too much.  To lose a pound a week you need a deficit of 500 a day.
bipolar,ff0395s,t3_eqtsac,1579464749.0,Bipolar mood disregulation is not just depression vs. Mania. Shifts in energy and sociability are common. Hypersexuality vs a lack of sexual desire. Feeling like a social butterfly vs feeling like a hermit.
bipolar,ff0278f,t3_eqnhvh,1579464440.0,"I think doubting our diagnosis can be a symptom in and of itself. Over confidence and euphoria can lead to the delusion that we are great, we have no issues, we're cured."

BipolarReddit,feph2qr,t3_eqau9h,1579320319.0,I think that's a very valid feeling to have. Hopefully you will be able to stay on the med and it will keep you from cycling. I've been medicated over two years now and it feels like lot of my day revolves around taking my meds. Kind of the inverse of an addict. Everyday I take my meds is a win. I have never been so stable in my whole life. I hope the meds keep working my whole life.

But if you're like me and think you're going to write a book to debunk scientific stats even though you've only taken two intro to stats classes, then you're manic. I may have some generalized ideas on the subject but I have zero real knowledge or expertise. The feeling of righteousness or innate truth does not make things true. I can believe we have some gifts, I really do. But there is a very fine line between productive creator and tortured soul. Personally I've glimpsed the black abyss enough in my life to take my meds and live a more rational life."
loseit,fepfo8a,t3_eqba1e,1579319324.0,"I did CrossFit for a little while. It was super hard but you know what, it's super hard for everyone. Even the most fit person in the room is working really hard. One day I was watching this woman finish up from the class before. Everyone else finished but she kept going. She was on the larger side but still much fitter than I was. Her determination was inspiring. I told her so after class and she said she felt like a failure because she didn't finish in the allotted time. Imo she worked harder than all the others. She pushed her limits. It also took me awhile to get used to the encouraging atmosphere. In CrossFit they write down your score at the end in front of everyone. At first I found this really humbling. But everyone celebrated everyone's effort. They are genuinely encouraging and positive. It sounds like your bootcamp crowd was too. Might just take some getting used to and develop more a sense of belonging. Joining any new group whether based around exercise or not can be uncomfortable. If your body liked it, maybe give your mind a chance to catch up by trying it a few more times."

In top of the tracking points I make one overall mood (horrible, bad, ehh, good, rad) for the day and journal a couple sentences. Emoods I use to track hours of sleep and rate the level (none, mild, moderate, severe) of my emotions: depression, hypomania, anxiety, and irritability. Then I also check of which meds I take. It's been super helpful journaling in this way because I can repay very clearly to doc how I've been doing since last appointment."

bipolar,fe60i3b,t1_fe605c1,1578879052.0,Well maybe just changing the timing would make a difference. Definitely worth asking. I take a large dose about two hours before bedtime. But I also take small doses all day long.
bipolar,fe5vhwr,t1_fe5swc2,1578875868.0,I started on just 25 mg and that would put me out. As my body adjusted I kept asking for more.  Now I'm up to 600/daily which seems to be working pretty well. Best I've ever been in my entire life. Sleep makes a world of difference.

I carry some with me in my purse at all times so I always have them.  I also keep my meds by the dog food.

BipolarReddit,fe499vb,t3_enp80z,1578856952.0,"I don't like the term mixed episode. It's just a term. I tend towards dysphoric mania. I think these terms are just created to help people explain that mood states are more complicated then simply depression vs euphoric mania. Sounds to me like you were experiencing euphoric mania with suicidal ideation. So you could call that a mixed episode or you could just call it euphoric mania with suicidality. I may not be as common but I think it totally fits typical bipolar behavior. Usually when some voice or message is telling someone to kill themselves they see that as negative but it would make sense to me that it could be felt as a positive, like you're fulfilling your spiritual calling. All your experiences are valid and unique."
bipolar,fe471y7,t3_enp9hc,1578856384.0,I can't. I take Seroquel every night.
bipolar,fe46u7b,t3_enpkzw,1578856316.0,Hallucinations are usually my first symptom that shows up. So I can be hallucinating and feel pretty normal otherwise. Also my hallucinations aren't always troubling. Definitely talk to your doc especially if you're having paranoia and your hallucinations are bothering you. But don't automatically be freaked out just because you are hallucinations. Psychotic symptoms get a really bad rap but they aren't always horrible. But call your doc.

I started having suicidal thoughts everyday on my drive home from work but I didn't think much of it at first. I didn't feel suicidal. I just thought about it a lot. I was always under the mindset that if I survived my 20s without a serious suicide attempt that I wasn't suicidal. But then Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington both died of suicide and they were older than me. I wondered how often they had thoughts of suicide but didn't feel suicidal. I wondered if, like me, they thought they were immune. I realized I couldn't really trust myself. It would only take a split second decision to turn my thoughts into a crash on my drive home. I sought out a diagnostic psychiatrist and was properly diagnosed at 39."

bipolar,fdzvb9o,t3_enf1ic,1578796651.0,It's called state dependent memory. Memories are linked to mental states. This is true for everyone. For example if you drink a bunch of coffee while studying for a test you will do better if your drink coffee before your test so your are in the same caffeine high state. This phenomenon is just more extreme for us with bipolar because our mood states are more extreme. When I'm depressed I can't remember ever not feeling depressed. When I'm feeling magical and seeking out a spiritual calling I don't remember the depression. When I read my journal it's almost like two totally separate timelines. When I'm manic I call men I had relations will years ago acting like no time had past. Also I really mix up my dreams with reality. So yeah my memory is totally unreliable.
BipolarReddit,fdyrrcq,t1_fdyr3jw,1578782881.0,That's my plan but I still feel uncomfortable with that. Seroquel makes me really drowsy and clumsy.

You have to stick with it to give it a chance to lessen your cycling. Reread my wave analogy. If it's having at tiny positive affect I strongly encourage you to stick with it. Mine started with just a good moment here or there. Then maybe a good day here or there. It takes time, a lot of time. 

Also, don't take more than your doc prescribed. There is a serious side effect of a life threatening rash that you can develop of you titrate up too quickly.

If you've felt some positive affects that's moving in the right direction. You also have to realize that it takes time to stop cycling. Picture your mood swings as a large occilating wave. It's not going to just stop suddenly with drugs. It slowly decreases in size get a little smaller and then a little smaller until one day you don't feel like you're on the rollercoaster any more. For me it's taken about two years since starting meds. We still are adjusting doses a little but overall I've hardly had any bad days in months now! So give meds a try. Listen to your doc, ask questions, take your meds as directed, and hang in there. It can get better."
bipolar,fdfouww,t3_el56bz,1578366677.0,"My memory is shit. So it helps me to use a mood tracking app to track my overall mood and side effects. Plus I write just a few notes about how the day went. Then I also have a notebook that I used as my bipolar journal for appointments with both pdoc and tdoc. Before I have an appointment I go back through all my entries in my app and take notes to share with doc. Just half a page to a whole page. I make 3 lists: positives, negatives and questions or topics to ask about. In this way I have a list ready to reference when my doc asks how it's going. It forces me to list some positives too and not just focus on the negative. You therapist could also help you with goal setting. I like""homework"" or assignments I need to complete before next meeting. Or you could all to work on a specific skill. In the past I don't a lot of time just practicing how to communicate with my irrational father. For me starting with a small list usually gets the ball rolling. Don't be afraid to so or tell them anything. That's what they are there for."
bipolar,fdctlff,t1_fdcsku2,1578283938.0,It's not stupid to be confused about hallucinations. I used to see things and think I was psychic. Now I'm not sure. I think most of my mystical experienced were just hallucinations but there are still a couple that confuse me.
bipolar,fdctded,t1_fdcg4vi,1578283760.0,You shouldn't be scared to tell your therapist anything. They can't help you if you don't tell them. Hallucinating is not a reason to hospitalize unless you are planning to hurt yourself or others.
bipolar,fdct7zo,t1_fdc8ti3,1578283644.0,"I don't think that minor hallucinations is a reason to go to the ER. Hallucinations and magical thinking are usually my first symptoms of an elevated state. So definitely talk to doc and get meds adjusted. But psychotic symptoms can be mild and harmless. He'll mine were sometimes even pleasant. If you're heading voices telling you to do something or hallucinating death or harm or something then you should go to hospital. But just minor, just be aware."
bipolar,fchesqs,t1_fcctrgb,1577649822.0,This. Bipolar episodes happen in cycles. If you are unmedicated it is inevitable that you will continue to cycle through depression and mania. The timing may be different for everyone but symptoms will always return at some point. This is why meds and mood tracking are important. Now that I'm medicated I can notice the early warning signs of an elevated state and adjust meds to avoid a full blown episode.
bipolar,fchbl6v,t1_fch7gb4,1577649006.0,"If you have bipolar and are unmedicated, it's inevitable that you will have another episode. It's only a question of when. I have bipolar 1 with rapid cycling so I've never really had bouts of stability in between episodes. Still I would encourage you to seek help now instead of waiting. It's been important for me to find meds that work and learn skills like DBT to help me cope when an episode begins. I know what my early warning signs are and I can ask for a med adjustment before things escalate. I've only been medicated a couple years but I'm hopeful that I can now avoid major episodes. For me meds make all the other strategies possible."
BipolarReddit,fch95fb,t3_eh5zoc,1577648435.0,My doc said that 200-600 is typical therapuetic dose but some people take up to 800. I think people using it for epilepsy may take even higher doses. Another thing my doc said was that lamotrigine can level you out so you aren't cycling anymore but that you're new baseline is on the depressed side. So he often had people start a antidepressant after they are on lamotrigine. I'm more on the manic side so this hasn't been the case  for me but he made it seem pretty common.
bipolar,fcgt2xh,t3_eh8koa,1577643746.0,Do you have a doc? Call them and ask for med adjustment. Are you on meds?
BipolarReddit,fc4f2fe,t3_eg4w0y,1577414802.0,"In sorry you're struggling. Hang on. Some things that help me:
1) Call doc for med adjustment. Are you on meds? I feel like meds are the number one reason I am living a productive life. It's a lot of work to maintain but I couldn't do any of it without meds.
2) Go to NAMI support group. It helps to be around others that understand. You can show up in your PJs and sit with your head down if you want. You don't have to say anything or your can ask for time and spill your guts. Either way I always feel a bit more connected.
3) Call a friend or family member. This is a hard one for me. I don't like to burden others but the few times I've managed it's only brought us closer. I suppose a hotline may work as a replacement if you don't want to burden others. I haven't tried, but I do have a number programmed into my phone just in case. Or chat with some in Reddit. You can send me a direct message if your like.
4) Celebrate tiny victories. This morning I only walked my dogs around the block, literally 1 block, but that counts as walking them today. I get to check that box.  Take a shower, put on clean clothes, and step outside. That's something! Start small.
5) Journal. I suppose it's not for everyone but I find spewing my rage and desperation on the page is cathartic.  
6) If you are in immediate danger, please go to the hospital. Just think then you don't have to do all those daily tasks. There are others to help take care of you for awhile. 

Life can get better. It can get easier. Please have faith and hang in there."
bipolar,fbyo3uo,t3_ef5kjt,1577221879.0,Caffeine is a stimulant. That's what simulants do. Just because it's legal and socially acceptable doesn't mean it's any less of a drug. Honestly caffeine affects me more negatively than cocaine.
