depression,fgemxc7,t1_fgaqi1r,1580703588.0,"I appreciate the offer, but you shouldn’t waste your time on me. Instead, I think you’d be better off helping those closer to you if they need it. Besides, people tend to be less willing to help me once I say the wrong things, which I always inevitably do. But thank you though."
depression,fgem9xc,t1_fgczgc9,1580703081.0,"Yep. But they can’t use anything against you if you don’t give them anything, so that’s what I’m gonna do."
depression,fgejrm1,t1_fgabmuz,1580701189.0,"I’m glad you’re okay with that concept. But the truth is, nobody is willing to listen. My own family definitely isn’t. I just have to “toughen up”. My issues don’t matter in my family if I’m not a girl. And if I think otherwise, then I’m not tough. But oh well. I guess it is what it is.

As for everyone else, I can’t tell everyone I know to go fuck themselves. Because then everyone would laugh, and the overwhelming sounds of their apathetic laughter would rupture my eardrums and make me deaf. But then again, I guess being deaf isn’t so bad. Because if I closed my eyes, I could be in the dark again, no sounds, no nothing. And then stay there until I reopen them, and see the same thing I did when my eyes were shut.

Also, as much as I want to believe that there are people willing to listen, I’ve been disappointed numerous times. And there are so many straws a camel can carry before his back breaks. But thank you for trying to help. I’ll be okay."
depression,fgej18w,t1_fgcmxdz,1580700667.0,"Don’t be sad. It won’t last long. Trust me. But until then, my mask will remain on. I appreciate your reassuring words, but you don’t need to waste them on me. There are plenty of others who need help. I wish I had been told this 2-3 years ago, but that’s not your fault.

Yep. That’s what people should accept. The premise of being human. But it seems that that isn’t what people want to see, or let alone encourage. If you show too much emotion, or complain slightly more than you should’ve, then you get ridiculed. Oh well. That’s what the mask is for. I don’t matter. Only the mask does.

I’m happy that you think I deserve to be happy with myself. If the world constantly told me that being myself was ok, instead of being the me that others aren’t inconvenienced by seeing, then I’d do that all the time. But the world is drenched in callous apathy. So it looks like I have to just “get over it”. So I have to keep all of myself to myself. Otherwise people will shame me for being out of line. 

I do hope the best for you though. I wish there were people like you."
depression,fge93st,t1_fgavwye,1580694175.0,Yep. That’s usually how it goes. I guess I just have to “deal with it” though.
depression,fge91lv,t1_fgddr81,1580694134.0,If only I had more people like you as friends. I wish more people thought like this. These days I’m not sure who I can truly open up to. I get disappointed 9/10 times.
depression,fge8usp,t1_fgc9gyl,1580694004.0,"Everyone has the right to show emotion. The problem is, it’s just something that people don’t like to see. Not truly. 

“Everyone has problems, but you know what? We deal with them like everyone else.”

“Choosing to act like this and feeling sorry for yourself isn’t gonna help you for shit.”

“If you choose to go through life with this attitude you’re never gonna be happy.”

Those are things I’m simply tired of hearing. I think they’re absolutely wrong. 

But what do I know? I’m not as old as they are. I don’t have “experience” like they do. My problems don’t matter."
KingdomHearts,ffhnz57,t1_ffhmnva,1579944627.0,"I’ll have you know that I used to be a manly man. Then I crossed paths with another manly man, who said to me: “WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, SOME KIND OF FUCKING MANLY MAN, BITCH?”

And I said: “Well, yeah.”

And then he looked me dead in the eyes, dropped his pants, and furiously shat on the asphalt, never for one moment breaking eye contact.

Then, after all the shit left his asshole, he calmly pulled his pants back up, rebuckled his belt, and said: “NOT SO MANLY NOW, ARE YOU MOTHERFUCKER?!”

And then I said to myself: “What the hell happened to my uncles coworker and why did he just pick up his own shit and fling it at a parked car?”

After that, I never associated myself with the term “manly man” ever again."

AskReddit,ffhagfq,t3_etkqrx,1579927879.0,Make it so that those who deserve to be punished for the shitty things they did but got away with it get triple of the punishment they deserve. Although this will usually depend on how severe their crimes were.
AskReddit,ffgy8dl,t3_etcyd6,1579918132.0,"Tbh I’m probably gonna be added to that stigma close to the end of this year. People aren’t gonna remember anything said in this thread, it’ll all be forgotten pretty quickly. That’s just how things are gonna be, and it doesn’t seem like there’s much we can do to stop that from happening. I know I’m not gonna survive this year, but that’s ok. Leaving this world permanently is far less terrifying than remaining a living tenant in this hell we’ve created for ourselves. Memento Mori. It’ll be nice to get some rest, whether it be brief, or eternal."

AskReddit,fdm8nwl,t3_ekkw94,1578542545.0,"Nowhere near as bad as all of Reddit makes it out to be. Is it incredibly flawed? Yes. Is it expensive? Definitely. Is it shitty in some areas? Absofuckinglutely. But guess what? Not every area in that state is fucking LA or SF. My hometown for instance is a great example. I loved living there and I want to move back. 

Sure it isn’t easy to live there, but if you choose to live in the 2 big popular cuties where EVERYONE is moving, then no shit you’re gonna have a bad time. But if you’re living somewhere like say San Diego, or even Santa Clarita which I’ve heard good things about, then you’ll have a much better experience.

I’m so fed up with the constant hating on California when plenty of other places (Like Las Vegas, Camden, South Side Chicago, Albuquerque, Gary, etc) are far worse. Hell I’ve heard Compton of all places is getting better these days. It’s not quite there yet but slowly it’s happening. And I guarantee that if any of the above places I mentioned were stationed in California they’d get a lot more hate because Reddit has a throbbing hate boner for the fucking place, and it just doesn’t deserve it nearly as much as others. 

All these other places are vigorously defended by their locals despite their many many flaws, but the places in CA? Nah man, they’re totally the shittiest places on Planet Earth and deserve to be ridiculed to high heaven. So fucking annoying. Go to South America and see how fucking good you have it compared to here. As much as I hate saying that, I feel I have no choice because I swear the CA haters are convinced that the state they despise so much is practically a third world country and it’s just not.

Anyways rant over."
unpopularopinion,fdjixkd,t3_ekcbjw,1578472931.0,"Redditors on this sub: Everywhere in California is a shithole, and not worth defending in any way!

Also redditors on this sub when they see a gambling, crime ridden corrupt cesspool city just barely on the side of Nevada (a state that, mind you, we used to test FUCKING NUKES ON) on the California/Nevada border: Ehhh...that place isn’t so bad.  BUT CALIFORNIA THO REEEEEEEEEE"
