I don't have to worry about seizures, but I do get relapses caused by sleep deprivation! In fact, sleep is so incredibly important for my health that if I go two nights with less than 6 hours of sleep, my doctor has me take Xanax, not for anxiety, but just so that it will knock me out. It's extremely important that I sleep! I can totally see how those two things can be related for you!"

I’m just someone who is satisfied with more carbs. Additionally, I’m not crazy about meat, so it wasn’t super sustainable. Which stinks because it cleared up a health issue for me."
