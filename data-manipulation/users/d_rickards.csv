AskReddit,ffg8tln,t3_etcyd6,1579900940.0,"All the progress on feminist issues over the last half century have been aimed at making women equal to men.  


It is my opinion that this important objective has been advanced incorrectly. Rather than breaking down the social constructs of what it means to be male/masculine we have simply looked for ways to move women closer to this ideology.  


What we need to do is remove some of the constructs in the first place.   


For example, in friendships men will not use eachother's names but instead call each other buddy, pal, bro etc... this creates emotional distance between men that women don't experience. Additionally women are much more likely to embrace as a greeting while men will shake hands; further isolating the male psyche.   


There are so many more pronounced and important aspects to this, but in large part I see men as isolated and lacking true connection with others.   


If I were not married with children it would be very likely that no human being would have touched more than my right hand in the past month. That lack of human contact would be very damaging to my psyche."

You absolutely use your lower body when punching, if you rely only on your upper body to punch in a hockey fight you will get absolutely destroyed because you will be off balance on your skates and easily taken down. Not using your legs is how you fall over on skates.

I don't know a lot about MMA...but I gather that committing fully to a punch would leave you really exposed for so many other attacks and takedowns.   


As a result of this it always seems to me that their punches are mechanically different and only about 60% of the power that the athlete could generate.  


It also seems to me that, despite the fact that I am a pretty robust guy, one of these 60% punches would send me to next week. Part of me would like to find out, like if I trained a little and stepped into the ring with someone in this weight class (155lbs) how badly would they knock me out despite my 50lb weight advantage."

AskReddit,ff677pv,t1_ff5vdc9,1579620774.0,"I did some Ins. Def. work early in my career.

Plaintiff was 375lbs, massively obese man. He routinely travelled SE Asia on ""vacation"" and would come home needing treatment for various STIs (it was pretty clear he was travelling to have sex with minors and sex traffic victims). We get to review medical records for plaintiffs.

His injury? He was walking, stepped off the curb and broke his foot, that caused him to fall breaking his arm as he put it out to brace himself. The curb was 3cm off grade so he sued the municipality. He fell because he was too fat and pathetic to step down 15cm instead of 12cm and that caused three bones in his foot to break.

In surgery he developed compartment syndrome in the leg and was now using a mobility walker to get around. He had not lost his sedentary job, and really he was headed toward the walker anyway. He was 33 years old.

In discovery, on the record, he said he would settle for $200,000.00 because that would let him sell his house and move to the country in SE Asia that he liked to visit (I can't recall which one) where he could ""have sex whenever he wanted for only a few dollars"".  This was all on the discovery record, I asked if he was talking about prostitutes, his lawyer objected before he could answer (which was the correct thing to do). He ranted about how he couldn't have sex in Canada because it was ""too difficult to make that happen"". His lawyer was pissed that he said the amount on the record.

Him saying ""too difficult to make that happen"" stuck in my head, was he saying because he was so fat, or was it because of his preferences? I had represented some prostitutes on criminal charges as a law student and they only cared about whether the guy could pay, so I was left feeling like it was kids.

Basically I had to advise my client that we should settle for an amount that was going to let this fat POS fly out of country to a place where he could live off the interest and molest all the children he wanted to for the remainder of his disgusting pathetic life.

The Ins Co. settled immediately.  


\[EDIT: a lot of comments saying I am wrong for recommending to my client to settle. A lawyer's job is to obtain the best result for the client. Settling for $200k was a very good result in this case as there was strict liability for a statutory breach by the municipality. What he did with the money (or what I suspected he would do with it) is of no relevance to the insurer or the defendant and was not part of my legal opinion as it was only my strong suspicion and had no bearing on the case.\]"

Plaintiff was 375lbs, massively obese man. He routinely travelled SE Asia on ""vacation"" and would come home needing treatment for various STIs (it was pretty clear he was travelling to have sex with minors and sex traffic victims). We get to review medical records for plaintiffs.

His injury? He was walking, stepped off the curb and broke his foot, that caused him to fall breaking his arm as he put it out to brace himself. The curb was 3cm off grade so he sued the municipality. He fell because he was too fat and pathetic to step down 15cm instead of 12cm and that caused three bones in his foot to break.

In surgery he developed compartment syndrome in the leg and was now using a mobility walker to get around. He had not lost his sedentary job, and really he was headed toward the walker anyway. He was 33 years old.

In discovery, on the record, he said he would settle for $200,000.00 because that would let him sell his house and move to the country in SE Asia that he liked to visit (I can't recall which one) where he could ""have sex whenever he wanted for only a few dollars"".  This was all on the discovery record, I asked if he was talking about prostitutes, his lawyer objected before he could answer (which was the correct thing to do). He ranted about how he couldn't have sex in Canada because it was ""too difficult to make that happen"". His lawyer was pissed that he said the amount on the record.

Him saying ""too difficult to make that happen"" stuck in my head, was he saying because he was so fat, or was it because of his preferences? I had represented some prostitutes on criminal charges as a law student and they only cared about whether the guy could pay, so I was left feeling like it was kids.

Basically I had to advise my client that we should settle for an amount that was going to let this fat POS fly out of country to a place where he could live off the interest and molest all the children he wanted to for the remainder of his disgusting pathetic life.

The Ins Co. settled immediately.  


\[EDIT: a lot of comments saying I am wrong for recommending to my client to settle. A lawyer's job is to obtain the best result for the client. Settling for $200k was a very good result in this case as there was strict liability for a statutory breach by the municipality. What he did with the money (or what I suspected he would do with it) is of no relevance to the insurer or the defendant and was not part of my legal opinion as it was only my strong suspicion and had no bearing on the case.\]"

They ship it from store to store, they don't go to the manufacturer for it. That's what the LCBO is ultimately, a warehousing and logistics business.
