There are of course countless who are mentally troubled, but do we discount all who claim to have seen an Angel, encountered the Holy Spirit? NDEs? Even the abduction phenomina deserves our honest and considerable inquiry.  (NDEs might be an exception as we have tangible evidence and witnesses to hundreds of famous cases, patients reporting on activity in other rooms while legally dead or under anesthesia). Please don't mistake my desire for further discussion as flippant, I truly think that you are hasty to discount an entire field of human testimony because it challanges orthodoxy on the subject, surely is the only rational explanation is that they are all mistaken?

I still contend that there could be absolute and ultimate meaning, but it is likely to be shadowed and only echoed for the human man to perhaps glean fragments throughout the eons. And that I sincerely doubt that a single human mind will ever be able to grasp all of it, if it truly did exist. I think that would be asking a man to contain God in his own mind, impossible by catagory of definition. Instead we should emphasize a journey to find it, and create it where we find little.

I'm paraphrasing but his argument is something along the lines of ""Grace doesn't really make any sense and most German's won't understand what that means, so I changed it to ""who pleases the lord"" because that's really what Grace is anyways""
