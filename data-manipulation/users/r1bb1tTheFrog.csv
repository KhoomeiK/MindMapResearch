AskReddit,fecbouk,t3_eo3oky,1578970265.0,"My grandma screaming last year around 10:00 pm. We ran to her room to see what was happening, and she was in the middle of a nightmare, eyes closed, screaming and kicking her legs.

She survived the Holodomor in 1932 and 1933, and she was having a nightmare that soldiers had come for her and were dragging her away by her feet.

I think I'm gonna go give my grandma a call now"
