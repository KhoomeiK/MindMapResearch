OldSchoolCool,fdr1btt,t1_fdomgpy,1578678160.0,"Thats interesting to know, i guess if the Americans had thought they are merely defening asians against asians,  it would have been more like Vietnam. Do you think the fact that the USA was much more authoritarian against the people that did protest the war, often giving them long prison sentences for Sedition, as well as possible soviet influence in the anti-vietnam protests played a part?

I still find it strange that the Anti-vietnam protests were much milder int he USA than in Germany. As war as i Know, US protests were not openly supporting the North vietnamese and never attacking US soldiers"
