StrongCurves,ffumei5,t3_ev902b,1580245032.0,"I just googled ""140 degree squat"" because I wanted to know wtf that even looked like and found studies from several different years saying that peak glute growth was 90°, or one saying that it was actually 140° but even better with a wider stance. So it's all over the damn place, which is confusing af
  
  *But all of them did say that quad growth was greatest at 90°"

You don't really have any place to comment on a whole relationship based on one negative thing. So."

He comes back and he had gotten one for me. It was the start of my shift so I appreciated it a lot and it was a good $4-5 value tip! Was super thankful."

GenderCritical,ffgbaly,t3_etczw1,1579902458.0,Yup I had been telling my boyfriend all the reasons I didn't like him watching porn and why I feel hurt by it but the thing that made him stop was watching a Ted (or tedx idk) talk by a man talking about how he stopped. Was pissed about it for weeks. Still salty that he wouldn't just fuckin listen to me...
GenderCritical,ffei29e,t1_ffcw2g8,1579848860.0,Yes when I first joined I thought the no sleep sub was weird as fuck because they tell the story as if it happened to them and is totally real. It was just a really weird concept to me 5 years ago.
GenderCritical,ffehw9l,t3_esxoks,1579848664.0,I think Reddit is a terrible place to talk in detail about anything traumatic like that they should be talking to a fucking therapist and real life people I just don't think this is a good platform for personal shit like that at all so I agree.
relationships,ffefic3,t1_ffe7r6k,1579846039.0,"He wasn't hiding what he enjoyed he was hiding who he enjoyed doing it with, which is weird. Maybe OP felt like he would rather spend time with the girl than her? She should have talked to her husband about that, maybe expressed some interest in art history so that he could gush about it to her."

vegan,ffap23u,t1_ffan019,1579741148.0,That's crazy!!! I feel so bad for those helpless animals :( it was a video of a supposedly high standard factory farm where they neglected the pigs so much by not feeding them ever they started eating each other and were too weak to stop each other. If that's a high standard one I don't even wanna know a low standard one......
im14andthisisdeep,ffaf110,t1_ffaeorb,1579734182.0,I mean not really they're usually really shallow feel good messages like you'll have a good social life. These were a different tone

unpopularopinion,ff8jl1y,t3_es5f89,1579681508.0,Simple fix to this: give twitch thots no attention and they won't have a job. They only do it because they make money so if the money declines they won't do it.
bulletjournal,ff7asy8,t1_ff7amri,1579644916.0,Okay! There are still variations in number of squares per page. I've had 2 A5s and my current one is 26×39 squares but my last one was 25×38 because the margins were bigger so if they're going to help you with the layout that might be a better way to scale it! Happy journaling :)
bulletjournal,ff6skp7,t1_ff6iils,1579634006.0,"You can Google the notebook on targets website and it should say or you could do it like searching the paper sizes and measuring your notebook with a ruler. A5 is like ~5""×8"" and A4 is the normal letter size 8.5""×11"" if it's in between that, it's B5. But some of them have different sized squares or different sized margins so it might be more helpful to that redditor to count how many squares down and across it is."

Lady comes in to return spray paint I'm pretty sure we don't have.   
I try to scan it anyway, and an error message comes up that means we literally do not even sell the item at all.  
Me: it looks like we don't have the item here. Perhaps you got it from Home Depot which is right behind this store?  
Lady: no, I definitely bought it here.  
Me: okay let me just double check with paint department.  
I walk over to show him the can, he confirms we don't sell that kind.  
Me: yep, definitely don't have it. I'd try home Depot.  
Lady: no, let me check the isle.   
She checks, can't find it.
A back and forth with me being like ""no"" and her being like ""yes"" for a bit.  
Me: it's also in a Home Depot bag...  
Lady INSISTS she bought it here. I seriously was so done after this exchange I just......"

AskWomen,ff1qgke,t3_eqxs0f,1579483911.0,"Actually treated us like a person, listened to us, and had a mutual respect. Actively engaged in our lives and got to know our friends and interests. As opposed to my dad, who ran the house like a totalitarian government and I wouldn't tell anything to because he was never interested so he decided to get to know me by reading all of my diaries. Needless to say I have a shit relationship with him. As I'm getting older it's getting better though.
  
  
She would also allow open communication to where we could tell her things and she would be supportive and not judge us. My dad turned everything into a life lesson and went from 0-100 pissed level real quick."

veghumor,feoh24j,t3_eq3ssd,1579299988.0,"When i told my family I was going meatless, my southern family (my cousin has a ROOM dedicated to his taxidermy hobby. Ick) they were super chill and accepting of it and just said okay cool!   
  
  My northern family was extremely judgmental and made a joke about it every time I saw them like ""I won't tell anyone if you eat meat when it's just us 2"". So it was just funny to me that my side of the family that hunts was more chill than my non-hunting family. A few years later the same northern cousin was asking me for tips on how I started cutting meat out."

relationships,fek6f3a,t1_fejvmjx,1579193578.0,Yeah dinner with a platonic friend is weird. I dated a guy with 99% girl friends and even he usually only went to lunch with girl friends if they were in town and he hadn't seen them in a while otherwise it was usually his group of 3-4 friends.
GenderCritical,feh9npy,t3_eopxwo,1579112037.0,So I just watched the video and he's only 25.... And by the story his mom really wanted a girl and the mom let nikkie be a girl from a really young age and got hormones by 14. I definitely think that letting kids transition is not at all okay so I wonder how much of this decision was swayed by his mom REALLY wanting a girl like it almost sounds like a case of child abuse a bit.
