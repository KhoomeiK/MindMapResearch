Most lawyers are willing to do simple pre-court cease and desist letters for a low flat fee (I've seen it for between free and $50). Even if you are underage it's worth asking a lawyer if there is any way they can help you and your little sister.

By making you and your sister ""famous"" she is actively endangering you. Every influencer has psycho fans. What if one decided they wanted to kidnap you or your sister for ransom? They'd know exactly what you look like, and very likely exactly when, where, and what you're wearing."

My main advice with tampons is... Try to not use them when your period is about to end if you can avoid it. Pulling out a dry tampon is one of the worst experiences ever."

Break it up into small pieces. Keep breaking it up until its bite sized.

For example, if its an essay:

Read prompt, take notes on prompt for key items, decide on topic/focus, generate generic essay outline, read at least 2 articles on the topic/focus that you could possibly use (take notes on what the article has said that seems relevent so you can find it faster later), generate proper citations for articles you decide you'd use, apply outline detail/header sentences. Apply outline detailed extro/introducting new paragraph sentences. Fill these two sentence paragraphs with stuff from your sources, and stuff you enterpreted from the sources. 

Do one of the above things. Set a timer, and take a ten minute break. Rinse at repeat."

IDontWorkHereLady,ffxw3qp,t1_ffqwncy,1580333571.0,"In this case, he is wrong to harass his ""neighbor"" partially because he wasn't actually a guest at that hotel and partially because anyone with two brain cells to rub together knows that the key cards are all keyed different. So either he's a genuine complete dunce or he had ulterior motives and was playing dumb. Why else would he get aggressive that she didn't want to hand him the key?

His story is unbelievable because even without your name on the room, hotel management is willing to help check if someone who is in the room will vouch for you. 

But the real reason he wasn't on any rooms is because he wasn't an actual guest. I've never been to a hotel that didn't at least informally ask me for the first and last names of others staying with me to note down in case of lockout. 

It's not at all baseless when the evidence adda up. You're just playing dumb to gaslight women into letting strange drunk aggressive men have control over the key to private spaces.

Noone owes anyone anything. So fuck off and ask someone who's getting paid."

So either its an insult, or you do care about autistic people. Not neither. Not both. 

If my rhetoric was wrong then why is noone agreeing with you?

PS, asking an offensive question and getting called out for it doesn't mean you didn't mean it. That's a shitty bullshit excuse  to try to wheedle out of having responsibility for your own behavior."

I wasn't ever here to have a debate. You didn't ask for my consent nor did you conduct yourself appropriately for this to have even once held the facade of being a ""debate""...

I feel that statement so hard. It's almost exactly what my nmom's ex-friend said to her about me when my mom kicked me out with only the clothes on my back. Ex-friend had one kid in jail and the other recovering from addiction. My crime? I locked my bedroom door a few days after I had a talk with nmom about going through my things because she loses my daily necessities then screams at me when I ask her where she put them... I thought she understood but she almost immediately ""organized"" my room and started screaming when I asked where my phone's charge cord was...so it's no real surprise that I took to locking my door and ""accidentally"" leaving my stepdad's locksmithing equipment in the trunk of my car lol."

>When first asked about allowing “bio queens” (cisgender female drag queens) to compete, he seemed firmly against it. “Drag loses its sense of danger and its sense of irony once it’s not men doing it,” he said. When pressed to explain how this policy would translate to trans women, particularly with regard to Peppermint — the season nine runner-up and the show’s first openly trans contestant — RuPaul’s answer was not only disappointingly short-sighted, it was dangerous in its implications.

>“Peppermint didn’t get breast implants until after she left our show,” he said. “She was identifying as a woman, but she hadn’t really transitioned.” In one fell swoop, RuPaul managed to alienate an entire community of transgender and non-binary drag queens, while also trivializing Peppermint’s transition, boiling it down to a surgical procedure. “You can identify as a woman and say you’re transitioning, but it changes once you start changing your body,” he continued. “It changes the whole concept of what we’re doing.”

Friendly reminder that he kicked Peppermint off the show, not because of her skills, but because she came out as a transwoman. And he outed her on national television."
