Once certified start own business. GF and happiness will come later. that's 1 plan if your that lost.

depression,fdwgvj0,t1_fdvmwvp,1578758544.0,"I'm in a mindset where I need a new experience to hold back my depression, I can't stand 9-5 jobs minimum wage (at this point in my life) I literally almost climbed out of this black hole and now I'm up at 5am staring at a blank wall wanting to die, cause my future seems so shit, and I know people say just try again in a year, but I don't think I can handle another 12 months in bed. I can't handle my life being on pause idk if u will get it but yeah."
