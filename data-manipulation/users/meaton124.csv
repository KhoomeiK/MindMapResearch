SuicideWatch,ff8xt8a,t3_esbtte,1579699554.0,"Remember though that people have heard this statement often. The issue isn't meditation and positive thoughts as those will often make things worse for those of us who have a depressed my anxiety riddled mind. Instead, the option is to offer support and continue to do so."

We'll see what happens, but I for one invite time away merely to have a breather for work..."
Daylio,ff0hdib,t3_eq4oq7,1579468897.0,"Sure. Look at it like this.

You want to improve by reducing something. Most companies improve by reducing waste, right? They improve by reducing wasted time and efforts and material.

You simply want to think about it as a way to improve by reduction. If you have 4 sodas a day, then phrase it as 1 soda a day. You are still reducing your soda, you just aren't putting it in a negative tone.

Also, see if you can do that for a few weeks by giving yourself something you can measure and a time you want to get that done. Don't do SMART goals, just do the MT goals."
Daylio,ff0gntx,t3_eqajss,1579468687.0,"Yep, mine looks the same. January is hard, especially when you are trying to make changes. Perhaps this would be a little clearer with some more daily entries. I noticed that I wasn't down most of the time if I managed to get four points of data a day. This month, I have been pretty bad about it."
Daylio,ff0cx4c,t3_er25zu,1579467680.0,"That's an interesting idea. I haven't explored it yet, but then I don't tend to put out goals and habits. Still, there are a few you can tag.

Lack of motivation  
Too complicated  
No vision  
No next step  
External Forces  
Distractions (broken down by distraction)

EDIT: well, this was a good way to tie this into some of my monitoring, so I squeezed in some goals just to see. Thanks for the suggestion!"
depression,fepvv22,t3_eqdit8,1579333167.0,"I have suffered abuse by the hands of my parents and grandparent. At this point I can tell you the road to trust is a very long road.

You are taking the best step which is getting your definition down and understanding some of the issues at hand. With that knowledge and power, you can start building trust.

It is possible.

Much like trying to learn to play a violin, it will take a long time to master a fraction of the trust needed. Don't get discouraged. Work on little things."
depression,fen05ky,t3_eq1b9v,1579273992.0,"This is what happens when you repress what is the most important thing to you, right? 

I know it is tough, but you might have to tell your mother about this and make sure this gets off your chest. It is hard living with a lie and can lead to situations where the pain from your mother shaming you is far better than trying to take your own life.

Speak your truth because you never know when your tale might help someone else who ends up in the same situation you would and feels the same way."
depression,femzw4b,t3_eq1chh,1579273816.0,"You're still dealing with the pain and hurt. Your emotions are still trying to show themselves. If anything, you need to feel those feelings instead of turning away from them.

I might recommend a book called ""The Body Keeps the Score."" It is a great book on how to notice when and how you aren't dealing with the emotions you are feeling."
depression,femzm3x,t3_eq1cjo,1579273628.0,"I was a little older than you when my mother sold me to her father to keep the lights on. I was violated by that man more than a few times that week.

I am 43 now, 30 years later, and I am still here. It has been tough, suicide ideation and lack of trust. Still, I encourage you to keep going. I know it is tough. I know your parents don't care, but you set yourself a goal to get away from them as soon as you possibly can.

When you are away from the situation, you will notice some of the anger and pain will subside. Not all of it. It won't go away. But you'll notice how strange your family really was.

I know it is tough, but keep going. Focus on getting away from them as soon as you possibly can."
resumes,fej4jku,t3_epfgud,1579156633.0,"Simple. Results.

You have no results, no improvements, and thus no impact on the reader. You wasted 1/2 of your first page on things they can get from you on the interview.

They spend 30 seconds finding a reason why they should deny you. If I were hiring, your resume would give me a little anxiety and I would file it away.

Try to get the last three jobs. Get into the improvement and successes with data behind it. This is to get your foot in the door to sell yourself, not a place for a novel."
dfsports,feaq21h,t3_enqbgk,1578951240.0,"As one of the few that had Coleman in my Captain spot, I knew that was the player I was afraid of as a recovering Vikings fan. I also knew the 33% ATS for Cousins when he doesn't play at 1pm.

Of course, I also set three other lineups that would fit a specific script. It is a little easier to do with just two teams, but it always helps to dig deep and leave money on the table."

You asked your brain to watch out for situations like this and your brain is doing what you asked. Just remember to give it some slack and also give it some new orders. Remind it you are safe."
depression,fca253t,t3_egqg5d,1577561908.0,"The one thing they usually leave out is the blind luck / good timing. 

You can work hard and set yourself up, but if your timing is off then you are a cautionary tale instead.

It is the Cult of Success that cherry-picks these stories and spreads them around because they fit the narrative, not because they happen often.

Don't get caught up in the myth."
depression,fc7kcmy,t1_fc7jty2,1577510213.0,"Actually, not at all obvious. 

We all use something to escape. Sailors drunk heavily to allow the hours of isolation to slip away. People in power use it as a way to gain confidence in others. People not in power use it as a way to empower them.

Most believe they will find the answer at the bottom of a bottle, while a few will know the bottle is merely a tool to use.

You find the answer to WHY the drink is applied, then you find the flower of the problem. You find the flower of the problem, you can start digging deeper and understanding where the roots are. You find the roots, you find a reason to pull the flower and leave the healthy ground behind.

Not all answers are simple. All lives have many vines and roots that will never go away.

So, again I ask... Why apply the drink?

If I take the original post at face value, it is to apply power to the powerless. The juice gives the power to open up and speak when sobriety and fear will restrict and restrain. So, what sacrifice does this require to maintain this openness?

Continual use of the product AND the inability to remember everything clearly. Power without benefits.

Is there a better way to empower the voice to speak without the bottle? Is there a reason why the voice is restricted? Who helped this person restrict their voice and not speak their truth? What isolation are they trying to chase away?

As with most problems, you work your way backward. You ask why until you get to where you believe you need to go, then you ask why again until you get uncomfortable. Then you ask why again. It works in manufacturing and quality assurance standards. It works in improving your day to day life. It works on your psychology.

So... Shall we continue and wait for the actual answer or do you have something you would like to add to this? I am open to all forms of discussion, but reactionary is usually not the best way to maintain and keep dialogue and discourse open."
depression,fc7cw7s,t3_egleha,1577503735.0,"You are turning off the parents in your brain, but you are also allowing your base brain to be in charge. It means no filters, but it also means you can take things a lot more personally.

depression,fc5l9w9,t1_fc5l0n6,1577460614.0,"Note I didn't say anything about you not loving her. I have no doubt you love her.

I doubt you need to be married at this moment. 

You even expressed it here. You doubt being good enough for her. You doubt you are enough. That is enough to warrant a reason why. Is it because of her? No. Is it because of you? No.

Where does this doubt really come from? Is there something from your past or something you might have modeled as a perfect marriage that you might not be meeting? Is there something you might not achieve because it is strictly impossible to do so?

I am merely spitballing here to see what might be at the root of this particular issue. I also want nothing but the best for you both and I want this to last for a long time, but it will not if you cannot expose things like this."
depression,fc5ko08,t3_egc6h4,1577460169.0,"The other thing to consider here is your stance on marriage in the first place. 

Hesitation means no, right? If you are doubting this and you are not verbalizing the doubt because you don't want to hurt her feelings, then you are going to find some other way to express it.

While I would never doubt anyone and their love, sometimes one must examine everything and make sure there are no roots in the way to growth."

Again, this is a gaslighter telling you this. Control. It is like a cult, except it is for a mortal man with an amazing amount of flaws.

That is gaslighting. That is torture. You are reacting because you don't want to let them go and you believe if you keep acting the way they wanted you to, they would come back.

I was a victim of gaslighting. I know how it works and how it changes the mind and the soul.

You might need to detach from that view if you want to have a better view of your life and your mental health.

You are betraying yourself to an ideal that no one can ever achieve. Even in the most ""pure"" race out there, you will have a slight percentage of most other races simply because of the multiple thousands of years of breeding.

You're a prisoner of ideals. It is time to set yourself free."
depression,fc4qim5,t3_eg6uig,1577424771.0,"So the better question is why do you want to die? Not questioning your need to do so, but there must be a root cause here that can help shed some light on why you might feel this way and also give you a reason to keep going."
depression,fc4qbty,t3_eg6w6f,1577424591.0,"This is understandable, which is why you really want to scout out a ""third place"" if you can. This is a place where you can relax and feel comfortable without having to hunt for friends. Someplace like a coffee shop, a restaurant, or even a pub. 

The more you show up, the more the staff will notice. They will keep talking to you and have you keep showing up. They will introduce you to people they know, so you can bypass the need to vet them since they know people you know. You will eventually find some people who you can really connect with while not pressuring yourself to do anything other than show up and have a drink of tea.

It seems tough at first, but it is worth the time and effort. I've met a lot of great people who care while doing this. It has helped me take the edge off of my own depression, knowing I can go to my third place and get a normal hit of some sanity."

You must also balance your own self-care. You cannot keep giving without receiving as well. You may think you are doing well now, but you might also be making things worse by allowing him to take more than is warranted.

Balance is the key but finding other people to help you will be better in the long run. We all need people who we can turn to, especially in our time of need."
depression,fc4pl4r,t3_eg61g8,1577423884.0,"I can chime in here as well. I also don't know love, but that is due to the abuse inherent in my family. I was sold to be used as a sexual toy, gaslit to believe it was love, and replaced by my parents with someone who they could cherish without having to pay attention to their actual child.

All this being said, it is an issue with trust. You cannot love if you cannot trust. Love and trust take a measure of faith and belief in the person in question. If your natural instinct is to know they will let you down, then you know you will struggle with the concept of love.

This is normal and natural in trauma. You may not ever come out of it with an idea of what true love CAN be, but if you know your limits you will be far better than you expect. 

Talk to someone about this trauma and what you feel. Let them hear what you have to say. Holding it in does you no good and it will only serve to drag you down."
depression,fbrsvvj,t3_edvvhg,1577045999.0,"You have a lot of answers from us, but I think the one thing to consider is why you are not cutout and what you are expecting versus what you see.
