This is absolutely blowing my mind. I knew that crows were smart, but to the point that they figured out sledding whether through trial and error or through observation ... the fact that they found out about it and find enjoyment and fun through doing it ... just blows my mind"
teenagers,ffemm30,t1_ffdlxy1,1579854642.0,"There's definitely a big part of that playing into it. Whether they want to live vicariously through your success, or because they legitimately just want you to be successful ... that's shitty parenting regardless. You tried with what you can, and that's what matters. B- really isn't even a bad grade, so don't trip. It's unfortunate that your parents had to treat you that way, and I don't know your relationship with your parents so I don't want to assume anything. But if they're actual shitty parents in general, know that's not your fault. You didn't get to choose to be born to them, and they definitely don't get to treat you like shit just because they birthed you and took care of you growing up. Your parents will be the imperfect and flawed people they are, don't try to live up to their standards. Live up to your own, be the person you want yourself to be. Much love from another internet stranger. 

PS: I know that you may even beat yourself up for getting a B-  even without your parents yelling at you, but let me tell you this. This fucked up society has somehow equated success with getting the perfect grades, getting into the best colleges, and etc. That's a load of horse shit, life is so much more than grades and good colleges and career. If that's the standard for success, then people have the wrong idea of what true success is about."

Best they can do is take off their blazers, but that's it. With it being colder, people can bring outerwear like cardigans, sweaters, etc, to keep warm."

Dogfree,ff5fxnw,t1_ff5cv4w,1579591146.0,"This seems the most reasonable one. Keeping a medium high fence will fix this issue, unless the owners are somehow so damn retarded and ill-willed that they would open your gate and go inside to let their dogs shit on your lawn."
Dogfree,ff5fpwo,t3_erkw5m,1579590878.0,"Honestly, it's ridiculous that people would be willing to spend 10k and literally put themselves into debt for a dog, or any pet for that matter. They're not human, and they're definitely not an actual blood family member. No matter how they may feel like family, they are not the same as your mother or father or sister or brother. The chemo isn't even going to cure the dog, they'll probably have to continue doing it until it again once lymphoma resurfaces again as the writer said that it's incurable. What will you do then, put yourself even more in debt? Take out a fucking loan with your house or car as collateral? Jesus, as sad as the situation is, these dog nutters need to understand the ridiculousness of having to spend such ridiculous amounts of money on a pet that will probably pass within a handful of years at best anyhow. Do your pet a favor and let it die, instead of subjecting it to further pain and misery for the remainder of its life."
Dogfree,ff5f3s7,t1_ff3jk3o,1579590140.0,"If it was me, I'd go talk to him to set things straight because it seems he already dislikes you. Might as well get my say in if you already dislike me. I'd shit on him for being a superbly irresponsible dog owner and point out that it was all of his fault and you were basically being a nice person and trying to help him out by holding his parcel. I know this wouldn't solve anything, especially if it's a dog nutter, but I'd do it just to get my own frustrations out. Burn that bridge to the ground."
Dogfree,ff5et9s,t3_ern2ic,1579589804.0,"Why the fuck are you staying with him? From the way you're stating it, it's apparent that you're sick of this shit, and are being treated less than the guy's shitty dog. At this point, if your bf refuses to change anything about this, it's your responsibility to pull yourself out of that and away from being treated less than a dog because it seems he won't change. You continuing to subject yourself to this by staying is also disrespect to yourself imo. At a certain point, there's no one to blame but yourself if you choose to continue to be with him."

Documentaries,feklc7q,t1_feiwjxr,1579202438.0,"Underneath their ""cool"" persona lies a mountain of issues. Their suicide rates are extremely high, their work culture is toxic and is literally killing their own people, many are xenophobic, and so on and on. A good chunk of their culture is very toxic and unhealthy, but their people have just accepted it as a norm, and due to their conformistic tendencies they will not voice up anything and will also ignore, ostracize, or criticize the rare few that do. There is no freedom, because if you choose to not conform with the culture, then you're shunned and treated poorly."
