gamecollecting,ffdlzyo,t1_ffdc962,1579823721.0,"Maybe you should learn to buy the ""fucking games"" better if you can't handle the truth about how these will all drop in price significantly in the next few months to a year for cib copies for a fraction of what you say you paid for these loose rental discs. 

I also want to play some of these but I know they're all extremely common to find used copies of, and I have plenty of other stuff to keep me occupied until the price drops on the cib copies of these titles, which is what I prefer to collect. That's just *my* preference, don't get so fucking uppity and defensive about us pointing out how cib copies will be cheaper than what you paid if you just wait a little. Sorry I'm not loaded with money and so impatient I have to get them and have to em right fuckin now, unlike yourself apparently. 

Maybe I just want to collect nicer things that aren't likely to get damaged or misplaced, but that's my preference. You don't have to have the same preferences and that's fine, but with no due respect, fuck off outta ya own thread with this attitude.

There's nothing to be proud of here, you saved (at a very liberal estimate on the higher end of the spectrum) about $13-$15, but at the cost of ending up with loose PS4 discs that will only depreciate in value and will only be harder to sell/way less money back if you do sell."

When I did my own computer, I asked my gf at the time (now fiancée) to help with cable management after I finished putting all the parts in the right places. She made it 100% more stressful when I was already feeling good about my first build, she made me question so much of where things were plugged in even though I was using my mobo's manual and everything. Not worth lol

I also helped 2 friends of mine pick out parts and put the PCs together for them. The first friend and I have a mutual friend who decides he wanted to help out as well because he's put a GPU into his tower recently. I had him seat the RAM and he only got one to sit properly, I had to push the other one in further. We also messed up with putting Win 10 on the wrong hard drive because they both made me second guess the boot order in BIOS. Do not recommend.

The other friend I helped build a PC wasn't bad to work with, the only thing I missed was the CPU bracket for the mobo. We get pretty distracted when we're together, so it was bound to happen. Other than that, it was the smoothest one I've put together other than my own tower."
gamecollecting,feuaqq8,t1_fetmm2h,1579384795.0,"The only exclusive I *highly do not* recommend is Mario Party 10. It's the least fun I've had with a Mario Party game literally ever, and my friends and I even played it quite a bit just to see if it grew on us and it just was mediocre at best. 

Otherwise, the HD remaster of Wind Waker is really nice, can't speak for the Twilight Princess version, there's also Breath of the Wild if you don't have it on Switch. Definitely +1 for Mario 3D world, the Super Mario Bros. U is pretty good too. Smash Bros. with pro controllers is pretty fun as usual, the Batman Armored Core and Zombie U are both worth a play imo, and there's the Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE if you don't want to get the re release on Switch. There's also Mario Kart 8 if you don't have the deluxe version on Switch already, along with Duck Tales Remastered being better on Wii U than PS3, in my opinion. I'm sure there is a bunch I'm missing, I've only just gotten into the Wii U last year. 

Wii U is honestly a decent and affordable console at the moment especially since you can play Wii games on it too. I do have to recommend people also get a pro controller when they get a Wii U as it can be a much better experience in a lot of titles then when you're using the bulky game pad."

gamecollecting,fe0c42q,t3_emxdy8,1578809352.0,"Any type of sleeve you intend to take a disc in and out of will eventually and perpetually scratch the shit out of them. 

So in my honest opinion, what you want to do with your discs here is a terrible idea and you're just going to damage all of your discs every time you take them out and put them back. You're also risking damaging the manuals by putting them in a binder as well since they're not sturdy books by any means. Just flimsy paper held together by staples. The plastic cases can and most likely will get damaged in storage as well, so this entire post is just a terrible idea to me so far.

I keep my disc based games in their respective cases on a book shelf. Yes it takes up a lot of shelf space, but I'm not scratching my discs every time I touch it, and the manuals stay in the same condition I bought them in since they're safely stored in a hard outer shell that was literally manufactured for this purpose. The outer cases cam get micro scratches and scuffs, but I'd much rather that then the disc get scratched and the manual damaged. 

Unless you're entire disc collection is loose, I beg of you to **not** use a binder for discs. It's terrible to store them long term like that.

I guess my tip would be to please not do this.

Edit: **oh God no wtf dude no** what the...? You want to take the art out of the cases and shove em in a binder for this too? I don't understand why you'd go through all that effort *and* risk damaging every physical aspect of a disc based game just so you can can save some shelf space and be able to rifle through a binder.

One other issue I've read people having was dead pixels right out of the box, but they were able to send it in for a new one from Dell.

I did however need to fiddle with the color, contrast, and brightness settings to suit my preferences. When I first took it out and used it the colors were really washed out and I was really disappointed but after changing settings it actually turned out really nice for a TN panel. 

Other than that, it's really good for trying to get a mid/high range PC for a little less money. All other 1440p 144hz with Gsync were all $100+ dollars more expensive than this Dell model when I got this originally.

Totally fuckin worth it even with a ""lower"" card like the 1070 and the ti version. Even though most games I play are running below 144 fps, the gsync helps immensely, it's very obvious when I turn it off compared to it on. I can't go back to 1080p on PC I feel, that 1440p resolution is so worth it even if I'm not able to smash the fps beyond the hz of the monitor.

Most people would go ""must be worth $50"" but I'm here knowing that it would probably sit for a very long time at $50.

You've already told us how you find babysitting beneath you when you said it's not a real job, and then tell us how they know it's not a ""real"" job, but then tell us that it is a real job to them? What the fuck lol make up your mind. 

Either way, your opinion on wether or not someone's work is a real job or not is pretty condescending and rude to those that chose to take on a babysitting *job*. The only way it couldn't be real is if you're not paying them, or they're working illegally. If both of those things are untrue, then they have a goddamn **real** job. 

My unsolicited advice would to not be such a douchebag about someone's choice of work and to stop being a dick to those who are just trying to legally make money.

Maybe you shouldn't be so unkind to someone you rely on to do a *job* for you when you're obviously incapable of doing so. 

Apparently taking care of kids can't be a real job, especially when you get paid for it? The fuck?

Huh wonder why you deleted the -88 karma comment you made telling us all how babysitting isn't a real job, can't possibly be because 80+ people are telling you how wrong you are, is it?"

Having a position in U.S. government that pays your salary is still a real job. Certain people might not be doing their job to your personal standards, but it's still technically a real job. Any job that is legal, pays you, and is taxed is a real fucking job. Doesn't matter what your opinion is, wether or not you feel its beneath you, or really anything else you might try to argue, it's a simple fact that it's a real job. 

Fake jobs are when you don't get paid, taxed, or are otherwise not legally allowed to be employeed.

Just because you don't like someone's performance doesn't change wether or not the job itsself is ""real"" or not."

It's always amusing when someone buys an item from us and just doesn't know how to use it properly, so they end up trying to return it because ""it's broken"". 

I love when I show them that it functions properly ""it wasn't doin' that earlier"".

Or when someone tries to sell and obviously broken item and I show how it isn't functioning right to them. They always seem to double down and say shit like ""it was workin' right before I brought it in"" or ""I tested it earlier it was working just fine"". 

My favorite story example from that last paragraph is when a dude brought in his iMac that had a broken keyboard. He got so mad at us because his keyboard was working just fine at home, so it must have been us in the 10 minutes we were trying to test it that broke it, not when he dropped the keyboard coming in the door, or maybe when he put the keyboard and mouse into the backseat of his car *and then* put the heavy ass Mac computer on top of them (I saw how he took the Mac out of his car lol) but no.

I'm surprised at the amount of people that buy only 3 DVD movies and just say no to the free ones. Like, you could spend the same amount, pick 3 random movies off the shelf, and sell them back to us. Instead of spending $10.69 after tax on 3 movies when you could get 6, why not spend $9.94 on the same movies and only waste about 5 more minutes to do so? No one has been smart enough to even ask if they could do this yet...

Also, the amount of people that think the sale applies to things like blu ray movies, dvd and blu ray box sets, or games is astounding.

ChoosingBeggars,fct3a2j,t3_ehpd5i,1577931756.0,"This reminds me of a time an old man called the cops on the store I was working at because we wouldn't return an iPad he didn't like. 

A few things to unravel first. Our return policy on electronics are 30 days with reciept. If the customer doesn't have the reciept, we can look up the transaction and reprint one for them using things like a serial number in the case of this iPad. 

Old guy doesn't have reciept, of course. So I ask him when he bought it. He said his son bought it like 3 months ago and they went on vacation shortly after. At this point, I know this isn't going to end well already, but I'm required to tell him I won't be able to return it for him if it was bought that long ago.

He complains and bitches about being out of town so how would he know the iPad wouldn't keep a charge and what not. I give in and tell him if I can find the transaction I can give him store credit towards a replacement. Of course he just wants his money back, but I tell him I would be fired for that, and surprisingly he actually accepts that part of it and starts looking at our current iPads while I charge this completely dead one so I can look up the serial number. 

After it finally boots up with him constantly berating me for not helping him return this iPad, I look as far back as our system will let me for this serial number (6 months worth of iPad transactions) and not a single one matches, all have a different serial number and model of iPad. I asked him if he was sure he bought it from us, which just made him yell at me more about how he did (previously his son was the one that bought it, if you haven't been paying attention) and again how it was 3 months ago.

I explain to him how I cannot find this transaction, even looking up to 6 months ago, therefore there is nothing I can do and I won't be able to return it. Since he has no reciept and it's either well out of our return policy and or he didn't get it from here, I can't do a single thing about this iPad, I can't give him cash or store credit, and we obviously won't be able to buy it from him since the battery is defective (it was a very old iPad at the time). 

He gets absolutely irate, demanding a refund on this product. I go into broken record mode and repeat our policy and how I can't do anything for him since he has no reciept and I can't find the transaction in our system. He then starts to threaten calling the police on us because we're stealing from him. I tell him ""you're entitled to do that, but you will be wasting police time and taxpayers money"" which got him flustered, **but then he then has the audacity to ask us to borrow our phone**.

I couldn't contain my laugh when I said no, which made him snatch the iPad out of my hands. I tell him (unprofessionally) that that was very childish for someone his age (no regrets lmao) and he leaves in a huff. Minutes later he comes back in with two police officers. They pull me aside to get my end of the story, then immediately ask him if he can see where I'm coming from. They reason with him that places could probably fix the battery and these poor guys had to explain to a graying old man how store return policies work and how it's not illegal to decline a return when it's outside of the policy. 

I'm still astounded to this day that an elder member of society called the fucking police on a retail store that wouldn't process a return outside of the return policy. He wasted so much of his time, my time, and wasted the time of two policemen who 100% had better things to mediate. The only reason I'm glad he called them was actually for my safety, since he seemed to have some mild violent tendencies and I was worried it would get worse."

gamecollecting,fcspna7,t1_fcs7xg8,1577921933.0,"You seemed to have overlooked the actual main point I tried to make, which is a much bigger deal breaker for me personally using gamevaluenow.com as a collection tracker. Yes their pricing is roughly too low for basically everything, but the lack of imports and varients is much more important to me than manually tracking every price for everything I own. I certainly don't do that either, but if something happens to them, I'd want my insurance company to get me top dollar instead of bottom dollar. If I show my insurance what I had and the value of it using gamevaluenow.com, I would lose anywhere between $2-$10 on every title compared to if I used literally anything else that uses eBay to track average prices. I'd rather get as close to true value from my insurance company than basically lose half of what I put into the collection just because I used a tracker that posts the lowest of lowball amounts on every single title. 

I have some Japanese Gamecube, PS1, and Super Famicom games. That website only has North American releases and not even all the varients that have been released in North America, so if I used that site I would be missing items I have in my collection. From my insurance example above, that means they won't even consider the fact that I had 7 Japanese games, all valued at $10+ each. That means I would have $70+ not even accounted for, and I certainly wouldn't be compensated for those since there's no proof I had them using gamevaluenow.com as a game tracker. 

Yet, it has the games for the RCA Sudio II, Fairchild Channel F, Ti99/4A and other pretty obscure consoles, but it's missing the Target exclusive label for Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour? Some title varients arent worth any different, but what if I wanted every version of a particular game, I would be missing some if I used gamevaluenow.com as a tracker. I use it as reference when needed, but there's definitely better collection tracking websites/apps to use instead, especially if you have things from outside the country or prefer certain versions/varients of a particular game, in my opinion.

I keep a log of what I own so I don't buy doubles, and so if anything were to happen, my insurance could cover (hopefully) most of it, but if I use a website that only shows the cheapest prices possible and doesn't even have everything I own, it's not worth it to me since I'd either end up buying something I already had and or getting shafted by insurance just because am accident occurred. I'd rather use something that has everything I have and doesn't just use the lowest average price all the time when it comes time to selling/replacing items."
gamecollecting,fcs7f7b,t1_fcqw3lf,1577912490.0,"The thing with gamevaluenow.com is a lot of varients of titles are missing, and about 70% of the time the value they state is on the low end for how much the item is commonly sold for within recent dates, it feels like their game prices are stuck from about 5 years ago and even though they're tracking eBay for averages, it seems to always be lower than any other sources I can find, both pricecharting.com, retro game collector app, eBay, and the store I work at (which prices things right in the middle of the low/high usually).

gamevaluenow.com is also missing Japanese and PAL games, which, as someone who has some Japanese imports, that makes it so I can't fully add everything in my collection.

It's a great website for cross referencing prices, but I always use it as the lowest the game should be sold for, not how much it *would* sell for."
