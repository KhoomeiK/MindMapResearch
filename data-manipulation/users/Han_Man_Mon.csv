Before I started working in a hospital I thought that doctors looked at the signs, maybe got some tests done and then mentally looked you up in the Big Book Of Diseases and worked out what you were suffering from. What they actually do is look at you, think, ""It might be this"" and prescribe a course of treatment. If you get better, then the guess becomes truth, which completely ignores the possibility that you might have just got better all by yourself. The admissions documentation acknowledges this, in that it has a section labelled ""differential diagnosis"", which is the bit where the doctor says, ""If my first guess turns out to be wrong, here are my other guesses in arbitrary order"".

I am in no way down on doctors, by the way. I'm a big fan, in fact. Our hospital has some amazing ones, and they know and do things which leave me in awe. But they are also only human and I have had to take them to task often enough that the aura of omniscience has rather worn off.

AskReddit,fc6mzev,t1_fc6e9kw,1577484423.0,"You are so right. I was brought up by non-conformist protestants. My wife's family are Church of England (also protestants). For years I had to attend their church a couple of times a year, and every time I did I felt massively uncomfortable, not because I'm an atheist, but because my religious background made it feel like they were doing things really, really wrong. I'm 100% sure that my grandmother would have refused to set foot in the building and would have told them all that they were going to hell."
CasualUK,fbzjs0q,t1_fbz7ms6,1577249060.0,"I feel your pain. Over the last 10 years I have lost my mother, my father and my brother. I have no close family left. It's our year to have my in-laws over, and my wife decided that, seeing as the children aren't small any more, she might as well invite everybody. I'm a big fan of my wife's family, they are genuinely excellent people, but the fact that our house is going to be full of her relatives just really drives it home to me that mine are all dead. And I can't say anything, because what kind of a monster would you have to be to tell the woman you love that you would really rather that she didn't have her family over at Christmas? I am stuck in some kind of cognitive dissonance hellhole, where I am going to have a house full of people that I like, but who I wish were a million miles away right now. Plus, it's an entirely selfish thing, so I feel like a shit for even thinking it."
