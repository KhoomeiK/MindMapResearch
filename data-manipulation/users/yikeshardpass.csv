Agility,ffflgpo,t1_fffkg73,1579886521.0,"It is absolutely a challenge! And it takes constant maintenance; you’re never “done.” 

If you’re already doing a lot of these things, try expanding the time your pup is willing to wait. Also, playtime. Teaching tug was also a struggle but so worth it in the long run. Our pup is getting a little ball obsessed, so we rotate the toys we play with frequently in an attempt to teach him that the toy is not the exciting part, I am."
Agility,fffd5nf,t3_eszmqi,1579881347.0,"I agree with what everyone above has said, but I wanted to add a couple of things.

When you’re at home, really build that wait skill. As an example, I make my pup wait for everything. He asks to go out the back door, I put him in a sit wait and open the door. He is not allowed to move until I release him, otherwise we start over. When we feed him, put the bowl on the floor and ask him to wait for some time before he can have it. If we play fetch, ask him to wait before I throw it. If we go for a walk, he has to stop and wait before cross the street. Oh and choose a release word that isn’t yes and that you don’t use for anything but releasing your dog. That will help you in the long run. 

Practicing wait in all these different places and situations 1) wears your pup out because they are always thinking 2) increases his attention on you. One day you will wake up and realize that his eyes are glued to you and no amount of distraction will break that focus. It’s amazing to see, but it does take daily practice. 

The goal that I try to keep in mind any time I take my pup anywhere is that I am the single most exciting thing for him wherever we are. That comes in the form of play, of treats, of new places, ect. Why pay attention to you if you’re the most predictable and least interesting thing available?"
astrology,fffaypg,t3_et5897,1579879959.0,Learning my ascendant was a game changer. It’s in Leo and then I have 5 planets in the 5th house (ruled by Leo) in Sagittarius. This better let me accept my creative gifts and embrace the artist I am. Also learning about my nodes helped. My north node is also in Sag in the 5th.

I want someone who will make me THINK. A hot date for me would be one where we go on a random adventure and then ask each other questions. Big questions about life, the universe, our souls. 

Some good adventure ideas include, but are not limited to: go for an exploration drive, hiking, impromptu trips (especially to the beach), glass blowing, a painting class, wine tasting, volunteer at a pet shelter together, trying a new restaurant or unusual foods.

Side note: I also have 5 other placements in Sagittarius, including my sun. This will vary for other Sags"

Agility,ff7b05s,t1_ff6xc9b,1579645094.0,"Our pup was a rescue (we found out a year in that he had been thrown from a moving truck and two years in that he was beaten with a stick), so agility has been a slow process for us. However, we are 6 months in and it has proven to be a godsend. We traveled over the holidays and got a wonderful reminder of all the things he used to be afraid of and how much braver he is now. He trusts me so much more because I chose to take everything slowly.

Basically, keep up what you’re doing. Go slow and give all the loves. If she is getting frustrated, let that thing go and try something else. 101 things to do with a box is a great place to get inspiration."

Agility,ff6by0a,t3_erp6kp,1579623847.0,"My dog was totally terrified of the teeter when we first started. We overcame that by buying a similarly sized board and “playing” with it in the backyard.

At first. I wouldn’t throw the ball unless he has two feet on the board. Then he had to walk the length of the board before I would throw. Eventually, I set the board over a large tree root, enough to give the board a little wobble but not to create a full wobble and we started over with the feet on it, walking down, ect in order to play ball.

When we came back to agility a week later, he didn’t love the teeter, but was no longer afraid of it. A few weeks after that, he has total control of the board. 

Side note, you just started. It’s okay to not be perfect right away. Your dog will learn and in a year, you will have totally forgotten about this. Don’t stress."
energy_work,ff6b1mj,t3_ern23m,1579623270.0,"I had a math teacher explain why time speeds up in a really succinct way when I was in high school. He put it like this:

When you’re 10, a year is 1/10 of your life. When you’re 25, a year is 1/25 of your life. When you’re 90, a year is 1/90 of your life. The year isn’t getting shorter nor is it going faster, but your relationship to the year changes. 

Of course a year feels like it went by faster when it is only 1/30th of your life compared to when a year was only 1/25th of your life."

Agility,felx87u,t1_fel9zr5,1579233222.0,"Part of the reason you want a coach is because you don’t want your dog to get hurt in the process of learning. It’s easy for your dog to get hurt (mine has fallen off the dog walk, jumped off the top of the A-frame, ect) and their experience can help prevent permanent damage to your dog. 

If you’re just looking for something to stimulate your dog’s mind, I would highly recommend looking at 101 things to do with a box."
Agility,fekjm7q,t3_epn89y,1579201416.0,"The first step would be to go through basic obedience training if you have not already. The next step would be to find a trainer in your area. I highly recommend going through an experienced coach because they will teach you all of the nuanced tricks that you may not pick up when just playing in the backyard. 

If you meet with a coach and decide they are not a good fit for you or your dog, find another. The coach is there to teach you, not your dog."

Theatre,fe90qmb,t3_eny6xg,1578932919.0,"I graduated 3 years ago with a Theatre degree. Everyone asks what I’m doing with my life and worry about whether or not I will “make enough money”. Admittedly, I am not paying my bills with theatre at the moment. 

Here’s the thing, my friends who graduated from other programs are having difficulty getting hired in their fields too. What I can say is that I loved every minute of my degree. It taught me so much more about people (including myself) than I would have ever learned in another program. But now that I am in the real world, I am finding that I have skills to do what I would like. Taking what I learned through theatre, I have started my own business. 

If this is the path that you are called to walk, do it. Money is necessary, sure, but it is not the meaning of life. If we are all going to struggle to survive regardless of field of study, then why not at least do what you love?"

Creative gifts are great and they can/should inform you. What I would be mindful of, is to make sure that you are working with this band as a team and that you, as an individual, are not seeking the spotlight for yourself. The south node is where you have been and what you’re comfortable with, it doesn’t mean you have to shun that aspect of yourself. 

For me, this is playing out differently. I love working with a group and as part of an institution. But my life took a turn and now I’m trying to figure out how to be an artist alone. This has been a huge struggle, not because I’m not creative but because losing the collaboration aspect of creativity was hard for me. How can you grow as a collaborator in this band? Do you enjoy being part of a group? How many people are not directly part of the band but that work hard to lift the group up?"

However, there is no chance that I could have done this without my instructor.

EatCheapAndHealthy,fdqsemf,t1_fdqqkbz,1578673871.0,"And to piggyback off u/NorkytheOrky :

 I love using the rotisserie chickens when I’m short on time (or if they are on sale. Sometimes they are cheaper than a whole frozen chicken- always worth checking both prices). But, do not be afraid of roasting a whole chicken! It’s not as hard or daunting as it may seem. 

The pot I use the most in my kitchen is an enamel coated cast iron Dutch oven. If I had to get rid of every pot/pan in my kitchen except one this would be that one. You can make soup, roast a chicken, pan fry, steam in it.

Anyway, take the Dutch oven and put some butter in the bottom, stick some onion slices in the bottom and some whole garlic cloves too. Then stick a whole chicken right on in there. Empty the cavity and then stuff a half a lemon, some onion, some butter, and some garlic cloves in the cavity. Then rub the bird with butter and put some lemon slices on top. Cover with the lid and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Baste with the juices from the bottom of the pot occasionally. Uncover and cook till it’s golden ontop. Then use a knife and cut into the breast and check if it’s pink. If not, it’s done, if it is pink let it cook longer. 

Once I’m done picking all the meat off, I use the carcass and make chicken stock. I use leftover jars (pickles and the like) to ladle the stock into and then freeze them. Sometimes I also freeze the meat I picked off, to stretch it longer."
