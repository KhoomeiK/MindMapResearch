TL;DR at the bottom.  

You need to sit and talk with her using your adult words.   

Communication is essential to a happy, healthy relationship. Both people need to address things they don't like while it's still a small issue instead of letting it build to the point where addressing it will lead to a fight.  

You need to tell her what you feel. If you like watching porn, you like masturbating, and you feel neither of these things equates cheating and neither of them are wrong, you need to tell her.  

Then this is what it comes down to:

1. Porn and masturbation are a normal part of of many people's lives (yours included) and she comes to terms with that, you guys take measures to communicate better, and you have a happier, healthier relationship.  

2. Porn and masturbation are a normal part of of many people's lives (yours included) and she **cannot** come to terms with it. 

2a. You will have to evaluate whether you feel this is something you can get past. If you can abstain from porn and masturbation and not harbor resentment, work on the relationship, work on communication, and continue on.  

2b. If, during your self-evaluation you decide you cannot abstain from porn and masturbation without harboring resentment, it's time to end things; you two are sexually incompatible.  

TL;DR She's a turd for asking you about that in front of people outside the relationship. You're an ass for letting it go so long. The only way forward is to talk through this. Her feelings are probably going to be hurt, but you need to be honest. She shouldn't hold her insecurities against you and you shouldn't allow it."

news,fdqz7im,t1_fdqq49f,1578677216.0,"Summary:  

Tectonic plates moving, allowing a large magma chamber to access the seafloor, causing the formation of a volcano 3km beneath the ocean surface. The magma chamber is rapidly emptying in to the ocean allowing rock to settle. The island nearby has sunk ~7in. The ""humming"" was just long lasting vibrations caused by the various events listed above. These may continue off and on for a while as the chamber empties including further sinking of the island.  

Interesting to geologists because it estimated that the magma chamber is the largest ever recorded and the processes at work seem to be fairly uncommon (my understanding anyway). Beyond the interest to the scientific community, it's unremarkable so far and likely to continue as such.  

Article:  

>(CNN) In 2018, a multitude of seismic signals were detected by earthquake monitoring agencies all over the world in May and June. They created a weird humming sound and some of the signals detected in November of that year had a duration of up to 20 minutes.  
>
>The signals and humming triggered ""the curiosity of the scientific community,"" according to a new study that explains what happened: the formation of a new underwater volcano.  
>
>The unusual amount of earthquakes were traced to the island of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, one of several in the Comoros archipelago found between Africa and Madagascar.  
>
>Scientists detected 7,000 tectonic earthquakes within the scope of the study. These kinds of earthquakes occur when Earth's tectonic plates become stuck as they move alongside one another. The pressure that allows them to move on causes earthquakes.  
>
>The most severe earthquakes reached a magnitude of 5.9 in May 2018.  
>
>They also encountered 407 long-period seismic signals. These Very Long Period signals, called VLPs, are harmonic and low, reminiscent of a double bass or large bell. And their 20- to 30-minute signals could be detected hundreds of miles away.  
>
>The earthquakes and signals were coming from about 22 miles off the eastern coast of the island. Researchers couldn't see any signs of volcanic activity in this area, but they suspected that magmatic processes may be forming one.  
>
>Unfortunately, there was no seismic network on this part of the ocean floor, meaning they were only able to get measurements from the island, Madagascar and Africa.  

>But they noticed a lowering of the island's surface by seven inches, indicating activity linked to the earthquakes.  
>
>New seismological methods developed by the researchers helped them piece together a year-long timeline to reconstruct what happened. Their study published this week in the journal Nature Geoscience.  
>
>The first phase involved magma rapidly rising from a reservoir in the mantle 18 miles below the Earth's surface. This opened a channel in the ocean floor, allowing the magma to flow and begin forming a new underwater volcano.  
>
>An oceanographic campaign in May 2019 showed that a volcano had formed in the same spot.  
>
>During the formation of the underwater volcano, earthquake activity dropped, and the ground of Mayotte lowered. Then, the VLP signals began.  
>
>""We interpret this as a sign of the collapse of the deep magma chamber off the coast of Mayotte,"" said Eleonora Rivalta, study co-author from the German Research Center for Geosciences GFZ. ""It is the deepest and largest magma reservoir in the upper mantle to date, which is beginning to empty abruptly.""  
>
>As dramatic as all of this sounds, it was hardly noticeable on the island itself. Mayotte is one of four volcanic islands in its archipelago and home to about 260,000 people, according to the study. It last erupted about 4,000 years ago.  
>
>""Since the seabed lies 3 kilometres below the water surface, almost nobody noticed the enormous eruption,"" said Torsten Dahm, study co-author and professor of geophysics and seismology at the University of Potsdam in Germany. ""However, there are still possible hazards for the island of Mayotte today, as the Earth's crust above the deep reservoir could continue to collapse, triggering stronger earthquakes."""

The books are great and the shows are one of (if not *the*) the best TV or movie adaptions I've ever seen. They tweak some things, mash some stuff together, but most of the changes were only made to make it more compatible with the episodic TV format and don't change the overall story or characters (there are a few exceptions but I haven't minded them). I can't think of any complaints for how the show changed something from the books.

The visuals are great, the acting is pretty good. Most of the actors do an awesome job at portraying the character in a way that is consistent with the books (I'm especially fond of Wes Chatham's performance of Amos. I'm also really fond the character in general.). The directing, sound and prop design, and music are all pretty excellent. I, personally, am really impressed with the series as a whole.
