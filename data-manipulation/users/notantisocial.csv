sexover30,ff9mbyu,t1_ff9gujb,1579715999.0,It’s just so emotionally charged and I feel like it’s not really a source of bonding for us so maybe that is something to think about taking to a therapist about. Thank you for all your help.

sexover30,ff8uvz0,t1_ff8rifg,1579696903.0,"I have this kind of husband and it’s a bit of a struggle in our marriage to say the least. It’s basically turned me off from having frequent sex because I don’t want to spend two hours laying there having sex, so I dread when he initiates. I rarely rarely initiate. 

I realized after doing a lot of reading here that it should be more fun for both us and me laying there for 45 minutes trying to be patient is not a mutual experience. Anyways our sex life has improved quite a bit, but I still feel that dread sometimes. Do you have any suggestions that would help us? I have asked him to try a sex therapist and he has agreed to go, but I am not sure that is the right solution."
RBNRelationships,ff5vqpe,t3_erreea,1579611891.0,"Well, you definitely don’t want to project to him that you believe you are broken. That you still need to emotionally deal with (I highly recommend EMDR). 

You mention it in pieces: 

“I didn’t have the greatest family life, and we can talk about it (sometime) if you want.”

“Sometimes <thing> is hard for me because of the way I was raised.”


“It is my preference we do <x>.”

“I would rather not (or I won’t) do <y>. I don’t like it/ I have had a bad experience.”


All of these statements open the door to more conversations in little snippets. Then you can talk as much or as little as you want about it. You can gauge his reaction to it. 

It’s my experience that RBNS like to “dump” out the whole story and “explain” everything: why we are the way we are, why they(other person) should listen to you, why everything is so <bad> and / or <scary>. So our job is to get as mentally healthy as possible. 

Any truly *decent* person will respect you and not judge you. They will want to hear your stories."

AbrahamHicks,fdpqq8f,t1_fdpphr6,1578636914.0,"In retrospect it looked like a fairy tale, for sure!!


Moment to moment it was about finding the next feeling good thing and trying to not focus on my current condition (jobless, going into the holiday season not knowing about my next paycheck, having to interview pregnant, trying not to worry about health insurance) and find things to do that put me in a good vibrational place. I slept a fair amount and really focused on meditation (either guided or listening to music) for 15 minutes, honestly just made my best effort. Then I listened to an Abraham segment on YouTube every day. Every day I felt like the Abraham segment gave me something to focus on for that day. 

Sometimes I couldn’t get to it first thing in the morning. So I would drop my daughter off at school, drive to the parking lot next door to my favorite coffee shop. Enjoy my homemade coffee (didn’t want to spend extra $$ if I could help it ) in my car and listen to my Abraham segment on my phone.  So I made sure to find things I still really enjoyed with out focusing on depriving myself etc. I would go for a walk in my favorite park. The gym had a hot tub and massage chairs so I would make that my little luxury after swimming etc etc. 

Also because I knew I would have a job again, I really enjoyed the time and I myself on no one else’s schedule. The time to “stop and smell the roses” so to speak."
AbrahamHicks,fdpk434,t3_emkue7,1578630812.0,"I actually have had that mind set too and recently, I felt I needed less stress so I quit pushing myself to “do” anything and only did things that felt good to me or felt good for me (like I felt were healthy for me) for two weeks after I got unexpectedly fired a week before Thanksgiving. 

A friend contacted me about a job, I interviewed and was hired within a week at a 25% pay increase and the company turned out to be better than I imagined and less than a mile from my house. 

I finally was like,”THIS is what Abraham means by allowing.” In this case I literally did nothing but meditate, listen Abraham once a day and take care of myself. 

Taking care of myself included: spending more time on my physical health, more at home “spa like” treatments (like lotion or if I had been meaning to try a scrub someone gifted me etc), more careful flossing and brushing, more time cooking for myself and cleaning my space. More time lounging and reading.  I ended up getting a trial gym membership thing and went swimming for 20-30 minutes a few times a week at a gym near my house. Enjoyed the company of family and friends and generally refused to worry about things when I caught myself worrying. 

The job thing manifested in like less than 3 weeks. I never went with out a paycheck that entire time. Not to mention I have a 3 year old and I was 5 months pregnant at the time (how do you get hired at 5 months pregnant ?!?  in less than a month)) 😮


I feel like I am starting to understand allowing better."
lawofattraction,fdpjaj4,t1_fdpcdck,1578630150.0,"I would disagree she is “wasting her life” so to speak. You don’t change the conditions of your life to feel better, you feel better then the conditions will change.

lawofattraction,fdpfml4,t3_emkphp,1578627372.0,"Know that no matter who you come into contact with you are attracting. You have quite a few options 

1) Stop viewing your job as stressful:
   a) choose to view it as you are affecting other people in a way that is bringing ease to their life and yours
  b) agree to yourself there is enough time to do what you have to do regardless of external pressures (this manifests often as boundary setting)
  c) understand that other people’s problems and upset and worry have nothing to do with your stability and you don’t have to buy into their emotions 

2) focus on the aspects of your job that are enjoyable / joyful, not the pay specifically because pay is about freedom 

Or generally focus on feeling good  and be as general as you can and be open to other possibilities, do as many things outside of work that bring you joy and makes as much peace with where you are as you can. 

I would definitely stop describing your job as stressful then describing why it’s stressful. You are directly manifesting more stress."

Hello!! 

Always lurked and admired the styles of the people in this sub so I am going to try to be more styles this year. 

I took my clothes my stylish/classic slightly older than me friends and she looked at my wardrobe and said. You have a LOT of black and gray, especially sort of severe shoes because I only wear “nice stuff” to super formal events. I digress.

I have a lot of pieces that can be dressed up or down. She helped me buy like cardigans, and a pair of cream shoes, recommended tights,a few dresses (I am pregnant so pants are hard but I haven’t changed size much because I was sick at the beginning of my pregnancy and lost 40lbs).

1) I need a wide stretchy belt to give sharp to shapeless dresses. Is this the “only” option there? How glitzy? I am thinking simple? Black or brown?

2)  I have a pain now of tan/ cream booties, I need basically low or no heel for work, “business casual.” We looked at some fancy sneakers and some flats. I have a pair of Mary Jane type clogs. I need one more pair of work type shoes. I have hiking boots, but they look really used because I wear them a lot and a pair of those tall warm black sorrel suede boots that are almost knee high. 

I don’t know what color these should be.

My style is classic (because its easy right now), a little bit sporty /preppy (military cut jackets are awesome to me) and western, I live in Colorado.

No bohemian or flowy or flowery or leopard or super vintage. 

If you are still reading this, wow thanks. I would love to see “looks” and product recommendations. I am happy to post some pictures in an album if that would help."

People tend appropriate who they are with their names, people named Dennis are more likely to be dentists and people named George are more likely to be geologists etc 

So I try to choose happy prosperous names like  Vivianne or Joy as well and would probably never name a kid Jude or Judas or Damian (in some accent it sounds like the word demon).

HyperemesisGravidarum,fc79ozx,t3_egg3gk,1577501238.0,"Yes, everyone has given really great advice, especially getting on the right medications. 

Additionally for me, Zoloft helped, it made me feel less miserable. I was prescribed to see a pregnancy/ birth trauma therapist, she looked at everything going on in my life and made that recommendation. It definitely gave me more willingness to cope and try again and again.  It was covered by my insurance ($30 copay). 

Lastly great advice in this thread, I did go to a hydration place and get ivs and vitamins in them. Way cheaper than an ER and you are seen whenever you make an appointment. I monitored my urine, carefully watched my intake. You need to going pee around 3-4x  a day (16-18 hours) and your urine has to be lighter than brown. That’s my criteria on dehydration. I have managed to stay out of the hospital. 

For me,  water with ice and Gatorade could help me start drinking again. Priming my stomach with candy helped me eat. I kept large bags of different types of M and Ms (or gummies) in my bedside table, it would get me started eating something so I could eat something else. Crackers and stuff like that became unappetizing very quickly. I ate a lot of canned soup (I know salty) like one a day because I could drink it even if I couldn’t eat it. A lot of fruit, which was my savior my first pregnancy, did not stay down. So literally like chicken and stars kids serving like the Annie’s organic was awesome I could open a little box, and heat or eat room temp because it was safe. 🤷🏼‍♀️

If you can eat fruit the apple sauce / fruit pouches you get at the grocery or Sams are great some of them have veggies. Lastly once I could eat something I tried to eat those fresh mozzarella balls (they have like a snack size) because they don’t really taste like anything but they have fat and protein to keep you going if you have to do something like drive. This was a eat a few m and me, sit up get mozzarellas, eat those drink water takes medicine. 

Amazon sells vomit bags, called often emesis bags, and I would take them with me and throw up where ever I was. 🤷🏼‍♀️ They have a absorbent pad to help with the smell.

toddlers,fc4ll62,t3_eg08ac,1577420274.0,"What /u/le_bear_ said exactly. Whether you “believe” in spanking or not, the research do not support it at all. 

That said I think having no physical repercussions ever isn’t good for children either. 

A dog will bite if you pull his ear, and I am going to physically stop you from climbing on or hitting me etc. I am going grab and restrain you from hitting other people or running into traffic. 

Basically if you hit your children for disobeying you predispose them to mental illness. Bottom line. 

I think it’s really important for children to understand and respect the natural world (bees will sting, cats may scratch etc). I would never want my child to be bitten by a dog, I do tell her to ask before she pets strange dogs and not to hit or push or grab our dog if she doesn’t want to be bitten. I would never keep a dog I sincerely thought would bite a child, but you cannot always know how a dog will react to a ear wrenched  or a tail stepped on. I tell her that if she hurts the dog (especially on purpose) and the dog bites her that would be her (my child’s) fault, and we would take everyone to the doctor/ vet etc. She usually stops her behavior. So no physical consequence ever to your actions seem s to cause  a lot of problems too. 

Hitting your children on purpose just makes them fear and dislike you. It doesn’t teach them anything."

Lastly they can prescribe specific laxatives for pregnancy, but they don’t want people taking them without some supervision. 

Prunes did help, fiber was marginal for me. It’s not recommended that you do this regularly but in an “emergency” with clean hands you can use a finger to press against the back wall of your vagina. You will be able to feel that shared wall and provide more rigidity. If you do that a lot it’s not great for your muscle and can make it weak, but it’s better than a  hemorrhoid or a trip to the ER."

ABraThatFits,fbzvqus,t3_efb69i,1577264195.0,"My daughter (4) frequently complains that her “boobies” are small. She has not yet really associated “bigger” boobies with being a girl. We mostly talk about penises and vaginas as being the indicator, and I always add “but not always.” She has not caught on yet about the edge cases. 

It’s certainly normal for humans to question people who don’t fit inside the constructs we have created., children have less filters and are more likely to talk about it. 

That would have been a great opportunity for a parent to talk about different body types etc. so hard to catch in the moment, not be embarrassed the person is offended and say the right thing.

I agree ranchers and farmer have a SSS policy: shoot, shovel and shut up. You can go on any farming forum where people are actually discussing ranch issues and see ton for posts about neighbors’ dogs killing chickens, turkey, or geese, harassing calves. There was one where a woman shut herself in the house because she felt seriously threatened by the neighbor’s dog. 

Often your see farmers say, “ I have called animal control twice,” and “that was $500 of laying hens” etc. Some of them don’t own guns and ask about livestock guardian dogs, or think about serious electric fencing or whatever. Most people advise SSS, because it’s hard to solve now that the dogs have killed a few chickens and know where they live, and taking them to small claims court is a lot of work. 

It was nice to let this owner know what happened but you *cannot* lose a wolf hybrid for several days. If you have a wolf hybrid your responsibility to contain and protect your dog has gone way way up. Do you think wolf sanctuaries lose wolves??
