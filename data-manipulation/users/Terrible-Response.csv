csMajors,fcyw5aq,t3_ejljhb,1578088390.0,What a spectacularly bad idea. Be an adult and notify them that you're not interested in interviewing.
college,fcvy11k,t3_ej3dps,1578012688.0,Further proof that higher education is a business that exists to make money. We need a better model. Not sure what that'd look like tbh.
college,fcuy8iv,t1_fcuws75,1577990909.0,"They make those determinations because they can, not because they need to. It's purely a formality along the same line as ""you need to take 5 gen-eds before you graduate"". Trust me, no one needs to know advanced integration techniques to take a DS&A course. You don't need to know how trig substitution works to learn Python or Java. It's a totally different realm of problem solving."
college,fcuxc10,t1_fcuvawy,1577990409.0,"CS majors like to pretend there's a strong math component so they can liken themselves to ""real"" engineers. In reality, software engineering is just a design discipline, but instead of aesthetics we care about other principles. We take the same math classes as the rest of the engineers, but mostly it's just a formality in case we want to go to grad school."
college,fcuwkay,t3_ej0ftq,1577989983.0,"I don't think you'll get kicked out if you're already enrolled. However, you probably won't be eligible for graduation until you fix that calc 2 grade."
college,fcuw9c8,t3_ej1rho,1577989813.0,"I have one, and I don't enjoy using it for taking notes or writing. The budget iPads are too small to take notes on comfortably. Pinch to zoom gets annoying fast. And good luck trying to multitask on such a small display. The bigger iPads don't have this issue, but then you have to deal with the added cost and size of a large ipad pro. They're very expensive. And if you're unorganized with physical papers, you'll be unorganized with digital ones too.  

Tbh, just save your money and buy some high quality physical writing equipment for a fraction of the cost."
csMajors,fcrufzg,t1_fcp6sij,1577906760.0,"Good advice. There are definitely some tricks you can leverage to make yourself more successful. I didn't put them in my post because I didn't want to distract from my main idea: that underclassman ought to just relax and enjoy college. Maybe we can make another post one day outlining the college tricks, strategies, and shortcuts we've learned to save time."
csMajors,fcrm008,t1_fcp8ixq,1577903561.0,">after a certain amount it gets a bit redundant, the difference between  230k and 250k is minimal. The difference for me from 22k to 70k would be  completely life changing.

Exactly...it's not linear lol. And you're *never* going to be making 22k doing any programming or IT job. To make 70k is not going to require you to throw away your college years. I get what you're saying though. Pick your benchmark. 80K? 100K? How much money do you need to be content? Or can we just relax and accept the good living that CS will provide without killing yourself trying to break into the stratosphere of the ""elite"" wage earners.

Edit: the mentality that you need to seriously bust your ass or you're only going to be making 22k salary is exactly the toxic mindset people need to get away from. CS is not easy. But there's a big difference between coasting through college and isolating yourself to focus on arbitrary career advancements."
csMajors,fcoue78,t1_fcoqf5w,1577841823.0,"Well if you're a underclassmen I'd probably just laugh and tell you not to worry about it. But if you're graduating soon, I think my sentiment still stands. Breathe and relax. If we're both miserable, but I have a million dollars, sure, it makes sense that you'd want what I have. Maybe you even think that you're miserable *because* I have what you don't. But that mindset is just never ending. The sooner you get out of it the happier you'll be. My advice to freshmen is simply to maintain their personal life and not let these leetcode-internship-resume games ruin them."
csMajors,fcot5pg,t1_fcopqqa,1577840854.0,"What is success? High gpa? Internships? Graduating? The whole package? That's the trap. The grass is always greener. This sub can make you feel bad for not getting a Big N internship even though that's a totally arbitrary benchmark. Fun fact, you can do *zero* internships and still get a full time offer. I know two CS majors who did this, they're both living large in NYC. One of those guys was totally stressed out his entire final semester, figuring that maybe he was just a loser. He's earning more than most people now.

Look, I get it. If everyone knew you had to do xyz to earn 6 figures, of course we'd all try.  That process is well outlined in this sub, r/cscarrerquestions, and Jumpstart/Team blind. But your quality of life is not linearly relational to your earning potential. More importantly, this community has a bizarre interpretation of success. I should have made a more succinct post. My view is this: you ought to work to live, not live to work."
csMajors,fcoi6jq,t3_ehlswz,1577832820.0,"Reading entry level job requirements is mostly a waste of time, unless you have the luxury of being picky on what you want to work on. Just apply. Read the requirements later if you ever get an interview. Requirements for entry level stuff is mostly a formality."
