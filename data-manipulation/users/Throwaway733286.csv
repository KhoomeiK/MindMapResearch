The way they treat people is a reflection of themselves, and now you know what kind of person he really is. Do you really want to be associated with someone who's immature and emotionally unstable? Who needs to manipulate someone with flowery words they don't really mean just to feel validation and love? It's a shitty move, and it shows they don't have concern or empathy for feelings of others as long as they get what they want. I just feel pity for him now. It's a good thing this happened. You are now free to find happiness and real love for yourself. You may not realise this now, but you will one day. You can do this."

selfimprovement,fe7hczd,t1_fe77vaj,1578914470.0,"Serious vitamin D deficiency mimics symptoms of depression, fatigue, loss of interest and energy, body pain etc, which is what I was dealing with. Supplements + therapy is effective cause now I atleast have energy to do small things outside of work! Glad you're on the same path as me!"
selfimprovement,fe6uzfl,t3_eo05yr,1578905726.0,Get your blood work done. I was in a similar boat until I realised I had vitamin B and D deficiencies along with less iron in my blood. Once I got on supplements I have more energy than I used to
