MuslimMarriage,fecm23x,t3_eofyz1,1578977263.0,"I’m 27 and living with my parents. I personally see nothing wrong with it as I believe it’s all about fate. You keep your heart open to marriage and search but it will not happen until it’s time - whether you be 20 or 32 for example. I’m totally ok with that. I’m focused on my education and leave it to Allah SWT. Also, getting married later is kind of better as it allows you to establish yourself and grow up. Hope this helps!"
