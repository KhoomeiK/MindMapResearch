Watches,fey74m9,t3_eqwa60,1579441623.0,"I spent a long time searching for the right daily driver. I knew I wanted a good and legible navy watch but with my skinny wrists most are too big for me so I was stoked to discover Laco's 36mm selections. This watch is a perfect fit for me and I've really  enjoyed wearing it as a daily for the past few months. The contrast of the black PVD case with the cream white (fully lumed!) dial really does it for me.

One funny coincidence is that this model just so happens to be called the Laco **Monaco**. I've been a bellhop at the Hotel **Monaco** in Pittsburgh for about 3 years now. The job has been a great fit for me and I find it highly amusing that the watch by the same name has been just as great of a fit. Maybe I should visit the actual city state of Monaco someday. It's sure to work out great for me!"

Watchexchange,feoryaq,t3_eq8k3f,1579304620.0,"Up for sale is this lovely Slow AM/PM edition one hand watch. The silver dial variant is no longer available from the manufacturer and the 12hr AM/PM edition of this watch appears to have been discontinued. The watch comes on a solid steel engineer style bracelet with a butterfly clasp and a satin finish fitted for a \~6.25in wrist (extra links for larger wrists are included). The sale also includes the original black leather strap with a cool buckle that matches the geometry of the watch. The battery was last changed in summer of 2019 and should have at least a year of juice left, probably more. Full disclosure: there is some minor chipping of the crystal around 1 o’clock and some hairline scratches near the screws to remove the caseback. Otherwise this watch is in excellent shape.

You also don't know the neighbor I'm talk about. Suffice it to say they're toxic and outwardly hostile  on a loud and unrelenting basis.
