bookscirclejerk,fffn2xq,t1_ffflrix,1579887506.0,The one I remeber the most was about a 7 year old boy being anally raped. I thought I was such a hardcore 14 year old. I was not prepared for that.
bookscirclejerk,fffko62,t3_esl49l,1579886033.0,"I find it do weird that On the Road is in there. When I was at uni it was so beloved. It also has no many themes that teenagers generally liked. Its the stream of conciouness wtiting isnt it? God forbid they have to adapt to something different. Then again when I was in High School I hated of Mice and Men, Grapes of Wrath actually all Steinbek and was meh about Pride and Prejudice but loved the Scarlet Letter, so what do I know?

ETA: I am a dummy and just realised this was from Goodreads, not from polling high school students.  I found that Goodreads ratings are to be taken with a grain of salt since most people are not used to challenging books and those who are don't give  five stars to everything they liked if they didnt love it. Which means that the highest rated books are things like Educated by Tara Westover ( fine but not mind boggling) and other memoirs, or genre staples which fans of the author will give 5 stars to without engaging in critical thinking."
bookscirclejerk,fffjy95,t1_fff7z1p,1579885581.0,"I read one which name I can't remember, when I was a teenager. It was brutal with lots of child rape. Im no prude, but man was a legit deviant."

OldSchoolCool,ffefaui,t1_ffeesnh,1579845822.0,"I think we actually had very similar intentions with our comments. Just to see the different perspectives. And my brother and I were very reserved kids, we just needed a little push and we have both done loads since. But with more conventional parents it may not have worked, and I think I would have be worse off for it. Humans are ever evolving creatures and our interests change and thats part of the beauty of life. Im certainly not clubbing regularly like i used to, and while my parents do loads, it is different from what they used to do when I was younger, or before they had me and they definetly chill on the couch with their dogs as well. I never meant to critisise, just show that there is more than one way to grow up responsibly without being 'the old punk with the entry level job'.
ETA: my brother and I are actually very different from each other, with completely different interest, but with similar outlooks and attitudes to life."
OldSchoolCool,ffe5ozr,t1_ffe1413,1579837376.0,They will have a wonderful time growing up! And they will like their parents even more as they grow up and can share their interests. They will probably still rebel in minor ways when they are a teenager.
OldSchoolCool,ffe59xw,t1_ffe1n3c,1579837059.0,"I never said it couldn't be fulfilling, you do what makes you happy! But like you said everyone is different, and one is not better than the other. And having boring parents would not have been the best for my brother and I. They made us the adventurous, well traveled and well read individuals we are. Also extroversion has nothing  to do with it. There are  introverts who crave new experiences( my mum and my brother) and homebody extroverts. Also you called yourself dull and boring and said it was superior to everything else, just not true. Also thanks for suggesting my parents are frivolous simply for being different from you and your wife. Not everyone wants to become insular just because you are older, and your life doesnt sound any less frivolous than theirs."
OldSchoolCool,ffdve0u,t1_ffdhutx,1579829877.0,"I dunno, there's definetly a middle ground. My parents (very similar to these guys, but a fraction older)are responsible adults with great careers, but they are anything but dull. They travel a lot ( they are in Japan right now), have tons of hobbies, are in great shape, my mum is super stylish ( my dad less so, but not awful), they go to the theatre, ballet, film festivals and still go to gigs. My dad is very outdorsy.They are interesting people who can have amazing conversations. Being dull is not inevitable, and its certainly not a virtue like you claim."

One dude I went to school with kept fixating on different girls in my social group, showing up at their work, following them home from school,insisted on waiting with me when I was waiting for my mum to pick me up, and kept following me to different spots. His profile picture on MySpace was of a girl who worked at a local restaurant, that he didn't actually know. Another dude fixated on me at an English class at Uni, first he sent me anonymous notes on Myspace using different accounts, then did that over the phone then would periodically try to add me on different  social media for literally the next 8 years. I could write a Ulysses sized book with everything I have witnessed or have been told.

I can also understand, to a degree if people just don't think about certain issues. I also think that at least in the developed world there is a minimum standard that people should be held to, and to not be opposed to others having basic human rights is a very low bar to clear. Conservatives vote against the rights of women LGBTQ people and minorities and often lobby for the right to continue to discriminate agaisnt others. Being nice to those who are largely like you does not make you a good person, and its time to stop excusing those who oppress others and never examine their lives.
