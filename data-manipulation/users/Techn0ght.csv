facepalm,feybeov,t1_fexqpcg,1579443236.0,Instead of trying to humiliate him in a small cafe they would have twisted it and tried to humiliate him on social media.

pathofexile,fekexxx,t1_fekcrc3,1579198627.0,Very true.  Some people live to be contrary.
pathofexile,feka6u6,t1_fefwssr,1579195811.0,"With all the design choices in the game, it's clear Chris' game theory is rooted in ""life sucks, only the strongest survive, and that by predating the weak""."
pathofexile,fek9n0j,t1_fedx8cm,1579195486.0,It's also a revenue stream for GGG and the main reason many people paid for premium tabs.  Taking the feature out would require refunds for all purchases in some countries.
pathofexile,fek9ag9,t3_eol8c5,1579195280.0,"I've watched a number of streamers who argue that trading is fine (if you're in HC) and they don't want things to change (because they're in HC).  HC is less than 10% of the playerbase and should not dictate to the whole, so while many mention undue social media balance in determining a democratic approach to things, I hope GGG will not listen more to streamers because of the free advertising they do for the game.  

One of the streamers even jokingly says, ""good bot!"" when dealing with obvious currency bot traders, yet says bots will destroy the market if we put in an auction house where bots can snatch up items immediately and inflate the prices.  Perhaps that's true for uniques, but it would be harder to program automated snatching of rares.  It would also allow us to flood bots with scrap uniques for more than the vendor would pay.  There could be a feature that allowed you to not sell within 5 - 10 minutes allowing a wider audience a chance to see items, with a delivery choice to select which of the bidders can get the item if the auction is for set-price.

There are interesting things that can be done with currency trading.  Special one-time buys like Cadiro, or even GGG setting a price point based upon their intended drop rates modified by intended craft function during league, allowing people to freely see relative currency values."

PathOfExileBuilds,fctbdno,t3_eilu5m,1577938026.0,"The balls from BL go toward nearest target.  With SOS they fire in the nova pattern.  While the balls from each mine can't damage the same target, they aren't going to necessarily be firing at the same target.  I had a 6L SOS drop from metamorph so I tested different skill gems and I gotta say, BL in SOS is fun and works well for clear speed.

funny,fcko6uy,t3_ehmlua,1577729583.0,"Friends as adults, sitting next to each other at work.  Generally this means you're competing for the same pool of money for raises and bonuses at the end of the year.  Better hope that person is actually a friend."

technology,fckmmt8,t1_fck7frk,1577728625.0,"As much as safety is very important in construction, tolerances are built in for that reason.  You don't engineer and build a floor to hold 2 average adults and 2.3 children, you make a floor that will hold as many people as can stand in the space, wearing full backpacks, so that in case there's a flaw in a piece of wood the rest will survive.

In IT, most companies don't build for this level of redundancy yet they expect 100% uptime.  The saying we use is, ""Temporary that works becomes production and you can't touch it"".  We hate band-aid solutions.  They always break on Saturday night."
