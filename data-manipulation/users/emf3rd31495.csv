BreakUps,fe2kflv,t3_enndpf,1578839483.0,"I broke up with my girlfriend almost a year ago now.

There was so many places and things and movies and songs that I did and still associate with her and us. At first it was really hard even thinking of them, but now that it has been some time this has been helping me; just slowly integrate those things back into your life without her. Start slow, like listening to that song once or twice when you're alone. Let yourself cry and then listen to it again. After a few listens you'll have faced that fear and realized that it is just a song that can always have memories associated to it but that doesn't have to define it.

Obviously this will only work for the lesser things quicker, but it's definitely helped me to get over some of those seemingly trivial things. Now I can listen to that song with other people and not want to cry in public. Baby steps man, you got this."

Arrowverse,fd4i5xg,t1_fd4103n,1578167708.0,"To your credit there have been several Batman movies and it can be hard to keep track of which goes where. Hopefully this little rundown will help separate some of the universes for you!

1943 - Batman; a black-and-white 15 chapter theatrical serial from Columbia Pictures starring Lewis Wilson as Batman. As would be the case for a few years, the next film serves as a continuation of this story, however with new actors taking over the roles. That sequel was...

... 1949 - New Adventures of Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder (Also known as Batman and Robin); a second 15 chapter serial by Columbia Pictures, and while it is considered a sequel to the 1943 series it stars Robert Lowery as Batman and is the final chapter of this universe.

1966 - Batman: The Movie; a new continuity altogether, this film is a part of the TV series Batman starring Adam West as Batman. The film was released just after the final episode of the first season of the show. The only film based on the live action TV series.

1989 - Batman; Tim Burton's first Batman film, starring Michael Keaton as Batman, was a huge hit and helped shape super hero films for years. This film is immediately followed up by...

... 1992 - Batman Returns; the sequel to Tim Burton's film, it once again stars Micheal Keaton and serves as a direct continuation of the last film. There was plans to bring all the actors back for a third film, but plans fell apart and instead we got another situation where it is the same continuity going forward, but with different actors playing the part. Which brings us to...

... 1995 - Batman Forever; after Tim Burton and Michael Keaton backed out of any further films, the director credit went to Joel Schumacher, who took the series into a more child friendly depiction. This time starring Val Kilmer as Batman, it was successful enough to warrant one, final film in this quadrilogy...

... 1997 - Batman & Robin; also directed by Joel Schumaker, this one was the final nail in the coffin for the Burton/Shumaker universe. This time starring George Clooney as Batman, it recieved bad reviews and ultimately put any further films starring Batman into hiatus.

2005 - Batman Begins; directed by Christopher Nolan, this is the beginning entry of a brand new, modern trilogy starring Christian Bale as Batman. It recieved very high praise and its success led to the development of a sequel...

... 2008 - The Dark Knight; I won't take much time from here on to go in depth, but this is the acclaimed sequel to Batman Begins still starring Christian Bale as Batman and with Nolan directing. Followed up by the final film in the trology... 

... 2012 - The Dark Knight Rises; concluded the Noalan and Bale trilogy well and cemented them as a benchmark for the genre going forward.

2016 - Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; the first film in the new DC series of films, and the sequel to Man of Steel, this film introduces Ben Affleck as Batman and was met with lukewarm reception. However, he still went on to cameo in Suicide Squad, as well as have a leading role in the Justice Leage film. However, going forward from here it seems DC is opting to retire Affleck's Batman in favor of Robert Patterson, who will reimagine the character in the upcoming film The Batman, which may or may not be a prequel to the Batman we see in BvS, SS, and JL.

Hope that helps clear some stuff up for ya!"

Only to find out... it wasn't fine, and if she had just talked to me then we could have worked together to fix things.

Ultimately, she did not want to put that sort of effort in. I am better off alone than wasting that effort on someone who will literally kick me out of her life without even talking it over. Its fucked but that's life."

It was fucked and its been eight months but I'm still constantly torn by the lackluster closure of it all. Every day I want to reach out, but I know I shouldn't and won't because A) it's what she wanted and I want her to be happy so I will respect that, and B) no one who would ever cause me this amount of pain on purpose is worth keeping around anyway regardless of how much you love and miss them. And it all just sucks because this could have been avoided if she could just communicate with me, but I did all I could do and like you just have to hold strong and move forward.

Other than that, I finally landed my dream job and got a bunch of other important stuff done this year. It just really sucks not having that person to share any of it with. And I know I should be mad and hate her, and in some ways I do. But I really just miss her and hope that she is happy now doing whatever shes doing wherever shes doing it. It's frustrating.

I just don't think they're going to include either the Lego Star Wars Clone Wars video game, or make levels based on ancillary stuff like Rogue One or Solo, though that would be extremely cool.
