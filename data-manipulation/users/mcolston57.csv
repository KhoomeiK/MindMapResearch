What exactly do you picture happening?

There’s this weird thing, you can tell a kid a million times something is bad, but until they actually feel it themselves, a good majority won’t listen to you.  And the ones that do, half will get a fear complex and never fully enjoy life.  I mean yeah, sit them down and warn them, deff. Education is key.

But It’s ok to do drugs.  Most people are addicts.  They just don’t want to talk about it.  Coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, sugar. It’s just for a few weird (racism/profits) reasons, we make some super illegal, but that doesn’t make them harmful (marijuana/mushrooms).

And the ones that do ruin life’s (meth, heroin, pain pills), all you can really do, is be a loving caring parent, who provides a safe and educational environment,and hope that’s enough.

Were you a crazy asshole, were you a super slut, did you cry all night, or were you so passed out drunk you got raped? There’s no way to find out, aside from other people. That’s why you should never reach that level.

Yes normal drunk blurs the lines you normally wouldn’t pass. But here the thing, yes there’s a line.  But on the other side, is just more of what you want, just what you are afraid to act on.  But you know whats over there.  

For some people, it’s a more social and active person. For some people, it gives them bravery, and happiness. Some finally get the chance to kill the fear, stopping them from making the first move. Some embrace their emotions and get sobby.  Others just wanna fuck.

You only cheat when drunk, if you wanted to cheat when sober.

Normal people, in healthy relationships, drink with other people all the time. And manage to not accidentally fuck someone.

It’s never the alcohol, it’s the person."

You shouldn’t be blacking out, but if god forbid you need to drink that much, just stay home.  You’ll save money anyway."
