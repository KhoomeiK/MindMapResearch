52book,ff07k48,t3_eqvoie,1579466044.0,"This week I knocked out 2 more books in the discworld series. My overarching goal of reading 1hr/day currently sits at a 17 day streak with 30 minutes already read today. Though I was busy on New Year’s Day, I’m happy that I’ve been able to find at least an hour a day so far. Here are my entries for the week.

Book 1: The Hogfather

Susan and her grandfather are back again for another adventure in belief. This time the auditors have a dastardly plan to keep humans in line that shake the foundations of the discworld. Assassins, gods, and bidets are on full display as left over belief creates such wonderful creatures as the oh god of hangovers and the eaters of socks and pencils.

We start out with Susan and her monster banishing fire-poker finding out that death has taken over for the hogfather (the parallel to Santa). While she searches for a tooth faerie we get many hilarious scenes of death in full christmas spirit. With his magical sack of presents he spreads belief around to people who have lost it, much to the chagrin to parents and shopkeepers everywhere.

The assassin teatime is plotting to carry out the murder of a god and employs old magic to complete his goal. His adventure takes him to the world of the tooth faeries. We’ve seen death’s land before and this new one is just as entertaining. It is a world created exclusively from the belief of children, including pure blue water and skies with no horizon.

Book 2: Jingo

Vimes and the watch star in a book that tackles the subject of war that is still relevant to today’s society. An sunken island appears from the sea between Ahnk-Morpork and Klatch. This new land creates tension between the two countries that quickly spirals out of control.

Vimes finds himself neck deep in a conspiracy to start a war as Vetinari disappears with Fred and Nobby. Refusing to serve under his his replacement, Vimes starts his own battalion and chases his foreign counterpart across the sea. His stubborn honesty manages to help him in his new surroundings and helps him to relate to people he’s never met before.

At the same time Nobby and Fred get to Klatch on their own journey. Both learn a little more about themselves while disguised as an entertainment troop. They are forced to face their own prejudices when they find themselves looked down on in the same way the look down on others

I’d like to end this small review with a passage that was written in the 90’s, but speaks to today’s world,

“You had to cling to this sort of image, because if you didn’t then you might have to face the fact that bad things happened because ordinary people, the kind who brushed the dog and told their children bedtime stories, were capable of then going out and doing horrible things to other ordinary people. It was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to think that They were Us. If it was Them, then nothing was anyone’s fault. If it was Us, what did that make Me? After all, I’m one of Us. I must be. I’ve certainly never thought of myself as one of Them. No one ever thinks of themselves as one of Them.”

Those were my 2 books from week 3. I hope everyone’s reading journey is going as smooth as mine currently is.

WordVillas,fent8xn,t3_epv254,1579290466.0,"It seems like it is to me for a few reasons.

1. The mass use of default names is pretty common in games and I’d be more suspicious if there weren’t a lot of rachels.

2. The participation curve. Steam achievements have taught me a lot about how few people play through games. Take the super popular game FF7 for an example. 89% of people have completed the win your first battle achievement, which means 11% have the game, but have never played it. Then when you get to the “complete part 1” the  completion rating drops to 19%. That means 80% of players didn’t even make it through a third of the game before quitting. With this in mind the mass of 0-100 scores make a lot more sense with only a few of us actually playing through without dropping the game. Especially with the heavy ads and reused puzzles.

3. First place often stops then starts again based on my playing. The first day they got a good lead than stopped playing. After I caught up and took first, they started watching me more closely and increased their play time to contend with me. Previously they aimed for 600 above 2nd place, but after I caught up to it they started ending their play 1000 above me."

52book,fe6phtb,t3_enn4ig,1578899390.0,"Hi all. I originally joined this sub a couple years ago when I wanted to get back into reading but unfortunately life had other plans. A close family member had a serious bone fracture that prevented them from walking for over a quarter of a year. My priorities shifted with this event and while I read a little here and there, a busy schedule kept me otherwise occupied.

Then the books app on my IPhone updated with a neat “reading goals” feature that has helped me  get in 1hr/day of read time. Being able to see this has been a wonder for time management and I’m approaching a two week streak! I’ve picked up where I left off in the discworld series and enjoying my nightly chuckles. Here’s what I’ve read since the new year.

Book 1: Interesting Times

It’s fitting that interesting is in the title because this book takes a hard look at society and how different people have to fit together. From Cohen and silver horde learning to be less barbarian to docile citizens taking on the mantle of rebels, it explores people from different cultures uniting for a common cause.

The book starts with a focus on Rincewind getting dragged out of the boring life. What surprised me the most is that he soon becomes a secondary character that is there to interpret the will of the people of hunghung. It’s very fitting with the idea that he is a vessel for the will of the lady.

His interactions with two flower’s daughter and the new red army showcases the inherent dangers of rebellion. Some people just want to replace the establishment with themselves, some are trying to help everyone without a clear idea of the how, and some just want to hang posters. 

Cohen and the horde provide some good comedic relief throughout the story. After years of successful barbarian heroing they are confronted with the idea of civilized behavior by Teach. They catch on to somethings very quickly, but are always trying to find their place in the new world.

This book is amazingly relevant to modern day culture. Given that it was released in the mid 90’s that is pretty impressive.

Book 2: Maskerade

A Granny Weatherwax book, which means a good look at her theory of headology. It’s always interesting to see how Pratchett wrote this complex, simple character. I know how it sounds, but I think her being both at the same time is what makes her a fan favorite throughout the series.

The book starts with a post-Magrat coven. Everyone knows that a coven needs three, so something has to happen. Instead of worrying or fretting about this, Granny just goes about her life and gets to the center of things by letting them happen. She goes to the city to collect Nanny’s withheld book money while trusting that the rest will catch up.

When she gets to the city she quickly gets pulled into an opera house murder mystery. Being Granny she simply shows up and everything happens around her while she works everything out. And she even delightfully wins a duel with death on her way there.

If I could summarize this book in a TL:DR it would be this: Aha! Ahahaha!!! Mwahahahahaha!!!!!

Book 3: Feet of clay

Vimes and the watch are back again and bigger than ever! This book explores the classic topic of good intentions gone wrong (or in Carrot’s case: right). Vimes once again takes up the role of the ultimate anti-authority character butting heads with city leaders in the search of truth that nobody really once.

Golems, werewolves, and dwarves are everywhere on full display as he works his way through seemingly unrelated murder’s to get to the cause that binds them together. In typical Vimes fashion he deals out the search for justice to everyone equally, showing the same concern for the patrician and the common service people in his employ. He even ends up giving voice to the voiceless, frustrating the people who think justice is an bought and paid for commodity.

When it’s all said and done he earns his tried and true reward of more responsibility.  While making a show of being dragged into the century of the fruitbat, he enjoys the position that Vetinari has put him in. He is the counter balance to guild leaders and nobles of the city and essential to business of everything running smoothly.

After all what more can we ask for than the sun coming up tomorrow?

I am currently a little more that halfway through the next book. My goal this year is to get as many 1hr/day days as possible, but hopefully that will help me to up my reading in general!

Missing lore: often in fantasy shows the world is much older than where we start and characters know things that the viewer doesn’t.  An 8 hour tv series isn’t going to be able to provide as much context as a book series or even a 20 hour game. I can see how this could cause confusion and lead to the feeling of “slowness” as you might not find out the why for multiple episodes or even seasons.

Geralt- Geralt is definitely the strong but silent type. While I personally enjoy that he considers things and likes to get all the information before talking, this leads to a lot of unimportant “hmmm’s” and “fucks” in the dialogue.

Previous series entries- The show is a take on a previously established IP and will as such get the benfeit’s of that IP’s popularity along with expectations that come from already being popular. While in a perfect world adaptations could go anywhere, that’s only realistically going to happen if it’s a new IP.
