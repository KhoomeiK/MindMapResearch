I wet a fuzzy and rolled it in the powder, let it dry a bit. Deuce is a kinda picky eater. Pinkies offend him, he's way to big to identify them as food, and without hair on it he isn't spurred to eat. But he ate the fuzzy yesterday. I'm hoping because it's so small it will get all the way into his tummy, past whatever constriction caused by the crypto,  and then he won't vomit it up.  It would be within 3 days that a medium large adult would come up half digested, bleah.

I've also got a uv-c light, while Deuce is in his feeding bin I'm running the light inside his enclosure to kill the crypto in it.  I think it did something, when I put him back in he crawled around sniffing and checking out everything.  Hopefully he will at least feel better if not entirely heal, he's such an old dude now."

YouShouldKnow,ffjr6ua,t1_ffjlijs,1580004811.0,"The virus is found in animals, generally dogs get corona virus, although there is a form of the virus that comes from camels. SARS and MERS are 2 types of corona viruses that spread quickly and killed many. This one seems to have started at a market in a Chinese province where wild animals were being sold for food. Snakes, bats and seafood were being sold or were just there.  The virus is zoonotic, which means it can spread from animals to humans.

The virus itself appears to be spread the same way a cold spreads, by people coughing, sneezing, touching things when sick without washing hands.  There are cases of corona virus every year, but not many people get sick. The symptoms are like a common cold to most people, but to very old or young, or people with poor immune systems, it can be deadly. The virus can cause bronchitis or pneumonia. With SARS, the death rate was 10%. With MERS, the Middle East variant carried by camels, the death rate was over 30%.  This one is currently running much higher.  39 people have recovered from it, but 42 have died!  And over 1000 people worldwide have already caught it, most cases being in China. They weren't sure what it was at first, but now that they know it is a communicable illness, they have seriously clamped down on things. People aren't allowed to travel, tours and theme parks like Shanghai Disney have closed entirely. Having just one person there with the illness - or coming down with it where they might think it's just a fever or a bit of a cold - would be a disaster! 

Currently only 5 airports in the US are even letting flights in from China, and they are now examining everyone on the flights to make sure they aren't ill.  Although China may stop flights from leaving soon.  Even foreign diplomats in China are leaving.

There are 2 cases in the US, 1 in Washington, and 1 a student in Texas.

Basically no one is certain about what is happening or what will happen.  With a new variant strain, it could burn out fast, or it could spread. The world is taking a wait and see attitude about this. In a few weeks we'll have a better idea of if we have ""stopped"" it. But it can recur at any time, and there is no cure, you just have to ride it out like a cold."

Got my Kona almost a year ago and love most of it. VERY comfy driver's seat, easy and fun to drive. It's only me and him, so back seat hasn't been an issue. Only issues I have are the back is teeny tiny (well, it IS a ""compact SUV!) and sometimes the front collision warning doesn't work.  Particular to most Hyundais, as his Ioniq doesn't go off every time either.  It only mattered when I was on the freeway and a nutjob jumped in front of my car at night.

I like that the range is great for me, and when I turn on the heater, the ""range remaining"" will change to reflect the extra electrical use.

Better shots, protective instincts, listen to their intuition, whatever.  Those are stats I'd really like to see - do units with women truly have fewer casualties, better kill rates, etc?"
NotHowGirlsWork,ff4tv87,t1_ff4j0fc,1579572326.0,"My unit was over 80% college educated, most had shin splints by the end, some severe enough to be fractures. We had other things on our minds than sex during boot camp.

They begged me to go into a more difficult MOS where I was the only female in the entire Marine Corps in that job at the time."
NotHowGirlsWork,ff4tjib,t1_ff4rb54,1579572096.0,"Right?  My favorite was when I was overseas, the guys would say they were ""separated from their wives"". Yeah, by an ocean. They're still married, but horny and on the pull. Nope.  But a truly single guy?  Sure, as long as they aren't in my chain of command."
NotHowGirlsWork,ff4ta9t,t3_erftpw,1579571920.0,"Sexism in the military towards the women is not due to promiscuity. It is a deeply entrenched rot that can only be changed by women serving.  Ncos learn from their ncos, who learned it from THEIRS, back to WW1.
Anyone can sleep with anyone else, but their are repercussions.

Let me tell you, the one time I REALLY needed a fellow Marine to stand up and help me, it was a guy I had dated. I would have died, but he helped me.

Other Marines, ones I worked with every day, ncos and officers, I never dated or anything.  I was harassed and baited and threatened by them daily, and the senior ncos invited that behavior.  Everyone knew it. It was a conspiracy of silence.

 Boot camp was women only at that time, so there was no sleeping with drill instructors, no way to ""sleep my way to the top"".  The military is supposed to be about honor and service, and this statement proves the poster of that screed has no idea about either."

Pets,ff2v91j,t3_erc4wx,1579525493.0,"4am wake up call is pretty normal.  Perhaps some kibble in her dish when you go to bed, or a timed feeder that opens then to distract her? Even a tablespoon of kibble might help.  Be sure to play with her before bed to wear her out.  Get some fun toys like the round thing with the ball inside, cats really dig that one.  A soft felt ball, or other soft toy. No feathers, bells, or things with tiny parts that she might pull off and try to eat!

If all else fails, leave your door open and see if it helps. She might just ""patrol"" the room and leave, jump up to make sure yoy alive, or even settle down near you for a cozy nap."
