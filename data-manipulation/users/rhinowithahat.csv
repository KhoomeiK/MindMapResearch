I'm in a scarily-similar/weirdly-different situation (me 23, him 30, seeing each other for only \~6 weeks now, but he's already become a weirdly big part of my life). He's <2 years out of a 5 year long relationship, but in the interim he had another 9 month relationship. When I mentioned how it seemed like we were moving pretty fast considering how little time he spent being single, he said something proximal to ""*We're moving fast, but I wanna be honest and say that for one, I want to enjoy whatever happens between us and not move that fast. If it makes sense. I wanna not jump from relationship to relationship like I've done in the past*."" 

He's said he's not seeing anyone else and won't be, but at the same time has told me he wants to ""*enjoy without thinking about the future too much*."" Maybe it's because I'm an overthinker/planner, but I'm pretty sure I'm not misreading this to mean that what he and I are doing is fun, but nothing that's ever going to be serious/a relationship... which is hard because he's the first guy I've *wanted* to be serious with in a long time. At the same time, even though I know it's going to hurt when it ends, I can't bring myself to cut the cord before it gets harder.

He's never asked exclusivity from me, so I've still been talking to guys/going on the odd first date, but at this point it's an apparently futile effort to get less attached to him... because I already like him enough(/apparently have a low enough self-esteem, haha) that I'm pretty much in whatever this is for as long as he lets me.

So anyway, I'm really sorry you're bummin', but you made a hard choice and know your worth as a person and partner. You're going to find someone fantastic, and if you ever want to mutually commiserate about being a 23-year-old female in the dating scene, my inbox is open and fairly unbiased, haha."

Like I'll use the phrase ""weight loss journey,"" but I cringe a little every time I do because while it was a massive challenge/transformation for me, it feels a little self-aggrandizing. I can't imagine how low the bar must be when the ""journey's"" origin and destination are the same damn place."
