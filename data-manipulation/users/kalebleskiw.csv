I’m sure Ricky knows this, but the joke was too good for him to pass up."

[English is No Longer the Language of the Web](https://qz.com/96054/english-is-no-longer-the-language-of-the-web/) 

Here is an excerpt:

““What percent of the Internet’s content is written in English?”

Look online for an answer to that query—posed in English—and you’re likely to encounter a website last updated in 2003, EnglishEnglish.com. The site’s “English Facts and Figures” page asserts that “80% of home pages on the Web are in English, while the next greatest, German, has only 4.5% and Japanese 3.1%.” The sources behind this assertion are unclear, but it’s consistent with early research on linguistic diversity online. In 1997, Geoffrey Nunberg and Hinrich Schütze released a study estimating that 80 percent of the World Wide Web’s content was in English. The Online Computer Library Center followed in 2003 with a study estimating that 72 percent of online content was in English.

These early studies led researchers to suggest that English had a “head start” that other languages would find difficult to overcome. With such a large user base of English speakers online, many websites would publish content only in English, and web users would adapt to monolingualism by improving their language skills, which in turn would increase the incentive to publish in English. Neil Gandal of Tel Aviv University analyzed web use in Quebec, Canada, in 2001 and observed that native French speakers spent 66 percent of their online time on English-language websites. Furthermore, young Quebecois looked at more English content than their elders, suggesting that language barriers would be even less relevant for a future generation of web users. Given that Francophone Quebecois were willing to read English content online, Gandal argued, website developers wouldn’t bother to localize their content, leading to a future with more sites entirely in English.”"

todayilearned,fdq01vm,t1_fdpxkiq,1578648159.0,"55% of the internet is in English. Which may sound significant but not overwhelming, however, when you consider that the other 45% of the content is SHARED by mandarin, German, French, Spanish, Russian, etc...

EDIT: Changed to 55% from 80%."
