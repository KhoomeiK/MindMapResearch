sadcringe,fdnkb05,t3_em5aca,1578587588.0,"My wife is a nurse and one day her car wouldn't start after work. She called the breakdown service and they sent a guy over. The breakdown company subcontracts out so the guy didnt work for them as an employee. The guy turns up, realises he can't fix her car there and then so puts the car on the back of the lowloader and brings the car to the dealer and was about to bring her home but I worked about 2 mins friom the garage so she said she;d wait at the garage for me to pick her up. Apparently he was insistant that he take her home but she said there was no need and I got there 2 minutres later. We had a brief chat and I thanked him for his help, but he seemed a bit *odd* to me. Almost like he was annoyed that I had turned up and I had curtailed his time with my wife. 

My wife said what a nice bloke he was and how helpful he was and I joked that I thought he was a bit creepy and fancied her. She laughed it off and we thought no more about it. Until a week or so later when the car had been repaired and she came out of work and found a note on her windscreen saying that he'd recognised her car and left his phone number and said that if she ever broke down again to ring him directly, not the breakdown company - which I thought was a bit weird. She did say that he had told her that he often parked in the hospital car park while waiting for calls - the car park is huge and is rare in that it has some areas that doesn't charge for parking - so, he did have a reason to be there, but still a bit odd. A few days later she found another note but this time instead of just 'hi' it said 'hi sexy' and said that he would love to meet up. I rang his number but he didn't answer so I rang the breakdpwn service, told them the story. They were shocked and said they would get on to it immediately. 

The next day she came out of work again - having parked her car on the opposite side of the car park, right by the security hut as she was a bit creeped out - switched on her phone and found several missed calls and a text saying he was was in the car park and did she want to meet for a coffee or lunch 'or something'. When she got home I rang him using her phone and he answered with a breezy 'hey sexy!' and I went fucking mental at him and told him that I'd reported it to the police and had reported him to his employers and he hung up. I blocked his number on her phone.

The breakdown company rang me back the same day and I told them what had happened that day, and they said that they had terminated their contract with him. I got the impression that this wasn't the first complaint they'd had. Luckily because I'd picked her up from the garage he didn't know our address (also we are ex-directory and the breakdown company said that he did not have access to any personal details) My wife was spooked enough to ask a security guard or colleague to walk her to her car for a few weeks just in case and she got a new car a few months later and left that job a few months after that.
