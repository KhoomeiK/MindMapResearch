In return she eats the food I provide her, screams when she's in her feelings (which is always) and gets to be let in or out on demand no matter the convenience. Basically I get a mouthy, bossy, needy, untouchable cat and she gets a free ride."

AmItheAsshole,fdv37cc,t3_en0zfr,1578742688.0,"NTA. My nephew moved in with me after leaving the navy. He was run off the road buy a texting nitwit. He totaled his car. It was veterans day. They did not stop.

He has a bit if PTSD whenever a car is driving towards us on a more narrow road. If it was not for the giant boulder he hit then he'd have gone off a ravine. 

Our actions have consequences and until your daughter and wife can realize that then your daughter certainly doesn't deserve that license.

She made a choice and is pretending there are no consequences while you are sacrificing your time and childhood to cover for her. Shame on your parents for allowing this.

They were sitting in seats they did not pay for. They trashed them. No matter what they trashed them with it was still shitty.

Also, until you have an allergy and go through whatever horrors it causes you get no say in how severe it is 'in your opinion'."

Then maybe one storm every week or so to keep the snow fresh. Like others have said we rely heavily on snow. Luckily most slopes make their own but it is costly compared to nature providing it. 


 It's been very warm and when it isn't warm it is windy which dries the snow up."

pettyrevenge,fci6tdh,t3_ehbfbh,1577658421.0,50cents is a ridiculous amount of money to send someone away to fetch. Considering the menu pricing backed you up I'm not sure why he was being a dink.
