nutrition,ffs4eec,t1_ffrezpj,1580172854.0,You’re right. I’m just in the habit of counting it at 10 for ease of adding it all in my head. Sorry.
PeanutButter,ffpodgq,t3_elmwjn,1580100264.0,"1. Go to Walmart 
2. Find PB aisle 
3. Locate Crazy Richards 100% peanuts PB
4. Buy 10!!

Theres not even any salt in it. It is just peanuts with a smooth texture. It costs less than 3 dollars. Can’t beat it."
nutrition,ffpo1iw,t3_euil6e,1580099988.0,"The less salt has nothing to do with it. And sugar is a carb. The extra gram of sugar is already accounted for in the total carb gram count. The only difference is that it has one more gram of fat which is 10 cals. If you calculate all the calories by how many grams of each macronutrient there are, you get 196 cals per serving of reg PB and 206 cals per serving of the less salt PB."
progresspics,ffj95g9,t3_ettocj,1579993377.0,150?! You look 110! Must be that muscle!
irishsetter,ffj8zz0,t3_etwfkx,1579993283.0,"Earlier last year I lost my 10 year old, Teddy. It still feels like yesterday and I don’t think I’ll ever be the same. I am not one of those people that has a farmer’s mentality when it comes to losing pets. The way he went was painful and slow with his last night on this earth being in a vets office with the euthanasia process going wrong and an undiagnosed problem. It nearly wrecked me. Well I hope rem went peacefully and painlessly. I feel your loss."
