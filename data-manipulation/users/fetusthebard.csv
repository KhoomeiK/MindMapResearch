Yet again assuming false shit because you have no grasp on how life works. Those people = entitled shits that don’t have real problems. But you obviously know the truth! Despite living most likely how you’re projecting that everyone else in modern society does. 

So here’s how life actually works you fucking asshole. When my house was broken into and robbed for the first time, we called the cops and barricaded ourselves in the bathroom. It was the only other single room in the house, and had nothing of value in it. After finding nothing of any especial value, the robber stole a couple twenty-dollar or less items and jet. 

We call the police. They come, take our statements. They ensure us we aren’t in any danger, suggest a security system, and get ready to leave. We ask them what they are going to do about the stolen items and the guy that robbed us. 

“Oh, that guy, yeah we know the guy. It’s okay, the thievery is petty, we’re trying to catch the drug traffickers he’s working with. I wouldn’t expect anything about your stolen goods.”

And they left. 

That’s what police do if you’re poor btw. They don’t protect anything.

Futurology,ff7l0lf,t1_ff7erx5,1579652061.0,"> It's not true. 

You're completely correct, that's simply bad phrasing. A more accurate way to get that point across is that Thorium reactors have *no reason* to be used for plutonium synthesis. Solely uranium reactors are much better for such plutonium production. It would be both economically, and technologically more difficult to do so with Thorium. 

> It's not just about what is technically possible, it's also about regulations and public interest. 

Wow, it's like you took my entire point and condensed it to a single sentence. It's perfectly practical today, the holdups are societal. 

> Except it is. We currently have the technology to run a full fusion economy 

That's a full lie. We would need energy going in, we cannot run a society solely on fusion. That's why we are trying to attain cold fusion. 

>  We have had a practical design for a fusion plant since the mid 1970s. 

Which required heavy energy input for low output. It is extremely inefficient, and while that's come down since '76, it's still not as attractive as thorium efficiency levels. It also uses Uranium, which as already discussed, is way harder to extract. 

> Thorium reactors are possible with the technology of today, but they would need an entire industry around them to make them practical. 

We already have them, our current nuclear programs didn't come from nowhere, you know that right? There was also a PA thorium reactor that ran for a period of 5 years. 

> You would likely sell power at a loss for the first few decades 

That's very unlikely. As already mentioned, thorium is cheaper to extract, there's more of it, and it's rarely mined otherwise. The reactor is so much more efficient. And not, ""oh good, a 3% increase"", thorium is 200 times more efficient. As far as the logistics of opening new reactors, the same must be done with wind and water tech. We're currently undertaking those ventures. 

> I'm not dunking on Thorium by the way. 

I know that. I don't think anyone here is. I think people are just acting defeatist, when all that is necessary is overcoming public disdain for nuclear energy. And Thorium is a good way to do that generally. It assuages most of the public fears about nuclear power."

So hereâ€™s how life actually works you fucking asshole. When my house was broken into and robbed for the first time, we called the cops and barricaded ourselves in the bathroom. It was the only other single room in the house, and had nothing of value in it. After finding nothing of any especial value, the robber stole a couple twenty-dollar or less items and jet. 

We call the police. They come, take our statements. They ensure us we arenâ€™t in any danger, suggest a security system, and get ready to leave. We ask them what they are going to do about the stolen items and the guy that robbed us. 

â€œOh, that guy, yeah we know the guy. Itâ€™s okay, the thievery is petty, weâ€™re trying to catch the drug traffickers heâ€™s working with. I wouldnâ€™t expect anything about your stolen goods.â€

And they left. 

Thatâ€™s what police do if youâ€™re poor btw. They donâ€™t protect anything.

You're completely correct, that's simply bad phrasing. A more accurate way to get that point across is that Thorium reactors have *no reason* to be used for plutonium synthesis. Solely uranium reactors are much better for such plutonium production. It would be both economically, and technologically more difficult to do so with Thorium. 

> It's not just about what is technically possible, it's also about regulations and public interest. 

Wow, it's like you took my entire point and condensed it to a single sentence. It's perfectly practical today, the holdups are societal. 

> Except it is. We currently have the technology to run a full fusion economy 

That's a full lie. We would need energy going in, we cannot run a society solely on fusion. That's why we are trying to attain cold fusion. 

>  We have had a practical design for a fusion plant since the mid 1970s. 

Which required heavy energy input for low output. It is extremely inefficient, and while that's come down since '76, it's still not as attractive as thorium efficiency levels. It also uses Uranium, which as already discussed, is way harder to extract. 

> Thorium reactors are possible with the technology of today, but they would need an entire industry around them to make them practical. 

We already have them, our current nuclear programs didn't come from nowhere, you know that right? There was also a PA thorium reactor that ran for a period of 5 years. 

> You would likely sell power at a loss for the first few decades 

That's very unlikely. As already mentioned, thorium is cheaper to extract, there's more of it, and it's rarely mined otherwise. The reactor is so much more efficient. And not, ""oh good, a 3% increase"", thorium is 200 times more efficient. As far as the logistics of opening new reactors, the same must be done with wind and water tech. We're currently undertaking those ventures. 

> I'm not dunking on Thorium by the way. 

I know that. I don't think anyone here is. I think people are just acting defeatist, when all that is necessary is overcoming public disdain for nuclear energy. And Thorium is a good way to do that generally. It assuages most of the public fears about nuclear power."

Music,ff40a5m,t3_erdjxq,1579552737.0,"Fun fact: Claudio hates that this song is the one that was chosen for single status by the record company that signed them. He wanted Welcome Home to be the single that defined Good Apollo, Iâ€™m Burning Star IV, Volume 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness (and obviously the fans agreed, as it is now the most well known Coheed song). 

I personally prefer the Willing Well songs to this track and Welcome Home though. Thereâ€™s a lot of good sound in those four. Itâ€™s also 28 minutes of the album, so thereâ€™s a lot to digest in there I guess though."

So if you werenâ€™t born in the 90â€™s, and your family *didnâ€™t* work for NASA or something, and you knew how to use a camera, you probably taught someone. Both sets of my Grandparents remembered a time where you had to go and get your picture taken, with those plated systems."
