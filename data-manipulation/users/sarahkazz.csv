I've had a hard time staying under 1900. I'm speaking to a registered dietician about it soon and I'm getting a physical this weekend. I hope it's nothing super serious.

Most epilepsy specialists don’t use it if it’s avoidable because of the side effects. But that’s why you should ask and have a frank/honest conversation with your doctor about your medical history and other medicines/supplements you’re on."
CPTSD,ff41ckv,t1_ff3uu5o,1579553404.0,"I’d ask about Wellbutrin (bupropion) before asking about Topamax. Wellbutrin is an atypical antidepressant that has a lot of those same effects (so much so that it’s often used to help people stop smoking) but it doesn’t cause a cognitive function to slow or hair loss. I’m taking it with Buspar, so I hardly ever experience anxiety from it. 

A lot of that comes down to factors that are personal, though. OP, if you don’t have a psychiatrist, I HIGHLY recommend finding one."

I was the victim of someone attempting to solicit me for CP. Nothing ever ended up on tape, thankfully, bc I was old enough to fight it and get help, but the scars from the sexual abuse that lead up to that are there.

Doing it this way also takes advantage of the fact that people tend to be more disciplined toward the beginning of the year in general, and makes it easy to fight burnout later on.

Also, instead of putting them into a normal savings account, I’m going to invest it into [Acorns](https://acorns.com/invite/YS87MG) on top of my roundups, so I’ll have the benefit of compound interest.

You are allowed to be upset about this. You did not choose to bring your siblings into the world, and you should not be held responsible for their care. You are still growing up and an important part of that is developing social skills. You’ve been deprived of that time.

And honestly, I think you should start getting paid again. You’re forgoing a huge part of your life to take care of choices you did not make. Stash that money into a savings account your parents don’t have access to if you can (or a tube sock you can hide easily if not, it’s not uncommon for financially unstable, abusive parents to steal money from their kids) and save up so you can A. afford to move out once you’re old enough and B. to find a good therapist when you do move out.

You are 100% right. Your recovery matters. And your sibling is displaying some classic signs of a kid with a bad home life.
