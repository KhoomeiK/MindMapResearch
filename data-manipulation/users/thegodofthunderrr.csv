trashy,ffrkv9r,t1_ffrij3h,1580160115.0,"Yeah. The best way to get good at CrossFit is to not do CrossFit. I honestly find the sport and competition fascinating but moronic as a general fitness regimen. If you look at the top competitors two trends pop out: they were previously competitive in something else (weightlifting, gymnastics, running) and they don’t do “CrossFit” for their training. They do incorporate HIIT but the work is more focused with sections on strength training, technical training, cardio, etc. They rarely go into the gym and spaz out with one of the workouts you’d see in the competitions."

rareinsults,fdw9sdx,t1_fdw7bat,1578756536.0,"Of course it’s not the only option, but my point is it’s the optimal option. Without knowing your future, you’re going to be more likely to make more money with a bachelors degree than without. This is like saying there are two toothpaste available to use. With one of them you’ve got a 10% chance of getting cavities and the other you’ve got a 30% chance of getting cavities. Both of them are an option, I just want you to know that the 30% one exists even though you can use the 10% one.

If he’s was positing it as alternative for folks who can’t go to college, that’d be one thing. But he’s presenting it as an option for someone to choose over college.

Yes, the world is getting over saturated with degree holders. That’s a good thing. 50 years ago the world was getting over saturated with high school graduates. If we were in that era this line of thinking would have been, “who needs to graduate high school? Plenty of people are looking for laborers, so why wait to make money?”

Of course a college degree becomes less valuable as more people get one. That’s called progress as society raises its baseline. The solution isn’t to advocate for less education."
rareinsults,fdw68jq,t1_fdw315y,1578755453.0,"Anecdotes from people on reddit talking about not needing a bachelors degree to make more than people with a degree are as sure as death and taxes, but I never understand the point of them.

This is great for you. Truly, I’m not taking that away. But it’s also not the norm and if someone is starting their life out, it’s a better bet to get a bachelors than to not. With that in mind, in the midst of a discussion about flattening wages, what’s the point of this comment? Are you just looking for kudos or are you trying to make an argument that young people should ignore the data and not go to college? I’m not sure that’s helpful advice and I’m wary of any advice that leaves us with a less educated population."
