nba,ffurl16,t3_evc5iw,1580248008.0,This idea is really silly for a lot of reasons. It’s just a bad idea in general. Think about this: Kobe loved the game. He loved the people who played the game. He would probably want the BEST player to win that award. Giving it to him after his passing would most likely go against his wishes anyway.

Have a wonderful new year and I hope you get laid a lot because I can tell you’re just the best at parties. And quoting an article isn’t deep knowledge. It doesn’t show that you have an understanding of what you’re talking about. It means you can copy and paste. In other words. You’re a poser. A Romanian poser. Don’t talk shit about America again.

You’re a poser dude. You’re someone who’s not a scientist trying to argue with people who are. You hear me? A POSER. You stick with your argument and that’s fine with everyone but what’s not fine is going around calling people flat-earthers and shit when really YOU are the one acting like a flatearther. I’m out.

memes,fcnztpi,t1_fcnverq,1577821540.0,Dude. Let me put it to you this way. Who decided when year 1 would be? Who decided if there was gonna be a year 0? HUMANS. So HUMANS can decide when the start or end of the decade is. I’m not saying you’re wrong because you’re HUMAN and can CHOOSE when your decade starts but you have to understand that other humans can decide when their decade starts for themselves because at the end of the day it was us who decided how to number the years. If you want to argue with me and say it’s against math... well... 2 + 2 = 4. That’s math. That is unchanging and that will be here regardless of whether humans exist or not. The term Year 1 ONLY exists because humans exist. After that it’s entirely up to us whether or not we follow it a certain way. You’re not wrong. But the people who think otherwise aren’t wrong either. There is no set “right” way to look at it. I’m so sick of seeing this argument on the internet. If you feel so strongly about it then just ignore everyone and celebrate your new decade next year. Simple as that.
AskReddit,fcnkt96,t1_fcmh4it,1577813472.0,I see your point. But I’m going to rebuttal with a point of my own: *stolen art collection*.
