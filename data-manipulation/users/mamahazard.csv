changemyview,ffu0y4f,t3_ev7frp,1580232123.0,"On the other hand, Walmart pulled a nasty trick to skew the statistics on this issue. They often pay *just* enough to get their workers off government assistance, but not enough to get by.

Say, a family gets $300/mo in food stamps/EBT. the head of household gets a $300/yr raise, which puts them *just* above the cutoff for government assistance. 

That's a pretty nasty trick and really, it helped nobody. It did more harm than good to those families. 

Other than that, I fully agree. If a company makes W/yr, they should pay X salary, going up as the corporate ladder payoff increases. There is no way a multi billion dollar company should have their employees barely scraping by. That's messed up as can be."

The guy I'm with now is a few years older, military background, raised very differently than me, opposing political views, etc. He's obviously easier on me than I'm sure he is/was on himself; and he expects very different things from me as a person than he does from himself as a person. 

I can see how these things all relate to each other. Everybody has their different wants and needs from both themselves and each other. It's important to understand and respect that in any level of any kind of relationship, and it's easy to overlook that as well.
