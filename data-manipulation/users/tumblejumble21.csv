SuicideWatch,ff50dii,t3_erhro1,1579576858.0,"It gets better is a lie. It could get better isn't. People that get over depression often feel living through hard times were worth it. They may even start to see bad things as good. I had a blood clot in my leg (DVT) when I was 20. I had big mental health problems and then all sudden, there goes my health. That resulted in a psych hospitalization I was so broken after my two week hospital nightmare I never thought I'd get over the trauma. But crazy as it sounds I look back and I'm just so glad I found out about the problem before I got pregnant, which greatly heightens the chance of blood clot for people who have what I have. Depression is chemical but there is an aspect of changing your frame of mind  or reframing. It takes A LOT of practice but you may be able to convince yourself some parts of your life, who and how you are aren't bad. But yeah of course, it may get worse nobody knows."

SuicideWatch,fdpashp,t3_emjsqj,1578624005.0,"A lot of people will not agree with me, but I'm going to say what I really think. I'm a little scared of the reaction from Reddit but I have to say this and I don't feel like creating a throwaway. I consider a pedophile who resists the urge to harm a child day after day week after week a fucking hero. Why? Because sexual urges are so deeply instinctual Id brain territory I can't imagine what it would feel like for you to be in constant battle with yourself and win. Dark net is a bad place for sure but masturbating by yourself likely made no real difference in the life of the abused child. No one would want some one to masturbate to a video of them being sexually abused as a child but if the video stopped you from hurting another child I'm glad something did. Shame is not worth your time. Be proud that you have controlled the demon all this time and if you die so as not to ruin others lives you've won but if you can live and not harm any one you've won even more because there are others like you who need programs for helping them live a prosocial life and you have a unique experience that could help lead to programs that work. Continue seeking help where it exists. Love yourself for having urges and fighting them. It's like fighting a cancer. Forget dark net and leave it in the past. You are still human and you still can offer this world many good things."

SuicideWatch,fcwhks7,t3_ej4wzo,1578025813.0,BPD and shitty family life tend to go together and you'd be surprised how common it is. Commonly DBT is used to treat Borderline and it can create changes in your brain so that you don't feel so scared all the time (your brain may be misinterpreting signals as threats that aren't threats and that is a really hard thing to have to live with). I have a little bit different psych problem that has caused me great anxiety and I know how terrible you must feel.

SuicideWatch,fcmdxoy,t3_ehxkya,1577771794.0,"Hi, I'm Melissa. Not sure why but I feel the need to post my life story read if you want or don't. My fav food when I'm sad? Anything with sugar. If I don't qualify for diabetes yet I soon will. My fav song? I like Damaged by Plumb. I am not sexually abused but still relate to the words and having some one that hurt you in your head forever......................I have Bipolar2 and Asperger's or Autism Spectrum Disorder as  they call it today. I've always been shy and interverted. I have always been awkward and I always knew i sucked at making friends. ........................In middle school I stopped trying to have friends. Instead I got depressed and the only thing that made me happy was some crush on a boy that was the only kid ever to talk to me. I rarely spoke but he found a way to talk at me that I liked. At the end of 6th grade I went on Prozac. It made me feel better but also rage so by 7th grade I was off it. Halfway through 7th grade I found I was really horny and needed to be noticed so I doing anything I could for attention. It was the only time I felt happy in middle or high school. I liked getting in trouble for my stupid childish antics like chasing boys down the hall or reading made up love poems to a particular boy I wanted to annoy, or stealing this kid's hat. I maybe had a crush on everyone with balls but I had a few favorites. Anyway I thought I solved depression but it only resulted in me being put on strong meds and placed in a speacail ed classroom pretty much all day the next year. That's when I got diagnosed with Asperger's. Some suspicion for Bipolar but the experts decided I didn't fit criteria at that time so they explained to me that my high level of anxiety and the AS made me act ""agitated' which accounted for behavior. After that life was really shit. I became suicidal and also pyschotic. Just delusions not hallucinations but i thought i was communicating with people and creatures that don't exist and people that did but I was def not talking to. Three years go by with my delusions ranging from wonderful to terrafying. You don't know how many nights I almost pissed the bed. I was treated as if I was retarded because after psychosis there was no trace of intelligence and i was academically terrible. I used to be a pretty good student but everything went out of focus. I was a shell of a person. ..........................................at 17 i tried to die but failed. i took seroquel, my fav pill. Thought I'd drift to sleep. Nope. Hurt like hell! I was such a fucking baby about pain I screamed and cried on my cat. 3 days of hospital later I went home. I/the psychiatrist decided more seroquel was the answer to my problems. i thought if i couldn't die I'd need to blot out the noise of my brain. It worked on Thanksgiving my Junior year. I was eating turkey and this thought just took hold that nothing I had believed could possibly be real. I spent 3 years of my life writting a bunch of non sence and communicating with nobody real. That was one fuck of a punch in the gut. Plus, every one treated me like I was dumb as a snail and given my behavior I guess nothing but stupidity was on display. .....................Its hard to talk about the most painful stuff this is the short version. Eventually I did some things normal people do but depression anxiety and hurt followed me everywhere. I knew I had Bipolar2 by 19. I understood now why my life had parts that had seemed fun (though few). It was all a lie. Suicidality followed me too. At 19 I had a bloodclot in my leg that spread to my lungs and a little in the other leg. I had 3 surgeries implanting a filter, taking it out, putting it in. I walk fine but that tipped me into psych unit visit one and two. The psych unit stays helped a little. Being around other people was better than alone. At 22 I met P my now husband. You'd think if anything could end my depression...but no. I was still tormented with anger, anxiety and hopelessness. I never could get a job and my independence skills...lets just say it never happened I just went from depending on parents to depending on P. I hated myself. I never got over the way I was treated like I was retarded. It wrecked me. I did the whole therapy thing on and off my whole life since age 13 really. Day hospital, depression groups, Aspergers shit, I tried everything to be happy. In June I was 26 and was passive agrresively suicidal. Started downing my pills every two hours: a certain amount of Ativan until I either died or went to sleep. P called 911. Psych unit3. ............When I was 27 my family found out my older brother was a drug addict. He was the one they treated normal as a teenager. He got to go on classtrips while I had babysitters force me to leave the house and go to the mall. You see why I'm so fucked up now, I was too psychotic to know how to defend myself so I just went along with all the stupid shit my parents did. A few months after my brother detoxed he relapsed and ODed on a trip to see my grandpa in CA who was dying. He took his morphine. I found out through a phone call at my psychiatrist. This in a way was the turning point because now I was just fed up with my lot of shit in life. I felt that even my own brother checked out on me. I had to either kill myself or change everything about my life. In my 20s I had a few friends but I could never depend much on them. I needed more family people stuck with me that couldn't escape. So I decided about a month after my brother died to start trying for kids (life long goal). We started. It was work. It wasn't fun or casual. I noticed my periods were not 28 days apart so I told my OBGYN and she gave me a pamphlet on PCOS. Now I understood why I had to shave my face like a man and that having kids was going to be hard. Well, just like evereything else is I guess............................I was thinking about trying to implant a fetus but I was too fat (did I mention I'm really fat?) so I tried Clomid in November and nothing. On New Year's Eve P's brother called to say they were pregnant and I flipped my shit and took 15 Ativan and slept a lot. I woke up late Jan. 1 of 2015 and decided fuck this I have to loose weight it's my only chance at a family and a life worth anything. We tried again in January  and I guess it worked about 9 days later cause in Febuary I found out I was pregnant. ...............I had a daughter on Oct. 7th 2015 but the birth was traumatic. Baby was fine to clarify but my labor nurse was actually really mean and one of the doctors refused to keep me informed about what was going on even when things weren't going so well and i had a c-section. But motherhood was better than the doctors thought. One, because I stopped having to inject myself twice a day in the stomach with blood thinner, but two because BABY and I had none of the predicted post partum so one thing went right. I was warned that after birth I would be extra fertile so I convinced P to try as soon as my 1st period came. 5 months after S's birth I got pregnant again with my second daughter. They are 3 and 4....... My life is a lot better. I'm not as bored, I do something I like and that seems to have meaning, and I get a lot of help which brings people in to my world. But there are nevers that exist. I have no parent friends. There are no playdates. The chores are hard and P feels overworked. I am not mother of the year P isn't father of the year, my brain will always be a shitfield and I will never be more educated then a 8 class certificate but I don't think about suicide much. On occasion I get impulse to throw myself into the nearest highway or whatever. I take the pills or smoke weed or run around without a coat outside in the winter crying. PM me if you ever want to just vent I will read every word."
