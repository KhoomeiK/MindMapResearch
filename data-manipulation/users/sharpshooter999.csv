gifs,ff80iab,t1_ff7zfoa,1579662814.0,"I understand that part of the issue is how accessible the terrain is for crews to do controlled burns. Here in SE Nebraska, we burn pastures and waterways off every spring. Now, it's not the same pasture or waterway, usually we do it once every 4-5 years on rotation. BUT considering that there's a road every mile and unplanted farm ground we can drive across, it's pretty easy for us to contain a fire to where it's supposed to be. Most pastures around here are around 20-40 acres on average. 

This helps get rid of non native weeds that can't comeback from a fire easily and control invasive trees like cedars. Nebraska was originally an ocean of grass, after all. About a week after a burn, you'll have the most stand of emerald green grass that would make Ireland jealous."
