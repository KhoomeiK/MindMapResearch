SandersForPresident,ffcxlf7,t1_ffct6f6,1579809375.0,"Exactly, I always thought it was odd that your parents income was the basis for FAFSA, as if that automatically meant they could (or even would) give you any of their salary. I get that with such a small budget for grants and such they had to make *some* sort of cut off point. It just seemed weird for me that even people who were estranged from their parents get screwed out of money because they can't get them to fill out the forms, nevermind that their parents income is inconsequential since they won't pay for college anyway.

I guess I always thought it was weird that we take these people who are basically now independent adults, and say, ""hey.... you wanna go to college? Tell me how much your parents make and we'll see if we have anything for you."" Especially since the followup to that conversation is, ""So hey newly legal adult, how about you sign up for this incredibly high balance loan that you can never get forgiven?"" Like, if we consider them legally able and culpable for the latter, we should probably only look at their individual income/net worth when deciding how much aid they receive."

[This comparison article](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/18174/comparing-the-most-popular-solo-401k-options/) is what I used while shopping for a Solo 401k provider, and [this  forum post](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=226150/) did a good job of covering the eTrade application process.

I also recall reading someone's anecdote somewhere that eTrade closed their Roth Solo 401k that had kept a $0 balance for some length of time, so I made sure when I opened the account (with my ""side business"" income from selling items on craigslist) that I had money to deposit into both Roth Solo 401k and Traditional Solo 401k accounts, to ensure that they would not be closed due to $0 balance."
financialindependence,ff4fchl,t1_ff3z74v,1579562265.0,"I know what you mean, there are some things that I just struggle to wrap my head around.

That said, maybe I can provide some insight... people in general enjoy a sense of purpose, and this often goes hand and hand with an ""achievable challenge"". Nobody wants to work on something so hard they bang their head against the wall with zero progress, but similarly if you had a job where you were just, say, physically pushing the eject button on a game console over and over all day (an actual QA job I've heard about), you'd similarly feel a lack of purpose and sense of accomplishment when you complete your workday. Some people are able to get that sense of accomplishment and purpose from their work, (personally, my job as a consultant scratches the ""challenging puzzle"" itch, even if I don't find it super fulfilling in a ""making the world a better place"" sense). Some people find that sense of purpose in spending time with family, some with volunteering, some are just content to putter around in the basement with little projects. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's likely you share a lot of things with the people who ""don't hate work"", you just don't recognize them because the things they get from work, you don't receive from your work, because, well, you hate it. It's sort of like when you get our of a bad relationship, it can be tough to see why people are so eager to give up the freedom and autonomy that you have as a single person... but that's because the benefits of a relationship are not immediately apparent to you due to your recent experience.

You presumably have things you like to do in life. And you presumably also have things in life that you don't mind doing. If you try and strip back \*what\* it is that you hate about work, you can maybe get a feel for what it is that other people ""don't hate"" about work. If you hate having to go to the same place over and over on a schedule set by someone else, that's one aspect of work, but there are jobs out there with shorter hours, or jobs where you can make your own hours as long as you get the work done. If you hate having to answer to another person based on their priorities and deadlines, you \*can\* become self-employed and come up with your own metrics for productivity and effectiveness. Obviously how much money you can make while doing this will vary widely, but it would still technically be ""work"". 

If you simply hate the notion of spending your time doing something in order to earn enough money to live on... well, that is sort of just despising the notion of ""work"", and if you struggle to get past that notion, then I can see how it would be difficult to understand people who didn't share it. If you're someone who is acutely aware of how much of our life we generally spend ""working"" and the existential dread that can accompany that, it will be hard to understand people who don't. ;)"

The machine painted minis are already a hot-selling product in the form of [WizKids blind packs](https://wizkids.com/dd-icons-of-the-realms-monster-menagerie/), so I'm not sure if a gaming store that carries those would be allowed to ""rent"" them as well. (Obviously if the minis came from some other source, it would be harder for WizKids to complain, but they could still try pressuring the store..)

I think this sort of thing would probably have to happen in a more ""community run"" D&D area... if you lived somewhere large enough to have a community center that could do this. You could even use one of my favorite sources for cheap minis... giant grab bags of HeroClix... you can get like 100 for $15, and like 60% of them are useful in D&D (unfortunately you wind up with a lot of Batman, and there are only so many Batmen you need in D&D). You could do ""mini painting"" classes with people to make them more D&D appropriate, and then sort them into appropriate bins to allow people to use them for their games. I would think this would need to be a ""check out and use in this space"" thing, rather than ""check out and take home"" system, just for the simplicity and ""shared use"" of the minis. I would love to live somewhere with this sort of thing, because I have some awesome ideas for some of the ""final battle"" terrain areas, but investing all the time into making them so I can run it once just feels like a waste, if I could donate them to a communal D&D space, that would be awesome.

If you really want a robust ""check out and take home"" system, I would start pushing your local library about renting out D&D supplies. I think that's probably the best bet for this sort of thing, they've already got the check-out system complete with late fees, and they already rent some unconventional things like puzzles and board games. I think as long as they could find the right storage/filing system for it, and if you could show there was enough interest, it's very possible to get this sort of thing going at the library. My (60,000 person city) library runs a D&D session every week, but the DM brings their own supplies, I can imagine in a large city there could be far more D&D sessions, which would be a great argument for increasing the stock of ""Library D&D supplies"", and making those supplies available to check out would be a simple progression."

financialindependence,ff3wger,t1_ff36yrr,1579550346.0,"You appear to be on the right path. Dual enrollment can sometimes be beneficial, though the reality of it is that getting your ""4 year degree"" in less than 4 years is actually quite difficult... even if you're able to knock out a bunch of classes with dual enrollment, many college programs have a complex system of pre-requisites and only offering specific classes in specific semesters that can make it difficult to actually ""get ahead"" in your major. In my experience this tends to mean people who did dual enrollment can have ""lighter loads"" in college, but it usually only results in finishing their degree 1 semester early, if at all.

That said, if you really want to buckle down in college, you can usually get exemptions for some of the pre-req conflicts and if you planned it out far enough in advance (of it the college was large enough that they offer every class every semester) then you could probably get out a year early, and 1 year less tuition isn't a bad start on the FIRE path.

Now, when you actually get into to college, my #1 advice is to look into student research opportunities. This will vary depending on your major, but as a CS major, I got to work on a NASA-funded research project (meaning I got paid an hourly wage!) with my favorite professor, and that research project looked \*amazing\* on my resume, and gave me something interesting to talk about in interviews (instead of having to talk about homework assignments which was my only other programing experience)."

financialindependence,ff3trfw,t1_ff3arko,1579548671.0,"1. The Traditional IRA cutoff is even lower, you need to make $65,000 or less to take the full deduction (if you have a 401k plan at work), so the Roth IRA plan is the only IRA plan that many people can contribute to (and after $122k, the ""Backdoor Roth"" becomes an option to get money into the Roth IRA)
2. You cannot pull money out of a Traditional IRA or 401k plan before ""retirement age"" without paying penalties for early withdrawal (or doing something like a SEPP, which you cannot ""undo"" or adjust once starting), this means that generally....
3. You want to have \*some\* money in Roth for early retirement, since you can pull that money out tax free and live on it, while converting your Traditional balance into Roth while you're in the lower tax bracket, thus only paying the ""income tax"" on the money you convert each year. Since the funds must sit in a Roth account for 5 years before you can pull them out penalty free, this means you generally want at least 5 years of ""retirement salary"" in your Roth accounts for maximum tax advantage (you can also obviously sell of taxable investments as part of your ""retirement salary"")."

financialindependence,ff3qqk7,t1_ff38t1g,1579546814.0,"Ok, before you do anything, you should look at your accounts... if you already have pre-tax dollars in your Traditional IRA (any Traditional IRA at any provider that's in your name), you may want to move that money out before you characterize your Roth contributions for the previous year. Your 401k plan may allow you to rollover your Traditional IRA balance, or you can open a Solo 401k if you have any sort of side income that you could claim as ""self employment"". This ""self employment"" can be something simple like Rover or Fiverr or any other [small side job](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/15-side-jobs-to-make-some-extra-money-4074574), and lots of providers offer Solo 401k, though I found eTrade to be the best when I researched it a year ago.

The reason you want to make sure you have a $0 balance in your Traditional IRA account is that once you recharacterize your Roth contribution to a Traditional contribution, you'll have both pre-tax and after-tax money in your Traditional IRA account, and when you try to do the Backdoor Roth to move those after-tax funds back to your Roth IRA, you'll be taxed on an portion of the funds proportional to the amount of pre-tax dollars you have compared to after-tax dollars. (In other words, if you have $12k pre-tax into Trad IRA, and you recharacterize $6k after-tax from your Roth IRA into your Trad IRA, when you try to do the Backdoor Roth and move that $6k back into your Roth IRA, you'll have to pay taxes on $4k of it, since 2/3 of your Trad IRA balance is in pre-tax dollars, the IRS won't let you choose ""which dollars"" you convert to Roth IRA, so it's important to have the Trad IRA with $0 pre-tax dollars in it)."

If your employer sends out communications, or has all-hands meetings where this sort of ""let's work together to make sure our company is the best place to work"" call-to-arms happens, then this works as an excellent jumping off point for you.

Part of it would be conflict of interest... the game store wants you to buy their minis and painting supplies... and also the mini manufacturers might take up issue if the store was renting minis rather than selling their products...

I suspect the bigger issue is that minis tend to be kinda fragile, so if you rented them out you'd have to have a really thorough process of inspecting/documenting them when they left/came back, so you could make people pay for any damages... it would likely just become a huge headache. Also, individual minis cost like $5, so it might be hard to come up with a rental cost that made it profitable to rent them, without making it seem really expensive to the person renting it.  


Another potential issue that's common with rental stuff in general is the ""peak demand"" issue... if a new module comes out, there will be lots of groups running that module... so now the monsters in ""Chapter 1"" are in high demand, so everyone wants to rent those... but they only have so many to rent. It's likely not worth it to increase your stock of that rare monster, because once this module is no longer the latest and greatest, nobody will likely rent those minis any more.

changemyview,ff3iwrc,t3_ere339,1579542011.0,"I have a possible counterargument I haven't seen yet... if all companies truly adopt the ""WFH"" mentality, you're actually ensuring that they all have the infrastructure and pattern in place to outsource jobs very easily. If they let people who had been working in their office in Chicago start WFH, and then one of those people moves to Seattle but gets to keep their job, there's no reason why they shouldn't also just hire people from Seattle (or anywhere else in the US to WFH, since they've already tested/proven that it works). And after that, there's really no reason not to just start hiring employees from other countries for much less money, after all, WFH is WFH, unless there is a compelling reason why you need native English speakers (like if sales calls are expected to be done by ""Americans"" when calling people in the states), then you might as well outsource it and get 3 employees for the price of one. Hell, if you outsource to South America you can even have them in the same time zone.

I'm not necessarily saying that outsourcing is inherently bad (there is some argument to be made for how much a ""cheap salary"" can help individuals/local economies in other parts of the world), but I do think there's a lot of  political ""weight"" behind that particular issue, and more importantly for OP (and anyone else working in a ""relatively high salaried country"" \[especially the US, because our salaries can get  sort of ridiculous compared to the rest of the world\]), if you convince every potential employer of yours that WFH is just as good as working in the office, you're also removing one of the biggest ""barriers"" to outsourcing your job. If your employer is convinced that working together in an office is essential to productivity, they're not very likely to even consider outsourcing.

changemyview,ff3g8ml,t1_ff3ankc,1579540412.0,"I would argue this largely depends on the age of the kids (especially whether they're in school or not) and the nature of your job.

Taking care of a 4 year old likely requires too much active attention to work from home at the same time, you can't really ""child care"" them from another room for hours on end.

Working 100% on work tasks while your 10 year old is at school from 8am-3pm, and then being home with them while they do homework from 3-5pm (maybe working 80% on work things on average), still gives you 7+(2\*.8)=8.6 hours of productivity per day.

Similarly, if you're in a job with lots of hard timelines (meetings, sales calls, deadlines throughout the day) it's likely going to be much more difficult to work from home while taking care of a kid than if your job is mostly ""working on a task by yourself until it's done"". Another factor would be how much uninterrupted focus your job typically requires. Some of my work tasks are ""head-down deep focus"" tasks, which I can perform much better when I WFH (I don't have kids), but which would be difficult to perform if there were kids around being distracting. And occasionally I have mindless incremental tasks (e.g. data entry), which would be very easy to stop/start as needed to deal with kids without much loss of productivity.  I would say as long as you can find the proper ""type"" of time (focused vs. interruptable) and schedule that to align with your ""child care"" day (e.g. focused work while the kid is in school, mindless interruptible work after they're home) then it's perfectly viable to WFH while caring for a kid."
financialindependence,ff3f3v2,t1_ff3btks,1579539777.0,"I don't use it... my opinion is that it's not worth it, because most insurance is not worth it, unless it's covering something that would be astronomically difficult to pay out of pocket and is likely to really fuck up your life if you can't pay for it.

Insurance companies only exist because they can afford to pay out:

* All claims
* All employee salaries
* All marketing expenses
* All office space leases
* All administrative work (dealing with banks/providers/etc.)
* All legal fees
* All lobbyists
* All ""referral bonuses"" paid to providers who get people to sign up

They can afford to pay all of that just form the premiums they charge their customer. In other words, it's a business model designed so that the insured individual (on average) pays in more money than they will be paid out (on average), by a very  large margin. And when you consider some insurance companies are also publicly traded, and pay out extra profit to their shareholders on top of all the rest of their expenses, it becomes clear that you're very unlikely to get what you're paying for with insurance, either from a statistics standpoint (i.e. the odds of it happening to you are so low that they don't expect to pay out), or from just a bureaucracy standpoint (they'll try to avoid having to pay out as much as possible, to the point of going to court over it if needed). 

I think this holds \*especially\* true for something like pet insurance, which is a ""specialty category"", it's not a common insurance people have, so the companies that do it aren't usually ""normal"" insurance companies (who likely have a reputation to uphold, and specific legal guidelines they follow across all their products). This means that ""MyPetInsurance.com"" can start selling insurance to a bunch of people, and then 5 years form now (when the pets start getting old) decide they don't care about their reputation any more and stop paying for things, or just declare bankruptcy (and potentially just start another company with their ""expertise"").

Not to mention the fact that you could just invest that money, or put it into a separate savings account, and you'd still wind up coming out ahead in all but the worst cases. For something like this, which can usually be handled by my emergency fund, I absolutely won't pay for insurance. Most ""large vet bills"" wind up being around $1000 in my experience... and if you have a vet bill that actually comes to $5000, it's likely time to consider what the quality of life will be for the animal even if you pay that procedure.

It's tough, because we love our pets, and they're leaning on that to try and sell you something that is ostensibly designed to help you cover the worst scenarios... but the reality is that insurance companies have a vested interest in \*not\* paying out for claims if they can at all avoid it. Personally I'd rather ""be my own insurance company"", because then I can keep all the premiums across all my potentially insurable events (which insurance companies have already done the math to prove are either statistically unlikely to happen, or will have a super high premium if it's something likely to happen), and then when most of those insurable events don't occur, I can just pay for whichever of those events did occur out of my private ""insurance pool""."

Simple example, say you had $12k in your Traditional IRA of tax-deferred dollars  (maybe rolled over from a 401k), if you try to do the backdoor Roth with $6,000 of after tax dollars, your balance will increase to $18,000 in your Traditional IRA, but when you do the conversion of $6,000 from the Traditional IRA to the Roth IRA, they'll look at the total balance ($18,000) and the ratio of your the tax treatment of those dollars (in this case, you have $12,000 tax-deferred and $6,000 after-tax dollars, so it's a ratio of 2:1 or 2/3rds tax-deferred, 1/3 after-tax), so when you try to convert $6,000, they convert $4,000 of your tax-deferred dollars and $2,000 of your after-tax dollars.

financialindependence,fel8uwm,t1_fekzihs,1579216584.0,"Apparently they can count your ""salary"" as being the same whether you work 40 or 50 hours in a week... this means you make your normal 1.0x hourly rate during the first 40 hours, and after that instead of making 1.5x, you just make 0.5x your normal rate. Basically you're ""salaried"" your base pay no matter how many hours you work, but any overtime you work you get:

 1.5x (overtime)

 \- 1.0x (already paid out by your normal salary)

.5x hourly rate  


 (See [example 2 of this article](https://wagenmakerlaw.com/blog/what-exactly-time-and-half-pay-answer-may-be-surprising)) Essentially it's slightly better than salary, because you're getting \*something\* for those extra hours, but it's definitely worse than ""normal hourly"", since your hourly rate technically decreases when you go into hour 41+."
financialindependence,fel80e6,t1_fel3eoc,1579216046.0,"One tip I have, instead of rolling your 401k into a Traditional IRA or your new job's 401k, you might consider opening an Solo 401k (you can do something like Rover, TaskRabbit, etc to earn some ""self employed income"") and putting the funds there.

The reason I'm suggesting this is that I wound up crossing the ""no more Roth IRA contribution"" income limit and had to find a way to empty my Traditional IRA account so I could perform the backdoor Roth.  

And there are benefits to the Solo 401k over your next job's 401k as well, you can control the funds in your Solo 401k, and if you ever need to take out a 401k loan, taking one from your Solo 401k instead of your employer's 401k protects you from the risk of ""early repayment"" due to loss of job. There are plenty of other considerations about 401k loans and whether they make sense, but this at least removes one of the major risks.

Also, having a Solo 401k set up is nice if you ever think you might make self-employment your full time job, you can park a \*bunch\* of extra money tax free, since you are able to contribute as an ""employer"" and ""employee"".

I did a bunch of research before I opened mine and landed on eTrade as the best option (this was over a year ago, so there may be other good options now as well), they had 401k loans, in-service rollover, and after-tax contributions, which means you could do Mega Backdoor Roth if you were ever needing to contribute more than the $57k you can contribute as an employer/employee. I don't know that I'll ever get there, but it's nice to have the option already in place if I ever decide to try ;)"

I had one semester where I worked 30 hours a week and went to school full time, and while that sounds stressful (it was), it also wound up being one of my easiest school years. It turns out when you have super limited free time, you do homework whenever you're able... this means I usually wound up doing my homework the same day it was assigned, which meant:

*  I had longer to work on it if there were any issues
* The relevant class lectures were fresher in my mind
* I had time to ask the professor about any clarifications
* I wound up being the ""expert"" in the class, because I could always help other students with their homework, since I was always ""ahead"" of them
* I truly had ""no homework"" most of the time

It turns out my mom's advice was true, ""If you just do the homework now, it will be out of the way and you won't have to think about it any more"", it's a shame it took me until Junior year of college to actually try it ;)"
financialindependence,fdoe46g,t1_fdnzq0y,1578603441.0,"This is really good advice, actually. I fell into my degree through the luck of having a technical knack. Basically my highly lucrative CS degree was the ""easiest"" option for me, because solving logic problems was less work for me than writing papers. 

It's such a crazy time in your life, it's really hard to give the decisions the proper gravitas... it's incredibly easy to be swept up in going to a specific school regardless of the loans you have to take out, or focus on a specific major regardless of the potential employment value of that degree. 

It's difficult because I don't want to blindly push ""STEM is best"", but particularly in this sub, it's hard not to hammer home what a [difference in salary there is](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors) between different fields. I'd love to see a push from the colleges towards ""mixed degrees"", in other words, have career-focused degrees that have specific paths based on other subjects you're interested in. For example, I found psychology interesting, so having a psychology-leaning CS track (say, human-computer-interaction, or AI) would have allowed me to get my profitable degree while also fostering my other interests. Briefly searching I see that [Yale actually offers such a major](http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/computer-science-psychology/). At my college there was basically no collaboration or interaction, the psychology classes I took had no relation to my computer science classes."
financialindependence,fdob9wo,t1_fdo3edz,1578602076.0,"This is absolutely great advice.

I just wish I had realized this sooner, I wound up working on a NASA-funded research project with an impressive sounding title that looked amazing on a resume. 

Having a research position in college is one of the best ways to get around the ""experience needed"" problem of landing your first job. Obviously this sort of thing is heavily dependent on your major, but even if you can't get a formal research position, hopefully you can find a professor who could use your help with something related to your field, which will still help you stand out among job candidates in the future."

I mean, if FTL isn't possible, you'd either need generational ships or roundtrip probes with mission timelines that equate to generational waiting for data... and considering how far apart everything is in space, even if you dedicated your civilization to finding evidence of other civilized life in the universe, the odds of actually reaching another planet while there was still enough evidence of a civilization having lived there is ridiculously low... 

The ""best"" that could be hoped for would be one-way long-lived probes of another civilization passing somewhere near your civilization at a point in time where you have the technology and range to reach it and recognize it for what it was before it drifted by or fell into the sun. And even that will likely require some precise engineering and intentional navigation by whoever sent it... I'm imagining a civilization that's advanced enough to do some crazy gravity slingshot stuff between different galaxies, that just pumps out new probes and continuously sends them throughout the universe in hopes that someday, one of them might be discovered by other intelligent life. And even then, as that civilization you wouldn't hold out hope to get back a response... it would have to be some altruistic thing you were doing to help some other civilization to maybe, one day, know that there was someone else out there, screaming into the void."
SandersForPresident,fc3rjls,t1_fc3ce7h,1577396821.0,"I'm curious about what sort of ""hateful loud mouths"" and ""pushing violence"" you're referring to in the Sanders base. I've only ever seen respectful compassionate people, the most ""worked up"" I've seen people get is around the media seeming to avoid covering Bernie (doing things like covering the 3rd and 4th place candidates but not mentioning that Bernie is in 2nd). 

That said, I 100% agree that we need to make sure we follow Bernie's example and be a respectful force for good, even in times when the world isn't ready to do the right thing."
SandersForPresident,fc3r3lf,t1_fc3c145,1577396503.0,"That's the craziest thing to me... I had become sort of jaded to politicians... it always seemed like I had to vote for the one who had the fewest polar opposite viewpoints to my own. I had to vote for the Democratic candidate because the Republican's kept putting up regressive idiots as candidates... 

Then the 2016 primary came along and Bernie came to my attention, and suddenly there was a politician who was saying all the things I personally believed in. We can fix the healthcare system, we need to aggressively work on climate change, we should get money out of politics, the growing wealth disparity is a huge problem in America, private prisons need to stop, we need to stop trying to manipulate other countries with our military intervention...

It felt so surreal to see a politician that matched my beliefs on a huge variety of issues, rather than merely following the path of luke-warm conformity to the party platform. 

The stark difference was highlighted in the 2016 debates, where Hillary was saying that single payer healthcare was impossible. It was such a slap in the face to hear that the ""presumed next President"" wanted to make sure that the American public knew that health care was super difficult, so we should probably just work on slightly improving the ACA, rather than attempting to join the rest of the modern world with universal healthcare. The same with the notion that a $15 minimum wage was ""pie in the sky"" thinking, yet since then we've seen many states pass their own $15 minimum wage laws."

The only way I've ever seen people ""change roles"" into project management is to already be working for a company and being handed a small project to run with a senior PM available as a shadow/mentor. So I'm not sure how someone gets hired as a PM without prior PM experience. ""Junior Project Manager"" isn't really a job role that I've ever seen."

todayilearned,fc0u5t6,t1_fc0s62v,1577299772.0,"Well in this case... it's a [song that was](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_stmo.shtml):

* Written by a man
* Composed by a man
* [Performed by a man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ytGaO2uXU&feature=youtu.be)
* Written from a man's perspective \*about\* a fictional woman who liked baseball (as opposed to being written from the perspective of Katie Casey) even though more than half the song is in quotation marks because they are directly quoting the woman the song is about
* Written about a woman specifically telling her ""beau"" that she wants to go to a ball game (so it fails the [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) on several levels)
* And rewritten in 1927 by another man about a different lady who allegedly likes baseball more than Coney Island

If a woman wrote a song about liking baseball, you might have a point, but when men are writing songs about a woman, and the only details we know about her are that 

* she prefers baseball to one specific other activity that her boyfriend might suggest
* she often repeated the chorus under various circumstances

It's possibly a valid criticism that the song might be appealing to the male audience rather than truly representing an actual woman's opinion on baseball's superiority to other date activities."
