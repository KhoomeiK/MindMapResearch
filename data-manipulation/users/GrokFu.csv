I regret leaving behind some friends, but I moved with my guild and it was worth it.

Problems are that PvP servers generally have better players - sorry to say that I don't mean to offend people but it seems to be the case IN MY OPINION. So gearing up Pre-BiS is harder to get groups. It can still be done, it just takes longer if you're going outside your guild.  The AH prices are different, mostly everything is cheaper so you don't make as much gold, but then there are hot items that sell for a lot more such as the book for quel'serrar.  YMMV

I don't regret doing it.  There's not really any tips except to go scout out a few servers and see which one you personally like best. Maybe meet a guild if you don't have one and then if it seems solid, make your move.
