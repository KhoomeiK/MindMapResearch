WRX,fff32fq,t1_ff3ck2h,1579874373.0,"This.   The WRX tow rating is officially zero per the manual,  any problems and your insurance may say you are on your own."
HVAC,ffeaxyq,t3_et4yc2,1579841664.0,One lone screw....   and what looks like grey tape residue.
Glocks,ffe16tm,t3_esljvl,1579834039.0,"I brought one home today also.  Feels just like my G19 but crazy light and sort of crunchy new trigger.    She will be a treat after a few thousand rounds, which I’m sure my daughter would be happy to do for me."
Glocks,ffe0usw,t3_esnoe1,1579833795.0,"Jeebus, that sounds like about 2000rpm.  Faster than the vector."
Glocks,ffe0qkm,t3_esx0p9,1579833709.0,One followed me home today too.
guns,ffe0lg9,t3_esx15m,1579833603.0,"I bought one today also,  $359 +tax."
NFA,ffe0ir5,t3_et3o0c,1579833550.0,Holy cycle rate.

Example of proper technique:  You are moving along in second gear, you want to go to third gear.  You apply your foot to the clutch pedal and press the pedal to the floor, then move shifter from second to third, then release clutch and fully remove your foot from the pedal.     Same applies when shifting from any forward gear to any other forward gear, up or down.     This is only left foot instruction, your right foot is simultaneously doing other things.

Edit: in the English language press and depress mean the same thing.  Depress does not mean “un press”."
WRX,ff9pk0s,t3_esfspg,1579718073.0,Proper operation is to fully depress the clutch pedal.
corgi,ff7v1t7,t3_es4tqm,1579659036.0,I’ve seen those crazy eyes before.
WRX,ff54wvy,t3_erf5wo,1579580333.0,"Yep, just point and slide. Weeeeeeee.."
WRX,ff54ddo,t3_eriedk,1579579893.0,"I lived in Ohio with my 04 SRT-4 for 12 years before moving to Kentucky and replacing it with a WRX after a deer totaled it.  I have the Nameless 5” on my WRX and it is about half the volume that the stock SRT-4 exhaust was.    For anyone that doesn’t know, that Dodge was one of the few cars ever made without mufflers. It had two resonators in the midpipe and that was it.  I never had a problem with law enforcement and noise, but I didn’t try to pipe them either."
Plumbing,ff1wudr,t3_er673p,1579488001.0,"Looks pretty tight. Good job.

Is there more to lay on that strut?   Length is a bit excessive otherwise."
WRX,ff1vuyv,t3_eqoprn,1579487342.0,You would be that stuck car if you had the stock summer tires on.   I like my Xice also.
WRX,ff1t8h4,t3_eqvy6g,1579485657.0,I miss effective e-brake power slides as I could do in my SRT-4.
INTP,ff1szx6,t1_fezucex,1579485509.0,I’ve forbidden my wife from sending me Pinterest recipe links.   She now just sends me a screenshot of the recipe name and ingredients and I figure it out from there.
INTP,ff1slka,t3_eqx3bj,1579485258.0,Depending on the day I can test either P or J.   I used to be a lot more J in my youth.
WRX,ff1o5j2,t3_er3f0j,1579482455.0,Subaru makes cars in America but the WRX comes here from Japan.
sharpening,fepjycf,t1_feoyb3a,1579322444.0,+1.  Those Spyderco triangle sticks are crazy useful.
