AskReddit,ffj6jvi,t1_ffir2dw,1579991660.0,"There's so much to unpack there I don't even know where to begin.

 ""Women are in power to enact change"". Yes. But not as many people in power are women as there are men, first of all. Second of all, the women who get into those positions of power are the women who got there by succeeding in the system that as it stands now. Why would they break down a system they succeeded in? They were successful. I'm not saying that even as a result of them being women I'm saying that as a result of them being powerful. The women who play by the rules get rewarded. The woman who don't get dumped. The ones who got rewarded ain't going to want to change shit. It worked for them, they don't see a problem. 

And third of all - and most importantly of all, you are greatly dismissing all the women in power who are trying to enact real change, of which there are A LOT.

I'm not going to look up research papers for you. Sorry, man. It's Saturday. I made the mistake of making one comment on reddit and everyone's on my jock like I have to write a thesis. There are many articles, many books. I'm sure someone at your local library would be pleased to help if you were so inclined. All I really got the gumption to do is invite you to think about the material you've already read a different way."
AskReddit,ffj554j,t1_ffiutsm,1579990650.0,Well take this as an opportunity to find more men who inspire you.
AskReddit,ffj4zzy,t1_ffiqnwf,1579990547.0,"That wasn't what I was referring to with my ""moving the goalpost"" content but ok."
AskReddit,ffipijd,t1_ffioi7k,1579979497.0,">I'm not really interested in trying to argue about who's got it worse anyway.

Then stop budding in and derailing people when they're trying to discuss systematic issues they face. Christ! Move a goal post, why don't you."
AskReddit,ffip7bk,t1_ffin3tr,1579979279.0,I have read several studies on the subject and it's far more complex than you're making it.
AskReddit,ffimo2a,t1_ffiko4x,1579977538.0,"I am the original comment. 

Sure it shouldn't be a thing for anyone.

But is their point really ""it shouldn't be a thing for anyone"" or is it ""Stop complaining about this because Henry Cavill was pressured into an unhealthy diet/work out routine""? Because it kinda came off as the latter.

Men have to deal with beauty bullshit too. If you wanna delve into it, check out the documentary Mansome. But women have to deal with beauty bullshit in a very different, heightened way. If you want to delve into that deeper read, like, any article about anorexia."
AskReddit,ffih58s,t1_ffig3rs,1579973754.0,"Do you not think that's still a beauty problem though? Because it sounds like a beauty problem to me that female characters keep being written as shallow sex objects. Look up the ""sexy lamp test"" sometime."
AskReddit,ffigz72,t1_ffightx,1579973640.0,Do you not think women have done similarly unhealthy things to be thin or obtain/maintain a standard of beauty set by Hollywood?
AskReddit,ffi9s54,t1_ffi7wmi,1579968726.0,"I bet I can name more bald leading men than fat leading women.

And Bruce Willis, man. How could you forget?"
AskReddit,ffi9p5s,t1_ffi7b44,1579968668.0,"Every male *action* star has a six pack, yes.

 But if you open it up to comedy there's a different story there: Kevin James, Adam Sandler, Bill Murray... I mean... I could sit here and just list male comedians. And probably dramatic actors too. But with a few standout exceptions, women are expected to serve as pretty even in comedies. There's even the old trope of casting hot wife with fat man in sitcoms. Dramatic actresses are expected to young and gorgeous and thrown out around age 35. Watch who they cast to play Tom Cruz's wife in his movies; they are not his contemporaries. In dramas they cast gorgeous women and then praise and award them for de-glaming. Think Charlize Theron in Monster.

I'm not saying there's no Hollywood beauty standard problem for men. What I'm saying is that it's on a different level for women. It's so present that I think it might have become invisible to you. It's like air, it's just the way it is."
AskReddit,ffi70pf,t1_ffi63ce,1579966765.0,It's very different though. You have to see that? Beauty standards are pressed upon women to a much more heightened amount.
AskReddit,fets6cq,t1_fesu27t,1579379389.0,"He WAS really goofy. But he did too.

I like Sherlock Holmes and House but I did get really tired of the ""I'm a colossal asshole to everyone but I'm excused because the script says I'm always right"" type of character. Blanc is not that. He's goofy and sweet and clever and bumbling along and so fun to watch. If he got a series I would watch every episode."

Hey guys. Anger is ok. You just have to have a healthy was to process that. If listening to an angry song helps you, great!"
TikTokCringe,fem4tjh,t1_fel9r4f,1579239785.0,"I mean, it's a subculture, isn't it? Or a fetish? So there are people who actually unironically like this stuff.

I'm just not part of that crowd so I don't get it"
niceguys,fegmys9,t1_fegja9k,1579097614.0,They're not looking at attractiveness as something they can control. They look at it as something innate - either you have it or you don't. And if you don't it's a free pass to be bitter.
SeattleWA,fegir18,t1_feg3iya,1579094033.0,"Fair.

I don't follow football. I just like the snl skit with Chris Farley in it."
