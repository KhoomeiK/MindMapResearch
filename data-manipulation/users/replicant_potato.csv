He talked about how back in the day the CIA used to do covert attacks on Cuban civilians, trying to just stir up trouble. They would fly civilian style planes and drop small bombs on neighborhoods, or shoot at houses from boats. Never ended up in the news, wasn't a military operation. Just sniping at civilians."
LivestreamFail,fdbonrm,t1_fdb3ur4,1578259564.0,You have no idea what you are talking about. They got multimillion dollar deals for going to mixer. A bunch of twitch bots in someone's twitch channel to inflate view numbers can't compete with a 20 million dollar signing deal.
space,fdbd3te,t1_fdba51c,1578256206.0,"The latest theory is quantum non-locality. That information isn't being transmitted across vast distances faster than light, but rather that the two involved particles are actually one in the same. That the distance in regards to those particles is irrelevant. By thinking about it this way, it doesn't break the FTL rule. But to allow this to work, one aspect of this theory is the ""many worlds"" concept. Quite fascinating stuff that I'm still reading up on.

I agree with you, that we've just scratched the surface of quantum science. We could get a major breakthrough on FTL communication, it's possible. The quantum world is just so weird, who knows what discoveries await."
space,fdbbrmp,t1_fdanh4g,1578255839.0,"It's because the entanglement breaks once measured. And since the two particles involved were not in a predetermined state, there couldn't be any reliable transfer."
space,fdbak2u,t1_fda7159,1578255527.0,"It's too bad quantum entanglement can't transmit a message, since it seems to occur basically instantly across even light years. I feel like we've just scratched the surface of quantum science, and I'm hopeful that major discoveries there could lead to a method of communication we don't know about."
space,fdb7h16,t1_fd9ebqg,1578254631.0,"I feel like if advanced civilizations are communicating, they aren't using radio or light. Because light speed is just far too slow for interstellar communication or even travel. We can't detect what they are using."

LivestreamFail,fd7rb3w,t1_fd7ns97,1578208871.0,It's crazy isnt it. Imagine telling people who made multimillion dollar deals how much money they could be making. I think they'll be just fine without the advice.
wow,fd7qd2n,t1_fd6jvzv,1578208449.0,"Same for skin choices on some of the races.

So your choice might be a cream colored white, a slightly less bright cream white, a cream white with slight blue tint, cream white with slight green tint...

Or it's either reddish tan, or yellowish tan, with 4 slight variations of each.

The choices are weak for some, and it would be such a simple addition to add more."

LifeProTips,fd0sm1f,t1_fd01wl9,1578123197.0,"Here are the scams that have been tried on my parents so far:


Calling pretending to be the IRS, Microsoft, the utility company.


Calling pretending to be a nephew / cousin / grandkid.


Sending scam emails.


Sending scam insurance notices in the postal mail.


Scam texts.


Luckily they have dodged all of these, as I have educated them or intercepted it. Two of them almost worked even after repeated education from me.


I suspect their contact info has been obtained from their church computer network, which doesn't really have much security, and is a target due to a lot of elderly."
