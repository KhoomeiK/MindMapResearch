cats,ff9qxfa,t1_fetp0tx,1579719066.0,"Good point. In my experience of having multiple cat households, it is so dependent on each cat’s personality. None of my 5 cats are related, yet they have formed a “family” that works often times sleeping next to or near each other and grooming each other."
cats,fetbf0m,t3_eqk9sa,1579373620.0,"BTW - I understand your sister’s point. Definitely. But you are presently being a living cat parent to your cat. And unless you really want another cat, what you are doing is enough. You can always support your local shelter with money or volunteering."
cats,fetaoca,t3_eqk9sa,1579373395.0,"Good question. First, I hope you have a healthy life for many, many more years to come. Secondly, I recommend you do what is best for you. With that said, I’m 66 and have 5 cats. My husband and I have a very happy family of cats that get along but there was a somewhat intense period of introducing each new cat.  But each one is wonderful! But I don’t think it’s that important to get another cat to keep the another cat company. A single cat can be quite happy “owning” the household and if you are happy, then that is a good thing."
