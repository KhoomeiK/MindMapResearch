bigboye,ffsmyfk,t1_ffs9ms8,1580185834.0,"The tigers in Texas  thing is a myth
There are more tigers in captivity than the wild, but those tigers and most cubs in the us in general are heavily documented and accounted for. Even pet tigers are heavily documented. It’s incredibly hard to find an unknown tiger. So trust me when I say that there are not more tigers in Texas than the wild."
aww,ffkhgwe,t1_ffkgd13,1580022827.0,"Ok and? I have been bitten by a pitbull. My aunt has one. Her husband accidentally stepped on his tail while I was petting him and he bit my arm and almost immediately let go. The dog has never been aggressive again and I don’t have any scars from that bite.

I’ve been bitten by big dogs too and some of them far worse than pits. I can’t put a lot of weight on my left leg due to a chow chow bite to the back of my shin. The chow hung on until his owner beat him upside the head with a bat. I’ve got scars all over my arms from being scratched by all sizes of dogs. German shepherds can rip your face off and so can labs. Most dog bites almost never get reported since their owners don’t want them to be put down. Pitbull bites get reported almost every time due to the media hyping them up to be devil dogs. Pitbulls aren’t the problem here. Dog fighters and shitty owners are."
aww,ffkgafa,t1_ffkems6,1580022281.0,"I get a bunch of sweet ones too and the best dog I’ve ever owned was a chi, but they’re very possessive and you have to make them understand that they are a dog and not in control. Once they understand that they are amazing. 
But too many people just assume they’re just like that and let them do whatever they want so you get these mean nasty little dogs who will take a finger off if they get the chance."
aww,ffkedj0,t1_ffk9vak,1580021389.0,"Depends on who you ask and how they’re brought up. I’m a dog groomer who’s been grooming for 10 years and not once have I ever had an aggressive pit. On the other hand, one of my other groomer buddies has a couple that need a muzzle. Pitbull attacks are a lot more likely to get reported than any other breed, so statistics really don’t help.

From a detached opinion: Pitbulls are a fun loving dog that make amazing family pets as long as the owner is willing to put in the time to train the dog properly and get it socialized. But that’s any breed if I’m being honest. 

However. Pitbulls are also incredibly strong muscular dogs who don’t know just how strong they are so when there *is* an accident it can turn devastating fast. They can do a lot of damage very quickly due to strong jaws.

But even dogs who come from a bad background can become amazing dogs and Pitbulls are known to come back from abuse pretty well with the proper treatment. 

At the end of the day, Pitbulls are just a dog. They have a bad reputation due to evil people who use them for bloody sports. You treat your dog well, it’s going to be a good dog. Pits are super smart, loving, loyal, and eager to please. You just need to understand them.

Honestly, the breed I personally think deserves their reputation is a chow chow. Awful dogs imo. The only breed that ever put me in the hospital and the only breed that I’ve only ever met two good ones."
aww,ffkcq2p,t1_ffkbfdp,1580020619.0,"Some of the worst bites I get as a dog groomer are chihuahuas, yorkies, and Shih tsus. All of them are spoiled rotten and don’t have boundaries thanks to their shitty, but well meaning, owners. A lot of dog bites go unreported due to human error."
