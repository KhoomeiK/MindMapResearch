cats,ffigrl5,t1_ffif6l7,1579973497.0,"Did you take any special measures to help with this or was it just time? My kitten came from a home (her mother's owners. She is one of a litter that was well taken care of). I've head serious breathing incomfort since last night and again this morning (with itching, and some swollen and slightly red patches on my arms, fingers and face), and I am afraid if I decide to wait longer, it would be selfish and just cruel to give her back then. I've been waiting a few weeks for her to be ready to come home with me so it's really one of the most difficult decisions for me to take her back. I cried."

I remember reading that they urinate in a vacuum suction tube and the urine will be treated and partially recycled into drinking water. Solid waste is compressed and sealed away and then disposed of when tank is full. Sounds fun, eh? I think you can find plenty of videos on YouTube."

offmychest,fe8ve57,t3_eo3jcy,1578931440.0,"It seems so cliché to say don't give up, but please don't give up. Take your dog with you and do some activities. If you hate your job but can't quit it, find some hobbie or activity where you can meet people, or set yourself a goal. Even if in the beginning, you don't like it so much or you think you're no good at it, keep getting out, you must absolutely break out of this routine you are living in. I promise you, it will eventually get better, I speak from personal experience. It won't be a sudden revelation, they might be some relapses on the way, but I promise you, one day you will wake up and realize you can't remember the last time you've had those depressive thoughts. About your drinking problem, I have a friend who has been struggling with those for years but I don't feel I am qualified to speak to you about them, please go see someone, go to an AA meeting or something. As for your self-hatred mate, again I've known what you are talking about but you need to snap out of it. Change what you don't like about yourself, or at least *start* trying. You'll also find that what we see in other people's eyes is often a reflection of our own thoughts, so maybe you need a serious chat with your wife. You might both be surprised and, worst case scenario, it will be cathartic. Wishing you well."

Anyway, I've wondered about this since I was younger. We used to have a sentry dog that we loved and I wanted to bring him to my room but couldn't, he stayed in the patio and courtyard. Muslims can own dogs, but it often has to have a purpose (guard dog, hunting, protection, etc). They are not considered bad as many people seem to think but their tails and saliva are supposedly unclean in the sense that it breaks your 'wudhu' (state after performing ablutions to be able to pray) and you have to repeat the ablutions every time after touching them. So not recommended to have them inside where the family lives and eventually prays. Cats do not have that issue. They are welcomed anywhere and are actually much beloved in much Muslim places. 

Now the thing is my research in the question has never gotten me clear answers. Nowhere, I repeat NOWHERE in the Holy Quran does it say that dogs are impure or Haram or any of the misconceptions that circulate about dogs in Muslim communities. It just says that prey from hunting dogs are permissible to be eaten (even if not killed in halal way). So how can their saliva be impure as some say? There seems to be multiple descriptions of events in the Holy book where the characters are described in the company of their pet dog, so it is clearly not forbidden for believers.
Caring for animals in general is mandatory in islam. For example, it was reported that the prophet (peace be upon him) said that a sinful woman (prostitute) was forgiven all her sins and would enter heaven for giving water to a thirsty dog.

Most of these notions come from Hadith (verbal accountings from the companion of the prophets and others) and you have to know that they are not canon and some are really not reliable sources. I've read some hypothesis that this hatred of dogs comes from an order given to kill packs of dogs with rabies. I dunno, at this point it's just conjecture. 

Basically, I've come to the conclusion that, as for many other things, this is a man made mandate born from ignorance. I maintain that my religion does not say so. 

Voila. Sorry if it was long, I hope this will be interesting to someone. Also I'm not trying to preach or convert anyone, this is purely information sharing. Would welcome anyone's feedback."

funny,fe4u100,t1_fe4nkhb,1578862752.0,"Let me translate for you since you no speak irony. Female genital mutilation is not a religious thing,  but most definitely a cultural phenomenon, stemming from earlier traditions that has spread in admittedly many muslim countries. Most notable religious figures and institutions are very vocally against it as far as I know. In my country, it is widely accepted as a barbaric tradition by recent generations, yet you will still find people, maybe in rural areas or from older generations (less educated, you have to say it as it is) still performing it. It's totally illegal and punishable by law. I can't give you figures and data from the top of my head but a quick internet search will provide you with answers if you are interested."
