Games,fekbqzy,t1_fekafo6,1579196732.0,I think the lack of backlash against game delays is encouraging devs to take more time when they need it since they're realizing it's not a massive PR hit. Which is good.
college,fehb9vx,t1_feh9xyb,1579113005.0,"Ah, I'm sorry to hear that. If you would rather do something else and write in your off time like you mentioned before, changing majors is probably a good idea so long as you've got some inkling of what else you'd like to do. 

If you don't plan to do an MFA but also don't know what else to do, I'd suggest looking into how much changing your major to English would inconvenience you. Likely your classes have overlapped a lot and an English degree is a little more versatile than a Creative Writing one. But if it'd add too much BS I wouldn't bother. 

That aside, keep your major if you just wanna get it done and get tf out of college and do whatever, be it related or unrelated, and keep it if you do think you'll go down the MFA path. If you do go for an MFA, only apply to fully funded programs. 

Just general advice I like to give english-related majors who don't want to study literature: the rhetoric and composition field is popping, so that's another option to follow post-grad. 

No idea what sorta stuff interests you, but there's plenty of options post-grad, too. It sounds like your University doesn't handle its creative writing program well, but there are still options out there for studying it after undergrad. Good luck!"
college,feh8ij2,t1_feh3bvo,1579111344.0,"Oof that's rough. I find smaller, teaching-focused colleges do better with creative writing and English. 

For the reading, I'd suggest a get-it-done attitude toward most of it while paying particular attention to a select few works of your own choosing. From the perspective of a writer, it helps to analyze what the writer is attempting to accomplish and how they do that. Use it as an opportunity to learn more of what writing can accomplish. Having to read a ton of stuff is very taxing, but it'll end eventually. Sometimes the mechanics of the writing and the historical context are far more fascinating than the story itself. 

Do you plan to do an MFA?"
college,feh2tdr,t1_feh2bdc,1579107970.0,"Hmm. No workshops or anything? What school do you go to? That's weird af. 

Also, you're likely to eventually stagnate as a writer if you don't read. I would suggest learning to like reading in some way, or learning to gain something from reading. You don't necessarily have to become a super reader."
college,feh1wg7,t3_ep4lc6,1579107422.0,"How TF? I'm an English lit major, Creative Writing minor, and I've done a ton of creative writing. 

The literature courses are necessary, though, as the study of creative writing at the undergraduate and graduate levels is the study of literary writing. It gives you a background to build on. Plus, most creative writing MFA programs still have you take at least a couple literature courses. 

But I'm curious how you've had zero creative writing courses. Are you following a roadmap?"
Overwatch,fefbfbp,t3_eou1cq,1579052623.0,"I love to hear that they're getting experimental and that Jeff is communicating this to us. Overwatch has been getting stale and boring for many people. Experimentation is good.  Jeff mentions that for a couple years their focus was on teamplay. Clearly that hasn't been working, for it has not spawned any satisfaction in the game. It's quite encouraging to know that the devs aren't determined to stay in the box. 

It's hard to determine if this specific experiment is the way to go. Personally, I think they should bring it to the wider playerbase to try. I hope they continue experimenting."

AmItheAsshole,fd01dpk,t3_ejkij2,1578112181.0,"YTA. You wanted to be consulted so you could reschedule and have your dog put under anesthesia again at another date? Jesus Christ dude. I hope you realize there's always risk involved with anesthesia. And, for a dog, the situation surrounding it tends to be confusing and terrifying. The time they have to go without food and water beforehand is upsetting for some dogs. Being brought to the vet, a place that is bewildering and frightening for many dogs, being put under, the confusion of waking up somewhere strange without their owner. The vet saved your dog from having to unnecessarily experience that again. You, the owner, know it's all routine. You know the neuter is necessary and the vet is a good, beneficial place for your dog. Your dog doesn't know that."

The manager doesn't give two shits that the workers are struggling, and the corporation doesn't give a single shit.

depression,fcm1gis,t3_ehs5oe,1577761754.0,"Ehh I'd be careful. I dated someone who was addicted to her self-hatred. She genuinely loved me, but got stuck in a pattern of doing things that hurt me because it gave them an excuse to hate herself more. She was kind and compassionate otherwise. It wasn't overt. But she chose inaction on behaviors that hurt herself and me, even for certain things that would have been easy to fix. When I'd try to bring up a problem I had with one of those behaviors, she'd immediately turn to self-hatred, letting it consume the conversation. Just like it consumed our relationship. 

People don't think they're worth improving when they hate themselves. They take bad actions, consciously or subconsciously, that have bad consequences. Self-hatred is a self-fueling fire. 

So, if you hate yourself, stop and consider if you're taking steps to fight that self-hatred before getting into a relationship. Of course you can love others if you hate yourself, but your relationship with yourself will always be the primary driving force in your life."
