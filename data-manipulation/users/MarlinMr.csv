todayilearned,ffg88in,t1_fff9gyo,1579900583.0,"> It’s a 22 mile race and humans have only won twice.

That's not nearly enough to settle this.


Further more... The fastest humans don't run this, they run propper marathons. 

In 2019, the horse won with the time of 2:18:51... 34 of the finishers in last years marathon championship finished faster than that. And they ran 7km longer...

Running 22 miles in 2.3 hours is only an average speed of 15km/h.

That's not fast enough to even qualify for the Olympics...

>The tipping point where humans start taking the lead is probably only a few miles past the current race distance.

The tipping point is where those who _can_ beat the horses don't show up to run, because they have a schedule, and it doesn't fit in there.

>Horses are our most formidable competitor for endurance.

So this is completely false. The true most formidable competitor is one of our own creation. The sled dog. We breed them in a way so they can burn fat and protein without burning glycogen. Meaning they can simply eat a little bit, and keep going. Humans refuel slower, as we need to burn the glycogen. We are also broken down, and need time to recover. Unlike the dogs who end up in better shape after an endurance race than when they started. They can just keep going indefinitely. 

However, like most other mammals, dogs lack the ability to sweat, and need to actually find their supplies. Humans can sweat, and thus can go on longer in hot climate. The humans can also carry both food and water.
