Basically, the people who are whales (spent a TON of money at Sephora, think thousands) and/or are influencers like the emotional rewards.

Everyday people like us....not so much."
aww,few44zr,t1_fevg7nl,1579405094.0,So this is why I've never really seen a smiling cat! It's a bad thing. :(
AskReddit,fefohyr,t1_feenq40,1579060872.0,Any recommendations?
insanepeoplefacebook,fdcdi3w,t1_fdbx0hi,1578272247.0,The first person is a public figure with a Youtube channel/IG/blog. She's definitely a woman and she's definitely nuts.

She curses a bit more than Safiya so that may or may not be appropriate for your daughter, but she's a good role model. [This podcast with her and her boyfriend is really interesting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdrA3eDipdo)

I wouldn't really say she's an influencer but more of a person who makes random videos and occasional nail art videos because it's fun."
Christianity,fcvxcym,t3_ej45ho,1578012247.0,"Yeah, I'd say I'm independent/non-denominational. So I don't go to church. It's very hard in my area to find a good church, since the ones I typically agree with doctrinally are mostly attended by people 20+ years older than me. I'd like to fellowship with people my age. While it's great to talk to older believers, they have families of their own and it's a bit harder to make close friendships with them.

The ones that have people my age are typically vague about their stance on important subjects and I get a feeling a lot of the people there who are my age are more interested in finding a spouse than actual belief/worship.  I'm late 20s and single and not interested in relationships, so it all feels so alien to me. I'm thinking there's really no place for single ""older"" women since women's groups have been (in my experience) all about marriage.

Even if I get past the emphasis on relationships, they've all been...very charismatic too. It's a bit of a turnoff because I don't like chaotic worship."
therewasanattempt,fcnn3hk,t1_fcnjuil,1577814628.0,Grain-free for cats is the optimal diet since they're carnivores. The only grains a wild cat would get is by eating the digestive system of a herbivore or omnivore that just ate grains.

Christianity,fbf5qw5,t1_fbf4vie,1576802256.0,"Regardless of my political leanings, I can say that Pence actually does believe what he preaches. He's not a hypocrite. I thought he was a poor governor of Indiana because he cared way more about dubious ""religious freedom"" bills and anti-female legislation than dealing with the issues regular Hoosiers really care about, like the opioid crisis being the worst in the US at the time, underpaid teachers, or fixing the dang highways."
