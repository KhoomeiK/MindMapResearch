Yeah, I agree. Gaming isn't overly constructive. 

Although any hobby can bring good mental health (unless your hobby is smoking meth). And sometimes people make it their job, so the knowledge gained from gaming can be useful. At Christmas I had to ask in a gaming sub for game info, so that I could buy for my partner. It's still valuable knowledge to someone, but not really going to save your life in an apocalypse.....

AMA,ff93tyu,t3_esaxha,1579704180.0,"I see that you aren't even vaguely remorseful. Here's a snippet of what scams do to people:

When my mum was dying from cancer, she was scammed out of hundreds. She somehow, in her unwell state, entered her Amazon password into a phishing website. The scammers then used her account to purchase high value items. We only found out because one of the sellers refused to send to any address other than the one on her card, and we received an item we didn't order. 

I logged into her account and found messages between the scammer and the sellers. They obviously pretended to be her. Stating all kinds of bullshit about having work done on her house, so it needed to be sent elsewhere. Signing her name etc. 3 other sellers fell for it. 

We got all the money back. But she was a young 63 before she became ill. Internet savvy and tech savvy. Never been scammed in her life. She was already struggling with the loss of her dignity, the loss of here ability to type coherently on her Facebook page and in emails. This knocked her so badly that she didn't go on her laptop ever again, for the remaining 2 months of her life. She was cut off from the rest of the world. 

It affected me too. I was horrendously angry because I had to read all those messages from a stranger, pretending to be my mother, who was dying. It was violating. And I'm still furious today.

What is done is done, and everyone deserves a second chance, but only if they accept that what they have done is wrong and only if they feel bad about it. You don't seem to feel anything other than pride for your own profession, which you gained through hurting other people. The people who paid for you to become a doctor, are human beings with problems. They have faces. And just because you now provide healthcare for the needy, doesn't make you a good person. That healthcare was paid for, unwillingly, by vulnerable people.  

In order to make this into a question; would you be angry if this happened to your parents?"

plantclinic,ff6heto,t3_ermr7j,1579627257.0,"I'd definitely repot that. The pot is tiny and needs more air circulation (not just drainage holes, but also holes around the sides). 

You likely won't save the blooms now, so just allow them to drop off. Blooms dropping are part of the natural cycle, it won't be in bloom at all times, but they usually don't all go at once, so there's definitely something up. 

Pull it out, remove any horrible spongey stuff from the store, and wash the roots. Roots should be firm. They can be silver when dry, and when wet they can be green, yellow or even white. Cut off anything that's papery or mushy (use sterilised scissors). 
Put it back in suitable orchid medium and a suitable pot. And water once a week _at most_. Do not use ice, as many websites suggest. And don't water from the top, you should instead soak the whole pot in a container and then drain.

Assistance,ff6d0f1,t3_erugmn,1579624520.0,"Been there, friend. Top tips: curtains open during the day to allow sun to heat the room, and close them as soon as the sun moves or goes down. This is obviously only possible if you're at home during the day, but I tend to follow the sun around the house and close curtains when there's no longer any sun shining into the room. Reinforce your curtains by hanging blankets over your windows, this in particularly good for night-time. 
Try to concentrate on keeping to one room though. Layer clothing, and huddle under blankets. A small blanket fort is also an awesome and fun way to keep warm, because your body heat will heat it up. Huddle under a duvet with a torch and a book, and you'll be snuggly.

AskUK,feqdjwc,t3_eqdv24,1579340487.0,"What happens if you don't pay: 
(From someone who was in the same situation and didn't pay). 

Bailiffs. Depending on which company they are, they can be reasonable or they can be arseholes. You will get letters with a chance to pay by installments, and those installments are going to be far less reasonable than the installments with the council themselves, because they add charges on top. The council also give them a certain amount of time to reclaim the debt (or so they say), so that often makes them unlikely to budge on what they see as reasonable. 

If you ignore letters, they will come to your house. They cannot force entry for council tax. They need to enter via invitation or through an already open entry point, so don't panic about that. Once you do let them in, they are then allowed to force entry. They may tell you that they can only set up a payment plan after taking an inventory of your goods in your house too, and that obviously means that if you default on that payment offer, your belongings can be forcibly removed. 

So, in short, please deal with the council instead, before it gets to debt collection. Make an appointment with CAB. And although I'm sure you are reluctant to do it, check if there's any other benefits you are entitled to. 

You are moving in the right direction, because you have a job. Just try to keep moving forward and in time you will become stable. Good luck. X"

I held my mum's hand frequently as an adult, too. And it felt the same way. Hand holding is important."

Damnthatsinteresting,fedy3ym,t1_fedut2r,1579022337.0,"I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to say here, because you've shared statistics which I can't view, and it's for France. 

If you are saying that A&E department wait times in the _UK_ are high, then yes they are. It can be up to 4 hours, in fact. We operate a triage system in the UK. Non emergent cases get seen when possible and they are usually the people who wait for 4 hours. 

We have an issue with people going to A&E when they actually don't need to. Can't dispute that. But it's better than people not going to A&E when they do need to, because they can't afford it.

People waiting for 4 hours with a minor injury is better than people bleeding out at home through neglect. 

With regards to the wait for other care/treatment, which is the care I was talking about, it is vastly exaggerated for the most part."

AskUK,fedpqeo,t3_eoigep,1579017220.0,"I see that you've decided to call 101. Please keep us updated if you get any updates. 

Social services can be hit or miss depending on the area, but they do have access to any information about at risk children in the area. 

_Most_ babies will be subject to Health Visitor care, up to school age, and they will know of any babies living in the building. Health visitors can also be very suspicious, for instance; I had a burn on my arm when my daughter was a baby and I was probed by my health visitor to make sure that I wasn't being hurt by someone. 

If you get nowhere with the police, you could call your local Sure Start centre and give them a heads up (that's where the health visitors tend to work)."

Damnthatsinteresting,fedknxv,t1_fedebad,1579013906.0,"Yeah some people think that if you have cancer you'll be on some massive waiting list and likely to die before you're seen. They don't seem to understand that our healthcare is prioritised.

My mother in law had to wait for her hip replacement, it wasn't an emergency. She also had to give up smoking before they would do it, which is actually awesome. She ended up waiting a month (2 years ago). She had an emergent gynecological issue and was seen that week.

They found my mum's cancer via blood test. They called her with the results and an appointment the next day with a consultant. She never waited more than 2 weeks for any tests or procedures. That's NHS policy with cancer. 

Also, with the new AskMyGP system in place at my doctor's surgery, I can get help that day. If I don't need an appointment, they let me know and point me in the right direction. If I do, I often get seen that day or the next day. It's a fantastic system.

And guess what.... None of us are bankrupt or rationing our meds, or dying because of healthcare."

Assistance,fed7p5z,t3_eoa0n2,1579002719.0,"I was going to post a discussion post off the back of this, but thought I'd just tag on here instead.

So, I frequently see homeless US citizens post in this sub. It has truly opened my eyes. But I don't think I've ever seen any homeless UK people post, and the response to this post has simply been people not needing help. 

It's not that we don't have homeless people, it's a huge issue here. So what is it? Is it access to phones/internet? Is it just that US citizens outweigh other Reddit users? A bit of both?"
AskReddit,fed745x,t1_fecfuaj,1579002014.0,"Oh I'd definitely rather be informed of a huge dick than a micropenis. In fact, I've had both, and Mr Micro was considerably better. 

The thing some people don't realise is that _a lot_ of women don't actually reach orgasm through PIV sex. The clitoris is the main female sex organ, not the vagina. And whilst it's far more than just the outside glans (it goes inside the body, kind of around the labia, and has a spot inside the vagina), it's harder for a lot of women to orgasm via the vaginal gspot than it is from stimulation of the glans. 

Obviously every woman is different. But honestly, size really doesn't matter for a lot of women, but you can definitely be ""too big""."

AskReddit,fed64e7,t3_eoemhc,1579000732.0,"Morally? No. ""Morals"" would suggest that someone would be negatively impacted by finding a surprise micropenis in the pants of a new sexual partner. Disappointment, maybe, but that's not grounds for righteous indignation. 

Sexual activity can be enjoyed without an average or above average sized penis, and even without a penis at all. Just ask any lesbian.

AMA,fecz1ln,t1_fecv7d3,1578990578.0,I have asked a similar question. I assume that there is no _meaningful_ sleep. OP likely nods off for a few minutes and then is suddenly awake again. But I've asked for clarification.
