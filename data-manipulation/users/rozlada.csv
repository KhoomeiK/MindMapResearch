SuicideWatch,ff5b7r9,t1_ff4rryo,1579585937.0,"Having a partner is nice and good and can make you feel amazing for short periods of time. But if that hurt inside you is deep you will still be able to feel that pain no matter what. Exactly as was said above, they won't be able to fix you. People are not medicine."
SuicideWatch,ff5aocw,t3_erozwt,1579585406.0,I relate to everything you said. I'm so sorry you feel this way.
SuicideWatch,ff5ahbs,t1_fetnwb9,1579585220.0,I haven't done anything useful in life. I am disgusting
SuicideWatch,fetnnfj,t3_eqjxmj,1579377284.0,Me too. It eats at me
SuicideWatch,felmr26,t1_fejwydu,1579225892.0,"I'm sorry about that. I was doing good right up until that time, which is why I would like to have that extra time with family."
insaneparents,felmhxx,t3_epluud,1579225719.0,"This is literally, right down to the name-calling, my mother with me. I'm so sorry OP."
SuicideWatch,fejtpk6,t3_epe0nv,1579185619.0,"Yes, probably around 16. I hadn't made any mistakes yet. Would've been remembered better."
SuicideWatch,feimg1j,t1_feho7fj,1579141957.0,My inbox is 100% open to you. Also. Is there a community health clinic where you live? Most of them accept patients without health insurance (like me) and offer referrals to counselors/therapists using a sliding scale for payment based on your income. I could not imagine losing my therapist and having to tell all my terrible memories all over again to someone else who's not even guaranteed to understand me.
SuicideWatch,fehb9ur,t3_eoyqfl,1579113004.0,Hey. I relate to many elements of your situation. It hurt to read.
SuicideWatch,feh9i4l,t3_eozwjw,1579111942.0,"There are many people in the world who will love, accept, and celebrate you for who you are, myself included. I ask you to hold off on this until you are at a stage in life where you can meet some of us."
SuicideWatch,feg0n21,t1_fefjdyc,1579071892.0,A bad thing that happened to me. I appreciate your concern though.
SuicideWatch,fef3ru8,t1_feehcf8,1579047490.0,I can't go a lifetime of having my pain eat me alive. I do hate myself but to be honest it's not fair to me.
SuicideWatch,feeh5xr,t1_feea5i4,1579033664.0,Maybe. But I have to think about self-care too. Taking myself out is the greatest act of self-love I can do for myself.
SuicideWatch,fediqv3,t1_fecabyl,1579012569.0,Something bad happened to me and I'm stuck. It's affecting everything in my life and I can't deal with this for a lifetime.
SuicideWatch,fedilcw,t3_eoc598,1579012458.0,Yes. I plan on doing it this year. I'm waiting because some relatives need my help first. I should have taken care of myself two years ago when the time was actually right.
SuicideWatch,fedhzk9,t3_eojirg,1579012015.0,Yes. Their true colors come out. And it hurts so bad. I never speak when I'm angry for that reason.
SuicideWatch,fec56ey,t1_fec406z,1578966814.0,I assure you it's quite real. I am describing exactly how I feel. Literally like being gored.
selfharm,fec25lb,t1_fe040q8,1578965551.0,I'm so sorry. It's a personal demon.
SuicideWatch,fdj6zo4,t3_elewpp,1578460215.0,"In early 2018 I wish I had been killed. I would've been remembered as someone good and beautiful, like a shooting star."
SuicideWatch,fdd4612,t1_fdcz148,1578294032.0,I read some of your other posts and I'm sorry about all the pressure you are under. I've not been in your situation but I know how it feels to have people looking at you and expecting you to succeed. I think you are a kind-hearted person who should be treated with the basic respect all good people deserve.
SuicideWatch,fdbzvl1,t1_fd35vjh,1578264486.0,It is terrible to go through. Everything reminds you of her and you can't help looking for her when you walk into a room. Time doesn't necessarily heal (it really doesn't) but it can bring that acute pain down to a level where you can manage it enough to get through a day. I am here for you if you want to talk about anything. I mean it. You will never be a bother. I know your pain.
SuicideWatch,fdbzge7,t3_ek933e,1578264273.0,"When I had a purpose in life, I powered through knowing that despite the evil and darkness in the world, I was a strong, blinding ray of sunlight. One person may seem insignificant, but I didn't feel that way at all."
SuicideWatch,fdbyjnw,t3_ekixpe,1578263890.0,"I will have to be alone when I die too. I feel really bad for the person who finds me because it's not going to be fair to traumatize them. I feel very awful about that.

You seem like a very kind and sweet person to want to help others. That's what I wish I could do too. In what ways would you like to be helping them?"
SuicideWatch,fdb56kx,t3_ekesc8,1578253954.0,"Sometimes it's the stupidest stuff that helps. I found a cute shirt for $3 at the thrift store and was like ""welp can't kill myself until I wear this out"""
SuicideWatch,fd0dix6,t1_fczxtj6,1578117284.0,I can't lol that's why I'm here. But thanks. I hope you are able to find contentment somewhere.
SuicideWatch,fczrt2m,t1_fczgdr4,1578107534.0,Then it was my perception. And it made me feel like life was worth living. Maybe I am feeble-minded or whatever. But it helped me.
SuicideWatch,fcxjcle,t1_fcwnmrw,1578064362.0,"I said that same thing when my last cat died years ago. I was screaming, violently sobbing, seething with anger and hurt, when he was taken away from me. He was only 1 year old, just a little boy. I swore I would never have another cat for as long as I lived because I loved him so much and the pain of that was unbearable.

Currently I have 3 cats. My home being so empty, hearing no meows or purrs, no one being happy to see me when I opened the door, it was a sad feeling. I waited a long time debating on whether it was a good idea to invite that eventual hurt back into my life. I decided it was just what I had to do. I still want to kill myself but I love my cats.

If you ever decide to get another dog, never think that s/he will be a replacement, because they won't be. Animals are like people, utterly unique and individual. You are not disrespecting her memory. Take your time to grieve."
selfharm,fcvnrq1,t3_eiwnv8,1578006080.0,There are people out there who would love every beautiful part of you. That I can guarantee.
selfharm,fcvlot7,t1_fcuey5e,1578004780.0,"Genuine empathy, actually. They were a former SHer themselves. The other part was shock because they thought I was just talking about feeling sad. I think that really drove my point home. I didn't want a pity party. I just needed them to know the severity of the situation, so if something happens it won't be out of the blue. I don't regret doing it but I feel remorse and guilt because I know they care about me."
SuicideWatch,fcu9wsr,t3_eiq4yk,1577976021.0,Same. I never asked to be born. If I had known this is how it was gonna turn out I would've elected to not experience life on Earth.
SuicideWatch,fcu9orc,t1_fcthgp6,1577975858.0,It was the only thing keeping me from hurting myself. The brightest source of light in my life. Woke up every morning feeling like I belonged and like I had something to contribute to the world. It was essential to my survival.
SuicideWatch,fctda4w,t1_fct2f9k,1577939633.0,I disagree. I once had a purpose. It was there. And I felt happiness. It did exist at one point in time.
selfharm,fct0ex4,t3_eiox1r,1577929647.0,"Yes. I broke down one night and did that. They had been blowing me off and dismissing me, even when I told them how much pain I was in. I had enough of being ignored. They weren't expecting it. They can't unsee what I did to myself."
SuicideWatch,fcssm0g,t3_einsh4,1577924071.0,"Having friends has no bearing on how successful you are. I went my entire time at college with 0 friends. Like icevic said, you learn to get used to it. And it won't bother you at all."
SuicideWatch,fcoj973,t1_fcmr0rm,1577833600.0,I appreciate his support but don't depend on him for anything. I'm ok with being by myself. Thank you for the suggestion though!
SuicideWatch,fcjgmqj,t3_ehi3sp,1577686876.0,"Hey, not drinking is veryyyyy cool. Not vaping is also cool. You're confident enough to be different and you should be proud of that. I was the same way when I was your age. I've never been invited to any parties either. They are overrated."
SuicideWatch,fcjfra7,t3_ehhy0y,1577685969.0,"Techically, though, you don't HAVE to do anything. Like you, I also get impulsive. May I take a few seconds of your time and tell you something I did? I was very upset one night and carved a very moronic thing into my left arm. Not deep at all, but it was a religious symbol. I'm an atheist! I hated myself immediately and started crying because I thought it was going to scar forever. But 2 months later and its outline is very faint. The scar is fading. And I am thankful for that. I guess my point is that maybe not every impulsive thing HAS to have consequences. Maybe saying ""I need to control myself"" is being a bit too hard on yourself. Saying ""I could find healthier outlets for my stress and anxiety"" might ease some of your self-critical thoughts.

Can you give your cat extra pats for me tonight? Your cat does not think you are a failure."
SuicideWatch,fcjeqai,t1_fcjdju4,1577684961.0,"I don't know what country/area you live in you live but in the USA some community health clinics offer doctor visits on a sliding scale based on your income. They can refer you to therapists/counselors who also will do sliding scale payments, which is what I've done. I wouldn't have ever been able to see a therapist if it hadn't been for that. Like you, I also don't have health insurance."
SuicideWatch,fcje80g,t3_ehhpaj,1577684492.0,"""Bitch reach out to who???""

That's a whole mood. And I feel the same way. I feel like I'm in such a bad state so many days in a row. Am I supposed to be better after reaching out once and never need help again???? Because it has literally never worked out like that.

I'm sorry you feel like this."
selfharm,fc7jxat,t3_egjnqx,1577509799.0,"Punishment. Also to satisfy my desire to see my emotional pain manifest physically. Like a cast on a broken leg. I can see there's something wrong, there's proof it exists."
