friends_tv_show,ffid0ey,t3_etsu6h,1579970948.0,Yeah it didn’t make sense. Why wouldn’t Joey immediately tell Rachel that it wasn’t his ring and that he wasn’t proposing when he was on the ground picking it up? It was just stupid and there were so many other ways they could have explained Ross and Rachel not getting back together.
DunderMifflin,ffgzc0e,t3_etkmqs,1579918952.0,"Receptionist Pam. She was just more likeable and genuine. When she got into sales and office administrator, she started to act like she was the “mom” of the office and become much more involved and nosy."
addiction,ffgyxot,t1_ffgy8zm,1579918654.0,"Definitely agree that some people are rude about people who use subs. Although I don’t approve it, I don’t exclude or shun anyone who is on them, because it simply isn’t my business. It’s their recovery, not mine. Most hardcore AAers will invalidate and dismiss someone’s recovery because they are on subs. As long as they are working the program, addressing and working through their issues, and not using heroin, then that is all that should matter. I don’t have any problem with people who are on subs while simultaneously working a program and getting therapy, as long as they aren’t on it long-term."
addiction,ffgbhs0,t3_eth1lw,1579902588.0,"I personally don’t support suboxone because it is so hard to get off suboxone. Withdrawal from long term suboxone use lasts a long time, much, much longer than heroin. For that reason, most people cannot get off suboxone and are on it forever. Suboxone is an opioid, and it can certainly be abused. If he is taking more than prescribed, then he is abusing it. If he is able to get off of it, then he needs intensive therapy and to work a recovery program. Many people (not all) who are on suboxone treat it as a bandaid to the problem of their substance use disorder, as a quick fix. As a result, many do not address and resolve the issues that led to their substance use disorder in the first place. That is why I do not recommend subs in early recovery, I recommend abstaining from everything because it will force the individual to address the underlying issues that led to their use. That is why people usually are either on subs for life or they work an intensive recovery program and work through the issues that led to their addiction.
If he gets off subs, he’s just going to end up back to opioids unless he gets treatment and works through his issues."
AlAnon,ffg7xsx,t3_etg618,1579900398.0,"Definitely, you need to wait to see if he’ll be serious about recovery. So many people are chronic relapsers, where they’re clean for a couple weeks, relapse, clean, relapse. That is so exhausting and you need to make sure you aren’t going to marry someone who will be a lifelong chronic relapser. Some people don’t even get serious about recovery ever in their life. Getting married is supposed to be a great time for you and your husband, you wouldn’t want your experience as newlyweds to be filled with stress, exhaustion, constant worry, and anger. Definitely wait a bit to make sure if he is serious about recovery and always will be."

It’s just that those middle years of their career was just a little different than the young and the hopeless era. I understand that people grow up and change, they just changed a lot more than others in the pop punk scene at the time (new found glory, sum 41, and even blink). I guess I feel that way because Joel and Benji are one of the only pop punk musicians to really become famous outside of music and marry famous celebrities. Benji and Joel are talked about in celebrity gossip sites like people, tmz, E!. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s just that it’s weird to see someone who used to have liberty spikes, eyeliner, black nails, and a “punk” wardrobe become so accepted in Hollywood lol. Obviously he’s 40 now and isn’t gonna look like that anymore, but it’s just something that we wouldn’t have ever expected to happen one day back in 2002.

Emo,ffc5llb,t1_ffc2wdt,1579792064.0,"They were awesome their first two or three records, but then they sold out and just went against everything they stood for in their early years. Benji madden, their guitarist, dated Paris Hilton in 2006 and even had a fling with Kim Kardashian in 2007 and was caught making out with Miley Cyrus in 2013. Now he is married to Cameron Diaz. Joel Madden, the frontman dated Hillary duff in like 2005 which was messed up because he was like 26 and she was 16. And now he is married to Nicole Richie. They just kinda ditched the pop punk scene and tried so hard to be mainstream with their 2007 “poppier” record and being tied with all these celebrities."
therapy,ffc2wbl,t3_esp8be,1579790194.0,"It’s just assessment. Therapists have to assess you for trauma, substance abuse, and suicidality because if you have a history of trauma, if you abuse substances, and/or are suicidal, then your treatment plan will need to be adjusted. They assess everyone for this.

Trauma significantly impacts one’s behavior, thoughts, and feelings. And trauma in of itself can lead to a diagnosis such as ptsd. They can’t treat your issues if they don’t have crucial info such as a history of trauma available. Trauma symptoms a lot of the time is in the “unconscious” and repressed and therapy helps to uncover the experiences, address them, and move on and cope from them."
recovery,ffb1goi,t1_ffayo9x,1579749426.0,"Yeah I understand, I see the hardcore AAers acting as “recovery bullies” and undermine people’s recovery all the time. They seem to think that whatever worked for them works for everyone else, when there is actually many pathways to recovery.
They always try to encourage me to get off antidepressants because it is technically a drug. That’s such bullshit and so dangerous to suggest. I’m not taking it to get high nor does it get me high lol.
Or they’ll say that people shouldn’t get their 1 month+ chips because they are on suboxone/methadone because they’re technically opioids. I personally don’t support subs or methadone, but I won’t exclude people who are on them from the recovery community. 

You are the master of your own recovery. Anyone looking down at you doesn’t know what works for you, only what worked for them. If you are able to smoke weed and not go back to the dope or whatever you were using, then that’s great! All heroin addicts in recovery wish they were able to smoke weed still and not go back to the heroin. I know I do. It’s rare in my experience of working with addicts, but you may be an exception. If it’s working for you, then that is all that matters. No one can define your recovery, only you. If you think you are in recovery, then that is your answer and what should matter."
mentalhealth,ffavh77,t1_ffasc0o,1579745434.0,"Yes, that is certainly true. It’s just more difficult for mental health professionals to diagnose. The impairment of functioning is actually a criteria of social anxiety disorder in the DSM-5 that therapists use to diagnose, but impairment of external things (unemployment, poor relationships, poor academic success, inability to fulfill responsibilities) are easier to recognize than internal impairment (fatigue, burn-out)

Kind of like a functioning alcoholic. Many people associate an alcoholic as someone who can’t hold a job and neglect relationships with others. However, there are many alcoholics who go to work every day and care for their family, but cannot go a day without drinking. But it would be harder to recognize because they function in society normally."
mentalhealth,ffaqo6e,t3_eslh3i,1579742232.0,"The key is that it impairs your everyday functioning as a human being. 

Are you missing out on opportunities because of social anxiety? 

Are you not able to seek or maintain employment due to it? 

Are you unable to make friends or romantic relationships and keep them? 

Are you unable to do simple tasks like talk on the phone or order food without overwhelming anxiety?

Are you unable to attend social functions such as weddings, parties, and holiday dinners due to the anxiety, where you feel an urgency to escape? 

Can you not fulfill duties and responsibilities because of it (scheduling medical appointment on phone, going shopping, calling customer service, returning an item)?

Are your academic responsibilities being impacted (skipping school due to fear of group projects, presentations)?

Anxiety is normal, but it becomes a disorder when it interferes with your functioning as a member of society."
addiction,ffap4qi,t3_eslbve,1579741195.0,"I recommend reaching out to r/naranon which is for family members and friends of addicts.

As someone who experienced addiction from both sides (in recovery and has family members with addiction), I must inform you that there is really nothing that you can do. You can’t save him, you can’t want recovery for him. You can convince him all you want but that won’t do any good unless he himself internally wants recovery. You can’t control his drug use and you can’t cure it. He needs to face his consequences and it appears that he hasn’t really had any yet. You can’t save him. He has to save himself. He has to want recovery, he has to put in the work, you can’t do this for him. Until he faces the consequences of his addiction, he won’t have any need to change his behavior. It’s a perfect scenario for him right now. Family members of addicts need to accept that they cannot control the family member’s drug use. It is all on the addict. It is difficult to accept that the situation is out of your control, but nothing will change unless he internally is ready to change. And he is clearly not there and you won’t be able to change that for him until he faces the consequences. And you are not responsible, you didn’t cause it, you can’t control it, you can’t cure it. He is a grown adult who is accountable for his own behavior. This is on him, not you. Maybe talk to his parents and make sure they are not enabling him. Enabling prevents an addict from facing their consequences. Whenever an addict is ready to hit bottom, an enabling family member “lays out a pillow” to break their fall so the addict doesn’t face their consequences. Your cousin likely won’t get serious about getting treatment if he doesn’t have to face any consequences. 

Addicts want to protect their addiction and that is why he is justifying his drug use by emphasizing that he has a job and a place to stay and is throwing a pity party “so I’m a junkie?”. He doesn’t want to own up to anything, so he isn’t ready for recovery. He eventually will feel the consequences, but he is in the early stages now and has yet to hit bottom. 

I recommend getting support by reaching out to naranon or alanon meetings."
recovery,ffanpx3,t3_esl4ln,1579740247.0,"It really depends on the severity of an individual’s addiction as well as the type of substance(s). I know it wouldn’t have worked for me as a heroin addict, I wasn’t even able to smoke weed or drink alcohol. I had to abstain from everything and still do. But for others, it may be possible. 

However, I work as an addictions therapist now and about 95% of my clients who try to use or drink in moderation or try to just use “softer” drugs such as weed or alcohol after leaving rehab end up right back to where they were before. 

I’ve never seen non-abstinence recovery among heroin addicts work. Success with it has been more common among alcoholics in my experience, although still rare.

But overall, it is not common among the clients I have worked with who tried that. That is a reason most treatment programs recommend abstinence from all substances.

But for heroin and opiates in general, 0% chance. Very very unlikely."
Anxiety,ff9yiay,t3_esha5n,1579724243.0,"It helps to prepare what you will say and rehearse it like a script. 

You: “Hi, my name is ____________ and I received a voicemail from the manager about scheduling an interview for the part time cashier position.”

And then they’ll just suggest a time and day and ask you if it’s alright. For example:

Manager: “How is Thursday at 2pm?”

You: “That works fine for me”

Manager: “Okay, great, see you then”

You: “Thank you, have a good day”

Manager: “You too, bye”

That will be pretty much the extent of the phone call. 

So, if you know exactly what you will say and rehearse it, it helps to prevent stuttering, stumbling over words, and pauses.  I always rehearse before I make any call to a stranger."

addiction,ff73eh6,t1_ff7026f,1579640328.0,"Maybe, if you get vivitrol without any treatment such as therapy and meetings.


I work in a rehab, I see how successful it is with my clients who actually do the work that is required of them in recovery. I don’t know who you know that is on vivitrol, but those people probably used vivitrol as a band aid and never went to meetings, never worked a program, never got any treatment.
Vivitrol is meant as an add-on to treatment. It’s not meant to be used as a stand alone. It would be pointless for those who don’t want to put in any effort for recovery to use vivitrol because, yeah, they would just move on to other drugs. Vivitrol is not meant as an easy fix, there isn’t a magic pill for recovery. It is a supplemental tool that works alongside working a recovery program, getting therapy, etc. 

And as someone who works in the addictions field, this advice helps my clients. Treatment centers would not recommend it if it wasn’t effective. Vivitrol + working a 12 step program and outpatient treatment. 

People who don’t want to do anything for their recovery, don’t want to put in any work, and don’t truly want to be sober shouldn’t be on vivitrol. But the people who do put in the effort, work a recovery program, and truly want recovery should be on it."
addiction,ff6qdyn,t1_ff6pggu,1579632699.0,"Yeah, true. It really is good for people who go to detox/rehab and get the shot on the day of their discharge."
addiction,ff6m77a,t1_ff6gqw6,1579630175.0,"Exactly! People always use that false 5% statistic as an excuse for not working the program. Then they’ll say “AA never worked for me”. 99% of the people who say that never do anything other than sit in at the meetings. They are not engaged, they don’t do stepwork (and if they do, they bullshit it), they don’t reach out to a sponsor or others in the recovery community, they quit after a week etc.) Going to meetings and working the program is a lifelong commitment. People go for two weeks and expect a complete transformation already. That’s like obese people eating healthy and exercising for two weeks and expecting to be skinny already within 2 weeks. And when they aren’t skinny in 2 weeks, they quit. 

They just don’t want to admit that they aren’t putting in any effort so they use this 5% bullshit as an excuse. They always want an easy way out. They just want to take a magic prescription so they don’t have to do the work. I see this every single day with the addicts I work with. Nobody wants to do the work or put in the effort. The success rate for the people who actually work the program the way it’s supposed to be worked is very high. MAT is just the easy way out. It’s always the people who never put in any effort and want an easy fix who request MAT. If they actually got out of their comfort zone and put in a little bit of effort, they wouldn’t need to rely on suboxone for the rest of their life until they die. They are just dry addicts. While they are not using heroin, they haven’t dealt with the emotional baggage and issues that led them to the addiction in the first place. Stopping the drug use doesn’t fix the problem that the addict had before they started becoming dependent on drugs. All of their underlying issues are not addressed. Most people on MAT are notorious dry addicts because they never worked a program to help change their lifestyle, behaviors, and thought processes. All they did was stop the heroin use. Suboxone is still an opioid, so they are technically taking opioids every day and everyday opioid use is not good for the body. 

I’m so glad there is someone else here that understands where I am coming from. Usually I’m getting attacked by pro-MAT people. They usually don’t want to admit that they don’t want to put in any effort. They want a magic pill."
addiction,ff6cod0,t1_ff6a7zt,1579624310.0,"I understand that it worked for you, and you should be proud, But for most (NOT ALL) people, it is just a band-aid. And the success rate for AA is not 5%. That measure includes people who go to one meeting then leave. You don’t get what you want out of the program by just sitting in and doing nothing. I work in the field as a therapist and people think that if they just go to a meeting and not engage, not do stepwork, nothing then it works. I mean the people that actually engage and do the work, not just sit there. The success rate would be much higher for people who actually did the work required of them in the program instead of sit in and just listen. I recommend you do some research on how researchers conduct studies. Their measures for this program include people who go to a couple meetings and quit. Recovery for no illness takes that short of a time. And it certainly takes more than 1 meeting to become successful from AA. I know because I was a chronic relapser before I got clean. 

And if you want to be on subs your whole life, fine, but most people do not want to rely on a medication that is technically an opioid for the rest of their lives. I work with addicts everyday and run alumni meetings as well, very few people come who are on mat. Very few. Not saying it doesn’t work for some, you are obviously an exception and you definitely should be proud of yourself. But in my experience in the field, most people who achieve long term sobriety did it by working a program and actually putting in the work. Most of the chronic relapsers who come in and out of rehab a hundred times are the ones who don’t do anything except take subs. You are an exception in my experience of working with probably a thousand addicts by now in my career. So, congratulations, you should be proud, but most people on mat are not successful like you. I see this every day in my job. 

I’m so sick of the annoying “5% success rate” by people who don’t understand research studies and use that as an excuse to not try the program. Going to a couple meetings and just sitting there and going through the motions is not working the program. These people being interviewed as part of that 5% are those types of people. There are more people like that who go to AA than those who are actually serious and willing to do the work. 

So, I’m not invalidating your sobriety. You are clearly an exception and you should be proud. But most people in my experience of working in the field who are on subs are successful like you."
addiction,ff69br4,t1_ff651tg,1579622162.0,"I agree, it’s crazy how many people recommend suboxone, methadone, or even Kratom or weed. Most of them don’t want to work a program or put in any effort to their recovery. They just want a bandaid to their problem. You are the only person that didn’t recommend mat and actually recommended working a program. I am an addictions therapist in recovery and most of my clients on mat end up relapsing. But the ones that do succeed are the ones who work a recovery program and live a life of recovery. Most people on mat or those who substitute dope for weed or kratom want the easy way out and don’t want to put in the effort and work needed for recovery. I see it every day in my clients. Recovery is a lot of work, but people expect to get a prescription and it all goes away. It doesn’t work like that."

All of my recovery friends have 5+ years clean from dope. My sister has 10+ years clean. I run alumni meetings at the rehab I work at and there are sooo many people who actively work a recovery program and have been clean from heroin for years. People just don’t want to put in the effort. People don’t want to go to meetings, work a program, do stepwork, live in a recovery house, stay in therapy. They expect recovery by staying at home and doing nothing after rehab. Those are the people that resort to subs. Suboxone is just a bandaid to the problem. Withdrawals from subs are way worse than heroin, so most people will be on it for the rest of their life. And most of my clients that were on mat don’t stick to it and end up relapsing. And most of them who think they can still smoke weed end up going right back to the dope. People just don’t want to go through the effort, they want the easy way out. They just go through the motions and expect recovery. Well, you have to work your ass off in recovery and those who do end up putting in the work get sober. I see them every day.

socialanxiety,fes3451,t3_eqheao,1579360938.0,"There are many members of this community, so there are gonna be numerous posts, some you like and don’t like. But a majority of people who overcame SA probably aren’t going to be on this sub, and the people who haven’t recovered won’t be able to make those posts because they haven’t recovered. So, a majority of people here haven’t recovered, so you can’t blame them for not making posts about overcoming SA, because, well, they haven’t overcome it.

And I have seen posts within the past couple of days about overcoming SA. However, nobody really comes to reddit to overcome SA. Somebody needs intensive therapy, both individual and group. Reading a post on how to overcome it or watching a video really isn’t going to be any good. That’s like telling somebody with depression to read posts or watch videos on how to overcome it, they probably won’t do any good. Same for addiction. Reading posts from people who are in recovery or watching videos isn’t going to get someone clean. They’ll need treatment. 

This community is really a place for people to vent and talk to others who understand them. I would never go on the internet to try to find ways to overcome a disorder because frankly, it’s not that easy. I overcame SA myself and went back to school and now work as a therapist. But I had to get intensive group and individual therapy to do that. Reddit wouldn’t have done a thing. 

However, sometimes people on here like to have a pity party, which I believe is harming more than helping. I know, cause I used to do that before I recovered. So, I agree it makes people more comfortable to live with it and less likely to escape their comfort zone in order to recover. And yeah, the memes are annoying, but maybe that’s cus I’m in my 20s."

I recommend reaching out to the naranon subreddit which is for loved ones of addict. I work in the addiction field, am in recovery myself, and was impacted by a loved one’s addiction as well, and sooo many people I know who end up getting pregnant assume that the baby will save them and that they will stop. Well, in most cases, it doesn’t and they end up relapsing. The desire for recovery is all internal and nobody can make somebody get serious if they don’t want to get serious. You can encourage treatment, but unless he actually wants to get sober, it won’t do anything. It’s very hard to accept that you have no control, but it’s reality unfortunately. 

What you can do is not enable him and let him face consequences. So many times when an addict is about to fall and hit bottom and begin to get serious, a loved one places a “pillow” to break their fall. So, don’t take away his consequences. He won’t have a reason to stay clean if he isn’t facing consequences.

He has to make the effort to work a recovery program (sponsor, meetings, stepwork) and to get therapy etc. A relapse is bound to occur if he is not doing anything for this recovery. Recovery doesn’t stop after detox/rehab. Addiction isn’t durable, but it’s treatable. And to treat it, I suggest him to work a recovery program, attend therapy, etc. Most cases of relapse I see is from people who stop going to meetings and working a program. But again, you cant convince him to do this. He has to eventually get sick of the life he is living and start to get serious. So, don’t enable him and let him deal with his consequences."

The most important thing you can do right now to help prevent this is to utilize the resources at your disposal. Go to a meeting and surround yourself with others in the recovery community.

I want Liam to actually make a decision about who he wants without manipulations and interference. 

Steffy was just acting so hypocritical again. She got angry at Hope back when she was befriending Liam during the whole paternity test fiasco, but it’s okay for her to kiss Liam a day after he proposed to Hope? It seemed lately that she was done competing with Hope, but now she’s back to where she was. But I also think it was because of the conversation she had with Ridge right before the proposal where he told her to do whatever he could to be with Liam. 

I hope that Hope doesn’t forgive him and leaves him for good. This is just insane almost 10 years of competing with Steffy for Liam. She was so right that it has always been Steffy that comes in the way between them and that she doesn’t want to share her with Liam. They need to end that whole back and forth.

The only thing you need to ask yourself is if he is serious about recovery. Is he willing to do whatever it takes for recovery? Is he putting in the effort? Is he actively working a program and doing stepwork? Does he want to look into living in a recovery house for a bit? Does he truly want this or is he just going through the motions? And if he isn’t serious, then that is definitely a sign that you need to leave because it will be very difficult and you don’t deserve the pain that will come from that. 

And if he is serious about recovery, then the only thing you can do is support him throughout the process. It will be difficult for him. He may not be able to do the things with you that normal couples get to do. He may not have that much time for you because he needs to focus on himself and his recovery. This is one reason that addicts in early recovery are encouraged to wait one year before they get into a new relationship. They can’t be distracted, they need a lot of time to focus on their recovery. The only way you can love him is to support him and not enable him. Don’t make excuses for him and make him take accountability for his behavior. Make him deal with his consequences. Don’t take them away from him.

You need to walk away if he is not willing to get serious. Also, if he is impairing your functioning (work, school, well-being, other relationships, household chores, etc.) then that is not good and you need to walk away. If you cannot perform everyday activities because you are worried about him, then I suggest you walk away. It has gotten too far at that point. He shouldn’t be destroying the other aspects of your life. However, luckily you said that it hasn’t gotten to this point."

Anxiety,fdsh39d,t3_emz4p1,1578702616.0,"I’m so sorry about your experience. I totally understand where you are coming from. I do not support crisis text line’s approach, coming from a mental health therapist myself. 
I used to volunteer for crisis text line, but I stopped because of the reasons you mentioned. We were told to, in a way, respond to texters from a “script”. Because of this, the convo didn’t really seem genuine and seemed like the counselor was a “robot”. I didn’t approve of this method, but we would get in trouble if we strayed from that method. 

Crisis text line is mainly good for people to just vent, not to really resolve anything. It was too much like “interrogating” the texter with question after question. It really is not effective for people in an actual crisis, only for people who just want to vent about something. Additionally, the volunteers are counselors who are encouraged to keep the convo as short as possible due to the high volume of texters. All counselors are expected to take more than 1 convo at a time. I was required to take 5 convos at the same time. That results in the texters feeling rushed and not a priority to the counselors. All of these reasons probably contributed to your poor experience. 

The therapeutic experience is supposed to be collaborative: therapist and patient. The counselor should have worked with you to explore a resolution to cope or work out your issues. It appeared that he or she wanted you to figure that all out by yourself. He or she should have brainstormed some ideas with you and made some suggestions. He or she may have been swamped with too many convos at once and did not focus enough on your convo. He or she was not very competent. 

I’m sorry about your experience. It must have been very discouraging for you. You expected to feel better and instead you were let down. I hope you can utilize different mental health resources for yourself in the future because crisis text line is not very helpful for you unfortunately."

It was very hard for me to get over my bf stealing, lying, cheating, and manipulating me while he was in his active addiction. But now, he has 8 months clean and is actively involved in recovery. He would never do anything like that now that he is in recovery. The disease of addiction isn’t just drug/alcohol abuse. Lying, stealing, cheating, manipulating, and secrecy comes along with it. Just try to remember that. She didn’t want to hurt you, it was the disease of addiction that was forcing her. I’m in recovery myself and also had multiple family members as well as any bf struggle with addiction, all that we have done was a result of the addiction, not because of who we really are. But it’s completely understandable to be upset with her for how she has hurt you. Even though I know addiction has contributed to a lot of the things my bf did to me, I was still angry and upset. You have every right to be angry and upset for how she hurt you, even if it was her addiction’s doing. And her mother is obviously in denial about her daughter’s addiction and wants to make an excuse for her, as she doesn’t want to accept that her daughter has a drug problem. So, her mother is blaming you. Don’t worry about her because deep inside, her mother knows that you have nothing to do with it. 

All that matters is that you want to see her. If you are too hurt and you aren’t getting anything out of seeing her, then you are not required to go see her. Do not feel expected to see her simply because she is dying. If you have some things you want to say to her, but don’t want to approach her face to face, then I would suggest maybe writing a letter to her. Maybe you could get out all the things that she did to hurt you so you can get over your resentment. It’s a lot easier to do that on paper than in person. But again, if she is physically and cognitively weak, then maybe that wouldn’t work either. However, it may eat you up inside if she passes and you never had the chance to tell her how she hurt you. But everyone is different. Some people can get over resentments and others can’t. It’s all up to you. But don’t feel like you’re “expected” to see her. Only go if you truly want to see her and talk to her."

You didn’t commit any misconduct and it appears that you never received any notices or warnings, so you should be eligible for unemployment.

naranon,fdmgd76,t3_em4jj6,1578548981.0,"There can be many reasons. 

One possibility is that a lot of times we like to make excuses for our loved ones’ behavior. For example, a parent may say “If I spent more time with him while he or she growing up, then this wouldn’t have happened”. Well, if that were the case, then all children who didn’t spend time with their parents in childhood would grow up to become addicts. They have a hard time accepting that their child is ill and they try to cover that up by blaming themself instead. And they may also do this so that their child doesn’t have to deal with the negative consequences, aka enabling. It doesn’t appear this is your case, however from what you wrote, especially since you recognize that this thinking that you caused his addiction is irrational. 

Addicts need to own up to their own actions. 
As long as you didn’t force the drugs down his or her mouth, you didn’t cause anything. He is an adult and you are not responsible for his behavior.  

Another possibility is that he is manipulating you. A lot of times addicts will use you as a “justification” to get high. “You got me pissed off so now I’m gonna go get high”. They just want an excuse to use and they want to justify their actions. They’re going to use either way, whether there was a confrontation with you or not. They just want you to think that you caused it so they don’t have to feel the shame. They just don’t want to own up to their mistakes and they want you to feel sorry for them. Don’t attend their pity party. You are not doing anything wrong. You didn’t cause this. He is old enough to make his own choices.

It may take a while to stop blaming yourself, even after recognizing that his addiction is not caused by anything you did. But after a while, it will become easier to accept this reality. Accepting that this is all on him, his recovery and his choices, is key. You didn’t cause this, you can’t save him, you can’t do the work for him. It’s all on him. He has to own up to his disease."

A promise from an addict is just a lie that they haven’t told yet. They’ll promise and promise that they won’t ever use again or that they won’t lie anymore, but that won’t mean anything. The lying, stealing , empty promises, manipulating, cheating is all a part of the disease of addiction. My bf lied so many times and made empty promises continuously when he was a chronic relapser. He was in and out of rehab 10 times in the span of 15 months and in and out of numerous recovery houses. I’ve watched him OD on heroin multiple times, he even cheated on me with some girl that he had a rehab romance with. I found out when he accidentally left his Facebook messenger open on my laptop and I saw all these messages. He also stole money from me and manipulated me. He wouldn’t last longer than 2 months clean. It was the hardest 15 months of my life. It was such a long, dark road. My mental health suffered, I was put in a psych hospital because of the breakdown I had from him. But I never left him and I forgave him. Everyone thought I was crazy and wasting my time. But I was with him for 2 years when he first went to rehab, it would be hard to just leave, especially since I know that all of that behavior wasn’t him, it was the disease of addiction. 
But now he has 8 months clean and is actively living a life of recovery. He is finally serious and committed to recovery. It took a while, but our relationship is so good now. So much has changed. But it took a while of pain and worry before we got here. 

I know you don’t want to leave him and I am not going to suggest that you do because I do not know him or you and that is not my or anyone else’s place to suggest that. But just know that if you stay with him, there may be a lot of pain and worry ahead. He may not be ready for recovery and it may take a while for him to start getting serious instead of just going through the motions of rehab and then return home. When he returns home, is he working a 12 step program and doing stepwork? He he in an outpatient therapy program? Does he have a job? Is he getting mental health treatment and maybe some medication? Is he focused on recovery and staying away from old “drug friends” such as his ex? Is it possible for him to live in a recovery house? These are many things to consider. If he is not going to live a life of recovery and work a program, then you need to evaluate whether it is worth it to stay with him. And forgiveness may be hard, but just remember that the disease of addiction is not only about the drug use. It also includes lying, stealing, cheating, manipulating. That doesn’t go away for a while, even after the drug use stops. Working a 12-step program with stepwork is crucial in getting rid of those behaviors. So, these actions are not really his doing, it’s his disease. Although, these behaviors can cause the people close to them a lot of pain, and it has already caused that for you. Its up to you to decide if you are willing to put up with that while he is trying to recover, because that will not end for a while, especially if he is still not going to be serious. If you stay with him, just try to let him focus on his recovery and you focus on your self-care. Do not live your life in constant worry of him. I know it’s hard to accept that you have no control, but this is all up to him. 

You’re never going to know what the future is when you’re dating an addict. You never know if they’ll get long term recovery, stay stuck in the chronic relapse stage, or remain in active addiction. It’s just something you have to learn to accept unfortunately, you have to take things one day at a time. You just have to have hope that he’ll get serious and show you with his actions (not words) that he is committed to living a life of recovery. 

I wish you luck with whatever you decide to do. I know most people here will tell you to run, even though none of us really shouldn’t be telling you what to do. If you do stay, just be prepared for a lot of difficult times. But recovery is possible. He can do it, it just may take a while. It’s most important for you to focus on yourself right now and your well-being. Don’t let him live rent-free in your head."

He may not be putting in effort after rehab in the aftercare department (not working a 12-step program, not getting outpatient therapy, etc). If nothing changes, nothing changes.

It appears that he is causing you significant distress, as you have been suicidal. This is not okay. You definitely have to focus on your own well-being, and this means detaching and letting him face his own consequences. Worry about your own self- care.

friends_tv_show,fddyrzg,t3_ekuzmi,1578327243.0,"I personally like both Rachel and Ross as characters, despite most people not being a fan of Ross. However, I am team Rachel with the whole “break” fiasco. Rachel said “MAYBE we should take a break”. So it wasn’t set in stone yet, they didn’t agree on anything. He just walked out and slept with Chloe. I understand he heard Mark on the phone, but he shouldn’t have made assumptions without even waiting for her to explain herself and he didn’t trust his own gf either. Plus, sleeping with someone less than 12 hours after he thought they broke up would still be wrong. They were together over a year, it’s disrespectful to sleep with another woman so quickly like that after a serious relationship ends. Even if Rachel did sleep with Mark, two wrongs don’t make a right. 


Ross just made assumptions and didn’t even give Rachel a chance to explain herself after she suggested the break. The break wasn’t set in stone, they both didn’t agree on it.  He was impulsive and insecure. 

So, I don’t think Ross cheated on her because he thought the relationship ended. But he was wrong for assuming and not giving Rachel a chance to explain. He just walked out and hung up on her. And then sleeping with a woman so fast after he thought they broke up. I am team Rachel."
addiction,fdchvi3,t3_eklm5q,1578275289.0,"In my opinion, she should spend some time at a recovery house following detox with incorporation of iop and working a 12 step program (going to meetings, getting a sponsor, doing stepwork). A 7-day detox program is not going to do anything about her psychological dependence. She needs more intensive treatment which can be tackled with rehab and then recovery housing. She may return back to her previous habits if she returns home, especially since she hasn’t been gone at detox long. 

A promise from an addict is just a lie that he or she hasn’t told yet. They have to show their willingness for recovery in actions, not words. Promises that she will follow your rules does not mean anything. Spending time in rehab and then a recovery house is action. Working a 12 step program and going to iop is action."
naranon,fdbe4ne,t3_ekhv63,1578256524.0,"It really depends on the individual and how severe their addiction is. Some can still smoke and drink while never going back to heroin, meth, coke, etc. However, many others can’t. I work in the addictions field, and more often than not, people have to abstain from all kind-altering substances. Many clients have relapsed on their doc (heroin, meth, etc) because they thought that they can still smoke weed or drink. Before they knew it, they were back to the harder stuff.
This is why most rehabs encourage their clients to abstain from all drugs. And many people substitute their addiction of heroin, meth, coke to weed and/or alcohol., and even sex. The problem isn’t resolved, they just substituted their addiction to something else. And once the softer drugs become an every day habit, they ultimately return to the hard stuff. Recovery stems from stopping all mind-altering substances altogether, living a life where one does not need to get high. 

However, some can still do that. However, in my experience of working in the field, it is not very common among my clients. It is one of the highest indicaters of re-admission into the rehab I work at clients who think they can still smoke weed and drink."
recovery,fdavqon,t1_fd4ws98,1578250862.0,"Wow, you are so spot on about all of this. I had the same experience. My bf was chronic relapser for the longest time and I’ve watched him overdose so many times. It caused me so much pain and at times, I wish I got out of it when it first happened. I’m also in my early 20s, and it resulted in me starting my career later than I should have. I met him at 19 and his addiction didn’t form until I was 20. I’m now 22, almost 23. Fortunately, my bf has almost a year clean now, is living in a sober house, has a stable job, is working a program (going to meetings multiple times a week, has a sponsor, did his stepwork), is actively involved with the recovery community, etc. But that is very rare, and I am lucky that my bf got serious because he wasn’t serious for the longest time. And many people never get serious.

And I’m glad finally somebody isn’t pro-suboxone. It is just a band-aid for the problem. They aren’t solving the issues that resulted in their addiction. They are the same sick person, just without the drug use. And they have to be on it forever and the withdrawals for suboxone are much worse than heroin. Many people go on suboxone because they don’t want to put in the full effort of recovery. And it is still an opioid, so it is not exactly being sober. 

I’m glad you got out of that now. I am sure you are much happier now that you don’t have to worry about him every day. Now you can focus on yourself, your career, and a future partner. You did not deserve that pain and constant worry. You can finally be at peace. I pray that he can get serious about recovery one day. But it appears that he’s just going through the motions. It’s great that you’re so strong and educated on this. Some people aren’t very informed and tend to enable."
recovery,fdara0y,t3_ek0gl9,1578249209.0,"He really should be focusing on himself and his recovery this early into recovery. Him focusing on you is likely a distraction. Getting into a relationship that is “new” results in a dopamine surge similar to how drugs results in a dopamine surge. It’s like a rush and it is likely very distracting, where he doesn’t have much time to focus on his recovery. He does not have enough clean time and I really would not want you to get hurt because dating someone in early recovery is not easy. It will be a long, long road. And you always have to worry about overdose with a chronic relapser. He needs to work out his own issues before he starts getting involved with women. I work in the addictions field and relationships that are formed in early recovery (whether it is with another addict or another addict) almost NEVER work out. And a majority of the time, the addict relapses. It is a major distraction. A lot of times the addict substitutes their addiction of drugs/alcohol to women in early recovery. And that is a major warning sign that a relapse is up and coming. They feel a surge in dopamine (responsible for euphoria) when they get involved with someone new. And once the rush from the excitement of a new relationship wears off, they often go back to the drugs. I’m sorry, but this is a major red flag that he is not serious about recovery. I’ve seen this similar behavior is too many of my clients and I warn them that it isn’t healthy for them, as they need to focus on themselves in early recovery. But they never listen and they end up relapsing.


He is not being serious in recovery. And until he gets serious, he will be a chronic relapser. You do not deserve to go through this hurt and pain, especially since you said you already struggle with depression and anxiety. Getting involved with him will make your mental health conditions much worse. You will live every single day if your life in constant worry because of him, because he is not serious and committed to recovery. He is likely just going through the motions. Don’t put yourself through this, you do not deserve this.


If you want to be with him someday, you can wait around and just be an acquaintance or a casual friend. Just nothing more, don’t go out to dinner with him or anything or talk to him all night. But if you do remain in contact, just know it will take a while until he is in the place for a relationship (that is, if he doesn’t relapse and is actively involved in working a recovery program). But from the looks of it, it appears that he is not ready for recovery and that the cycle is going to continue."

His recovery is obviously a big part of his life, so I guess he wanted to include it in his songwriting. A lot of musicians write about their experiences, and experiences with addiction is very common among musicians. I don’t really see him glorifying drug abuse in the lyrics though. It’s a lot about his life during his active addiction and how he overcame it. It must have just been inspiration for him in the lyric writing department."

AlAnon,fd2nblc,t3_ejw7m3,1578149671.0,"I’m so sorry you are going through this. It must be difficult to have a child while the father is struggling with addiction, especially fentanyl where it is very easy to overdose. I am fortunate that I never had a child to worry about when my bf was in his active addiction and a chronic relapser. I think right now, it is important for you to care for yourself and your daughter. This may include getting away from him for a while for the sake of your sanity and your daughter’s safety. It is dire for him to focus on his recovery right now. If that means that he can’t see his child for a bit, then that may be what has to happen in order for his recovery. Your daughter is only 10 months, so she won’t remember in the future if her father was gone for a bit in the first year of her life. I would suggest talking to him about his options. He can go to rehab and then to a recovery house for a bit while you are taking care of your child. It is crucial for him to focus on his recovery right now, getting therapy, working a recovery program, going to meetings, getting a sponsor, stepwork, etc. However, all of this is all up to him. No amount of convincing will do anything unless he internally wants recovery. He has to want it, he has to put in the work, he has to save himself. You and the baby won’t save him. Many addicts who have a child or a baby on the way mistakenly believe that the baby will save them, that the baby will prevent them from ever using again. But the disease is so strong, that that just isn’t the case unfortunately. He has to truly want recovery himself. He has to truly want to put in the work for recovery. And if he doesn’t want it yet and if he isn’t serious about it, then you may want to think about next steps. This may include possibly moving away with your child. But I would start talking to him and seeing where he is in the recovery process. Will he be serious about recovery and do whatever it takes? Or is he not ready yet and just wants to go through the motions? It is important to find out where he is and if he is ready for change.

I am glad that you are asking him to move out. I’m glad that you aren’t enabling him and that you’re being strong for you and your daughter. I pray that he can get serious about his recovery so that your daughter can have her father in her life some day. Good luck!"
starterpacks,fd2jilz,t3_ejx105,1578148132.0,It is sooo cringy when people put their diagnoses (usually self-diagnosis) on their social media bio. I remember seeing that on tumblr all the time back when I used it 8+ years ago. But I’ve even seen it recently on twitter and Instagram bios. And most of these people probably don’t have any of the disorders they claim they have. I always see dissociative identity disorder all the time too despite the prevalence of the disorder only being at 1%. Don’t understand why anyone thinks anyone would care what they mental health diagnoses are or why they think their diagnoses are central to their character/personality.
addiction,fd00muy,t3_ejrawl,1578111846.0,"I recommend reaching out to alanon or naranon. That’s for family members/friends of addicts/alcoholics. I’ve been through this from both sides (in recovery myself and was also impacted by my bf’s addiction). If his family is not aware of alanon and naranon, I would recommend that to them. I can honestly say that the effect of my loved one’s addiction took a lot more of a toll on me and was much difficult to overcome than my own heroin addiction. I am so sorry you are going through this right now.

The thing with addiction, especially heroin addiction, is that recovery can take a while. One has to be “ready” for it. It may be likely that your bf’s brother may have been simply “going through the motions” and not really been truly involved in the recovery process. I have not met many people who haven’t been chronic relapsers before they achieved long-term recovery. It can take years to get serious about recovery. My bf was in rehab 10 times and in and out of multiple recovery houses in a year and a half period. Then he finally got serious about recovery and put in the work. It took me fortunately only a couple months of chronic relapsing before I got serious. I know others who were chronic relapsers for years before they got serious. 

The thing to remember is that this is out of your control, your bf’s control, and his family’s control. It is all on him. He has to want it, he has to put in the work, he has to save himself. It doesn’t matter how much his family and friends want him to get serious about recovery, he has to internally be ready and willing to get serious. It’s very hard to accept that we do not have control on a loved one’s drug use. But that is the end result. He has to own up to his disease. You can encourage him to get serious and to go to rehab, move back into a recovery house, work a recovery program (AA, NA, CA), get a sponsor and do stepwork, go to outpatient therapy, get involved in the recovery community, etc.  But unless he internally wants to do all of this and live a life of recovery, then nothing will change. He has to own up to his own disease. 

So, I recommend informing his family on naranon and alanon if they are having a hard time coping. You guys need your own support, especially considering his disease is out of your control and there isn’t really anything you can do. He has to take charge of it. Convincing him and encouraging him is pointless unless he truly wants to put in the effort and do whatever it takes for recovery."
DunderMifflin,fcz56gp,t1_fcz4rfy,1578093889.0,"Oh yeah, you’re right! Thank you, I forgot about that. That makes more sense than Jim and Pam inviting them. Still kind of weird that they all decided to go though, unless Michael made them all go or something."
Anxiety,fcz49h1,t3_ejnal3,1578093358.0,"I used to be so fearful of driving. I would avoid highways in anyway I can and avoid driving at night. After forcing myself to get used to it, it has gotten a lot better. I remember the first time I drove a 2 and a half hour trip from Philadelphia to Northeast PA to visit family. I genuinely thought I was going to get in an accident before I left. I legitimately thought for sure that I’d get in an accident. But I didn’t. It was so much easier than I thought it would be. I remember when I reached my destination and I thought to myself, “Wow, that was not bad at all. Why was I so afraid?” 
So, it’s normal to feel anxious but just know that it probably won’t be as bad as you think it will be. 

One thing that helped me was to prepare. Make sure your tires have air, make sure you have oil in your car, etc. This helps to relieve the worry of breaking down. 


In regards to accidents, something that helped me was to look at the gps details ahead of time. This will ensure that you know what your trip will look like. Will there be a length where you are mainly going straight? It is a relief when you know there is a long stretch of just going straight with no merging, exiting, etc. I was relieved when I found out that there was a 95 mile stretch of just going straight once I got out of Philadelphia. So it’s good to get an overview of what your trip will be like before you go so you aren’t blindsided when the gps tells you while you are already on the road. 

Another way you can plan ahead, is to use Google Maps Instant Street View. It may seem odd, but I used that so I knew what the streets look like ahead of time. How many lanes are there? Does the road split? Is there merging I should be prepared for? That way you know ahead of time “okay, when I get here, I should know to stay in the right lane”. The gps will tell you everything even if you should stay left/right, etc., but it really really helps to prepare and know ahead of time what your trip will be like. Also, if you can, try to drive early in the morning when there are less cars on the road or after rush hour for your first time. 

So, preparing was really important for me, it helped reduce the anxiety a bit so that I wasn’t blindsided while on the road and so I knew what to expect. But, the only way to get over the fear is to just do it. It’s definitely scary, but it’s unfortunately the only way to get over it. And once you do it the first time, you’ll realize that it wasn’t so bad. I promise that once that first time is over, you’ll be much less fearful in the future. Good luck!"
DunderMifflin,fcyvdr9,t3_ejlu8p,1578087905.0,"Yeah, I generally skip over that episode. I never heard of anyone inviting their entire office to their child’s christening. Maybe a couple close coworkers, but the entire office? That just doesn’t make any sense. Plus, why would all of them go? None of them had anything better to do on a Sunday morning? I find it hard to believe that someone like Ryan or Meredith would have wanted to go. 

Jim and Pam have no backbone at all and never stand up for themselves. One flaw about Jim is that he is so afraid of everyone and afraid of confrontation. Like in Seminar when he actually hid from his former elementary school friend. He should have said something to that lady that complained about the food being gone.  And it was so cringy when Jim actually thought Angela kidnapped CeCe. 

And then when Michael and Andy get on the bus to go to Mexico for months with no belongings or change of clothes with no consideration for their jobs, family, etc. Michael was actually willing to lose his job and leave his condo and employees behind? And why does Andy think this would impress Erin? It would have been a very generous thing, but those two would be the last to survive staying in Mexico. It seemed out of character for them in my opinion. And the way they went about it was very cringy."
addiction,fcyr1qj,t3_ejkhm6,1578085303.0,"Yeah, what the others said. You will become part of the recovery community by going to AA, NA, CA meetings. You meet so many great people and some become your best friends. Everyone in this community holds each other accountable and holds each other up. You will meet a great group of people that you can hang out with without alcohol or drugs. I met some of my best friends at these meetings. It is very intimidating at first, but we were all newcomers at one point. Everyone is so welcoming to newcomers and truly want the best for them. If you give a 12-step program a try, then you will definitely meet people that you can surround yourself with and become great friends with. And you will get so many numbers of people that you can call or text whenever you need to reach out when you’re feeling like using."
addiction,fcxfjpp,t3_ejfm2w,1578061612.0,"Well, unfortunately there isn’t much that you can do for him. He has to want it, he has to do the work, he has to save himself. You can try to encourage him to get help, but the end result is that he has to put in the effort. I would suggest encouraging him to go to a detox/rehab and then a recovery house. It is very difficult to stay clean when you are living in the same environment that you previously used in during your active addiction. He has to get away from the people, places, and things associated with his addiction and a recovery house is one way to achieve that. Additionally, another person mentioned the vivitrol shot. It’s a once monthly shot that blocks the effects of all opiates as well as alcohol. So, if he tries to use heroin, then he won’t feel the effects, he’ll vomit most likely. So, he won’t use if he knows that he won’t feel the effects. However, if he is polyaddict, then it won’t do anything if he decides to use coke, meth or another drug that isn’t an opiate or alcohol. However, it is crucial to get co-occurring treatment while on the shot. He may need to attend an intensive outpatient program and get individual therapy. He also may want to work a recovery program (AA, NA, CA). Going to meetings, doing the stepwork, having a sponsor, and getting involved in the recovery community is important for so many recovering addicts. 

However, it is all up to him to put in the effort. You can try to convince him all you want, but it will be pointless until he really wants recovery internally. You can’t control it or cure it. He has to own up to his disease. He has to want it, he has to put in the work, he has to save himself. If you are having a difficult time coping, I recommend seeking out alanon meetings, as they are for family members and friends of addicts. Since his disease is out of your control, support may be what you need. 

You can try talking to him, but just know that what ever he decides to do is on him, not on you. Good luck and I’m sorry you are dealing with this."
