NoStupidQuestions,ffbg9c8,t3_esox2h,1579763952.0,"It's not weird. It's nice that you have your dog but I also think it's important to have someone else around that you can really have a conversation with (coming from someone with no friends lol). As long as you don't feel like it's an issue, it's all good.

Maybe one day you'll stumble upon someone who is easy to talk to and could be your friend.

If you want to have friends you could start small with like internet friends and then maybe joining some book club or something (then you'll also have a common topic, the book)."
