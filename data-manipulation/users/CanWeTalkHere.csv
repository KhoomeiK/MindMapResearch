First they were officer only insurance, then banking, then expanded to all military, then expanded into other products and services.  I think they aspired to be a top tier PCS (Private Client Services) provider and they reached out to me a number of times (looking at my bank balance I'm guessing) to join their HNW private client services, but I never did.  I felt they were fine as a transactions platform but that's as far as it went (for me) and I had my doubts about their ability to compete with the top echelon.

This retreat from investment management services and solutions is acknowledgement (in my mind) of what I've often wondered.  It just isn't their core competency (insurance, banking, and technology for insurance/banking)."

Entrepreneur,fe93xzj,t1_fe8w3ke,1578933932.0,"I should write a book on all of my ""sage"" advice ;-).  I spent years and years dating all sorts of women in cities mostly along the coasts in my 20's and 30's.  I don't know where to start but just a couple of thoughts off the top of my head:

\- Cities are vastly different from each other, in dating culture.  Attributes that are favored in some cities aren't in others.  You mention LA.  Similar to Miami, looks and **flashy** wealth seem to be highly valued there.  That was never my thing.  I was decent looking but not LA good looking, and I'm not flashy.

\- DC has a great girl/guy ratio and for the most part, the women are there to try to make a difference.  The culture seems to be kind of toxic **these days** but in the past, some of the best women in the country went to DC to make the world a better place.

\- NYC has independent, educated, fashion sensible women and the ratio is good.  Recommended.

\- SF is tough as a guy because seemingly everyone is a tech bro so even if you're moderately successful you may not seem so.

\- Seattle is similar.  Seattle is (or at least was) like a combination of SF and the Midwest.  By midwest I mean ""polite but aloof"".

\- Other Florida cities besides Miami (Tampa, Orlando) can be ""okay"" but you have to live in Florida which is great for tax reasons but not that great otherwise IMHO.

But mostly, it's about you.  Have a real and solid plan for your future and just be a good person/man.  Genuinely good, not ""superficially nice/good, just to get a girl"", because most women who are secure with themselves see right through the fakers.  FWIW, I'll immodestly say that I'm a good person, but it wasn't until I got my shit together and I figured out my plan for my professional future (early-30's) that my future wife hunted me, not the other way around."

WWI wasn’t called a World War at the time (although it remains the best example of conflict irrationally getting out of hand and swamping multiple societies).  Most people get hung up on the word “World” and what that means in their own head, but that means different things to different people.

I personally think it’s safe to say that any conflict that involves ALL OUT effort by more than two societies (three or more) is just an outright clusterfuck and thus in the running to be considered a World War for all intents and purposes.  The likelihood of this going from two, to three or more is nontrivial.

education,fdcswwl,t3_ekfks5,1578283399.0,"I've always been sort of personally interested in why ""Harvard"" and ""William & Mary"" didn't progress to become equally prestigious today.  I don't know how much of the below is true, but this answer from a Quora question was of great interest to me and it does imply some possible reasons (e.g., the last paragraph...graduates are money maker graduates):

*Wm & Mary was established by people who valued schooling, but in an area where education was never as much in the local ethos as it was in New England.*

*In an era when few got any schooling and those who got any got about four years, Puritan New Englanders valued education more than any others, even before the Enlightenment.*

*They liked having sons able to read the Vulgate’s Latin, debased tho’ it was, to read, the New Testament in its uneven Greek, and to read the Old Testament in Hebrew. This followed the Reformation, which denied any church as intercessor between God and man. Ideally each (literate) man would read the Bible and figure out what he needed to be saved with no help from priests, bishops, or a Pope. Even in the early 1600s most top talent still went into saving souls. The average lifespan then was 35 years so death was always near.*

*Boston-area Puritans wanted their clergy educated, so they thought about establishing a university to educate them. In 1636, they founded what became Harvard College. The year before in 1635, they had already founded a Latin grammar school to prepare young men for college.*

*As planned, Harvard College took in no students until 1639, when most came from the Latin grammar school just mentioned. Harvard’s 1st class graduated in 1642. College then was just three years and entered by young men from 12 to 15 years.*

*Boston was a port to which young men from all American colonies from Bermuda to Barbados and north came. Still, most Harvards were from Massachusetts.*

*Believing that Harvard students were too worldly, a group of Harvard men tried to get it right the 2d time and in 1701 founded what later became Yale in New Haven, CY. New Haven was then another bustling seaport accessible from all seaward directions. The Puritan Church had better luck keeping Yale on the straight and narrow.*

*Harvard and Yale had better standards of schooling than Wm & Mary. They were easy to reach by sea and located where word of their education could travel far and often.*

*Princeton was founded in 1746 by several Yale graduates, who followed the same Puritan tradition of education. Yet Princeton’s founders were Presbyterians not members of the Puritan Church which later became the Congregationalist Church.*

*Since their founding, H’, P’, and Y’ attracted graduates who were likelier sons of real money-makers (ie traders and later industrialists) than sons of gentlemen planters.*"
