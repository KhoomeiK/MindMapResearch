TwoXChromosomes,fee94ke,t3_eoip7f,1579028952.0,"Sounds like a few horny guys that are clearly experiencing attraction to their professor and unable to deal with it. While that's highly common (attraction happens) it's definitely not the professor's problem they can't deal, nor is she probably even aware... or cares. If she's confident enough in her wardrobe, falls inline with the institution's dress-code, and it's not coming from peers, leadership, she probably just says it's their problem, not hers. Ask her

Out of curiosity, since these are your friends I'd assume you know them and talk to them... Are they generally unable to cope with sexual attraction or were they just making light conversation and not that strongly opinionated on the subject? When I went to college, lips were loose and sometimes things said were quick and very shortsighted/internalized reasoning and not stating iron-clad thoughts."

askscience,fdp17cc,t3_emg093,1578617565.0,One thought is they'd want to ensure transport vessel hosting the black box can also ping outward in the devastating scenario it sinks in the ocean or lost on land. The housing of the black box ensures it's survival and allows it to go into mayday mode. A streaming option might fail upon impact and weaken the search for it.

worldnews,fde6p1h,t1_fde3j81,1578332373.0,"I'd only add to this with the thought the US took out a terrorist (and I do believe he was a terrorist leader figure) and that should be commended in the region and US where this general and terrorist organizer has in fact killed his own, locals, and US troops. No tears shed. What I don't stand for is our commander in chief mouthing off on twitter and beating his chest he called for it. It's supposed to of been a decision of humility and inject further stability to M.E., not a stroke to a leader's ego. Makes it feel personal and not in the interest of the US. The tit for tat crap sounds like lesser countries when they feel threatened, now Trump is doing it. Not a good look for what should be viewed as the country of hope, strength, unity, stability, compassion, and most of all peace-makers. Again, just one American citizen's optics of this epidemic."

There's complacency amongst world leadership to look the other way when it's A)not in their back yard, B)So they don't have to escalate by calling something out. DPRK did this through all 8 years of Obama and Iran succeeded in getting US to bend while still sponsering terror in their region along with lying about their nuclear ambitions. Trumps an idiot, his rhetoric is more dangerous than action taken. I hope the UN council, along with the US senate demand intel that led to action. If it was appropriate action, we should be conducting counter-terror measures. If not, he (along with his croonies) should be held for high treason and war crimes."
