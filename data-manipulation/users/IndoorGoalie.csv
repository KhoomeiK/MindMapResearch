I took the car to my regular mechanic and he checked it out and said it was fine other than needing a new oil pan because they fucked up the threads.

boston,fes2817,t1_ferzmja,1579360639.0,"As someone who casually browses the sun, it’s annoying to see the same 15 focus in pictures and videos; think about it, the majority of images are the skyline from the seaport with the chain, the skyline from some high spot 30 miles away, the ground/skyline from a plane and the Charles river bridge. Downvotes or not, it gets old."
FIFA,ferhf8o,t3_eqe1gj,1579353895.0,"It was FIFA 13 that I started and looking back all I remember was that coins were scarce, TOTW had meaning, rewards were non-existent, and there were only two game modes.

Everyone used the same Premier League team with Aguero up top or a Brazilian team with 99 pace forwards no one heard of, David Luiz and the two fast Bundesliga CBs and subbing in Hulk at the 69th minute. 

The style of play was 352 Counter attacking with over the top through balls to the point where my kickoff was literally LB+A once to my partner then again to my midfielder and waiting a two count before kicking it to Vincent Kompany who would immediately full power LB+Y to the forward. The forward would 50% of the time one touch it into the net for a first minute goal. THIS HAPPENED 50% OF MY
KICKOFFS!

I won division 1 a bajillion times and every tournament at least once except for the Chinese New Year.

I played against Messi or Ronaldo hardly ever and remember the TOTY was literally the Real Madrid/Barca all stars with Neuer in goal.

I spent $10 a week in FIFA Points and the best players I ever packed were Kompany, a TOTW player from Serie A I couldn’t even use (the only TOTW I pulled btw) and Bale, who was my super sub."

boston,femj0lh,t1_felbju5,1579258056.0,"People don’t want shitty dark news all the time and I sometimes question if we pay too much attention to national political news issues. Sometimes it feels like the 24 hour news cycle causes us to knee jerk to things that have no bearing on society after a weeks time. For a quick example, does anyone remember when the world was going to en me when that refinery was blown up a few months ago? It was everything wrong with the world for 72 hours then just gone."
