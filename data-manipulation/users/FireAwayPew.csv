Christian,fdidxlw,t3_eljpz2,1578440715.0,"Why there is so much division? There is no acceptable answer, and any reason is a sad testament to the faith. But a lot of divisions comes from lack of understanding concerning Christians all being one body, and/or certain individuals feel above others, and/or certain individuals teach information that benefits them. We shouldn’t ever be divided since our truth and faith is meant to all be the same.  
How will you discern a church home? That is something your spirit will lead you to. So kind of trial and error. It’s ideally a place that understands they are not perfect, and they don’t use that as an excuse not to try to be better. That has a love for God and His people. That teaches the whole Word, and its’ truth without adding or taking away (requires you to spend time studying the word for yourself).  

As far as your work schedule, keep that in prayer that it might work out so you can be there every Sunday. But yes, I would recommend finding an online service to stream or watch some preaching/sermons online when you can on Sunday. That way, you stay in a routine of feeding your souls. But again, studying, praying, reading...these are things we all (no matter position) are supposed to do daily to continue to mature.   

Hope this helps, glad you’ve made your way back home, be blessed!!"
