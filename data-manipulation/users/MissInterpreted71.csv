bipolar2,ff6mour,t3_erulku,1579630474.0,"I understand, my daughter was diagnosed at 16 and we left it up to her as to who to tell when she was ready. I was diagnosed 2.5 years ago and I'm completely open about it. As in I post on social media. I knew I couldn't be the only one who felt so alone and didn't want anyone else to feel that way if I could prevent it. Plus, I wanted to give it a ""face"". Mental illness isn't something that only occurs to people you don't know. It's your neighbor, the person you attend church with. A spouse, sibling, parent...."
bipolar2,fdscugg,t3_emu3bd,1578699712.0,"Mine is short and simple. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Pace yourself and conserve your energy. Go slow when you need to, run when you can. In the end, you'll get where you need to be. Positive thoughts your way."
Marriage,fdoyc8z,t1_fdoy9ae,1578615677.0,It can be and happy belated birthday to you!
Marriage,fdosco8,t1_fdnawt6,1578611796.0,Yay!! My husband and I were the exact same ages as you 2 when we started dating and when we married. A boy and girl. 24 & 20. I'll be 49 in February and yes we're still together.
AskWomenOver30,fdoor7k,t3_emavhf,1578609518.0,"Hello! Married my high school boyfriend. We've been together since I was 17, nearly 32 years. There is no ""secret"". Hard work, stubbornness, keeping to your promises, respect, and communication. Did I mention stubbornness? In refusing to give up. But in my opinion, the most important thing is that you have a foundation of friendship. That will keep you together when everything else goes to hell."
bipolar2,fdibvzf,t1_fdgzw7d,1578439435.0,"I'm sorry. I had the same experience on Vraylar as well.  I've tried a bunch of meds,  the most recent that didn't work for various reasons were Latuda, Celexa, Lamictal, wellbutrin, abilify, zyprexa, lexapro... more I don't remember.  Through trial and error we found mood stabilizers didn't work for me. So I weaned off of everything and we started over with changing my anti depressant. My depressive symptoms are way more severe and long lasting than my mania. I could be depressed for months, swing into mania for a week or 2, then back into depression. Switching to Cymbalta did the trick for me, I'm currently at 90mg. Best med I've ever been on. I have Xanax for when my mania kicks up here and there because anxiety usually comes with it. I've lost about 35 of the 70 extra pounds the other meds packed on me too. I will say that it did make me very sleepy at first, but that went away after a couple weeks so I'm glad I stuck with it. Good luck to you...I hope you find what works!"
bipolar2,fdg7hmn,t1_fdg7epz,1578383218.0,"No, after researching I refused that as being an option."
bipolar2,fdg11is,t1_fdfmci7,1578376131.0,She's not full of shit! I was diagnosed 2 and a half years ago. Have been on meds and in therapy. I'm doing really well. My happy is now very happy....like the smallest things can make my day and I feel so much more grateful and appreciative of my life! For years I was sad and mood swings all over the place. I got suicidal. That's when I was finally correctly diagnosed and treated. I didn't know what it was like to feel this good. Best of luck to you!
depression,fddlljw,t1_fddc9je,1578316915.0,"Yes, exactly! I'm so glad you're doing better!"
depression,fdd8kg5,t3_eknnr3,1578299748.0,"Hi there. I'm here to say that's not true. I have major depression. I was diagnosed with childhood depression at 8yrs old. I'm 48 now. I'm living a life right now I didn't think was possible. I'm happy. My moods are stable. I'm a different person than I was 2 years ago. There is HOPE. Things CAN change. Will I still struggle sometimes, sure. Will I have depression all of my life? Yes. Do I feel doomed to a life of misery because of that? No. The difference was that after years, and some incorrect diagnosis, I finally found the right combination of meds, dr's, and therapists. A caring Psychiatric team that worked with me over and over again to find what meds worked. They really listened to me and didn't just throw pills. I had input. We worked together. I found a therapist that specialized in different therapies and we found a combination that helped me get on the path to recovery. It's a marathon, not a sprint. You have to do the work. It's some of the hardest stuff I've ever had to do....but I'm healing. I've come to a point in my life that I really like myself. Please don't give up! I'm sure mine has a genetic component as well. My mother was hospitalized in her late 30's for severe depression. But that doesn't mean I have to accept that. Positive thoughts, prayers, and healing energy your way.  (Btw, my diagnosis are: depression, anxiety, Bipolar 2, ADHD, and PTSD.)"
depression,fdd2xnu,t3_ekmksg,1578292631.0,That's the main way I practice self care!
