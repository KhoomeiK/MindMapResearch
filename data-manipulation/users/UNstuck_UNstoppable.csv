PS4,fei2b9u,t1_fei1kfv,1579128727.0,"Maybe its me but in the trailer it looks like there is neon on some of the lights but maybe thats due to the time of day as you mentioned.

I hope there is plenty of neon to give it a cool blade runner / vice city kind of look"

DecidingToBeBetter,fdtgzwu,t3_emb51x,1578716624.0,"Hating people for having something you don't have or knowing something you don't know will only serve to keep you  from getting what they have. It's much better to see the fact they have it (confidence, intimacy etc) as proof positive that you can have those things too. Let their confidence encourage and challenge you. 

Don't beat yourself down for your social anxiety and self esteem issues (lots of other people suffer from these issues too) instead set a plan in motion to better yourself. You don't have to stay the same. Read books/watch videos on building self esteem and overcoming fear. There are numerous resources out there to help - once you make the decision that you deserve better (and you do). 

Lastly, change won't happen over night so be patient with yourself and surround yourself with people who love you.  If you can, get this book by author Susan Jeffers **Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway. It has great reviews online.**

Good luck - You've got this.

DecidingToBeBetter,fdah26q,t3_ek9d9h,1578246048.0,"First off, congratulations on making the decision to go after what you want, that takes courage. Admitting that you need to change is the first step towards the transformation you desire. Like others have said, start with exercise that you actually enjoy because that will help you be consistent. It doesn't have to be anything BIG either - walking is a great exercise and will do wonders for your mood. Additionally, if possible find a way to make it a group activity. Find a local exercise group/club around you and join them - it will help keep you accountable. 

Consider creating a WHY 'board' and revisit it daily - write down WHY this weight loss goal is important to you and place this board somewhere visible in your home. Lastly consider keeping a gratitude journal and write in it every night before bed - you will be amazed how much it helps you keep a positive outlook.

You deserve to win at life just like everybody else."
