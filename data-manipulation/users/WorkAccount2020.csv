Most guys aren't going to care about the way you dress if you're well kept and hygienic. I'm a straight white dude who has dated mostly non-conventional women. Punky styles, more masculine styles, casual styles, etc. I love the short hair look with dude clothes and muscle girls. 

From what I can gather, you're either shooting too high in your quest for men and have to lower your standards, or you aren't putting yourself out there enough.

Tinder kinda sucks dick, but something like OKCupid, Bumble, Hinge, or Coffee Meets Bagel would better fit you. Going out to bars, or events might not work the best solo, as guys typically don't want to risk making the first move anymore (understandable, it fucking sucks) but in a group could be beneficial.

>In 1974, Huey Newton and eight other Panthers were arrested and charged with assault on police officers. Newton went into exile in Cuba to avoid prosecution for the murder of Kathleen Smith, an eighteen-year-old prostitute. Newton was also indicted for pistol-whipping his tailor, Preston Callins. Although Newton confided to friends that Kathleen Smith was his ""first nonpolitical murder"", he was ultimately acquitted, after one witness's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had been smoking marijuana on the night of the murder, and another prostitute witness recanted her testimony.

Crime mostly. More homeless people around that area than most areas. Lots of break ins. When I lived there a few years ago shootings were pretty normal on a weekly basis. Trap house down the street always had garbage and broken cars in the front. My first day living in West End someone got murdered at the Kroger. Stabbings over a Kroger happened pretty regularly. Old mentally unstable men would hangout at the park down the road.

No gyms, no entertainment places, no bars aside from some sketch holes, bad infrastructure, etc.
