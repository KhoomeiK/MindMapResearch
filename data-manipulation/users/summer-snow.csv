CPTSD,ffgb8pz,t1_fffzizp,1579902425.0,I'm not usually one that is too easily triggered (thankfully) but reading one specific phrase they kept repeating over and over during the reporting really got to me and brought up some memories I wish had stayed in the background.

I feel this so hard. I'm back in school to try to escape, and even with a degree I'll take a pay cut to do so, but it's so worth it for my sanity. I just have to make it that far...."

AskReddit,ff486bv,t3_ergjyj,1579557641.0,"Lady came in wanting an exception return. I don't remember all the details, but I do remember I did what she wanted despite it being an exception. She then proceeded to yell at me about the hassle of it all and what bullshit the whole process was; from her rant, you'd have thought I'd thrown the item at her face and told her to go fuck herself.

I'm pretty good at de escalation but since I'd already done what she wanted, I had no idea what to do to calm her down, especially since she'd barely let me get a word in. It continued until the customer in line behind her chewed her out, and everyone behind him jumped in supporting me. She quickly left after that."

AskReddit,fe3fwzs,t1_fe37bdg,1578848912.0,"I love this advice and try to follow it, but it's not a hard and fast rule. If you live in a shitty apartment because that's what you can afford, if you get a raise then there's nothing wrong with next time finding somewhere that isn't roach-infested and paying a little more in rent. Yes, live under your means and don't *automatically* increase your spending if your income goes up. But it's still okay to try to improve your life.

This might be common sense, but I grew up fairly poor. And while I make enough to be secure now, I still have a hard time with finding the balance. I buy coffee probably too often, but I almost never buy clothes because I already have plenty... Even though ""plenty"" just means a couple pairs of jeans, and some old t-shirts from before I lost 50lb. Those clothes aren't falling apart though, so it's hard for me to justify to myself new outfits I ""don't need."""
