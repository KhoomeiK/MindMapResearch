This self-righteousness is not only deserving of derision, but just plain *wrong*."
Fallout,fg7y4bc,t1_fg7x8b6,1580604458.0,"Again, subjective. You are allowed to have an opinion. You are allowed to not like things. Don't act like your opinions are objective fact and that people who have different opinions are BGS apologists."
Fallout,fg60wpx,t1_fg600rh,1580547858.0,"Video games are already an abnormal storytelling tool (considering the full history of storytelling). Terminals are a very canonically comfortable method of expressing exposition, especially in a place with little to no population.

""I don't like it!"" is not the same as ""It's objectively bad."""

Which I would guess means T helper cell, so failure to adequately ""instruct"" B cells on production of IgG?????? I really should go get tested and update my understanding of my own physiology."

science,fg5gff5,t1_fg5ffif,1580526781.0,"Debate over whether viruses conform sensibly to common interpretations of ""life"" aside, the virus is very carefully and deliberately inactivated so as to retain its markers but unable to reproduce. That way your body can ""study"" the virus, ""reverse engineer"" it, and build appropriate defenses.

EDIT3: I SHOULD LEARN NOT TO OVERWRITE MY COMMENTS WHEN EDITING."
science,fg5ca1d,t1_fg4wysx,1580523698.0,"Out of curiosity, are the universal vaccines with the most promise live or inactive? I have a (lifelong) IgG deficiency (*probably* CVID). I try to stay as up-to-date on my immunology news as I can, but it's a tough subject to google and journals are outside my comprehension."
science,fg5b452,t1_fg53ihx,1580522860.0,"Viruses are, basically, mechanical. They do not actually require sustenance. They can't starve. The only way to stop them is to neutralize them or physically destroy them. Now, in theory they can still degrade physically, since all matter can subatomically decay, but in practice this can take so absurdly long that it's hardly worth mentioning."

No less corruption either, only now instead of workers getting paid adequately and given good benefits, executives just milk contracts for all they're worth while doing the absolute bare minimum (and often still just plain failing)."

AdviceAnimals,fg1r2t6,t3_ewco4m,1580431964.0,"What a terrible fucking plan. A serious epidemic can have massive fucking consequences for their economy, so even if you assume the government is perfectly willing to kill off a shit ton of people in a conspiracy like this, you still can't reckon the damage to their own power.

newhampshire,fg126ny,t1_fg0v6hl,1580419390.0,"Also NH is the only one actually named after England. Vermont is Francophonic, and Maine is a place in France. Massachusetts and Connecticut are corruptions of Native American names/words, and Rhode Island is a corruption of the Dutch name literally meaning ""red island"" because of the color of the coastline where the guy who named it landed."

kpop,ffbhyl8,t1_ff8si9p,1579766138.0,"I mean, opinions are opinions, and it's an opinion poll. I don't know too many people who dispute that Red Velvet have Twice beat in vocals, and vocals tend to get a lot more focus when it comes to B-Sides. I think most people who favor Twice over Red Velvet (but love both groups) will say that Twice has better stage presence, but casual listeners are less likely to be watching the live performances of these B-Sides, so you don't see as much skewing for performance bias even when that isn't the category."

funny,ff7tddi,t1_ff7q01a,1579657889.0,"Bruh. It's a joke video online. Whether real or staged, it's intended to entertain. Does the video being real or staged somehow impact whether or not it can be entertaining? No. People in here just want to feel superior about SOMETHING because they're fucking pathetic"
