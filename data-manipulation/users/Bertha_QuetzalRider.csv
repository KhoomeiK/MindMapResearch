Over something that sounds like a 90's gradeschool urban myth?

Not everybody wants or has the means to live according to your exacting standards. To expect it suggests that you're very out of touch with reality. That's not healthy, either. Would you like me to launch into a self-righteous diatribe about how you should seek professional help and belittle you when you won't do as I think you should?

I'm very curious how much you're able to budget for food. Some people might only have $50/mo for food or live in places where the foods you think they should eat aren't widely available or easily accessible. I have to say, it must be nice to have enough money to sit there and act like your shit doesn't stink.
