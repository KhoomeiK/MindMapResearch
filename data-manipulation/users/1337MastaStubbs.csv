breastcancer,ff7m6fq,t1_ff3mzzm,1579652868.0,"Mine has nothing to do with family history. I was just an odd duck that got a rare form of breast cancer for a person my age (35) It was mucous carcinoma and 8.5cmm, had to take the whole breast. It got that big in under a year. Go get checked. There is financial aid if needed."
breastcancer,ff3mv97,t1_ff3lt26,1579544441.0,Good idea. Ask your gyno for a breast exam. They will probably want to do one anyway if you bring that up. Might refer you for a mammogram and/or biopsy.
