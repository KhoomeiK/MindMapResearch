The US is likely safer than Europe or Japan simply due to have extremely low population density and reliance on cars instead of public transit.  The bus, train, subway, or even a busy sidewalk is generally how these things spread, and with the exception of NYC and San Francisco the US population mostly sit in single occupancy metal boxes on roads and highways.

Combine that with the most sq ft per capita of office space, living space, and retail space, American generally live their life with more personal space than Asians and Europeans and that also decreases spread.

Those rural backwater small towns in America might be the most safe in the event of a pandemic like the Spanish flu.

Before implementing stop and frisk Seattle first needs to get its prosecutor office and judges on the same page on convicting people for theft, car prowls, etc under a broken window theory.  If they don’t believe in enforcing the law on property crime then there is no point to stop and frisk, as you aren’t going to frisking out murderers or rapists.

Stop and frisk, if applied with common sense, can stop those really obvious criminals like homeless people (could be white, but clearly homeless) with beautiful $1,000 bikes, or people masked and dressed in black with bulging backpacks sneaking around at 3am near parked cars.

There are people hit by the three strike rule in the past where their third strike was snatching a purse and running - this was deemed unfair, which I agree, but the removal of robbery from three strike now means people with 20, 30 counts of robbery still roam the streets.

I think they should bring it back but make it more lenient and expansive.  9 strikes for theft, make it include any theft over $300, including car theft.

Just like raising taxes on the rich is more effective than individual billionaires donating their money to the US government by choice, tariff is much more effective than “buy american” or “boycott China” choices.

In reality most people who want to do the latter is an insignificant, and won’t be able to keep it up, and won’t change supply lines to make it effective or possible.  I see redditors claiming to “boycott” Chinese products but I doubt they really are buying the x5 more expensive version, every time.  

Tariffs is more “honest” in the sense people will actually change their spending habits by changing the best value equation, and entire supply lines get shifted so it’s actually possible to get toys/clothes not made in China.  In the end, we just buy what Walmart or Costco stock, and they are shifting supply lines to other counties.

Products made in China can’t just lower prices 25% when they ready have razor thin margins.  The cost will shift entirely to the American consumer, if they bought the same good. However some countries like Vietnam or India also produce similar goods that might be priced 5% higher, so Americans aren’t simply paying the 25% tariff, often they are paying 5% more for goods made from Vietnam instead.  This ends up being like a boycott of Chinese goods, just not as harsh but applied at a national scale and not just a couple idealists. 

In the end the tariffs aren’t black and white - Americans pay a bit more, but not 25% more, because our supplier just go to other counties.  China loses sales, but not 100% of sales, they simply sell to other countries for a bit less money or volume."

After you pay that much out of pocket, any further costs are covered by 100% or 95% by insurance up to a couple million dollars, so if you suddenly get into a emergency, you won’t go bankrupt since you’d only pay $6,000.

On the other hand if you didn’t have insurance, or had the cheap insurance that Walmart workers or jobless people have from Obamacare, you would be bankrupt since those only cover $100,000 in emergency.  

Although I agree living in America is higher risk overall, not from guns per say (nearly all the gun deaths are driven off the stats of a few very dangerous inner cities), but the lack of a social safety net means you need to save heavily for both the possibility of losing your job and for retirement."
AskReddit,fcvc1pw,t1_fcv9s9z,1577998950.0,"Right, with Obamacare most people “have” insurance but they tend to suck.  Walmart, and other crap jobs have crap insurance. The ones given to white collar professionals though are much, much better plans, and at least half the country is on these decent plans.

The highly deductible plans can still be “paid” by the employer, just in a round about way.  My health plan has a deductible of $5,000 that I have to pay before insurance covers anything.  However, my employer also puts $5k in my Heath savings account so basically it’s paid for either way, but I’m incentivized to not use it since it can roll forward.  (HSA is even technically is a way to shelter income tax-free) Even without employer contributions, $5k is nothing in a medical emergency - after that the highly deductible plans will cover the hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost.  

So my point is, if you have a good career prospects, don’t fear healthcare as a obstacle to moving to the US, as it won’t effect you.  America is highly unequal society and most of the problems are heavily concentrated on the poor and low income."
AskReddit,fcvadyo,t1_fcv8j2d,1577997971.0,"It’s not saying this is good politics.  I’m just pointing out that, if you don’t live in America yet, don’t come unless you have a decent career.  That’s the sweet spot in America, whereas if you just plan to be bartender, probably go to Europe where you can get free healthcare."
AskReddit,fcva4gp,t1_fcv3urg,1577997817.0,"It’s not so much they are poorly run (though that plays a role), it’s the crazy high concentration of high paying jobs.  When being middle class is $150,000 incomes, with most dual earners making $200-300k, living costs have skyrocketed, and unless you also make that much money, it wouldn’t be worth it to live there, as you will struggle with $4000 a month rents or multimillion dollar condo prices.

It’s easy to make it in America though if you have a middle class job in nearly any other city/suburb - it’s easy to buy a $200,000 house on a $70,000 income, and live comfortably."
AskReddit,fcv9eej,t1_fcv2xy0,1577997385.0,"Is that high or low?  Seems reasonable if you don’t add your fiancée, can he/she work and have their own health insurance?

Otherwise, $800 is crazy to spend on health insurance- that’s a quarter of your income!"
AskReddit,fcv89qd,t1_fcv58jj,1577996710.0,"Assuming you have a decent job you are covered by insurance. 

Don’t come to America if you don’t have a job lined up.  Life as a poor person in the US is terrible.  As a white collar professional, it might be the most lucrative and pleasant places to live.

In few other first world counties can a simple engineer own a 3000 sq ft house, drive BMW’s, pay low taxes and pay the cheapest prices for high price goods like iPhones and TVs.

Again, America has lots of problems (crime, healthcare, inequity) but if you are in the upper middle class you won’t be effected by any of them."

If you managed to convince 5 million people to be your fan, be it as a star, athlete, singer, artist or YouTuber, you will be rich.  A a single dollar of support from fans every month equals $60 million a year.....
