Of course I have had times where he was insane, but that's what puppies do! If you give them the right amount of activity they can be lazy pups, this past weekend in NY was unseasonably warm and we were at the park all weekend... He has been essentially sleeping for two days!"
dogs,fedwtrg,t1_fedwcse,1579021564.0,"I'm not a gym person, so he is my outlet for exercise, and he does a great job at it! He is by no means a mushing dog, he won't even run for more than 100 meters. So a nice 20 minute jog three times a day is great, also helps that I have a fenced in yard that we play fetch, and have play-dates in. Nothing tires a dog out like playing with another dog! Makes me debate getting a second!"
dogs,fedrjdq,t3_eomrod,1579018350.0,"I couldn't agree with you more!! My ex and I got a husky, I've had huskies before, I knew full well what getting a husky puppy was going to entail... He did not! Three years later, my husky and I are doing just fine on our own. Random people in the street love to give their input... ""Oh my! They're such a high energy breed! That's gonna take a lot of work!"" Yes ma'am, that's why we were just jogging, until you interrupted us, but thanks! Don't even get me started about the woman who told me he needed a sweater as he was digging his way into a snow bank!"

Much sweeter than most celebrities I've run into living in NYC."
