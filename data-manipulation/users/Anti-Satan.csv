AskReddit,ffq7oi6,t1_ffq2po3,1580124811.0,"I know of four different ways. Three of which I was personally involved with.

When you explain it away or excuse your own behavior. I got a taste of this from my local asshole. I've spoken to him about it now that we're both grown and reasonable and he honestly doesn't see it as him having been a bully. He saw it as having a temper issue and other excusable things and just refuses to see his behavior as an overall picture instead of very frequent lapses in judgement.

When you go too far. My friends and I have a history of roasting each other. In an old workplace I had an ongoing battle with a colleague. My sister and I also like to do a bit of verbal jousting. For a time, I was a little too used to that kind of rapport. I didn't pull it out of nowhere, but if someone got the ball rolling, I ran away with it and scored way more hits that the others. I've since fixed that after it being pointed out to me.

When the power dynamic is off. I've experienced this, but my friend had a much clearer experience with this. There was this little shit in his school that he didn't like. So when that kid started getting angsty, he shut him down. Unfortunately he was a pretty big deal socially in his school, so just having him disapprove of you had an impact. Though the kid wasn't some sweetheart, any chance of making friends was becoming really slim with the anti-recommendation he was getting.

When you're too different. I have social friends and I have antisocial friends. There are certain jokes I can make around the prior that I can not make around the latter. I can tell my hyper-metabolic friend that he's looking fat and it's funny. Even if skinny, I can not do that to some of my antisocial friends. In that way, it can be pretty easy to just not understand that something that can be really innocuous to one group can be extremely hurtful to another."
MaliciousCompliance,ffq6mw4,t1_ffq5ekn,1580123325.0,Pretty sure the guy is from the US where everything is negotiable and 'just because' is considered reason for termination.

seduction,ffq4epa,t1_ffpuzxv,1580119856.0,"> You are correct in all manner. However, I stand by my original statement in that it is not my content.

That's where my point about you being able to contact him comes into play. I was in a MoA group a long time ago and I remember it was pretty easy to DM Sami. So it's easy to get any issues like that solved.

> I would rather the viewer watch the original content vice some summary that may be lacking details.

It's not about getting the information from the text. It's giving a short summary in the text so you can decide whether you want to watch it or not. The YT algorithm means that you need to have a clickbaity title and try not to give too much info before the video to pull people in. That becomes counteractive on here however where most have watched every method recommended a thousand times in a thousand different ways. So when I open up the video and it's 20 minutes long, the first thing I do is check the comments to see what the main points of the video are. Maybe it's something innovative, maybe it's something perspective shifting, but I'm not going to sink 20 min to find out. There are simply too many videos for me to do that on the off chance that there's something new there."
seduction,ffpumf9,t1_ffopqqj,1580106327.0,"But you're very obviously a part of the same company?

It sounds pretty disingenuous when you're making it sound like you stumbled upon the video, when I'm sure you already have full permission to post it, anyone thinking it belonged to you would still lead to the same company and you could very easily get any info from Sami that you might need before posting this.

seduction,ffj0lbs,t1_ffic4kd,1579987369.0,"You have a very toxic opinion about yourself.

I think you need to be an egotistical asshole for a while and try to ignore that for a bit. Just convince yourself that you are awesome in every way and be the dick that everyone thinks is full of themselves. Then, after about a year or two of that, you can stop and let yourself mellow a bit."
seduction,ffj0d2y,t3_etsln8,1579987202.0,"Well first off you're thinking of being an attractive conversationalist as being funny. That's not right. Hell, I'd say you'd be better off skipping humor altogether and going straight for subtext and undertones.

Being funny is mostly about getting your foot in the door and showing social worth. You can leverage that to get a girl, but you will also have a lot of moments where the girl has no interest in taking you home. To get what you want out of the conversation you're going to want to learn how the flow of emotions between you and the girl works and how to do that on command (do let me know if that makes me sound autistic for having to figure that out, btw). Add to that how to make conversations into trees, actually focusing on what she's talking about and making the conversation sexual. 

The tree thing is just noting things she mentions that you could get her to expand on. As a part of that, you should note what she actually seems interested in, though everyone usually likes talking about themselves as long as its something they haven't talked to death. You then make it slightly sexual with innuendo, hypotheticals, jokes, tangental topics and more. Up the sexual nature of the talk, maintain your focus on the conversation and make sure you have the emotional subtext going and you should be fine.

Being funny and being smart is good, but it's not going to get you laid automatically anymore than being handsome. It's all stuff that makes it easier, but this isn't the subreddit for how to make it easy to get girls. This is the subreddit for how to get good at getting girls."

That's kind of the greatest feeling for me. When I have pushback and little interest and can turn that around and get the girl.

If it's easy, I worry that my technique was shit and she just 'let me' win her over. I've known a couple of 'alpha' types that were just like that. They were handsome, leaders and more, but their game was shit and they were way too prideful to take any kind of leap, so they only got girls that that decided to take them despite their shitty game.

So yeah. It's extremely validating when I can get a girl easily and I will absolutely make use of that. I also recognize thst I've done a lot to make myself appealing and approachable like that. But still. It's getting a high score on easy mode. I want a high score on hard mode. That moment when your friends act like you turned water into wine by getting her home with you."

Tinder,fem8rqg,t1_fem5rbm,1579243924.0,"The thing about the parties is based on relative social status which is probably the most important thing there.

It's being high in the social hierarchy of the party. meaning that when you speak at the party, people listen. Girls don't have enough time to vet everyone and will therefore trust in the group's judgment.

It's the same reason why you'll have trouble speaking to a stranger, but if a mutual friend introduces you as a great guy it goes much more smoothly."

worldnews,fek2lj5,t1_fegfvtc,1579191278.0,"China was the most advanced nation in the world for something like 1500 years. They were a regional power because there was no such thing as a global power. That's doesn't really become a thing until colonialism in the 16th century. By that time China had fallen behind as well as turned insular. 

Before the colonial period, the only empire that was ever more than a regional power was the Mongols."

canada,fek1y5l,t1_fei7s6k,1579190876.0,"> Some supporters of the monarchy have tried to argue that the Duchies are the personal property of the Queen and Prince Charles – this simply is not the case. When Edward VIII abdicated he was allowed to keep his private property but not the Duchies owned in an official capacity.

This sounds like some kind of misunderstanding honestly. The duchies belong to the royal family just as a number of pieces of land belong to different earls, lord, dukes and such. When Edward abdicated, he was abdicating it to the next in line, similar to how you could choose to give a person property directly instead of it being given as a part of your will when you die. I doubt Edward made any attempt to keep the duchies (nothing mentioned about that on Wikipedia either) and he was made a duke shortly after anyways."

worldnews,fegbwab,t1_fedu0gs,1579086842.0,"An interesting point of view. So I'm assuming the Kurds are the Communist terrorists and the NATO ally is Turkey.

The US was allied with the Kurds and had been helping them out a lot. Even when the US exited the region, it did not name any hostility towards the Kurds as the reason. So you can label the Kurds as terrorists, but then you have to admit that the US was actively working with terrorists in the region (including arming them and such).
