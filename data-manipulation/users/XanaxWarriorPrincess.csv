AmItheAsshole,fgsa0c5,t3_f09huw,1581078022.0,"NTA, but hypocrite is the wrong word.  Self-centered, rude, and selfish asshead is more accurate."
Covetfashion,fgs9pz8,t3_f09i9c,1581077728.0,"You've got too many colors going on (tan, black, burgundy, green) and the shoes are quite formal."
AmItheAsshole,fgloayx,t1_fglnpk2,1580906220.0,"So, this was some sort of humble brag? Just stop.  You're not an exception."
AmItheAsshole,fglnocc,t3_ez8od0,1580905612.0,"YTA. You questioned women's experiences because you have had the privilege of being a man. Take a class on women's studies, or at least read books written by women and pull your head out."
AmItheAsshole,fgep19m,t3_ey1ej4,1580705297.0,NTA. It's your business and it was rude of him to ask. Sorry your friend turned out to be a jerk.
AmItheAsshole,fgeon34,t3_ey1fcd,1580704969.0,"NTA. You might have hid your feelings a bit better, but she shouldn't have badgered you either.
BTW, I don't care for that movie either."
cats,fg4db5o,t3_ewu20l,1580501329.0,"The third eyelid is irritated. Sorry, but you need to take her to the vet."
AmItheAsshole,fg390uz,t3_ewnfcz,1580474834.0,"YTA for taking the cat when you know your limitations and should have known better. He's obviously not comfortable with you, as cats don't groom when they don't feel safe, and he needs a better home ASAP.
NTA because you're accepting your limitations and giving the cat a chance at a better life by returning him to the charity."
Anxiety,fg2zsli,t3_ewlxt1,1580463510.0,"That would be very upsetting, and you're right, she'll probably get away with her lie. But, you know the truth and that will have to be enough. I'm sorry."
aww,fg2zg3z,t1_fg2xagp,1580463003.0,"I had 2 cats that seemed only to tolerate each other, but when one died, the other grieved. Even annoying companionship is companionship and cats are social animals."
AmItheAsshole,fg2wot9,t3_ewktvq,1580459186.0,"NTA. He behaved badly and he needs to be held responsible for his assholery. You both should get therapy, but he especially needs it because he sounds very closed off. There has to be more going on with him because that's not normal behavior."
aww,fg2wc2l,t3_ewkuwe,1580458729.0,"Cats are very tuned into our emotions. He's probably grieving too, so give him extra love. He's gorgeous, BTW.
I'm sorry for your loss."
cats,fg2w8xy,t3_ewkv7w,1580458617.0,"He could be overstimulated. Some cats also give ""love bites"" when they're happy. He also might want to be near you, but not touched. Just pay attention to his body language. 
An interactive play time might help redirect his energy."
AmItheAsshole,fg2vrqm,t3_ewk7f5,1580458003.0,NAH. Just let her know it makes you uncomfortable now so you don't have to dodge her and risk awkwardness.
AmItheAsshole,fg2vmbl,t3_ewkd6f,1580457817.0,"YTA. If she knows it's a family trip with people she doesn't know and still wants to go, then trust her to know her limitations. You can make sure she knows that you can't pay as much attention to her as you could if it was just the two of you, but let her decide."
AmItheAsshole,fg2v1fc,t3_ewkr49,1580457104.0,NTA. He wasn't a part of your life despite your best efforts. You don't owe him anything.
AmItheAsshole,fg2ut2l,t3_ewkszu,1580456822.0,YTA. Your prank might have lead your friend to confront a neighbor and gotten him hurt.
cats,ffzcwp7,t3_ew241u,1580372760.0,"A cranberry supplement will help with the UTI. You can get it in a capsule and open it and mix it in her food, or pet stores usually have some form of it.
The spraying is territorial, so I'm guessing she must feel insecure. Jackson Galaxy has some floral essence mixes that address spraying and/or feeling insecure. You might check out his website. My cats don't like Feliway, but have had good results from flower essences."
AmItheAsshole,ffzcl3x,t3_ew25tq,1580372317.0,"NTA. It sounds like a stressful situation and you're not obligated to go, so don't go for your own mental health."
Anxiety,fdqkbhw,t3_emm7fd,1578668741.0,"I've been needing a good cry too. I'm thinking of watching Grave of the Fireflies, the saddest movie ever, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stop, so I keep putting it off."
AmItheAsshole,fdq5ey9,t3_emimf3,1578655641.0,NTA it was a nice and thoughtful thing for you to do.
AmItheAsshole,f7rfswm,t3_dx93nl,1573980589.0,Definitely NTA. Your sister was horrid
