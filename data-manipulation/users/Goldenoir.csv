What about these then:

Australia burning to flames, half a fucking billion innocent animals perish in the fires. Then, it rains so much there are floods all over the country right after. Millions of people are homeless and sick for an undefined time. 

Iran shoots a missile at a commercial plane killing 180+ passengers by mistake, of which 80+ were their own citizens. Why? Just because they wanted to save face after they were attacked by the US. Yes, adults are supposedly running that country. 

Major protests happening all around the world because either people are sick and tired of their shit government, or because they can't afford basic stuff anymore even though they're working 3 jobs, or because super rich people are getting away with doing horrible sexual stuff to kids. 

China violating human rights and killing Uyghurs in concentration camps. Also, they just lied about how many people contracted and died from a deadly contagious disease, which is currently spreading worldwide. 

And that's just some of them at the moment, so yeah. Still think this one is the most shocking to you? Fucking pathetic"

2400€ is not too bad actually considering how life changing the surgery can be. I've heard from a few people who did it in Belgium who said it was around 2000€ per eye, so this is a surprise and good news! 

Why Rotterdam specifically? Were you not satisfied with the clinics you found in Belgium?

Would you say the dryness you experienced for a year was just a short inconvenience or was it a big thing every mornings? I imagine eye droplets helped with that?
