But you gotta stay strong. I don’t know if you’ll ever win your ex back but if there’s a chance of that happening, it will be with you being a mystery to her and staying out of her life. Right now she doesn’t want to be with you, and you texting her will only let her know that she can still have you whenever she wants and that’s not going to make her attracted to you. You gotta stay strong and not break NC. Don’t reward her with your attention.

That’s exactly how it is, you gotta learn how to be alone again. I’m in the same situation. And the best thing for our future relationships is to still have our own independent lives even if we’re with someone else. Otherwise the relationship becomes unhealthy.

Work on yourself, do the things you enjoy doing. No one knows what will happen. Maybe one day you will talk again but if you haven’t worked on yourself, you’ll have no chance at all because she’ll see that you haven’t changed.

The best thing for you to do is moving on. If she comes back, then because you have moved on, you will no longer be needing her and that will make her more attracted to you. And if she doesn’t come back, well you obviously would have no other choice but to move on. It’s the best for you to do whether you get back with her or not."

While the prequels definitely add a lot to the OT and to the SW universe in general, the OT’s story still remains untouched by the prequels. 

That isn’t the case for the sequels. Because they undid everything that happened in the OT only to repeat them. We have empire vs rebels again and the trilogy ends just like how episode 6 ended. So you can literally skip the OT now. Han is a deadbeat dad and went back to smuggling. Luke failed as a Jedi Master and died at the age of 53, without any kids either. He led to his nephew’s fall to the dark side. Leia failed as a senator and then general. Han and Leia’s only son committed atrocities and then dies.

FlashTV,fejpm9v,t1_fejl2bv,1579182585.0,"Well I absolutely loved S1 and I really liked S2 even though less than S1.

I really disliked S3, it was full of fillers, Savitar barely appeared throughout the season and the writing just dropped a lot compared to S1. I absolutely loved the scene where Barry figures out who Savitar is though. That was gold. But Savitar’s backstory really didn’t make sense.

So after being really disappointed by S3, I did like the Thinker during the first half of S4. But I was just in general not interested in the show that much. Iris was honestly annoying me. I didn’t buy at all that she could be the leader of Team Flash when she’s the least qualified person out of everyone. And it also really annoyed me how Barry would keep losing to villains when he could easily defeat them or catch them. They kept making him stupid in order to push the plot forward and that’s just not good writing. And most of the drama was really forced and stupid. The same happened in Arrow as well. I still watch some clips on youtube, especially when Reverse Flash appears. I watched Flashtime and the 100th episode. 

Barry failing was a lot more acceptable in S1 when he was still unexperienced. But now he should be much stronger than that and he still makes the same mistakes."

It was also super short, rushed and cliché. We barely saw the Revolution happen throughout the main story too. We could have had some amazing missions. Storming the Bastille just like  how they showed in the E3 Cinematic trailer? Nope. What about saving Elise or anyone else Arno cares about from an execution by the guillotine, which is like an iconic thing about AC? Nope. Even though that’s what they showed in the Master Assassin Cinematic trailer. 

They could have had these amazing missions with a lot if tension but they just wasted it.

They could have really developed Arno and Elise’s relationship more and talk about conflicting views between Assassins and Templars, just like we saw between Connor and Haytham, but it barely seemed like they cared about their own beliefs. He was an assassin, she was a Templar, but that was never an issue between them. So I think that was a waste.

Bellec’s betrayal was a pretty good twist IMO, but it was spoiled in the story trailer...

arrow,fegcd1r,t3_eoz9sz,1579087447.0,"That’s the most disappointing part. It should have been a lot tighter and personal. But instead they were just going from one plot thread to another. It was very messy and disjointed. There was no clear narrative or progression. And then the threats were basically punching an army of harmless ghosts. 

By comparison, in Endgame, when Cap, Thor and Tony fought against Thanos, they all had so many reasons to be there to fight Thanos. It was personal. It had meaning. It was definitely another issue that that Thanos was 2014 Thanos who didn’t know any of them but there was still something there.

We could have had more villains from the arrowverse appear to make things more personal. The biggest disappointment is definitely the Reverse Flash not appearing. Not having our Barry vanish in crisis is one of the biggest blue-balls moment on the CW. Maybe that will happen eventually but I don’t know how they’ll generate the hype for it after this.

I think they spent so much time on useless cameos and plotlines. Having an unknown character like Ryan there felt so unnecessary. Diggle could have replaced him. Lex had also so much screentime but then at the end he just helped the heroes wtf? I just wish the story was more focused.

Oliver just had a final laser beam fight against the anti-monitor, with no final fight scene, and then he just dies. I just wish he physically did more things before dying.

I think there were some nice things in the crossover. Kara, Barry and Sara had some great scenes with Oliver and with each other. So I like that we have those personal scenes at least.
