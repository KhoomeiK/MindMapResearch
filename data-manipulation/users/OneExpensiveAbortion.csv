CZFirearms,ff6b1v6,t3_eorth5,1579623274.0,Fuck. Yes.
CZFirearms,ff6aef1,t3_eql57h,1579622857.0,"I carry a Shadowline Compact, which is basically just an upgraded P-01. Very few guns come close to what a P-01 offers in terms of size, accuracy, reliability, concealability, and capacity. 

But, really, the same can be said of the standard compact and PCR models."
CZFirearms,ff69x9a,t1_ff3bmes,1579622549.0,But they weigh the same and have the same controls. I'm not really sure what the difference is outside of looks?
offmychest,fd4ck1z,t3_ejs1jw,1578166388.0,"Congratulations! Time to start saving for the next $10,000!"
offmychest,fcufvex,t1_fctbdpx,1577979969.0,"Spoken like an ignorant fuck. Go look up civil asset forfeiture, or how many people who smoked a plant were jailed. We're not even talking about dealers here, dumb ass. 

Less than half of all murders and rapes in most US states are solved, so that ""100%"" of those arrested is far and away from the actual number of violent criminals. That excludes the people who are wrongfully convicted and the people who are wrongfully acquitted.

I'm sure you'll post another retarded reply, bootlicker. Go on."
offmychest,fct4s6h,t1_fcs3dmt,1577932871.0,"You have no idea what my username is in reference to, but there you go, proving you're a jackass. 

Cops arrest a disproportionately higher amount of people who haven't hurt anyone than they do violent criminals. But you do you, bootlicker."
offmychest,fcpqxb1,t1_fcnvas6,1577870202.0,"None of what you said is preventing you from owning and training with a firearm. The only thing stopping you is YOU. You can't help that you're small, but the rest is you making excuses."
offmychest,fcoyin1,t1_fcoqzjx,1577845117.0,"Holy fuck are you stupid. Cops are hardly out there stopping violent criminals like you've asserted. More often than not they're throwing people in cages over offenses that shouldn't exist. They act as both the sword and shield to an utterly corrupt government, and assholes like you act like they're something else. 

So, yes, you're a bootlicker."
offmychest,fcntl0s,t1_fcmqbjd,1577818154.0,When seconds count the police are only minutes away. If you think they'll protect you when it counts most you're wrong. Make fewer excuses and take responsibility for yourself.
offmychest,fcnsoqv,t1_fcmt308,1577817675.0,"You're a fucking boot licker. Congratulations, now go serve the government, Statist."
offmychest,fclrje6,t1_fckxx0c,1577754728.0,That's fucked up. You don't need family like that in your life!
offmychest,fclrg16,t1_fcl2vjo,1577754663.0,"I don't, and neither does anyone else. If people were responsible for themselves and their own safety cops would be useless.

Edit:
Well, they're already worse than useless now, so that seems an improvement..."
offmychest,fclrbv0,t1_fclq468,1577754584.0,"Fucking truth right here. How many men ""just doing their jobs"" or ""serving their countries"" have wantonly killed in the name of tyrants? 

All in a day's work, I guess."
offmychest,fclr7bi,t1_fclkvhd,1577754496.0,You could have searched some of his points (and found that they were actually accurate) in the time you spent tying these replies. That's something I just don't understand.
offmychest,fclqwuf,t1_fckaivy,1577754293.0,This post says it ALL. Every single one of these points are sadly true.
offmychest,fclqsda,t3_ehn9d0,1577754205.0,"One of the most likely professions to hire sociopaths is law enforcement. Honestly, I'm not surprised at all."
offmychest,fbwch3z,t3_eeohqk,1577146289.0,"First, congratulations on sticking to it. Finishing a book isn't easy -- I'd know. 

Second, and more importantly, I'm glad you're still here. I don't know you at all, but it's obvious there are people that love you and I know it makes them happy that you're doing so well. Let this time be a reminder that, no matter what comes your way later on, you're still important."
