dogs,feku647,t3_epm2ld,1579207670.0,"Some things to try out and think about. 

- Make your presence known verbally prior to walking in. Don't wait until she sees you to engage with her. Call her as you are coming into the house in a nice calming way.

- Instead of standing over her like a lot of people do, crouch down (slowly) with either a treat or palms up when you interact with her.

- Try to be more aware of how you are moving around her. If you move quickly or are a little loud in the house, she might be unsure of what's going on. If you move slower in the house or quieter, her nervousness may go down.

- Can I ask why she's allowed on the couch to interact with you, but she's not allowed to go into your ""den"" and interact with you. It may send confusing signals to her about you.  Maybe she doesn't feel 100% she is a part of your pack and she's not sure until you engage with her.

- How are the other interactions of the roommates for the dog? Are things different with how she is responds to the roommates? Are there different ways or rules in which they play/engage her? For a working dog like a collie, they need consistency in their lives (from my experience). 

- Give her a positive reaction whenever you're with her. It might not just be enough for treats or a simple scratch. Maybe bring her a puzzle to do when you walk in, to get her mentally stimulated. She may relax quicker when she has something to do the moment she sees you. It will distract her from the nervousness of seeing you. Make sure it's around something she loves."
dogs,fekr3lo,t3_epnw8t,1579205864.0,"My neighbor was watching their son-in-laws husky puppy (4 months). My girl (4 years old) saw the dog on her territory, but she wasn't handling it liked she usually does with stranger dogs. She was whining.

Took her outside, she ran right to the husky that was in their backyard and was being sweet and playful.

That night, those two went full 100% play mode and they alternated pinning and chasing each other. I could tell the husky puppy didn't play this hard, but she was enjoying it while it lasted. 

Days after that, the husky would be outside howl for my girl, and they would repeat the play process all over. 

There is nothing better than seeing two dogs who love playing with one another wrestling, chasing, and just have time of their lives."

As someone that doesn't see themselves as a person having kids in the future with someone, having a dog is the next best thing. As someone who went through life not having a stable home until 6 years old thanks to being adopting, and still being the ""black sheep"" of the family, having something, anything, that has so much loyalty to me, that wants to be around me, it's a very heartwarming feeling that I think some people take for granted. Unfortunately, I've only had those moments around dogs only. I have had cats that were loving to me, and I appreciated it, but it was not close to that I had with dogs.

But to have a dog (fan of the medium and large dogs) to follow you around, and something you wrestle with and play with without fear of being bit, they are just a better option for me personally. 

I connect to dogs better than anything else."
