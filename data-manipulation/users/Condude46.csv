I just wish people stopped talking about how ""woke"" it supposedly is and how you need a 200 IQ to watch it because thats a bunch of BS lol. All the sci-fi terms in it are just plain lazy (maybe ironically? Idk) and they have 0 standards for how the show's universe operates. It's like Rick can do literally anything imaginable since he's some sort of god (teleport, time travel, indestructible suits, etc) but if it doesn't work into the plot we're all supposed to pretend like he can't? Woke my ass. 

Again, it still has some funny lines and characters, considering it's mainly a comedy based show, and the humor is honestly enough reason to watch it imo, but I do understand why people hate on it so much because it isn't what all die-hard fans make it out to be. 

PS sorry about the irrelevant rant I'm tweaking :| lmao"
southpark,fg095po,t1_fg06j7l,1580402896.0,"That's my dream. I truly miss his old character he was one my favorites for sure, but I did appreciate him as Trump and thought it was a great angle to parralel the two, considering how much they have in common. I'm definitely ready to have the original back tho it's been too long.

I feel like some people dislike Garrison as Trump but seriously could you imagine if they actually had Trump as a legit character? I feel like it would impossible to portray him in any normal way because you can't take the man seriously (at least I can't :/), making it difficult to involve him in any serious situations that might be necessary. At least Mr. Garrison can act himself and have some element of seriousness so the plots with him can progress, while still bashing Trump in the process."

Not even Trey and Matt have enough ideas to handle that and the show would probably get stale pretty quick. The breaks are necessary, but honestly it'd be really nice to have it year-round so I could always watch something that discusses the important issues from a comedic standpoint and laugh at the fucked up world were living in."
MDMA,fg04qvb,t1_fg00aiw,1580400180.0,"The way they act is what makes it hilarious, just so nonchalant as if they really DGAF. I feel like most people normally view pilots as being more professional (considering the seriousness of their job) so seeing them pop Molly and fuckin around is surpising"
southpark,fg036q0,t1_fg008s0,1580399203.0,"That episode was a masterpiece. The craziest part was how all the issues and controversy associated with China escalated even more after that episode. They basically aired it while the Hong Kong riots were just starting to get out of hand, and before everyone was talking about them nonstop. 

Eventually the entire Western world was shitting on China 24/7 for months and everyone praised SP for their idealism and it became a symbol for protesting the Chinese gov control of the media essentially. SP hadn't been that prevalent in the main-stream media for a long time (from what I remember). Then they made this episode about a current event BEFORE it even reached peak publicity. It's honestly mind-blowing to me that a TV show was able to accomplish this."
southpark,ffzvesa,t1_ffzp1fk,1580393917.0,"It's honestly crazy what they can do since they create every episode from scratch each week. I mean, if anything important happened in the world during the middle of a season, they could have an episode about air the next week. It can lead to some god-tier satire that's for sure.

Thankfully, Matt and Trey are only 50 so they should have many years ahead of them and apparently, from what I've read, they don't plan to quit anytime soon either. They practically keep Comedy Central afloat, which means as long as they want to make more SP, they always can."
