And then I was like, that's it? I found the spoilers pretty underwhelming so I don't think you should feel like you're missing out on too much."
thebachelor,ffcubwy,t1_ff8odcm,1579807421.0,"I'm finding it mind-numbingly stupid and boring. So I read the spoilers the other day hoping that would make it more exciting but, nope. Even those are boring."
cats,ff3n7uy,t1_ff3k32e,1579544660.0,"No, thank you for jumping in! It's so important to hear stories like these. It puts my mind at ease to learn from your experiences and have a plan in place that I know (hope) will work if ever in an emergency situation."
cats,ff3iuib,t1_ff3h1xa,1579541972.0,"Wow, thank you for sharing your story. I have a fire extinguisher by my bed along with a fire hood and the cat carriers all together in one spot. I've not done a practice run but I will do that very soon."
cats,ff3dys1,t1_ff36cfk,1579539161.0,"I'm so sorry for your loss. This is something that literally keeps me awake at night sometimes, how I would get my 4 cats out in a fire. You mentioned you got your cats out safely, how did that go? How did you manage it? I'm always trying to come up with a plan in my head but I'm just not sure what the best course of action would be."
drugstoreMUA,few5963,t1_fes00cc,1579405588.0,"Thats what I do! I put everything that needs to be matched together  in the top of the cart then go to self checkout and have the attendent change all the prices at once. Also, January is the best time of year for clearance makeup at Target."

AskVet,fed85jz,t1_fecocnx,1579003252.0,"Noone has mentioned this and in all my research I didnt see it, thank you very much! I'll mention it to mt vet, I have another appt tomorrow."
AskVet,fec75ax,t1_fec5474,1578967802.0,"Yes, they saw the vet and she thinks although it isn't calicivirus that it's something else viral. They have antibiotics and pain meds if needed so it's just a waiting game now. The good news is my one cat who was really drooling a lot has been racing around the house playing tonight, no drool in sight. He's doing great! He's eating some with lots of encouragment, they all are now, just not what they usually do. And they're not dehydrated so that puts my mind at ease. I'm just hoping the kick whatever this is soon. Thanks for asking!"

AskVet,fea855b,t1_fea6z1q,1578945485.0,All indoor only.
AskVet,fe9madx,t1_fe9jtdu,1578939382.0,"No, none. The only thing different were those styrofoam bowls. The vet I saw doesnt think that's it since my cat had a slight fever too. I'll see if the other two have fevers when they're seen by my mobile vet today."
AskVet,fe9jr2h,t1_fe9j244,1578938348.0,"No chewed cords and no, they didn't do a blood panel or urinalysis. That's something I do want to get when I see a different vet though.

The host knows what's up! I wasn't sure if those were just a holiday thing so I'm hording many many bags. As of today my TJs still had them on the checkout aisle shelves."
AskOldPeople,fcywfnm,t1_fcy104f,1578088571.0,Iceland is amazing.  At the end of my trip I didn't want to leave - I could have started all over and lived out the rest of my days in Reykjavik :) And swimming in the Blue Lagoon was an incredible experience I'll never forget.
christmas,fcu3vi0,t1_fctjsdm,1577971854.0,"It's a British documentary called Crackers About Christmas. On Netflix it was called Christmas Cracker but sadly they dont have it anymore. The guy's name is Andy Park, Mr. Christmas. Google him and you'll find his website and quite a few articles about him. If I find that doc anywhere Ill let you know!"
christmas,fcssg8x,t3_eikosh,1577923957.0,I watched a documentary about a guy who celebrates Christmas 365 days a year. Keeps the tree and an insane amount of decorations up and cooks Christmas dinner every night. I'm considering becoming that guy one day.
