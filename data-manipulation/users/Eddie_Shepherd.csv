It would be so nice to be able to leave a job and still have a little something to tide you over till you find a new one.

So I will not tell you exactly what I think you should do.  But I can tell you that I refuse to ever be in a relationship where someone is willing to yell in order to get their point across.  Also, re-reading this reply, I feel that it is quite clear what it is you want to do, and you feel you need some outside push to get you going in that direction.  Like the first person who responded to you said, you should definitely go with your intuition/gut/heart.

It's clear that you are intelligent, introspective and 35 is still young.  Whichever path you take your future will be bright.

He made the country so afraid of terrorism and then offered himself as the only solution. Well Trump has made the country so afraid of a second term all we need to do is offer a awesome second option and the Democrats have a bunch of really good ones. Bernie Sanders is number one Elizabeth Warren number two Andrew Yang is amazing. We've got so many great Democrats right now who have a lot of really progressive ideas that resonate with a ton of Americans. But they're being voiced for the very first time in a way that average Americans get it. just keep passing along that positive attitude yourself and you'll see it grow around you.

aww,ffrxmbv,t3_euvh9p,1580168206.0,And all of my troubles have become completely insignificant.  I need to go out and run in my yard!
internetparents,ffrxgbz,t3_euuyb7,1580168091.0,"I am a bit of a nerd, so when I was dating I would do periodic assessments weekly.  I would ask myself, if we had just started dating a week ago, would I want to date them for another week?  When I would be in the relationship for a while, I would move the question out to a month, ""If this past month had been the first month that we had been dating, would I want to commit for another month?""

To me, this did a few very important things.  It removes the ""[sunk cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sunkcost.asp)"" of the time already spent in the relationship.  Too many times I had heard friends getting treated poorly tell me how happy their significant other was some amount of time ago.  

It also shortens the commitment you are making to the person.  I was always very open with my partners that I was thinking in this way, and encouraged them to do the same.

If you are able to be open with the other person, it allows them the opportunity to introspect and determine if the changes necessary for your happiness are in line with who they are or who they are willing to be.

Couple questions to consider:

How old are you - the younger you are the more likely that this will NOT be your last relationship.  In fact, a massive majority of all relationships on the face of the planet are NOT last relationships.  This is important to remember, because going back to being alone is fucking scary.  But if you just KNOW

How many relationships have you been in prior to this relationship - similar to the age thing, but slightly adjusted.  The fewer relationships you've been in the more likely you should be to move on.  It is so easy for people who have been in too few relationships to get stuck in really poor thinking patterns such as, ""what if this is the best I can do?""  ""what if this is just a rough patch?""  ""what if it is my fault?""

How open to communication is your current partner - if not open to hearing about the issues that you have with the relationship... it is time to move on.  If open, try committing to each other for a week and re-assess next week."

By bringing this all the way through the proper channels, and using the Constitution to provide a final check on Trump's corruption, everyone who votes not guilty will be considered just as guilty.

If you take anything away from our discussion, I want you to try and see around YOUR perceived lack of value for these items.  I don't really value them either, so this is not really ""my"" fight.

I used to buy keys each month as a way of supporting Psyonix.  Most of the items I would give away to players who were positive to play with.

1) Use every pick and resource to maximize the time you have with your current franchise QB.

2) Snap up a player who you think could be the next franchise quarterback.

You have to assess the skills, contract value, ego and intention of your current QB.  You have to assess the NFL readiness of the potential draft pick.

That is a fine opinion to have and one that I share.  However our opinions of value are concerned, if you paid for something with the expectation of being able to use that item (digital or physical) for a period of time.

My thought doesn't even consider those who invested speculatively.  But if a consumer gives you $20 even if it is for a ""worthless"" digital item, that consumer has a reasonable expectation to be able to utilize that item for a reasonable amount of time.

What Psyonix did was this: they took the MOST EXPENSIVE game item from the secondary market and let anybody buy it for a mere $20.  Then, the next day, they told a portion of those players that they would be taking that item as well as the entire game itself away from them in the near future.

Again, the massive problem that I have is that people were intentionally kept in the dark about Psyonix upcoming decision to cancel support for mac/linux until AFTER they cashed in as much as possible from the most popular game item.

Knowing that they were going to cancel support in the coming months, isn't it reasonable to assume that a MASSIVE MAJORITY of people would not have purchased those items?"

I always think about each player in terms of the value on the field compare to the cost both of their contract and their draft position (at least until their first extension then you can ignore their draft, and technically as soon as the pick is submitted it is a sunk cost in econ 101 anyway).  To me, Blake was good value for 2 million dollars.  

If we could get him back for 3-4 million a year and upgrade our defensive ends I would be happy.  If we can substantially upgrade Blake with a draft pick I would be happy.  Impact ILB are EXPENSIVE free-agents however.  So I won't hold my breath hoping for one."

GreenBayPackers,ff3nfyy,t1_ff3j692,1579544800.0,Same.  I feel the major issue is that Kenny Clark has no real help on the D-line which leads to Martinez having to shed blockers too often or make tackles in the open field.  I just hope we can upgrade Lowry or Lancaster this offseason.
GreenBayPackers,ff3mpc8,t1_ff3mcx8,1579544340.0,Agreed. Lock up Bulaga.  Upgrade the DL (Lancaster and Lowry needed to be better to help the ILB).  Draft a speedy WR and get EQSB back.  Work Jace into the starting lineup.  Then SUPERBOWL!!!
GreenBayPackers,ff3m7yo,t1_ff3lr5g,1579544040.0,Yeah.  Can't have superstars at every position.  Mind you I think the Pack should 100% re-sign Bulaga.  I just think that rookie OL sometimes pan out.
GreenBayPackers,ff3m209,t1_ff222yl,1579543935.0,Don't stop thinking about them refs and how they are the only reason your team sucks.
GreenBayPackers,ff3lqw5,t1_ff27paz,1579543743.0,Investing in the O-Line is like investing in every other piece of the offence at the same time.  QB has more time to throw.  WR have more time to get open.  TEs don't have to chip as much.  RBs have larger running lanes.
GreenBayPackers,ff3lli1,t1_ff31d0a,1579543653.0,Bhaktiari was serviceable as a Rook.
GreenBayPackers,ff3keyo,t1_ff3k3qr,1579542930.0,Statistics show that there is a pretty steep diminishing return on the happiness gain with an increase in wealth.  And I of course am not saying that Rodgers doesn't have the right to make his money.  But it seems to me that he eventually needs to start thinking about whether an extra few million or an extra superstar player that can get him another superbowl is worth more to him.
GreenBayPackers,ff3jtfj,t1_ff3j5y4,1579542567.0,It's the cost of having a single player take up such a massive percentage of your cap.  Rodgers cap hit balloons to 36 million next year.  That over 17% of our total cap spent on a single player.  His first extension was one of the most brilliant moves Ted Thompson ever made.  Kept his cap low enough to keep all of the key pieces in GB to win a Super Bowl.
GreenBayPackers,ff3gdf3,t1_ff3798b,1579540484.0,"I'm having a hard time with this too.  Really pisses me off that anyone drafted that ass-hat.

But Damn Mahomes is fun to watch."
GreenBayPackers,ff3fh7j,t1_ff3dcho,1579539988.0,"I think of it this way:  Rodgers used to be the greatest QB in football.  Therefore he earned every penny of the contract that he is currently playing under.  The real question is how much does he value money versus how much he values winning?

If gute comes up to me as a Franchise QB with a current net value of $120 million dollars (set for life even if I don't make another penny) and asks me to restructure, the first question I would ask is ""WHY?  What are your plans for the additional space we might create?""

Then I take that information and discuss it with those closest to me, like my famous racecar girlfriend.  ""When you look back at your racing career, do you wish you had made more money or won more?"""
GreenBayPackers,ff30e7y,t1_ff2zesi,1579530292.0,"Just a feeling I got watching him.  

I can't imagine how hard a decision retirement must be.  He has to know his skills are on the decline, and there are always young guys getting better.  Knowing you aren't going to make much cash, and knowing you won't be much of a feature player where ever you land, can you still get motivated to grind every day?"
GreenBayPackers,ff2zze3,t1_ff2fv2o,1579529951.0,I just hope Rodgers is smart enough to restructure his contract and make room for more talent as his skill has clearly diminished.
