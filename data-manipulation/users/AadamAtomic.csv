Subtract for Central Park Then estimate the average number of windows on one floor per street block, perhaps 25 (times 2), and average windows per floor per avenue block, perhaps 75 (times 2).

Using round numbers for simplicity,  that's 200 windows per block floor. Let’s say the overall average is 10 stories. That makes 2,000 windows per square block.
Of course, a square block has a smaller but still significant number of windows facing inward, so add, say, 500 to the total.

Multiplying 2,500 windows by 1,850 blocks gives you 4.6 million windows. Feel free to make different estimates.

$2/per window would net you $9,200,000. You would be severely undercutting yourself.

From the day of Satan’s creation, God prepared musical instruments around him (Ezek. 28:13b). This indicates that he was a ruler, a king. 
 Furthermore, in John 12:31 the Lord says that Satan is the ruler of the world. Then in Luke 4:5-6 Satan himself indicated that he has authority over the world. Ephesians 2:2 calls Satan the ruler of the authority of the air. 
 
Ezekiel 28:14 goes on to tell us that Satan was the cherub covering the ark. 
(Cherub= a winged angelic being described in biblical tradition as attending on Gods behalf. It is represented in ancient Middle Eastern art as a lion or bull with eagles' wings and a human face, and regarded in traditional Christian angelology as an angel of the second highest order of the ninefold celestial hierarchy.)"
