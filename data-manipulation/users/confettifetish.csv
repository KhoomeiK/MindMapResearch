bestoflegaladvice,fgtuo7b,t1_fgttu09,1581109653.0,"Oh, I'm absolutely not defending OP for beating his son. I think he needs help from CPS to learn appropriate disciplinary methods. On the other hand, the mother employs zero discipline. Both are bad for the son in the long run."

bestoflegaladvice,fgtmi1k,t1_fgsy9db,1581106458.0,"OP states the kid is already in therapy and is on medication. I agree about the discipline, the son is only being disciplined 50% of the time and it's not going to work. Doesn't sound like the mother will easily change."

StudentNurse,fgrrtxm,t1_fgrdhc8,1581055362.0,"Reminds me of our very first A&P lectures. Our lecturer liked to ask trick questions where homeostasis was the answer, so homeostasis has become our default answer to tricky questions."
