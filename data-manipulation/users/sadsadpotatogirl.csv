socialanxiety,fe66mpd,t3_ek68ky,1578882965.0,Tbh I feel you. I was able to eat before but now...I can't imagine eating in front of anybody for some reason. I get very anxious and try to avoid at all costs but I don't want to miss out on opportunities that require eating with someone.
socialanxiety,fe6672a,t3_enna0n,1578882687.0,Holy poop yes! I think it'd because I imagine myself in that situation and well you know...anxiety.
socialanxiety,fe663k3,t3_envs22,1578882625.0,Work parties suck. Just play it as calm on Tuesday. If they ask why you left just tell them you got a text and that you needed to take care of an emergency. Maybe they really didn't mean anything by the juice box and people are dense and just mindlessly laugh and anything that's supposed to be a fucking joke.

depression,fd0coqu,t3_ejsheq,1578116949.0,"Okay first of all, you don't need to die. Second, you need to stick around for when you do have the power to make your own decisions and live your own life. Maybe there will be some way you can wiggle out of that major into what you really want. See a college counselor. Just do what you can and as soon as you are able to, get out of that situation. Also, showing them that you are capable of doing things on your own may help. 


I know it seems frustrating and like things will never change BUT it can. Life isn't about being content and where you want to be 100% of the time. There will always be inconveniences.

I hope that everything falls in place for you. I wish you strength and most of all, do not die."
