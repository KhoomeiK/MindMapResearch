AskReddit,fferi1i,t3_esy81b,1579861944.0,"I accidentally guessed the combination from a locker. My friends and I were at the mall and the boys forgot what combination they used. They decided to go to the security to ask for help. By the time they arrived, the locker was opened. I had no idea what numbers they put in, I just typed in a random four digit number."
