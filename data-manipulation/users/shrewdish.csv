loseit,fdac25g,t3_ekcjwc,1578244386.0,"I eat a mostly vegan diet. I was vegan for three years and didn't lose weight. What helps me a kjt a vegan diet is focusing on a low of servings of raw veggies rather than calorie dense foods like cheese and pasta. Eating a ton of high fiber, high protein foods ( I eat a lot of tofu and yogurt) , and getting at least a protein shake a day( I drink Vega for most breakfasts). 

If you can incorporate those into your diet, focusing on lean protein rather than fatty, you are getting most of the benefits I've experienced from a vegan diet. There's nothing magical about any one diet. It's about balance and building mastery."
loseit,fdabf5l,t3_ekdx4a,1578244107.0,"I have weight cycled my while life. Then in 2018 I had a life breakdown and couldn't eat for four months. I'm currently at 148 lbs , 5'0 and I'm fairly active. For reference, I wear the same size I did when I was sedentary and 130. I run, rock climb four times a week, swing dance at least once, sometimes twice a week.  I can't ""diet"" because it turns into not eating. So I have to change the way I eat, be mindful about my balance, weigh myself ONLY once a day, and keep a food journal. I am vegetarian, mostly vegan, so I have to be mindful about getting enough protein. I'd like to lose ten more lbs ... But I'm currently marathon training so as long as I eat a healthy amount, it will likely come off on its own. 

It's not easy at all. But remember that there's more to you than what you look like and weight. My weight doesn't tend to reflect my size or shape because I have so much muscle on me. It's about balance. Good luck!"
