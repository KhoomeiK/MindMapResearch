dogs,ffqm36k,t3_euojf5,1580138239.0,"I would definitely consider a Eurohound. These dogs were originally bred for on- and offsnow mushing (sleddog racing) and are really great runners but unless other sleddog breeds they are easy to train and make great family dogs, in my experience especially with children. They can be very high energy when being outside, but they also don't have any problems with just being a lazy couchpotatoe. For example my dogs are just laying next to my desk all the day while I'm working and 2 or 3 times during the week and especially on weekends we do bikejoring, dogscootering etc where they can release their energy. Eurohounds are medium to big dogs. My female Eurohound weights only around 18kg and has a height < 60cm while a pub of a litter we had 2 years ago has almost 70cm and ca 26kg. Another dog of this litter got even bigger and weights ca 32kg today. (some photos of my dogs and the litter we had can be found [here](https://www.instagram.com/fratzengulasch83/))

If you want to learn more about these dogs or just want to see them in action I would recommend you to visit a race (canicross, bikejoring, on- or offsnow mushing in general) where you also can get in touch with the people breeding those dogs."
dogs,ffq4kgn,t3_etvsfy,1580120115.0,"Eurohounds. Athletic, easy to train compared to purebred sleddogs and very social with other dogs and humans  which makes them great family dogs imo"
RunningWithDogs,ffnz80e,t1_fffp9hh,1580072539.0,">Combine the two, and we tie the dogs up to a sled and push them like horses.

That's just wrong. If you would have worked with any kind of sleddog you would know that unlike every other animal humans use to ride or to pull you don't have to push dogs in order to pull you. Sleddogs just want to run and a musher would have no chance at all to push 12+ dogs if the dogs just don't want to run. If there's ever a situation you would have to push a sleddog team, any responsible musher would stop immediately because in this case you can be pretty sure there's something wrong with your team, let it be a wounded paw, an infection or just an unsafe trail which the dogs somehow just ""feel"". The only time I ever ""push"" my dogs is when we have to reach the summit of a hill. Not to keep them running – they would do it anyway – but just to encourage them the same way you would encourage a human running mate."
RunningWithDogs,ffnvq3s,t1_ffmulyz,1580071451.0,Seriously?
RunningWithDogs,ffmulhx,t3_et9znl,1580059110.0,"Some already mentioned sleddogs and they are totally right that in cold conditions no human could beat those machines in matter of endurance and distance. The record for the Iditarod is somewhere around 8d and 3h for more than 1850km I think... and that's when they have to pull a fully packed sled with the their musher on it ;) Even the european sleddogs, which are basically mixes of hounds with only a little to non husky-blood pull sleds on middistance races for several days in a row where no human could keep up with them (an example would be the Norway trail where the winning team of last year needed far less than 2h for even the longest stages with up to 46km).

But it's absolutely wrong that a normal dog can't keep up with humans if it gets warmer. I think the big problem here is what most people have in mind if they think of a ""normal dog"". Probably some family dog bred from a showline.  But if you take a look at street dogs in some countries (where the dog's evolution is not controlled by humans) you will find dogs like ""Gobi"", a small terrier mix who joined a runner on a ultra marathon in the dessert Gobi in China, or ""Cactus"" who joined an ultramarathon in the dessert Sahara, ran more than 100 miles and ""accomplished the 47-mile third stage in a record 11 hours"" where human runners have up to 31 hours to complete the stage. In my opinion these dogs, were human breeders didn't select by look and Darwin's ""survival of the fittest"" kicks in for only some few generations are ""normal dogs"".

So in my opinion: As long as you don't fuck up a breed completely humans barely can compete with dogs"
RunningWithDogs,ff6knor,t1_ff6byjb,1579629238.0,"I'm not the OP obviously, but since I have 3 dogs, a Eurohound, a Husky-Mix and their offsprint which I think is 100% Eurohound in matters of his character and stamina I still answer you ;)

I mostly do short distance offsnow mushing with my team (dogscooter, bikejoring) and regularly meet with others for training and the difference between normal dogs and Eurohounds (at least those I know) is huge in my opinion. The biggest plus of this dogs is their ""desire to go"". No matter what's happening on the trail once they are running, they want to continue running. While my husky-mix gets distracted if other dogs, deers or whatever cross our path, the Eurohounds stay 100% focused on the trail and follow each command instantly. Another thing is they are very sensitive and have a ""will to please"" which makes them easy to train. For any kinds of offsnow-mushing I personally wouldn't get any other breed than a Eurohound (or maybe a Greyster) in the future.

That's my two cents ;)"
dogs,ff4cemk,t3_erdezp,1579560343.0,"As mention I would guess he has a lot of shepherd / herding dog with a part of husky, too.  
If so there's a good chance he will weight about 25kg when fully grown. My youngest dog, a eurohound with 1/4 husky  had around 15kg at this age and now has \~25kg. Normally dogs grow the most during the first months, so I doubt he will has more than 30 kg when he's grown"
RunningWithDogs,fen6j4e,t1_femy1gj,1579278062.0,And it's a real difference in the way you are moving while running normal and while doing canicross imo. There are muscles you don't even know they exist ;)
