1. As your husband realizes there is another man in the house, he slowly starts to resent that. He knows it's irrational, but he's no longer the only man getting 100% of your attention, or heck, even 25% of it. He's starved of almost 100% of your attention.
2. You are teaching a human how to be self sufficient, and with an attitude like most breeders that we happen to encounter with halfway decent kids, that breakup is going to be rough and full of heartbreak.
3. Even if you're NOT a super strong breeder, you start to realize that you are no longer the main woman in your son's life. Sucks to be in second place, man.
4. You are now second place in your son's life, and your marriage may or may not have fallen apart in those 20 years. You went from being the top woman in your husband's life to both your husband and son's lives to possibly neither.
5. Also, addressing the elephant in the room, why exactly are we comparing raising a child to a romantic relationship? What're you getting at there, hoping your son has a complex or something? Disgusting."

She played D&D her first semester of college and failed ALL of her classes, pulled it together for a semester and passed all the classes from the first semester, and then had to file a hardship withdrawal from some of her classes this past semester because she was too anxious to finish them (but not too anxious to start watching Jojo's Bizarre Adventure two weeks before finals instead of studying). 

It just annoys me that she plays D&D and watches anime while studying seems to take a backseat to it all. This girl seems to just be throwing away her future. I thought she was going to be so much smarter than that, I know she can apply herself. She went down to an 80% scholarship from a 100% scholarship to a private school because of the first semester.

I can't do stuff like that. Anything that I take is going to be entirely out of my pocket. I can't let my grades struggle like that, and hearing her wallow in her misery about how bad her classes are when all she talks about is D&D and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure makes me want to throw something."
