She always by my side whenever I get in trouble at school and has given me good advice in friendships and relationships. Its just when it comes to mental health, it's where we struggle to connect."
SuicideWatch,ffh1jjj,t1_ffh10vc,1579920623.0,"Yeah my mom taught me to never tell ANYONE my troubles. Always told me before going into my sessions that to be careful with my words and don't be fully honest. 

My mom is also the type to talk about my therapies and issues at school. 

And it's toxic enough that she thinks I don't know trauma because she ""been through worst"" (and she has gone through hell in her childhood, teenhood, and adulthood).

My mom would just dismiss my troubles and just say have faith in God. Not to be mean to anyone who's religious, but that phrase means nothing to me and it doesn't help."
SuicideWatch,ffgzijg,t3_etia6b,1579919088.0,"Same goes to school counselors. They sent me to an organization specialized in ""troubled youth"". First time was because of bullying and being suicidal, second time was just a plain old panic attack. 
I was sent to another organization dealing with domestic violence survivors (my father abused me and my mother-) 

My therapists were nice, and while some of their methods works for a time, I grew bored in our sessions. It felt like they're repeating themselves. 

And years later now, I graduated and now I'm willingly going to seek mental help because I was never diagnosed in my time of school and my mental state is getting worse (I was never ""normal"" since childhood, I had signs that I may have ADHD, but my parents don't believe in mental health).
I actually went to see professional help after having another breakdown and self harmed myself. When I went to seek help, my mind is set to get help, not suicidal mode. This woman asked if I wanted to go to the ward for a few days or take medications, which I told her I can't do medications in fear I might overdose like I did in the past. I was suppose to do a psych exam to know what the hell is wrong with my brain and why I am getting worse, she told me they couldn't unless I agree to take medications. 

Its been months since then and I don't know how to get help."
relationships,fdxlm7d,t1_fdwgylg,1578770202.0,"My friend has dated more people than me (well, mostly girls and maybe one or two guys). She work through her problems through talking or some shit idk. 

Its strange because my friend does not like my boyfriend, like at all. I guess she just thought he makes me happy (which in the beginning, sure. But not sure right now). 
Even she gets irritated with his behavior, she tries to give him advice on about sex and how to be more romantic etc. Of course, he never takes them smh."
relationships,fdwcs49,t1_fdwa74v,1578757419.0,"Well yeah, that whole thing with the girl I do feel guilty over. Though I didn't think he'll crawl back to me. That was a whole mess that I've done, and I was just wasn't at the right mind. My best friend does play a part in this though, she thinks that we're meant to be and just have to talk through our problems. My other close friend, he disagrees and told me that it won't get any better, but he still supports me in my decisions. The argument was over on the phone and he was there with me quietly listening. My friend wanted to beat my bf up with all the things he said smh. 

Overall our relationship is complicated and I have thought of breaking up with him. Though my bff keeps telling me that we both just need to talk, but I know him and how he is, and he didn't his lesson. Idk she wants us to try and rekindle our relationship, I dunno if that's going to work."
relationships,fdw4b15,t1_fdvznmx,1578754866.0,"I've been in therapy before, mostly cause my schools forced me to go (in middle school, a teacher found my suicide poems over my bullying and home life, and in highschool I had a panic attack and literally the school put me back in the same program I went in middle school). 

In my time of being in the therapy around my junior year, I went to another organization that was specifically for domestic survivors and their families. My father verbally abused both me and my mom, though he physically abused my mom more. In that I met a therapist that had a one on one with me as a group therapy didn't really got me engaged. That's where I told her about my relationships, both from my parents, my friends, and romantic. And I do still love my dad, even after everything he done to me and my mom, but I don't want him to be in my life. And I still talk to my dad, he's in another country at the moment. My therapist thinks because I still hold on to my dad, no matter how much he puts me through, I would do the same with my other relationships. But at the time, I didn't realize how many of my relationships were toxic, and how it affects me today. For example, when I was 12 I dated my first boyfriend for a couple of weeks or a month idk. He was 16, so that was a red flag, and he didn't want my parents to find out. He tried to pressure me into sex, though after a while I rejected and broke up with him. Now grown up, I felt disgusted looking back. 

Now that I'm 19, I feel like my mental health has gotten worse. This time, I actually want to see a therapist on my own will, my mom doesn't have control on me over what I say to my therapists (she was a paranoid woman, she didn't want me to be completely honest and open to anyone). 
Though in order to finally get a psych evaluation supposedly in the city I live in, I have to agree on taking medications (I hate pills and I told them that I had a history with overdosing, especially nowadays all I could think about is death). So now, idk what I have and idk if I'm gonna try again."

relationships,fdv302k,t1_fdtzuf7,1578742613.0,"Oh no, I was going to have sex with him eventually, sex to me with this relationship isn't all important. Heck, I was planning to do so out of love til he brought it up again. My bf is an awkward person, he brings up wanting to have sex at awkward times. Turn off thing is he doesn't really does any work to get me on board like making out or kissing my neck or anything. And he wants to top, something I doubt he can do. 

I feel like he only wants to lose his v-card so he won't be the only virgin in his little friend group. I try to tell him its normal for his age, but idk if he listened."
relationships,fdv1ktd,t1_fdu7vib,1578742084.0,"Honestly, after that whole thing I debated about my feelings. The argument ended badly and we haven't mentioned it since. For the past two months its just been awkward small text talks and a few calls. He's goes to college right now, so some weeks were busy for him. I have a bad habit of giving people another chance in relationships, which is something I got to break. 

He's stubborn as hell for a soft guy. Normally he's a nervous wreck who says the wrong things around people, my friends questioned how I even like him. He gets so nervous when he tries to seduce me, which I try to calm him down about it. His insecurities gets the best of him a lot, though."
relationships,fdth64e,t1_fdtf07j,1578716696.0,I just hate how he always bringing up how he's a virgin and I'm not. It gets annoying smh.
relationships,fdtfew9,t1_fdtcvct,1578715983.0,"Oof that did piss me off. He constantly gives me shit for not being friends with my exes, which as mentioned in the post where mostly toxic people. He only ever dated his friends just because. So he found it weird when I told him I don't do that. 

When we broke up, he act like normal and tries to talk to me, knowing damn well how much the breakup hurt me. I was spiralling out of control over the break up I had to block him out of my life before I did something I regret. How he got in contact with me is through my best friend and I unblocked his phone number."

depression,fdl2qol,t3_elqwy9,1578516061.0,"I try finding reasons. And I did and I thought they were all solved by therapies, having better friends, healthier romantic relationships, etc etc. 


I still feel intense loneliness, I still want to be alone. I still have that dreadful feeling and wanting to die quicker. 

At this point, I guess I have to live with it"

depression,fcv9dp8,t3_eiyu0n,1577997373.0,"If my mom dies one day, I'll be alone. 

My stepdad means well, but he'll go too. My friends won't always be around, probably either drift away or families of their own. I love my boyfriend of 2 years, but if there is one thing I learn about love is that sometimes not everything will long term whether either one of us dies, become distant, or love another person. I would like kids, but I also don't. When someone ask me what do I see myself in the future, I always imagine me getting my dream job maybe and all my ideas to succeed, but I will always be alone. 

I hate being alone, but loneliness is the only thing I know. I'd probably die alone. No one to surround me. 

I may tell myself to live on for my friend and families, but will it all be worth it in the end?"
depression,fbsworw,t1_fbsw98e,1577062213.0,"Yeah my mom would gaslight me a lot growing up, she didn't want me to be honest with any of my therapists about my home life with her. And even when I open up about my feelings, she belittles it and keeps reminding me she went through worse, I try to explain to her it isn't a competition on who has the most trauma when it comes to mental health. 


My mom wonders why I never talk to her what's going on in my head."
