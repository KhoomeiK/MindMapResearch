And yes if you when you do your taxes this year, assuming you make less than $50k, look at how much was held out of your check for the year and compare it to your refund and you will see that you are given back the money you paid in income tax. Some people that are low income and have many children actually get back more than they paid in to the government. They're being paid, not taxed.
