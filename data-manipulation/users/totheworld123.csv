Journaling,fdtu1o4,t1_fdtsvqp,1578722205.0,"I have one myself, and I find the concept of it interesting! It’s supposed to be a journal where you can write down all your “common” thoughts-random noncatogorized ones. The journal can be about anything, and mostly stores all daily thoughts but without a certain theme. Hope this helps, I find these types of journals to be amazing!"

bulletjournal,fdk1r36,t1_fdk10s3,1578493907.0,"I would put in “I am” what my actions, personality, etc are at the moment. In “I can” I would put more feasible goals, ones that I can achieve a bit more easily. In “I will” I would put goals (similarly to “I can”) that are more into the future, maybe like a bucket list. In “I’ve done”, I’ll fill it out with goals or achievements I’ve done  or I’ve been proud of-even milestones. I think this tracker can be pretty flexible and you could always tweak it to your preferences. Hope this helps!"
bulletjournal,fdjzm4l,t1_fdjzcha,1578492308.0,Thanks! I would definitely recommend making a goal tracker-it makes me much more inspired to reach them!
bulletjournal,fdfx03k,t1_fdftuf3,1578372511.0,"Like the other person said, this isn’t the way to work things out. If I really did scam these people, I would’ve worked things out a different way. Not by telling them negative things, that’s not going to fix anything. If anything, it’ll make things worse. I can tell that you aren’t the master of speech and working things out. Try being a little more considerate to others, as you also don’t have the right to talk to me this way. You don’t know what I’m going through, and I don’t know what you’re going through. All I’m say is: negativity and telling others to die isn’t the solution to everything; you don’t know me."
bulletjournal,fdfward,t1_fdftuf3,1578371942.0,Still don’t think you’re okay lol
