questions,feott6v,t1_feopqz0,1579305386.0,Don’t think drinking is an excuse. I knew better. There’s a deeper reason.
lonely,fe4sstz,t3_ens79r,1578862431.0,My life has been really hard since being 20 as well. Let me know if you ever wanna talk
lonely,fe4smbv,t3_enpklb,1578862369.0,"Sometimes, actually I’d say most of the time it’s not that you’re lacking something but maybe they aren’t willing to get close to people themselves. That’s a hard thing for most people."
lonely,fe4rk1c,t3_ens84l,1578862125.0,Why are you crying?
SuicideWatch,fe48884,t3_enqks5,1578856699.0,What’s going on? Why have you decided to do it?
SuicideWatch,fe41sw9,t1_fe4118j,1578854974.0,I have a hard time with those things too... depression really is the worst. Do you have anything you love doing or anything that always makes you happy?
SuicideWatch,fe409c1,t1_fe3zvrb,1578854574.0,Why do you want to die?
SuicideWatch,fe3zm1e,t3_enq58n,1578854369.0,Thank you. It’s hard when she texts me telling me to fuck myself and that I’m a horrible person etc. How would you suggest I begin to forgive myself? I don’t even know where to start. I’m having a hard time seeing anything beyond what I’m feeling right now.
SuicideWatch,fe3qps7,t3_enq58n,1578851965.0,Thanks for saying that... but now I feel like maybe I’m not giving an accurate picture of what happened. It’s true that he came on to me and I did try to get away but eventually I did just go with it and kiss him back and have sex back. I was trying to talk him out of it the whole time... I told him his girlfriend was gunna come in and she’s gunna break up with him and is going to hate me... but I did do it. I kissed him back. Maybe part of me wanted to... but I knew I couldn’t because it would ruin my life so I never would have... I’m so conflicted because I did eventually give it and fuck back...
SuicideWatch,fe3nfsw,t1_fe3kfaa,1578850976.0,My friends don’t see it that way because I did give in at some point. I didn’t try hard enough. I fucked him back
lgbt,cjui10o,t1_cjug2zd,1408453607.0,Yeah I emailed them right after and in still waiting on a reply.
