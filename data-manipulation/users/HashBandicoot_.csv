The blue pressing errors (seen here) were shipped in the proper sleeves, while the pink copies of Broken Wing were *also* shipped in My Shame Is True sleeves.

AskReddit,fd5sb20,t1_fd3of9t,1578180933.0,"I wasn't so much grouping them in a pharmacological category as I was grouping them in a medicinal / therapeutic / recreational category. These 4 drugs in particular came to mind as I have seen the benefits each one of them has had on those around me. I could also mention MDMA, Ibogain, and Methoxetamine as being useful drugs, but I haven't had any first party perspective of these drugs helping those I know in life changing ways. Although, there are many reports online where each of these drugs has been beneficial to someones well being and mental health.

I enjoy the 'classic' psychedelics, and a few of Shulgins creations. Ketamine isn't my recreational drug of choice either, and I would prefer I have someone with me if I were to use it again. We all process each drug a little differently, and I agree people should be open to new ideas! I think there is an entire untapped world of potential lying in the realms of psychedelics."
AskReddit,fd3hztg,t1_fd3cojx,1578158464.0,"As you are still quite young, I'm glad you have the common sense to refrain from taking LSD (and hopefully other drugs, including weed) until you are physically and mentally mature enough to handle them if you do decide to later in life. While the substances themselves are relatively safe, your own chemistry and development should not be interfered with so soon. This is only my opinion, but I think it is quite a valid one.

Your health, safety, and quite frankly your life in general is ***FAR*** *more important* than a ""night of fun"" or a psychedelic trip. Always be safe, and take care of you. You're the only you that you've got after all."
AskReddit,fd3art2,t1_fd2aza3,1578156445.0,"I do agree that the portrayal of drugs, especially psychedelics, in our media and laws can be harmful to the future of medicine. However, like anything, even the ""good"" drugs (LSD, psilocybin, DMT) can be abused. Having safety measures put in place when using any mind altering substance, *and I can't stress this enough*, is **extremely important**. Uncomfortable experiences do happen. Drugs can be dangerous if you don't use them respectfully, safely, and in a good environment. Having your drugs tested, having a sitter, knowing what to do in case of an emergency, and just harm-reduction in general should be top priority for anyone using drugs. Always start with test doses (these are doses below recommended quantity, to test for adverse reactions). Then slowly increase your dosages. You can always take more, but you can't remove what you've already put into yourself. Knowledge is power, safety is king. Always be safe. And if you have any doubts or are unsure, then do not use."
AskReddit,fd38kr5,t1_fd1cbzj,1578155748.0,"DISCLAIMER: I am not a doctor. The following is one persons story. Everyone is different. Do your research. **BE SAFE**.

I had a really good friend who heavily used tobacco/alcohol/pot and was a hard drug user (cocaine, methamphetamine, smoked heroin). He had a peculiar outlook on psychedelics. He believed they ""would make you insane"", he'd have flashbacks, acid would store itself in his spinal fluid, you name it.

After a lot of research and study with him I'd finally gotten him to try a low dose of psilocybin mushrooms. He loved them. We began experimenting with increasing dosage, as well as other substances. I trip-sit him while he tried LSD, which he claimed let him see his body from the inside out. He wasn't happy with what he saw, and had quite an uncomfortable experience. Then the magic happened.

He wanted to quit using the harder drugs, but wasn't sure how he would be able to after nearly 15 years of use. I suggested to him that we try ketamine. Now, I am far from a doctor, and I *do* ***NOT*** *suggest* anyone take advice from a rando on the internet, but after a few turbulent trials with K, he began to develop the strength to curb his drug use. First he quit using meth. This was followed quite quickly with his abstinence from heroin as well. He continued to use cocaine, but with time that tapered off to no use also.

He was so proud of his self-improvement and to this day still occasionally thanks me for helping him turn his life around. I'm always sure to tell him it wasn't me that did that for him, that it was himself who put in the effort and hard work to make a change. We joke about how drugs got him both to his lowest point, and his best life, but in reality I think just a turned on state of consciousness, a different viewpoint, seeing himself from an outside perspective really helped him in the long run. Ketamine can be useful. He doesn't use K anymore, has a nice job, a family, and I'm so proud of him. This ""demonized illegal drug"" does have benefits when used safely, and I hope in the near future, studies can be done to help other people kick their addictions and get better."
AskReddit,fd0aojn,t3_ejogd0,1578116126.0,"Speaking about therapeutic, medicinal, or recreational use of psychedelics / drugs in general. Due to the unfortunate stigma drugs have, substances such as LSD, Psilocybin, Ketamine, DMT, etc are also 'looked down upon' by a large part of society. To be used safely, I think set, setting, knowledge, dose and purity (and a few other factors as well) are an absolute necessity and these drugs can be vastly more beneficial than harmful."

Often enough, food/trash gets squeezed out of the gap between the compactor and the housing unit. Birds, squirrels, mice, and even raccoons have been spotted scavenging around it. When we have fruit to dispose of, *especially* strawberries and sweet peppers, I bring these items out the back door and place them on a raised curb near our stacks of chep palettes (around 20-30 meters away from the trash). I have noticed -what I assume to be- the same group of crows constantly returning to that spot for the food I leave them. A few times the crows have been waiting, perched in a nearby tree or on the buildings rooftop, anticipating the drop of their food. As I walk away, they fly down and collect what I have left them. They don't seem to be scared of me, but I haven't been able to get very close to them either way. I've noticed small stones, pieces of quarts or road salt, left on the curb. On a few occasions, I have seen tiny threaded nuts around this area as well; likely gifts from the birds. I consider myself the snow-white-of-retail, and my co-workers think I'm a bit nutty. But the birds are happy, so I am happy too."
