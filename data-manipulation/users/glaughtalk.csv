worldnews,fdhy2gp,t1_fdgr7qx,1578432244.0,"I must admit that I overestimated Donald Trump's commitment to peace. His 2016 presidential campaign featured an ambiguous mix of pro-military and anti-war statements. When Donald Trump talked about ""taking the oil"" during the campaign, I thought he was just highlighting the fact that the Iraq war was a failure and that the USA gained nothing from the war. I honestly believed it was an ironic statement meant to highlight the absurdity and futility of war. I expected Donald Trump to be more of a dove than he has proven to be."
