murdermittens,ffcl369,t1_ffckxtp,1579801748.0,Yeah horse kick is a little much for them. I did get stuck on a horse once because of it though.  It got caught on the horn when I dismounted and the zipper apparently is strong enough to dangle my fat ass off the side of a horse.  Zipper 10/10.  Dismount 1/10.

instantkarma,ffb6pot,t1_ffb68rz,1579753267.0,"My original comment was that the parents need to protect the cat until the kid is old enough to understand. I am fully aware that talking to kids does not always get through to them, especially if they’re too young to really understand what you’re saying. So until they are old enough to get it, the parent should not be allowing them to behave this way and should remove them or the pet from the situation."

AmItheAsshole,ff7twfo,t1_ff7tcpx,1579658258.0,"It is not unreasonable for an allergic person to expect to have to be diligent for their entire lives.  Yes, it will be nice when the environment can be controlled to a degree but that’s not realistic all the time.  

Restaurants, ball games, other public spaces - should these all be nut and shellfish free?  Is that reasonable? Or is it more practical for the allergic folks to take appropriate precautions?  

Bear in mind you are in the minority, that doesn’t make it fair but it’s a fact."
AmItheAsshole,ff7sxbk,t1_ff7lut6,1579657580.0,"You didn’t say the break room was an option, you implied they shouldn’t eat these things at work at all.  Yes, if she can eat it in the break room rather than at her desk she should be polite enough to do that for your benefit, and if she refuses then taking it to HR is reasonable.  

But I hold true to my judgement if the intent is to restrict her eating it at all."

You can politely ask them to let you know when they are planning to microwave or eat shellfish so that you have time to leave the area.  

You’re an adult - you need to learn to adapt your life around your own medical needs rather than expect everyone else to do so."

Homeschooling should not be legal.  Except in the case of a child who perhaps has cancer and needs a year or two out of the mainstream there should be no exceptions.  

It’s just an excuse for the religious wackadoos to impose creationism on their kids and shelter them from any opposing world views.  It’s disgusting."

OldManDog,ferl752,t1_fepn48c,1579355344.0,"We do! He’s in excellent health, partly because he is still active.  He’s got fantastic muscle tone for his age, very energetic and willing.  We are mindful of his age and don’t ask as much of him as we once did but it’s actually recommended that we keep him in light work to prevent some age related ailments from progressing.  

We would retire him of course if riding was hurting him but the vets seem happy with how he is now so onward we march.  He does get some supplements and a yearly injection for mild arthritis that makes him comfortable. 

Many horses ride well into their late 20’s/early 30’s.  If you’re careful with them you can do that, but some people either ride them into the ground and ruin them, or treat them like glass - which can also ruin them."
