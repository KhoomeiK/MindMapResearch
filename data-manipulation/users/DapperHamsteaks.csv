Hex, Stormfront, etc. after effects still deal splash damage and AoE damage. They were not changed, Moze was.

The MoD nerf was not reverted, it was changed from 2 seconds to a .3s cooldown. Your epicenters heal so much because it multi-hits so each one is healing the same % of your missing health. You are sometimes getting multiple grenades back because MoD can proc multiple times simultaneously. It will go on cooldown after.

Vampyr is a terribly designed skill. Moze with almost a whole tree effecting grenades was already extremely limited in the handful of grenades that worked well with her. Those changes cut that list in half. With grenades being your source of sustain, you are limited to certain guns as well.

Amara gets better gun stats than Moze and can really use any gun well because her damage buffs aren't really conditional. Amara is a better ""Gunner"" than Moze."

You are using IB on cooldown to pop anointments, it's a shame you aren't using Auto-Bear for anything more than Target Softeners. Un-augmented Rocket Pods or Corrosive Sabot Rounds can do some serious damage in 15 seconds.

TCP is good with the Flakker, but I'd really suggest moving those points into Stainless Steel Bear. SSB also directly increases the damage of Short Fuse.

I'd also shift 1 point into Grizzled. 1 second off IB cooldown every kill is absolutely worth 1 point, and it's more value than that same 1 point in Explosive Punctuation.
