I see someone for POTS but she's addressing my presyncope, mostly. No improvement yet on the other stuff. 

My PCP mentioned that brain fog can worsen with depression. I do think I'm reaching the end of my rope with being homebound and sick. She upped my antidepressant dose and is looking into a neuropsych specialist for me."

POTS is stressful enough; why waste time with anybody who isn't willing to be supportive?"
AskDocs,ffptgek,t3_euj4cm,1580105075.0,"There could be countless factors. Do you have any other symptoms? Don't rule anything out yet. Do you eat well when you're stressed? Low blood sugar could cause confusion and anxiety, which further worsens your stress and becomes an endless cycle. 

Maybe you could start keeping an event and response diary. Write about what you do, things that happen, your feelings regarding said events, and what you eat. This will help narrow down the causes for your confusion."

Does your employer know about me/cfs? Maybe they'll understand if you need accomodations that could help you prevent flares. When you put yourself out there and ask for reasonable help here and there, you'll keep yourself healthy enough to be productive and reliable.

The brain fog has always been my worst symptom. I know that physical pain will pass, but the brain fog really tears me up. I'm scared and confused about life in general. I don't really know what's going on or how to process things. Sometimes, i forget how to speak English or my other native languages. 

I legit can't understand anything, and I cry daily because of how scary it is to live like this. How do you ask for help when you aren't even sure what you don't understand? I imagine this is how early dementia patients feel."

I don't believe that many people are lazy and just get handed things, though. I think that everybody has their own struggles and pain in their lives. A lot of people can't see our invisible struggle with dysautonomia and they'd assume we're lazy.

I also have widely fluctuating mental abilities. Before, I spoke 3 languages fluently. These days, i honestly can't understand English half the time. 

Last week, I had to go to an appointment and I had to interact with a ton of people. Every single time someone opened their mouth to say something to me, I immediately blurted out my birth date; no matter what they said to me.

cfs,ff53pj9,t3_erdkkm,1579579377.0,"Check out the ADA site for suggestions on workplace accomodations. Some of those tips can help you put your best foot forward and conserve as much energy as possible. Then talk to HR and let them know that you'd like to have a discussion about your disability needs. You don't want to suffer through a crash, and your company wants you as healthy as possible so you don't have to take more sick days than the average person. It's a win-win. 

Don't think of accommodations as special treatment. Accomodations are a compromise; meant to even the playing field between you and your abled colleagues. 

Best of luck, friend. Congratulations on your new job!"
cfs,ff532x8,t3_erkbfd,1579578894.0,"Do you crash as hard/fast from mental exhaustion? If not, maybe you could talk to HR and see if they can find you a less physically exhausting role at this company. They should try their best accomodate you because of ADA. 

Of course, that's not to say that they'd cause the company undue hardship to accommodate your needs, so please try to keep your expectations realistic. 

If there are no sit-down roles readily available, just ask them to keep you in mind when one opens up. Companies are happy to open jobs up internally before they accept external applicants. 

In the meantime, maybe you could ask them if you could have a stool to work from and a hand truck to cart things around with. You can also see if they're amenable to adjusting your break times or changing your shift to a time when you're more active/ physically/mentally at your best, etc. Check out the ADA site for suggestions. You know your needs better than anybody else would. 

Best of luck, friend."
