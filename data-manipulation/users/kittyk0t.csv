TPWKY,ffd40w8,t1_ffcouvw,1579812992.0,"Same here. I lived in a small enough town before we moved 6 months ago, though we had a hospital, and I *cannot* imagine the effects that a more widespread and severe flu strain would have on the people and local hospital. With the military base in town and those nearby, with people constantly coming and going, it's just unthinkable."
TPWKY,ffd3oqp,t1_ffcl04k,1579812803.0,"It just kind of blows my mind that the bigger pharmaceutical companies wouldn't want to fund studies to create the vaccine and IMO shows how much they're looking to profit off of the flu each year. At the same time, *capitalism*. :|"
AmItheAsshole,ffcoqn3,t3_essrci,1579803980.0,YTA. That's insane. This cannot be real.
AskReddit,ffcnx5n,t1_ffbnxnu,1579803475.0,"this!! We moved from a small town six months ago to a *much* larger city with much longer commutes. The number of accidents I see every day is absolutely insane, and we've already been run into twice while at an absolute stand-still in traffic."
offmychest,ffcis2y,t1_ffcia8o,1579800353.0,"It takes time for vaccines to kick in-- it takes time for your body to develop antibodies from the vaccine. For the flu vaccine, it takes about two weeks for it to actually kick in, but for others, it can take between 7 and 21 days for them to work. If a child who has received the vaccines hasn't waited that time period, they're still at risk for contracting whatever it is."

[They also recently announced that they're planning to make major menu changes to incorporate more plant-based options.](https://www.today.com/food/panera-planning-major-menu-overhaul-next-year-t171783)"
vegan,ffcbi6l,t1_ffaye1e,1579795863.0,"if a product is still sold at trader joe's, just not yours, you can also call your local store and ask them to stock or re-stock an item. This happened a couple of years ago with the dried chili mango slices at our local one and apparently no one at the store had realized they never restocked, so I was glad to have called :)"
vegan,ffcag4l,t1_ffc78vf,1579795196.0,freeze it! It's perfect to have a few things on hand and not to have to do anything in terms of cooking other than to just reheat dinner :D
TwoXChromosomes,ffc8ls2,t3_esnpwn,1579794027.0,"Nope, that's a myth. Your hair isn't cut off at the follicle when you shave. Even if it were, when it's pulled out at the root like when you wax, it grows in finer. 

What you're really doing when you shave is just giving it a trim. Imagine if you got a regular hair cut: would your hair then grow back in thicker? No, because imagine having to haul around that much hair."
TwoXChromosomes,ffc8by9,t3_est4es,1579793853.0,"When I think of the word ""frugal,"" I imagine the extreme sort of saving money, as opposed to saving a significant amount of money while also treating yourself on occasion. I prefer the latter. You don't have to blow your bank account to go out to dinner on occasion, and it doesn't have to be all of the finest restaurants. I'm happy with a Mexican restaurant, frankly. But to each their own. 

Let's be real: there are 7.5 billion people on this planet. They aren't all going to have the same values as you do. 

The post you saw is one post and the people it attracted and who commented on it apparently have similar values to that person. That being said, it would have been important for that person who posted to have *communicated* her ""needs"" to her significant other, because if that's the kind of person she's going for, it's important that he knows they have massively different values when it comes to money.

All of *that* being said, and because it's mentioned a few times in the comments below, yeah: I want to make sure that my spouse has a job where he works hard, just like I do. I want him to be a productive member of society and of our household. I expect him to be my equal in that."

weddingplanning,ffc2dvs,t3_esqqpw,1579789817.0,"This was how ours was in terms of the reception-- except the DJ also made us dance *on stage* (we are both painfully introverted). The church ceremony was for my parents, during which the priest took the opportunity to tell a story that my brothers told him at the rehearsal dinner (one that I was actually bullied about a *lot* growing up), so I cried (tried not to) *on the altar* where he had us seated (small church) *in front of everyone* and I could hear everyone talking about it because the church was that small and everything echoed. I just about died. It also later came out that my dad had been cheating on my mom for 15+ years. So church, very spiritual. We look back fondly enough. 

Your wedding is ONE DAY of your whole entire marriage; it doesn't set the tone for your marriage. But let me tell you: my husband is a fkn saint for being the backbone and completely supporting me and us emotionally and as our personal spokesperson throughout all of that."
