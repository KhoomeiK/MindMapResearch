I decided to stop being a full-time student and start taking classes part-time, move back with my parents, and get a part time job.  Honestly, my stress has been cut almost in half and for maybe the first time in a year I feel like I'm on the right track and only now do I realize how miserable I was in school.  Dropping out doesn't have to be the end we're all destined for.  We can keep pushing forward."

Heâ€™d stop entire game sessions by having these episodes and then heâ€™d borderline force us to hang out with him afterwards and comfort him when a lot of us just wanted to go home. 

He still asks me if he can come back. I humor him by asking the rest of the group what they think (Iâ€™ll let him back if my players want him back) but it doesnâ€™t look like that will happen any time soon. The way he reacted when we asked him to leave burned a lot of bridges."
