ADHD,ffee7a7,t1_ffe4spy,1579844710.0,"Yeah, agreed but we at least put it to good use! 

As for yoga, I used to think the same way but you can do some crazy intense yoga. I have really fallen in love with it. And with the addition of meditation afterwards, that combo is really helping me center myself and maintain a routine. That being said, I haven't gotten back into my routine since Saturday and the craziness of the weekend then going straight back to work."

Maine?"
politics,ffdbafm,t1_ffcttq5,1579817175.0,"Agreed, but there also needs to be some kind of regulation as to what can be broadcast as news. Or do something with ratings bc at this point cable news isnt necessarily lighting dumpster fires but they're pretty amped up to watch them burn and televise it nationally"

Had a pretty epic/hectic weekend. Went for a hike Saturday in a frozen canyon (I'm in Alaska) to look for some ice climbing. Climbed a little bit and turned around. Came up on an old Avalanche debris pile that we had passed not 30 minutes earlier and Bam right in the middle of the trail is a dead moose. Had fallen off of the side of the canyon (we guess) and we missed it by no more than 20 minutes. I swear my first thought was incredulity that we had somehow missed it on the way up. I didn't trust my own brain/eyes, anyways we left it be, walked back out and came back to salvage as much of the meat as we could. The trek out with 300+lbs of meat took longer than expected and my roommate who was helping me pull the sled at one point asked me: ""you are incredibly focused and determined right now, is this something your ADHD is helping with?""

It caught me off guard but I started thinking about it and I guess yeah that single mindedness I was experiencing, simultaneously with extreme calorie and h2o deficiencies, let me pull that sled through the darkness and over some of the most difficult terrain. I've also loved endurance sports, backpacking, long distance running, cycling, shit even driving across the country, bc the repetitive nature of the physical aspect calms my mind and I can just keep going like Dory in Finding Nemo."

Ultralight,fec9ecb,t1_fec69s9,1578968990.0,"Pretty sure I read somewhere that the temp rating is based off using a pad with a r-value of 4.0. so unless you're using a pad with a 4.0 or higher, the temp rating is not going to reflect your experiences"
norcalhiking,feafael,t1_fe9jyrt,1578947968.0,"Wind is definitely what I'd be most worried about, not just with closures but with shit falling on you or your tent. I spent a crazy few days in big basin, probably the only idiot to be out there during that storm and I had sizable branches hitting my tent. Also a tree fell like 100 ft from me and knocked down other ones as it fell down hill. They actually closed all the campgrounds due to a wind storm a week later. The stream crossing where it goes from the people trail to the horse trail is pretty huge. I did it a few times but if you have any doubt the road back to the ranger station is still pretty. You can always do that last 1.5 miles or whatever it is in reverse if you want.

Edit: pretty huge for a creek crossing that is. If you don't mind getting your feet wet for the last 1.5 then it's pretty chill. Trying to get across dry can be a challenge, especially if it's been as wet as last year."

Stupid health insurance. I'm on Medicaid and I'm constantly worried about making too much money that I would get kicked off and not afford a therapist or meds, two of my 3 jobs are paid under the table so I don't go over. ATM my therapy is free and my meds cost 4$/month, I'd be up a creek if I needed to pay for them"

You can also email them and say you can't afford it and they'll give you a discount iirc. The customization is great. Only issue I've had is sometimes the routines get a bit stale, and every once in a while there's a glitch."
alaska,fdrfp3x,t1_fdplnqu,1578683884.0,"I'd say Valdez is worth visiting purely bc it's the most beautiful place in Alaska IMO. but yeah the xc ski trails are pretty dope, limited, but dope. There are groomed trails all around mineral creek, out on the shoup Bay trail for a bit and in from town. I don't know what you're used to, it's not like miles and miles but the access from town is great. Also shitty snow machiners fuck them up occasionally but whatever.

Edit: I actually keep finding more trails."
