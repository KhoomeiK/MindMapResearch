To answer your (very pertinent) question: kind of. My mood at the end of the day definitely “weighed” more than my mood in the morning. However, you may have noticed that some days are split, in an effort to represent a mood shift. 
Well, what is interesting (at least to me) is that the period of time in which I tended to do that was also when I was struggling the most mentally. On the other hand, when I was overall happier, I would give the day a good “grade” even if it had started out as a not-so-good day, just because it ended on a good note."

theXeffect,fd0m7pi,t1_fd0l8pe,1578120774.0,"Thanks! “The Secret History” is really well written and compelling, albeit a bit disturbing - falls squarely into the dark academia genre. If you’re looking for a shorter read and don’t mind being reduced to a pool of tears by the end, I can’t recommend “Flowers for Algernon” enough."

bulletjournal,fd0i0in,t3_ejsy6a,1578119093.0,"This really helped me put 2019 into perspective. At the very beginning of the year, I went through a rough break-up, which was long coming but still painful. Just as I was getting used to being single again and living on my own, I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had to have my thyroid removed + radioactive iodine treatment. Then,  in August, my best friend of 7 years and I had a big falling out and we no longer speak atm.

It’s been a tough year, ngl, but it really is something to see, on paper, that my good days greatly outnumber my bad ones. A fantastic visual reminder that life is beautiful - even when it’s not.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk lol and happy new year (and decade!) to each and everyone of you!"
