AskReddit,febvya2,t1_feazh7r,1578963390.0,"Hey friend, I'm transgender, female-to-male, and I just wanted to say that I really appreciate the level of self-awareness you show with your answer here. Even as a trans man, I've found myself dealing with certain transphobic beliefs I've absorbed from the cultural views around me. For several years, the idea of trans women made me slightly uncomfortable, though it was never something that I'd ever allow to outwardly impact how I treated somebody. I held negative views on many parts of the gender-minority community- all of those stereotypes of rabid SJWs with brightly dyed hair glued to tumblr or twitter 24/7. Of course, nobody can be broken down into such a 2D figure. I think a lot of it stemmed from a deeply held dislike for myself and my own transness. I've done a lot of growing in the past several years, and I've come to tackle and reverse some of these biases I've held. Nobody can be perfect in their views, and simply continuing to educate ourselves and keep an open mind is the best that we can do for ourselves and for the people around us.  


As for the actual question, it's something that I'm still divided on. I'm still figuring out my sexuality, but right now I'd consider myself maybe 20/80 bi/pan, in favor of women. I'd like to be seen as a man, obviously, and I've been on hormones and had top surgery- I appear as male to everyone publicly. But I can also recognize that most women who are attracted to men are hetero, and probably not interested in a guy with a vagina. Bisexual women may be attracted to men and women for different reasons- my bits might not align with the rest of what they find attractive in a man. So I find it difficult to justify not informing someone who I may become intimate with that I am transgender. At the same time, it's kind of devastating accepting that so few people would find me attractive. I don't really like to ever think about how I'm not cis, and the thought of coming out to somebody, even though I'm at little risk of physical harm in such a liberal area, is terrifying. This has led to me not really pursuing anyone here, even people who I have a lot of chemistry with. As lonely as I feel, it would just be too much for me to deal with right now. To me... I just feel as though a relationship entails a lot more than sex. For different people, sex is of varying importance. Functionally, through surgery in the future, or the use of a prosthetic/strap on today, a trans man can perform as a cis man can, like your point with trans women. So in that case, I feel like a lot of the arguments saying it's only a preference are a little flawed.  But I do understand them.  


I have seen some things in these comments that really strikes me the wrong way though. The implication that even if a trans person passes completely, has had all the surgeries, ect, they are still bad for not disclosing that... I don't know if I can agree with that. If it were a medical possibility for me to go entirely stealth and never tell anyone  I'm not deeply committed to (like married) that I have XX chromosomes, I would without thinking twice. Because I am a man, and it shouldn't matter that I wasn't always. I honestly wouldn't consider it to be misleading or lying. It's simply not relevant."
NoStupidQuestions,fcb1562,t1_fcawecy,1577580655.0,"I don't think so, besides maybe weed occasionally. She desperately craves attention and fakes/exaggerates illnesses for it, so I wouldn't be surprised if she saw someone on tumblr post about it and decided that she needed one. It seems like they're mostly targeted towards people with ASD or severe ADHD after doing some reading, and she has neither. She does have a diagnosis of ADD from when she was like 4, but it wasn't severe then or now.

She lies about everything (even stupidly obvious things) and she's tried to convince us that she has eating disorders, multiple personalities, or schizophrenia before (without even bothering to get the classic symptoms right), so this crippling anxiety/stimming thing is probably just the newest iteration of that."
fatlogic,fcapdzq,t1_fc8t6wm,1577573911.0,"Gender fluidity is legit (but it doesn't work like the troll implies), but yeah otherkin stuff is sort of out there. Neopronouns are sort of a weird concept to me also, admittedly.

As far as I know though, that sort of stuff is often used as a coping tool by people with ASD and whatnot in their little online bubbles. It's weird, sure, but we're far too cruel to people who are a little abnormal and otherwise harmless.

Thank you for your responce clarifying it instead of just downvoting me :)"

fatlogic,fc6f9z6,t1_fc5mayk,1577479197.0,"I had a vague understanding of what the three macros were coming out of highschool, from a single 5 minute section of one biology class in my sophomore year. My teacher was talking about cellular respiration and told us that the body prefers sugars and protein before fat, which surprised me. But I can totally get how people armed only with that can be convinced that their muscles will waste away before they lose any fat. Even my handful of health classes that touched on nutrition mostly just said it was important to eat a variety of foods. Nothing about calories (apart from the idea of empty calories), nothing about different vitamins or macros beyond just food groups and good sources of stuff like protein. But it was all no brainer stuff. Like, beans and veggies good, snackcakes and potato chips bad. We also learned about eating disorders, but only anorexia and bulimia. I was developing BED and thought I was just disgusting and glutinous. 

I didn't go to an underfunded school in the middle of nowhere, I went to a decent school in an affluent town (beyond my family's means) in Connecticut. We had a really good physical education and health program compared to national standards. And this wasn't a long time ago, I'm only in my third year of college.

Almost everything I knew up to that point was just what I absorbed from around me, like nutritional labeling, the food pyramid, and family/cultural stuff, and that sort of information is so unreliable if you don't have an educated or health concious family, or are unable to look at it through the right lens. I'm still so frustrated over how badly I wanted to lose weight in high school, how concious I became about food choices in terms of eating only healthy foods (or what my entirely obese/overweight family said was healthy), and under that magical 2000 cal a day limit on the back of the cereal box, or as close as I could (badly) approximate from cooked meals, and still never got anywhere. It made my eating disorder worse with time because I started to hate myself more and more, and also felt like I just had no control. It took me almost a year after graduating to start learning some reliable, concrete stuff about it, and that's only because I'm a biology major and I had some in-depth material for my classes that went into nutrition  in better detail.

Most people, even if they go to college after high school, don't become biology majors. They might not ever encounter a situation that makes them learn about calories and macros. There's so much bad info and food myths and complicated/false diet advice out there. Frankly, most people aren't very good at discerning what is reliable information especially when scientific topics are involved (the lack of scientific literacy taught in schools is another gripe of mine). It's really not too surprising to me that a lot of people don't know jack about eating right. 

Anyway, I'm sorry for going on so long. In short, I think we just do young people a huge disservice by leaving so much of their nutritional education to be taught at home."
fatlogic,fc6cky0,t1_fc578ul,1577477405.0,"I read something recently about grain free dog food being possibly linked with heart issues in dogs, and after looking into it a little more I found a few sources showing that there's no scientific evidence of grain free cat food actually being bad for cats. It's sort of a health craze for pets on par with the gluten free thing for humans (who are healthy without an intolerance or allergy). Even in terms of calories the two diets vary widely. We used to buy grain free for our old ginger cat, but he has heart problems and our vet told us that grain free food was just more expensive without any benefit. And the cat in question is a hog on any food. Our other cat could be allowed to free feed if we didn't have the orange terrorbeast/vaccuum cleaner. I'd say it's probably more likely that the difference in your parents' cats is just individual personalities.

This is total conjecture on my part, but I'd imagine that a ""natural"" cat diet would include some grain anyway, seeing as they typically eat prey whole, and their most common prey are granivores like mice."
