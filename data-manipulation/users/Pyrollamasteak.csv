Music,ff68d05,t1_ff4qtkp,1579621537.0,"Except the value of a dollar and it's correlation with satisfaction has diminishing returns.   
Obviously, the more money one gains, the more satisfaction. The inverse is also true.    
However, a poor person losing a dollar is more dissatisfying than a middle class person losing a dollar.   

Subsequently, there is a point in which one accrues a vast amount of wealth, which reaches infinitesimal increases in satisfaction, as well as decreased dissatisfaction from decreases of wealth.   
    
So while donations are great, the difference is like Metallica giving $100 to a homeless person, and Bezos just dumping some change from his cup holder. It means very little to him.

The mindset is, if saying ""no blacks"" in a dating profile is racist, because it excludes the possibility that even a single member of the race could ever be attractive.       
Then, saying ""to transgender people"" is transphobic because it excludes the possibility that even a single member of the transgender community could ever be attractive.   

I kinda agree with that, on the basis of excluding a whole group; BUT **I definitely don't think anyone should be obligated to do anything with anyone. Genital preference is very important.**
***   

I would like to clarify that transgenders sounds weird. Saying transgender*s* is like saying ""into tall*s*, black*s*, and Jews"".
