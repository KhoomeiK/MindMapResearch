aww,fcnk8yl,t1_fcmpzbb,1577813218.0,"Twelve weeks! (Sometimes a little longer since they really enjoy the bonding) His mother had to be put down during birth, she stopped breathing and couldn’t push any longer. For the first few weeks it’s every 2-3 hours like a human. And we had to keep this really big stuffed animal in his pen for comfort since he would look for his mother to nurse. I kept him inside so now he thinks he’s a dog lol"
