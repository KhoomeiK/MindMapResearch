That's not true at all. Plenty of other commentators have had suggestions which would insulate the daughter from her father's actions (and subsequent argument) while still living together under one roof.

The way you see it, if the father does something which is harmful to the child, your options are A) do nothing B) divorce the father or C) set yourself on fire? Do you see how unhealthy that mindset sounds?

Yeah of course if the delivery person did $5 worth of work and your order was $5 then 100% tip is completely reasonable. 

I wouldn't bust my ass for $3 and if you're honest neither would you. 

As far as your edit, what do restaurants care if their delivery guys get a bunch of small orders and low tips? There's no shortage of low-skill workers desperate for money (in metro areas anyways). Restaurants aren't going to set high minimum orders because they're OK with shafting delivery contractors. If you don't tip them enough to make a decent living then you're signaling that you're OK with shafting them too."

Also up there is what to do if your fire alarm goes off frequently by accident and you have pets - how many people does THAT apply to?

Some countries operate that way but not all. China for example considers embassies inside their territory to be part of China. They did sign the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which in part says

>Article 22 1.The premises of the mission shall be inviolable. The agents of the receiving State may not enter them, except with the consent of the head of the mission.

Also not true in China. You are not allowed to escalate a confrontation (including in self-defense). Unless a person has attempted to kill you, you're not allowed to kill them.
