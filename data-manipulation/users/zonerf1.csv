fountainpens,ff1r2o4,t1_ff1qic2,1579484313.0,Thanks for the advice! I'm currently waiting for it to set and gonna see how it holds a day from now. I've never had to do this before so if it ends up breaking again I'll use that solvent weld stuff. I figure I'm gonna buy some anyway because I'm getting into restoration.
fountainpens,ff1jck5,t1_ff1j8k6,1579480126.0,I'm using clear grip gorilla glue. It's a super glue basically. Is that a mistake? What is solvent weld?
fountainpens,ff1gw3t,t3_er4sp4,1579479030.0,Noticed the section had a weird kind of flex to it and didn't think much of it. Accidentally dropped the pen today and realized what was wrong. Half the inner circumference of the section was detached from the barrel already and so that's why it felt bendy in the hand.
