Yeah, I mean, identical twins are fairly rare, and homosexuality is moderately rare, so the situation is inherently quite rare. About 0.3% of the population is an identical twin, and Google tells me 0.8% of women identify as lesbians, and 1.4% identify as bi, so if you meet a woman on the street, there's a 0.0066% chance that she's an identical twin who wants to have sex with another woman.

I'm not sure how to calculate the probability of two of them meeting. I'm sure their sexual orientation made meeting each other more likely than random chance on the street (though by how much, it's kinda hard to say), but as far as I know, their being twins didn't. It's not like they met at a twin meetup.

Overall, quite unusual. Which is why I doubt 13 year old me would believe it.

edit: Oh, I forgot to add that 52% of identical twins who are homosexual have twins who are also homosexual, while this is only true of 22% of fraternal twins. So it's about 50/50.

Vermont has very little violent crime, but its rate of gun ownership isn't actually that high. Higher than its neighbours, but not overall. Some states over double it.

The reality is, actually looking at the data, there's basically no correlation at all between violent crime within the USA and gun ownership rates. It neither promotes, nor prevents violent crime in any meaningful amount. The trend line is surprisingly flat. (which I knew, and was why I made my comment..)

My points are pretty simple: 

1. You're trying to defend ""iSheep"" with a bunch of stuff that ""iSheep"" doesn't connote. I'm not saying it's in no way based on fact, I'm saying that the fact that it's based on (people who buy things only because they're popular) is overblown, and not a good representation of iPhone users' choices on the whole. Therefore, calling people iSheep is only barely above just saying ""Fuck you, asshole!"" in its basis in fact. Trying to pretend like that insult implies every legitimate criticism of Apple is disingenuous. iSheep only implies that people with iPhones are sheep. Sheep does not imply anything about headphone jacks, or walled gardens ecosystems. (I guess it could. Sheep would probably enjoy a walled garden. But that would torture the metaphor..)

2. Owning an iPhone is a defensible purchasing decision.

3. Being inflammatory and insulting about people's phone choice, when that decision is defensible, and when that insult has nothing to do with your rationale for why they're wrong, is childish.

I think you can have criticisms that are completely uninsulting, and insults which are entirely uncritical. Calling people ""isheep"" is essentially not a criticism at all. It's just childish and insulting. It may reflect a belief you have that you base in a more valid criticism, but it isn't itself a criticism.

> You understand just by saying that it makes you an asshole by your own definition right?

When commenting about objective matters by way of criticism, criticism and insults are orthogonal. When your criticisms are about a person's behaviour, they're inherently insulting. Being unable to conduct yourself in public in a way that isn't directly insulting people over something that barely matters is childish and assholish, to me.

Which I suppose means they're not *truly* orthogonal across the whole space, but I don't know how to define that.

SailfishOS isn't Android.

But iOS also has tighter integration cross-platform, which enhances ease of use.

>Perhaps people who are a bit more critical than yourself about certain things aren't simply children. Ever consider that?

You're conflating criticism with insult again. You can criticize Apple and iPhones all you'd like and I won't think you're childish. If you can't imagine being able to respect anyone who has an iPhone, and can't help but insult them, then you're childish.

However, that doesn't make your argument the correct argument for why that should be.

>But we (able bodied folks) could have ANY of the spots.

...But there are a lot more of us, too, though...It's a larger number of spots being fought for by a larger population. 

The reason that people shouldn't park in spots reserved the handicapped is because it's against the law, and makes you an inconsiderate jackass.

All this ""Able bodied people don't need to deal with confrontations when parking"" doesn't make any sense, and is completely unnecessary. People are inconsiderate jackasses all the time, to everyone, necessitating minor confrontations.

>And they are RESERVED. It's FOR THEM. It's also the law, by the way. 

This is strangely not actually the case in private parking lots in BC. This particular incident happened on a public street in Squamish, and both parking there and standing there is against the law without a permit according to Squamish bylaw ([*District of Squamish Traffic Bylaw, No. 2220, 2012. s. 6.1*](https://squamish.civicweb.net/document/131354)). But if you're at the grocery store (or whatever), as far as I'm aware (and I looked into it), there's no law against parking in accessible spaces. It's up to the property owner to deal with as they see fit.


>It is not the LAW that everyone gets a spot. It's the LAW that everyone gets an OPPORTUNITY for a spot. Not an opportunity to have to beg for a spot. Able bodied people get the opportunity to have a spot in 99% of the spots. 

First of all, if you're using the law to back up your argument, you need to use *the actual law* to back up your argument. You, as far as I can tell, are just making shit up. The law is that you're not allowed to park in spaces designated accessible unless you have a permit if you're on public streets. Whatever point you're trying to make about opportunity or begging doesn't really make any sense.

Second of all, [The Ministry of Transportation](http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/permits/siteimpact/manpage.asp?page=5.2.4%20Handicapped%20Spaces.htm) suggests that a minimum of 2% of parking spaces be for handicapped parking, or 1 space, whichever is more. Necessarily, as there are many parking lots with fewer than 50 spaces, law and math dictate that some amount (probably significantly) less than 98% of spots are available to the able-bodied.

That isn't really a counter-argument so much as it is a factual statement for our increased understanding."

Different person, and I don't know anything about transitioning...I do know a *little* bit about human biology, though. (Really, not a lot, but a bit.) My understanding is that the growth plates fuse as you age, regardless of testosterone, and that if you don't undergo male puberty, you've missed your shot. Bones are no-takes-backsies. Neither are brains, generally, though I have no idea what affects male vs female brain development, and if the differences have any real relation to puberty.

The human body isn't as smart as you're indicating. It doesn't *decide* to fuck itself up, it has no concept of its own existence. It's all essentially just chemical gradients. I'm sure there are some things that will simply respond to hormones whenever they're present. If a woman wants to start bodybuilding in her 50s, I'm sure supplementing her testosterone will certainly let her pack on more muscle. But there are a bunch of things going on in your body  at once. Some of them only work together at a certain point, and don't ever again. It's not like delaying puberty stops you aging.


I don't really know enough about the subject to comment on what people should do. I just want the facts on the table. I don't think that delaying puberty is as zero-risk in terms of preserving one's ability to decide about the future of their body as perhaps you (and the person whose comment you're corroborating) are painting it. If it is, I need to reconcile my understanding of the theory involved.

I mean, unintentional falls accounted for 36,338 deaths in 2017, but...what are we going to do to prevent falls? Suggest people not stand? 

Very misleadingly, studies exist showing that medical errors cause hundreds of thousands of deaths per year (misleading because the relevant stat there is more nuanced than death. QALY cost would probably be a more reasonable stat and make it seem much less severe a problem. Very ill people are easy to kill by accident.) Should we advise people not to go to the doctor?

With guns, it becomes a different discussion, because guns are completely unnecessary to life for the overwhelming majority of people (subsistence hunters being the only exception I can think of. And how many of those are there, really?). People might argue self-defense, but...that doesn't hold up under scrutiny, being that owning guns doesn't actually seem to make people any safer. (Also, if anyone starts talking about overthrowing tyrannical governments, I'm going to direct them to some mental health information..)

To be charitable to firearms, I might compare it to swimming, which sees an average of ~3500 unintentional (non boat related) drownings per year. That's a less-than-necessary activity for the overwhelming majority of people. 

Basically all other activities are significantly lower in risk than firearm accidents. All forms of sharp objects combined (cutting and puncturing), all forms of machinery combined, etc. So if you're unconcerned about your child getting into your guns, you should be *really* unconcerned about them getting into your knives, the lawnmower, power tools, etc....at least statistically.  

To beat out firearms in risk of accidental death among children, you need to essentially be talking about cars (which are the top by a huge margin) or what are entertainingly best grouped as elemental forces: Drowning (water), burning (fire), suffocation (air). Poisoning and falls (arguably earth, but that's slightly grasping) sometimes also beat firearms depending on the age bracket.

I'd also probably mention that while deaths as a method of comparison is...as valid as anything else...When considering absolute risk, you should also include injuries. Being killed is bad, being maimed still isn't great.

It should also be pointed out that *unintentional* deaths are not the only reason to secure your firearms. Even around children. Once you include homicide and suicide, those stats **skyrocket**.  (And no, someone who is suicidal *won't* always find another way to kill themselves just because they can't access a gun. It's very usually an impulsive decision made in a moment of distress. The means available matter.)

>How many accidental gun deaths to children to age 14? About 50 a year.

I assume you mean ""age 14 *and under*"", otherwise that would be *staggering*. (Also, I know the stats, and know that that's not true, haha)

In 2017, unintentional firearm deaths accounted for:

Age 0-4: 31

Age 5-9: 14

Age 10-14: 16

So 61 total for that year in particular. Most of them toddlers.

I'll also point out:

Age 15-24: 117.

Which might inform some people's choices and understanding of risks.

I'm not making a specific argument here, overall, but if we're presenting stats for consideration, I think yours don't paint a complete picture (and none do), and want to contribute to the food for thought."

1. Put the shredded potatoes into a big bowl of water as soon as possible. Directly, if you're just using a box grater. You don't want to leave them to get oxidized in open air. ~~You also want to wash off surface starch, so~~\* there needs to be enough water to go around.

2. Get them actually dry. Don't just drain the water from the bowl away with a colander. And don't rush through this step. Get people with strong hands to squeeze as hard as they can. Don't try to do it with more than fits in one hand at a time, or it won't get enough of the water off (I find). They need to be *dry* on the surface of the shreds.

3. Use a decent amount of oil. We had probably...5mm (roughly 1/4"") of oil in sheet pans we cooked them in the oven in. (We were cooking for a decent number of people) They don't need to be *completely* submerged in oil, but it can't just be a light spritz of Pam, either. And the oil should be hot before they go in.

Those beliefs are rarely something that could be argued with.  And redirecting her thoughts away from what can be an obsession with negativity might stop a downward spiral in its tracks.

From the position of a loved one, I also find it helpful to speak for myself, trying hard to not make it seem like I'm disputing anyone's feelings.

Dating a paranoid schizophrenic, can confirm. At least for some definitions of placation.

It's actually a lesson in all human interactions. The paranoia (or  delusion) is a different cause of stress, but the way you should ideally deal with stressed people is the same, regardless of their mental health situation: Make them feel heard, like you value them and what they're saying as best you can, but don't try to feed the stress, or dispute why they're stressed.

Arguing about why a person is stressed out might *seem* like a thing you should do with a mentally healthy person, because  ""Well, they're wrong, so if I just show them why, and they're rational, then they won't need to be stressed."", but...that doesn't work on sane people any more than it works on crazy people. Emotions don't work like that.

The less rational the delusion, I'd imagine the harder it is to make them feel heard, but those are the goals. In the above example, I'd probably go with something like: ""I understand you're very scared right now, but we need to go to the hospital to make sure you're okay.  I'm doing my very best to make sure you're safe. I'll send someone to deal with any problems at your house."" and then engage in conversation that is non-trivial, but not directly related to what they're concerned about. Maybe talk about what's going to happen once you get to the hospital, and what they can expect.

People are, in general, really susceptible to confidence. If you can project the idea that everything is under control, and that they're safe, that's going to defuse their stress pretty much as quickly as possible, regardless of what it's about.

But really, you can certainly make that kind of money in engineering, but it will probably take significant passion. It honestly doesn't sound like you've got the kind of passion when you're asking a question like this.

What do you actually *want* to do? What is *important* to you? Find the thing you'll actually do the shit out of. The thing that gets you excited to get at it in the morning. If it's in engineering, there's probably a path between whatever that is, and a lot of money.

If the answer is ""making enough money that my parents can be proud of me"", go switch into finance. But also, while you may not care about some rando's opinion, I think that's pretty sad."

For example, military grade electronics need to withstand -55C to 125C. Commercial products dont need to do that.

As with grading terms for most things, it matters what we're talking about.

Military grade aluminum = Any number of a dozen or more common alloys. Basically meaningless.

Military grade laptop = You could probably drag it behind a tank through the Sahara and it'll still work. A Panasonic Toughbook is not the same as a Macbook Air in terms of rugged design."

You can't go to Vancouver and Winnipeg and tell me with a straight face that Vancouver is a smaller city than Winnipeg except to be pedantic to the point of uselessness. Back in the 70s, Winnipeg merged all its little cities because they were clearly all just part of a larger whole, connected under the banner of Winnipeg. Vancouver hasn't done that, but if you literally can't distinguish a gap between the cities, what kind of point is being made about its size?

Vancouver is a small metropolis, not a small city. 

It's like saying the City of London has a population less than 10000. Technically true, if you're trying to trivia dunk someone, but absurdly misleading when having a normal conversation."

Vancouver proper may be a tiny bit smaller, but the surrounding area makes it *way* bigger, which is what's relevant. The fact that Winnipeg combined all its little cities into one big one (Unicity) and managed to be just slightly bigger than the CoV is meaningless."
worldnews,fc0232i,t1_fbzspma,1577274595.0,">Let's say it takes 3hrs to make a pair of jeans by 1 person at the manufacturing level, that's $45 (forget benefits)

Unless they're weaving the denim with a needle and thread, that's hilariously far off how long it takes to manufacture a pair of blue jeans. By a factor of >10.  The material is cut in bulk, and sewing with a commercial machine is done individually,but very quickly. Minutes, not hours.

>(including marketing, accounting, legal fees, etc...) about $100 into each jean.

Why would a business making jeans in America need to spend more on those things than a company selling jeans in America? Still need marketing, accounting, legal fees for the same laws.

>That owner wants some profit and the company needs profit on the books, let's call it $130 after that.

As opposed to American companies manufacturing in China, who dont care about profit?

>Or... you can spend $29.99 on a pair drop shipped with a note from some 9yr old in China

You wouldn't buy jeans that were drop shipped for 29.99. Drop shipping is what you get when you order a $2 item on AliExpress with free shipping. $29.99 jeans  (which are probably not made in China anymore, tbh, but Indonesia, Bangladesh or Vietnam) you're buying at a cheap clothing store are coming in in giant shipping containers that are definitely tracked.

Drop shipped jeans would be maybe $10, and basically no Americans are buying clothes like that.


""Made in America"" products certainly cost more to make than ""Made in China"" ones, but you're just bullshitting the costs. The thing you always need to know is: Things cost what people are willing to pay. American made goods carry a premium that doesn't necessarily maintain parity with the increased costs. Jeans made in Bangladesh cost units of dollars, and in America, probably low tens of dollars. The $200 price tag is because you're willing to pay it. (Or maybe if you're having a person, not a business do it. Economy of scale and whatnot)"
vancouver,fbxace8,t1_fbx0zrp,1577176811.0,">why are we living in this shithole again?

Because it's one of the nicest cities in the world to live in?

It's not that what you're saying isn't true to some extent, it's just...not important to being happy and living your life? Yeah, there are problems with crime. Problems that should be solved, and which there are forces arrayed against solving. 

But what does it mean for you? Are you likely to be violently victimized by those criminals? No. You probably shouldn't have an expensive bike. That's about it. Perhaps cold comfort to those who are victimized, and we should fix our problems, but relative to anywhere else, it's not that bad.

What else? Yeah, uh, rich people exist. Characterless? Vancouverites have a ton of character. There's a huge hiking, outdoorsy culture that doesn't exist elsewhere in Canada. What kind of character do you want?People on the train look at their phones? Welcome to the modern era. I'm probably texting my girlfriend on the train. I care more about her than making extremely small talk with strangers, or...what? Gazing wistfully out the window? Reading the newspaper? What should I be doing? 

Rent is high? Sure. Yup. That's an actual problem. But it's not impossibly high. 

The immediate response to ""Why do we live in this shithole?"" is ""If you dont like it, leave."", but...really...if you're so unhappy here, maybe seek some actual help, because you're probably depressed. I like Vancouver, but even if you don't like it for what it is, it's still not that bad. Objectively. If you're this down on it, I think that's on you and your life, not on the city."
news,fbuzbqo,t1_fbuent3,1577122828.0,"The real question isn't the sample size. Sample size is a relatively simple formula. The real question is what you're actually collecting data on.

Anecdotes are not data unless you're collecting data about anecdotes. If we care how prevalent suicide is in French companies, rather than how prevalent people believe suicide to be in French companies, there is no number of anecdotes we can collect that will tell us. There is no number of ""I know a guy..."" that will count the bodies on the ground. Maybe they all know the same guy, and he was just really memorable. Maybe they all knew different guys. Maybe it was literally anywhere in between. That's not even accounting for the fact that people lie, misremember, and are generally completely unreliable sources of facts.

As soon as you start a formulated methodology for asking the question more specifically ""Where did you see this person? When did you see them commit suicide? What was their age, gender, ethnicity?"", it's no longer an anecdote. At that point, it's become (quite poor quality, for reasons given above) data. But even if we forced everyone in France to respond in a similar manner as the top commenter has, we would learn almost nothing about the thing we care about knowing."
