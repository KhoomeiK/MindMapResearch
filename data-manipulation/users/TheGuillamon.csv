One exercise includes identifying your personal Bermuda Triangle, we all have one – it’s that enigmatic geographical area in the Atlantic Ocean – representing a triangle between the Bermuda islands, Puerto Rico and Miami. Supposedly, an area where multiple aircraft and ships have disappeared mysteriously. 

We all have a series of activities of doubtful value that make our time seem to disappear enigmatically – this triangle might comprise of checking out Instagram stories, going into a rabbit hole search mission, ending up watching a guy building a hut on YouTube…, and so on.

This is time spent doing activities that give no value at all and jeopardizes your valuable free time. Identifying your Bermuda triangle can give you a new perspective on how much time you’re consuming on content that contributes no value."

Normally events such as a flight delayed because of bad weather – yelling and shouting will not end a storm.  

If you cannot do anything about a situation, it is pointless to worry. As Marcus Aurelius said, “Nothing is worth doing pointlessly”.

If you can focus on the parts of your day within your control and the parts that are uncontrollable – you will have an advantage over other people who fail to realise they are fighting an unwinnable imaginary battle."

Stoicism,fde5c1d,t1_fde3tcj,1578331519.0,"Hi, welcome to the subreddit.

Seneca advised us to ""live as if we were poor"", even though some recommend that programs of voluntary discomfort are best left to ""advanced stoics"": undressing for winter weather, not conditioning your car in summer, practicing yoga to twist oneself into uncomfortable poses or border on being painful, rowing as an emotional discomfort - with a list of fears to overcome: fear of flipping by surviving flips, fear of being out in the lake a large distance away.

This can also be applied to public speaking, in which most are fearful of humiliation and failure, *instead of fleeing from butterflies, collecting butterflies.*

These are some examples, voluntary discomfort helps you to overcome yourself, improving day per day. 

Hope it cleared some things out."

1. Find somewhere as quiet as possible to spend some alone time - don't worry if there are noises and distractions
2. Close eyes without tightness, relax muscles
3. Concentrate on your breath - rise and fall of abdomen or sensation in your nose inhaling and exhaling
4. Thoughts appear on the inside - observe them or move back to breath
5. Noises appear on the outside - listen without judgment
6. Awareness - be present
7. Start guided meditation or unguided meditation as your own preference."

2. Correct
3. You are taking it from the wrong angle, life after death and what happens when you die is totally a human construct, just as heaven and hell is made to instill fear. I can assure you that if our species were immortal, god would have little to no value. Therefore the majority of people cling to god and pray for hope, fear and to get something in return aka heaven.

getdisciplined,fcz2rqo,t3_ejmetv,1578092494.0,"This saddens me, it seems to me that I would need to dig deeper down to understand the root of the problem. I suppose it might be a lack of self-esteem, it's incredibly difficult and I can relate. 

Just imagine yourself outside - and your the only one in the world left. Would you feel this same sensation, or liberated? If it's the latter, it's probably a problem of self-esteem, lack of confidence. There's a lot of ways you can work on this.

1. Focus on yourself, forget about people. Forget about looking at other peoples lives, instagram or happiness. Don't compare yourself to other people - live for yourself.
2. Focus spending your free time on activities that generate value & personal growth (some ideas apart from exercising: meditate, save money, learn to deal with people, read a few pages of a book, practice public speaking...)
3. Focus on producing instead of consuming (create anything that's completely your own: a paper, a video, an audio, painting...) 
4. Practice mindfulness meditation 5 minutes a day. Be aware of the present and your body.
5. Be unique to yourself, forget about pretending to be someone your not.

Hope it helps"

The benefits are great to relax your mind for a good night's sleep after a hard day at work, being able to organise your thoughts of the day and have a clear mind. It's always good to end the day on a positive note."
getdisciplined,fc9hm0s,t1_fc8jt0g,1577552796.0,"That's good to hear, you have already started the first step of actually meditating - 5 minutes is great for starters. 

Meditation is not easy when you aren't being the present and thinking of the next exam or task ahead of you. You should be taking a few minutes to dedicate solely on focusing on meditating, it's common that thoughts pop up such as the next chapter you have to read or memorise, how you could be spending this time actually studying, etc. 

Just be aware of these internal thoughts and also the external sounds. There are two different realms:

**External Realm**

The art of meditation teaches us to listen to the general background noise of the world just as if you were listening to your favorite album, without trying to identify the sounds: coughing, the floor creaking, cars going by – whatever it might be, the essence lies in letting your ears hear whatever they want to hear, being completely non-judgmental about sounds, that is to say, there are no proper or improper sounds. 

**Internal Realm**

When we practice meditation, thoughts come and go – trying to repress thoughts will only make them stronger.  Thinking – or in other words, talking to yourself, makes you live in the imaginary world of symbols – without being aware of the real world. In psychology, this process of constant rethinking our own life’s event is known as rumination – overthinking and going into downward spiral with negative thoughts reinforcing one another. This is a common symptom of people suffering from anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or depression.

Don’t try to repress thoughts – that will only strengthen them. Listen to thoughts as part of the general noise going on in your mind. 

Once you practice this, you’ll notice how the inside world and the outside world become entwined, making it easier for you to live in the present moment."
getdisciplined,fc9gj6m,t1_fc8wlvg,1577552351.0,"It's a common occurrence, Buddhist monks also face this problem. Especially since they meditate for hours upon hours a day, that's why they came up with the unique way of sitting down in a lotus position - making it comfortable enough to sit but uncomfortable enough to not fall asleep. I'd recommend the typical cross-legged position, your spine somewhat straight (not totally erect) and your hands cupped together. 

Practice a few minutes and concentrate on your breathing, there's no need to prolong it too much and feel drowsiness therein. Also, sleep at least 7 - 8 hours a day if you do not already do so."

I highly recommend listening to **Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche** and his video Meditation and Going Beyond Mindfulness - A Secular Perspective, he will definitely explain it much better to you. It's on Youtube. Link's [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukTaodQfYRQ&t=400s)
