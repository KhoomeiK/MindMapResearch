Any documented proof is better than verbal, do not let whoever it is only do verbal communication, not sign a similar written document of your discussion, or say "" off the record conversation"".

Those who take off all the time get ignored despite using nearly a months worth of time more than allowed in a year. Those like me that request a day off for vacation 4 months in advanced get told its too far to say yes, submit closer to time just to submit 2 weeks prior to be told we are too busy and cant take off. So I use a sick day since I knew I needed off for months just to come back and get ""disciplined"" for letting down my coworkers.




Edit: for those that may be asking or curious, My managers position is already posted for replacement. Its just a matter of waiting for a replacement as it would be more problematic to get rid of him immediately as he has been with the company for 40+ years and hasnt directly done anything to qualify immediate termination. Its been a rough 2 years of piling complaints and conversation but finally the company got enough to rid of him without repercussions. I am only one of the many that have been directed by higher ups above my manager to only engage with email or written responses on everything for proof related evidence of wrong doing that had piled up. The job is an at will job so playing safe and slow is currently the best approach for everyone which is why confronting every problem is a risk rather than compiling reports. My manager has done plenty more worse that resulted in their fate such as almost hitting pedestrians with a forklift on 5 reported occasions, actively keeping the workplace understaffed purposely to require employees work mandatory overtime. Threats of termination if employees dont quit other jobs even if they arent competitors. And last but not least, single handedly created the biggest mistake the company as a whole has ever dealt with by removing inventory buy and build automated functions claiming they could do it better themselves, resulting in inventory being messed up by nearly $1m worth of product, and being on a mandatory overtime schedule for roughly 87% of the past two years because he let all stock drain to nothing so every single thing we sell is on backorder rush status with no clear way to fix it without investing heavy amounts of money into extra temporary staff in order to not lose customers or even potentially close down our location entirely. A bit long I know, but these were the highlighted reasons of my managers termination with about 7 more minor reasons contributing as well. I am just a lead positioned employee directly under my manager so I am included in most conversations with high ups but mostly as a means of communication, I do not have any decision making control, nor do I want to since it has only helped me not be impacted by my managers total incompetence."

AskReddit,feog4vc,t1_feo9zly,1579299621.0,"Last I recall of an article I read nearly 2 years ago, universal healthcare and free education would eliminate nearly 35% of total america debt, improve economic stability, and increase overall income of the average American despite an increased tax which wouldnt be more than about 2% per working person. It would also increase jobs due to more people being able to aquire education to pursue careers without the fear or actual aftermath of debt resulting in an increased industry of properly distributed competition creating a company need to actually lower overall pricing on just about everything, saving the average American even more money......but........ Then the top cant stay at the top by a ridiculous amount of monopoly, but rather a fraction at best more. Even if they were to keep pricing the same with more competition, they wouldnt have nearly the same amount of customers or power of order over the particular industry as they do now.

AskReddit,feog4vc,t1_feo9zly,1579299621.0,"Last I recall of an article I read nearly 2 years ago, universal healthcare and free education would eliminate nearly 35% of total america debt, improve economic stability, and increase overall income of the average American despite an increased tax which wouldnt be more than about 2% per working person. It would also increase jobs due to more people being able to aquire education to pursue careers without the fear or actual aftermath of debt resulting in an increased industry of properly distributed competition creating a company need to actually lower overall pricing on just about everything, saving the average American even more money......but........ Then the top cant stay at the top by a ridiculous amount of monopoly, but rather a fraction at best more. Even if they were to keep pricing the same with more competition, they wouldnt have nearly the same amount of customers or power of order over the particular industry as they do now. Its cheaper to lobby against now than it would be to evolve into a new better economy.




Again from an article I read that could possibly be total nonsense, but interesting and might have some truth to it nontheless."

Afterward it felt nice realizing how much time didn't pass since not being on it. After about the second week I started realizing I payed more attention to conversations and I showed more emotion with my stories with a more satisfying feeling. Now I look forward to conversation with people that say, ""you have no social media, you're a mystery."" It makes me feel like I can bond with them far more because I have the emotion to lay the foundation of my personality. I always have something to talk about that not every single person has already read. I can properly talk about whatever I want in a manner specific to the persons perspective rather than making half of the readers laugh and the other half being offended. It's so much more comforting to have those who want to talk to me actually call or text me rather than message their fake relationships with me.
