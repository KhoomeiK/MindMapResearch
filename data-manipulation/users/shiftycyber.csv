todayilearned,ff3jf6v,t3_ercjcc,1579542324.0,On a smaller scale this is a common practice by many large organizations/well funded security groups. A lot of these groups will create fake websites called honeypots that look enticing to malicious actors because of obvious lose security so they are easy prey. What’s not shown though is that the networking is constantly being audited and logged to show traffic and these companies collect the information of the malicious actors after the fact (there’s really no treasure found in that honey pot so no loss there) and they can compare it to other logs they found for prosecution or security patches.
