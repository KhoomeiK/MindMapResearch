startrek,ffhgtri,t3_et6cmr,1579934629.0,true but. the only problem i find with ship in the bottle type shows per say is that there kinda less realistic. mostly self contained where events do not carry over whereas the arc can tell a far reaching and even more emotional story at times i think.     i think Picard does better in this format then if it was self-contained episodes.

a bit of a modern day political nod over Picard saying starfleet was no longer the starfleet he remembered :-p hmmm wonder how thats related to today :-p

now the 2nd trailer makes more sense too about

i find it a bit interesting that Datas ""mom"" wasnt even mentioned about an android that looks and feels human in this episode though.   guess b4 didnt work out so well . poor guy lol

unless to respect his fathers wishes Data and the crew of the enterprise decided to never reveal to anyone else even starfleet of the fact that she was an android? could make sense because if they did surely they would have gone after her to learn more lol."
