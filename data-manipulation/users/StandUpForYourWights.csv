worldnews,ffh06of,t1_ffgq25q,1579919592.0,I believe the execution of the handicapped in Germany was completed using an injection of phenol and other poisons. Aktion T4 began eliminating the handicapped in Poland in late 1939 and early 1940 using Carbon Monoxide vans. This method proved unsatisfactory when applied to the larger Jewish population in hand after the invasion of the Soviet Union due to the effects on the operators. This led to the development of the static gas chamber in Chelmno in 1941.

I have seen Panzerfaust heads turned into funnel, e39 egg grenades turned into tea strainers and helmets into pots or colanders. 

These look more like the “trench-art” tradition though. Rear area techs with a lot of time on their hands, using the materials they had.

The marks on them are the manufacturers marks. Both marks are well worn but one consists of an eagle above WaA 59. This is the factory code for Rheinmetall Borsig, a well known manufacturer for the Luftwaffe. The other number is likely a batch code."
