AskReddit,ffiqrhe,t3_etohsu,1579980371.0,"Women in American movies & TV are not only drop-dead gorgeous, but really young. Sometimes it's ludicrous - like Denise Richards playing Dr Christmas Jones, a nuclear physicist, in the Bond movie. If you watch some entertaining dreck like CSI:LA, it's hilarious how every woman is young and gorgeous.

I live in the UK now, and it's much better here! TV has regular-looking women here, with some exceptions. Even commercials will usually have normal women in them - middle-aged, or chubby, or older; just... women as the actual human beings they are. It's so cool. My favorite TV series recently has been Happy Valley, starring Sarah Lancashire, who's 55 years old. In the show, she's a pretty but very normal-looking cop and grandmother - and an absolute BAD ASS."

AskReddit,ff6gnxn,t3_ergjyj,1579626795.0,"I managed a B&B in California. Really nice place. A woman booked one of our mid-size cottages, which slept a maximum of four people - two on a Queen bed; one on the trundle bed under the sofa, one on a cot we'd bring in. 

She checked in with TWELVE PEOPLE. Nine adults, two kids. I explained that she would need to book rooms somewhere else for the extra guests, as we were booked solid. She demanded I bring cots in so they could all stay in one room. I explained that we only had four cots at the inn, and fire regulations prohibited us from going over the max occupancy per room - as in, we could lose our fire insurance. Not to mention, there simply wasn't enough area in that room to accommodate twelve cots - they wouldn't fit, even if we could get enough of them.

She started screaming at me, walking toward me and shrieking, red-faced, that she was not going to put up with this; I was going to do as she told me and who did I think I was to say no to her. And then she punched me. In the chest, kind of on the breast bone. It didn't hurt much, but I was gobsmacked. 

It was REALLY fun calling the cops, and watching with a smile as they dragged the guests out of the cottage and told them to GTFO or be charged with assault. And no, I didn't refund her fucking deposit."
AskReddit,ff6fbc0,t1_ff5ybwj,1579625953.0,"I was kind of gobsmacked by what it's like on the other side of worker's comp claims. I was managing a B\&B; had a terrible slip and fall due to negligence by a contractor (he spilled a gallon of clear industrial soap on a tile floor; I came down stairs, stepped on it, heel went out from under me and I landed with all my weight on my right hand - it turned my wrist into gravel, such that my forearm was 3"" shorter and as big around as a cantaloupe). I got some serious nerve damage and needed an operation to pin my wrist bones together. I spent 6 weeks with my right arm in an external fixator - those metal bars that screw into your flesh and bone but protrude outside the arm. Fucking OUCH.

After 4 weeks at home, I got really worried about how the inn was doing, so I went back to work with that metal bar on my arm, and just did as much as I could with my left hand. The weekend after i returned to work, a woman came to stay at the inn. She was overly friendly to me, asking me tons of questions about my arm, etc. She stayed in the nicest suite we had - $675 per night. 

I found out after she left that she'd been sent by the insurance company to scope me out, see if I was faking it. I was confident she'd say I wasn't, because of how I had metal screwed into the flesh and bone of my arm, which was still swollen and yellow/black with bruising. I mean, it was OBVIOUS I was seriously hurt.

But she reported back that I shouldn't get any money from worker's comp because I had gone back to work as soon as I could. This baffles me - if anything,  my eagerness to go back to work demonstrated that I was NOT a fucking lazy lawsuit-loving asshole. I fought her, though, and I won, but to this day, I have poor mobility and nerve damage - and all I got was the cost of the operation. I'll have the damaged wrist for LIFE. And I'm an illustrator, and the broken wrist was my dominant hand."

Here are some very good ones - btw, I don't like history books to be too dense and chewy either; these books are very accessible. \[an hour later\]: Wow, I typed a LOT. Um. Yeah! Well, here are my suggestions. Hope you find something interesting (and distracting, god knows we all need that these days) - 

\- First of all a general tip: Read anything by Erik Larson. If you haven't yet, I mean. He's so, so good at nonfiction, and even the stories that aren't directly political or world-event-based are put in perfect historical context so that it helps make sense of those things. The Devil in the White City is AMAZING; a truly horrific serial killer story interwoven with the story of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The fact that Larson makes architecture as absorbing as serial killing tells you something. He's a great, great writer. Any book of his is worth reading - Thunderstruck; Isaac's Storm; Dead Wake... all brilliant.

\- King Leopold's Ghost by Adam Hochschild. This is an unbelievably grim and amazing story about what happened in the Congo when King Leopold II of Belgium took ""ownership"" of the Congo and exploited its people and land for rubber production. One of the more severe  ""Jesus, humanity can suck"" episodes in history. More like a novel than most history books. Hochschild is a great writer; I'd read anything by him. 

 \- Batavia, by Peter FitzSimons. This one is AMAZING; I can't believe it hasn't been made into a movie yet. One of the most harrowing, astonishing stories I've ever read. Not so much a political or national history book, but what a story, and it does have to do with the Dutch East India Company. This is the story of a ship sent by that company - the Batavia, from Holland to the Dutch East Indies. There is a mutinous plot, led by a guy who would easily qualify as one of the sickest sociopaths I've ever read about - Jeronimus Cornelisz. The ship strikes a reef; all 250 people are marooned on an island, and Cornelisz decides to kill them all except for 40 henchmen and a handful of women to keep as sex slaves. He basically becomes a horrific, sadistic god on this forsaken hunk of rock off the coast of Australia, until a soldier named Wiebbe Hayes figures out how to overthrow him and survive. 

\- The Past is Myself - When I Was A German, by Christabel Bielenberg. Christabel lived through the Nazi horrors of Germany, was in the resistance circles, interrogated by the Gestapo, etc. It's very interesting to read what life was like for normal, moral German citizens during the rise of Hitler. How did they survive? What could they do to resist and counteract the horrors, without themselves and their family being murdered? 

\- We Die Alone: A WWII Epic of Escape and Endurance, by David Howarth and Stephen E. Ambrose. Amazing story of a Norwegian resistance fighter who evaded capture by the Nazis. How he avoided capture and escaped is an astonishing, white-knuckle story. 

\- First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers, by Loung Ung. She survived the Cambodian genocide of Pol Pot's regime as a little girl. Incredible story.  
\- Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century, by George Packer. Holbrooke was a very powerful, brilliant, influential diplomat who did some great things - he was instrumental in the signing of the Dayton Accords, which ended the Balkan wars, for example. Which he partly pulled off by the brainstorm of inviting Milosevic and his enemy (I forget the name) to negotiate at a seedy, isolated hotel in Ohio in the middle of winter, figuring they'd be so bored and eager to leave that they'd sign the accord. It worked. A really amazing life story, full of adventure. But he was also a very flawed guy - ambitious and calculating, betrayed a lot of friends, did some terrible things. George Packer does a good job of drawing the parallel between the USA (brilliant in concept, frequently very flawed, in ways that seem impossible to separate) and Holbrooke's life.

\- Lessons From a Dark Time by Adam Hochschild (again!) This is a collection of his writings on topics like: gun shows; Congolese rape victims; Soviet gulags; secret CIA goings-on; mostly about the people who fight back against despots and ruthless corporate/political bad guys. Actually a bit hope-giving, knowing such people exist - resisting the corruption against such odds.

\- The March of Folly, by Barbara Tuchman. Explores folly (which she defines as governments pursuing policies ultimately contrary to their own interests or beliefs; sound familiar?), she looks at four historical situations: the Trojan War, the breakup of the Holy See provoked by Renaissance Popes, the loss of the American colonies by Britain's George III & the USA's persistent folly in Vietnam. 

\- The Patient Assassin: A True Tale of Massacre, Revenge, and India's Quest for Independence. This is the story of Sikh orphan Udham Singh, who was injured in the infamous Amritsar massacre in India in 1919 - something I'd never known about. Basically the English opened fire on over 1,000 unarmed Indian men, women and children in a courtyard, ordered by Brigadier General Reginald Dyer. Years later, Udham Singh made it to England against great odds, and shot Dyer to death in 1940. Amazing story.

\- Say Nothing, by Patrick Radden Keefe. This is about The Troubles in Northern Ireland, and the story of members of the IRA. Pretty fascinating stuff, and very well written.

\- The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes, and Why, by Amanda Ripley. Just as the title says! Less political, but very survive-y, which can be oddly comforting. 

\- Killers of the Flower Moon - the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, by David Grann. The story of the Osage people in the 1920s in America, who were the richest people per capita in the world at that time due to the discovery of oil in their land, and the conspiracy to murder them off and take the land. The first major homicide investigation by the newly formed FBI. Amazing book."

AskReddit,fdeluqj,t3_ekr8kp,1578341767.0,"I wasn't on the boat, but here's a weird one: I grew up in a small village in Northern California, right on the Pacific coast. It's on a little peninsula that sticks out into the water, so surrounded by ocean on 3 sides, more or less. It also has a couple of small coves around the edge.

I was 15 when this happened. It was a beautiful summer day, with bright blue skies and fog in the mornings and late afternoons, standard in summer for that area. Just gorgeous. I was working as a waitress in a cafe nearby, and at lunch I'd take my food down the headlands to one of the coves, where there was a bench to sit on and gaze out at the lovely little cove and the sea. The fog bank was sitting off the coast a ways, ready to roll in as the sun went down.

I was nearly done with lunch when I heard a motor. It was spluttering, didn't sound too good. Then a white sailboat, maybe 34 ft or so, came out of the fog bank, travelled the distance to the cove, and stopped. I saw the mast was broken, the sail flapping loose and trailing in the water. A person came out of the cockpit, dove into the water, swam to the beach, and ran up the wooden stairs leading from the headlands down to the beach. As they got closer, I saw it was a guy maybe in his 30s - white, sunburned, very thin, with dark hair and a scruffy beard like he hadn't shaved in a while. His eyes were what startled me, though - they were staring, wide, with white showing around the entire iris. He was crying and shaking, too. He looked totally freaked out. He scurried up the steps as fast as he could, and when he got to the top, he started running. He saw me, stopped, pointed at the boat, and said: ""Tell the sheriff or the Coasties that whoever wants that fucking boat can HAVE it. I never want to see it again.""

I said: ""Are you okay? What's wrong with the boat?""

He replied: ""That boat is fucking EVIL. Whoever takes it needs to be careful. I'm serious, tell whoever gets it to watch out. It's fucking EVIL.""

Before I could say anything else, he ran off, up the headlands path, and I watched him until he disappeared into town.

A few days later, the Coast Guard came and salvaged the boat, towed it to a nearby harbor. I tried to find out what happened to it, but the really weird thing is that nobody in town knew anything - and this was a small enough place that everyone knew everything that happened. Some people saw the man running and crying, but nobody saw where he went, or heard anything more about him. I never found out what happened to the boat, either. Weird."

Client says something like: ""I like this one, but it's not quite right..."" and their input is incredibly vague. ""That green is too happy"", that kind of thing. Designer spends hours psychologically clawing out more detailed feedback from client, which usually boils down to: Too much white space; not enough jazzy icons, and I want you to put a picture of my dog in the piece (or some such crap - my favorite client request of all time was ""I want you to draw a cartoon monkey that looks like that little black boy on TV, you know, the smart one - Urkel"".

AskReddit,fcv885g,t1_fcugs0e,1577996683.0,"I'm an American who's lived in England for the past five years. I'm married to an Englishman, so I'll be here for the foreseeable. I love it here. I miss a lot of things about the USA, but not enough to move back. Driving here is much less pleasant, except for roundabouts, which are brilliant (though it took 2 years to not be afraid of them!). 

The biggest and most surprising differences are:

\- The NHS, obviously. The first time I went to my GP here for a checkup, I literally could not grasp that going to the doctor was 100% free, like, for real. I went to the front desk after finishing with the doc, and asked the woman if I owed them any money at all - was there a copay, or a clinic fee, or one of those cute little hidden charges Americans are used to paying? She said: ""No, it's completely free,"" and my jaw fell open. I mean, I knew the NHS meant that health care here  was SUPPOSED to be free, but after a lifetime of being one accident or illness away from homelessness and poverty, I couldn't quite believe it was true.

\- The cops here are (for the most part) nearly invisible, and very nice. I'm sure that has something to do with my race (white) and class (lower middle-class), but it's different from the US regardless. I'm not anxious when I see a cop here, and I don't worry about being pulled over or bullied by some sociopathic low-IQ fucker who got into the force because he likes brutalising people (not all American cops, yeah yeah, but I have had a couple very bad experiences and have some friends who had worse). It's nice not to be actively scared of the police, it turns out. Good old America; what the fuck. 

\- This one's a bit hard to describe, but: In the USA, there's this myth that if you just work hard, you'll be rich and successful. Bootstrap yourself, and if it doesn't work and you remain poor, it's your fault. It goes hand in hand with a sort of cocky American smugness, which you can see evidence of in movies, tv, comedy, whatever. One of the things I love about the English is that it's automatically assumed that everyone's going to fuck up at some point in their lives, or maybe repeatedly. It's no big deal; in fact it can be funny and a lot of English comedy reflects this attitude. Maybe it's because of the historic and stubbornly persistent class system here, I dunno, but if you're poor in the UK, it's not seen to be the huge character flaw it is in the USA. People here are much funnier, and more sarcastic, and it's just assumed that life is ridiculous. It's incredibly refreshing."

1. Joan as Gilda from Rigoletto, ""Caro Nome"". Dear name, that first caused my heart to beat! Gilda is the sweet, slightly dumb daughter of the hunchback from my reply above. Virginal, chaste, adoring. Singing to the Duke, who has appeared to her in disguise, saying his name is Gualtier Malde (the first words you'll hear). He's basically the only man she's ever seen aside from her father. She sings this stunningly. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8MVx6b5gNs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8MVx6b5gNs)
2. Joan as Tosca, from Puccini's opera of that name. In this opera, she's a famous singer, beautiful and strong, who has a boyfriend; she's worldly and sensual. The opposite of Gilda in many ways. Here she sings ""Vissi D'Arte"" - I lived for art. She's singing because the evil Baron Scarpia is torturing her boyfriend in a nearby cell, to try to force Tosca to sleep with Scarpia. She knows she'd rather die (and she does), but first she sings this heartbreaking cry to God: ""I lived for my art, I lived for love, I never did harm to a living soul! With a secret hand I relieved as many misfortunes as I knew of. Always with true faith my prayer rose to the holy shrines. Always with true faith I gave flowers to the altar. In the hour of grief why, why, o Lord, why do you reward me thus? I gave jewels for the Madonna’s mantle, and I gave my song to the stars, to heaven, which smiled with more beauty. In the hour of grief why, why, o Lord, ah, why do you reward me thus?""[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wailyZ1WBg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wailyZ1WBg)

AskFeminists,fcjzo5m,t3_ehkfid,1577711864.0,"Okay, first of all, thanks. Because this topic has been bashing around in my head for decades, and I've tried getting a few other people interested in it without success. I know opera bores the bejesus out of most people, but my father was a classical musician and opera singer (among other things), who reviewed classical music for a newspaper, and he dragged me along from a young age. I grew up being taught about opera, and I know a few by heart.

I think most operas - 98% probably - are wildly sexist, from today's POV. Yes, they were sexist when written, too, but the composers and librettists didn't see the issue for the problem it is. So, most opera roles for women (and the stories they inhabit) are pretty cliched. You've got Gilda in Rigoletto (vapid virgin daughter of the court hunchback, seduced by the asshole Duke; sings an AMAZING song - Caro Nome - about him but eventually volunteers to be murdered by her own father, basically, to save the shithead Duke who doesn't give a single shit about her). Women who are desirable in operas frequently end up dying of TB, or murdered, etc, leaving the invariably male hero to sing his heartbreak out.

But there are a couple of operas that have surprisingly great female roles in them, and one that I firmly contend is a BRILLIANT example of female empowerment - including the way the music was written. Except for the very end, when she's stabbed, Carmen is a kick-ass, sex-positive, funny, intelligent, and extremely powerful character. Yeah, she's all ""gypsy sex kitten"", but SHE decides who she kittens with, not any guy. And if you listen to the way Bizet wrote the opera, it's almost funny how clearly on Carmen's side he was. Listen to the leitmotifs (theme music) for both Carmen, and the other main female character. Micaela. Micaela is from the hero Don Jose's home village, and she comes to town to find Don Jose, to bestow upon him a kiss - from his MOTHER.

Carmen's whole outlook can be seen in maybe the most famous song from this opera: the Habanera.She sings:

Love is a rebel bird

That no one can domesticate

And it's in vain that we call for it

If it's convenient for it to refuse you

Nothing helps, threats or prayers

One talks well, the other one is silent

It's the other one I prefer

He didn't say anything, but he pleases me...

Brilliant. Then of course she goes on to the ""If you don't love me, I love you. And if I love you: WATCH OUT."" Literally. The music is sultry, stompy, fun.

Whereas Micaela first scurries onto the stage in the most mouselike, timid way, and her music is equally watery and weak. Listen to those violins as she itties along! She's a delicate petunia. And she goes into her whole song about ""Don Jose, your mom said to find you and give you a chaste mom-type kiss, but OMG it's so DARING of me and OH GOSH I simply CANNOT, oh blush stammer"". And then she does - a chaste peck on the forehead - and is so overcome by this brush with sexual drama (??) that she has to scurry away and sing about Jesus or some shit. Is it any wonder Don Jose drops his military career like a hot rock as soon as sexy, interesting Carmen sashays along?

And of course, Don Jose is the biggest douchecanoe in opera history. I could go on and on, but WHAT A BELLEND.

So, yes: all opera is sexist but still so much of it is great; I'm against changing them too much, because we can still appreciate art we don't agree with - ask any feminist. Heh. Also, surprisingly for a Nazi lover, Wagner's heroines could be strong and complex as well - Brunhilde from the Ring cycle! Not Sieglinde; she's a bit of a drip. But the Valkyries, and Erda the Green-Faced Torso... I'll stop now, but thanks for asking a question I've been dying to yammer on about for years!"

AskReddit,fc8n7d6,t3_egbmco,1577538356.0,"American living in England for the past 5 years, married to an Englishman. Because of the similarities and shared history & language between our countries, I was NOT expecting to be baffled by England quite as much as I have been. Here are the highlights of surprising things I've learned about England :

\- The street/road signage here is nonexistent, or terrible. I've been told this is because in WWII, signs were taken down, so as to baffle the invading Germans. But I've also been told this is a myth, so. When there are street signs, they're small and hard to read, and placed so ambiguously that there's no way to deduce which of the streets the sign refers to. 

\- That said, there are brilliant place names here. I live close to Fingringhoe. I've been to Sandy Balls, Bachelors Bump, Balls Green, and Titty Ho. English people are so used to this that attempts to share a laugh about these will usually get you a tired sigh.

\- Okay, this one BLEW MY MIND: There are no brooms here. Not the kind I'm used to from the USA. I went to five shops recently in one day, trying to find just a plain, regular broom for our kitchen. There were none to be had. The closest are these weird 45º angled ones with the point in the center, with short handles, or an outdoor pushbroom-type thing that won't fucking work. I am actually stunned by the broom weirdness here. Tried to describe what I was looking for in a broom; got the blankest stares. I finally bought one from a friend who imports cleaning supplies from the US.

\- When English people say ""How are you?"", they don't actually want to know; the correct response is for you to say ""How are you"" back, or at a push, ""Fine, thanks""

\- When someone says ""What have you got on this evening"" while on the phone to you, it does not mean ""what are you wearing""; it's how some English people ask what you're doing. Learned that one the hard way, after stammering ""uh, jeans and a hoodie..?"" to a male client. He pissed himself laughing, explained he was not trying to phone-sex me and will not let me live this down for the rest of my life, apparently.

\- This one's fun: The English will happily slag their own country for just about any reason, except for one. The weather sucks, the roads are awful, High Streets aren't what they used to be, public transport blows.. you name it. But do not, DO NOT try to criticise English electrical plugs, unless you want to see an English person throw a hilarious tantrum (""Oh, I suppose you'd like to go back to the States to be ELECTROCUTED by your weak little wiggly plugs and your terrible unsafe wiring standards? Our plugs are EXQUISITELY CRAFTED to fit PRECISELY AND SNUGLY into the outlets, not like those ridiculous LOOSE METAL PRONGLETS you people have, and - "". I pointed out that even though they're well made, they are very hard to pull out, and every English person I was with agreed that this was because, like all Americans, I had ""weak little sausage fingers""."
AskWomenOver30,fc6hpd0,t3_efotuw,1577480836.0,"Hi. I was really struck by your post b/c I feel the same way, and it's something I've been thinking about a ton for the past few years.

Every family member I had has died. Dad in '96, then my brother unexpectedly in 2008 and Mom 14 months after that. I have no aunts, uncles, cousins, etc - no other relatives left in the world. Nobody is alive who I grew up with. Nobody knows what childhood was like for me and my brother. I have no one with whom I share that kind of shorthand we only develop after knowing someone for a long, long time. It's a very lonely feeling, and disorienting as hell. Like being an electron that lost its atom. I used to draw and paint, and write a lot, but since 2010 when my mom died and I was alone, I haven't been able to, because it feels like: what's the point?

I don't have any solutions for you (and would you believe me if I said I did? No). But I can share some helpful tips that keep me going. It's true that points, spirituality, narratives, all that comforting stuff IS illusory. Humans make up meaning in order not to go nuts, or jump off buildings. I get it. And what do you do, once you have that knowledge in your head?

The things that help me are:

1. Volunteer somewhere (dog rescue groups work best for me because I like dogs way more than I like people), or even better, foster or adopt dogs from a rescue group. Something along those lines. Feeling needed helps. I just adopted a rescue dog - an older, wrinkly fellow whose owner died, and he really needed somewhere to live as he wasn't doing well in the kennel. He's snoring and farting next to me as I type this, his enormous ridiculous head mushed into the side of my hip. Without him around, I wouldn't get up and go for walks twice a day, because see above re: what's the point? But I'll do it for him, because he's not a numb, nihilistic human; he's a dorky old marshmallow who needs me to get off my ass.
2. Do you like music? I find that while I'm numb most of the time, music can still reach into that fog and make me feel things. So I bought a cheap acoustic guitar, and I'm forcing myself to learn how to play it. It's not always fun, because - again - what's the point, says my brain. But even in the worst of the apathy, there is something about making notes and chords happen (very VERY badly, even) that wakes up something in the parts of my brain that maintain emotional resonance and intellectual curiosity. And no, there is no point to it. If I learn to play guitar, it's not going to make any difference to anyone, and I will die, and that learning will die with me. BUT, it helps me bear the time I have to spend in the world before dying, and that's good.
3. Finally, this may sound weird, but please hear me out: You may be similar to me, in that I cannot seem to do nice things for myself without a shit-ton of effort. I'm not very kind to myself, and I hate clothes and makeup and girly hair nonsense. But a few years ago, a therapist suggested to me that once a day, I put a pillow on my lap, imagine that pillow is me as a child, and hug it. Tell that little girl/pillow: It's not your fault, and life is hard but you're here and you are worth taking care of. I know that sounds ridiculous. But I tried it, and I'll be damned if I didn't start crying because that little pillow/girl was born into this fucked up world, and she didn't deserve to be here, but she IS and she needs hugs.
4. Okay, one more: When all else fails, watch British comedy clips on YT. Why British (I'm American but live in the UK these days)? Because Brit comedy, and people in general, have a really good grasp on the pointlessness and absurdity of life, and don't take themselves nearly as seriously as Yanks do. It helps. Watch Frankie Boyle if you can take really dark, hilarious absurd stuff. Watch clips of David Mitchell and Lee Mack on Would I Lie To You.

I'll stop now because this is getting long.  Just wanted to reach out and pointlessly fistbump you, from one numb person to another. You can always off yourself; I think of it a lot too. But since that's final... I hope you don't, and that things get a bit pointier for you. XO"

This episode ended up being a total nightmare, which I won't go on about, but looking back, I have to laugh because there I was - a short, thin white girl with red, bugged-out eyes, sounding like Stephen Fry's General Melchett from Blackadder."

I was so sad, and so freaked out. But, my mom was a hippie who took my brother and I to a commune. Our first year there, she became BFFs with a young woman I'll call M. M became our second mother. She helped raise my brother and I, and loved us so much. She helped both of us through a terrible time of being betrayed and abandoned by our dad - and then, she stuck around, leaving when we did, living with us (though she and my mom were both straight; they each had boyfriends but M and Mom were the constants in our lives). 

So: No biological connection. But M is 100% my Other Mother. My bio-parents are both dead now, as (sadly) is my brother. And I'm middle-aged now. But M is still my parent, and when she is old and needs taking care of, you better believe I'll be there. She earned that kind of love - the kind a kid has for a person who cares for them and loves them. And that's what this guy cheated himself of - and the little girl unfortunate enough to be in this situation."
