AskReddit,fdrr3fm,t3_emuqv4,1578688386.0,"I never had a proper relationshipship before. The one almost relationship that I was in was horrible to say the least. My choices were always questioned and ridiculed. I always felt ugly when I was around him. I never felt good enough no matter how hard I tried. He always thought he could do better. Naturally ""it"" never worked out.

I was depressed for the next 2 years. Life was hell. I slowly pull myself out of that. Cut forward, I meet this guy at work. This guy tells me he likes me and wants to date for real. I wasn't impressed and didn't want to get hurt again. Somehow we start to date. I notice something when I'm with this guy, that didn't seem quite right. He doesn't ridicule my choices. He isn't mean when I say something dumb. He makes me feel pretty. Tells me ""It's okay, things will work out"". One day it hit me, ""Damn, I've fallen in love""

In short, I knew I had fallen in love when I didn't have to stop and think what will he say when I wanted to do something.

TLDR Absolute trust. When you know that the other person will be with you no matter what that's when you know you've fallen, irrevocably, in love."

Vasikrathu is used for both ( reading and playing an instrument) but without context it almost always means reading. Hence the answer."
