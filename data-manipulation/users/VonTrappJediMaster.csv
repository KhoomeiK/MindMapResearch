So out of all of these, I'm only a working woman. I'm not a mom, not divorced (never married), not pregnant out of wedlock (don't want children ever), and only half educated bc I graduated high school but didn't go to college.

Am I a wimp? Am I half a wimp? Am I half a woman? SOmeone please help with this existential crisi"

LosAngeles,fc3g8up,t1_fc3bkxe,1577389122.0,"so I'm the OP of the post linked and I can tell you the first few weeks were HAAAARD because I was so used to having a stove. been living there for almost eight months and it's fine now. I ended up not getting a hot plate or crock pot or anything like that mostly bc I'm kinda lazy and decided to just eat a bunch of salads and get pre-cooked chicken that you can heat up in the microwave.

I only have one sink between my bathroom and ""kitchen"" so that's where I wash dishes but bc I dont have an oven to cook with, I rarely have a lot of dirty dishes so that's not a huge issue. 

If the price is right for you and it's in a convenient area for you, I say you should def think about getting it. you can start saving up to move into a 1 br apartment after your lease is up with the money you'll be saving by living in a studio apartment like that."
