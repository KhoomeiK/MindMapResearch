television,fgu27w3,t1_fgewdua,1581112417.0,"You’re totally right. Which is unfortunate. It’s not what’s even funny, but what people can relate to culturally. And what has the most viral potential. And someone like lil nas x doesn’t need to do anything funny, his viral power is more than enough. Shame."
educationalgifs,fgu1trk,t1_fgtwawp,1581112212.0,"In laymen’s terms, and an entirely uneducated person like me, the latter half of that sentence is really all I need to understand. Thanks for that."
HongKong,fgu1q4n,t1_fgtxazm,1581112162.0,"Appreciate that response. One last thing, in the article it was saying that much younger, and older people are far more prone to actually dying, whereas the healthier middle aged adults have faired much better. Would you say that being overall healthy and having a healthy immune system may keep this virus at bay?"
classicwow,fgu09qg,t3_f08koj,1581111672.0,Welcome to old school RuneScape my friend. It was inevitable. This is just how games are played now.

HongKong,fgtvp9d,t1_fgtit5v,1581109961.0,"I read in a recent report, the fatality rate of this virus is roughly 2% of those infected. And I think the number of infected is between 25,000-30,000. Correct me if I’m wrong of course. But a 2% fatality rate isn’t too high, is it?"
pcmasterrace,fgtuo83,t1_fgtsqz0,1581109653.0,Let’s be real....every state has fucked roads. California is god awful. And half the roads in Oregon are dirt. So yeah. That’s right.

television,fgew4pp,t1_fge6niz,1580712295.0,"I remember when Doritos commercials were always the shit. And they never had celebrities. Just good concepts. And it wasn’t just 1 either. They’d usually pull out 3-4 solid ones. This one with the stupid dance off with Lil Nas X...it’s so corny. And cringy. And REEKS of desperation, and feels Uber tryhard. So many commercials just force it. With unnatural, and recycled material. Bleh."

Just keep being a good person, and hopefully the people that deal with assorted countries don’t generalize an entire populace based off of one interaction with said individual.

49ers,fg8u950,t1_fg73jfj,1580629736.0,"Yeah basically analysis and pundits are already saying he’s already a Hall of famer, and one of the greatest of all fucking time. Three years in...the media has a major erection and fetish for QBs that put up numbers because that’s what drives the ratings. And with most of these younger, more modern analysts and ex players, they’re firm believers in high octane offenses as the key to winning, not defenses."
49ers,fg8syqh,t3_exg28a,1580629197.0,Hype videos broski. There was one posted in this reddit earlier that detailed the last three years and the journey we went through. A nice recap tongrt her caught up of what’s been happening since Kyle and Lynch took over

LifeProTips,fg3n61i,t1_fg2xgc4,1580485424.0,So you have never fried any food because you’re too afraid of a video you saw while you were a kid? Please don’t live your life like this! Frying your own food leads to some of the most amazing food. You can do this! There’s also precautions you can take to prevent this. I’d do some research if I were you. But please don’t negate yourself from eating home made fried food!

49ers,fg3l2g4,t1_fg3if4z,1580484076.0,"While there’s no denying that, I feel like most of the statistical analysis goes out the window. Obviously in order for these two teams that make it, they require high ratings, all around. But I see it as a blank slate. These two teams are so closely matched up man."

49ers,fg3ka2a,t3_ewppau,1580483555.0,"Yeah, I just heard this on ESPN too. It’s straight up licking mahomes and the chiefs ass holes. This whole segment has been nothing, but. 

Adam shefter too - “the chiefs yesterday just had this feeling that the trophy was theirs.” Quality breakdown of how the game was going to be won. Strictly through their mindset. 

I don’t even know why the fuck I’m watching any talk shows. It’s all the same Shit.


Rex Ryan though! He’s got our back. The only one. With a reasonable, thoughtful, and realistic breakdown. Which led to his choice of picking us. I have a new found respect for him."
49ers,fg309r9,t1_fg0znnv,1580464191.0,"Man, I remember when analysts had chosen Kyle Allen and the panthers over the niners. Saying jimmy is unproven and Kyle was playing so good that we stood little chance in shutting him down. When in reality it was the opposite. Kyle hasn’t played anyone. And it showed. We straight up double fisted him, without permission, and lube."
coolguides,fg2ygvl,t1_fg2opi4,1580461619.0,"Lest we forget, hot railing! Make sure to get a glass tube insanely hot, to which you put the other colder side in your nose and then you put the hot side onto some ground up stuff (meth) and inhale through your nose. It’ll cause the product to vaporize. And after a few seconds you exhale, and the vapor will pour out of your mouth.

I swing a golf club right handed only. I do my check marks like a right handed person. I hold my fork wiry my left hand. And therefore I use my knife to cut stuff with my right hand. And everything else, I use my left hand, or my left leg. I’m a mutt in regards to my left and rightness. But I’m lefty dominant for sure."
