More interesting, when speaking with clients about distribution of Sky tv, or Virgin Tv etc (all paid for tv which has adverts, Comcast have just bought sky) the kids rooms are never brought into the equation, they all just watch Netflix, prime and YouTube. 

A lot of the younger clients I now speak to just laugh at the idea of paying for tv like sky and virgin which includes adverts, Netflix is the I’m willing to spend a tenner a month, I already pay for
Prime for free shipping, but pay 50/60 quid for sky is laughable.
