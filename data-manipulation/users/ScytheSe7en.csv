Like, the Star Wars movies span some 70 years in-universe, and the setting is one where there will always be conflict. So why must there always be conflict?


Is it because of nationalism/space racism? Is it because there will always be people willing to start wars to seize power? Is it because people are inherently violent? Is it because an uncaring cosmic god is more concerned with some imagined ""balance"" than the actual lives it rules over?

Add to that they were obviously made after the 1st Death Star (and probably the 2nd, too, due to Superlaser tech advancements), they were, at the earliest, built in the gap in trilogies. However, Palpatine only revealed his plan in episode IX, meaning his fleet most likely wasn't ready until episode IX. In any case, the fact that they're 50% larger than ISD-Is makes them looking exactly the same stupid from every perspective that isn't ""I want to reuse the Rogue One model because it's cheap."" They didn't even bother to change the tower design to make them look like ISD-IIs!"
StarWars,ffuj888,t1_ffuhveg,1580243108.0,"JJ Abrams seemed pretty eager to appeal to all the Star Wars nerds who hated TLJ. It's not exactly massive nerdery to want a Star Wars movie to make basic sense. For instance, the prequels: George Lucas got a lot wrong, but one of the things he actually got right was the Venator. It's recognizably a precursor to the ISD, but is different to reflect that it's from a different time. It would have been silly and lazy for the Venator to just be a 33% smaller ISD with a different paint scheme.

The Xyston, by contrast, was made somewhere around **53 years** after the ISD-I. By contrast, the Venator is only 22 years older than the ISD-I (going by Wookiepedia time estimates). It makes no sense for a new ship to look exactly the same as a half-century-old ship (looking at you, Star Trek), especially with the existence of the ISD-II and budgets as big as Disney-backed Star Wars.  I'm not saying the design *had* to be the Onager, just that the Onager-class was a perfectly good design that would have made much more sense if it appeared in the Xyston's place."

Say what you want about the [Mandator-IV Dreadnought](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mandator_IV-class_Siege_Dreadnought), at least they bothered to make a new design.

Now, I remember a lot of speculation that the Xyston would be a refit all the ISD-Is that were hidden away by Palpatine before his death, but they're 50% larger, so they're supposedly a wholly new design. Why would they make a new ship that looks *exactly*, literally *exactly*, like an old ship and not even bother to use the ISD-II design? It literally only makes sense from the perspective of wanting to reuse the Rogue One ISD model, which is what they did, but obviously that isn't what Palpatine would do."

They obviously put a lot of effort into the [Night Buzzard](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Night_Buzzard) (the ship of the Knights of Ren), and it looks super cool, so why couldn't they give half an ass about the most prominent ship in the last movie of the Sequel Trilogy."

It fulfills the same role as the Xyston, and is both and original and cool design, so why didn't they go with it for the Final Order fleet, and would it have been better if they had?

I realize it's less recognizable, but the Xyston-class is literally just the Rogue One CGI ISD model scaled up by 50% with a gun stuck on the bottom, and it's incredibly lazy. Why did they even bother going through the trouble of making a cool new planetary siege star destroyer leading up to episode IX if they're going to use a much worse design? Was that the plan, and they just ran out of money? I know that, canonically, it's an older Imperial design, but the Xyston is literally a scaled-up ISD-I, so I don't see why there'd possibly be a problem with that.

Like, it literally fulfills the exact same role as the Xyston-class, but is a much better design and would arguably fit better in the movie.
