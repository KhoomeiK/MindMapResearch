depression,ff80mvh,t1_ff807cb,1579662903.0,By George Ezra?? Because that's a song I listened to when I was suicidal after a breakup :-/
AskWomen,fee5zn7,t1_fedwhld,1579027104.0,"I'm not the biggest film buff so I can only think of Jordan Peele and his movie Get Out or Us but before that his little skits I used to watch on YouTube called Key and Peele. I just enjoy social commentary in general wherever I may see it -- shows, documentaries, art, music, short stories/books, etc.

EDIT: just thought of one movie I liked but it's also very weird/cringe that touched on social media/mental illness -- Ingrid Goes West"
AskWomen,fectsjz,t1_fecmc82,1578984324.0,Train to Busan was so good! IMO better than Parasite in the sense that I can watch it over and over again and still be entertained plus a good storyline -- but I guess Parasite is social commentary/about class which is with the times and that much more award-worthy!
AskWomen,fectls3,t1_feck63n,1578984114.0,Yeah I thought of Us too even though that's a horror film but I really really liked Us!
AskWomen,fectgxm,t3_eofftc,1578983964.0,"I love anything social commentary so that aspect I really liked and growing up poor I was able to relate and laugh at certain scenes that was literally my life at one point like>!searching for free open public wifi from neighbors.!< Idk why I especially loved the ending -- it was what made me think ""wow what a good movie"" but the whole SPOILER ALERT >!killing/fighting of the worker families!< was kinda anticlimactic for me/felt like it cheapened things -- I guess I didn't expect it or expected something else? His other movie Snowpiercer was also about class so I like the director's ideas but I think the execution was poor there so Parasite was better and more entertaining"
