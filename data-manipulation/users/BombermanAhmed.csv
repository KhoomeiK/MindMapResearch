Keep going man. It’s hard, I know. But always remember her for the good memories you spent with her. If you’ve got any videos or pictures, look at those. It’ll help you out. Tell your family about her. Remind them of her. Always remember her. And remember this: “Indeed, with Hardship comes Ease.” Always remember that. And one last thing. Don’t push yourself down. Always have your head held high. I’m sure your mother would’ve wanted this. Anyways, I’m very very sorry for your loss man and I hope you and your brother are doing all right.

Even now I’m going through shit in my life, but I gotta keep going. And I always think about Etika and his words of motivation. Telling me to keep going regardless. And so I keep going. And I play Persona 5 and will finish it in honor of him. 

Don’t worry about me though I’m doing well. I didn’t know Etika well sadly. I had begun following him just months before his unfortunate suicide. I really wanted to interact with him. I look back at it now and I wish I had maybe told him that there’s a light at the end, and to seek help. I wish I had said that and had seen the shit he was going through. Sometimes I watch his streams, and I say to myself, “he can’t be dead. Right?” But then I remember. 

Sorry for this whole speech. Got myself carried away. But just remember you’re not the only one going though this. And thats why we’re all here for you and everyone else and we’ve got your backs."

Advice,fdc08kp,t3_ekj3xd,1578264613.0,"u/SupaZman puts it well. Start going to the gym more, and improving yourself more. 

I would recommend also that you try to look into video games as well. I get it you’re in Uni and all that, but video games can help to relax as well as finding communities and friends. So for example, I’m into Smash Bros. I still need to find communities and people who play smash near me, but we’re getting there. If you’re into Smash Bros, I would start trying to find communities near you, and local tourneys near you. 

However, try to find clubs in your university pertaining to the interests that you like. Explore yourself and figure out what are you interested in. What sports do you like? What video games do you like? Do you like any instruments? Have you ever thought of playing an instrument? And if so, figure out what instrument you wanna play. 

Write down goals for what you want to do this year, long-term and short-term goals. That will keep you motivated and will help you keep going with uni.

But also, try to find study groups that can help you out at the university with your studies. Maybe that is a good place to start, I don’t know. After all I’m not even in college yet, I’m just in high school! But hopefully this really helps you out, and peace be upon you!"
