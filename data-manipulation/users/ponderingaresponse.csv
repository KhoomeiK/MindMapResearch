People in their 50's and 60's have always been the ones in power, ever since we started living that long. The generation prior to mine are the ones who invented post-industrial capitalism, and a few generations before them the ones who invented industrial capitalism, and we can keep going back.   

I think there's an issue of class power that's being mistaken for generational power. One of my kids worked in the White House for Obama and like his colleagues, saw the opportunity for his generation to fix some things. Millions of boomers voted for him.

If the owner has left, it is a clear act of neglect. Call animal control in your jurisdiction and have the animal impounded. Have them document any sign of distress that the dog has experienced: damage to the room, poop/pee, hyperactivity, etc. Take pictures yourself when you open the hotel room door with the animal control officers, and have them take pictures as well.

The hotel ""guest"" will have to explain the situation to the animal control officers when they go to retrieve the animal. What happens next will be specific to the jurisdiction, but it won't be pleasant for the dog's owner.

The system that put younger people in the place they are now in was well established by the time I came of age. I've fought it throughout my life.
