Ended up moving 1100 miles to get me away from pollution,  off the coast, and away from the pine trees of Virgina. I got so every coastal storm sent me to the doctor for respiratory infections.

Asthma attacks knock me down for days. It just takes everything you have and a bit more. Don't get me started on side effects of the inhalers, nebulizer treatments, and the worst one, steroids. I get so tired I just want to sleep, but the meds won't let me."
AmItheAsshole,ffa11ae,t3_esabza,1579725724.0,"As someone who has been in the hospital because of someone like you, YTA in a HUGE way. Asthma is not something to play with. It can and does kill people. A bit of second hand smoke or smoke odor coming from your clothes may not seem a huge thing to you, but for an asthmatic, it can be life or death. If you want to ruin your lungs, that is your choice, but you do not get to make that decision for others. Have a little common courtesy and don't force your stench on others. At the least, she will have had to use her inhaler which has some lovely side effects. At the worst, she could end up with a course of oral steroids, a very painful shot of steroids (or maybe both) which have awful side effects, or end up in the hospital."

AskReddit,fdts55m,t3_en0s29,1578721352.0,"In 4th grade, I had a horrible teacher. She hated me because I was pulled out of her class one day a week for special classes as I was very advanced. 

I was always bored in her class and wanted to read as I always finished so fast. She refused to allow me to read, write, draw, or do anything after I finished. I had to sit without moving, facing forward. Other kids were allowed to read or draw when finished. My mom had several conferences about it and she was told to stop, but wouldn't. 

The last straw for my mom was the day I came home soaked in my own urine. 

In order to use the bathroom, we had to stand under the paper towel holder until given permission. It was a good system until it came to me. Not only was I the youngest and smartest kid in the class, I was also the tallest by 3 or 4 inches. I didn't fit under the paper towel holder. One day, angry that I had been pulled out of her class for the whole day the day before (all day every Thursday) she refused to let me go to the bathroom unless I stood up straight under the paper towel holder like I was supposed to. 

As I was about 2 inches taller than the bottom of it, I couldn't, so she wouldn't let me go. She said if I wouldn't obey, I would have to wait until lunch, an hour away. I was obviously not able to wait and wet myself. She made me stand there as she didn't want the desk wet and wouldn't let me go to the office. 

I went home smelling awful. My mom smelled me as I went in the door, told me to change, and took me right back to the school. I didn't hear what she, the principal, or the teacher said, but we had a substitute the last 2 months of school and I was the class hero. The other kids were really nice about it and no one teased me because they all hated her."

AskReddit,fdoe5do,t3_eme5r7,1578603457.0,"1982 Datsun 310GX. First car I bought for myself in 1990. Had a standard transmission and a sun roof. No AC. I loved that car and it was so much fun to drive. I had to sell it in 1997 because I was pregnant with my second child and could not get 2 car seats in it, and a 2 door car with an infant and a toddler was not my idea of fun. I still miss that car, despite the carburetor that I could never get the fast idle to work properly. I did a lot of work on that car and it was like letting go of a friend."

Shaving isn't the best thing for them, but necessary in the circumstances. I have one who was shaved a year ago before I got her and her coat was awful, but it is getting bettered as she sheds/regrow hair. As a dog lover and springer owner, the idea of one of these magnificent animals being treated that way is horrifying. Definitely NTA"

One of them had a dad who was at the Pentagon on a temporary duty assignment (He was okay, but it was the next day before they knew that). Over half were military kids. So much fear and agony for middle schoolers to bear. I went home and bawled for an hour after putting my own 2 little ones to bed. I felt like I had absorbed my kids' pain and fear. The next week was rough, trying to keep things as normal as possible at school."

aww,fdchrfq,t1_fdch70w,1578275209.0,"I would say more like 10-12 per rooster or he will tear them up mating them too often. You don't need a roo at all unless you are planning to breed.  Hens are often happier without a roo unless he's exceptionally good natured. I have 3, 1 for each flock. The old man has 12 old ladies. The middle aged guy is in the big flock with about 20, and the youngster is in with 4 older girls who keep him in line. My boys are all very calm boys, bantam cochins, and are super gentle with the girls. They were all accidents hatched by our hens. I wouldn't have them otherwise. We keep them separate from one another after having 2 roosters in the large flock kill one another 5 years ago."

My students used to ask me who does my French manicure and were so amazed that the only thing that touches my nails is my hand lotion. Age and RA have messed up my nails so I can't grow them as long and my hair has darkened to brown with age, but people still assume I perm it because I have poodle style curls.
