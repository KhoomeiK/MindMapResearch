AskReddit,feg5xsa,t1_feev4vs,1579078464.0,"No dude, the point of the parades are to celebrate sexual identity and  to deny that would be a serious step backwards. Save yourself a load of outrage and pay less attention to photos and videos that can easily be tampered with or taken out of context and maybe attend a parade for yourself to get a feeling for the whole atmosphere.

The LGBTQ community has nothing to do with pedophilia as you say. The people that hate LGBTQ people have started this slander of trying to associate pedophiles with queer people, they are doing that to purely to shift public opinion rather than out of genuine concern. It's a way saying something so outrageous that people then try to 'meet them in the middle' by making ridiculous concessions (like taking sex out of a sexuality parade)."
AskReddit,fedjsld,t1_fedivm8,1579013306.0,Said without a hint of irony or self awareness lol.
AskReddit,fedirm4,t1_fedfp2h,1579012584.0,"I think you are missing the point. Pride parades aren't meant to be inclusive of straight people as straight people aren't being discriminated against. Nobody is denying straight people the right to be with the ones they love or anything. The point of the LGBTQ+ community standing on a symbolic ""pedestal"" is to say that they are here and that this is who they are and society just needs to recognise that fact and deal with it. Keep in mind that being straight is essentially the default setting for 80 plus percent of the population. Queer people are in the minority and unfortunately need to be more vocal in order to be recognised as equal and indeed valid.

I hear this complaint about the overtly sexual nature of pride parades being a problem for children and really it's a non issue. First of all, this is a parade about sexuality - sex is going to be a main feature. If you are really concerned about your children being ""corrupted"" then keep them away from the parade? But really children aren't going to care about a man in tight leather an gimp costumes because they aren't sexual beings and just don't make the connection. I don't see the same concern about women in bikinis on the beach being raised."
AskMen,fedg5lp,t3_eol4le,1579010627.0,"This is going to sound bad but I think the reality is that a lot of guys don't get compliments simply because there isn't much to compliment them on. Often, women are flattered by men either by habit or to flirt with them and also because women do take more care in their appearance than men do. If a guy is deserving of a compliment then it's probably best to keep it as casual or neutral as possible. And if possible, don't single them out, compliment a few people at once so they don't think you're focusing on just them."
AskReddit,fedf8e7,t1_fedcnus,1579009895.0,"You realize that people have been discriminated against, beaten, raped and murdered just because of their sexuality right? Pride parades and protests are the community's way of standing together and telling the world that they will not be intimidated into hiding who they are like it was in the past. Yes it can seem over the top to some people and others can take offense at the sometimes overtly sexual nature of the parades but that's kinda the point. Queer people have been living in fear and shame for far too long and the occasional parade or protest goes a long way to helping people in the community be themselves. If you really don't have a problem with LGBTQ+ people then maybe talk to a few and try to understand why pride is so essential to such a marginalized community."
depression,fe9k149,t3_enrs4c,1578938514.0,"Oh absolutely. I even wrestled with telling my spouse about my decision to get out of this whole mess so that she won't be too shocked but I feel like that's just looking for attention or something.
I'd feel like a crazy person saying that these ""feelings"" are killing me lol."
AskReddit,fe6y5jq,t3_eo1tip,1578907678.0,"I wondered this for a very long time. I don't have any friends and any acquaintances I make are always purely situational. Turns out I am on the autism / aspergers spectrum, but high functioning. High functioning enough to get by, but low functioning enough to have no way of socialising or connecting with people. I also have a very bland personality and can be quite off-putting."

depression,fe0s0er,t3_endd1q,1578817965.0,"I'm in the same boat. Mildly autistic, just turned 34 don't have a single friend. I don't know how old you are but I can tell you from my experience, it does get better. The desire to be around people and be liked / loved starts to fade and even sexual desire starts to disappear. Once you get to a place where you don't feel like you're missing out on all these connections and experiences then life will be a little easier."

worldnews,fdnmvuf,t1_fdncx9j,1578589107.0,"Depends on the drug I guess. Due to addiction and tolerance levels there are decreasing returns on subsequent hits, so flooding the market may just generate a larger population of addicts. In fact that's kinda happening in the US with it's opioid epidemic. So flooding the market with cheap, weaker drugs may just make the situation worse. Full legalisation is the only reasonable approach. Then potency, supply and purity can be controlled better."
worldnews,fdn700b,t1_fdn10je,1578579014.0,"The difference with drugs is that they can be manufactured synthetically. These animals cannot, so if governments and organizations poured resources into protecting the animals then the profit wouldn't outweigh the risk of death or injury. Poachers just tend to be desperate locals looking for a decent payday. Flooding the market with decent fakes to drive the price down would also help."

OpenVPN,fcnkxd2,t1_fcnh8tf,1577813531.0,Well the one I was looking at does promise 10Gbps up and down so that should be adequate.

OpenVPN,fcngcqz,t1_fcnf9me,1577811141.0,"I'm okay with paying for a VPS provider. They start at about $5 per month and even if I beef it up a little I will still be paying less than I would if I were to pay for a VPN service + a Raspberry PI for the PiHole. 
My only concern is that I don't have any experience with OpenVPN so am a bit fuzzy on the details of setting it up.
I've got it running on my Ubuntu laptop and can connect with clients but the clients aren't getting any internet access.

EDIT: oh and the router I'm getting from a colleague and will be flashing with DD-WRT - I believe that will be able to dial an OpenVPN connection?"

sex,fcn3t3f,t1_fcn2sq2,1577802493.0,"`Do you find yourself distracted or thinking elsewhere during sex? Are you anxious?` A little.
 
`Or depressed? `

Sure

`Are you tired? `

Almost always?


`Is it something done out of seeking a quick release or do you do it when you feel aroused?`

Both but mostly due to arousal.

 `Do you drink or smoke? Use any Marijuana? `

Non smoker and have stopped drinking

`Are you on any ssri or other medications?`

Not at all
` Is there a sense of guilt or shame connected to your sex life in any way? `

Maybe a little - that comes and goes though

sex,fcn0gjk,t1_fcmzpqv,1577799629.0,"Fair point, I've always considered them as essentially the same thing. I've done all the foreplay and exploration and occasional marathon sessions with my partner. Just never felt much from an orgasm / ejaculation."

sex,fcmzkc4,t3_ei1jdk,1577798770.0,"I'm in a similar position to your husband. Years of begging for sex and being turned down has completely destroyed my interest in sex. It's become this chore that I really can't face doing anymore as it just doesn't seem worth the effort.

All I can say is that now it seems that sex is permanently associated as a point of anxiety and frustration and something to be avoided.

It's probably too late for me but it doesn't sound too late for you guys since you say that you're having great sex now.
Keep that up and the negative associations he's built up around sex (ie; feelings of rejection, frustration and anxiety) can be replaced."
depression,fcmvlb1,t3_ei1wpq,1577794312.0,"It sounds like you're pushing him away because you're in a spiral of self loathing.

Try to remember that your depression is an illness and that your moods are a symptom of that. If your partner is putting up with you and loves you then that is his choice and you should respect that choice and try to appreciate him for it.

It sounds like you are in a bad place right now so communicating with your partner will probably be difficult. Try and send him a text message or write a short note saying that you are sorry for your treatment of him and that you don't know how to do better, but that you do love him and value him. 

Be kinder to yourself and you'll find it easier to be kinder to him. Even if your illness is telling you that you don't deserve it."
AskMen,fcmsxes,t1_fcmsdtv,1577790698.0,"If you feel that your setbacks were such that your only accomplishment is staying alive then you can be damn proud that you have got through them. If you are now in a position where you are looking forward - which it seems that you are - then give yourself credit for making it through a difficult time in your life.
I'll be 34 soon and I'm not where I would like to be in life, but at the same time I know I've been trying damn hard to get there. Sometimes we fall short of our expectations, that's not something to be ashamed of, it's just part of life.

Being alone and feeling alone can be awful, but it can also allow you to focus on taking care of yourself and being kind to yourself like you would a partner / loved one."

Only you have lived your life and know what struggles you've had to get where you are and the same goes for everyone else.

Your benchmark for comparison should only be yourself. Try to improve yourself and compare yourself to where you were 1 year or 5 years ago. If you are moving forward then you can be proud of yourself."
AskMen,fcmqng6,t1_fcmq9hk,1577787420.0,"Well there you go. I doubt there is anything wrong with you. Asking someone out requires some level of confidence.

AskMen,fcmq2q2,t3_ei06h1,1577786607.0,Being rejected can be very painful. So if a guy was to ask someone out then they would need at least some sort of indication that the other person is interested too. I don't want to make assumptions about you but it could be that you aren't really communicating with your crushes that you are interested in them.
