AskMen,feyn7pa,t3_eqxgia,1579447869.0,"Cliche answer: Hit the gym.

It's not all about looking hot. It's about feeling comfortable in your own body. That confidence will show and there's nothing more attractive than a confident-ass dude."

AskMen,fdy79wf,t1_fdy5ox3,1578776850.0,"Uh, it's not that weird. If sex is that important for you in the relationship, then it makes sense for you to test your compatibility early.

Edit: I'd like to add that some dudes are very shy during the first sexual encounter. So, don't assume you're not compatible if the first time doesn't go that well."

AskMen,fd4akwi,t3_ek10z4,1578165818.0,I've always been very skinny. So I started to eat a lot more and working out 5 months ago. It's such a confidence booster.

AskMen,fd2d4jc,t3_ejwggk,1578145490.0,"Hm, maybe it's the culture around there? I'm currently living in South America and the dudes usually hang around in their underwear, but never naked."
AskMen,fd2cq79,t3_ejwh7c,1578145324.0,"What's up with the comments? 

If you like this guy, then shoot your shot. Granted, there's a chance that you get rejected, but that's just part of life.

Edit: To really answer your question. I'd be flattered if a girl slid into my DMs."
AskMen,fd23xh4,t3_ejw3ef,1578141296.0,"In my honest opinion, I don't think you should tell her if she lives so far away. 

Now, let's assume she still leaves nearby, the only way you have a shot at not ruining the friendship is to tell her how you feel but play it cool if she rejects your advances. Don't touch the subject again an treat her like a friend. Not going to lie, this is hard, that's why some people prefer to distance themselves from people who rejected them, it's easier to get over them that way."
