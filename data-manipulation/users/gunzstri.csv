college,fdnlky6,t3_em3ppf,1578588345.0,"Seek another position elsewhere. I do feel sorry for you. But when it comes to your job, you have to stay on top of it. The more bad stuff you do at work, the more reason it gives them to fire you. 

Don’t miss shifts at work, don’t be late and have you to stay on top of those emails, even when you are at not at work. 

Even when managers go on vacation, or when they are off duty, they will check their emails."
