changemyview,ffffjpf,t1_ffd85xl,1579882861.0,"You also should consider the economic aspects of having children. It is projected that around 2050, the global population growth will stagnate, and in European nations in particular economic growth may be reversed as a result of underpopulation in many areas.

Green energy is expensive, and it needs a robust economy to survive. The last thing we need is *declining* population to shift our focus from environmental care to supporting a top heavy population, and this requires everyone to reproduce themselves at least."

AskReddit,fff7pxj,t1_ffewufy,1579877811.0,"East Asians countries seem to work decently well in a democratic free market framework, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to name a few. I dont believe so much the ideological difficulty has to do with historical and cultural reasons, as simply the difficulty of transitioning. The transition to communism was difficult and violent for Russia and China. The transition from communism isnt exactly going to be a walk in the park."
changemyview,ffdadvq,t1_ffcr63y,1579816588.0,"This is true. There is a monetary bubble building in the stock market that is not closely correlated to actual economic strength. Its is really only driven by low interest margin, corporate tax cuts driving buybacks, and market confidence. At some point in the next 4 years it will likely short and fall similar to the Dotcom bubble. Sanders is associated with a ""war on Wall Street"", and his proposed policies could prematurely remove general market confidence at the onset of his election, triggering a downturn much sooner than if Trump remained in office. Really, this would be Trump's fault for pushing so much for lower interest rates, but Sanders would definitely get the blame to the detriment of his presidency. 

Either that, or blue-chip companies in large part just hold on to all their buybacks and markets dont dip too much and we all are scared over nothing..."
changemyview,ffcojrv,t1_ff781lb,1579803865.0,"In the chance that Sanders wins the election, I think we could see the backlash leaning towards Congress becoming more Republican controlled, preventing him from pushing a left agenda.

The equilibrium tends toward moderation, and with a swift but massive leftward shift of the executive, the legislative will probably reciprocate rightward, especially considering over the past 40 years, the moderate voter has become increasingly red as the Democratic party has moved left.

Presidents can almost never make good on their big promises for this reason, which we saw with Obama and Reagan."
politics,ffagf9i,t1_ff9pulb,1579735152.0,"He wants Sanders to win the nomination. The economy is on an upswing, unemployment is pretty low, and he wants to shoot socialism for target practice.

His strategy is that moderates will never go for outright socialism, and they especially wont go for it in a strong economy. His goal is the preservation of the status quo by setting up an opponent that seeks to tear down the system, and laughing at how his ushanka isnt screwed on tight enough."

MapPorn,ff9hwna,t1_ff8brct,1579713377.0,"Since their founding they have always had a certain lack of passion, compared with the more zealous mainline church, contributing to their stagnant numbers. Even today they are rather lackadaisical on what they actually believe. They are almost like a catch-all community rather than a Mormon-style church.

The only reason Mormonism grew in the first place was because Joseph Smith was a hardlining firebrand and a dogmatic activist, and there was Brigham young to carry on the legacy, and thats the only business model that's ever worked. His son sucked at it."

Liberal,ff61bl8,t1_fewglkr,1579616600.0,"One way to decrease the cost of education is by restricting the inflow of students as how many European nations do it. America has a lot of diploma mills, and the supply-demand equilibrium is heavy on demand side, driving up prices, exacerbated by the easy and nearly unconditional nature of student loans. In most European nations there is heavier testing that restricts entrance as well as directing education to market needs. Free education in America would not work the way it does in Europe under the proposed methods, and in it's current state would only increase the costs of higher education."
Daytrading,ff3t7rs,t1_ff2wfpj,1579548336.0,"I mean, he has a point, you should be outperforming the percentage gains of indexes like the S&P 500 year per year. 

But it's a dumbass point because of course you should be. If you made 20% of $25,000 daytrading, you'd only have a $5,000 annual increase. And in my opinion you should need a 200-300% increase on that number to be worth it."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fetdnd0,t1_fenzq90,1579374284.0,"It's mostly stuff that wont affect your core gameplay experience.

For instance, they originally overplayed the realism of the game's ecology and physics. They claimed that there were no skyboxes and that the suns were real and the planets orbit around it, and the stars you see in the sky were all real and physical just like in Elite.

They claimed the game had it's own periodic table of elements and the planets were generated based on dictated values from that table, and this dictated the kinds of life, atmosphere, and biosphere you would find on a planet. Instead it's really just ""green slider makes the sky green"".

There is a lot more in that category of things claimed, such as animal herd behavior and certain kinds of animals such as planet-roaming sandworms, that were never implemented.

Again, game is super fun, and most people wont care about this stuff. Personally I'd buy it on a sale tbh or on G2A."
