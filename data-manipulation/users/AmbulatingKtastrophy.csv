traumatoolbox,ffmy7ac,t1_ffk6oqt,1580060145.0,"Same here, it's impossible to get anyone to understand why so many components of my life are missing without instilling doubt in them, or getting in front of that and making them feel like they can't really ""get it"". And the truth is, they can't because it's just that messed up. 

All I can do is hope they ask questions because it's not possible to just ""talk"" about this. (Also means if they start doubting or accusing me I can at least shut that down by saying they asked in the first place.)"

badwomensanatomy,ffj9hc0,t1_ffj4we2,1579993580.0,Withholding information and education from a child is never done from a place of love. It's controlling what they have access to so they can't make up their own minds.
AbuseInterrupted,ffinxiz,t3_es0xc8,1579978408.0,"So you're asking if you put out some red flags of your own, after describing a relationship where there's a million red flags from her; that's what I'll address.

Passive aggression is aggression... it's just a different form of aggression, so it qualifies as abusive behavior. The intent of passive-aggression is to control the other person's behavior/moderate it by some way or other; here it seems like you ""didn't want to rock the boat""--people have to be allowed to react however they will, the only thing we can do is GTFA from them (with the exception of parents with their minor children, because the kids *cannot* get away until it's often too late).

However, if you're always 100% on the money that this person goes nuts when you bring things up, you just have to leave, period. You have identified this person as being abusive. You cannot change them... You not knowing how to leave doesn't excuse your behavior; you don't ""get a pass"" because she was ""more"" hurtful (just like she wouldn't if the roles were reversed). You can only control yourself.

> Especially since I told her I don't want to hear about ex-lovers and she would often bring them up, knowing it made me uncomfortable.

In keeping with above, you definitely get to leave if she makes you uneasy, especially if she's doing it on purpose, that's a huge red flag right there. She can't stop you from that either. And that's what you did. However, she was well within her rights to talk about whatever crap she wanted to talk about... she's just abusive with what she chooses to say.

It seems like maybe you're dwelling on those things because you need to find a way to spot them earlier on and not even waste a day on people like that?"
