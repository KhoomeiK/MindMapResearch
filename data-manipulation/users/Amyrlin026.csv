I'm not suggesting that this is what happened to you, just that your story reminded me of the idea of false memories. It might be interesting to you to look into it and see if there's anyone else who has had similar strange experiences."

offmychest,fetk8vo,t1_feq4szu,1579376280.0,"Alright, I kinda feel like the old hat in the box right now. I've been married for almost 22 years and neither I nor my spouse has ever cheated on one another. We've known each other ever since we were both children. 

We've explored so much of ourselves over these years. I just wanted to give you some insight based upon my own personal experiences. I'll first say that everyone is different. We've got so many different facets to ourselves that to put ourselves in either box A or B would be silly. There is no exactly right way to be that would prevent one person from cheating on another if it's going to happen. If you want to have a better chance at knowing your odds and keeping your spouse's/boyfriend's attentions on you then you, yourself, need to focus your attentions on your spouse/boyfriend and keep honest and open communication flowing. Be their best friend and they should be yours, in turn. Be truthful about your feelings on things and get your spouse's/boyfriend's input. 

Above all else, know who you are marrying (or in a serious relationship with). I knew my husband for years upon years before we settled down and married. He has both a masculine side and a feminine side, as do I. We compliment each other and I think that is the point you are trying to make. It's a really good point, though it is more vast than you are simply putting it.

You don't have to agree with me. Perhaps your ideal marriage or relationship is the type you are pushing toward others to adopt. But, they have their own ideas. What a dull world this would be if we were all the same. 

Good luck to you and all that you choose to do for your own life and relationships."

abusiveparents,fekfifx,t3_eplfkg,1579198965.0,"You're very humble for being so brave. Trying to help your mother understand what she's doing to you is a wonderful step in the right direction and you may be spot on about why things have progressively become worse. Does she have anyone to confide in? A friend she really trusts? I don't live in India so my advice might not be as helpful as I'd hope it could be.

It really should not be your place, as her child, to provide her with help. That's a lot for you to take on and I'd have to imagine you are already dealing with your own stress and problems which is why you've ended up here talking with us. But, if you feel that there's a chance it could help your problems to lessen or go away, you could offer to talk to her and just listen. Let her vent her own heart out and hug it out after. Maybe it would show her what a mature, brave, and wonderful person you are. Maybe she would treat you differently when problems arise and would opt to talk out the issues rather than breaking spatulas in her frustration.

If she's open to it, you both could benefit from this and strengthen your relationship beyond anything it has ever been. I wish you the best of luck and if you want to talk more, I'm open to listening."

abusiveparents,fdga1h0,t1_fdet00u,1578386569.0,"It sounds like you're already on the right track by seeking help with this issue. My only advice would be to take time for yourself when you're feeling the anger arise. Talk with your girlfriend ahead of time, when you're calm, and explain that you don't want to lash out at her when your blood starts to boil so it would be better for the both of you that she give you some space and time to calm down rather than possibly exasperbate the situation by trying to talk it out or trying to calm you down herself. 

In other words, when the going gets tough, it's okay to walk away for a little while until things have settled again and the idea of talking seems more reasonable. Do something that actively calms you down (if you can).  Time can be your best friend.

Other than that, keep pushing for help from your doctors. With these kind of issues, there is often a trail-and-error approach to finding what works best. Once you do find it, stick with it... religiously.

Good luck!"
