I don't believe it is a misrepresentation.

Ex: firearms, climate change, inequality, unemployment, free college.

France had a wealth tax from ~1982->2017. Most estimates of it's value hover around 1% of the tax revenues for the country but cost them ~10,000 wealthy tax payers. Many of their exiting millionaires moved to neighboring EU countries where they could still do business in France if required. We can mirror this with the passage of the USMCA, where people could move to Canada or Mexico and still do business in the US without giving up 2-6% of their wealth every year.

A VAT is inevitable as all the paper trails are automated by computers to allow people over a certain threshold to completely avoid taxable events.
