Documentaries,ff8k2ty,t1_ff8j83f,1579682210.0,"Actually, I think Luanda is one of the most expensive cities in the world, in a country where people starve."
Documentaries,ff8i6xg,t1_ff8gmco,1579679617.0,Didn't she use to take a private jet to go shopping in Brazil and then come right back to Angola too?
askscience,ff3jx99,t1_ff395ur,1579542630.0,Yeah! *laughs in 230V*
science,ff2jkhv,t1_ff2it4u,1579509045.0,"Well, thats my point then. Anything necessary should be paid for all at the risk of a lot of people not having it for no fault of theirs. All that is accessory should be paid individually by those who seek it.
It's not like health insurance is like auto insurance, people can't shop around for the best deal or put it off until they can afford it."
science,ff2hc4h,t1_ff1b2o8,1579506151.0,"You have to pay every time you use a road?
Where I live we only have to pay for highways, which are always optional."
science,fex34xj,t1_feuyaby,1579423524.0,"Because you need an healthy workforce in the next generation too?

Why did society pay for your roads? Or your army? Or for teachers, etc? 

  
Cooperation is what made humans thrive, not individuality. Were it not for taxpayer money spent on reasearch (who many like you said was completely pointless and theoretical) we wouldn't have the quantum particle physics knowledge that allowed for modern computing, which means no internet, no modern processores, no cellphones or modern medicine, automation, etc."
science,fex26r6,t1_fevlzp8,1579423100.0,"By that standard you should also build your own roads, how dare people feel entitled to the tarmac paid for with other people's money. 

In case you haven't thought of it, without a new generation a country wouldn't be able to function in the future.

That's not how a society works."
todayilearned,fek6v23,t1_fek5e0y,1579193839.0,"Yeah, I feel you, it's not like a good part of all the money I pay in taxes isn't mis-managed or goes to someone's pockets (I live in southern Europe, well known for corruption). However, I believe you can't be a good person and not having your heart broken when you see videos and such of people being badly hurt and yelling for other people not to call an ambulance because they can't afford it. Or being completely fucked because of a chronic illness they have no fault of or control over.
It would be a humongous job to make it work, but it'd make everything so much cheaper that it would probably outset the mismanagement of funds. Also, American ingenuity right? You put a man on the moon with not that much money (it was a tiny percentage of your GDP, much less than what you spend in any given year with your army) so if people backed it I am certain the us could pull it off."
todayilearned,fek439t,t1_fek2sow,1579192182.0,"I do, being an healthy person who pays all required taxes but rarely needs medical assistance, in a country with universal healthcare. 
Also, that's a logical phallacy, that's like saying if you like trump's wall idea you have to go down to the border and start building it yourself."
tifu,fej81f2,t1_feitnkb,1579160845.0,"Well, if those countries have an exceptionally high rate of rape and murder, yeah, sure I could. 
In regards to this, if you listen to Brazilian stand up comedians is one of the most joked about themes, they don't seem to be feeling as sorry for themselves or dehumanised as you do."
todayilearned,fei2lud,t1_fehvou1,1579128910.0,"I mean, the infrastructure and service seems great if you can afford it, but I honestly feel saddened for people who need health care and can't get it because of reasons they can't control, and that is why it angers me a little when I see people defend the undefensable, specially when it's their countrymen suffering for it.
For all the patriotism Americans show, they seem to give no fucks about the country sometimes."
todayilearned,fehu5go,t1_fehsmdb,1579123924.0,"Well, flawed as they may be it still beats the clusterfuck that is the us healthcare system."
todayilearned,fehkrix,t1_fehk36l,1579118543.0,"Yep, all developed countries but the USA are wrong, it's much cheaper for each person to pay individually. Also, service and goods providers, and specially big pharmaceutical companies will sell you stuff much cheaper if you buy in small quantities and on a single-hospital or single-network basis, with no negotiating power. That's why everything medical is so much cheaper in the USA than all the countries with universal healthcare."
tifu,fegt13r,t1_fegnt89,1579101868.0,"Well, if we go down that road there isn't really much we can be humorous about.
Do you really think people's opinions are that altered by jokes? Maybe not enough people made fun of trump then. 
People will object to anything, doesn't mean they're right. Many people objected the end of slavery or freedom for jews in europe. I can be offended by equal rights for women, doesn't mean others should stop making fun of mysoginy.
It was but a jest, I don't think my it's my reddit comments holding brazil back."
AskReddit,fegln5y,t3_eoyn3a,1579096572.0,I hear heroine is pretty good
tifu,feghoxp,t1_fegglvs,1579093096.0,"Didn't mean to annoy anyone but I won't censor myself because of some particular people not being able to understand reality. Fear mongering seems to be prevalent in the us, regardless of what types of cliches people make fun with. 
Also, para mim os brasileiros nem são bem estrangeiros, partilhamos tanta cultura e hábitos, além da língua, que não sinto a mesma distância que sinto com povos de outros países.
Só desejo o bem para o Brasil e para os brasileiros!"
tifu,fegezhm,t1_fegd19u,1579090482.0,"Well, it was indeed an easy joke, based on a cliché that has some truth behind it. Kinda loses power when you dissect it.
I am sorry this joke was not engineered to German standards!"
tifu,fegeqo0,t1_fegec5b,1579090224.0,"Well, the many Brazilians that migrated here that I know disagree. 
Can you walk around at night with a cellphone in your hand or withdraw money from an atm in the middle of the street without worrying?
Also, it's a joke, I don't take offense when Brazilians make jokes about Portuguese people being dumb or women having mustaches."
tifu,fegapvo,t1_feg971g,1579085248.0,"Well, duh, but if we can't exaggerate a little bit how can we make jokes? Most comedy is reductio ad absurdum. It was a joke.
Also, Brazil is one of the murder/violent crime capitals of the world, if I can't make this joke about Brazil, about what country can I?"
TwoXChromosomes,feg5vym,t1_fef2ix4,1579078395.0,"Yeah, I have the same problem, my wife goes on awfully long tirades to tell a simple story or happening and most of the time I end up unconsciously filtering her voice out, and it's not because I don't value what she says or thinks, it's just because my attention starts shifting to something else without me even noticing.
But she does the same if I'm talking about something technical or that doesn't peak her interest like my hobbies or work, I think fundamentally men and women have different interests and ways of seeing the world."
tifu,feg5eyj,t1_fefwjdo,1579077747.0,Safe home in Brazil might be pushing it mate

AskReddit,fdrbkxv,t1_fdr5ztp,1578682101.0,"Ah, you are a woman, my wife also has a pair (limited edition with references to typical Portuguese tiles), and they are also sturdy and all sewn, but I cannot avail for their durability as she doesn't wear them often. I think the more fashionable wear they make is not intended to be that reliable unfortunately."
AskReddit,fdqzxrm,t1_fdqs5az,1578677654.0,"Might be, I have these bad bois and do not have a single complaint, besides the fact I have to treat them every now and then if I have want them to keep looking new https://www.timberlandonsale.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/t/i/tim_031.jpg"
AskReddit,fdqrs4d,t1_fdqrbja,1578673488.0,"Well, in terms of footwear I only have one pair of their boots and one pair of shoes, both have about 2 years now and are still in tip top condition, with normal wear and tear (I haven't used the shoes much though). They also had warranty, which was a first for me, could've been bad luck, I don't know. I also have a jacket which I use a lot and is also in great condition.
Where they sewn or glued? If they were sewn a cobbler can restore the sole perfectly."
AskReddit,fdqe35m,t3_emqd57,1578664250.0,"Carhart and Timberland, expensive products but all items I have have been super well made and extremely durable."
todayilearned,fcxai5y,t1_fcx5tgt,1578057390.0,"Yeah, I can understand that, but I've always been against translating names as a rule, you could write it without the tilde (the name of that little wave).
Here in Portugal the media used to translate the names of the English royal family and I always thought it was bizarre to call William Prince Guilherme  lol"
portugal,fcxa89p,t1_fcx6fr8,1578057127.0,"Então não está melhor, está é separado por um muro de betão. Neste momento entre Coimbra e Viseu tens mais zonas com uma faixa que duas, e com alcatrão todo fodido, rico Itinerário Principal, com imensas zonas de 60 kmh..."

todayilearned,fcx42mt,t1_fcwz2rc,1578050330.0,"I suppose history classes always favour your own people. In Portugal no one calls it that, I couldn't even remember that name, only Fernão de Magalhães (which was his name, i don't know why everyone translates it).

On the other hand, I will never forget Portugal's dismissal of Colombo's plans to travel to India because we already had a travel route around Africa."
AskReddit,fcw74kl,t1_fcvowqr,1578018676.0,"El catalan para mi es muy raro y solo comprendo un poco, como con el italiano. Esa frase fue simples pero si fuera complexa no entenderia nada.
No es que seham malas, solo enfatizamos una unica silaba en cada palabra, y eso hace que todas las otras vogales y consonantes seham ""comidas"", se llama un idioma stress-timed. Todas los otros idiomas latinos (y el portugues brasileno) no son stress timed, se da el mismo tiempo a todas las silabas. Nadie entende los portugueses, solo las ex-colonias, y mismo los brasilenos pasan mal ententando de comprendernos lol"
AskReddit,fcvonrs,t1_fcvnzxs,1578006641.0,"Si, lo conozco, solo estava confuso porque vine murió, no?
El que es raro para mim en castellano es la utilización del doble ? y !, es muy raro y tampoco existe en otros idiomas.

Agora em português:

Se segues galegos no twitter, de certeza que percebes português escrito, certo?
O que verdadeiramente separa os portugueses do espanhóis é a pronunciação dos sons (sonidos), os nossos idiomas são mesmo muito parecidos!"
AskReddit,fcvnr8q,t1_fcvcpf2,1578006071.0,"Ah si, claro, gallego es portugues con acento! Y si, el verbo es igual, seguir - sigo. No conosco el tio, quando dices viner hablas de que plataforma? Ainda existen vines?
Si los espanoles san nuestros primos, los gallegos san hermanos, estuve en galicia una vez y quando me hablavan en gallego no podia creer que no era solo portugues hablado con acento espanol!"

AskReddit,fcv9ppz,t1_fcv7w80,1577997574.0,"Yeah, a lot do, obviously the more educated the people are the more common it is, and not as much as younger people. Having everything subtitled on TV instead of dubbed helps a lot, some of my older relatives who had absolutely no schooling in the language still manage to understand a lot, even if they can only speak a couple of words."
AskReddit,fcv7d25,t1_fcv3wa6,1577996166.0,"Well, in Portugal we had a fascist dictatorship until 74 and we speak English pretty well, I don't think it has anything to do with the isolationism of former governments..."
TwoXChromosomes,fbybiva,t3_eezw0g,1577212780.0,"Well, lazy as it might be, I genuinely know women who had long mourning periods in their life due to being unable to have kids and it was tragic for them so I don't think it's that improbable that some women genuinely feel it's like the greatest curse they bare."
