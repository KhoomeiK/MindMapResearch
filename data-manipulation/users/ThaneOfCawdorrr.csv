2. If you really can't do that for whatever reason.  Here is some advice.  ((And please, just google ""mother dog not feeding newborn puppies"") 

Keep the pups warm with blankets and towels and hand feed them yourself by [bottle feeding](https://breedingbusiness.com/bottle-feeding-puppies/) or [syringe feeding](https://breedingbusiness.com/tube-feeding-supplies-for-puppies/) until further notice. 

You may want to **try relocating the** [**whelping box**](https://breedingbusiness.com/whelping-box-tips/) so that it is in a calm, quiet (and clean) environment where the dam can care for her litter in peace. If she is more relaxed she may be more likely to release the right hormones she needs to build bonds with her litter. If your dog is particularly attached to you, you might also find that your presence helps her to feel more at ease. If this is the case, try relocating the whelping box to somewhere that you spend most of your time, so the mother dog can be near you as often as possible. This way, you will also be alerted much more quickly to any distress from either the mother dog or

If you think the mother dog is rejecting her pups because she is excessively tired or overwhelmed, you should be prepared to aid her in her care wherever possible. Bonding relies on hormones which are usually stimulated during [labor](https://breedingbusiness.com/dog-pregnancy/), but also during nursing. If the pup(s) do not automatically latch on to the teat you can **try introducing them yourself** — **get your dog to lie on her side and place her pup(s) near her tummy, with their mouths positioned as close to her teats as possible. You may require an extra set of hands to do this so that one person can focus on the litter and the other can soothe the mother dog.** Ensure that any help you enlist is from a person that your dam knows and trusts, as not to cause her any added [stress or anxiety](https://breedingbusiness.com/dog-anxiety/). If the dog exhibits any aggression during this process, immediately remove the puppies from the situation.

If you suspect that your dog is unwell and this is the cause of the rejection, seek immediate medical advice from a vet. Infections such as mastitis and metritis require **antibiotic treatment** and can be life-threatening if left to progress — pup(s) should also never take milk from their infected mother. The best thing you can do for a new dog mother and her litter is to stay with them as much as possible to support them and look out for any concerning changes — **your observations could save more than one life!**"

NoStupidQuestions,ffeo3f5,t3_et6mos,1579856810.0,"You are not quite using commas correctly.  Generally, you use them after an adverb that modifies a phrase, when you complete a phrase that doesn't quite stand on its own, or if you have a parenthetical thought (an aside).  But once you have a complete thought, you need a period, not a comma.   If you have two sentences that are closely related, you use a semi-colon.    You are also slightly overwriting, which makes your writing hard to read.  If this is helpful, here's your post, with corrections in superscript. 

Sometimes,^((you would put a comma here)) when my friends look at my writing, they'll comment on how many commas I use.  ^((you don't need the word ""however""))   As far as I know, I'm using them correctly. When I was being taught how to use commas throughout primary school, the teachers always said to use commas at points when you would typically briefly pause during speech.^((This is the end of a complete thought, and so, you put a period and end the sentence; otherwise, it's  run on sentence.))  That's not the only rule I follow when using commas ^((again, this is a complete thought, but the next thought is so connected, that you'd use a semicolon rather than a period)); I also use them after some conjunctions, like ""however."" ^(Now your sentence is getting too long, so you start a new sentence.)   I might also use a comma when I'm adding extra information, like I'm doing right now. ^(Again, this is turning into a run on sentence, so start a new sentence to be more clear)   I'm sure there are more rules too.  

Often, when I'm writing informally, I'll make a concerted effort to use fewer commas, just so it seems more natural and fitting to the casual context. ^(This is the end of your thought.  put a period and end the sentence.)  Even if it seems grammatically incorrect to not use the comma, ^(this is only a dependent clause, so you need to follow it with a full sentence,)  I might use one to clarify. ^(This is the end of the thought, so put a period, full stop, end of sentence.)

The problem is you aren't using commas correctly.  You're using commas where you should use periods or semicolons.  You have run on sentences and incomplete thoughts.   You also use unnecessary words, like ""however"" and ""oftentimes"" and so forth, which also makes your writing hard to follow.   And if it ""seems"" grammatically incorrect, it is.   Here's how it would read more clearly:

Their repair contract was so good you could, and would, buy it on non-Sears appliances as I recall.

Then at a certain point, it turned into  some incompetent, ill-trained guy coming out, and they didn't really know what was wrong, but they'd tell you to order a part, and it would take two weeks to order the part and you had to order it yourself, and you couldn't re-schedule the return appointment until you had received the part, and that would take another two weeks?   So you'd be without your fridge or washing machine for a month?   I remember at that point I just hired a local appliance repairman, he came out, identified the problem, fixed it, and that was that.   No more Sears for me.

She served as a Senator for 8 years.  She was a brilliant Secretary of State.  She knows more about complex geopolitics than literally anyone in public life today.  

Putin knew it, and that's why he deployed his most sophisticated cyberarmy to undermine her.    (It's also why he made contributions, via the GOP, the NRA, and his troll army, to Bernie, and why that is STILL going on, and why dudes like this STILL post shit like this.)  

And for those who are still Bernie stans, HE lost by millions of votes TO HILLARY, so that would suggest that he would have lost even MORE brutally to the ""senile game host""---and it's obvious to literally anyone with the ability to read and understand that Trump is the useful idiot, the person Hillary lost to was Putin, a murderously powerful global crime syndicate, corrupt GOP, Voter suppression, interfered-with voting machines, a troll army, and literal interference with the election--and she STILL won the popular vote by 3 million votes.   

She ISN'T ""family friends with a known sex trafficker,"" her husband ISN'T a sex criminal.    Even defining her by the men she knows is such misogynist bullshit.   

She's a profoundly respected, smart, tough, brilliant, accomplished stateswoman, who faces daily shit and lies and smear and absurd attacks like this, and has an ample army of American misogynists who eagerly go along with it--no matter how many times she's been exonerated, over and over and over and over.   

And no matter how much she's been 100% right in the past, and is right here, as well.  She KNOWS.  She served in the SENATE with Bernie the Pretender.   This isn't a ""murder,"" it's the same tired bullshit."

I was going from the way you wrote it.  The previous ""federal agency"" you had referred to was the EEOC.   It wasn't clear in your writing.  It's amazing that when someone tries to clean up your writing so people can understand the story (after commenter after commenter found your writing impossible to follow), you respond by calling them a moron and insult them coarsely.

""My son, who is white, had a government job he liked, working for ""Wendy,"" who is black.  My son created a computer app that allowed Wendy more ability to supervise her employees.

Using the app, Wendy discovered that her employee ""Mina,"" who is also black, was committing theft.   As a result, Mina's boss, also black, revoked some of her work privileges.

Mina then discovered that Wendy had discovered her activities because she was using my son's app, and she went to ""Charlene"" (also black), who worked for a different department.

Charlene accused my son of racism.   She then manipulated my son to work for HER, pretending they needed him to design a similar program.   Once she had him under her supervision, she and her co workers harassed him and he ultimately lost his job.   

He filed an EEOC complaint, and although Charlene lied in her statement, and the EEOC initially declined to pursue it, my son got the FBI involved!   And in the end, Charlene was censured and fired, as well as being charged with felonies for her perjury."""

Here in L.A. we actually have part of the city that's zoned for horse owners, and people simply own horses with areas for them to run, take them to our enormous park, Griffith Park, and ride the horse trails.   We have a number of equestrian centers.   And just outside of LA is complete farm and ranch country, with lots of horses there.   Again it doesn't seem like it's just racing vs. food or even vs. pony rides (which I agree, seems like a really sad life).    Maybe I'm bringing a Western perspective.
