But yes the team looks much better but FMF has hilariously botched the coaching situation. It's like getting all the best ingredients and then getting a shit chef.

Now, time to get destroyed by the USWNT, and for me to get drunk off tequila afterwards.

Personally we should go with Vergara. After years of Cuellar it's time to have a female HC, and the youth programs are kicking ass."
LigaMX,fgne4xa,t1_fgmqco1,1580942939.0,Lol it was waaaaaay worse in the 70s. Mexicans used to reproduce like rabbits.

But trust me the very top is a shitshow. Same shitty coach for decades. The golden days of Maribel seem like a drunken nostalgia.
