These diseases at first will only affect that animal species, but somewhere along the line, a strain will mutate that can jump between species. Since your body has never seen this disease before, it has no built in immunity against it, making it very dangerous. So in a way it did just pop into existence, but not in the way you are thinking."

AmItheAsshole,ff1wnnp,t3_er5yta,1579487873.0,"NTA, but you really might want to look into alternative career paths if your dream career won’t work out. Just because you are passionate about something doesn’t mean you’ll be able to find a job, especially if you are locked into a specific area. That said, going to college is a good plan. You can protect your boyfriend from your student debt with a prenup. Student loans do make getting a house more complicated, but making more than minimum wage will more than balance that out. I’d sit down with your bf and see if you two can hash his fears out some. If he’s still 100% against you going to college, then you’ll have to decide what is more important to you."

TooAfraidToAsk,fezqn57,t1_feyqtna,1579460423.0,"I think you are confusing two types of women. Most women will tell you that they don’t want to date you, would prefer to stay friends, or heavily imply it in hopes of you not trying to push things. Sometimes they don’t want to come right out and say “I’m not interested in you that way,” because they worry about hurting your feelings or making you mad, which is why they will be more subtle in hinting they don’t want more. 

There is another (and I would guess much, much smaller) group of women who get off on getting attention. They don’t want to date you for one reason or another, but being chased after makes them feel special, wanted, and/or important. It’s important to realize not all women fall into this second group. Most women who don’t want to date you also don’t want to lead you on."

She can't have secrets? She can't work through something without you?

AmItheAsshole,fenub1h,t3_epzmid,1579290855.0,"NTA, but I wonder if there is something going on with your friend. Are you sure she's not suffering from postnatal depression? She keeps changing what she can and wants to do. She can't be away from her baby for a day? She can't let her parents handle the child if it cries during the ceremony? Why can't her husband get off of work for one day? There seems to be a lot going on with your friend, and I feel for her, but you can't plan your wedding around her family. Start making plans and keeping them. If she can make them, great. If not, then tell her you understand and she will be missed. You can't keep rescheduling things on your husband, parents, in laws, the rest of the bridal party, and everyone else you are inviting."

While it should be understood that your room is off limits, talking to your roommate is a good idea. You two can discuss if you should put a lock on your door or just a sign that says to keep out. Better to talk about it now then to have a problem about it later."

I personally respect guys more when they just act as who they are instead of putting on a show of masculinity.

Yeah, there’s the daily grind, but I’m kinda surprised you aren’t already feeling that at 20. Also, it does take more effort to hang out with friends, but the ones that stick around a so much better. Less drama. No one has time for that."
Awwducational,fef794i,t3_eoqulm,1579049841.0,"There is a way to have a male calico cat that can have kids. There is a Texas cat, Dawntreader Texas Calboy, who is a male calico cat who has sired several litters of kittens. 

Explanation: like some have mentioned, most calico males have klinefelters syndrome. That’s because you have the genes for black fur and orange fur on the X chromosome (we are ignoring white fur cause genes get very complicated very fast). So the X chromosome can have the orange gene or the black gene, not both. So to have black fur and orange fur you need two X chromosomes, one with each type of color. So female cats can be calicos since they have two X chromosomes, and klinefelter males also have two X chromosomes (xxy).

Now for how you can have a fertile male calico: you get a chimera cat. There is a condition that happens occasionally to developing embryos. If the mother has more than more child, early on the two embryos can fuse two create one child. So you have one being with two sets of dna. This can happen to animals and humans. Chimeras seem completely normal, and you can usually only tell with a dna test. It’s not like they have two personalities or anything, just two sets of dna. So some cells have one set, and some have the other. So Calboy has some cells with the orange gene and some cells had the black gene. 

Hope someone found this interesting."

She said she’d cover the cost and it would just be a fun day out. I did not want a traditional wedding dress. I don’t think Dave and bridal or whatever would have something I’d want. Also if I did get something there, I’d have to drive another six hours there to try it on when it came in? What if there was a problem. The whole thing was a nope for me. I started to get really mad when she kept pushing me to get a dress with her. An offer for a free dress is nice, but that doesn’t mean that it’s what she wants."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdtrm92,t3_en1gvk,1578721114.0,"A lot of people have mentioned consent (which is by far the most important thing), but another difference is pleasure. Both parties are enjoying what’s going on. Also, planning and aftercare. Usually people who participate in bdsm will find out their boundaries, plan a scene, establish safe words, and after the scene is over they will perform aftercare so both parties can calm down after an intense event. I know they are super long, but there is a YouTuber call “the dom” who reviewed the 50 shades of grey books and movies. They are long watches, but pretty entertaining. I mention this, because if you want a good breakdown on what is abuse vs bdsm, he breaks a lot of that down in those reviews.

TooAfraidToAsk,fdtqsll,t3_en34cx,1578720753.0,So... what’s your question?
TooAfraidToAsk,fdr9tig,t3_emu5hh,1578681527.0,"Ok so I’m a vegan in the US. I went vegan because I didn’t like the way the animal industry here is being run. Most factory farming (including egg and dairy farms) are very cruel to the animals they keep. In order to make enough milk and eggs to fulfill demands, the animals are kept in very substandard living conditions are just aren’t treated well. That means I have no problem with eggs or milk raised on small farms where the cows can be cows and the chickens can be chickens. I still don’t personally consume them, because it’s been almost a decade and I’m just not used to eating them anymore. 

I also know some people who go vegan for health reasons. Cutting out animal products cuts out a big portion of the fat and cholesterol you consume. 

Some vegans I know do it for environmental reasons. Factory farms take up a lot of land and energy and produce a ton of waste. 

Some go vegan because they believe animals should not be messed with. Eggs are meant to be hatched and milk is made for baby cows, not humans. These are usually the ones that can get a bit weird. I sort of understand what they are saying, but we live in an ecosystem so interaction between animals is pretty normal. 

Some go vegan (or vegetarian) for religious reasons. Buddhists are a good example. Also those who follow kosher or halal sometimes go vegan cause it’s easier to get food they eat. Simpler rules. 

As far as honey goes, that’s always been a weird one for me. Some people argued that the way honey was collected was cruel to the bees or that beekeepers would destroy other hives, killing off much needed pollinators. Idk, I still eat honey and I consider myself vegan. I know some would say I’m not vegan cause of it but whatever. I have to live my life. 

Now as far as bacteria and fungus goes, they don’t really have brains or nervous systems like we know it. It’s much easier to eat them or things they make, cause we really aren’t hurting an animal. Bacteria are everywhere, including your gut, it’s hard to avoid them. Also at some point, we vegans have to eat something. It’s about reducing harm, even if you can’t avoid it completely. 

I hope this helps."

Yes both are mad, but you know there is a difference. Complex words can sometimes help convey these slight differences. Also sometimes they are more precise in what they mean, and sometimes you can use one complex word to replace a bunch of easier words, making your writing more condensed. There’s also a feeling a flow to words. Why did they chose this word over another? Does it help set a mood? Does it give the writing a rhythm? Alliteration?
