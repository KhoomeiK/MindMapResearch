googlesheets,ffwtx5a,t3_evjvf5,1580310912.0,"I have three spreadsheets (Executive, Manager, and Base) that I share information between. For me, the best way to marshall and share the data was to have a sheet called INPUTS! where I would gather the data required to be sent to other sheets.

&#x200B;

For example, the Executive sheet has the EMPLOYEE! spreadsheet that contains a list of all employees (active and inactive). The Manager and Base spreadsheets need to know what employees are active for certain drop downs, so what I'll for is on (EXECUTIVE)INPUTS! I will filter out all active employees (Let's say to Column B). Then on my Manager and Base spreadsheet when I need the employee list I will just IMPORTRANGE the column B of information I need from (EXECUTIVE)INPUTS!. The nice thing about this setup is that if you break something, it's generally localized to that one workbook and you don't need to go fix it in others as they only get pointed to the INPUT! and not the specific EMPLOYEE! page.... This is just one example in my three spreadsheets, there are many others. I.e. I send active inventory from a Google Forms linked sheet in the Manager Sheet to both the Executive and Base.

&#x200B;

I further save myself some time by adding the share keys of the other spreadsheets to column A of each INPUTS! sheet. This way I can just reference the cell as needed in my IMPORTRANGE function.... I hope this wasn't too confusing! Let me know if you'd like further help.

An example of one of my equations...

1. You could certainly talk to Skoda. I have no experience in regards to them as a manufacturer, but other mainstream manufacturers do have a ""Goodwill period"" for things like this, where the warranty just ended (I'm not sure if it has, again, I don't know Skodas). If approaching a manufacturer, hard-given demands are most likely to be met with a ""No""... You catch more with honey than you do vinegar. Definitely worth a shot though!
2. On a vehicle like this, I would not recommend a new engine.
3. I would think that this would be your best bet, especially if you can find a low KM engine. Most used engines will come with some sort of short-term warranty as well.

One note I would make is the €400 diagnostic/inspection fee.... that seems high. What's the shop's hourly rate? As I don't know, even at €100/hr, you don't need 4 hours to determine the engine needs to be replaced."

The warranty is a contract with a clear beginning and end; unfortunately, you are just on the other side of the end.

""Can I talk to someone else to get the dealership/GM to be partly responsible for the repairs?""If you had previously set up \[i.e. were you previously a customer before your vehicle was towed in?\] a relationship at a GM dealership, they may go to bat for you by going in front of the manufacturer and pleading your case for a goodwill repair/assistance, but if you haven't, it really just sounds like ""I'm not a great, good, or even a basic customer of your shop, but you need to help me with this!"".

""This is just crazy. I have a $12,000 piece of scrap metal at this point.""Yep, crazy, but there are ways to protect against this like extended warranties.

Remember, a mechanical breakdown is a possibility that you need to think about when purchasing; not just sticker price!

It could be they misdiagnosed or that there is more than one issue here, but either way the ""it will take time to go out"" was either a lie or incompetence; both reasons to find a 2nd opinion. Why? After replacement they would have cleared fault codes and saw that one returned immediately. It's at this point they should have said ""we installed it, it fixed ___ code but we still have ____ so you need _____"". The fact the clock spring didn't fix it isn't a sign it's a bad shop, because without a crystal ball you cannot guarantee a part will fix something electrical until you try.

I think they did a quick scan for codes and whatever code was active probably had a recommended diagnosis of ""test clock spring first"" so they just jumped at replacement hoping it would fix it."
