AskReddit,ff4rm3s,t3_erhu3x,1579570770.0,"I keep having this reoccurring dream that myself, friends and family all live in NYC and lead today different lives. Reoccurring though in the sense that its the same location and all, but it always progresses forward in time parallel to my real life. It's as if myself and everyone I'm close to live separate lives in this dream world that seems WAY more interesting and action packed than my real life. For some perspective I live in South Georgia and have for the majority of my life (since 3 and I'm 34 now). In these dreams we are always doing some crazy shit in the streets like racing, having a block party, etc. One time my friends and I robbed a HUGE bank with golden pillars and walls. On multiple occasions we are visited by aliens, sometimes scary sometimes seemingly friendly. 

Watching Inception I always feel an understanding to the shared dream state because it feels like that to me Everytime I have those dreams. Like I'm in that basement with all of those people jacked in living their real lives in a dream state. Always feels so real and leaves me wondering/longing to go back after its over. 

My other dreams that reoccur from time to time... Not so much. Don't care to go back to sleep into another form of the apocalypse. Everytime I dream it it's different. One time my whole family was on a beach and a tsunami came in like 100m high wall of water. Another time I was running to the top of a skyscraper to get a view of the fiery inferno that was in engulfing the city. Another one was, you guessed it alien invasion, and so on and on. Always different, always super clear and real feeling."
