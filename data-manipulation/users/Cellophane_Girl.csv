That was my first thought too ""people can't afford these things but the cat gets one?"". Animals deserve treatment too though and if a cgm works on them then I can see why they are being utilized to figure out what insulin dose is needed for them. I imagine it's of great relief to the vet to be able to use them to figure out insulin doses and lessen the chance that they will kill somone's pet with too large of a dose of insulin.   
Those things don't lessen the fact that people need these devices and can't afford them though and that is upsetting, I agree."

You can't really order them directly though, so you'd have to go through a furniture store in your area, they have a couple of the cabinets on amazon, but I wouldn't recommend ordering it off there as if anything is wrong you can't just get an extra part sent since they don't sell to consumers directly. I had that issues with the display case I ordered from amazon and so ended up having to send the whole thing back. Called up a local furniture company and gave them the product number and had them order it for me and deliver it to my apartment. Ended up being much easier in the long run as the case had been a pain in the ass to try to put together and it didn't cost me any more to order through them and have it assembled (I paid for delivery but I could have picked it up and paid the same I had paid for it on amazon).

vinyltoys,ffjciy5,t1_ffjads7,1579995415.0,"Thanks! I have pieces all over the place as well. It was really fun setting up the display case and took me several hours of switching stuff around until I was happy with the whole thing.  I've got most of my blind box figures on a small book shelf on top of  my desk, but I'm thinking about putting them on the wall. I saw someone here had gotten 2x2's and mounted them straight to the wall and I really liked the look of that. So I think that will be something I'll do at some point. I have an enamel pin collection that I recently purchased small corkboards to display them on the wall (the one's I'm not currently using to decorate the bag I carry around).  It's a lot of fun trying to figure out what will go where and how to display it. Not so much fun to dust a lot of small figures though, but I really do enjoy having them everywhere instead of all of them in display cases. 

The Yuko is a great piece! I don't really know a lot about vinyl figures other than I like them and I buy what I like and can afford, but the Yuko seems well made to me and a very nice piece in person. Everything in the case is a nice piece really. I don't think I have any pieces that I have complaints about other than some blind box figures that have tiny pieces that don't want to go well into their holes as that's a pain in the ass to deal with. 

I totally agree that setting up how to display things is very personal. I just am interested in how other people decide what to display together and why. I think it's interesting. I think most of the time it's just a feeling more than anything. ""this would look cool here"".  My partner has 2 display cases of figures and he tends to group things together by what they are since a lot of what he has collected over the years are figures of a specific character or from a specific series (optimus prime has 2 shelves almost completely to himself), and of course a shelf or two with what his mom refers to as his ""booby girl statues"".  I put a Quiccs Hello Kitty on top of my PC because I got a new case that was white and I thought it matched well, then I later gave HK a ""pet"" xenomorph pikachu.  My collection is so varied that I can have a hard time figuring out what looks good together but I enjoy figuring it out. It's a bit like meditation to rearrange things."
vinyltoys,ffj57oy,t3_etxh1e,1579990703.0,"How do you guys decide what to put where? I have some figures scattered around my apartment and I sort of just put them where I think they will look good (obviously), but with a display case it's different. Sometimes it's easy since they are the same artist or line, but for everything else, do you guys have any methods you like to decide what you want to display together? Or do you just go with gut feeling?"
vinyltoys,ffj4xi7,t3_etxh1e,1579990496.0,"Bottom shelf is a ""video game"" theme. I see colors doesn't really fit the theme but I explained it to myself as ""when you see a visually stunning video game"" work enough for now.  It's the loosest association really. I just wanted the Quiccs NES Destroyer next to the maneki-dino and the shelf just evolved from there.

Top shelf is just grouped by color for the most part. The bearly-dead figure is where it is because it breaks up the colors and because I wasn't sure where else to put it. Plus risers on that shelf, have a few more small figures I'll probably put in there for now on that shelf so it won't stay quite so separated by color."

I've had a few internet friends for over 20 years. They aren't ""internet friends"", they are very real friends who I just happen to have never had the chance to meet in person. We have shared laughter and tears, through good times and bad they have been there for me. I don't have any ""in person"" friendships that have lasted that long. I am so very grateful to the internet for bringing these amazing people into my life."
awfuleverything,fffydrb,t1_fffa1wf,1579894504.0,"Exactly. I remember when I was in middle school some friends and I gathered up random things to light on fire to see if they were flammable/would melt because one of us had gotten their hands on a lighter. I remember trying to melt the hair on a troll doll, and I think it was just all random small stuff like that. No flammable liquids thankfully, but we had just collected everything and were burning stuff in the woods. I'm sure if we had had tiny little computers/cameras in our pockets we would have been recording it and posting it online.  

Kids do a lot of stuff that adults consider stupid, but that's how you learn about the world in general. Humans are naturally curious creatures and I'm sure even the greatest minds that ever were did ""dumb"" things when they were young, the internet just didn't exist to document all the experimentation.  That's really the difference. We are in fairly new territory here and kids are going to be kids always.

Cringetopia,ffe438n,t1_ffe2ykz,1579836171.0,"I have been in ""crisis"" psychiatric hospitals many many times, usually just 3 to 7 days at a time, because I have bipolar and sometimes that deep depression hits and I feel like I am a danger to myself. The cost is insane and I've met a lot of people who needed long term treatment who just cannot afford it. The hospital tries it best to secure some kind of longer term treatment for them but often the places are filled to capacity with a waiting list. You shouldn't have to wait to get help when you try to reach out for it.   
The hospital I go to is often filled to next to capacity and can't take anyone else because they are the only crisis hospital left in the area. I've met people from as far as 3 hours away who had to be brought over by ambulance because all the other hospitals that were close were forced to shut down. It makes me pretty angry that we don't have funding for mental healthcare.   


I recently had trouble even finding a therapist because so many places shut down. I struggled for close to a year until a new place opened up and I was able to get in, and now, just 4 months later my therapist has to turn people away because she doesn't have room.  It's downright shameful that in a country that is supposedly as great as ours that we allow so many people to suffer. People die who don't need to because they can't get the help they need in time.  I also have type 1 diabetes and we all know about the cost of insulin. People are dying because they can't get things that are essential for life. One of my long time friends works in the mental health field in the UK and they are apparently starting to have a lot of issues as well, and it's STILL better than here by a long shot. She is always appalled when I tell her things from  my latest hospital stay, and to me, that's just how it is. I feel incredibly lucky that I have been able to get the care I need when I needed it, but I often worry about what happens when I can't."
Cringetopia,ffe2r5l,t1_ffe123d,1579835181.0,"You're not wrong. I'm all for body autonomy and that includes being able to leave in a painless matter if you so choose. I also believe that most suicidal people don't want to die, they just want their pain to stop. I think we need to make it easy for people to get whatever help they need to be able to live a good life. Unfortunately there are some rare cases where there really is nothing that can be done at all, and in those cases assistance should be given if the person chooses to make an early exit.   
I say all this being a suicide attempt survivor with a great amount of mental and physical pain, and as someone who has loved ones who have survived attempts, one who did not survive, and two who were mercifully aided in the transition when they were terminal and suffering. I do not take suicide lightly, and while I would not choose it for myself, I think that people do have the right to end life with grace and without pain when there are really no other options."

medizzy,ffe17cj,t1_ffdyiv8,1579834050.0,"SSI is a tricky thing. Pretty much everyone gets denied the first time. It usually takes until the last appeal to get approved, but something like 90% of cases that go that far get approved. That's the one you actually go in front a judge and make your case. I hope you appealed the decision, if not, please do so. If  you haven't already get a lawyer that specializes in SSI/SSDI who can keep track of everything for you. It makes it much easier to deal with the whole thing, and they work on taking a % of your back pay once you do get on it. Don't give up, you absolutely can get it. Then you will be able to have Medicare and Medicaid as well if you still qualify (depends on how much you can get from SSI?SSDI). Unfortunately with the way the system is it can take several years to get approved, last I heard it takes about 4 years."

ChronicPain,ff6kj5g,t1_ff6gem1,1579629161.0,"Thank you. My meds are okay now. I still am in a decent amount of pain and can't do a whole lot, but I no longer want to blow my brains out because of pain and that's good enough for me for now. :)

That's great someone was able to help you out this month! I hope that will give your doctor time to knock some sense into your insurance company. Best of luck to you!"
diabetes_t1,ff63aob,t1_ff61s9y,1579618065.0,"Ah, apologies,  I was mistaken,  and can admit I was incorrect. All i was told is high doses of insulin can cause you to hold onto more weight and cause some weight gain.

I also realize that what I said dosen't apply to everyone. I never meant it to but I see how it came across that way. I really was just trying to point out that a lot of type 1s can relate to the meme since a lot of us do try to keep low carb for various reasons. I know experience are not universal and reasons are different for everyone. Just trying to give a reason why low carb is preferred for some of us. 

Again, I apologize if what I said came across as condescending. I'm not the best at explaining myself a lot of times."
OldSchoolCool,ff62odu,t1_ff5p7ep,1579617609.0,"I am very sorry. I did not mean to give the impression that he was some kind of monster. You are correct, he most likely had PTSD from his service. He was a really nice guy and most everyone liked him. My grandma never said a bad thing about him to me. Pretty much all of my info about when they were married comes from my mom. 
I will tell you a good memory about him to balance things out. He and my grandmas raised bird. Like a few different kinds, chickens, quail, even peacocks. I always loved going over there. All my cousins would come over and we'd run around on a little playground they built for us. Like I said, I don't personally have bad memories from him and I think by the time I was around in the early 80s any hitting had ceased. He and my grandma just couldn't reconcile whatever issues they had.  I didn't have much of a relationship with him after they divorced, but I don't hate him or anything. 

I know it's not exactly the same thing as you but I have mental health issues as well and I understand people not really understanding. I'm glad you are working on yourself, that's all we can ever do, be the best we can be. You saw things no one should ever have to see and things that the general population will never understand. I'm so sorry you have to deal with all that and I hope you find peace one day. Thank you so much for your sacrifice."
diabetes_t1,ff61dvi,t1_ff5h6b2,1579616647.0,Yeah same. I feel a lot better over all when I limit my carbs to around 30g per meal. It's much more of a hassle to eat high carb things and often not worth it for me.
diabetes,ff5bta0,t1_ff5bs0e,1579586539.0,"Well,  my mom always says I'm cool. ;)"
diabetes,ff5bri7,t1_ff5bki0,1579586488.0,"Since I was 13, so for almost 25 years now. I have type 1 which is the less common form and is an autoimmune disease."
diabetes,ff5bps3,t1_ff5bhya,1579586439.0,"Those are all great things. I have never been cool haha. 
You are most welcome and that's totally fine to follow me. I'm logging off for the night but if you have any more questions feel free to directly message me and I will do my best to help. 
Enjoy your reddit experience!"
diabetes,ff5bi5t,t1_ff5b150,1579586225.0,"That's not really a bad guess based on the shape. I don't expect most people to know what it is, it's so new that even a lot of medical professionals have never seen one and don't know what it is. I'm constantly explaining what it is and what it does to my doctors and nurses. It's always a good thing to ask about things, that's how you learn. 
I'm very glad I don't have to prick myself as much now too! :D"
diabetes,ff5bbkg,t1_ff5ahxt,1579586039.0,"Not really any advice. Just be kind, as you should with all other interactions. There is not really a profile to fill out. There is user information that shows a users activity which I think is where you might be looking at now, or at least how you got to this post since it's a 4 month old post lol. The user page just fills out naturally as you post new things and comment on others posts.    
Reddit is more like a big collection of forums for specific interests. So for example, this post is in a subreddit dedicated to diabetes. You can search interests and add those subreddits to customize your reddit browsing experience. Try searching for your hobbies, like if you enjoy crafts there are general craft subreddits and more niche ones for sewing, knitting, painting, whatever. 

 You basically with interact with a lot of strangers vs people you know and add. There is plenty of drama but it's much easier to avoid since you can easily ignore people who are antagonistic and never really see them again.  You can send direct messages to people or do chats (though not everyone uses the chat function). There is a lot to explore and the best way is just to jump in and look up things that interest you. :)"
diabetes,ff5atbj,t1_ff5ae8w,1579585540.0,"It's a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which is a device for monitoring you blood glucose levels. It's for diabetes. The patches in the photo are made of medical tape and they go over a sensor that is placed on your body. The sensor sends your blood sugar to a receiver or a phone so you can see what your blood glucose is at a glance instead of manually checking with a finger stick to draw blood. It's fairly new technology and it's really really awesome for people with diabetes. It charts what your blood sugar is doing at all times so you can make better decisions on how to adjust your insulin and if you need to eat or something."
diabetes,ff5ad56,t1_ff5ac34,1579585109.0,"Ah yes, that makes perfect sense! :D"
diabetes_t1,ff59k7l,t1_ff597ro,1579584349.0,"I was simply explaining why it would relate to someone with T1 since you seemed to think it wouldn't relate to anyone with T1. I'm not sure why you seem to think your experiences are universal? I apologize if I came off condescending with my ""explanation of T1"", I really was simply trying to show that it was not only a T2 issue. 
I'll leave you alone now since you are obviously just have a combative personality and I don't care to argue with someone who doesn't want to have a civil discourse. Have a good night/morning."
diabetes_t1,ff593dw,t1_ff58wlm,1579583919.0,You are a miserable person huh? I'm sorry you can't understand that a meme that doesn't relate to you can relate to other people. Best of luck to you on your journey friend.
OldSchoolCool,ff58zh6,t1_ff58c8e,1579583818.0,"That's quite possible knowing  my grandma. Wish I could ask her. They had happy times of course, but my mom says some pretty dark things about growing up too. I'm glad she got out as well. I really loved my step grandfather."
diabetes,ff58t0v,t1_ff587c9,1579583653.0,I'm partial to the white and black plaid. I bought all of them though cause I like to change things up every week with the site change. :D
