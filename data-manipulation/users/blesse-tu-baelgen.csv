bipolar,ff92xf5,t1_ff8hddz,1579703540.0,That’s what my aunt told me. Thank you for the validation!
bipolar,ff84rjo,t3_es5akg,1579665969.0,"Buying a Rooma while manic has really helped my household. Yeah, I’m dealing with the debt, but also my house has never been cleaner so I feel like it evens itself out!"

bipolar,fdzpxhi,t3_eng9ha,1578793112.0,I want this in my body right now. It looks so good! Do you have a recipe? Asking for myself haha
QuittingJUUL,fdugufr,t1_fdr878l,1578732764.0,"I asked him just that, so we'll see if it works! I really hope so... the one nice thing is that my brother wants to quit as well, has tried to quit in the past, but isn't currently ready to give it another go. At least he knows what it feels like to go cold turkey. Anyways, I'll check out your list. Thanks so much! Frantically typing out these replies is doing a pretty good job of improving my willpower!"
QuittingJUUL,fdugl28,t1_fdrero8,1578732640.0,"""when I saw him frantically looking for it in the couch and remembered that fiendy feeling"" this is so relatable! It cracks me up. Thankfully my brother tends to only smoke in certain areas of the house, so for the first little bit i think I'll just avoid going into his room. It kinda makes me sad though because we used to ""bond"" over hitting the juul together in the morning. Kinda sounds silly when I think about it from a quitting perspective. 

Thanks for the advice as well! You're so right about the cravings never going away until you quit. It was only when I realized how close to being near a juul at the cravings came back. Thank you for sharing your experience with me, I'm feeling a lot more confident I'll stay strong!"
QuittingJUUL,fdufw1j,t1_fdqbjqw,1578732441.0,"Thanks for the advice! I called him and let him know where I am with quitting and he seemed pretty receptive. I binged some McDonalds because I was craving the damn juul so much, and I'm still in Norway so nowhere near a juul haha."
ADHD,fdnh0x7,t3_em4dbp,1578585625.0,"Me 10000000% I started when watching shows in Norwegian (my second language), but realized how much it helped me pay attention so now I have to have them regardless of the language."

stopsmoking,fd8xnf3,t3_ekavf6,1578224998.0,Well done and good luck!! I’m on day 7! For me it got a easier around/after day 4 :)))
QuittingJUUL,fd8ifa7,t3_ek4f0f,1578218735.0,"I don't know if this will help, but I use the Smoke Free app and one of the ""challenges"" on day 6 was to research willpower. It was basically saying that willpower will run out, so we should give in to other cravings we might have, like for food, shopping, literally anything. 

I'm on vacation and one week JUUL free. Buuuuut JUUL isn't legal where I am so I have no temptations (my friend smokes cigarettes, and although I hate the taste, every time she smokes I start feening for nicotine haha). I know when I get home and see my brother's JUUL, I'm going to probably start up an addiction to chocolate or something like that."
QuittingJUUL,fd8hhye,t3_ek2slq,1578218464.0,"I'm a week JUUL free now and I can't imagine how you did it. That's a lot of willpower! I quit on the plane to Norway for a two-week vacation because I knew I'd be jet-lagged already, so I thought since the brain fog would already be there I might as well quit. I tried quitting before but couldn't handle the withdrawal effects while at work because it made me nearly incompetent. 

Anyways, good job, I'm impressed!"

ADHD,fcmdg24,t1_fcls0rv,1577771339.0,"I've honestly been thinking that might be a possibility, so reading you say that is giving me a little more confidence to talk to my psychiatrist about it. Thank you!!"
ADHD,fcketx2,t1_fcjyzye,1577723743.0,100% relating to that right now
ADHD,fckdos8,t1_fcjpe74,1577723005.0,"Thank you for your positivity and understanding. I've been feeling pretty icky lately but it really helps to know that I'm not alone in this, and that there are people out there who **actually** understand me. I really like your language metaphor as well!"

ADHD,fcjnwr1,t3_eha04r,1577695827.0,"Bahahaha....earlier this week I literally *raged* because I couldn't find tape and scissors. They always go in the same drawer. What's crappy is that I blamed it on my cousin who is also my roommate. I didn't call him out or anything, but I bitched at my brother about it. I said things like ""he always puts things in the most illogical places and I can never find them!!""

I realized the next day that I had put the tape, scissors, AND wrapping paper on our kitchen table and couldn't see them."
ADHD,fcjnqai,t3_dwevhe,1577695576.0,"I wasn't nearly as good as a student in high-school, but throughout my BA I was definitely 100% the way you describe. I feel like the combination of untreated ADHD and GAD made it so I got A's in nearly every class I took, but the rest of my life was a complete disaster. I was diagnosed at 27 and just....it breaks my heart thinking about how I could have lived if I had been diagnosed at a younger age. I still struggle with feeling like a fraud because I can be ""intelligent"" if I *want* (AKA if my brain finds that topic interesting). 

What is weird for me though is that I was only good at reading and writing. I couldn't do math to save my life because it required too much focus. I'm not sure why learning languages and writing isn't as much of a struggle as other areas in my life. It blows my mind now though that with medication math is so much easier."
ADHD,fcjms29,t3_ehg2uz,1577694262.0,"I hate it so much. It makes me feel like I've made up my ADHD symptoms and I'm in fact a loser. I tend to just laugh it off then consider that person not safe to share the intimacies of my life with. 

I do try, however, to advocate for ADHD diagnosis when I chat with folks I care about (generally at work) who exhibit similar characteristics. 

I should caveat and say that I'm transgender (assigned female at birth) and didn't get diagnosed with ADHD until last year at 27 years old. I work at a university and tend to talk about my ADHD mostly with femme-identifying coworkers. So when I talk about my ADHD and one of those coworker says ""oh my gosh I might have ADHD because I am failing my classes, I get obsessive about things for a while but then the obsession goes away, I can't remember to do my tasks, I'm failing in my career"" (the list goes on) I'm definitely on board to recommend that they talk to a mental health professional about the possibility of ADHD."
ADHD,fcjm1hn,t1_fcjlzc3,1577693268.0,ADHD is also not really understanding how reddit works.... lol.
ADHD,fcjlzc3,t1_fcjgm0t,1577693191.0,"ADHD is thinking you're living your best life the last couple months, only to have it all come crashing down on you when you realize you've just amassed more debt and weren't really on top of your life like you thought you were. It's thinking back at how impulsive you've been, how you've probably annoyed the crap out of all your coworkers by talking non-stop about murder (true crime is my thing), how you haven't cared as well for your pets like you should and WANT to (but you didn't because you weren't even aware that you weren't). 

It's also realizing how much the people in your life really and truly love you. Why else would they stick around through all the hard times? I'm sitting on the couch of my best friend's parents, in Norway (I'm from the U.S.), realizing that they've been a constant in my life when all else has seemed like chaos. I haven't been here in months and it still looks the same. ADHD is vulnerability. 

ADHD is worrying that the two paragraphs above you just wrote sound like random babblings, but believing that it'll be okay anyways.

(P.S. - thank you for this post!! i've been struggling the past couple of weeks and this is giving me a healthy outlet)"
Anxiety,e2pjo2a,t1_e2mb8l0,1532063746.0,"Ahhh thank you! I finally asked my therapist last week if we could explore medications, and he said he’d schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist for me because he agreed that it might help. But now I’ve been going back and forth on whether or not I even need it, or if I even have anxiety at all! I’ve been afraid that the psychiatrist will tell me I’m overreacting and that I don’t need medication. 

I really hope my story ends up like yours. I know it’s weird to say that I HOPE I actually have anxiety, but at this point I feel like if I have a real diagnosis I’ll be able to stop questioning myself all the time and start improving my quality of life. "
