It doesn't matter whether he was in fear of bodily harm to himself.  The key is that he was in fear of bodily harm to the victim who was lying on the ground and being kicked.

At the time that he slapped her, the attacker that he had previously removed from the victim was starting to attack the victim again.  It would be entirely unreasonable to expect the man to turn his back to someone who was threatening him with a weapon in hand.  If he actually intended to injure the girl with the shoe, he could have hit her with a closed fist.  An open handed slap was a reasonable level of force."

At this point, he is likely to be facing two aggressive people, one of whom is armed.  There is no need to wait to remove that threat.  Attacker's friend had every opportunity to retreat.  Instead, she approached him holding something that can easily be used as a weapon.  In the meantime, attacker went right back to assaulting the victim.

Impeachment is for official misconduct.  But if the President were to walk out on the front lawn of the White House with a rifle and just start randomly shooting citizens, you think law enforcement would have to sit there and watch him/her until a Senate trial was over?  That's not only not in the Constitution, it's insane.  The President is subject to criminal law the same as everyone else.

Only the Legislative branch can remove the President from office.  But that is a political process that is completely separate from criminal prosecution.  Again, where are you seeing it in law that the President cannot be indicted for a crime while in office?"
moderatepolitics,fcn547p,t1_fcn0vvq,1577803510.0,"Where does it say that?  The only immunity I've ever seen applied to the President was a Justice Department memo that only applies to Justice Department employees.

Ken Starr, while investigating Bill Clinton, asserted he had the authority to indict the sitting President during the Lewinsky scandal.  He said that as a special prosecutor, internal Justice Department policy did not apply to him.  This became moot, of course, when the President was impeached.

Bill Clinton tried to argue he was immune from court proceedings while sitting as President during the Paula Jones case.  The Supreme Court rejected the arguments of the White House unanimously.

But the best argument that the President is subject to indictment while in office is that the Constitution says nothing on the subject.  This is in direct contrast to Congress where the Constitution says that a sitting Senator or House member cannot be arrested while performing their duties except for treason, felonies, or breach of the peace.  If the Constitution is so specific as to the immunities of congressmen, do you think the framers meant for the President to also be immune and just forgot to put it in?

I agree that indicting a President while in office is probably a bad idea.  It is good precedent that we wait to indict them for crimes in office until after they leave office.  But if the question is whether it is legally possible, I can't see anywhere in law that would make the President immune.  Presidents are not kings.

Congress has the authority to issue an arrest warrant for a person who does not comply with a subpoena.  The arresting officer is the Sergeant-At-Arms of the House or Senate.

He was arrested, and sentenced to jail.  He challenged his arrest, but SCOTUS ruled unanimously that his arrest was within the powers of Congress to enforce their subpoena.

Since ignoring a congressional subpoena is a criminal act, Congress can refer the matter to the Department of Justice for prosecution.
