rareinsults,ffi7xqj,t1_ffhm1b8,1579967424.0,Because racism isn’t about just hating and avoiding people of color. It’s a lot more nuanced than that. That’s like asking how a guy who has a girlfriend friend can be sexist. The answer is easily and all the time lol
rareinsults,ffe1bae,t1_ffdx3lc,1579834128.0,Ya but you didn’t comment on the post. You replied to a comment about the actual reality of where this extreme thought process comes from. “Learn to Read” is so tired honestly lol
rareinsults,ffe0wer,t1_ffdz184,1579833826.0,"3 layers? Do guys still wear undershirts under button shirts? They sell summer fabric pants also. Thick pants aren’t a must either. 

I see where your coming from with long sleeves but there are for sure cooler options for dudes in office wear."

Ideally you find a middle ground but unfortunately that means changing it so men are slightly less, and women are slightly more, comfortable than before...which provokes ignorant comments like yours."

television,fekm13c,t1_fekir3v,1579202851.0,I don’t even know what the second part of your comment is supposed to say. But this is a persons entire life we’re talking about and some people have their parents figure it out for them and a lot of people have to fight to be recognized for their merits and not their parents. Definitely not fair for the generation in question. You shouldn’t be able to buy power and position.

AskReddit,febdrv7,t1_feba7hd,1578957789.0,It’s not safer for the trans person. It’s just makes guys feel more comfortable. Which is of course the only opinion in this thread. Personal safety of trans people is less important than potentially making a straight guy flirt with or date a trans person.

facepalm,fe9byaa,t1_fe6v149,1578936189.0,Yea you’re actually right I am not only ignoring your point I am actively trying to forget people like you exist lol. People who think a girl lying about them is the same kind of problem as being raped. And you think it’s just as bad and just as common? HA
facepalm,fe9bmqy,t1_fe6v1mf,1578936092.0,Because the men in this thread are desperate to be as victimized as the women in the world who are raped but they’ve actually convinced themselves that their equivalent of that is a girl lying about them.
AmateurRoomPorn,fe9aqgs,t1_fe8m9nb,1578935936.0,Hey man. Looking okay is not room porn. When people post burnt lumpy pizza to food porn they get downvoted. This is suuuuper average and probably came this way when they moved in. No reason to throw around jr high insults. Jeez lol.
rupaulsdragrace,fe6i3gi,t1_fe674fm,1578891593.0,Yes Halloweentown 2: Calibar’s Revenge reference.
facepalm,fe5391n,t1_fe43y25,1578865264.0,Lol. Whatever man. You’ve missed the point completely.
facepalm,fe53418,t1_fe44ekg,1578865217.0,Never said 70% was the national statistic. How many men in your life have been accused of rape though. Compared to women being assaulted. It’s just apples and oranges.
facepalm,fe52r8u,t1_fe48iz4,1578865131.0,Lol no. That’s not the only reason rape and lying are treated as different crimes.
facepalm,fe3yak7,t1_fe3xaec,1578853953.0,20% of men have not been accused of rape. 20% is the number of reported rapes from women btw.
facepalm,fe3wrwz,t1_fe3ozcd,1578853527.0,"How could you get that from me talking about just my friend group lmao. I don’t associate with rapists btw. Unsurprisingly, my experience has given me a low tolerance for aggressive behavior."
facepalm,fe3vxm1,t1_fe3ppk4,1578853357.0,Nope. lol. Regular white trash east coast. Frat boys who take advantage of passed out girls. Teachers fucking students. Family members assaulting family members etc.
facepalm,fe3vjrf,t1_fe3rokh,1578853232.0,Yea it happens. It’s high in my group of friends but not impossible. Like 10% of people are gay but 50% of my friend group is gay. See how that makes sense?
facepalm,fe3uzxd,t1_fe3s83c,1578853155.0,Yea just don’t respond to my comment at all. lol. I know what therapy is. I know what you’re implying and I do not care lol
facepalm,fe3upqv,t1_fe3sqhm,1578853084.0,When did I claim it was standard. It just so happens to be very high in my friend group is all I said.
facepalm,fe3ukz1,t1_fe3ts8i,1578853045.0,Why are you leaping to ridiculous conclusions just because I’m pointing out you’re comparing two scenarios that couldn’t be more different in so many ways
facepalm,fe3rzat,t1_fe3qfd5,1578852288.0,Most people do. But are you suggesting. You know as many men who have been accused of rape as women who’ve been raped?? That’s not something therapy can fix. You’re gonna have to go back to kindergarten to learn how to count.
facepalm,fe3rto7,t1_fe3reti,1578852235.0,Mmmm I youre right. Women don’t get raped at an alarming rate. My mistake.
facepalm,fe3oxjg,t1_fe3lkye,1578851463.0,Yea it happens dude. The actual statistic isn’t that far off. Obviously some groups will be high and low on either side.
facepalm,fe3ommp,t1_fe3nnsj,1578851388.0,Yea but one very rarely happens. And one happens all the time. Also I’d really rather be accused of rape than raped but that’s just me.
facepalm,fe3ogkv,t1_fe3ll9l,1578851325.0,Wow. lol. Go look up the statistic then if you don’t like my experience. When did I say I hang out with  rapists? I’m the only one in my friend group with enough balls to kick out creeps or avoid them all together.
facepalm,fe3nzba,t1_fe3mmbb,1578851211.0,lol I’m not lying. If you don’t like my experience then go google the actual statistic. Doesn’t change my point
facepalm,fe3nsoa,t1_fe3mpap,1578851155.0,Haha nice try troll
facepalm,fe3mrnw,t1_fe2ksvn,1578850735.0,Try and stay alive one more day maybe you’ll figure out what an obviously fake post looks like.
facepalm,fe3mk7k,t1_fe3ljkj,1578850652.0,"Rape is more common than murder dude. I don’t know anyone who knows anyone who’s been murdered. 70% of the women in my life have been raped. Even more sexually assaulted. Rape and murder are apples and oranges. 

Also. There’s no stigma associated with reporting a murder. For lots of people going through reporting a rape can be more traumatic than the event itself."
facepalm,fe3ljco,t1_fe3fwp7,1578850384.0,"Yea well not 100% of cases work out the way they should. 

We already have a problem convicting rapists. By your logic every rapist goes to jail. That’s not how it works."
facepalm,fe3kk11,t1_fe3jb4k,1578850148.0,"Yea but. 70% of my girl friends have been raped and 100% of us have been sexually assaulted. So.  I think what they’re asking is how does your fear of a lie about rape compare to the fear of rape. 

Nice try tho."
educationalgifs,fe3gb5w,t1_fe2inxh,1578849035.0,You don’t notice the good one’s. Lots and lots and lots of people have had work done that you wouldn’t notice.
educationalgifs,fe3engp,t1_fe2dbpw,1578848600.0,Nah. That’s just the bad ones.
educationalgifs,fe3drld,t1_fe2li4z,1578848390.0,Not as many as you think. Good work you don’t notice without a before and after pic. Obviously the ones you notice in public are bad because you can tell even when strangers have had it done.
educationalgifs,fe3d29s,t1_fe2kzvt,1578848194.0,You can’t always tell the good ones actually. There’s nothing you can do to de age without Botox or plastic surgery. Anti aging is about preserving what you’ve got. Not turning back the clock.
educationalgifs,fe3cjdu,t1_fe2k3od,1578848031.0,"I mean they don’t but most people I know can’t spot the good lip jobs. So. If you’re asking why people get their lips done:

1. Most people can’t tell you’ve had it done and it looks great

They have p good reasons btw. You just don’t like being blamed for something MOST men do. Cause not all men and stuff."
news,fdqs1ie,t1_fdqq6ma,1578673649.0,"What about what she did is a feminine thing to do? Toxic masculinity is about traits that are deemed masculine and are toxic to men and women. Such as violence or being macho or being told not to cry. 

Toxic femininity would be something that hurts both genders that stems from a trait we deem feminine. That would be like competitiveness with other women. Or being obsessed with a feminine appearance."

MakeupAddiction,fdko14w,t1_fdkip98,1578507566.0,It’s a make up subreddit. You don’t get to decide how much make up is enough. You may be shocked to learn pretty girls like makeup because it’s fun not the because they’re more or less pretty without it.

My point was if the “generic guy” was as hot as this girl, i wouldn’t complain. And it’s hypocritical to mock women for being attractive and that not being enough if they look like they go to Starbucks or whatever. Meanwhile the generic dude never does any grooming or dresses nice and definitely isnt as attractive as this girl."
rareinsults,fdkd1a2,t1_fdj7z37,1578501292.0,Identical was never the right word but it was in the original post. But yea. Guys all wear the same stuff and they smell the same and they all don’t take care of their hair or skin. I call that identical enough for this discussion.

Make up is 100% part of a costume or cosplay btw. Ask anyone who does it."

gatesopencomeonin,fdh1bdd,t1_fd2rww6,1578413222.0,Lol. Only straight people think a majority of trans or non binary people are out there asking people to refer to them by this long list of pronouns. I’ve never seen anything like it in the real world.
gatesopencomeonin,fdh0xln,t1_fd7chex,1578412979.0,Yea. Having your existence and identity denied can aid in depression. And doing that to someone because of “traditional values” is an awful excuse.

Actually. Maybe you are in elementary school if you think both political parties are even close to comparable. One sides flaw is being too liberal and not having tons of economic boosting ideas.

Forcing people to put them away at dinner is ridiculous and not everyone who has them out is mindlessly scrolling through Instagram and taking selfies. Anyway. Have a nice day grandpa.
