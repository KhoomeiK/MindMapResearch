Dallas,ffx3lnx,t1_ffw0t08,1580317025.0,"Not in this thread, this sub has died down a lot on coronavirus since the A&M student was cleared of coronavirus, but you would think people in this sub were convinced that Dallas was already doomed. There was the same fear in this sub during the whole ebola incident, the difference being people actually were infected in Dallas (2), and when they were cleared the commotion also died down. The point I was trying to make, that everyone seems to be missing, is that the flu is already a problem but since most people that catch it are somewhat functional while contagious (recover enough to get back to work) they don't take it too seriously and infect others, but don't consider people that are high risk. Mainly just tired of seeing everyone going on about coronavirus but nobody cares about the flu, gets flu shots, etc while we have absolutely had a significant amount of deaths since October."

Dallas,ffvqo60,t1_ffvpba9,1580270572.0,"I'm not being contrarian for the sake of it, I'm being realistic. People are flipping shit in Dallas when we haven't even had a suspected case, the closest was A&M and that was confirmed not coronavirus. It's become a meme at this point. We had the same thing with ebola, it was all over the news because of how bad it was and how easily it spreads. I was living 2 blocks away from one of the nurses in quarantine, we heard the helicopters. Did Dallas get infected? No. We know how bad it is, the CDC has been on top of it (and has locked down the people that have brought it back into quarantine). The CDC has even said the virus is not spreading in America and is low risk here right now.

There's just no use worrying over something that right now is not an issue here, where we're still battling stuff like the flu which IS a huge problem this season. I'm just tired of the circlejerking over coronavirus infecting everyone. People have been playing way too much plague inc.

Dallas,ffvprrr,t1_ffvopqr,1580269903.0,"Those statstics are way closer together than that. The danger with both flu and coronavirus is the standard high risk groups (immunocompromised, elderly, children, pregnant). The death rate for coronavirus has been something like 10%. For [flu this year](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm) there's been 8-20k deaths over 15-21m infections, ~~that's 5-10% fatality rate~~.

explainlikeimfive,ffrlnp7,t1_ffqld6e,1580160594.0,"That seems to be the natural progression. The internet as a whole faced that. Everyone had their personal sites up for free, then as businesses started getting online their content was tied to paid services or it was small enough to be self sponsored, but as traffic increased and hosting got expensive it was either start charging for content people already had free or show ads. They opted for ads. If one site charged and the other showed ads the site with ads would win out every time. Now that it makes sense to pay (look at paywall sites, memberships, etc) still many go the ad route because it's grown so big and is the primary source of income for a lot of sites now. The other side of the coin, even if sites did charge to cover their usage, they wouldn't get enough anyway and would still have to show ads.

So now people use adblock because ads got so obnoxious to push profits, which pushes more ads, and we're in a feedback loop where ads become more valuable with analytics which encourage apps to collect as much data as they can so the ads that are shown are more effective, despite the fact that they might get blocked anyway."

I sit at my desk all day, the only real interaction I have most of the time is either meetings (and that's because people whiteboard or talk over each other) or hang out and have lunch with coworkers, neither of which is really necessary. But it would shave an hour a day of driving for me, and 2-3x that for others I work with, multiply by the what thousand of us that probably work there and that's a single office that gets and average of lets say 1500 hours a day (average 45m each way) the company could get, which would be worth (assuming they use that commute time to work) an extra 187 people, or if they don't work that's an extra 16 days worth of PTO time they get back per person, both of which would be huge productivity boosts for a company."

Years later, we pull some meat out of the freezer, make some mac and cheese. As we're eating, we wonder, are we eating Mack with our mac and cheese? To this day I'm still not sure, but maybe. He was a cute lamb."
