AskReddit,ffb6s5n,t1_ff9pzah,1579753319.0,"I'm no musical expert, but I have a theory on this.

The style of songs in animated musicals shifted. As late as the first half of the 90's Disney movies would have characters break into song, but the song was a thing that happened, and was part of moving the plot forward, or introducing everything you need to know about a character. 

The genie was telling Aladdin about all the cool things he could do with his wishes. Ursula was telling Ariel about the nature of the contracts she makes with Poor Unfortunate Souls. Mrs Pots was explaining how Bell's Stockholm syndrome was progressing to Chip. Each song was advancing the plot and pushing the story forward.

Later on Disney films started doing more of the Broadway Musical Thing where they have the action pause so someone can sing a song about how they feel about that thing that just happened. Also, someone is probably going to talk in a regular voice while other people sing at them. 

I think I Just Can't Wait To Be King from the Lion King might have been the first time that happened, and hey, that went on to make bank on Broadway so maybe they were onto something. But the songs feel different because they do a different thing.

It was an inverted heist movie, where we knew from the start that everything went wrong. 

It started off making the criminals human and likable, and then made them all unlikable again by the end, because they're still criminals at the end of the day.

It had a final shootout that is literally over in less than a couple seconds, and that you have to watch frame by frame to tell what actually happens in what order. But it doesn't really matter, because you still know who lives and who dies even if you watch it at full speed.

Oh, and it was made when Quentin Tarantino had to actually work for a living, so it's not completely up its own ass with some kind of Alternative Timeline Quentin-verse or smugly and self-awarely confident of how awesome its own genius is. 

It also has a cast of talented actors turning in excellent performances of interesting characters.

Most 3D movies (even after Avatar) feel like they have to have at least one scene where something is so 'close' to your eye that you have to go cross-eyed to see it, sort of a 'hey, look how cool 3D is!' moment that apparently no director can resist. 

Avatar went the other direction, and gave depth to things _behind_ the screen, so that it felt more like looking into a three dimensional space that had some set dressing spilling into the area between you and the screen. It wasn't violently poking your eyes out with a spear or a knife every other scene.

witcher,ff02eq1,t1_fezzsjd,1579464471.0,"Sure. The stresses on a blade are greater closer to the hilt, which is where the cutout is. 

In addition to that the metal of the blade is not uniformly hard. The edges of the blade are harder so that they can hold a sharp edge, while the central core of the blade is made of softer metal, which has more spring and give, so the entire blade doesn't shatter if it hits something. And swords are basically for hitting things.

In Ciri's sword, the pointy edges of the cutout are really close to the edge of the blade, meaning that there is mostly only harder metal and very little little springy material at that point. Any force exerted at any point further up the blade is likely to shatter the blade at the points of that cutout."

AskReddit,fcvjt5z,t1_fcv42cl,1578003609.0,"I would love a Skyrim as a Netflix tv show that just had a Nord warrior fighting his way through a different dungeon every week. This week it would be bandits. Next week it would be Draugr.

But most importantly, there would be no progress made on the over arching plot. It would get introduced in the first episode, and then get dropped. The only real continuity would be that the main character kept the loot they got at the end of the episode.

This would go on for episode after episode until the initially large fan base would complain that there was no progress was being made on the overall story. 

Then Netflix would apologize, fire all the producers, directors, and writers. Then they would reboot the show with a different cast, this time focusing on a main character that was sneaky argonian thief. 

And then the show would do exactly the same thing again, focusing on individual dungeons each episode, with no real carry over between episodes. This would continue on again, until the fans revolt and demand change again.

The next reboot would focus on an elven mage that only used magic. It would also only have individual dungeon delves, and not really advance the main plot.

And once the fans complained, Netflix would start all over again.

I think that would be the tv show the captured Skyrim perfectly.

Oh, and each reboot would have one episode where the main character just made a gillion iron daggers. Like, so many iron daggers that they destabilize the local economy because everyone has so many cheap iron daggers. The entire episode would just by them standing over the forge and anvil, hammering out daggers."
