worldnews,fffv202,t1_fffsi19,1579892417.0,"Again, because you are so dense, there is no sexism, what you think is happening is only happening to you and to other men who don't know what they are doing.  It is not happening, not even a little bit, to me or other men, who know what they are doing.  

It is happening to you, not because sexism, but because you suck and you are being replaced by women who know what they are doing.  Hmm, you might say but how do we know it?  We know it from the fact that 90/100 of investment banker are men, and if men were discouraged and discriminated against in any systematic fashion, that would not be the case. 

And no for fucks sake, wanting to hire more women is not discrimination, not under the law at any rate.  Neither is wanting to hire men.  And people do both, all the time, depending on the industry and circumstances. 

You people need to understand that you being butt hurt by something does not make it sexism."

No one is asking anyone for their sexual orientation, princess, calm tf down.  We are talking about board members, not employees, and we are talking about them ALL being a certain of a certain orientation.  Goldman Sachs isn't about to go ask each director whether they are gay."

worldnews,fffrxwp,t1_fffqwhd,1579890490.0,"Are you completely brain dead? Wanting more women because the field is actually dominated by men is not sexism. 

The culture in investment banking has been to be a big ol boys club for decades, and they are grappling with the consequences of their industry's past now.  If you, as a man, want to be respected as an investment banker, all you have to do is bring in a lot of business and bam, you got yourself a nice csreer.  There is literally no man out there who is an investment guru who is out of a job because ""sexism."". 

Sexism against men is something no-good men have made up, because they need something to justify their failures.  I hear these failed men complain about this in basically every industry, yet the numbers don't lie, if there was rampant sexism in any of these industries, including investment banking, these fields would not be dominated by men."

Did you think he might not have mentioned her to you because she wasn't coming? Or because you're nosy and he just doesn't want to deal with your nonsense?"
worldnews,fffqhu1,t1_fffkmmq,1579889599.0,"If your board is comprised entirely of people of the same sex, sexual orientation, and race, then chances are you stacked it with your friends to help you become the next Elizabeth Holmes or Adam Newman, and not based on said directors qualifications and ability to represent the shareholders' interest, so yeah, there is that."
worldnews,fffq8jv,t1_fffmicw,1579889439.0,"This is stupid and untrue.  I work in m&a and every single day I am on calls and in meetings with investment banks that come to these things in teams of 5-10 people each.  I am yet to see a SINGLE woman investment banker.   

Sexism against men my ass."

Stocks - don't be scared at all.  You can invest in mutual funds and let it sit and earn money for you. It's basically the same as 401(k) except post tax.  I am putting the money I'm saving for a house in a total market index fund because I won't be buying in the next year or so."
