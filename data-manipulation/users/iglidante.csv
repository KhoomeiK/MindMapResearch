This topic is fascinating to me. I fall somewhere in between full visualization and your experience: I can picture quite a bit in my head, but it's disconnected and kind of abstract. One thing I *absolutely do not do* is picture faces when I'm reading. I guess I could really do it if I tried, but it's not something that comes naturally. If a passage describes all the features of a new character's face, none of that gels into a specific face for me.
