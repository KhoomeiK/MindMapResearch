fatlogic,ffi1hql,t1_ffhuem5,1579962258.0,"Indeed!  Even though I'm in the US I often use metric just because it's more precise and less cumbersome, especially for measuring materials for my projects and such."

fatlogic,ffadzfm,t1_ffa7s91,1579733355.0,"I think OP meant myths pertaining to diet, not dieting itself, at least as I read it."
fatlogic,fet4wt6,t1_fesmlye,1579371813.0,Curry still looks better than some of the stomach-bloated monstrosities of recent years.  I quit following pro bodybuilding when the steroid bloat got ridiculous.
fatlogic,fet3qau,t1_fesdtu6,1579371532.0,"Similar stats as me, 5'4"" and same size clothing...I'm almost certain I can get off my blood pressure meds, I'll just have to talk to the Dr.  Once they put you on those things though, it seems a Herculean task to convince them to let you try tapering off."
fatlogic,fen8rfn,t1_fen89xo,1579279445.0,Probably water.  Ask doctor if maybe a diuretic is an option.  I won't even take prednisone for this reason.
fatlogic,fen8als,t1_femy7xp,1579279157.0,"That site's 3d model seems way off at my h/w, which is 5'4"" and 119.  I'm pretty sure I don't have that poochy of an abdomen or two extra back rolls.  But then again I guess it's trying to average lots of different builds?"
fatlogic,fekdb9q,t1_fejrq7u,1579197653.0,"Going from a hot mess to just hot, amirite?  Sounds like the ups and downs were worth it, and it also shows how changing your reasons/motivation along the way is totally valid."
fatlogic,fejslnl,t3_epefe7,1579184835.0,"A few months ago someone posted a sign a doctor had in their office basically saying ""our policy is to weigh you as part of your care, it's not optional"".  That would hopefully weed out most people with this attitude, but then again someone would start some shit."
fatlogic,feiomih,t1_feilx8g,1579143407.0,Me neither; I doubt that's all there is to it but who knows.  Some employers here offer programs like this to try to reduce their premiums but they at least require a visit with a nurse or something like that.  (employee gets a discount for participating).
fatlogic,fei3tpc,t1_fegld79,1579129671.0,"Wow, well written, hits home.  What was your tipping point, if you care to share?"
fatlogic,feggp9c,t1_fegecho,1579092179.0,"Sorry, I lost you here, how so?  I'm not getting that sense at all, but maybe I haven't had enough coffee."
fatlogic,fe5poag,t3_ensael,1578872699.0,"I follow a few websites and apps for medical professionals and unfortunately yes, HAES is infiltrating the medical profession."
fatlogic,fe5ob6u,t1_fe4g0z3,1578872079.0,"There are other causes for OSA, but excess weight is the major one."
fatlogic,fe5nm7l,t1_fe48fyu,1578871870.0,"Other causes are a possibility, so you're not necessarily not thin enough :)

Mosaic,fdsclbx,t3_emwpfd,1578699536.0,I would take a sample of each color to a home store like Lowe's (for instance) - find a brand of grout that has a sample color chart and try to find something that will work for all.  I know the struggle :/
fatlogic,fdrm94c,t1_fdquc6w,1578686475.0,"It's quite disturbing reading comments by young people elsewhere on reddit that they're on the downhill side and resigning themselves to old age ""now that I'm past 25"" (for instance).  And here's you and I crushing it at at similar ages.  I do make groaning noises a lot but that's a weird habit of mine college roommates used to complain about."
fatlogic,fdn81m7,t1_fdn6qez,1578579795.0,Wow.  In college in the 80s a friend and I used to take walks around campus (sometimes miles long) just to talk and have fun.  Also our campus didn't have a bus or shuttle system like they all do now.  And this was in a very cold area!
Vindicta,fdiihfa,t3_elj6ac,1578443660.0,"I think so but think it's kind of a circular thing.  As the dorky, ugly, bullied girl in grade school I felt my name was ""dorky"" too and that feeling has lasted a long time (started using the full version as soon as I had a choice). So maybe your feelings about yourself influence how you see your name vice versa as well."
cats,fdfotdl,t3_el04ld,1578366648.0,Those little paws!
Vindicta,fd6wj3o,t3_ek6o29,1578196617.0,"Thanks for this.  I have a naturally small weak voice and I get continually talked over, and angry when people ask me to repeat myself."
