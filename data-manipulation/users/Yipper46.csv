Okay but seriously, gen 5 was the peak, and it dropped hard when X and Y came out. At least imo, you can have your opinion."

ConsumeProduct,fgryj71,t1_fgrqyi9,1581062731.0,"Yeah but not to *this* extent. The games used to have a bit of challenge depending on how you play. A sort of built in variable challenge that if a player manages to figure out certain things (like how you can just grind a bit and be overleveled) the player is rewarded with less challenge in actual battling, but they don't *have to* do that. Now you just get healed up no matter what and with a universal experience share you are *always* overleveled. Gameplay aside now they are cutting Pokemon (thus cutting content). and while I prefer the dlc approach to the 3rd game that doesn't change how this was clearly just content they couldn't get into the base game. Like a good amount of Pokemon where in the code of the game when it released, they where like nearly done with them and then they release them in dlc? Yeah, I ain't buying that this was planned for the dlc. On top of that with how they are handling Pokemon bank really puts the nail on the coffin for how corporate the game is now, as they are making you pay $16 freaking dollars *a year* for a maximum of 2.5GB of cloud storage. Something that should really just be free because it's not like the biggest franchise in the world can't afford to have TWO GIGABYTES free to everyone!"

Additionally, y'all in high school. I just got out of high school last year and I'm still figuring myself out in certain ways. Obviously nothing with gender but other things. Anyhow, my point is he shouldn't be doing anything, no hormones, no surgeries, nothing. Tell him that you love him for who he is not who he feels he should be. Tell him what you admire about his appearance, as it is now. Tell him he doesn't have to hate himself or his masculine features. If you want obviously I'm not demanding you do this, but it's my advice for the situation. Go about it in your own way.

ConsumeProduct,fgeeu6f,t3_exww5z,1580697928.0,Imo vitiligo is cool. But the issue is how Barby is nowadays with their diversity crap. Like my goodness you look at the Barby section and it's like an overweight feminist had a wet dream about a gay man and barfed out all of those feelings and then the barf molded itself into plastic dolls.
