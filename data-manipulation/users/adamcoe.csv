audioengineering,feuji9d,t1_fettfdx,1579387122.0,"Oh no nothing that drastic, the worst thing you might experience is a slight loss of signal (like single digit dBs) or a very slight ""dulling"" of things but most likely the difference will be largely imperceptible if it's just a simple home recording (vs. say a live show with large levels of amplification happening, etc). If it's just you and a buddy or two doing some bedroom demos and stuff, your Y split is probably totally fine. Depends slightly on the mic you're using (and more precisely, the impedance of that mic, condensers are a little more sensitive to stuff like this) but chances are you won't notice a thing."

There are much nicer ones to be sure but this will get the job done. Chances are you can rent one from your local PA shop/music store for very cheap if you don't need one often and hence don't want to purchase one.  Just make sure to plug the ""direct"" side into whatever will be providing the phantom, as the isolated side is well, isolated with a transformer and will not pass phantom. 

Using a Y cable as you suggested is usually fine in most cases, as the split load is still well within the spec of 99% of gear, this is simply the more ""correct"" way to do it. The difference is somewhat minimal but it is there, so if you have the option, definitely use a proper splitter."

Doing a rough mix, or as I say, checking to see if mixes translate on cans is fine and in fact encouraged, but mixing records on headphones is like painting landscapes with sunglasses on.

Keep in mind you'll also need a decent interface as well, in the case of running plugs live, to keep latency down, as you probably don't want to rely on the onboard sound (of any laptop, regardless of brand) for stuff like that.

Outside of that though, just simple FOH tracking and basic editing/mixing, damn near anything built recently will do you. Core i7 chip would be nice, though probably a fast i5 will get the job done, 16GB of RAM is usually plenty (32 if you're mixing with a lot of plugs and/or high track counts). Solid state hard drive is VERY helpful and they're inexpensive these days. For example, my main rig until very recently was this, purchased in 2014 and still a totally viable rig:

- Core i7 2.4 gHz (Turbo up to 3.5 I believe)
- 16 GB DDR3 RAM
- Nvidia 860M video card (4GB I believe but it *may* have been 6)
- 2x Samsung SSDs (1x 1TB, 1x500GB but this is overkill)
- interfaces were an X32 (live) and either a Roland Octo-Capture, which was later replaced with a MOTU 828es for in the studio
- Waves Tracks Live for live tracking (very stable, works great) which was later eliminated as I bought the capture card for the X32 so it was no longer necessary...and either Sonar or PT for mixing.

That was considered a fairly high end rig in 2013/14, which means you can now get a similarly spec'd machine for probably half the price, unless it says Apple on it. I paid $1900ish at the time so chances are you can get a very capable machine for a grand or maybe even less, depending on how heavy duty you think you'll need. It sounds like you don't need anything super insane. (This was also a 17"" screen which bumped the price up a bit, a 15"" machine with the same specs was a couple of hundred dollars cheaper.)

The human psyche is only designed for about 40 years (at best!) and everything truly amazing happens by 25 or so. You can try to kid yourself into thinking otherwise but mostly it's making excuses or trying to fit a narrative into a place it doesn't belong. Being OK with being past your prime is OK, but don't fool yourself into thinking it's some sort of awesome golden age."
BenignExistence,fd6d5ny,t3_ejwb8f,1578189157.0,A lot of this depends on how old you are...if you're in your teens this is great and just a harmless goof but if you're in your 20s or god forbid your 30s then it's shall we say a different situation altogether.

And I feel like they would have had something a little more prepared than ""give a cheer for the rescue squad!"" if it was a planned gag. Even the guys at MSG have fuckups from time to time I'm sure. Like it was also a top level group of folks running stuff at Coachella a while back when Radiohead's rig went down and that sure as shit wasn't planned. Stuff happens, even at the highest level. Just glad the crew there had their shit together and were able to rectify it quickly and safely so Phish could get back to their next 17 minute jerk off session."

At that level you are basically assured that you are without a doubt hearing everything you should be hearing. 44/16 has more to do with fitting data on a CD, which is no longer a restriction, so IMO 48/24 is ideal. All bases covered and no sacrifices."
audioengineering,fctctzb,t3_eip3lw,1577939250.0,Hard to compare a 5 dollar pack that includes over a dozen plugins vs. a single EQ that's like 150 bucks...FF is fantastic but IMO the Slate package is a far better deal. The Eiosis EQ that comes with it (along with a shit ton of other stuff) is just as good as the FF Pro Q and at a fraction of the price. And certainly the Avid Complete Bundle is worth every penny of the 5 bucks and more.

When you take something out to use it, put it back in the opposite direction. And at the end of a year, only keep what’s in the opposite direction.'
