The Rebellion was basically a terrorist organization like ISIS who we sympathized with because the movies were told through their perspective.

Let’s do a play-by-play if why

First, MD is Medical Doctor, OD is Osteopathic Doctor.  The only major difference is a few hundred hours of bone realignment stuff.  MDs do tend to be slightly more competitive but other are physicians in full.

Second, you’re shitting on him for struggling to achieve his dream of being a Doctor and making it happen?  Seriously?  Like for real?

AskReddit,fc3vhwm,t3_eg1u3l,1577399684.0,"It was actually the DM.

I was playing a STRICT pacifist Cleric of Death.  Think Vow of Peace-levels of pacifism.

Well, we come upon this cursed weapon.  A +3 Heavy Flail that gave not one, but TWO extra attacks per round.  This thing is badass, but using it is essentially guaranteed trip to the Nine Hell’s upon death.  It was also the weapon of some powerful devil that had been stolen and we recovered it on accident.

Anyways. I’m carrying it because my character is the only one who won’t use it.  Everyone else would have to make constant Will Saves.

Well, the DM decides that this isn’t what he planned, so he begins making the Figjter roll Will Saves to avoid killing me to take the weapon.  

The Fighter fails, demands the weapon, and when I refuse, hits me. 

The DM is like, “Come on, you know you want to kill him for attacking you.”

“Nope.”

So the Fighter attacks again, crits for max damage, and I’m given a graphic (Mortal Kombat-level) fatality.

So the DM pulls me aside after the Fighter gets it and is like, “So, now that you’re dead—how do you feel about being resurrected by Bahaumet as a Dragonborn Paladin with a +5 Holy Avenger to get revenge?”

“She’s True Neutral, not Lawful Good.  She also believes in the finality of Death and that resurrection is an abomination.  And even if she was resurrected with all this stuff, she’d never willingly commit an act of violence.”

“But it’d be soooo cool!”

“But it’s not who she is.”

“He literally just killed you though.  You should want to kill him back.”

“My character literally views Murder as the the most grievous of all sins, even in self-Defense.  Not a chance, especially for revenge.”

“But this is why I decided to have him start making saves so he’d kill you and you could kill him back!”

This went on for a while, but needless to say, the group broke up after that."
