nvidia,ffq68tm,t1_ffq63x3,1580122735.0,Oh yea you'll want to upgrade before cyberpunk for sure. I dont know the requirements of MHW but know it is a fairly pretty MMO and it wouldn't say no to a boost in performance and VRAM.
technology,ffq629w,t3_eumdcu,1580122461.0,Non tech people in positions of power with control over how money gets spent. Out of touch folks everywhere in all levels of production in many areas other than tech
nvidia,ffq5zm1,t3_eume18,1580122349.0,"Still a great gpu overall, the answer to this depends on your needs/usage. There will always be another upgrade or rumors of the next thing by either company. If we all waited for the next lineup of parts, we would never upgrade."

trees,ffi0jqr,t3_etr66z,1579961372.0,How are you supposed to clear the bong with a sealed bowl? I've been smoking for over 10 years and dont think I've seen a piece like this. Is it glued in?

Scams,ffi05ks,t3_etr2cl,1579960991.0,"Almost 100% of anything that requires you to complete ""deals"" in return for a gift is a scam or used to steal your personal info in a never ending spiral of surveys and entering personal information. Best to avoid."

pcmasterrace,ffhz6b3,t3_etqvml,1579960008.0,PCMR is more of an ideal than a literal club. As long as PC is in your heart. You'll have a legit setup in no time. It doesnt have to break the bank.

bipolar,ffhyx7g,t1_ffhyl7i,1579959748.0,"Oof. I struggle with sleep sometimes but can attest along with others in this sub that getting as close to a solid 7-8 as you can, consistently, can do wonders for your stability as well as your energy throughout the day. I know this is easier said than done. Melatonin is a good way to assist this as well as even 30 mins on a treadmill walking normally. The effects of shitty sleep on your wellbeing compounds and can adversely affect your mood, even for neuro typical folks."

I know the depression den very intimately. Structure and having an organized environment will do loads for your mental health, and it has for mine so far. Got a job offer today from BofA, and have 2 upcoming interviews at different companies that will both likely pay higher. After 6 months of sending out job apps and going to interviews. You got this, keep up the momentum."
