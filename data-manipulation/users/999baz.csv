brexit,fftndql,t3_ev3r1a,1580224914.0,It’s already a fail . 200 billion down on EU remiainers already . Take 20 years to make that up at good growth rate if ever.  I expect we will drop out of G7 in a year or 2.

No deal , ok still want free trade? Fishing and freedom of movement first please.

Oh and btw services like banking (number 1 Uk business) we’ll put a few tariffs on that. 

I would laugh at brexiters gnashing teeth but I am about to loose my citizenship of the EU because they don’t like brown people. Fuck em!"

I watched it to the happy ending, got the girl lived happily ever after and it cut off. Yeh great film!

10 years later watched it again for a bit of nostalgia and saw the last 3 mins where the happy ending was actually a torture induced fantasy he had retreated into. I was like WTF!"

AskUK,fdrzn65,t3_emvwla,1578692127.0," Nah, lived in South, North and East London. Like any city , in some areas, you walk about a night like a target yes you might get some bother.  Confidence and not being glued to your phone on google maps you’ll be fine.

Yes, If I was a lone Black or Asian male, in some areas you might might find trouble with gangs. 

Also if I was a lone female at night. 

But as for Sharia law no go zones, that’s bollocks. Lived in Ilford (East London) for many years alongside some great Muslim friends. 

That said I Did come across some  proper wrong ‘uns - eg Al-Muhajiroun had a stall in the high street once, before they got banned. Had to challenge their literature  (9/11 stuff ) and got a mouth full back with ..I kid you not...-  “BOMB BRITAIN BOMB AMERICA!” 

Yes police got involved after that."

The film does not exonerate them . 12 men barging in filming a woman having sex . Doesn’t matter what she said or did on film after 12 men/lads joined in. 

Do people not get that dynamic is wrong and threatening to a woman alone, naked in a room in a crappy hotel in a foreign country. 

It’s not her responsibility to scream , fight and cry rape when she is probably trying to extricate herself out of a bad situation with baying lads around her. 

It’s the men’s responsibility to fucking understand that they were wrong to treat a girl like this"

ukpolitics,fdeqp21,t1_fdepcu1,1578344611.0,"Firstly being a stripper does not mean promiscuity and an invite to be raped. She can decide to have sex with 4,5,6 etc people so what,  what’s it to you?

The minute however just one of them joins in uninvited that’s rape and consent given previously to others is null and void.

Have you considered she might have felt unsafe after a bunch of men and boys (11 ) barged in , what does she do then,? Laugh and it off ? try to appease 1 or 3 of them in the hope she gets out safely? 

Yeh you don’t get it."
TwoXChromosomes,fddrhz9,t3_ejl9w5,1578322072.0,"Her consent ended when the others joined in uninvited. 

Just because she’s having sex with their mate does not give them all the green light. Let alone to put in on camera.

It would also be very difficult to extricate yourself safely out of that situation."
