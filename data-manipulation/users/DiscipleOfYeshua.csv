If you could see the expression of despair and confusion on his face when he says stuff like ""Ironically, communism is very isolating, you can't tell anyone what you really think or want. Living under communism...? We had to think one thing, say another, then do a third.""

""An older colleague in a factory I worked in explained to me once that 'you need to keep pushing yourself up, step on others, grab all you can at anyone's expense.' ... I asked him: 'But your sons work here too. Are you supposed to take advantage of them too?'"" 

One thing that struck me the most, we went to Newseum in DC. They had a section about the Berlin Wall, what was being published on either side of the wall, attempts to communicate across, etc.... reminder, my friend was serving nearby, in Communist Germany, as a tank driver for the Russian army which had conquered his own motherland....he was struck, he just couldn't move many times just gazing, and mumbling ""they did not tell us any of this.... they said those enemies on the other side are trying to consume us... that they are the bad ones.... that they are lethal... and desiring to destroy us..."" as he dragged himself from one photo to another article to another recording etc..."

Though, it is somewhat understandable why that misconception exists... after trying to share the Good News with holocaust survivors (I have one remaining uncle with a tattooed number on his forearm)... They saw with their own eyes how most of the Germans who called themselves ""Christians"" submitted and even supported the Nazis. Of course, there were also some Christians brave enough to risk/sacrifice their own lives to help save people from the Nazis, but sadly they were a small minority.... and of course there were others who persecuted Jews claiming to be pleasing God and fighting the good fight in previous generations... makes me wonder how many times I've carried God's name in vain, how many people have I misrepresented God to...
