You can be sorry because you decide to be sorry, not just because you feel sorry. Similarly, you can feel sorry but not actually be sorry, because you didn't make the decision to truly repent of your sin (look at all the people who feel guilty but then keep doing the thing they feel guilty about).

Let me give an analogy: If someone say, insults you, you might feel angry, but decide to not act on that anger. The feeling is a reaction you don't control, but your actions are what you choose. On the other hand, you might not ""feel"" angry but decide to get revenge on the person, just on principle. So what you will and what you feel are related, but not the same thing."

Webb's allegations were immediately investigated thoroughly by major news organizations like _The New York Times_ and the _Washington Post_ (the paper you may recall helped break the Watergate scandal, so not exactly scared of going against the government) and Webb's story was dismissed by everyone as not holding water. 

As for the scare quotes around ""suicide,"" yes Webb did in fact commit suicide. No one who knew him doubted it was a suicide, if you talk to any medical examiner you'll learn that people shooting themselves twice (even in the head) is very common in suicides (life isn't a movie, you don't always die immediately from gunshot wounds), and, the part anyone here would realize if they thought about it, _it makes no sense for the CIA to kill him suicide after he had already been discredited._ Realize that even if his theories had been true (which they weren't), the CIA would have _already won._ He had already been discredited by _independent news organizations._ What makes more sense, that a disgraced reporter would kill himself, or that the CIA would bring attention to the story and fan the flames by illegally killing an American, in America, in the most suspicious way possible?

> Webb's ex-wife, Sue Bell, discounted such theories Tuesday, saying the 49-year-old Webb had been distraught for some time over his inability to get a job at another major newspaper.

>""The way he was acting it would be hard for me to believe it was anything but suicide,"" Bell said.

>She said that before he died Webb wrote and mailed notes to family members and placed his baby shoes in his mother's shed.

There were also several government investigations launched into Webb's allegations which also found the claims to be baseless (I know, no one here will accept government investigations would ever admit to a scandal,, despite all the times government investigations have in fact uncovered scandals, like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, or the Iran-Contra affair).

You know how you can tell you believe a (bullshit) conspiracy theory? When the evidence that _disproves_ what you believe is used by you to _support_ your position. This is what is known in philosophy of science as a ""non-falsifiable theory."" You can't claim the evidence supports your position if you also claim that _contrary_ evidence would _also_ support your position. What you're really saying is you'll believe your own theory no matter what the evidence says.

However if you say ""It is going to rain tomorrow"" it can still be telling the truth (or lying) if you have a sufficient (even if not definite) reason for believing you know if it's going to rain.

BrandNewSentence,fevjw6a,t1_fevi1xt,1579398235.0,"Yes, but we are asking if it would be a lie if Pinocchio said something that he does not think he knows the truth of.

BrandNewSentence,fevgjof,t1_feu4zok,1579397120.0,"That is a very interesting philosophical question. It depends on what kinds of statements can be lies. According to most philosophical thought, there are a number of requirements for something to be a lie. First, it has to be a statement with a truth value. ""Are you in the kitchen?"" can't be a lie because it's a question, not an assertion; It doesn't purport to represent reality. It also has to be a representation of thought. A parrot can say ""Sally is in the kitchen,"" but it wouldn't be true or false because the parrot doesn't *think* about what it's saying, it's just imitating noise in a way that happens to resemble speech.

Now here's where it gets tricky, because ""lie"" can be used in two ways. The primary way, and the way it is clearly used in *Pinocchio,* is as a statement about the intentionality of the speaker. Does the speaker intend to state something which corresponds to reality? If not then they're lying, even if they're not wrong. If someone believes the earth to be flat and they say ""The earth is spherical"" then they're lying, even though what they've said is true. But in a looser way (that should probably be avoided) people sometimes use the word ""lie"" to just mean ""false.""

So using the primary sense of lying, is it lying to make a claim that you don't know the truth of? I believe it would be. Because even though it _could_ be the case that reality is such as you're describing it, your view of reality is not that it _is_ such, but that it _might_ be such. So if someone said to you, ""Sally is in the kitchen,"" simply because she _could_ be in the kitchen then that would be a lie, because ""is"" is more narrow than ""could be,"" and just as you cannot logically infer the fact that someone is somewhere because they _could_ be somewhere, you can't _truthfully_ say someone is somewhere just because they could be there. However I _do_ think you would be telling the truth if something is _likely_ true even if not definitely true. If you saw Sally in the kitchen a minute ago and have no reason to think she left, you can truthfully say she's there even though she could in theory have left, because every statement we make implicitly carries with it the idea that the reliability of the statement is only as sure as our capability of knowing the truth of the matter."

Then why would you hurt someone to stop them? If there's no universal principle you're defending, then what are you defending? You're saying that you explicitly believe your ethics are nothing more than a cultural accident, yet you'd hurt someone in order to impose them on that person? Why, if at the end of the day your beliefs are no more true than his?

>But you seem pretty sure that there is such thing as absolute morality. Do you have any evidence for this thesis? 

Yes, I do in fact have a moral system I ascribe to. And there are plenty of moral systems out there, many of which I disagree with, but at least provide a justification for condemning certain acts. But I commented not to sell any particular moral system, but to point out that moral relativism by its very nature clearly destroys any reason you might have for condemning anything, which seems to be something moral relativists refuse to accept, and something that I believe most people would disagree with if they clearly understood it."

Catholicism,fdsogx1,t1_fdsjwxb,1578705894.0,"Rule of law, something nearly universally supported, is predicated on the idea that you can in fact force people to do right. Free will is indeed a gift from God. But the law does not regulate peoples' wills, it regulates peoples' actions. The will itself, being by its essence free, is ultimately impossible to subjugate, though you may be able to coerce people to act against their will. You can't force a murderer to not will to murder, but you can stop him from actually committing a murder.

That's my big problem with people treating desire for money as the single cause of all evil, because it means that if someone does something which is not about acquiring money everyone assumes they must be doing the right thing. ""Donating to charity means he _loses_ money, so his charity must be doing good!"" Except people can support the wrong causes for reasons other than money."
