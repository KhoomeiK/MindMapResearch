Actually, they are used because they do not respond to pain by breaking off.  This is the terrier in the breed.  

I am a dog lover, and I am reasonably well educated on dog breeds.  I have met many pit bulls I loved that were wonderful dogs. That doesn't negate the fact that the breed itself was bred for a purpose, and that purpose was killing other animals.  They are very good at it too. We, are other animals.


Pit bulls were created by crossbreeding [bulldogs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog_breeds) and [terriers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrier) to produce a dog that combined the strength of the bulldog with the [gameness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameness) and agility of the terrier.[[6]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull#cite_note-United_Kennel_Club-6) "
