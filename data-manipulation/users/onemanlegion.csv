Then you start filling in what your prescription normally would have been with street shit. That gets expensive. One week you may not be able to fill your rx, or the doctor wont prescribe them anymore. Now somebody comes along and Introduces you to H. You dont jump straight into Injections, you may never inject but that gram of H lasted you what 15 pills did. So you start buying H instead.
