nba,ffsnj4o,t1_ffshd9r,1580186303.0,"I think the first headline I saw worded it as Kobe passed away. So my mind automatically connected it to LeBron passing Kobe, I was like: ""why TF is this breaking news?"" Then I realized and my heart just sank.

I don't usually get too affected by celebrity deaths, but Kobe has hit hard. He was my first real idol, my rolemodel for so many years. And it felt like he was just at the beginning of a grand adventure in retirement, I was looking forward to seeing so many great things from him from beyond the court.

I always just assumed that in 2068, you'd tune in to see a Lakers game and they'd turn the camera to the crowd and you'd see good old grandpa Kobe with that big grin on his face for the cameras. Never could've imagined this."

I think last time I managed to make it zoom out more, but I couldn't get the centering thing to work. So I was trying to change it and then played Nuke and I could only see T spawn on my radar lol

So if you could teach me I'd die to know how to make it work. I've obviously already tried every result on the first couple of pages of Google but I've kinda given up at this point"
todayilearned,ffiw3n0,t1_ffitddt,1579984117.0,"But that's part of the DNA. Other than because it's based on a fantasy novel series, you could say that Quidditch is intended to be played with one hand. The stick indicates which hand you're using."
GlobalOffensive,ffi9fwh,t1_ffi4lt8,1579968486.0," But - and I'm not an expert so please correct me if I'm wrong - isn't it true that you don't need all colors to create black? So, fx if you shine a red light on a truly black object, it would still be black (reflect no color) even though only the red color is present?

Whereas to experience white, you'd *need* all colors to be present?"

But of course all the promotional material etc. would be about Waldo. And then he's onscreen for exactly half a second.

That said has no one ever tried to cash in on Waldo? He's a pretty fucking recognizable brand, now that I think about it I'm surprised the dude doesn't have a children's TV show and 3-4 really bad movies swept under the rug. I mean, unless he does and I'm just stupid.

Edit: yeah, ofc he has 2 TV shows, including one that's ongoing. And several studios have been pursuing the movie."
GlobalOffensive,ffe47zt,t1_ffdyttk,1579836269.0,"Nah you should keep your PC cool.

Although, I play with lower res because I legit think it looks better. 4:3 stretched with low video settings gives me some legit vibes that I can't even describe. It's like the little fat guys with their bubbleheads and the way everything looks, it's almost a nostalgic feeling. Also with the color thingy from Nvidia that makes everything pop and people use it for better visibility - i might have awful taste, but I love it. CSGO in 4k looks great, and I could run it fine. But there's something super charming about it, so I can't let it go.

I started way back because I realized some pros were playing 4:3 and I wanted to be cool, I admit that. But now it's been like 8 years and I've never had a problem with it. So I'll stick with my wide little soldiers"

todayilearned,ffcaki8,t1_ffbi6ak,1579795270.0,"Dude, i remember I was on holiday in turkey once, and stayed in this tiny little resort with maybe 4-6 apartments total.

So during the stay we get to know most of the staff and the owners (family of 4), and on one of the days it's their daughters 2nd birthday. So they invite us all to stay at the resort that day and they'll provide us food and entertainment to celebrate.

That entire day they had chefs making food non-stop and it's the best fucking food I've ever had in my entire life. It is actually one of my best memories, period. In the evening they even had traditional Turkish dancers and singers and they taught us some of their moves and songs. It was just such a great cultural experience and they certainly spared no expense to care for their guests. Such friendly people with such an underrated culture. 11/10 would recommend.

Edit: oh yeah, and on the night before, one of the staff at the resort asked us if we wanted to join him. He was gonna go fishing in the dead of night to surprise the owners with fresh fish for the birthday. So at 2am we set out with a case of beer in a little boat to fish for the birthday. Just so many great little experiences :D"

Minecraft,ff97fpt,t1_ff8vguo,1579706602.0,"Items dropped in the gameworld automatically disappear after some time. When you die, you drop all your items. If you are far from your spawn-point when you die, you have to quickly run back and get them all before they disappear. So it's often a bit of a rush to get them back."
Minecraft,ff8hphq,t3_es3d8m,1579678988.0,"I would've done exactly the same thing at 6 years old. I was just always so immersed in my fantasy worlds. I didn't have actual Minecraft chests (ok, we didn't have Minecraft back then) but then I'd have used some other storage furniture and just pretended it was a Minecraft chest only and my mom would've been so annoyed with me lmao.

On the other hand, the doctors used to say my imagination was a sign of my intelligence, so I'm guessing you might have a brainy little dude on your hands :D"

GlobalOffensive,ff2gna3,t1_ff2feu4,1579505308.0,"It is, I just tested it out again to be sure. You can check for yourself in console with cl_debug_print_accuracy 1

Keep in mind that I said ""full reset"", not where it becomes accurate enough to be usable

The deagle has an accurate range of 24,58m

After 1 second, you can hit targets at 17,10m

After 2 seconds, it has reset to 23,68m

3 seconds = 24,49m

Somewhere over 3 seconds, but under 4 seconds, the deagles range resets to 24,58m.

I hope that clears things up and/or is useful!"
GlobalOffensive,ff1z5o2,t1_ff1r9m9,1579489571.0,"I'm pretty sure the full reset time for deagle while standing is just short of 4 seconds. If you crouch, you can cut it to about 2 seconds."
