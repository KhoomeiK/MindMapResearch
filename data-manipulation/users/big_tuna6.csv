With medication it came back but especially after starting the Nuvaring I've noticed a significant difference in the strength and shine of my hair.
Nuvaring,feju6wc,t3_epe34p,1579185938.0,"For me: 

No weight gain

Less heavy periods

Shorter periods

One day of PMDD but very intense

Low sex drive mostly but once initiated all good

High sex drive around period (3-5 days before and after) 

Clear skin

Fuller hair

Healthier nails"

uAlberta,fdj84mg,t1_fdieqtu,1578461165.0,"Hand written notes might be difficult in concept heavy classes with the prof talking a mile a minute like Scavuzzo's. I type in those otherwise in schematic heavy classes I use my surface. 

Also try to:
-read ahead or just skim the lecture notes the day before; repetition is key

-people put a lot of emphasis on understanding, which is definitely right but don't cheap out on memorizing; understanding how the heart functions is great but not good for the exam if you forget systolic and asystolic pressures, volume, electrical potentials during each heart beat etc. 

-make study materials as you go along; using exam study time to make the study guides is a horrible use of time; you should be actively learning by that point; highlighting is useless

-source: am third year honors neuro, doing quite well."

Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. But I just held out because what if tmr would be better? And after a year and a half, it finally was better. 
I know how much it hurts to not live up to your own expectations in whatever way it may be. But you can always count on a better TMR. It actually might be TMR, next week or two years from now but when it finally comes, it's the most rewarding feeling that you took a bet on yourself and you won."
