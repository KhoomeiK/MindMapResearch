I don't think I felt like I *knew* what was going on until we saw Ed Harris and Javier Bardem in the bathroom with some kind of wound, I remember saying, ""I wonder if his wife will show up."" The rest only fell into place after that."

flicks,ff9ho4l,t1_ff9cy0t,1579713230.0,"Man, how does someone who grew up religious NOT view that movie as Mother Nature Vs. God ?

I watched it with a friend who was raised in a secular environment. I found the religious allegories to be rather heavy handed (not in a bad way) while he didn't notice a lot of them until they were explained to him.

Glad your friend got some guidance and enjoyment out of it, definitely a polarizing movie"
ottawa,ff7kd3l,t3_es3jqo,1579651606.0,"I bought these in 2007 for 5 dollars. I was with a group of about 6 kids, we had free time on our Grade 8 trip to Ottawa. I think he was by a Chapters or something because I remember we asked him if we wanted something from Starbucks and we wanted one of the frappucinos we were drinking. 

We brought him one and sat and chatted for maybe half an hour, he was so nice to us and said he tried to talk to kids like they were little adults, because he knows what it's like to not be treated like a person.

I've always wondered about him and was hoping someone would know how he's doing !"

toronto,ff4fbcd,t1_ff48duk,1579562243.0,"It has for a long time. I remember several years ago, a female friend who had just been accepted wasn't sure she wanted to go because she didn't want to live on a campus with such a bad reputation for assaults. When she did eventually go, she was always very paranoid about walking alone."
aww,feedcd4,t1_fee4tsh,1579031418.0,"Yes! My parents read a picture book called, ""Why Was I Adopted,"" to my adopted sister and I since we were very small. We loved that book, we'd often ask them to read it just because it was a cute and funny book.

There was no traumatic conversation, no light bulb moment, just an open and honest conversation about who we were from the time we were infants. 

... In retrospect, maybe it helps that my parents adopted transracially hahaha some things you have to explain early."

There once was a girl who was 13. Her bra size was 84, but she wanted it to be 45. So she went to the doctor and he said OH, (0) take 2 pills. Except (x) she took 4. And guess what? She became 55378008.
