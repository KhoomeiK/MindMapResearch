AskReddit,fffgke7,t3_etcg31,1579883492.0,"A couple of years ago, I went to an Interpol concert, a friend bailed on me, so in the end, as I was alone, I joined the people waiting on the back doors for the band. I never did something like that because with friends you usually go somewhere else after the concert.

After a while, the band went out and I was on the front, then Daniel Kessler (guitarist) is in front of me signing my ticket and I was so amazed (they are my favorite band) that out of nowhere I said to him ""Is this real life?"" Then in silence, he made a movement with his hand like saying ""wait a minute"" and took off a guitar pick from his pocket and give it to me. Man, that made me feel special.

He's an awful boss, he steals from people, he screams at them (sometimes with no reason), etc. He's kind of like Ebenezer Scrooge, people usually go to work there because they are desperate for money but end up quitting after a while. One time a new girl was working on the offices, she got yelled on her first day ( like everyone does there), then she went to lunch and just never came back, not even to quit. Just 4 hours and she had enough of him."

relationship_advice,ff85lu0,t3_es6cny,1579666631.0,"Hi there! I'm sorry that happened to you, those high school relationships are really meaningful, I mean you actually grow up with the person, it's a special bond .... but the thing is that you grow up and if the boy you meet once is no the same as a man and it harms you in any way then you did the right thing. I have been through that, for me it was 8 years, she was my first love, and she broke up for her own sake, I was really troubled at the time and she couldn't take it anymore, now I'm a better man and as far as I know she's happier. Practical advice: Keep the good memories and be thankful you got those, maybe he wasn't the one but that's just life, just take what's good and keep your mind in whats best for you and time will do the rest"

We all have baggage and sometimes when we are drunk we reveal it, but if you lose those people over that let me tell you those are not friends to keep. It happened to me something similar, in my early days of college I finally started to get some friends and the first night we went to drink I was so young and sad about a break up that I drank more than I should, at the end of the night I was screaming her name and swearing loudly (all happened on a small room) , I was so drunk i couldn't walk, so they gave me water and put me into bed, yeah I was so ashamed but 6 years later they are my best friends and they prove it since the first day"
relationship_advice,ff832rc,t3_es632j,1579664689.0,"First: it sounds a little bit more like he's obsessed with you not in love.

Second: as a guy I can tell you that there's a really strong pressure from society and other men for us to show our worth as man, and one way to show that its in the women's area. unfortunately for guys that are not good with girls, they start to get frustrated and develop unhealthy patterns. Let me tell you that many harmless things that you might do or say, for a guy like that they would be enough to get his hopes up. I'm not saying it's your fault, of course, it's just that they tend to believe that for some unknown reason a woman that it's attracted to them might hide it and it's up to them to ""get the girl"". But in real life, if a girl likes you back you'll know for sure. I'll say that for your own sake and his you should have a very direct conversation and set boundaries, as I said before this kind of men will take any ""signal"" to support the theory you like them, so to be straightforward with them is the best way to have a healthy friendship.

It is what it is, people like us sometimes need breaks others don't but it's ok, just don't push yourself in a wrong way, and the most important thing is that right now its just college, take a semester off and get stronger, don't let anxiety grows on you anymore, believe me, it would be so much harder to take a break when you are actually working and trying to make a career, it's not failure its being responsible with yourself and thinking ahead"

Start with baby steps , for example don't try to get yourself into a crowded party all at once, try meeting people on places and situations where you feel safe, just don't let anxiety be as powerful on you... im telling you, if I knew how bad it would get for me, when I was 21 I would completely change my actions, these days my anxiety is mainly physical, panic attacks all the way down, nauseas and headaches all the time and it's not im my control anymore at all... so just don't let it grow on you, take it easy and in a couple of years you'll be fine, you are the one that needs to become stronger not the anxiety"
