China is communist at heart, capitalist at mind and fascist in body."
todayilearned,fe4dnrr,t1_fe3bo6l,1578858173.0,That's why someone like Trump and his brazenly ignorant gorilla troupe bother me so. Reversing regulations that were put in place for a very good reason. And for what? All just to serve the corporate agenda of those on top.
