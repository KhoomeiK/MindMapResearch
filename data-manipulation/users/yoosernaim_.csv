atheism,fd5tdzv,t3_ek26zk,1578181294.0,"I'm an atheist.....so probably that last person that you will probably listen to. But, I know there are church groups who are not anti LGBTQ. You may just have to create a group that is technically outside the church. But don't give up. I'm just thinking of some LGBTQ teen out there who is struggling and wants the comfort and guidance of a church family.........maybe they believe in God, maybe their family is awful. 

If you can't find the group you want, create it, I'm sure you're not the only one searching.

If you're truly atheist because you don't believe there are any gods, then fine. But if you do consider yourself a christian, but don't want to associate with churches, because they are the worst, you can be a beacon for others in your shoes. 

Have theses experiences made you stop believing in god or organized religion?

Atheists are good friends to have.....but there are militant atheists too....they also suck. Just find good, accepting people, no matter their belief system."

It infuriates me to tears when people, who have never taught, say that teachers have no right to complain about pay, resources, class sizes, hours/week because we ""knew what we were getting into"" and shouldn't have become a teacher.
