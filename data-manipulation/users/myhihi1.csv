nottheonion,ffim8i9,t1_ffhjcv7,1579977241.0,It's not really accurate in that it doesn't simulate how viruses tend to become less lethal over time.
StarWarsLeaks,ffeemt1,t1_ffdx6vo,1579845140.0,They should just release all of their anthology films on Disney+ since a lot of people don't feel like going to the theater to see them. Star Wars movies are still seen as event films so people will only bother with the main ones and skip out of the spin-offs which so far haven't been important. If they were on Disney+ more people would bother to watch them. I just hope we get more of the spin-off films because the Crimson Dawn seemed like it could have been an interesting reoccurring antagonist. An entire series about the criminal underworld might have been pretty cool but Solo was a box office disappointment so we'll probably never see what Lucasfilm had planned for the organization.
StarWarsLeaks,ffedmin,t1_ffdz9ye,1579844146.0,Television is just so limiting. Star Wars is known to push the special effects envelope and while the Mandalorian has pretty impressive special effects for a TV show it still is held back by having to distribute a movie's budget among eight half hour long episodes. I'm all for more Star Wars shows but the big epic stories definitely need to be done in movie form because television doesn't have the budget for it. There's also no reason the movies should feel crammed because if they are abandoning the trilogy format they can draw the stories out for as long as they need to.
StarWars,ffe8ow7,t1_ffe6m1e,1579839745.0,I'm not complaining about it I'm just saying a few of the planets have realistic typography and other do not.
StarWarsLeaks,ffe60c0,t1_ffdyjyb,1579837616.0,TRoS is basically fan theories the movie and I don't think it really helped the story at all. JJ basically frankensteined everything fans asked for and it turned into a mess in my opinion.
StarWarsLeaks,ffe53ca,t1_ffdwgqi,1579836921.0,The Obi-Wan show is almost certainly going to be a mini series and probably have no episodes that don't advance the overall plot. If it's a miniseries I think that makes it a lot different than the Mandalorian.
StarWars,ffe462l,t1_ffdyrel,1579836230.0,"Desert, Ice, and Lava worlds make sense at least. Dagobah being a giant swamp is where it breaks from reality."
StarWars,ffe3zxt,t1_ffe18nj,1579836103.0,Coruscant at least is supposed to be pretty much exactly like Earth but the entire planet has been built over. So it's probably the only biome diverse planet in Star Wars. I know Alderaan had some decent variety but I think it was only temperate biomes.

SequelMemes,ffba05r,t1_ff9xs1v,1579756802.0,I disliked how they had to use the opening crawl to explain that Palpatine's return is just some general knowledge in the galaxy instead of building up to it throughout the movie. It would have been cool if they kept it a secret before the film released and revealed him half way through the movie.

I really do think Yoda's species is pretty rare and mysterious even in the Star Wars universe. Just because there were two of them on the Jedi council doesn't mean they were common. If they were common and predominantly force sensitive (which seems to be the case) then I would expect the entire Jedi council would be made up of them since they live nearly a millennium and are probably the most force sensitive humanoid species in the Star Wars universe. The Jedi actively searched for force sensitive babies to bring into the order so it isn't too surprising that there could be two members of a super rare species in the order especially if they're extremely force sensitive."

[On a per capita basis the United States doesn't even consume the most energy in the world.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/countries-with-highest-energy-users-per-person-2014-10) Overpopulation isn't as much of a problem as the general population believes it to be and cutting the population in half or in a third isn't going to make much of a difference in regards to climate change.

StarWarsBattlefront,feiwwao,t3_epaedq,1579149442.0,The skins the developers make are higher quality so I'd rather they make them themselves. Not saying the modders aren't talented just that the developers have more time to work on the skins since they're doing it full time and not as a hobby.

GalaxysEdge,fehpqmp,t1_fehcw14,1579121417.0,"They've basically said they will adapt it to other eras overtime.

It's just hard for me to believe those people like Filoni's work as much as they say they do when they only associate him with the Clone Wars. I still think Rebels is his best show so far since it's only focused on one group of characters so you see a lot of great character growth in the few seasons it ran for while the Clone Wars is all over the place and most episodes can be seen as filler because of that, especially the political ones."

Stormtroopers in particular have literally no skins. Droids have like four, and the rebels/resistance have a bit more but they're mostly just head swaps.
