fasting,ff5been,t3_erachk,1579586121.0,"I've had three total meals since January 9th. One on January 9th, one on the 17th, and one on the 18th. 

I've been either extended water fasting or doing daily OMAD with large deficits for 7+ months now, lost over 100lbs, and I have to admit that I am extremely fatigued. I'm burned out, hungry, emotionally spent, and starting to underperform at work. 

Just a few more days of water fasting, and I'm going to go onto some OMAD closer to maintenance for a bit. I've become addicted to the progress. It's going to be odd as hell in the long run when I no longer have excess fat to lose."
fasting,ff5aoht,t3_erge4i,1579585409.0,"I gain like 5-6 pounds over the course of a few days, and am generally back to the fast end weight within a week or so."
fasting,ff5acup,t3_ermaa5,1579585101.0,"Don't psych yourself up too much. Get ready to ride the highs and the lows of the process and take things one hour at a time. 

Make sure your sleep hygiene is on point, as sleeping becomes more difficult."

fatlogic,ff2xoiw,t1_ff2g5oi,1579527925.0,"360lbs to 235lbs in just over half a year. Non-surgical gastric bypass, aka extended water fasting. When it comes to binging, going cold turkey on food for a while was the answer."
fatlogic,ff1qoov,t1_ff1qg09,1579484060.0,"I would get four cheeseburgers at Burger King pretty regularly, with two slices of cheese on each. If they forgot the extra cheese, I'd go back in and sometimes get four additional cheeseburgers without needing to give the other ones back. Eight cheeseburger dinner. Maybe hit Dairy Queen on the way home for good measure. 


lol binge eating. Instead of eating for satiety/elimination of hunger, eating as much as you could within the limits of over-satiety and physical inability to continue. Wouldn't get hungry for months at a time.

Of course the only reason I ever gained weight or had health/interpersonal problems was because of stigma and mean thin people."
fatlogic,ff13vc8,t3_er2wwc,1579474951.0,Prolonged extended fasting without any activity would make a lot more sense than what was done on that show. Would make for some really boring television.
fatlogic,feuy3ca,t3_eqhfl0,1579391057.0,"Anyone here been to therapy after shedding life long morbid obesity? Curious to hear how experiences with that have gone.

Or if not that, has anybody else experienced worsening mental health with rapid weight loss?"
fatlogic,feiamxh,t1_fegld79,1579134048.0,"Happy for your results and progress. 

I'm pretty sure my hatred is permanent. I actually become less stable mentally and more dissatisfied as the fat comes off. It was pleasantly numb before. Regaining mobility and such is nice to be sure."
fatlogic,fefbbhh,t3_eorlnp,1579052554.0,"No different than complaining about how little your job pays around somebody who you know full well makes significantly less money than you. It makes you kind of a dick. 

The talk of therapy is obviously stupid. There's nothing wrong with being horrified at the idea of looking like an obese person."
