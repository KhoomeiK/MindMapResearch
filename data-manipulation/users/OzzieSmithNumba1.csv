bipolar,ffhf62v,t1_ffh728y,1579932678.0,Therapy + meds is the most effective approach according to professional/academic research. The right enough meds and the right enough therapist. Glad to see your post after so many meds only posts.
bipolar,fei2rtx,t1_feh54pf,1579129013.0,"Exactly. Bipolar simply means you get some version of depressed and some version of manic. There are mixed episodes where you can experience both concurrently. Being moody isn't the same as a mood disorder. That being said, my manic states include quick mood swings. So who knows. Doctors are a pain, but they're helpful."
bipolar,fehzht5,t1_fehy3sw,1579127024.0,"You can still smoke, just watch out for it making you more low than usual. Seroquel mellows you enough already, so more mellowing can turn you into a messy couch potato who feels shitty for not getting enough done."

konmari,fehpv77,t3_ep6hsl,1579121490.0,"I realized I enjoy a large wardrobe, partly bc I enjoy thrifting so much. I finally landed on the idea that I need to commit to ""wardrobe maintenance."" For me that was packing away of season clothing, too big or too small pieces, and segregating everything between daily use, fancy use, practical use, and costume pieces."
BipolarReddit,fefn41t,t1_feflqt4,1579059929.0,"My dude wakes me up for 2 mintues of cuddling before I let him outside/feed him. He's been remarkably helpful at keeping me on a better schedule. I ignored his cues for bedtime long enough for him to stop giving them. I get fairly down 2-3 consecutive days a month. When he starts acting like an asshole, I know it's time to get us up and going, so he gets me back outside."
FundieSnark,fefky69,t1_fefcmh0,1579058529.0,It's the only time I've read an argument like this. I wasn't aware God was denying love to nonbelievers. That sounds like an old testament God. Something like that.
FundieSnark,fe4tvwv,t1_fe0ey6n,1578862718.0,I just remember sizing out early bc my chest went past a c cup. I felt really awful about not fitting into the clothes everyone else did. That was back in the days where Abercrombie Jr sold cherry printed thongs. Yikes.
FundieSnark,fe029c3,t1_fdzj027,1578801268.0,You size out of their clothes quickly at puberty? Maybe it's some internalized body shaming.
AskWomen,fdpwpof,t1_fdpwe31,1578643681.0,"They run frequent sales. I did 6 for $20 after Christmas.  Additionally, their online sales are fairly expansive with deep discounts. ALSO their lounge wear is the beeeeesssssssstttttt but so much better when it's $15 on sale instead of $70 in store."
FundieSnark,fdpvwvp,t3_emjiep,1578642697.0,"A few thoughts from an ex-fundie-lite, bipolar 1, junior therapist (certified, awaiting licensure). The nonstop Jesus-speak seems to be a cultural dialect of sorts. My Facebook feed is 25% former fundie friends and they're just using the shorthand, churchy phrases as code for....so much. Much as ""bless her heart"" is code for ""hey y'all, want to hear some new dirt on Amber?"" Conversational fundie. 

I've seen instances where strong faith, including the concept of heaven, contributes to suicidality. The sin language obviously leads to a shit ton of internalized, malignant shame. That'll bust up your sense of worth, self esteem, self concept, and hope. Enter depression and other mood disorders, anxiety and other anxiety disorders. Abstinence education leads to sexual dysfunction (plus mood/anxiety disorders), even when everyone waits as told. Body dysmorphia after years of being told your boobs are too tempting and that you should bind them. Anorexia/bulimia provides false control. If one is deep in such a church, leaving means losing a social support system. Even if that system was damaging, having no support system is also damaging. Isolation leads to disorders previously mentioned. 

Looking at sexuality and gender expression, sin language and rightwing hatred of LGBTQ has shown to increase homophobia/transphobia, including the internalized kind. This population has incredibly high rates of mental illness, heavily influenced by internalized stigmatization. The trans population has the highest rates of suicide and homicide. 

These churches promote irrational thinking (pray for forgiveness), ego deflation (women shut up), and group think/pressure (I noticed you missed Wednesday's services). Dysthymia (low grade depression) can be seen in women who are chronically indecisive due to their needs being ignored for...forever, really. 

Mental illness isn't understood very much. Most disorders are said to the result of biopsychosocial influences. Meaning, they can be triggered by anything and everything. It all gets so confounded. Rates of mental disorders in this population are hard to know because the most fundie faithful aren't likely to seek secular healing. Getting manic and talking to people about ""the true meaning of Christ"" for 4 months got me in the hospital for 8 days. If I were still in my church (with a penis) I might have landed myself a missionary post for 8 months."

BipolarReddit,fdmnswn,t3_em5pd0,1578557198.0,"I wouldn't worry about feeling too good and energetic as long as you're getting ample sleep. My doc and shrink tell me that if I'm getting 8 hrs a night, I won't climb the stairs up to mania. But, I'm not your doctor, obvs. I, too, get anxiety when I'm doing well. The balancing act messes with my rational thinking.

ETA: schedule some self care, downtime, exercise. Hyper productive bursts usually leave me with a cold or other ailment if I don't force myself to chill out."
BipolarReddit,fdmnixa,t3_em6bzf,1578556854.0,"Hugs! If you're 18+, I'd let your doctor know. Doctor might not be thrilled, but you're allowed to decide what goes into your body. Doctor might want to see you much more frequently. I'd suggest therapy if it's available to you. Having one, preferably two licensed health professionals keeping an eye on you is important at this time. 

When someone is manic, they aren't as willing to get help. From my perspective it's not bc ""mania is fun"" but bc when I'm manic, I feel so sincerely that I'm finally my true self. 

Signed: a person who had 10 year depression lift, followed by a 4 month manic state, followed by a crisis trip into inpatient for 8 days, followed by outpatient for 4 weeks, followed by a 2 month rebuilding out of state. I didn't get to go home for 3+ months. But when I did, my house was sparkling clean. Apologies for any misspellings. My giant lithium dose makes my hands shakey as fuck."
antiMLM,fdmeqql,t3_em1rxm,1578547485.0,"Sounds like a MLM hun. She probably works in how to ask such personal questions with everyone she knows. Everyone she meets. Just be sure to check with your pharmacist before adding any supplements. And if she asks how it's going, you can tell her it's dangerous to accept drugs from anyone but your doctors."
bipolar,fdm6xac,t3_em0tzw,1578541291.0,"It's good to read that you're doing better. I was diagnosed at an inpatient facility. I was as manic as a freight train. The first thing the psychiatrist said was ""sooo...if I told you you we're bipolar, what would you think?"" My manic brain exploded like a manic tv detective finally figuring out THE thing. I felt a lot more compassion for myself and some past troubles. The drugs are a bummer, but I'm much less of a wreck. Godspeed with your new diagnosis!"

FundieSnark,fdm1deq,t1_fdllxl8,1578537489.0,My church growing up brought eyeglasses to Ukraine. The mission team would come back and boast about all of the souls saved. I always figured people just showed up for the glasses. Kind of like a sitting through a timeshare pitch to get a cheap vacation.
FundieSnark,fdl9stk,t1_fdl0l6u,1578519485.0,Same. I was told that I asked too many questions for a girl. I was in a church where women couldn't publically lead anything aside from kids. Left the church at 18 to run away to a women's college.
unpopularopinion,fdgosyn,t1_fdfx5ym,1578404294.0,"The OP has some looney tunes motions. I'm Stateside here. The habit of non-native Americans to claim outside heritage is totally understandable. It wasn't long ago that Irish immigrants only interacted with Irish immigrants, Italian with Italian. I'm able to track my family to 1600s colonial US, but I know where those family members came from. In a country as young and diverse as the US, it's normal to wonder which older cultures we come from.

The DNA tests told me I'm 75% English, small percentage Scottish, Irish. I know I'm not *actually* English, but I enjoy picturing my ancestors living there in the way back times."
FundieSnark,fdf9w8t,t1_fdea0ba,1578356712.0,I don't understand being all about Paul yet still throwing out old testament laws. The very Paulian church I grew up in got around the gay stuff by saying Paul didn't mention marriage between man/man so it's bad. We also didn't use instruments in worship bc Paul never mentioned it.
