I also have problems with histamine... and whatever I could eat, that doesn't contain fructose or histamine..  -> tastes like shit and not worth the calories.

So I am basically eating sweets  and fruit all day long -.-"

I skip lunch on workdays because my mom won't notice that I didn't eat. But my coworker always joke about it.  Some people can do it in a cute and funny way and I am okay with that. But there are others who make jokes to other people about it, which starts a whole conversation where 5 people discuss my eating when I'm sitting there with my coke zero... And I goddamn hate it."

EDAnonymous,fezvl3t,t3_eqsilu,1579462225.0,"I have some food intolerances... and I have this discussion constantly in my head:

I want  to eat something that I like (junk food), but then I get horrible painful cramps and that's so much calories... so I could eat something that doesn't cause me painful cramps, but it's not worth the calories it contains and I don't like it.

When I am REALLY hungry, I'm in such a bad mood because I can't decide what to eat that I cause horrible fights with everyone I love and then I cry for hours because it feels like that's my life and it won't ever change... (it didn't change the last 10 years).  


It's always either not tasting good enough, has too many calories or causes painful cramps."

It just happens a lot and I tried to be a better person for years, but people never notice my change in behaviour. If it was lesson, then I learned that no matter how much I try to change, others won't do the same for me and that I won't ever be good enough for them."

why"
EDAnonymous,feekbvb,t3_eojbou,1579035490.0,"I had a similar situation.  A while ago (years) I wanted to open up about all this ... i thought my best friend, who was suffering from depression, would understand. He said that he doesn't want to hear it. So I didn't talk about it anymore or further... But then he  needed help and I was there for him,  helped him listened. Then he asked me how I've been feeling  and that I can talk to him too, if I ever feel the need. Yeah I do feel the need, but I don't talk to him openly anymore. I just can't."

depression,fdvz7ep,t1_fdvxo6n,1578753366.0,"Yeah exactly. I'm studying, I go to work, I do things. But these things are all way too exhausting and I wish I could stay in bed forever.  I need my weekends at home to recharge energy for the week, otherwise I would have killed myself already... 

But being home on friday night, crying in bed, watching a movie, cuddled up with a hot water bottle ... it's just too comforting... I don't want to give that up."
aspergers,fdvxmvb,t3_en6pdh,1578752898.0,"I don't know if I have aspergers. It's not often diagnosed where I live because most doctors dont know much about it and I have never been to a doctor because of it. 

But I made a long and serious online test and tried to answer these questions as truthfully as I could and I expected to be in the ""You could have aspergers, but most likely not"" category, but I was in the full on ""90% of aspergers have this result, you might go to a psychiatrist to be sure"" category. 

And I have to say that I feel the same way as you do. 

When I get introduced to new people it's exhausting as fuck to make a good expression. I'm working in the medical field and I leave work everyday with a headache because all those social interactions are draining me. And I notice that my  ""mask"" fades when I get to know people better. I'll zone out and just stare at something, and they start to think I'm weird. There are thousands of small situations when people think I'm weird, but they act as  if I should just stop being like that, but I can't.  I don't know how."
depression,fdvw9cy,t3_en7336,1578752359.0,"I don't know what it is, but I feel the same. I want to get better, but I like  being alone at home, lying in bed. It's comforting. And it sounds exhausting as fuck to go out and have fun.  
After all these years happy people annoyed me with all their comments and plans and I kinda don't want to be one of them. 

It just feels like that's who I am."

Men aren't looking at me or approaching me. When I'm somewhere with a female friend, men are always flirting with them, but never with me.
