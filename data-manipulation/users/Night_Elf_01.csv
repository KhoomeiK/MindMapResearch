BadMUAs,ff8pkbo,t3_erztji,1579690530.0,I wonder what this makeup looks like in person. I always think instagram makeup looks good in photos but too much in person.

I just sent him a message saying how that comment bothered me and for him to please not make that kind of comments in front of me. That women can appear naked on TV the same way a man can. 
I’m currently going to acting lessons so his conclusion from that message was:
So if you had to be naked on TV you would do the same?
And then proceeded to get mad at me."
TwoXChromosomes,fdenzlw,t1_fden7al,1578343028.0,"I’ve just sent him a message saying how that comment bothered me and for him not to say those kind of comments to me. I said that I totally get him not liking seeing nudity on tv, not everyone does. But an actress can appear naked on tv the same way a man can, although it is true what you said, they do tend yo exploit the women more than the men. Hopefully the older he gets he starts to understand more, I try to talk to him about these things but he just doesn’t understand or doesn’t want to. 

Also, GoT for me only has 7 seasons haha. I love that series so much and I got so excited watching the first episode again haha"
