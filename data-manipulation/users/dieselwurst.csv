news,ffpg4ph,t1_ffpfim0,1580094209.0,"Please downvote me. You don't know shit about firearms, end of story. You miss the entire point, obviously. I carry a gun daily with a round in the chamber. To do otherwise is to invite trouble. If crap has gotten bad enough to need to pull a gun, that gun damn well be ready to use immediately. You don't carry a modern revolver with an empty chamber; that would be stupid (and you don't fucking carry a vintage one; that would be stupid too).

Guns have safeties to prevent accidental discharge. Even ones without external safeties. What this guy did wasn't accidental. It was negligence. There is a considerable difference."
news,ffpdslc,t1_ffpdcis,1580092533.0,"Guns don't just ""go off"", even with a round in the chamber. In fact, that's how guns are typically meant to be carried! It's not unsafe in any way unless you carry a Single Action Army. For this gun to go off, something pulled the trigger. Could be a snag or a stray finger, but let's not blame the inanimate object working as intended."

news,ffok5ve,t1_ffhpuh5,1580078444.0,Yep. Just because your insurance doesn't cover something doesn't mean you're magically of the hook for damages.
politics,ffjvqdr,t1_ffjted5,1580008269.0,I agree. But your acceptance of billionaires is as well. Accepting and expecting them act against the community's interest is no different than accepting that slavery exists despite it being wrong.
politics,ffjt2zc,t1_ffjsawt,1580006195.0,I guess slavemasters are okay as long as we accept that they will mistreat their property?
politics,ffgzv30,t1_ffgxlia,1579919351.0,"If the kids are hungry, they will eat. 

If the kids are not so hungry that they're willing to skip a meal because of its contents, they are likely not starving and it's not the end of the world if they wait until they get home to eat their more privileged diet."

AskReddit,fey8il9,t1_fey3i3z,1579442089.0,Second rule. At least wipe the poop knife before you put it back in the kitchen drawer.
