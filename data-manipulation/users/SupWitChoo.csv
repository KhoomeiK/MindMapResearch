If you restrict guns and the total guns available are smaller that 10% will be a smaller number. How is this fact totally lost on you? By your logical we should have no laws because people will break laws anyway. Again, same old stupid arguments by the pro-gun side that carry no weight anymore.

We KNOW that higher gun ownership leads to more gun deaths, we KNOW the US has higher gun deaths even when accounting for socio-economic factors, we KNOW about the “good guy with a gun fallacy”, we KNOW all these things, it’s not even debatable at this point.

Second, we know in the US police shootings are much higher than any of its peers. That’s just factual. Huge correlation between police shootings and number of guns on the street. It doesn’t take a rocket surgeon to know that cops wouldn’t have itchy trigger fingers if they didn’t suspect that every speeder they pull over is packing heat. THIS causes police shootings. Again, this is just basic facts the gun nuts choose to ignore. There’s not any logic in your actual arguments, you just like guns and you have a deeply ingrained fear of the government.
