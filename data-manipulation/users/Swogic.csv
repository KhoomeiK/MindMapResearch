SuicideWatch,fe8g0ht,t1_fe73ca1,1578925770.0,Unfortunately a lot of the employers have their own site where they have their own online application process so it's hard to take it into the big retail stores but if a small store gives an address I try to pop down and hand in my resume in person.
SuicideWatch,fe8f5hl,t1_fe6h1bb,1578925509.0,"I've looked, the subreddit is unfortunately dead and so are most facebook hobby pages. 

Some days when I wake up before mid-day i'll usually hop on my motorbike and go down to the local reserve and smoke a few cigarettes just as an excuse to leave the house or i'll go down my old work routes (was a postman) and have a cheeky peek on my old co-workers just to see who's delivering on my old routes.

I appreciate the support. Hopefully what I have of a future won't look so grim in the coming weeks."
ForeverAlone,fe0abor,t3_enclph,1578807611.0,"Still happens to me when I decide to go for a drive. ""Where are you going, to see your girlfriend?"". Like no im going out for a drive to relax"
depression,fdzy4ay,t3_en6vj7,1578798648.0,"Oddly enough I love work, gives me a reason to leave the house. I don't get out of bed most days until 2pm but when I worked as a postman I was awake by 4am and at work by 5am and loved it. I quit because it was a lot of stress and somewhat regret it seeing how much I was paid and seeing how hard it is to find a job. Every job i've applied to in the past couple of months always hits me with the ""we've had a lot of people apply for this"". Like thanks, guess i'll go fuck myself seeing as I can't compete with people who are my age and have 10x the achievements I have."

2meirl4meirl,fcn9r7m,t1_fcn9e9y,1577806879.0,Usually when I go out for my nightly smoke around 11:30 there are no lights on. Nearly every house that I could see had their lights on tonight aswell as a lot of talking. Hits in the feels

SuicideWatch,fcc0g93,t3_egwcs1,1577593014.0,"19, also feel the same. I was supposed to the ""star"". Parents both went to university, im sat here being worthless. Longest ive held a job is for 1 month. Every job ive applied for I rarely ever hear back from."
DoesAnybodyElse,fcbyjxq,t3_egxe33,1577592399.0,Depression has killed my drive to play video games. I can play for maybe 30 mins max before I just give up
ForeverAlone,fbukphz,t3_eehyy7,1577116049.0,Fuck Tinder. Out of all the dating apps Tinder is where I get the most matches (not that many tbh) but none of the conversations seem genuine and I get ghosted when they realise how boring I am. Bumble I get less matches but the conversations seem to genuinely lead somewhere before I manage to fuck it up.
