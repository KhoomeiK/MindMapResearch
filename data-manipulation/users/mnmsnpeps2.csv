dogs,ffklxvn,t3_eu2v9r,1580024941.0,"It's pretty common in dogs who were just brought to a new home. It's stress related. Imagine you're like kindergarten aged and just got thrown into a completely new place with a bunch of strangers. 

Otherwise some more possibilities. 


1. Did your vet recommend anything specific is the biggest thing here. As much as we'll try to help, we're not a substitute for a professional that's seen your dog. 


2. Do you know what the breeder/rescue you got her from fed her? You'd be surprised how many dogs can be picky.


3. There's also just the possibility she's not food driven. 


4. What does feeding her look like? Where is her bowl, are you guys around her while she's eating, things like that? One of my dogs won't go near his food bowl until I leave the room. 

5. Ask your vet about potentially something for pain since she's teething and try just canned wet food for awhile? Even watered down kibble can be rough on a teething dog."

1. Yes any dog can become aggressive. No shit, Sherlock. You know what not all dogs can do? Potentially kill someone when they get aggressive. You know what also isn't true about all dogs? Pitbulls were literally created and bred as fighting dogs with the temperament and instinct and body structure that made them quite effective at it. Potential dog aggression is a feature not a bug. So is a high prey drive, so is the ability to become overstimulated incredibly fast. It is in the breed standard both in AKC staffies and UKC pits. 

2. Do you want to know what doesn't help pits? Going ""lol but my dog is so sweet checkmate haterzzzz"" congratulations your dog is sweet. All of the things you said are definitely true and if they are you're definitely not blatantly stressing your dog out by putting your fucking hand in its mouth because you feel a need to prove that best so sweet.

3. Why is it that it always seems like the people who claim to be advocates for the breed absolutely fucking *despise* everything unique about pits? Y'all claim any sports or exercise one might get them into is cruel, you're always so determined to prove that they're just the bestest uwu pupperz ever that you continue to put them into situations that are likely to cause them to become reactive, and the second anyone mentions that temperament is genetic and they've been bred over a couple centuries to act a certain way, you cover your ears and scream ""lalala I can't hear you they're nanny dogs"" that isn't loving a breed that's projecting traits of your ideal dog (which spoiler alert isn't a pit apparently) onto a pit and trying to shove the poor thing into a box it doesn't fit into. 

4. If you do want to properly advocate for the breed, run your two chickenshit brain cells together long enough to so actual research on the breed, practice actual responsible dog ownership, encourage other people to do so as well, understand that responsible pit owners (and the owners of any other breed) understand what their dogs are, what they're capable of, and what they are as a result of X amount of time being bred for a purpose. 

5. Since you want to bring up ""BUT OTHER BREEEEEEDS"" let's talk about other breeds. If you say a husky is likely to want to run all the way to china, nobody says shit. If you say a LGD will attack anyone they perceive as harming their owner, nobody says shit. If you say not to get two Akitas of the same sex because they're prone to SSA, nobody says shit, herding breeds will destroy your house if they're understimulated, GSDs are neurotic messes, Malinois are batshit fucking crazy, Dobermans will attack small animals, all perfectly acceptable and nobody says shit (and they are don't get me wrong dogs didn't pop out of nowhere as just pets one day they have these traits because they're necessary for the work the dog was used for), hell the things people say about any small breed range from obnoxious to ""holy shit what is wrong with you stay away from dogs"" and nobody says shit. But ""pits are prone to aggression and they're capable of doing serious damage"" means you're directly responsible for anything bad that happens to pits ever. Fucking spare me."
