tifu,fe61mpx,t1_fe60wuk,1578879763.0,"No it would not be like me finding a 10 year old attractive. The body starts to mature at around a certain age, and then it’s generally when you start finding them attractive (just for clarity’s sake, finding someone attractive is not the same a sexually objectifying them). 

It is a natural thought. You can basically not see any difference between some 16 and some 20 year olds these days. The number is what matters legally but emotionally it’s another thing. I’m not saying you should act on it. You become a perv/pedo when you start doing things like looking at actual children’s porn, or doing something to a child. 

In my humble opinion, thinking a 15 year old is attractive is okay. Acting on it is illegal, and legally pedophilia, but a 10 year old and a 15 year old are two very different appearing people.

My point is, many men around the world, who are not pedos, but who tell themselves stuff like “oh shit what am I gonna do? I thought that 16 year old at the beach was really hot, I’m a huge perv and if anybody found out I would probably lose all my friends”. That’s very toxic. 

Again, just to clarify: I am not defending pedophilia. 

On phone in middle of night, probably tough to read. Sorry."
tifu,fe5xler,t1_fe5w85l,1578877197.0,"It doesn’t. Traditionally the mist attractive bodies are in the 16-21s or something like that, probably. You are allowed to think a 15 year old is hot if you’re a man, but you are not allowed to act. And probably, for norm purposes, you shouldn’t say anything to anyone either. But I’m sick and tired of hearing shit like this. I’m still only 17 but I know damn well that when I’m 30 I’ll still think we’ll proportioned teenagers are good liking.

Stop trying to sentence men to jail and absolutely ruin their mental health for a natural thought. “Everything is relative” is actually a very underestimated quote, I’ve found. In this case everything is relative to our very nature, and also to our constructed society. Let those two live side by side."
