Drugs,ffx5z63,t3_evp16k,1580318461.0,That's really strange. Everybody processes drugs differently but I've never met somebody that felt nothing for psychedelics or only felt MDMA for 45 minutes.

Even though a lot of it is common sense (write down what you want, clean your room, etc.) it's still pretty motivating to hear \*why\* these things make a difference. But here I am laying in bed on my day off shitposting."

Cringetopia,ffwu3yb,t1_ffwp0rb,1580311037.0,It's a numbers game. This guy maybe sends this to 200 girls. 195 ignore him/block. 5 of them engage. 2 of them may be vulnerable/lonely and agree to meet him. It's all very low-effort on his part and he probably gets off on just sending it to them.
Cringetopia,ffwtqet,t1_ffwlwrz,1580310788.0,"Yeah, so it's important to be the change you want to see in the world. Instead of just being like, 'Well that's just how it is...' That means not letting pedos creep on your family members without consequences."

insaneparents,ffutpex,t1_fft09vk,1580249151.0,"Well, there's a lot of religious people that don't think this way. I'd argue that religious people overall are less regressive than 30 years ago."

insaneparents,ffut8ms,t1_fft4baf,1580248902.0,"Look at the bigger picture. We've progressed so much in just the last 50 years. The vast majority of people don't bat an eye at a woman that goes to college, for the most part it's encouraged. My dad says women used to go to college just to get a 'MRS' degree. Aka they went to meet a provider. Now it's totally normal for the wife to earn \*more\* than the husband. And realistically it's very hard to have a family without both partners contributing financially."
insaneparents,ffussqr,t1_fftaaov,1580248676.0,Toddlers are dependant on their 'daddy'. A woman that makes her money and thinks for herself is very frightening.
insaneparents,ffus0ab,t1_fft7tvc,1580248253.0,Don't give these fuckers any attention. They're deeply insecure and really just want people to get stirred up because otherwise they will be ignored by society.
Music,ffuk75x,t1_ffuck1s,1580243689.0,"Cuban was going through a divorce at the time and met Kim at a Subway. He said, 'Your current man is just a boy. Bet you got some daddy issues, huh? Think you can fix him. Well you can't fix me, cause I'm the daddy that did it right. From day 1 I've been on grinding. Bet you wanna know how it feels to be pounded by a real man.' Kim was taken aback. They went straight to a motel and Cuban told her to refer to him as Mr. President."
Music,ffujupl,t1_ffugmfs,1580243481.0,"'Fucked in the head' and 'Sucked in the bed' is literally a perfect rhyme. It is an edgy line, but a good rhyme just sounds pleasant phonetically."

Music,ffubd6t,t1_ffu6kki,1580238409.0,"Mark Cuban. Eminem and Cuban have beef ever since Mark Cuban had sex with Kim back in the 90s. Apparently Eminem walked in on Cuban wearing a Nixon mask and was banging her doggystle while holding up peace signs. Then when Eminem confronted him Mark said, 'I could squash you like a bug, do you know who the fuck I am!?'"
Music,ffuaxpt,t1_ffu2oi3,1580238153.0,That's because he's the best rapper alive. Even his weaker albums have really good rap verses. The choruses and beat selection suck though. IMO the only truly bad album was Revival. Everything just wasn't as good as his first 3 albums but they're still solid.

starterpacks,fftzkvw,t1_ffte2e8,1580231185.0,Right. It basically just shows employers that you can learn stuff and aren’t a complete maroon.
starterpacks,fftzh9m,t1_fftao3r,1580231117.0,Probably teach math lol. In all seriousness it could probably open a lot of doors. In my experience a lot of companies don’t care all that much about what your degree is in. Getting a math degree basically proves you’re competent with numbers and probably a hard worker. Employers like that.
cripplingalcoholism,fftz4wf,t1_ffs1u4z,1580230885.0,I stopped drinking for a few months when that happened. Eventually I was drinking again on my crutches lmfao. As far as I know it’s basically healed 100 percent properly. I’m very physically active and hit 25-30K steps per day without any pain... but it may take its toll down the road
cripplingalcoholism,ffryzz4,t1_ffrmhrx,1580169145.0,No shit. I broke my ankle in three places walking home from the bar a few years ago. I slipped on ice and basically crawled the rest of the way home with a mangled ankle. Took several months to be able to walk on it. That was a terrible time.

I remember taking it for a short while and liking it but would think that tolerance goes up quickly... Also, a few weeks here and there of sobriety can really help make the drugs more fun. Not that I usually do that.."
Drugs,ffrrgj9,t1_ffdb5r0,1580164177.0,"Yeah I would definitely do \*more\* things like that as a teenager. I was mostly a stoner at that age, but feel like I missed out when it comes to shit like festivals."
Drugs,ffrqv7c,t1_ffenjfs,1580163804.0,I have abused my script a handful of times and actually ran out early this month. Have yet to call into work or any of the other things but it is scary how sneaky addiction can be. I'm off of it until Thursday and feel fine so that's a good sign...
Drugs,ffrqm1o,t1_ffd3gk1,1580163640.0,"Yeah, Kratom is great. It helped me quit drinking. However, it's really easy to abuse just like anything else. At one point I was taking 30-40 grams throughout the day. But definitely better than taking opiates/benzos/etc."
Drugs,ffrqedq,t1_ffd9gxl,1580163507.0,"That's crazy. I've been taking it almost daily for the last 3 months (prescribed). In total, I've taken 'extra' 6-7 times. One of those times being 60MG. I ran out 4 days early this month, so I'm drying out until Thursday. This upcoming script I'm going to space my doses out more. I don't need it daily and it really starts to lose it's effectiveness."
Drugs,ffroh52,t1_ffewt4j,1580162306.0,'This too shall pass'. It's reassuring to know that whatever mood I'm in is temporary.
todayilearned,ffroao7,t1_ffq818c,1580162195.0,"Yeah but that's like a serious problem/dillemma. When people say '1st world problems' I think of shit like Netflix removing your favorite show, or the line for the drive thru is taking forever.

science,ffmmiwq,t1_fflxlvk,1580056707.0,Could be you associate LSD with scarier trips and these expectations play into the trip. Kinda like how some people get ‘angry drunk’ on whiskey.

science,fflzde0,t1_ffkw8ro,1580046084.0,"It’s always best to start with a lighter dose. Set and setting are important. I once dosed with people I didn’t really like/trust it was pure hell. I ended up going to my room and analyzing all of my faults, replaying bad life choices in my head, etc. When I’ve done with it true friends we laugh, talk about life, and it’s just an overall brilliant time. 
1-2 grams of mushrooms or 1 hit of LSD usually puts me in a good place without it being overwhelming. Im a pretty anxious person and can just ‘let go’ and ride the wave."
thesopranos,fflxt3u,t1_ffl9cp1,1580045507.0,That and he didn’t know how about his previous debt to Richie. In Tony’s mind he was just letting his friend get involved in a game he didn’t belong in. Artie gambled with the guys too but they weren’t high stakes games.

Also, I don't think it's a bad idea for some people to just outright quit. I quit drinking altogether because the whole 'moderation' thing doesn't work for alcoholics."
Drugs,ffizv7b,t1_ffiu45z,1579986838.0,Definitely. It's the easiest drug to get and it's socially accepted. The alcohol is more responsible for him blacking out and totaling his car than the coke.

DunderMifflin,ffid81y,t1_ffh7ww1,1579971091.0,I think TV fans just like to look for stuff that isn’t there. The writers clearly wrote him to be a shitty BF in the beginning with very few redeeming qualities. Characters like Michael are multidimensional.
