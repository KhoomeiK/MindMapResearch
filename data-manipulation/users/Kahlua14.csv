September2020bumpers,ffeujrf,t3_et43xk,1579866159.0,"I don’t have any symptoms. Zero. Not tired, no sore breasts or nipples, no nausea or food issues. No cramping. I’m actually convinced that I’m not pregnant anymore. I have US on Monday and will find out. I’m expected bad news though. I am on progesterone so I am sure it is masking the miscarriage. Also. I’m nearly 7 weeks."
September2020bumpers,ffaoomj,t1_ffao34b,1579740900.0,"I told them I needed them to be a no judgement zone and I totally realize how crazy I am, they just laughed it off. My next US is 1/27. I had one 1/16, and have another one 2/3 lol. My first US I measured at 5+5 which matches trigger/IUI timing, but they couldn’t see the embryo or heartbeat (which they said was normal) but I think that just triggered my anxiety even more."
September2020bumpers,ffan7xz,t3_esdso7,1579739911.0,This is all me. 6+4. I called my RE today and told them I don’t have any symptoms and they appeased me and set up an ultrasound for month. I just had one last week. But I’m freaked out
September2020bumpers,ffakozi,t1_ff9z14y,1579738153.0,I’m so sorry. My heart breaks for you
September2020bumpers,ff7ulo4,t3_es05h0,1579658737.0,Is there ANYONE else over 6 weeks without nausea? Or sore boobs? I still have zero physical symptoms. I’m going crazy.

InfertilityBabies,ff4yk2e,t1_fesujaw,1579575547.0,IUI didn’t work for me at 36 hours. We tried 18 hours after trigger and that round was successful.

September2020bumpers,ff19kq9,t1_ff0pgow,1579476570.0,Consider yourself lucky that you saw the embryo! Mine was not visible at 5+5
September2020bumpers,ff19bfz,t1_ff124fy,1579476471.0,I’m jealous! I’m 6+1 with zero symptoms still
September2020bumpers,feupppm,t1_feu0l97,1579388811.0,Congratulations! I’m in the same boat
InfertilityBabies,femr5bj,t3_epz0ac,1579267212.0,"Stressed. All of my symptoms have disappeared. I had my first US at RE yesterday. Based on LMP, I would have been 5+2, based on IUI I was thinking 5+4. I measured 5+5 on US but no embryo detected. Only GS and yolk sac. RE was honest and said “you are not out of the woods yet, but based on what I see, I don’t think you need to come back for two weeks.” I’m scared."
