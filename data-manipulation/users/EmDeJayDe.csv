Being in your home country is a nice plus, but the salary difference between leagues is large.  Edmonton holds his keys to the league and Holland has shown that he wont be bullied into a fire sale here.  Puljujärvi is playing in a pretty high end men's league and putting up decent numbers (~ppg).  I would not be surprised if he turned out to be a middle 6 winger in the next 2-3 years for some NHL team."
