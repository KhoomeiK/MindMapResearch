dogs,fgufa6f,t1_fgueo52,1581119378.0,"I understand that. But yes, I do think it's pushing the limit a little. I certainly won't compare it to my own medical care as I don't pay to see my doctor. $67 is half my rent. It's my phone and internet bill combined. It's two weeks of grocery shopping. So when I think of what that money would buy, I do think it's a bit overboard. 

But again; I pay it and would go without whatever I needed to go without to ensure Jupe's care comes first."
dogs,fguf1se,t3_f0gyle,1581119214.0,"Is this an American thing? Chaining your dog in your front yard? Regardless of the breed, I only ever hear about dogs in the front yard from Americans (no offense meant, I'm in Australia) and it baffles me. 

I have never, ever encountered this in Australia. I don't even think it's legal here to keep a dog chained up in the front garden. It might be but it certainly isn't a common practice here. 

I can't imagine my girl being chained up outside, front or back garden. The anxiety she would get from constantly seeing people walk past and barking because that's her job, the pulling on the chain, limited shade... Yeah the idea makes me nauseous."
AssassinsCreedOdyssey,fguejp3,t3_f0h2rz,1581118872.0,"The sensitivity of the tagging is super touchy, especially for chests underground. I sometimes found that leaving the area and returning would help but frankly that got annoying because who wants to spend time going from one district to the other without having looted the chest?!"
dogs,fgudang,t3_f0egxc,1581118018.0,"Look, you're absolutely right. If a person can't afford the upkeep of having a pet, well... I don't want to say they shouldn't get one because that's not entirely fair; a person might start out being able to afford one and then circumstances change. I wasn't working when I first got my girl, but I made sure she had everything she needed and that I could cover the cost of any vet bills. I will say that there are times I can also understand the frustration with certain costs.

I do struggle to understand why it costs me $67.90 just for a check-up. No nails being trimmed, no medication being prescribed, just a basic walk in, use the scales in the waiting area, have the vet spend five minutes checking her heart, eyes, etc and send us on our way. If there's something that my girl needs, *absolutely* take my money. But the fees for a basic check-up are astronomical and frankly, I can understand the frustration in paying such a high price. 

No, my vet doesn't care only about money. In fact, I have used the same vet for various pets over the last fifteen years. It still just kind of irks me that the price of a consult is so high."
