UpliftingNews,ffgwv2f,t1_ffgw1ct,1579917108.0,"Sure i truncated the thoughts. But Here just to appease you.


The simple answer to you question is you don't want to put your all eggs in one basket. We need to look to solve large problems in multiple ways.


We should find ways to change society but that's also hard. What you are suggesting is we all just stop producing harmful products. Guess what? That is noble but will not work, a wonderful analogy is a river. You don't just damn a river you redirect it. Just the same you don't just stop what an entire society is doing you provide better options then the ones currently available. 


We also try to find solutions that are not about changing society but cleaning up the mess as we make it. Such solutions do exist. Take what this young man in the article has actually done. The defeatism you are displaying helps no one."

Secondly i would question your statement that the majority of people that detransition do so because of external pressure. Every interview I've seen with people that have detransition have said they transitioned in the first place because of pressure from peers therapists and/or people ""trying to help"" and it was moving against that pressure for them to detransition."
news,ffc07yi,t1_ffbzwrv,1579788175.0,Agreed. What it highlights tho is that the critera for diagnosis was too broad and many how did not have gender dysphoria where misdiagnosed at the time and unfortunately it is not improving very much in that regard.

Affirmation therapy is a valid treatment for people with gender dysphoria but it is not the only treatment and it is not correct for every individual. Particularly at younger ages. Most importantly even with affirmation therapy if self acceptance is not a part of the treatment it is not complete.

Finally affirmation therapy has been shown to improve quality of life for those with gender dysphoria it does not get rid of it nor does it significantly lower the percentage that attempt suicide."
news,ffb3v5z,t1_ffaomht,1579751106.0,The issue i have with a lot of anti conversion laws (and I've not read through the details on this one yet) is that the definition is too vague or too broad most everyone is against shock therapy or torture.

worldnews,ff43q7o,t1_ff3zkf0,1579554874.0,">Government programs are social engineering

This is plainly false. When government trys to force change on society it fails, take prohibition or anti sodomy laws that for many many years were not enforced but were still technically the law. The culture is what determines the way government gets run. People in the US are not more accepting of homosexuality today because gay marriage was legalized gay marriage was legalized because people became more accepting. Yes, laws and government policys do influence culture but not nearly as much as culture does government"
