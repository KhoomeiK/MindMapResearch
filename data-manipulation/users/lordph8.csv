GoogleAppsScript,ffuwrqc,t1_ffutarr,1580250819.0,"Well assuming the data is consistent from the service, there are a couple ways to go about this. As usual I am looking at this subreddit on my phone right before bed so this is a barebone framework. This is very doable though.

1: you must create a label in Gmail and filter out the target emails. Easy.

2: Create a new Google Sheet and create a new apps script project attached.

3: Use the GAS GmailApp (may have to turn it on) to download the emails from your filered label, then delete the emails on Gmail. You should now effectively have a log of the calendar events you have to generate.

https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/gmail/gmail-app

4: Upload those events to a calendar with the CalendarApp, perhaps use a toggle cell on each line and upload it to 1 when you upload, and use an if( cell != 1) {} in the with the upload script. That would allow you to keep the log.

You will need to utilize for loops and if statements to get this done. You will need to split cells into arrays etc etc."

GoogleAppsScript,ffhkt5d,t3_etne3w,1579939922.0,"Well I have an idea.

If you haven't already create a variable for your range and values before your loop do so. I assume most people do something like:

Ie. var data = ss.getDataRange(). getValues ();

Copy the entire function and past 4 times (5 functions total)(you can do more if you want).

Function 1
For (i = 0; i<(data.length)/5); i++) {

Function 2
For (i = ((data.length)/5)+1); i<((data.length)/5)*2; i++) {

Function 3
For (i = (((data.length)/5)*2)+1); i<((data.length)/5)*3; i++) {

Etc.

You should be able to seperate them into bite sized chunks and set different triggers on each formula.

Additionally you can create a time trigger in function 1 to trigger function 2 then in function 2  you can delete that trigger and create one for function 3 etc but that's too much to explain on mobile. But that's good if you want one trigger to trigger the chain, say you have this thing updating every hour it should complete it's cycle in < 1 hour then start again."
