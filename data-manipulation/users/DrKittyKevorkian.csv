blogsnark,fffcjwp,t1_ffengts,1579880969.0,"""A place for everything and everything in it's place"" was just innate for my mom. She was one of 8 siblings in a working class family, so she had a lot of practice with not a lot of stuff. She didn't teach me how to breathe or how to blink, why would she teach me how to assign a spot to my things?

So it's not as if the concept was unknown to me, it just seemed impossible. Does every sock go in the exact same spot? What if my sweaters are too big for my dresser? Where should I put toys I don't play with but don't want to get rid of? When is it OK to get rid of stuff? What happens when I get new stuff? 

We moved a lot growing up, and this likely compounded my problem. Moving with 3 school age kids was no picnic, and my mom picked up more than her share of logistics and tending to distressed kids, but talk about missed opportunities to help me sort my belongings and develop routines to build toward success. 

I found an EAP going through a school scrapbook my mom kept for me. (I yelled down to my husband ""Honey, I was a special ed kid!"" to which he responded, ""yeah, no shit!"") Because they could let me work ahead and I'd read quietly when I was done, my lack of executive function got ignored. Half an hour per week to review, plan, and organize my work would have done wonders. No one cared that I was messy because I was smart and I got my work done. They figured I'd grow out of it.

Don't get me started on ADHD and gender. ADHD didn't catch up with my dad until his 40s/50s, and manifested as depression because Dad always had his mom, my mom, and/or a secretary organizing his stuff.

We will definitely pull down the wall separating the kitchen from the rest of the main floor at some point, but I'm ok postponing a renovation indefinitely. 

The best thing is the windows. Many split levels only have windows on the front and back, but ours has windows on the sides. All but one of the 4 bedrooms has two windows.

I got a bunch of brand new reusable grocery bags  when I sorted donations at the local food bank. I assign categories to them as I do big tidying jobs. But day to day, I have a Rubbermaid bin with dividers that can contain my main categories: trash, recycle, put away.

But if stuff keeps piling up in the same spot, that's a clue I need to assign a home, preferably nearby. So the spare sheets that used to live on top of a trunk in the bedroom now live in a large basket above the armoire, for example. 

So you might try containing crafts in a decorative basket so it is close at hand but contained. If you don't have such a basket, try a container you do have to see if it works for you."

Our goals were to spend less time and money maintaining our house, and have a place that's comfortable all year round. Last summer, after months of  low-level looking, I asked my husband what turned out to be a magical question: ""what's more important to you, finding a perfect house, or to be out of our current house by the end of the year."" He chose the latter, and it flipped a switch.

We were pretty wide open with our search parameters, but he had ""no split-levels"" and we both preferred no capes. After a failed offer on a cape cod, we visited a split level mere hours after it hit the market and I knew this was my house from the moment I walked in the front door. One owner, white carpet over hardwood, kitchen needed updating, but nothing we couldn't use in the meantime. We started pulling up the carpet mere hours after closing and moved in as soon as the floors cured 2 weeks later.

Now, I've always been disorganized, and to be honest, I never dreamed I could ever have a tidy,  well organized home. We got rid of so much stuff before the move that I was quite astonished by how much stuff we got rid of as we unpacked, but we just kept chugging along. Rather than rushing to unpack, I worked hard to give things a home. After hosting the holidays, we were down to one chaos room per person. One night, I discovered a ""clean along with me"" podcast that I've since abandoned (surprise! MLM!) and as I ""cleaned along,"" it dawned on me that a.) cleaning and tidying are two different things, b.) to do either well, you need to be doing both regularly. I  dedicated the whole long weekend to getting things in order, and everything has come together. My chaos room is clean, my kitchen has been immaculate for a week straight, and tonight, I can't wait to go home and hang some mirrors and art. 

I'll repeat, I never, ever thought it was possible for me to keep a home in ""sure, drop by anytime"" condition. I certainly never dreamed that I could enjoy keeping my house that way. I'm going to spend some time thinking about how this happened because I know so many people struggle with this. I've already written a novel here, but for anyone struggling with their home, I promise, there is hope!"

Then I got gerrymandered out of VA07 a few years back into an uncontested democratic house district but worked my tail off to unseat Dave Brat in 2017. And I recently moved into the 7th, so not only will I canvas for Abigail Spanberger in the next cycle, I'll also cast a vote for her. 

This last state election cycle was the first time democrats have held a majority in both state legislative bodies since the Clinton administration. Hell, they've held the senate  once since y2k. So even though both senators from Virginia have been democrats since the younger Mr. Warner was sworn in in 2009, our General Assembly has proposed (and passed) horrible, regressive legislation. US senators may not be legislating social norms, but so far they've been pretty effective at allowing state legislators the leeway to do their dirty work."

Let's say this just happens overnight. Some kind of liberal rapture. Folks in Iowa City and Lawrence wake up to considerably fewer neighbors and no libs to own. As long as it happens before the census, they would lose some congressional seats, but each state still gets two senators. Well over a third of senators, depending on how you're counting red states. They're still writing and passing our laws, only now they don't have any constituents voicing dissent. 

People who think a woman hemorrhaging from an ectopic pregnancy should receive life saving treatment even if an ambulance drops her at a Catholic hospital need to be moving to red states. People who think access to reliable contraception prevents abortion need to move to red states. If you think legislators are just coming after abortion, you've got another think coming."

Often this is a largely symbolic role, but they can preside over rule changes, etc.  Chief Justice presides over presidential impeachment trials only, VP presides over impeachment of all others. You're asking about rule changes. From my reading of the constitution, any changes in the rules of impeachment would fall outside impeachment proceedings and Pence would preside. I'm not a constitutional lawyer, but best I can tell, Roberts is obligated to follow the rules of impeachment as agreed upon by the senate. Those can be changed by simple majority."

You mention 3 possible outcomes for lost and found items: they get claimed within 6 months, they get donated, or they get thrown away. There's no ""employee takes it"" outcome for a reason. This could incentivize bad behavior, cause drama between employees, etc. Now, I think there are fine ways to include employees in the distribution of lost and found items. Umbrellas go to the ""emergency umbrella basket."" The best items are wrapped up during the holidays for a yankee swap. Have a silent auction and give the money to a local food bank.

1. If you have only experienced expected circle of life losses (beloved grandparent, beloved pet, etc.,) zip it. You have no fucking clue how much you don't know and you won't until you do. So to avoid the added trauma of realizing what a fucking asshole you were about other people's losses in the middle of mourning a shocking loss you have yet to experience, STFU. 

2. If you don't like the way someone is handling loss and it feels exploitative, don't click. If you want to follow and judge, by all means, do it, but never forget that they can't exploit if they don't have an audience and you're part of it.

3. Unless you die young or your people live forever, you're likely to experience a devastating loss and you may handle it badly. I'm coming at you hard right now because my hope for everyone in the midst of this type of loss is real life friends who will support them and real life friends who will hold up a mirror and help if things are amiss. Online presence muddies the waters but only IRL friends are in a place to step in and intervene."

Imagine a Venn diagram with one circle representing  your friends and another representing your partner's friends. It's unreasonable to expect those would overlay completely.
