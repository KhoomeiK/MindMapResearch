OldManDog,ffcuk3g,t3_ep7aur,1579807553.0,"A few years ago, my family adopted a nine year old golden. Jake was the embodiment of a golden. Friendly, loving, happy. He was the best.

I have two favoriteJake stories. The first is when we were on a walk. We encountered another dog and his family. It was cute. But that family had a cat following them. Oh boy, a new friend for Jake. Let's give our new friend the doggy sniff over!

The cat decided he did not want a sniff over and gave Jake's nose a swat. Jake was confused! Why would his new bbf swat him? Surley another sniff would change his mind. But at that point, I pulled Jake away.

My other favorite Jake story is, well [see for yourself](https://youtu.be/1O-X4vxSmEI) . He wasn't deaf. He hated fire works. But this? He was all about it."

Colonoscopies are fully covered for anyone 50 and over.

I'm 32. 

And while I have not had any symptoms, it's something personal and worrying to me.  My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer when he was 53. Even if he had been tested at 50, he most likely would still have colon cancer, just at a lesser stage.

He died 3 years later in 2014. 

My cousin was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer last year. She's somewhere in her 40's (we're not close). 

I asked my last insurance (their name rhymes with ""retina"" to cover it. I begged, I pleaded, I reiterated my family history. I said it was ageist.

They refused.

I can't do things like Cologuard because I'm not at average risk. 

My current health insurance seems more open to the possibility to me getting one. 

My mom got a colonoscopy last summer and everything was ok. We told the nurse, the anesthesiologist, and the gastro doctor that insurance most likely won't cover a colonoscopy for me. They all said to say I have blood in my stool so insurance will pay for it."

I worked at a preschool during the majority of my college years. It was staffed entirely by women. They were short staffed a few times and my brother came in to help. The kids loved him.

I just hate that there's a stigma with men in early education. It's good to have guys in early education! My first male teacher was in 3rd grade. I loved him.
