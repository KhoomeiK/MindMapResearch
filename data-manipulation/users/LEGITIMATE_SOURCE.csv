Philosophies of compassion typically come once a frontal lobe fully develops... and testosterone chills out. Even then, I think most people struggle too much to have adequate compassion for perpetrators relating to difficulty accepting  the concept that they probably, on a fundamental level, lack free will, as everyone does."

CatastrophicFailure,ffq920z,t1_ffply63,1580126554.0,"This happens more often than not on Reddit. The same kids that cry about the criminal justice system being broken don't understand that this is precisely why at a fundamental philosophical level. It's childish black and white thinking lacking virtually any nuanced comprehension. Most on Reddit don't have fully matured frontal lobes and enjoy the whole emotionally masturbatory, revenge outburst, echo chamber.

To clearly understand these things you have to forego the all consuming illusion of free will. If you don't have compassion for both victims and perpetrators you're likely just a victim of your limbic system in much the same way as so many perpetrators."

WTF,ffpa07i,t1_ffo7zi1,1580089873.0,"3am last Monday morning my girlfriend caught me with a fingernail in the eye while sleep walking, tore essentially the whole cornea into a flap. Couldn't work for a week. Not to minimize your experience at all, but having contemplated it now, I'd prefer to take beetles in both ears instead of that nightmare.

Side note, I snorted a house fly on accident once. Felt the fucker flapping around in my sinuses. Luckily I blew the bitch out shortly after. Seriously invasive experience. Yes, I have horse sized nostrils."
YouShouldKnow,ffp8ki0,t1_ffotrzm,1580088903.0,"I crashed on the couch because I couldn't sleep. She has a habit of getting up and looking for me, said she had a bad dream. When I heard her get up I turned off my phone and pretended to sleep to see what she'd do. She walked to the end of the couch my feet were at and stood there for a creepy amount of time. I sat up, laughing and asked her what she's doing, sort of swiped toward her to grab her and pull her towards me but didn't reach far enough. Reached a second time, lunging a bit further with more speed. It was pitch black, she had her hands pointed toward me, sharp thumbnail hit the cornea as I  lunged, hit hard enough that the pressure on the retina caused a flash of white. Called the ER but learned I'd just be referred to an eye doc for the morning. Didn't sleep all night as I kept getting up to reposition the flap of cornea back in place using my eyelid as a tool to move it... Then tried to lay with my eyes perfectly still. The pain I would describe as having hot sauce in your eyeball or a bunch of eyelashes scratching around. For about three days it was like that with basically blindness/ extreme haziness. Week later and my vision is still a bit off, a ridge formed on the cornea where the nail went in but it's about 75%. I'm glad corneas are much better at healing than most of us assume."

Yes, the person I responded to was saying ""100%"" which obviously isn't the case. Simple visual characteristics are never a 100%. Just correlations. Main point is you don't want to post children's images online like this and open them up to that kind of scrutiny. Crop the car, and be done."
