AMA,fe18vff,t3_enjf58,1578823879.0,"I wish to bring you some semblance of reassurance.

The universe is ever expanding, but just by the nature of things, it is highly possible that we may very well reoccur sometime later in existence, meaning passing on could quite possibly be, just the end of chapter one, and the start of chapter two, so don't say goodbye, just say I'll see you then : )  


side note, this comes from an existential agnostic, I strongly believe in science, and not at all in religion, but i hope that to some degree I am wrong in my beliefs, and that reincarnation is possible, so we may see loved ones again, and share more beautiful moments.  


also, we existed, and so did he, therefore we are to some degree, immortally captured, as matter cannot be made or destroyed, only reused. we will forever be a part of the universe, and will always all be together.  


I hope some of this helps! I'm not very good with emotional stuff, but after years of being afraid of the inevitable, these thoughts brought me some semblance of peace of mind."
