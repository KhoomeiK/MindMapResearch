Not sure how old you are, but different ages tend to be affected by different things. This is a sub to vent and that's what I'm doing. If you don't think it's a big deal, skip my post? To me, it IS a big deal."
offmychest,ffou7ix,t1_ffjy2r3,1580081902.0,The boomer thing wasn't even cool when said to actual boomers. Perhaps she needs an intervention.
offmychest,ffotz4x,t1_ffkazy5,1580081802.0,Who said I was watching it? I'm not. However it's a big part of America now and sometimes it's hard to ignore articles and news about it.
asklatinamerica,ffotpv3,t1_ffkz785,1580081688.0,This is what I like to see. That's a lot of things done in less then a year. Go El Salvador!! I'm rooting for you guys.
offmychest,ffjstpm,t1_ffjocdx,1580005996.0,"American culture makes sure you know there's always someone out there doing better than you. Oh you have an iPhone 8? Well they have an iPhone 8 Plus. You went to Vegas? Well they went to Paris.

I love traveling but people are doing it for the wrong reasons. It's not about going where you want anymore, it's about going to impress people. If you were truly interesting in experiencing a county, you wouldn't hop from country to country checking cities off a list. Once they get that instagram shot, they're gone. On the the next place. They don't stay long enough to soak it all in. It's all about the number of countries you've been to. Quantity over quality vacations."
offmychest,ffjrx52,t1_ffjjg3z,1580005299.0,That's true. American society in general is so obsessed with lavish lifestyles. I wish our whole culture would change.
asklatinamerica,ffhao7t,t1_ffh5wgt,1579928080.0,"Hopefully it stays on track and jobs increase too. Then things will only get better. But it's unfortunate what the media does, they don't help the situation they add to it. It deters people from tourism which helps the economy."
asklatinamerica,ffha0a1,t1_ffh02sc,1579927472.0,"Will certainly watch, I love vlogs like this. It gets me excited."
asklatinamerica,ffh9ye9,t1_ffgzihn,1579927425.0,This is great to hear. All these places sound amazing. I love food so San Lorenzo is a must. Thank you all the advice! I'd love to visit one day when I save up more money and when I could take my time exploring. You have a beautiful country and I'm hoping things get better for you.
AskAnAmerican,ffh9bj2,t1_ffh5z20,1579926854.0,"My point still stands, college sports are just as popular as pro sports here. I don't pay attention to them so I don't know details, I only know the teams in my state. It's not all about stadium size; the most popular sporting event is the Superbowl and that's obviously the NFL not college."
asklatinamerica,ffgz6v7,t1_ffgw6rr,1579918847.0,"I didn't realize Guatemala City was touristy. All the vacation guides are the same: get out of the city, head to Antigua, etc. I'll have to look into it more."
AskAnAmerican,ffgvpu6,t1_fffzd00,1579916269.0,My mom lived in New Mexico but now she's in Colorado. I've visited her in both states and I like New Mexico food much much more.
asklatinamerica,ffgv817,t1_ffgubss,1579915909.0,Your country is awesome. You have so many baseball players!
asklatinamerica,ffgv5y2,t1_ffgt0xk,1579915866.0,"I would love to visit Panama! Is there a best time of year to go in terms of weather? Thanks for being so welcoming. 

And yeah, I guess those people are loud but still a minority."
AskAnAmerican,ffguaq5,t3_etedht,1579915240.0,No. What big country in the world doesn't have regional differences? Bavaria is the Texas of Germany I've heard. It's more important to work together then split. I think maybe some states should be split into smaller states but still be a part of the USA.
AskAnAmerican,ffgsmrm,t3_etivsk,1579914021.0,"You might be thinking of university team hoodies. College sports are really big here, universities have stadiums as big as professional Hockey/Baseball teams. University of Michigan is usually shortened to just Michigan, for example. Most teams are like that. A good place to get them, at least in my area, are at malls."
asklatinamerica,ffgqk8m,t1_ffgq6io,1579912528.0,More like poor Haitians. It's obvious many of them of them are in poverty and starving. I highly doubt they're passing on steak and pasta to eat cats instead.
asklatinamerica,ffgnbtn,t1_ffglp00,1579910242.0,"It seems like they're doing good, I'd even say they could pass as U.S states. At least, Panama City seems similar to Miami. but I've still seen negative things about them on this sub which I don't understand."
offmychest,ff4okzw,t1_ff4c71a,1579568672.0,"He didn't just ""dislike"" that song, which is more country than rap anyway. He hated that song so much that he, a grown man, forced a child to stop singing a song.

This is a connect the dots thing. It's okay to not like a genre, but if a song triggers you so much and you go ""yeah I hate this kind of rap, but I like songs by that white guy"" then it's obvious what was going through his mind."
offmychest,ff4o1cf,t1_ff4eoqg,1579568286.0,"Eminem is the worst. So he prefers songs about killing wives and other seriously disturbing violent themes over a song that's meant to be silly and fun? Old Town Road isn't even completely rap, it's part country."

writing,fefq8ze,t3_eout6p,1579062124.0,"This will be the year I finish a first draft of a novel. It will likely never be published but I'll have made more progress than most people ever do just by writing that first draft.

Thank you for your post. Enjoyed it."
writing,fefpc5y,t3_eox0nm,1579061453.0,Congratulations on completing that first book and good luck on this next one! Having a book idea that gets you excited is one of the best feelings in the world.
writing,fefodyv,t3_eomvzw,1579060795.0,"Big success rarely happens to any author. I've read some of your posts and you've finished 0 novels in the past 5 years. If I were ask you that same question, but 10 years not 5, would that answer be similar? Even 2 or 3 books in 10 years isn't good if you are serious about writing. If you're not writing, what do you expect? Everyone else has jobs just like you. You can't keep making excuses if you want to be published.

It's hard I know. I've never completed a book either. But I'm beginning to change my routine to see if that helps me be more productive. People are trying to help and all your replies are pretty negative. You're talking about 7 book series when you're not even focused on finishing ONE.

Honestly it's not the writing that's the problem, it's your mindset. We all want to be bestselling authors but at the end of the day you gotta write because you enjoy it. Because you're upset a certain book doesn't exist so you just gotta be the one to write it. Otherwise you'll end up hating writing."
