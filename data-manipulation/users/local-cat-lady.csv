college,fe8ypk8,t3_eo4wsm,1578932405.0,"I have severe social anxiety and took this class in my very first semester of college. On the first day, my teacher just had us meet everyone in the room, a very easy first day. 

I dreaded every speech but always tried to remember that no one cares how I do on speeches and they’re rarely paying attention when you’re presenting. 

At the end of the semester I was proud of myself for my speeches and the class will benefit me in the long haul. 

The only thing you can do to make the experience of public speaking better is being prepared for what you’re going to say. Once you’re up there, there’s no changing your outline/manuscript, so practice it several times beforehand, get familiar with the words, and always speak confidently. Usually classmates won’t listen and typically only remember how confident you may come across. 

If I can get through this class, ANYONE can, I promise. Best of luck to you!"
