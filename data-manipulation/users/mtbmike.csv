Snowblowers,feggpsz,t3_ep0puz,1579092194.0,Did you purchase brand new or used? Sounds like the auger has rusted to the shaft. Supposed to grease that periodically mine has Zerk fittings. The problem with using it that way is if you hit something the shear pin is useless and you’ll maybe destroy the gear case.
