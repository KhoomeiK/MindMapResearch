The problem with incels, MGTOW, etc is that they put their hate on others, than to do something much more productive. Cheers to you."
offmychest,fdn4afa,t1_fdmzqzp,1578576866.0,Sincerest thanks. You too!

antinatalism,fdi6ygu,t1_fdi5nrr,1578436835.0,"I would like to argue that while our world is now perceived as horrible, we are actually living at our best of all now. 

Again, I would also like to repeat myself that it was a past conversation between me and partner that we may want to adopt as well, depending on the situation. 

When I say that it's my choice, it IS my choice. I know that bringing life in this world is an absolutely heavy commitment. I am well aware of the responsibilities behind childbirth. (I'd suggest you to read my other comments btw.) Personally, I do not want to call others names, or criticize what they want to do, because I do not know what they're going through. All I can say is we have to hope for those who bear children will take responsibility with what they have brought into this world. 

Finally, I did not expect for pity. I did not expect for people to sympathise, karma, anyone to do anything, really. I posted on there because I wanted to have a place to dump my thoughts (therefore, r/offmychest), and hopefully be able to lift some spirits up by giving them some kind words. That is all."
antinatalism,fdi4gji,t1_fdh8m06,1578435563.0,Im sorry but all I can say is that's just.. how it is. I sincerely hope those who decide to give birth will genuinely provide the best for their children.
offmychest,fdfi6yg,t1_fde1btv,1578362282.0,"Natural environment. Summer started here, with first few weeks of high temperature, some days reached 40 degrees Celsius. And.. some buggers played with fire. Literally."
offmychest,fdfi2ib,t1_fdeev5k,1578362198.0,"I can get a job that I most passionately want, and still complain that I'm tired. I can adopt a puppy that I adore very much, and still get annoyed at them sometimes. I can do whatever that I sincerely love, but as a human, we get tired. I have my rights to complain, criticize and bicker, as everyone else. You, as a person who disagrees can choose to not listen and ignore. We are human beings, we complain. This is just how it is."
antinatalism,fddj8y8,t1_fddd6c2,1578314472.0,"If you could be so kind to read my other comment first :) I did not mention birthing children, I did not mention anything about cutting my uterus or spreading vagina for a child. My post said ""my future children"". Me and my partner may have plans for birth and adoption. I defended myself because 1. I was misunderstood, accused, and was called names, 2. I am not a pro natalist or pro antinatalist, I just believe everyone can make a choice for their own. 

Im sorry if I sounded angry or sarcastic, the internet cannot show my facial expressions or my tone, so I hope you don't get offended by what I said. I just had to explain myself, at least. I hope you have a great day though. :)"
offmychest,fddbv3e,t1_fddbqyp,1578304647.0,Sure :)
offmychest,fdd95nv,t1_fdd935y,1578300595.0,Thanks. And I hope you manage to reduce the excess skin on your face. It's definitely inconvenient. I don't think its an excessively difficult procedure. Hopefully you'll make it. Cheers mate.
offmychest,fdd903m,t1_fdd8xnf,1578300372.0,"Yes, I could be adopting. It was a discussion done between me and my partner as I wasn't keen to have children before. He didn't care if the child was his, he just wants to educate children and take them into his arms. We may conceive, we may not. But adopting is definitely in our thoughts."
offmychest,fdd8thq,t1_fdd8i9b,1578300106.0,"Didn't really say I'd birth them, but sure.. thanks hey. Keep me in your thoughts :)"
antinatalism,fdd2sm6,t1_fdd2h81,1578292478.0,"Look, I completely understand how everyone here feels. I used to be against childbirth. I discussed with my partner about this, he wants children. And I questioned him. He told me that his parents have given him the best that they ccan and he wants to do the same for his children. I told him I'm not keen, and he told me that if it will make me feel better, we can adopt. I thought about it a bit, and agreed. We will see what the circumstances are in the future. I agree, life is horrible, but I am just starting to practice gratitude (bonk on depression and anxiety). I realized I have had good times, and ups and downs. I will try my very very best to contribute to the society now and forever. And if I end up having children/ adopt children, I will try my very best to provide. The aim is not to be happy, because it's unrealistic. The aim is to learn to be content and satisfied with life, and what they have. 

Again, thank you for being polite. I really really appreciate it."
offmychest,fdd11ij,t1_fdd0xd8,1578290576.0,"I just mentioned to be thankful for being able to choose. They don't have to conceive if they don't want to. Yes, hope for the best. Thank you!"
