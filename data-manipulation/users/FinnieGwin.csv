BipolarReddit,fdtqnwf,t1_fds93c1,1578720694.0,Driving is a big trigger for me too - I wonder why that is. It honestly never used to be and then I was diagnosed and it just seemed to go downhill.

ClotSurvivors,famsyjj,t3_e9rsze,1576212008.0,"I meet with my hematologist every 6 months now. She’s outright admitted that I’ve likely had blood clots since my attack, but nothing serious enough to switch my blood thinners. She’s honest with me & I get my blood checked every time I see them. 

For reference, I had a bilateral PE almost 2 years ago & tested positive for Protein S Deficiency.  I will be on blood thinners for life. Currently, I’m on Xarelto (which has been working great, as far as I can tell). 

I’d meet with a hematologist so they can take your full history and decide if you need to be on thinners, because from my desk, it sounds like you need them for life."
