HolUp,fecku5i,t1_feck724,1578976380.0,"I’ve tried it but it never really worked out. If you want more detail, she cried and said things to make me feel bad. However, I don’t think she actually said it to make me feel bad, she honestly thought she was justifying what she has done. She truly, without a doubt feels like my brother and I despise her and never listen to her. Last week, my mom yelled at my 22 year old brother because he was going to try out a beard. She said she didn’t like it and that it made my brother look ugly. (Already I just wanted to leave the house.) My brother said “ok, but I wanna try it out.” My mom then looked st me and asked me what I thought. I said that what we think doesn’t matter because it’s his face and he’s 22. My mom went silent for a couple minutes then all of a sudden was saying things like “you guys never listen to me anymore, you guys will leave me to die”, etc. and started crying. She also at some point said that “I hate is so much. It makes him look like a Muslim.” which obviously comes from her background of being a Hindu in a Muslim majority country. Racism is a big no-no for me. I didn’t know what to do since she was crying so I just sat there blasting music into my ears to try to forget things. I’ve never told anyone this in depth about my mom"
HolUp,feck0dj,t1_fecjcu4,1578975782.0,"I haven’t really thought that far because I’ve been struggling with the decision of whether I should leave in the first place for some time now. Ever since I was a child my mom would make me promise I wouldn’t leave her, so it’s tough (I think if a mom needs to beg her son to never leave her it sort of shows their flaws right there.) If I do ever leave, it would because I’ll be dorming at a university (I’m still in HS), but it’s unlikely she will let me live apart from her. It may sound pretty far-farfetched, but I’ve always wanted to live in Japan or South Korea sometime in my adulthood and get away from it all. But when I consider not having anybody there that I know along with a using language I don’t speak, it’s blatantly not the best choice, and my further my sink. But it could also be something that I need. Sorry if I’m going off topic, I’m just thinking out loud to you at this point."
HolUp,fecj6zw,t1_fecio2s,1578975210.0,"Thanks, I know what you’re doing and I appreciate it. I’m just glad that I didn’t turn out like my mom,  and am considered to be a really nice person by my acquaintances. It’s hard for me to be mad at my mom for how racist and abusive she is because she didn’t grow up in America like myself, but in a poor country, and as a minority in that country. Even though I know I can’t stay around her narcissistic trap for long, I don’t know if I can leave because of how bad I’ll feel"
