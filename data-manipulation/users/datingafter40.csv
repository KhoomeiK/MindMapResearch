BisexualMen,fgmnoib,t1_fgm06ey,1580928308.0,"Same. I was 41 when I finally came to terms with it. 

I’m still mostly attracted to women and married one, but I don’t regret my flings with guys and am still attracted to them."

Way over the line."

funny,fgchgi5,t1_fg94hv9,1580672665.0,"Should be quite a bit higher, tbh. 

Gay and bi men exist, for one, and I’ve had 2 different women request one. 

So, there *is* a demand for it. 

The problem is if they were solicited or unsolicited. 

Because unsolicited is sexual harassment and not cool."

... Are we still talking about the pie chart?"
funny,fgcgd58,t1_fgb4s9e,1580672449.0,Very economical of them.
funny,fgcfsma,t1_fg8p6ww,1580672237.0,"Same. 

Solicited/consensual dick pics only."
funny,fgcfl22,t1_fg8tzxv,1580672185.0,"Yeah, I think there should be a sliver of red at least, somewhere around 10%?

I’ve been asked for a dick pic by women (2 to be exact/fair). 

And yeah, Gay/bi men definitely request pics."

As for Jackson, Charlize seems to have let the kid choose what they want, and apparently she identifies as female."

You just gave up having any influence on European rules until you actually leave. But you still have to abide by them for now. 

And after that you’re going to have to negotiate a new deal. With the EU."

OKCupid also has been good for me. 

Just be honest and open.

Edit: any reason for the downvoting? Or did someone follow me from a different sub because I said something bad about their President again?"

aww,fg6q00v,t1_fg6ibsn,1580574226.0,"We’re talking about playing with your dog. Pretty sure most people are authentic in that. 

The reason I tell people about the sneezy sound is that dogs sometimes can’t figure out if we’re being playful or not, because our body language isn’t always telling them exactly that we’re playing. The sneeze is a way of letting them know for sure."

aww,fg64li6,t1_fg5yq08,1580553327.0,It also help to do that sneeze sound they do. It’s another indicator of “I want to play”.

bisexualadults,fg4r4x7,t1_fg49bjn,1580509269.0,"I agree with the informed consent part, sort of. 

However I don’t think “cheating” is the right word to use here. Cheating is the term used for breaking the relationship agreement (verbal or non-verbal), especially in relation to sex/intimacy and she hasn’t  done that. Being *attracted* to others is not cheating (imho), acting on that, without mutual consent, is. 

I agree it would probably be best for them to break up."
bisexualadults,fg4qkio,t1_fg3uxpb,1580508908.0,"Relationships you had before this relationship should not be “used against you”, WTF. 

Please get out of this relationship. 

He sounds controlling and toxic. 

Be safe, take care of yourself."
bisexualadults,fg4q7v9,t3_ewoxxj,1580508681.0,"He “won’t date bisexual women”. 

But he’s dating one, even if he doesn’t know it. 

Find someone who doesn’t shame you for what or who you’re attracted to.

And there’s always the fake phone call saying “ah yes, I’ll be there in 5 minutes, love you!”"
TwoXChromosomes,fg3xvko,t1_fg3gj93,1580491996.0,"Yeah, you should contact the restaurant and lodge a complaint. That’s not okay, and a good reason to get fired."
TwoXChromosomes,fg3wx1f,t1_fg3fymw,1580491417.0,Uber and at least one of their competitors here does that. I never see the number of the driver nor do they see mine.
TwoXChromosomes,fg3wn6h,t1_fg3f4ib,1580491251.0,"The main reason for this is to make sure the driver isn’t coercive and to avoid the driver knowing who left a bad review. (As far as I know, the reviews/stars don’t get added immediately anymore because a few incidents where drivers would get mad at passengers when they saw their rate drop.)"

And I have a different password for my Mac from the rest of my systems (I’m guessing AD?) 

Lastpass doesn’t work for half the systems. 

I fucking hate changing passwords so yeah, they are written down (obfuscated) in my notebook, sorry."
