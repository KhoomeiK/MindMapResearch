TalesFromRetail,fff2i21,t3_et6zaw,1579873927.0,"> Anyways I hope she found a hydroflask for her 12 year old. 

  
I do too. I hope when she opened the gift and saw the hydroflask beneath the wrapping paper, she looked up at her mom and said,

""What the FUCK is this? I wanted an iPhone X, you stupid cow!""

And then hurled it through the window."

(And I had other issues with it that I won't go into here.) But that's fine, plenty of other games in the series to enjoy. And if others really enjoyed Gen 5, hey, that's fine too! Everyone likes and dislikes different things, that's what makes life interesting."

nintendo,ff6vidr,t3_erz8mv,1579635737.0,"I enjoyed the original when I first watched it, but with each subsequent viewing I find more and more flaws, and now I just don't think it's very good (the changes 4Kids made were flat out awful). Hopefully they can tighten things up with this remake, but I ain't holding my breath. And I am really not a fan of the art style here.

Would have been cool if they had gotten the original dub voice cast together one more time for this remake. :)"
