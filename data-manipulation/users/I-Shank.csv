crochet,fgn7urr,t3_ezf2pc,1580939341.0,"I used the Obsydian Daydreams color to make a shawl. It's not the biggest shawl, but it's pretty. I posted it the other day if you want to look through my posts (each square of the blocking mat is 2ftx2ft). The yarn is size 1, superfine, though. So I wouldn't use it for a blanket unless it's supposed to be a lace pattern and you don't mind it taking forever and a half to finish."
crochet,fgmisup,t3_ez8xg0,1580925423.0,"I don't get bored, I get more excited about a different project that I'd rather work on because I can't stop scrolling through reddit or ravelry. Now I have dozens of skeins for future projects and every time I look at them,  I remember- 'oh yeah! I want to make this!'
 
At some point, I'm going to have to finish projects or write everything down"

That's a hard pass from me, lol."
crochet,fgj60vh,t3_eyssjq,1580837639.0,"Not sure what else you'd do with all the pieces of yarn at this point other that trying to tie them together for another project. I'd just keep what I have, set it on a table, put a vase of flowers on it, and keep it moving."
