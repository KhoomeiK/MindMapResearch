TwoXChromosomes,ffkynix,t3_etzp1z,1580031504.0,"Your genetics don't mean a damn thing when it comes to who you are. Sure, it can be neat to find out you have some ancestry in a foreign nation, or that you had a great great grandfather that fought in a big war, but does that have any bearing on who you are?

No, your family is who you choose it to be, and a man who wronged the person who raised you  is not family, not even a little. 

DNA is honestly overhyped in modern culture. It is important, but not the way we commonly think. It doesn't decide if you're kind or cruel, compassionate or selfish. It's just code, code created by mere chance of evolution, and has no capacity for carrying any moral implications invented by man. So I advise you to try and ignore the genetic aspect, as it isn't worth worrying about.

Your upbringing and personal choices have the determining factor on who you are. Did you have a good childhood? Do you have caring parents? Are you confident that you are a decent person, as all people should hope to be? These are the questions that matter, not what DNA you have.

It isn't your fault that it bothers you. As most families are biological, much of culture has foolishly conflated blood ties with what makes family, as in many cases family is blood ties. But this idea is wrong. Family is people who care and take care of each other. Mere birth does not make a family. Anyone can do that. Not anyone can treat each other like family.

If this feeling you are describing does not abate soon, and it's financially accessible, I suggest talking to a Therapist. You may find that it becomes easier to handle the emotions your feeling after talking it out with someone prepared to listen and understand your thoughts.

Just remember, the only person who gets to decide who you are is you."

I repeat. The issue isn't that he wanted corruption investigated. It's that he specifically singled out people that benefited him politically, while ignoring corruption that didn't matter to his campaign. That's conflict of interest.

Whether Bidens son is or is not corrupt isn't the point. The issue is that the most powerful man in the country is using his power to extort foreign nations into giving him political dirt.
