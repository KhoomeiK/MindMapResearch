It's made my life substantially easier and I have lots more free time. A lot fewer headaches, too. Some snarky $10 asshole who gave me a bad address is just a waste of my time. I'm finally at a place wherein I can tell some of these shitheads exactly where they can stick it (to an extent).

I have had a few people accidentally get sent to spam just due to their shitty behavior right out the gate.

I get paid because of my professional skills and ability to locate rare things. I'm not paid to babysit people wasting my time.

Edit to add: What pushed me over the edge was realizing my time is worth, let's say, $100/hr. I spend three hours troubleshooting these types of lunatics. I'm down $300, didn't get new sales, and will probably be upset (at least for a little) over how abusive some of these people can be. Generally they end up in refunds anyway.
