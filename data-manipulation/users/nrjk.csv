AskReddit,ffd3glf,t1_ffd1b4f,1579812674.0,"This implies war/conflict is strictly a right-wing phenomenon. Johnson is responsible for Vietnam. Nixon stopped it, for instance. Obama droned and droned for 8 years. Not exactly a ""right-winger"". Furthermore, Lincoln fought a war that freed slaves and maintained the states as a union."

Remember how nerd culture eventually made it's way to mainstream and now nerd culture is a thing? This is what will happen with neckbeards. Within a few years, there will be a show like Big Bang Theory but with neckbeards. That is when I will kill myself."

I am fully aware of the element of confirmation bias, but it happens more often than not. And I'm not talking about tiny parking lots. I'm talking about ones with hundreds, sometimes thousands of cars. The probability is just too small. I'm definitely in some experiment or I have my own Teuman show."

I taught full-time and subbed. The after school meetings were like this to a ""T"". Endless, circular complaints that could be handled on an individual level. Then having to deal with the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing was a constant source of aggravation."
musicians,feurrwx,t3_eqnjum,1579389334.0,"Do both if you can. If you have willing musicians to play out, you should. This assumes you're playing your YT stuff live. 

Ideally it should be a symbiotic system. Your local fans can view your online stuff and your online stuff can broaden your base to ither cities. 

I mean, it works for the porn star/stripping circuit. So why not musicians. 

Either way, get paid."
