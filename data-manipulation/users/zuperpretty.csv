hiphopheads,fgngu8z,t1_fgnb5zu,1580944586.0,">Trap Music has been popular since Gucci, Waka Flocka, OJ Da Juiceman, Future and many others before the Migos. That is without even touching the real true origins of ""trap music"" created by T.I. and Young Jeezy.

>The triplet flow was first used by Chuck D. all the way back in 1988 in the song ""Bring the Noise."" Since then it has most notably been used by Das Efx, Jaz-O & Jay-Z on ""The Originators"", Three 6 Mafia, Bone Thugs, and Gucci Mane prior to the Migos adopting it.

>XXX did not invent the raw and noisy soundcloud sound, and I would argue that that sound hasn't been ""popularised"" by anyone significantly. And further even if he did, the alleged invention of a ""raw and noisy sound"" does not even put him close to level that 50 and Wayne were on.

Yes, I'm completely aware that in music, there's always someone who did something first. That's why I used popularised. You really think I believed Migos litteraly invented trap and XXX invented punk? Migos took the triplet flow to the mainstream. XXX took the noisy soundcloud sound to the mainstream, then switched to and became one of the more prominent emo rappers. 

>50 and Wayne were not ""just popular rappers of their time."" They were THE rappers of their respective times. They were cultural icons. They were inescapable in all aspects of popular culture, not just in music or hip-hop in general. I wonder today how many average people on the street can even name all of the Migos individually or pronounce xxx’s name.

Why is their celeberity status and regular people's ability to name things important? Does it matter just how popular someone is if their music isn't particularly innovative or interesting? Here, I'll name some more inescapable cultural icons of their times: Britney Spears, NSYNC, Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey, Chris Brown, Backstreet Boys, Vanilla Ice. Can you now see why I don't give a shit about popularity or icon status? I only care about the music, which is why I said in my original comment: ""But popularity doesn't equal quality. I'm a guy who often appreciate art within a historical context, but with Wayne I've both never managed to like his music, and I'm struggling to see what he did that was so great musically.""

>Lastly, there is no clear point or conclusion to be found in your last paragraph. Drake certainly deserves to be praised for ""being the biggest in the game"" at a certain point of time for his performance over the last decade plus. You begin your argument by saying that ""Someone being popular doesn't make them good, but sure, they'll have come up with something people like."" Then you go on to say that ""Being the most popular requires you to be a truly good musician....""

Did you not get the sarcasm? 

>I also was around when Wayne peaked, he got radio play and party play, **which we all know is a staple of quality music and innovation. Being the most popular requires you to be a truly good musician, just like every boyband, pretty girl popstar, and trap rapper who has topped the charts.** 

I thought I made it very clear with ""staple of quality and innovation"" and ""truly good musictian, like every boyband, pretty girl popstar, and trap rapper"". Let me spell it out: I don't believe that popularity requires talent for anything but marketing (and that's usually handled by someone else). Boybands, pretty girl popstars, and basic trap rappers just follow trends, have an image people like, and get lucky. Most are not good musicians, just like Drake since NWTS has basically just been a poster boy for his producers and marketing people. 

That's why I need someone to explain to me why Wayne was so amazing, without using arguments like: popularity, celebrity status, having one cool sound that lasted 5 years. Guess what, having some hits, being famous, and making some popular albums, then fading away is what 90% of artists do. There's a reason no one under the age of 25 gives a shit about Wayne, just like they don't give a shit about Britney Spears or Linkin Park or any other artists who stayed relevant for less than a decade. 

>Overall you have talked a lot while saying very little at the same time.

Lol at this. You say that after you just went in and criticized every sentence of my comment, really biting down on on how Migos and XXX didn't influence the genre when I was just using them as examples off the top of my head. The whole point of me using them as examples was to illustrate how some artists have a cool sound, become popular, then fade away, without having to be praised as innovative legends afterwards (like people do with Wayne). My WHOLE point was that Migos and XXX are ok artists who did or popularised at least one thing, and became popular because of it. 

I'm done now, I'll read your reply but won't answer, I've already spent too much time on this. Btw, you still haven't given any good arguments to why Wayne was a good musician or why he deserves his legend status."
hiphopheads,fgn6ygi,t1_fgmshua,1580938869.0,"If you don't know anything about the effect XXX or Migos had on style and trends in hiphop, it just shows you're out of touch with hiphop today. Which might explain why you might glorify Wayne and think 50 Cent... uh gives me a more credible argument? 50 was just a popular rapper of his time, just like Wayne. They're just the 2000s equivalent of Drake or 21 Savage or Lil Uzi Vert. 

I'm not a huge fan of Migoes or XXX myself, but it'd just be rigid and out of touch to not recognise that they had some impact. They created a cool sound (XXX popularised the raw and noisy soundcloud-sound, Migos had triplet flow and helped popularise trap). Lots of rappers leave their mark, good or not, popular or not. Someone being popular doesn't make them good, but sure, they'll have come up with something people like. 

I also was around when Wayne peaked, he got radio play and party play, which we all know is a staple of quality music and innovation. Being the most popular requires you to be a truly good musician, just like every boyband, pretty girl popstar, and trap rapper who has topped the charts. Take Drake for example, he's one of the more boring rappers I know, yet he's the best selling of all time. His albums get good reviews, poeple love them, he gets radio play, gets played during parties. Does he also deserve to be praised for ""being the biggest in the game"" and for whatever small innovations his producers and ghostwriters came up with?"

I think the main purpose of the scene, and scenes like this in the show, is to showcase what Britain was going through at that time (and then connect it to the royal family). 

Season 3 showed us the fall of the ""British empire"", or at least the peoples' realization that Britain was no longer a superpower with the economy and influence they used to have. All the strikes, the political problems, the social cuts, etc, we hear about it all season long, and here we get some understanding of how that felt for people of the older, conservative guard. People like Mountbatten, who had fought in wars for Britain, just to see it crumble for decades after. 

Sure, those people glorified colonialism, but is it really that strange? These are just people, in the 60s and 70s, born and raised in the 1800s/early 1900s, when colonialism and influence was the norm and a large part of Britain's national identity/pride. So I don't think old veterans in the 60s looking back at the British empire with fondness are delusional fools. 

Also, historical dramas don't have a responsibility to condemn cultural trends that haven't aged well. That was how people felt and acted, and while shows/films can sometimes let the viewer see how those people were mistaken (without being heavy handed), but they don't always have to do so.

And I would like you to consider if this is by design, to pull some 'aha, i got the definition down, so by definition im right' bullshit.

Remember that gay people used to be defined as perverted, mentally ill, and criminal. Some races used to be defined as primitive and not deserving of equal rights. Men who showed any weakness were frowned upon (many still are). Women who had sex outside marriage were a disgrace (many still are). Norms change. 

That doesn't mean people can do whatever they want, but it does mean that they in most cases (when they don't hurt anyone) should be spared the judgement and distain from others.
Definitions and norms and judgement shouldn't be based on what the majority feels, that's tyranny of the majority. That's why you have half the countries in the world still defining gay people as perverted, mentally ill, and criminal. Or women as their husband's property. 

Especially when most peoples' ""common sense"" is largely based on norms, culture, and how things used to be. If they can make a good argument as to why the common sense version of genders is the best one based on science, statstics, and societal function, then you can argue that other versions are wrong. 

>I will point out that this kind of classification and definition is why the population of racists, transphobes, misogynists seem to be growing with every passing year.

It's not. People have become more tolerant, less racist, and less homophobic for decades. Gay people were banned from the US military until 1993, in 1996 almost half of the US population thought gay relationships should be illegal. 

Also, using people's prejudice as an argument for things being too progressive is so dumb. Imagine people saying ""no wonder people are becoming more racist now that segregation has ended"".

>That's transphobia. The fact that he also expressed an opinion about fairness in sports doesn't excuse him from insulting a trans woman for being a trans woman.
