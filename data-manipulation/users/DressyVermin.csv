If you just want to straight up insinuate that im not telling the truth (yeah sure, buddy) then there's not much of a convo to have.

I dont eat much meat, maybe once or twice a week max, but the fact that you guys are so god damn close minded that you equate any killing as needless murder. Sorry that humans have evolved to eat meat and have for centuries. Id just get over it, because the truth is there's a lot of different ways that life is ended. Most of the time, it isn't pretty.

It's probably much easier to just watch Always sunny or archer or some shit and not think about the real world. Just take your trip from your day job, to the vegan snack shop, to your home.

Please look into hunting. It is validated by conservationists everywhere due to the money made from hunting licenses going to protecting the land that all of these animals live on. And i promise, just looking up info on it wont make you a non-vegan. But again, it's much easier to not think about other realities except for yours :)"

vegan,fchnh2h,t1_fcesdgh,1577652045.0,"...what? Would you rather a dying old elk be left behind by the herd? Die from starvation? Get eaten by wolves.

Hunting is sacred, and if you think that a 2second death of an old elk that has lived it's entire life is somehow less humane than bears literally eating them alive, it's clear youre just leaning on the bias of the hivemind in here."
vegan,fceq2pt,t1_fccv2t9,1577622778.0,"Yes i do :)

I fucking love animals. I love how they interact in nature when there's almost no human interaction, i love them amongst us as pets, as friends.

Luckily though, im not deluded enough to think that a person is defined by one action. I try to eat personally hunted game (moose, deer etc.) as hunters are some of the most humane and caring about animals that I know.

Edit: ugh, i love all of your replies when you clearly know nothing about hunting :), im sure it's easy to not challenge your thoughts when you only converse in a hivemind, but let me give you some info:
You dont hunt young animals, you hunt animals that are old, and towards the end of their timeline. You swiftly kill the animal, faster than it would die from illness, injury, or how those wolves so dearly and humanely put them down. You are actually retarded if you think tofu acquisition comes without harm to the environment. Look it up- small mammals have gone extinct from industrial agriculture. They destroy the land theyre on with these giant pollutional machines, that ravage the land and anything living in it (rabbits, rodents, ground nesting birds) but im SURE that has never come up in this subreddit."

vegan,fcjbprq,t1_fcjao3r,1577682339.0,"Not at all, because in one comment you argue to minimize animal suffering, yet in the other you feel it's better for an animal to be **eaten alive** than to die in an instant. Idk about you but an arrow to the heart seems quicker than a bear or coyote eating you ass-first"
vegan,fcjaf3e,t1_fcj99gj,1577681310.0,"Yea, i moved out of texas to get away from the toxic hick-hunting shit. I never hunted or went around any of that until i listened to a podcast that explains ethical hunting once i grew up and moved out. 

If you just want to straight up insinuate that im not telling the truth (yeah sure, buddy) then there's not much of a convo to have.

I dont eat much meat, maybe once or twice a week max, but the fact that you guys are so god damn close minded that you equate any killing as needless murder. Sorry that humans have evolved to eat meat and have for centuries. Id just get over it, because the truth is there's a lot of different ways that life is ended. Most of the time, it isn't pretty. 

Again though, im sure it's much easier to think that the world is a utopia where all of the anthropomorphized animals you've imagined die peacefully like yoda evaporating into the force."

vegan,fcj4qtw,t1_fciv49o,1577677243.0,"Right most likely because the reality of being eaten alive or die in the middle of the winter due to herd abandonment has never been explained to you.

It's probably much easier to just watch Always sunny or archer or some shit and not think about the real world. Just take your trip from your day job, to the vegan snack shop, to your home.

Please look into hunting. It is validated by conservationists everywhere due to the money made from hunting licenses going to protecting the land that all of these animals live on. And i promise, just looking up info on it wont make you a non-vegan. But again, it's much easier to not think about other realities except for yours :)"
vegan,fci1rxx,t1_fchtn1q,1577656710.0,"Well it's very hard to compare the two scenarios and im not tryna ward you away im trying to explain my thought process, so whats the point youre tryna make so maybr i can explain my mindset better?

Edit: welp, yall arent looking for a convo. Just more of a hivemind"
vegan,fchnh2h,t1_fcesdgh,1577652045.0,"...what? Would you rather a dying old elk be left behind by the herd? Die from starvation? Get eaten by wolves.

Hunting is sacred, and if you think that a 2second death of an old elk that has lived it's entire life is somehow less humane than bears literally eating them alive, it's clear youre just leaning on the bias of the hivemind in here."
vegan,fceq2pt,t1_fccv2t9,1577622778.0,"Yes i do :)

I fucking love animals. I love how they interact in nature when there's almost no human interaction, i love them amongst us as pets, as friends.

Luckily though, im not deluded enough to think that a person is defined by one action. I try to eat personally hunted game (moose, deer etc.) as hunters are some of the most humane and caring about animals that I know.

Edit: ugh, i love all of your replies when you clearly know nothing about hunting :), im sure it's easy to not challenge your thoughts when you only converse in a hivemind, but let me give you some info:
You dont hunt young animals, you hunt animals that are old, and towards the end of their timeline. You swiftly kill the animal, faster than it would die from illness, injury, or how those wolves so dearly and humanely put them down. You are actually retarded if you think tofu acquisition comes without harm to the environment. Look it up- small mammals have gone extinct from industrial agriculture. They destroy the land theyre on with these giant pollutional machines, that ravage the land and anything living in it (rabbits, rodents, ground nesting birds) but im SURE that has never come up in this subreddit."
