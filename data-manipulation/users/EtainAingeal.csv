Maybe give him a 10 minute warning, wake him up from across the room, give him a bedtime snack and let him work on getting up in his own time so his anxiety isn't telling him he's being rushed or like you're going to physically bundle him off to bed while he's sore and vulnerable."
reactivedogs,ffhn9ty,t1_ffhl3qw,1579943563.0,"In the UK, you can ask your vet for the script and take it to any chemist (if you're in a rural area, look for one farmers use, otherwise, online pharmacies will fill it). Even my vet has said its usually cheaper to do it that way."
reactivedogs,ffgke3p,t1_ffgjmfm,1579908252.0,"That's fair. Your vet might consider a phone call for a prescription if the arthritis is something on his record. 
Is he continent and well behaved enough to skip the crate at bedtime? Or leave it accessible if he wants to toddle off to bed by himself later?"
britishproblems,ffginkh,t1_fffzt1v,1579907106.0,Is that only my advice slips?
reactivedogs,ffghpgu,t1_ffghiwq,1579906484.0,"Might just be later in the evening, especially if he's been sleeping in one place for a while and has seized up. God knows, I can relate. Could be worth getting him a check up even just to rule it out if you can afford it."
reactivedogs,ffggwds,t3_ethw5b,1579905964.0,Is he on any pain relief? Sounds a bit (to me) like he might be hurting and not keen on being moved because of it.
AmItheAsshole,ffg9odb,t3_eta16k,1579901467.0,"NTA. If I was living with a couple and they'd recently found out they were expecting a baby, I'd at the very least be expecting to be kicked out, if not actively asking when they expected me to be gone by. 
This is no longer a divorcee staying with his brother and his brother's gf while he gets back on his feet , it's a family with a lodger. And let's be honest, who wants to live with someone else's newborn??"
AmItheAsshole,ffg8iky,t1_fffuv09,1579900753.0,"I was wondering that. Or is it a jealousy thing where the one day OP's attention is on something else, he has to make it about him?"
AmItheAsshole,ffg8c2r,t1_fffz8e8,1579900644.0,I hate when people comment that they wish they could upvote a comment more than once but I wish I could upvote this more than once...or that I wasn't too poor to give you gold.
badwomensanatomy,ffflh16,t1_fffi4o2,1579886526.0,Amateur! I'd much rather take advice from the person who studies dead people than the person whose patients are still alive /s

Me too...

...Ok, I fell down the stairs but it still counts."
tifu,ffffrf6,t1_fffflyg,1579882994.0,"Well, shit. Looks like I've been doing it wrong too. But to be fair, I'm so clumsy, it pays to watch where I'm putting my feet."
