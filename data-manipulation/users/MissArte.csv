This mother needs therapy. Honestly, reading her dialog made me sad. She is so scared to leave her kid. It sounds like she doesn't trust her husband either (trust and communication should be #1 in any relationship). 

The comment below is right. The kid doesn't need any presents. It will remind the kid that you're gone, as well as needlessly spoiling the kid. If he can last daycare without missing his mom, he'll be just fine while she's on a trip. FaceTiming would be fine if that's all you're gonna do. But that needs to be the last five minutes or so before bed, saying goodnight. If you make too big of a deal about leaving, the kid is going to think there's something to fear or worry about. It needs to be a happy, calm thing when mommy leaves for a trip."

dogs,ffwuedh,t1_ffw3ydj,1580311225.0,"So grain free foods are known to cause a heart disease. This is because when there isn't rice or flour in the food, something else must replace the grain to make it solid. Kibble companies use potatoes, lentils, and other binding ingredients instead. These, however, are not good for dogs and can cause problems like heart disease. Your dog may have an allergy to one of these ingredients, which is why with the wet food, where there shouldn't be grains OR grain-replacements, your dog isn't having any reaction. I would try a small bag (so if it doesn't work, you haven't spent a ton of money on food your pup can't eat) and try a grain IN food. Purina Pro Plan Focus has a chicken and rice formula that I haven't seen a single dog not like. I think it's worth a try to see if your dog is possibly allergic to grain free formulas."

raisedbynarcissists,ffvem0y,t3_evfna7,1580262309.0,It's my experience that enablers are just as toxic as the narcs they slave for. You need to cut ties with your mom as well if you value your sanity and peace. She will *never* agree with your decision to have NC with your stepdad. She will always make BS comments about letting go of the bad times and only thinking of the good. It will never stop. You really need to consider that and how it'll affect you mentally.

entitledparents,ffudnpy,t1_ffuco5e,1580239766.0,"Telling someone to go online to apply for a service dog is advising them to end up at a scam website that will offer a certification and vest for hundreds of dollars. I didn't mean to sound so harsh in my original comment, so I apologize. They are also called mobility dogs, not balance dogs. There is importance in proper terminology just to make you sound like you know what you're talking about, if you know what I mean.

You also don't need a note. That's for emotional support animals. To have a service dog, your doctor must deem you disabled and recommend a service dog as part of your treatment plan. 

With this reply you just gave me, it makes more sense. Your previous comment, however, was very easy to misinterpret. I mean no offense. That's simply why I reacted harshly. I am very passionate about the service dog community, which makes it very important to me to be sure others have the proper knowledge around it. Again, sorry for being harsh."

There is no website that can give you a service dog by signing up. There are organizations who train service dogs that you can contact and get on a waiting list for. Owner-training your own service dog is acceptable under USA laws.

Websites like the Service Dog Registry are scams. Do not pay money for a certification for your dog. They hold no legal groundings. A dog is a service dog because of their trained tasks or jobs to assist their disabled handler, not because of words on printed paper or a vest.

You should just be totally honest with the shelter so they can more accurately place her next time.

Maybe look into getting a senior dog! They're often more calm and sometimes have experience with cats. Experience with cats is super important. I'm sorry you may part with Zelda.

dogs,ffri4y4,t3_euu4gw,1580158462.0,"You should not let your cats alone with the new dog ever. Their personalities clash hard enough to make it a constant issue. They always need to be separated. If you don't want to deal with this, you may need to think about returning Zelda for a more calm dog that can coexist with the cats safely. Otherwise a dog just may not be right for you at this time. 

If you decide to keep her, you need to set up sturdy baby gates and keep them separate at all times.

service_dogs,ffqrsx6,t1_ffnqa4g,1580142164.0,"I puppy raise for GDB and it's literally killing me that client handlers are doing this to the puppies we put our heart and souls into (dark green vests with white lettering). As volunteers, we are given VERY strict rules and regulations to follow, as well as very hands-on with more or less ""expert"" puppy raisers who have raised for 15+ years -- basically we don't pull crap like this. The leaders of the clubs or just any other puppy raiser would note anything weird or incorrect other raisers do. I, myself, have been corrected on some thing (definitely nothing abusive, just minor things like feeding treats too far forward).

Handlers, however, are not given constant checkups like we raisers are. Handlers just do life with their dogs and perhaps get contacted to see how things are going monthly or bi-monthly? GDB raisers have to fill out lengthy reports monthly as well as be physically present with the raising club 2+ times a month.

TLDR: this was a very long way of saying that puppy raisers, at least for GDB, are super unlikely to abuse any dog. We're volunteers and they will literally just take the puppies away, so that's a huge incentive for anyone who thinks abuse is a good idea. Usually, people who volunteer over a year of their life away wouldn't trash it all by abusing their pup.

Futher advocating for GDB dogs, they don't need harsh corrections. We raise them to respond to small cues, verbal and non-verbal. A dog who has made it through the training to be a guide doesn't need to be pulled down into a ""down"", though as raisers with some stubborn young pups, we are allowed to gently give collar pressure to encourage a pup to go down (when they aren't responding to the cue) without pulling or yanking or anything like that. Every dog has their off day, but there is no reason to abuse these dogs to get what you want from them.

GDB uses golden retrievers, labs, and crosses between them. We stopped using german shepherds years ago, so anyone with a german shepherd isn't going to be from GDB.

Sorry for letting this get so long... I am just hugely passionate about all of this. It really does make me hurt inside to know people are abusing these dogs... looking at the puppy I'm raising right now and I can't imagine ever hitting, kicking, or even yanking him around, ever. 

Edit: if you want to see a good GDB handler, check out Joy Ross on YT. She's so gentle and encouraging to her guide(s). That's how a blind handler should be handling."

service_dogs,ffcwf9n,t1_ffcrqme,1579808681.0,I do agree that the handlers who go near the other dogs are honestly acting foolishly. I would never bring my pup near another dog -- and I do avoid at all costs. I alert security instead.
clevercomebacks,ffcq8gq,t1_ffcl1oi,1579804936.0,"Thank you. It's just a perspective not many people have -- before eight weeks of gestation (when heartbeat and brain activity begin) I do believe it's even humane to abort an embryo when the parents don't want it. This, in my opinion, is much better than having an unwanted baby. Nobody has to agree with me, it's just an opinion."
clevercomebacks,ffcksz8,t1_ffcjbpd,1579801578.0,Well I sure wish I had been aborted instead of being birthed by a mother who didn't want me.
CatsWhoSqueak,ffc7e4p,t3_esuawb,1579793251.0,This is r/catswhoyell material. This cat is not squeaking.
dogs,ffc70sy,t3_esubzr,1579793009.0,"So basically yes to the comment about r/Puppy101. What's also important to note is that this puppy is YOUNG. Puppies chew on everything as part of their nature. Shes soon going to be teething and losing teeth to grow her adult ones so the chewing is going to be worse. 

She needs appropriate chew toys like Nylabone and kong that are acceptable for her to chew. When she has something she shouldn't have, you should gently trade her the object for an appropriate toy. If she nips you out of play or teething, give her a toy instead. This is called redirection. It takes time, but she will learn that she should chew her toys and not people. 

If you cannot watch her, she needs to go into a crate or a playpen with safe toys to play with. 

Please. Stop. Hitting her. It's never okay to hit a puppy OR a grown dog and YES that's why she's now showing aggressive behavior. Never ever ever hit a dog. Never shout at a dog either. Redirection is ALWAYS the better choice."
