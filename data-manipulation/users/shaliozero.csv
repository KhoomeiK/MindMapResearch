interestingasfuck,ffe5zpm,t3_et4p26,1579837603.0,This is a very interesting nice looking spider and I'd definitely look closer at it! But only if there is bullet proof glass between it and me.
mentalhealth,ffbioan,t3_espmpg,1579767098.0,"You're describing a situation in which friends of me have probably been. My friendships and relationships often end because they can't handle my illness. I understand how difficult I am, but it hurts a lot when people give up on you. Because I'm acting similar to him, I will try explaining how I want to be treated when I get depressed and seemingly reject everyone.

Now that I said that you must still decide yourself if you can get trough it. You're stating that it began to cause stress and anxiety for you and a relationship that makes you sick can't stick forever. On the other hand I would consider it unfair to get left because the reason is myself. A lot of issues aren't solved because my friends don't reflect my behavior on me: I don't realize I'm suddenly acting completely toxic and different than I usually do. They think I'm rejecting them and want to hurt them when I actually want to show them that I need them right now. I'm depressed, I take a step away from you, but could you please hold my arm and tell me you love me, making me realize that I shouldn't reject you? My friend, who unfornately still stopped our friend, could make me almost instantly getting back to reality by telling me ""I love you"" in response to my suicidal thoughts. This exactly what I needed to hear and makes me involving her into my thoughts. In response I thanked her, told her that I need her and asked if I may can talk about my thoughts.

What can be done if you don't leave him now? Well, you must talk with him, explaining that it's difficult for you to handle his depressed phases. But also state that building a temporary distance to you by becoming apathetic isn't a solution. He doesn't need to stay away from you because he probably could let you down. Of course it drags you down if he is depressed, but that's because you love him. The fact that you love each other is the reason why you should handle these situations together instead of becoming toxic. You will open your arms when he is depressed, he isn't alone. But he needs to overcome his downs to the point that he doesn't rejects you. He should tell you how he feels when he is depressed while you should listen to him and try to make him believe in that his depression isn't his fault. He is allowed to be down, but you want to be with him when he doesn't feel good.

It will be difficult to tell him that. If he becomes apathetic, he probably thinks you're just telling him about his mistakes. It must really seem like you understand him and want to fight his depression together. If so, it isn't your fault honestly. Being depressed causes this behavior, but one still has to reflect it sometimes. It's only half an excuse to say ""sorry I've been depressed, this invalidates all my mistakes"". I do make mistakes that break my friendships and I realize, damn I shouldn't hurt people when I'm depressed.

I'm just reflecting myself in my long response. He is probably different to me, but that's how I wanted to solve the situation. I hope that you can find a satisfying solution with him together that doesn't make any of unhappy. Good luck! And in case nobody told you yet, you're a great girlfriend that you think a lot about it instead of breaking up with him instantly when he rejects you! But this fight has to be fought together. :)"
