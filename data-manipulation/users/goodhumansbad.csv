vegetarian,fg09mg1,t1_ffyvmtl,1580403175.0,"Mushrooms are excellent on the grill - cremini, button, portobello all cook easily... but you can grill things like oyster mushrooms too - they're just chewier. 

I also second halloumi - the absolute best thing ever. 

Another easy thing to throw on the grill are little flatbread pizzas - we often buy them premade from a Lebanese/Syrian grocer nearby. They come with either tomato & grilled veggies (with or without cheese), or with just cheese and zaatar. You just warm them on the bbq, and it really makes the texture perfecto.

Charred zucchini/courgette is another favourite - the natural sweetness really comes out when you get some grill marks on there. Goes super well with halloumi too, IMO.

I also like to do onion steaks - you slice them into very thick slices (this way they don't fall through the grill), brush with EVOO and season generously with salt & pepper, and then maybe a splash of Maggi or red wine vinegar & sugar... deeeeelish. You want to cook them on very high heat so it chars the outside and cooks it through quickly without making the whole thing sog-city."
wholesomememes,ffy1tju,t1_ffxsbay,1580336898.0,"I had a best friend throughout high school/college/university. Our relationship deteriorated and we eventually stopped speaking, and I didn't see her for 10 years. It was a long and torturous deterioration, by the way - not one big fight or anything like that. So when, 10 years on, she sent me a FB message at 1am asking weird questions out of nowhere (""How's your life going, what's new??? Hehehehe"" etc.) I genuinely thought she might be suicidal or on tons of drugs/very drunk (one of the reasons we fell out). I answered her cautiously, asking if she was OK (I was ready to call 9-11 and/or her father). She was evasive and super-casual as if nothing could be more normal than messaging me in the middle of the night out of nowhere. I eventually agreed to meet her a few weeks later after work... the reason for her contacting me was still unclear. Knowing she was prone to extreme lateness, I picked a restaurant/bar across from my office, brought a book and ordered myself some wine. I waited... two hours. 

She finally arrived, unrecognizable due to extreme weight loss (severe eating disorder and drug abuse), and burst into tears as she sat down, unable to make eye contact. I listened to her for a further 2 hours as she talked nonstop about every thing that had gone wrong in her life. Alcohol abuse to the point of cirrhosis (she's 32), drugs, a partner who died of cancer last year, isn't speaking to her father.... life is a dumpster fire basically. When I reacted to her saying something about her new half-brother (father has a new family) in a way that showed her I knew about the baby, she finally made eye contact with me. She asked if I'd seen her dad. I said that yes, I'd bumped into him over the years as we live near each other and shop in the same stores, etc. She took a moment and then ""casually"" said, while looking away ""Oh yeah, they said they'd seen you and that you'd put on weight.""

When we were young, when she used to always say hurtful things in a casual way - a way that you could never say anything because it wasn't a direct criticism. Maybe a backhanded compliment, or maybe just a little snipe. But it was to make you feel small, so that she wasn't the person in the room feeling the smallest. Her insecurity made her want to drag other people down to her level. For years I ignored it, because she was hilarious, witty, clever, fun, and a great listener. I really enjoyed the time we spent together... most of the time.

But hearing her say those words at that BIZARRE meeting, where clearly if anything she should be on her best behaviour so to speak... really drove home how much I don't miss the person she turned into. I miss old her - before she became so damaged. But I don't want to be friends anymore, and that's a profound realisation when I spent years feeling guilty about the ending of our friendship. 

She did more damage to me than any romantic relationship... but it also taught me more. When she made the comment about my weight, I had this moment of clarity - I felt totally calm, almost like I was talking to a toddler or a person with Alzheimers. I saw her for who she is - a very damaged, very sad person whose life is appalling, and who will never be happy. Her comment was designed to make me feel ashamed of myself, because she's obviously very ashamed of where she's landed in life... but unlike when I was a teenager, I just felt embarrassed for her and quite sorry for her, rather than feeling ashamed of myself.

Toxic friendships are so dangerous because they can go on for so long without anyone noticing how damaging they are. I'm so grateful that I'm free of her, even though I'm profoundly sad at what's happened to her. 

She compulsively talked until I literally stood up and started putting my coat on, having said ""I have to go now"" about 6 times, as I had dinner plans. At that point she started casting about for things to ask me, as I literally hadn't said ANYTHING the entire time besides ""Mmm"" ""Yes"" ""I'm sure..."" and so on. ""Are you married? Do you have kids??? How are your parents???"" I thought... we've been here for two hours, and you don't know whether my parents are alive or not, whether I'm married, or whether I have children. This is exactly like I remember our friendship at the end of it. Total one-way street, and using emotional manipulation to control me. 

I went home and cried from profound sadness, but I have no regrets, and I hope you don't either <3"

Having that throughout the morning keeps me going until lunch no problem. If I didn't have that coffee, I would be intensely nauseated an hour after I woke up - if I don't put something in my stomach I get queasy as hell and I'd be a ravening horde by lunchtime. By having that coffee (~75 calories), and a lunch between 200 and 400 calories, I still have masses of calories left for dinner.

But everything I just said at least indicates that the show was engaging enough to have these thoughts and at least be able to wish for better/more. With Discovery... I don't know. I just don't care. I'm happy to basically ignore it in terms of how it affects the rest of the Trek universe."

I had no idea what they did, who they were, or WHAT they were in the case of one character (the semi-cybernetic/robotic one). 

I watched it all, I really like Georgiou's character and Pike, and that's IT. There isn't a single episode I've been motivated to go back and re-watch since the premiere, when I re-watched it with my family who hadn't seen it yet. 

Honestly, I'll always watch Trek once just to give it a chance, but Discovery, to me, is not Trek in anything other than name and some borrowed characters (e.g. Spock, Pike). It just doesn't have that feeling, and I don't find it particularly interesting or compelling. It's a lot of explosions, fights, lens flares, big dramatic speeches (that have no soul IMO), attempts at tear-jerking moments, and running around... but none of it lands for me. 

I wasn't crazy about Enterprise, but I've re-watched it and I can appreciate what it did well - there are some really great episodes that I would say I actually love. I don't hate everything that isn't TNG... but Discovery holds about the same level of affection for me in terms of Star Trek as ""Harry Potter and The Cursed Child"" does in that dynasty.

It's not as if government programs are somehow immune to whim - which I think is the main objection to people having to depend on charity... that people shouldn't have to live in the uncertainty that maybe this month the charity won't have enough to help them. 

Charity isn't all about urgent need either; there are plenty of charities that improve quality of life rather than provide necessities. Or of course, to focus on non-human issues (animal welfare, environmental protection, etc.). 

If societies choose to actively take care of its vulnerable by starting and running charities, I don't see how that's worse than people handing off the responsibility to bureaucratic governments where so much of the money is lost to overhead, corruption and waste. 

I fully support government programs - I'm not a libertarian or a ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" type. But I don't think charity is somehow a sign of failure - I think it's a sign that people recognize the gaps in the system and work actively to close them. Government programs are by nature rigid and red-tape bound. Charities can work in a more fluid, on the ground way to assist people in the most direct, immediate way. I have a coat I don't need, I give it to someone with no coat. This is better than giving the equivalent that I paid for the coat to the government, where much of it is frittered away, who then provide welfare to someone to go buy their own coat at full price."

Now I don't have to - I just toss them in the washing machine with all my underwear, socks, sports bras, workout pants, tank tops and other things that can go in hot water with vigorous agitation (basically things that won't get tangled up). They always come out clean, and I've never had any problems with the other clothes in the wash, or the washing machine (some people seem afraid this will somehow make the machine dirty - it doesn't). 

The ones with wings stay in place very well as long as they're big enough. The only problems I've had are with the pads/pad holders that are too small. 

Since you use them overnight, I'd recommend the biggest ones they have (like the post-partum options) because they're big, comfy and give excellent coverage. When I had a heavy flow I used to use two, or the postpartum-insert which was a big rectangle that you fold letter-style into three layers. Now one is absolutely fine. 

The most important thing is though, that they are SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE - no more rashes and severe itching that I'd get using disposable pads. Obviously modern technology in disposables means that they have better odour-absorption built-in and dry-wicking materials. For me, I prefer the reusables anyway - I never notice wearing them when I'm at work or at home, but if you have a very heavy flow you will, like you will with disposables at a certain point of saturation. 

A really important accessory to have is a wet-bag (something waterproof) to store them in throughout the day. This will contain any smells and any moisture. Lunapads is the company I went with, and I got a little bag for my purse and a big one for hanging in my closet until I'm ready to do laundry. They come in nice, fun fabrics (both the pads and the bags) and I have to say, I'd never go back."

If I don't want to submit to these screenings, I have to go around the festival district which adds a 15-20 minute detour on foot.

I met with the mother before I knew what he'd done, and she 100% convinced me that her son was the victim of institutional injustice. Once I got the actual story, I had to leave my office and just went AWOL walking around a nearby shopping centre for about 30 minutes in a circle because just HEARING what he'd done put me into full-blown adrenaline mode. I felt physically sick, my hands were shaking... I couldn't stop thinking about what could have happened if he hadn't been caught when he was (and it was bad enough already). 

The mother, to this day, despite 11 separate people testifying against the son (who didn't know each other until it became apparent that all their cases were connected) maintains that this is all just a big conspiracy against her baby. She is adamant that all the victims are lying, that the institution that ended up facilitating them going to the police, after it became obvious what was happening, concocted the entire thing despite having every reason in the world to want the OPPOSITE to be true, and that the police persecuted her son. Why? Because he's a brilliant young man who makes people jealous and resentful, in her opinion.

This woman came to the building where I work, brought a bunch of her family members (all female, all around her age) and they all went to different departments pretending to be her to confront numerous people to try and ""catch us out"" in our ""conspiracy"" against her son. She's absolutely insane, and despite her son being a literal psychopath\predator... she genuinely believes it's the hundreds of people who worked on his case who are the liars.

These monsters don't come from nowhere. This boy has been taught his whole life that he's hyper-special, that he can do no wrong, that he can do whatever he likes, and if anyone complains then they're the bully/aggressor/wrong one who deserves to be ridiculed and attacked.

Personally, I don't want to die or go deaf in an exploding-can accident, and it takes WAY longer that way anyway... you can just pour the condensed milk into a microwave-safe bowl, and zap it in the microwave for 6-7 minutes, stirring every minute, until it's a nice dark gold colour. If you want to make it coconut flavoured, I'd just add some coconut flakes after it's caramelized. This creates a really delicious, sticky toffee - you can microwave it less for a pourable sauce."

I'd never drunk straight alcohol before (plenty of beer & wine, cocktails, etc.) and my friend and I chugged half a bottle of whiskey each before going to a party. We got out of class later than everyone and wanted to ""catch up"" - classic idiotic kid mistake. Had a couple of shots each, felt nothing...

Just thinking about it, 15 years later, still makes me queasy. 

I drink a lot, I'll admit that, but I never, ever black out because I don't slam shots and intentionally get wasted. If it's a drinking night, I just drink slow & steadily throughout the night until I'm ready for bed, usually wine. Very rarely if out at a bar, pints. Is it bad for my liver/heart?

Roast this at 450F until the potatoes are tender and the mushrooms are nice and meaty, about 40 minutes. You can also throw a splash of vegetable broth in the bottom of the casserole dish/roasting tin - this will give you more tender potatoes. Once cooked, serve this with a poached (or 6 minute soft-boiled, much easier) egg on top, sprinkle some fresh parsley over top, and serve with crusty bread and some lightly-boiled green beans or a salad. The beans can be boiled in the same water you're soft-boiling your egg in - cuts down on pots :) A little feta or goat's cheese sprinkled over the potatoes is also very nice.

Short, open pasta (like fusilli or orecchiette) or long pasta (like linguini or spaghetti), cooked to package instructions. In a separate pan, just before the pasta is ready, warm up a good splash of olive oil over medium heat, and add the zest of half a lemon, some chili flakes, fresh tarragon and asparagus (dice it if short pasta, and you can do long, thin strips if long pasta). When it's just warmed up enough to make the asparagus go bright green, add the pasta, toss well and season with salt & pepper to taste. Add a little more olive oil and/or pasta water if it needs some lubrication. Remove from the heat and add grated hard cheese (e.g. parmesan, asiago, ricotta salata or aged gouda) which you've grated ideally using a microplane grater. (Note: These are a SUPER useful tool for a new cook - you can grate cheese, citrus zest, ginger, garlic and more without accidentally ripping you fingers off on a box grater and losing half of what you're grating to the holes.) This recipe just screams springtime; it's light but satisfying. 

Shakshuka nearly took over this sub recently, so I won't post a recipe, but definitely look it up. It's SO easy (especially if you're cooking for a few people) and absolutely delicious - and easily customizable.

Another easy peasy brunch recipe is avocado toast, that staple of the millennial diet. My favourite version is: get a good quality bread, toast it well, and add crushed avocado on top (you just mash it with your fork). Season well with salt & pepper, add a poached (again, or soft-boiled) egg on each slice, and then add some Nandos's HOT piri-piri hotsauce (it's got loads of lemon peel pureed in, so it's super fresh tasting and unique). Any hotsauce will do though, like sriracha or Frank's. That and a good coffee will set you up for the day. 

Another very easy recipe that can be made at any time of day (I like it for breakfast on the weekend, but it'd be a lovely lunch or light supper) is a homemade/bastardized version of a delicious egg roti I buy from a local Sri Lankan restaurant. You need a store bought flatbread like a tortilla or a naan. First you beat up an egg in a bowl, and season it with salt and a pinch of turmeric. Then you sear over screaming-high heat some sliced onion - you want it charred but not soft - just enough to take away the raw taste and add some sweetness, but you still want that crunch. White is best for this. Add a small splash of oil, some sliced fresh hot chili pepper (I use a Sri Lankan green chili like a bird's eye - very hot, almost bitter, but great flavour). Pour in the beaten egg and immediately press the flatbread lightly on top. The egg will cook very quickly as you're not using much - when you shake the pan and it moves, you're okay to flip it over and just warm/crisp the flatbread side. Once ready, slide it onto a cutting board and use a sharp knife or a pizza cutter to make slices. I like to serve it with a little dollop of raita, or plain yogurt, and a scattering of cilantro if I have it (parsley works too)."

Stir fry is a great way to enjoy vegetables, because the whole point is to keep them very fresh - a lot of people struggle with overcooked vegetables (they're not palatable even to veggie-lovers). I'd suggest broccoli, peppers, bean sprouts and onion for a good basic stir fry. A lot of people like baby corn, but I have to say it's not a favourite of mine. Water chestnuts have a very interesting crunchy, juicy texture and almost no flavour, so are great in a stir fry. Other fun things could be cauliflower (another lightly-flavoured veggie with good texture, and it absorbs sauce well into its nooks & crannies like broccoli does), zucchini (soaks up sauce like a sponge), eggplant (ditto) and even celery or thinly-sliced carrot for crunch. You can go super traditional or fusion with stir fry - up to you!

Tacos are a very easy transition dish for omnivores - you can do so much with them and you can load them with veggies to make them more healthy. A nice slaw goes wonderfully with ""fish"" style tacos (you can do the fish with Gardein fishless filets, or a battered tofu recipe, or anything else you like)... think red cabbage, daikon, shredded carrot, cilantro, lime juice, fresh jalapenos. 

Another great way to eat more vegetables is soup. You can turn any vegetable into a soup, and it's also a good way to use up leftover veggies hanging around in your fridge. Roasting them first brings out a lot more flavour. 

On the subject of roasting veggies, this is a great way to make them more exciting as side dishes too, or the main event. Brussel sprouts are a classic example of a much-maligned vegetable that really is delicious if prepared correctly. Toss them with olive oil, salt & pepper and any herb you like (a favourite of mine is lemon thyme, but you could also use herbes de Provence for example), and roast at 425F until nicely brown and tender. The flavour will be so much sweeter and nuttier than a steamed brussel sprout. Same goes for broccoli & cauliflower, any root vegetable including things like rutabaga and kohlrabi... certainly sweet potato is a favourite. 

If you roast a variety of veggies in a sheet pan, it's very low-maintenance for you - you just throw them in and leave them there. Once they're ready, you can serve them in a bowl with some feta, a soft-boiled egg, and a sprinkling of fresh parsley for an easy supper. Maybe some crusty bread on the side. 

If you like sharp flavours, you can also fridge-pickle vegetables for a super easy and tasty snack or side dish. It doesn't require processing like shelf-stable pickles do, so you just need a jar, some vinegar, water & spices/sugar, and the vegetables in question. You boil up the brine and pour it over the veggies, and leave it for a few days in the fridge. I love green beans, cauliflower, carrots and fennel pickled. 

You might also like to consider curries, chillies or stews. Every culture has them - you can go Indian, Moroccan, Italian, French, West African, Middle Eastern, Southern US, or any other flavour profile you like. West Africa has some delicious stews involving root vegetables, grains & often peanuts. Very hearty and simple."
