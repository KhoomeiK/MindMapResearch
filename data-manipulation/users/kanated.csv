soccer,fef3xot,t1_fee486x,1579047598.0,"He's not limited. At all. I hate this trend of calling defensive midfielders who are actually focused on their defensive duties ""limited"".

Somehow the technical midfielders who can only do short passes and nothing else are never called that, but the defensive midfielders with the tactical awareness, tackling skills, stamina and physical presence to play their role are ""limited"". 

It makes particularly little sense in Casemiro's case, because he's also a decent passer on top of all that.

TL,DR: stop underrating defensive skills"

And trading has lower odds for good IVs than raids, so good luck getting a good one with the discount. You can lucky trade, but it still doesn't guarantee anything and there are much better Pokémon to lucky trade.

Basically it's one of those Niantic 200 IQ decisions that only looks good if you don't bother actually thinking about them. Like regionals.

Gible came out almost a year ago now and it's still a meme about how rare it is. Haven't seen one in months. Same deal with Riolu. And people think there's nothing wrong with the new Pokémon releases. It's literally just designed to be a waste of time."

soccer,fe6j0uy,t1_fe5hygv,1578892454.0,"In this situation it's not fair though, is it? Getting a red card to avoid a goal with 5 minutes to go is a complete no brainer for the defender. The red card is not a very meaningful punishment at that point in the game, so Atletico created a very dangerous goal opportunity and got pretty much nothing for it.

The unsporting part doesn't make much sense, sports are about competition. If breaking the rules and taking the deserved punishment is what it takes to win, then players should do so. The problem I see here is with the rules not giving adequate punishment."
GameDeals,fe0yxgr,t1_fdzvyym,1578820528.0,Not on an individual case basis. This particular game isn't better because the devs refused Epic. It doesn't make much sense to have that as the top comment in a r/GameDeals thread. People come here to know whether the game is worth playing.
leagueoflegends,fe0vxu5,t1_fe090sf,1578819289.0,"Problem is that ""some"" is just not reliable. The game becomes too binary.

Any melee vs ranged fights just become a ""can the enemy get away from you after you blow your single gap closer?"" problem. If the answer is yes, you're useless. If it's no, then they're dead because to compensate for the unreliability your champion has tons of burst damage.

It's just a balancing nightmare. Even if it can be frustrating, it's much easier to just give those champs shitloads of mobility so their damage output comes out somewhat consistently and then balance around those damage numbers.

People forget for like the first half a decade of LoL's existence there was never a balanced assassin. They were either useless or OP. The closest thing to an assassin that first came to a balanced state was Lee Sin, and it's no coincidence that he was the champ with the most mobility back then."

The 3rd is kind of a mess though. After they rescue Jack and get back to the real world, it feels like it turns into one of the recent movies where they don't really know where to go and just try to force epic moments and Jack becomes a silly boi. It feels like Jack was meant to stay dead, but then he turned out to be a very popular character and they brought him back, which fucked up the whole plot."
