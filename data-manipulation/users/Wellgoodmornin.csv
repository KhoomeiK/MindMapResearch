Trumpgret,fff27j9,t1_ffe7ga0,1579873695.0,I'd think you'd rather vote for someone you disagree with less than just a weak candidate.

Trumpgret,fff1rhi,t1_ffekyyj,1579873328.0,If that's what you took from the comment you're responding to you're an idiot.
politics,ff5srkt,t1_ff58d4k,1579608854.0,"So you say but you don't know. You can speculate all you want. I bet if Al Gore would have won 911 still would have happened, the US still would have gone crazy, Hillary would have been run in 2008 instead of Obama and probably lost because people don't like the Clintons and Republicans were just as up in arms from being out of the white house so long and someone like Trump was elected.

The issue is the system. The system is the reason why 3/4ths of the people I know who voted for Trump said they didn't want to. They felt they didn't have a better choice. That system is never going to change if people like you and them just keep co-signing its bullshit."
politics,ff4l6w8,t1_ff3qn8a,1579566294.0,"Maybe, or all that stuff still would have happened and we'd be stuck in the exact same situation with the same shitty two parties in the same shitty system. 

If you vote for somone, even grudgingly, you're giving your approval to what they stand for and they're just gonna keep doing it. If you don't want that, that approval shouldn't be given."

She pushes the woman around roughly and then progresses to grabbing her face and dragging her by her hair, which is incidentally the first time you do see some form of agression from someone trying to help. Even if someone's having mental issues, if they're physically hurting someone they need to be stopped and non lethal force can be warranted."

It's part of the lore and there's a specific reason for it. To me if you're just changing it to be inclusive then you definitely should just write your own more inclusive story. There's always room for more awesome fantasy stories."
