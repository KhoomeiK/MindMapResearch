He’d driven from a bad neighborhood to a good one (hours away) in an old, beat-up car, and they were just sure he was dealing. Poor guy is about as straight-laced as they come.

What we’re saying is that it’s an unproven and untested treatment and it is therefore risky, especially to try it on your own.

YouShouldKnow,fdqp5uz,t1_fdqgjjw,1578671867.0,"I don’t want to sound pro-suicide, but I think this is a bit of a simplistic look at things. For example, someone who’s suffering from a painful, chronic condition isn’t necessarily leaving behind more than grief/sadness for others. This is different from someone who’s made some really bad life decisions and kills themself to “escape,” leaving others to clean up the aftermath of their choices (like debt, a family to take care of, legal issues, etc)."
YouShouldKnow,fdqor31,t1_fdql6yf,1578671611.0,"I agree with you, especially that first bit. People often say “suicide is selfish,” but I think they have no idea the sort of pain the suicidal person is experiencing. Saying it would hurt person B for person A to end their life really belittles person A’s suffering. It’s like saying, “I don’t care how awful your life is, you have to be here for *MEE*.” Who’s selfish now?

To clarify, I’m not trying to argue for suicide being good. It’s just, I’ve been there, and those sorts of statements hurt more than they helped. Like, I’m so unimportant that my suffering doesn’t matter next to other people’s potential sadness.

It really takes a lot more than a blanket statement to deal with something as serious as suicidalism. To really help, you need to get to the root of the problem and offer some sort of hope. Even if not, “We can fix this,” at least, “We can make this bearable, and you won’t have to do it alone.”
