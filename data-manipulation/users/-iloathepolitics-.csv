Ya know, aside from the fact that he was just charged with multiple felonies. I'd say possible prison time qualifies as a ""fall"" one would prefer to avoid, no? I'm not sure I trust him either, but pretending he doesn't have incentive to turn on Donald is ridiculous. C'mon."

The only thing that softens the edge on all this, is knowing that he must be absolutely miserable. He looks like he doesn't sleep anymore; his eyes are constantly bloodshot and his bags are getting bigger and bigger. His speech is different too. He's just not a confident speaker anymore, and his eyes look dead. Couldn't have happened to a shittier guy."
politics,fffcnym,t1_fff46a2,1579881039.0,"John McCain was never Lindsey Graham's friend, much less best friend. He was simply a man that Graham thought had coattails long enough to carry him. A means to an end. And he's using Donald, however ridiculous it may seem to us, the same way. Lindsey just doesn't have the character required to make it on his own. He has to latch onto someone, or it becomes quickly apparent that he stands for absolutely nothing except himself. He's incredibly weak, and he's just sad. The Lindsey we see now is the one he's been all along. The difference is that McCain's mythos was enough to cover Lindsey, but now that that's gone, we see the real person he is. It's really really ugly and absolutely pathetic.  And it's 100% Lindsey Graham. A true coward."

news,fe5k8jt,t1_fe5922k,1578870459.0,"The things they say about Michelle are particularly disgusting and racist. I was in Army Aviation during the last few years of Bush, and then for most of Obama's first term. After President Obama took office, there was a very noticeable shift in the way people talked about politics, and it was very very ugly. I heard pilots and officers that I very much respected prior to this, describe her as a gorilla or an ape, talk about her ""manly"" appearance, and openly ponder if the size of her feet correlated to the size of her penis.  These same people today are making those same statements on Fox comment sections, or at least were when I deleted FB. They talk about how stupid AOC is, without a shred of the irony they should feel. The guy they worship literally can not speak in complete sentences, displays a fundamental misunderstanding of nearly every subject, and worst of all to me, has absolutely zero curiosity about the world or desire to learn more about anything in it. The people I'm describing are not dumb people. Most of them are educated, have nice families and are active in their communities. They're also viciously racist and sexist. They always have been, they were just fooling some of us before. But racism in public is back on the menu, and let me tell you, there's a lot of these fucks that couldn't be more excited."
politics,fe55kdn,t1_fe4mybd,1578865830.0,"Out of curiosity, have you been to many other luxury hotels? 

Anecdotally, I actually knew a few people who set up a conference in 2014 at Trump Doral, down in South Florida. They were holding an Alchoholics Anonymous conference there, which is honestly kind of indicative of how the property was doing then. Almost every other hotel they tried wasn't interested in even having serious discussion about it, because, well, AA isn't paying well. Doral apparently said yes extremely quickly, according to them. They said that there didn't seem to be a whole lot of people there that weren't in AA, and that the place was rather run-down, which surprised them. I don't remember hearing them talk about bedbugs at all, but I do remember them talking about there being multiple complaints about roaches. The last thing I remember was them talking about how all of the hospitality staff was Hispanic. (When I spoke with them about it, it was around the time when he was saying all that racist stuff about Hispanic people.) Like I said, it's anecdotal, but it's an interesting conversation to think about how."

He brought it up again in front of the crowd and said ""Ten times, right? Ten times? [Does a flushing motion] Not me of course, but you. You.""

aww,fdzbcxe,t1_fdy1uzs,1578788488.0,"Yep! A friend of mine got 7 or 8 years in a Fed prison stemming from some drug trafficking charges, and after a few years with no problems, he was able to participate in the service dog program. Unfortunately, after he was in the program for a while, he got into a fight with another inmate and he was no longer allowed to be a part of it. He tried to act like it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell he was devastated. 

I just imagine how nice it would be to hang with a dog in that environment. I've never been to prison, but I know it's a place where you can't really allow your emotions to show. You can't let yourself be vulnerable. So I'm sure petting, playing, and rolling around with a pup when it's not actively training is pretty cathartic."

I agree with the overall point of your comment for sure, but if you consistently take opioids, you're going to get addicted. You said that's not necessarily true. A physical addiction is gonna happen if they're taken consistently, I don't think there's any way around that. Is your argument that if you're physically addicted to your prescribed opiates, that it's not a full blown addiction? I'm just a little confused by the ""not necessarily"" part."

politics,fdruaap,t1_fdrpqbi,1578689815.0,"I'm not trying to shame you or make some dramatic point, I'm really not, but is there a point where you'd decide that things ARE worth jeopardizing your job over? For the sake of this discussion, let's say they begin investigating people who have made online comments critical of Donald. Would you decide it's worth it then? What about if they begin detaining those people? Then? If there was evidence that they did way more in 2020 than 2016, like physically change votes, (which I find hard to believe they didn't in 16 if they were already in there, at least on some scale, but it's way more likely in 20), would that be enough? Maybe these things still sound hyperbolic to some at this point, but facism isn't like a light switch, it's a million little cuts. I think all of the above example are quite possible if not probable if he wins in 2020. 

I don't have a family. I'm a single 31 year old that can pretty much do whatever I want, when I want. I don't know what it's like to think about all of these things with a family in mind. I'm just interested in when it becomes too much for people that don't have the amount of freedom that I do. Like I said, I'm not trying to shame you, or people like you, or make you feel guilty or anything. And I really do mean that. I'm sympathetic to the situation. I just think that the time is rapidly approaching where people who have more responsibility than me are going to have to make a decision, a really really hard one. I hope I'm being dramatic, but I really don't believe I am."

I'll never forgive these people and I'll NEVER forget them and their bullshit justifications. I hate this so much. 

One thing though. If 2020 is stolen like the last one was, and I think it's more likely than not, when my back is all the way against the wall, I'm not just gonna give in. And I sure hope that most others feel like that too. If 2020 doesn't save us from full on facism, it's completely on us at that point."

worldnews,fdi4k22,t1_fdhkd49,1578435614.0,"Thank you for pointing this out. It's easy to focus solely on the Infantrymen and the people in direct combat roles. And they should get the lion's share of the credit, they're at the very front and every other role in the military is there to support them. But the people you pointed out have scars that run very deep as well. I was a crew member on a MedEvac helicopter. My job was to maintain the bird and fly with it, but also to assist the medic in any way they needed. Our number one goal was to get to the injured as quickly as humanly possible and simply keep them alive until we reached the next level of care. Usually Baghdad, or Balad if they had a head injury and were stable enough to last the extra flight time it took to get there. My MOS was simply a Blackhawk maintainer, but that ends up meaning very little when it's just you, the medic and a horrifically injured individual on the floor of a UH-60. I still remember what it feels like to have someone else's blood drying to your uniform and skin. I remember the blood soaked, soot-covered faces with completely blank expressions and eyes that said more than words ever could. I can still hear the voices of young men screaming for their parents over the roar of the blades and two jet engines. And I remember vividly how blood pools on top of Iraqi desert sand before it slowly becomes absorbed. I would never compare my experiences with that of someone in a direct combat role, but we have our issues too. I think one of the things that has saved me from worse issues than I already have, is the fact that I didn't know the people that ended up on my helicopter. I know their faces, and I know their injuries, but I don't know them and their stories. That isn't the case for those that are out there on the line. They know each other intimately, more so than most husbands and wives.

The United States government has proved time and time again that the citizens of Iraq are not important to them, that they're always an afterthought. If that. I don't blame these people for hating us. I've been to Iraq.  The overwhelming majority of Iraqi people I met there are simply trying to survive and we continually make that more difficult for them.
