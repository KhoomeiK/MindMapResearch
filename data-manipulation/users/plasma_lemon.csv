BokuNoHeroAcademia,fer9zqb,t1_feqfxb1,1579351601.0,"Did he injure his arm more? The doctor said ""I examined your whole body, but other than your arm, there seems to be nothing out of the ordinary... But how did your arm end up like that --"" but Deku cuts him off to ask about how everyone else is doing, then Aizawa comes in and takes Deku.

I was under the impression that the doctor was commenting on the previous damage Deku did to his arm from his fight against Muscular and all of that stuff that happened at the camp."

depression,fctyb1h,t1_fctvth2,1577965590.0,"I'm aware of that sub and the philosophy. I'm asking why is it okay to basically call someone out and accuse them of being a cruel person as soon as they mention that they have had kids, regardless of context."
depression,fctkzc5,t1_fct6n2t,1577947113.0,"Did I miss something? Why is it suddenly okay to shame people for having kids? Why is it okay to imply that the act of procreation is inherently evil, and that *anyone* who reproduces has committed a crime against humanity?"

I also got 5 keys easily on my 2 week old account: https://i.imgur.com/G6TZdo4.png

On my 1 week old account though I can barely get 2 keys. Don't have Lucius on that account yet. Although I do have an L+ Tasi... still trying to get a 2nd Tasi on my main account lol"
