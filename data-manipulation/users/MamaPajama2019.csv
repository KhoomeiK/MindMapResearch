I've been trying to be more mindful.  Started yoga.  Interacting with others who don't stress me.  But something triggered me"

BipolarReddit,ffsj80h,t1_ffrlh0j,1580183027.0,I find taking my ADHD meds helps a lot with this.  It's like trying to tune a radio and you're getting a lot of static between stations.  Taking my meds helps me stay tuned into the station I want instead of the non-stop inner dialogue and or music.
bipolar,ffr78y2,t3_euowg2,1580151977.0,That's an amazing photograph. Keep up with it the photography.  You have a great eye.
bipolar,ffoswu6,t1_ffn4q6y,1580081322.0,"I tried Wellbutrin a long time ago.  It didn't work well for me.  I'm very stable on my current cocktail of cymbalta and lamictal, taking Klonopin as needed.  Just below baseline a bit.  Nothing drastic, just unexpected.  In hindsight I should have known something was off.  I recently cut my hair, have been looking at new hair colors and getting another tattoo.  My go-to coping techniques."
bipolar,ffmrx2u,t1_ffmeemv,1580058300.0,I've been stable for a long time.  Maybe that's why it feels so much worse

CasualConversation,fc6b5yj,t3_eg2xbs,1577476485.0,"Doing laundry never, ever ends.  You can wash everything, relish the empty hamper, and by the end of the day it's got more clothing in it. 

I'm teaching my son's how to do laundry so now one hangs everything up to dry and the other folds.  I match socks while watching TV or when someone tells me they are running out. 

When I have ignored the sheets, blankets and towels for as long as possible, I'll go to the laundromat for three hours and wash everything.  I'm up to four laundry bags right now."
