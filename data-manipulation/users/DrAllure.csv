Maybe you guys are all right, but when I look at this film. I don't see comedy, I don't see anything from the OG Mulan, and I don't see anywhere near as much the cultural impact the other originals had. At least I imagine the west will have a much more mediocre outing.

Then theres political/health stuff too.

Also the director is a complete nobody, at least when Marvel does a random I've at least heard/seen their other films. But a 300 million budget for this? That makes it one of the most expensive films of all time, like almost as much as the last two avengers which had a billion characters."

Basic communication and numeracy skills are very helpful, but the last few years of schools tends to move away into crazy stuff. However, for the last few years of school, critical thinking is the only thing that matters. 

An ability to be able to think outside the box and see other people's POV and attack a problem from a new side, and be able to link a current problem to something else stored in your memory. That's what you want. That's intelligence and it's incredibly hard to teach, but that's what schools are meant to be providing you with. 

Knowledge itself is fairly useless, concrete dates for example. It's all google-able nowadays. Critical thinking is what you need to focus on.

Whether or not your school work helps with that is another matter. But ultimately they're mostly not a big deal. Be sure to enjoy life as well. Keep a good balance."

They put themselves in this wierd corner where they want her to be attractive, but they want her to be tough, but then they also want a lead who can do comedy. Personally I felt that mix just didn't work for Brie Larson.

For Star Lord it works a treat, he can do comedy and tough, and while he used to be fat, Marvel just puts all the guys in a gym and they get to become hot. Even that pakistani comedian guy now has a 6 pack bc he's gonna be in the eternals. 

But for their girls they just seem to overwhelmingly struggle imo. I think the problem is that with guys, they try and pick funny people and then make them hot via a gym routine. But with girls, they try and pick hot ones and then make them funny/tough. It falls flat for me. 

The issue is absurdly political (hence downvotes incoming), ppl obessing over gender equality and stuff, but I think the best writers of women, are people who don't see them as women or feminity, but just see them as characters who happen to be female. George RR Martin comes to mind here, he has a spectacular array of female characters in ASOIAF, and not all fall into the hollywood trope where they just kill off all femininity. Olenna, Margaery and Sansa are all good examples of solid characters that still have femininity in tact. While others like Brienne are a good example of moving away from it. Perhaps like how some of their male characters like Sam move away from masculinity.

Take Maleficient 2 which came out last year, budget of about 180 million, yet it needed 480 million box office to break even.

Only the action/superhero part of TDK and its sequel managed to make the box office huge (3 times the first film).

Going back to a noir style seems risky as far as financial success goes, especially with these sort of actors.

I'm keen to see what it's like but its a bit left field. From memory the bad guy in Dawn of the Apes was very 1 dimensional tho"

It appears from ages 11 - early adulthood 18?, he was in the care of hospital/nuns and was reducated before being free to go where he pleased."

Games,fdcs5bf,t1_fdb1tup,1578282749.0,"Just play turbo.

After 10000 normal games I started to switch to turbo. Now I've been exclusive turbo mode for almost 2 years. Took a lil while to readjust to the new pace, the new meta, the new everything, but once that was done, Its beautiful and i've started converting my friends lol

Its fucking great. It has it's own meta, games go for 20-30 mins and your ban is 100% guaranteed. 

Anything shit happens in the game, doesn't matter, its over in 20 mins. Noobs fighting over mid? Doesnt matter.

It's what I love about it. It's dota on fucking steroids and with all the cancer teammates removed. I don't get the anger or anxiety in me anymore.

Best of all, apart from the ""warm-up turbo"" players, people all take it pretty seriously. That is, people still WANT to win, they just dont lose their shit when stuff goes against them."

55 million budget, earnt 352 worldwide. Whodunnit with famous actors in basically every role.

Based on a classic Agatha Christie novel, and now Knives Out has shown that the market is alive, it wasn't just a one off.

I imagine Death on the Nile will do well too.

Bit like those small horror films in the past 5 years that have done milllllions"

This seems to be what happens. As toxic as Lib gets, the still end up with lots of votes because the people ""sticking it to libs"" end up still supporting libs indirectly."
