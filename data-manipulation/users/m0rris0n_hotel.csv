dndmemes,fdpk2hp,t3_emkvvh,1578630777.0,"Advance planning is your best option. Not micromanaging. Just having a rough plot framework and then adapting to the players actions as you go. 

Over the years I’ve learned that the tighter you plot the adventure the less likely it is things will work out as planned. 

Having rough plot hooks set up in advance leaves you time to do anything else you need to do. Which for me, means painting miniatures. That’s the real time sink"

MurderedByWords,fcms2d8,t3_ei0mws,1577789462.0,"Unfortunately it’s not just conspiracy-minded people. We are all biased and need to confront those biases whenever possible. 

It’s easy to fall into the trap of believing that you see the world fully and others do not. That’s where having the time and motivation to really look in depth on a particular topic is important. 

Everyone is entitled to an informed opinion. No one is entitled to an ignorant one. Lacking the facts and nuances of a subject does not help you find your way. Unfortunately too many people believe things can be summed up quickly and easily. These days that is rarely the case"

dndnext,fck4u0o,t3_ehm2e4,1577716626.0,">	At the end of the scene, there is no official order to go on the mission. Indy *choose to go on an adventure.

Kind of. The follow up scene is Indy talking about how the government agreed to the terms he and Marcus set for him to go. Their presence there was basically an offer. It just happened to be one he was primed to take. 

Regardless, seeding your games with motivations for the players is always a good idea. It’s a long way from the early adventures where it was designed to practically force players into situations. 

Railroading is rarely fun but is occasionally necessary"
