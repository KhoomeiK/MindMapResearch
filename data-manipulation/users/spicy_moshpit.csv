AskReddit,ffgxjns,t1_ffgfr0d,1579917622.0,Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. What you’re saying is 100% true. Doesn’t mean education isn’t way too expensive in America though.
engineering,ffgwo9b,t3_etjxwo,1579916969.0,Made a smart mirror for my fathers day last year. Also did a machine learning study on the stock market to help me understand why time in the market is usually >>>> trying to time the market.
engineering,ffdxj05,t1_ffdqzrf,1579831394.0,"Just want to point out that there a probably not more jobs for CS compared to CompE. More than half the CompE majors at my school have gotten internships for software engineering, and other CS type jobs. CompE From my experience is just as marketable as CS, maybe even more because you have a better background for embedded systems and hardware design. Not saying CS is bad by any means, they’re both great degrees and anyone who pursues either will have a fruitful career."
learnprogramming,ffaw4oz,t3_eslulg,1579745865.0,I don’t think anyone will want to hire you to freelance if you’re still learning. Best i can think if is getting a part time internship. Im in my second year of Computer Engineering and that’s what i do for money on the side.
AskEngineers,ff7sak4,t3_es4nua,1579657140.0,"Worth a shot. If you don’t ask, it’s as good as quitting."
AskEngineers,ff3wzdd,t1_ff3v2xl,1579550678.0,"I don’t mean close to engineering. Let me try and explain a little better. You agree you have skills that a mechanical engineer has, right? And would you agree there a many jobs in the world that could use those skills, right? You agree that some, maybe even a majority of those jobs don’t have the title of mechanical engineer, right? Hopefully this helps you understand what i mean a little bit. 

Just because your degree is in something does NOT mean that’s the only job you can get. For example, my father was a chemistry major, went into sales, and became a General Contractor. None of his jobs were “chemist”, but he was able to get a sales job at a chemical company because of his chemistry degree. 

Maybe search for jobs in broader terms. If you are struggling finding a job with a mechE degree, you will struggle with any other degree probably more unless you know someone in the field already."
AskEngineers,ff3r00m,t1_ff3pbtq,1579546975.0,"Agreed, but what I’m really trying to get at is that you seem unable to find a job with your mechE degree. Have you tried looking for something related but not exact? I find it hard to believe that you can find ZERO jobs close to what you want to be doing with that degree. I’ve never heard that before."
AskEngineers,ff3os3o,t1_ff3nqod,1579545622.0,"I think one thing you’re failing to realize is that a large amount of people that graduate with a certain degree go into a field related to, but not with the same title as their degree indicates. I know plenty of people with Electrical Engineering  degrees working in IT, and people with Math degrees working as Software engineers. You cant just do such a simple test to see if the market is saturated or not."
AskEngineers,fecbbdu,t1_fec9r75,1578970060.0,Apply to places? Unless you know someone I’m pretty sure that’s the best way. Just apply to like 200 places or until you get something.
news,fds2uc8,t1_fdrscb8,1578693531.0,Trump killed their leader not too long ago. I don’t like trump either but come on. That’s just not even close to true.

college,fdg2mu7,t3_el6jgz,1578377733.0,"If your comparing an ivy to another big 4-year, when getting a job it doesn’t matter much. When learning and getting your education though, it is nice to be surrounded by like minded individuals who value education. Now it may matter in some situations, but a majority from my experience as well as my friends/family, only care that you have a degree from somewhere in the field they’re looking for. Everything else like projects and other experience tend to outweigh what school you actually went to."
college,fdedgp2,t3_ekwo8a,1578336624.0,Only reason I don’t want to is because of athletics. Has started to cause a lot more stress than it’s worth but am afraid to quit.
college,fded9es,t3_eky3hm,1578336498.0,"Usually well rounded lives. They don’t live through academics, but they understand they’re important and try very hard. Most important thing from my experience is work ethic. The best students always have a great work ethic in common."
learnprogramming,fd6o13i,t3_ek6n11,1578193640.0,"Im probably in the minority, but i love listening to rap when coding. Like lil uzi and artists like that. Also a fan of country too but only certain songs for coding. I found for me that the best songs for productivity are ones that have a simple or repeatable rhythm/beat."
college,fcxu304,t3_ejeuio,1578070501.0,"I thought UIUC was my dream school when applying, ended up getting admitted to their engineering school with generous aid too. Ended up going to Pitt because i wanted to play D1 baseball though and don’t regret it one bit. Just because a school is “rated” better doesn’t mean anything. Your education is what you make of it. I personally was able to get internships at big tech companies regardless of Pitt being ranked significantly lower than UIUC for Engineering. 

As for social life, that i can say the school does matter. My advice is to find the school that meets a happy medium of cost and what you want your social life to be like. I have a lot of friends at Illinois state who love it there by the way. Best of luck! If you need any advice feel free to ask."
Pitt,fcuy4rb,t1_fcuxvky,1577990851.0,It’s not a scholarship. It’s need based aid usually given to out of state students. Contact admissions about it if you have questions.
Pitt,fcuxheq,t3_ej0yyi,1577990494.0,Probably nothing? Might qualify for the for the panther pride award though. That’s not merit based however.
EngineeringStudents,fctomma,t3_eiuiw5,1577951717.0,"Just put in the time you feel you need to succeed.  Don’t over work yourself and don’t worry to hard about getting all A’s. 6 is a lot to handle but as with most things in life, if you want to succeed bad enough, you’ll find a way. Just remember to take breaks and relax when you can."
ECE,fcto77y,t3_eiutr6,1577951129.0,Varies widely depending on the company. Maybe ask them exactly what the status is that’s associated with the position?
EngineeringStudents,fcro8dd,t3_eilt0x,1577904403.0,Find a fun project to work on if you want to do something academic. But most importantly see your friends and be social. You are on BREAK after all.
EngineeringStudents,fc3ggiy,t3_efzno5,1577389260.0,You can for sure. Might need to take some pre reqs but it’s 100% possible. I know people who have done it.
EngineeringStudents,fc35x38,t3_efy6l3,1577382232.0,I don’t see any reason you wouldn’t put that on from what you’ve said.
learnprogramming,fc1pfhi,t1_fc1p79o,1577325556.0,"What? I was offered full time remote work. I instead chose to work remote half the time. So from my experience it is definitely possible to work remote out of college, but i have no idea how hard it is to find. This seems directly applicable to what OP is asking?"
