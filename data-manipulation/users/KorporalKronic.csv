i really like how it will always cost 2 mana wow worth it!

very nice the wording says "" put the card into your hand""  oooh i see now, thank you :D i imagine people run emrakul for the same reason as Draco, but you could actually hard cast him. thanks again! i made a lil deck list based on your help :D

lets be real what blue deck doesnt jam in aditional turns, rifts, counterspells and the like! i def see the strong potential in runnign scry effects and top type cards, do you normally tutor for these or you find you have enough you can mull into them?

does the ninjutsu ability allow her to keep coming in for U/B or does it cost an additional 2 colourless each time? alternatively do they stack? if you play it once for 3 and on your third commander cast you do the ninjutsu, would that cost 6? 

also not sure how draco is effective? i thought you couldnt produce or have mana that isnt in the colours of the commander, therefore only having it decrease its cost by 4?"
