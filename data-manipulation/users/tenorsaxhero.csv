roasting,ffgqwms,t1_ffgdydk,1579912775.0,"Not gonna lie, but that roast looks absolutely amazing for both a Pan roast and because it's a natural processed coffee.

I put a PID controller and IMS performance screen/silicone group gasket and it pulls some fantastic shots.

Explanation for PID: it's a better thermostat. Instead of overshooting, it goes to the set temperature in an arch and keeps it there. Think when you're driving a car. The PID sees the temp and engages the element through the solid state relay to up the temp and off as needed.

It's a great machine."

1. You need something to contain the chaff from roasting.

2. You need a gas hookup for it.

3. You need a decently powerful exhaust fan unless you want a smoke filled room.

4. You need a contingency plan for if the roaster is either offline or something fucks up.

5. In some places, you need to comply with EPA regulations or business regulations if in a strip mall. 

6. Lease terms may prevent modifications to walls which are needed for some roasters.

7. It's loud as fuck. With all 3 roasters online (5lb, 45lb and 132lb roaster, it's hard as fuck to hear anyone who comes in. 

8. You lose 15-20% of green coffee weight depending on how dark you roast. 

9. You would be hard pressed to find a head roaster, as the average wage is ~$15/hr.

10. If you don't know what you are doing, it can be super dangerous.

We have a 130 lb Roaster at my work that's worth roughly half a million dollars and took a year to bring online.
