I like variety, so I try a six pack of one of kind or another, and if I like it I keep buying that brand.  Pretty soon they start ordering more of that brand and and the price goes up $1.50 a six pack and I move on to a different brand.  The price of my last selection ultimately comes down because now their overstocked with it and they raise the price of my current beer and I move on to yet another selection.  I have been playing this game with them for about 2 years now."
