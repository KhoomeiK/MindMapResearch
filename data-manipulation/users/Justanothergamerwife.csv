AmItheAsshole,fghqu7r,t1_fghi94p,1580791311.0,">Part of being a parent is pushing your own shit aside to take care of your kids and then having a breakdown once they're cared for.

Yep. I can have the emotional meltdown I need when the kids are safe and looked after. I can experience every terrifying emotion *after* I know the kids are ok.

Thankfully I tend to emotionally shut down in emergencies and enter full on robot mode. It's easy to see what to do when your emotions die and all that's left is the Prime Directive: *Keep kids alive, healthy, and untraumatized.*"
HumansBeingBros,fghhjmx,t1_fggwfkc,1580784961.0,"Seriously contemplating homeschool for my third grader.

She's dyslexic and probs ADHD - and last year was hard enough, but now she has a teacher that just doesn't seem to understand that my baby girl isn't like the other kids. She works her ass off every night doing homework, and often misses recess to finish classwork, and I've watched her slowly lose her love of learning, and her confidence, and she's starting to have behavior issues at home because of all the stress.

I've finally sent her teacher a note that I will not be allowing her to work more than one hour a night, we will not be doing homework on the weekends, and I would appreciate it if she stopped keeping her in at recess until AFTER her evaluation (which is through school and is taking forever).

Your story is very encouraging. It's hard to watch my sweet little fairy child become a shell of herself."

WeirdEggs,fg5j00y,t3_ewrsam,1580528780.0,"Ok, I sort of love Walmart eggs. Not the regular ones. The jumbo.

Jumbo eggs never disappoint.

Oddly huge? Yep, there's at least one egg in the carton that's twice the size of the other ""jumbo"" eggs.

Wrinkly shells? Pretty much always.

Double yolks? Oh yes. I once cracked four different eggs and got four double yolks. It was the highlight of my breakfast career.

But I've never gotten one so weirdly round! Very cool."

Yes. Except he shorted her $200 that she had to cover in living expenses because he bought the tv. He's a grade A doofus and not a great partner if he's making it so he gets his way to the detriment of OP."
AmItheAsshole,fg2iwil,t1_fg2ib5s,1580445892.0,"He should have a say, but in another comment she mentions he shorted her on living expenses (that she had to cover) so he could buy the TV, which boils down to him using her money to pay for it. He's the AH."
AmItheAsshole,fg2hj3h,t1_fg1n5oc,1580445119.0,"Right? Also, when someone says, ""tonight I'll cook salmon,"" in the (I'm assuming) casual talk about plans for the day, then it's not a promise. It's what she planned to do, but guess what? Plans change! And if the maker of food (for adults!) realizes at the end of a long day that they just need to rest? Let the foodmaker rest! 

Food is work, OP. And your lack of compassion for another tired human is pretty terrible."
AmItheAsshole,fg2dmax,t1_fg19up9,1580443014.0,"This was my guess. The coolest people she knows have mental illnesses. And 12 year olds aren't the best at sensing what might be offensive. Or stupid.

Who knows. This fascination might lead to her studying psychology and helping people. But for now, she's 12, and 12 year olds are weird."

Parenting,ffyz7j8,t1_ffxhhzx,1580359004.0,"Same. Like if my kid is losing it because the sippy cup is in the wrong cupholder, I know that I don't need to stress about it. Baby's not hurt or hungry, I'm not neglecting baby, etc... This isn't something I can rely fix, other than showing her (when she's calm) how to fix her problem.

This is what makes it ESH to me. Losing thousands of dollars and missing a big vacation would be totally worth it to me to have ALL my kids with me, and not leaving one behind.

All the daughter is going to see is, ""Sorry kid, you feeling loved and included in my new family isn't worth the money I'd lose."" Or, ""This vacation is more important to me than you.""

And OP is surprised that she doesn't want to be around someone who drops her when things go sideways."

If *he* needs support to get through you giving birth, then he needs to be out in the waiting room with his father. He can be supported out there.

YOU are the one who should have support.

The more I hear about this, the more I think you might just want to go live with your mom for a while, so you can be supported through pregnancy/recovery as well.

Pregnancy and childbirth are stressful enough *without* the insanity those two are bringing."

AmItheAsshole,ffpwmso,t1_ffneb7f,1580108619.0,"Hey man, I know I'm late to the party, but here's my take: anyone who has ever loved a gamer has had times when they wanted that gamer's attention, but s/he was too absorbed in the game to respond.

My bet is she's picturing trying to have a conversation with you, or wanting some comfort from you, but you're too close to beating the boss to notice/give all of your undivided attention.

Now I'm not saying this is going to be you, but when you're scared of the next 12 hours it would be upsetting to see your one source of comfort passing attention to a game. 

So I don't think you're an AH, but maybe try to sleep when she's sleeping."
AmItheAsshole,ffe1l6w,t1_ffe08g5,1579834323.0,"I'm not disagreeing with that. I was telling OP to get comfortable with imperfect pictures, because they're perfectly acceptable. 

No specific photos are needed, just point the camera when the whim comes, and live in the moment.

I'm just trying to let her know that it's ok to lower her picture taking standards, and candids that aren't perfect can actually be great"
AmItheAsshole,ffdw44a,t1_ffdas9i,1579830387.0,"I can agree with this YTA - and honestly, u/probablyterrible101 just get used to taking pictures on your phone. 

Pictures don't have to be fancy. The putting them into collages can wait until after the baby is sleeping through the night, starts kindergarten, or heck it might even be a super great bonding experience to do this with #3 when s/he's older.

The only reason YTA is because of the flippancy. Your husband is rightly worried that the last baby will get ignored. The better option would have been, ""I'm so overwhelmed, I'm going to need help. I don't think I can do this on my own.""

But in all reality, just train yourself to take pictures even if they aren't perfect. You might find that #3 ends up with way more pictures than the older two. (And some of my favorite pictures of my kids are weird angles and silly faces, or stacks of dishes in the background, or one in the middle of a sneeze!)

AmItheAsshole,ffdrc7p,t1_ffd9dvs,1579827034.0,"Right? Like, if OP was offering it then that is a beautiful gift to give to a parent, but when you sign up to be a parent you don't get to expect other people to deal with your kids. I participated in their creation, I'm responsible for them."
AskReddit,ffb7p3r,t1_ffawsi8,1579754173.0,">He also doesn’t complain when I grind in Pokemon Shield for 3 hours.

The best thing about being married to a gamer is he totally gets it when I lose myself in something.

I can get totally absorbed into whatever my addiction of the month is, but he gets it. He'll take care of the kids solo for a weekend while I'm stuck in good book because he's been lost in good games. He supports me spending money on dumb shit (provided we budget for it) because he knows he doesn't have to defend his Steam library to me.

And sometimes there are really sweet moment; like for Christmas we bought Halo for the kids and they spent many nights blowing each other up and laughing SO hard. ""Dad! You dropped right on my head!"" 

No regrets here!"
