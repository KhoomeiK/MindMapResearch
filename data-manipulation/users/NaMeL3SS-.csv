Minecraft,fcldvk8,t1_fclddqn,1577745529.0,"Well I can try but there is too much to say and if I sum up a 30 minute video, it will be a lot to read and people are just lazy, additionally, I think that it’s more accessible for the larger audience to watch a video rather than reading a really long text. If I see that no one watch this video I’ll make a summary. Thanks for the proposition."
Minecraft,fcldgqu,t1_fcld0j8,1577745259.0,"I don’t really feel this way, mojang is a really big company and they don’t care, I would even say it’s normal for a company to do what the consumer ask for. Furthermore, I never asked to do it in an agressive or offensive way, I just want them to acknowledge my recommendations and then they act as they want."
Minecraft,fcld5et,t1_fclcp0s,1577745055.0,"I know but that exclude all the bedrock edition player and the people with bad computer. I want Minecraft to be enjoyable for everyone. I also think that as explained in the video, using mod gets really weird when you start using more than two because the goals that the developers had while making them were different and mods never made me feel the same way as vanilla Minecraft, this is why I think we should improve it rather than modify it."

depression,fc9y8rp,t3_egug09,1577559993.0,"Hey, after seeing this post you made, I looked at your account and I can definitely relate to you, I have problems finding my sexuality, I always sacrifice for people, often people that don’t even deserve it. I’m this type of friend that people hang out with until they find someone “cooler” witch is pretty common as I don’t do drug, don’t smoke, care about people, care about the planet, this isn’t “cool” people stuff. I just wanted to tell you that you are not alone. If you’re willing to talk it’ll be an honor. You are not pointless, you made me feel less lonely, finding someone that can understand you is amazing, something I needed for a long time."
