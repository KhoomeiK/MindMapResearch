Saxophonics,fek6z4a,t3_epjpcb,1579193906.0,"There are tuning drones on Spotify or YouTube or other streaming services. You need to build a connection between your ear and horn. So pick a tuning note. Any really. Then play your saxophone until the note matches what you are hearing. A third step is to check on a tuner to make sure you're right. It's important to build up trust with you ear so don't look at the tuner first!! Play the note until your ear says it's right and then check. Do this as part of your practice every day. There's a tuner called TE tuner on the play store and that's great because it will show you the last ten seconds of the note you played on a graph so you can get that visual aid, after you've tested your ears. Do this up and down the saxophone on a regular basis and playing any saxophone in tune will become second nature."
