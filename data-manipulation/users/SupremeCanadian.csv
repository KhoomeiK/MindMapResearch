It's trying to convince people in the middle that being a feminist is inherently ugly or leads to ugliness.

Think of it like the pictures of AOC neocons like posting around. 'Don't be like this or else you're in league with these ugly fuckers, or if you already agree then that means you're probably one yourself.'

AskReddit,fd1vutl,t1_fd0ci3b,1578137620.0,"I tried the same thing once, bringing a bat to school. My mom knew very well what was happening to me at the time (and repeatedly giving all sorts of shit to the faculty, which did not do much) and told me not to, that the police wouldn't take so kindly to that sort of planned violence. 

So she essentially told me to freak out the next time someone did something, and if I did get into trouble, detention, suspended or anything, she'd take me out for dinner and a movie that day.

So next time, I threw a chair at a guy that was calling me names when the teacher was out of the room, punched a girl in the stomach for butting ahead of me in line at the microwave (saying something along the lines of 'you've eaten enough fatty' while doing so) and tried to stab a guy in the face with a pencil for throwing his pencil stubs at me.

Never got into trouble with anybody, not even my homeroom teacher when the bullies went to him. I think he understood that I was at my limit and the school was doing jackshit to protect me, or maybe he was just as 'I don't give a shit' as the rest of the faculty but it happened to fall into my favor for once."
