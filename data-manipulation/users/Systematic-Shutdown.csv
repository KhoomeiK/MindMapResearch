AskReddit,fenv13u,t3_eq1wzh,1579291257.0,"They say money doesn't buy happiness, but thats wrong, for a lot of people. What would make me 100% happy is seeing $1 billion in multiple investment accounts in my name. Accounts with no penalties for removing the money, obviously. 

I could do a lot with that amount of money. The lives I would change, or at least brighten would be so significant to me, that I'd likely be happy the rest of my days (aside from obvious sad moments). I've always wanted to gather my family together and say ""do what you want with your lives. Work if you want. Just do what makes you happy"". 

I've also always wanted to go to low income areas and pay for everything the children need for school/winter clothes/food. I'd like to set up multiple charities. Build wells in Africa, as well as pay for more disease prevention. Help cleanup the earth. 

Most of all, I'd like to help bankroll an organization like Ashton Kutcher's ""Thorn"". I'd hire more experts in the field, and pay them to do what they do best (investigate, hunt, bring those horrible types of people to justice, and save women and children being held against their will). I'd also spend my days working along side them, and doing everything I can to bring those families back together. 

The last paragraph is something I'm very passionate about. I actually get emotionally upset and often cry when I happen to hear another news story about a child going missing (I avoid the news as much as possible). The ""have you seen me posters in grocery stores"". It almost feels like I can emotionally put myself in their position, and it causes me to go into a very dark, emotional, saddened state. I can't help it. I don't think I'm not an Empath or anything, but I can strongly feel the emotions of others. I've never had anything like that happen in my family, and I pray to God that I never do, that no one ever does, but I feel emotionally connected to those families. It's been that way since I was very young. I want nothing more in this world that to bring them all back together. To see that, it means everything."

I disagree about the extra money for going. It's something that if a genuine homeless person, not abusing the system, goes into treatment/security, they come out with a fighting chance. 

Yes many people just go there so they can avoid all bills, and have a free place to sleep. Where I was at, I saw a few homeless people. 2 guys that got so fucked up in Vietnam, that they have lived there since the 60s.  bunch of drug abusers (who need help to), and like 8 people total (including myself) for PTSD (CPT treatment). 

I saw plenty of people that had been there 8 times or more, and I don't think thats ok. I think they should send them to another program, because it's obviously a lie, or isn't working.

Whatcouldgowrong,fehov6r,t3_ep47t7,1579120913.0,"From my experience, a lot of German Shepherds and other dogs that likely have a lot of discipline in their blood, do NOT like to be hugged to the point where you are on top of their head/face, and squeezing them. It definitely depends on the dogs bloodline, training, and upbringing (Ex. Trained to protect its owners/highly disciplined). It seems that dogs that are trained to be on high alert, don’t like to feel like they are being grabbed around the neck/head. 

I know if she randomly found my dog wondering the streets (would likely never ever happen), and she did this, he would bite her once, and leave her to think about what happened. It’s not that he’s aggressive, or abused, or poorly trained. It’s simply that he is the top dog, directly after a select few members of the immediate family. He has people to protect at all times, which means he doesn’t want to chance not being able to protect them, by feeling like he is being controlled, suffocated, or grabbed by an unknown person."
Veterans,feg19bh,t3_eoojdx,1579072616.0,"I just had 2 psychiatrists quit on me (quit the va) within 8 months. Its because they can’t handle the ridiculous shit that they don’t even remotely have the time to do in a workday, which is sad, because both of those doctors were really good to me, and I cared about them. It’s starting off a square one, every time you get a new doc. Same as in the civilian healthcare world. Only, with the va, our entire history is laid out before them in a simple system. They just don’t have the time to even read one single past note from another psychiatrist. I understand that, and don’t blame them one bit. 

Now they’re sending me outside the VA because there’s not a psychiatrist taking new patients. If I end up yelling at someone, it’s because they’re incompetent people that have no business doing the job they do, or they don’t give a shit, and/ are rude. I’m 99% if the time level headed.

You say “do something to fix it”. Do realize there are people that are literally incapable of caring for themselves? Brushing their teeth, taking a shower, eating, and even too fucking low to bother to take a piss until it’s absolutely necessary? People that don’t have the mental energy to write a resume, fill out applications, go to interviews, to better their lives. People that are so close to killing themselves, that actually bothering to seems like a chore. 

Yes, you will deal with people being irate, angry, callous, misunderstanding, and just plain dicks. But do you understand why that happens? PTSD makes most of its sufferers, ticking time bombs. It’s 0-100 in .2 seconds. You’re essentially working a customer service position with people that have been fucked over by that same company 20 times in 2 years. Those people also have no choice but to go back to that company, otherwise they end up unable to afford bills and basic needs, or they get sued into a lifetime of debt. 

I know some, maybe even most of the people are just plain assholes. But it may not be the majority. Idk what you do in the VA, but that could help me give you multiple scenarios where those people are past just being angry, by the time they speak to you. I know not all of them have mental health issues, or even significant health issues, but I’d bet a lot of them do. Those people have also likely been wronged more than a few times by the system. It’s still no excuse to yell at you, but maybe that’s them finally saying “enough” and going on a rampage until they get what they’ve been trying to get done for the past 6 months. 

Now, I’m sorry that you get yelled at. No one should have to put up with that, plus all the other bureaucratic VA bullshit. But think harder about what some of them are going through. PTSD isn’t an excuse to be an asshole, but it does sometimes make it almost impossible not to be. 

You see this stuff everyday. Everyday with all types of veterans. Are you writing congress to report the stuff you see with multiple people every single day? If so, great. Contact your local news station as well, if you have time. If not, then please do so. We know what needs to be done, it’s just that most of us have lost hope. You get screwed around enough times, and you start to feel like it’s intentional. Why aren’t the doctors and nurses reporting everything they see? They know damn near everything wrong with the system. They see it everyday, and they likely know what needs to be done to fix it. But yet, most don’t do anything about it. They’re word means 100x more to the people at the top, than a bunch of vets that those people on top don’t give a shit about.

I’m not against you. In fact, I appreciate you doing everything you can to deal with the people that are inpatient or yelling. I’m thankful that you do a mostly thankless job, and help out people in need. I’m not making excuses for anyone. I personally have only yelled at a few, truly incompetent, or just plain rude employees. I’m just saying that every case is different. I believe you are doing everything to be understanding. We all do appreciate the job you do, even the assholes do at some point. Just please don’t give up. A lot of people need to find themselves again, and work to change their lives. Just some don’t have the energy to do so anymore. The more understanding you are, the more it helps them. Don’t ever let yourself be run over. Remember you’re helping them, and you don’t owe that to anyone, except that you signed a contract to help in any way you can. That means something. Just keep doing what you’re doing. I think some of the things you said, connected wrong with some people. I get it. I hope you have many healthy days doing what you do. I hope you get more thanks than yells. Take care, and again, thank you for doing a job that a lot of people couldn’t do."

A lot of them don't seem to take their countries independence seriously. Don't seem to really care to hold down and fight the taliban. A lot of them are two faced, meaning one day they'll be ""fighting for their country"" along side US troops. Then the next day they will switch teams and either be reporting our movements to the enemy, or outright shooting at us with them. 

&#x200B;

I never really saw any drug use, except hashish (weed). Some of them take their job, their fight, their country, and it's people, very seriously. But most don't really seem to care. They'd rather talk about fucking little boys than pay attention to training, to learn to fight their own fight. 

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, some of them are badass soldiers, and love what they do. It's just the minority. Otherwise, I think the taliban would be having a rough time in the mountains of Afghanistan right now. Order and discipline bring about success. Success brings in others who want that success. Before you know it 10 men from multiple villages wear the uniform and fight. Then you start to see the taliban numbers in the area dwindle. 

&#x200B;

We have given the ANA the full support of Americas Military power (obviously not everything, but enough to make a massive difference), yet they don't seem to learn how to use it. Inaccurate coordinates on air/artillery/mortar strikes. Shooting like the taliban shoot (it's like grabbing a pistol and shooting behind your back into a safe area, and that's the accuracy/consistency the taliban have most of the time (DO NOT actually do this)). 

&#x200B;

It sucks, because we really did work hard to make the people of our AO safer and live better lives. We oversaw/secured the building of water wells, houses, solar lights, gave supplies/food/water, and even built a school for the young girls in the area. All that got destroyed when the ANA were taking over. That was after roughly 10 years of training/support/etc. They still had some troop support, as well as access to our air support and other things. 

&#x200B;

It's a shame all those things are gone now. Maybe they have been rebuilt, when we moved back into the area, idk. I can say that it truly hurts my heart thinking about those people. I can't even write things like this without crying, but it needs to be said. I want nothing more than for those little girls to be able to get an education and become the future of their country. Engineers, Doctors, Scientists, Politicians; they all have the ability to be those things, just like you and I. But they are being controlled by fear. By the murder of their fathers and brothers, and mothers. They deserve better than that. All people deserve better than that. 

&#x200B;

Their fellow countrymen are abandoning them for the easy way out. Most of them don't fight for their families or country. They fight because they get a paycheck. Then when the US asks them to take over their homeland, they flake. ""Ok I guess the taliban control is better than working hard for my people"". The US can't continue to stay there. We went about it in the worst way possible. We had the opportunity to help, but didn't really do what I think we should have. I'm not military expert. Nor am I a politician, so my voice doesn't matter. I'm just the guy on the ground that saw and heard things that weren't ok.

The VA doesn’t even fucking know I went there, and that was only 9 months ago. The doctors/psychiatrists don’t even have enough time to take a shit in the middle of the day. Let alone enough time to read our history, or even think about the multitude of programs available. 

It sucks, but that’s why we have to keep telling people about it ourselves. We are probably the biggest motivators to other vets. Because “if this other vet did it, it must not be so bad, and I can do it to”."

Edit: 

It's a good thing to do if you're at or near the stage where you or your doctor feels it's necessary. 

I did 45 days (it was a 30 day program, but I stayed longer) at the Milwaukee VA Domiciliary 123, for PTSD treatment. 

If you go there, or find a good one, it keeps you busy. You're basically on a set schedule every weekday. Wake up at 8 and eat breakfast. Go to group classes, then lunch. More classes, and your day is done after dinner (you don't have to take classes all day, but some are mandatory, and they ask that you do at least 5 hours of class a day). Also, if you're not feeling up for class that day, you can talk to them, but the classes are why you're there.

I personally benefitted the most by talking to the other Vets there. Helping them through their struggles, and talking about mine. I stayed busy helping people with their disability claims, and doing tech support for anyone that needed it. 

At first I didn't speak to anyone, except in class. It took me 2 weeks to finally talk to people. When I did, many of them said they knew what was going on, but wanted to give me time. Then, someone spoke to me and got me out of the dark. Introduced me to people, so that I was forced to be somewhat social.

By the end of it, I had no choice but to befriend almost everyone there. Everyone knew my name, and they all seemed to genuinely like me, and care about me. Something that I didn't expect. I couldn't go anywhere without saying ""hi"" to about 20 people. It made me feel happiness again. 

I also had a very close group of friends there that I spent every breakfast/lunch/dinner, with. We talked to each other about everything. Not just the bad stuff. I made best friends there. 

These are the things that helped me to heal and feel better about myself. But I made the mistake of not continuing that outside of the program. Because it's still hard for me. 

I grew there. I wasn't healed, but I made something important- progress. 


So if you're on the fence, do a little research about the programs around you. Ask your therapist or psychiatrist to research the best places near where you are. The VA paid for me to travel where I was going. I believe they will do that, even if it's far away. At least I hope they would.

It's worth it. I gained a lot of tools to cope. It may be scary at first. The place may be an older building like where I went, and look like an outdated nuthouse. But that's because the government isn't putting enough into these programs. But none of that matters. What does matter is what you take away from the experience. 


If you have any questions, PM me. Otherwise, I wish you the best in everything you do. Remember that there are a lot of people you don't even know that care about you. If you go, you'll meet many of them. That will give you self worth back, if it's something you lost. 

Thank you for seeking further help. All the best to you and yours."

You’d be surprised with what people can get away with by saying shit like “it’s my daughter, and she’s on drugs”, or something like that. It’s like the bystander effect. Someone has a heart attack, and everyone just stands around watching, because that’s the reaction of the person that saw the action before them did. 

Or like another comment or said, the station may be empty at night (it looked empty), and maybe he was going to do it right there. I think you’d be amazed with what people have gotten away with in broad daylight, and in sight of multiple bystanders (I’m sure you’re aware of this anyway)."

What’s your diet like? Are you eating green food? Are you doing any working out (even just walking around the block twice makes a difference). Diet is key. 2 cups of coffee a day isn’t bad. 4 energy drinks is terrible. You’re likely reliant on caffeine/sugars, on top of having CFS.

If you have a healthy diet, then I’d say workout. If you do both, I’d say there’s definitely something going on there. But I can say 100% that energy drinks are are hurting the situation, not helping. Although I can absolutely understand your reasoning for drinking them."
