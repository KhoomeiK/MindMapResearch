NSFWIAMA,feo0m3g,t1_fehv27o,1579293543.0,He probably wasn't hard if he was drunk at a party with his pants down. What is the smallest hard cock you've seen?

todayilearned,fen6f50,t1_femrvmw,1579277994.0,He is history and he hasn't been vindicated.
todayilearned,fen4ldf,t1_femzv0d,1579276840.0,Correct.
IdiotsInCars,fen2kry,t1_femyb1e,1579275566.0,Yes it's obviously ok to break traffic laws when it's safe. Go stand by a stop sign in the middle of no where and see how many people come to a complete stop with no other cars around. Go on the freeway and set your cruise control to 65 and see how many people pass you.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdy6ter,t1_fdxkc4d,1578776685.0,Of course there are no recent examples because it's not something that is feasible in the modern world.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdy6n0y,t1_fdy3qjg,1578776617.0,"What the fuck are you even talking about? Half of those countries are not well armed and you seem to be talking about world war 2 as ""recent"" LMFAO yes you should go on, I love a good laugh."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdxkpnc,t1_fduizbr,1578769830.0,"You want me to explain the science behind it? Do you also want to understand the science behind children turning into adults? Or do you just understand that it happens and when someone is a child you can't fuck them but when they are an adult you can? What about the science behind getting drunk and driving? Or do you understand that a sober person can drive fine but a drunk person cannot. If you do need that amount of science in your explanation then it's out there, but you're going to have to talk to an expert about it. 

Most people don't have to understand the science behind it to understand that many things happen on a gradient and the government has to draw a line somewhere rather than trying to debate the exact moment a sober person turns drunk, a teenager begins to understand how to consent to sex, or when a fetus becomes a child. 

You may argue that the line is drawn too early or too late legally speaking, but you cannot argue that the line does not exist."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdxk6q9,t1_fdwvptd,1578769537.0,Sorry but you are too fucking stupid to understand what the government is there for. Buh bye now.

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdxis2h,t1_fduezvl,1578769118.0,"No, not ever. Recently, you dumb fuck. Having trouble following the conversation?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fduefmg,t1_fdud9q5,1578731872.0,No there haven't but thanks for proving you aren't educated enough to know anything about it.
