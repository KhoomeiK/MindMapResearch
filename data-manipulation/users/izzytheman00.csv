medicase,fcmrj7q,t3_ehwu3x,1577788693.0,"Snakebite envenoming is a potentially life-threatening disease that results from the injection of a mixture of different toxins (“venom”) following the bite of a venomous snake or having venom sprayed into the eyes by certain species of snakes

Although there are currently more than 3000 species of snakes in the world, approximately 10% of these are listed by WHO as being of medical importance because of the harm their venoms can do.

Medically important venomous snakes can be found in 160 countries worldwide, and snakebite envenoming is a particularly important public health problem in rural areas of tropical and sub-tropical countries situated in Africa, the Middle-East, Asia, Oceania and Latin America, not so much in Europe.Around 2.7 million venomous snake bite occur annually.

Rural cropping and livestock workers, hunters and fishermen are among the most affected. Children often suffer more severe effects than adults because of their smaller body mass. Lack of footwear contributes significantly to the risk of snakebite for both adults and children. Morbidity and mortality is most common between the ages of 10-30.

Snake venom is a highly modified saliva. Venoms contain a complex mixture of proteins, enzymes, and various other substances with toxic and lethal properties that either serves to immobilize prey or induce necrosis and blood coagulation. 
Snake antivenoms are effective treatments to prevent or reverse most of the harmful effects of snakebite envenoming. Unfortunately many people either lack access to antivenom, or cannot afford to pay for them. Many families sell possessions or go into debt in order to obtain antivenom after someone is bitten. Difficulties in ensuring proper regulation and testing of antivenoms also affect the availability of good quality, effective products."
