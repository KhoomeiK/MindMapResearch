This isn't true. You're not a Republican because you decide to run as one, you're a Republican because the RNC puts you on their ticket. If they've kept him onboard, it's for no other reason than they think they're better with him than without. They can dump him any election cycle without repercussion and there's nothing he could do about it.

This is just an insane statement that is refuted by both empirical evidence and common sense. See following comment. 

> Every system is essentially a two-party system, government and opposition

No. In so many ways no. Lots of countries have governments with representation from a wide variety of parties. The US isn't unique in our two-party system, per se, but we are at the apex of the intersection of ""polarized vs size"". 

But there's literally no reason it has to be that way except that we run a first-past-the-post system which entrenches power back into the two parties because it stifles third party representation. 

> Look at how frustrated Pelosi is with AOC

You're confusing a couple concepts here. Pelosi is the speaker, not the chairperson of the DNC. She doesn't get to decide who runs. 

The chairperson's job is (ostensibly*) to pick the most electable slate, and coordinate the efforts of those who try to get them elected. The Speaker (and other political leaders) job is to organize their actual legislative efforts. 

But these are unrelated and non-overlapping jobs.

*I say ostensibly because Debbie Wasserman Schultz was a very recent, memorable, and public exposure of the way the Chairperson may not actually be doing their job in good faith. Note that this is even more reason why you don't want people you don't know and didn't elect picking your candidates for you, which is a problem made more prevalent by the current two party system."

I'm sorry to say, but you could not possibly have this more backwards. The current system gives the two major parties vastly more power than they would have under a proportional representation system. With proportional representation, not only would third party candidates be viable, but nomination in the major parties would be much more competitive, instead of just being decided on your behalf by people you don't know and didn't elect.

There literally is no system that's still technically democratic that gives the parties more power than the current one."

Variety and convenience, mostly. You already said convenience, but you kinda poo-poo'd it, which I think is a bit unfair. I work a ton. If I get home at 8, I really don't feel like cooking. I can make something frozen, but it's not clear that's even healthier than ordering. 

So convenience is a not insignificant factor. 

The other is variety. There's a lot of things that it's simply not possible, or in some cases not worth cooking yourself. 

Don't get me wrong. I like cooking. I cook a lot. I consider myself a food person and have a personal rule to cook at least 1 new recipe a week for no other reason than to continue to develop both my palette and my repertoire (and usually do 2-3 regardless). 

But all that aside, there's *still* a good reason to eat out or order even if you don't have to for some people. 

You obviously don't *have* to do that. But you don't *have* to not do that, either. 

Basically, different people have different lives, and different decisions work well for them.

And finally, the original comment was in regards to maintaining weight, not any of the other factors you mentioned. You can move the goal posts and say ""there's lots of reasons to cook"" if you want, but the whole reason we're having this exchange is because you said maintaining your weight is the reason to not eat out, which seems really reductive."
todayilearned,ffs5cls,t1_ffrnava,1580173532.0,"this feels like such a overly simplistic conclusion. I eat out all the time and still maintain my goal weight. Portion control is part of it, making good ordering decisions is another, not snacking is another, and exercising is yet another. But ""don't eat out if you don't want to be overweight"" doesn't seem like helpful or useful advice."
