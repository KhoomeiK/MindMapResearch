dogs,ffxkaq8,t3_evqnva,1580326865.0,"I'm not a huge fan of having to stop so someone can pet her TBH. Or, even worse, being called over so a bunch of drunken sorority girls can pet her (I took a pass.) But if we're just sitting or standing there I'm happy to do it. Just a few days ago a little 5 or 6 year old girl and her older brother asked and I said it would be great if they pet her."

Pitbull,ffx23tq,t3_evp5h5,1580316106.0,"Can we also add STOP INFANTILIZING YOUR DOG! I get your pibble in jammies is cute but being so cavalier with pet dogs is a terrible idea. My girl is my ""baby"" but shes also 60 lbs of muscle so I need to be in control of her and remember she is an animal not an actual baby. I confess I'm not a huge fan of what I call ""pibble culture"" as much as I like the pitbull breeds."

Please stop pretending like it's all about the victims.

dogs,ffwupbm,t3_evncwa,1580311441.0,"I was on a hike in an off-leash approved trail system where we live. On the way back to the truck my dog always does this final zombies things where she races about 100 yards and does a super fast final loop before getting in the truck. I called her with a firm, loud, ""come!"" and she came running up to get her leash on. I heard this woman say to her friend, ""Oh my God that's so MEAN! Why is he yelling at her?"" I shrugged it off but that's what my dog responds to in that setting. Firm, solid direction. I wish people realized there is a difference between yelling at your dog and giving firm commands. That setting is different from home where commands are a little ""gentler"" because she's so close and there are fewer distractions. I'm not a small man and have a deep voice so it might have come off that way but still."
unpopularopinion,ffwtulb,t1_ffwj731,1580310865.0,"This. And this isn't victims blaming like some people might think. It's common sense. OP makes an excellent point about pics of babies and big dogs and, ""Look how gentle she is with my toddler!"" It teaches young kids that climbing all over dogs is ok when it isn't. Then the dog gets out down when it was set up for failure from the beginning."

AskReddit,fftlmd1,t1_fftknb0,1580223701.0,The weather was one thing I  loved about living there. It's in this almost banana belt weather pattern so it gets less snow and rain than the rest of Oregon. But I like hot weather so there's that.
AskReddit,fftlfob,t1_fftl7nw,1580223569.0,That's where we lived in 2005-2006. We didn't love it but it must have kept growing since then. The downtown was small and kind of depressing. The people were not very friendly overall. But I appreciated being able to drive 20-30 minutes from our house and be out in the middle of nowhere bird hunting with my dog. There was good and bad in that area. I mean moving back wouldn't be the worstthi g ever but it wouldn't be my first choice.
