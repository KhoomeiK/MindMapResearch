politics,fehb2yn,t1_fehahom,1579112890.0,"There have been candidates in the past who polled lower than what yang is polling at in the same time period that went on to win the primaries.  It’s disingenuous to maintain the polling requirements at a level that would be nearly impossible to reach with no polls.  And the qualifying polling institutions had said that there would be no new polls until after the holidays. This was something that was known since mid to early December.  On top of that, Yang was the only one on the debate stage in December that didn’t qualify for the January debate at the time of them announcing the requirements. Even if it wasn’t intentional, it’s still absolutely ridiculous for them to essentially say “alright, all of you have made it except Yang, and Yang you need to get 5% 4 more times”.   No matter how you look at it, it’s a shitty move by the dnc"
politics,feha3bm,t1_fegoqfw,1579112299.0,There have been candidates in the past that were polling at the same percentages (or lower) as Andrew Yang during the same time period that went on to win the primaries. The polling at this early in the election isn’t a sign that he can’t win.

PsilocybinMushrooms,fdukqsv,t1_fdtskvw,1578734442.0,"First trip was about 1.5 grams. I didn’t have a scale then, so I just kinda winged it. After that, I kinda forget which trip was which in the middle, but I do remember the second to last and the final trips.  The second to last trip was a 5 gram trip and it is probably the one that healed me the most(tied with the first trip tho cuz I went from suicidal depressed, to happy to be alive overnite.  The 5 gram trips affects have lasted longer tho).  

The final trip was 2 grams and it actually started out feeling like it was gonna be a bad trip.  I remember thinking to myself “Why are you even tripping right now? You were supposed to be using shrooms because you wanted to treat your depression, but you weren’t feeling depressed at all today” and I started to feel like I was using shrooms as a feel good drug as opposed to a medicine that I respect and love. But then I tried to change my perspective on it and I turned it into a positive trip. I realized that being able to acknowledge that means that 1. I still love and respect the mushrooms, and 2. It told me that my shroom “treatment” is done.  And that made me very happy.  Every trip I had, I finished it by gathering what I took out of that trip, and what the final trip helped me realize was that my depression that I’ve had for so long is finally gone.  It was a check up/celebration trip like going to the orthodontist after you’ve gotten your braces taken off only to have them tell you that it looks good and that everything went right.  And I know I may feel that depressed feeling time and again, and that life may seem hopeless, but now I know that it’ll be alright and that I **definitely** can get through this.  
And hey, if I need to, I’ll always know where to get shrooms if I need to get my mind back on track again, so I’m not too worried about my depression anymore  ;)"
PsilocybinMushrooms,fdssx9w,t1_fdsebos,1578707527.0,"By eating them ;) 


But really tho, I just had read the studies about them being used to treat depression, so I asked my coworkers if they knew anybody that sold them and one of them hit me up.  Then I decided to sit down and eat them with a goal in mind: address my depression.  I ate the shrooms and for the next couple of hours I sat in my bed and thought about what was making me depressed, why I was being affected by those things, and what I could do to fix them.  It took me about 5 trips total to get to the point where I felt like I could never use shrooms again and I’d still be perfectly happy with my life."

So I’m a 20 year old full time student living in the Silicon Valley.  I currently work “part time”( lately it’s been full time hours) for $16.50/hour at a mall only 15 minutes from my house. I’ve heard the argument that a federal jobs guarantee would give me the liberty to leave my job at any time because I’d be able to find a better job at any given moment (the FJG). 

My question is what kind of job would I be working in the center of the Silicon Valley? And how far away from my house would I be expected to drive? I think a federal jobs guarantee is a good idea, but I do have a hard time picturing how it would be able to be applied to my life at the moment."
