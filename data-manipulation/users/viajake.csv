Honestly, I say do it. I got called for jury duty and had to sit in a room for 20 minutes. All the trials that I was supposed to sit on settled before going to the judge. If it does go to trial, you’ll be doing your civic duty. I was the youngest person in the pool by far so the system needs more people our age to balance things out.

And it's not the military spending itself, it's the id of a nation that views unlimited funding and support for one nationalized government agency while the prospect of nationalizing anything else is completely batshit.

You know why the US spends more than any other nation on medical care? Because in this country, medical care is a business. Insurance companies charge $15 for a single Tylenol pill. A box of gloves costs $53. My insurance costs $700 per month and I'm lucky that my employer covers most of that. Even at $700 per month, my deductible is still $3000. Cuba spends significantly less than us and yet they still have one of the best medical systems in the world, including on the research front.

Edit: hypocrites criticize China for Xinjiang but you can’t even get your own house in order with concentration camps full of migrant children. The government won’t even let doctors inside to give them flu vaccines even while they’re dying.

You criticize China for police brutality in Hong Kong but how many protestors have been killed by the police there? Innocent people get killed by police every day in the United States and we’ve accepted it as standard. We post something on Facebook (if that) and call it a day. 

The US has the largest prison population in the world, has the 7th highest number of executions, regularly keeps people in solitary confinement, and uses prisoners for slave labor regularly (the 13th amendment). Innocent people go to jail all the time for imaginary crimes like “resisting arrest”.  A police officer can try to arrest you for doing nothing, you could resist the illegal arrest, and suddenly POOF you’re a criminal. In many states, the police can also use “civil asset forfeiture” on your money, cars, and even homes if they “suspect” it was involved in a crime.
