educationalgifs,fgousdx,t1_fgoumd3,1580987578.0,"Things vibrate when you force them to. They vibrate differently when you hit them once every second and 50 times a second. If you hit a sweet spot with how fast you're hitting it will vibrate in a pure form (just one type of vibration). In the gif they hit the droplet with sound waves with different ""speeds"" hitting those sweet spots."

educationalgifs,fgolffs,t1_fgoaobc,1580974613.0,"It's a bit easier to explain with a guitar string of a set finite length. If you pluck it you will hear some sound which is it's fundamental (lowest frequency) and other frequencies higher than that (harmonics). It is so, because any vibration is a superposition (think sum) of all the modal shapes. Every modal shape is linked with a specific frequency (harmonic). For a string those shapes split the string into even parts, so for the first you have the whole string going up and down. For the second, you have one node in the middle (no vibrations in this point) and 2 segments going up and down. So on and so forth.  For the water droplet it is the same but instead of a one dimensional string you have two dimensional (just area) droplet. Now if you were to pull the string at exactly the middle you would be able to force it to play just the 1st harmonic. In this gif, they play the harmonics of the droplet, which are it's modal frequencies, and they force the droplet to vibrate according to only the modal shapes associated with harmonics."

patientgamers,fedoils,t3_eofuot,1579016453.0,"I see someone already recommended Divinity: Original Sin which I would recommend as well, it's just awesome, though I'd recommend playing in order or only the second one, story is 1000 years apart so it doesn't matter much, but game systems are much better in 2.

Though if you do not care when the game came out maybe try Baldur's Gate, it's cheap, because it's over 20 years old, and it's a literal classic RPG. Small bonus, Larian Studios (makers of Divinity: Original Sin) are making Baldur's Gate 3 which is set out to come out this year."

As for the Talion I don't really think that he's uglier, at least new armour changes his appeareance a bit, but truth be told first thing I did was change his skin to possessed Eltariel, though I still got to look at him in some questlines"

I wish there was a way to skip introductions or just an option to turn them off, as after a while those were getting frustrating, especially when you encountered more than one captain, which made you sit for well over 2 minutes just listening to orcs talk.

I didn't mind the amount of orcs, as a wide variety of AoE skills made it easy to get rid of them. Problem is no matter how many of them were there the fights never got any tougher, because you had a big blue indicator of when to press parry for an instakill."

But the Pits are atrocious, I'd rather someone take inspiration from the Nemesis system and incorporate it into a better game. Sure it has to be open world, but give it interesting enough story and actually good gameplay and it would be a hit."

interestingasfuck,fduij0e,t1_fdsko4t,1578733561.0,"That is nice, but shouldn't they use volume? For a toroid like doughnut it's volume is given by:

Vt = (2*pi*R)*(pi*r^2), 

where r is a radius of a cross section of a doughnut and R is a radius measured from the centre of the doughnut to the centre of a cross section. Parentheses are only for recognising that one is area of a circle and the other is circumference inner and outer radius of the hole doughnut are:

Rinner  = R-r

Router = R+r

Let's assume, like they did, that the hole is small:

 Rinner = 1/4 Router, that gives: 

R-r = 1/4*R + 1/4*r

r = 3/5*R

Plugging into volume we get:

Vt = 2*pi^2*R*9/25*R^2 = 18/25*pi^2*R^3

Plugging pi = 3.14

Vt = 177.47/25*R^3

For a square doughnut of the same height = 2*r with a square hole as in picture, and inner and outer ""diameters the same as in toroid we get:

Vs = ((2*Router)^2-(2*Rinner)^2)*2*r

Vs = ((2*(R+r))^2-(2*(R-r))^2)*2*r

Vs = ((2*8/5*R)^2-(2*2/5*R)^2)*2*3/5*R

Vs = (256/25*R^2-16/25*R^2)*6/5*R

Vs = 240/25*R^2*6/5*R = 288/25*R^3

Now to compare:

Vt/Vs = (177.47/25*R^3)/(288/25*R^3) = 177.47/288 = 61.62% 

So normal doughnut is just over 60% of a square doughnut."
The10thDentist,fcivbx9,t3_eh4i78,1577670691.0,"Ep 1 was ok, but nothing special. 2 and 3 were the worst episodes in the history of the show, especially episode 3. Having to listen to the same joke like 5 times was painful. 4 was better but dragon sluts got old fast (not as fast as ""I'm in""). 5 was great but it doesn't save the season."
