WatchRedditDie,ff7bdfn,t1_ff78cr3,1579645445.0,"People who ""support"" a religion seem to choose only some parts of that religion to adhere to.  If you choose to compare religions by their ""worst"" practitioners, you'd soon find that all religions are despicable.  To support Christianity you'd implicitly endorse the execution of gays in Uganda. To support Buddhism you'd be OK with the genocide in Rohingya.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to compare religions this way. 

You noticed that the cultures of the ancient times are much less fair than what we consider normal today, but some people still think that these books hold the highest level of morality."
