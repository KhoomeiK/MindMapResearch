insaneparents,fffzm1d,t1_fffoag8,1579895264.0,"It's obviously even more awful given that your sister isn't even doing anything wrong. But it's terrible parenting even when there *is* something going wrong. Like, how do we solve the problem of an ""out-of-control"" child? I know: let's strip them of all their possessions and autonomy and make them feel even more insecure and upset! Surely that will work!"

AmItheAsshole,ffc4ut2,t1_ffbyd7n,1579791566.0,"> You're stripping all the joy and pleasure out of what should be a day of celebration.  

Exactly. The point of a wedding is not the color scheme. It's creating a time and space to joyfully celebrate a major life transition with family and friends. The success of your wedding will depend entirely on your ability to understand this.

To paraphrase Maya Angelou, ""People will forget what you said, people will forget your wedding's color scheme, but people will never forget how you made them feel.""

OP, think hard about your priorities."
AmItheAsshole,ff82k57,t1_ff7y4zi,1579664309.0,"Your whole post is excellent but I especially want to highlight this:

>If you keep in mind that he is not just ""a child"", but a fully formed human being with his own thoughts, feelings, desires, and reactions you will do just fine.

This is at the core of good parenting. Get this right, and you’re well on the road to doing a good job raising your kids."
WTF,ff69ma9,t1_ff5yr0v,1579622352.0,"I think that happens to a lot of subs, especially the ones with very specific subjects. The initial content is great, the sub gains subscribers, people start generating inside jokes and memes which start to crowd out the actual substantive content (in part because there just isn't enough substantive content --how many gifs are there really of tires fucking shit up?). Some subs that seem like they should be pretty fun, if you sort them by top all-time, you get a bunch of third-generation memes and inside jokes and almost nothing of what the sub is supposed to be about. Cycle of life, I guess."
MapPorn,ff67cdf,t1_ff657em,1579620863.0,Maybe both? Might be an official motto vs a tourism slogan. I defer to actual Virginians. Quite a range of attitudes between the two slogans anyway!

CityPorn,ff554rg,t1_ff4i6xz,1579580507.0,"It’s a great park, though sometimes quite crowded. The cool thing is that it was designed to replicate the naturally overgrown condition it was in when the city reclaimed it after years of abandonment — the grasses and trees that had seeded themselves there over time. It’s an attempt to capture how nature reasserts itself even in an urban environment.

I remember the design competition they held when the line was first acquired for park use. There were proposals including water slides, roller coasters, all kinds of crazy uses. The design that won was the one that just replicated its “natural” state. Of course, it’s artificial in that it was all stripped and replanted, but the concept is the key. And some parts are now being allowed to become wild again.

I adore the high line. It’s not the only park of its kind in the world (the Promenade Plantee in Paris, for instance, preceded it), but I think it’s the most successful of its kind."

dataisugly,fdrnhz6,t1_fdrkzr7,1578686997.0,"Yeah, that's a good point. Could actually do 2 versions: one colored by country, and one by sector.

What I'd love is an interactive graphic that shows the effect on climate models of possible emissions reductions by sector/country/etc. Like the NFL playoff machine but for climate. What's the effect on climate models if we reduce transportation emissions by 50% in the US (or, say, switch all US cars to electric vehicles)? Or reduce coal burning by 90% globally? Etc. 

That's probably way too complex to build given the complexity of the data, but I feel like for an issue like climate change, it would be great to present data in a way that gives people a sense of how choices and changes can impact the future. It's otherwise all very hard for people to wrap their heads around, which contributes to a feeling of disempowerment or fatalism about it."
dataisugly,fdri32i,t3_emvoap,1578684805.0,"I actually kind of like this. It's impressionistic, but it communicates the biggest chunks clearly and shows how the other sources sort of blend into comparative irrelevance. More like info-art than clear data presentation, for sure, but it illustrates (what I take to be) the key point and looks kinda cool."

nfl,fde85o6,t1_fdcpys0,1578333284.0,"He's the receiver the Hawks have been looking for since Sidney Rice retired. He's the kind of guy they were briefly trying to simulate with Chris Matthews. Imagine having DK during XLIX (though I guess Matthews was doing a decent DK impression during that game).

He's the fast, big-body, big-play downfield receiver built to complete the run-first/playaction Pete Carroll offense. His three-cone drill was always an irrelevant stat for the Seahawks, who wanted him for a specific role. So far he's been very good at that role."
worldbuilding,fcuhls9,t1_fcuh18e,1577981153.0,"That idea of tiered growth/construction makes a lot of sense!

In our world, lower-class districts have typically developed in downwind (often East, at least in North America) areas, or bottomlands--places where the waste products of industry and the wealthy tended to accumulate. I suppose that on the Strand, the slums would be in the shadows. Working-class movements, if they exist, would identify as shadow-people."
worldbuilding,fcugjka,t1_fcud346,1577980430.0,"This is some really awesome work. Thanks for sharing it.

Interesting to think about the fact that the sun would always be roughly in the same spot. Given that most life is in the twilight zone, that means that there are long shadows that also stay more or less in the same place. I suppose you would see deep biological variation throughout the landscape of the twilight zone, then, with some plants and animals adapted to sunlight, and some adapted to darkness, all living side-by-side. 

It would also mean there were significant cultural/political implications to any construction. Where I live, there's a major controversy over a building development that would throw part of our botanical garden into shade for part of each day. Imagine a world in which every single new building would cast part of its neighboring landscape into permanent shadow. Not only would it be a local planning nightmare, I could even see construction becoming almost a question of religion. There might almost be a ritual element to it."
