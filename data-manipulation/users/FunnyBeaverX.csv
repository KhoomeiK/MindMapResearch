Yeah, that's the Pit and the prey drive going. One of them has to go. You can't 'fix' this. The fact that there is a shock collar involved at all just tells me that this is not a dog you introduce 'small game' to. Eventually the dog is going to kill the cat it happens ALL the time with ALL sorts of high prey drive or working breeds (I'd love to get a buddy for my collie, equal sized pack-mate, sure but nothing smaller than him or different species) and you get to get all the warning signs that all the other people in your situation never got before they had tragic accidents and you get to make the whole Sophies Choice thing now. If it was me, I'd get rid of the chick who has an untrained shock collar wearing 4 year old Pit but that's me."
