Even true HEPA is 99.97% efficient at .3 microns particle size-- I have two for lead and mold remediation work. And that's the air that actually makes it into the nozzle. No Miele vacuum beater, or carpet scrubber, or pressure washer, will ever get every particle of dead skin, lead, spores, out of carpet without completely turning it into shreds. Think about hiding a fingernail clipping in the center of dreadlock... would shampooing or vacuuming get it out?. It's about reducing the particle number to a safe, acceptable level. Even clean rooms have an ecosystem if humans are involved at all. Bacteria and mites will munch on most of the biologicals in a home, so things do cycle to a degree.
