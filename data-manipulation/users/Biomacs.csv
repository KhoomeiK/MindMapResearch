The one I used, and it's considered a very good book is ""Robot Modeling and Control"" by Mark Spong.

The list can be big as the topic belongs to the basics. It can constitute a great effort from many authors, such as:

Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control, by Bruno Siciliano.

Robotics, Vision and Control: Fundamental Algorithms in MATLAB, by Peter Corke

Introduction to Robotics: Analysis, Control, Applications, by Saeed Niku

Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control, by John Craig
