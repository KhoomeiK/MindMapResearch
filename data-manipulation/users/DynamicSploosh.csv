“More than just a pet”

He swept into my life one day  
A boy of just eleven  
For me, the biggest dream come true  
A little piece of heaven  


A tiny puppy, black and white  
Sleeping as we met  
Happy birthday says my mum  
As his head I reach to pet  


From that moment, friends for life  
A boy and dog connected  
They grew together year by year  
Their bond always protected  


A dog of fun to everyone  
No smile he couldn’t bring  
Incessant barking and excitement  
To every doorbell ring  


The great Houdini was his name  
To local canine rangers  
He simply could not stop him self  
Escaping to meet strangers  


He guarded home and loved us all  
A member of the family  
My loving friend through the thick and thin  
A life lived long and happily  


When time it came to say goodbye  
No words prepared me for it  
A broken man beside his friend  
A piece of my soul forfeit  


No time gone by can mend the hole  
A magic soul I met  
A life that brought us joy and love  
More than just a pet"

I can only get on the water because I have the technology to float and sail. But if I want to fish and draw maps, I first need the ability to sail. The boat is the firmware. It allows me to navigate a vast ocean. But when I have a boat, I can fish, plot maps, transport passengers and so on. Firmware is a operating platform. Software is what you can do with that platform."
