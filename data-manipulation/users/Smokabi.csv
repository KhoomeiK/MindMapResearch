HomeworkHelp,ffc01l3,t3_esthh3,1579788035.0,"I approached this three different ways:

1. Sometimes the simplest answer is THE answer. Since P(x≤3hrs), I just added up .054+.096+.166 to get the answer .316.


2. As you see in the photo, I used the TI equation binomialcdf(n, p, x) where n is 1000, p is .316, and x is 316 to get .515.


Is it appropriate that x (aka ""a"") is 316 and not 3 for ""3 hours of sleep""? It makes more sense to me that x would be 316 people out of 1000 people and not 3 hours since the hours have nothing to do with anything and they might as well be colors or something. Right?


3. My friend did it a completely different way by calculating ""binomialcdf(1000, .166, 3) to get 1.95"". I don't think this is correct... but once again, sometimes the simplest answer ends up being the correct one so idk!!!


It's to be noted that I briefly asked my professor about this question, but I don't know if we were on the same page so to speak when I asked because I had originally written ""1-(.245+.175+.135+.085+.044)"" which is basically my first solution described in this comment lol but he told me the answer would be the other way around (""1-.054+.096+.166"" which would be .684). This makes no sense to me because wouldn't that be the probability of x is GREATER THAN or equal to 3 hours of sleep? I think he meant something else. Or am I wrong...

YouShouldKnow,fd1o548,t3_ejq9oy,1578134133.0,"Yep. Something similar happened to me. Funny story, I posted it earlier this week about how I realized I should just call THEM first just to be safe. I'll just C&P:

To preface, I like to roleplay—not DnD but straight up back and forth prose, and one of my characters is a con artist. I put a lot of research into that character, utilizing tricks from Catch Me If You Can, Matchstick Men, and The Wolf of Wall Street.

One day, my grandma (whom I live with) gets a call from someone stating that there had been a charge to her Verizon account for 2 iPhone Xs (worth $2k) made from another state. The guy was supposedly helping us to undo it since we didn't make the purchase, but as soon as he started saying that he was going to send us a code to her phone and that he needed me to give it to him, I began to think, ""Huh. This kind of reminds me of one of the cons I had written for my character."" As the call went on, I began to fantasize about how my character could easily just call someone asking for them to repeat the code back to him like this in order for him to gain access to their account since, sometimes, a website will ask you to verify a code they send to your phone so you can login, whether because you're on a new computer, forgot your password, or have two-step verification turned on. That's when my paranoia kicked in. *What if this guy is doing the same thing to me?*

I told the guy my thoughts and said that I would feel safer if I just called back the Verizon number directly and started all over, just to be sure I was talking to Verizon. He tried to get me to stay on the line, not desperately but in a convincing manner.

Lo and behold, the people at Verizon's fraud department told us that they would never ask for a code and a guy by that name did not work in their department. Ass saved thanks to my fictional anime character lol.

Just for context, here's the segment that I had written for my character that got those suspicions flowing:

>*""Hello, may I please speak to a Mrs. Miranda Schultz? Hi, Mrs. Schultz, this is John Goodman from Halifax LLC. I'm calling in regards to your most recent withdrawal of $1,377.00 to your checking account. Company policy mandates that I inquire as to whether you authorized this transaction on Februa—What? It was unauthorized? I'm sorry to hear that, Mrs. Schultz. We'll cease further debiting immediately. Please hold.*

>*""Hello, Mrs. Schultz? Yes, thanks for holding. I was able to temporarily freeze your account until further notice. While you will need to come in and provide proper documentation, would you like me to start filing a formal complaint in your name with the Attorney General? Absolutely, ma'am, I'd be glad to help. If I could just get you to verify your Social Security number and the 28-digit number at the bottom of a Halifax personal check, I can get started on your case file immediately...""*

ApplyingToCollege,fd11448,t1_fd0vr2n,1578126489.0,"I appreciate how considerate you are.

To me, it shows a particular spitefulness to others (*""I* had to pay off my debts, so everyone else should too."") when it doesn't affect you whatsoever; whether someone goes a third of their life paying off their debts has no bearing on yours. What's done is done. We should want to see that benefit for others and future generations. The opposite just seems needlessly inconsiderate.

I developed this take after seeing some Boomers on Twitter saying ""I was paying off loans for (X amount of years). I don't wish the same on others."" Here's one, for instance: https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/first-person/2019/5/2/18527036/sanders-bernie-millennials-cancel-student-debt-forgiveness?fbclid=IwAR2N81IkUM1allh8uFuPjBM6QDWrxDys3PSOPVb8xlqSFvb8mLmPdp0Fjic&__twitter_impression=true

What's funny is something similar happened this last semester. My English prof, when telling us about his curriculum for the next semester (if we wanted to recommend the class to a friend), said, ""You're going to hate me, but next semester, there won't be as many essay assignments."" Sure, we were like ""Haaaa..."" because of how stressful the term had been, but my thinking was that there was no use crying over spilt milk. I'm happy future students of his class won't be drowning in essays like we were (or rather, I wasn't really thinking about it, but yay for them)."

Advice,fcuncqa,t1_fcs01mm,1577984681.0,"Good luck out there! I feel obliged to warn you again about the account freezing thing though. It just happens out of nowhere for many people and there's no way to get it back.

After having this conversation with you, it inspired me to download an app for making friends (MeetMe), but I can't say I take too kindly to the app alerting others when you've looked at their profile LOL. Not sure why that bothers me, but yeah, there's that app too."

This sounds incredibly bad out of context."
Advice,fcrhsbv,t1_fcreedr,1577901992.0,"Hoo boy I'm a hermit too (Full disclosure, my relationship is online as my social life is primarily located there anyway.)   I admire that you don't let your asexuality keep you from getting out there though. Major props! I think it's still possible to hit it off with someone new, but I'd wager most people on these apps are looking to fuck. Not to dissuade you though because last I remember being on okcupid, there were a ton of people looking for friendships, too. I remember having a fun conversation with one guy before my account randomly froze, which I guess happens a lot on OKC. Still worth a shot, I think! Or anything that'll get you to interact with people who have similar interests as you. At this point, any advice for just making friends in general applies (not to sound like someone who misconstrues asexual relationships as no different from friendships lol)."

Advice,fcrbn5u,t3_eihmm3,1577899622.0,"Hey, I'm just like you! I had never dated anyone up until two years ago when I was 21. I'm ace and have turned down many an opportunity because I knew I couldn't fulfill what these people were looking for. I now have an allo boyfriend whom I was friends with long before we decided to try dating, and he's completely fine without the sex aspect. It just takes time to find someone who's a good fit for you and vice versa, so there's no harm in being picky. My advice is that you broaden your social circle if you can. I know there's varying opinions on whether to befriend someone before dating them, but I think that's key in developing aro/ace relationships. Sometimes the people you end up dating are the ones you'd never expect... In any case, Happy New Year, and I hope you find that special someone!"

Fourteen pages into Hatchet, and I'm like ""All right, easy on the [repitition](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGndc8UUwAEpk8_?format=jpg&name=large)."" I actually didn't read them all the way through because I didn't want to waste my time if I wasn't thoroughly enjoying myself when there are so many more titles on my list.

AskReddit,fcjjese,t3_ehg5ac,1577689941.0,"Sooo I like to roleplay—not DnD but straight up back and forth prose, and one of my characters is a con artist. I put a lot of research into that character because

1. My favorite movie of all time is *Catch Me If You Can,* so, naturally, I based his story off Frank Abagnale and some other con movies including *Matchstick Men* and *The Wolf of Wall Street.*
2. The character specializes in stock fraud, and being that I have never understood the stock market, I took it as an opportunity to do my homework on how it all works.

One day, my grandma (whom I live with) gets a call from someone stating that there had been a charge to her Verizon account for 2 iPhone Xs (worth $2k) made from another state. The guy was supposedly helping us to undo it since we didn't make the purchase, but as soon as he started saying that he was going to send us a code to her phone and that he needed me to give it to him, I began to think, ""Huh. This kind of reminds me of one of the cons I had written for my character."" As the call went on, I began to fantasize about how my character could easily just call someone asking for them to repeat the code back to him like this in order for him to gain access to their account since, sometimes, a website will ask you to verify a code they send to your phone so you can login, whether because you're on a new computer, forgot your password, or have two-step verification turned on. That's when my paranoia kicked in. *What if this guy is doing the same thing to me?*

I told the guy my thoughts and said that I would feel safer if I just called back the Verizon number directly and started all over, just to be sure I was talking to Verizon. He tried to get me to stay on the line, not desperately but in a convincing manner.

Lo and behold, the people at Verizon's fraud department told us that they would never ask for a code and a guy by that name did not work in their department. Ass saved thanks to my fictional anime character.

Oh, and here's the segment that I had written for my character that got my thoughts flowing:

>*""Hello, may I please speak to a Mrs. Miranda Schultz? Hi, Mrs. Schultz, this is John Goodman from Halifax LLC. I'm calling in regards to your most recent withdrawal of $1,377.00 to your checking account. Company policy mandates that I inquire as to whether you authorized this transaction on Februa—What? It was unauthorized? I'm sorry to hear that, Mrs. Schultz. We'll cease further debiting immediately. Please hold.*

>*""Hello, Mrs. Schultz? Yes, thanks for holding. I was able to temporarily freeze your account until further notice. While you will need to come in and provide proper documentation, would you like me to start filing a formal complaint in your name with the Attorney General? Absolutely, ma'am, I'd be glad to help. If I could just get you to verify your Social Security number and the 28-digit number at the bottom of a Halifax personal check, I can get started on your case file immediately...""*"
