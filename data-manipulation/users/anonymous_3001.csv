In final hours he couldn't say a word anymore cause his body went into paralysis, but I understood he was insisting us all not to cry. He was warrior even in those hours he still fought to hint us with his eyes and mumbling words."

Who are they to decide to disable the cards which are not used online? Just a blind decision. It's our card ..... They(goverment) are literally taking decisions on their own.

Bro if you are from India then read today's news paper and data protection bill. If it doesn't concerns you then I don't know what will.

And in perspective of conspiracy, ever heard about RFID chip? ..... Obviously No wonder why these conspiracy chaps tell india is a trial ground for future RFID technology."

conspiracytheories,fej7aoz,t3_epc3cf,1579159893.0,"I feel that if something exceeds the speed of light, then this very universe can't see it. In other words it's out of our visible spectrum, so it might be that there is some other universe right here but we can't see it.

The string theory also states that everything is energy. When we zoom into atoms we see nothing. The very question that ""what gives the atom and this universe the mass?"" Collapses.

It has to be something that pyramid was built in this very coordinate and that too aligning with Orion belt."

My life now is completely changed I see people and then me. I have talked with woke people only through online, but never met a person in face cause the place and state where I live is completely ignorant.

Thinking of writing a book on this and give perception to people here. :)"

So I made it to myself 

It's one life, whatever I do is this time only. This moment is never gonna happen again. No one's gonna remember what happened after few years down the line. So live the life to fullest. Why should we cry for silly things. We are a just a spark of life in this vast endless universe. So make it count and live life. So when you die you could say that yes I lived my life satisfied.

Most people fear to live. The only thing that I fear and you should is ""regret"". Grab ""whatever"" is holding you back by its throat. 

In few months I'm going to conquer my greatest fear and that is ""public speaking""."

AskReddit,fdkx0hg,t3_elssvy,1578512903.0,"1. That babies were born by bursting out or (in other words) they would tear down belly inside out. Because I saw my mom's belly stretch marks and the way it was, I used to think like that and obviously some ideas from TV by looking at women crying loud when conceiving baby.
Later years I began thinking it might be the doctors that babies were taken out by cutting through belly and then stomach. Thinking those made my knees weak, Used to thank God for not making me girl.

2. Characters in movies were killed for real. 
And the next time I would see them in other movie again I would wonder how the hell he/she is alive.

once I hideously cried out loud after looking at movie Titanic thinking that old lady was from real titanic. Calculated the years she had been alive from 1915 and thought to myself that she had so much love that even after all these years she still remembers him. Damn

Stupid me sigh*smh"

It's true that I don't go for explaining them everything, like if I get sick I don't tell them until it gets so serious etc.
