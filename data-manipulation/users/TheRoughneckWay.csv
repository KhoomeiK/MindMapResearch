woodworking,feztw4j,t3_eqzfbo,1579461599.0,What kind of wood did you use for the bicycle?
woodworking,fevzaar,t3_eqmkcx,1579403358.0,"Hey that's really great work. I've basically used up a 4' board just cutting off screw ups. Thanks for reminding me of my inadequacies (kidding, sorry). Really nice work there, keep at it."

But seriously, good job. Ive never seen one like that."

howto,fdp5r9h,t1_fdp29k4,1578620639.0,"Ok, My mom didn't ""make him for me a hobby"". Before my phone decided it knew best I mean to say ""My mom made him get a hobby""."
howto,fdp320k,t1_fdp29k4,1578618818.0,"When my dad retired a few years ago my mom made him for me a hobby so that he wouldn't drive her crazy. He opted for ""Storage Wars""... 
So besides the tons and tons of junk he now owns, he's won several units with power tools. Old, cheap branded loud ones, but they've all worked perfectly. I don't know why or how, but my brother-in-law and I were talking and laughing about the storage units one day and I mentioned that I was tired of dad giving me circular saws on a weekly basis. My BIL looked shocked, jaw gaping and disappointed eyes. He said my dad had been giving him circular saw blades like crazy but never a saw. Needless to say we organized a trade, but I still ended up with 4 I think."
howto,fdoobfq,t1_fdnfp6n,1578609251.0,Also you've just reminded me that I've got spare drills and circular saws lying around collecting dust that ought to be in my boys' hands.
howto,fdnhcx7,t1_fdnfp6n,1578585830.0,"That's possible. In that case, I'd get a small bottle of TiteBond #2 and glue the desk leg bottoms to the lumber, after spray painting them white with primer.  The TiteBond will be bonded to the paint instead of the wood, but a few days ago I had to beat two glued, primered boards apart. It took me 2 unsuccessful swings to realize that I needed to actually swing like I meant it."
howto,fdnfaoh,t1_fdnf3cb,1578584577.0,Thanks Dad.
howto,fdnf2rf,t1_fdn2otz,1578584442.0,"I mean no offense to anyone, and I'm only answering this way because of the context I got from OP's question:
I don't think OP has the tools and technical ability for this. It would be a great and easy project to learn on, if OP is interested, and your how-to would be effective AF. But I think getting the lumber store to cut 4x4 to the length of the desk and just putting it under the legs with a nonslip mat would be easier."
woodworking,fdhqoih,t1_fdh5zds,1578428278.0,"It's probably not as relative in this side of things as it is on the residential construction/remodeling side, but I would prefer to buy my own material. If there's an issue with non-payment I'll repossess my materials right off the side of the house if I need to. 
If someone provides you with $400 in solid walnut and decides they don't want to pay after you've built their piece, they now have a dispute with you over the wood as opposed to you owning the entire situation, don't they?
I may be wrong, or you might have business practices that prevent this. I don't have any experience in selling my work. I'm only recently putting actual time and effort into this ""hobby"", and the side money part is still a long way off."
