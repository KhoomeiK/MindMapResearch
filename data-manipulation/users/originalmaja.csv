So maybe they thought THAT's THE STORYLINE but had no footage, so they used old footage.

Or they ARE full of shit, misleading us.

In the interview she says that this was the only inaccurate thing.

BUT maybe the answers are scripted, since, as an interviewee you never know how things will be edited, so the only thing you can control is your answers. So you prepare them. And maybe she made the decision to only correct this part, but back up the rest, since the docu's success fuels her own. It would be the smart move.

(1) Lexi's post is not so bad. A repost isn't a severe thing in this case. Also, this subreddit is tiny. Maybe it will grow, who knows. Right now: not many people around. I don't think this will hurt her.

(2) Everyone who has not been made aware (well enough) that this is something we all have to consider (= *don't post such stuff, don't keep it online*), will learn something from this whole post and its comments.

(3) There is a chance that Lexi looks up what people say about her online. Many people do, even though it is unhealthy; it's hard to suppress the urge to want to know what people say about you. She's in the public eye now: it's many people by now. So: Maybe she stumbles across this. Or someone who knows and cares for her. It's unlikely, I know, but there is a chance."

(1) The coach should have never told him to do so.
