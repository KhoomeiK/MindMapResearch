PublicFreakout,ffvx05f,t1_ffvlmz3,1580275853.0,"Got a ticket for “failure to update” or some nonsense when I did what every other college student does.   
Pretty sure it was total bullshit, but I got the ticket like 2.5 hours away from home and school, and the time for me to appear to fight it was during one of my classes.   
I’m 99% the fat dumb cop at the roadblock was sour that he ran across a guy with a car full of drunk people with me stone cold sober as the July 4th DD.   
Add in hippy hair out in flat-top country, and you get a bullshit ticket.   
That’s what I get for being honest."
science,ffjeeef,t1_ffjagqi,1579996506.0,"Nothing absolutely groundbreaking.   
Ceramic membranes have come a long way in recent years and have a good deal of advantages over the previous materials (eg, more consistent pore size, longer useful life, ability to withstand greater pressure). Simultaneously, their initial capital cost has gone down (still generally more expensive up front than alternatives).   
There are some challenges that seemingly won’t go away like dealing with the waste brine (gets more concentrated as % yield goes up with higher pressures needed to overcome increasing osmotic pressure) and energy requirements.    
Industrial plants that treat less water, have “nastier” things they need to remove, and can afford higher energy costs often find RO to be very attractive and often use an added crystallization process to avoid discharging the waste brine. Unfortunately, the crystallization step is also pretty energy intensive.    
So IMO, with continued steady technological advances (drive down initial capital investment), increased water scarcity, and increased implementation/improvement of renewable energy sources, we will likely see more desalination plants implemented in our lifetime.    

Technically, I guess a passive distillation/collection process relying on the sun for evaporation could be way more efficient, but I don’t think it’s feasible at the scales needed for drinking water production, but I’m not 100% on that.

todayilearned,ffherkh,t1_ffh6qpx,1579932232.0,"The post title just belies the report content and reads like “look at ALL these dams (big number!) representing an untapped resource”, while the vast majority can likely be ruled out by “back of the envelope” calcs.    
Something close to your 2nd paragraph seems like a more appropriate title, particularly that 4/5 of the 100 most promising dams are already USACE facilities."
todayilearned,ffh4clf,t1_ffgpops,1579922771.0,"I was thinking the available head and flow for most of these would likely represent a tiny amount of theoretical available energy for each damn without factoring in the water-to-wire efficiency.     
Looks like the numbers show it’s even worse than I was thinking.    
It’d be interesting to see the ROI for retrofitting those ~54k damns."

Like you, an ass whooping served as a major deterrent for this sort of thing when I was a kid.        
We’re trying not to pass that down to the next generation, but I’m worried there’s a certain age where time-outs and toy restrictions simply will not do the trick.   
For me at that age, that belt snapping sound was enough for me to get in line without a spanking being necessary."
worldnews,ffb4kvj,t1_ffax7uz,1579751631.0,"Have only caught parts of today’s proceedings, but there was one segment where one guy (a member of the prosecution?) was hammering home all the steps taken by the “framers” to create a system that protected the public against “high crimes” committed by the POTUS. He referenced a bit from (I think) the federalist papers about the reason the trial is held in the Senate, because they are supposed to be the house of congress capable of rising above partisan politics to protect the public welfare and should help to preserve the “co-equal power of the three branches”.  
After hearing about the actions of some senators today, I was absolutely fixated on what could be going through their minds as they hear such a stirring call to at *least* respect the process as laid out by the founding fathers and yet behave in such a disrespectful manner.   
Regardless of party affiliation or opinion on the case presented, such blatant disrespect for the *process* is absolutely appalling. It strikes me as profoundly “un-American” and is the last straw for me personally in my perception of congressional office-holders."
AskReddit,fevsnb3,t1_fevoyce,1579400972.0,"Experienced this phenomenon for the first time one night about a month ago.    
Weird thing was that it was two aircraft right next to each other and they seemed EXTREMELY close to the interstate overpass.    
Made it stranger that they both looked like they were each like one big swept wing with lights that didn’t blink, almost like two giant lit up boomerangs.   
I drove underneath them and they still looked frozen, so I flipped a quick u-turn at the next exit like 1/2 a mile up where an access road thing lets you do that without waiting at a light.   
In the short time I was turning around on the overpass and lost sight, they disappeared entirely.    
Crazy freaking optical illusion.  
Wish I knew what kind of planes they were, cause the shape seemed super weird and they must have been going super slow."
AskReddit,fevqnjr,t1_fevgaxa,1579400344.0,"Had something similar myself around 5th grade.  
Me and 6 friends camping out in 2 separate tents at the back of my dad’s property (5 acres backing up to 100 acres of woods with some farms nearby to the sides with less forest between).    
We’d been kept awake till about midnight kind of freaked out by nearby dairy cows mooing like they were being hurt (possibly mating?). Then we all suddenly awake nearly simultaneously to my dad yelling super loud looking for us at about 3 AM.    
My dad says he’d been yelling for a couple hours and had even driven up near the tents, shined his brights on them, and honked his horn (never looked inside them because he thought it was impossible for us to sleep through that).  He was FURIOUS because he’d wanted to make sure we were safe before he left to oversee a late night concrete pour scheduled for the few off hours of the city transit system and he was super late because he “couldn’t find us”.   
He and my older siblings still don’t believe we hadn’t been out in the woods causing trouble 20 years later.   
Me and my 6 friends have always been baffled this."
