MealPrepSunday,ffcuha4,t1_ffclurt,1579807508.0,I do this for all of my frozen veggies when I meal prep. It saves on time and is cost effective too.
MealPrepSunday,ff7zopf,t3_erw9bo,1579662222.0,I use a Sistema snack container. I found it at TJMaxx. You can put your dip/hummus in the tray and the veggies on the bottom. You can wash it out each night too! It saves on a ton of plastic waste and they last forever.
cats,ff24ecu,t1_ff1b6h8,1579493496.0,As soon as I saw the paws hit and the little head slightly go under I expected it to try to bolt out of the water.
AskReddit,fexz2n3,t3_eqpxnc,1579438593.0,“White Christmas” by the Drifters (Home Alone)
blackcats,fepkfsc,t3_eq9s78,1579322821.0,I love when they do the little arm thing when sitting in something. We tell Sherlock he looks like a bartender cat.
curledfeetsies,feolo7d,t1_fenk0l3,1579301930.0,Woo! That is a good day!
crafts,feogk2k,t1_fenfqcn,1579299873.0,He spotted the kitten fabric and claimed it as his own.
tuckedinkitties,feodf2h,t1_feo3z0l,1579298667.0,Try growing your own. I thought my cat was immune until I had a small plant on the patio. He goes nuts for it.
Floof,feod8wm,t3_eq3ooy,1579298561.0,He wanted to try out the pastel hair color trend.
curledfeetsies,femiyku,t1_femi661,1579257976.0,Sprinkle some cat nip inside. That could lure him in. My kitten had a shark bed and he took a little bit to warm up to it. Your cat cave is so much cuter.
curledfeetsies,felsngt,t3_epqimu,1579229947.0,I love the little cat cave! Does he sleep in it?
ICleanedMyRoom,felschz,t1_felmyed,1579229731.0,I know. I usually show them [this](https://www.studyinternational.com/news/importance-hand-hygiene-schools/) and watch them get grossed out.
cats,fel4wso,t1_fekg5j8,1579214131.0,Meanwhile my cat rolls onto his back and chirps at you until you pet his belly. If you don’t listen to his little noises he then gets closer and closer until he knows you will pet him.
Awwducational,fel3yit,t3_eotv0a,1579213546.0,Reverse bobble head.
Catloaf,fel2s1a,t1_fekb6uj,1579212815.0,"Hello, we’ve been meaning to chat. Please join us."
catbellies,fecoxgz,t3_eo9jl4,1578979503.0,Such an adorable floofer.
cats,feco7gv,t1_fe9o18e,1578978911.0,He is the most adorable floof. I love black cats.
casualknitting,feco0u8,t3_eobrj9,1578978761.0,"Try using a cotton yarn or cotton blend for the yarn type. It will work better as a dishcloth and the pattern will also be more noticeable. Acrylic yarn does not “block” unless you kill it with steam, aka melt some of the fibers to hold it in place. Blocking is usually reserved for lace or natural animal fibers to showcase the pattern or bring it to the correct size. I definitely love it though!"
AskReddit,fdnaowu,t1_fdn2c06,1578581667.0,Or if you lose it an unfolded paper clip works too.
ICleanedMyRoom,fdlwaua,t1_fdfygl0,1578534043.0,So do I. But my stacking makes it 1/8 of that size and it promptly falls.
ICleanedMyRoom,fdlw02p,t1_fdjwaha,1578533838.0,So do a ton of people where I work. I argue we should be washing our hands more which they just hand me the Purell.
casualknitting,fd6kbwj,t3_ejzi81,1578192320.0,"It is adorable! I am not a person who eats frosting often, but I would eat all of that."
MealPrepSunday,fd6jhte,t1_fd65woh,1578191989.0,I agree with this. First you start with what you like because you are more likely to stick with it. Then slowly add in other healthier options until you made the switch. That way you are likely to succeed without then craving your old food right away.
ArtCrit,fcwp4qt,t3_eiadfu,1578032279.0,This reminds me of the Hudson River School where they painted landscape art. I absolutely love it.
cats,fcw4n4m,t1_fcw478j,1578017047.0,"You’re welcome! I’m still new here, but if I knew how to post an image I would. He was sleeping on my lap after he was used to it."
cats,fcuczw0,t1_fctbqy6,1577978076.0,"I have travelled with a kitten, but only in cars. I will say get them used to moving around, even if you just go around the block. This will at least help getting to the airport or trips in general. 

Socializing them with a lot of people will also make it easier so they aren’t overwhelmed by new people in a large place. Just bring them everywhere (they are allowed) to make the transition easier. We started ours at 8 weeks."
childfree,fcuc9o9,t1_fcub7gj,1577977609.0,Ooh. I might look into that. Thank you!
drawing,fcubcxc,t3_eiygn5,1577977009.0,That is a good way to describe it. I work a lot with marker and pencil for my school projects (interiors) so seeing other mediums just blows my mind. I will take your advice to be more mindful. Maybe it will help!
drawing,fcuawi0,t1_fcuaoc1,1577976708.0,You’re welcome! I wish I had your talent with realism.
drawing,fcuai6o,t3_eiygn5,1577976438.0,This is fantastic work! I never realized you could get this level of detail with charcoal.
childfree,fcu7uxt,t3_eikkhe,1577974634.0,Congrats! Was it difficult to find a doctor who respected your decision? I know I have mentioned I want to do it before and have been shot down by a lot of people which is why I stopped looking into it.
