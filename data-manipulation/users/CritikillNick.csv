politics,ffgnfpt,t1_ffggbsc,1579910316.0,"I don’t disagree with what you said. I think anyone giving power to words just because they’re words are nonsensical. I think people who get offended when someone says “shit” but don’t care when people say “poop” are laughably stupid. 

I’m also aware that societally, black people are “allowed to” use the “n word”. Hence why people don’t really care as much, especially white people who do their best to not even think about it because it makes them feel “icky”.

If you don’t want “no brainer responses” then use an example that works better in all contexts. Change Barack Obama to Louis C.K. and now it’s a fantastic example because people never cared that Louis C.K. used it just because he was funny."

gaming,ffadzb4,t1_ffadat0,1579733352.0,"Well first of all it was half as long as it should’ve been. I beat it in 3 days and when I got to the final zone I couldn’t believe I was even remotely close to done. I felt like I hadn’t gotten a single answer to dozens of questions and every world was “something is going on but you don’t know what” despite this game supposedly being “the end”. It felt like it was just starting to get a little momentum and then ends.

Even on harder difficulties combat gets very dull especially with the ridiculous ride attacks. I expected to be a keyblade master by the end but nope. They just throw abilities at you with no pacing. I don’t even think I used half the magic before getting another upgrade to it. Then it’s over.

Final Fantasy characters and many side characters up and disappeared for no reason. This was a MASSIVE negative to me. Cloud, Zack, Leon, and Auron were my favorites. Other side characters either didn’t speak or acted like there was no history with Sora.

The ending was just completely horrible. An absolute let down. I actually deleted the game off my ps4 after. I was so angry after waiting like a decade for the game. I’ve got more problems but these are the main ones. It’s still not a bad game but it’s hardly 25% of the third KH game I wanted"
