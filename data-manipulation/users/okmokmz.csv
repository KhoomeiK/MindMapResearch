Technically all ingredients and allergens are listed on food in the US as well, which apparently isn't always accurate based on the studies that have been done

>there are loads of non-dark chocolates that are accidentally vegan because they're made with soy, almond or coconut milk

That's true, but I would have assumed vegans would avoid dark chocolate anyway since they aren't always vegan, and you don't want to just hope that they are accidentally vegan

>You can get specialised vegan chocolates as well but they're about twice the price

I wonder if the price is due to the regulations required to label something vegan, or simply because of the cost of guaranteeing the ingredients are vegan further ahead in the production line"

How exactly do you propose we do this?

Lets use cows as an example; the vast majority of the emissions from farming them is due to methane production from the cows waste, and the conversion of the land that the cows need to live on. Do you know how to farm cows that don't poop or fart at all, and don't need to live/graze on any land? No... because you cannot simply ""fix the farms."" Lots of these emissions are unavoidable"

Can't vegans not eat chocolate anyways due to dairy? Even the majority of dark chocolate has some amount of dairy in it.

>Unfortunately, you can’t always tell if dark chocolate contains milk by reading the ingredients list. FDA researchers found that of 94 dark chocolate bars tested, only six listed milk as an ingredient. When testing the remaining 88 bars that did not list milk as an ingredient, FDA found that 51 of them actually did contain milk. In fact, the FDA study found milk in 61 percent of all bars tested.
