neoliberal,ffnjmr2,t1_ffn4xdt,1580066823.0,"Others are making some valid, to my eyes, points on your understanding of there being different-but-equally-valid ""genres"" of economics, but I do understand your point that economists are speculating and theorizing a lot more often than, say, physicists are.  That uncertainty opens the door for ideological interpretations on fringe/untested/untestable situations.  BUT there are certain things practically everybody agrees upon (rent control is innefective at best, Bernie's specific M4A proposal will be astronomically expensive, to name two).

So i'll leave the rest of that convo and hopefully contribute to the specific point you made on college, because it did make me think for a second.  But as OP said, demand for college is very inelastic.  I don't know anybody from my neighborhood didn't go to college because it was too expensive.  I know people that opted for cheaper, less prestigious schools.  Often community college which, at least near me, provided direct paths to transfer to a 4-year program.  I know people that didn't go because they never wanted to.  But I know very few people who, at 18, weren't sure whether or not they would go, and I knew fewer still for whom the price tag was a key factor.  Frankly, most had decided one way or the other by 12.  10 years ago when I left for college, price was a factor in deciding which school you went to, not whether you went, but I'd be unsurprised to learn that is changing as we speak *because of* the student debt crisis.

I grew up poor, and while I avoided nightmare-level loans, I am unlikely to pay mine off before turning 40.   By definition, debt forgiveness would target people like me that HAVE incurred debt, not those whose parents paid their way, and not those who never went.  That's why I am much more in favor of free public college than loan forgiveness.  Maybe there is a selection bias like you said, and the reason mostly well-offs have student debt is the non well-offs never went to college.  Like I said in paragraph 1, I don't think that's true historically, but it may become so as student debt has gained more attention.  We can make things cheaper for them without asking the people I grew up with to pick up *my* nerdy ass's tab, when I and the people I went to school with are -- on aggregate -- doing better financially today than the people from my lower class county are.

(And I know my tab would be paid directly by the rich and not the poor, but that's still upper class dollars going to upper-middle class pockets, when they could be going to the poor.  Which is also why I like Pete's plan to not subsidize college for the rich.)"
socialism,ffmowa6,t1_ffmooej,1580057356.0,"Could also hugely fix this by allowing people to build more housing (in some cases, maybe even capitalist people and in some cases, even those shitty highrises anybody with working eyes would hate).  People, in general, want to live in cities.  Not everybody, at all, but in a free society, cities are by their very nature ""the places that disproportionately mant people have decided to live.""  They can't afford to because the landlords (not the renters who actually live there) lobby to restrict the building of more houses, because it would decrease the value of theirs.  They often astroturf these campaigns as ""don't allow these highrise builders to gentrify of our neighborhood"" while they continue to raise the rent that will, end the end, actually achieve that very gentrification.

This all ties back into overpopultion because shipping food to a handful of dense cities is much more ecologically effecient than shippint it to suburbs all over the world, and doing so allows us to use rhat that other land for creating the food that feeds those people, and leaving large swaths of nature largely untouched.

I genuinely took him to be saying, and I could be wrong, ""We walked into Planet of the Apes [meaning Africa where Planet of the Apes was set], oh shit Planet of the Apes didn't take place in Africa, that was a racist thing for me to say.""  Only the part in brackets isn't nearly an exact quote from the video I saw.

I did not hear him say ""black people are apes"" or even ""black people are apes.""  I hear him specifically say something that sounds like it might imply that, then quickly correct himself and say ""oh shit I said that cus I was thinking Planet of the Apes was set in Africa, it's not, that was a racist mistake to make.""  Which is cringeworthy *at best*, but it's a long way from ""this might be racist, but black people are apes.""

As for the indication that this is something other than an indication of his beliefs; the entire rest of the video is about a positive experience he had at a black theater, not because of the far-too-common whitewashing bullshit of ""it was so great, it was just like a white theater!"" but because of a specific and foreign (to his famously sheltered ass) experience that he could not have had in his own neighborhood.  He also spends a big portion of the video lamenting that all the trailers were for movies starring white people, and the only black person in this film was a villain, and even he didn't seem to give the viewers in that theater any meaningful on-screen representation.  To me he stumbles into a dehumanizing black people through a shoddy ""joke"", if that, says ""oh shit that was a bad thing I just said"", then spends the rest of the video saying ""I had fun in this black theater and was sad that, even in thsi black theater, there was so little black representation on screen.""

neoliberal,ffhjxd2,t1_ffgtu6r,1579938677.0,"Two bits of prefacing from me; I am not a Joe Rogan fan.  I listened to his podcast a lot when I first found podcasts and hadn't yet found good podcasts.  Beyond obvious targets he's had as guests like Milo and Alex Jones, I have been trying to cancel his bestie Ari Shaffir for about a decade. 
 I'm not committed to any Joe apologia, just trying to be fair.  Second, I can't prove this to you, but I'd say this to any black person I know in person, except for maybe coworkers or employees cus work sucks and I'd worry they felt pressured to swallow any objections.

But I genuinely took him to be saying, and I could be wrong, ""We walked into Planet of the Apes [meaning Africa where Planet of the Apes was set], there were black people everywhere [like in Africa], oh shit Planet of the Apes didn't take place in Africa, woops that was a racist thing for me to say.""  Only the part in brackets isn't nearly an exact quote.  It's clumsy at best and you're 100% right that had he said that in front of a black person, he would have taken more time to explain his fuckup and not ""haha silly me woops conflating africa with an ape planet lolz"".  He probably would've taken care to have not fucking said it in front of a black person, honestly.  Alarm bells would've gone off in time.  He then literally complains about a trailer in which Jonah Hill speaks codeswitches to talk to a black doorman, maybe 1 minute after having done a super cringeworthy impression of a black guy himself.  There's a lot to dislike here.

But the bulk of the video is him saying he had a legitimately good time watching in a black theater, and not just because ""it was just like a white theater"" -- he talks about enjoying an experience in this neighborhood that he could not have had in his own.  He then laments that even in this crowd full of practically all black people, all the trailers are for films with exclusively white casts, and the movie they've come to view features 1 black actor, who plays a villain.

The entire linked video just doesn't feel, to me, like a guy dehumanizing black people.  I'm not doubting or arguing your personal reaction for a second, or trying to convince you to like Joe --  even on his good days Joe sounds like a Gen X Uncle from Boston.

The reason it hasn't gotten more attention is, in my opinion, that it doesn't deserve it.  He admitted it was racist half-jokingly, because he seemed to genuinely think for a moment that Planet of the Apes took place in Africa, realized it didn't, and thought/said ""yeesh that was a racist mistake to make"", calling out his accidental engagement with the same nasty-ass stereotype this thread's OP seems to be implying the engaged with deliberately.

The video is literally him explaining a positive experience he had in a black neighborhood that was distinctly not the experience you'd be likely to have in a white neighborhood.  He explicitly calls out under-representation of black characters in hollywood film.  He is praises black culture without white-washing it, although yea I think we probably should've white-washed his own language during some of his impressions of black people.  I think it'd take extremely rustlable jimmies to watch this video and say ""how does this racist have platform still!?""  

You may've seen a differently-edited video, but aside from some shitty choice of words that he literally corrects himself on, some cringey ebonics, the linked video is literally a video about having fun in a black movie theater and coming to appreciate how even theaters whose clientele is practically all black theaters have no choice but to watch mostly all white film.

Sure he sounds like my idiot fucking uncle, and if I brought someone to a party and he talked like that I'd blush redder than a lobster, but I really think if he had just ""endorsed"" Biden we'd see this post on lefty reddit and this sub would be calling it a straw-grasp."

But they were not chained to a ship and forcibly shipped to Vermont where they then saw babies stripped from their mothers, selling them to farmers who they will work for all their lives, eventually forcing them to breed with other slaves with whom the farmer thought they'd make good slave babies who were then also taken away from them if doing so was deemed profitable, all under the threat of murder, and the *promise* of physical abuse.

This isn't my assumption dude, it's my whole fucking point.  I shouldn't have to say more but since you called my argument ""so dumb"" I feel defensive.  But you literally just stated my argument, said it was correct, then brought up some whole other shit which I already understand.  I get what your point is, I explained it myself.

If you want to fully boycott the MLB, i'll say a third time, you cannot buy tickets from scalpers or otherwise.  1000%.  The league does not care who bought a seat, scalper or fan, as long as all seats get sold (key point there) and hopefully filled by concession and merch hungry consumers.

But, if you want to minimize how much of their nut comes from your pocket and still go to a couple games cus the sport is bigger than the league to you, and you ONLY buy from scalpers, the MLB will make less money in every game that is not already sold out.  Yes they are still sold a ticket, yes they will probably sell it again tomorrow cus the scalper got his dollar and wants to keep the hustle going.  Now's where I will point out, I obviously simplified the window down to 1 transaction to make a point and that was apparently exposed my cluelessness, which you explained by widening that window to two whole days -- that's fine, i get you are making a point and will give you the benefit of the doubt you haven't given me, but if you think scalpers are that precisely managing their inventory that precisely and responsively you are the clueless one. i'm sure you don't actually think that, but for the record, professional-scale scalpers usually do not sell every ticket they buy, and amateur scalpers aren't buying inventories of tickets just to sell them later.  That's what makes them amateur, and there are lots of such scalpers that you have neglected totally -- people who buy a ticket planning to go, can't go, try and sell a ticket, and whether that ticket sells will have no meaningful effect on their likelihood to buy more in the future.  To them it *is* a single transaction market, and they comprise some nonzero percentage of the population.  Bam, marginally less money for the leaguebon average right there, but I'll go on.

If, when non-scalped tickets are available, you still elect to always buy from the scalper, you are always giving your money to a third party when you could give it to the league.  The league gets less of your money.  If scalped tickets are the only ones available, then yes your buying from the scalper is practically the same as giving to the league.  Still marginally better on aggregate in the case that, again, it's a one-off sale from a fan regretfully unable to attend (assuming you keep up your half boycott by not going broke on merch and concessions).  Meaning, on average, if you buy *exclusively* from scalpers, either for 1 day or your whole life, the league will make some amount of money off you that is smaller than if you'd attended the same exact games and bought your own ticket through MLB.  Quantifiably less in games which not every seat has been sold.

Why do you think it is only technically legal to resell tickets through parties like stubhub that give the venue a small cut of the sale (hence the ""i need tickets"" signs from people actually selling tickets)?

Because, as is the only claim I have made all along, the league makes marginally less money when you buy a scalped ticket and leaves seats unsold than they would if you bought the unsold seats."
baseball,ffai3yk,t1_ffahd4j,1579736263.0,"No you are contributing less.  If you want to go full boycott, yes, the only way is zero tickets.

MLB sells $20 ticket to scalper.  I buy pay Scalper $30 for that ticket.  MLB has $20.

Not to mention not all scalpers are running a for-profit hustle, some sell for face-value because they intended to attend but cannot.

That math falters a bit for games where not only is every ticket sold, but every seat gets filled by a real human, but on average, second hand puts LESS money in the MLB's pocket.  But, yes, if you want to give them 0 dimes this year buy no tickets watch no games click no ads."

It doesn't shock me Kahwi had a mediocre year in the stat one year.  If Kahwi Leonard played for 16 seasons with 16 different benches against (29 Teams)×(16 Seasons) = 464 different bench squads with a mediocre on/off, though, I would similarly think ""maybe he wasn't *quite* what we'd hyped him to be.""

And this also all assumes, again, a dramatically sanitized ""benches face benches starters face starters"" universe.  Kobe played 40 minuted a game some seasons, he had LOTS of minutes against scrubs that should've provided some counterweight to his minutes against stars.  Sure he played primarily against stars, but it's not like Kobe never ever spent a second guarding Carlos Arroyo.

Again I may still be missing something, but even then I'm not saying Kobe was a BAD defender, just that a 16 year sample size of Lakers backups did a better job guarding other backups than Kobe did guarding stars, according to this on/off stat, and that maybe that means Kobe was not god-tier on defense.  That's all."
baseball,ffag7h2,t1_ffadb3a,1579735008.0,"I literally explained that exact economy in my comment.

When you buy from a scalper, you are not *directly* funding the MLB cus they have already gotten their dollar from the scalper stocking his inventory, but people buying from the scalper is why he bothers to stock his inventory to begin with.  I get it.

For this reason, buying from a scalper results in less cash in the MLB's pockets than buying an entire new ticket would (especially in the case of not-sold-out events), but you are still indirectly putting some amount of money in their pocket when you buy from a scalper."

Also, you can't play 40+ mpg without getting lots of minutes against the other team's bench units.

So I'm not claiming expertise here (I'm the ""how so"" guy), but it would seem that with 16 seasons of sample size we can conclude that Kobe was not an absolute lockdown defensive anchor caliber player on that side of the floor, right?

Jk although I can give some insight into the value I've found; it's a way to form new habits or disrupt bad ones.  

I could stand to drink less in general, but the week from christmas to NYE especially I am pretty much accepting drinks on muscle memory.  I don't work that week, and there are parties or gatherings more nights than not.  Feels good break that habit, go dry jan, come back to February with a more conscious/mindful relationship with booze.

For good habits, I do shit like read a book a week or force myself to, no matter what, go to the gym every day for a month.  I can go, change my clothes, and go home if I really want to, but I have to go.  I'd usually find myself doing full or nearly-full workouts once I'd forced myself to go, and after about a month it becomes something of a habit and even when I don't have that ""resolution,"" I find myself needing a better excuse than ""I don't feel like it"" if I'm gonna skip.  I still skip a lot, but it helps. 

Also, w the gym one especially, I am sadly the type of person that if I set a goal to go every day for a year, or even 5 times a week for a year, I'd bail entirely in week 2.  Too overwhelming.  When I have a finish line in sight, I can more easily accomplish difficult-but-healthy goals.

But rather than say ""fifty percent of voters plus one more"" I saved time by saying ""51%"".  It's a shorthand.  I know cus I wrote it, ya silly lil cutie!"

Don't most of those grants come from corporations or nonprofits who are funded by *some* entity's profits?  In some cases they are tax-funded, but most of that tax revenues come from people working for or running businesses that need to turn a profit to stay in business.

Maybe I misunderstand grants and you can help me out."

If you think everybody does know what you just said (they do) but were saying 51% to save keystrokes cus only a fool wouldn't understand the substance of the message, you are indeed being extremely pedantic.

So while we are being pedantic, significant figures can indeed enter into this discussion.  In the case of a voting population of 100, 51% = 50 percent plus 1 more.  In fact, in populations of up to 200 where we are rounding (sigfigs), 50 percent plus 1 more also would be described as 51%"

neoliberal,fej64n4,t1_fej43e1,1579158444.0,"Agreed.  I tend to agree witb more takes here than any other sub, but not *nearly* all of them.  The snarkiness and in-group attitude here can be especially frustrating cus levelheadedness is supposed to be one of neoliberalism's core appeals.  When libertarians and socialists plug their ears and ""nanana cant hear you statist/centrist"" I kinda askcmyself what I expected.  When it happens here it bums me out.  

Honest question do you know of any subs a little less memey or more open to discussion than this one?  I love meminess and would stay subbed here regardless but it'd be nice to chat, not just get a daily roundup of pro Biden & Pete headlines.  It feels, especially in an election year, a place to work through ideas should be easy to find, but I haven't found it yet.

I get objecting to a lot of her stances, I really do.  Either from a centrist or a leftist standpoint.  But she should be any Bernie supporter's second choice (aside from maybe Yang, i still haven't fully made heads or tales of that guy).  

Distant second is fine, but siding with Trump over her is not, and many in these comments are doing exactly that (at least on this issue)."
socialism,feh73yb,t1_feh5mzj,1579110527.0,I just said she was the most similar in the race.  Who in this race would you say is *more* similar? From either a policy or rhetoric standpoint?
sixers,fegqpbm,t1_fegga95,1579100289.0,"Agreed 100%.  I was just replying to the specific comment but, yes, 70% from FT from him seems a reasonable 1 season goal and much easier than developing a 3.

Not to mention, developing his FT would help his 3 more than developing his 3 would help his FT.

I'm just saying making 0.6 threes a game *would* also help the team."
sixers,fegqg5r,t1_fefpqp6,1579100115.0,"I'm not saying you need to clamp the fuck down on 0.9 PPS, but if you totally ignore it you're fucked.

When 0.9 PPS is ahead, run its offense til 12 on the shot clock.  Settle for the unguarded 0.9 PPS.  When behind, put up 0.9 PPS every 8 seconds.  They'll win a lot of games.

Again teams would still regularly sag off Ben at 30%, as well they should, but at 30% if he gets an open look in the corner, someone at least has to step to him.  Then ben can decide to shoot pass or blow by them.  As it is now, that's practically a reset."
socialism,fegprtn,t3_ep0wsv,1579099645.0,"Listen, frankly I doubt Bernie said anything one iota worse than ""it might be harder for a woman to win 2020 than it would've been in 2016 because of identity politics and the fact the voters just saw one lose"" and I doubt he even said that.

But you guys appealing to Donald Trump as a moral authority over Elizabeth Warren is not a good look.  You think he actually has a take on this?  He is clearly trying to sow division.  And your response is to upvote a comment telling the candidate *most similar to Bernie* that she should drop out and commit seppuku in a dark hole?"

That's all i am saying.  Going from A- to A+++ is usually a lot harder than going from F to C-.  He should focus on 3s (for spacing purposes specificially -- general I think FT should be his focus)"
sixers,fef2f6n,t1_feepwm0,1579046579.0,"That's a point per shot, homie.  Ben puts up 1.2 points per shot from 2, and he's *really* good from 2, much better than most players.  If you're letting him waltz up, take no time off the clock, expend no energy, put up 1 point per posession, and waltz back to lock down on d...you're gonna have a bad time.

Unfortunately you can't let him do that cus he can't hit 1/3 threes."
sixers,fedtofo,t1_fedcob2,1579019665.0,"Attempting 2 and making 0.6 will absolutely help.  Gotta guard that.  0.6 a game means some games you make zero sometimes you make three.  Hit one or two and people will come out on you.  It's hitting two a season that won't help us.

Taking 5 and making 2 is a 40% shooter, I don't think we'll ever see that from Ben.  Nobody should be asking him to become an assassin, just enough of a threat so teams can't totally sag off.  It wouldn't only help his teammates, it'd help his own driving game."
sixers,fedscdn,t1_fedn4tx,1579018848.0,"I agree that ben's not the immediate answer to the spacing issues, but he's already elite going to the rim, I don't think the marginal difference between him and giannis' rim game is nearly as significant as the 1.7 threes giannis makes a game this year and the 0.6 he's made through his career.

A slight improvement near the rim may be the more achievable goal for Ben, but if we're talking about the reason Ben's ignored at the perimeter and Giannis isn't, I think it's pretty simply that giannis can hit threes."
