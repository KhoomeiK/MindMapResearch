clevercomebacks,ffeoi76,t1_ffdgh3o,1579857429.0,"Okay, yeah, these are terrible old people candy. I hadn't seen these since 1994, and then they appeared mysteriously at my parents' house on Christmas. 

They were BRAND NEW (from the store...nobody has manufactured them in 25 years), and they were all stuck together in a big candy brick. 

I think my parents just turned old this year."

insaneparents,fewmb8x,t1_fewc714,1579414485.0,"There are three uses for semicolons: (1) in a list of three or more items where you'd usually use commas to separate the items but there's punctuation within one or more items, like this one; (2) combining two related independent clauses without using a conjunction (e.g. I don't want to jog today; it is too cold); and (3) combining two related independent clauses with a conjunctive adverb, like *therefore, nevertheless, also, then, finally,* or *likewise* (e.g., it was really cold today; nevertheless, I enjoyed going for a run).

The semicolon is my favorite punctuation mark; I wish more people used it!"
