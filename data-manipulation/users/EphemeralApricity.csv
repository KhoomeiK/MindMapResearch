They're not married yet, and just because they're getting married doesn't mean he gets to decide unilaterally that they're combining all of their finances now and that he's now in charge of every financial decision. That's a choice you have to make together as a couple. He doesn't get to just skip that whole conversation (which in a healthy relationship would be a conversation and not a fight) and tell her that everything she buys is his decision now. They have to decide together what they want to do. He's trying to take her part in that decision-making process away.

My mind would go blank at simple things like ""tell me about yourself"" and I would come across as nervous and unprepared every time. 

What I did was look up a list of the most common interview questions and came up with answers to each one, and then before an interview I would practice giving the answers so I would remember them. There are also lots of tips online for how to answer very common questions. The difference between going in prepared vs. unprepared is night and day."

For married couples where they do not have the same last name use ""Mrs. Jane Jones and Mr. John Smith.""

I read a lot of etiquette guides when I had to address wedding invitations because I was completely not on board with writing ""Mr. and Mrs. John Smith"" but I didn't want to inadvertently offend any older guests by breaching established etiquette. Apparently the ""important"" thing is not to separate the man's first name from his last name, which is why writing out both names in full is completely fine but writing ""Mr. and Mrs. John and Jane Smith"" is ""wrong"" (but of course wiping out the woman's name entirely is just fine and dandy)."
