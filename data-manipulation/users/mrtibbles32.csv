You can't be anxious about whether people will hate you or not when your depression convinces you that they'll hate you no matter what and to just do whatever you like because your life is meaningless.

So y'know, I don't have social anxiety anymore, but also I'm giga depressed and nothing makes me happy."
Drugs,fgtw0xn,t1_fgt9vu3,1581110151.0,"Yeah, I don't really prescribe anyone anything, I just help people get things for lower costs if they ask me about it.

I know some stuff about pharmacologic interactions and things like that because I've nearly died from serotonin syndrome a couple times, so I research most things I do a lot. I usually just give people advice on how to use certain drugs properly for harm reduction.

Like, someone could just go and get random shitty presses and possibly hurt themselves, but I'm able to pull genuine prescription xanax for them where I know the dosage and can explain to them how to use it without hurting themselves.

Like, I'd never reccomend someone use a benzo everyday unless a doctor told them to, and even then I'd be cautious because benzo withdraw even on like a low dose of klonopin daily will fuck you up.

I've gotten other people to avoid drugs like that because they'll ask me to get it for them, and I will provided they listen to me explain it to them. A lot of people dont know about mdma comedowns or benzo withdrawl, or lethal polypharmic interactions or anything like that. After I explain it to them people usually arent really eager to try it anymore.

Like I'm not a doctor, but I try to do my best to reduce harm and help others do what they think is right for them. If someone was a tiny bit anxious I wouldn't just give them a ziploc bag of red devils or anything, they'd probably kill themselves.

If they really want a dangerous substance, for recreation or medication, they're gonna get it from someone else if not me, so I usually give it to them so I can make sure it's proper and not an analogue or something, and I do my best to advise and warn people about the dangers of the substance they intend to use. I'm not making any money off of it because i don't charge a profit, but I'd rather lose profits and someone has proper medication and knowledge to use it than having them go buy stepped-on adderall or some shitty misdosed presses or something from a dealer who will charge them stupid prices and not tell them anything about what they're doing."

Because of that I actually help other people get meds they need. I know other people who need meds that doctors wont give them.

I got a friend who has bad adhd and can't focus, but she cant ever be prescribed stimulants because she went to rehab for cocaine. She stopped using pretty much every drug after a really bad incident with benzos, so she genuinely uses them for school. I get her stims for free usually to help her.

I also know another guy who has bad anxiety and it gives him imsomnia, I'm working on getting him xanax because he genuinely just cant sleep because he's constantly anxious.

I have lots of contacts, so I don't have trouble getting something if I needed it, but lots of people dont have that and need medication. I usually get it for them and either dont charge or only ask for what I paid for it (which is usually cheaper than normal price because I buy in bulk).

I can't fix all the problems with our current domestic drug policy, but I try to do my part to help because I don't want people to be denied treatment like I was, nobody should have to suffer because they can't be ""trusted"" to be healthy."

Drugs,fgr3c54,t1_fgqjyus,1581037208.0,"Well, self-medicating can work in the circumstance that you can't get a much needed medical treatment legally for some reason.

For example, I have a pretty bad attention deficit as a result of my depression. No doctor would give me stimulants because I smoke and used to (keyword *used to*) drink a lot. 2 different doctors and my therapist told me i couldn't be ""trusted"" with stimulants and basically that i just had to keep suffering and trying anti-depressants that didnt work and made me sick.

I did a good amount of research on stimulants and decided that I'm not asking for permission from doctors, therapists, or the feds so I can be healthy. I'm gonna be healthy regardless of their opinion because its my life and I refuse to let it be shit so someone else can power trip.

Got stims illegally, dosed them properly every day, and they helped a lot. I could actually read and focus and work and be a normal person again. Eventually i found a doctor who prescribed me stims, so now I don't have to get them illegally anymore.

I wouldn't reccomend self-medicating unless you really know what you're doing, but it helped me a lot."

Even things with strong tastes can be masked properly if you know what you're doing.

Like, everclear will make most drinks hurt like a bitch even with mixer, but if you mix it with grape flavoring you can hardly taste the alcohol.

There's probably something you could put cannabutter on that masks the taste like that, or at the very least disguise it so its not noticable unless you're trying to taste it."

No, it's actually because we're all severely depressed and have to take multiple anti-depressants and stimulants just to function like a normal human and our intense lack of self worth from being mostly invisible to others results in a disbelief that someone could want us and makes sex feel like some kind of cruel joke.

benzodiazepines,fgoj63r,t1_fgoikwp,1580971932.0,">Medicaid for all 2020

Government subsidized healthcare while neat on paper translates to a awful deal for low income families when applied in real life.

Just like college loan subsidization, it allows suppliers to artificially inflate their prices while keeping demand constant, creating a funnel of money from the state's budget to the pockets of the supplier. This extra income de-incentivizes competitive market practices and reduces the quality of healthcare while driving up the price, relative to the price.

You could look at the US in the early 20th century before much legislation was written on the topic of healthcare.

Communities would voluntarily pool funds to hire a local doctor. These contracts were highly sought after and increased healthcare quality, reduced its cost, and even made it possible for the incredibly poor to afford decent healthcare for the time.

This practice was ended when lobbyists from the medical field got legislation passed that produced price floors and other measures that restricted market competition.

While i agree that everyone should be able to access quality healthcare, i feel that more government restriction or legislation would make it harder for that goal to be achieved. Allowing the market to operate more freely produced that goal in the past, so it seems reasonable that it could be returned to by deregulating the healthcare industry."

insanepeoplefacebook,fge003k,t3_extqlh,1580688842.0,"Raising the minimum wage reduces the availability of low paying labor jobs because it negates any financial benefit to the job existing or makes automation a better alternative.

An employer now has many more qualified applicants than jobs they need filled, resulting in only the best applicants having a chance to be hired for *any* job.

This is a problem for disabled workers because they will be worth less to their employer than a non-disabled worker.

They're unlikely to be able to get a job anywhere because they're never considered to be among the highest quality applicants, effectively making them unemployable.

Allowing them to be paid sub-minimum wage lets them do jobs that would normally be automated or not done at all. It's not much money, but it's better than being completely unable to be employed and essentially forced into homelessness.


Edit: you can either have no disabled workers employed, or let them be employed at a lower wage. Unless you make the minimum wage $0, there will always be a surplus of workers and a deficit of jobs."
