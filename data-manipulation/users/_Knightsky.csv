Christian,fetdskc,t3_eq6t10,1579374335.0,"From what I know of them, which is admittedly not much, I wouldn't consider them a cult. From what I understand a cult is a religious group in which a leader or leaders uses false teaching to control a group of people. This usually involves a lot of threading and fear tactics in order to keep people from leaving or disobeying the people in charge."

DecidingToBeBetter,feeaumc,t3_eoj2qn,1579029962.0,"There are some things that you can do on your own like cbt and meditation, but it can be hard to handle on your own. Don’t be ashamed of you do end up needing to see your therapist again. You aren’t weak or pathetic if you need some help dealing with things right now. A good therapist will help you deal with what you’re experiencing in the present but they will also help you build yourself up so you can start to handle the problems yourself. Best of luck to you man, I hope things get better for you soon

Btw, if you want to look into cbt more I really recommend Dr David Burns and his books. I’ve read ‘When Panic Attacks’ and ‘Feeling Good’ and they have helped me with my anxiety and depression so much."

I’m making some very good progress though, I’ve started doing a lot of cbt and mindfulness meditation and it’s helping me tremendously. I just try to relax and not focus on cravings when they come inside of freaking out and making them worse. I’m teaching myself that those thoughts aren’t true and I shouldn’t be afraid of them. I’m getting better and better each day and I really feel a shift happening."

I’ve been using drugs to cover up my problems which means they never got fixed. I really believe that working on the things I dislike about my life will help in recovering and visa versa. Thank you so much for your advice, God bless you!"
Christian,fe6d2nk,t1_fe57wym,1578887385.0,"Haha no I’m not using meth. I tend to agree that drugs themselves aren’t good or bad it how you use them. For me drugs don’t add anything good to my life. I’m not using anything that is going to immediately ruin my life but there has been a negative impact on most areas of my life. I also don’t want to be addicted to anything, I want to be able to decide when and if I use anything. Thank you for your insight!"

Christian,fe3m3yk,t1_fe3hl3p,1578850576.0,"To be honest I haven’t, thank you for pointing me in that direction. Do you have any more passages that I can read along with Matthew 4?"
socialskills,fe3lh6g,t3_enkpyq,1578850363.0,"Yeah, that’s pretty normal. I did the same exact shit for a while, hanging out with people who weren’t more than surface level friends and feeling unable to have those deeper friendships I wanted. It’s not all your fault, some people are too busy with other things to think about friendships much. Some people just don’t click well, you may even stop clicking with someone you were good friends with. There’s nothing bad about these things, stuff just happens. With something like friendships you don’t have full control over achievement of that goal. You could be a young, handsome, charismatic guy but if no one around you is interested in friendships it doesn’t make a difference. 

I’ve just started to do more things that I enjoy, pursuing goals and interests and just living my life. I still try and meet new people and make more friends but I don’t go way outta my way for that anymore. I just try to meet people while I’m doing the stuff I love. You’ll attract the right kind of people when you’re living your life your own way. I mean even if you still don’t make connections doing things you love, well at least you had a good time. That’s way better than having a bunch of shallow friendships that do nothing for you. Good luck man, good friends are hard to find but worth the wait and effort."
socialskills,fe3ed3w,t3_enkq0e,1578848505.0,"People tend to like you more if you’re similar to them. Dressing like the people you want to hang around is a good way to do this as appearance has a massive impact on first impressions. Obviously don’t wear the exact same outfit, just follow the general style. Along with that make sure you look good when you go out. This means take care of general hygiene, have a haircut and/or facial hair that suits your face, wear clothes that fit well, smell good etc. Also just putting some time into your appearance helps too ie skin care, gym, good nutrition and sleep. 

Also good posture, relaxed confident body language, smiling and so one help."

He has to decide for himself if he wants to improve, telling him he needs to do x,y and z all the time will just make I’m hate self improvement. Just drop a little tip here and there and lead by example, that’s the best way to motivate others."
socialskills,fe2mid4,t3_ennbvq,1578840567.0,"I think you should try integrating some of that outgoing, social energy into your life. You don’t necessarily have to be ‘fake’ but everyone has to force themselves to be social when they don’t want to sometimes. Good social health is extremely important so you’ll have to find a balance that gives you a good social life and doesn’t make you feel like you’re lying to yourself or something."
socialskills,fe2liyf,t3_ennrpc,1578839990.0,Just do what you already do (ie if you guys haven’t gone past kissing start there) then slowly turn it up and see how far she feels comfortable going.
socialskills,fe2kxaa,t3_ennyff,1578839685.0,Yeah man go for it. I would say keep the first date pretty casual since you don’t really know each other that much. Something like a coffee or light lunch would be good.

socialskills,fe2e2kr,t3_enjdcs,1578837316.0,"Yeah I do something similar to that, I try to do a cold shower every morning for 1 min. I’ve found that doing something I don’t want to do in the morning makes doing other things I don’t want to do easier throughout the day. Plus you get the other benefits of cold showers so it’s a win win."
ENFP,fe2d1vf,t3_enn1ie,1578837040.0,"Kinda the opposite for me, I have really intense sadness and such after a break up. It doesn’t last for very long, 1-2 weeks tops, but I’m a wreck that whole time."
Christian,fe2c3k9,t1_fe1zitw,1578836775.0,"Yes I am, I have a good group of friends there and a great relationship with my pastor. I just don’t think I can talk to them about this, I’m so ashamed of this. I know they would be more than supportive of me and wouldn’t do anything to belittle me or ostracize me but it’s still so painful to imagine telling them. I have a therapist that’s been working with me and I tell all that stuff to him but there’s a huge difference between telling him and telling family and friends.

Thank you for your prayers, I really really need them."

I’m using CBT and trying to work on myself in other areas too. I realized that I used drugs as an escape, I want to fix the things in my life that I’m unhappy with instead of running from them. That and doing my best to avoid triggers and making it as hard as possible to actually get them, especially when I know I’m likely to get cravings."

You can also get some certifications, depending on the job they mean a lot more than a degree. For example you could do personal training and take the ACSM and/or NASM exam, that’ll get you into 99% of gyms. The place I work at now couldn’t care less about my exercise science degree, they just saw I that had my cert. Both of those exams cost just a few hundred dollars for the study material and test if I remember correctly, pm me about it if you’re interested."
loseit,fdsbsx7,t3_emxfs0,1578698996.0,"First start by finding your bmr, this website is really good 
https://www.leighpeele.com/mifflin-st-jeor-calculator

Next take your bmr and subtract 15-20% and you have your cutting calories. Bmr x .15= 15% 

Then focus on getting 1g of protein per pound of body weight. Protein is very important on a cut as I’m sure you know. 

Start lifting, of course start at an appropriate level and build yourself up over time. Cardio is great but you don’t need that much, I do 2-3 15 min hiit workout a week and some walking if I haven’t been very active that day."
socialskills,fdb27u1,t3_ekgesi,1578252905.0,"I'm not in the same situation but I do have some thoughts. Don't just not do something you want to do because you don't want to inconvenience other people. You're 30 right now, sure you're a little behind the curve right now but you're never going to get any better unless you start working on it. You deserve a good, fulfilled life just as much as anyone else, don't sacrifice your happiness just so you wont cause a minor inconvenience to someone."

Please don't listen to them, you're doing great! Also, I know you didn't mention this but if you ever feel bad for not being able to do that much right now please don't. Remember that you're a beginner and that everyone, even the best athletes, started small. Just do what you can and slowly build up over time and you'll accomplish your goals in no time. Best of luck to you!

selfimprovement,fd374q3,t3_ejyc27,1578155326.0,Great man! I think keeping a journal is a really good idea for what you want to do. It can help you keep track of your thoughts and identify negative thought patterns.
CBT,fcz4pff,t1_fcx91ej,1578093612.0,"Yeah that’s right, I have been thinking that way for a long time so it makes sense it’s gonna take some time to get out of that rut. I have a cbt journal that I keep but I’ll definitely look into that app, thanks!!"

CBT,fcwq55x,t3_ej8l9v,1578033292.0,"I actually have that book and I love it! It’s the biggest thing that’s helped me get this far in overcoming my social anxiety. 

The exercises that I’ve tried and that have made the most difference in the past are finding the root cause of the distortion and logical reasoning. Finding the root cause just consists of asking myself why I’m afraid of x thing happening. So for example 

I’m scared people will think I’m a loser. Well what if everyone thought you were a loser, what are you worried would happen? Then everyone will reject me. And what if people did reject you, what would that mean to you? That would mean that I’m unlovable.

So the root cause would be I think I need people to like me or I won’t be loved and I need love to be happy.

And then the logical argument one is straight forward, I usually do it after finding the root cause so I can get at the source of the problem.

The problem this time is that I know I don’t necessarily need friends or approval from others, but I want it. I want to have a good social life and of course make my friends happy and have a good time together with them. I understand thinking things like “I’m too boring”  “they don’t really like me that much” or “I’m not good enough to be friends with them” only hurts me and are distorted negative thoughts. However logically knowing that it’s all nonsense doesn’t have much impact on my anxiety. 

Thank you so much to your kind words. I’m absolutely gonna fight it till it’s completely gone!"
selfimprovement,fcwhlx8,t3_ej9jfm,1578025836.0,"Psycho-cybernetics is pretty interesting. It talks about self image and how it affects your behavior. It also goes into a few ways to work on bettering your self image, trying some now but it’s too early to say how effective they are.

I also really like Can’t hurt me by David Goggins"
Dietandhealth,fcw7cu8,t3_ej5ztq,1578018825.0,So are you in a 500 cal deficit total or your in a deficit and you burn an extra 500 cals from cardio? 1200 calories seems a little low to me but it’s not going to hurt you to drop weight that fast. The only thing to keep in mind that the faster you lose weight the easier it is to gain it back so if you start losing weight much faster than you are now go ahead and scale it back.

socialskills,fcp5uxj,t3_eia14u,1577851458.0,"Yeah I know that feeling, I’m usually a super social person unless I happen to go a little while with a lot of social interaction. I get lonely and for whatever reason I start to not want to talk to people or go out. I think I read somewhere that your brain sees loneliness just as painful as physical injuries. The brain can then associate that pain with socializing in general, this is what’s responsible for that aversion to socializing even though you’re lonely and want to connect with others. In my own experience you just have to push through those uncomfortable first few times socializing. After that you start to get more socially healthy and those feelings will go away."
