ffxiv,fgr0fvl,t1_fgqyyw1,1581035414.0,"I've actually got a system that is working pretty well, I think. To give kind of a back-end peek of the system - using spreadsheets with hidden data, everything is calculated for the player on their front end view. So they just copy the correct roll from the spreadsheet for the ability they want to use and paste into the discord we use to play, where a dicebot lives. 

That way, all the numbers are handled for them, just like it's handled for us when we play, and it (fairly) accurate matches the numbers the game produces.

Mechanics are changed to play better in a table-top environment. Every... 3 rounds, if I remember off the top of my head, is 60 seconds of game time (subject to change, but that's the current thing) for the sake of 'cool downs', but let's say.... Rampart. Lasts 2 rounds of fighting, cools down for 3. 

Critical and Direct Hits work based on a 1d20 dice roll, so do skills (like... swimming, knowledges, performing kind of skills).

I make up my own fight mechanics that work better for table top when it comes to fights. It's worked pretty darn well for the last two and a half years!

Similarly to ALW's version of Phantom of the Opera, which I actually think is a decent enough movie despite its many flaws, CATS has the issue that they took a show meant to be on a stage, using the commonly accepted methods of theater, and applied them to film without understanding why the methods of theater are done as such. An example from PotO is a basic one - when the Phantom takes Christine down into the depths of the Opera House, typically there is a huge use of candles to illustrate the change of scene between the tunnels and his lair. Sometimes it's pushed onto stage, sometimes (with a bigger budget) the candles rise up out of the floor. When ALW and Schumacher recreate this scene on film... candles rise up out of the water of the lair along with thousands of candles all around. It makes little sense in the world of 'reality' the film has created and yet it's still there... because that's how it exists in the stage show.

CATS does similar things. A good example is the song sung by Jennyanydots and the much hated mice and cockroaches. In the stage show, there is a consistant use of the other cats coming in to help the story of the song by putting on costumes (often designed to look like trash being re-used) and thus the mice and cockroaches are just kind of fun and silly in the stage show. You see this same costuming effect during the now rarely-used song ""The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and Pollicles"" (has a bit of rasicm rocking in it and now they usually put in Growltiger instead, but the filmed version of the stage show has it). Instead of thinking about the reason and why of the mice and cockroaches, the movie puts on a show of pure terror showing tiny children as mice and cockroach-human hybrids straight out of a horror movie. The eating of them didn't help at all. In the same song on the stage show, the switch between Jennyanydots as the 'gumby cat' in her rolly-polly fat suit to her slimmer tap dancing costume is more fun and fantastic, coming across as the difference between day and night in cats how they lounge about all day and at night tend to be more active. In the movie... every time she unzips her FLESH, it's god damn terrifying. She's already in something skin tight to begin with and putting a costume underneath that doesn't change her figure just comes across creepy and disturbing.

Using Victoria and her youth as a main character I thought was a surprisingly good choice for a film adaptation, as you need someone who has reason to learn all of this new world to be the eyes for the audience, but something gets horrifically lost in her use. Victoria is meant to be one of the best dancers of the Jellicle cats and you see glimpses of it during the film, but either the CGI loses her gracefulness or it isn't fully put to good use or a mix of the two because they had an actual ballet dancer (ballet is a requirement of the role of Victoria on the stage show) and yet the beauty of her dance never comes through. 

A far, FAR more painful loss is Mistoffelees. In the stage show, the actor playing Mistoffelees is required to have extensive ballet and gymnastics training. (Also fun fact - the role is usually dedicated to smaller men, anyone 5'7"" or smaller.) They also don't necessarily need to be a good singer - the dancing is that important. Famously, the role has Mistoffelees execute his 'Conjuring Turn', 24 consecutive fouettés en tournant.

We see exactly none of this in the movie. While the role plays up that Mistoffelees is a young tom who isn't completely certain of his powers, to a degree I actually found uncomfortable, they actually do have him occassionally do something without thinking about it, such as summoning the bone to throw to the dog to save Victoria. He also makes lightning crack during Sir Ian McKellen's number. But then when it comes to saving Old Deuteronomy... all of the brilliance and magic of Mistoffelees' signature song is lost between his anxiety and lack of dancing. (I thought I would avoid this but also the stupid floating CGI which looks worse than special effects on stage.)

Macavity gets turned from a fearsome shadow, a shiver down your spine, into an eye-rolling *whiner*. Phantom of the Opera and CATS share the same problem - instead of letting the viewer use their imagination, letting things be mysterious and unknown (things we are naturally curious and yet afraid of)... they just show you everything. There could have been a stronger use of Macavity by having the cats that are taken away just walk into the shadows, called to them, and then they're not seen again. Instead of magical-poofy-sand-powers that look stupid AF and take away any mystery.

Also the fur coat and hat looked much better than the skin-suit fur on Macavity, but I digress.

It's little things like this throughout the movie that either destroy any joy a character had - I literally cringed at the way they played out Bustopher Jones and was confused about Bombalurina being turned into an evil henchcat - or use CGI over practical special effects that take you out of the story entirely. I actually think that turning the plot line into 'cats performing for their leader to be picked as the Jellicle choice' in a more solid fashion actually was a good way of handling it, but that's as far as it goes. 

Oh, and I will be fair on one thing. I actually enjoyed Skimbleshanks. Not that the CGI and random floatiness of the characters and random switching of locations in a way that isn't possible wasn't distracting, but turning Skimbleshanks into a very active, fun extended tap number, using the rails themselves and tapping on them to match the sound of a train... it was without a doubt the best execution of any of the songs. Also they had one actual GOOD dancer in that tap dancer and let him shine in his number."

bestoflegaladvice,fg7sofa,t3_ex8z32,1580600489.0,"In all honesty, I feel for the OP. I adopted a sweet dog from a shelter that had said the dog was good with cats. So I did the normal thing you do and kept them apart for a while, letting the dog sniff the cats through the door, etc. I was surprised that the dog seemed really intent on my cats and so I actually kept them apart for longer than suggested.

One night, I was downstairs making dinner when I heard a commotion. It came down the stairs, there was a thud in the living room, then it came barrelling towards the kitchen. It was my younger cat, streaking for the safety of the cat door going into the basement... with the dog right behind him.

Turned out my dog, who I had actually closed off in my bedroom so the cats could have some free roam time, literally ripped through the thin wood of the door to get at my cat.

I watched the dog grab my cat by the hind quarters and shake with all of his might. I remember screaming. I remember grabbing the dog's muzzle and trying to force it open while my cat is shrieking in pain. Somehow, I got bit by BOTH animals in the process but managed to get the dog to let go. 

Cat streaked into the basement through the cat door. Dog stood there confused. There was a trail of blood leading towards the basement door, the dog had several deep scratches on his face, and I was bleeding badly from my hand and wrist.

I ended up leaving a trail of blood myself as I went upstairs to my room to get my phone, called two of my friends to come, NOW. I got into the basement and found my cat, who was shaking in a corner. I got him into a cat carrier... I don't even know how, all one-handed and shoved him into the arms of the first friend who arrived. Gave her my credit card and the address of the emergency vet.

Waited until my other friend came and got taken to the hospital. Ended up thankfully with no broken bones or needing stitches, but a severely bruised tendon and a lot of deep puncture marks. Hand was so swollen I couldn't bend it. Thankfully, my friend who took me to the hospital went back to my house while I was waiting, cleaned the dog up, and put him in the guest room with some food and water.

I called the shelter the next day in tears. I explained what happened and was told I could only return the dog to their main shelter, which was about 45 minutes away. At this point in my life, I had a job that wasn't very keen on such calls out of work and I attempted to explain my situation to them only to be told I had no choice.

So I took the day off work and brought the dog to the shelter, driving one handed. They gave me shit because I couldn't fill out the paperwork (my busted hand was my writing hand) and I ended up getting an employee to help me out. I was just... sobbing the entire time, trying to explain to the employee that the dog was good around people, so sweet, but couldn't go to a home with a child or small pets. I can remember begging that the dog not be put down because of the bite.

I went home, having turned him over and certain I had sent this dog to its death, not even realizing that the shelter had lied to me about the dog and how it was with cats until several days later. I ended up calling them and got told it wasn't my problem anymore. 

Saw the same dog up for adoption about two weeks after I had turned him in... listed as good with cats and child. I tried to call and say it shouldn't, that there was a mistake because he needed to go to a home without cats or children, and was told that I wasn't to call them again.

Maybe it's just a thing shelters do. I don't even understand it. He could have gotten a great home as the only pet because he was so good with people. Instead, someone's going to have to pay the same price I did or worse."

I think that Susano is just that - a kami taking physical form. He did need some aether to do so - the relics - and kami are summoned by prayer (and sometimes sacrifice, fun!) so that's to be expected. 

We know from the dungeon up in Azys Lla that Garuda was once a living general of the birdies and that her existence, entirely, is crafted from the will of her summoners combined with the crystals. However, Susano *exists* with or without the summoners or their power. Not physically, but his personality, his temperament, etc... comes from him. No one else. Which is why he is a rather fun, jolly sort of character who just wants to have an epic battle and he thanks us for it when he's defeated. Remember, the Kojin who summoned him were pretty darn pissed at us. They ask the relics for aid, and a kami steps forward to answer that prayer and have a fun fight. 

Now, curiously, we do have another somewhat... let's say... less pure-murder primal in Ramuh as well. He does come ready to wreck us, but he ends up just 'judging' us and judges us to be well. Okay. Sort of. But that interestingly goes back to the belief of the Sylphs who believe him to be a wise arbitrator, not by default a murder-bot like Garuda and Ifrit and Titan. Which only ties in more that a primal is purely the will and belief of the summoner (SHALL WE POINT TO A NOW FAMOUS ONE IN SHB...?) while Susano acts very much on his own. The Kojin did not pick anything SPECIFIC to summon."

ffxiv,fg04vh7,t1_ffzys25,1580400263.0,"Speaking on the BLM and RDM behalf:

SAM and BLM should be at the top of the DPS charts purely because they have nothing else to provide *but* damage. There's nothing else they can give. BLM feels pretty darn good right now but it's confusing to see SMN up there when they provide more.

RDM is in sore need of help when it comes to DPS. SE treats Verraise like it gives 1k DPS every time we have to rez someone, but as someone recently so clearly pointed out to me, it's the most 'expensive' raise in return for being the fastest. But if we don't have to raise anyone? We only have embolden to give to the party. I think it would be a big help to RDM for rDPS if Embolden affected ALL DPS, not just melee. If you don't have the 'perfect' set up for a party when it comes to Embolden, your Embolden could be down to nearly nothing for assistance. 

Either we need to buff or debuff more or give RDM more DPS. I wish RDM could do awesome debuffs like they did in any other FF game but SE is weirdly against player-given debuffs in XIV."

That was my thought because from the neck down, all I could see was bright pink on his arms. The rest of him was hidden by the barrier.

LARP,ffr8h2b,t3_eupmgw,1580152740.0,"Hello! Might I suggest looking into [The Townsends youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/jastownsendandson)? They do recipes and show recipes that could easily be replicated with a fantasy/medieval theme and would check a lot of your boxes, I believe! They also show a lot about cooking over a fire and some of their implements on their website would look fantastic with your theme and help you in the 'cook over a fire' situation. 

As far as some advice myself, the things I would look into:

Pemmican.

Beef jerky! I could give you my recipe for it if you'd like. Very easy to make, cheap, and tastes delicious.

Cold brew teas. I'd just rig up a huge glass jar and a ladle to dish it out and it can stay good for hours. You can make it easily at home or make it look super authentic by taking loose tea, putting it into a cheese cloth, tie it with a bit of string, and putting the homemade tea bag into the large jar of clean water. 

Homemade granola bars.  Easy and simple loads of protein and slow release carbs.

edit: forgot to add - do not make 'sun brew' tea. It can build up bacteria. If you use a large jar that's been cleaned well in a dishwasher before use and make your tea by boiling it, it'll stay fine for hours but sun brew tea can build up yuck."

Since the rigging is Hyur-rigging, combat animations and the like are already taken care of.

The complaint SE always has about armors and everything except head pieces would have already been taken care of (again because they are Hyurs neck down). It already has a tie-in to the world and would have made a THOUSAND times more sense than making Viera and Hrothgar just appear out of no where on the Source where they haven't been for thousands of years. Viera could have purely been on the First and Lupin, clearly, already come from the Source and a match could have been on the First. Bam, I already made the new races make more sense than SE did.
