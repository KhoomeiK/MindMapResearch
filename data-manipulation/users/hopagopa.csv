Of course, there was still traditional Norse and Roman superstition about 'changelings' which resulted in children with deformities or certain disorders being abandoned. The medieval Catholic Church explicitly banned this practice, and required that any parent capable of caring for their children did so, as well as generously providing for orphanages. 

Now, the disabled were always discriminated against, and still are today. The Christian world was just as, if not more imperfect in that regard than the modern secular world. But, this isn't to say there hasn't also always been a push for kindness and compassion. We shouldn't be so quick to judge our ancestors, before we look to ourselves."

Also, every business has what are called 'profit margins', some like grocery stores and Telecom companies run *razor thin* margins. Appropriate that Walmart and Comcast represent the closest thing to a modern Monopoly in America then. If a small business is forced to pay above market value (the definition of min wage) for all labor (no matter skill or experience), then their profit margins narrow even deeper.

Don't forget, all businesses start in debt. No one makes money from day one, ever. Minimum wage forces them to make even bigger investments than they already are, just to get the thing off the ground. 

This in turn means they'll raise prices, meaning only entrenched businesses can afford to stay around with competitive prices. This is in fact the naked strategy of Starbucks. They go places with a young coffee market, undercut prices, and drive competition out of business.

You can't just haphazardly connect any natural disaster with climate change, as we lack a way to reliably measure historical global climate outside the poles by cutting ice cores. So any of these guesses are nailing what is more like a whirlwind of factors into a single, politically convenient cause.

If you google the '200' figure you'll get a congo line of cocksuckers saying it's misinformation. This is because the police don't just arrest any moron that drops a lit cig. There were 24 arrested, plus 183 suspects or citations.

Another convenient fact that these climate scientists ignore is the numerous other factors that contribute to the growing danger of wildfires, totally unrelated to CO2 emissions. In the Amazon for example, fires were mostly started by illegal ranchers. In California, encroaching urbanism and rapid population rise, along with the spread of industry and degradation of forest care have led to worse fires.

Despite this, the earth is doing splendidly. Over the past decade we've seen a resplendent growth in forests thanks to the 'global greening'. Our corals are coming back. Arctic ices have melted, yes, but sea levels have barely risen as a result. We have no reason to assume things will get drastically worse, and every time we've predicted imminent doom we've been sorely wrong.

Except for hirers like Walmart and Amazon (which exploit public stimulus and benefit from anti-competitive min wage laws because they create barriers to entry), employers do not owe the public. They're entitled to their own revenue, and only have a duty to pay employees what they agree to. Many Americans are self-employeed, franchisees, or small business owners; any law that mandates a duty or tax on them is punishment. Amazon and Walmart deserve this punishment, Joe and Anita don't.

Philosophy degrees are actually really good, even an art degree can be leveraged. The issue is people entering education without career building knowledge. Career building, and personal finance, **can** help people out of poverty. I would know, I've lived it.

Also, you have no idea about personal finance if you think the ability to get loans is a bad thing. Speaking of which, and I'm not blaming Americans, on the contrary I love my countrymen...

While I'm a huge proponent of protecting and expanding these programs, pretending that they're a necessity for more than 50% of jobs when in reality they're a necessity for less than 20% is a harmful and disingenuous way of viewing our economy.

Make no mistake, that's still about 50 million people (America's population is a bit over 300 million); 20% is bad, but 50% is hell. It's painfully obvious, however, that the solution is lowering of costs. Things like public transportation, food subsidies, and transparent healthcare pricing will help immensely.

1. I do. For one, it's fundamentally different from even reading someone else's erotica (which I advise against, research is best done by experience). It's also essentially just putting your own mental fantasies on a page, plenty of people here say it's fine to indulge your fantasies without porn, and I agree... I just happen to write them down.

2. I deal with the urge by exploring it. Yes, I'm horny when writing, if I'm not then I'm not doing a good job. Writing it out means I have to think about where my thoughts are leading me, it's a half meditative, half masturbatory process. If you must know, I do jerk off by the end.

3. I do this to better understand my desires, and focus them productively. Going porn free means you have a lot of sexual energy, and I found this to be a useful outlet for it that is easily attainable for me."

pornfree,fcaho8j,t1_fcag1tl,1577569418.0,"More time. Masturbation takes a minimum of 5 minutes a session, but can last *much* longer, especially if you edge (which I strongly advise against, messes with your sexual function).

More energy. The 'sperm magic' stuff is bullshit, there's no scientific basis for the benefits of semen retention in of itself, but mood *is* dropped (but satiety is raised) post orgasm. If you want more energy and a heightened mood, and you don't like caffeine, cut down on masturbation.

I'm not a urologist, so I can't speak much to frequency of erections with masturbating vs. without. What I *can* tell you is that even when masturbating roughly every day, I still get strong, frequent, erections and morning wood. I have no trouble getting, or maintaining, an erection. 

When I stopped for a couple days, I did get *more* erections but this was more of an annoyance than anything else. The only reason I could see this as a benefit is if you have frequent sex anyway.

Having frequent erections *is* however, a sign of good penile health. And the more, and stronger, you have the better. But after a certain point there is a 'use it or lose it' effect, usually after the third day of no stimulation. 

There are also benefits to mental acuity, focus, and motivation; but these come with any form of abstinence. Fasting offers the same benefits.

All in all, if you're looking for these benefits, I'd recommend cutting down on other things as well (like video games, food, and drinking alcohol/caffeine/etc.). There are benefits to masturbation too, so you're probably best off doing it temporarily and partially, whenever you want the boost. Rather than burden yourself with constant stress of willpower.

Edit: seems like you're worried about ""only"" getting one erection a day. There's nothing to be worried about and that's perfectly healthy. If you've successfully quit porn, then just stay the course. The main reason you had more when you were younger is you were pubescent, sex drive decreases rapidly as you mature through puberty."

Which is more harmful, porn or masturbation? Which is easier to quit, porn or masturbation?

I've tried nofap, to no avail, and found that with no porn I could still reach orgasm easily. Quitting porn made my fantasies and sexting (with my dedicated partner) infinitely more enjoyable. And I *don't* feel a compulsion to seek out novel or harmful ways of enjoying my sexuality. 

I won't deny, there are benefits to total abstinence. The Apostle Paul says as much (the ancients are far, far smarter than modern media makes them out to be), *but* he adds a corollary: ""**If they can't control their urges**, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion."""
pornfree,fcadppp,t3_egqzln,1577567484.0,"I won't speculate on your relationship and whether she's ignorant, testing you, or actively sabotaging you...

I will say this though, you should absolutely not. Put your foot down and make it clear to her that it's not something you feel comfortable or safe doing (otherwise you wouldn't ask). Ask her if she would do the same if you had another addiction? Ask her if she's willing to take your porn addiction seriously?

Here are the problems with this idea: 

1. You're still watching porn, even if it's softcore and you aren't paying attention to it/masturbating to it. 

2. Even if you aren't into the porn or don't view it at all, you're still creating an association in your brain between porn and intimacy (the *exact* thing we're trying to erase). 

3. If you *are* then it gets even worse, as the softcore porn could trigger a hard relapse and make you lose all your progress.
