It’s a great tool that ruins your face if you overdo it, like everyone on TV seems to. 

Someone else mentioned the Snow app, which is new to me. I don’t know if it’s some combination of that and Botox or what. But to take all the character out of her face, especially when she’s naturally so interesting looking? What a shame, that she felt she had to do that!
