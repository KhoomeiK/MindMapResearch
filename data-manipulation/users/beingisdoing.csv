Another option is a Mitsubishi KH-20. This is a very high quality sharpener with a higher price tag. It’s smooth and makes a nice point. It doesn’t expose as much graphite as the Deli 0635, but it’s a nice point regardless. It’s pricier, though. 

I’m not a fan of the bladed long point sharpener that Blackwing sells because the blades become dull rather quickly, making it easy to snap your graphite points while sharpening far too frequently. It’s basically the same as a KUM long point sharpener. Don’t get me wrong, they make a nice point, but only with super sharp blades. But imo, the blades dull too quickly to justify the purchase.

You can also go with an electric option. I don’t have any electric sharpeners myself but I’ve heard that AFMAT sharpeners make nice point, better than most electrics out there.

Many people shadow box with no real focus and just move around and throw punches in the air. No. This is where you refine technique and program the movements into your brain. 

Practice your balance with no punching. Just moving and creating angles. You can practice posture and scenarios. So shadow box more, a lot more. Like every day. You will see tremendous improvement.
