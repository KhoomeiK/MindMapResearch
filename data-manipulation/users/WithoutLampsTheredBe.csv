One of the factors I consider when I evaluate life advice is the life of the person giving the advice.  Does this person have a life I want to emulate or aspire to?

So, on one side, we have a morbidly obese person, soon to be scooter-bound.  She has no job or visible means of support.  Her biggest joys in life are eating, to excess.  She claims to be a writer but cannot write.  She claims to be a dancer but does not dance.  She claims to be a triathaloner but does not triathalon.  She seems angry/depressed. 

On the other hand, we have a healthy, active, successful woman.  She supports herself.  She believes in being responsible for herself, including her own health.  She gets joy in activity.  She does not blame others or deny the consequences of her own actions.  She thinks a musician should be evaluated on her music.  She seems happy, proactive, enthusiastic.

Hmmm.  Which one should I take life advice from?"

Flipping,fdes9rg,t3_ekwu12,1578345546.0,"Depends on the item.

Is it competing with 100 others like it?  Is it competing with Chinese stuff?  Is it long tail?  Can you afford to let it sit for a while?  Is it an in-demand item? A rare item?

Flipping,fdermv1,t1_fdee2n4,1578345168.0,"Some options:

1.  Do nothing for a while.  Wait for the buyer to contact you.  One downside of this is that they may go directly to opening a case instead of contacting you.  One upside is that there is the possibility you will never hear from them (has happened to me).

2.  Refund the transaction amount, less the shipping.

3.  Message the buyer, tell them it came back, ask them if they want to pay to reship to the correct address.

What is your return policy?  If it is ""no returns"", they are possibly trying to bypass your policy.

Is the ""return to sender"" handwritten?  A sticker put on by USPS?  Does it say ""not at this address""?  What does the tracking say?"
