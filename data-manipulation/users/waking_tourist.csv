I have a dysthymic disorder as well, though lately have been working to understand borderline personality disorder with my therapist. I have hallmarks of the disorder as well, though I feel like a lot of ACAs do: don't talk, don't trust, don't feel seems like a gateway to the disorder.

don't know why I'm spilling this here, but perhaps to state openly that it takes time, sometimes years, of paying attention to yourself and learning patterns to see what really is happening and why. in my humble, layperson opinion, don't push yourself to a psychiatric medication as a first effort. if it's a final resort, I may consider it myself one day.... but progress, REAL progress..... takes time. be gentle on yourself, you're already getting somewhere, I see you"

AskReddit,fevqz69,t1_fettt50,1579400447.0,I've experienced this often n and really feel like this is what deja vu is. I chalk it up to being in the right place at the right time and find it weirdly comforting. maybe that's just what I tell myself.
