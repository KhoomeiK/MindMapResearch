Parenting,feorve2,t1_feoqqpd,1579304572.0,"She chose to stay sick and she chose to abandon her children. The father did nothing wrong. I don't understand why people are defending this woman. I was addicted to crack cocaine for the better part of a year, and then I got pregnant, so quit smoking cigarettes and quit smoking crack for my baby. I didn't have the baby and abandon it to go be an addict. I know crack isn't heroin, but I know what addiction is like. This woman had 4 (four) children and a husband that sounds like a good dude, and she abandoned them all. And was violent to the dad. Why is she being defended?"

sleeptrain,fenndm7,t1_fenmglo,1579288145.0,"It doesn't sound right that she doesn't have to eat at night. But I'm not a doctor, that's just my motherly instinct talking."
sleeptrain,fenmv8y,t1_fenm9qa,1579288034.0,"I've only got the one kid. My nurse comes from the NFP program, but ""The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) program provides nurse home visits to pregnant women with no previous live births, most of whom are (i) low-income, (ii) unmarried, and (iii) teenagers."" (That's a quote from evidencebasedprograms.org)

I'd reccomend calling your insurance and asking if they cover any kind of help for mothers. I don't know where you live, so I can't specifically offer any programs to you. You might find help with La Leche League, though."

Here's an article I found about big babies:

Question: ""Everyone comments on how pudgy my six-month-old baby is. When I took her to the doctor, he said she was in the 95th percentile for height and weight. What exactly does that mean? Do I need to think about putting my daughter on a diet?""

sleeptrain,fenm2ji,t1_fenlimb,1579287592.0,"Okay, I am no help to you, then. I'd suggest seeking professional help. I have a nurse that comes and visits me every two weeks, and she answers any questions I have. If nothing changes with your daughter, then maybe go to therapy for yourself. I plan on seeing a therapist here soon, myself. Has your daughter always been this way?"
sleeptrain,fenl5v5,t1_fenknbo,1579287035.0,"Has he tried positioning things so it's like he's breastfeeding her? Is he sure she is hungry? Does she not want to suck at all? Is the flow of the bottle too fast/too slow? Have you tried different nipples? Is it formula or pumped breast milk? If formula, is she having a reaction to the formula? I'm assuming if he's rocking her, he's probably talking to her, encouraging her to take the bottle? Sometimes I have to talk really sweetly to my son to get him to latch onto my breast because he's busy fussing and getting more worked up."
sleeptrain,fenki32,t1_fenk9mw,1579286635.0,How does he go about bottlefeeding?
sleeptrain,fenk8wq,t1_fenhzjc,1579286485.0,"Yes, you're right. I should've taken a moment before I responded. I was just very worried and shocked, so I freaked out."
sleeptrain,fenjzno,t1_fenj4nw,1579286329.0,"I don't have personal experience with that, so I do not have advice to give you there. Children usually ""attach"" to one parent more than the other. So your baby is probably more attached to you, and that's why you experience these difficulties. I'd just say for your husband to keep trying to give her a bottle.

Are you saying that nobody will attempt cosleeping, or just your husband won't? Because you, yourself, can still try"
MaliciousCompliance,fenjatg,t1_feninqj,1579285904.0,This is a great story!
sleeptrain,fendqc9,t1_fencs3x,1579282492.0,"I'm sorry, I get really worked up when I see bad parenting. The only advice I can give is to try co-sleeping. This is only anecdotal evidence, but the little one sleeps with me from about 9pm-7am. He will feed in his sleep, without fully waking me up. He's three months old. He doesn't cry at all at night. Sometimes his squirming will wake me up, but that usually just means he needs his diaper changed, or he isn't finding my nipple in his sleep. If you decide to co-sleep, then please do it safely.

sleeptrain,fenc1yl,t3_emky6t,1579281471.0,Crying it out is psychologically damaging to a child. Don't let anyone tell you different. There have been numerous studies done on this.
sleeptrain,fenbzm5,t3_emky6t,1579281430.0,I'm sorry... Did you say you're leaving your infant alone for 12 hours?

Parenting,fen9yuw,t1_femtykm,1579280180.0,How does it piss her off more? Are you perhaps holding her in a way that hurts? Babies need cuddles and attention.
