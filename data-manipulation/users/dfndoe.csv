I will point out that the reason Oakland still owes as much as they do is because the city is bad at managing bond debt, the reason they still owe money is because they keep refinancing the debt stretching repayment and interest of the original 200MM to over 350MM.

Oakland is complete shit at budget management and makes matters worse by doing dumb shit like self managing pension funds for Fire and Police while completely not preventing rampant fraud. And don't even get me started on overtime fraud which results in the city paying an extra 30MM a year for it's inept Police department.

Loudly complaining about the coliseum as the team leaves town is just sour grapes, and punching down at fans who are losing something important to them.

Also, you seem to be a baseball fan, since you've completely absolved the A's and their continual grubbing for sweetheart land deals and tax dodges against the Town.

Your whole schtick is just disingenuous and peacock strutting around telling people to fuck off betrays what a asshole you are."
