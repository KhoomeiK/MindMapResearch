Heavy breathing. Rattled, dry, rapid breathes. 

He hasn’t had strength to sit up for days. 

Suddenly, he shoots up in bed, eyes wide open, mouth agape. I don’t know how long he was like this. Maybe five seconds. He returned to lying down, and that was it. His final moments. I don’t know if it was fear, a brief moment of panic? A reflex by the body once the heart stopped? I don’t know.

From a legal perspective, be careful about just putting people’s stuff outside the house and changing the locks.
