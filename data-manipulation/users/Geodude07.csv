I will agree that a shoddy education does this, but plenty of middle class folks are also gleefully ignoring their health. So I put it as more an issue of societal focus. We don't encourage healthy eating, but rather encourage mindless consumption.

You feel bad? Buy this! Eat this! Buy a really treadmill/workout thing and hang your coat on it. 

You don't need a damn gym membership to lose weight. That already shows ignorance to believe. We have google. We have so much information. A simple and honest desire to learn...and actually try...will get you results. 

The problem is its easy to blame everything but ourselves. We can recognize our struggles may have come from other sources, but at a certain point we have to take control.

It's pathetic to think most people get winded on two flights of stairs. Maybe it is closer to reality that the average person will in the US though. As our average is overweight.

The best teacher doesn't always make everyone happy. The issue with teaching is that it feels like you should start talking, and suddenly everyone is listening and cares. That somehow we are suppose to please everyone...when every other job/profession/performance has a very clear ""You can't please everyone"". 

The trick is that you do make a huge difference to enough students that you are a good teacher. It's just that you rarely get to enjoy that.

When a student does well it's because that student was just naturally gifted, or their parents actually care, or whatever else that gives you no credit. 

When a students does poorly it's because you're the worst teacher in the world. Not because of parents, ineffective consequences, bad admins, or whatever else might actually be the reason. 

It's easy to take it personally and feel like working harder is the answer. I think it sometimes is good to step back and recognize that you are the pro in the room. That it's okay if you can't get them all. It's unrealistic to expect to do so and probably does more harm than good."
fatlogic,fdibnse,t3_ekylim,1578439309.0,"The issue with the often stated ""just eat a cheeseburger"" is not that a cheeseburger is bad. It's the intent behind the statement. It's the idea that by being thin you are avoiding perfectly fine and enjoyable foods.

A burger isn't terrible. It isn't the only source of protein either though. I mean chicken is pretty great. The bread of a burger tends to be an annoying calorie addon...but a single burger? Come on. 

Eating a burger is fine, the issue is just that most people don't stop at a burger or even one meal. They go for the quadra-arterykill burger with giganto fries, a big sugary drink, load up on bbq sauce with even more calories, and then still eat a full meal for breakfast and dinner.

Of course it's easy to assume they had the same choices we do today. It's also easy to pretend the social setting was just a few 'choices' away from being as it is today. 

I don't think that there is really a limit to how many people have had terrible parents. I can certainly say a lot about my own father.

I do think that corporations are being cheap and doing things to make you want their product, yet I also think it's a bit much to act like we can not just say no. A lot of excuses I had for not eating well involved the 'time' to cook.

The issue was I had never tried. I found it was actually cheap and easy. I also found out that counting calories had to actually be done and not just guesstimated. There is very much power in our own hands. No one is going to do it for us, so I find it hard to say that a lot of the people complaining are necessarily just too poor or can do nothing.

Poverty does have some impact in what you may have access to, but it doesn't prevent counting calories. It doesn't mean you can not get decent food. The issue is most people prefer oreos and milk for breakfast or a high calorie TV dinner.

People refuse to get educated and hold pride in their ignorance, like the FA/HAES sorts do. I think that is the real damaging part. The word 'calories' scares most people off of even starting diets. It's why people make those dumb 'point buy' systems. All to avoid discussing the core issue...because many people don't even want to deal with it."

loseit,fct0vic,t3_eipxuk,1577929984.0,"If you want muscle/strength, follow a progressive overload program of some kind. I recommend getting the app ""personal training coach"". It has a number of beginner programs and it helps keep track of what you're doing. Keep in mind it is hard to put on muscle, so you do not have to worry about accidentally going too far. 

For weight loss, that is all in counting calories. Outrunning your fork is not generally plausible. So be sure not to reward yourself for exercise with more food. 

You should find out your TDEE with a TDEE calculator online. Then find out how much you need to eat to lose. Most calculators give you a recommended 'loss' count where you're not starving yourself.



Things like a fitbit or apple watch are nice...but its a bit of a gimmick too. You don't need it, but it's nice to have. You may be best served by finding what brand of exercise you like and following that. 

If you're snacking/binging that is the real issue. What you eat isn't as important, so don't fear carbs or other foods. What you should focus in on is eating a good mix of foods and staying in your calorie limits."
loseit,fcrsvfu,t3_eijl9f,1577906169.0,"You got this! Here's some ideas/thoughts if you're interested.

Make sure you track calories, if you don't, because that is where your weight loss really happens. You can't outrun a bad diet. A bad diet also could be eating lots of 'healthy' foods. 

It's a lot of peoples hangup as they think it means they can't eat anything. You can still fit in treats, but they must actually be treated as special. 

Lifting is great to look better and build muscle, I would recommend a progressive overload program if you're just starting out and your goal is to really see some gains. It's really hard to grow off of dumbells at home as most people tend to have limited increments to go up by...and while you could just increase volume, you get a lot of benefit from the gym. The gym can also be a short thing, it doesn't always have to be an hour workout.

Walking and biking are great for burning extra calories, just don't 'reward' yourself for being good by eating extra. It will cancel out that work. 

Intermittent fasting is quite nice. It's just a method to save you some calories. This goes back to making sure you are tracking. It's a tool, but the real core of weight loss is the actual calorie intake."
loseit,fcrrp8c,t3_eilyas,1577905713.0,"Don't look at the big picture yet. You do that when you're at the goal and want to see your changes, if you try to make everything a grand scale deal...you'll very easily talk yourself out of it.

To me it felt easier to make each week the biggest my scope was. It helps prevent spiraling for too long too. 

Try to go a whole week without cheat days or cheat meals. You can have things you enjoy, but be strict about hitting your goals. Minimize the ""Well I ruined today so I might as well...""

Once you get things rolling, keep doing it. You can do this. Take it week by week. Keep track of what you're doing and eating. Be honest with yourself.

fatlogic,fcnx2qr,t1_fcnh21g,1577820156.0,"I think the issue is the concept of 'blame'. It's not blame when it comes to weight, it's responsibility.

Not to say it's always ideal with the diet industry, but I also remember an awful lot of nutrition advice from things I purchased. I would do a program like Insanity but gloss over the pdf with all the nutrition advice. I do remember calories being talked about in school, but since it was not overly regular...it was convenient to pretend I didn't need to track it. 

I think we should be responsible and take the 'blame' for our own weights. That's the only way to change and want to learn. That is what led me to a similar change you went through. 

Just shifting the blame is what allows fat logic to prosper in my view. It's fine to recognize that there are hurdles to clear, but ultimately the information is hardly hidden. 

But people like to also have the idea of calories hidden. Lots of programs exist to mask calories or try to play with the concepts because people hate calorie counting, due to some stigma is seems to carry...yet they will do liquid diets, follow bizarre point systems, or do anything except do what works.

So to me the statement in the image is more a shift in responsibility which I think is bad. It's never easy to lose weight, but I don't even feel its fair to say most programs are lies. Some certainly are...but people also tend to ignore you when you talk about calories and reality."
fatlogic,fckm72h,t1_fci5zhy,1577728356.0,"It's kind of cool to see how well it works honestly. I think the easiest way to tell if someone has any clue is to ask they show you what a serving of cereal looks like. 

To me I remember that one stung. A serving of cereal was pathetic looking in the bowl. I was probably eating like 4-5 servings before and starting the day with 500 calories or more down the drain. 500 calories of something that didn't fill me at all. 

Somehow I had never thought those calories really meant anything. I mean 'it's just cereal. I don't even feel full.'

I think part of the message is true, in that we have control over our behaviors more than we do over our literal weight. In a moment to moment sort of way. However our weight is entirely in our control if we adjust those moments and it's 'easy' to influence. It may not be easy to stick to, but if you force yourself to...the change comes."

As a former fat guy, I certainly felt sad about my state. I knew people just saw a doughy fat person who wasn't remotely enticing. Yet that was my own fault. I couldn't hide that I was inactive and yet I still wanted the 'hottest' people around me. Deep down I resented myself and how I appeared. I knew I was losing out on opportunities. I knew I had let myself go and I wanted to feel better.

They start to make everything about being fat if they were like how I was. I hated how clothes never looked good. I hated how I would sweat a lot more and was very self conscious of how I appeared. I hated that I was never looked at or that I looked nothing like the typical 'hot guy'.

I think being healthy is moral for a few reasons. You stack the deck in your favor on surviving. Most likely you won't be a drain on society for health reasons that stem from obesity. You will probably live longer and have less trouble supporting yourself. If you get into an accident you won't hurt people due to your weight on average...

It doesn't mean bad things can't happen. It doesn't mean being obese erases all morality. It's just simply not a good choice. It is also a choice. 

It's not all or nothing. It's simply an aspect of ourselves and one we should be responsible for...but it shouldn't be a weapon. It should just be something we're aware of. That we are responsible. That our health can impact ourselves and others far more than we like to give credit for. 

I don't think there should be controversy at all to that. We can be reasonable. I believe the issue is really that people project too much and feel the need to be 'perfect' when no one is. We all have vices, addictions, and issues. We all should make better choices.

However we won't always. But we shouldn't push others into our same mistakes. I love gaming, but i'm not going to tell other people they should play as much as I do. If I have kids I won't teach them to spend as much time on it as I did as a child. Instead i'll enrich them with other fun activities. While still allowing them to do it. I will try to be better, not bring everyone down to me to be bitter."

Perfect health is not achieved by being mediocre. 

Most people can't have 'perfect' health regardless, but these idiots confuse 'still alive' with 'perfect health' too often. Just because you have okay bloodwork and the doctor shoos you on, it doesn't mean you magically are suddenly phenomenal. 

They are so deluded that they read a doctors appointment with no issue as 'perfect health'. So infatuate with this idea that everyone is going to buy into the absolute bull of 'oh it's all muscle'."
fatlogic,fc159io,t3_ef3z98,1577308639.0,"oh no...someone lost weight...oh nooooo! The narrative of how impossible it is has shattered. Guess we have to demonize any weight loss ever!

Oh and anyone taking responsibility is transferring over eating disorders! Even though eating until you are obese is also a big disorder and food addiction! Oh noooo"
fatlogic,fc14y32,t3_effxjo,1577308383.0,"Ah yes the naturally thin person that, of course, has all of their meals weighed and monitored by their fat friends who eat 'so much less than them!'. 

Naturally when they are away from their heavier friends they go into a state of dormancy and also are sure never to burn a single calorie with exercise or a potentially more active lifestyle. Also height doesn't matter. Also you don't give a crap if they have literally not eaten before that one meal they had with you. You don't actually care about them, you just want to feel better.

Oh and ignore if if there is like half a meal left on the thin persons plate. That is just them being so fatphobic. Oh and make sure you do not count your own calories, the extra thirteen and a half handfuls of healthy snacks like nuts. Slay it, and remember that if you walk once a week you can call it 10 miles and say you regularly go to the gym. Plus it gives you a free 10,000 calories. 

Also if you are overweight and do a pushup, you can basically say you bench pressed your body weight. It's basically the same. Right?

How dare a menu let you know something of key importance. Surely just putting on some ignorance glasses will protect you from absorbing the calories."
teaching,fby75za,t3_eew65v,1577209736.0,"Expand on your mini-lessons. I think it's fine for your first year to just be where you get the mandated stuff out...while you look for your style. Often this means you get lessons of various quality, but this is common.

Teaching is like acting, you need to find your most effective role. You need to figure out how goofy you can be, what extra things you can bring in and so on.

What I do is expand a little each year. Maybe get something cheap to add to the lesson as a visual. I look up recent developments in what we are studying and will even share with them that mistakes are still made by professionals. Basically I try to keep it up to date.

Our school gave us a smart board so I started adding more pictures, and a few videos here and there. I make sure to ask questions. I try to frame it in a way that keeps them focused and at the end I always do a 'please give me a recap' to a random student.,"
fatlogic,fbvc5h2,t3_eemy7s,1577128684.0,"You mean the medical procedure that tries to skip past the healthy choices to have less fat...doesn't confer all the health benefits of being thin and fit? How could that be!

The issue is people think there are shortcuts to health. There are not."
