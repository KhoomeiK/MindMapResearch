BipolarReddit,fffqqci,t3_et0rnt,1579889745.0,"I say that I was diagnosed and being treated for bipolar. 

Not sure why. Maybe a part of me still in denial, but also it explains a lot..."
bipolar,ffe7eog,t3_et38fy,1579838705.0,"I usually don't wanna die. I sometimes even wish I could be immortal like a vampire or something. 

But I do wish I didn't have responsibilities to people. Particularly my kids. I wish I could just bounce out of their lives whenever I wanted without consequence or emotional damage to them. 

I wish I could just ghost my job sometimes and be selfish but then still come back weeks or months later."
bipolar,ffe751p,t3_et40zx,1579838493.0,"My PCP ""caught it"" (I was there for a med check and he started asking some weird questions) But didn't diagnose and instead referred me to a psychiatrist"
menstrualcups,ff9fbpk,t1_ff9e5wf,1579711797.0,I'm 35. And have had a lot of things change that have made me suspect early menopause. But nothing's been officially stated.
menstrualcups,ff8k87t,t1_ff8a3z4,1579682428.0,"Coincidentally, I had an ultrasound done about a month ago and the gal happened to mention I had a tilted uterus. I would've thought the cup would just tilt back with the vaginal canal or something, so it never occurred to me that would be an issue"
menstrualcups,ff7l8lv,t1_ff7h23d,1579652215.0,"You could just need a new cup. I have so many because my period varies enough through each cycle, I've found some are more comfortable while some hold a greater capacity. 

Every cup I have listed has been used successfully in the past which is why I'm confused"
menstrualcups,ff7l216,t1_ff7hf29,1579652088.0,"I know about high and low cervixes... But I mean, I have 4 different cups that are all leaking around it (not overflowing). And all of these have worked perfectly fine before. 

The Lena turned fricken sideways!

How do I try to change the position? I've only ever played with the position of the cup when it's uncomfortable. And it's not uncomfortable. It feels fine."
BipolarReddit,ff6s25d,t1_ff5fk32,1579633697.0,"Because I have gone so many years unknowingly without medication and being fairly well, my Dr and I have a goal to wean off once I'm stable. Which I think we're getting there. In two months it will be a year. 

I'm bipolar 2, which I think is pretty much the only type that can even think about not taking meds, just based on stories I read."
BipolarReddit,ff6rl8p,t3_ernxer,1579633412.0,"My parents recall thinking I was depressed when I was 7 (they called the school for help and that was a joke, I don't blame my parents, they had no idea what to do and I wasn't physically harming myself).

I recall being distinctly depressed when I was like 15-16. And then around 18-21 I think I started having hypomanic symptoms. definitely by 21-23 I was having episodes, I even asked my psychologist about the hallucinations and highs, they ""weren't high enough"".

Diagnosed at 34."
bipolar,feimv3s,t1_fehyi3j,1579142237.0,"I resent having the mother I had and a lot of her behavior was fueled by symptoms of bipolar. 

She never took any responsibility for it though. Never apologized. She always had ""reasons"" for what she did. And she put my sister and I in some dangerous situations because she wanted to fuck a dude. 

Now it's confirmed I have it. And my sister has high anxiety. 

She probably shouldn't have had kids. 

But I guess if nothing else, I've lived what it's like to have a shit parent. And I now understand and know why my mom had the behaviors she did. 

I feel better equipped to parent while managing mental illness than she was and I think that might partly be generational. 

I feel like I'm rambling, but I hope it gets the point across"
witcher,fegq3c5,t1_fegebfn,1579099866.0,So it's meant to be something that comes as a surprise to the person with the debt?
witcher,fegdhsy,t1_fbszbhy,1579088822.0,How is the reward determined? I think that is the confusing part. Especially when both examples in the show are the daughters of the men in debt.
bipolar,feffixk,t3_eotbgu,1579055247.0,"I know some people have commorbid ADHD with bipolar. However, I always thought I must be adhd because f my lack of concentration, occasional (ish) fidgiting, and inability to stay on tasks. But since finding a medication regiment that works fairly well, a lot of that stuff is gone, or at least I'm noticing it's bad when other stuff is bad. 

Just some food for thought"
bipolar,feff8i2,t1_fef9l8b,1579055067.0,"Although, problem for me is when I'm hypomanic or beyond, the effort is there. And I will keep putting in effort until I crash. Then I become the person who never follows through.

Anyway, OP, bounce ideas off of other people. Check in with other symptoms. If you're having other symptoms, don't make any final decisions about it until you're stabile"
Chameleons,fecctv8,t3_englxv,1578970927.0,"We had a lay bin for just in case for like a year before ours did anything. She started by first trying and eventually escaping the cage... Then she was up in the middle of nights. Then the real tell tale was the digging. Once she started digging, we actually put a blanket around 2 sides of  her cage. This meant we could come and go in the room without disturbing her. But the kids and mammals weren't allowed in. 

We peeked in from above. It was probably a week with the blanket up (it took about a full 24 hrs if I recall correctly to actually lay the eggs).

I dunno if we went overboard with the blanket. But that's what we did."
bipolar2,feamder,t1_fe9yies,1578950259.0,"Going by what you just said, I've experienced the melancholy depression in high school and then since being treated for bipolar. And all the other times were mixed states (which I've questioned in the past but up until a year ago was always told 'its just depression')

But that mixed states stuff is like... A description of most of my adult life. No wonder SSRIs never worked for me ... Or what felt like working was actually hypo/mania"
bipolar2,fe88j23,t3_enrslz,1578923720.0,Ok... Then what's depression?
bipolar,fdwsgln,t3_emzeja,1578761944.0,"Found out I was bipolar after 5 years of living together, 4 being pregnant or nursing, a house move and a few months after marrying... I honestly fell in love with him because he seems to be the first-and seemingly only after 30 years- to be able to weather my moods. Now that I'm stable, it's his mental issues that are really and truly coming to light and if it were easy and especially if we didn't have kids, I'd divorce him today. 

Not sure what that says exactly."
crochet,fdwo8qb,t1_fdwh4g0,1578760777.0,I have compression gloves for crochet and Knitters. They help when I have wrist issues due to fibromyalgia flares. The pain I'm describing happens regardless. Unless I hold on to the hook like a handle bar instead of a knife.
crochet,fdwo008,t1_fdwci69,1578760696.0,"It's the pinky side of my hand. And it aches, doesn't go numb"
crochet,fdwnxjl,t1_fdwlgqw,1578760671.0,They are the clover brand that comes with sort of a foam covering. That helped from the general achyness I had way back.
