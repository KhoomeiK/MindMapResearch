FinancialCareers,ffsudmn,t1_ffstyic,1580192839.0,"Thank you so much. The investment fund is based out of several universities, not part of school.

As far as leadership and involvement, I just joined the Business Network club at my school and I’ll try and get a position soon. And I just interviewed for an Impact Investing club that I hope I get into as well. 

I’ll post my resume on this Sub soon, if you want to look at it. I think it has as much quantifiable data as possible, like a lot of it was just due diligence and boring stuff. I had it reviewed by a “professional resume reviewer” online and she suggested the same thing (more active verbs and numbers ) but I already have as much as I can. 

I appreciate all your advice."

Expect to answer some questions about your future, eg where you see yourself in 10 years, or what have you. And why USC would be the best choice for you if accepted. Also, questions related to your application: why you chose that major, what you’re passionate about, etc.

The majority of Jeff Bezos’ wealth lies in stock in Amazon. If he converted his stock to cash, the stock price would dip drastically and he would lose a lot of “net worth”. And he also can’t do that because they need huge amounts of funds to operate the company."

suggestmeabook,ffhe1ul,t3_etl017,1579931459.0,"My favorite alternates. It’s between East of Eden by Steinbeck, Lolita by Nabokov, and Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy. 

East of Eden is an immersive story that made me incredibly involved in the characters’ lives. It was pretty long tho.

Lolita is beautifully written but has a reprehensible subject matter (it’s about a guy basically kidnapping a girl and traveling across the country). But his writing style is insanely beautiful. 

Blood Meridian is a simple subject matter (basically like a Wild West), and written with pretty simple syntax, but still very immersive and engaging."

Anyways, my biggest tip for science is don’t look at the graphs first: just read the questions and find the answers straight from the graphs. I always say science is like another reading section. It’s the dumbest one honestly.

FinancialCareers,ff3nc8r,t1_ff2q8we,1579544736.0,Honestly it’s probably similar to networking for regular finance. Cold emails or LinkedIn messages to alums/second degree connections at firms you’re interested in. And then getting coffee and sending a quick note afterwards thanking them
