My Warlock with Mask of Many Faces killed her. She was a part of a certain organization.

They could have said that ""An Orc-looking woman who we hired for this job from the \[Organization\] killed her and ran off""

It's the truth. She looked like an Orc, she was hired, and she was a part of the organization that is now fractured into different sects and ran off.

The Wizard studies. Reads. Understands. Tests. They reach their achievements through fully immersing themselves in their texts, much like how a student pursues his degree. 

A Sorcerer goes through muscle memory. They're the jocks of magic. They may have the genetic lottery or fucking whatever that makes them naturally inclined towards their field, but in the end, if they don't work towards it, practice it, it doesn't really go anywhere. They go about magic the way a star player goes about sports, through physical training, trial and error and practice. You can't become the best soccer player by reading, nor can you become the best Sorcerer.

It's just coincidence that you can achieve a similar end point as wizards.

Honestly, imo, I feel like Sorcerers need some form of overhaul when WotC gets around to releasing a 6e or whatever, something to truly set them apart from wizards.
