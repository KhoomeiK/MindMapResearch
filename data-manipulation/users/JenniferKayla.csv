It just doesn’t look natural. Beautiful photo, beautiful colors, and I’m sure the original look was fine, but definitely photoshopped."

depression,ffeepnx,t3_et5aar,1579845218.0,"I was just explaining this to my friends. When I start to get in the lows of depression, the first thing I start to neglect is my teeth. I don’t brush my teeth or my hair. Lately I’ve been really good keeping on top of both, even if it’s the only thing I accomplish that day."

shittytattoos,ffbdxye,t3_erin4r,1579761215.0,"Oh god. The eyes, the ears, the fact that the number of dotted lines aren’t even the same amount on each side. This looks like someone tried to copy someone else’s work and horribly fucked it up. 
The longer you look at it the worse it gets."

Instagramreality,ff58dfq,t3_eron7r,1579583258.0,"So. Much. Glow. I never understood why people make the whites of the eyes SO white, it’s such an unnatural look."
Instagramreality,fem1wix,t3_ep46wi,1579237066.0,"What do you mean by these aren’t [natural eyes ](https://imgur.com/gallery/TVIFXAX) ? Aren’t everyone’s eyes vividly white with squiggly shaped eyelids?

Edit: just noticed half of the right eye is totally missing lol wtf"
Instagramreality,fem0xu9,t3_epmdvc,1579236215.0,The longer I look at this one the worse it gets. Are the nails photoshopped too? Why is the pinky nail soooo much longer than the the other as?
depression,felwldv,t3_epm2ch,1579232754.0,"Clearly he never truly loved you. You don’t do that to someone you’re about to marry. Wtf. I agree with everyone in this thread, you deserve better than that and you’re gonna be much better off without him."
