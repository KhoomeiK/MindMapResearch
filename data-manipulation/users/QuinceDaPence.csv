Long answer:

So I'm on the Gulf Coast and that has a major effect on sort of averaging our temperatures (if you get away from the coast the daily temperature range is a lot wider) but generally days in the summer will be highs 85-105F and the lowest it usually gets in the summer being 79F just before sunrise.  Then in the winter, for the most part it's just mild temps (today for example it was a high of ~68F I think but last night it got down to 43F) but we do usually get a couple weeks with highs in the upper 30s.




It doesn't really get that cold on it's own though, it takes a cold front or an arctic blast.

Call #3: guy named Daniel who handled my call very well and efficiently, this time Lenovo paid for shipping since it was their screw up, and I believe also put a priority on it.  Finally fixed the issue.

progun,fdxv727,t1_fdngiez,1578773253.0,"> If you can't realize and admit gun is complicated than you shouldnt have a gun. You specifically shouldn't have a gun based on your comment imo, youre a liability if you think a pistol is a simple device.

Me having a different threshold for what ""complicated"" is means I don't know how to safely handle a firearm?  Me having the understanding that a firearm isn't some magic or crazy complex scifi device, and understanding that the innerworkings are fairly simple especially when compared with everyday things like computers, vehicles etc. means I am a liability?

> and none of this backwater 



>pipe shotgun your talking about, why bring up an unregulated

They are regulated to the same degree all other firearms are regulated except for only requiring a serial number if you want to sell it, which I believe you can request one from the ATF but I'd have to look into it more

>illegal

Not illegal, you can make your own guns in all but a few states

>and dangerous thing you made yourself

It's not that much more dangerous than any others, even then the only real danger is to the shooter.  If somebody want's to do something that's only dangerous to themselves who am I or you to stop them.  If we're gonna ban things that are dangerous to the person who's doing it there's going to he a lot of pissed off rock climbers, sky divers, motorcyclists etc.
