This is part of the risk management process.  

The first step in this process is to *identify the hazards* of whatever you're doing/planning.  

The second step is to *ASSESS each hazard*...  This post/comic is how you assess each hazard.  It's a small ""snippet"" of the overall concept... Often there's numbers involved.  How likely is it on a scale of 1-10 for this hazard to show up? How bad would it be on a scale of 1-10?  Get a low number, it's a low/low and who cares, get a high number it's a high/high and we gotta do something about it.  Using low/low, low/high, etc is easier, but then you need comics to try and convey what they mean.

The third step is to mitigate (control, reduce) the highest risks.

The last step is to monitor and/or enforce the mitigation measures (where's your hearing protector?)

The comic has no direct relation to risks, risk management, deciding to take on a job or not, success or failure, how dangerous something is or isn't...

Im aware that you're laser focused on ""just the numbers"", because you got your little narrative and don't care about any other opinions.  I get it.  This is the third time saying I understand that...  Your ""akshually math"" is correct.  I said that already too.  I'm just saying that statistics are funny things and maybe the ""raw numbers ONLY"" approach might not be the only way to interpret ""a lot of the 14%""...

See what I mean?  I'm twisting the crap out of your statement in a horrible way there, not because you're wrong, or bad, or whatever, but because what you're doing with your math is very ""limiting"" statistically, and *I personally think* (NOT I demand you think, I'm not a Democrat) it's not conducive to having a ""libertarian"" discussion...

I also clarified that I wasnt discounting the ethnicity and was counting all of them as white (which changes the numbers in favor of your ""spin"", because I'm weird like that).

""A gun owner is 8 times as likely to be white"", and ""a black person is more likely to be a gun owner"" are two entirely different metrics...  *That* was my entire point.  I'm not saying your result is incorrect (I specifically said I understand that you're saying a different thing), I'm saying your point isn't directly opposed to what the other person *may have meant*...

The survey doesn't reflect households, but it's respondents discussed households.  I ignored that... I'm only using the individuals, actual owners. I added Hispanics to whites to get 51% of gun owners being white (with an ignored additional metric saying they have one in their household).  That's not 50% of the population, it's 50% of the people who owned guns *and answered the survey* (more wonkiness added).

24% of the people who say ""I got a gun"" were black.  That's 14% (or 12.7, if you prefer...) Of the overall population  owning 24% of the guns.  That's twice the likelihood of the 60% owning 50% roughly... 

Not trying to ""akshually"" anything here, and not trying to say that anything you're saying is factually wrong, just saying that there's more than one way to skin a cat, and the other person may have been thinking more in per capita terms than in plain numbers of customers.  

You're right, but the guy you're saying wrong can also be right at the same time...  Statistics are funny that way, and it's kinda part of my ""libertarianist"" philosophy to not get married to a specific interpretation...

I think your math is goofy, because a gun is only 3 times as likely to be owned by a white guy using these numbers, but that really is some ""akshually"" shit and doesn't really change your point at all, so I don't really care ;)"
Libertarian,fdmj0e7,t1_fdm96kr,1578551658.0,"Half is a ""vast majority""?  (Unless you count Hispanics as white?  Every single Hispanic gun owner could be black... Fucking demographics like this are fucked, because Hispanic is both blacks and whites... It's not a race it's an *ethnicity*, and that makes this stuff kinda wonky...)

Let's go with *all* the Hispanics being ""white"" Hispanic, just cause why not...  Two things-

Black gun owners are 1/3 of the ""customers"" in your context.  You don't ignore a full third of your customer base...  That simply can't be good business...

Lastly, and I understand the ""well technically"" spin you went with, but in that source, the 14% of the population that's black owns 32% of the guns.  That makes it more likely for a black person to own a gun, and the white guys trending toward multiple guns actually increases the likelihood...  

I can't speak to the intent of the person you replied to, but it kinda sounds like they were more in the per capita context than wholesale numbers.

You got better odds of selling a gun via retailer to a white guy I suppose, and a white guy is probably much more likely to buy the shit that's far more profitable to manufacturers (the multi gun guys that dig the ""collector"" type crap, which I agree is probably where the money is if you manufacture guns), and from a place that profits manufacturers (no profit for manufacturers from a pawn shop or the trunk of a car I suppose), but white kids buy guns at pawn shops too (all of mine, for example), and anecdotally, the only white guy I know of who bought a gun retail is my grandfather, and that purchase was at monkey wards about 95 years ago...

Personally, I think the NRA bias is just the dying vestiges of the whole ""good ol boy"" deal.

If we drive a half hour south, into the Craig mountain wilderness, it is incredibly dark, and the sky out there is even better.  There's no flare on the horizon, and the sky looks like it's lit up compared to the horizon, sorta like a TV that's on a black screen... lit, but dark... The milky way is an odd red/purple band that's really hard to explain.  You can see it clearly, but you can't see it directly...  a pair of binoculars will show you that it's all a little denser than it looks, and a telescope will show that a lot of the ""points of light"" aren't actually points at all :)
