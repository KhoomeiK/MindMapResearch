memes,ffjmfgz,t1_ffiagmw,1580001619.0,"It’s not a huge stretch or some vague “finance”. I teach Financial Mathematics and one of its most basic course is Matrix Algebra. Unless your goal is to understand a brief glimpse of Finance, there is no option but to understand Matrix Algebra, which is the backbone of practical Finance. Many times students use Pythagora’s theorem without knowing it. The theorem is hidden within many math formulas and corollaries. Understanding Pythagorean’s logic leads to a much deeper and larger understanding of Finance, not only on a theoretical level, but mostly in real life situations."
StrongCurves,ffiwev6,t3_etqoln,1579984341.0,"I have cystic fibrosis now living with a double-lung transplant for the last 10 years. I’ve been lifting weights since I was 18 (now I’m M51) despite regular hospital stays. My main advice to you is to see weight training as a long-term venture. Don’t define yourself by the highest weight you once lifted, define yourself by your capacity to stay calm and positive in the face of difficulties. There’s really no reason to believe you shouldn’t be able to lift again the same amount of weights you used to do. The question is more how much time will pass before this happens. So here you have now to understand my second advice, maybe the most important one. I’ve learned that one from my double-lung transplant journey. Life isn’t a race, weight training isn’t a race. Don’t rush back into the gym with stubborn expectations at the risk of injuring yourself. Start easy and focus on what you’re still able to do. Light cardio such as walking on a treadmill machine is a good idea. Get good nutrition and good amount of sleep. Your body and mind is a fantastic machine when you give it proper care. Weight training has saved my life many times yet, a good muscle and bone density is your best ally, this is the only truth you need to know. Keep smiling and lifting."

memes,ffib83e,t3_etp86m,1579969725.0,"Pythagora’s theorem is everywhere in about every field of human activity. It’s at the core of Linear Algebra and computer science. In fact Math is the universal language for logic, a single language for all nations no matter who. To pretend learning Pythagora’s theorem is useless is to reveal an utmost level of ignorance."
memes,ffi954g,t1_ffi6u1w,1579968280.0,"Pythagoras’ theorem is at the core of all Vectors and Matrices which is part of Linear Algebra in Finite Mathematics.

It is actually an extraordinary powerful tool in the history of humanity."
