It only takes one bad experience to make a a dog, especially a puppy, fearful. 
It’s also like a wild frat party, who likes going to wild frat parties? 20 year olds. Not a place for babies or adults. 

Dog parks are frequented by adolescent dogs who don’t always behave the best. Not the best spot for babies and a spot where adult dogs are over it"
dogs,fffgnx8,t1_fffg1pm,1579883554.0,"No, kennel cough isn’t a pre-existing conditioning. Since that’s a curable illness- if he had it when you first got insurance it wouldn’t be covered, but if he was given a clean bill of health and contracted it again- it would be covered. 

But if the slight limp turned out to be a bad elbow, that they thought was some soreness, that could consider that a pre-existing condition (or at least up for some debate depending on what diagnostic testing your vet did at the time)"

roughcollies,ff4s2lc,t1_ff4kcue,1579571086.0,I imagine that OP would’ve had to be dishonest or had to get them from not reputable breeders. Reputable breeders don’t give people puppies when they already have plans to get/or already have another puppy so young.

dogs,fefe95i,t3_eovlm2,1579054456.0,"A lot of breeders litter train their puppies. It’s a lot easier, more sanitary, and makes house training easier. 

I, personally, don’t like litter training my puppies once they come home from the breeder. Why? Because I have access to my fenced in backyard and I find it easier to teach a puppy to always just go outside to go potty rather it’s okay to go in multiple spots."
dogs,fedqqnw,t3_eon22w,1579017848.0,"So good news the weaning process has started. By week 5 or 6 mom weaning will be completed and mom will be pretty much out of the picture, for the most part humans, usually, don’t have to do much. You’ll notice that mom will start to stay away more and nursing periods will get shorter and shorter 

Are you soaking the kibble to make it a gruel like substance so it’s easier for he puppies to eat? If not, you should start doing that- you’ll be able to stop doing that quickly, but this is a good way to get them on solids. 

Be sure to keep the puppies with each other until at least 8 weeks old. They learn so much from each other, that even though they don’t need mom- they need each other until that age at minimum."

puppy101,fec5vbb,t3_eoe5v6,1578967136.0,"I guess I’m confused on your question. You’re asking what kind of puppy you should get (energy/temperament/personality). No one here can answer that for you because we don’t know you. 

Only you can answer that and that’s something you and the breeder should’ve talked about beforehand. What if you describe what you want and there’s not a suitable male in the litter? Are you willing to wait? You should be. 

I’m in the process of getting my next puppy. I talked to my breeder and described what I wanted before she even had the breeding planned. She just emailed me a week ago and confirmed she had a puppy on the ground that matched what I was looking for. Otherwise, I would’ve not been getting a puppy from this litter. But again, my breeder isn’t in it for monetary gain and there’s a pretty good chance yours is since they’re a doodle breeder. Doodle breeders are great at saying what the costumer wants to hear."

So it’s not that your dog is aggressive it’s the fact that your dog is shy and hasn’t had any socialization (which technically that window has passed, its concerned something else past 16 weeks old). 

That’s why people are recommending what they are and why they are telling you the truth of where your dog came from. You need to have your eyes open in this situation."

2. Do you have the finances to take care of a puppy? Puppy shots, training, emergencies, etc?

roughcollies,fdpoxhz,t1_fdpob35,1578635087.0,Littermate syndrome can happen with any two dogs under a year old. It is serious and cause some serious behavioral issues that can be nearly impossible to correct (if not impossible).

dogs,fdoa5b6,t3_emf5e4,1578601520.0,"So hip dysplasia is, mainly, a thing that large breed dogs are prone to it can be expensive to treat/maintain depending on the severity level of it. 

Most insurances won’t cover or have it as an add on. Most, like healthy paws, won’t cover it if you’re enrolling your pet after a certain age. They almost all have a long wait period too, I believe healthy paws has a 12 month wait period on hip dysplasia. 

All this is because it is expensive to treat and somewhat common in large breed dogs. Insurance companies don’t want people with large breed senior dogs jumping on the insurance band wagon to have it covered when they haven’t had any sort of “pay off” if that makes sense. 

Now you have a 25lb dog, the chance of your dog having hip dysplasia is very low. Hip dysplasia is something that your dog would already have- believe it or not- but if they’re show symptoms or not is the bigger thing! 

Hip dysplasia is the abnormal formation of the hip socket- it causes lameness and arthritis in the joint. So it’s not something they suddenly “get” it’s usually something that has genetic and environmental components as they are growing."

Honestly I find having one dog 10 times easier than having two dogs. While they may entertain each other at times, you’re often playing the referee at that point- until you know they know boundaries of each other.

My suggestion, if you can’t dedicate that much time to exercise/mental stimulation due to your new work schedule- don’t get another dog. Get a dog walker. It’ll be cheaper"
dogs,fdl4zk2,t1_fdl4l73,1578517134.0,"Okay, great. Go to a shelter/rescue and have them help pick out a nice adult dog for you. Not some rando. 

After dealing with people rehoming dogs I’ve learned one thing: people will say whatever they need to to get rid of their dog. 

But my point stands. Never let a 6 year old handle a leash alone and I’ll be bluntly honest. Don’t get a dog until you’re able to pay for at least two training classes."
dogs,fdl460b,t1_fdl3vjv,1578516743.0,"The issue is you don’t know if it is from a breeder. You don’t know anything besides an elderly woman needs to rehome since the dogs too much for her.

dogs,fdl32gf,t1_fdl25lr,1578516216.0,"But it could do with you if you take a dog the breeder finds out, and then wants their dog back. Which is legally their dog at that point. Also look at it from the breeders point of view. 

The breeder bred their dog. Spent countless hours with the puppy, carefully placed it into what they hoped would be a forever home. But had that clause in there contract because they want to make sure their dog never ends up in the wrong hands/shelter. They deserve to know that the dog that they bred/raised isn’t where they placed anymore. They have that clause so they know where their dog is."
dogs,fdl1xwo,t1_fdkyu87,1578515646.0,"If the elderly woman got the dog from a reputable breeder it should be going back to the breeder- not you. Or at the very least the breeder should be informed and give the green light for you to adopt the dog.

You’ve only had this dog for 6 months which isn’t a long time at all! 

If you do rehome this dog I would highly suggest not getting another dog as these are normal issues. More than that another dog could have other normal issues that you don’t/can’t deal with. Are you going to cycle through dogs? That’s just wrong. 

Commit to a dog and actually work with them. 

Take this dog to a positive based trainer and take a minimum of two 6 week group classes.
