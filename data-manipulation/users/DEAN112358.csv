dontyouknowwhoiam,ff7io66,t1_ff6q3rs,1579650452.0,Honestly that’s the thing. It’s one thing to have your beliefs (even if they’re wrong) but to actively endanger everyone around you because of your beliefs is fucked up. Some might even say unconstitutional

ChoosingBeggars,fev9pyh,t1_fev6y51,1579394831.0,In America (at least at Walmart where I buy diapers) each brand has their own price and then the bigger sizes just have less per pack.
