facepalm,ff3juob,t1_ff3cri1,1579542587.0,"Not true. 

Mass shootings are most often caused by the shooter using a gun that belongs to a family member."
facepalm,ff3js1s,t1_ff3h63e,1579542544.0,"That’s correct in situations where you’re buying and selling online. 

100 percent true. Technically I can have a truly 100 percent private sale between two people if neither of us are gun dealers and we both have reasonable knoweledge that the other isn’t excluded from gun ownership. Like if I buy a pistol from my uncle."

facepalm,ff3b3ev,t1_ff3akhn,1579537715.0,Nope. You can’t. The law states that you cannot sell to anyone that you believe is not allowed to own a gun. So there.

facepalm,ff39ocg,t1_ff39g0a,1579536956.0,"Those laws are already on the books. The problem is that the government can’t manage their own system. Multiple govt agencies have failed in providing their updated lists of people that should be excluded from gun purchases. So those people have been able to buy them. Also the govt refuses to prosecute people that fail the background check process. 

So there is systemic failure by the govt to manage their own system. So please tell me how more laws will help?"
facepalm,ff39ari,t1_ff393mc,1579536716.0,"Blacks are much more impacted by gun crime than whites. Black in black violence is a huge issue and if you remove the protection of the second amendment from them they are in a bigger problem. The police don’t care about addressing black on black crime. So who does?  The local residents. How can they feel safe and protect their families and property?  With guns. 

We are punishing blacks more heavily than whites by removing 2nd amendment protection. 

But hey what do I know. I’m just a racist piece of shit gun nut."
facepalm,ff3938h,t1_ff38ww4,1579536580.0,"As a supporter of gun rights for all I fine you assertion to be bullshit.
