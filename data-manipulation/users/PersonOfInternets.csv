AskBernieSupporters,fh054cq,t3_f0x2l3,1581200529.0,"First, his policies are about transforming us into a country where people aren't desperate. Right now, drug addicts are wandering the streets, people can't pay their rent or are going bankrupt from illness. Desperation breeds crime and violence, we want to change that dynamic. If they have children, what kind of world do they want them to grow up in?

Healthcare is a pretty easy one. It frees employers of the obligation to provide it and it frees people from relying on their employer for their very life and that of their family. This allow people to take chances, start businesses, go to school to advance their career, etc. Obviously we believe it's just basic common sense that healthcare should be available to every human being, especially in advanced nations, but the above is the argument for republican types who may lack compassion.

And as for school, the economy is made up of all of us. Well educated people means a stronger economy and one that will keep pace with the rest of the world. Other countries that provide free college are beating us because we are left to fend for ourselves and go deep into debt if we want to advance. That is wasted human capital.

We believe in personal responsibility, but millenials are drowning in debt from decisions they made starting at 17 or 18 years old. Higher education is absurdly expensive compared to other places and it makes it not worth it for many people and leaves many others in a debt trap for most of their lives. Again, wasted human capital. If we are to remain the strongest nation, we need to catch up and start making sure every single one of us reaches their potential."

To me, this show is one where people like you and I are teleported to the 1800s (or w/e not good at history) and experience that shit. Then it makes me realize ""Wow, the people who lived back then *were* us."" Genetically I mean, there were people with personality traits just like people you know, archetypes, social dynamics like today. I don't know, I always think of them as something other than us, but this show makes me think about actually living in the past.

I know this all sounds stupid. It's not like I've never had these revelations before, this show just really makes me feel it.

...So anyway what I wanted to say before I went off on that stoner tangent is just that this show feels like if modern people lived in the olden times. I really like this show."
