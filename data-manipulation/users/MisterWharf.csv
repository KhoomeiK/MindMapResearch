MST3K,ffi06oy,t1_ffhyn3q,1579961021.0,No way! The only thing that offends me about it is the fact that Zapp *Action*sdower isn't as widely known about as he deserves to be.
AskReddit,ffgeexh,t1_ffge3gk,1579904386.0,You're quite correct. I was just throwing out some self deprecating humour.
AskReddit,ffgci54,t1_ffgb137,1579903195.0,"I think that's a great way of putting it. Men bond over doing things. I've had (and lost) no small amount of friends because they get in a relationship and if they are out, they're getting bombarded with messages from their SO, or they've been made to feel guilty before they even go out and are miserable. Eventually, they just stop going out because it's easier than having to deal with a woman scorned, and eventually we lose touch because a texting relationship just isn't the same.

Either that or they really just didn't like me in the first place, and I'm just envious because I'm single. Who knows?"

offmychest,ffg5e2k,t3_etbedh,1579898822.0,"My mom died three days after my 16th birthday, so I have some idea what you're going through. I urge you to go to the funeral - as others have mentioned, it's a way to get closure, and be there for the rest of your family, as they surely want to be there for you.

Best thing I can say is, no emotion you feel is bad. Definitely not sadness, but I feel a lot of people don't talk about how it's also okay to laugh, or smile. You don't need to feel guilty if you aren't crying all the time. But don't push that away too. I think it was nearly three years after she died before I really cried again. I had school, and other stuff to worry about. 

And I know it's almost cliche to say, but it just takes time. You'll never get over it - you're wounded, emotionally, in the soul. Just like if your skin is cut, it will heal, but there will always be a scar."
