Thanks."

AMCsAList,ffagazo,t1_ffa40i1,1579735073.0,No doubt my locals are going full 1917 for the week.  Very silly if you ask me.  IMAX remains bad boys though.  More seats comparable price so I kinda understand why but I haven't seen bad boys yet so wanted the dolby.
AMCsAList,ff9pgmn,t3_esdung,1579718004.0,Works for me.  Android.
worldnews,ff6y3bu,t1_ff5rfve,1579637261.0,Hey check out the Nightingale on Hulu I think right now.  Mangana will be remembered.
penguins,ff3eqil,t1_ff3bmn8,1579539572.0,Lol this guy suburbs.  Stay home please.  An hour in traffic in Pittsburgh?  Your first time in the city or something?  Only way it can take an hour is if you constantly make wrong turns.
AMCsAList,feo63md,t1_fenl3nz,1579295606.0,Lol I miss the endless endgame threads asking which format this one specific person should see it in.
TrueFilm,fenxc02,t3_eq26hk,1579292163.0,"I remember in the halcyon days of Netflix getting this one in the mail.  Great coming of age tale, at the time myself and my friends had just started to get into the very British ska ala judge dread or prince buster and just wanted more of that.  Got a bit more than we bargained for as the movies climax does leave you a bit shaken.

Even as a yank it still seemed more plausible than say an american history x is, as that movie is kind of silly if you look back on it with fresh eyes not caked in nostalgia."
booklists,fenuvbu,t3_eq4oqu,1579291194.0,The fifth season books are so damn good.  The first one is by far the best but they keep getting interesting up until the end.  Solid tidy little ending as well.
NHLStreams,fen3ddm,t3_epzc9r,1579276071.0,"Rip you glorious bastards.

See you on the high seas."
pittsburgh,fekkfz7,t1_feke4px,1579201912.0,Bella note as well.
offmychest,fehsi13,t1_fege5bj,1579122995.0,"They are ready for one just not with you.  And that's okay.  Relationships are hard some people think it's gotta be perfect from the get go.  Rarely is.

Head up shoulders back bud.  Something'll shake loose."
frugalmalefashion,feen2iq,t1_fedykiq,1579037086.0,What's your size in other jackets and suit jacket size.  Gimme deets bro.
offmychest,fdrpbhk,t3_emtutt,1578687689.0,I don't get this and I'm not trying to be mean.  How do you not meet people in the real world almost exclusively?  Are you living in a shit hole town?  At a woman's only commune/retreat (or perhaps you are also male and in a not very friendly gay area)?  How are so many people meeting online and thinking this could be romantic?
AMCsAList,fdqmhg1,t1_fdqji1a,1578670169.0,"Yea I mean I have a sliding scale for video game movies myself but this looks like absolute trash.  This subreddit loves stanning for awful movies though, both before and after release."
scifi,fdnpt3w,t1_fdnmei3,1578590582.0,"I think the movie improved on the short story.  But agreed he is rarely mentioned when it's brought up.

Top ten movie of the decade for me."
offmychest,fdngh2b,t1_fdl6l4q,1578585292.0,"Yea as a guy with some forever alone friends... I do apologize.  I just can't get it into their heads cat calls and being extremely forward are things very few if any women really enjoy.

They will remain forever alone and angry about it but they refuse to be pragmatic.  I can only apologize to people and tell them to move on when they do these things to embarrass themselves and to a lesser extent me."
AMCsAList,fdn7fte,t3_em04af,1578579346.0,"With the streaming wars upon the consumer now, piracy has been a greater focus in my regular life as a result.  I have found multiple avenues to watch any movie I want really, minus some special circumstances.  

If they do increase the price again I will most certainly consider dumping a list. I do believe Dolby is 100% worth it but outside those 3/4 movies a month it would be hard to justify."
news,fdkekbu,t1_fdk1pv6,1578502203.0,"This isn't interesting at all.  Why would she refuse?  Just to be a hardass?  Even if she had a fun on her hip or under the counter.  Just give the money up.  Clearly means more to the robber than it does to the employee.

Again. This is not interesting.  Everyone is taught to give them eveythting they want.  It's easy to replace money."

gifs,fdhwmtu,t1_fdhpa0e,1578431487.0,Is there any way to send money?  I feel helpless but I want to contribute if I can.  And looks like these are good folks as any.
nba,fdehd34,t1_fde0wxt,1578339049.0,"Which is insane.  Every member of the rockets subreddit loved playing against him because he is so inefficient and can be tricked so easily into hero ball and single handedly will cost the team games (already has).  

I get it you gotta support the team but fuck.  I'm at my wit's end. I can't watch this team in close games.  It's too obvious what is coming."
nba,fdeh6qs,t1_fddye8h,1578338942.0,"Gotta sit him if the game is close to end.

Not saying the rockets were gonna win with him but holy shit with real defenses him and the beard gonna get rocked in the playoffs.  Gotta blow this team up.  Cp3 wasfar and away a better player but alas, guess he couldn't get along."

AMCsAList,fcnf1t0,t3_ei4aln,1577810393.0,8 dollar movies?  Jesus.  Hello middle America.
booklists,fcn1t78,t3_ehyun7,1577800838.0,Always surprises me when I read a list like this and have no overlap in my own reading.  I read a lot.  More than most people in my life but I still top out around 20/25 books a year.   My library list has grown to well over 200 total books.  It's daunting looking at to be honest.  200 books at this rate is over a decade.  And if I have a child or maybe adopt a puppy that shits gonna get sliced down to even smaller.

movies,fc9wwi9,t1_fc9cwt1,1577559401.0,They say he tried one last time with Valkyrie but it didn't all click and he's gone full genre actor since.  And I'd say we're better off for it.

offmychest,fc3d59w,t3_eftlkn,1577387165.0,"Someone's extra sensitive.  And no... It really isn't the same at all, but I feel for you that youre uncomfortable about it.  But don't equate it to being the same.  A false equivalency won't give you more validation.  I'm sure you're just taking family comments harsher because well everyone does, your mom can say the same thing some stranger says on the bus but it makes you infinitely more angry.

Let's all work toward accepting the things we can't change about ourselves as well as our loved ones."
