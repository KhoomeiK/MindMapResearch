1. I assumed like OP they mounted it to the wall not a cart. But if the goal was a portable WAP with retractable cable attached to the cart then ok, but...
2. How big is your WAP that it needs a cart? We have some that were built into a mount and they just plug into the outlet and stay on the wall. They are small enough to carry in your hand (almost pocket)."

Current modern feminism would state that feminism is intersectional or not true feminism. 

I was responding to the use of the word ""rights"" and the statement that feminists don't ""fight for the rights of men"". I was just curious what right that was they should fight for.

As far as circumcision goes... talk to your parents."

facepalm,fdz32d4,t1_fdyzeun,1578786178.0,"So you agree that egalitarianism would fight for communism?

As far as feminism goes, which men's rights would you like them to fight for that men don't have? Most civil rights movements especially in the US are fighting for their demographic to have the rights that have always been deemed unalienable for wealthy white men.

This is why people talk about ""black lives matter"" because no one has suggested that white lives don't matter.  Similarly,  no one needs to fight for ""men's rights"" because no one has ever suggested men shouldn't have those rights."

facepalm,fdlvzlz,t1_fdlhic7,1578533828.0,No.  I think egalitarianism means all people should be treated as equals.  That is in fact the definition of communism. Communists believe that all people should be treated equally financially and economically. Capitalism views differing types of labor and people as deserving more or less resources in return for their effort.
facepalm,fdl23gx,t1_fdkmhr8,1578515729.0,Egalitarianism is not specific to gender. It would include communism and many other things people might not want to adopt.

I can reference wikipedia too. Also, what he is pulling out is not the cooking oil. It is the fat from the meat that has liquified at higher temperature and then congeals on the ice."
blackmagicfuckery,fcovrep,t1_fcovggc,1577842908.0,Incorrect... both fats and oils are lipids. Fats are solid at room temperature and oils are liquid at room temperature.
