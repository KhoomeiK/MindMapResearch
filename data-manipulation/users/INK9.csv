aww,ffdhwle,t3_esoq0i,1579821218.0,"Okay, so he got  his Master's degree, but did she get one too?"
aww,ffdh7gd,t1_ffcv2r7,1579820796.0,"Schnoodle, I love your poems so much. Have you ever written them for shelters for adoptable dogs and cats? I think it would increase adoptions  significantly. You really find the heart and soul in each of them."
aww,ffdg17n,t3_esr5jx,1579820106.0,"They must be extremely expensive, but man, I'd love a dog that little."
aww,ffdeydp,t3_estyvs,1579819459.0,Oh man! Those paws!
aww,ffdenyv,t1_ffcnx21,1579819284.0,"Yes! He would then be perfect and his person (can't say owner,cause that would be a lie), would be in even deeper debt to his total cuteness. Do it anyway."
aww,ff414dv,t1_ff3qwk1,1579553264.0,"Yup, very Ron Swanson. Probably never tells anyone where he actually lives."
aww,ff3zrli,t1_ff3matj,1579552420.0,"My dog always wants what we're eating, but he's pretty polite about. Not to say he won't sneak something now and then. I once caught him taking a crock of French onion soup off the counter. I just watched as he took the handle of the  crock in his mouth and gently lowered it to the floor without spilling a drop. I didn't let him eat it, but gave him some cheese off the top for his trouble."
aww,feoqd2r,t1_fenpfze,1579303909.0,"True. We also never confuse ""don"" and ""dawn"". Two entirely different sounds. Lookin' at you Midwest."
cats,feopzx4,t1_femr8d4,1579303791.0,I think some dogs like it as well. My old (14) year old dog loves to lie with his back against the baseboard heaters. When I pull his bed away he just gives me a look and drags it right back.
aww,feoowz5,t1_feoissd,1579303296.0,"For some reason that struck me very funny. I'd get up and down from a chair just to hear it. Of course only funny if it's someone else's dog, and not living with me."
aww,feoop72,t3_eq0i3k,1579303188.0,Mom looks a bit alarmed at whatever is going on with her pup. Suspicious as well.
aww,feooahm,t1_fen5l2w,1579302951.0,"My husband also traveled a lot for business when our kids were little. Their favorite things were ""amenities"" from hotels, such as little soaps, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. My children are all adults now, but they stock up on the amenities when they travel. Family tradition doncha know."
aww,feon6e6,t1_feoireg,1579302529.0,"Gonna buy it for my daughter's three cats. They're all young. One's a Ginger, one's Tuxedo and the third one is a Bengal. I want video of them when she gives it to them. I suspect the Bengal will be somewhere on the ceiling."
AnimalTextGifs,feomkig,t3_epi8b8,1579302215.0,"Okay, that was the funniest thing I've seen in several months! Those two are the best. I'm going to try this with my dog just for my own entertainment."
aww,fehya48,t3_ep3shu,1579126292.0,Love the shot of the back of the dog's head. He looks like my guy when he was younger. Same color almost too.  What breed or mix is he? He's a beauty.
aww,fef5001,t1_feex5fv,1579048317.0,"Genius! I'd buy one but first I'd have to get a dog that doesn't like to go on walks. My current one literally drags me down the stairs to get outside. No dusting for him, unfortunately."
aww,fef4rm7,t3_eoqz19,1579048159.0,what a face! I know she's planning something though. A real beauty.
aww,fef2m58,t1_feee0t6,1579046711.0,It sure is. A family member of mine found out he was adopted after his father died. He was in his thirties and it was very difficult for him.
aww,fef26av,t3_eopx3w,1579046416.0,"Never thought I'd upvote a bat, but that is adorable!"
aww,febcg0d,t1_febbx4k,1578957455.0,"I would buy bunch of them to give to all my pet loving friends. Please Schnoodle, publish!"
aww,febapl8,t1_fea80ex,1578956985.0,"Same. When my brother and I were three and four, he was the dog (Arfy), and I was the cat (Whitey). If I wanted to be the dog he told me I couldn't because girls were cats and boys were dogs. I believed him then, and still do."
aww,fe5ejqf,t1_fe529y3,1578868433.0,"Vets can estimate based on teeth. My dog is a rescue, vet said he was about one year when we got him. He's turning 14 this year. A very good boy."
DrainTheSwamp,fd5o9p5,t1_fd5i04w,1578179614.0,"It gets even better, (worse actually), here in NJ. ICE is not allowed by our commie governor Murphy (who made his gorillions in ""finance"" to apprehend illegals. I am leaving this state as soon as my house sells. Done."
DrainTheSwamp,fd5inu3,t1_fd4ym48,1578177992.0,But NY now allows illegals to get a valid driver's license. So all the illegals will now have Real ID?
DrainTheSwamp,fd5i2v2,t1_fd5a9mj,1578177895.0,"It just keeps getting worse. If you're a valid US citizen you must show 6 ""points"" worth of ID to get your license. Passport or birth certificate, Social security card and utility bill. If you're an illegal you only need 2 Points of ID. Great huh."
DrainTheSwamp,fd5groq,t1_fd5a9mj,1578177459.0,"They don't even ask for ID. Racism doncha know. On the DMV forms for registration and licensing it asks if you'd like to register to vote. I asked them how would they know who was legal to vote. Answer: we don't. Welcome to NJ, sanctuary state extrodinaire. Leaving ASAP."
DrainTheSwamp,fd3ao1j,t3_ejx6xp,1578156426.0,Just came from our NJ DMV (now called MVC). I'd guess about 50 percent of the people getting their license there were here illegally. They can also register to vote at the same time. Nice.
AnimalTextGifs,fd3ac1j,t1_fd2ylr8,1578156320.0,Same here. Instantly recognize his face. We are far gone.
aww,fcvkbdk,t1_fcuba2d,1578003925.0,Very true. I did not become proficient at math until I as well into adulthood. I didn't realize how much moving around and not getting a consistent education hurt me until I couldn't pass most math exams. Now I know I can do math because I worked out a way to teach myself. It's a great skill.
aww,fcvk3nl,t1_fctvrc9,1578003792.0,"Personally, I don't think X wants to be found."
aww,fcvildb,t3_ej0jy2,1578002859.0,He handles the skidding like an expert skier hitting an ice patch.
aww,fcvigup,t1_fcvew3v,1578002783.0,"I dunno, but they look the same to me. Both amazing."
aww,fcvh882,t1_fcv5x6t,1578002035.0,"Yup, some dogs are just runners. My now almost fourteen year old is one of them. A few years ago he took every opportunity to get out for a good run. He'd be gone for a few hours while we frantically searched for him, but he's chipped and has our contact info on his tags. He's been returned by contractors working in our area, various families in the neighborhood, local police (who know him by sight and name), and other dog owners, whose backyards he couldn't resist exploring. One of our local police officers refers to him as a ""repeat offender"" and he once spent an entire shift riding with the K-Nine officer when his dog wasn't in the car. Love my neigborhood."
aww,fcnyznh,t3_ei511d,1577821140.0,Love it! Genuine LOL at the end.
aww,fc0l2lo,t3_efc62j,1577293436.0,You're both adorable. Love the matching pajamas and the fact that your cat doesn't look like he's about to kill you. Well done.
