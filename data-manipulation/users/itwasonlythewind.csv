When they’d try to get me to play arbiter thinking it’s a cute game, I stood there speechless until whomever handed me back the checkbook. It ain’t cute it’s awkward and a dangerous game, some ppl’s fragile egos or power are their bank accounts, ain’t my place"
AskReddit,fh6z6rg,t1_fh6t3zj,1581309947.0,"Reminds me of the time a couple sat down and immediately ordered two beers. As I was in the process of setting them down on the table, he told his wife to shut the fuck up, over nothing. So I picked them back up and told him he’s cut off. He stormed out, she followed him after apologizing to me. All in less than 5 minutes, so that table stayed empty until I came up in rotation again, 12 servers aka 12 tables later. Fuckers cost me two beers and a table for an hour but it was worth it to have that asshole gone. First time I’ve cut off someone who I didn’t even check for signs of drinking or had even technically given a drink to. Rubbed me really wrong, the way he spoke to her, too much violence in his voice, I wanted to punch him so bad and I’m not that kinda guy and was having a great day before. And that apology was not her first for her husband. I went from happy to shook in 5 minutes and it screwed my vibe up all night. If that was public behavior what was behind that curtain.."
AskReddit,fh6xl8i,t1_fh6saoh,1581308701.0,You make a good point as well. I think if we focused less on being adults and shaming childlike behavior we might find ourselves a lot more comfortable in our own skin. I know I feel alive when I play like a kid and act childish around close friends. I think we are closer to children than we are comfortable admitting.
todayilearned,fh6wx1m,t1_fh6rm56,1581308203.0,"I’d guess the same reason we haven’t adopted many other European practices like public transport and sidewalks, our land is spread out too far, it would only be practical in dense areas. Williamsburg VA. I’m told the tunnels are ventilated and lit for maintenance but your chances of being cooked alive or carbon monoxided is high or simply lost as many of the exits are locked off. We have a lot of secret societies who supposedly use them but I’m skeptical, they had all of colonial Williamsburg to fuck around in in secret, it’s a massive ghost town at night with the occasional reenactor walking by and enough foot traffic to blend in. I doubt I’d check them out now if given the chance, too many damn cops in that town. School, city, and federal cops all in a tiny ass area doing constant patrol. They sealed off the crypts a while back under the wren building, that was the jackpot, supposedly where the skull and daggers society stole bones. Old famous people buried there."
WTF,fh6v34y,t1_fh6qrb9,1581306850.0,"The Texas code is linked by another commenter, if you’re curious find it yourself. I’m not in the business of making dumb shit up or looking up laws for dumb shits. I think you lack common sense if those laws sound made up to you. Needs fenders for those spikes too, they are rock tillers atm, that’s a Texas law I’m not gonna look up for you either. If it’s spinning it’s considered a wheel that needs a matching fender or mud flap."
AskReddit,fh6u5jo,t3_f1hvi1,1581306165.0,"I don’t stick around after dropping off the check. That’s a really awkward time to hang around because you’d be signaling to them to pay right now which is akin to leave right now. Really quick way to ruin a customer’s experience, it’s not far from just standing there with your hand open. I’m guessing you won’t get many replies for this reason. It’s harder to eavesdrop than you’d think. When I simply glance at my table they notice, eye contact is important for getting their attention, you don’t want to overdo it. I won’t make eye contact when I check on drink levels for instance because it would cause them to stop talking and there’s no need to interrupt."
todayilearned,fh6qxjo,t1_fh6pqul,1581303912.0,"Many do esp university towns where they use steam to heat the dorms, everything. Other places heat buildings individually. Efficiency is that the steam is a free byproduct of making elect. Build the tunnels and its free heat. Inefficiency is heat dispersion and pressurization but that’s moot bc the steam would be in the sky without the tunnels regardless. It’s a brilliant system, esp if the buildings are all close like in NY or college campuses. Keeping ppl out of the tunnels can prove a hassle. We had a huge tunnel network under our campus with history and century old graves and maps and they connected the whole damn city through crazy hidden doors, very tempting but auto expulsion from the school."
AskReddit,fh6loxy,t1_fh4tmor,1581301083.0,"You got a degree in neuroscience or a source to back that up? Because I can find plenty of neuroscience textbooks that state the nerves that remain will gain the density of any nerves removed. Sensation is simply moved to a different area and relocalized. You’re not cutting huge nerves during circumcision.  What sensation is taken will come back with the same strength. You’re selling a load of horseshit to back up bullshit. So sick of this fucking argument. You know what cases you do see in hospitals? Foreskin infections, aka smegma, increased rates of stds, ripped and stuck foreskin. You know what we aren’t seeing? Any of the bullshit complaints by men or women about pounding you mentioned.

Edit: I see your sources below and they all describe short term expectations immediately following a circumcision, as with any surgery. But the articles and headlines make them out to be long term expectations. That’s misleading and false. Over half your article’s titles are even unsure of themselves. Good try though. The studies aren’t there, they never have been, never will be. Circumcised ppl aren’t having increased desensitization or ED or any of these bullshit problems you’re posing, there’s no correlation, none whatsoever or you would see it in journals and textbooks everywhere."
todayilearned,fh6k75g,t1_fh58251,1581300346.0,"By your logic there would be no way to catch these guys otherwise. CP is the evidence required unfortunately, without it there’s no case. If there was a better alternative it would be used, pedos are hated and many powerful groups have tons of money and resources to have them locked up. The alternative is the FBI creates its own site, that’s not better. Or they take the site down and it pops right back up, that’s not better. Or they outright keep their distance out of fear perpetuating CP and do nothing, that’s not better. What’s your suggestion? How would you catch these guys?"

worldnews,fh67x87,t1_fh3zopy,1581296013.0,There’s two very different endings that are both worth watching and very powerful. I’d argue both endings were meant to be watched.

WTF,fh5zxxv,t1_fh4zy0v,1581293898.0,"Not legal. Brake and head lights aren’t the same width as the car. At close to max width you need high orange and yellow reflectors on the front and back bumper as well. At night this car would most definitely be pulled/cause accidents. It’s as illegal and dangerous as it looks, don’t be fooled by the comments."
AskReddit,fh5unhi,t1_fh5kygw,1581292479.0,"Definitely doable and a good idea. Way harder to pull off a 20 min stealth oil change in my apt complex parking lot though. By the time I got to my battery last time there were plastic parts strewn everywhere and it looked like a yard sale. Older models, it’s one wrench, a drip pan, 2 ramps if it’s a low car and 30 mins max for an oil change.
  It was all the plastic covers keeping old water in my engine bay and battery compartment corroding the cables and destroying the auto start. So I doubly hate the covers. Never had problems with corrosion before when my battery wasn’t baffled in crap plastic."
AskReddit,fh5qxmb,t1_fh3jvk3,1581291520.0,"Those brands used to be more affordable, just like grey goose, you’re just paying premium price for name brand. Goose fails in blind tests to popov and other 15$ handle vodkas more often than not. Sambas are a very affordable, very long lasting, quality leather adidas shoe for 60$, predators being the soccer cleats for $60 base model that are reliable as well. Sambas and predators are 20+ year old styles however. Established but outdated products from overpriced companies can be deals. Apple sucks but the 5s is a steal right now for what it is. Simply put, it depends on if you’re going for the newest models."
AskReddit,fh5hiwh,t1_fh4ro86,1581289095.0,"Never payed more than 175$ for quality leather stuff from Clark’s that lasts a generation, I get compliments on 5 year old wallabies. Leather conditioner is as cheap as hair conditioner and turns leather brand new in seconds. A dab of wax based waterproof on the toes for winter months and boom, 5 year shoes easy. That’s 20$-45$ a year realistically. Even wearing them to work every day hasn’t had noticeable effects, leather is awesome!"

AskReddit,fh5esmi,t1_fh4hslq,1581288272.0,"Hell my 5s is over a decade old and looks as new as the day I got it. If you gave me an iPhone X or whatever new ones are out right now I wouldn’t use it. They’re too big for clothes, too heavy to carry on you all day, therefore more easily lost or stolen. Would you give up on a faithful girlfriend who’s never done anything wrong for 10 years for the girl next door who’s not any prettier? I wouldn’t"
AskReddit,fh5cp9e,t1_fh40mt6,1581287567.0,"For older models it’s a breeze to pick up those skills and usually quick to fix. Newer models put covers over the engine and undercarriage with proprietary screws you need to buy a special wrench for. Can’t even change the oil on my 2013 Ford Escape. Took wayyy too many steps to replace the windshield wipers and battery, just plastic crap covers screwed over everything with every size bolt you can imagine. It’s utter bullshit. Much like jackless smartphones, the newer models are less valuable when you consider ease of use and repair and parts and initial cost. It’s not even close, a lot of times you can get 2 or 3 used for the price of new. Scale it up to a sports or super car and it’s more like a fleet of cars for the same price."
AskReddit,fh5b32w,t1_fh3vwhp,1581286982.0,"Hell yeah. The only iPhone left that fits comfortably in my pocket. It’s beautiful still too, impossibly small and sleek, been in a life proof case mostly, their website gives me a free case whenever I want bc of lifetime warranty. I’ve had it since 2009 and have a backup 5s from when I lost the former and refound it, $200 for the backup. Newer phones look tacky in comparison, they look like plastic toy models. Sure the cameras are better but the OS difference is negligible and the newer phones are massive and weigh a ton. Why are we reverting? Where’s the small phones? 5s gang! 11 years strong, 11 years of 0$ towards cell phones, haven’t even had to replace the battery. That’s conservatively 3 or 4 iPhones over 500$ that I skipped out on. That’s a couple months rent aka work aka 2 months of work I got to take off. For a couple megapixels, psht. I’d rather use a laptop for more difficult tasks and save my eyes and back."
worldnews,fh2c37c,t1_fgzioqm,1581245538.0,"Depends on if I worked in a system of checks and balances or was an elected official. Lawyers don’t attack one another personally outside of court after a case, why is this any different? Stepping out of a court room and applying your own justice after a court decision has been made is for the most part illegal. Dumbass said why he fired him, which goes against a very well articulated whistleblower law. Would I do this or an average redditor? Most people don’t want to go to jail over such pettiness or fuck their reputation. Would you dodge a draft and fire a LT col for following a court order in the same lifetime? Only a narcissist would pick that battle, the hypocrisy and shame don’t come through for them naturally, hence why they are socially insane to an avg person."
AskReddit,fh24pdm,t1_fh1oxdn,1581235087.0,"Civil war was a browbeating lesson on racism every grade every history and english class. If you wanted more about the actual history of the war, well so did I. I answered your question alright, it’s probably just not what you wanted to hear or believe."
AskReddit,fh16y5y,t3_f0se8g,1581211473.0,"They beat it into us. Every class revolves around racism. Just about every book on every reading list was about racism, even in college. It gets really really really fucking old. I wanted to read Hemingway and Steinbeck. I had to read on my own to learn any American literature. I wanted to learn about other topics too. The books become repetitive, there aren’t many award winning classics about racism either, so they weren’t particularly enlightening or good, just about racism. White on black racism was gone over 20x more than any topic. Then I went out in the REAL world and learned that black on white racism is just as popular if not moreso. I hear about the former everywhere and all over media but I’ve seen the latter with my own eyes significantly more so my takeaway is people are racist, I get it, but as a southern white male my life is allowed to encompass more than white guilt. I don’t need to be brow beaten for the civil war ffs."
TalesFromTheCustomer,fh11nae,t3_f0tyva,1581209872.0,"This is a well known trick amongst veteran servers/bartenders bc it doesn’t show in inventory. Give away free booze- whoever does inventory will find out- also very illegal because ABC is of ATF therefore federal cops. So either don’t charge for soft drinks for regulars and hope they notice and tip more or (do charge and delete it before closing the check and pocket it if you really don’t care). I would argue the former is very situational, the latter is fireable, I was told by a few GMs to comp at my discretion and hookup regulars to an extent. There’s a million and one ways to steal from a restaurant, it’s honestly hard not to if you basically live there like most workers do. All employees drink the soft drinks and this is allowed at every restaurant I’ve heard of. I’m not condoning this, but it’s pennies and most GMs would be okay with it if they are decent GMs that look at the big picture. Having worked in corporate restaurants, they comp everything for any reason, even if it’s a boldfaced lie by the customer and we had scammers every day who knew this and that was the way it was. Comps come out of a Corp bank account somewhere, not the current restaurants owner’s pocket so they are actually happy to comp stuff. It’s the price of business and reputation."

Thetruthishere,febqj46,t3_eoabfm,1578961615.0,"You shouldn’t take ecstasy that frequently. It changes your brain’s neuroscience drastically. Your brain takes around 6-9 months to get back to true baseline operations for neurotransmitters. You really shouldn’t take it more than a handful of times in a lifetime or you risk permanent depression. There’s plenty of studies on this and an illness named after it, can’t remember the exact name but basically serotonin/dopamine deficiency that can not be fixed naturally, the binding sites are fried from the drugs. Not to mention the fact that most ppl aren’t getting pure MDMA, they are getting ecstasy cut with meth and other horrible shit. Pure mdma is crystalline in structure, usually with a purple hue, ecstasy pills are not, ask yourself why that is. Same problems arise w heroin, very, very few ppl are getting any heroin at all even though they believe they are. They are getting something much worse like fentanyl bc it’s cheaper for dealers to come by. Source is a neuroscience degree"
