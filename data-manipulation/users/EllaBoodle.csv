dogs,ffc68kf,t3_estlgm,1579792494.0,"Finn had a [play date with standard poodle](https://imgur.com/a/eiX7Jhk) that's about her age! Finn was so much smaller! The standard was shy at first, but Finn was very adamant that they would be friends! They had a blast running around the yard and the house. Finn passed out once we got home haha. 

Also, why do dogs love toilet paper so much?"

RandomActsofCards,ffb6jg4,t3_eslx3h,1579753130.0,"I would love one! 

A fun fact about me is that I have a little mini poodle named Finlaggan (or Finn for short!) She is named after my family lab - Callie. It doesn't seem like they are similar, but Callie (short for Caledonian Macbrayne) was named after a fleet of ferries in the UK. The Finlaggan is a boat in the fleet :) \[this fact is more about my dog but.... she is basically running my life anyways\]"
dogs,ff6zfo4,t1_ff6tbt6,1579638047.0,"Yea, my previous poodle was not very good at being groomed and could be a little nippy so I’m trying to make sure this puppy doesn’t do that also :) 
Your poodle sounds like a champ! Hopefully Finn can be like your pup one day!"
plantclinic,ff59afu,t1_ff57s8m,1579584100.0,What does the misting do? Just curious :)
dogs,ff53koe,t3_erp341,1579579272.0,"I have been prioritizing desensitizing her to handling - brushing, poking, prodding, bathing. I want her to be ok at the vets, groomers, with me etc. 

I also love a good sit so that's another important one, as is off-leash walking (but I will wait until she is a little older and our bond is more cemented to start that) 

I will definitely start working on down, place, crate, stay, come, etc. in a bit, but for now, I just want her to love me and be good with handling (and sitting)."
dogs,ff51bn7,t1_ff202vi,1579577559.0,"Yea, I've been getting this dog familiar with brushing and the sounds of the bath. She took the full plunge today and she fell asleep in the bath so she was either very comfortable or she was hoping to wake up when the nightmare was over. Not sure this bodes well for any swimming in her future tho :')"
poodles,ff50j3e,t3_ernxzi,1579576974.0,That is an adorable picture!
dogs,ff44xky,t1_ff3b3ak,1579555626.0,"Ok, thank you :)"
