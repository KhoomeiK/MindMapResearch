DunderMifflin,fe3bezz,t1_fe2ynm3,1578847734.0,"Not at all. Season one did well that’s why it got picked up for season two. They shot the whole first season before airing it (obviously) if it didn’t do well they wouldn’t have not gotten the second season. They also didn’t “rewrite” the show. Once they knew they had a season two, they wanted to build there own version of Michael instead of being the US version of ricky gervais. In other words they didn’t go back and change things, they built on what they had. And it’s all explained by people who worked on the show.

Edit: For all you people especially the idiot who said “how people like me ......” this was all said by Jenna Fischer and Angela on their podcast. Also the the office season two got the green light before the 40 year old virgin came out. Sure they were riding the hype of Steve carrel but that was after they knew they were all in. Again this was all said by the people who made the show."
