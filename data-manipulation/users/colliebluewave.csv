creepy,ffofae5,t1_ffnpa39,1580077091.0,"Yeah, I think one of the worst things about dementia for sufferers must be how alone they often feel. My gran is very loved but she 100% feels lost and alone when she wakes up in the middle of the night or once when she wandered off in her early stages. This poor woman might not be ‘alone’ but she clearly feels alone."
creepy,ffoepbb,t1_ffnd76q,1580076875.0,"It depends. My gran suffered a lot at first because her dementia included psychosis (auditory and visual hallucinations are more common in later stages but were some of her first symptoms) and a symptom of her dementia was depression and suicidal thoughts. But she improved on antidepressants and antipsychotics massively. I would say she still has quality of life. She can experience a lot of pleasure and enjoyment, however they have to be taken to her and she’s too passive and lost to seek out stuff to make her happy because she’s confused - she won’t do something unless you tell her or lead her to do it. Sometimes she will wake up and be very scared which comes out as anger. However she’s also lost her inhibitions and laughs very freely and sings very freely - only childhood folk songs from her background and she doesn’t know most of the words now. She can’t communicate well which is frustrating and I imagine upsetting. But when she’s with the right person who will hold her hand or dance or sing with her or play catch with her etc then she is very very happy. Her mood depends on the surroundings so when she’s upset it’s very easy to get her to feel less upset by acting cheerful and jokey. I would say it’s an awful death compared to many but she also gets a lot of pleasure out of living. The first stage was worse than this one. I now think she is better off living even if it’s often more difficult for the family, but her first symptoms made me want her to die quickly to save her from her depression, visual and auditory hallucinations and anger."
SubredditDrama,ff1efg9,t1_ff19ti4,1579478153.0,"Also depending on country, it can go way back. Relatively speaking of course - neopaganism (in the non Nazi way) mostly has its roots in the early 20th century and Wicca was invented in the late 1930s/40s which had a lot of influence on many moden pagans who reject Wicca. I know someone who’s grandmother was Wiccan and converted maybe in the 1950s. She brought her daughter up neopagan (using kind of a mix of gods and much freer then Wicca I think) and my friend was therefore a third generation pagan. However they were very strongly culturally Christian - celebrated Christmas, Easter (blah blah pagan origins but they were fine with all the Christian stuff - as someone from a non-Christian background it’s super obvious that neopaganism was an add on rather than the sole religious influence if that makes sense). Ngl i thought my friend was insane about religion and didn’t take her seriously. I realise that she was born into it as much as anyone is born into a religion though and just avoid talking about it because I fundamentally cannot take any of it seriously, especially because in my history degree a lot of stuff I studied coincided with neopagan historiography where all the facts were mostly against a lot of basics (like no samhain was probably not Celtic new year etc)."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fexs0ut,t1_fex9cyo,1579435234.0,"Bagels are Jewish (in origin). Bagels are not sweet, they’re a plain bread roll essentially and they’re delicious and absolutely never were intended to have sweet stuff, chocolate, flavourings etc. In my country, bagels have also gone mainstream but unlike in the US they have thankfully avoided such additions. But a lot of Jews would be horrified at the idea of a peanut butter chocolate chip bagel. It’s like how I imagine any American would react to hearing about a peanut butter chocolate chip thanksgiving turkey."
AnimalsBeingBros,fet9ncv,t1_fet5woh,1579373031.0,Mostly they won’t be put down but have to get muzzled in public etc. Some will be put down if discovered in situations where they need to be resolved because many of the pits discovered in the U.K. are used for dog fighting etc or are otherwise kept by criminals for protection/badly trained.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,festaby,t1_fermdij,1579368822.0,"That might make sense! It definitely fits some of the stereotypes. Honestly I feel so depressed reading about the trials, especially the image of little Jennet on the table condemning her mother."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fessw2o,t1_fesbh9a,1579368688.0,"Ah i forgot to put her name! I did mention her in the first paragraph because I typed a short reply and was then like, fuck it let’s do them all. Can’t forget her and her scarlet bodice!"
AskEurope,ferft9u,t1_fer7k5b,1579353358.0,"And in parts of Romania, Romani people were enslaved until the 1860s. But in terms of English history, I’m pretty sure Romani were repeatedly expelled and could be executed for their ethnicity in Tudor England, like 100+ Romani were executed at York (?) in 1596 for being Romani. In Europe as a whole it was similar - in 1545 apparently Germany just let you kill Romani on sight and loads of little kids were just being drowned en masse in the resulting genocide."
AskEurope,ferey9c,t1_feqmru0,1579353107.0,"Super depressing how half the replies to this comment are people going ‘but wait, you need to be sympathetic to MY being racist against you.’ I honestly can’t imagine being openly Romani on reddit because of how all encompassing the racism seems to be."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,ferdmhe,t3_eqbj9w,1579352674.0,"While I like these posts, they’re usually historically inaccurate. The first woman to really be accused of witchcraft at Salem was an enslaved member of the household - she was threatening because she wasn’t on her own - and she was also married. The first person to be executed was married three times, lived with her husband at the time of the accusations and had several children. 

Rebecca Nurse was in a prosperous family. She was part of a respectable household/marriage, had eight kids and was seen as living the ideal and good Christian life for a woman. During the accusation she was supported by several members of her family and was close to her children. 

Sarah Good was married. However her accusations were probably influenced by her dependency - though this is a big dispute just because there are tons of competing theories. The traditional theory (by Thompson etc) was that the dependency of poor people made them seem more threatening as witches because they lacked power except through words/magic and might bewitch those who refused then charity. Nonetheless she was not prosperous or unmarried, her husband reported fearing her.

Elizabeth Howe was married to a man named Jems. He was blind. She had several daughters. Her husband and her daughters supported her during her imprisonment and made sure she was fed, comforted and had clean clothes.

Susannah Martin was widowed with eight children (one of her descendants was a president - Chester A. Arthur !) although her witchcraft accusation included an allegation oneof her sons was a bastard (this accusation was withdrawn). Her accusation was probably encoiraged by her family having been in dispute with an accusing family in the past. She probably best fits this model of someone living unmarried - she was very poor too.

Sarah Wildes was married with children (and eight step children). Her son held an important position as treasurer in Salem village. Two of her step daughters and a son in law were also accused of witchcraft - her being part of a family was important to the trial. However she had committed fornication when young, been punished for wearing a silk scarf and was generally a glamorous young woman - this reputation might have lingered into middle age. Her husband actually ended up marrying a woman who’s husband had been killed in the witchcraft trials.

George Burroughs was a man, minister and twice married. 

George Jacobs was a man, married and with children and grandchildren.  His main accuser was his granddaughter!

Martha Carrier was married and had eight children,several of whom were teenagers at the time of her trial, and lived near her sister. She was poor. She was probably encoiraged to be seen as a suspect because her family had been carriers (!) of a disease that killed thirteen people when they travelled to Andover - two of her kids died but the rest and her husband survived. Martha was arrested with her sister and brother in law, her young children were inrpdioned with her (if she confessed they could leave). Her position as a married mother was therefore important.

John Proctor was a man, married three times, had eighteen children. He and his wife were accused. They were well off. They were connected to Rebecca nurse. Including her, 12 members of their extended family were accused - they were not seen as isolated. 

John Willard was a man and married. He beat his wife and this might have encoiraged suspicion against him. His in laws hated him because of this. 

Martha Corey was married, but had an illegitimate mixed race son her husband raised as his own. She remarried after being widowed - Giles Corey, he was alsoa ccused. She was very pious and upright generally. Giles Corey was the guy who got crushed to death, he was obviously married and with several children. 

Mary eastey was Rebecca nurse’s sister. She was married with eleven children. She was very pious. She had grandchildren too. 

Mary Parker was a 55yr old widow. She might fit this image. She had several children, and one daughter was also accused of witchcraft. 

Alice Parker was married to John Parker. 

Ann Pudeator was widowed twice. She might also fit. She had five children. Her children supported her - and actually her son testified against Burroughs to try and save her life. 

Wilmot redd might fit a little. She was married but known for being irritable/independent/basically what some men might see as a bitch. 

Margaret Scott also kind of fits. She was widowed with three adult children. She was poor and had to beg - her dependency and not prosperity might have been suspicious. 

Samuel wardwell was married with children.

Tldr; people killed for witchcraft were real humans and we shouldn’t fake their history as we obscure their very real suffering. In Salem, most women were married and if they weren’t, they weren’t prosperous. In Europe, most witches were married and with children. Some places had inter-household accusations (husband ornkids accuse a wife of being a witch) such as Scotland and Germany. In Scotland, 84% of accused witches were women, the most common age group was between 20-50, and most witches were 20-60. 78% with known marriage status were married, 19% were widowed. But likely that many of those with unknown marriage status were unmarried.

Witchcraft accusations were pretty rare in New England and in England. They were almost nonexistent in Wales and iteland. They weren’t uncommon in Scotland (but rare in Gaelic areas). During some witchcraft crazes in Germany, Switzerland and Norway, there are villages and even towns where 25-75% of the female population were killed however. It’s super interesting and misogyny was super important. I love the history of witchcraft so much and would recommend properly reading up on it to really understand early modern misogyny - the poor woman (often poor because of societal sexism) who was usually married and with kids was the typical threat. Most accusations were sporadic and not part of crazes in England and New England."
AmItheAsshole,fela888,t1_fel88rn,1579217462.0,"Really? I’m the opposite. Friend is going to have a great time and get married to the love of his life anyway. He’ll have a great day if things can be sorted out practicalities wise, even if he’ll be sad not to have his best friend. Girlfriend is having one of her worst days  ever, and desperately needs support. Friend has the special someone there, girlfriend needs someone who is fully in support mode. I’d 100% tell my friend in this situation to be with their gf."
Judaism,fel3yms,t3_epml8v,1579213548.0,"This is my local area/mosque!! This was quite a minor story so not sure why it’s worldnews. Ilford is interesting. Unlike golders green I wouldn’t say there is much religious competition. We were historically quite Jewish (think maybe 40% Jewish ar the peak in the mid 20th century) which declined due to moves into Essex and the aging population. The area doesn’t feel like it has any majority religion, I think the borough‘s largest religion is mostly Christian but Ilford itself is different - the most common religion is probably Islam but maybe only 20-35%, and a similar level for Christianity (many Pentecostalists, Nigerian catholics etc, many denominations but rarely Anglican), a significant Hindu/Tamil population, and then maybe 10% Sikh, 10% Jewish? I think having no particular ethnic or religious majority helps cohesion as it’s truly multicultural in that way, not segregated. At the same time there is some serious antisemitism (I’ve experienced a lot in scholl growing up + antisemitic assaults every now and then + antisemitic graffiti and posters sometimes) most of which comes from Muslims, just as Muslims in Ilford also experience islamophobia, it’s part of being a minority i guess unfortunately that some people will always be idiots. What helps unfortunately is we do not have a charedi community whatsoever, we have a small modern orthodox community, and reform and liberal Jews; many Jews are secular. The Jewish schools are all about 50% non Jewish due to the declining Jewish population which promotes cohesion. I would favori ensuring all religious schools had to accept 30% of their intake randomly because I think this helps a lot. There’s also some good interfaith community links - the Ilford forum took a multifaith trip to Israel this year for instance and went to the West Bank; i think most members were Jewish, Muslim and a few Christians.

Edit: but I wouldn’t recommend it particularly. I experienced a lot of homophobia which is one area Ilford is pretty poor at but otherwise it’s okay"
ainbow,fe5dcg9,t1_fe49qer,1578868016.0,"I’m 20 and it really depends on area - I’m from a shitty area in east London and literally all my family were okay but many people I knew socially weren’t. My closest friends were fine but weird about it because literally no one in my school was openly out because you’d have been a social pariah - they’d never knowingly been friends with a lesbian and were uncertain about it. I lost two friends. Luckily I was uncomfortable around people who were homophobic and also ‘luckily’ my school was openly homophobic enough but close enough to some super progressive areas in London that homophobia came up a lot (god put gay people on earth as a temptation/challenge to good people, gays are unnatural, I’m not talking homophobia as in gay marriage is wrong but homophobia in the sense of wanting gay sex to be illegal, lock us up in a psychiatric ward etc). I was aware I was lesbian from about 11 and therefore didn’t end up in friendship groups with the worst, which didn’t stop me losing two people I loved but still saved me from complete isolation.

Edit; my school and sixth form came down on open homophobia. I’d say most people started growing out of t when they went to university (those who didn’t go probably also) because mostly it was parents being homophobic. From people I’ve met in my age group, I know my area/school was unusual about being so homophobic but I still know someone who was chased with rocks for being gay - but in a school with more people who were out so he didn’t lose friends."
AskWomen,fdqnamf,t1_fdq6b2y,1578670695.0,"I imagine it can go further then that and varies for different people. My mum was in her mid-late 50s when she achieved financial stability, got the freedom of having her kids leave home, realised her sexuality, has great friends (and sadly lost some) and great colleagues, found the job and company that’s perfect for her and gives her satisfaction and treats her well, she’s got her first dog (her biggest love), celebrated her first Christmas (for the fun of it, as we’re from a non Christian background), improved her French, started doing a lot more exercise, read hundreds and hundreds of books, started writing her own book, started singing again and has finally become confident with having her photo taken when she used to hate that as she thought she looked old/ugly. And getting to travel again due to aforementioned financial stability (albeit only within a few hours of us and cheap but a lot of cool stuff round us) + us kids saving the money together to send her to places. She’s always been a good cook but has started making some great Indian dishes and some more recent friends have taught her some Ethiopian dishes, not to mention she’s mroe expérimental than ever with baking. Id be happy to have my 50s like hers minus the surviving cancer bit of it!"
Dogfree,fdqltof,t1_fdpwvqe,1578669741.0,"I live in a genuinely pretty bad area with high rates of crime (obviously nowhere near as bad as the US, but two people stabbed on my street and significant gang problems in local schools, generally shitty area in east London basically) etc. I can’t say I’ve knowingly seen a Pitbull in my life in this area, I went to the US once and saw several. However I’m pretty confident there are pitbull mixes around (crossed with staffies) that I’ve not noticed and dog fighting is still a thing for sure (there was a raid down my road a few months back for this) and if anything is going to involve pitbulls it will be that. Staffies (british ones not American Staffordshire bull terriers) are the usual culprit for serious bite injuries and death, though again some of them will be 1/4-1/2 pitbull, but mostly they won’t be. Staffies have the same rhetoric as pitbulls e.g adopt a staffie, it’s all in the training not the breed etc and have also got the same prestige/status as pitbulls while being easier to come by, so there’s not as much desire to get them. So I would say it’s very well controlled in the sense that it is very very unlikely for a pitbull or half pitbull to end up in a family home, to endanger a child - but staffies are still an issue. On the other hand pitbulls remain a significant problem in the dog fighting world which is difficult to police."
Epilepsy,fdnwuv8,t1_fdn4e8s,1578594472.0,"Thanks! Luckily I don’t think my seizures are triggered or encourage by my periods - in fact it’s a testimony to how well Keppra has controlled them that when I’m very stressed due to the pain (stress being a big trigger for my seizures) I’m not having anything exceot my normal rate of absence seizures. I’m lesbian and have had a family member experienced a ruptured brain aneurysm due to her birth control so I was hoping to avoid that, but it seems like a good option to ask about given that Keppra has controlled my seizures so well and I’ve had a serious response to my first medication. Wish I had my own obgyn but not how it works in my country, super jealous as it seems a great thing to talk to a specialist about! I’ll talk to my GP about some options."
Epilepsy,fdnwixp,t1_fdn3zwg,1578594281.0,"My country doesn’t do obygns for normal stuff, we just go to the GP. Unfortunately my gp is understaffed and I’ve never seen the same GP twice (though I have one assigned to me). Better just make an appointment. I always leave it late because unless it’s an emergency or something I need out of hours or ab appointment within one or two days, then I normally can’t get an appointment for 2-3 weeks and always at an awkward time. Sadly lamotrigine not an option as I had a serious (potentially life threatening) reaction which is probably why I’m so hesitant to bring this up when it seems so ‘small’ in comparison to my reaction to lamotrigine. Especially because it’s only 1-2 days of pain per month. But it really has got so bad I need to change or find a medication to counteract this. Thanks for the support!"
AskEurope,fdmwb3j,t3_em4q28,1578568787.0,"Can’t speak for the whole of the U.K., so I’ll speak for Jews in Europe instead. It’s very normal to be named after family members in Judaism/Jewish cultures. Ashkenazim - who make up most european jews (the descendants of Jews who lived in medieval Germany and who spread out to Poland, Russia etc, most look white) - typically have a taboo against naming the child after a living relative and it’s very common to name a child after a recently deceased relative. I was named after a great-aunt for example. It’s not just for commemoration but also is hoped to give the child a role-model or an ideal to follow in the person they were named after. 

Sephardim (jews who lived in Spain and Portugal and were kicked out due to the inquisition - most then went to North Africa and turkey, and now Israel, but many lived in the Netherlands, the balkans and Greece, while there’s a larger community of North African Jews in France now) tend to name their kids after living relatives, usually grandparents. 

However, if you want to name your child after a living or dead relative but you don’t like their name or don’t want the kid to stand out, you can have a first name and a Hebrew name. Every Jew should have a Hebrew name, and often it’s the same as their first name or very similar (like the first name might be the anglicised version of their Hebrew name). But you could also give your kid a very different Hebrew name (and use that for the dead relative if Ashkenazi or living relative if Sephardi), or vice versa. It’s also not uncommon to choose a similar name to the loved one - for example, my mother’s name means bee in one language, I don’t like her name but if I had a kid I might try and find other names meaning bee or connected to e.g flowers or honey and use it as a main or Hebrew name."
Epilepsy,fdmvi7o,t3_elowgh,1578567753.0,"Make sure to have a warning up! Ideally, even, a warning saying that there are flashing lights in some transitions, to allow people to prepare themselves. The ideal would be to have a small onscreen warning and then in the description mention the transitions it occurs - it’s something I look for, very few people do but it’s super helpful. The issue with a short burst of flashing is  I can’t protect myself against it. I have very strong photosensitive responses - I’m affected by going on a bus or car and passing by a line of trees due to the pattern the light makes through the branches. On the other hand while I have the beginnings of a simple partial seizure (also known as an aura) quickly, if I cover one eye or remove myself then I can very easily prevent an absence or tonic clonic seizure (which is luckier than some).  Photosensitivity is super varied - someone people just have it from looking at black/white contrasts! 

However on most modern phones, laptops etc it’s quite difficult to trigger photosensitivity due to the lighting. Aside from the type of screens, most peopoe with photosensitive are affected by background lighting - flashing lights in a well lit area may be fine for many (they’re fine for me in a very well lit area, but if there’s any slight shadow etc then they still affect me which is more unusual). So if the transition occurs between two dark or black scenes then it is more likely to be problematic. Is there anything that might make the viewer realise flashing lights are more likely (given the fact a viewer with photosensitivity will be on the look out for any clues)? For example, specific music associated with the transition or specific settings or any reason why you’ve chosen to have flashing lights for the transitions (setting or plot or whatever)? And is it obvious or sudden when a scene comes to an end and the transition happens? This isn’t something to add in - we’re 3-5% of the population with epilepsy after all, and if there’s only a few big screenings and otherwise it’s watched on laptops (less seizure risk by far), then even if your entire audience was made up of people with epilepsy, it’s likely 0 people would have a seizure. It just means that if you have them, then you can breathe even easier as once people know that transition = flashing for some scenes, they can take appropriate precautions where possible."
