Pewdiepie may have made a few videos on the game but that flame died out fairly quick. If the game got the same traction as mibecraft, there would be hundreds of amazing mods that add, change, and remove from the game. There's so much potential for the community and I wish for that potential to unleash. The biggest thing that would be great is servers. Currently the biggest server is pedguins server. At average it has around 100 people online. If we could get a server size like Hypixel it would be amazing. Amazing minigames, communication, and more."
