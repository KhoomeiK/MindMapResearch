instant_regret,ffdc2cp,t1_ffcd10b,1579817688.0,"This is funny, but I don't see a single ounce of regret in that girl's face."
AskReddit,ffd3avu,t1_ffbujeu,1579812584.0,"There are several sacred things in this world that you don't ever mess with. One of them happens to be another man's fries. Now, you remember that, and you will live a long and healthy life."
todayilearned,femom1k,t1_femd03k,1579264863.0,The classic struggle in Chinese folklore is the dragon battling the phoenix.
wholesomememes,femn9ff,t1_femmakc,1579263468.0,"The key is to be attractive, and to avoid being unattractive."
Showerthoughts,fekswia,t3_epkyx3,1579206922.0,I see that you have also seen the movie The Revenant.
dontputyourdickinthat,fekcrbf,t1_fek101g,1579197328.0,"They were probably fans of GG Allin attending one of his shows.  Some sample lyrics from his most popular song, [I Kill Everything I Fuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJVPCzpi5xk):

  
I'm infected with AIDS.

I fuck every day.  

I kill everything I fuck.

I'll fill you up with my disease

Contaminate you with deadly needs

My loaded cock is like a gun

I'm a walking time bomb killing everyone"
trashy,fehrupt,t1_fehqbgs,1579122630.0,She ended up finishing the show after a short break which kind of ruins your theory.
ThatsInsane,fehdza6,t1_fehcd41,1579114586.0,"According to the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earwig), these bugs crawling into human ears is just an old wives tale propagated by some anecdotal reports.  Entomologists say that they were named as such because their hindwings resemble a human ear when unfolded."
AskReddit,fegzslz,t1_fegrcdv,1579106149.0,"Well, in most scenes he was a badass in Clone Wars, but at the end of the original animated series, Mace Windu manages to cripple him at a distance with nothing more than a split second hand motion.  The fight with Obi Wan in the movies was a desperate struggle in comparison.  Still, I agree that using a blaster to end the fight is pretty disappointing."
CatastrophicFailure,fed9t1a,t1_feci40w,1579005002.0,"The accident was quite the disaster, but not as bad as the format this video is in."
AnimalsBeingJerks,feaz20r,t1_fe8v2nl,1578953731.0,I'm pretty sure the child is standing next to 100kg of hippo poop at the bottom of the pool.
trashy,feaensx,t1_fe8n1zi,1578947779.0,"According to [this article](https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-beggar-sentenced-jail-causing-9000-damage-because-no-one-giving-money-report-says), she was staying at a motel so she wasn't exactly homeless.  She trashed the motel by throwing the TV, cable box and dresser drawers out the window.  She also shattered the car window of a father driving with his daughter because she thought the father was sticking his tongue out at her.  

In the article she says she is a diagnosed bipolar who hasn't been taking her meds, but she does smoke meth.  She is also trying to regain custody of her three children (good luck with that, lady)"
Filmmakers,fe7uhox,t1_fe7tvf9,1578919407.0,"Well, this could be a small part of such a intro.  The guy in the car is Otto, the fun loving neighborhood drug dealer and the skate boarder is Bort Sampson one of the protagonists of the show."
Filmmakers,fe7rn7x,t1_fe6tip4,1578918429.0,It looks something like a live action version of the Simpsons intro.
interestingasfuck,fdrukfs,t1_fdrjtc1,1578689985.0,Neatly shaven vaginas that look like Homer Simpson's mouth.  This sounds like a sarcastic answer but ~~truth~~ reddit is stranger than fiction.
AskReddit,fdrcr6i,t1_fdqg7ed,1578682574.0,This ghost girl must have been a mobile-app programmer to be able to hack a ride-hailing app like that.
StarWars,fdon1sm,t1_fdnyutx,1578608487.0,She should expand on this.  The next frame should be Baby Yoda telling Rey to hold his juice box while he force-chokes a bitch.
todayilearned,fdoijhz,t3_emgea2,1578605851.0,Credit to u/Volcanicrage for his [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/embr1u/birds_of_prey_official_trailer_2/fdnzzol?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) where I learned about this character.
movies,fdeyg6d,t1_fdexe75,1578349268.0,Yes.  Shell-head is actually Iron Man's nickname.  I've seen Spiderman call him that in the comics.
StarWars,fczdvn9,t1_fcz3sa4,1578098990.0,"I believe if Obi Wan believed Dooku and decided to take his offer and join him as his apprentice, Dooku would have done what every Sith apprentice does and try to supplant Palpatine as the new Dark Lord.  It is the rule of two and the way of the Sith."
StarWars,fcz0ixu,t1_fcymk2l,1578091196.0,"At least in the movies, Darth Maul did not have any lines so you can't really gauge his loyalty to Sidious.  Dooku, however, was totally not loyal.  He straight up propositions Obi Wan Kenobi to join him and help take down his master in Attack of the Clones."
todayilearned,fcvqbb2,t1_fcvlv3t,1578007694.0,This is why most people can’t fathom unconditional love.  It means you love them no matter what they do or what happens.  I would venture to say that most people who say they love someone unconditionally just haven’t encountered the worst conditions yet.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fckt923,t1_fckshi0,1577732694.0,"Ah, ok.  Maybe you are getting downvoted by people who enjoy that subreddit?  It's not much different from this one."
JusticeServed,fcks5jd,t1_fcjndcz,1577732019.0,"If ""my guy"" started rambling on and on about windmills and how he doesn't understand the wind, I would definitely think a mental evaluation was in order."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fckput8,t1_fcjvj7u,1577730604.0,I assume you're talking about the guy with the little mustache.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fckp0mc,t1_fck6tdh,1577730088.0,u/theducatiguy is making a joke by being ironic.  OP replied as if it was a serious comment and gets downvoted for having the joke whoosh over his head.  The end.
iamatotalpieceofshit,fckm87t,t1_fckchbz,1577728376.0,"Uhm, the old man doesn't get punished for his violently inconsiderate actions so this is not a good candidate for r/JusticeServed"
AskReddit,fc6om0n,t1_fc5vopt,1577485573.0,"Yes, and this is extra confusing because it is legal to drink alcohol in public in Japan.  You'd think that means you'll see people getting wasted on the streets, but apparently it's considered rude to walk around sipping a beverage so nobody does it (except for rude tourists like me and my friend)."
