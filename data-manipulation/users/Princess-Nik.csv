BitLifeApp,ff9jlk0,t3_eseral,1579714390.0,"Happiness: go to relationships and select “spend time with all” until you’re on 100% (your relationship with each person will only increase once a year but happiness will keep going up).

Health: Gym, Meditate, Massage, Alternative doctors (not including witch doctor) and walk pets.

Smarts: watch documentary every year available and go to the library. Make good decisions when pop ups appear. 

Looks: Gym, plastic surgery (botox, face lift, eyelid surgery etc) and salon (if you get a tan get a spray tan bc using sun beds too much gives you cancer and I mean it can even happen the first time)."
