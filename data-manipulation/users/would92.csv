> Well Palpatine is one of the greatest and most powerful Sith to ever lived. A master manipulator who for decades set in motion his plan to rule the galaxy and defeat the Jedi which he almost succeeded. A man who claims ""the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."" 

I admit it's not *impossible* for him to have survived, but there's two flaws with that. First, it erases the satisfying conclusion of the original trilogy. Second, there was no explanation as to how he survived. He's there just because.

> When Kylo probed Rey's mind he initiated the force bond and shared basic jedi knowledge and force stuff with her. 

I've never heard that explanation before. Was it explained in TRoS? I don't really have anything against that argument, but it doesn't help with the fact that Rey is not a compelling character. She doesn't have actual flaws with her character. Besides, how was she able to fly the Millennium Falcon, bypass the compressor and so on? Those aren't even Force-related skills, yet she excels at them with no experience. She's also able to pilot the boat-thingy in TRoS.

> For all we know Obi-Wan only taught Luke to open himself up to the force to block some small blasters from that training droid before he died. Luke pulled force pull out of nowhere with no training for it in Empire Strikes Back. 

Exactly. In ANH he got in touch with the Force for the first time. Force-pulling a light object such as a lightsaber isn't that impressive, so it's possible he could do that with there being a gap of a few years between ANH and Empire. In The Last Jedi, Rey was able to lift several boulders despite her being introduced to the Force just a few days ago(?)

>  Luke spent 2-3 weeks at most with Yoda who was trying to teach him patience and was doing it slow but still accelerated course. 1 year passes between Empire Strike back and Return of the Jedi and he never went back to Yoda and learned how to make a Lightsaber and became greater in the force. Rey had 1 year in between The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker + The original jedi text + Leia to help train her. 

I can't really remember what Force tricks Luke uses in ROTJ, but was he really *that* strong? He definitely didn't do something as impressive as levitation, like Rey. I agree, though, that his growth is quite fast. I read that he would have found lightsaber parts in Obi-Wan's possessions, so that seems plausible – it isn't explained in the movie, though, so that's a fault of the film. Anakin was a lot stronger in Revenge of the Sith than Luke in ROTJ. He couldn't become a master simply because the council didn't trust him.

> Force Heal has popped up in the books, games, and legends multiple time. Just because it was never shown doesn't mean it never existed unless they specifically said it never existed. 

They weren't canon, were they? Concerning Force Skype, though, it seems sensible that it's not an impossible, but a rare ability. My mistake :)

> So it wasn't just a lightsaber. She was using the force to help guide and protect her against the lightning. 

Why hasn't that been done before?"
