not glamorous at all . I cringe . 
For the most part, I have it under control now. I just eat portions I know will keep the hunger away.

I'm 24 female, in a relationship . have been for six years now. He's great but... 

I am so scared of getting married just to get a divorce.  Or being with someone who isn't right for me.

I know there's absolutely no way of telling for sure but, were there any red flags early on in the relationship or before you got married to your ex that you ignored bc you'd think it would get better , or did the red flags show up after getting married?"
