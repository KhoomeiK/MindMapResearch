aww,ffpzanv,t1_ffpy6ff,1580112066.0,Honestly!!! All three of my cats absolutely worship me. I’ve never had such loyalty and care in my life but they give me so much love.
aww,ffpvczv,t1_ffprigq,1580107136.0,Mine runs to the door every time I come home and jumps up on her car perch by the door to say goodbye when I leave!!!!!
YouShouldKnow,ffiq5f2,t3_eth6o9,1579979944.0,"My mom says she noticed symptoms of depression and extreme exhaustion when she was fairly young and didn’t think much of it. When she had me and my brother, they got worse. The doctor told her it was probably her busy lifestyle, with kids and whatnot. She was finally diagnosed when I was about 19 with hypothyroidism and had to live with it, untreated, for over 25 years. So yes! If you can, it can be found in a blood test."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,ffijj0c,t3_etr3eq,1579975373.0,Just want to comment here because I checked your profile and you’re not sure what breed she is. I have a Jack Russell X chihuahua girl and they look very similar. Not sure if you’ve got her a DNA test but I could see it
booksuggestions,ffds7io,t3_esviaw,1579827616.0,"I wouldn’t say it matters, as they’re all unrelated. All that reading another one first would do is get you used to his writing.

However, I do recommend checking out “discipline and punish: the birth of the prison” by Michel Foucault. He has a very interesting perspective toward surveillance."
AskMen,ff59pim,t3_erlbbu,1579584488.0,"Last year, I was on tinder and matched with a guy who wasn’t my usual type but he seemed cool, if a bit cocky. He asks me out and recommends a place halfway across the city from me for 7pm a few days later. The day of and we’re texting and he’s like “yeah, I have to work at 10 by the way” (at a club). I was like meh whatever, atleast I know I’ll be out by a certain time, don’t have to worry about the whole “should we go?” thing. Then he texts me saying he’s off school at like 4 but wants to goto the gym so we should push the date to 8. Ok, whatever.

I get there at 7:55 and grab a table. I texted him to let him know where I was and he’s like “be there in 5.” He shows up at 8:20 and tells me he doesn’t have super long because he has to be at work for like 9:15. I’m already irritated. Waitress comes up and before she can say anything he just blurts out “I’ll get a water,” she drops it off and tells us she’ll be right back. He then obnoxiously waves he down like not even a minute later. We got a charcuterie board and dude was taking shit right off the board with his fingers and that turned me off real quick. Conversation wasn’t interesting and he cut me off numerous times. Waitress comes up and she asks if everything’s okay and he just goes “I’ll get the bill.” and to top it off, he tried to hug me outside the restaurant to say goodbye AFTER insulting me for being short. 

Neither of us ever contacted the other again."

AskReddit,fccq5tn,t1_fcay50m,1577601333.0,"I lost my dad suddenly when I was 10 and I’ve found that my go-to now is “I understand how you feel.” Because I really do and for someone to understand that their grieving is normal often helps them feel less alone. That may sound bad to some, like downplaying what happened to them. But a lot of people indulge me in asking what happened, how it felt then, and how it feels now and I appreciate that because I feel like I can offer them hope to show that their situation will improve because I understand the grief and the gut-wrenching pain, even the process of healing."
books,fbcv2vh,t3_ecenwt,1576734854.0,"You should check out Samuel Johnson’s “preface to Shakespeare.” Basically, he acknowledges the importance of Shakespeare’s works because of its accurate portrayals of human nature and it’s appeal as well as the unity of action in Shakespeare plays. Definitely an interesting read.

I just finished a Shakespeare class that was focused on the later plays, for university and I definitely gained a respect for him. I do agree, though, that the endings can be abrupt and I noticed this in many of his works. 

My personal favourite, however, was definitely Cymbeline. I enjoyed the message, it definitely felt more fresh and meaningful that there were so many different story lines and I think because of that, the story being told was more than just a rush to conflict and either a set of mass murders or a sudden, almost unrelated, resolution. 

I admire your efforts to read them all! I have two very large norton anthologies sitting in my bookcase that include all of his works, including the sonnets that I’m looking forward to one day getting through.

Edit: spelling mistake"
