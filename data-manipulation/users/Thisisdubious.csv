adhdmeme,ff7p9tk,t3_eryxm2,1579655029.0,The combination isn't the best because coffee is acidic and will lessen the effects of Vyvanse. Caffeine works better later in the day to help clean up adenosine and clear some brain fog built up. Doing both first thing in the morning is counterproductive.
KeanuBeingAwesome,ff4205v,t1_ff3x7ne,1579553812.0,"Totally agree. It's completely alien to hear people in middle-class and up holding onto that belief. Hating snitches is just a weird one-way code that people suddenly become hypocrites for when they're on the other side. ""No snitching"" as a code only holds up for the extremely poor, living in a poor community that are reliant on each other to get by, and have no intention or means of leaving the community. Even then, it's just beneficial to those at the top of those communities perpetuating the situation and threatening""or else"" as the alternative.

It's similar to the insult ""coward"". You really only hear that insult in connection when there's literally no valid argument to try and compel someone to act in direct opposite of self-preservation for no benefit (except maybe to the person hurling the insult). It's about as compelling of an argument as ""You should give me all your money, just because.""."
todayilearned,felc9pb,t1_fel65op,1579218800.0,"LPT: Discount any estimation of value given by other people by 50-75%, and for people prone to exaggeration and hyperbole use 80-90%.

The corollary for estimates on how much something will cost you, take the reciprocal. Whatever the cost is, start with 2-3x that base cost.

Source: I'm a financial analyst that often has to estimate things that I know nothing about, based on limited information from other people. This rule of thumb can make you look like a quick-witted genius with foresight and guide you to evaluating options with actual potential. It takes a lot of due diligence to prove out numbers that usually back up these guesses."
HydroHomies,fel9ks5,t1_fejy2gk,1579217047.0,"Thank you for doing the math. I was interpreting it as a ""can"" and using regular coke as a nutrition baseline and couldn't reconcile the numbers.

Another point to keep in mind, ~2 lbs. of sugar is roughly equal to a net 1 lbs. worth of calories. That 1 lb. of sugar could be stored in your body as 1 lb. of pure fat or stored as glycogen. Glycogen is 2-3 grams of water per 1g of carbs. That 1lb. of sugar could result in 3.5 lbs. of body weight."
GetMotivated,feb40u6,t1_featu6r,1578955249.0,"This is basically a false dilemma that newbies put on themselves. Why not aim somewhere in the middle of both? If you're just at the stage of  just talking about starting to gain muscle, you have enough runway to do both. There's a fair amount of learning curve in exercises/routines and adaption by your body's nervous system for strength before you get to actual muscle gains.  Plus if you have a surplus of fat to burn, then your muscles still have something to feed off, even if you're technically eating at a calorie deficit. It's commonly referred to as a recomposition. It's the trained and lean people that can't do a lot of both simultaneously because that would violate basic laws of thermodynamics.

Another newbie trap is thinking they've gain/lost muscle/fat in some small increment of time, like a few weeks or a single month. When you start working out, your muscles will swell and your weight might jump up 5 lbs in a week. That's not pure muscle gains as it's mostly water. So when taking 2 weeks off the gym, you didn't lose 5 lbs of muscle, your body just stopped holding onto as much water or swelling subsided. It's the same thing with losing fat. People will hit the cardio hard for their first week and shed water weight. The scale will be down temporarily and when the rebound in water weight happens (especially after a cheat meal or lax week), they think they gained it all back. 

During a recomp, the scale may not budge, but you can usually see a change in the mirror. The scale is just a tool to measure towards your goal. Short term tactics to move the number on the scale are at odds with the long term. Weight loss or muscle gain are a long game."

adhdmeme,fdkrwcy,t3_elk6v7,1578509875.0,Taking medication breaks is highly recommended by doctors. Does your mom also need to have a medical degree before you can see the logic? Medication is only PART of treatment. Practice other lifestyle discipline to develop practical habits with your down time.
todayilearned,fdemxrw,t1_fdehjhd,1578342409.0,"The first question was worded as an uncertain assertion more than asking an actual question. The hypothesis or proposition was untrue, so people down voted an incorrect statement. Asking questions is good, but phrasing makes all the difference."
