Unfortunately many universities still have a culture of trying to cover up cases. I'm sure it depends a lot on the campus, but in some places victims will be asked to go through an ""internal process"" first which may be both unproductive and to put it lightly, unpleasant. Or in a case like this, campus police may try to push you back to the housing office rather than just file a police report. 

It's not just campus police either, even if they were the correct ones to go to, if you contacted the housing office about stolen property they would likely try to resolve things without getting police involved. And people may not realize they could just go directly to the police. This also follows for ""mall cops""or security guards. 

Consider it a general warning when handling a crime that you should make sure you're aware of ALL your options, and who you're dealing with may have a vested interested in protecting entities (schools, businesses) as much as victims. You may be told a ""report"" is being filed but not realize it's a report in the school's judiciary system, not an actual police report. 

Don't get me wrong I'd go to housing, then campus police, then city depending to escalate until someone too me seriously. It never hurts to call the nonemergency line to ask."

ufl,ffs5180,t3_eusef5,1580173307.0,"If an offer will not tell you the name of the place you'll be working from the getgo, it's probably a scam. If you Google any company be aware they will try to flood out any claims it's a pyramid scam with claims to it isn't

Check out the slave circle on YouTube for an overview of one of the sneakier pyramid schemes that toes the line so close people get sucked in much easier. These places are very sneaky, engage in guilt like behavior, and the slimiest ones have learned to incorporate legit businesses practices into their pyramid bullshit. 

If you aren't sure it's a pyramid scheme it probably is."
ufl,ffs4ouu,t1_ffs1s12,1580173062.0,"Just don't go. They know a large portion of people scheduled to come won't show once they ask around and find out what it is. 

If they hit you up just say you got offered work on a lab on campus and will no longer have the time to pursue other opportunities. Block number and move on with your life. 

Even going makes it seem more legitimate to other people there. If only 2 people show suddenly flags start going up."
assholedesign,ffr1695,t3_eul0h9,1580148190.0,I'm really disgusted by this and I don't really know how to let Netflix know.
badroommates,ffr0s76,t1_ffquwbo,1580147942.0,Also casual reminder you don't have to go through campus police. They have incentive to minimize situations. If someone steals your shit file a report with the actual city police.
badroommates,ffr0oga,t3_euovdg,1580147876.0,"Frankly just keep bothering the office to say the behavior hasn't stopped and he no longer feels comfortable keeping his things in his dorm or returning there. He paid to have comfortable use of his dorm without being hassled. They'll try and ignore you the first 5 times but eventually they'll reconsider if they realize you aren't going to let up. If you try to be nice and are ignored, it's okay to start a fuss. 

Consider renters insurance to protect the computer. But your friend may want to reach out to any counseling services on campus. Not only can they help him be more assertive they probably have a lot of sway in getting things like this taken care of if they see it's affecting a student's performance."

science,ffpiuf6,t1_ffotc40,1580096087.0,"Reading the replies here resisting the urge to try and correct and clarify everything but it'd be like bailing out a boat with a thimble. 

Don't get me wrong I'm sure a mechanic hearing me talk about my car would feel the same way so I'm not judging. I don't know why it wouldn't work if I had 4 engines instead of 1 and I wouldn't understand if they tried to explain it."
science,ffphvus,t1_ffoyq8y,1580095438.0,Like people that act like dosing up on huge quantities of neurotransmitters is a good idea not realizing they're basically talking about cocaine.
science,ffphbg4,t1_ffp8k9q,1580095034.0,Probably very few oxytocin researchers specifically ( though I'm sure they exist ) anyone in a neuro research field probably also cringes so that might be what they meant.
askgaybros,ffnana3,t3_eu8ein,1580063763.0,"IMO she knows or at least suspects. 

Don't really see a lot of other people mentioning it but that doesn't necessarily mean she's suggesting you come out to her. Just that if and when you do, she'll support you.  

Talk to her whenever you're ready, but don't feel the need to come out if you aren't ready yet."
