OldSchoolCool,ffyzg71,t1_ffyym7j,1580359205.0,"People need to be educated as to WHY so many blacks are behind bars, or in gangs, or why so many black women bear children when unmarried.

When you live long enough to figure that out, things make sense and you learn that black people aren't somehow predisposed to gang life or whatever...it's the culture imposed on them by a bunch of shitty white racists.

Black people and white people both need to understand all of this to break the cycle.  But as we all know breaking the cycle is almost impossible.

I'm a white dude, and I can start with educating my kid and argue with the boomers in my life (in my experience Gen-X, Millennials, and Zoomers are far less racist) but it seems so futile.

As someone who has hired maybe 10 people...(I know look at me flex), NEVER accept the first offer even if you have no experience.  Most companies build in some negotiating room.  If a company WANTS you, they WANT you.  You have a little bargaining power there because of all the applicants, they want YOU.  So...bargain.

""I still have some interviews lined up but I like your corporate environment and plan to stay at this job for a long time.  I'm not interested in job hopping for higher salary.  I would be eager to cancel those interviews and accept your offer if we could agree on 10% more salary.""

""I understand I don't have much experience and things might not work out, so I could accept this lower salary through the probationary period.

So when you meet a new person...like holy shit...of the 7 BILLION on this planet *this person* will actually be in **your** life.  For example, when people list their greatest influence in a sport, or music, or acting...they usually list a famous athlete, or a famous rock star, or a famous actor, but really....think about it.

The greatest influence in your sporting life is probably your coach and your teammates.  Treat those people with an immense amount of respect if they are good.

The greatest influence in your musical life, is your music teacher.  Not Skrillex or Jimmy Page...it's Mr. Brown or whoever you meet with weekly to guide you on your musical journey.

Same with your acting coach...is your greatest influence *really* Robert DeNiro?  Or is it your teacher and your friends that are in the performance of Oklahoma you are putting on?

I'm a guitar student and my greatest influence is my teacher.  A humble dude who works hard.  I'm a Dad and my greatest influence is my wife and kid.  I'm a programmer and my greatest influence are my work mates.

I don't have severe clinical depression but I do have anxiety and I get pissed at myself for it all the time."
WinStupidPrizes,ff5trba,t1_ff5dn1q,1579609928.0,Seems like they were just going to leave it there too...unless there is an access road below or something.
PublicFreakout,ff5r2oe,t1_ff5gw7q,1579606879.0,"> Same reason there's so many child abuser or homosexual priests. 

Just to be clear...pedophiles became priests.  It wasn't like normal guys that weren't attracted to kids joined the priesthood then all of a sudden became pedophiles.

Same with homosexuals (though I'm not sure why you group them as you did).  If you were gay in the 60s, and Catholic, it was obviously a sin to have sex, ever.  Gay men were regularly told by their Priests to seek out the priesthood instead of acting on their urges."
worldnews,ff3xevo,t1_ff3n2os,1579550951.0,"I lived through the last correction.  KEEP YOUR MONEY IN during the correction.

I knew people that pulled their money out once they got burned, to “keep it safe because the market will never recover.”

I just kept buying on my normal schedule and have a very solid retirement fund now.  The people that kept it out never fully recovered."

Stop embellishing to make it seem overpriced.

/S (yep I capitalized it...I would *never* pay more than $1087.05 for a 5th)"
musictheory,ff2dr26,t1_ff2cnqf,1579501995.0,"I like a lot of Zappa...more of the instrumental stuff because his humor was sometimes *way* out there...

What album(s) are you talking about that chain stuff together in the same vein?"
Watches,ff2dn8d,t1_ff2azxu,1579501880.0,We are in agreement.  I'm not trying to put down either automatics (of which I own several) or quartz (of which I own several).  I was just trying to answer why I don't think enthusiasts get excited about quartz.
musictheory,ff29dej,t1_ff2434q,1579497679.0,Had that been done before...to that extent in pop music?  I guess a symphony could count as chaining a bunch of different songs/movements together...but in pop music specifically were they the first?
Watches,ff293md,t3_er7img,1579497429.0,"There is nothing complicated about quartz.  It's precise, durable, and cheap.  There is nothing to get ""enthused"" about for the ""enthusiast.""

Quartz watches will be cheaper and keep better time...but a watch enthusiast isn't going to marvel over your quartz watch if that's who you are trying to impress."
Guitar,ff22tm6,t1_ff22bks,1579492273.0,"I think we agree.  He's selling the guitars based on his name recognition as a YouTuber, and not on the instrument's own merit.  PRS and Leo sold them on their own merit as instruments (because they had zero name recognition when they started their business).

Pewdiepie and Logan Paul etc could sell just as many guitars (if not double or triple what Rob Chapman has sold) just because of their name recognition in the age category that spends tons of cash.  I agree they wouldn't call their brand anything but ""Logan Paul"" because you wouldn't want to throw that name recognition away.

I think you kinda rephrased my argument perfectly."
AskReddit,ff22cwg,t1_ff0mfqq,1579491919.0,Lol I would always put them back exactly where they were at when I put them in.  My Dad would not have been as cool as yours.  I had to cover my tracks like a damn porn ninja.
therewasanattempt,ff221jb,t1_ff1tw3l,1579491681.0,"My kid takes gymnastics.  He competes 5 times (which means trips, and hotel rooms, and hanging out with his teammates, all stuff kids love) a year and works out 10 hours a week.  He has a solid 2 pack and a back full of definition and he's not even 10 yet.

One day I was dropping off my kid at practice while another father was walking out with his little boy, after dropping off the boy's sister.  The little boy asked ""Can I do gymnastics Daddy?""  and he laughed and said ""No son, we'll find something more for boys...gymnastics isn't for boys.""

I wanted to give him a lecture but I immediately realized there is no talking to a person like that.  It just sucks that he took all that potential that his kid had and threw it away.   Meanwhile my kid and his teammates are having a killer time."

trippinthroughtime,ff1qwa2,t1_ff0n01z,1579484197.0,I bring in lots of alcohol into concerts/games using a plastic flask.  I can bring in $40 of bourbon for me and my friends that would cost $250 to buy in the damn venue.
