depression,fgkpy3p,t1_fgkjp9x,1580871032.0,"Agree 100% on the never returning to the way it was. I think once you’re on it long enough your brain is altered on some level.  My main desire to get off of them is because I feel tethered by them, and the 30 day refill issue. Basically it’s a lifetime of never being able to leave the states for 30 days, King of a bummer."
depression,fgkal25,t3_eywkpg,1580861115.0,"You can do it! I'm tapering down from Klonopin now and it's harder than alcohol was. Depression kicked in pretty strong starting in my mid 20's, 43 now. Today is day **2450** sober. Only substances I use now outside of the doctor prescribed stuff for depression/anxiety are nicotine and caffeine. It gets better :-)"
OldSchoolCool,fg0p4zm,t3_evyqe7,1580412285.0,This is a great story! Hadn't heard of it before. Makes me sad a bit as it reminds me of [this photo](https://me.me/i/raqiyah-mays-graqiyah-mays-notice-how-we-never-knew-trayvonmartin-10568358) of Trayvon Martin at Space Camp.

I wish I had read it before my now former marriage. It really lets you see that there may be compatibility issues underlying romance."

depression,ffqbw2w,t3_euicer,1580129696.0,"I fired a few 2 weeks ago. A little sad about it for a day or two. After that it’s like a weight lifted, great decision in retrospect even though it was done during a heated argument confronting them about the OP’s topic specifically."

It was “fun” during the last days of my drinking, but also so fatalistic that it motivated me to get sober."
depression,feios01,t3_enrs4c,1579143510.0,"I can relate, it's between a rock and a hard place for me. I can tell when a friend is getting overloaded with my toxicity of varying levels. Then I usually pull back and just share with my therapist (and AA sponsor, sober 6.5 yrs). What ends up happening is I don't want to go to group stuff because I don't want to be toxic, but then friends start to resent me not participating/hanging out, I feel shitty, get more depressed, and then isolate more. It's a negative feedback loop for me."

confidence,fe69vs4,t3_enopwc,1578885036.0,"It's not your job to fix her, and you will never be able to. Her feelings about herself are not her fault, but they are her responsibility if she desires to change them. She may benefit from therapy, something a partner cannot provide.

Her body image has nothing to do with what *you* think about how she looks, it has everything to do with how *she* thinks she looks."
