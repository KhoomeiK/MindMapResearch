 Why shouldn't such a responsibility fall to government that we all contribute to, to solve the problem which effects all of us?

 Why shouldn't government, the institution which builds vital infrastructure like roads, public transport and, sewers, build the desperately needed homes and apartments the residents require if no one else will?

Ever since the tech boom started in the 90s large number of people with more money have moved in and not enough units have been constructed to suit their demand which is causing the poor to be displaced out.
AskAnAmerican,fehuyg8,t3_ep2otd,1579124381.0,"Profiting from other people's failure. We have a ton of land and resources which we got by war and theft from people weaker then ourselves. We brought in huge waves of people with fleeing the rising poverty of Europe really starting with the 1840s caused by crop failures especially of the potato harvests. This gave us a large population of people who were poor willing to do anything and had skills at the same time. 

We have a common market which lets trade flow throughout and one language. You know why facebook didn't come from Europe? too many languages to make it appealing to the entire EU. No way to spread word of mouth about it because each language keeps gossip about stuff in that language and prevents viral growth. 


Also while others have mentioned that we haven't face devastating wars in the 20th century they forget to mention that the US financed those devastating wars  and financed that winning sides both times. Before WW1 the US was a debtor nation it owed other countries. By the end of WW2 the US had acquired so much of the world's gold that other countries money had to be redeemed in US dollars and the US dollar could be redeemed for gold."
news,fehsvdg,t1_fehmmwo,1579123200.0,"So the high income housing bracket of the city has been exploding. But construction hasn't been so high that they satisfy demand. So people from the top lower their sights a bit and raise the prices of the top end of the next tier of the housing market, which raises the price of that tier. This pushes people out of that tier down and the cycle continues until people are pushed onto the streets. No one wants to build homes for the low end of the market because they make less money. And its not like the people on the lowest end can do anything to stop becoming homeless because by not selling, they rent they don't own the buildings that are being sold."
news,fehs3gm,t1_fehmjmq,1579122766.0,"This isn't about these particular people but about the housing situation in the City and the State. Homelessness has increased by 16.9% according to the article. There are a few possible reasons for this. Possibility 1 a large people moved in that could never have afforded to live there and decided be homeless. Possibility 2 people who have lived there for an extended period maybe their entire lives have been priced out where they live because no units they could afford have been built.

While some places have decided to use San Francisco as a dumping ground for their homeless it isn't 16.9% of the previous homeless population bad. Which leaves us with prices have vastly outstripped the wages explanation.

The almost all of new housing that is being constructed is for a luxury market costing far outside of what workers can afford. Unless the builders of these units turn out to be complete morons they will keep supply of these new units at rate below that of the demand for these units. Other wise prices will fall and profits harmed. This pushes people who wanted but can't afford those units down to a lower price point and drives up that market and this cascading effect until those at the bottom are forced out completely. No one builds for those at the bottom because why bother when you could make more by targeting those higher brackets of the market."

Parliament also precipitated the conflict by bringing foreign mercenaries to what was a set of protests.
