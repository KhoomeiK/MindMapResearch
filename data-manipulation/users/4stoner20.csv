depression,ff78fbv,t1_ff788ab,1579643164.0,"I've had some great people in my life and still pushed them away. I think my subconscious does this to keep me isolated and depressed. 


Depression is toxic af."
depression,ff701q0,t3_es0dz5,1579638408.0,Big same here. I hate myself and have pushed everyone I can away. I hate it all.
depression,ff6zxmm,t3_es0eh8,1579638340.0,"I've turned into someone I dont recognize. I've disintegrated my 4 year relationship with the love of my life. I'm moving out of our home and into a room my friends offered me. My job is a mediocre part time retail job. I'd love to kill myself but lack the courage. I wish I had good days but for me those are the days I can actually pretend I'm ok. Bad days are full of crying, anxiety, nausea, and countless paybacks of all my fuckups. 

If you see yourself getting bad reach out. Do anything you can to feel better and overcome this disease. It's awful and I wish you the best in your recovery."
depression,ff6yf2x,t1_ff6xhv8,1579637453.0,You're not wrong unfortunately
depression,ff6selm,t3_erzcp1,1579633905.0,"Doctors do what they think is best. Even if the facility is shit. Honestly I'd love to check in and take a breather from the world. Like the post i saw talking about a physical disability instead of an invisible one. Depression is stupid and my brain is stupid and I wish I had answers. 
Sorry this doesnt even make sense...."
depression,fefndrb,t1_fefmx3q,1579060111.0,"I recently started watching mind seed tv. Love slapped ham, chills, and the paranormal files."
depression,fefmt2y,t1_fefmnyj,1579059731.0,Anything paranormal. The best of reddit stuff. Makeup tutorials. Sometimes tiktok compilations lol
depression,fefmll6,t3_eowbs3,1579059592.0,I watch A LOT of YouTube. And smoke weed.
Eyebleach,fdw788e,t3_en8i99,1578755813.0,Stunning!!!!!
depression,fds1a1g,t3_emxid6,1578692776.0,Being divorced doesnt change who you are. Meaning if you meet someone and vibe your past shouldn't matter too much. If you did your best then screw your ex wife. I wish I had more encouraging things to say but just know you're not alone.
depression,fdoamme,t1_fdlq4rz,1578601758.0,I actually like ig. I can follow pages about my hobbies and get lost in the video threads lol
depression,fdlp5z2,t3_em1ggo,1578529174.0,Reddit is the best social media imo. Deleted fb the other day because it just depresses me more.
depression,fdkskeh,t1_fdks49y,1578510273.0,I could probably improve my life as well if I tried long enough. And i also feel my best years have been wasted. I'm almost 30 and still feel like a lost child. I never even enjoyed my teen years. I've always been the new kid and never stayed long enough to matter. Now that I'm back in my childhood town it all feels so out of place. I hate all of it and I wanna leave so bad but I cant hold onto money. Either by my decisions or bills or my car. I'm just stuck.
depression,fdklt38,t1_fdkgndn,1578506208.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you find your way out of the abuse. 

I don't understand the being strong thing. Maybe its cause we get up and keep going. Idk."
depression,fdk8nvj,t3_elufjq,1578498588.0,I smoke weed and have been drinking more heavily lately. I feel good in those inebriated moments.
depression,fdk7pnb,t1_fdjqyzi,1578497981.0,"I hear a lot that people with depression are strong because of what we endure. I dont feel strong. I feel like a shell of a person dragging along. I feel like a drain on society because I contribute nothing. My parents dont care about my depression or longing for suicide. I feel my bf only cares because he doesnt want to be left in the world alone. I wanna be better and be a human again. How can people keep saying ""it'll get bettet"" when the truth is that it doesn't get better for everyone. Some of us are destined to be depressed and suicidal all our lives.


Also sorry for the rant. I'm struggling really bad lately."
depression,fdh8yfj,t3_elecx3,1578417958.0,"You just described me. To a t. I lash out because I have no clue what's going on in my head and its so frustrating. My bf has dealt with it for years but recently I can see the toll its taking on him. I want out but he swears it's ok and he can deal and we should be together. I cant keep hurting him so I'm sure this year will be our last together. 

I'm sorry this had happened to you.  I wish there was an explanation or solution. Unfortunately depression ravages the mind til reality and illness combine. Then it's done. Feels impossible to come back from."
depression,fdh7x51,t3_elee1n,1578417309.0,Big same. If anyone has any answers or suggestions please share.
depression,fdh6il6,t1_fdh64jz,1578416437.0,Sure. Music is always good (:
depression,fdh62fp,t1_fdh5fz7,1578416159.0,Eh. Binge watching tv makes me feel more lonely. I mostly watch YouTube while scrolling another app. Anything to get the most distraction from life.
TikTokCringe,fdh4b2c,t1_fdh17nm,1578415079.0,"Its incredibly ignorant of you to perpetuate that black people or any poc cant enjoy or listen to heavier or emo music. Comments like yours are the reason people still think it's ok to say ""wow you act so white."""
depression,fdh3zkb,t3_eldosy,1578414884.0,I deactivate/delete facebook on and off. Honestly not having it makes me feel a little better. Seeing others achievements and knowing I have zero is always hard. I come here and scroll insta(less toxic). Do whatever you think will help you (within reason).
depression,fdgvehs,t3_elc78c,1578409284.0,"I fear me and my man of 4 years are at an end. I wish there was a fix-all for these times but there isnt. Best to put your time and energy into work or hobbies. It wont ease the pain but it will distract your mind until it doesnt hurt so bad. 
Biggest issue for me is that I only have but like 2 friends so distractions arent easily found.



Also, considering dating women now lol"
depression,fdc4xss,t3_ekkti7,1578267188.0,I would. Unfortunately I'm also in a shit state of mind and I'm not much help.
curlyhair,fcikw64,t1_fciimnt,1577664263.0,Eco makes a curl complex smoothie that gives me moisture and a nice cast.
depression,fcikqt9,t3_ehdmk8,1577664194.0,If you need help tell someone. Dont be coy. Confide in someone you trust with your life and tell them what you need.
cringepics,fcijp3h,t1_fcijhjj,1577663685.0,This needs intensive therapy...
cringepics,fcijeri,t3_ehdog4,1577663548.0,This is the only type of kink/lifestyle I shame lmao
curlyhair,fcij9c5,t3_ehdowx,1577663472.0,"Even if your routine isn't 100% ""curly girl approved"" I'm sure you'll find lots of new techniques and ideas to help your curls. I still shampoo regularly and use non cg products but just changing the application and how and when I use them has helped so much. 


Best of luck to you!!!"
depression,fciiuiv,t1_fcib0fw,1577663272.0,"This group is full of people who have no hope for themselves but wish wellness and health on others. It's the nature depression, it seems. 
Been trying for a long time (al of my 20s. I'm 27) to feel genuine happiness or delight. It's rare and mostly I just want to stop existing."
depression,fci3d83,t3_ehbyro,1577657278.0,"I feel the same. Wanted to for a long time but never can commit. This past week I've come close, with all the holidays and social media pressures. Plus my own brain making things feel so out of reach. 

Maybe one day we'll find reasons to hang on indefinitely."
depression,fci0794,t3_egzqgq,1577656191.0,"I've never been a cutter but will slap and punch the shit outta myself when I lose control. Went quite a bit with no bruises or welts and the other day I broke down. As soon as I was alone I started punching and slapping as hard as I could. Def left some bruises and handprints. Sometimes the physical harm is a good escape when i know I cant kill myself. 

Not at all condoning self harm in any way but its better than the alternative."
depression,fc5wbbe,t1_fc5q2co,1577467264.0,Oh no. I wish I had the right words and wisdom but unfortunately I would be dead long ago if not for my boyfriend.
depression,fc4ae19,t1_fc47t9b,1577410987.0,I'm glad you have a reason to be here <3
depression,fc2uzr3,t3_efwqy4,1577374773.0,"I feel the same. Especially now at the holidays. None of this matters. The presents. The fake sense of ""family."" I've been fighting depression off for the last month and now its hit me all at once. I'd love to kill myself and be done but then the stigmas and ""what about your loved ones?"" 
To that I say, why should I hurt for my whole life when they can grieve a little and move on....

Sorry to rant on your post."
