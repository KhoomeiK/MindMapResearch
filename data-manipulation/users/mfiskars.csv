DIY,ff3wjd0,t3_erij83,1579550396.0,"I have a water softener and before the water softener I have a activated carbon filter. I would recommend installing a particulate filter after these two systems for that one slim chance the “mesh” inside either one of these breaks and all the resin/carbon ends up clogging your faucets. 
If you are pretty tight on money try investing on a water tank you can pump the treated water from. Instead of having a big softener and activated filter working on demand. Use the tank to treat the daily consumption at a slower rate with smaller filters. 
Also recomendable to purchase and install a REverse ósmosis system for drinking. 
Activated carbon can be recycled by boiling it in water for idk 15-30 mins. Keeps the carbon with a better efficiency.
