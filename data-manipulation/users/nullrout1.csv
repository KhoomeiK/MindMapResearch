RealEstate,fff8lbw,t3_et674g,1579878415.0,"Well, I'll give you my take on working for the Federal government as I can't speak to local or state.  Background.  I've been a employee of the fed gov for seventeen years.

In my field (IT) I don't make as much as I possible could in private industry.  However, I'm okay with that as I made a compromise to play the ""long game"".  I have a defined pension plan that while it could change, typically the gov changes it going forward and grandfathers existing employees into the ""old"" way of things.  

The job is really stable, probably almost too stable as a gov't employee you see people who should have been fired years ago but instead just get bounced around.  We literally had someone who was coming in at 10:30, getting ready in the bathroom for an hour, sleeping in their car during the day, and leaving at 2:30.  Took them almost two years to can her.

So you'll deal with a ton of bureaucracy, see stupid things with regularity that you can't change, but there are benefits like stability, pension, decent insurance etc."

RealEstate,ffdaoc4,t3_eszgry,1579816770.0,"Well...I'll start out by saying this sucks, and I'm sorry you were blindsided.

However, no one really purposely mislead you.  However, your agent knowing that you were a first time homeowner should have walked you through filing the exemption...the standard exemption is worth $500 if memory serves me right.

However, this is not the whole story here.  The homestead exemption also limits how much your taxes can up per year.  The longer you live in a house, the more benefit this part provides.

So if let's say previous buyer lived there for 40 years, the house was assessed at a really low number.  Say they bought for 50k in 1980, with the cap provided by homestead, their assessed value now could be say 120k while the fair market might be 300k.  The 300k is what you as a new buyer would start out with as your value.

Also as a first timer your loan officer and agent should both have told you to expect this because it surprises lots of people.  Sounds like you had a crappy agent and or loan officer, but legally...yeah they did nothing wrong and I wouldn't expect anyone to be liable for the mistake.  You just ran into the crap-sandwich side of real estate."

I sold a couple of investments and bought the land for cash.  You can also get a personal loan for whatever the difference is between your on hand cash and what you would need to close.  It will be a higher rate than a 30yr mortgage.  AMEX keeps sending me ""personal loan at 6.99%"" letters so something like that is also an option.

My lender took the lower of the appraised value or paid value of the land and computed it as equity in the final house.

Construction loans are typically interest only (on whatever is paid out to date) during construction then convert to a traditional loan at the end.

ETA: Forgot the closer option, New Bern is a nice close visit.  Downtown was very nice to park and walk back when I was there.  I just looked and my favorite New Bern place is still there: Captain Rattys."

Some of this is just home ownership stuff breaking and cost over-runs.  Some of it is the result of craptacular flipping.  This doesn't help you know, but I would never recommend a flip for first time buyers.  You don't know what you don't know when it comes to what to expect.

Just know it should get better with time.  You've learned an important lesson, no budget survives first contact with the enemy.  Incorrect installation is common in today's environment PERIOD.  I had to go back and correct multiple things not done to spec or manufacturer's instructions on a brand new build.  My experience says you have to keep on top of your contractors or they'll run you over rough-shod. 

Good luck moving forward."
RealEstate,feajrhg,t1_fe91o6o,1578949659.0,This is probably hit or miss and highly localized.

You don't have to do anything and the next person gets a credit towards the flooring of his or her choice.

Some people might not be able to see past it but this is what my agent told me last year when I had 14 year old carpet that I couldn't stand.  I wanted to have it cleaned before showing and I was told don't waste the money."
RealEstate,fe5gxbv,t3_enth90,1578869299.0,"In general:

Pay off high interest loans first.  Low interest loans can stay depending on their rates.  If the loan is less than you earn in investments it's better to invest the money and pay off the loan at it's regular interval.

After this, save, save, save.  Depending on your timeline for buying you should be keeping in safe if your timeline is sooner something like a money market saving or maybe a short-term bond fund if a little longer.  If it is further down the road, say 5 years or more, a low-cost diversified portfolio would be the way to fly IMO.

The more you have saved for a down payment give you more flexibility.  Lenders will also view you as less risky and typically offer you better rates with higher down payments.

And as others have said, buying a house with a unmarried partner complicates things if you ever split.  If you do decide to move forward without being married you need to have an ironclad agreement that clearly states the terms of the purchase and what happens if you guys part ways."

personalfinance,fe5099s,t3_enmpqw,1578864486.0,I think the first thing you should know is you can't really do anything for him legally if you don't have power of attorney.  You can recommend whatever you want but the choice is up to him to actually do said things.
