Anticonsumption,ffc0d72,t1_ffbvy31,1579788290.0,"People mostly follow what they're told to follow, I agree. But that makes them very susceptible to being swayed into doing the right thing. There are plenty of influential people who aren't representing a disgusting organisation. Look how fashionable veganism is now. If enough people who the followers find attractive get on board, there can be a revolution in the way we consume as a demographic. Companies will then alter their approach to reach these people. If that means cleaning up their act so we'll buy their particular brand of selfie stick, so be it."

science,ffbt0jj,t1_ffb6luc,1579781658.0,"Usually though, there is an evolutionary benefit to these things, even if we don't know what it is yet. Grey hair could be a sign of maturity in a social animal that values experience in their leaders, for example. Balding could be similar, and since it has been attributed to types of testosterone, it could mean there are other beneficial hormonal traits that it signifies."

vegan,ff97gd1,t1_ff940zs,1579706614.0,"Well I definitely wouldn't say the US is as civilised as central European countries either, but if you think the US is comparable to Uganda, perhaps you should try living there."
vegan,ff8u50n,t1_ff8pykl,1579696168.0,Of course it's reasonable. I think there's a strong case of the 'noble savage' fallacy going on here.
vegan,ff8ra55,t1_ff8lyex,1579692887.0,"There has been a [Civilising Process](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Civilizing_Process) in the West that's responsible for a lot of the societal benefits we can enjoy. This has implications for political and social aspects of the culture. It's not unreasonable to suggest that civilisation has a direction away from violence and towards equality. In this sense there is a timeline, and on this timeline, Uganda is farther back than a lot of countries by these metrics. You might argue that animals are mistreated in the US, but it is a step forward to do it in secret. In Uganda animals are barely recognised as anything but tools. I know a woman who set fire to her cat because she didn't want it anymore. They poison street dogs when their numbers get too high. Pigs are strapped, screaming, to the backs of motorcycles for transport. I could go on.. the point is, you can romanticise 'developing' countries and say that they're a different kind of civilised but in a lot of ways they just aren't."

There's too much misinformation spread by people who sound like they know what they're talking about and it's just a case of respecting the reader to give them the source of your information to assess for themselves."
science,fek2v5r,t1_fejtjlb,1579191440.0,I run a conservation project for one of the last remaining patches of combined mountain and lowland rainforest. I train poachers to live more sustainably and work to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. Obviously I don't expect everyone to do that but I don't think my expectations are too high when I say I'd like to at least see a more proactive attitude in internet comments.
science,fek27s7,t1_fejw4km,1579191041.0,Oh absolutely. I haven't ever argued that we are 100% in control of this. Corporations have a disproportionate amount of power and the same lack of responsibility as we are demonstrating as consumers. I'm not suggesting a dichotomy here. But look at the uproar when it's suggested that people could be making more of an effort.
science,fejqxya,t1_fejqcf7,1579183627.0,"You're not one person. You have influence. If you stop eating meat, it's not going to get picked up on the agricultural industry census but if you tell people about it, a few will join you. If they tell people about it, a few will join them. If you start social groups to spread information, you'll reach people. Perhaps eventually you can arrange boycotts and strikes and actually start voting with your wallet in numbers that have an impact. By all means vote, but if all you're trying to do to go against the impending catastrophe takes a total of a quarter of an afternoon once every two years, you aren't really in a position to blame anyone else.

Edit: I shouldn't have to explain this but apparently I do: taking responsibility does not mean absolving corporations. Of course they should be held responsible; I'm just saying you damn well should be too."
science,fejpwgz,t1_fejntx9,1579182809.0,And the rest of us found it easier to blame old rich people than take any responsibility ourselves. So we kept working for and buying from old rich people and deflecting the blame upwards.

worldnews,fdangu7,t1_fdahwn2,1578247997.0,"Mutually assured destruction, and it's a good theory, but if you read The Better Angels of our Nature, it goes into a lot of detail in its criticisms of the belief that nukes make the world safer, or reduce conflict, even between superpowers. It's well worth a read, despite being very long.

I don't agree that it's a predominantly British bird. For one thing, it's a partially migrant species. There are *Motacilla alba* populations all over the world, but many *yarrellii* populatoins tend to winter in mainland Europe and North Africa and populate Northern Europe during the Summer, as far up as Iceland.

It's good to use taxonomic names when talking about animals because they're the same in every language!"
motorcycles,fcx42am,t1_fcwqk0w,1578050318.0,I think it's just a shoulder check. A lifesaver is when changing position on the road whilst moving. You don't look as far back for a lifesaver; it's essentially just a blind spot check.
Awwducational,fcmores,t1_fcmcjwi,1577784730.0,"They're not exactly elusive. I'm working on human-wildlife conflict with them at the moment and they're a pain in the ass for farmers. If you're researching them, they're quite easy to find. The national parks always know where they are, and they leave a pretty clear trail of destruction and poop in their wake. I would say the hardest part about studying them is their aggression but I've known an awesome machete-wielding japanese woman who was able to observe them very closely, so I guess even that depends on your approach."
