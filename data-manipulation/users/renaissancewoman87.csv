It's different products and they do not own the likeness of the conversation hearts design. This is a flex and a way to bully the indie brand. A grade A trash move."
BeautyGuruChatter,ffjnuq0,t3_etu1tz,1580002577.0,How do people support the Kardashians through all this fuckery?
BeautyGuruChatter,ffemtzr,t1_ff9m5uc,1579854953.0,I saw someone put one of her ig lingerie photos next to mewtwo for a meme and I haven't been able to unsee it.
BeautyGuruChatter,ffem3fk,t3_es3tat,1579853924.0,"This may just be me, but I'm really not in to the highlight she puts on the apples of her cheeks. It looks especially weird to me now since she has done so much cheek filler."
BeautyGuruChatter,ffdxtyh,t3_eswuml,1579831612.0,This video made me want blue hair.
BeautyGuruChatter,ff3q6s6,t1_ff3pz7m,1579546478.0,"With this being said, I am not responding another comment to your white knighting for JC in a thread about how MEN are valued more than women in this industry. Ridiculous."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff3pz7m,t1_ff3p0yx,1579546350.0,"Your complaint is that there are other overrated male beauty gurus but your suggestion to sub out JC, a good example of the topic at hand, with J* who is just as overrated? 

J* is not known for tutorials, he has not been the face of a massive campaign (Morphe is not the same as being the first male CoverGirl), and finally there is no reason to mention Jeffree just because I mention James.  I used James because he is who I personally think of when I think of white, male, beauty gurus known for their makeup application."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff3jzt2,t1_ff3jsf8,1579542674.0,"I do know that, but he is the white, male, bg with the most subscribers on the platform which is why I used his name. He is also the former face of a huge brand and someone many people claim have above par skills and technique."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff3izfp,t1_ff1y6b1,1579542057.0,"People are still waiting on black Friday merch...
J* isn't so much better as he is better at silencing people."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff3ig5y,t1_ff2pusu,1579541727.0,That's so true about the tips. I worked in a restaurant and we had one male waiter - who was shit - and he made more than the older ladies who had worked there for years and knew orders by heart.

AdviceAnimals,ff28j1e,t3_er72tt,1579496921.0,Lmfao. Me.
BeautyGuruChatter,ff28eag,t3_er4zt6,1579496804.0,"I love men in makeup having space and representation. I don't love that they are automatically seen superior because they are males. Sorry, there is nothing James Charles does technique wise that can't be done just as well by one of the female makeup artists. The men at the top of the beauty sphere aren't up there because of their talent, if that were the case then drag makeup artists would be at the top because that is some straight damn artistry. They're up there because of social climbing and marketing."
BeautyGuruChatter,ff272c4,t1_ff25t8v,1579495663.0,"Right? I saw the photo and I was like damn girl, you got me feeling a certain kinda of way. Looking gorg."
language_exchange,fewzyve,t3_eqapls,1579422092.0,"Well, I came here for Spanish, but I have been very very very slowly learning Korean for a few months. If you are still looking for a person, I would be interested.

Edit: Just noticed it said DM."
BeautyGuruChatter,fewzkor,t1_fewf7p5,1579421914.0,"Some do, most don't. It's a risky move that can pay off but not near as much or as reliably as other investment options. Now, if you just really love bags - go on. It's something you like, so it makes sense as it will add value and happiness to your life. But, if you're just looking at it for investment your money could be better served elsewhere."
BeautyGuruChatter,fevlnw7,t3_eqn29b,1579398803.0,"Does anyone else have the feeling that 2019 brought Jeffree all the way up and now 2020 is set for his fall? Just from what I've noticed online, more and more people seem to be so over this kind of behavior. The general public is seeming to move to a more conscious trend in spending and flex culture is increasingly being looked at as pathetic and inauthentic. Posts like this show that Jeffree is slipping behind the times. It will be interesting to see if he evolves with the current climate or stays as he is now. 

I may be totally wrong, but this is just a feeling I have had kicking around about him for the past few months. I feel like after the Shane series the shift has gotten faster and more noticeable to the point I believe it may affect Shane as well."
BeautyGuruChatter,feuov6r,t3_eqboqm,1579388612.0,"My top lip is a bit thin, but has a very sharp cupid's bow. My lower lip is pouty. I just put lipstick on as normal."
BeautyGuruChatter,feuneiv,t1_feufxkz,1579388220.0,They're actually not that great of an investment. No financial advisor is going to tell you to sink money into designer goods.
BeautyGuruChatter,feun984,t3_eqn29b,1579388165.0,I would like to have the money to travel but spending money on pink cars and hand bags just seems stupid to me.
BeautyGuruChatter,feojtgn,t1_feobsf7,1579301132.0,People get burned out of excess collabs. It's nice though that each of her collabs have been a bit different and with different kind of price points.
BeautyGuruChatter,fentw86,t3_eq1pyw,1579290680.0,Everytime I hear about Alissa Ashley it's because she's complaining about something? Is she just a crabby person or do people just not care about her until she does something like this?
BeautyGuruChatter,fent2na,t3_epwydf,1579290362.0,Living fast and loose with your face. I research everything I put on my skin.
BeautyGuruChatter,fej9kkg,t3_epcm3h,1579162886.0,"I love Pony, but damn how many collabs is this in a 6 month period?"
