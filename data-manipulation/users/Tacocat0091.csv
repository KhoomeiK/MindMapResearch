Aerials,ffjdrxh,t3_etx6zf,1579996146.0,This is something I'm struggling with! How long did it take you?
Aerials,ff0z2ox,t3_eqq01a,1579473703.0,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J2Z5DBM/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apap_jlsHpMpYsiNq8

I use these. They fit very well and I like the Wireless because I would get my old pair caught then accidentally remove them mid piece. Not fun. 

Also, you can get a headband to keep them in for flips as a fail safe."
UXDesign,fepi24h,t1_fep9azt,1579321040.0,"So I find (in my area at least) they tend to use meet up instead of Facebook. So try to that too! I also don't get on Facebook so that's not gonna stop you!

I suggest a recruiter. Find some ux recruiter websites (like Hays or Tek systems). They tend to have a lot more contract roles in my experience"
UXDesign,fep85je,t3_eqa5h9,1579314290.0,"Are you doing any networking? Going to events like Ixda or Ladies that UX (these are the only two in my area, but you can find more!) Can help get that connection to get you past that 3 year ""requirement""

Also, I think you SHOULD got for those contract jobs. Yeah, they may not be secure, but you will learn a ton from doing something like a 3 month contract. And then take that knowledge, up your portfolio and you could have an easier time finding a job. I know many ux designers who went that route. They all had full time gigs within a year of their first contact."
UXDesign,feeasdb,t1_fecek0u,1579029925.0,"Oh hello fellow Atlanta person! I also do not have a degree. I did the GA online course, and I am now in year 3 of my ux career. :) I actually got a job while I was taking the course. But I will be honest, it was a lot of hard work to get said job. I did a lot of self training and did a ton of projects on my own to show my skills. It's hard, but can be done!!!"
Aerials,fdnmu36,t3_ec144p,1578589079.0,"So I just bought an A frame for my Lyra! I've bought a spanset for my Lyra, and I'm wondering if anyone can direct me to Tutorials on how to properly tie a spanset to and A frame? I tried googling... But I seem to be struggling."
Aerials,fdbh3lc,t3_ek48ud,1578257333.0,"I want to perform this year on Lyra. Ive been working on a piece and its almost done, but I'm super nervous to do it (I've only been practicing aerial for 5 months)

I also want to do a roll! Like just one. I've really struggled with those. So hopefully I'll be able to do more than one by the end of the year."
AskReddit,fcv64c6,t1_fcv3zxg,1577995427.0,"Agreed! 

I really do hope things get better for you and these women stop being terrible towards you. I don't know you, but you deserve to live a life where you don't have to worry about that. I wish you luck! And if shit gets too hard, please feel free to reach out!!! I'm always down to listen"
AskReddit,fcv39rp,t1_fcv1eie,1577993749.0,"I didn't say it wasn't. :) Shaming people make or female is toxic and not okay (u less you are shaming them for being a Nazi... Then that's okay)

I'm sorry people are shaming you. They shouldn't do that. Just don't shame them in return. Then you create a cycle of hate or something."
Aerials,fcuzy4i,t3_eig23c,1577991847.0,I love this! You look so happy too!
AskReddit,fcuzfkg,t1_fcut3ge,1577991571.0,Aren't you kinda doing the same thing by putting them down for wearing scantily clothing to catch the eye of a guy with their curves??? Like I'm not excusing them being rude to you (fuck them) but you putting them down is doing the same.
Aerials,fcr6tm6,t3_eddma1,1577897620.0,"Everyone else covered all of my tips, but I do have one more to add for facial expressions: learn to be vulnerable. Sometimes, the movement/facial look amazing because the performer is literally giving you their heart and soul. Have you ever heard someone sing live and you just want to cry? But someone else will song that exact same song and you will feel nothing? It's because one is being Vulnerable. And we as an audience can feel that and feel all the emotions a perfromer is putting out there. 

Tips to becoming vulnerable: 
Practice! Get comfortable doing it on your own. Maybe play the song you want to perform to and just move and feel. Then maybe do that with a friend watching. It's hard, but I find when you are watching someone with a good level of vulnerability, even if their movements aren't technical or ""pretty"" the performance will sti be amazing."
cats,fcr5nft,t1_fcr3vlg,1577897137.0,Good! And she should keep that a secret. I just want to know that she has the cats with him! I need that happy ending! Lol
Aerials,fcr5hj1,t1_fcmmjqx,1577897065.0,"I believe Escalade climbing gym is the Kennesaw aerial place you're thinking of? They do a lot of silks, but not much else."
cats,fcqs0sj,t1_fcqrgfi,1577891306.0,I just hope that when those kitties passed they got the same resting spot as him. Where ever that may be.
cats,fcqguch,t1_fcq2d2x,1577885747.0,Well now you have to listen to the song! (Freddie wrote a song called Delilah about his cat. It's on the innuendo album)
Aerials,fclj7lv,t1_fcldjzv,1577749048.0,Yes very! I hope you make it to a class soon! Inspire is a great community. :) Everyone is so happy for you to be there and excited to see you work!
Aerials,fcl84iq,t1_fckqu0s,1577741866.0,"So! You take an intro class for an apparatus you're interested in (silk, Lyra, trapeze). After that one class you will be placed in the beginners class. (For silks, your next level would be the hammock classes.) 

Now, to move to silks 100 (the level after hammock) you need to be able to a list of moves (without struggle) Which you will learn in your hammock class. They have open practice times so then you can practice what you've learned. Some people will stay in hammock for many months, some for two months. It's about what you have time for/ willing to put in and how much practice you commit too. 

Does that answer your question? :)"
Aerials,fcl7nv0,t1_fckp229,1577741580.0,Oh okay! Didn't know that.
Aerials,fcl7md4,t1_fcko35p,1577741554.0,"Um ouch. That puts a real bad taste in my mouth. Like I said, I've only done the Lyra classes, and that instructor would NEVER do something like that. I'm sorry you experienced that level of bull!

I highly recommend inspire. They have a very open community."
Aerials,fckfvjc,t3_ehmx1z,1577724409.0,"Inspire and Challenge are the two I go to.

 I personally prefer Inspire. They have a very good intro class. I recommend Sandra's intro class. :) Also Inspire has very clear steps and goals to getting to the next level. 

I can't comment on challenge's silks as I've only gone there for Lyra."
Aerials,fckfnqt,t1_fcka2zr,1577724269.0,Aren't they closed?
relationships,fbysro8,t1_fbyddk0,1577225348.0,I'm surprised no one else is commenting on her not being okay with him spending the night when drunk. Especially since she's basically telling him to come home at 12am and to figure out how to get home.
