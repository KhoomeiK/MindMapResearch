Only thing is, FDR was in a wheelchair and couldn't cut across the garden to get to the treasury. So they built tunnels."

For more theatre specific, I like TagNotate for line notes. You can upload the script as a PDF and give line notes electronically. You can sort by person, meaning each person gets their own line notes over email. No one can say you didn't give them because you have an email chain, and no more filling out lots of little slips!"

techtheatre,fc3mayl,t3_efzicr,1577393097.0,"High school production of grease. My title was stage manager, but I acted more like a stage manager and production manager (when I was allowed to). All of the designers were adults who worked semi-professionally. Director, choreographer and music director were all semi professionals as well. 


Here is my train wreck 

Set- finished opening night. Run crew had not gotten a chance to work with it. 

Lights- finished 2 nights before opening night. Didn’t have enough DMX for all of the LEDs, so they flashed throughout the show. 

Spotlight ops- one left mid show. I had to send my board op to replace them and I ran the light board myself. 

Sound- multiple cues missing. I had to do a cue VOG. 

Actors- rude as hell (one told me I was a horrible stage manager and that everyone hated me. Why? Because she didn’t want to do a lift call). Changed fight choreography without telling director, stage manager (me), or fight coordinator.  

Director- didn’t care that actors were being rude. Came backstage after first show and told tech “that was horrible”. (I was very upset about that) 

If the adults had communicated their needs better, and if we were able to actually create a real production schedule, I think it could have been much better. But there was a lack of communication, and I was kept out of the loop for most things. There were production meetings that I was not allowed to come to, technical conversations I wasn’t filled in on, etc. I won’t say that I was perfect through the whole thing, but I wish I could have had more support from the adults."
techtheatre,fc3kvgk,t1_fc3fq46,1577392081.0,"I had a similar thing! Lost power a few minutes before curtain. We weren’t sure if it would come back on and we would be able to do the show or if it would stay out. So the band played some music, the actors sang some, and kept everyone entertained until we knew if the power was coming back (it wasn’t)."
