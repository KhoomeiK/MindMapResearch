This led to me constantly stepping away to get coffee, which made me jittery and anxious, and constantly fighting a feeling that I was about to step on a landmines.

Work has been really stressful, and I've been looking for a new job.  The problem is I work in Pharma, so my pay-scale is currently more than anyone is looking to match.  I'd have to relocate a long way away to make the same, and then my wife would end up leaving a very lucrative government job.  

My old boss wasn't bad, but she was so high energy and bombastic in her reactions that it emotionally burned me out.  I was constantly drinking coffee to keep my energy level up to her level, or just to have a minute to step away.  She sat 5 feet from me, and would randomly ask me questions like ""what IS the difference between a raven and a crow?"" or any other question that came to mind.  Since I was so close, I got the full brunt of her anger/randomness.  I also was shielding the rest of my team from her attention so they could work. 

Doing that for 5+ years had me a wreck.  So when the new boss came in I was in a panic mode because they were so quiet, and I thought they were silently judging me.  Like a bomb waiting to explode.  

Needless to say, after I had a cry at home with my wife I came in and laid my cards on the table to my new boss and things have been better.
