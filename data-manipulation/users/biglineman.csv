BoJackHorseman,fgf4401,t1_fg3fs3r,1580723356.0,"Yeah, I remember harboring some resentment towards old friends I had known since Kindergarten because they hadn't really talked to me much since we graduated, but over time I realized that it's not fair to them to feel this way, not everything lasts, and sometimes good things have to end in order for something even better to come. 

I'm still waiting for the better, but I no longer carry the resentment. So that's a good start."

BoJackHorseman,fgf2w0b,t3_ewl6mf,1580721436.0,"Jesus. This episode was horrifying. I originally thought that he was meeting them to make amends or have a moment of self reflection, but then I realized that they were all served their last meals. Then Bojack gets a plate full of pills. 

Even after Bojack finds out that the water tastes like chlorine, and he coughs up the tar, my heart sunk at seeing his silhouette in the pool. At that point, I was hoping he would at least find peace, but then every one gets their moment of sadness before they are taken by the darkness. 

Very heavy stuff."

#Offense:  

* Good ground game   
* Stupid interception  
* Good use of FB  

#Grade: B


#Defense:

* Gotta punish Mahomes more when he tries to break it. I'd rather him be too scared to make a play and make him throw it.    
* Set the edge opposite of Bosa. They're clearly afraid of Bosa. They're playing either up the gut or to the right.   
* Gotta rough up Kelce.   
*Not bad at holding them to 10. Keep it up. 

#Grade: B

#Special Teams:    

* Almost had a big oof on the muffed punt return.

#Overall: IT'S BOOTY TIME!!"
