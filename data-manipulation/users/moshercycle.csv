gifs,ff2btd1,t1_ff20ap0,1579499995.0,Yeah wouldn't be happening if I was on this ride. Can't stand peoples obsession with making dangerous videos for 30 seconds. Sit the fuck down you're not important and what you're doing isn't even impressive.
aww,ff2b4do,t3_er65cl,1579499305.0,1000% wrong. Everybody who says that just hasn't had their own buddy

apexlegends,feg7wae,t3_eoj4ua,1579081235.0,Do people just post ideas for fixes to try and look like an apex advocate? This game has bigger fish than a mode that people are too lazy to play. Takes no time to get max ammo. Pick it all up shoot a clip for fun reload and the ammo is already spawned.

gaming,feg1k0x,t1_fefukg8,1579072965.0,"Lol I get a lot of downvotes for shitting all over the faces of people who whine about reposts. Those people literally are the exact products of why social media is so bad for you. There's people who actually think they can't post things on the internet because it's been posted before.... better yet there are people who are concerned about the intangible internet points someone they'll never meet may get. I get it if someone is stealing a sap story or lying about a story because those people may get donations or whatever but an image/gif, cmon."
