Breath_of_the_Wild,fffclkj,t1_fffc1lw,1579880998.0,"I tried that for about 20 minutes one day, two different stables, loads of meat.  Never worked. Is there a time of day component I am missing?"
AskReddit,ffcmtba,t3_esr647,1579802792.0,"Dollar Origami Catfish.  It takes me an hour and a half to fold one, which is fairly quick considering it takes hundreds of folds.  But everyone feels entitled to one when they find out I can do it.  And even strangers get offended if I say I don't want to spend that much time doing something I am sick of."

DnD,ffcivj8,t1_ffcipmf,1579800413.0,"Yeah, I gathered.  When 6 people tell me not to do it in less than five minutes, it is clear it is a bad idea.  I guess I will scrap the idea.  Oh well."
DnD,ffcihkh,t1_ffci4s8,1579800175.0,"Yeah, I want to surprise him, so I won't be talking to him beforehand.



If he doesn't want to play along, he can just convince the party to kill me.


I already have a dwarf tinkerer sheet ready if he is not cool with it."

litrpg,femymyo,t1_feltxij,1579272958.0,"That is a plot point in one of the more popular Litrpgs, the AI controlling the game also controls the real body of a player, to straight up murder a guy."
LateStageCapitalism,fekp0x2,t1_feklj7d,1579204631.0,"I never buy lottery tickets, but I enjoy imagining I could win.  I figure finding the winning lottery ticket on the floor is basically as likely as me buying it."
writing,fejzzap,t1_fejzpd1,1579189661.0,"Yes, I self publish.  But I am sure you get to see the cover before it gets published, right?  Is it too late to do small edits at that point?"

writing,feeq2qs,t3_eomvzw,1579038820.0,"OP, I published my first book at 40, last year.  I had some of the same worries, but it is possible.  It is never too late.  I have a crazy job and 4 kids, and I did it.  My key to success was self publishing, and some luck with advertising. Forget about rejection letters, write your best novel and publish it yourself.  Define what success means to you and go get it.



Your question was how to live without being a huge success, but you really just need to focus on what success means to you.  Preferably a definition of success that is internal instead of relying on others for validation."

fantasywriters,fe9glx3,t3_eo6vkf,1578937361.0,"The reader doesn't have to know the details of your worldbuilding.  Discribe it in two sentences or less and move on.  Even if the inner workings are a plot point later on, don't info dump, trickle out only the needed details."

AskReddit,fdics9s,t3_eled64,1578439970.0,"The points don't matter.  People go to great lengths to get upvotes, but they don't matter in the least.  


They don't even matter on this very site.  The commenters with the most updoots don't even have any flair.  There is just no reason to care about upvotes.


...and yet I want upvotes."
me_irl,fdedcqp,t1_fdea4x5,1578336556.0,"The picture proves nothing, but it gives a strong indication.  You literally have no reason to disbelieve it besides the idea that nothing ever happens.

GifRecipes,fckfpyw,t1_fckfako,1577724309.0,"The entire point of this conversation is that the gif has cardiovascularproblem-sized portions of brie.  That is at least a kilo of heart stopping power in that gif.


But I admit I am jelly that you can get brie for a good price."
GifRecipes,fckdwxp,t1_fckcjqz,1577723151.0,"Doesn't matter what European country you are in, you cannot get brie for cheap.  No way you can make 2 of these for 3 euro.

Higher than what I bought it at a month ago,  higher than what I ended up selling it at a month after the latest assessment. I think you just ended up with incompetent tax assessors.
