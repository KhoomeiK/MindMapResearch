The infrastructure investing business appears to have turned itself into a perpetual motion machine. The underlying assets — toll roads, pipelines and wind turbines — are teetering on a pyramid of thinner profits and higher risks. But the investing public does not seem to notice. Despite weak earnings, the infrastructure funds have been able to trade those assets back and forth with each other for ever-higher prices. Then they use the mark-to-model results to raise more money from institutional investors and the public markets. According to Preqin, a data provider, infrastructure funds raised $98bn in 2019, even though their internal rate of return tumbled from 12.8 per cent in 2018 to 7.7 per cent. They have a record $212bn of dry powder — money that has been secured but not committed to any particular investment. That is double the size of the money bin they had five years ago. It is not entirely clear what they can do with this cash to reach even their projected rates of return. The energy industry is building fewer pipelines and LNG plants. US public infrastructure is mostly financed in the ultra-low-cost municipal bond market. There is, of course, a great deal of infrastructure spending in Asia, but little of it changes hands in the secondary market. For all the chit-chat about 5G telecoms networks and data centres, most of those assets should be owned by operating companies with the required technical skills, not passive portfolio investors. Telecoms and IT assets have faster product cycles than generators or airports, which means it is riskier to harvest profits from refinancings. The heart of infra investing has historically been in Europe, where more than three-quarters of the funds’ assets are held. And the underlying assets in their core industries are earning historically low profits. Water companies in the UK are allowed only a 4.19 per cent return on equity. Given their unpopularity, they are lucky to get even that much. Energy networks in Sweden have had their returns cut from 5.85 per cent to 2.16 per cent. At least that is better than owning toll roads in Italy. The autostrade operator, Atlantia SpA, has been threatened by the Italian government with having its concession revoked over the deadly collapse of its bridge in Genoa. But green turned out to be the magic word that wafted away the low profits and political risks hanging over the infra world. It is easy for an insurance company or pension fund’s board to insist on carbon divestiture and a renewables quota. More difficult for management to find a way to actually buy the wind turbines or solar farms. Unlisted infrastructure funds have become a way around the institutional investors’ challenge in meeting their decarbonisation targets. Their illiquidity and opacity have in the past made it possible for the funds to capture regulatory arbitrage while keeping up the appearance of fiduciaries. Infrastructure fund managers like to be photographed wearing hard hats in front of renewable energy construction projects. Generally, though, they would prefer not to take construction or technology risk. Ideally, they will buy in to a project after the FID (final investment decision) and close enough to the commissioning date to avoid the unpleasant surprises. Then they can participate in flipping the deal at a higher price to Canadian pensioners or Middle Eastern sovereigns. Essentially, infrastructure investments are priced somewhere between the yield of a long duration bond and an energy equity As a group, infra funds managed to stay one or two steps ahead of reductions in direct government subsidies or allowed rates of return. The key was tweaking documentation so as to keep their banking groups in line despite lower margins. “Many of [the original managers were asset strippers from private equity or real estate] with their eyes always on the exit,” said Frederic Blanc-Brude of Edhecinfra, an independent research institute in the sector. “But there has been a change in the managers’ DNA.” “More of them are trying to do something productive and finance the energy transition. They are not as disconnected from the subject matter and technology as the old PE hacks. On average, the management quality has improved, with more engineering and project finance types,” he said. They are going to need those skills because infrastructure investment is a highly cyclical business. This has just been an usually long cycle. Essentially, infrastructure investments are priced somewhere between the yield of a long duration bond and an energy equity. Using Edhec’s data to generate an infrastructure index, the “bond” has a duration of about 16 years, and a “coupon” or long-term cash yield that fluctuates between 5.5 per cent and 7 per cent. As Blanc-Brude said: “Infrastructure has become ‘expensive’ compared to its long-term levels, but it has a great cash yield. So it still makes sense. Even so, it is exposed to risk, especially interest rate risk. Investors should be aware of that.” They should also be aware of the political risk. The UK election will not be the last time infrastructure investors face nationalisation or adverse regulation"
