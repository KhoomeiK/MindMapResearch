soccer,ff6fik5,t1_feyndid,1579626079.0,"> Yes, because of its implications. I don't favor a situation like in the United States, where the Seattle Sonics are suddenly the Oklahoma City Thunder, or in England, where Wimbledon is suddenly Milton Keynes. I like the way German sports are organized, and I am against changing it (in such a fundamental way, that is) and, as I explained, Red Bull sets a precedent for just that.

Where did they move a team? Or do you own a crystal ball to see the future?"
