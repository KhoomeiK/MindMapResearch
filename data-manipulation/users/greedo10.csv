UpliftingNews,ffdnrzm,t1_ffdmxvq,1579824808.0,">When a white male advocates for his the dignity of his identity group and for consideration of their feelings, feminists and other social justice advocates are the ones who immediately respond with hostility. If the problem is that men are being expected to just keep their heads down and keep their mouths shut, then the immediate negative reactions of people like yourself are the tool of reinforcement

I used to be a men's rights activist, I now realize that I'd just been taught by people that by people and they were just lying to me, they're lying to you too. What you've just said is ""it's the fault of feminism that we are like this"", which just isn't true. The reason is the capitalist system has made you less successful than your parents as it has for pretty much anyone and that is seen as a failure of being a man. The reason that feminists don't like men's rights activists is that the vast majority are massive sexists, I was when I was there and looking back so was everyone else there. You want an external cause, someone to blame but the ones who have caused this and are not allowing you to talk about it openly is you and other men.

UpliftingNews,ffdm4ks,t1_ffdlf7t,1579823802.0,"Male suicide rate are higher due to them not being able to share their emotions as much. So many men refuse the help that's given to them due to toxic masculinity (manliness making them not want to seem weak). Straight male suicide rates aren't as high as gay men, so that's not where the issue lies, black men and white men don't seem to be too different so that's not the issue.

The reason is that men are societally supposed to be bread winners, but the way capitalism has fucked the economy many are worse off than their parents and makes them feel like failures. Feminism is trying to fight the whole toxic masculinity thing causing this problem, but men fight against it so much and shut out the help and guidance offered to them there's not much they can do.

1. Make it a weekly payment instead of monthly, this fixes so many issues including the massive wait time at the start as even if it still had the 2 week waiting period the time after that to your actual payment would be a week not a month, making it 3 weeks instead of 6 weeks.

2. Scrap sanctions entirely, the money is subsistence level at best and really shouldn't be able to be taken away. I would have a somewhat increased amount for people jumping through the job searching hoops, maybe £10-20 per week.

3. Drop different amounts for different ages. There is no reason for someone under 25 to get £60 less each month, it's just age discrimination and is probably illegal due to that fact but no-one is going to take that case.
