I've been considering looking for a new job, because my current one does not provide me with any room for further advancement, yet my current salary isnt quite enough to really be able to do anything other than scrape by. I love the work though, and actually enjoy being there. So to move on would be simply to persue money over happiness. For the last 10 months I've been going round and round with myself trying to decide what to do, and I make 0 progress.

My housing situation is what sucks up all my money, and I'm not certain that living with my current roommate any longer is good for my mental health. The market where I live though is through the roof, and it would cost me juat as much to rent a little studio apartment as it does to split the rent and bills at my current home. Against, I'm stuck being unable to come to any real conclusion of what I should do.

Finally, I've completely fallen in love with my best friend. She knows, but she' doesnt have the same sort of feelings for me as I do for her. I don't want to damage our friendship and risk pushing her away from me, and that I need to move on from those feelings I have for her. But when we hang out, that rational thinking goes out the window and i find myself falling harder and harder.

There's other examples in other areas of my life, and it's all just got me feeling completely stuck...paralyzed...unable to make a choice. Two roads diverged in the wood, and I stood there at the fork like a moron because I couldn't pick one to walk at all!"

What about Punkin Center, No Name, or Ovid.

Or all the random names like Joe's, Kim, or friggin Tyrone."

Gorgeous! I miss living up that way!"
depression,fddkaci,t3_ektfzy,1578315575.0,"I do this often. Sometimes I just crank some tunes and cruise around, or other times I'll drive until I'm outside of town enough that I can pull over, step out and just enjoy some peace and quiet.

If taking some time to go for a cruise helps you to settle your thoughts and collect yourself, then I would hesitate to call it a waste of gas.

Be mindful of what you spend of course, but for me I get enough benefit from it that I've started budgeting a little extra for gas ea h month just so that I can keep this as an option."
progresspics,fcacq10,t1_fca8495,1577566880.0,"Right on! That's awesome.

It's really encouraging to hear you having success despite the age. When I turned 35, I started getting those 'you're getting old' feelings, and have been using that in part as motivation for some positive life changes.

I've been a little worried about how my well seasoned body will respond. Good to hear that all hope is not lost just because I'm on the closer to 40 side of my 30's now."
depression,fc6bs2g,t1_fc6ary3,1577476888.0,"Anytime!

I've struggled with my own thoughts of worthlessness for years and I know how hard it can be to see the good things right in front of us. But don't give up!"
depression,fc69g6o,t3_egdm43,1577475335.0,"Reddit noob here. Not sure if I can post an image in a comment, but this reminded me of a little meme I saw.

It went something along the lines of:

Getting your degree at 25 is still an accomplishment.
Getting married and starting a family after you turn 30 is still beautiful.
Buying a home after you're 40 is still boss!
Dont let others set your timeline on life!

Maybe its cheesy, but it's not wrong.
The very fact that you desire to live somewhere other than at home speaks to the fact that you have goals and desires for yourself. 

You might not make it happen overnight, but as long as you continue to work towards them, then regardless of how long it takes, you're never wasting space or time or life."
progresspics,fc3fwbj,t1_fc3eqlr,1577388903.0,"Thanks! 
I've been lurking on here for a while, and after reading so many words of encouragement from the community, and seeing so many other people's successes, I figure it's time to stop hiding in the wings. So, I hope to be active in the awesomely supportive community here, though I do hope you see less and less of me along the way!"
