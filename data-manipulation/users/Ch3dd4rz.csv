relationships,ffi95cm,t3_etl7ge,1579968285.0,"All I want to know is: are you really *that insecure*? 

Maybe it's time for a sober talk, and see where it leads. 

But for now, I'd do no breaking up on a first impression.

Hope you get there!"
Drugs,ffi2m34,t1_ffhusj7,1579963259.0,">Yes, is it also my job to hand tissues to, and check the blood pressure of smokers when I pass them on the street?

No, but if a smoker or another addict was dying in the street, it would only be human to try and help.

>Is really reasonable to compare obesity to heroin abuse (a manmade and introduced problem?)

Am I comparing it? I am just making a case here for ""things one could have done in order to prevent"". 

>Why does America have a heroin epidemic, but many countries – with comparable economies – do not? 

Because the US has the worst division of wealth in their system of all the countries in the world and the easiest access to prescribed  drugs.

>Why should I have to take time from my day working the cash register at McDonalds, trying to make an honest living, to run outside and play “Medic!” for the US government because it’s once again fucked up our society?

Because you would not be doing it for ""the government"", you would be doing it for *someone else*, *a fellow human being* for crying out loud. 

I'd suggest stopping hiding behind the government and blaming the lack of help to the government.

> Why doesn’t China have heroin overdoses, deaths, and related crimes on the streets like the US?

They have. They are being involuntarily detained until they are deemed ""clear"". And then they rinse and repeat. 

Why, would you rather have their political and social system?

Just curious..."
Drugs,ffhqhlb,t1_ffhoooy,1579948501.0,"Exactly my point! 

What's next: not helping overweight people because ""they did it to themselves""?"
Drugs,ffhqero,t1_ffhm82u,1579948377.0,"So your message is: they did it themselves so we do not need to care about them?

What about smokers who get sick?

What about overweight people who get sick?

What about people who do drink alcohol?

I think a discussion in this area is a no go area because it is not a black and white choice. 

Addicts who use drugs have a sickness and we are obliged to care for them! Just like we should with any other random person."
