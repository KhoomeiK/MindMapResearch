Maybe he just doesn’t want to eat his own dick even though he said he would?  

I mean I wouldn’t eat my own dick either, but he said it.  He confirmed it.  And now he’s walking it back."

It’s absolutely terrifying that people mix cocaine and heroin.

Cocaine lasts only 30 minutes or so and counteracts a lot of the CNS depressant effects of heroin, most importantly respiratory drive.  But heroin lasts hours.  


So the first 30 minutes,  you are ok, even if your dose of heroin would be considered an overdose.  Then the cocaine wears off and the heroin is still there.  So you could have a situation where people get a false sense of security with high drug doses.  But then they fall asleep as the cocaine wears off and just stop breathing."

Yes, the average bill is something like that 32K, but that’s just what the hospital “bills”.  It has very little to do with what the patient and insurance company pay.  The insurance Company will have a set amount they payout for a certain type of hospitalization.  In this case, 18K.  That pays for the room, the salaries of the nurses, techs, secretaries and hospital administration.  It also pays for supplies for the delivery, medications given during hospitalization as well as hospital overhead such as janitorial services, building maintainence, property taxes, landscaping,  electricity and every other cost involves in running a hospital.  Ironically,  it may or may not pay for the physician doing the delivery,  which is actually a tiny tiny fraction of the cost of the hospitalization.

The patient’s Responsibility is highly variable, and depends on the type of insurance plan they have.  If you have good private insurance through your job, you likely have, for example, a deductible around $500 with 10% coinsurance and an out-of-pocket maximum of $5000.

So, in this example, the hospital bills 32K.  The insurance provider says this hospitalization has a set payment of 18K (this was already negotiated months or years prior between the hospital and the insurer based on the admitting diagnosis).   Now, the insurer tells the hospital that the patient is responsible for their deductible ($500), plus 10% of the remaining 17.5k, up to the out-of pocket maximum.  

So in this example the patient will pay $500 + $1,750 = $2,250.

That is assuming they have not had any other treatments or hospitalizations prior to this in the current calendar year.  If the patient already met their deductible and out of pocket maximum for the year, then the bill to the patient would be zero.  

In the real world, there are a lot more factors involved with pregnancy and delivery, because outpatient visits and all prenatal and postnatal care is bundled, and it is more complicated than this example

This example would be more accurate for a healthy patient Who ends up in the hospital for appendicitis and had no other medical expenses for the year.  

That’s just one simplified example of one type of insurance.  Every insurance carrier is different from one another.  Medicare is different from private insurance.  Medicaid is different from Medicare.  And uninsured is different from all that."
