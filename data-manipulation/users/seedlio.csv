Ultimately CA and NY are economic power houses, specially CA. They hold up the US economy, and many of the taxes they pay gets redistributed to lower income states. So, they’re literally the majority, they provide more wealth to the US, and that wealth helps other states. What do we get by giving excess power to smaller population centers with not much economic input? Why would these smaller, less productive communities get to decide legislation that affects way more people in places that they don’t understand. 
Democracy is about voting, and letting the majority of the population decides what is right. The EC creates inequality, a vote in Nebraska should count equally to a vote in California. A Nebraskan is not more important than a Californian.
