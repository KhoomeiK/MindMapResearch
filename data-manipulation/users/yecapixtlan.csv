The otto rush was OP during the first two weeks it became popular, then everyone found a way to deal with it.

If you weren't good at it then you were prone to make mistakes or send the janissaries late and hurt yourself. If the other player was good then he was able to defend himself long enough until his economy was better than yours. 

You needed to be a decent otto rusher against aztecs, russians and Indians (was it Indians?) otherwise the rush simply would not work.

If it worked then you were better than the other player, you could've won not using the rush anyway."

AskScienceFiction,ffb59sp,t3_esmr1l,1579752157.0,"I'm gonna answer based on what I know about Marvel's take on healing powers. 

First of all, why would any super with healing powers ever need plastic surgery? There's nothing to fix or reconstruct as their body can do it naturally and better than any surgeon. Cosmetic reasons maybe?

Main problem is: the skin immediately starts regenerating as the scalpel cuts it thus making surgery almost impossible. There are ways to slow down the healing factor or completely nullify it, so that could be used. I don't know how the healing process of plastic surgery occurs, I know some procedures require post-surgery treatments but I'm not sure how that works, so I can't answer that part.

As for implants, yes they remain inside their body. Wolverine has adamantium in his skeleton, Daken had surgery to get a pair of katanas attached to his forearms, and X-23 has adamantium claws instead of her natural bone ones. In fact in one occasion she had her whole limb chopped off, she took her adamantium claws from her severed limb and whe the new arm grew, she ripped out her bone claws and inserted the adamantium claws inside her new arm. Metal as fuck. 

Also, regeneration burns a lot of calories so no, fat wouldn't come back as it is fuel for the regeneration process."

truegaming,feewfaq,t1_feeqt8e,1579042673.0,"The thing is no element is really needed until uvhm. The game tells what element is good against what and it clearly tells you to use shock weapons to deal with shields/invisibility and then swap to fire or corrosive.

You can simply ignore that in normal and tvhm. Elemental weapons are not needed at all. You could use whatever weapon you want and it'll still work against all enemies and bosses, as long as it's not several levels below. Of course using the correct element makes battles trivial. 

Once you reach uvhm, it's when you need elements but since you didn't really need them at all until that point then you're not used to be reliant on them and what was meant to be a core mechanic is now a letup to your dps. It's no wonder slag is universally hated.

If I'm not mistaken the Reborn mod pack makes slag act like an actual element so it does damage over time, lasts more and it also rebalances the entire game. I tried the early versions of it but not sure the state of it as of right now."

truegaming,fedgx2n,t3_eokmq2,1579011215.0,"One game I've been playing for years is Borderlands 2 and let me tell you the first playthrough is so slow.

Not the first missions, not the first chapters but the entire game is not challenging at all. Enemies are dumb, weak, you overpower them easily and even tho you have ""boring"" weapons, they can still kill enemies in a few hits.

Then you unlock True Vault Hunter mode where the enemies are tough and you finally have some good weapons and skills, so the battles are more entertaining. Once here you still don't want to farm anything because there's more to unlock; the Ultimate Vault Hunter mode and then the OP levels. 

This is where the game truly begins, both the enemies and your weapons are strong but your character is not, so you're basically playing a glass cannon. This time around you need some strategy and friends.

But to get to all that you have to play all the way through Normal mode and oh boy even new players quit because they think the game is piss easy."
