The original constellation was a frigate which was dismantled and turned into a sloop which is what this is. It operated globally in the early 1800's to protect American economic interests and lives, fought in the war of 1812, was involved in the spanish american war then operated around the world capturing ships involved in the illegal slave trade (while slavery was still legal in the US the import of slaves stopped in 1807).

MadeMeSmile,ffwtlig,t1_ffwq4qf,1580310697.0,"my wife is a teacher so I am close to this but her first year she was a hostess at a restaurant on weekends and during the summer. After a year of it she couldn't do it anymore because she was just constantly exhausted. On top of that the 3 months thing is only really accurate in a few places. For anyone in the northern half of the country once you add in snow days you can start pushing pretty far into june and then when you add that most districts have teachers come back a week or two early for professional development and team meetings and then add any time the teacher  takes themself to break down or setup their room you are looking at potentially 2 months off. which is a nice chunkn of time, but as I pointed out above over the course of a year I would argue that most teachers work more hours than the average and certainly more than 40hours/week even when spread across the entire year."
MadeMeSmile,ffwl2um,t1_ffw9jbb,1580304381.0,"This teachers work 3/4 of the year bullshit is such a tired argument. Teachers work at least 9 months of the year however they work late nights, early mornings and weekends throughout those 9 months. Aside from their full days physically in the school building they also write curriculum at home, grade papers at home, write report cards comments at home, stay after school for tutoring or clubs or sports, they go in on weekends for games or plays or concerts, they hold parent teacher conferences, and a vast majority of them also take graduate level courses throughout their careers as a requirement of their job.

So dont give me that teachers work 3/4 of the year bullshit. Sure they get a long summer but during the 9 months (or more for many) that they work they are putting in far more than 40 hours a week and they are virtually on the job every waking hour of the day.

Also lowering the department of education budget would only hurt students more as a vast majority of their budget goes directly to pell grants and title 1 funding and special education grants. It isnt like their budget is all salary for employees, it is money that goes directly back into schools. Now of course if you have evidence of waste and ""bloat"" I am all ears.

Lastly, the average salary of all teachers is $60k sure, but the average starting salary of teachers is $39k which is hardly a good enough salary for all tha teachers do. That means that counting life long highly educated teachers in the best districts along with all other teachers we can only average $60k. That's shameful. Both of those numbers need to be drastically higher if we want to actually attract the best talent and work towards getting our education system where it needs to be. And numbers in the $40's I'd nowhere near ""fair"". 

I hope you dont have kids but if you do i hope their teacher makes more that $40k or is just one of the many teachers making nowhere near enough money that still puts in enough effort and time to help their students succeed."

Despite actual numbers and data people refuse to ignore their emotional response to their perceptions. Loggers get killed by trees everyday, fisherman drown everyday, construction workers get hit by cars or fall off building every day. Being a cop is statistically safer than a ton of jobs but, like you say they get so much more if killed in the line of duty because of our emotional response to a bad guy killing a good guy (even if it was just the cop getting into a car accident or having a heart attack while running after someone)."

Also your parents were poor and never cooked so you dont know how to cook. Also you cant afford spices other than salt and pepper so forget seasoning food. Now you're kids are home from school and you need to feed them, help them with homework, put them to bed then head out for your last job of the day.


Point I am making is not everyone can make conscious choices about their health on a daily basis because we live in a society that has allowed poverty to fester because it's easy for us to just blame poor people. 

Maybe if we put a little more effort into stopping poverty and making it easier for people to buy produce and eat healthy and we educate their kids on cooking and healthy eating then in a generation or two everyone can be a  free market libertarian who couldnt give a shit about their neighbors because we all have something..."
baltimore,ffcfnkn,t1_ffc8cje,1579798439.0,I'm guessing you have never been poor.
baltimore,ffcfl9w,t1_ffc8fo3,1579798400.0,How many people live with their gas turned off or with broken appliances. My wife is a teacher and has seen kids who come to school eating McDonald's or potato chips everyday and knows their parents arent cooking at home.
baltimore,ffc7asv,t1_ffc74bk,1579793189.0,True. I would just hope that over time with enough exposure you could start getting more buy in. Like if a kid sees an apple every day in the corner store maybe one day he buys it and likes it.

baltimore,ffc6j97,t1_ffc5r0v,1579792690.0,"I get what you are saying but I think using the word ""want"" somewhat makes the problem a lot more simple than it is. I doubt anyone consciously buys fried food and candy for their kid wanting to hurt them long term. I think what we need are programs like this to give people options but then we need to add more teaching and training with them especially for kids to show them not only what is healthy but how to prepare healthy food. 

We have second and 3rd generation impoverished families all over the city who have grown up with nothing but fast food and junk food so if they see a pepper or a squash they might not know what it is and certainly wont know what to do with it. 

So ""want"", IMO, should be replaced with most of their neighbors eat shit due to a plethora of reasons including desires, lack of knowledge, lack of skills and supplies etc."
baltimore,ffc654m,t1_ffc55t0,1579792431.0,"You are making a lot of wild assumptions here. 

Do you really think someone is going into a corner store and thinking ""if I buy this apple I might not get diabetes and if I buy this twinkies I might get diabetes and I know insulin costs a lot and I dint have insurance so I guess I will just get the apple"".

Also from the article OP posted most of the places getting this produce are selling out and they are going through thousands of pounds of produce. So it would very much seem to be that there is a demand for fresh produce."
baltimore,ffc5wc3,t1_ffc5al0,1579792266.0,"Did you even read the article you just linked?

>Mozaffarian says, given that “for 60 percent to 70 percent of Americans, $1.50 a day is not a big deal.” Nevertheless, he adds, it is a “big barrier” for the remaining 30 percent to 40 percent of the population—

So 60-70% of the country means ""everybody"" to you?

Also that study was specifically done in high income areas and the end suggestion was to tax unhealthy foods more to subsidize healthier foods.

Dont act like poor people are just choosing not to eat fruits and veggies because they dont want to. They cant find them, they cant afford them, they lack the supplies to cook them, they lack the skills to know how to cook them. 

It isnt like every poor person just decided ""vegetables suck"". They have been underserved in every area of their life and their food choices have suffered because of it."
baltimore,ffc3l6f,t1_ffc08qx,1579790690.0,"But that study also states that subsidized produce could make a larger difference. So yeah there isnt as much demand for fresh produce in low income neighborhoods but there is a good likelihood that is because produce is expensive. 

So programs like what Loyola is doing seems like a perfect fit where produce is supplied at cost and sold at a discount or sold with coupons controlled by loyola.

Also saying they dont ""want"" it is not necessarily accurate and you cant possibly pull that info from that study. 

A lack of demand does not equal a lack of interest. There are a ton of variables that can lead to a lack of demand like money, cooking supplies, cooking skills, refrigeration etc."

I work at UMD and we have a campus pantry that is open to students and the public but, afaik, we don't have any real community outreach like this with food (although we aren't surrounded by as much poverty either).

I hope this takes off and gets some national attention, both for Baltimore's perception and in the hopes that it can draw in some bigger donors or companies that can help even more. 

I mean one trader joes or aldi in the right spot could really transform an area in some places in the city."

I love how much positive buy in there is into all of these programs between loyola and whole foods and the city. It sounds like people are really taking advantage of having fresh produce supplied in their areas which hopefully with enough interest might be enough to get the attention of some larger grocery chains."

Problem is these guys were using a camera in the outfield linked to a live tv where an employee would make loud bangs so the batter would know in real time if there was a fastball or a curve or whatever coming. It gives them a huge advantage and makes it incredibly unfair for the pitcher.

And what makes it worse was that the whole organization was in on it."

The price said $75 on each which I was willing to spend as new would have been hundreds. The customer service lady said how about $20, I thought she meant each and was ecstatic turns out she meant total. So for something I was willing to spend $150 on I walked out for $20. 

Ever since then I try to visit at least every other week."
