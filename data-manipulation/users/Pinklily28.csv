Has she ever said her life didn’t turn out the way she thought it would? It sounds like she’s depressed.  Has she spoken to her Dr?  Do her friends ever drop hints? 
I think you’re doing an incredible job and it sounds like you want the wife back that you married.  
Look around for a gym with child care.  Start taking her with you.  Do you spend time together 1/1?  
She sounds depressed or maybe her hormones are out of whack.  After my first child my hormones went crazy and I had a lot of hormone related issues for a while.  It caused migraines, problems that lasted a few months to a couple years. After a lot of treatment it was straightened out.   It wasn’t fun being me for that time. Maybe a good physical and bloodwork to check her levels?
I hope you both figure this out ."

The mood hits women slower than men.  Some of us like a build up.  When we’ve had enough, everyone is different, that’s enough.  When a guy is coming at us every day, twice a day or more, some women just feel like any woman would do. Its not about the woman, it’s her vagina.  It’s not personal anymore, it’s a chore.   We can’t get into it because it’s overdone.  The moody pouts because we didn’t “like it” or weren’t involved enough is because our minds have drifted off and we’re waiting until he’s done.

If that’s the worse thing your mom does I would be pretty thankful.  A good MIL that doesn’t give you grief, is friendly and helpful is worth her weight in gold.  
As long as your mom is as nice as you say she is she’ll cooperate.  Your gf has to loosen up a little and understand your mom has been coming over regularly.  Hopefully this works out."

I have an EMS, pharmacy tech and phlebotomy background so I know about injuries, meds and infections.  No one , no matter who they are, should kiss, nibble on or put their mouth on baby’s face, head or hands.  This year’s flu is wild. Our area hospitals are full and 2 deaths in our area were due to the flu.  
Older generations don’t understand the no kissing rule because it wasn’t stressed as much as it is now.  My mom kept us out of crowds for the first 3 months because we were born at the start of flu season.  She listen to our Dr like he was speaking the Gospel.  It seems like OP’s MIL thinks none of the warnings apply to her because she’s related to the baby. It’s not about HER, it’s germs and the baby’s lack of immunity. 
Show her some utube videos and let her see how sick newborns can get. Then ask how she would feel if she was to blame for getting baby sick like that.

When a guy is coming at us every day, twice a day or more, some women just feel like any woman would do. Its not about the woman, itâ€™s her vagina.  Itâ€™s not personal anymore, itâ€™s a chore.   We canâ€™t get into it because itâ€™s overdone.
