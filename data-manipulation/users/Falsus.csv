It doesn't spread that easily, it can't handle different climate and basic hygiene will protect you well enough as long as you don't directly touch the blood itself of someone who is infected.

Index 1, 2 and 3 can be watched independantly. Railgun 1 and 2 can also be watched on it's own. Railgun 3 is fine to watch after Index s2. Railgun OVA and Index can be watched whenever you are knowledgable about about the franchise. Accelerator anime relies on knowledge about certain events from Index 1."

She tried killing Cinder, failed and pointed towards Ruby before Cinder killed her. All while not taking a single action against Ruby despite her assassinating someone would be a child's play with her semblance.

RWBY,ff85amw,t1_ff7ttcv,1579666383.0,"Yeah but those people will be too pre-occupied by dealing with Cinder. 

Due to how Neo's power works in a 3 way fight she is in a great position because the others can't really strike at her easily and the other two parties gotta be more worried about each other since they are the ones with the firepower. 

Also there is another thing to note is that she went after Cinder *first* despite RWBY and gang being in Haven for quite some time and she wouldn't exactly have trouble assassinating someone with her semblance. So she might actually not really blame Ruby that much, just using her as a bait. 

Another possibility is that her goal from the get go was to pit them against each other"

2. She couldn't retaliate immediately because they where already in Ninecloud Court and thus under ceasefire whereas the ambushes happened before, the ceasefire was broken in spirit but not in the letters. 

3. Was it really bad for the Akura that Yerin and Lindon faced each other? It guaranteed them a top 8 placement. And the current strength of the akura faction according to the rankings is Mercy > Yerin > Lindon > Eithan but NS probably have already seen through that Eithan is holding back so in reality the rankings goes Eithan < = > Mercy > Yerin > Lindon basically giving the Akura a minimum of 1 top 8 and a good shot at 3 top 8. For similar reasons I would bet on the next match would be Mercy vs Yerin to get into top 4."

It is unclear why the Beast King is hated but his territory is contested territory despite him being only a herald, granted attacking him would probably cause the Akura to send aid since they have a common foe."

Shadowverse,ff6yny7,t3_erxeu0,1579637597.0,"Generally the high end AA is actually more skilled than the low end 0 points master player because the win rate matters a lot more for the AA player.

Low end master is a wild west with all kinds of stuff. 

Generally what seperates pros and high end GM players with the other players is that they plan ahead and try to play around with their win cons, if they don't have the exact perfect plan they still work out a good gameplan or if your normal wincon isn't good vs the deck the enemy playing then they try to switch it up. Ie if you are playing a slower deck and match up against Kuon you may want to play more aggressively than you would normally do vs something that is more favourable for you. Of course they brick occasionally as well but they really have a high consistency in their gameplans and plays."
