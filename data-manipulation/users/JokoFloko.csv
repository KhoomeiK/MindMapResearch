MLBTheShow,feepqcb,t3_eoqp5a,1579038624.0,My concern isn't with not getting in the beta... it's with the Project Manager effing up the beta application/invite process this badly. Doesnt bode well for overall quality control and competence.

I would guess the answer is yes... but if I turn it on and don't have the notification... do I have to rush home sometime before midnight to check again? Or, do I assume that I didn't get in.
