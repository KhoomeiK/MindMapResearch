I'm lazy and got sick of moving/switching between catalogues, so I downloaded CJB Item Spawner. Some unobtainables must have slipped in. I'm a fairly new player, so I'm still not sure about what is and isn't on that list. *Shrugs*"

I am a fairly new player, and this is my second file. #1 is straight and narrow (with a fairly boring farmhouse), but I decided to bend the hell out of some rules and just enjoy #2. I downloaded CJB Item Spawner because I'm lazy😂 switching between catalogues annoyed me. So it took a few hours, mostly for obsessive plant placement."
StardewValley,fdpc2tx,t1_fdkwrno,1578624886.0,"Thank you! 
I didn't. Snipping Tool and MS Paint :/"

That curved, fenced path... mmmmmph! And the tiny flower garden near Grandpa's tomb is a lovely touch.   


How do you make this a ""reality""? Do you use Stardew Valley Planner and then painstakingly copy across?   


Do you have any design tips? My farm designs have been very orthogonal."

That being said, the area desperately needs a giant rug. A smaller one may do. Suggestions?"
StardewHomeDesign,fdjx1lp,t1_fdjul28,1578490229.0,"Thank you. I spent much of last night agonising over them. The trick is to tier them, and to space the colours/designs out. Swear if necessary."

Do fireplaces burn children in Stardew? I don't intend on having children -- but am stuck with a nursery, and figured I might as well try decorating it. (Fairly new player)"
AmItheAsshole,fdgg2ab,t1_fdfe54g,1578395175.0,"Look. My primary piece of post-wedding advice:   
If you don't want them there, don't invite them. Period.   
We had three unwanted guests; one sexually harassed me, one grandmother popped the ""none of this matters"", and not only did I feel obliged to invite my mother, she gave a speech. All easily avoided. If I could do it again, none would have come and everyone would have had a lovelier time for it. 

Also, you are not the arsehole."

todayilearned,fcxr3cl,t1_fcsz0ki,1578069332.0,"No, Greta has Asperger's Syndrome, OCD, and selective mutism. She is often mocked for her Asperger's, which is a subset of autism generally characterised by communication difficulties, altered behaviours, and intense, specific interests. Wiki intro: 

""Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterised by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years of age and typically last for a person's entire life."" -Wiki 

Greta's signs will likely improve with age. It isn't necessary, though. She communicates her thoughts well, and does not hurt anyone. She is not the one with a problem. Some people are just arseholes.

(I have Asperger's. Early life was hell. I can now pass as happily weird with the occasional need to explain some things; still, some people are arseholes.)"
todayilearned,fcxfk2m,t1_fcs2uwr,1578061619.0,"We have to see something, find a pattern, and study it before confirming or denying something. 

Plus, medical conditions are extremely complex to research, and scientific study was repressed for a long time -- we have many years to catch up on. Evidence suggests that alcohol use during pregnancy was discouraged in ancient Greece. 

TLDR; see it -> find pattern -> study -> confirm/deny"

A human thinks they might have something? Get tested! Knowledge is life-changing. Diagnoses are places to work, build, and understand yourself from.
