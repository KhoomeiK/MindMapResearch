I don't think that at all. In fact, quite the opposite. Sex can definitely result in a person feeling something they may think is love. They may even be correct!

Whether or not free will exists is debatable, but the feelings that people who are in love with each other are often quite real to them, and I do find that endearing.

AskReddit,fehbolo,t1_fegks9z,1579113250.0,"> religion often teaches us to resist our natural urges and desires. 

Some compulsions are urges, some are needs. People need companionship, and this expresses itself sexually, particularly during puberty/teenage years. 

> It’s what separates us from animals 

We ARE animals. Humans act irrationally every bit as much as wildlife. We just have a gargantuan amount of evolutionary history informing most of our actions. 

> we have the ability to choose to act against this, and instead we can choose to form virtuous relationships.

What is virtuous about not having sex? I hate to pick on your choice of words. but honestly, I don't see much virtue or value in abstaining from sex, particularly if it's done in a responsible manner, which is far more likely in the presence of realistic views about our nature and knowledge about sexuality in general. 

I'll leave you with this notion, since you believe I do not grasp the meaning of your argument. I do not think that any romantic relationship can truly be loving without first having 'made love,' considering that it was this, with all of it's intentions, that most likely drove both partners to the relationship to begin with."
atheism,fegaq20,t3_eok5kz,1579085255.0,"The very term 'lifestyle violation' is telling in of itself. If it's a violation, then you need to specify exactly WHAT the violation is. Think about that same term with respect to any other thing that religious people view as ""sinful""

**Lifestyle Violation**: Drug Abuse - That's call addiction, it's not a 'lifestyle violation'

**Lifestyle Violation**: Infidelity - None of ANYONE'S business, especially not a school. Yes it may be a lifestyle decision, it's not anyone's fucking business except for the people involved. 

**Lifestyle Violation**: Theft - You're a fucking thief. Also, already a crime and doesn't need a label

I could go on, but this is clearly just a way for the university to justify bigotry against homosexuals without coming out and saying that it's discriminating against them. It's a larger version of the ""love the sinner, not the sin"" bullshit.

AskReddit,feg9why,t1_fefv4x0,1579084101.0,"You're not going to tell me that being in a relationship and avoiding sex by ignoring your sex drive is ""natural"" or universally positive. 

Your desire for sex is what informs you to begin forming those kinds of relationships in the first place. I think of children forming opposite sex friendships at early ages. They think nothing of it, and it is rarely sexual, even sometimes when it does involve sexual activities the children often report that they were simply acting out behavior that they've seen adults do. It's not sexually driven because they haven't reached puberty yet, and their brains have not even begun the processes that lead to that sort of behavior. 

But, as soon as puberty begins, BOOM! Most people's relationships with the opposite sex become sexually-informed. Sure, you can maintain friendship-only relationships with someone of the opposite sex during adulthood, but for the most part, when we are seeking intimate partners, we do so based on our *sexual* preferences above all else. 

Denying yourself sex out of guilt is one thing, but trying to deny that sex doesn't drive your need for intimacy is delusional.

Oh, and on the last point, the Netherlands provides government-subsidized sex activities for disabled individuals. I believe there is another country that does so as well, and also similar services are popular in Japan, though not necessarily government funded."
AskReddit,fefu9t8,t1_fees8m3,1579065399.0,"Doesn't have to mean sex, specifically. But the need to belong, fit in and feel loved IS an innate psychological need, and that is often expressed socially through our sexual relationships. 

Sex is not just the act of coitus and ejaculation, but rather a complex series of intimate interactions with other Human beings. We tend to not think of our mating habits as sexual, but they are. This type of interaction is what is necessary for a healthy life, not necessarily the act of sex itself, though that part is nice as well.

Also there are locations where sexual interactions are indeed funded by the government for those who may have difficulty obtaining it in other ways."
