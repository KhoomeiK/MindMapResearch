AskReddit,ffpyo67,t1_ffpoxye,1580111216.0,Hey this really helped me come up with ideas that I’m excited to implement. I’m heading into my last semester of school and scared. thank you.
todayilearned,ffng927,t1_ffn9nay,1580065527.0,"I’m agreeing with you? I literally said this about calories. 

“Malnourished” just means you are suffering from a lack of nutrition. We tend to use it for people who are severely underweight, because if you are barely taking in calories, you’re not taking in the proteins and vitamins and other stuff you need to be a healthy working body. But it doesn’t *mean* underweight or starving, it means literally badly nourished. It is a huge huge health issue to be malnourished, regardless of your BMI."
fatlogic,ffmpgob,t1_ffmnj1l,1580057546.0,Because people who bring up body positivity are immediately pinned as HAES wackos and dismissed. They’re bringing it up precisely to distance themselves from that thinking.
todayilearned,ffmndrz,t1_ffk05dr,1580056901.0,How many of each of those are films though?
todayilearned,ffmlc31,t1_ffll2tb,1580056226.0,"You’re getting downvoted because the comment you replied to doesn’t say anything about poor people being mostly good, just that rich people are not, and making those statements equivalent is totally illogical. Your thing about “not romanticizing poverty” is in response to nothing anyone else said.

And sure, I’m sure many rich people are generous. But they all gathered their wealth by stepping on other people (or inheriting it). Not because they’re individually cartoonishly Scroogelike Trump supporters (although some are) but because that’s how it’s possible to hoard a ton of wealth."
todayilearned,ffmkdch,t1_ffm14bm,1580055916.0,"Being overweight only means you’re eating more calories than you need. It does not mean that those calories come in the form of food with any nutritional value. You can be overweight and malnourished. I imagine trash fast food can easily be high in calories but have barely any nutritional value. 

Imagine if you had to survive on a steady diet of twinkies. Your body would keep going, and you’d probably put on weight, because in the short term you kinda just need energy and that’s what all calories are, and twinkies have a ton! But your health would be fuuuuuucked up, and also it would be gross."
fatlogic,ffmh19j,t3_etfhfh,1580054584.0,"This title is totally missing the point. The image is literally saying that fat is unhealthy, and that body positivity should focus on the sentiment on the right, not on the factually inaccurate HAES. 

This is Sanity Sunday material, not fat logic."
fatlogic,ffmgv09,t1_ffgdyzd,1580054489.0,"It does? It’s saying that the point of body positivity shouldn’t be the factually inaccurate health at every size bs, but that fat people shouldn’t be treated like shit just because they’re fat, and that someone being unhealthy is not a reason to not treat them humanely."
fatlogic,ffmgkhy,t1_ffg220t,1580054344.0,but saying that your weight is not your worth and that people should be inclusive isn’t saying that fat is healthy?
AskReddit,fffjalh,t1_ffem5ip,1579885173.0,"The opening scene, I meant. It starts off with the main character all alone desperately worrying about her depressed loved one after concerning messages and trying to get a hold of them. She’s freaking out and calling everyone, but no one answers except her boyfriend, who tells her that her loved one does this vague concerning messages all the time and therefore it’s just for attention and she needs to stop giving in to it. Then she receives a call that the loved one has indeed killed themselves. She’s alone in her apartment and lets out this horrific wail of grief. 

So, specifically that sequence. When you have more than one close friend you worry about in that way."
AskReddit,ffd4of9,t1_fdbjkzo,1579813353.0,lmao this is a good joke and you deserve some recognition for it
ATBGE,ffbutrm,t1_ffafok2,1579783510.0,that’s... one form of androgyny lol. You don’t have to be a super minimalist Tulsa Swinton. It can be masc and fem turned Up at the same time
nextfuckinglevel,ffb8967,t1_ffa4i7o,1579754726.0,i miss her
AskReddit,ffb80m0,t1_ffb7fmq,1579754502.0,oh lol fair
AskReddit,ffb7mmx,t1_ffaw4gg,1579754092.0,"I had a legit panic attack in the theater. I was expecting good horror but fueled mostly by weird supernatural shit. Hot wya too close to home and I had to escape to the bathroom, then order as much alcohol as possible (an alamo drafthouse) That first-date tinder date did not pan out lmao"
AskReddit,ffb7fiy,t1_ff9ivt8,1579753884.0,meh i related so hard to her old dude neighbor. civil rights and gay rights and all that is just too much. but then he sees how important this one small struggle is for someone he cares for. it’s more motivating for him than his own struggles. breaks my heart every time
AskReddit,ffb7af4,t1_ff9kv8m,1579753745.0,or just not really going for realism lol
AskReddit,ffb77vw,t1_ffad2ni,1579753676.0,"which dad? because if you mean jason bateman’s character, you kind of missed the point lol"
AskReddit,ffb740a,t3_esdjti,1579753579.0,"My time to shine. What was that drummer movie with JK Simmons? WHIPLASH. My mother and I go to see a lot of movies together because we’re cute like that and we saw this one early.  As we left the theater we were BOTH like “Lol this is gonna Flop hard.” 


Nope. Everyone fuckign loves it??? We do NOT understand. This may have something to do with the fact that we both have tin ears and very little interest in music? Maybe?

But still. Cmon you guys, that scene where he crawls out from underneath the wrecked car? That is a fuckign Ridiculous scene"
AskReddit,ffb6cgl,t1_ff9msq2,1579752977.0,Any word on how they rank? I’m unfamiliar with the exam- does everyone with the same score get the same ranking position or are there also other factors (or is it a more qualitative exam where “the same score” isn’t really a thing?)
suspiciouslyspecific,ffb4qf7,t1_ff9t7bi,1579751748.0,how do you get the drugs out
NoStupidQuestions,feyo5f6,t1_fevcwy8,1579448121.0,"Yeah, my entire point is that there’s too much variation to get anything out of people talking about their personal experiences with a given educational system."
NoStupidQuestions,fetc6yz,t1_fet2kf2,1579373805.0,"depends on the school. There’s too much variation to talk about “American secondary education” as any one thing tbh. Personally, at my public school in a small district with money in the suburbs of New Jersey, it was the norm to take at least a couple AP classes junior and senior years, if not more. I didn’t crack top ten of my class of ~200 students, but took AP US History, AP World History, both AP English (Language and Literature? I forget the names lol), AP French and AP Statistics. It was super normal"
