Accounting,feyg0ob,t1_fewaq82,1579445011.0,I would highly recommend therapy as well. It sounds weird but it will help tremendously. It helped me tremendously.

college,fea03r9,t3_eo50o7,1578943026.0,"How do you not die? Get prepared! Sounds like you have the rest of the week clear, so you can start working on the reading, assignments, homework, etc prior to classes so that you don't get too overwhelmed. If you can, prepare food ahead of time so you don't waste as much time. Also, on days you are off, you can schedule appointments or go to office hours to meet with professors to talk about the materials!"
UAH,fe9zh8a,t3_eo8a4v,1578942830.0,haha that's so hilarious thanks for the update! UAH does it best. Sounds like this dude (or gal) deserves a ticket.
Frat,fe9sc8a,t3_eo5yvn,1578941022.0,one of my buddies did that and it was the most hilarious thing ever. he did not necessarily shit his pants but he woke up from a night out and did not realize his surroundings (maybe still drunk) so took a shit out of nowhere lol. fucking disgusting while hilarious
UAH,fe9r6aj,t3_eo6716,1578940779.0,can anyone take a picture of it? i am not on campus anymore haha
TooAfraidToAsk,fe5au7n,t1_fe4hl64,1578867156.0,"Well, we are not all experts like you do, and we’re just all functioning human beings who have other jobs to do. I wonder the same thing like OP, but never got the chance to ask. I think the question OP has is great in the way that it is kind of sensitive, but having an answer helps us understand others a little better. That’s why we have reddit in the first place right? Anyway hope you have a great day!"
college,fe2rw1d,t1_fe2nz15,1578842220.0,"Yessir you got to push through and make sacrifices. I’m in greek life so all our fun events, tailgates, parties, etc are on Saturday and I work 11 hour shift at a restaurant. It sucks and my feet hurts every time. But when you’re done, it’s worth it.

Idk where you are but trust me college is worth the investment. You’ll meet people from all over the places who will change your perspectives on a lot of things. You’ll take classes that you thought were BS but ended up becoming a better person because of it. You’ll find your passions (whatever it is) through such wealth of knowledge and the people you meet. Nice thing though, college is hard so it’s not like you’re doing it alone.

Good luck!"
college,fe2huo5,t3_ennr3x,1578838460.0,"I can only answer from my own experiences as well as my friends’:

- Yes, some people saved. I personally worked full-time in retail even during school to afford Greek Life, school expenses, car, meals, etc. However I also know that most of my friends worked over the summer because we don’t have classes and we are free. Even student athlete friends of mine worked in the summer as servers at restaurants.

- it’s also about your choices about picking schools, scholarships, costs of living, degrees, etc that matter. Lots of people go to my school because of our scholarship policies. We have lots of grants from the government, but however we all must do well with ACT/SAT and high school GPAs in order to qualify. Costs of living also matter because living in a big city costs way so much more. What you study also matter in terms of job prospects, how much you will make, etc

- while I don’t take out loans, most of my friends do. It’s in our culture anyway lol

Anyway, all it boils down to is the first step in your application process: where you decide to go to school and whether you can afford it. I personally picked a smaller school for my degree but I have full tuition covered, worked my ass off so i will graduate with a positive balance. However I’m going to grad school for another year at a prestigious one where i am using my saving to cover all other costs my scholarship there doesn’t. However it’s only 9 month and i will have a big school name next to my degree so it’s a great investment. Good luck! Don’t stress because life will work itself out."
TooAfraidToAsk,fe1ru2b,t3_enmmau,1578830211.0,I think this is a great question. I wonder if anyone has an answer!
Accounting,fdw4v36,t3_en89ap,1578755084.0,I think it depends on the interns though. I guess yours might be an Excel or IT genius. Most of us however still don’t have any clues what we’re doing and still have so much to learn from y’all!
Accounting,fdw4ivw,t1_fdvlgvd,1578754954.0,"Me and my fellow audit interns already followed each other on Instagram after this first week, as we got pretty close. I find this new relationship different from my friends from greek life, and college. Kinda sad we’ll be on different clients for the rest of busy season."
