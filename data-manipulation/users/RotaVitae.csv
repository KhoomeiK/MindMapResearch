mythology,fffscwz,t3_etdz2b,1579890747.0,"It looks like a tiki mug. Tiki culture decorations and accessories were based on white peoples' general tourist view of South Pacific cultures lumped together, and really isn't specific. It was big in the 1950s as South Pacific vacation spots were the big thing but faded over time. That kind of snarling face is prevalent in Hawaiian and Polynesian art but without context it could be anything from a monster to a spirit or a god."
xena,fffrmrg,t3_etdx3j,1579890300.0,"Almost all of Devi's action scenes. They were trying out some kind of new harness techniques on Lucy and she launches herself at the assistant in that strange spinning torpedo move but you can see her spinning body change direction. And Xena throws a watermelon at the assistant swinging the swords and it's just really bad CGI watching it get cut up, while an Eli stuntie watches in the background who is very obviously not Tim Omundson.

When she swings Indiana Jones style on the whip with Eli it has laughably impossible trajectories given their weight and angle because they were on the harness. And the last fight had the stuntie in that horrible George Washington wig pretending to jump up and down on Xena.

The only good fight was in the temple with the bodyguard. The rest of it was just hokey."

They prefer the dark, they can hide very well, they move extremely quickly and are difficult to both catch and hold. Unless you're experienced, it can be very difficult to tell a venomous snake from a harmless one, so you don't know whether you're in danger around one. So they're very much not symbols of order and stability that humans crave, until you introduce the aspect of the shedding which becomes symbolic of eternity and cycles, like Ouroboros. Humans have feared and respected them for millennia."

Vegetarianism,ffc7736,t3_esu31m,1579793123.0,"I don't believe it's cut and dry. This question of ethical opinion is complicated by context. Not everyone who answers is dependent on family so we have freer choices about how our own money is used. And it's different from a friend or stranger asking you to buy it for them.

My family compromises on their beliefs to keep harmony. My brother is vegetarian, his family is omni. When he shops, he buys meat to support his family's diet, but to compromise, his wife only needs to cook for herself and the children. He cooks all his own meatless meals. If they want vegetarian some nights, he's happy to share. Everyone seems happy with this arrangement.

So in the spirit of compromise, if meat shopping is too hard for you, is there a way that you can arrange that your family always do all the grocery shopping with their money so that everyone is satisfied? In return, you do everything else of some other chores like house cleaning. Your family never has to lift a mop or a vacuum as long as they support you, and in return everyone eats what they want without disruption. When you have your own money, they won't need to shop for you if you don't want them to."

mythology,ff97n36,t3_esd1ou,1579706735.0,"I love sun mythology. I've always appreciated the Chinese version because there are actually two pieces of it that almost nobody reads together.

The most popular version is the story of the False Suns, where ten suns were scorching the earth, and the heavenly archer Yi shot down nine of them so that the earth would be spared. He became the god of the remaining Sun, while his wife Chang'e became the Moon Goddess and the goddess of the annual Mid-Autumn Festival.

The obscure myth is the origin of the ten suns, the ""prequel"" to the Yi myth. The ten suns are the crow children of the female sun goddess Xihe, and they would perch on a Fusang tree at the Eastern edge of the world. Each day, Xihe would yoke one of them to her chariot and drive it across heaven. But one day, the other nine crows got bored waiting their turn on the tree and decided to all go flying at once, which caused the scorched earth. Then the myth of Yi starts.

It's interesting because the Yi myth is sort of a ""next-gen"" sun myth to the original, but Yi gets all the glory being a great hero who saved the world. It discounts the fact that he had to put down the crows, and there is no mention of mother Xihe's remorse at the loss of all but one of her children. It's also interesting that because of Yi, Chinese philosophy makes the solar or *yang* principle masculine to the moon's feminine *yin.* But the original myth it was female/female with Xihe and Changxi, the previous moon goddess."

Your own neighbourhood within a .5 to 1 km diameter is a fantastic base to get to know intimately, studying tree species, migration patterns, impacts of waste and city construction, etc. Get to know your personal place in the web where a person on the other side of the world or even just ten miles away from you could be radically different."

I explore the park, I learn about the species of trees and plants the city placed there, what birds, insects and small mammals are drawn to the area during which seasons, and what species have gone away since the park was developed. I also do occasional trash pick ups at the beach, I'm looking to help with a community garden, and I write to my city councillors encouraging more sustainable practices, and I learn about humanity's interconnection with all organic and inorganic life.

If I'm not doing something every day, I try to study something every day. I bless every action as a sacred ritual to the Earth. I was never that good at science in school, but this path has exploded my lay knowledge of biology, botany, ecology, and permaculture.

mythology,ff5t3ai,t3_ert4b3,1579609211.0,"I recall one Chinese myth about a boy with a magic pen. He had to draw all his subjects lacking a body part such as a leg or a hand or eyes, because drawing the whole thing would bring the art to life and draw attention to his power.

I think this belief is in part behind early Muslim depictions of Muhammad, which leave out his eyes or his face, because they believed the complete figure risks idolatry. When the Buddhist caves in Asia were plundered, the raiders scratched out the eyes on every image of Buddha.

I doubt any of this inspired the Weeping Angels though. Theirs was probably influenced by the need for a viewer's physical gaze, rather than the Angel itself. Unlike the stone statues which *don't* want people looking at them, a picture of an Angel is useless unless there's someone around to look at it."

xena,fevmc7t,t3_eqnwjw,1579399054.0,"I like Bones for bringing us back to the Northern Amazons, because I happen to enjoy that group. But Bones has a bunch of problems mostly in the way it was put together. Important characters leave in this episode with small regard, and there are a lot of inconsistencies with Sin Trade.

Bones was clearly meant to be the season's Hallowe'en episode that freaked you out with images of blood and scary things. But it just wasn't written *as* a horror episode, not like Family Affair or Haunting of Amphipolis. Virtually the only eerie thing was the dream at the beginning, and that was more funny with the CGI.

Steven Sears originally had an explanation for Otere's absence, but the rewrite doesn't even give that. Yakut is simply the leader now, no arguing, and Xena knew even before they headed there. Yakut isn't a bad character, and it's admirable that she still demonstrates naivete even as the leader. But her presence just isn't strong enough to justify being a useful sidekick of the week.

As a way to give Jen Sky an exit for C2525, Amarice is left with this tribe, but it's a tribe that she had no affiliation with before and is a stranger to their ways.

We now have the Tree of Amber and Chi'ah. I find it hard to believe that this element of Northern culture sprang up in the year since we last saw them, especially since Chi'ah has the power to read minds and identify Amazons, that even Alti couldn't.

I forgive the skeleton fights because they were a creative way to cover Lucy's pregnancy. What I found awkward were the shamanic travel bits that were intercut with clips of nature footage: storms, spiders, alligators chewing fish. Sin Trade didn't have any of this during its sequences, and it seemed a cheesy way to cut corners."
xena,feu0oc9,t3_eqdt0f,1579381976.0,"I don't know whether I see Gabrielle settling down with a family post-FIN. The way it ended she was taking Xena's place in the world, and she has no guilty past which was a factor in Xena nearly giving up when she tried to do it solo. I feel Gab could continue fighting for decades while she writes more, so that she becomes the best of them combined. When she couldn't fight anymore, she'd retire and continue to write until she passes.

I also favour Sarah as the ancestor because I don't like the idea that both Xena and Gabrielle's siblings and their families suffer and the family lines end because of their adventures. Lila and Gabrielle both lost their husbands, but Lila deserves a place in the family tree as the only surviving sibling; Xena's are all gone if we're still ruling Toris out."
HyruleWarriors,feogsmy,t1_feo0jgs,1579299959.0,"Yes. You can use the gallery to see which weapons each character has unlocked, and you need the entire roster plus all five of each weapon every character has. This means it won't be complete until you get far into Lorule since the last character and his weapons are there. 

It is possible to bypass collecting some of the lower tier weapons and go straight for the 4+ ones. Acquiring those unlocks the entire range of them. But for most characters it's harder and since you'll have inferior weapons, you'll need plenty of weapon buffs, badges and EXP."

HyruleWarriors,feniezj,t1_fenhn9b,1579285363.0,"You pretty much have to go through all the Adventure Maps. You cleared Legend Mode, but to even begin unlocking the Master Sword's purple slots, you still need to acquire all characters, and then unlock every single level of every one of their weapons, 1 through 4+. *Then* you can open the Master slots, and *then* any purple slots on other weapons.

Essentially, it's a goal for nearing completion of Adventure mode. But again, by that time you'll have such strong weapons on every character by default, that the purple skill will be redundant for many weapons that have it."
HyruleWarriors,fenbujg,t3_eq35i1,1579281345.0,"Yes, the Master Sword is the key to all of them. Once you unlock the Master Sword's skills, all purple skills across every weapon become unlockable as well. But if you're just starting out, you've got a *looooong* way to go to fully unlock the Master Sword. Until then, you're better off selling purple weapons, or moving useful skills they have to non-purple weapons.

However, I'd suggest that the hidden purple skill on the regular weapons is not that useful once you fully unlock the Master Sword, since by then you'll be so far in the game that it's more for cosmetic purposes than anything. You're better off just ignoring it, IMO."

sailormoon,fen1xkz,t3_eq1aso,1579275152.0,"S for sure, not just because of the darker horror imagery. After two seasons exploring the hearts, minds, and lives of the Inner Senshi, they become the reactionary characters to the older, cynical foils who walk into their lives. There's strife among the teams who should be working together.

Haruka and Michiru, who have never known Usagi and never seen the positive power of her emotions, see only the ditzy airhead girl and dismiss her and her friends as childish idealists. In Japanese culture, older family members, students, and friends are to be looked up to as sources of inspiration. But it doesn't help when Uranus and Neptune see the Inners as useless obstacles in the way of their mission.

Hotaru is also the daughter of the maniacal villain, but full of depression and aloofness. She can't believe it when the sweet, innocent and uplifting Chibiusa becomes part of her life, and to see her manipulated and exploited by her father is heartbreaking. And the fact that the Outers are prepared to kill her at any cost to fulfill their mission is scary.

S is a season where the Inners are exposed to something that seems infinitely bigger than themselves. They want to have a voice, that voice of optimism that got them through the last seasons, but the older people keep shooting them down. The Outers have to go through some violent, brutal experience to realize how wrong they are and these girls know what they're talking about."

From an eco view, if you do want to switch to vegan shoes or clothes lifestyle, it's best to make the leather shoes your last pair, and do your research in the meantime for a good vegan pair.

mythology,fejrbil,t3_epj2wo,1579183900.0,"Humans are assholes, and it says something that the Greek gods behave much more human than Yahweh. Zeus is a serial rapist, a child kidnapper, a murderer. His wife is forced to accept his sleeping around because she can't get back at him directly, and punishes his women instead. He was so afraid of his position being toppled that he devoured the goddess Metis like his own father had done to him.

We often call ""acts of God"" beyond our abilities, like weather accidents to be unfair and accept the fallout. Yahweh supernaturally floods the world, causes plagues, mass murders, treats his handpicked favourites like royalty, and there's nothing we can do. But I think it's worse that Zeus commits the worst acts *humans* can commit and are punished, but he gets away with it because he can. It's truly assholish for a capricious god who commits very human crimes to be beyond human justice.

There is some strategy to organize your team on the field and choosing the right missions to level up your weapons and experience. But at its core, this is a repetitive game.

*But* it is mindless addictive fun, very easy to pick up and learn. And this game is a gigantic love letter to Zelda fans.

pagan,fegjz51,t3_ep0zym,1579095066.0,I highly recommend Adrienne Mayor's book *The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World*. It's one of the best modern examinations of the Amazons' historical origins and it was consulted in creating the horseback fighting styles of the Amazons in the Wonder Woman movie. She also gave an excellent lecture on them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=378zVUpeopY).
pagan,feghtq2,t1_feempd5,1579093215.0,"Unfortunately I'm not aware of anyone meeting that specific. I'm aware of figures who changed sexes in order to accomplish things, then changed back afterward. If they stayed in the other form, they'd be limited in their influence or shunned. Regrettably, the majority is men transforming into women, and there always seems to be the binary notion that to exist as the opposite is undesirable and degrading. If there was a positive depiction, it's quite obscure. Cybele had the priesthood of the galli, but that was castration while keeping the same sex according to documentation, so I'm not sure how helpful it is. I suspect viewing them as trans women is a modern interpretation only.

I think a challenge is that so much of Western awareness of mythology comes from the three cultures that were elevated in our history: Classical, Norse, and Celtic. And all three of these strongly embraced sexual binary. It seems a good parallel of your experience would be investigating cultures that openly recognized third and fourth genders, and seeing what figures they turned to for guidance. Indigenous Two-Spirit people and Mahu of Hawaii come to mind. But if you're not of those cultures, it's difficult to be equally authentic and respectful in practice.

I don't know the requirements of your degree, but would aligning yourself with a goddess who lies outside your comfort zone be acceptable as a challenge to grow?"
pagan,feehmg5,t3_eoqmqo,1579033925.0,"Goddess Spirituality practitioners advocate your exact concern, that the Classical depiction of Athena is a patriarchal construct. She was born from the male Zeus' head after he devoured the goddess Metis, thus she wasn't born naturally from a mother, but unnaturally from a father only. And she is pledged eternally to Zeus, his most loyal follower. Athena's seen as a hypocritical creation because despite men's deep reverence for her, a human woman was never allowed to fight on the battlefield as she did.

Charlene Spretnak's *Lost Goddesses of Early Greece* attempts to recreate a feminist version of the perceived pre-Hellenic Athena influenced by Minoan culture and Asia Minor. Athena is a face of the universal Great Goddess of feminist spirituality, born out of the Mother. She is a gentle goddess of wisdom and textiles, but her warrior aspect is removed, as Spretnak believed it was an addition of Mycenaean patriarchy. This myth was a meditative creation of Spretnak's, so I can't speak for its legitimacy, but it's inspiring.

Goddess Spirituality also views traditional notions of virginity as patriarchal, that a man must determine when a woman has lost it and therefore her value. These reconstructed goddesses like Athena, Artemis had no male partners or children, but were considered virgins as being ""one in herself,"" not necessarily abstaining from sex but remaining independent from men or marriage or from having children. To them a virgin goddess retains a vibrant sex life, Artemis of exclusively women, Aphrodite of both women and men.

Of course, you may be aware that Goddess Spirituality is a product of 70s and 80s second-wave feminism, and followers often strongly adhere to sexual binary and deny gender. Several of them have been known to make outspoken transphobic statements. I've not heard Spretnak make such statements, however."
pagan,fee8yk3,t3_eopi6n,1579028853.0,"Demeter's mythology loosely matches your situation, but you may find a stronger connection to a deity based on your need. What are you praying for? To get your children back? Justice against their father? Their story might not match your situation but their emotional experiences do.

For instance, Hecate with her torches is the goddess who actually leads Persephone down into the underworld each winter, and guides her back up each spring, since Demeter doesn't go down there but stays and mourns on the surface. If you want to get your children back, Hecate might be appropriate as she is a goddess who literally leads you through dark times and is more action-driven than Demeter to get things moving. Similarly, gods who cross boundaries to the underworld, like Odin and Hermes, might assist with getting them back.

Vegetarianism,fedrbze,t3_eon39g,1579018222.0,"You're just experiencing a particular emotional shift that's causing you to rethink your current mindset. It's a perfectly normal thing, doesn't just have to do with vegetarianism, but anything that can cause someone to re-evaluate a deeply ingrained part of a lifestyle. Food, job, relationships, spirituality, it's a big moment causing all kinds of feelings.

If you like, see where it takes you. Try going veggie for a week or two, grab a pan and start cooking, experimenting, and experiencing. Monitor your feelings and your physical health every day, write it down, talk about it, express it. If you feel good and think that you can keep it up, try a longer period, and then evaluate again. It may turn into something permanent.

Above all, *don't* kick yourself for tripping up, or having sudden impulses for meat.  There are chances it could happen, we're human, you won't be a bad person. You're new to this and you can't expect to have a perfect streak the whole way through. If you decide to have meat, evaluate afterward why you did and what steps you might take to curb those impulses in future. Start slow and go easy. And if you decide it's not for you full time, you could try a semi-veggie lifestyle. The important thing is that it's getting you to think differently.

And many of its comedy episodes are love or hate with little grey area: Miss Amphipolis, Comedy of Eros, Solstice Carol, Bell Tolls. They don't have the strength of Day in the Life.

But Xena as Arminestra does a total 180 that we never really see her process, especially when The Way of the Warrior, violent fighting, is what gets her there.

Gabrielle didn't have that great an impact on Xena that she learned to talk without fighting; Xena relied on Gab to do that for her. So how does Xena feel about trading ""down"" for a life where she must always talk and never lift a weapon, and would now rely on Gab to do all the fighting for her?

If it's strictly a question of looks and not considering acting, I think the demon getup looked equally great on all three, even dirty messy Gabrielle. The crew really went all out on them, right down to hooves for closeups.

There wasn't much to Xena and Gab's angel outfits, just frilly white dresses. So I'd give it to Callisto's more ornate gold and white dress (or was it black and blue?).

Caesar was never good, he just knew how to appear that way. He knew he was a hunk and a sweet talker and could manipulate this woman. Gabrielle herself comments on his aura in the present. If Xena had been older and more experienced as a conqueror, she would never have fallen for Caesar. Instead she said she'd been feeling bored with what she'd accomplished small scale, wanted a change, and found a bigger ambition in him. He used that against her.

Yes, Xena had a lot to lose from Gabrielle's betrayal, but Gabrielle hadn't been 100% vindictive from her actions. She earnestly wanted both Xena and her daughter, and had no choice but to betray one to protect the other. Unlike Caesar, she never *wanted* to hurt Xena to get her way."
pagan,fdwrnhd,t3_en2arv,1578761697.0,"That's what the holy people of many societies were seen as, outcasts. They had a specific position and occupation within the group that was so highly specialized they couldn't discuss it with ordinary folks. And what the holy people were concerned with was something ordinary people typically stayed away from out of fear, because the spirit world or supernatural was something they didn't understand and had no control over. The holy person was a fringe element they sometimes turned to reluctantly.

Many cultures warn that the path of a shaman or a holy person is incredibly lonely. Not everyone who was chosen to be one considered it a total privilege, because it deprived them of a lot of social networks. They didn't always have families of their own, and often committed their entire lives to their work. But they were rewarded with gratitude, recognition, and sometimes had their basic needs like food and shelter provided by the group in return.

Nowadays, you don't necessarily need your basic needs provided for, but you do embody all the rest of it. Pagans of all stripes are still seen as strange, extraordinary, fringe. Many of us only have online social networks and friendships as our outlets, many have very close-knit personal friends and family. Regardless what you have, it's what you make of it.

She was prepared to join forces to conquer the world with him, and she was overjoyed when he came back after being ransomed, because she believed he came back freely.

mythology,fdqh5nw,t3_emr1kp,1578666552.0,"Egyptian myth is very elastic and was influenced by lots of forces over the centuries.

Most of the popular Egyptian myths the general public are aware of were compiled late in Egyptian history, during the New Kingdom and Graeco-Roman times when there was a lot of interaction with Classical culture. The Greek author Plutarch had an interest in Egyptian mythology and wrote his version of the myths, including one where Helen of Troy took refuge in Egypt during the Trojan War. Since Classical documentation survived so well, these are the ones that became part of popular imagination in the 19th and 20th centuries when the Egyptology craze hit.

Purely Egyptian versions of many myths from the Old and Middle Kingdom exist but are less well known and mostly of academic interest. For example, early myth contended there were only four children of Nut: Osiris, Set, Isis and Nephthys. Later Greek-written myth added Horus the Elder/Hamarchis after Osiris, and he became a warrior comrade of Horus in the conflict with Set, as well as the face of the Sphinx in one version of its origin.

The older versions come mostly from tomb, palace and other building inscriptions, and were written in hieroglyphs. This made them less physically accessible to scholars than the popular Greek versions, which were written as books and well preserved since all reputable Classical scholars knew Greek and Latin, but studies in Egyptian language didn't really ramp up until the Rosetta Stone had been cracked."

My family compromises on their beliefs to keep harmony. My brother is vegetarian, his family is omni.

So in the spirit of compromise, if meat shopping is too hard for you, is there a way that you can arrange that your family always do all the grocery shopping with their money so that everyone is satisfied?

mythology,ff97n36,t3_esd1ou,1579706735.0,"I love sun mythology. I've always appreciated the Chinese version because there are actually two pieces of it that almost nobody reads together.

The most popular version is the story of the False Suns, where ten suns were scorching the earth, and the heavenly archer Yi shot down nine of them so that the earth would be spared. He became the god of the remaining Sun, while his wife Chang'e became the Moon Goddess and the goddess of the annual Mid-Autumn Festival.

The obscure myth is the origin of the ten suns, the ""prequel"" to the Yi myth. The ten suns are the crow children of the female sun goddess Xihe, and they would perch on a Fusang tree at the Eastern edge of the world. Each day, Xihe would yoke one of them to her chariot and drive it across heaven. But one day, the other nine crows got bored waiting their turn on the tree and decided to all go flying at once, which caused the scorched earth. Then the myth of Yi starts.

It's interesting because the Yi myth is sort of a ""next-gen"" sun myth to the original, but Yi gets all the glory being a great hero who saved the world. It discounts the fact that he had to put down the crows, and there is no mention of mother Xihe's remorse at the loss of all but one of her children. It's also interesting that because of Yi, Chinese philosophy makes the solar or *yang* principle masculine to the moon's feminine *yin.* But the original myth it was female/female with Xihe and Changxi, the previous moon goddess."

mythology,ff5t3ai,t3_ert4b3,1579609211.0,"I recall one Chinese myth about a boy with a magic pen. He had to draw all his subjects lacking a body part such as a leg or a hand or eyes, because drawing the whole thing would bring the art to life and draw attention to his power.

I think this belief is in part behind early Muslim depictions of Muhammad, which leave out his eyes or his face, because they believed the complete figure risks idolatry. When the Buddhist caves in Asia were plundered, the raiders scratched out the eyes on every image of Buddha.

I doubt any of this inspired the Weeping Angels though. Theirs was probably influenced by the need for a viewer's physical gaze, rather than the Angel itself. Unlike the stone statues which *don't* want people looking at them, a picture of an Angel is useless unless there's someone around to look at it."

xena,fevmc7t,t3_eqnwjw,1579399054.0,"I like Bones for bringing us back to the Northern Amazons, because I happen to enjoy that group. But Bones has a bunch of problems mostly in the way it was put together. Important characters leave in this episode with small regard, and there are a lot of inconsistencies with Sin Trade.

Bones was clearly meant to be the season's Hallowe'en episode that freaked you out with images of blood and scary things. But it just wasn't written *as* a horror episode, not like Family Affair or Haunting of Amphipolis. Virtually the only eerie thing was the dream at the beginning, and that was more funny with the CGI.

Steven Sears originally had an explanation for Otere's absence, but the rewrite doesn't even give that. Yakut is simply the leader now, no arguing, and Xena knew even before they headed there. Yakut isn't a bad character, and it's admirable that she still demonstrates naivete even as the leader. But her presence just isn't strong enough to justify being a useful sidekick of the week.

As a way to give Jen Sky an exit for C2525, Amarice is left with this tribe, but it's a tribe that she had no affiliation with before and is a stranger to their ways. Better to have left her with the Greeks, at least she had some prior history with them. The revelation that she's not actually an Amazon was very rushed and rather

We now have the Tree of Amber and Chi'ah. I find it hard to believe that this element of Northern culture sprang up in the year since we last saw them, especially since Chi'ah has the power to read minds and identify Amazons, that even Alti couldn't.

I forgive the skeleton fights because they were a creative way to cover Lucy's pregnancy. What I found awkward were the shamanic travel bits that were intercut with clips of nature footage: storms, spiders, alligators chewing fish. Sin Trade didn't have any of this during its sequences, and it seemed a cheesy way to cut corners."
xena,feu0oc9,t3_eqdt0f,1579381976.0,"I don't know whether I see Gabrielle settling down with a family post-FIN. The way it ended she was taking Xena's place in the world, and she has no guilty past which was a factor in Xena nearly giving up when she tried to do it solo. I feel Gab could continue fighting for decades while she writes more, so that she becomes the best of them combined. When she couldn't fight anymore, she'd retire and continue to write until she passes.

I also favour Sarah as the ancestor because I don't like the idea that both Xena and Gabrielle's siblings and their families suffer and the family lines end because of their adventures. Lila and Gabrielle both lost their husbands, but Lila deserves a place in the family tree as the only surviving sibling; Xena's are all gone if we're still ruling Toris out."

You can use the gallery to see which weapons each character has unlocked, and you need the entire roster plus all five of each weapon every character has. This means it won't be complete until you get far into Lorule since the last character and his weapons are there. 

It is possible to bypass collecting some of the lower tier weapons and go straight for the 4+ ones. Acquiring those unlocks the entire range of them. But for most characters it's harder and since you'll have inferior weapons, you'll need plenty of weapon buffs, badges and EXP."

Essentially, it's a goal for nearing completion of Adventure mode. But again, by that time you'll have such strong weapons on every character by default, that the purple skill will be redundant for many weapons that have it."

Until then, you're better off selling purple weapons, or moving useful skills they have to non-purple weapons.

However, I'd suggest that the hidden purple skill on the regular weapons is not that useful once you fully unlock the Master Sword, since by then you'll be so far in the game that it's more for cosmetic purposes than anything. You're better off just ignoring it, IMO."

sailormoon,fen1xkz,t3_eq1aso,1579275152.0,"S for sure, not just because of the darker horror imagery. After two seasons exploring the hearts, minds, and lives of the Inner Senshi, they become the reactionary characters to the older, cynical foils who walk into their lives. There's strife among the teams who should be working together.

Haruka and Michiru, who have never known Usagi and never seen the positive power of her emotions, see only the ditzy airhead girl and dismiss her and her friends as childish idealists. In Japanese culture, older family members, students, and friends are to be looked up to as sources of inspiration. But it doesn't help when Uranus and Neptune see the Inners as useless obstacles in the way of their mission.

Hotaru is also the daughter of the maniacal villain, but full of depression and aloofness. She can't believe it when the sweet, innocent and uplifting Chibiusa becomes part of her life, and to see her manipulated and exploited by her father is heartbreaking. And the fact that the Outers are prepared to kill her at any cost to fulfill their mission is scary.

S is a season where the Inners are exposed to something that seems infinitely bigger than themselves. They want to have a voice, that voice of optimism that got them through the last seasons, but the older people keep shooting them down. The Outers have to go through some violent, brutal experience to realize how wrong they are and these girls know what they're talking about."

mythology,fejrbil,t3_epj2wo,1579183900.0,"Humans are assholes, and it says something that the Greek gods behave much more human than Yahweh. Zeus is a serial rapist, a child kidnapper, a murderer. His wife is forced to accept his sleeping around because she can't get back at him directly, and punishes his women instead. He was so afraid of his position being toppled that he devoured the goddess Metis like his own father had done to him.

We often call ""acts of God"" beyond our abilities, like weather accidents to be unfair and accept the fallout. Yahweh supernaturally floods the world, causes plagues, mass murders, treats his handpicked favourites like royalty, and there's nothing we can do. But I think it's worse that Zeus commits the worst acts *humans* can commit and are punished, but he gets away with it because he can. It's truly assholish for a capricious god who commits very human crimes to be beyond human justice.

So if I can't say it's a tie they both lose, I pick Zeus."
HyruleWarriors,fejmqmn,t3_ephx6h,1579180103.0,"This game like Dynasty Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors is very repetitive. Hack-n'slash games are all about hitting things until they fall down.

There is some strategy to organize your team on the field and choosing the right missions to level up your weapons and experience. But at its core, this is a repetitive game.

*But* it is mindless addictive fun, very easy to pick up and learn. And this game is a gigantic love letter to Zelda fans.

It's one of the best modern examinations of the Amazons' historical origins and it was consulted in creating the horseback fighting styles of the Amazons in the Wonder Woman movie. She also gave an excellent lecture on them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=378zVUpeopY).
pagan,feghtq2,t1_feempd5,1579093215.0,"Unfortunately I'm not aware of anyone meeting that specific. I'm aware of figures who changed sexes in order to accomplish things, then changed back afterward. If they stayed in the other form, they'd be limited in their influence or shunned. Regrettably, the majority is men transforming into women, and there always seems to be the binary notion that to exist as the opposite is undesirable and degrading. If there was a positive depiction, it's quite obscure. Cybele had the priesthood of the galli, but that was castration while keeping the same sex according to documentation, so I'm not sure how helpful it is. I suspect viewing them as trans women is a modern interpretation only.

I think a challenge is that so much of Western awareness of mythology comes from the three cultures that were elevated in our history: Classical, Norse, and Celtic. And all three of these strongly embraced sexual binary. It seems a good parallel of your experience would be investigating cultures that openly recognized third and fourth genders, and seeing what figures they turned to for guidance. Indigenous Two-Spirit people and Mahu of Hawaii come to mind. But if you're not of those cultures, it's difficult to be equally authentic and respectful in practice.

I don't know the requirements of your degree, but would aligning yourself with a goddess who lies outside your comfort zone be acceptable as a challenge to grow?"
pagan,feehmg5,t3_eoqmqo,1579033925.0,"Goddess Spirituality practitioners advocate your exact concern, that the Classical depiction of Athena is a patriarchal construct. She was born from the male Zeus' head after he devoured the goddess Metis, thus she wasn't born naturally from a mother, but unnaturally from a father only. And she is pledged eternally to Zeus, his most loyal follower. Athena's seen as a hypocritical creation because despite men's deep reverence for her, a human woman was never allowed to fight on the battlefield as she did.

Charlene Spretnak's *Lost Goddesses of Early Greece* attempts to recreate a feminist version of the perceived pre-Hellenic Athena influenced by Minoan culture and Asia Minor. Athena is a face of the universal Great Goddess of feminist spirituality, born out of the Mother. She is a gentle goddess of wisdom and textiles, but her warrior aspect is removed, as Spretnak believed it was an addition of Mycenaean patriarchy. This myth was a meditative creation of Spretnak's, so I can't speak for its legitimacy, but it's inspiring.

Goddess Spirituality also views traditional notions of virginity as patriarchal, that a man must determine when a woman has lost it and therefore her value. These reconstructed goddesses like Athena, Artemis had no male partners or children, but were considered virgins as being ""one in herself,"" not necessarily abstaining from sex but remaining independent from men or marriage or from having children. To them a virgin goddess retains a vibrant sex life, Artemis of exclusively women, Aphrodite of both women and men.

Of course, you may be aware that Goddess Spirituality is a product of 70s and 80s second-wave feminism, and followers often strongly adhere to sexual binary and deny gender. Several of them have been known to make outspoken transphobic statements. I've not heard Spretnak make such statements, however."
pagan,fee8yk3,t3_eopi6n,1579028853.0,"Demeter's mythology loosely matches your situation, but you may find a stronger connection to a deity based on your need. What are you praying for? To get your children back? Justice against their father? Their story might not match your situation but their emotional experiences do.

For instance, Hecate with her torches is the goddess who actually leads Persephone down into the underworld each winter, and guides her back up each spring, since Demeter doesn't go down there but stays and mourns on the surface. If you want to get your children back, Hecate might be appropriate as she is a goddess who literally leads you through dark times and is more action-driven than Demeter to get things moving. Similarly, gods who cross boundaries to the underworld, like Odin and Hermes, might assist with getting them back.

Plenty of deities would assist you with justice as a mother against the father, such as Ma'at, the Egyptian goddess of restoring law and order who can assist with a court case, the Furies if you're after revenge, etc."

Food, job, relationships, spirituality, it's a big moment causing all kinds of feelings.

If you like, see where it takes you. Try going veggie for a week or two, grab a pan and start cooking, experimenting, and experiencing. Monitor your feelings and your physical health every day, write it down, talk about it, express it. If you feel good and think that you can keep it up, try a longer period, and then evaluate again. It may turn into something permanent.

Above all, *don't* kick yourself for tripping up, or having sudden impulses for meat.  There are chances it could happen, we're human, you won't be a bad person. You're new to this and you can't expect to have a perfect streak the whole way through. If you decide to have meat, evaluate afterward why you did and what steps you might take to curb those impulses in future. Start slow and go easy. And if you decide it's not for you full time, you could try a semi-veggie lifestyle. The important thing is that it's getting you to think differently.

Instead she said she'd been feeling bored with what she'd accomplished small scale, wanted a change, and found a bigger ambition in him. He used that against her.

Yes, Xena had a lot to lose from Gabrielle's betrayal, but Gabrielle hadn't been 100% vindictive from her actions. She earnestly wanted both Xena and her daughter, and had no choice but to betray one to protect the other. Unlike Caesar, she never *wanted* to hurt Xena to get her way."

And what the holy people were concerned with was something ordinary people typically stayed away from out of fear, because the spirit world or supernatural was something they didn't understand and had no control over. The holy person was a fringe element they sometimes turned to reluctantly.

Many cultures warn that the path of a shaman or a holy person is incredibly lonely. Not everyone who was chosen to be one considered it a total privilege, because it deprived them of a lot of social networks. They didn't always have families of their own, and often committed their entire lives to their work. But they were rewarded with gratitude, recognition, and sometimes had their basic needs like food and shelter provided by the group in return.

Nowadays, you don't necessarily need your basic needs provided for, but you do embody all the rest of it. Pagans of all stripes are still seen as strange, extraordinary, fringe.

mythology,fdqh5nw,t3_emr1kp,1578666552.0,"Egyptian myth is very elastic and was influenced by lots of forces over the centuries.

Most of the popular Egyptian myths the general public are aware of were compiled late in Egyptian history, during the New Kingdom and Graeco-Roman times when there was a lot of interaction with Classical culture. The Greek author Plutarch had an interest in Egyptian mythology and wrote his version of the myths, including one where Helen of Troy took refuge in Egypt during the Trojan War. Since Classical documentation survived so well, these are the ones that became part of popular imagination in the 19th and 20th centuries when the Egyptology craze hit.

Purely Egyptian versions of many myths from the Old and Middle Kingdom exist but are less well known and mostly of academic interest. For example, early myth contended there were only four children of Nut: Osiris, Set, Isis and Nephthys. Later Greek-written myth added Horus the Elder/Hamarchis after Osiris, and he became a warrior comrade of Horus in the conflict with Set, as well as the face of the Sphinx in one version of its origin.

The older versions come mostly from tomb, palace and other building inscriptions, and were written in hieroglyphs. This made them less physically accessible to scholars than the popular Greek versions, which were written as books and well preserved since all reputable Classical scholars knew Greek and Latin, but studies in Egyptian language didn't really ramp up until the Rosetta Stone had been cracked."
paganism,fdo9h5n,t3_emev5t,1578601202.0,"You're asking how you can guarantee a 100% success for you and get them to be comfortable with your openness about it. There's no real way we can guarantee anything since we have no real way of knowing how your parents will react, either immediately or in the long term seeing you practice.

For that much, you're just going to have to take your chances with open honesty. Be calm, be collected, be friendly, explain what your paganism is and what it isn't, and hope for the best. Above all, you can emphasize that your love for your parents doesn't change just because your personal beliefs differ.

Good luck."
xena,fdo78eu,t3_emewux,1578600102.0,"I didn't think she was a very good actor either way. Livia was definitely more interesting, but Adrienne just couldn't rein in it when she was supposed to raise her voice. There are certain really bad deliveries I remember.

""SHUTAAAP! You. *Are Not*. My mother.""

""Iiiiii'm LIVIAAAAAAHHHH!""

And that ""war cry"" she came up with she claimed was supposed to be between Xena's trill and Callisto's scream and it was just awful, a growly ""Yaaaaaaaaaargh-YAHH!""

The only thing I think Adrienne nailed was that Livia was an overacting spoiled brat who always got her way. The problem is her acting didn't make it seem intentional, it was just so poor that Livia *was* annoying. When Adrienne got to play simpering Eve, at least it was in a range she could handle.

I was far more intimidated by Hudson as Callisto or Lucy as Evil Xena because they had more subtle control over emoting. I think Adrienne definitely had the look, but I don't think she was the right choice to play."

suggestmeabook,fdno22u,t3_embg1u,1578589749.0,"Tailchaser's Song by Tad Williams, his first book. It's like The Hobbit if it were made with cats. It's a fantasy story where animals have their own personified culture and language. Although set in the real world, the mysterious bipedal creatures called M'an are considered the deformed descendants of cats, or as they call themselves The Folk, in their mythology.

It's the point of view of a young feral cat, Fritti Tailchaser, who goes to rescue his love and investigate disappearances of other cats. He meets the first wild cats and also cat gods from their own myths.

A light and fun read, very immersive. Like Tolkien he also invented a cat language with a dictionary at the back."

Despite all of her physical skills, Xena is a tremendously flawed person with a serious attitude problem, and she stays grounded because of Gabrielle. Xena doesn't attract people to her, either; she's not immediately known as a hero like Hercules and has to prove herself to others."

And I agree 4+ could have had lightning.

xena,fdk2psz,t3_eln2rc,1578494608.0,"Nobody suspected that Callisto would go after Gabrielle at that point. She'd only just broken out of jail, and in the first night raid on the village she fought Xena as usual.

The next night, their wedding night, Xena was tracking Callisto.

 X:  â€œCome on, Theodorus.  She knew I was coming.  Sheâ€™s much too good a hostess not to be here to greet me.â€  Th:  â€œIâ€™m telling you the truth.  When I told her you were travelling without Gabrielle-- she said, â€˜Perfect,â€™ and left.â€ 

Xena was surprised at this. She and Gab had assumed that since they were apart, Callisto would only go after Xena and Gab would be safe."

suggestmeabook,fdjzxha,t3_els78h,1578492558.0,"I love Joanne Harris' *Chocolat* trilogy. It's magical realism. Two of the books take place in a cold, antiquated little French village, and the protagonist is a vivacious woman who sweeps in and transforms the community with her chocolates and personality. Guaranteed to make you hungry, read on a full stomach.

The first book was made into a 2000 film with Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench and Johnny Depp but took most of the magic out of the book.

xena,fdhgekl,t3_eleg24,1578422089.0,"While it's a nice gesture, Gabrielle's role in the show has been as Xena's companion first and an Amazon second. For Gabrielle to leave Xena behind, even if Helicon and Back is only a few episodes before the series finale, means that she prioritized her Amazon role, and she would never do that. Gabrielle only stayed a Queen in Season 2 when she believed Xena was dead and she needed to find a new place in the world. But while Xena was alive, it didn't matter.

Rob Tapert said that the point of Helicon and Last of the Centaurs was to wipe out the Amazons and the Centaurs beyond hope of restoration, so that they've faded into myth in modern day. Gab would have led a dwindling group of less than a dozen women, the last of a nation of hundreds that had been built up over centuries. Had the Amazons *not* been wiped out, I could certainly see her settling down as Queen of the united nation, post-FIN."
