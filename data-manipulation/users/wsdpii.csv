PrequelMemes,ffp6k75,t1_ffp2q7h,1580087505.0,"Problem is that it's pretty much the same way they treated the Separatists. A few characters were nuanced but the majority of the time the separatists were using bioweapons, bombing civilians, downright executing civilians, executing prisoners, and overall being cartoon villains. The Empire gets the same treatment in Rebels, a few nuanced characters to show that 'not all bad guys are absolute monsters, but most are'. It's one of my biggest complaints about both shows, but at the end of the day they are made for a younger audience, so I can excuse that."
DaystromInstitute,ffnbwx8,t3_eu5a1y,1580064145.0,"What makes the story even better, in my eyes, is the fact that a older Soong tried to bring a resurgence of the Augments during the ENT era. He was imprisoned for life, and Archer was pretty much ordered to hunt down and eliminate the Augments at any cost, which he did, including the murder of dozens if not hundreds of unborn children. This was considered okay, justified even by the audience. 

Now, the children of the modern Soong are suffering the same fate, for the same reasons. If we were following the journeys of a modern captain instead of Picard we might be on board with them hunting down androids. To them they do not see Data, the caring and selfless man that Picard knew, they see the monsters that butchered countless innocent people, many of whom may have been family.

Both stories tie in closely with the American experience after 9/11. Augments and Androids are capable of these things, it's their nature. Just as many Americans believe that Iraqis and Afghans are always, deep down, capable of these things. We always forget that everyone is capable of horrible things, everyone can kill, and we forget because we don't want to admit that we are flawed. In Star Trek they make the excuses of heightened aggression, instability, superiority complexes, bad programming, and more to justify why we need to keep these people from being allowed to exist. In real life we make the excuse of culture, religion, being poor."

Any more improvements I should make?"
PrequelMemes,ffjgxvh,t1_ffjfh9r,1579998011.0,"First two seasons were kinda bland, but that can be said about a lot of TV shows. However my favorite episode was Rookies from Season 1. A lot of stories and arcs, especially early on, seemed to be lifted from other canon sources. There was a lot of disregard for other stories, canon, and continuity overall. For instance, the Mandalorian arc, while honestly one of the more well written arcs of the show, kinda flew in the face of a lot of existing lore. Anakin and Obi-Wan fighting Grievous multiple times in spite of the fact that they were supposedly meeting him for the first time in Episode III. Same with Dooku.

I personally would have preferred if they made the stories about characters other than Anakin/Obiwan or other characters that we know make it to the next movie. A lot of death fakeouts and 'tension' don't resonate with me because I know these guys are going to be fine. My favorite episodes and arcs were the ones that focused on original characters like the aforementioned Rookies, or the Umbara campaign. It really weakened the show for me. While I enjoy these episodes, I can't really sit down and binge watch the show like I can others.

It also went out of its way to make the villains all seem cartoonish. Dooku goes from a respectable but still evil guy to a somewhat incompetent sleazebag during the show, imagining crazy over the top schemes to thwart the Republic. It feels really goofy.

That's just my opinion though, I know a lot of people who love it. It's not that I hate it, I just don't particularly like it. I have the same general feeling about Rebels. I only watched the show for the first time last year, so it doesn't have any nostalgic feeling for me."

The only advice I can really give you is something I learned from the philosophy of Stoicism. Primarily, learning to accept that you can't change how other people feel and that you shouldn't base your own feelings towards yourself based on them. I realized that I was basing my own personal happiness on how others perceived me, on whether or not I was in a relationship, whether or not I'd felt a woman's love. I needed to base my happiness on myself, how I felt, what I wanted. You can change yourself, you can't change others.
