On Elementary: I did merely *once* last week (though had a really insane number of obligations that prevented me from subbing) and that was enough to fill my appetite for *that* work for a while. If that's the only thing available, then that's that, I have no choice, But it's hard and can be annoying.

I will admit that I *super* super quickly-- so ya know, not abusively-- and super quietly once definitely muttered under my breath to a really verbal middle schooler (not rude but wouldn't shut up)  ""I don't have the energy to answer all this *and* drive home"" and I was telling the truth. And it sort of... well, it worked. Once at a high school I sort of said as much in an even less perfectly professional way, nothing terrible at all, but nothing awesome

Another thought: I genuinely have some fear of middle and SOMEtimes high, where you rely on them to tell them their names (for me 100% of the time this is true, never any seating chart) and once in a while some jokester trys to play a small prank. It's annoying but it is what it is"

PostConcussion,ff3adi8,t1_ff22hwv,1579537342.0,"valuable info. yeah no everyone swears by atlas. do you take nortriptyline or amitriptyline (I believe its called)? Nortriptyline sorta wipes me out, I'm TRYING to decide how I feel about it, it's really fucking hard. I'm on a way low dosage, it also sorta wakes me up which I like. But honest to god I have that side effect of massive pupils and it's a huge bummer, it sort of has put driving out of the picture, and I now have to see an eye doc for that. I could always get off but I dunno, and for one thing I feel like it'd be a big production. I have all these atypical sensations in my skull and I can't for the life of me decide if it's migraines, having abused sumitrptan and abortives, or what the fuck it is. Everything I'm experience could be SPECIFICALLY due to nortriptyline. Again, I like that it wakes me up and I probably couldve used the antidepressive qualities in it years ago but it could be precisely what's causing the atypical sensations in my skull and the massive massive pupils and thus insane photophobia and also it causes general jitteriness in me that has me mildly alarmed. I have a super tiny under control but existant cardiac history and I know you're supposed to be super careful giving out nortriptyline in these cases. But my dosage is so stupid low. I dunno. Pardon my rant."

Take the spoon out of my hand etc. Bizarre. She's totalled three cars in literally a week, ruining our lives with her now astronomical auto insurance rates, and hollers at me if I feel like shit and take an Uber.
