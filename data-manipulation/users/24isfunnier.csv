Ult reminds me that Denzel goes in on ZUU."
hiphopheads,ffbhi19,t1_ffbhd84,1579765530.0,"Ultralight Beam is a great track, but I was thinking about the hardest first tracks. Ultralight Beam is kinda the opposite of that."

hiphopheads,ffbe2jo,t3_esl8e8,1579761358.0,"Hardest intro/first track of an album? These tracks come to mind for me 

Jeapordy (Run The Jewels 2)

If You Know You Know (DAYTONA)

On Sight (Yeezus)

Beef Rap (MM...FOOD)

Edit:

Straight Outta Compton (Straight Outta Compton)

hiphopheads,ffaqbso,t1_ffajova,1579742002.0,"That song has political undertones but it's not the main theme of the song. I think more political songs by Kanye (that are really good but I forgot about them when making my comment), are Crack Music and Two Words. Gorgeous also has a lot of political lyrics but like New Slaves it also has other themes."
hiphopheads,ffagscg,t3_es1uct,1579735391.0,Best political hip hop songs? I'm thinking of Fuck Tha Police and also Reagan by Killer Mike. There's definitely some Ice Cube to be mentioned but unfortunately haven't listened to his solo works yet.
Kanye,ff8jz3v,t1_ff8elry,1579682059.0,"I was gonna be like ""but Kanye has been releasing better albums than Eminem"", but then I remembered Jesus Is King happened..."

Sat,fepvdba,t1_fepqrw2,1579332648.0,"Hopefully you see this, because you should really edit that comment to delete your email, and then private message it so only the tutor sees your email rather than everyone on the internet."
hiphopheads,fem82kc,t3_epwhog,1579243144.0,"Kinda weird, but really excited to see the first week sales, it's probably gonna be the highest first week sales in the year, and already in January. Considering Kamikaze was also a surprise and sold 434,000 after Revival, I think this could potentially do 500,000 or close (but then there was that new Billboard merch rule so idk). It's better, longer/more tracks, and Godzilla is gonna chart. 

 I was really expecting (and wanted) Mac to get the #1, but this is Eminem, it's no competition."
hiphopheads,fem7bae,t3_epw42x,1579242337.0,Posse cut of the year already?
hiphopheads,fem5g4z,t1_fem529g,1579240412.0,"Oh definitely, I still have to listen to his other albums to do that. But, people usually say MotM 2 is his 2nd best album, and I personally like PPDS more, so in theory it's a top 2."
hiphopheads,fem513i,t3_epvqw0,1579239994.0,Those Kinda Nights is the better FACK
hiphopheads,fem4t1f,t1_fem4kqf,1579239772.0,"Second best solo imo (I've only listened to MotM 1 and 2, but many say those are his 2 best)"

hiphopheads,fem3nvj,t1_fem3cq7,1579238681.0,Oh cool didn't know that.
hiphopheads,fem3mck,t1_fem2x8w,1579238643.0,"Yeah I thought Mac was easily gonna get the #1, and then Eminem surprise dropped."
hiphopheads,fem1v4i,t1_fem0rtk,1579237032.0,"Did they really flop? Heartless hit number 1, and after 3 months, it's sitting at 126 million streams on Spotify, with Blinding Lights as 176 million streams. I wouldn't call those flops, maybe compared to his prior hits but still, a lot of steams."
hiphopheads,fem15te,t3_epktcp,1579236409.0,"I listened to Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin' and really liked it. The reception to this album wasn't that good but I thought it was great. I definitely think it can be shortened, making the album a little more focused and each of the tracks more memorable, but I like almost every track on here so I'm fine with it."
hiphopheads,fei3424,t1_feg414a,1579129220.0,"I guess you're right, but what does Kanye have to do with this?"
hiphopheads,fdzuhdk,t1_fdzj6pg,1578796085.0,Yeah I've been interested in watching that I should start. I'm starting to go back and listening to influential/popular hip hop records from the 80s.
hiphopheads,fdzb9nk,t3_enbecs,1578788458.0,When did cursing become common in hip hop? Was it because of NWA?
hiphopheads,fdss21r,t3_emyacv,1578707205.0,"I finally listened to TESTING and liked it, thought it was pretty good. It's not a very strong album, but most of the songs are good and there aren't any real low points. I haven't listened to other Rocky records but I don't think this is a solid standard if it's his worst."
