NintendoSwitch,ff96ho3,t3_esaep7,1579705987.0,"Hello all. I‚Äôve had my switch a year and a half (so no more warrantee) and about 3 months ago my speakers started crackling if I was at any volume over 50%. This morning as I was playing a game the sound cut off completely. I‚Äôve restarted the system many times, tried multiple different games, and tried different volume levels but nothing comes out of the physical speakers. I do play my switch a lot but I don‚Äôt understand how less than two years of use can cause the speakers to implode. There is sound with headphones. 
Nintendo says it will cost $100 bucks to repair but I‚Äôve read some posts on here on replacement speakers around $30 bucks. I am not handy but my dad is familiar with electronics repair, but not necessarily Nintendo products. Is it worth it to gamble on the cheaper speakers or does my broke, unemployed ass have to shill out $100?"

I think so. But that‚Äôs just not the world we live in now. 
I honestly suggest teaching yourself to sew or alter an existing piece to your taste. At the end of the day you will have a piece that you are much more proud of and is made exactly to your tastes/size and might end up cheaper. I know it‚Äôs not fair but it is what it is.

ayearofwarandpeace,fejubcp,t3_epg1fv,1579186022.0,"Once again noting super deep, but I wanted to mention how I relate to Natasha. I was a very late bloomer. I remember being in sixth and seventh grade and how all the other girls wanted to talk about boys and clothes but I just wished we still had recess and could play on the swings again. I consciously clung to childhood well into my teen years. I knew adulthood and all its responsibilities were coming and wondered if I could push them off a bit more by choosing to be a child. But almost in spite of myself I began to notice the boys in my class in a different way than before. Looking back I kind of cringe when I imagine myself trying to get a boys attention behind a veil of forced childish playfulness. To an older adult they might find it cute but I can only imagine other teenagers saw through it and wished I would just be myself. I give Natasha a little slack because she‚Äôs only 13 but that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm reading her now, a young woman using her last threads of childhood to get away with acting immature in public and testing the waters with boys."

I try to write anything but I‚Äôm overly critical and just don‚Äôt feel the magic. It really does help to try and take care of yourself like you would another person. If I saw another person beating themselves up like I do I would swoop in and put a stop to all that crap. Whether this funk is chemical or external, we can‚Äôt always control it and creativity isn‚Äôt something we can force to flow. We gotta sit at the drum or at the writing desk and try. If nothing happens we can go back to the couch and watch more Bobs Burgers but if we don‚Äôt try we might miss that golden opportunity that sparks something beautiful.

First, it may not be professional but I‚Äôve found that folding masking tape over the edges of fabric keeps fraying to a minimum while embroidering. If the linen is as nice and sturdy as it sounds it would definitely be safe to put on a hoop.
