Dissociation,feo1w29,t1_fenzxv5,1579294061.0,Yes. It's also my normal way of operating. I meant to post this in c-ptsd but put it here. Must have zoned out again.
Psychic,fenwt9t,t3_eo08mx,1579292062.0,I'd like a general reading;especially about me and future.
Psychic,fenusx9,t3_epuygb,1579291154.0,"Is it called clairsentience? Precognition? I had so many similar moments where I'd think of someone, and I'd see them in the next 5 seconds. 

I'd be sitting and let my mind wandering when suddenly I think of bikes and riding it in the cold. Then others would talk about it seconds later. I can chalk most of these to coincidences, but there was one incident where I dreamed about a cafe with lots of detail. I mean to the exact details of a very unique, new cafe that I haven't been before. Next day we go on a road trip and stop there. Exact same place! I felt hilariously weird, strange, like a massive deja-vu. What the hell seriously"
Empaths,fenu5fs,t1_fe3zarq,1579290763.0,"Does that still hold true if your true self is unlikeable? Everyone says sense of humour of course, but I feel like changing to be someone with a great sense of humour won't come naturally to me. Guess it makes sense I don't have anyone falling in love with me"
Empaths,fentale,t1_fe3z0a8,1579290489.0,"Has anyone experienced it and later talked about it? I had one instance where it was extremely intense when I was with someone else. She kept staring at me as if she saw a ghost, and looking back at her felt extremely difficult because of how intense it felt for no reason. I found myself caring about her greatly for really no reason as well. We'd also behave in strangely similar ways and like turn our heads to stare at each other at the same time and such."
depression,fendvix,t3_epzm0m,1579282580.0,"Do you also constantly expect things like love or care from others? Or feel like your self-worth or happiness kinda depends on them?

I felt blank since forever too. Others commented I was empty or calm too. I was actually being a chameleon, shifting my personality to suit them. I'd almost be like them so I could harmonize with everyone. Trying to priotize myself today, it might help!"
CPTSD,fedwx1d,t1_fedw6vb,1579021619.0,I looked at a somatic experiencing video once and realized I had the hip flexor muscle malfunction related to trauma. I guess that does it now. Thank you. Can I do them alone?
Dissociation,fedkq8w,t1_fdsap0c,1579013950.0,"Leg wiggle, almost like bending inwards? I absolutely can't relax past a further point, my stomach and legs start getting involuntary movements."
Empaths,fe3nonn,t3_en2y9c,1578851099.0,It's beautiful as long as they're not bad people.
depression,fe3i5ii,t3_ennxn0,1578849453.0,"Depression itself makes you focus pretty hard on yourself. Try to change your focus on other things that have nothing to do with you. This takes away from social anxiety, could even greatly improve it."
aftergifted,fdmrqo8,t3_em2i9m,1578562519.0,"Absolutely. The moment I got back home, sure I'd enjoy the quiet time and free time activities, but it would take little time before I start wanting interaction. Like very often I'd choose to be with others if given the option. 

Then I looked at my interactions, I almost always wanted there to be a talk or discussion rather than silence and I'd poke fun at people. Later I simply decided to live in the present moment more and conclude past matters. Now I can just say hi and feel almost no anxiety talking to anyone. My behaviour can be overly confident and lively too.

I'd say the inner world/interests takes away a lot from what would be your interest and attention towards others. That sounds like an automatic disposition to being more introverted and also to retain introverted qualities while still being as extroverted as you can get."
Empaths,fdddxte,t3_eknqrd,1578307756.0,"This is one superpower I'd love to see more in myself if I have it. I picked up on anger and someone's excitement. I was able to push away the anger because I had no more bad feelings for that person but they did. It seemed like if I were to strongly disagree with the projected feeling, I would definitely %100 be able to push it away and clearly discern it wasn't from me. 

If the feeling went away after you distanced yourself and you very clearly don't feel that way anymore, doesn't that just mean it was from them? I want this power lol. No more wondering, no more games and you can try and choose to be with someone who actually likes you."
Dissociation,fd6dr7u,t3_ek5eiu,1578189424.0,"I realized how I've been getting so lost in my head. We being anxious and desiring control, the head goes overdrive to solve and over-think things. Years ago, the moment I had full presence was when I left a class to get food without a care in the world. Then played volleyball and I had the most amazing flow experience and performed extremely well, but for the entire past month, I was absolutely terrible. Went from failure to most pro player that day. Basically the most present I was able to get. It was that activity that fully got me out of my head. No care in the world, people, and activity.

An easier general trick is this. I was fully stuck in over-thinking hell but one day in bus, I simply stared at my phone with my full attention, and realized that it felt so much better and different. So instead of getting lost in your head, bother yourself with things in the present moment. Also I'm glad you survived. Also the dissociation is probably causing anxiety by default, you'll see a difference if you try these 2 things."
self,fd2o3r8,t1_fd26v2x,1578149975.0,"That is true, f that downvoter. One always comes down to not having a purpose because we aren't assigned one. The moment someone says one negative but realistic thing, everyone gets triggered. You probably should care less, especially about fitting in what's really an imagined construct."
Rateme,fcobk0w,t3_ei3ri0,1577828227.0,"Why nobody wrote yet? I see untapped potential. With some gel and styling, you'd look like a badass mafia of some sorts. I see only positive."
Dissociation,fck6by1,t3_ehjl15,1577717829.0,"I started writing a diary on onenote to prevent the day loss a little bit. Wrote from both pc and phone. It helped me get over the sadness and despondency I felt from not remembering my days and feeling like I was losing and wasting them all in a dream. It also helps to try and change things in your life to your liking, any steps in any direction, anything helps."
CPTSD,fcieo6e,t3_eh4pzk,1577661411.0,"Exactly the same. I ended up damaged, eccentric and overly open towards everything. I just don't have the same around me, they usually turn into bad people rather than growing, because it takes awareness. The ""click"" people talk about has been impossible for me, doesn't matter if I'm myself. I never click with another."
depression,fcidpdm,t1_fci9jcu,1577661010.0,"That question doesn't even have good answers to begin with. Maybe it's ""to worship god or see it's power"", lol ok boomers. Maybe it's to eat, shit, sleep and survive successfully till you die. Ok then! Maybe we're just filling up a green bar in the loading screen of an alien's science project, lmao. The question itself either has no meaningful answers or it hasn't revealed itself yet. Even then, we're not really getting closer to anything in particular.

I could say it was all an accident or result of strange interactions between atoms but then why is there so much order in the grand scheme of things? I'm not religious in the slightest but I wouldn't be surprised if one day science itself proves there's an energy that's responsable for existence"
Dissociation,fc73vzu,t1_fc72e9c,1577496848.0,"You might have low insight and might not realize how bad you really are right now, but you damn well best not give up. I know some people with DID can tend to automatically refer to himself/herself with ""us"", but you know you're just one person right? Those are all parts of you, but split due to trauma.

You sound like a nice, warm person and I hope you'll figure things out with some nice co-op with a psychologist.  Listen to this  now. The years you can't remember are likely years of some extreme trauma. Plus, DID doesn't happen without trauma. If you have so much trauma before person/personality formation occurs, then you kinda split into what seems like different people just to cope with trauma.

 Some of the things you wrote also seemed way too random, almost psychotic and incoherent. If you were in extreme stress, it can happen temporary. It's a temporary symptom that can get trigged by extreme stress. Just whatever, I just wish nobody had any of this stuff."
Advice,fc66143,t3_egest5,1577473078.0,He should be crying in his own pathetic brain and you should be %100 ignoring him. It's like being made fun of due to a birth mark or something except even worse.
depression,fc3rnmx,t3_efwqy4,1577396902.0,This leads to positive existentialism and there's also the thing with life's purpose being only to live. The 2 is what I accept after having the same thoughts for slightly over a decade.
Dissociation,fbqm7rc,t3_ee6olt,1577033099.0,"Yes, sometimes I feel compelled to sit in painful emotions and purposefully listen to sad music and get lost. If I get bored on top of depressed, I'll get completely lost with a zombie stare. The trick was resisting any urges that strikes you as maladaptive. Things that feel comforting but just can't be beneficial, like daydreaming, getting lost in thoughts or drinking. 

You can push past those urges and read or distract with something. If it's a urge to cry, grieve, reach out, of course. You can try to improve your cardiovascular system, be more bold and daring in social interactions. What especially halped me, was focusing on living on my own and freedom. Try to live free, this can apply to any situation. This is all I know apart from grounding techniques that seem to work temporarily. Oh and something that takes your full focus could help a lot."
