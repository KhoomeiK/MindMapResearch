His weekly blood donations are processed into the Rhogam injections (or whatever it is called in Australia), which are given to women during and immediately after pregnancy in the case of Rh incompatibility. I received Rhogam 5 times, because I am O- and my husband is A+.  After carrying my first child, my body created antibodies that could have caused me to miscarry (or the fetus to have developmental issues) any future children. The Rhogam injections counteracted the antibodies, so my body would not reject any subsequent children my husband and I had."

I’m a SAHM if 3 (including a 15-year-old boy determined to eat us out of house and home!), and my husband does shift work (so weird hours are a thing). I love to cook, and after growing up in a family that had zero passion for anything culinary, I like to focus on complete, balanced, healthy meals. I do “Once-a-Month-Meals,” which allows me to bulk-shop, and know at a glance what is on the menu ahead of time. 

Generally, I sit down on the last weekend of the month and take inventory of what leftovers I have in my standing freezer (meals, ‘loose’ proteins, sides, etc).  Then, I ask my husband and kids what they’d like to have the following month. We don’t get too creative, but I do like to try out a new recipe or two each month. From there, I put together a calendar of meals, making sure I don’t do back-to-back ethnic cuisines (Mexican two nights in a row) or proteins (2 nights in a row of ground beef). That helps keep variety, and even though I plan on 2 nights of leftovers a week (Wednesday/Sunday), no one gets bored with the meals. 

Once I’m done with planning, I figure out how much of each protein I need total (4 nights of ground beef, 6 nights of chicken, etc), so I can make my bulk purchase. I also check my pantry for staples, and add what I need for all the meals. The great thing about this is, I only have to do weekly shopping for perishables (produce, dairy, etc), so my weekly trips are shorter and easier). 

After I do my shopping, I will either fully prep meals and freeze finished, or (if I’m pressed for time or just lazy) portion all the proteins and label the bags with what meal they go to (so I can just pull out the bag in the morning to defrost for a quick-cook that night).  Some meals are just better doing right before serving (pasta can get mushy, soups can get watery), so sometimes I’ll full-prep and protein prep. 

TL/DR:  Once-a-Month-Meals are great for giving plenty of variety, while saving time and money by utilizing bulk purchasing and marathon prep-days to stock your freezer with 20-30 completed meals.

EatCheapAndHealthy,fdqfmsi,t3_emimd7,1578665447.0,"Awhile back, I found bags of organic chicken breast in the freezer section of Grocery Outlet for about 1/2 the cost of what I usually pay for fresh at Costco. I bought 2 bags (4 pounds total), defrosted them in the fridge for a couple days, and then tossed them in a crockpot with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Cooked on high for about 5-6 hours, then shredded it all up. (No liquids needed; the slow-roasting makes all the fat render down, and the juices from the meat deep out. Together, that keeps the meat perfectly moist).  After the meat cooled, I packaged it in quart-sized ziplocks (slightly more than a pound each), froze flat, and had several meals ready to go at a moment’s notice. OP, you could totally do something similar, just freezing in smaller, single-person portions."

Absolutely no judgement intended, but it sounds to me you have already made up your mind to back out, and you’re just looking for support and validation in your decision.  I get it; sometimes our heart already knows what it needs/wants, but we need to get our brain on-board. It’s ok to back out if you aren’t sure you can stay for the long-haul. Chronic illness is a life-long journey, and it’s not for everyone to be supportive through that. I hope whatever you decide, you are able to be open and honest with your lady. She needs support, but you sticking around because you feel guilty isn’t healthy for either of you, and will just lead to relationship failure in the long-run."
Fibromyalgia,fdiuaxw,t3_eljhna,1578451199.0,"Your concerns about the future are valid, but think of the situation from this angle:  what would you do if you were married to a “healthy” person who became ill or was diagnosed with a chronic condition?  Would you be inclined to bail, or can you see yourself upholding the whole “in sickness and in health” part of your vows?  My husband and I married pretty young (19 and 23), and will be celebrating our 18th anniversary next month (been together 21 years this month). We were young, healthy, and had nowhere to go but “up” in life. Over the last 21 years, we have gone through A LOT of downs... richer, poorer, sickness, health, births, deaths... the whole nine yards. It was difficult... really difficult sometimes, but we made it through because we were a team, and we went through it together. I have had progressively more/worse symptoms since my mid-teens, having only been diagnosed with Fibro and Psoriatic Arthritis just before Christmas last year. My husband has stood by while I rode the Dragon, never knowing what was really wrong with me, only that something was not right.  He couldn’t fix me, make me feel better, or understand what I was going through. He was just there, and some days that’s all I needed.  I often wonder if he would have married me if we had had some sort of crystal ball to see the future, or if I had been diagnosed 20 years ago in the early stages of our relationship.  Luckily, he stuck by, and I will always do the same for him. That’s what a partnership is - carrying your other half when they can’t make the trek themselves (and they do the same for you)."

Fibromyalgia,fdilrbq,t3_elkwrq,1578445734.0,"What time of day do you feel “least awful?”  It’s important to focus your energy (carefully) to getting stuff done at that time, rather than trying to cram it in at the end of the day when you’re overwhelmed and exhausted. For me, that time is first thing in the morning, after my first-thing-in-the-morning stiffness and pain subsides a bit (usually between 6- and 7-am). I have breakfast, get freshened up, and hit the treadmill for a brisk (ish) 2 mile walk. Then I’ll have a quick protein shake, and if it’s M/W/F, do a 35-45 minute resistance circuit workout with moderate weights (I make sure I don’t lift too heavy and wear myself out). Even though I have to modify a lot of my workout, I find getting it done early in the day actually helps me have more energy overall throughout the day, and my pain is more manageable. I also have Psoriatic Arthritis, so I get stiff and sore if I sit around too long, so it helps me manage that better if I keep moving and active."

I’m sure your fears are compounded immensely by the constant feed of news and alarming events brought by social media/media in general. 

I wonder if taking a break from the situation might help?  I mean, I know you can’t hop on a plane and fly somewhere tropical, but maybe just turn off the feed?  I find that when something scary is happening, I tend to fixate on it (trying to find news reports, listening to the police scanner, etc), in hopes of seeing/hearing “good news” about my husband/his coworkers. But often, it just makes my stress worse, because I just find more and more that upsets me. I have to physically put my phone down, turn of the TV, etc, and find an activity to disconnect for awhile.  So much of Fibro’s issues seem to stem from over-stimulation of some variety.  Give your brain a break. 

I don’t know what kind of communication link you and your SO have, but maybe establish check-in times with each other?  A set time each day or night when he can contact you to tell you he is physically ok, and you can get a little mental relief?  Even if it’s not at a set time, even a random text or call might be helpful.  (And lest anyone come for me with a “he’s fighting a huge fire, he can’t just stop to call or text!”  Yeah... I know. But he doesn’t fight 24/7; eventually he has to eat/sleep/pee/etc.).
