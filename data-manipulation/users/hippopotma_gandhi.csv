I don't judge people for bundling up. They may be from arizona. They may have low iron. They may be just doing a short walk and hanging out outdoors for a while and won't have a bunch of body hear from exercise.

However, research has shown that the brain and body is not developed enough to drink alcohol and smoke without affecting later stages of development.  I know it seems unfair, but it's really just older generations recognizing and correcting problems. Be grateful that somebody is looking out for the health of younger generations, at least some care.
