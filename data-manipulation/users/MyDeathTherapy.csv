Welp, imma go beat some men that looked at Me in passing, good thing I'm a woman! It wont be nearly as bad for them, i can let out all my frustrations! If they dont flinch and show pain that must mean they dont feel it, it couldn't be they're conditioned not to show a reaction! /s  (imma add a serious part. My brother was/is physically abusive to me, and the only way he would go away is if I started sobbing or if I didn't react. He would hit me harder and harder until he got bored since I didnt show reaction. I known its not the same, but I was conditioned into not showing a reaction to pain since he would say 'I didnt even hit you that hard!' Or 'I didnt even touch you' and would get more angry, I wonder what that reminds you of.)"
relationship_advice,fcd09y9,t3_eh2nlb,1577604772.0,"If you really want to find a middle ground, you could try CBD. If you haven't heard of it, its extracted from the marijuana plant, and has very similar health benefits, apart from the fact it doesnt get you high. We sell it at our business, and have had people come in for it saying that its helped amazingly with back pain, anxiety, arthritis, sleep, etc. You guys could have a serious conversation about it and do some research together. If she has trouble with you being high, you could definitely try this. You can talk about ratios, as you can get a 3:1 ratio, with 300mg cbd to 100thc for example, which is a much lower Thc content and if you have built a tolerance, shouldn't really affect you that much. This seems like a good middle ground, and I really recommend you try it. Be careful with where to get it though, the same as buying weed. Make sure if you buy the oil to get the ingredients list. It took my work 4 years to find a supplier that could give us a ingredient list and what lab they used, etc.(we are in Canada so it might be different for you) If you want to check out a reliable company you can look at missenvy.ca, its where we get our stuff (we trust them and you can find the Ingredients all there and on the bottles) and they have the 3:1 ratio, etc. Good luck, I know that weed can really help you, and it's not even close to as bad as people can portray it."
