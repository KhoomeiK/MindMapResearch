The video is interesting, but I think the guy underestimates the possibilities of closets, dead ends, maintenance access ways, etc..  Also he neglects the notion that the realities of working on location sometimes conflict with aesthetic concerns of film-making, resulting in less-than-obsessive concern about the spatial fidelity of a fictional hotel to reality."
