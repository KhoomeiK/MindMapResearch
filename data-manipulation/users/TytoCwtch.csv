Eyebleach,ffq1wv2,t1_ffpw84u,1580115866.0,Theres been a lot of studies on natural plants and essential oils as enrichment for big cats in captivity. It’s lovely to see them behaving like big softies rolling in the grass. There’s a great video of a leopard that loves sacks scented with marmite lol.
Eyebleach,ffq1sl5,t1_ffpw4v7,1580115682.0,I’ve added an edit as I did simplify slightly. The yolk is the genetic material and where development starts. The white is nutrients that the chick embryo needs to develop. But only part of the yolk is used and the rest forms the yolk sack whereas all of the white is used for the chicks growth.
Eyebleach,ffpglx0,t1_ffpftb8,1580094547.0,"They do. And they will eat them whole in captivity as well. The difference is that in the wild they may only catch a mouse every other day and they need to eat all of it to maximise the nutrition they get. In captivity they get normally get fed every day and unless you’re careful with their food they’ll get fat and refuse to fly. 

Owls come back to humans because they’re hand reared and bond with humans. But hawks/falcons/kites/eagles have to be parent reared or they won’t know how to hunt. So they come back to you because they want food. You have to keep them at what’s called ‘flight weight’ which is a weight were they’re not fat (they’ll go sit in a tree and go to sleep) but they’re not skinny (they’ll go off hunting on their own). So every day you weigh your bird and you adjust their food to keep them at a healthy weight. If you’re not flying a bird, if they’re moulting, breeding, injured etc. then you’d put them up to ‘fat weight’ which is when you give them extra food as you don’t need them to be so responsive.

To prepare the food you sometimes have to remove the fatty bits. So with chicks you’d remove the yolk sack. Mice, rats, rabbits you’ll remove the guts and organs (lot of fat, not much nutrition). Chickens you might just give them a leg one day and then some breast meat the next. It’s all about balancing a healthy diet that meets their nutritional needs without too much fat."
Eyebleach,ffpfip5,t1_ffpdogv,1580093776.0,"Owls do nearly all of their learning in the first 8 weeks of their live. If they’re hand reared then they imprint on humans and they think they’re a tiny human, not an owl. Then they’re usually fine to pet and cuddle because they see you as their mum. They enjoy snuggles for the same reasons humans do, it releases oxytocin.

Some owls will naturally snuggle for warmth/preen each other when young and then will snuggle with their mate during breeding season as adults. Wild owls would not let humans near them like this. With hand reared owls once they hit sexual maturity (around 2-4 depending on species) some will go feral and get aggressive whereas some will start trying to mate your head when you go to clean them...

A lot of animals if hand reared/exposed to humans young are happy to be cuddled. But a lot of wild animals won’t as they’ve never learnt that humans are nice. I’ve had cuddles with hand reared lions, elephants, zebras, monkeys, lemurs, meerkats etc. It’s all about how they’re raised.  

Fun fact - lions love the smell of lavender. Met a lion at a rescue once, the keeper told me to rub lavender on my hands, and the lion behaved just like a giant house cat, rubbing his head against my hands and purring."
Eyebleach,ffpcxvn,t1_ffpc8n6,1580091929.0,"I did my degree in Animal Behaviour. I had three barn owls living in my dorm room with me. Raised them from the day they hatched till they were old enough to be independent. They stink, you have to handle dead things, you have to clean up poop and pellets etc. When they got old enough they started trying to feed me dead mouse whilst I slept (not a fun night). BUT they are adorable cuddle monsters. Watching them grow up is amazing. They each have unique personalities, they love to snuggle and play games etc. They play games when they’re learning to fly and when they crash they give you a glare that clearly means ‘you didn’t see that...’ It is hard, and at times gross, but it is worth it.

Go to my profile for a video of one of the owls I trained asking for more cuddles if you want lol."
Eyebleach,ffpbyhs,t1_ffpbhgx,1580091234.0,They get rid of the bones and fur of what they eat through pellets. But all the meat and nutrients still pass through their digestive system and they urinate and defecate as well.
Eyebleach,ffpbp50,t1_ffpbfgq,1580091053.0,"Deyolking isn’t too bad if you know what you’re doing. But if you accidentally put pressure on the chicks stomach the yolk sack pops like a balloon and can spray you in the mouth which is not fun!

Rabbits and rats are worse to prepare though because they reek!"
Eyebleach,ffpbdbg,t1_ffpa4a4,1580090825.0,"Primary food for birds of prey in captivity is day old chicks. When you open an egg it has a white and a yolk. The white is what actually grows into the chick. The yolk forms a sack inside the chicks stomach that the chick lives off for a few days until it’s old enough to feed normally. The yolk is almost pure fat so if you’re trying to keep your birds weight down you have to tear open the day old chicks stomach and remove the yolk sack.

Edit - just to clarify as I’ve a few people message me asking. The yolk in an egg is the part that is either fertilised or unfertilised depending on if the chicken had sex and contains the genetic material where the development starts. As the yolk starts to grow into the baby chick the white is used up as it contains the energy/nutrients for the chick to grow fully. But not all the yolk is used which is what forms the yolk sack inside the chicks body. So both parts of the egg grow into the chick but all of the white is used and only part of the yolk. Sorry I simplified, hope that clarifies things."
Eyebleach,ffpb6z1,t1_ffovkj9,1580090701.0,"In the wild they will walk to the edge of their nest, point their bum out into the open and shoot the poo directly backwards so as to keep their nest clean.  They repeat this behaviour in captivity. I’ve seen barn owl poop clear 2 metres before. And it reeks!"
Eyebleach,ffpb34b,t1_ffouy55,1580090627.0,"Not to mention if you go away on holiday for even a week they forget you completely and act like a stroppy teenager when you try to get them back into training!

I don’t mind the deyolking though, it’s kind of satisfying if it comes out intact. But not if you squeeze it wrong and shoot it in your own mouth..."

AmItheAsshole,ffhyqdz,t1_ffhvkzw,1579959552.0,"This was definitely true when I did my A levels. I was in hospital (kidney stones are not fun!) and missed most of my AS exams. The examining bodies used a combination of my mock grades and coursework grades, and then asked my teachers to nominate two students ‘at a similar level’ and used that info to give me an average which was my official AS grade.

But the traffic island in the middle of the road he drives around at the start has the signs you can see with white arrows on a blue background.

If there was no traffic island there and the line down the centre of the road was white dashed he could have legally turned if there was no oncoming traffic and it was safe to do so. A solid white line would also have meant no overtaking and the manoeuvre would have been illegal.

Unexpected,fehek4f,t1_fehbill,1579114919.0,"Engineering design. The forks original purpose was just to hold meat still whilst cutting which is why they only had two sharpened points. Over time forks developed to be used to actually pick up food and eat it. Three pronged forks were found to be too narrow to carry a decent mouthful of food or the prongs were too far apart and food fell through the gaps. Five pronged forks are too wide for most mouths without having the tines so close together that the holding functionality would be affected.

Some dessert forks (sometimes called pastry forks) have three tines but one tine is wider with a slightly slanted edge that is designed to actually cut soft foods eg a pastry or cake as well as picking it up."

You’re taught to fall like this in bouldering as it distributes the force of the fall evenly across a larger area and you can walk away fine. If you try to land on your feet all that force is in two small places and you can seriously wreck your spine. A fall like this onto a bouldering mat barely even winds you.

If you try and land ‘normally’ with feet first you’re much more likely to injure yourself as you land with all your force in one place which the mats aren’t designed for. So you’re taught to fall backwards and roll into the fall to distribute your weight and reduce the impact.

They told her her only other option was to have an unemployed partner as they’ll consider couples as long as one of them doesn’t work.

One year our teacher started reading the Hobbit but the other students would keep asking what words meant or forgetting the previous plot points. I got so frustrated that I went to the local library, got a copy, and read it in a day.  Backfired slightly as for the next few months I still had to listen to a little bit every day when I knew exactly what the plot was."
MaliciousCompliance,fcx5exv,t1_fcx0icp,1578051976.0,Our library had a ‘young adults’ section that was for 14-19 year olds and had all of the graphic novels in amongst other books. I can’t remember the exact rules but as a child you were allowed to take out something like 6 kids books and 2 adult books but you weren’t allowed the young adult books unless you were over 14. I never understood why it was completely acceptable for me to get adult books with violence and sex etc in but graphic novels would warp my little child mind...

Carer burn out is real and everyone needs some me time occasionally.

Curious to know though, are you the husband from this one?

EntitledBitch,fcfeyyf,t1_fcews7i,1577629275.0,"I completely agree with your point but I think from the back story in this case they added a service charge for it being a large party rather than a mandatory tip. I have seen this at a lot of restaurants in the UK where they automatically add a service charge if you have more then 6-8 people (varies by restaurant).  I still think it’s bull though as serving one table of 8 is no different then two tables of 4! I tip for good service, not because it’s ‘expected’!"
EntitledBitch,fcfeeyt,t1_fceyvhk,1577629117.0,Which country? Some have very strict beliefs that tipping is an insult.
EntitledBitch,fcfc7cv,t1_fceweyp,1577628541.0,"I based my answer on what I read on the Department of Labours website which says that at a federal level;

‘An employer may pay a tipped employee not less than $2.13 an hour in direct wages if that amount plus the tips received equal at least the federal minimum wage, the employee retains all tips and the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal the federal minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference.’

It does say that some states have their own laws on minimum wage but I’m not sure whether federal or state law would be a ‘higher’ law and which would apply. Can states write their own laws to give people less protection then at a federal level?

Either way I think it’s ridiculous that someone can get that low a wage, but then again the whole American tipping culture makes no sense to me as a Brit!"
EntitledBitch,fceok2h,t1_fcelufg,1577622403.0,Also UK but from what I understand of the American culture as long as the tips bring them above an average hourly minimum wage it’s legal. If they don’t get any tips then the boss has to pay them a higher hourly wage to ensure they get an average minimum hourly wage. But otherwise $2 an hour is legal if they also get enough in tips.
