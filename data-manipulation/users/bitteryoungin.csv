depression,ff7n1xn,t3_ermt16,1579653469.0,"I use to talk about my problems like it was normal. Ignorantly and foolish I was because all that was used against me, the people who I talk to were friends or at least I thought they were because instead of helping me out they added insult to injury, yeah they made it worse. So I really avoid talking to anyone about my problems. Shit most of my head is fucked up and 70% is because of people and thats why im a loner."
depression,fe6ri2v,t1_fe6qy8m,1578901960.0,Nothing makes you feel more alive then pain. I love crying me eyes out alone at home it makes me feel my heart intensely. Watch a sad movie or listen to a sad song and cry knowing that pain its part life but dont make pain damage your mind or your life no make pain make you feel alive. Its fun
depression,fe6qfxw,t1_fe6q5wr,1578900579.0,"Yeah sometimes it can be better but sometimes being alive is fun. We are humans we always wants something else, something different. We are never forever satisfied with nothing. Haha its funny see, the world is shit because we are shit."

depression,fe6piu1,t1_fdp2zqj,1578899423.0,"Haha yeah I know im a piece of shit and dont deserve nothing good my way. You have to be making money, handsome and a nice personality to maybe have a perfect girl and shit its normal what girl wants to be with a loser I know that if I was a girl I wouldnt. Im too lazy, shy and afraid to ever make a girl fall in love with me. Im right now in college without a job. My mom pays for everything and I barely do shit in the house. I know that Ill soon start making money and when I do good things are bound to happen. Why? Because money is everything. A piece of paper is what controls the world and I wont have nothing unless I get it. So I hope youre making a lot of it and thanks for reading and replying. Thanks to you Ive haved some fun writing this and reading yours."

depression,fdp3wxa,t1_fdp2qbm,1578619407.0,"Yeah thanks a lot I really appreciate you. But listen I do my best to get notice, Ive spend most of my money on clothes, I spendid like $500 on clothes and sneakers, I always go the barbershop like 1 time a week yet I dont even get a compliment. Now I feel like all that money that I wasted was for nothing. A lot of guys have there girlfriend but I dont have that. Im the problem maybe because I dont have a very sunshine friendly personality because im a bitter person but I have tried, I have fought threw my shy and anxious ass to be in a relationship but still nothing. Yeah I need therapy. I need Rx pills for my deppressed mind."

depression,fcjj4ns,t3_ehip80,1577689603.0,Holy shit took me hours to write this. If anyone reads the whole thing witch is highly unlikely then god bless you may you have the best fortune of all cause I would really appreciate if someone actually read it and I didnt waste my time. This is a true story I wouldn't write all that if it was fake made up shit. It may be shit but it isnt fake made up.
depression,fcjd88b,t3_ehbh7p,1577683610.0,Even the richest people in the world get depressed whoever says depresion only attacks the poor and unfortunate is naive
depression,fcjcpzu,t3_ehdxmn,1577683178.0,"At night you have no distractions like at day and you're alone so you start thinking about this shitty world, you start thinking about how pathetic you were, how pathetic you are and all your problems. Happens to me too and thats why its hard for me to wake up early because I be on my phone trying to distract myself from all those thoughts until I get sleepy like at 12:00am and I need to wake up at 5:30am for college barely sleeping at all. Fucked up shit."
