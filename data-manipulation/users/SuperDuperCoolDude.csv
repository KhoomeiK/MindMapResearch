runefactory,ffbagfa,t3_eshs82,1579757396.0,2 and 3 from your qol list were present in Frontier on the Wii so I imagine you will see those improvements again on this console version.
Grimdawn,ff4gb8v,t1_ff4128v,1579562918.0,Only pet bonuses and auras.
Grimdawn,ff1t14n,t3_er3c67,1579485529.0,"A vitality caster on Conjurer or Ritualist can be very strong and the Dark One's set is dropped by specific enemies at a pretty decent rate. It's a lot of fun and has crazy sustain. It's great before that set too with lots of good devotions and faction gear available. I am leveling this build right now: https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/1-1-4-2-dark-ones-ritualist-megatank-naked-farmer-c-ongoing-levelling-journal-included/89554

It is quite effective and I imagine the Conjurer would be very good too with the same concept. You could also adapt the build to other vit and bleed items or even do a melee build with the totems for sustain."

todayilearned,fefciqz,t1_fef7s7c,1579053345.0,"I don't believe any of Bourkeev's clients perished. He went back up the mountain and saved people while Krakauer stayed in his tent. I liked Krakauer's book well enough but I felt his criticism of Bourkeev was way off base. He thought Bourkeev should have used supplemental oxygen but Bourkeev said he was better without it and that supplemental oxygen can be a liability if you run out and haven't conditioned to go without it. Hall, Harris, and Fischer died after exhausting their supplies while Bourkeev returned to camp and then partially ascended again, which I feel shows he was likely correct.

If I were to blame anyone it would be the two expidition leaders for not enforcing turn around times. Even then though, climbing Everest is just really dangerous and stuff happens."
Grimdawn,feezjjd,t3_eomfvz,1579044681.0,"I bought Grim Dawn before the expansions and loved the base game but honestly the expansions make it a lot better. The itemization is the game changer for me moreso than the added story content.

If you played D2 think of it this way: would a new person NEED Lord of Destruction? Technically no, D2 was fun on its own, I enjoyed occasional classic play years after the expansion came out,  but I would always recommend someone getting D2 buy the expansion as well as it adds so much.  

I think the Grim Dawn expansions add a lot more content, comparatively."
Grimdawn,feeywb1,t1_feepycu,1579044264.0,"Yeah, I will always be curious about how many hours I have in D2. It has to be an enormous amount. I doubt any other game is very close. Morrowind, Stardew Valley, and Grim Dawn would probably be the closest."
lotrmemes,fdsjfyu,t1_fdrfl9r,1578703905.0,"The battle itself is cooler in Helm's Deep, and Theoden has some awesome lines, but I really love the charge of the Rohirrim and the fight against the Witch King. The ghost army bit was kind of dumb though, and I hate that they had TWK break Gandalf's staff in the extended edition.... it's a toss up for me."
lotrmemes,fdsixic,t1_fds5dif,1578703631.0,"The Witch King doesn't break Gandalf's staff in the book, that's from the extended edition of the movie."
Grimdawn,fdmkx7x,t3_elyp6v,1578553780.0,"I have a Conjurer with 7 or 8 on hit effects and also cast vines, totems, and devouring swarm myself. Plus I used the Blood Knight amulet for a while which adds a few mages casting their own stuff. It makes for a lot on screen!"
television,fdl4ge6,t3_eluzcr,1578516885.0,Rutter has never lost to a human opponent in a regular episode or over the course of a multi-day tournament. It will be interesting to see if he can manage to hold that distinction against the tough competition here.
sports,fdkudto,t1_fdjrhrr,1578511350.0,"That's like the ""average"" height pro wrestlers. Hulk Hogan is not huge compared to The Big Show, Andre, Kane, The Undertaker, etc, but then watch him in Rocky III where he's with Sylvester Stallone, who at 5'10"" is about 8 inches shorter, and Hogan looks like a giant."

Morrowind,fc6carl,t1_fc55kd0,1577477227.0,I use the body too. I like having tables with daedric weaponry and such laid out on them though.
