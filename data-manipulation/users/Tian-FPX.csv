We can make zulrah accounts in a few days, have 30 ready to go in a month, they will probably only last a month at most, being botted two hours a day.

6 hours a day is a ton. Seriously. Go on any botting forum, or get into a private botting discord if you can, and tell people you bot 6 hours a day and everyone will ask what your secret is.

Trust me when I say this, they ban tons, and tons, and tons, of accounts.
