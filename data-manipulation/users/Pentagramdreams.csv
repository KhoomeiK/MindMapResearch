offmychest,fg5gl7s,t3_ewyodc,1580526906.0,I’m so happy to hear that. I thought this was going in a different direction and I was ready to be mad at them for you. They sound like good people. This makes me very happy. And you should feel great about that. You’re allowed to feel that pride! You go girl!

piercing,fg3x53p,t3_ewrgbt,1580491552.0,"Wait, I need to hear about these myths.

2) your smile is gorgeous"
JUSTNOFAMILY,ffu1q97,t3_ev5gj3,1580232607.0,"Reading this as a SSW I’m screaming “no no no no no” at your therapist. If cutting toxic people from your life and setting real boundaries is helping you move forward with your life you are doing the right thing. 

I think you’re doing great. She should not be pushing her values or beliefs into you. That’s not her job. Her job is to help you make the best decision for you."

JUSTNOFAMILY,ffqmz1g,t3_eujyx5,1580138867.0,"I’m sorry someone that’s supposed to care about your family said such a horrid thing. It is no ones place to judge others. And you’re right, you didn’t ask for his opinion on how many people are coming. It was not his place to say such a thing. And I’m sorry there are people here that seem to think it’s ok he’s shitting on your life plans. 

I want to wish you and your partner all the best. And best of luck with your Bachelors."

ddlg,ffqk187,t3_eun79g,1580136719.0,These kinds of times are hard. But you are a beautiful person and those thoughts telling you otherwise are lying to you. I know it’s hard but you can get through it. This middle is here for you.
