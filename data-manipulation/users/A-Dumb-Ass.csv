harrypotter,ffk06r1,t1_ffjilpc,1580011813.0,"I read the books as they came out and was actually really excited for the first movie but it was a huge letdown, so never watched all the movies. I re-read the books so many times though that I lost count. I used to read all previous books right before reading the new one, so I read ""Philosopher's Stone"" at least 7 times, ""Chamber of Secrets"" at least 6 times etc. Yeah, books were scarce at home lol."
soccer,ffc4u4r,t3_estbga,1579791553.0,Douglas Costa in the first half of the 2015-16 season was probably the most exciting player I’ve seen in a Bayern shirt in the last decade. Honestly thought he was gonna be the next Ribery.

todayilearned,ff8744j,t1_ff7vodb,1579667880.0,"> I think you could also argue that no evidence is truly infallible.

I’m against capital punishment but just for argument’s sake, what if you’re a mass shooter who’s caught red-handed?

Edit: I’m not saying we should execute mass shooter. I still think life imprisonment and actual education is better than executing the culprit and wash our hands of the crime. My argument here is simply, there could be cases where there is an infallible evidence. 

This reminded me of a Japanese spree killer (Akihabara jiken) who drove into a crowd and stabbed people on the street in view of thousands of people, with cameras everywhere (including cell phone cameras) and was apprehended on the spot. It was especially close to me because I lived a few blocks from where it happened and planned to go there if not for a all-night karaoke session the previous night."
