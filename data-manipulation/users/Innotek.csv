But that is the comment that /u/FredJQJohnson was replying to.  It isn't _completely free_.  I also didn't get the sense that he was making the argument that things cost too much and ooof muh taxes.

What I read was someone who was pointing out that Medicare is not _completely free_ to retired folks.  You pay Medicare taxes until the day you die on all earned income.

Just to be clear, I am not a boomer, but I do have boomer parents.  It is worth pointing out that Medicare actually sucks really bad for a lot of older people, especially those who can't afford to get a financial or medical advisor to help them understand when getting an extra policy helps them, and what of the alphabet of Medicare parts they need and what it will cost them.

I was in the pharmacy the other day and watched an elderly lady who didn't have Part D try to get the shingles vaccine.  It was going to be $70 out of pocket for her, which she clearly didn't have.  Super fucked up and evidence of a diseased system that we think it is more cost effective to let her walk because she'd rather eat than get a vaccine, contract shingles, and deal with that agony while the public at large pays for her hospitalization.

As far as, ""Nobody believes social safety nets appear out of thin air.""  I dunno, people are pretty fucking stupid, and never cease to amaze me when it comes down to what they'll believe.

It does seem to me that what is happening to the NHS is exactly what happens when people start taking public goods for granted.  They just elected a bunch of officials from a party that loves to slash the NHS budget, then they go all surprised Pokemon when surgeries get delayed.

Public goods need to be protected, they need to be protected first at the ballot box by electing politicians that will fund them.

On the other hand, there's what Bernie is going through trying to articulate that taxes going up for Medicare will actually save most people money.  IMHO, this is because people do not actually equate their tax dollars going towards a service that they benefit from.  We have been hammered over and over with ""taxes bad"" to the point that I think most people think taxes are literally just punishment for living and the government just sets that money on fire.

It is really frustrating when people talk about things costing too much (52 trillion over 10 years??? Go find me some pearls to clutch), and I think we need to stop thinking about government ""spending"" in terms of GDP and more in terms of resource consumption, but we're a generation or two away from having a resource based economy.  In the interim, we need to have a conversation that can be framed in something people understand, and right now, the best frame of reference we have is money."
me_irl,fcyy5b0,t1_fcyutf9,1578089663.0,"But they aren‚Äôt. A lot of people forget that these things are public goods owned by We The People, and they require ongoing investment.

When people start taking public goods for granted is exactly when the beast starts getting starved around them. Then folks start looking around and thinking, ‚Äúboy libraries are shit these days, maybe the gubment can‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù

I am legitimately curious, why do you think it sounds silly? Is it because it is obvious and isn‚Äôt worth saying?"
me_irl,fcyqfz1,t1_fcykz8e,1578084972.0,"I know the downvote brigade got on you here, but you are 100% correct.

I believe that I should pay my fair share, I also believe that my share should be calculated on a sliding scale, meaning that my costs will grow faster than my income.

To say that Medicare is free though is absurd. Free as in freedom, sure. Free as in pizza, no. Someone pays."

conspiracy,fcqxm8r,t1_fcqqmvg,1577893752.0,"Nice narrative and all, but it seems that this is how India chose to implement aid money sent by the UK and folks are not pleased about it. Last two paragraphs of the article you linked.

I‚Äôd also remind that this all took place in 2010 when Greta was 7.

>	When it announced changes to aid for India last year, the DfID promised to improve the lives of more than 10 million poor women and girls. It said: ""We condemn forced sterilisation and have taken steps to ensure that not a penny of UK aid could support it. The UK does not fund sterilisation centres anywhere.
>
>	""The coalition government has completely changed the way that aid is spent in India to focus on three of the poorest states, and our support for this programme is about to end as part of that change. Giving women access to family planning, no matter where they live or how poor they are, is a fundamental tenet of the coalition's international development policy."""
