wholesomememes,fft6347,t3_ev3cn3,1580209040.0,I recently played through Eternal Ring on the Playstation 2 and while it's really not like Dark Souls you can also easily see that Dark Souls is where From Software was heading.

I didn't even know what kind of music I even liked until I heard *You* on the Tony Hawk 2 soundtrack. Until then I was just listening to the dad rock that I'd been bedded in my whole life, stuff like Queen and The Eagles--which aren't bad, but holy hell my whole world changed when I got into Bad Religion. It's fair to say that *No Control* is the album that changed my entire perspective on the world. The song *Sanity* spoke so perfectly to how I feel everyday and every other song was about things that were love or relationships or anything typical to not only the dad rock I came from but also the pop music around me. Also I fuckin loved how they sounded, which is more important. It also opened the door to the punk rock scene, which is a genre of music that resonates with me on a spiritual level.
