The first question here is do you feel safe allowing Peter to hold your baby?

No.

Okay.   The second question is do you feel safe allowing Peter to *meet* your baby?

You don’t have to.   This can be a “no” as well.   But there are options besides allowing him to be free-rein. 

What if he sat on Becca’s lap and she held him, and you sat near them and held your daughter, and allowed Peter to look at and maybe hand a bottle or toy to your daughter?   Would you be comfortable with that?   Remember, guilt is in the box, this is about what you feel *comfortable* with.  

What about meeting at the park where Peter would be distracted with a lot of other stuff and you could have the baby strapped to you.   He could *see* your baby, and be immediately guided away.

What about if you went to visit at Becca’s house *alone* and brought pictures of your baby, and asked Peter to give you tips on how to hold and feed and change her by demonstrating with his doll?

You don’t have to be comfortable with any of this.   It can be a flat “no”.   It can be that you don’t want any contact between Peter and your child.   *That is okay*.   It’s not wrong.

That is why Down’s syndrome babies are protected and cared for, instead of being left unwrapped to freeze to death.   That is why we intervene in complicated labours.   

When the root cause of problems *can* be addressed through preventative medicine, of course it is.   Malnutrition causes small pelvises, which causes obstructed labour.   If you feed young girls well, they are more likely to be able to deliver naturally.   

But other problems are just in the genes.  There is currently no way to address this on a global level without the application of eugenics.   The women who have incompetent cervixes, for example, *are just like that*.   You can either treat them and save the life of their unborn baby, who would otherwise be born far too early, or you can let nature take its course and allow the child to die.

One path will ultimately lead to more people with incompetent cervixes some time in the future - and the technology exists to save those people, too.   The other path will lead to a dead infant who you could have saved and a devastated mother who may never recover.

I know that finances are a significant issue.   I realise that you’re already strained to your limits.   But seriously look at the numbers.   You may find that the price of childcare for three kids vs the price of a live-in nanny is pretty even.   

I’ve been a nanny for single mothers who regret having kids.  It is hands-down the best choice you can make.   It takes the pressure off.

Kids need *an adult* who has the energy and the desire to be there for their kid stuff.   It doesn’t matter who it is, really.    Anyone can change diapers and fix lunch and colour, it doesn’t *have* to be mum.

They also need their parent to come home at the end of the day and tell them they love them and read them a story and be happy to see them.   Usually, if *someone else* can handle most of the daily kid stuff, regretful parents can handle that bit.    

There is no question that you love your kids.   No one sane would question that.    You’re just strained beyond your limits.

You’re NTA.   This is a very normal, very reasonable reaction to a very, *very* difficult situation.   But you don’t have to do this alone.   It is okay to reach for help."
wholesomememes,ffai5fq,t3_esgj26,1579736292.0,"When I was fifteen years old, my family went to the other side of the world, to England.   We drove to the middle of the countryside, and there stood a cottage seemingly in the middle of nowhere.  We arrived late at night.

A very old woman met us at the door and burst into tears as she pulled my father inside.   She hugged us very tightly, which was strange because I had never seen her before.

In her living room, there was a picture of my grandmother on her mantle.   That was a most peculiar moment - my grandmother was literally as far away from this place as it was possible to be without leaving the planet, and yet here was her photograph.

This woman was my grandmother’s aunt, who had raised her from infancy.   She treated us like we had known her all our lives, insisting we called her Auntie Peggy and stuffing us full of treats.

After a little while, my younger brother vanished.   I found him in the kitchen with Auntie Peggy, who was filling his pockets with chocolate.  

“That’s all I can fit, Auntie Peggy,” my brother was telling her.

“Don’t be silly!” Auntie Peggy answered.  “You must have more pockets!”

“Fudgey!   Grab your purse!” my brother told me.

Auntie Peggy loaded us down with enough sweets that we legitimately dropped a trail of them like Hansel and Gretel when we left.   

She was a really cool lady - and not just because of the sweets.   It was amazing to be able to meet her."
AmItheAsshole,ffaaw2r,t1_ff9ha3q,1579731304.0,"My family had a slightly different set up, in that we were all expected to do chores but they were not intrinsically linked to reward.   My parents believed that being part of the family came with both responsibility and benefits, like doing the dishes and pocket money.   You just *had* both, simply by virtue of being one of the family unit.

But extra things, like sport, *was* linked to my behaviour.   If I misbehaved, I would lose that privilege and have to earn it back.

Grades were another thing that were different for each child.   My siblings and I were all different academically, and our actual letter grade was of little interest to my parents.    What they cared about was *effort*.   We were celebrated and rewarded for effort, regardless of whether that effort earned us an A or a D.   We were punished for being academically lazy, even if the grade we brought home at the end was respectable."

They’re outdoor plants, but I have a couple in pots on my balcony that at thriving.  If you start with a really good, strong line, then stress them and get them to survive it, then get them healthy again, they become indestructible."

Eventually they had to admit that yeah, depression doesn’t do that - it has to be something else."
