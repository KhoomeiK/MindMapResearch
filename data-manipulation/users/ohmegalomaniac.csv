Got a call yesterday from the referral. Thought I was going to get an appointment and felt relieved.

Nope, they just wanted to make sure I still wanted to be in line on the wait list and it was going to be at least 6 weeks before I could see anyone. Fantastic.

On the other hand I got a ps2 for 8 dollars off trademe and I'm feeling nostalgic after pirating a shit tonne of games"

Starting to dislike NZ. It's so disheartening to struggle with shit all the time. Every time I look at the news it just seems like everyone is poor and struggling. No one can afford the basic necessities and nothing changes. It's tiring.

In all actuality ~YES~ I believe Garfield has the N word pass. If you break it down he is almost exactly half black making him bi-racial, and living in a nice suburban neighborhood allows him to use it with his white friends but not his black friends. If he were to run into another bi-racial cat or humanoid he could use it freely, but make them uncomfortable. So in short: Yes but not in the hood, despite being a baller."
