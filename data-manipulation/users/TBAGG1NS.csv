Normally the program is 2 years (4 semesters), but my two programs shared the whole 3rd semester, and a couple final semester courses so it was an easy choice to stay for both.

Originally I wanted to be an electrician straight up or an elec eng, but I am happy where I landed and with what I have. I deal with both of them, getting to do some design work, and getting to some field installation/commissioning work. Best of both worlds imo.

Edit: should also mention, my job title is *technically* engineer, but we do not offer accredited engineering services in the traditional sense. We do controls, which is kind of a bridge between mechanical and electrical and almost its own discipline at this point. But my controls system package is approved by a Mechanical engineer."

No idea, just speculating...but even then, my companies philosophy is to do the job right, even if you go over, to a degree.
