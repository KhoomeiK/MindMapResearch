But ones off the top of my head (all Australian btw):

One of the most prolific writers would be Lydia Laube whose books I have enjoyed - the books started with her adventures being a nurse in the Middle East - but all now relate her her going on adventures to random countries! :)

Sarah Turnbull - writing about her life in Paris (Almost French) and Tahiti (All Good Things).

Sarah McDonald wrote ""Holy Cow! An Indian Adventure"" about her two years living in India with her ABC Journalist husband (this book also you would pair with the husband Jonathan Harley's book ""Lost in Transmission"" which is about his time there). Sarah's book is hilarious.

Another one-off is Tiana Templeman's ""Absolutely Faking It"" where she and her husband win a luxury holiday around the world at all these super expensive leading hotels - and have a backpackers budget to go with it :D I know she has written a couple of more books but I haven't read them.

Another one that I really enjoyed even if the subject matter got a bit dark was Lana Penrose's ""To Hellas And Back"" about her four years in Greece (and her subsequent marriage breakdown).

Heather Ellis' ""Ubuntu"" about motorcyling through Africa and ""Timeless on the Silk Road"" about motorbiking through central Asia where both a fun read. In fact I have another book about another women motorcyling through Africa whom I'm completely blanking on at the moment!

Another great one was ""Tell Them To Get Lost"" which he tried to go all over SE Asia based on the original 1975 Lonely Planet Guide.

I think all are really good. Though the first one is based on his experiences being a tour guide in 90s with youth style Contiki- camping and boozing style EuroTours - so you'll notice a few dated references (lack of Euros, ways they had to deal with getting money from home, plus the type of tours talked about don't really exist today). So take that as the novelty value of bygone years :D LOL

Max just did baaaad... 

But the LSFYL should've been Max vs Fame. Not JDF. JDF while a little one-note as Raven-Symone, at least HAD one note, neither Max or Fame had any notes to speak of in their characters.

They basically had the same storyline at the beginning (strong in challenges, winning a few, and Michelle complaining about hair or the same aesthetics in multiple challenges). Of course the big difference was Jinx never had a mediocre challenge (until the very end). I got to wonder, if she had a mediocre challenge in the middle of the seasons would the producers use that opportunity to kick her out? The season initally was all about RoLaskaTox and Alyssa vs Coco. 

The producers did realise in the end the quirky outsider coming up through the middle of these stronger personalities was a great storyline as well, but I think it was only after they got what they wanted with Alyssa/Coco (the LSFYL between the two). I think they would've sent Jinx home packing if she was caught in the bottom two with one of them (or any of RoLaskaTox) too early in the season.

Saying that Season 7 didn't really have a RoLaskaTox or Alyssa vs Coco to counterpoint against. The bitter old lady brigade vs the youngin's was something else...  something else entirely..."

The song is a literal 'out on the ledge' song, and I appricated her performance so much for because she managed to channel so much emotional energy through it (it wasn't a twirl and twerk song - it was something you have to act the hell out of while singing), not to mention (metaphorically) going 'out on the ledge' to perform such a non-traditional piece."

It sounds like you have only seen the earlier seasons (especially when you mention Houlihan being unlikeable), I find it changes for the better after Frank Burns leave the series at the end of Series 5, the cast (other then Radar leaving in Series 8) at that point are pretty solid and interact well with each other until the end of the series. 

Houlihan for example, while not losing her stubborn streak (which makes for the comedy) does soften a lot and several episodes deal with her charater growth (especially from the nurses prospective - there is a couple of episodes centred around her and the nurses with her acknowledging her authoritarian streak and trying to make herself a better leader) she stops being the angry and vindictive person she was in the first few seasons (basically after she stops sleeping with Frank and marries Donald)."

Actually it was the bar across the street/laneway to the bar with the drag queen, but as both bars where open to the street and the street was really small, both bars go to enjoy the Queen.

Also she lead both bars into a rendition of ""Its a Long Way to Tipperary"" which was a rather surreal, but extremely fun to be a part of, experience!"

AskReddit,fecc768,t3_eo6l00,1578970545.0,"The two weirdest things my school did was ban bike pants for girls and boxer shorts for boys. Due to kids going full on rebel... and wearing them... lol

First of all, to note, I grew up in Queenland (northern Australia) and we had a school uniform (though realitiscally we only had a summer uniform as it was the tropics - we wore shorts all year round and had a simple jacket we trotted out when temp dropped below 20C! LOL). 

Now the bike pants was interesting as the Parent & Citizens council had originally okayed them for the girls to wear during sports instead of the original netball skirts. Anybody that grew up in Australia knows how notoriously short netball skirts can be and how difficult it can be to keep them down). This was one thing the girls of the school where actually quiet happy with, but the principle vetoed this and implimented a skort (in conjunction with the exisiting netball skirts) and everybody hated this.

Bare in mind att this point bike pants where not banned, just not incorporated into the girl's sports uniform.

The girls at the school collectively rebelled by wearing bike pants under their regular dress skirt and the sport netball skirt and/or skort. At this point the powers that be decided to ban them, but the girls collectively started playing hardball and saying how can you even see my underwear (you arguably could see them with the netball skirts but certainly not with the dress skirt or skort unless one really looked or just accidently saw the skirt lift at an inopportune moment (like wind et cetera).

I have to admit the girls played hardball so well with this, especially as it was the result of a wanted rule change that everybody (parents et cetera) was cool with except the princpal.

The boys and boxer shorts... it was weird, but there was a fad at one point for guys to wear boxer shorts. Now we're not talking about the smaller boxer-brief type, but instead thes larger silk ones in various garish colours or Looney Toon characters and they'd often be longer then the school uniform shorts, thus they'd be poking out underneath the bottom of the shorts.

The school had plenty of other rules (no jelwery other then a watch, single pair of plain sleepers/stud) - they had to expand that to include medic alert stuff though as I guess whoever made them up forgot about that stuff. But oddly I don't recall major jewellery rebelling.

Shoes had to be plain black (impervious leather uppers however) but some girls always tried to get away with that by wearing dark purple shoelaces."
AskReddit,fecauot,t1_febrogy,1578969795.0,"As much as I adore the movie 'Drop Dead Gorgeous' the actors ages really do hurt the movie in parts.

Denise Richards was 28 and clearly looked 28 (playing a 17 year old) and her parents, played by Kirstie Alley and Sam McMurray (both in their late 40s - and frankly looked like they where in their late 40s), where only suppose to be 35/36 - which kinda ruined a minor subplot of how Kirstie Alley's character dropped out of her own beauty pagent 18 years prior (after winning the local comp) due to getting knocked up with Denise Richard's character (and thus why she was so pyscho-stage-mum about her daughter winning it in the present)"
doctorwho,feant03,t3_ensr3s,1578950674.0,"This episode was way to rushed. And way to crammed with different plot points to really work. The individual parts where actually all good. 

If it was an old school 6 x 30 min serial, I think it would've worked quiet well. But cramming everything into 1 hour... things just didn't work.




I'm coming to the conclusion there is way to many people to pay attention to at the moment. The storyline breaks under the weight of the doctor, 3 companions, multiple guest stars and various other one-offers.




Personally I think Graham and Ryan should retire back to earth and the Doctor and Yaz should travel on their own. Hell, Yaz has so much interesting potential yet she is the least explored of the 3 companions.




Thinking back, most of the time in the past we had three companions, we built up to it (Adric, Tegan and Nyssa all came seperately and had their own introduction so when the group became the Awesome Foursome, it felt a lot more organic and you knew everybody decently)*. But this way isn't possible in this new 10 x 60 min format. 




As to the thermatics of the episode itself. The episode could've fit so easily in already established canon (without needing to go wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey),  but that final ham-fisted speech really made everything feel... off...




As said a couple of weeks ago, I am missing the fun in the show, all this doom-and-gloom and seriousness is really killing the show for me.




*I will fully acknowledged that in the orignal awesome foursome Susan was often overlooked for Ian & Barbara, but the show itself was still finding its feet back then, so you can be a little more lienient. But a show 56 years old at this point really should have figured things out by now."

If there is one downside its the various cameos from of our favorite Queens are making. Some are just baaaad (sorry Vanjie- you had one line and it was terrible). When you have only one or two lines to make an impression and you sound awful...

Manila on the other hand with her half a line was a delight! Xoxo

On the positive side,  Izzy G is going to be big.  That kid has star power. She's the next Curly Sue (yes I'm totally showing my age there!)
