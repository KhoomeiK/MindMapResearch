Well in high school another mixed friend of mine wrote Asian some years and White for others. ""To throw off their stats"" lol"
mixedrace,ffxcp3x,t1_ffx3ibt,1580322449.0,"Ya sure! 

[If you'll read how the census didn't give mixed people their own category until the CLINTON administration](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-oct-30-mn-48323-story.html)

So how were mixed people accounted for until year 2000? 
If you're two or more races what do you pick when you can only choose a single category for race?"
mixedrace,ffx131j,t1_ffx0ybq,1580315479.0,I know you don't. I gotchu. I'm still angry and small and mixed so this is where I'll roar.
mixedrace,ffx0b81,t1_ffwxui4,1580315000.0,"> I asked for their thought on if they were treated worse or not. But I guess only mixed race thoughts matter.

I'm not going to fault you for being curious but this is not the oppression Olympics. It's not about silencing anyone either.
For me at least, being lumped into ""people of color"" category was at least our chance of being counted, a seat at the table. But it was also akin to our 3/5 compromise. We weren't completely counted. We had to choose one side or the other. Only part of us. We had no voice at the table. Now we're counted, all parts equally. No more choosing sides, no more silencing that voice.

So when single-raced people tell me ""we're all a little mixed"" it's like they're pushing me out of my seat a little bit and trying to talk about my experience when I just got here! How RUDE."
mixedrace,ffwne3h,t1_ffwm47f,1580306233.0,"Well for a while everyone except Anglican whites were lumped into the ""coloured"" category on the census. Before they weren't counted as a person. Then the govt granted the ""3/5 compromise"". So they went from not acknowledged to kinda recognized to fully acknowledged. 

In the same way, mixed people were categorized as ""coloured"" and weren't separated from that category until 2000 (as an other category) and fully identified in 2010 (allowing you to choose *which* races you were).

We went from being not being acknowledged to kinda being acknowledged throughout the 3/5 compromise until 2000/2010, when we were finally recognized. 

So yes it's gonna take me a minute to sympathize with single raced people wanting to say they're mixed. About 213 years give or take."
mixedrace,ffwmbgk,t3_ev4sau,1580305388.0,"There are some white people who ""get it"". I'm in the southern US (racism nirvana) and even here I've met a few. Especially in my university. The more I strayed from business majors and got into the humanities (music, psychology, social& community studies) the more I found people who were willing to let me talk about my racism experience. They do exist. Don't let the bad ones jade you. That's the goal of racism; keeping us disgusted, subjugated, and upset."

- I'm not from the first 3 countries you think I'm from.  
- randomly ask how to make a tamale or chorizo
- tell them you're ethnically ambiguous
- 50 shades of brown"

I guess with my tan skin I look Hispanic. My sister has curly hair so they correctly guess hers. They even ask if we had the same fathers (yes lol).

As far as any insecurities you have, the easy way I've coped is to make it a game when they ask ""what are you"" (50 shades of brown, I'm every woman, I'm not the race you're thinking of I'm the other one, a little mysterious a little self conscious)

And (if you feel like it) you can jokingly educate them on how:
- it's kinda ""weird"" to ask my race before my name
- interrupt the conversation we were having to talk about this (if convo not related)
- not all mixed babies look alike Andre."
