minidisc,ff7dla9,t3_erzkxl,1579647098.0,Mini disc's are really cool little devices. They let me record in a decent quality from virtually any analog source edit that on the device and it's indistinguishable from CD to my ears. I mean they were killed off by the music industry for a reason. The mini disc scared them to death.

minidisc,fegx4ub,t3_ep3nse,1579104500.0,Nice idea. Fact is mini disc recorders are optimized for analog recording. I gave up using optical since I can get better results using analog and I open up more sources for recording. I like to hop on soundcloud and plug my 3.5 mm cable into my phone and record in analog. I get great results and it's free lol.

fightsticks,fefgsp2,t3_eny0k2,1579056009.0,"I'm only just recently trying to get a fight stick. I've read through all the notes above and watched a ton of videos and I'd like to get a Panthera because I like that it opens up like it does. The new EVO is out now and it doesn't open up like it used to and the market is now out of stock on the first one. I been looking all over and there aren't any. Ebay has them but they are selling for double the MSRP. Poor timing on my part, I should have been looking at these before this time. 

edit: Alternatively there are the Madcatz Street Fighter V sticks available right now. And another option popped up on my Craigslist for a Etokki Omni used for a decent price."

minidisc,fecnm7v,t3_eognf8,1578978444.0,You need to delete the track before it will use the free space. Once a disc is full it won't continue to record. Just delete old stuff to free up the space you need.

I tried them at the best buy and I thought they were ok but not better than the Crusher wireless. And the noise cancelling is middle of the road at best. They hum like when you turn on an amp.

As with any savings kept at home I always think about security and one way to minimize the risk of loss like fire or theft is simply to not let the the amount get too large. I would be looking to sell. Keep the cream of the crop for sentimental value and for your old age pension.
