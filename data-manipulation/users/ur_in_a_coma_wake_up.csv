Edit: like I’m not very comfortable with it either. But I’ve had enough pets to know that no matter how glutton they are, they spit the things they don’t like. If that cat is continuously licking it, it can’t hate it that much. So it makes me feel somewhat better about it."

AskReddit,ffaqml5,t1_ffa4no7,1579742202.0,"To be *fair*,  something like only 20% of the open  job positions make it to public offers.  The best way to find a job is through  networking, but in any cases, HR won’t post a job offer until there’s no possible applicant on hands. Sending your resume even if you don’t know they’re hiring (without being obnoxious and barging in) is actually a good thing, as you may catch them in that period between needing someone and actually posting a job offer. Even if they don’t, they may keep your resume until the next open position and call you."

The whole ""you should love yourself the way you are"" is cool and all but mutherfucking easier said than done, you can’t just suddenly chose to like that part of your body.  It’s stupid to let something bother you all your life out of pride and false sense of superiority(for being *authentic*) instead of doing something about it and feel better. 

Also, following your logic, you don’t really have any confidence in yourself if you do anything to enhance the ""real"" you. Wearing flattering dress? Dying your hair? Wearing makeup? Wow you don’t love yourself, this won’t fix your issues, you know.if you can’t live your life with a potato sack and the head you have when you just woke up, then you do not have confidence in who you really are. ... see how pretentious that sound?"

you missed my point, the coach rule is based on gender, the act of slapping someone who is breaking the law isn’t.the father wasn’t slapped because families are allowed

You could either say, 1. Police slapping citizens is bad, which is a fair point, or, 2. Gendered coaches are bad, which I don’t agree with, but it is indeed gender profiling so it’s also a valid opinion. 

But You can’t says that the *slapping* part is sexist. They would slap women too for minor infractions. no women is breaking the law in this video, on course they’re not getting slapped."

Police over there just kinda smack people on the head and yell when they commit minor crimes not worth real repercussions. They were slapped because they rode in a wagon they’re not allowed in, not because they’re big bad evil penis havers.

shitpostemblem,fev1hdp,t1_feseahg,1579392069.0,"I think he explains the reason he’s such an ass, he consider that every women who approach him are really only after his crest and see him as a way to have crest babies and be set for life, they don’t really care about him. Wether it’s true or not, like you said, Sylvain himself doesn’t see value in himself behind his crest, why would others, right? So he has no respect for those girls  and no remorse breaking their ""heart"", because really they were never in love, they’re just sad their plan didn’t work. Sylvain want to at least have some fun if those girls are planning to use him anyway.
Now like I said, we don’t know if it’s true, Sylvain is good looking and charismatic, plenty of girls must like him for him, but he doesn’t see that."
