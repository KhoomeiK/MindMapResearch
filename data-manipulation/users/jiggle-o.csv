RandomActsOfPetFood,fgf9ox8,t1_fgf70uh,1580731427.0,"Everywhere has it's pros and cons. I've lived in several states. No offense, but Detroit was one of the worst places I've ever lived. I absolutely loved the UP. really enjoyed upstate NY. Outside of Eagle Colorado was one of my favorite places. Oh the stories I could tell and they'd all be good. California we had a couple great block parties, especially the hurricane party. However in Livonia there was this little grill and pub place that was just amazing. The owner was an awesome guy. Schoolcraft was an amazing employer. Also the Brazilian steak house was good eats. They had this local food thing around there called pasties. Kind of like pot pies, but so much better.  

All in all pros and cons of course. Michigan had great hunting and fishing. I'm a fairly avid bow hunter and fly fisher. That's the big thing I miss about up north. I don't mind having 9 months of summer and 3 months of winter now."
