xboxone,ffeki84,t1_ffeju5j,1579851839.0,"I mean I can say from personal experience, Xbox game streaming on my phone is pretty solid. Played some Halo 5 multiplayer yesterday and there wasn't any noticable latency, and that was on my shitty wifi. People with gigabit are saying d2 is unplayable on stadia.

Xbox is free, has more games, also has d2, for free. Will soon allow anyone to stream any game loaded on there Xbox to be streamed.

Xbox is blowing stadia out of the water with a beta/preview product, whereas stadia is a released product with limiting hardware (ironic af) and only available on certain phone. Again, Xbox game streaming is on all Android phones.

Where you're getting stadia is even remotely ahead of xbox is beyond me.

Unless they do a Netflix, pay for a library type of thing soon, stadia will be dead, old, news."

'you can see plot threads' 

'that does its own thing'.

It was a movie that was going one direction and then had it's directors pulled and switched out, so the final product feels off and doesn't flow well because of that. It doesn't just work, unfortunately they couldn't afford Todd Howard.

Warframe,ffehlh0,t1_ffee8zo,1579848321.0,"Nah I mean, honestly for me, with the new melee system, having a good stance makes all the difference to me now. Like blind justice is amazing, reaping spiral for scythes is so good, vulpine mask on rapiers is great, most of the sword stances are cool. 

But I recently got the spring loaded blade mod, which gives you  2m of range, so that paired with p reach, and a range riven, I have over 10m of range on my Prisma skana, and I've been using that a lot, and it's doing great without even having ppp or co. I've just found that I wanna melee all the time so using naramon for the constant melee combo is the obvious choice. So just having BR, WW, and organ shatter, along with range mods can take me pretty far. I'm formaing my skana now to fit CO, so it will do even better, especially with the high status helping get more bleed procs, and all the crit from br making the bleeds even better.

I just think crit and status pair so we'll together, why only choose one or the other"

I just don't understand why you'd actively avoid weapons with good stats just to prove a point?

So a pure status build is what:

CO, p fury, p reach, 4 60/60 for rad/viral or Corr/blast etc, plus a riven or p fever strike? I mean o guess that works. I just think ignoring crit, the combo multiplier, etc is silly. I like using *all* the tools at my disposal.

And as for hybrid builds being a waste...it's more a perfect balance. Utilizing all that a weapon plus mods can offer."

Warframe,ffdzswk,t1_ffddovl,1579833033.0,"At this point I don't even know what a 'pure status' build looks like. Is it half the mod slots empty? Cuz when I wanna play for melee, I can easily get 100% status with weeping wounds. I use naramon for constant 11-12x combo and since I don't need combo duration or status chance mods besides ww, I can pair my 12x combo perfectly with blood rush, or maybe combo efficiency and sacrificial steel for a few heavy attacks thrown in.

I'm genuinely confused why you would go out of your way to use a weapon with shit-tier crit stats when it's so easy to have great crit and status. Like, I can do a ton of status too, and have the numbers be big. That's called building effectively."

O usually run naramon power spike for the always 12x combo, with both BR and WW.

Kripath *rapier* is also dope. The vulpine mask stance is really good and bleeds targets out insanely fast.

Warframe,ffbmukj,t3_esn27n,1579773250.0,"Eventually you'll have MILLIONS of credits. So dont sweat about getting those. As for the premium currency, platinum, you can trade items like prime parts and mods with other players for platinum. It's very easy, and can be fun.

You don't need to and should not be buying frames and especially not weapons with platinum. It's easy enough to buy the blueprint with credits and build the weapon or frame in your foundry. No need to waste plat on that. Use your plate for cosmetics and things that's are only available to get with plat.

But for now, the only thing you should be spending plat on is weapon and Warframe slots. That's the biggest hurdle. Having enough slot. Luckily its not too tough to farm prime parts in fissure missions, then sell those parts to players as prime junk for plat, then you can buy your slots with that."

And you believed it. Judged others for fucking shitting. How gross. It stank, and hurt sometimes and then they just kept doing it, *D A I L Y*

You were a proper non pooper boy who would only poop when the time finally came at the end.

But then you had that burrito. It was delicious, magnificent, meaty. You looked pregnant after eating it. You were happy...for a time.

Then, suddenly you got this...feeling. what was wrong, were you poisoned? How dare those burrito hipsters poison you. They're probably fucking *poopers*!

But the feeling in your gut got worse, a hot sickly feeling brewing in your gut, it started to feel like a swelling. You were sweating, surely sick. What could this horror be??

Soon the feeling in your gut moved lower, growing in urgency, how could you possibly live with this feeling. But you did, at times it faded a bit, and you thought you'd fought the demons back. While out someone asked you what's wrong and you replied that your stomach hurt. They could tell from your stiff shuffle that you had to poop.

""Looks like you have to poop my man""

You could have slapped him. If the motion didn't make feel like you'd like if you moved that much. How dare he suggest something so vile. Pooping *pshhh* rubbish

But it got worse, your outlook on life diminished, you were short and angry with everyone around you. Nothing your close friends suggested had any effect. But they were also being less friendly. Did they know something you didn't? Was something truly wrong with you.

You remembered the guy who suggested you had to poop...omg. maybe that's what your friends thought?! After their suggestions didn't work theoir filthy minds went to thought of pooping. Well fuck them. They should know me better. I was raised better than to be a thought of as a pooper. Pooping was WRONG.

But it had been days since the sickness. Your appetite dwindled, your energy was low, you could hardly get out of bed. Too much exertion aggravated the pain.

*Ding-dong*

The sound of your doorbell was so surprising that you could have swore you felt something poke out from down there...no

No it couldn't be, there was no way you had to poop. That was impossible, you didn't the right things in life, you had the right friends, you were a member of the anti-poop clan in your town. But this feeling wouldn't shake.

What if pooping could end your misery, what if it would all be better and you could finally get some sleep of you just pooped?

No



Maybe? Idk.

How could I be thinking this you think.

Am I really going to become a disgusting pooper. And even if you did decide to poop, you didn't own any of that shameful toilet paper. How would you...wipe.

But the pain. Oh the pain was unbearable. If someone said $100,000 would fix this, you find a way to get that money, if it was the last thing you did. Anything for this suffering to end.

But pooping was free, yea, at least I wouldn't have to remortgage my house to get rid of this right? Right? I mean if pooping saves you from pain like this, how could it be evil?

Was it from the burrito? You'd never eaten something so dense, solid, delicious...

Your stomach lurched.

Ohhhhh...god if this is what will save me, I'll do it!!!....*sob* I'll try pooping

And what a poop it was.

A literal explosion, and not just out your ass. An explosion of relief washed over you and you could have sworn you'd just mainlined heroin.

*THIS* WAS POOPING!!??

WUT.

This was amazing. Sure it smelled but my god was it a relief.

How could I have seen this, this glorious relief as something vile? Why did no one tell me that pooping could be so freeing?

Why were all my friends anti-poop? Was it because their parents were before them, and yours before you? Did none of them even try to see how all those people who freely pooped for *years* only ever was to seek relief from a life of constant suffering and pain, and who could fault them.

What, what was I thinking before.

If someone wants to poop, they should absolutely be able to. No one should have to be a slave to that type of torture.

I definitely don't overeat, but if I do have weeks where I gain weight, I have to keep up that caloric intake to maintain the majority of that weight, otherwise I fall back down to my normal 150-160 instead of 170-175. I'm 6'.

I like my vegetables, hate soda, drink my coffee black, and don't eat when my stomach is full. I usually stop at an 8.5-9/10 in 'fullness', otherwise I'm uncomfortable, and to me, it's silly to eat when you aren't hungry. I occasionally do indoor gym rock climbing, but that's more closer to lifting weights than it is running on a treadmill, plus I always eat a huge meal after climbing so I don't really see my 'excercise' as something that has a significant impact on my weight (if anything the bit of muscle I've gained from it has probably contributed to me gaining weight)

For me, food is fuel, obviously I like certain things and have preferences, but if I have to eat just whatever, that's fine by me, as long as it fills me up.I know for some people food is much more than that, a coping mechanism, or making it and enjoying it is a hobby and passion, and that will definitely have an effect on how much you are or aren't willing to 'comfortably' eat. Also, I definitely just have a fast metabolism. No one on either side of my immediate family is overweight.

Idk if this helps, but it's what I could think of. I guess if eating less and trying to exercise a bit isnt something you're easily willing to do, you'll probably want to look at the problem (if you even consider it one) from a mental perspective; how do you see food, do you force yourself to finish your plate, even if you feel worse every additional bite you eat?

Warframe,fed2429,t1_fed1ry2,1578994891.0,"I also do loops around for energy as Nova, and knowing where a group has spawned allows me to divert to them faster, and then I can load up a tig p primed bomb and obliterate the lot of them. Vigilante pursuit works really well.

And honestly if a full squad is killing enemies it can actually be kinda tough to find them before other team mates...that have a form of enemy radar, kill them first.

So for me, enemy radar of some kind is a must have as it speeds up matches even more.

Plus I just really like knowing the spawns before they spread out.

For me, choosing to not run enemy radar in index is like someone offering you a $20 and you saying, 'eh, you got a $10 instead?'"

The amount of times I've been in a defense as my ""2"" khora and I'm paired with a dome spamming khora and they just bring the mission to a halt is sad.

Like, hey, I'm gonna make each enemy here really *really* annoying to kill. And I have to say, hey!, use 2, not 4, you're making this take waaay too long"

This is literally just another player complaining because they can't make simple sales to get more slots."
