todayilearned,fft8qv4,t1_fft6yrz,1580212480.0,"No idea. Pretty sure none though. Under constant fire for 2 years and on the move. Dont think there was too much raping and pillaging, they were too busy liberating lands  and nazi hunting."
todayilearned,fft2igd,t1_ffstycf,1580203577.0,Point on there. Its NOT FUCKING COMPARABLE AT ALL....but the shitlibs want it to be...its the lie they are trying to sell.
todayilearned,fft28ls,t1_fft0i7d,1580203147.0,"Yep, and yet the deniers exist today. Funny when most of them now dont even have parents that were alive then. Its like 3 generations later and they want to deny events that literally shaped everything in the world. Everything from ally support, trade, war reparations, war crimes, acts of war, financial markets.....literally everything was changed by ww2."

todayilearned,ffswpvs,t1_ffsrx3r,1580195576.0,"Well, firstly, first those ""kids"" need to be proven as under age minors---cartells love using stolenbkids to run dope and for sex trades. Next, they have to prove those kids are actually offspring to those saying that they are the parents----a lot of the time they are not for any one of many reasons. Until this is figured out, they are in holding centers and then in actual foster homes. If its found they have legitimate relatives in the US then they get released to them while the court proceeding get started. The reason they get held so long now is because the system is backlogged due to things like those caravans of thousands upon thousands arriving. The process is legal----it happens to be law. Blobama enacted and democrat supported---so if you have a bitch with it then take it up with your democratic reps that enacted it in the first place. I personally dont like it, and I would refuse them border entry altogether and ship the rest back out of the country as soon as they get picked up----elliminate taking kids and adults altogether into custody. Illegal activity and criminal trespassing on a repeat basis doesn't help their causes either, yet they keep doing it and think they should be GIVEN a free pass.....It doesn't work that way in America. Until it is legal to do so even the aliens are subject to immigration laws---like it or not."
todayilearned,ffsqel9,t1_ffsorqx,1580188832.0,"Its not the same scenario at all. Going into peoples homes and arresting them in a land where they are legally, stealing all their posessions and wealth, and then shepherding them into work camps where they either starve to death, experimented on, shot, or are gassed and burned doesnt resemble illegal invaders being detained when they are attempting illegal entry into a country. Nice try, you cant twist these two together in any way. Fill your driven agenda elsewhere bub."
AnythingGoesNews,ffsojxs,t1_ffsly65,1580187169.0,"Nope, I cannot. But I have a birth cert, so do my parents and grandparents that show we were born here. Hell ,I probably have more relatives buried under white crosses than your family lineage has. Lets see, I can think of 6 that fought overseas and came back in boxes, probably 20 that served their terms or retired military. Illegal me?......hahahahaha."
todayilearned,ffsicdf,t1_ffsg9kd,1580182412.0,"He never talked too much on it either. He was a Ranger----basicly a day or two ahead of the main army. Their job was to kill as many officers to create mayhem and knock out defensive positions. He screamed a lot at night, and ultimately commited suicide by shotgun. He told my dad the worst part was he was killing school kids (enemy Germans) that were youger than he was, and I think he was only 18 or so. Personally I am glad I never enlisted or had to, but I am also forever grateful for those that gave their lives--and mental healt--so I could live a life off the battlefield."
todayilearned,ffsh9uc,t1_ffsg5x7,1580181673.0,"How the flying fuck do you come up with that ?! I agree we have waaay too many troops around the world, but its because our pussy allies cannot protect themselves and repeatedly start conflicts they know they cannot win----but being an American ""ally"" means we are treaty ound to help them defend themselves. Also, even more recently in the mid east, since Trump was elected deaths caused or supported by American troops has fallen off dramatically.---Trump is trying to be humane and just get us out of that shithole part of the world. Get your facts straight bub. As far as our detention centers for illegal aliens goes---the fucking invaders KNOW THATS WHAT TO EXPECT and they still try illegal entry while bypassing all legal ways to claim refugee status or apply for a visa. Self imposed prison is all that is....and I support our government doing that over open border policies----which is completely irresponsible to do. We have laws here, if you dont like them or decide not to follow them then dont come here or get the fuck out of here----its that simple. We dont want you. We want people who want to be Americans. America First, and it works."
AnythingGoesNews,ffsfisu,t1_ffsa4wv,1580180447.0,"My ancestors came here from Germany---both sides---around 1890 or so. Guess what? They came here LEGALLY. They went to work, they learned the language (english), and they became productive citizens. My grandmother knew and could even speak German, but her parents would scold her severely for it. They told her that she was American now---talk and become like an American. Her parents went through the whole detention and screening process for valid naturalization. Yes it IS different now.....most wannabe Americans dont want to have to do a damn thing but get here whether legally or not, then never conform to American normality."
todayilearned,ffs8car,t1_ffs7mgc,1580175628.0,"Once again, I will take the words of the soldiers that were there.....fuck scientists that weren't even near there. You know, you cant erase the past, and it certainly doesn't help humanity as a whole to deny how cruel and merciless we humans can be against each other. The mass graves are still there, theres even many thousands of photographs and film reels on it. Scientists? Gimmie a fucking break. Tens of thousands of actual accounts and you rebuff with what some fucking scientist theorizes? Hahaha....you are a poster child of the sheeple."

todayilearned,ffs6hwb,t3_euxlay,1580174339.0,"My grandpa told me of this. He was an Army Ranger. He said the denial of the German citizens in close by towns and cities pissed all the allied forces off tremendously----- they flat out denied there were slave encampments that were murdering and burning tens of thousands of Jews---when you could almost look out the window to see it happening. He said they marched those citizens out to the camps (some at gunpoint) and forced them to haul and bury the bodies of thr recently deceased, and forced them through tours of the gas and cremation chambers where bone, skull, and teeth still remained."
todayilearned,ffs1jy8,t1_ffs18hx,1580170882.0,"Its a generalization. My numbers are about what I think is average for the country. And banks fall over each other to loan money to young, inexperienced grads....BTW,  I didn't even bring up the numbers for credit card debt.....I think that runs around $10,000 per adult nationwide also....."
AnythingGoesNews,ffs117r,t3_euw1md,1580170529.0,Any American wanting to visit any Asian province deserves what they get for doing so. I personally think it should be mandated that anyone going there is quaranteed to stay there until this modern plague is over with. But we Americans are fucking stupid about things like this  our government will support letting people go there and bringing it back to infect everyone here also....fucking stupid.
AnythingGoesNews,ffs0qeg,t3_euw2ah,1580170323.0,"Amazing and frankly----its about damn time. Immigrants coming to America to abuse the welfare system designed for US citizens has been a problem for many decades. Now they can be denied those bennies. First steps in controlled, legal immigration. Now more pressure needs applied on the visa overstays. Direct bus tickets out is my idea."
todayilearned,ffrzv8n,t3_euwtmd,1580169723.0,"Let me tell you what I havr seen here in America. Besides the easily spent $15,000 on a wedding, both husband and wife *have* to be driving $30,000 cars, and buying a start up newly built home for a minimum of $160,000 also. Now add to that they are most likely young, and have no real seniority in the workforce by experience or years tied to a job, plus they may be fresh out of college with $20,000 apiece in school debt. Now you arr getting a real view of ""the modern American dream"". Borrow, spend, borrow more, spend more, ignore bills, divorc, claim bankrupt and the banks own everything you were working for......I have seen that happen to many newlyweds within the first 2 years....."

I would imagine it will be a cube like structure you tie pieces together for. I have poured many piers like your future one, and we used to preassemble them at the shop and haul them to the job as needed. Most were waaaay bigger than your dimensions, and were made for structural steel buildings. The hole itself was usually roughly squared, and bell shaped---bottom wider than top. Also, the rebar cages were made to be within say 4"" of the pier edges and suspended in the concrete as it was being poured. Good luck."

The numbers were most likely waaaaay under reported from China to begin with, I am thinking infected people were probably more like 5× what was stated, and I am sure patient zero was days before they are stating it now. I would bet there are at least 5,000+ infected, and many times what is reported as dead.

After a signifigant discovery is made then you will have worldwide leaders throwing down serious cash to get expeditions going to stamp out claims."
