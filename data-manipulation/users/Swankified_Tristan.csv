Again though,  I'm fine.  It's Star Wars and I've liked it more upon rewatches.

As for a more detailed explanation on why I love The Tast Jedi, I think [this video](https://youtu.be/T2cBTLsWiDg) does the best job of explaining.  It words points that I'd like to make but does it in a much better (and entertaining) way."

When Empire came out, some people weren't happy, complaining that it either complicated things or felt too plot heavy and confusing or that it just didn't live up to it's predecessor. When ""Return of the Jedi"" came out, many people didn't think it lived up to the hype of Empire. A lot of people hated the Ewoks and overall regarded ""Jedi"" as a rather weak conclusion. 

When the Prequels came out, people denied that they were a part of ""their Star Wars."" Only the Original Trilogy mattered. When Disney took over, people started claiming that only the Prequels and OT were a part of ""their Star Wars.""

Now only the Prequels, OT, and ""The Mandalorian"" are part of ""their Star Wars."" The Sequel Trilogy is trash.
