BPD,ffebmhe,t1_ffdvkw2,1579842275.0,This.
BPDmemes,ffdzzsr,t1_ffdxbda,1579833171.0,It’s so counter intuitive and I really don’t care if anyone gets it or not but I swear it’s the healthiest thing I’ve ever done. Constantly getting swept from thing to thing and person to person and having no control over my emotional life was killing me.
BPDmemes,ffdsfpt,t3_esuw00,1579827769.0,Dude. I’m at the point now where I’m just embracing hard core extreme pessimism cause it’s the only way I can commit to just one vibe. I just can’t feel this many contradictory things at once anymore.

BPD,ffcyp95,t3_esuu58,1579810007.0,"I feel like this sometimes. It’s crazy how I’d rather be out of my mind with sadness or anxiety than be in that space where I can’t feel anything or engage with anything, it’s just the worst. I just do my best to remember that it will pass and try to buckle in and ride it out. Eventually it does and I can enjoy the little things again, but it sure is hell while it’s happening."
BPDmemes,ff8ghrj,t3_erxw0r,1579677426.0,Well fuck
BPD,ff7gntp,t3_eryieu,1579649114.0,Never again.
BPD,ff41adw,t1_ff3ddn2,1579553367.0,"Me too, thanks for this."
BPD,ff412fy,t3_erc86h,1579553231.0,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. I think, for me anyway, there’s a lack of ability to love and trust with all of myself because I’m too damaged. I want to trust people and accept love, but I can’t really believe it with all of myself so I kind of shift back and forth between adoring someone and enjoying what little of their love I can accept, and being angry at them because I don’t feel as close to them as I feel like I should. Like if they just loved me enough I wouldn’t feel this distance from them. But it’s not their fault, I’m the one that’s creating it. 

I’m desperate to feel loved but I just can’t so I take that pain out on the people I care about most for not caring enough or trying hard enough to break through. Or something."
depression_memes,ff2orhs,t1_ff2hzke,1579516820.0,"I find that saying self deprecating things can be a form of self care, because it’s a way of using your damage to bring people into where you’re at instead of becoming further isolated from them by hiding everything. It seems like dark jokes are kind of the only socially acceptable way to admit you’re struggling, and it’s more honest than whitewashing everything like most people do."

BPD,ff2iv8y,t3_er3tga,1579508101.0,"I think I’ve been alone for so long that I no longer have the capacity to feel alone, because I can’t imagine any other state. It’s like how if you live your whole life in the ocean you don’t see the water."

VoidCake,feredta,t1_fer9t33,1579352924.0,Why thank you.
nihilism,fepuvrp,t3_eqaadq,1579332145.0,"“Happiness” is in finding a balance within the ever changing circumstances of your life and relationships. Thus “100% happy” is not a real thing because you cannot exist in a vacuum, you are always balancing on things that are constantly shifting in ways that are out of your control. I think “happiness” just comes from being good at falling and course correcting."

BPD,fep3dez,t3_eq4zga,1579311225.0,"I’m tired of watching myself screw up all of my relationships, care too much and then watch the whole thing implode and then be destroyed for months. I’ve basically sworn off all human connection until I can get my shit together, which hopefully is a thing I can do. It’s not ideal but it’s better than needing people in ways I can never have them cause at least I’m somewhat in control."

TrollCoping,feket1n,t1_fejgrg5,1579198547.0,Sounds like a keeper
butchlesbians,feiy6j1,t3_eo9k80,1579150509.0,Yeah the worst part is having to act grateful about it when you’re actually secretly annoyed so you don’t come off like a bitch.
TrollCoping,fef9sdi,t1_fef59ir,1579051543.0,Of all the ways you could go I gotta say I see the appeal.

BPD,fecb8zm,t1_fec9uxr,1578970025.0,"Lol, that’s literally the only time anyone has called my take on anything “less cynical”. That’s refreshing, thanks."
BPD,febj5f5,t1_feb7dvz,1578959332.0,"Albeit this is an unpopular opinion, but I think it’s kind of sweet when people use their much less extreme problems and use the same words, like they’re trying to bridge that gap and make us feel less alone. Otherwise it can start to feel like it’s the normies vs the freaks, and we’re just being quietly judged and tolerated. Picture perfect mental health doesn’t exist, it’s kind of nice to be reminded we’re all just on a spectrum somewhere, doing our best."
BPD,fe6az9p,t1_fe6ar77,1578885827.0,"It’s definitely worth putting the effort into learning how to pull back emotionally, especially in the beginning. It feels really unnatural at first but it’s super important for overly emotional people who get attached easily. Still working on it myself on the daily."
BPD,fe6a8ym,t1_fe69pf4,1578885296.0,"The shitty thing is I’m actually incredibly loyal when I’m in a relationship I put my all into it and I don’t fuck around. I think I’d be a pretty good partner to someone who could handle my bullshit and shared my values. I guess that’s asking a lot though, there’s a lot of bullshit. Maybe it’s not fair to ask someone to put up with all that."
BPD,fe69d0y,t1_fe68v0r,1578884670.0,"I read into everything too much too, always overreacting to the tiniest stuff. I think I might just be too weak for relationships. So rude that people can be built that way, like solitude is their fucking destiny. Whoever put me together was a real douche and I’d like a word with them."
depression_memes,fe67jts,t3_enr21y,1578883551.0,Also how do I turn my food addiction into anorexia. Anyone?
depression_memes,fe67ebn,t3_enr21y,1578883458.0,"I mean, these are literally the only options. What the hell are we supposed to do?"
BPD,fe5xv6e,t1_fe5x8t0,1578877372.0,"Thanks. It’s like I want to hold it against people but I can’t because I know I’m just a black hole of need that expects too much. I don’t want to hold it against people for not living up to my unreasonable expectations of them. But if none of your needs as a person are getting met I just don’t know how anybody can square with that. How do you move forward from that? I just don’t know what the answer is, it feels like a riddle without a solution."
thanksimcured,fdyi0uv,t3_en8qtb,1578780030.0,This explains so much
BPD,fdyhy2p,t3_en86rh,1578780006.0,Just wanted to add that you should put the work in and try to temper the intensity if you can. Trust me- you’ll thank yourself later.
BPD,fdy47q9,t3_en86rh,1578775944.0,"I think it might be because it’s not actually love, but codependency."
BPD,fdsohok,t1_fdsk595,1578705901.0,I really hope there is one. But if it exists I still haven’t found it.
BPD,fdsiuyw,t3_emrmqz,1578703591.0,It’s cozier to just reject all people than it is to succumb to the hell that comes from ever needing people.
TrollCoping,fdmobfb,t3_elsy4j,1578557853.0,I appreciate someone who can acknowledge the bright side
depression_memes,fdmnmoo,t1_fdmnl6z,1578556985.0,"Fair enough, I’ve just always wondered. I hope it gets you out of jury duty."
