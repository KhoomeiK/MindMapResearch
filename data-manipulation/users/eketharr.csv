cairnterrier,ff964vt,t1_ff7iw25,1579705747.0,He acts cool whenever he's not laying on the floor like a hunting trophy or jumping and twirling from excitement!
Eyebleach,ff3w6hj,t1_ff3p6ns,1579550176.0,I know you probably are joking but wild animals are not pets. It's immoral and in most places illegal but still people do it because they are exotic.
Eyebleach,ff3w0vj,t1_ff315qz,1579550081.0,It's not that cute when you learn they are taken from their mothers for zoos etc. and given these support dogs to help that anxiety.
Awwducational,fegpc7h,t1_fegmini,1579099345.0,Not really cute when you figure out the shyness is just anxiety caused by human actions.
FromPuppyToDog,fdyvy0r,t1_fdysbva,1578784119.0,I agree with the snout! Nostrils seem a bit narrow though. Hope she's happy and healthy!
jacksepticeye,fdxv51z,t1_fdvwl2s,1578773233.0,I cringe at these every time.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdlarnl,t1_fdl7b9h,1578520053.0,"So sorry for your pup! That sounds horrible but at least she had some great time with you, labs are the sweetest. Those kinds of cases are why most of the people should have a mandatory dog training course before they are allowed to have pets.

Yeah crating as a training method is fine as long as it is only temporary and not a solution. When my dog was a pup we fenced off the space so he had kitchen and the foyer to use - minimal things to destroy and the smaller space to ""guard"" calmed him down. After teething and when it seemed that he didn't really even try to gnaw on anything we got rid of the gate and tried to leave him to the rest of the house. He had toys and bones to chew on so he never even thought of trying anything else! 

I hope that more people would wake to the fact that crating the dog for multiple hours a day in a small space is not fine."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdksa4a,t1_fdkrilj,1578510102.0,"You mean being stuck to coat hangers?

To that I can say there are (almost always) better ways to make sure the dog is safe at home than to put it to a cage only a tad bigger than the dog itself.

Restricting an area for the dog is fine, but they should have some room to move around more than roll over. Of course some cases a crate is good for training, but it's never a permanent solution.

To me regular crating seems absurd since it's so rare here. With training and sealing off harmful things and/or fencing off unwanted parts of the house it's much more comfortable for anyone to leave the dog at home."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdk8ihu,t1_fdk014e,1578498493.0,"Of course there are some situations that require different means of action. My comment was more about how it's so popular just to leave training all together and just put the dog in a cage so it's easier for the owner (I know not all think that). 

My dog doesn't mind the crate and it's used to it, but I never lock him in there so he can go whenever he pleases. At nights we do close our bedroom door so the dog doesn't roam around listening to all the things that go bump in the night. There is a difference how you use the crate, the crate itself isn't an evil thing. 

As a tool of training I don't mind using the crate. But it absolutely should be seen as a temporary thing and not for extended periods of time. In Finland it's about 4 hours tops to keep a dog in a crate and there are requirements for how big of a space dog should have as a regular living space. I've gotten the idea it's more of a nom especially in the US to keep a dog in a cage for a work day which seems incredibly long time to be restricted even if the cage is ""big enough""."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdk7iik,t1_fdk4235,1578497851.0,"Well it's not completely illegal, but there is a limit how many hours it's allowed to keep a dog in, IIRC it's about 4 hours max.

It can be used as a _temporary_ tool for training, but from what I understand for many it's a permanent and easy way of restraining the dog from demolishing the house. It seems normal to keep the dog in a cage for work days which to me sounds like a horribly long time for a dog to be alone in a small space. 

So my point is it's clearly viewed differently in different places. Our dog trainers absolutely advocate training beside the ""crating"" and it should not be a permanent solution. In Finland some do restrict dogs to a specific part of the house if needed, but there are definite requirements for how big the space should be for a dog. But I'd say a majority of our pets aren't really restricted or crated when left alone."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdk2ho4,t1_fdk011h,1578494446.0,"There is a limit how many hours it's ok to leave a dog in a cage, from what I remember it's around 4 hours. Of course many people use it still and it's difficult to prove if the dog is really spending more time in that cage.

Many people take it as a easy way out and a replacement for training your dog properly. Of course if used right it is a great device to help your dog to adapt to different places and situations but many people are just lazy and keep their dog there."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdjt3il,t3_elolaq,1578486534.0,"I'm just wondering is crating really a popular thing in the US?

I'm curious since it's illegal in Finland and seems unnecessary if training has been done properly."
pregnant,fdhhutj,t1_fdhgp9f,1578422966.0,"Yes, it's at her home. I think if working there gives me anxiety and physical discomfort and fatigue, I don't think it's in anyones benefit for me to continue. Not even the client's since I have to leave early most of the days since I'm so nauseated. To top it off the stress hormones aren't really good for the baby that regularly. 

And to ""suck it up"" would mean that I would just handle sleeping and laying on the couch all of my days off. For me that kind of pregnancy isn't really a great one. 

Yes this might seem like an excuse to stop working there, but I don't think anyone, especially pregnant, should be exposed to second hand smoking. I'm not trying to stop working entirely, I just think I deserve a stress free and healthy environment to work.

You are free to disagree with me of course!"
lookatmydog,fch9c6v,t1_fcgvma5,1577648490.0,"He's name is Eppu! (We live in Finland) He is the most gentle and endearing dog I've ever met. Also it's surprising how easy and healthy he has been, since he is a rescue from Russia. Truly a jackpot!"

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fc7tri8,t1_fc6fbct,1577518422.0,"We don't hate fat things or animals, we care about the animals for their sake. Being fat isn't an instant death sentence but it always does reduce the quality of the dogs life and causes unnecessary problems and discomfort and shortens the lifespan.

It's not good that on the internet obese animals are mostly seen as cute and funny because it justifies and overrides the fact that they are unhealthy and not living as well as they could."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fc64nqo,t1_fc63by1,1577472184.0,"Of course healthy dogs also can die in a short period of time, I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that to dogs being even a bit overweight can increase risks of getting ill to various problems due to being overweight and excess weight causes distress on the joints.

I'm not saying that this dog doesn't have a good life and I bet he's well taken care of, but to give it's best chance to live as long and healthy as possible it would be in the dogs interest for the owners to acknowledge that and try to manage the weight as well as they can. Of course we don't know if it's already being taken care of (change doesn't come in a night and of course I can't judge that from a sole image). Just trying to help!
