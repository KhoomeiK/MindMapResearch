WhitePeopleTwitter,ffhvbap,t1_ffhcdpb,1579955582.0,"I've got measurement conversions down since I deal with them all the time, plus I have my speedometer which helps me convert miles to kilometers pretty easy if I'm ever curious about it.

I have a hard time with temperature cause it's either I have fahrenheit or celsius but never both and that's stupid as shit.

Then as for weight it's just something I don't typically have to run into very often. I also have 0 reference for conversions or anything, as opposed to meters which I can just round up to about 3 feet and visualize it easily. I can't visualize weight easily.

So learning it I'm sure isn't hard, but in order to learn you need to practice it every day and I just don't run into it often enough aside from, like I said, distance/length."
todayilearned,ffhu80w,t1_ffhtyta,1579954135.0,"He changed it cause the SAG requires you change it in order to avoid confusion.

That's what I said. Read my comment again. He did change it, and it was to avoid confusion, therefore OP is [technically correct](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo)."

Soundtrack is done by Megadeth in the 1990's (when they were still good).

todayilearned,ffhtfkf,t1_ffht1l3,1579953001.0,"I mean he wasn't really wrong. He just didn't mention the SAG.

He did change it to avoid confusion because legally people who join the SAG cannot have the same name as someone else in order to avoid confusion."

If I knew where I got that from then obviously I'd link it, but I can't remember who talked about Warren Buffet except Fact Fiend and I'm at work so I can't just scrub through a video to find a clip."

Probably kids education.

His kids mighta said the same thing, but I do know that they aren't worth nearly as much as their dad. They're CEOs for non-profit organizations, but make less than average for people in the same position.

So he seemed to have raised them pretty good considering."
