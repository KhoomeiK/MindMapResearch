Libertarian,ffj004x,t1_ffizt4h,1579986938.0,Trillions of dollars in student debt is not sustainable. A lot of these politicians wouldn't be coming up with higher education proposals if debt wasn't a big deal to the layman
Libertarian,ffizv7x,t1_ffiw50d,1579986839.0,"I don't care if the wealthy pass on that costs to others. The burden for my proposal is miniscule compared to what Warren and Bernie proposed. 

I'm not making an argument of fairness, ""the rich have to pay!!!"". In this very specific scenario if the rich were taxed and some of those costs passed down to us, I doubt many would actually care considering higher education becomes attainable for some and keeps existing for others. That point isn't really a detriment at all. I think you're still comparing me and my thought process to what liberals will typically say and advocate for. I'm not a liberal. 


>Who pays? The people who can’t avoid the taxes or pass them along, including the intended beneficiaries. Therefore, you have a lot of poor and middle class people subsidizing the education of others. 

Also no, you can't make the same argument for everything regardless of the actual content. The poors burden would be miniscule compared to everyone else. I'm not advocating for a 70% tax on the wealthy. I'm not advocating for a jacked up sales tax. Or a 50% corporate tax."

Libertarian,ffitdhz,t1_ffiraye,1579982236.0,"You'll get far less blowback that trying to forgive student loans to X amount of people making X amount of money because they picked degrees that weren't as lucrative. 


You can still get Federal loans, it just won't be as much as STEM fields. 


And there's also no guarantee that that revoking federal student loans would decrease the cost of higher tuition. Likely it would create a bubble in the private banking sector, keep tuition rates the same and then the bubble pops and a lot of people are fucked. A very good amount of people are fucked. Banks aren't going to scrutinize student loans application nearly as much if the federal government backed out and theirs a cultural push in not just the US but the West for people to seek higher education. 


That's what I meant when I said strictly libertarian solutions could not be applied in today's day and age. If society somehow reset and we got rid all regulations AND companies and started over, sure. But there's a lot of political, cultural and financial intrtacies that come into play that would fuck everyone involved in the short term."
todayilearned,ffik2c4,t1_ffi888p,1579975741.0,"Trump's rise to power was less about peoples reaction to Obamas presidency and more a rise to xenophobia, anti PC culture and white people thinking they'll become extinct.

Libertarian,ffi9khy,t1_ffi7e5w,1579968575.0,"I would pump money into community colleges across the country. And I would make getting a federal loan dependent upon the major. 

If you apply for a federal loan, it has to be in STEM or in teaching. Otherwise you risk not getting a loan or as much of the loan. 

That easily takes care of people defaulting for degrees that aren't lucrative and allows the middle class to grow by putting more lower income into fields they can prosper.
