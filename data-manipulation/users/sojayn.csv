Fully supporting my exes  life dreams. Cool nbd. I kept working on self development, therapy, even hit up codependance anonymous. 

But it was adhd - i used their motivation to guide my daily actions. 

One ex I supported through uni, now works for the UN in conflict management in africa. 

One ex I supported to be a stay at home mother and pursue their karate, meditation  and study now owns a small acreage, has a dojo and is a meditation leader. 

The last ex I supported through leaving the military, getting fired from her first civilian job, starting uni study and im waiting to see how well she does in the future. 

So I was believing and being treated as a codependant person who wasn’t being assertive enough- that’s the NT take on it. 

I now know to my core, that daily I was so overwhelmed as an undiagnosed adhd person that it was a goddamn relief to focus on their needs and I was able to hack all sorts of adhd related issues by that.

No conversation, no consent.

Because I had measured, planned, bought supplies and stalled at that part of the repair job. 

Because i have an OT doing a home visit next week specifically for same. 

Because I have weekly therapy. 

Because I had an adhd coach two years ago when i got diagnosed.
