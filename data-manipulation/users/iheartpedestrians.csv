politics,ffe5jpb,t3_esvwmk,1579837264.0,I legit just went back in my wapo stream to relisten to it. I cannot believe what I just heard. He gives me hope again. Truly a masterclass.

politics,ffe0t5g,t1_ffe0nii,1579833761.0,Oh gawd—don’t even get me started on the cspan callers (and the tons of “walk away Dems” they put on).
politics,ffe02po,t3_esvwmk,1579833230.0,"Here’s what I can’t wrap my head around...


I am not unaware that I have a liberal bias so obviously I will think the Dems are doing a great job. Maybe it’s due to more rational/less emotional thinking, but I cannot put myself in a republican’s shoes while listening to these beautifully laid out FACTS (I didn’t use ‘argument’ here intentionally) and thinking *yup! It was PERFECT! This is a sham witch-hunt!* I just don’t get it. I hate that our country is so polarized. I know the kettle has been simmering and then boiling for decades, but this imposter of a president has the damn thing whistling and screaming with how corrupt politics is now; where people aren’t putting the country above their tribe/money/career and a good chunk of the country doesn’t care because hashtag winning I guess? I just can’t wrap my head around how people who actually watch the Dems presentation could take away anything other than this was a personally motivated scheme and has nothing to do with corruption. *sigh*"
