Brogress,ffczezn,t1_ffby6fj,1579810407.0,"So as I was pretty new to the gym, I found a trainer who offered a 10 session package and trained with him 2/3 times a week for a month. After that I went to him every 2-3 months to check in on progress and get a new routine. 

He took my body fat % and gave diet and general advice. Definitely get a trainer who will help you with diet as it's half the battle. 

The cost will vary depending on where you live. I recommend it if you are new to the gym or not seeing the progress you want."
Brogress,ffcz8cm,t1_ffc3e3d,1579810305.0,"The main thing is eating properly, with a goal in mind (i.e. bulking or cutting). 

Also tracking my lifts and progressively adding weight. In my 20s I just went to the gym and lifted but didn't pay much attention to progression, so didn't see great results. I also ate poorly."
Brogress,ffcz2ss,t1_ffcm7vk,1579810219.0,"Well I went from eating total garbage every day to only eating clean and probably running a 20% calorie deficit. That on top of hitting the gym hard the fat came off fairly fast!

You should be able to lose .5-1lbs per week."
Brogress,ffchza1,t1_ffchr7a,1579799865.0,"Eat 75% of your TDEE in calories with the following macro split: 40% carb, 40% protein, 20% fat. Eat only whole foods, no sugar or processed stuff. You should be able to lose 0.5-1lb a week doing this depending on how high your body fat is currently."
Brogress,ffb4bsg,t1_ffb3ngn,1579751443.0,"Do you know what your body fat range has been? I usually cut down to 8/9% then bulk to 13-15%. 

I definitely feel you on the ""scared to get too small"" front. I was really reluctant to cut after my first bulk, but I did it and it the difference was amazing. With lower body fat you can properly see your muscies, and even if you aren't ""big"" you look more ripped because of the definition. Of course, getting bigger and defined is the end goal but cutting is a necessary part of the process."
Brogress,ffb1t9a,t1_ffb0xya,1579749663.0,"It's tough - but bottom line is if you're not gaining weight, you're not eating enough! Bulking is tough in the beginning but you get the hang of it. 

How have your lifts progressed in the time you have been lifting? You should ideally see a slow, steady increase over time."
Brogress,ffb1muh,t1_ffb1b9r,1579749541.0,"For cutting, aiming for 75% of TDEE in calories with this split: 40% Carbs, 40% Protein, 20% Fat. 

There's a TDEE calculator here: [https://legionathletics.com/tdee-calculator/](https://legionathletics.com/tdee-calculator/)"
Brogress,ffawch4,t1_ffai9qf,1579746007.0,No! That particular mirror in my gym has insanely good lighting.
Brogress,ffaw2gt,t1_ffat97d,1579745823.0,"Well it varies depending on cutting/bulking, but definitely whole food sources are key, so no processed food or added sugar. Then I try to hit specific macro splits depending on my goals. Can share more details if you're interested."
Brogress,ffavwul,t1_ffavp0j,1579745719.0,"Sooo a few people have asked this but I'm not really sure how to answer. You mean 1RM? If so, I don't really do that; just do working sets and progressive overload."
Brogress,ffath0j,t1_ffarf78,1579744106.0,"That's it. It's the same concept as a regular bulk, just slower. The benefit of that is that you gain less fat. The downside is it takes more time. Personally I find it pretty fast to lose fat (it should be for anyone if you know what you're doing), so I prefer to do a regular bulk/cut cycle."
Brogress,ffashbc,t1_ffahzmd,1579743448.0,"I can share the routine, but I HIGHLY recommend reading the book as it provides a lot of necessary background that you need to be successful.

Brogress,ffaizs8,t1_ffaiwaw,1579736896.0,Yeah I find bulking a lot tougher too. 45lbs is a big loss. Congrats!
Brogress,ffaeuoq,t1_ffae7t1,1579734042.0,"Spot on. 

On the left I was basically my worst shape ever. Prior to that I had been in pretty good shape. But getting into a relationship and a shoulder injury basically undid all the work I had done, so was starting from 0 again."

Brogress,ffaekkg,t1_ffa21fi,1579733820.0,"Routine is currently Bigger Leaner Stronger. 

My diet is also 100% based on that book. I really recommend it. It breaks everything down super clearly and gives a really great base to work off. 

I'm currently in a cutting phase, then I'll probably do a mini bulk before the summer, then cut again. And so on... until I die I guess?"
Brogress,ffaedw5,t1_ffa1sl2,1579733672.0,"Do it!!

It took a long time, but totally worth it. My biggest piece of advice is to eat with a specific goal in mind and track your calories. I wasted many years at the gym because I wasn't eating properly."

Then I switched over to the Bigger Leaner Stronger program and have been on that solidly for 18 months or so. I love it!"
Brogress,ffae7a4,t1_ff9u36x,1579733527.0,"Pretty much! After the first pic was taken I started seeing a personal trainer and went on a pretty tight diet and dropped 10 lbs in a few months. Although because I hadn't been working out I was gaining muscle as I lost fat so my weight isn't the best indication. I went from 25% body fat to 11% in around 5 months.  

 After that I did a series of bulking/cutting cycles, gradually adding weight each time. More recent pic I'm around 9% body fat and 205ish lbs."

gaybros,fem1bl9,t1_fel3jen,1579236551.0,"Each individual is fully responsible for their own sexual health. The concept that it's someone's fault for transmitting an STI they didn't know they had is pretty backwards. These things spread just like to common cold. You don't seek to blame people for those things and STIs shouldn't really be any different. If you have sex with someone you're taking some amount of risk even if you use a condom. All STIs can be transmitted orally too. 

So, take care of yourself, get tested regularly and be happy that HIV could be eradicated in our lifetime due to PrEP."
gaybros,fem0sus,t1_fem0bzq,1579236093.0,"Well it's complex and a good question. And I do think that STI rates increase with PrEP (although it's variable). But when you consider the alternative, higher rates of infection with HIV, it's the lesser of two evils. Other STIs are readily treatable now. 

What data doesn't show is that people on prep are the source of those STIs. Conceivably if everyone was on prep and getting tested every three months those infection rates could go down. 

I personally dislike that particular argument because prep is having a net positive effect on sexual health, and there is an inherent undertone of ""slut shaming""."
Mattress,felpvvq,t3_eptnpx,1579228045.0,You could try matress suspenders. But it sounds like the sheet isn't the right size? I had a Tempur pedic hybrid and the sheets stayed on no problem!
gaybros,fekr1pa,t1_fek1z4g,1579205833.0,"(STI - not STD)

One positive aspect of being on PrEP is the regular STI testing required. Where I live it's required to have a full STI screen every 3 months, so any infections are caught and treated quickly. I can only speak from anecdotal experience, but before I was on PrEP I was tested much less frequently. 

In any case: treatable STI is better than HIV infection."

But, you went up and said hi anyway, and he made the choice to be an asshole about it - that's on him. Most people would have made a brief polite conversation.

Mattress,fegr988,t1_fefv5bb,1579100668.0,"Oh ok, in that case I don't recommend it. I think foam mattresses are bad news for hot sleepers. I tried 2 Tempur-Pedics and both were too hot, even the ""Breeze"" one.

ireland,feem00s,t1_feejduk,1579036463.0,"We probably have different gauges of what counts as ""extreme"" - by the way I don't consider it a bad thing, and have nothing against vegans. I actually think it's a very healthy diet (assuming they're not eating a ton of fat - there's plenty of vegan junk food). 

By extreme, I mean that limiting your diet to a small subset of what the average population eats is, to me, extreme. Especially when you get into animal by-product territory, e.g not eating honey. But, each to their own!"
ireland,feeis5t,t1_feehdyn,1579034596.0,"Yea!

ireland,fee1kzd,t3_eomwwk,1579024488.0,"[Moral disengagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_disengagement). For whatever reason, vegans are particularly passionate about animal welfare relative to other forms of welfare (e.g. human suffering due to drug production). Not comparing the two directly, but pro-life ideology has a similar version of moral disengagement, where focus is heavily on welfare of the fetus, vs. welfare of the mother or existing children. It's pretty common with any extreme viewpoint and not much you would be able to do to sway their perspective. My advice: back away slowly."

I read/post to a lot of different subs and haven't really come across so much negativity as there is here. The UK sub is sort of similar in that it's very liberal-leaning in its views, but even then there seems to be less toxicity overall and some actual interesting debates happen, not just downvoting and mud-slinging."
