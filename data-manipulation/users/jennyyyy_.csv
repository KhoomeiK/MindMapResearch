UnresolvedMysteries,fflceka,t1_ffje41i,1580037800.0,"From personal experience working with SAR dogs, I can tell you a well trained dog is very reliable, and it's not even possible for the handler to influence it the way you're suggesting. Which is something only a very ignorant and inexperienced handler would even try to do."
SuicideWatch,ff9z483,t1_ff9uxsc,1579724601.0,"That's exactly the problem. You don't understand. Trying to make your shit posting into some kind of transcendental ""sign"" is nothing short of abusive."
SuicideWatch,ff9q4gf,t3_esep1j,1579718470.0,Posting someting like this is not only stupid but also insensitive and shows a complete lack of understanding of the mechanisms at work in mental health issues.
UnresolvedMysteries,ff78tbs,t1_ff78exa,1579643390.0,"There's usually a lot more to choice of MO than that, like deep seated psychological mechanisms. I believe the FBI has published reports on the subject."

depression,ff74ivz,t3_eruu6o,1579640967.0,"Someone who utters something like that to your face, knowing you're depressed is a sociopath. They are by no means a friend."

depression,ff4r1qr,t3_erf20x,1579570382.0,"I'm totally unimportant. In fact, I hardly even exist. I too have been left like roadkill by those I loved and cared about. Obviously I'm useless and unwanted, unloveable and not even likeable. Just the way it is for some unfortunate people like myself."

SuicideWatch,fezcezo,t3_eqw4e5,1579455927.0,Because it makes them feel good about themselves. It's totally fake and they don't care about you. It's a very selfish behavior.

relationships,fesjpb7,t3_eq81ow,1579365910.0,Dump that sociopath already! You don't want someone as lacking in empathy and basic social skills in your life.
depression,femisc8,t1_fekyxu7,1579257722.0,Some very good advice there.  OP would be better off in a bigger city with access to affordable housing and health care. Also a lot easier to find a job.
SuicideWatch,fejtas3,t1_fej1c78,1579185327.0,The worst disservice you can do to a child is to remain in a dysfunctional relationship.
depression,feirqvi,t3_ep51np,1579145543.0,The world is not going to collapse in 20 years. That¨s what stupid fear mongerers want you to believe so they can tax the shit out of you. Many of those wildfires were not wildfires but arson.  The fires in the Amazonas were due to farmers burning off forest to create more fields for farming. Climate has been changing throughout the history of this planet. You want to kill yourself because of what left wing propaganda? Find a better reason.
SuicideWatch,feirain,t1_feiprj1,1579145227.0,"If you can prove abuse, he can't get custody. If not, leave your son with him and get out of there. Your son will reconnect when older, and understand."
SuicideWatch,feipmtt,t3_epacmb,1579144086.0,"Leave him, get a divorce. If it's that bad you shouldn't even care about who gets what in terms of property and assets. Just get the hell away from him, relocate, start over, even if it means starting with nothing. Like others said, if he is physically abusing you, call the police."
depression,feiedgx,t3_ep7s8c,1579136553.0,"That's a horribly rude thing to say, especially to a co-worker. The person seems socially inept and you shouldn't be bothered by anything they say. Don't allow others to put you down. Being depressed is one thing, but no reason to let others walk all over you. I would probably have lashed out at him."
depression,fec5md4,t1_fear3gu,1578967008.0,Not so. You can never replace a feeling of intrinsic meaning to your own life by helping others. Others do not exist to make you feel better about yourself.
depression,fec2ryp,t3_eo71t2,1578965824.0,Why do you think so many people are obsessed with following all the series on Netflix or where ever? Because their lives are empty and meaningless.
depression,fe6gwtx,t3_enyh4f,1578890543.0,Guess that co-worker is just one of those people who just wants to feel good about themselves but really doesn't give jack shit about you. They are the truly selfish ones.
depression,fe4cv1m,t3_enmoli,1578857977.0,What you're going through is part of growing up. Detaching from family and friends and setting out on your own.
