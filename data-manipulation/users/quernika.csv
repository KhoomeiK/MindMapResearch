aznidentity,ffa0171,t1_fdfei8p,1579725136.0,">The truth is he was being protected. After Cotto he fought a lot of scrubs--Clottey, a washed up Mosley, Margarito after he was caught with plaster in his hand wraps, Rios, Chris fucking Algieri. Marquez was probably his most dangerous opponent in that period. (Bradley is a good fighter, but many people dispute that loss.) His team just felt confident that the fourth fight against Marquez would go the same way as the last three (remember the first was a draw). 

Really disagree here. Arum played him and that Bradley fight made it even worse, that fight was rigged.

It's his and his team's mismanagement. Those people you mentioned, they're not cans or scrubs, Clottey isn't, Mosely was still there and Margo was bigger. Mayweather didn't touch them until people started complaining, also, there weren't any competitive fighters like them so they ARE NOT scrubs. IF you're talking scrubs, compare Mayweather and his rigging, he drained Canelo too didn't he?

> It's the same punches he's been throwing his whole career, yet all of a sudden at 39yrs he gains power. He was doping.

The irony is that Pacqiao rejected Mayweather's first proposal to fight that included drug testing up to the day of the fight. If Pacqiao had demanded drug testing for the fourth Marquez fight, yeah it wouldn't have ended the way it did. So in a sense you're right. You have to understand the sport, not just be a really good fighter. 

It's his naiveness or nature. He could have had a perfect career, but it's not like great isn't bad. It would just help if people, casuals alike, stop accusing him of something that Mayweather started. So, it's his nature to blame and his team's too."
