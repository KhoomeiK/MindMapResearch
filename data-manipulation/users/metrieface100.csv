In a pinch or on a budget that ends up being for me:

Spicy tasty flavour, smokey tasty flavour, salty thing and peppery prickly thing.

Mix and match and don't worry as long as you hit all the points that matter to you :) just remember to try everything in case it turns out to create a new effect. A good example is if you don't like a lot of spice, doesn't mean you won't like a lot of white pepper because of the way it cooks and mingles with them other flavours.

I usually go chilli jam, cumin*, double smoke powder*, grocery store white pepper and salt. 
*I get these two powders from a spice store that sells ground spices and other condiments, really does make a difference when these ingredients have a bit of love put into them.

Basically go find a spice store or move somewhere else :)

Hope I actually helped you with this spam! I just wanted to try share how this sort of meal comes from your heart and YOUR pantry! Sorry if you already get this stuff.

Happy cooking <3"
todayilearned,ffetrzi,t1_ffej6tb,1579865160.0,Yeah so try contacting the author directly. I heard they don't mind sharing it for free.
todayilearned,ffes83m,t1_fferltl,1579863017.0,"Depends, there are plenty of organisations that make a profit providing support for their open source work.

Stuff like business and server software. Sure you could view the source code yourself but how are you going to use and maintain its operation within your situation? Also things like adding features and making changes to suit your needs.

Who better to pay than the people who made it? And if it turns out some other person or group can do a better job with the source then they are the person you want to hire. FOSS allows for the best thing to be made an available to people.

Basically it's some nerd hippy shit and I love it haha :)"

I loved the book but I remember finishing it in the middle of the night and really wanting a smoke.
I was 15 or something and had never smoked before. I love getting that invested in a book, and then its over :("

If they are young, I like the energy at least.

This eternal summer is getting old. Sick of seeing people taking turns throwing shit to see what sticks rather than conversing oh well :("

I imagine they were just curious as to why your reply seemed a bit upset.

The showed you a bit of respect and answered your question, maybe return the favour.

I think you are a Moron.  It pains me to imagine what you must find frustrating in life."
