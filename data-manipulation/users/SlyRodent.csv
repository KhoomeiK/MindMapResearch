AskReddit,ffehet2,t1_fe7k34r,1579848110.0,water fasting actually speeds up your metabolism. Stop lying.
intermittentfasting,ff6cxqy,t3_erw29l,1579624474.0,"Amazing results mate. Really motivational, good job."
loseit,ff5ylqt,t3_eruaud,1579614435.0,Begin intermittent fasting. I've been doing 36/12 meaning i fast for 36h and eat for 12h and I've found that all those urges for snakes are gone. And my addiction to soda has disappeared. This is the best thing you can do.
woooosh,ff5kf99,t3_erqi5g,1579597125.0,You're literally doing the same thing...? After being in this subreddit for a couple months I've realised its just filled with cringe hypocrites. How you gonna talk shit cause they used too many fucking o's english teacher?
facepalm,ff5inhg,t3_ermasq,1579594624.0,Honestly unbelievable the amount of woman hate in the subreddit. So sad to see. I get why some women are terrified of men now.
facepalm,ff5gr6u,t3_erh2ad,1579592159.0,"They're obviously joking, why would you even post this halfwit?"
fasting,ff2wel4,t3_erc5pv,1579526689.0,"You dont need to drink so much water. In fact drinking a lot causes you to urinate more which means more minerals leave your body via urine. Drink when you feel like it. The whole ""8 glasses a day"" is bullshit marketing. Your body knows when it needs water, and when it doesn't it'll tell you (thirst)."
DecidingToBeBetter,fezkixk,t1_feygc0f,1579458273.0,Why? I aint trying to piss the bed.
facepalm,fex71in,t1_feshubk,1579425706.0,I downvoted just cause ur stupid. Humans can thrive without consuming meat. If you're going to make a witty joke make sure it makes sense from a scientific stand point.
EntitledBitch,fewhexx,t3_eqgwln,1579410624.0,Its kinda hot that his wife bosses him around but this is messed up. At the same time its his fault for getting that awful tattoo and not realising her request is absolute bs. He can do better.
fasting,fewgsys,t3_eqormw,1579410340.0,"Dont compare yourself to others on here. 24h/A whole fucking day is an achievement. Fasting is like a muscle imho, the more you do it the easier it gets."
LivestreamFail,fecjof2,t3_eofcik,1578975551.0,And the plot thickens. Thank God for twitch drama baby :)
