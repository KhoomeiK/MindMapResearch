OnlineDating,ffqmst7,t1_ffqgram,1580138745.0,What she is saying is helpful insight however you are getting defensive about it. Is this how you mostly interact with women when they share opinions? Examine that. You may be putting out a vibe without realizing it.

90DayFiance,ffdpyy8,t1_ffdn74y,1579826172.0,I highly doubt she tried to hide she was into materialistic things. He made promises he didn’t intend to keep to get her to come to his country.
90DayFiance,ffdpptt,t1_ffdnf6p,1579826012.0,I would too if someone told me to leave behind all my nice clothes and he would just buy me new ones and was taken to a second hand shop. It would have probably cost the same to ship the clothes she had and moved rather than buying a whole new wardrobe at a thrift store. This is coming from a woman that loves second hand stores and rarely shops outside of clearance racks.

dating,ffb1m5s,t1_ffb0k6r,1579749529.0,I don’t live in a huge city but I feel the reason I was able to find my boyfriend so quick was I have a lot of male friends (that I adore) and realized they are not the type of men that spam women’s inboxes nightly. So if I wanted to meet men at their quality I would have to make the first move. I was right.
90DayFiance,ffb1227,t3_esj1ma,1579749155.0,"He told her to leave her nice clothes behind then took her to a thrift store. How is she a gold digger? Oh, she wanted a phone after leaving behind everyone she knows! The audacity of her!"

dating,ffazcti,t1_ffay784,1579748002.0,"I found him on OKCupid a year ago. His profile was well written and witty so I liked and send a message commenting on things regarding his profile. What is funny is I was 1 year outside of his age range he put so I probably would have not come up in his swipes. 

He messaged me back next morning and we decided to go on a date after work. I had 3 other dates lined up that week but decided to go ahead and squeeze him in because conversation was nice. Date went so well the next morning I canceled my other dates to make time to get to know him and froze my accounts. I figured at minimum I just met someone who could possibly be my best friend and he would fit right in with my social circle (we are a bunch of nerds) so felt I needed to invest time into him with no distractions. 

We have been together a little over a year now and his best friend is fully integrated into my social circle and it’s like we have all known each other for many years rather than months. We plan to move in together soon. Never thought I could love anyone so much."

My boyfriend is an introvert that rather stay home and play video games than go out. I am a social butterfly with a very active and large friend group. He knows how to be present and is very funny when we go out. It did take a while for him to communicate when his battery is getting low though."

dating,feie68n,t1_fei3d54,1579136417.0,I don’t have children but have heard from many women that their husbands don’t take initiative to lessen the load on their wives and the women end up taking the majority of childcare responsibilities. Babies take up a lot of time. My husband would need to do extra to make time for me to go to the gym. Making comments about my weight would not be helpful either.

dating,fehvua8,t1_fehr2do,1579124884.0,I don’t disagree however the expectation that women can immediately jump right back to the gym after popping a kid out is unrealistic. You get noooooo sleep when taking care of a newborn.
dating,fehvfmm,t1_fehmslh,1579124653.0,I am less concerned about being ABLE to lose with weight it is the speed of losing the weight or getting hurtful comments from my partner rather than support is the concern.
dating,feh2e95,t3_ep40pd,1579107714.0,I am a woman that cares about her weight and I workout frequently. I pass on men that specifically say that is important to them because I fear if down the road when we have children that his expectations are unrealistic regarding losing baby weight.

With that being said, I take a HARD PASS on men looking for a “traditional woman”. I have a great career and not willing to give it up or have a partner that doesn’t participate equally in domestic labor."
dating,fdeu1nn,t1_fdesubq,1578346600.0,Oh no. I flat out told him prior to our first date I want marriage and kids within 5 years. I don’t want pregnancy after 40.

dating,fderojt,t1_fdeps2n,1578345196.0,"I was on dating apps less than 2mo before I found my boyfriend. My ex husband didn’t cheat, neither did I. Just 2 people who where together 8 years longer than we should have been because we get along despite our life goals not matching. I want kids, he doesn’t.

I disagree about women losing their looks faster than men. Men don’t take care of their skin and most 40 year olds look 55 while I still look like I am in my early 20s. Looks matter more than they used to because women are also in the workforce and don’t need a man’s income to live comfortably anymore. As a matter of fact, more and more women are choosing to stay single due to the inequality in domestic labor many cohabitating situations face. A lot of men don’t have high standards when it comes to cleanliness of the home."
