This has been happening for decades, we try to get rid of people who do us wrong and all it does is piss off and unite our enemies.  There is peaceful deescalation and there is the violent path.  Which one did we pick?  Why don't we kill every person labelled a terrorist or dictator?  Why don't we kill Kim Jong-Un or Erdogan?  Are YOU going to defend them saying they weren't enemies of peace or the American people?  Of course you won't, but again, it's clear to see how it would only lead to further violence.

We use to be a lot better than them but we are certainly getting to what you just described.  There are *plenty* of Americans who will act violently in the name of Trump and God, and that's not by accident.  Paula White works for the white house for crying out loud. Trump supporters are cult-like and religiously radicalized.  Trump acts like a dictator doing whatever he wants based on personal whim.  

A lot of people are rightly getting upset seeing Americans defend Iran and Soleimani, but no one is *actually* defending them.  Just comparing our actions to theirs and saying, ""we're not acting much better than them, even though we should be.""  

Iran is not the shining beacon of moral righteousness but America is not acting like the good guys here."
