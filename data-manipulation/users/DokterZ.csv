Whatever you think of his NBA career, he was best served by staying in college, rather than departing at any earlier date - even a year early would have likely hurt him moneywise.   

I would argue that it isn't about getting fair compensation at all - it is about getting maximum compensation.   If you are guaranteed an early 1st round pick, you almost have to go.  But if you are headed to the ~~D~~ G league, or an undrafted free agent, you may be better served to develop your game, or frankly, choose a major that pays well."
