Ich drück dir die Daumen! Der Anwalt wird eh erstmal ein Schreiben aufsetzen, Forderungen stellen und Fristen setzen. Sowas kann auch schon Wunder wirken."
FragReddit,fdsiqoe,t3_emwv8u,1578703524.0,"Ich kenne mich leider nicht aus, wie weit die Rechtsberatung der Uni geht. Aber jeder hat die Möglichkeit sich einen Schein für ein kostenloses Beratungsgespräch für einen Anwalt seiner Wahl zu holen. Gibt es glaube bei der Stadt, kostet aber 15€ oder so. Wenn der Anwalt rechtliche Schritte für nötig/sinnvoll hält, kannst du Prozesskostenbeihilfe beantragen. Da du Student bist, nehme ich mal an, dass du nicht viel Geld hast, entsprechend sollte das problemlos durchgehen und du bekommst die Kosten bezahlt. Ich habe vor vielen Jahren mal jemanden verklagt, das ganze hat bis auf den Beratungsschein nichts gekostet. 

Wie gesagt, ich hab keine Ahnung, ob du die Info brauchst, aber wollte das gern geschrieben haben, falls es für dich (oder andere in ähnlichen Situationen) relevant sein könnte."

Die haben meine Mail also nicht mal richtig gelesen. Ich hatte eindeutig klar gemacht, dass ich diese Zeitungen nicht will und mich davon sehr belästigt fühle. Hatte sogar angedroht, denen die gesammelten Zeitungen vors Büro zu kippen.

She woke me up and I was so sleep drunken and confused I didn't understand what was going on. I thought, she just woke me up for school and she is so nervous and angry because I was a bit late. It was hard for her to get me out of the bed. This happened on the 5th floor of a concrete building while the basement was burning and it was already dangerous because the stairwell was full of smoke and started to push into our flat. Imagine what would have happened, if it was just a small (maybe wooden) house. I could have killed us with my confusion."

I saw the photo of a really nice woman and clicked on her profile, which was amazing. On this platform, you could answer some questions. One was about the sense of life, she answered with ""42"". I clicked the like button but didn't message her, because she was way out of my league. I didn't even think about she could see my like. But she did and PMed me. We chatted for hours every day, after some days we started to phone every evening for hours. One week after our first chat she visited me and it clicked so hard, we couldn't let go when she had to drive back home in the evening. So she invited me to spend the night together at her place. I fell in love like I never did before, it was like we already knew each other for years.  I have never believed in something like soulmates, but if we weren't I don't know what it was. Unfortunately, it didn't last for much longer than a year because both of us had serious issues. Still missing her."

vegan,fbyt4yq,t1_fbyqyrt,1577225631.0,"I live in Thuringia (in the middle of Germany). Meat, especially the ""Thüringer Bratwurst"" is part of the identity here. Just like beer and bread. In Germany the meat and dairy industries are really strong, they have a lot of power and politicians like to make it more easy to make the animal fit in the industry and not the other way around. On the other side veganism is getting bigger and bigger and I learned to know lots of new people who are vegan and still do. So it's difficult. In my area in the city we are far away from vegan restaurants at every corner like it seems to be in Berlin for example. But it gets easier. We are growing even if there is big resistance. 
I'm very proud to say in Germany there is a meat company changing their products to vegetarian and vegan. They already have a facility that is meat free and they canceled their first meat product (Currywurst) . They plan to be fully vegan. ATM already 40% of their sales are from vegetarian and vegan stuff.  That's nice to see."

If you took a shit that was alone time of course, but everything else didn't matter. Going to pee while our father was in the shower, bathing together or using the same bathing water after one another when we got older or changing clothes in front of each other, everything okay. I don't get people who are embarrassed of seeing their kids or parents naked in normal situations. Of course I don't want to see my mother while having sex, hell no! But where is the problem with talking to each other and one changes a shirt or pants? I mean what do you fear? Growing up your children in the believe, their bodies are nothing to be ashamed of? That they or you are not a pervert for seeing each other naked? Or do you really believe the father would immediatly fuck his own children, you sick fuck? And why did you even married your partner, if you believe he would do such horrible things? Do you know those poeple who are not able to use the bathroom with their partners, no matter what they are doing in bed together, who are loosing their shit when the partner farts in front of them? That's the kind of people you get by bitching about a father taking a bath with his little children.
