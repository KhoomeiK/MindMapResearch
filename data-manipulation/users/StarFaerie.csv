weddingshaming,ff489yc,t1_ff461dy,1579557704.0,"In 2009 Benedict changed the canonical law in relation to marriage. It used to not apply to baptised Catholics who had formally renounced their religion but he decided that marriage is special and so once someone is baptised Catholic they are counted in for life for that part.

Yes, Catholics can marry a non Catholic (called a mixed marriage) but they need special dispensation and many rules like you listed.

So for a marriage to be valid it must have no baptised Catholics (as Canon law does not apply to non-Catholics), 2 baptised Cathoilics and be held in a church with no special circumstances (e.g. prior marriage), or in any other circumstances must have special dispensation from a bishop. And Catholics are only supposed to attend valid weddings.

And unfortunately Benedict decided it wasn't enough to merely formally leave the church anymore, so now they are stuck for life. 

They are technically right and isn't that the best kind of right. /s"
weddingshaming,ff3xu1h,t3_erh749,1579551212.0,"There is a lot of bad information here about Canon law. Just because people haven't heard of a law of the Catholic Church, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

The big questions is: were either of you brought up Catholic? If the answer to this is yes, for this to be a valid marriage to a Catholic you need either get a dispensation from your bishop. Catholics are not supposed to attend non-valid marriages.

So the priest is probably right and here we get the problem.

Although I disagree with them entirely, in their minds, this is a choice between sinning against God and hurting their child. For many religious people, this is just an awful choice to make. Think Abraham and Isaac where Abraham offered up his son as a sacrifice to God. This is often used to show God must be first always.

There is a logic to it, if you take the bible and Canon Law as the sole basis for your moral and ethical code. It's internally consistent.

You won't win this unfortunately. You can't. Don't force them to come, let them decide. You are fighting against their beliefs, but that doesn't mean you have allow their behaviours to have no consequences or to allow their religious beliefs to continue to hurt you. You can choose is how you want to react to it and how much you want them and their religion in your and your family's lives going forward. 

I'm really sorry you are dealing with this.


ETA: for those Catholics who haven't heard of this, there are many levels of devoutness between Catholic churches and Catholic sects (Yes there are sects of Catholicism).

Showerthoughts,ff3tzmf,t1_ff33exh,1579548811.0,"They are very shy animals that spend most of their time in the water or in their burrows and most are only active at dusk, dawn and overnight. They are quite small so have a lot of predators and mostly stay out of sight. I've only seen one in the wild. They look for food at the bottom of the water so dive up and down a lot. The tail is not like a beaver's tail and not for propulsion. They have little electrical sensitive areas around their bill to allow them to find their food by touch rather than sight or sound.

I'm not sure anyone knows how smart they are. They don't do well in captivity due to some adaptations and don't seem to be friendly animals, but they aren't aggressive either. They just do their own thing. I doubt they are terribly smart but they avoid contact so I don't think we'll ever know.

Edit: I'm going to add something to the smartness. Some animals it's easy to tell their intelligence. Eg Kangaroos are dumb as a box of hammers. Brushtailed possums are really very smart and will find a way to get your food if possible.

With some other animals it's really hard to tell. They just live their lives and do what they do away from people. Platypuses are like this. They need to spend half the day looking for food so they don't really do much else and don't interact with us if they can help it.

Throwaway because my sister’s friends follow my other account.

My older sister has always been my best friend. I love her dearly, so when she announced she was engaged, I was so excited for her. The planning started and the wedding is coming up in the next few months.

I am home now for winter break and she tells me that unless I want to be uninvited from her wedding, I would need to cut my hair at least to my jawline. This came as an absolute shock to me.

My hair has always been my prized possession and everyone in my immediate family knows this. It reaches to the top of my bra line and is currently colored brown (I’m naturally dark haired, but I like to color it). I keep it trim and try to keep it as healthy as possible. Besides the coloring, I don’t do anything to it. I would say my hair is pretty healthy and shiny.

I told my sister if maybe we could compromise on me changing back to my natural color, because it’s very bland and I won’t stand out. She said that wouldn’t cut it.

My sister knows how much I love my hair, and hate cutting it besides the get the dead ends. I’ve told her multiple times. She told me that she wanted all her bride’s maids to look uniform and I’m the only one that will have long hair. She then said that if I tried to weasel out of cutting my hair by dropping being a bride’s maid then she would uninvite me, because I wasn’t serious enough.

I won’t lie. I cried. That was extremely hurtful to me that she would make these ultimatums. I’ve helped plan a lot of her wedding, made the 4hrs trek from my college back home many times to help her with prep, have offered to help all throughout the wedding. I just feel so upset now.

I don’t know if I can go through with cutting my hair. A lot of people might say it’s just hair, it’ll grow back, but I have a lot of anxiety around my hair. Not to get too deep into it, but I used to be extremely depressed years back and my hair always felt like the last thing anyone could force me to change. It was a comfort and it always has been. Everyone in my family knows this. This feels like a slap in the face.

I want to be there for my sister because I love her, but I don’t know if I should go through with this or not. I haven’t spoken to our parents yet and my sister hasn’t texted or called me back since that conversation.

Please, wise Reddit users, I need help. Should I go through with cutting my hair? I don’t even know if I want to go to the wedding anymore... I’m just hurting all around. Any advice to talk to my sister or my parents about this would mean the absolute world to me. Thank you.

TL;DR - My sister says I can’t come to her wedding unless I cut most of my hair off. I have a lot of anxieties around cutting my hair. Everyone in my family is aware of this."

amibeingdetained,fdtem9q,t1_fdsd562,1578715654.0,It doesn't work that way. The treaty prevents the US from just revoking their citizenship unless they have another one in a recognised country and you can't force another country to take them even if that's what they want. They are the US's idiots and you are stuck with them.
AmItheAsshole,fds9i6q,t1_fdrofvo,1578697450.0,"No they do it with a blood test now as there is foetal DNA in the mother's blood but it is very expensive (about $2,000) and can't be done before about 9 weeks. So she'd have to wait to have her abortion, have a blood test and someone would have to pay a lot of money for no real benefit."

It's wonderful that this works for her currently however research has shown that not using DMDs increases your chance of transitioning to secondary progressive and at an earlier time. So I'll keep on with treatment and use diet and exercise as a secondary thanks."

My basic breakfast is muesli and yoghurt. Can't go wrong there. Fiber, protein, calcium and energy. Great start to the day."

These fires just aren't like our usual ones. They are like nothing the firefighters have ever seen before. 3 years of drought and record temperatures plus a late monsoon season are adding up to a disaster that will not be recovered from quickly and in some cases, not at all."
worldnews,fdgjzhg,t1_fdgh3n1,1578399830.0,"Different area of Australia. Think New York v Arizona. The camels have no natural predators here so if we don't cull them occasionally, they eat everything and soil the water until they starve to death and so do all the other animals. This is much kinder than starvation.

On the other hand, if you want 10,000 camels come over, catch them and take them away. Then both our problems will be solved, except what we do with the other million camels (Do you need more camels?)"

The only person I've ever seen complain about mobile phones at the table is my mother and she's too old to be a boomer (Plus she's just a bitch in general).

If you want Australia to stay out of Iran, tell the US to stop war mongering, or not to ask us to join. If they ask, our government almost always replies positively.

We are a huge country. Only the south east is on fire. The north west is about to get hit by a cyclone. Most of our Defence Forces aren't being used in the fires. After all, the fires don't need to have a no fly zone enforced or be bombed with anything other than water. Plus they'll be posturing over this for months to come. I doubt the call will come for another 3 months at least and be then the worst should be over."
