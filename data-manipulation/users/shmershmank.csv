SuicideWatch,fepoh4e,t3_eqcijf,1579326086.0,"Thanks for getting it out, the worst thing is to keep it all in. Sorry if this sounds crappy but at least you and your GF have each other, I'm sure at least one of you can find work and hopefully even keep the apt. Keep up the good fight!"
SuicideWatch,fechdyu,t3_eofsto,1578973966.0,"No offense but going back to the hospital is exactly the right move. I think you might just be a bit confused at the moment and being with medical professionals will help. Please dial emergency services, best wishes!"
SuicideWatch,fecfv0z,t3_eofkum,1578972918.0,"Don't be sorry about anything and thank you for talking to your counselor, they will give you great advice. Best of luck!"
SuicideWatch,fecbnr3,t3_eof0ba,1578970248.0,Sorry but all of it. I guarantee there is someone out there who can and does love you rn and cares about you.
SuicideWatch,fe6895g,t1_fe67afm,1578883955.0,Have you ever tried writing it out until there's nothing left? Feel free to try now
SuicideWatch,fe5xacp,t3_enwjzr,1578877006.0,"Reaching out for help is not pathetically begging for attention, it's just reaching out for help. Thanks for posting here and if you don't mind me saying it sounds like you need to vent a bit more, care to share?"
SuicideWatch,fe04q7s,t3_enisj1,1578803026.0,"My guess is that it's about a step away from being suicidal, although probably depression at this point. It's tough to deal with sometimes but keeping busy does help as does talking about this stuff irl. Good luck and feel better."
SuicideWatch,fe00a53,t1_fdzzww7,1578799983.0,Shit man that really sucks. Do you have other family?
SuicideWatch,fdzzud6,t1_fdzzrln,1578799707.0,"Wow that's a long time, is that when things went South with your so?"
SuicideWatch,fdzzokt,t3_eni5kf,1578799616.0,"Really sorry you're feeling this way, if I can ask how long have you felt like this? Is it something new?"
SuicideWatch,fd6wv0y,t1_fd6w98m,1578196735.0,Fair enough I can't tell you what to do. Btw tho did you talk to anyone before tonight? No judgements just curious
SuicideWatch,fd6u7ak,t3_ek7f7i,1578195766.0,Don't know how but I just want to say I'm sorry you hurt. Best wishes friend and if you want to talk I'm here.
SuicideWatch,fd6u0b7,t3_ek7cly,1578195694.0,Sorry but no one here will tell you how to do it just that we know what it's like to hurt and that if you want to talk we're here. I hope you decide against it in the end and best wishes.
SuicideWatch,fd0bvr4,t3_ejsi0t,1578116625.0,"Whatever works man, glad you decided against it, best wishes!"
SuicideWatch,fcywdwl,t3_ejm8sn,1578088541.0,"I'm really sorry you're feeling like this, many people on this sub have been there so we all really do know what it's like. How long since you and your partner split? Sorry if that is too personal but perhaps the grief makes it hard to remember how good you once felt? No judements from me btw I felt very similarly at 18. Sending good vibes your way, I hope things get better for you."
SuicideWatch,fcl8mmr,t3_ehsio5,1577742180.0,"Yup, I was waiting to do my plan until after they passed. Don't mean to sound preachy but I decided not to do it after enough time had passed and I eventually figured out how to live with my PTSD and depression and feel content. Hope you get there one day, best wishes OP"
SuicideWatch,fcidd5x,t1_fci8q5p,1577660869.0,"Thank you for sharing, that takes a lot of guts. Sorry to ask but why do you think you're too anxious to try to make plans with people for Nye? Sorry to sound like I'm accusing but you said you're not quite sure why that may be, has anything other than your medication changed recently?"
SuicideWatch,fci67iv,t3_ehc88t,1577658231.0,"I'm sorry to hear about all this, you said you usually don't feel this way but it is the new medication that's possibly brought on the change. Perhaps tell your psychiatrist what's going on, I'm sure the medication isn't supposed to do that. Other than that I would only say please do try to spend time with others on NYE if that's what you want to do. Also, please do post the whole situation, perhaps someone has been through something similar before and can offer better guidance. I hope you feel better."
SuicideWatch,fcaxxgz,t3_egyljr,1577578801.0,"It sounds like you've seen some tough times, I'm so sorry for everything you're going through. Sorry if this a silly question but have you told your husband what's going on? I don't mean to sound preachy but I'm sure he loves you deeply and wouldn't want to be with anyone else. Other than that have you reached out to a therapist? A mental health professional wouldn't judge you at all and will be able to tell you exactly how to feel better. I hope things improve, best wishes."
