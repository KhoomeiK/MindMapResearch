Gunpla,fdcqi2g,t1_fdcks19,1578281511.0,"Yeah.  Definitely I agree on this.  The only reason I splurged on this was I just inherited enough from the unfortunate passing of my Wife's mom.  

But the cheapest I ever seen it brand new was $250 at a Hobbytown in Knoxville, TN.  My local one had it for $305.  But I would go for a PG if I had looked back on this.  But I also wanted one of the Grail units."
Gunpla,fdcki6s,t1_fdaticq,1578277162.0,"Phone and autocorrect.   I been letting autocorrect do it and haven't noticed till you said something.

That's the exact set I got."
Gunpla,fdck6gh,t1_fdbx2gp,1578276929.0,"Ok.  The 1/144 literally came with 1 sticker. The eyes. Of the MS itself.  All I have done is via secondary stickers I bought on Ebay. 

And for complexity.  It may look huge, come a PG box, but when I actually sat down to do it.  Took me about 6 hours.  That doesn't count the MS just the Armor.  The claws needed a few good wacks to get into alignment, but the whole thing is made of heavy plastic.   There are 3 metal plates in the center of the main unit to hold it together.  So beyond a lot of screws.  60+ if I remember it's the standard HG in all senses.

As for correcting it actually has the suggested color guide in the back of the book.  And it actually is a book."
Gunpla,fdcju1p,t1_fdcdxwo,1578276682.0,Yup.  I actually need to spend the time and put them all up. X.x

Gunpla,fda4yyi,t1_fd8rk7r,1578241744.0,"Had that happen to my MG Psychozaku [rest it bits GF knocked it off a shelf last month] and it was missing the runner to the SECOND instruction.   It taught me to  count my runners.   Luckily I was able to get a replacement via amazon.  

I did keep all the extra weapons to the first one before sending it back.


Also just now found my Rg Nu is missing a key piece for the shoulder armors.  I COULD finish it without this one. But doesn't feel right.  So gonna pick up another kit to hold onto for a possible kitbash soon."
Gunpla,fd8q2eb,t1_fd8pgxz,1578221671.0,"It is not worried.  Just saw a possible chance if your willing and able. So if you can't find them don't fret.


But yeah it was weird with mine. A full plastic wrapped box.  Got mine finished and went to do the decals and just 100% no where to be found."
Gunpla,fd8a5h1,t3_ek9ip4,1578215773.0,Are you going to do the decals?  I am asking simply if you are not: mine did not come with his.....  would you be willing to let me have them?
sheridanwyoming,fd6zl1u,t1_fd6ku9q,1578197661.0,"No. I agree.  I am working closely with her.     She has agreed to goto her school councilor when going back.    When she does I plan to call local and state police.  


But she doesn't know that in 2 weeks if she hasn't by then I plan to anyway...


And start raising the biggest fuse I can.  And if I must I will call Sheridan, Casper, and All other large newspapers.  I am not letting this go."

oddlyterrifying,fcxmj5k,t1_fcwxewj,1578066509.0,My exact words to myself.
Gunpla,fcxgbaq,t3_ejfe5q,1578062188.0,Careful with this one.   The center torso has zero flexibility and I accidently popped it.  So when posing be careful.
Gunpla,fcxen3m,t1_fcx82gv,1578060915.0,That's what I thought.  But wanted to be sure.  Thanks!

I normally like having my MS having it counter part with mine.  The FULL armor would be fun; if not for my girlfriend not accidentally knocking my Psychozaku off its display shelf.  And a six foot drop did not trear it kindly."
