Also, deep conditioner is different from regular conditioner in that you only use it like once a week, but you leave it in your hair for a longer period of time before washing it out."

mildlyinteresting,ff8hcz0,t1_ff8c23n,1579678542.0,"Chemotherapy usually targets cells with the fastest rate of mitosis (cell reproduction). Cancer cells duplicate very quickly, but so do the cells in hair, fingernails, testicles, and ""high-traffic"" areas of skin (elbows, knuckles, etc). This inadvertently causes damage to those good cells, which causes the discoloration and loss of hair/nails.
