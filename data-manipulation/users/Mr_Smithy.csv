The system looks solid, but why would you choose an example client who's business was selling a service that obviously was going against Instagram's terms & services? I'm not saying a person should or shouldn't; but the campaign was less for a niche service, rather a loophole service. The money was still made when it could, but the example seems it should at minimum have an * next to it."
