Against it. Why not just enact a law/process that once a death certificate is filed it is sent to the appropriate authorities and those persons are removed? Also I have no idea why you make an exception for presidential elections?

Making it harder to vote i.e. making everyone re-register every 8 years, is a core Republican value. Disenfranchise the electorate. 

If you are worried about protecting the democratic process you should be worried about the Republicans refusing to enact security measures to protect elections from foreign powers, Republican Brian Kemp as the secretary of state for Georgia overseeing the election for Governor of GA while running for Governor of GA and GA destroying ballots after a lawsuit was filed for a recount (defying a judge's order to turn over the ballots).
