Maybe they don't want to talk in detail about the trauma but even something like ""I was abused by my mother"" or ""I was assaulted by a friend"". Him facing his trauma and feeling like he can share even tiny amounts of it with her is necessary for this to work, exactly like you said with the breakdowns in your 30s/ kids etc. You have to know them as fully as you can and they can't just exist in this terrible state of having serious issues without facing them at all. 

My dad had severe childhood trauma that my mom still had no idea about 25 years into marriage, which obviously negatively affected her, as well as myself and my brother, quite massively so.

Thank fuck he understands. Affection, connection, love triggers the childlike version. Also extreme stress, as a form of regression. It's funny, because the way I regress is not like the way I was as a child. I think that actually may have a part in why I do it, because I was not afforded the luxury of feeling like a child for long. 

It's not the same as what you're going through, but I take lamotrigine as well and it definitely curbed it a lot. I mostly hang out in my adult self now, and the most important thing is that I am able to maintain my adult self in stress. It was very damaging to me to not be able to handle anything, my SO had to have many conversations with me that I needed to be ""adult me"" when I was going through things, in my life or in my relationship. Now he doesn't have to worry about me anymore because adult me is entirely capable of handling nearly anything thrown at me, as I have for my entire chaotic life, unfortunately, been ""adult me"", as a means of survival. 

I think it's understandable and fair that we use unusual forms of coping as what we experience is very unusual compared to neurotypical people. It's just making sure that it's positively affecting us and not negatively affecting us. You're not crazy, you're just doing what you need to in order to be okay. Can't knock anyone for that."
BipolarReddit,feptnz5,t1_fep5f72,1579330898.0,"My heart really goes out to you. A lot of us have duality issues that extend beyond our moods. The mood changes definitely don't help that. I felt really isolated and the conflicting feelings and personality traits really dominated me until I was able to find a handful of people that actually appreciated my diverse experiences, even if it meant really being friends/SO with ""2 different people"". It's really important to try and put yourself into an accepting environment. You shifted from two extremes that disapprove of the other side of you. It doesn't have to be physical places, but I'm sure it could help to be somewhere where people don't have as much disdain, socially/culturally speaking.

As isolating as it may be, always remember that your life has been enriched by the diversity of your experiences. You can have empathy for so many people because you can have a level of experience that most people don't have. Until you can find others who appreciate that in you, try your best to appreciate it within yourself.

So I upped my game and then my skin became a battle trying to find the right products to do what my simple routine was already doing. NO SHADE to people who have complicated routines there are people that need it. But I was encouraged to consume more products for the sake of consuming them with these influences and I spent so much money and gathered so much waste that I didn't need to. I really think emphasizing being conscious about the environmental aspect as being as important or even moreso than trying a thousand products, or feeling like you require 15 in your arsenal, is seriously important.

Shelfies are a little more understandable because they can talk about the products but I also think it's a little ridiculous. I'm only going on this rant because I think this is an appropriate place to vent concerns about the sub. The ""look what I bought look what I have look look look"" culture is really disappointing content and it's made me consider leaving the sub.

Alcohol, caffeine, and weed are all pretty common drugs that can affect us a lot differently than the average person. I would just say to be very aware of your mood while you are smoking, give yourself some time off it and see if your quality of life improves (if it's better with weed - that's ok). Just be very attentive to how it's affecting you and make sure it's not triggering depressive episodes, paranoia, or it's not turning into a substance abuse issue (again, a lot of people who are bipolar struggle with this). I think it can be healthy but it can also be very unhealthy. Being mindful of the fact that it can be bad for you, and look out for yourself. Also if you have trusted friends or a SO that can pay attention to your mood helps. Well, that helps in general, not just with experimenting with drugs. 

For me personally, I can depend on it way too much and make it a crutch. However it can be helpful in certain cases. If you use it a lot it will be very hard to sleep when you don't have it, that was my problem, I needed it to sleep or to relax. I also craved being high in general and being out of my mindset. Over the \~10 yrs I've been using cannabis, with instances of using it super heavily and instances of not using it at all, I've found that like anything, moderation is key. I occasionally smoke as either a treat to myself, if I get exceptionally anxious and need to give myself a break, or if I have a particularly bad chronic pain day. A couple of times a month. Prevents me from having any long term issues associated with cannabis use (like I mentioned before, difficulty sleeping without it for example) and I still get to enjoy it's benefits. Heavy use kept me in a depressive episode multiple times in my life. I had to be honest with myself about that and moderate my use. If you can do that then you'll be okay."

That's not to say that you can't get married in the future - but if he means what he says and counseling goes well, the wedding is back on. Don't tell anyone your reasoning, just that you talked and have some stuff you want to get in order before proceeding. I'd threaten to call the wedding off if he breaks the silence agreement and defies your trust. What is happening here isn't a MIL problem. It's a him problem. He doesn't have your back. That's why you need to resolve this before marriage. You need to make sure your relationship can withstand a lifelong commitment."
