dndmemes,ffcjcew,t1_ffchrkz,1579800694.0,That’s a good idea. The other option is roll behind the screen and give him like a -10 penalty.

dndmemes,ffcfgjp,t3_esrfkz,1579798319.0,This made me think... is it possible to buy a loaded die that is loaded towards 1? Like make a cursed NPC that rolls with a loaded die towards terrible rolls...

politics,ff8wt3f,t3_es7nv7,1579698670.0,That’s my (former) senator! I was devastated when she lost. Josh Hawley literally ran on a platform of “pro trump” and won. Man do I hate Missouri.

politics,ff5c1ct,t1_ff3jgim,1579586770.0,"Just want to add to this. It’s VERY hard to leave this circle of brainwashing. I grew up in a very conservative family. My grandparents have Fox News on 24/7. My parents don’t read or watch news very often, but are still pretty locked into republican views. 

For me, It took going to bible college, learning about what Jesus actually stood for, and learning that the early church was very close to socialist, that snapped me out of it all. I was VERY against Obama his first time running. Semi supportive his second time (didn’t register in time to vote) and then voted for Hillary this past election. 

My grandparents  hardly talk to my wife and I outside family gatherings. My crazy Missouri family calls me a brainwashed city slicker libtard, all because I got out of their circle of thinking and challenged myself to think critically. I am almost excommunicated from my family just because my political views are different. If you aren’t willing to give that up, you just tow the line. It’s messed up."

I’ve experienced it enough that I can usually tell I’m getting to the end of my rope a couple days before. 

Her counselor is amazing and is ok if I tag along in those extra meetings knowing it’s making my wife feel better."

todayilearned,fenkc59,t1_fen5jc4,1579286537.0,"Thanks man. The likelihood I have mad cow is so small that it’s really just letting me give blood and donate my organs when I die. If I have mad cow, at least I would know."
todayilearned,fen40mi,t1_fempro9,1579276479.0,I’ve been told by my doc (in the US) that I can’t sign up. She is now monitoring some new tests that are benign developed and letting me know about them when I see her.
todayilearned,felcnga,t3_eppa70,1579219052.0,"Curious question, does the law have a clause for people who can’t be? I can’t be a blood or organ donor because I “might have mad cow disease” from when my family was deployed to Turkey in the early 90’s. As far as I know, there isn’t a test for it."

battlemaps,fdsxxbc,t1_fdsvznc,1578709385.0,"Always good advice. I wrote a ton of backstory with kingdoms and political parties. They have freedom to make choices between the king or the long lost illegitimate  bloodline of the royal family. It’s been good so far. 

They have only burnt down one town so far"

battlemaps,fds25n0,t3_emxtfp,1578693200.0," Additional information. 

I use photoshop to run the map. I made the dungeon as a 4K file, and the TV is 720p. 

Then I put a layer of grey over the whole map, only showing the opening of the cave. Then I use the eraser tool to remove the grey layer. The size is the same as 60ft because everyone has darkvision. Turns out great! I also have tiles as “traps” that when they hit them, I can enable the trap and it shows up on the tv."
AskReddit,fdqnr2o,t1_fdqbkkn,1578670981.0,Adidas was my choice of boot when I played soccer. Then it became my choice of normal shoes. In college I just stopped buying any puma or nike clothes because adidas matched my shoes.

They were being threatened by a NPC of a PC’s backstory. That NPC was making and selling magical drugs and the party found out by luck about 5 sessions earlier than I expected. 

When the NPC pulled in 6 guards to intimidate them, they just said, fine. Let’s do it. 

So I rolled with it, they fled town, and they still talk about how awesome that sequence was. They thought I planned it, but now I’m scrambling to make a new BBEG. Overall 10/10 experience."
wonderdraft,fdh4mgv,t3_elbuc6,1578415274.0,"I love it. One thing I wish I had done was use the icons for cities instead of using the 3D assets. Much cleaner. I would work on adding major roads. That usually lets your party know where a majority of population and movement is located. That way they know if they are entering a major city, or a minor one."

I normally spend about a month prepping and researching who to vote for, this time. It’s not gonna take as long... I’m tired of being lied to.

His first question, “is anything in the room shiny?”

Then the perma dm would show up with random books for me at sessions until I had dm, mm, and pm. Then I became the DM. 

And they literally burnt my first city to the ground... 

The campaign is going well so far, but they are wanted criminals in that area of the world"
