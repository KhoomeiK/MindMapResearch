AskReddit,ffr01l0,t1_ffq84ex,1580147477.0,"You're right, it's an opinion, so people shouldn't get mad at you for it.  They can disagree, sure, there's nothing wrong with that either.  But they shouldn't downvote, mock, insult, or otherwise attack you for it.

But there's one key point you're missing.  This is Reddit.  Sometimes the hivemind doesn't care what's right.  Sometimes the hivemind just destroys anything that threatens the hivemind."
AskReddit,ffpj9fc,t1_ffpi331,1580096362.0,"Gutsy posting on Reddit anything that implies your life doesn't revolve around dogs.

I respect you for this."
wholesomememes,ffnxuw5,t1_ffnxmn0,1580072139.0,"Oh shit you a real homie.  Let me return the favour.

E: Also you wrote `Lady the streets` not `Lady in the streets`.  I totally missed that until now."
wholesomememes,ffnxp7o,t1_ffnx9ww,1580072094.0,"Well it's going into negatives now so I think *most* people are missing it.  Too subtle, me thinks.

E: The comment *was* negative at the time of posting this.  The silver TannedCroissant gave it is probably the only reason why it returned to positive."
wholesomememes,ffnx0db,t1_ffnwqdw,1580071832.0,"I appreciate you accepting your mistake and not simply deleting your comment, my friend.

Also I 100% expected a *lot* of people to miss the joke.  I made it quite subtle."
wholesomememes,ffnwq0m,t1_ffnvszw,1580071738.0,"...Wait, that's what you go with?  You're not even going to mention that you posted both comments?  lmao

I just saw them both say ""an hour ago"".  I didn't really care which came first, because obviously you didn't steal it anyway."
wholesomememes,ffnwki7,t1_ffnwd78,1580071674.0,You might wanna read my comment more carefully bro.  Specifically the last bit.
TheMonkeysPaw,ffnw8hx,t1_ffnsqcn,1580071536.0,"Under `Plot` it says:

>A talking mouse named Stuart is born to an ordinary family in New York City...

So I'm going to have go ahead and disagree with-

>...He is normal in every way except that he is only just over two inches high and looks exactly like a mouse.

Wait.  What?"
wholesomememes,ffnvc74,t1_ffndvlm,1580071329.0,"Oi!  You stole this comment from /u/TannedCroissant in the [other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/eua07y/everyone_deserves_a_chance_to_be_loved_oc/ffnebhb/)!

At least give credit to the original commenter, geez.  How would you feel if *you* stole *your* comment??"
2007scape,ffmg1qp,t1_ffjpruy,1580054196.0,"Haha I did for a while.  I haven't actually been on it for quite some time.  In fact, I haven't updated the app so I didn't even get the notification that prompted this entire thread!

But I still follow the subreddit, so here I am!

We should be OSRS friends though.

Edit: Also it's interesting just being ""recognized"" out in the wild like this haha"
AskReddit,ffj48xb,t1_ffj451x,1579989994.0,"...Oh.  Well, shit.  Thanks for learning me, mate."
AskReddit,ffj3xb9,t1_ffizk91,1579989757.0,Is this guy having a stroke or am I?  I can't wrap my head around trying to read this.
2007scape,ffj2ugs,t1_ffj1xfg,1579988988.0,"The best solution is opt-in/opt-out.  Make EVERYTHING optional.

If you want to have some kind of ""hey you haven't played in a while!"" thing (which everyone hates btw), whatever, as long as I can choose to disable the hell out of that.

What I wouldn't have disabled however, is some kind of notification when there's an announcement such as changelogs or update notifications.

Basically, break it down into parts and make each part separately opt-in or opt-out'able.

A quick off-the-top-of-my-head list would be:

* Maintenance Downs
* Server Issues
* Announcements
* Polls

BeAmazed,ffita9l,t1_ffisjfz,1579982171.0,Bro I'm on your side I'm just pointing out how your example didn't help your case.
BeAmazed,ffipqhb,t1_ffip10c,1579979654.0,"The problem here was the way you worded the last sentence.  ""I guess there are as many ants as elephants"".  /u/Johnnadawearsglasses is right, there are.  The issue here is you used an example that goes against your own point.

You should have said something like ""if a building was on fire and you could save 10 elephants or 10 ants, which would you choose?"".  You needed an example that actually portrays them of different values, not one that just simply counts them by heads.

(This example was off the top of my head, I don't claim it to be a great one, I'm just pointing out that it has a different result)"

AskReddit,ff9vd1e,t1_ff9jfd0,1579722306.0,Ah that makes sense.  Yeah there’s no way that isn’t majorly manipulated statistics.
AskReddit,ff9i4x9,t1_ff9446w,1579713517.0,Wtf does that netflix quote even mean.  Equivalent what?  Mental energy consumed?  Risk of death?  Cause of cancer?  Emotional damage?  Risk of lightning strike?  I need to know the context of that quote.
