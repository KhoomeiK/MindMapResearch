dogs,ffmvzzj,t1_ffmvna9,1580059513.0,"Fortunately, there's no stairs in the house. But she does have behavioral issues which could get worse if she is completely blind? Besides that, she's healthy.

Edit: the behavioral issue is resource guarding. There's two other dogs in the house (mine and the other one is my aunts, too). She will randomly snap/growl/snarl at the other dogs; sometimes getting into fights. But there are days where she's okay and other days where she isn't"

puppy101,ffh0xx9,t1_ffh06tx,1579920169.0,"Yes, I agree. But if you are to teach a puppy with a basic collar and they are pulling forward, it's putting pressure on their throat. I'm really just worried about safety."
doggrooming,fffxre0,t1_fffxbc2,1579894115.0,"Okay, thank you!"

Anxiety,fffel6n,t3_et1xah,1579882260.0,"Oh hell yeah! Though I've also experience some trauma stuff too with yelling and all that fun stuff.

I'm 17 and I live with my mom, aunt, and two cousins. My mom (40) and my aunt (32) often don't agree on things, probably because of the age gap, and my aunt is quick to anger and get super defensive. So yelling is a regular thing. But whenever they do get into it, my anxiety skyrockets. I can't focus on anything except for the yelling and I get very, very pessimistic - which sometimes affects my depression, as well, depending on how bad the fight is."

PCOS,fffbd89,t1_fffb4t7,1579880221.0,"I mean, I have to go to the walk-in today for ear aches, so maybe it's just worth a shot?"
puppy101,fff3p7d,t1_fff24be,1579874868.0,"I was thinking about a martingale, as well. But aren't they similar to a regular collar? Like if the puppy pulls (even though the martingale doesn't choke), doesn't it still put pressure on their throat?"
puppy101,ffey9rb,t1_ffey12s,1579870208.0,"Perhaps both? Though at first itll just be chilling/play time outside (on my property). I've always used harnesses but my current dog still pulls (which I'm working on) and I know that with harnesses, it pretty much encourages them to pull?"
puppy101,ffewyrd,t3_et5vl6,1579868900.0,"I've had more pros than cons with that experience

My dog had somebody to play with, to cuddle with, and to just spend time with - if I couldn't. It took a bit of adjusting but once the puppy respected my dog's space, they were super duper close within a few days. It wasn't my puppy but my aunt's, with whom I lived with.

Really the only con is the extra poop. Depending on the age differences between the first and second dog, training might be more complicated. In my case, my dog was about 4½ years old when my aunt got the 3 month old puppy, which is usually what people recommend because older dogs can help you guide the way for the puppy. Older dogs will teach them the rights and wrongs; teach them acceptable behavior.

Depending on how your current dog does with other dogs, especially younger, I say go for it!"
