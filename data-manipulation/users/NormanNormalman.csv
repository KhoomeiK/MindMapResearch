A friend of mine bought that kit for his young son.  They enjoyed many pranks together with this. 

If I recall correctly, the kit out of the box also comes with molds for a peanut and corn kernel."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fem6xij,t3_epj709,1579241932.0,"My family has a gravel driveway with a small sinkhole in it. My parents tried filling it many times but it always sinks back down. It is more broad than deep, and you can drive thorough it. But it is still quite sizable. 

Anyway, yeah, my sister and I played witches forever, for years, and that was our cauldron. Good times."

JUSTNOMIL,fdjuhn2,t1_fdju5g2,1578487911.0,"Um, it can be painful, especially for a small child, and the places at the mall that do it with a piercing gun are very unsanitary with untrained staff. Getting ears pierced is absolutely a big deal. I'm glad your experience was so good, but that doesn't mean everyone's is. This child isn't even school age, and without parental consent this decision by JN is absolutely awful."
aww,fdijb27,t1_fdi4kbl,1578444182.0,"I started playing viola in fifth grade. My family was really poor growing up, so we applied for a scholarship to get a loaner instrument I could use in school. My school offered classes, but my family couldn't afford private lessons so I learned just in orchestra class. 

The year I turned twelve my parents got me braces. Like I said, we were church mice poor, so braces was a Big Fucking Deal. I was pretty aware of our financial state, so thought christmas would be pretty tight. It was tight. But I still remember bawling my eyes out, much like this girl, when I opened my viola for the very first time christmas morning. They bought a full size so I could grow into it, and it was too big for me when I got it. But that viola remains one of my favorite instruments. 

Now I fiddle in a string band and own multiple violins, violas, electric violins, drums, banjos, and guitars. My parents did me solid, that's for sure."

We'd put him in the shower, or if someone went to the bathroom we'd put him right outside the door. One time we kind of tucked him into the bed. Good times. I wonder what happened to that cutout?"
