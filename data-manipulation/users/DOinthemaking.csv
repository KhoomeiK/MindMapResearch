HumansBeingBros,fdciabj,t1_fdcerae,1578275588.0,"You’re an absolutely wonderful human being and I wish you nothing but the best in this world.  No doubt that someone of your character commits acts of sincerity and kindness daily, and this is just one that is highlighted. I hope you’re students parents, or for that matter your principal/boss, knows how lucky they are to have you! Truly a heartwarming read"

leangains,fbhlaiv,t3_ed98e0,1576876367.0,"100% focus on building muscle. The increased BMR and catabolism will work its way through the fat. No effort should be required on your part. Eat clean, eat enough, eat when you are hungry and enjoy life. But yeah put that muscle on. Also don't hit supplements like creatine and preworkout. Your organs should not be exposed to that level of toxin filtration just yet. Protein powder is fine though (don't overdo it).
