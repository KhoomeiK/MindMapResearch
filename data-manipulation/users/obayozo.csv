Please don't get me wrong: I'm certainly not claiming there weren't Nazis in the Wehrmacht, or that the German Army didn't commit terrible atrocities. There were, and they did. But your statement seemed to me to be a bit too close to ""all Germans who fought in the war were Nazis"", which simply wasn't the case. It's a rather douchy claim, in fact.

Edit: but yeah, you're right, the ""rhyme or reason"" thing was a bit douchy. Sorry about that."
todayilearned,fcaq7dy,t1_fcaoq2e,1577574402.0,"As it stands, your statement has neither rhyme nor reason. What are you trying to say? That all enlisted German soldiers were Nazis? I believe you will find they were not. Or that it doesn't matter to the slaughtered civilians in Eastern Europe whether their killers were Nazis or ""only"" soldiers? That would be true (more likely than not), but rather beside the point being discussed, I would have thought.

Why wouldn't you draw a distinction, and how does the number of dead Eastern Europeans attest to this?"
