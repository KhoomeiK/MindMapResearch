insanepeoplefacebook,fguvapw,t1_fgumeo5,1581130221.0,This pervert wants dog pics. You should've replied with pictures of your feet.
apexlegends,fgm6a70,t1_fglfbs5,1580918758.0,I agree. But they should make the ship explode.
apexlegends,fgm65xn,t1_fgjf7g3,1580918695.0,[You did abuse the system though](https://twitter.com/tangentiallogic/status/1224902729752961025?s=20)
apexlegends,fgm5pvr,t1_fgl0c5h,1580918463.0,[Haha this is literally the same person he's making fun of in another tweet. ](https://twitter.com/tangentiallogic/status/1224902729752961025?s=20) I thought the ranking and wording sounded familiar.
apexlegends,fgl6nv1,t1_fgkoety,1580883843.0,"Eh, it's a three shot kill weapon with a really long reload, re-chamber, and fire rate. I don't know how much longer of a reload and re-chamber the Kraber is, but it feels like an almost comparable time but the Kraber can one shot. 

I probably wouldn't pick it up as a care package weapon unless it always had disruptor rounds or a different buff."
apexlegends,fgl6epz,t1_fgl4dgc,1580883589.0,"I feel like it's the lack of a strong bullet drop. And the reload is so cool, but slow. So when you get that down with it, it feels powerful and satisfying."
apexlegends,fgl3oko,t1_fgkzeg9,1580881014.0,Oh I remember that! Won a few games that way. Good times?
apexlegends,fgl3jbu,t1_fgl3aul,1580880886.0,">Good to now

Can't tell if this is [meta](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/eywtde/apparently_the_beam_coming_out_of_the_hammond/fgjqrk6/), or just a spelling error."
apexlegends,fgl35u5,t1_fgk4qj7,1580880557.0,"I think the thing to do would be to keep it in, but have the whole ship explode. It would be interesting and exciting enough that maybe people wouldn't complain."
apexlegends,fgjtzfp,t1_fgjrsvx,1580851357.0,Ohh my god that's amazing! I hope it was intentional
apexlegends,fgjtvib,t1_fgjrg1r,1580851296.0,I done got myself harvested.
apexlegends,fgg7qxk,t1_fgg6vma,1580756068.0,"Eh, I dunno. I'm still never worried if the enemy has a G7, you know? It's not like having a longbow, or even charge rifle. You never call out ""careful, watch out for the dude with a scout.""

Edit: well consider me put in my place. I haven't noticed getting downed by many scouts, but looks like I'm alone in this? The several downvotes and comments seem to say so anyway."
deadbydaylight,fgc07ax,t3_exgqt6,1580667712.0,From the thumbnail I thought I was looking at Mick Jagger
Damnthatsinteresting,fg5peve,t1_fg5f361,1580534189.0,"Yup. 

When you're in an argument and you're trying to explain why what they said doesn't actually make sense. But the way that you think about it is more like two puzzle pieces that aren't fitting into place, and you can't very well say that. So you have to go in and break your puzzle pieces down and find the parts that don't fit, translate them, and then explain. But make sure you do that perfectly, or else they'll just be more confused and think you're an idiot. 

I'm also not great at arguments. Don't get me wrong, I'm great at knowing I'm right, best out there. Huge head. Can picture why I'm right perfectly. Just not great at convincing others of that."
AskReddit,ffwz9n7,t1_ffw32xm,1580314351.0,"Haha there we go. 

I don't disagree with your point. Just the premise that you were just curious, and not trying to be rude."
AskReddit,ffw23i1,t1_ffv62km,1580281045.0,"Fuck yeah, baby! I love seeing energy stations. Nuclear is even cooler. Hook me up. YIMBY."
AskReddit,ffw2079,t1_ffvl0k8,1580280941.0,Uninformed people of every ilk are against nuclear power. Everybody I've talked with about the benefits of nuclear power has been a left leaning environmentalist like myself.
AskReddit,ffw1pn1,t1_ffu9hya,1580280613.0,"Shit, when I'm most depressed that's when the best comedy happens."
AskReddit,ffw0zqv,t1_ffvv0fj,1580279833.0,"Ehhhh, I don't think you're actually curious, bud. I think you're trying to make a remark on their character."
AskReddit,ffvyl3o,t1_ffuwgma,1580277355.0,I agree. It also leaves a weird film in my mouth.
AskReddit,ffvvgcn,t1_ffu8iud,1580274453.0,Same with mine. :\
OutOfTheLoop,ffvs292,t1_ffudm2n,1580271644.0,"Yup, that tends to be what happens with me. But sometimes it doesn't in fact post the comment. And the only way of knowing is refreshing, and losing your place. Or clicking the permalink, and still losing your place (on mobile)."
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffvnido,t3_eve4i4,1580268308.0,"I'm on Keto and have been for so long that I don't get many cravings at all anymore. The one thing I want more than anything else though is homemade bread. I love bread machine bread, and now I'm thinking about how perfect those half loafs would be. And your system for storing it seems perfect. Like a fool I bought a really good bread knife before starting, and it's barely been broken in. Going to save this post for the day I finally give in."
toptalent,ffsdkqj,t3_euuldt,1580179139.0,"Strangely, the bars were the part I thought would take the most time and effort, and it seems like they were actually the easiest thing."
news,ffmngfy,t1_ffmdi4b,1580056930.0,"We're not rioting because we can't afford to take time off work. 

Also after Nixon, the right co-oped a very popular news agency and convinced half our population to vote against their own interests. They're also the police and the populace with guns. So it's really an uphill battle for protestors."
news,ffmma3r,t1_ffmhpef,1580056604.0,"Yes, absolutely feel you there. I will get the passive aggressive remarks from the boss, or shit talked about  to the rest of the staff. I'll be treated like I'm lazy for the coming weeks, and it will always be a light smudge on my 'record.' 

And because the boss won't hire enough employees, there won't be anyone to cover, so I'm making a fellow overworked employee work even more. 

And, the best part? I work in food service. I absolutely shouldn't be sick. Ameeeericaaaaaa"
news,ffmlhmi,t1_ffmdgix,1580056294.0,"Yeah, in my experience most bosses, and most politicians, don't care about the logic behind decisions. They care more about squeezing the most out of workers, and this vague idea of what ""work ethic"" means, and ""how it's done."" 

There are many substantial ways we could both increase productivity, and benefit workers that we don't do in this country, because ""that's just not how it's done,"" for the most part. American work ethic means your work yourself to the bone no matter what."
