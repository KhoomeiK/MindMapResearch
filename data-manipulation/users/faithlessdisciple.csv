AskReddit,fejl3e7,t1_fej9vva,1579178537.0,"Nice. Yeah. I’m in Australia. Wolf creek, anyone?

Also- someone whom I considered a very dear friend got caught with a collection of CP he’d been building for over 20 years. Turns out he was friends with me so he could “groom” me so that I was completely trusting of his presence around my daughters. ( no we didn’t ever date, not even FWB.. just gamer nerd friends) 

Yeah he took lewd pictures of my youngest when she was about 3. By lewd I mean pics of him holding her panties aside and the vulva apart.

He was very well off and insanely successful. Did not fit”the type” at all. I never got the skeeviez about him. 

Yes. He got caught. It’s why I found out. He called me to confess from inside immigration detention ( he’d moved from the USA) and tell me fed police would be coming to talk to me. 

Since those pics were taken in NSW- he got life. Not sure where he is serving as he has offences in MANY countries.

It destroyed any tiny shreds of faith in humanity I had left. He KNEW I’d been sexually assaulted as a kid and he still did that. He still pulled my daughter into his depravity.

Thank fuck she never had to go to court. She had to speak to police.. but she was utterly unaware that anything wrong had been done. He never penetrated her oranything.

ADHD,fejae6a,t3_enyduh,1579164033.0,Yeah- I’ve been pulled off my meds pending a possible completely different diagnosis. I CANNOT focus on one task worth a damn and it takes me half a day to even START.
ADHD,feczc7m,t1_fe9ybsc,1578990964.0,Oh yeah- forgot. Miss 9 has some interesting writing issues too. A few things always reversed and WAAAAAAY too much pressure holding/using pencils. Holes. Holes in EVERYTHING.
ADHD,fecz6d6,t1_fe6klc1,1578990748.0,"Is this like this even as a kid? Asking because my miss 9 has ADHD, ODD, sensory processing disorders.. a lisp.. possible autism spectrum. 

I’m bipolar. My focus( when I can grab it) is fucking sharp to the point of obsession. If I’m even slightly elevated, SHIT GETS DONE. So I have a hard time with understanding her.

We both get a head full of static( for different reasons I think) we both get very overwhelmed when there is a lot of noise... but disagreements about tasks needing doing are the WORST because neither of us is any good at backing down. Manic anger meets her oppositional defiant disorder .. = how in the hell has no one called the cops.. not all the time anymore but still..

One thing we’ve done as a family is now she gets extra lead time on things needing doing. Like most kids you could just ask to get shoes on etc.. and it usually gets done in a reasonable time. M

Nope. We plan for at least 30 mins for shoes/socks because those are her worst sensory triggers. We have special socks from Jettproof sensory clothing.. they are seam free.. she still has to wear them inside out. Shoes can = meltdown for SO many reasons.

Couple this with trying to get her dad to his train on time and her school and yeah... 

Focus disappears in favour of meltdown. As soo as she knows her actions will be not great for someone else. ( that’s the ODD part)

She currently has 4 specialists. None of which we can afford right now. She’s on Ritalin and circadin because insomnia is also a thing for her.

So yeah. Wondering if this “padding” outside of EVERY little task is part of her static."
