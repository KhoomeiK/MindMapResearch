Currently SO and I have 2 names, one boy and one girl we have agreed on before there is a pregnancy. There is no need to discuss this name issue until we have either 2 boys or 2 girls. This should be planned way  before a pregnancy. You could go 2 names deep boy and girl also. When I said not this name and not that name, she said not this name and not that name also.  Partners in life should always have respect for their partner. If one person wants to force the other then that is not healthy long term for the family. If my son was named Steve I would spend as little time making little Steve happy because his namesake deserves hell..... She would say the same about a girl named Tracy. We know this because we have open and honest discussions about these things as part of our relationship. Welcome to being an adult, when we can blame things on a name, BTW name magic is one of the oldest.... knowing the name of a thing.... Andrew is the name of a pain in your life, name it.
