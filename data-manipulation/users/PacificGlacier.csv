ADHD,fdyd31z,t3_encvk2,1578778453.0,"Hey bud. I can relate a bit to that. I had two separate moments like that. One was in my mid twenties when I realized that I'd been hustling to get some stability, but that I had only been looking for that and had forgotten/neglected getting interests and hobbies and had indeed abandoned several things I love. 

The second was when I decided to try medicating again and realized I have been judging myself for not doing things that came easy to others it is still a process of discovery and growth to find out what I can be and how I can do for myself.  

I sincerely wish that you take this opportunity to branch out and discover what you want to fill that gap with and aren't too hard on your past self."

ADHD,fds7rw2,t3_ejvvpc,1578696282.0,"I have ADHD inattentive type and I have been meditating since Jan 2013.  I tried teaching myself and had some good progress, but at least in the Buddhist/mindfulness it is usually recommended to sit with a group and work with a teacher. I took two years to follow that advice and it was hella useful. 

I can send a few podcasts from within the Zen Buddhist tradition, but my big advice is to sit with a group of people that don't creep you out, but keep your bullshit detectors on. There are many forms of meditation and they may each be right for different people.

Shuts out the world, it works for me when I'm taking a power nap, so why not with study and learning. Check in with your body, mind and make your own choice.

Study gear: if you normally wear contacts, then a clean pair of library glasses in your laptop bag, having a coffee or tea cup you like that won't spill. Reliable pens in a few colors, flashcards in a little holder or a flexible boundary notebook. If all that fits nicely in a bag. IDK for math people, but maybe a slide rule or calculator that helps...  Basically if you are like getting ready for a study day and bring your gaming laptop and beer cup, what are you going to want to do?

Studying at the library : University libraries can be hella fun to study at. Ok, maybe that's a stretch, but next time you're on campus take a look at what serious studiers you can see.  Do they have a setup with a privacy desk? Are they sipping hot tea or wearing headphones? Do they have four or five buddies working with the whiteboard and a private group study room?  Take a good look at who you'd rather emulate. Also when I see a scarce resource at the library (a prime computer, group study room, view of nature etc).  Next, show up at opening of the library and make that happen. Be honest with yourself if the library is not the best spot. Is the beach better? A computer lab? The lobby of the math department? The community room of your apartment building?

ADHD,fd3uy68,t1_fd3dgew,1578161837.0,"Is accountability lacking? Good study buddies are huge. There was a post a while back from a grad student where she said she had a trusted friend organize to make her think the sure date was before it actually was for that added pressure of a deadline. In my undergraduate I had a fair number of library days to knock out a big paper and Cafe days to knock out homework. Don't discount the power of ritual. Having special study gear and a place was awesome for me. 

Other shots in the dark. 
Music off,

Meditation,fcawt2n,t1_fc7ue1h,1577578167.0,"That's too bad you've had that experience over there. I found the community info helpful, but  I haven't asked much for stuff like this. 

I can relate for sure, I was having a hard time with awareness and ability to recognize it work with anger, grief etc and I worked with recognising my somatic experience. 

The one big podcast for that is Mary Stancavage Undefended Dharma. Very practical and workable. https://marystancavage.org/podcasts/ I recommend you look for the one that is undefended heart from 2013. 

The other big idea to explore (just my experience) if you're had a hard time with directed effort in your meditation, say a breath or Mantra practice, it can be incredibly powerful using a letting go or shikantaza approach. 

The Zen Studies Podcast ""2 paths to meditative concentration""

Meditation,fc6ebvg,t1_fc68lif,1577478555.0,"Glad to help. I will speak a little from my experience and I have a current intention not being too preachy nor endorsing my particular spiritual path.  If it seems to lack structure or is abruptly ended, that means I had to board my flight. 

I get the sense you are scientifically minded, I really find the first chapter of ""the mind illuminated"" called ""establishing a practice"" and the first couple interludes very helpful for me to establish clarity on a model of how my mind focuses or loses focus. He talks about how to start each meditation and develops a system for gaining more concentration. Personally I really value his terms and discussion, but I found I had a lot of striving for some perfect meditation state and was frustrated with my progress along his map. 

I am someone from mainstream religious background, and I had found that I was unable to believe/continue with organized Christan practice. I went to the closest Zen center to my house and started to attend the Dharma talk, then one sitting period each Sunday. Later that turned into some retreat practice, membership and taking precepts. 

I had to find that some of my management and spiritual development was done with my independent study, some with my talk therapy and medication, and some with my Zen formal practice.  

I am thinking of you for a few podcasts I might recommend. But for now I am taking off so I will talk with you more later. 

Feel free to DM or ask more questions in this thread. I might recommend a more open ended post on r/ADHD to see if you get anyone else's input."
