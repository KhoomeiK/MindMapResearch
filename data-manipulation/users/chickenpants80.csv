trashy,fh82ipt,t3_f1pi8m,1581350581.0,When I was 18 I was a teacher's aide at an after school program for kids k-6. One day I taught the younger kids how to make sock puppets. We had 2 extra so I made a John and a Yoko. The kids loved John but they HATED Yoko. They told me she was evil and made me put her in a drawer. They got upset when I took her out.
