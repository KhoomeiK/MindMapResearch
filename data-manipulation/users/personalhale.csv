Pyrenees are basically white golden retrievers until it comes to one very specific breed trait. They're guard dogs. Had my pyr for years and always thought growling or aggression just wasn't even possible with her. She was just one of the goldens. One day, my neighbor's little pitbull made its way under our fence and into my back yard. Well, my extremely docile, white, pyreneese was now red with blood. That was the day that I learned that genetics are exactly what they are. The pit was fine. Just got a pierced ear.
