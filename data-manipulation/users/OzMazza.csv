WTF,fen6opa,t1_fen68up,1579278159.0,How big is the space? Does it have two hatches? Ideally when forcing ventilation in you should have another hatch open for the air to easily come out.
WTF,fen630w,t1_fen59xw,1579277785.0,"Oh! If you're ever working in/near confined space, and you see someone inside the space collapse. DO NOT go and help them. Call for help first, and you should have safety gear already in place, start preparing that. (Should be a self contained breathing apparatus nearby) It sounds common sense, but people's instinct is to help the person asap, especially if it's a buddy of yours. But that's how you wind up with two people in trouble. There was an incident in my city once where I think 2-3 barge workers wound up passing out, then the fire department came and the first guy rushed in without an air tank  and collapsed too. J think in all about 5 people died, and they all had training."
WTF,fen52qn,t1_fen45u4,1579277144.0,"Yeah, if anyone ever asks you to go into any sort of space that doesn't have a source of ventilation (fans) you ask them to test the atmosphere first, and if they refuse you refuse to go in. A good supervisor will test the environment, and they will go in first. At my company a confined space entry permit needs to be filled out and signed by everyone involved and the captain.

Or they can even have toxic fumes from sea life and plants that made it into the tank and started rotting. Or even disturbing rust can release gases I believe."

And you say guns can stop crime, yet then go on to talk about how people aren't obligated to do so? I'm confused what your argument is. 

My argument is that having the potential of multiple people with guns in a building is probably more likely to result in the 'good guy' gunmen shooting each other in a case of mistaken identity."
AskReddit,fec2xm7,t1_feb8xqz,1578965886.0,"That's different though, that's a shooter in one big room. If you're in a large school, and you hear shots several hallways away, by the time you get there with your gun drawn, there could be several other gunmen, you don't know if they're good Samaritans or a shooter.
