Can you please explain why you think this?

Insulin is also the body's main anabolic hormone - this is why bodybuilders take it. Low insulin levels are a good way to watch your muscles fall off. It also regulates the metabolism of all macronutrients.

It doesn't matter if the franchise is dead to you because it is objectively dead. [Every sequel film has made significantly less than its predecessor.](https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/custom-comparisons-extended/Star-Wars-Ep-VII-The-Force-Awakens/Star-Wars-Ep-VIII-The-Last-Jedi/Star-Wars-The-Rise-of-Skywalker-(2019)#tab=day_by_day_comparison) At this point in its run, The Force Awaken had made $879 million at the domestic box office while The Last Jedi made $604 million and The Rise of Skywalker made $501 million. This is called ""dying"".

In fact, [The Rise of Skywalker will make less money than Rogue One](https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/custom-comparisons/Star-Wars-The-Rise-of-Skywalker-(2019)/Rogue-One-A-Star-Wars-Story#tab=day_by_day_comparison).

I know. Guess what? Those people have a valid criticism.

> People still complained about backstory as if it's crucial to find out during the current events of the story

In this case, the criticism of Snoke was that it was bad screenwriting. Snoke was a Chekov's gun. No one cared that he was mysterious in the TFA but when he died with zero explanation in TJS, it was setup with no payoff.

And for narrative reasons, not knowing who Snoke was also made Kylo's Ren killing of him of no significance.

Several fans have this insane double standard expecting the encyclopedic level of backstory content that took DECADES to build to be explained by the new films. 

This is a straw man. No one ever wanted Chewbacca’s back story, for example. 

The objection to Snoke was that a dark side user of his power, position in the First Order, and age raises questions about what he has been up to. One would think he would either be working with Palpatine or (more likely) in a power struggle with Palpatine. 

But, I guess that gets explained by Palpatine having a few Snoke clones in tanks. The purpose of having Snokes on tap is not clear in the slightest."

I only know the movies so I assume you are referring to some EU work. Too bad that’s not canon. 

It certainly raises questions about why no one ever shot some X-Wings piloted by droids at the Death Star. TROS has someone say, “it’s a million to one” which makes the Holdo manuever stupid because she should have known it had a near-zero chance of doing anything, more especially after she bitched out Poe more making a high-risk move that she said had little likelihood of success."

Advice,fffk00z,t3_ernbxi,1579885613.0,"Original post:

My dad has contact saved in phone with just the initials. He doesn't do that with anyone else. A few times now, my brother, my GF, and I have seen him texting this random initials contact in his phone flirtatious things, coupled with flirtatious emojis. I was able to find out that he's also been visiting her place when my mom is out of town, perhaps even while she's here. He even bought her daughter a very expensive graduation gift. I mean like, he put more effort into that than when I graduated high school. Another thing, I've gone to check his phone a few times when I've had the chance, and most of the time he's erased the conversation on his phone (clearly hiding something). The one time he hadn't done that there wasn't anything too incriminating there, but it was definitely odd. It fucks me up to even say this, but he's more friendly and loving with his texts to this random woman than he ever is with my mom. It breaks my heart. Still I keep thinking, well, I don't know anything yet, but at this point, some clear lines have been crossed. And the funny thing is, my dad was always very hard on us about like, ""if you have a girlfriend you should never text or hangout with other girls! That's totally inappropriate and will lead to mischievious behaviour! It's nothing anything to be fucked with!''. Starting to sound like the son of a bitch was speaking out of experience.

Anyway, I'll get to it. I roughly know where she lives, I know where she works. She has a hair salon in town, and I wanna go in there and confront her. Or should I ask her daughter what her mom's relationship is to my dad? I haven't been able to get her contact info but I could probably manage that. I don't wanna just confront my dad because he is an angry violent man who would most likely just deny everything anyway. I cannot let this keep going though. I have to do something about it. I feel like I can't go to my mom about it yet because I don't have concrete evidence yet, I know this is gonna sound naive but it could be that their ""friendship"" is a non-sexual thing. But at the same time why is he trying to conceal her identity and erasing conversations? (More than once). He's clearly got something to hide.

If you have any advice on how to go about this or have been in a similar situation before please hook me up.

PS. I do also have reason to believe she knows my dad is a married man and is ""in on it"" if you know what I mean. So if I ask her about I am quite sure she will just lie to my face as well.

Help a brother out! The amount of stress this is giving me is starting to be immense, I have even started having nightmare of this whole thing. Not pleasant."

When you measure things does not determine whether or not they occur at the same time.
