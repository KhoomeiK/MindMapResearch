If you go to him when he cries/whines, he'll learn that doing so gets you over to him. He'll call asleep. If he wakes up in the middle of the night and does it, he might need to go to the bathroom and then you definitely want to let him out.

Due to his breeding stock, she and her husband were told that they were not to neuter him as the breeder may have wanted to use him as a sire later. A couple of years after getting the pup and training him at the breeder's facility, they got into a car wreck and she was paralyzed. She has limited use of her arms and is wheelchair bound. Their dog has a lot of energy. They decided to get him neutered and when the breeder found out (don't know how, they might have told her), she was livid that they did it. Sorry bitch, circumstances change and if you don't understand why it's a good idea, in this case especially, to help alleviate some of the behavior problems that comes with an unneutered animal, you're an unsympathetic cow.

Botchedsurgeries,ff8btc4,t1_ff8aita,1579672202.0,"I kind of see your point but a lot of the time, posts are of a person in their twenties as the before and then photos of them in their sixties. Regardless of whether or not they had surgery, it's not likely they'd have looked the same way in their sixties as their twenties. 

For example, imagine a post of a photo of twenty year old Janice Dickinson compared with a photo of sixty-five year old Janice Dickinson with the caption ""Such a shame, she used to be so beautiful."" It isn't a fair comparison. She's had so many surgeries over so many years that we have no idea what she'd look like if she hadn't had surgery but guaranteed, she wouldn't have looked like her 20 year old self. We can all see she's had a metric fuck ton of surgery so the comparison isn't even really necessary."
