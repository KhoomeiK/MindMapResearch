TumblrInAction,ffh7pxs,t1_ffgwm9v,1579925480.0,"My bad, I should say that the second comment makes the intentions of the first comment clearer.

The first comment says to not hate gay men. Innocent enough.

The second comment says that misandry doesn't exist, and you can hate men. If we add those two statements together, we have to assume that although the first sentence says not to hate gay men, it only applies to gay men. You can hate other men."
TumblrInAction,ffgx3n4,t1_ffgwgwd,1579917282.0,"So by your reasoning, gaydistortion thinks that you can hate on gay men for being men, but not for being gay, since all they care about is the homophobia. Hating gay men for being men isn't homophobia, just misandry, which apparently doesn't exist, so there's no issue.

While it seems like you put a lot of thought into the reasoning, I'm just going to assume that their wording is just a little off to allow your reasoning to exist, and still think they are stupid."
TumblrInAction,ffgtwm0,t1_ffgleik,1579914952.0,"The second replier makes perfect sense.

""Hating men is okay as long as they're not gay"" is gaydistortion's first comment. I don't know what your thinking is for explaining why it isn't. It does not allow people to hate gay men because they are gay. That is the original point, gaydistortion just didn't put the ""you can hate all other men"" part in.

""Misandry isn't real"" is literally gaydistortion's second comment.

Therefore, they did squeeze those two ideas into consecutive sentences. GD is just so stupid that they don't realize it/don't have a good argument and feign ignorance."

Any discrimination or hatred of someone because of their race is racism. Using ""white"" as an insult is certainly hatred, and also making it seem like feel inferior to others.

I agree, white people have experienced lass racism than other races. But reverse racism exists, and this is an example of it.

Same thing goes for sexism-[heck, the definition of it is even looser.](https://www.google.com/search?q=sexism+definition&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS868US868&oq=sexism+definition&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l7.2551j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) Automatically assuming every man is just waiting to mansplain to you is a pretty negative stereotype, no?

I'm working with the facts I'm presented with. A lady said ""old white man's mansplanation"" without provocation by the said man. You're the one thinking of ""what-ifs"", trying to justify her behavior."

>Are there some misfires? Sure. Obviously the one above sounds like one to us.

And I'm a bit confused by your second paragraph. I consistently said that they shouldn't have personally attacked him for being old, white, and a man, but they can reject him for just butting into their conversation. You tried to justify it by saying that they could have had bad experiences with men, and I said that they still shouldn't attack him."
tumblr,ff0ipj8,t3_eqvn7a,1579469211.0,Can't tell if the title admits reverse racism exists or is just ignorant and doesn't think so.
facepalm,ff0elj0,t1_fezw575,1579468162.0,"Well, I'm talking about this specific ""misfire"". You said yourself that she shouldn't have reacted the way that she did. Remember: we are also assuming she has been a helpless victim of the patriarchy. It is equally as likely that she grew up in a progressive area, has not experienced much sexism other than the occasional schoolboy taunt, and is simply throwing herself into this movement because she's been told all these stories about how women are mistreated. In this case, there is literally no justification.

Now, let's say she has been discriminated against for her whole life. Once again, a simple ""No, thanks."" will do. Heck, you don't even have to be polite about it-just tell him to go away. But she made this about gender and used the word ""mansplanation"", which immediately villainizes Solomon despite him not doing anything to deserve it. Rejecting him is fine, attacking him just for being a man is hateful and never okay, no matter what your prior experience.

Let's say I was friends with a black dude. He pickpockets me and runs off. Next time I see a black dude, should I tell him ""all black people steal""? No, because the actions of a few does not justify hostility to an entire group."
facepalm,fezjnvu,t1_fex5xqo,1579458029.0,"Because that is the most inaccurate part. Sure, they use old and white as insults, but Solomon is technically old and white. No point in disputing that.

However, ""mansplaining"" is defined as a man condescendingly explaining something  to a woman that knows more about the subject than he does, and he assumes she has no idea about the subject just because she is a woman. Literally no aspect of the definition applies, which makes it an even bigger deal that it was used as an insult."
facepalm,fezimph,t1_fex76hp,1579457749.0,"If a woman asks a question out loud, then she obviously doesn't know the answer, right? If someone helpfully offered to explain it to her, then it's a win-win situation: the woman learns something, and whoever explains it to her (male or female) gets to look smart. There's nothing wrong with just trying to look smart, unless you hurt other people by doing so.

Now, why does it matter that it's usually men that offer to explain to her? There's nothing wrong with men being confident. If they act like she's stupid for not knowing, or just shut her down whenever she tries to say something, that's wrong. However, Solomon didn't do that. It's not right for her to take their anger at the ""patriarchy"" on a completely random ""old white man"". It doesn't matter if other men were rude to her years before, in this situation, there was no provocation for how hostile she was."
facepalm,fewznru,t1_fewpeak,1579421953.0,"Well, you see, that's not what happened. They immediately acted sexist towards him (""Mansplanation""), without an provocation. If they said ""No, thanks"", it's fine, but acting hostile to him right off the bat because you're ""woke"" is just no bueno."

The only reason I can think of why Jenny has a different stealth stat than they are supposed to is because of a glitch. Maybe it was specific to when they tested it, maybe not. I'm probably not going to spend too much time testing out Jenny's stealth, though, so I'll just trust that data.
