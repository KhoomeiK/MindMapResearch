AmItheAsshole,fg1svly,t3_ewc92i,1580432709.0,"NTA. Spoil your kids and raise your grandkids or raise your kids and spoil your grandkids. Clearly they spoiled their kid if even though too disabled to care for a child the person still thought it was a good idea to have kids and try to raise them. If they can’t take care of a child, they can’t take care of the child and shouldn’t be raising one. The responsible thing is to give the child to another family to raise in a good home."
AskReddit,ffy0zkr,t3_evnzey,1580336398.0,"That nurses have time to do their job and that of the CNAs. When one nurse gets 2 CNAs, it’s because there’s 3 people worth of work to do for the day to even be meeting minimum care needs. So to you shithead DONs, if you don’t start treating your CNAs like you *should*, don’t wonder why your facility is short staffed and has to offer bonuses. It is 100% on the management to fix their problems. 99.9% of charge and med nurses are great and easily among the best people on earth to work with. I can’t say the same about schedulers and nursing directors. It’s like y’all forgot what the job was actually like once you got into a position of authority. Either that or you’ve bent over taking it from corporate too far."
