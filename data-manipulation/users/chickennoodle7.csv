Edit: after Denmark came Norway then Sweden, then Greenland and then the Netherlands. [Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_same-sex_marriage)

Edit 2: Denmark was not first to actually legalize gay marriage but they had a civil union. The Netherlands were actually the first to literally legalize gay marriage on the 21st of December 2000 by Queen Beatrix"
