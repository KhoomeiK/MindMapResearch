aww,felcm06,t1_fekj4br,1579219025.0,"Mine was found in our warehouse. He was only 5 weeks old. Was skittish for over a month, hiding in the bathroom we quarantined him for the first week while we treated him for fleas and ticks, and still isn’t a fan of me (even though I was the one who brought him home!) but has become the most loving cat to my wife and daughters. One of my kids called him Sushi and it just kinda stuck.. [Here’s a pic of the little man. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9FNdTs)"
CannabisExtracts,fekeqn6,t3_epfpyw,1579198508.0,Agreed. He was right on the CBG’s anti-inflammatory properties but CBN is the result of THC oxidation.
CannabisExtracts,fekapan,t3_ep1c4w,1579196112.0,"Question first: What are you doing with this when you're done? Making a tincture?

You don't really need to research using a crockpot specifically for this function, but you need to understand what the crockpot is capable of reaching in terms of the temp.  If this is the route you plan on going then I'd recommend putting some regular ol' cooking oil in the crockpot and see how hot it can get. 

The acidic chain isn't going to drop off until about 230F (110C), and should only take about 30 min. If the crockpot can reach those temps then I'd say this is a feasible option. You can go as low as \~200F (95C) but double the time it will take to decarb (\~1hr). 

All of that said, I think the easiest way to get this done outside the home would be to create a double boiler outside on the grill. Boil some water and put the shatter in a pyrex dish or second stainless pot resting above the boiling water. Once you've completed this process you can either add the MCT right in the same vessel and continue the process, or you can transition to the crockpot to complete the infusion. Whatever happens don't let the process exceed 320F (160C) as that is the boiling/smoke/flash point of MCT."

CannabisExtracts,fek4swk,t3_eosull,1579192613.0,"I’m assuming this was done via CO2? If you ran it too hot and it came out dark then you probably lost a lot of the terps, and the chlorophylls are contributing to the taste. You’d need to run it through some type of CRC (AC, DE, or BN) to filter out the color/taste."
