thewalkingdead,ff5ebde,t3_erqti7,1579589237.0,"The nature of the show is that things will change. Characters will die. But as people have different preferences as to the characters they like and how the story goes, it's hard for anyone to say yes or no to your question. The point is every viewer goes through the pain of seeing characters they like die. We all know that inevitability when we watch this show. You need to watch it with that understanding in mind. You'll recover."

Dancing starts at 1.28. It's all credits and faff until then.

2.30 wasn't interesting at all. Just a clickbait title from OP.

Despite some nice editing and shkts thriughout, overall the video was too obnoxious to enjoy. There are better ones out there.
