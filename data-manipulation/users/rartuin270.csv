aww,ff4773f,t1_ff3wut2,1579557040.0,I once read that someone put vise grips on the end of a bully stick to keep them from eating it.
aww,ff3oq8g,t1_ff3om3h,1579545591.0,Sorry about that.
aww,ff3nozv,t1_ff3mr10,1579544954.0,Wasn't trying to be a dick but apparently you were. I wasn't sure why he was doing it at first. Later I realized later it was probably the bully stick. He would cough for a bit and then it would stop for a while then it would start again. He was fine otherwise. Still wanted to play and bounce around. I actually tried to clear his throat multiple times and also tried the dog heimlich.  Figured if he was still doing it in the morning it'd be vet time.
aww,ff3ltjc,t1_ff3k5jy,1579543790.0,"I pretty much only give mine stuffed hooves, stuffed femur bones, and antlers now and only when I'm home. Those get put away when I'm not home. He also gets ice cubes. I should find a dog bone mold for ice."
aww,ff3i0i5,t1_ff3acqi,1579541459.0,"Bully sticks can cause choking as well if you have an idiot dog like mine. Last time I gave him one there was about 3"" left. I looked away for a second and it was gone. He was gagging and hacking the rest of the night. Took him to the emergency vet in the morning and it made it to his stomach where it digested but that was a rough night.

gaming,feldm5t,t1_felbr3c,1579219695.0,Here they come out heavy in the spring to get the salt and sand off the roads from winter. I think they do it in most of the country but you may never see them do it. They typically don't do it in subdivisions around here. Just city streets and neighborhoods.
gaming,felbja3,t1_fekz0p8,1579218317.0,It's not. It helps keep the drains clean so rainwater can go into them. Most places have drainage going to the curb. If there is sediment and debris in the way that just gets carried to the drain which eventually clogs resulting in standing water.
