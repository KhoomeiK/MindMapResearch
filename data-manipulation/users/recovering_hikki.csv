povertyfinance,few0v38,t1_fevsecj,1579403878.0,"i grew up in both poverty and a sterile lifeless environment and also literally spent 8 years of the most crucial parts of my life vegetating due to extreme mental illness, but i recently moved out and am now fully independent, paying for all my expenses while going to school full-time and work part-time. 

yeah I am struggling to survive, but if my home wasnt a toxic shithole, then wow I could have saved $3700 in rent and $500 in food costs.

I'd be able to buy a car for myself, have insane leverage when it comes to work because it's no longer about survival meaning i can invest time into getting a better job, probably never have to worry about money ever, enjoy my life, not be stressed, take more classes and graduate faster, spend time on socializing, hobbies, learning, instead of survival or chores, etc. etc.
