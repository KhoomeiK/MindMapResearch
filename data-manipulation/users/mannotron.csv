But, objectively speaking, Iron Hands aren't just oppressive, they're flat out broken. The fact that they're 8% of the lists and 24% of the 3-0 contenders is crazy.

The new guys feel like they decided to embrace the weirder design aesthetics (after the success of the more interesting ranges in AoS) of the Ironstrider/Dragoons, while evolving the base design of Skitarii and Sicarians. Tech Priests, meanwhile, are still what they've always been - the classic robed cyborgs. I'm one of the people who actually really enjoy the direction they're taking the faction - its a kitbashing bonanza, and I think we'll see some amazing looking forces once some of the more creative converters and painters get their hands on things."
WarhammerCompetitive,ffedhbd,t1_ffebyxi,1579844006.0,"The model range informs the lore these days, not the other way around. Titanicus (2008) and Priests of Mars (2012) were published well before the first AdMech codex (Skitarii, 7th ed, released April 2015). AdMech had no real aesthetic besides being red robed cyborgs at this point - what you're reading in these books is McNeill and Abnett exploring a faction that had not yet been given a design aesthetic. 

What's happening with the AdMech is the exact *opposite* of what you've asserted - they now know what they're doing with the model range aesthetically, and they're going hard with that Jules Verne archeotech vibe. You might not like it, and that's perfectly fine - that's what kitbashing and converting is all about - but what's happening is absolutely not GW floundering with the faction, it's GW finally deciding exactly what they want to do with them."

australia,ffbgbkc,t1_ffba560,1579764029.0,"Grew up in a Pentacostal church through the 80s-90s. There was definitely an undercurrent of 'we are the one true brand of faith' that, although not explicit, definitely viewed the Catholic and Orthodox practice of praying to saints as evil, tantamount to idolatry. There was also a huge emphasis on 'spiritual warfare', and spiritual gifts that directly showed God's favour (speaking in tongues, prophecy, and that particular brand of mysticism that was so popular with televangelists and other charletains). 

I also remember that the church (an Assemblies of God church) became affiliated with Hillsong in the 90s, and went through a massive period of growth during that time. This coincided with the church leadership adopting the prosperity doctrine and the expulsion of a significant proportion of the leadership who disagreed with it, including the head pastor's brother in law who was a founding member and the 2IC up until that point. That was around the point where I left the church (and later, religion), disgusted at the tangible shift of focus from compassion and charity to greed and superchurch production values.

Their seers peer into the many possible futures and figure out which actions will likely lead to which outcomes, and then the Craftworld will act according to which is the preferred long-term outcome. 

This is the biggest reason that Humanity views the Eldar as being mercurial and unreliable, and it is exacerbated by the fact that different Craftworlds are often acting towards different long term goals, leading to an outsider's perception that Eldar are almost schizophrenic in their disposition, as they can be allies one moment and turn on you the next, for reasons that are completely unintuitive or incomprehensible to humans."
