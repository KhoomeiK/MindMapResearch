The first time I did a cycling classes or gym routine it kicked my ass. I couldn’t sit on the toilet to pee I was so sore! But for me the soreness the tiredness meant one thing: I did it. Every wince, gasp and grunt reminded me constantly throughout the next day that I did it and no one not even myself could take it back. It was oddly comforting. The only thing that helped with my extreme soreness was to just keep going. That’s the hard part. To keep going.

For me and my relationship I think I have a responsibility to my partner to be the best that I can be.

The primary speaker was a 50+ HR manager saying how she can’t sleep and her and her BF both get outta bed making groaning noises (he’s also obese). HR’s  assistant jumps in agreeing that she also is experiencing pain. And that she along with her husband (also obese) got up from their couches last night and groaned and thought “oh no We are making old people noises hahahahaha we are old now!!” HR worker says it’s just because they’re getting older and you’ll be in pain all the time moving around when you’re older. The assistant and her husband are 27...

Then a plant manager came up and said he was hurting as well and must mean he’s getting old and because he has a herniated disc. He’s 26. 

How is it that it’s now NORMAL to be in so much pain and make “old people noises” at such a young age? Why are we normalizing and laughing about this. You shouldn’t think “oh I’m just getting old” when you’re barely in your 30’s!!

fatlogic,fdetexb,t3_ekyc09,1578346223.0,"GIANT DOG RANT: 

This pisses me off to no end. I have a wiener dog. Which if you don’t know long dogs (corgis bassets weens) all need their weight severely monitored as even a few extra pounds puts extra strain on their already stressed backs. My Vet explained to me that 2lbs of extra weight for my dog is like 20lbs. When my ween got to 18lbs we immediately began to measure out his food and took away any treats. I then got dog insurance to better prepare for any back issues he will mostly likely had. 

IVDD is huge in the weenie community. Over 25% of weens will get it and there’s no way to detect it or deter it. You can only take precautions by just assuming it’ll eventually happen. This means a strict diet for your dog and not allowing jumping on furniture or in play. The disease is caused when the cushioning discs (which function like shock absorbers) between the vertebrae of the spinal column begin to harden. Eventually, they may harden to the point that they can no longer adequately cushion the spinal vertebrae. Which leads to dogs not being able to move their back legs or move. There’s surgeries and physical therapy that can help of course by why tempt fate with extra kibble? 

When I see fat long dogs I get so ducking upset. My SO’s family had a fat corgi and when he began losing his ability to walk and needed assistance guess what? They put him down. And then got a basset!! (Insisting the breeder guaranteed no IVDD..and when I told them that wasn’t scientifically possible they ignored me and went back to their star charts) 

These are innocent creatures that rely on us to properly take care of them and give them the best life.  If you’re not researching your breed of choice and not fiscally prepared to take in breed specific illnesses go to a damn shelter! No ones starving their dog for Instagram likes or vanity. Over feeding It’s literally killing innocent creatures for no apparent reason.

fatlogic,fcxvkjt,t1_fcxu4by,1578071140.0,"How do you manage time? Our group seems to spend 2-3 hours talking and drinking THEN gaming. And by that point I’m too tired to have the focus to begin anything. Like we are starting at 8pm this weekend. And I wanted to hit up the gym the next morning. 

I mean it’s not a HUGE sacrifice to support by essentially showing my face around his friends so they know we are still dating. But ugh I just don’t wanna lol"
fatlogic,fcxqp5e,t3_ejgni9,1578069163.0,"Small whiny rant: I’ve had a social engagement with 2 other couples for game night on the books since last month. The hosts are known to make delicious cock tails. And they are all smokers. So a few things: I’ve been wanting to cut back on my drinking as there’s so many negatives to it that I cannot justify the ‘well it tastes good’ and I also want to stop smoking. I am just anxious about this weekend being around temptation. I have conceded to drinking 2 drinks and thats it. And to also smoking only 3 times. But I really wish I wasn’t going to be there at all. The group of couples are all obese and have made passive aggressive comments about myself and my SO with our diet and exercise. The host famously referred to women as ‘skinny bitches’ in front of me. So I’m a HUGE fan of this friend group but it’s my SO’s friends and he wants me there so...ugh. 

I just want to stay home, read about sports science, women Olympic athletes and do a bajillion kettlebell swings in my living room. I’m tired of just sitting at someone’s house surrounded by junk food alcohol dick jokes and huffing. I wish we would DO SOMETHING we live in a city for gods sakes there’s so much to do! 

Rave: found this book “the Sports Gene” and I’m so excited to dig into it tonight after some good foam rolling. Also anyone know any good YouTube videos for foam rolling? Also I got a new planner that is color coded and I’m so happy to be using it now for the new year. 

Mini rant: huge wait lists for my gym classes now DAMN"
fatlogic,fcurjuf,t3_ej0fld,1577987047.0,"1) it’s her job. I’m great at my job. Because I’m required to be. Doesn’t make me better than someone whose job isn’t marketing. 2) she does sound out of breath. Sorry she doesn’t sound great live. IMO she looks and sounded winded and you can tell when she gets gassed. 3) her dancing is a few moves than half measures as back up dancers go all out. This is typical of singers (cept Beyoncé at Coachella she did take a few light breathers but less than I expected) but lizzo? she goes in and out very frequently during songs let alone sets.

Her exercising (her job) everyday doesn’t out run the fork. There’s this false narrative that you have to work out everyday for hours to be thin.
Lizzo proves that that isn’t true. And yet here we are with FA taking points.

Edit: may I point out that no one would call this an athletic feat if she were fit or thin. The fact remains the only reason lizzo is getting applause like this is because of her obesity. It’s the one thing that makes her stand out versus the other pop r and b singers of today. How is it that FA’s want equality and want fatness to be considered normal when all they want is the spotlight for doing everyday normal things??"
smallbooblove,fcuqt71,t3_ej0sek,1577986629.0,Wow that makes no sense the neckline alone to me looks like it requires a “smaller” chest. The curves are in the silhouette created by the cut.

fatlogic,fct5bhs,t1_fct39nq,1577933265.0,"My SO has friends that enable one man of their friend group who gets black out drunk any time he drinks. The mind boggling part is they complain about it behind his back but then keep making him drinks. The man also has crohns smokes and shits and pukes blood. They laugh about it (this is a group of grown men been friends since high school all in their late 30’s early 40’s) 

My SO has confronted everyone on this destructive behavior and he gets told it’s not a big deal and “yes well what can we do?” Then they invite him over “get shit faced in the basement” on weekends.

Edit: uh can you be my friend because I’d love someone to smack a cigarette out of my hand any time I try and light up"
fatlogic,fct51u3,t3_eiqy43,1577933067.0,I’m a smoker and I never ever ever have or have heard a smoker insist it was healthy or justified it. Ironically all the smokers I know besides my SO are all obese (nope not over weight but breaking chairs obese)
