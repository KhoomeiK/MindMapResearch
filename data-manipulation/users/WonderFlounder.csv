GetMotivated,fek0s88,t1_fejvcof,1579190158.0,"I have no idea how she spent her summer. I feel like that's an unnecessary point to make though. Teachers shape our future and show us how we can make the world better, are they really the ones who should be shamed for ""not doing enough""? Also, ""personal wealth"" is not a very good description of the economic situation of teachers imo"
GetMotivated,fejonox,t3_epgwc1,1579181792.0,"This reminds me of this exercise we did in school when I was like 16. We were split into groups of like 6-7 people and each group was given a different number of paper sheets. One group hade like two sheets, another hade like 10. The challenge was to get your whole group across a room (like 10-12 m) without touching the flopr, i.e by stepping on the paper. The groups with a lot of papers got across by simply putting down their sheets like islands and jumping one by one. The group with just two sheets had one guy sliding on them like skates while carrying everyone over. Took ages. It was then explained that this was supposed to symbolize global economy and resource distribution, how some countries have more than others. Then the real lesson came, when our teacher told us the best solution. She simply gathered all the sheets and put them in a straight line across the room. All we had to do was walk, one by one, together as one world."
