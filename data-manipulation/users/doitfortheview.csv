Streaks can carry pressure as they get higher. 

So. Have reality skips. Eg if you have the flu ... you likely won’t do a whole bunch of them. 

The trick is how to avoid this being a way to regularly skip. So I propose it’s an “effort”. Eg not just a button. Instead you have to write at least 20 words to your future self about why you are skipping and something else about getting back on track. 

You get the idea. 

Even Apple activity misses this and people with 2 year streaks lose out or start handing their watches to people and pets to reach their goals. 

Apps and software need more reality baked in. And you seem to be aware of that so I offer this idea to you. 

Secondly. Include WHY. Record WHY you’re doing the challenge against the challenge. Then have ways to remind yourself of this in the future when you’re feeling less motivated. And not just “to get thinner” etc ... but “thinner so that .... I fit in my wedding outfit” etc. 

Hope that offers some inspiration"

I still recommend the books and connecting with your WHY however. Sounds like that’s missing. 

——-


I wasn’t a morning person for 34 years. Now I am. I worked hard on my evening and morning routines and the quality of my sleep. One of the game changers was ear plugs. 

I also worked (and still work) hard on understanding why I get up each day.  What do I stand for and who do I stand up for. 

I can recommend the audio books

The miracle morning 

And

The seven habits of highly effective people

These two were incredible critical to my change and my life has been dramatically different for years now. 

I’ll finish by saying environment, bed covers and temperature can all make a huge difference. And you might want to focus on tiny habits that you build on rather than big changes. 

For example, I started by saying each morning I will wake up open my eyes, look at the curtains, close them and go back to sleep. I did that for 2 weeks. You can’t fail. Then made it open eyes, look at curtains, lift my head up, put it back down, go to sleep if I want. 

You keep building on this with habits that you can’t fail at. Over time I ended up in the bathroom cleaning teeth and drinking water. From there the rest cascaded as my body glued into the morning triggers based upon habit. 

Hope that helps."

Keep reaching out to people. It won’t always go great, but it always moves you forward. 

Don’t feel overwhelmed by the choices. There are lots. From Kickstarter to amazon. Take your time. Spend a day or more. Visualise how you want to use them and contact the makers with any questions - they are typically responsive. 

There are reviews of many of them on YouTube and google. 

But plan to take time so you don’t feel pressured to just buy one. 

And if you start using it and it doesn’t feel right, I offer two bits of advice 

1) perhaps you can open up your mind more with regard to thinking up an answer. So although you may see the same question on the page each day, consider the different meanings it may really have or focus on an area that’s important to you at that time

2) use what you learn from your first one to inform the purchase decision of the next one

I’d imagine if you started with something like the 6 minute diary and then did the one you already plan to do, it might help. 

There are others on amazon too such as one about self love / value etc.
