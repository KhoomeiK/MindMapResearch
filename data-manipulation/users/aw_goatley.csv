xbiking,ff55q06,t3_ermhqp,1579580980.0,"I bought this Checkpoint ALR4 used about a year ago and its done about 2.1k miles of truly abusive dirt, gravel, and road riding since then. I did my longest ride to date on this baby (75mi). I recently gave it a proper cleaning, some long overdue new bar tape, a new saddle, and mounted up this wheel and tire combo, which I had sitting around separately. Today after work I took it for a 25mi neighborhood-alleyway -cross-ride and I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this bike. Its nothing particularly special but it really feels great in my hands and I can't get over how good it looks without any super blingy components. The more relaxed geometry is truly excellent for miiiiiles too.   


Rolling home in a STIFF tailwind cruising around 25mph in fear of (almost) no pothole was also excellent!"
