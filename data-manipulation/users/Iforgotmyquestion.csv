They were a lot like a lizard. Mellow and kinda sweet unless they were hungry or scared. Lizard brain and all that. 

If you see a snake, be slow and back up. They truly do not want to attack a human. Native species of snakes help their environment a lot, spiders too! Those critters are removing pests we don't want."
