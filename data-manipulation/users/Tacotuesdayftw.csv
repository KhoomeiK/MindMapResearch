I mean, even if the US took my entire paycheck for the whole year in taxes it still wouldn't cover the cost of a lot of medical procedures. The funny thing is, the United States government has highest healthcare budget in the world. This means more tax dollars go toward our healthcare (medicare/medicaid/subsidies) in the US than any other country already, and yet we still have these absurd prices. And that's just for the prices of the care. Don't get me started on insurance costs starting with intro plans (not subsidized through their workplace) of $500 a month for one person with no preexisting condition with a $2000 deductible and six month - one year wait before even being able to use that insurance, a plan, by the way, that likely won't cover any serious medical procedures, doesn't cover dental, and won't cover any cosmetic surgeries (no not plastic surgery, I mean things like dental implants - because dental implants are only cosmetic! Teeth have no other use besides looks!) 

Don't worry, though, if you do have a job that covers medical, then you may only have a $1000 deductible at $300 a month per person on your plan! But hey, you get dental sometimes! 

I don't know what's happening in this country, but in my opinion it's way past the point of human rights violations. The amount of people who have died to this issue and the amount of people refusing care makes me think this is a genocide level threat. That may be hyperbole, but when we really look at the numbers, I can't think of another word that better iterates the severity of the problem here. We are systematically destroying hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives."
