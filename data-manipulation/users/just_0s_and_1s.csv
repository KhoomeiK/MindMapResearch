bulletjournal,fdoal02,t3_emc7c5,1578601736.0,"i don’t particularly recommend watching seven. although it has great music and the storyline is very good, it is difficult to watch in a this-stuff-is-so-messed-up-and-now-it’s-in-my-brain-forever kind of way.

some things from that movie still give me the heebee-geebees.

(note, i am an overly empathetic female if that helps you gauge whether to watch it. if i had known what it would entail, i would have not watched it.)

edit: my fiancé who is male and not very empathetic also had a hard time with this movie, though his complaints are mostly with the ending."

bulletjournal,fcovv4u,t3_ei3ghs,1577842991.0,"it’s really helpful to see how you track medicine because i was thinking about how i would set up my own headache tracker and wasn’t quite sure how i wanted to indicate days with painkillers vs without. i like your method!

i used to get headaches daily and migraines monthly, but triptans and preventives never worked (i tried so many things... beta blockers, antidepressants, anti-seizure meds, acupuncture, biofeedback therapy... you name it, i’ve probably tried it)

birth control has been the most effective “preventative” for me but i still get a headache probably once a week, and of course the placebo week is usually rough. my migraines are less frequent though. i usually try not to take meds unless i really need to but when i do it’s usually excedrin. 

thanks for sharing your tracker, and i hope you can find something that helps you!"
