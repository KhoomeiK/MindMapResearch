facepalm,ffqu2q5,t1_ffqpvj3,1580143657.0,No. In public places it’s perfectly legal. Now if you had it in the street aiming at someone’s window that would be illegal.
puppy101,ffoilr8,t3_eudecc,1580078002.0,"Grapes are weird they seem to affect some dogs and not others. Glad your pup ended up being okay!

About 10 years ago we used to give our lab grapes, not knowing they were bad. Luckily she was one of the ones that didn't seem to be affected by them, but theres a weird list of things that are bad for dogs- onions, avacados, macadamian nuts, and garlic are also bad."
puppy101,ffk2dc6,t3_etvnxy,1580013677.0,Yep trainer is right. On top of the issue of behavioral issues- it’s also a breeding ground for disease. Is your pup fully vaccinated?
puppy101,ffk0hyp,t3_etxpk4,1580012071.0,"Just echoing what others have said- when my pup was 11 weeks he was probably at his bitey-est. He drew blood and ripped holes all with a grin on his face. He’s 17 weeks old now, and much better. His biting now is generally more of an opened mouth grabbing and he’s not breaking skin. Your pup will get there!"

puppy101,ffd2ctq,t3_estt17,1579812045.0,"I would go by your vets advice. They can tell you how high the Parvo risk is in the area and what they’d recommend. Your pup can also get socialization by being carried and riding in a shopping cart in dog friendly stores, it doesn’t have to only include walks.

My pup has just turned 16 weeks and is going for his first walk next week, but he’s been well socialized- he loves everyone, which is likely partially due to genetics and partially due to exposure to different people. 

I was a bit paranoid and am waiting longer then really necessary, but my vet did just mentioned that they’d had a recent Parvo case so I don’t feel too unreasonable."
AskReddit,ffcgowa,t1_ffc0td7,1579799074.0,Same! I could get shots and be fine but getting blood drawn freaks me the hell out.

AskReddit,fevd7nk,t1_fet0b14,1579396009.0,"This happened to me, and I’m not entirely sure what happened. Came home from school with my mother and she couldn’t find her key and my dad wasn’t there yet-no biggie there’s a spare outside. I go to get the one outside and as I open the thing that holds it the key falls on the ground. It disappeared, neither of us could find it. This was in the chicken run and figured okay it’s somehwere in the dirt, it’ll turn up. My dad got home and we got in the house.

The next day my aunt brings me home from school because my mom was working late and I used the key o had to open the door- immediately put it in my bag when I get inside. Then I go to my room and set my backpack on my bed. I go let the dog outside, come back to move my backpack and there is the key I lost lying on my bed. I was confused so I checked my backpack to make sure it wasn’t the one I’d used- nope that was still there. It’s been years and I still don’t understand what happened."

puppy101,fesprze,t1_feohnzx,1579367736.0,Basically same for my standard Aussie- he’s constantly lying on his back so it didn’t take him long.
politics,fepil9m,t1_fepg0nk,1579321431.0,"As simply anecdotal evidence- as a high schooler when this policy was implemented they slowly started taking things away from school lunches ie no more sour cream with baked potatoes or implementing new “healthier options” that tasted awful. Now it’s perfectly doable to make decent tasting healthy alternatives but this was not what happened at my high school, likely because of money. The end result was a large proportion of students who stopped eating at school and instead ordered fast food to be delivered, brought lunches from home, or simply didn’t eat. There was also a lot of whole meals thrown away.

The program was good in theory but in practice from what I experienced it made things far worse as it led to people simply not eating school food and going to other often less healthy foods.

TLDR; school food started to suck so fast food became the go to."
NintendoSwitch,fene1zz,t1_fenclzo,1579282691.0,"From only my personal experience they’re pretty different. I didn’t like animal crossing when I tried it (admittedly that was probably about 10 years ago) but I love Stardew valley. To me animal crossing was too open ended with no objectives, Stardew at least has some plot and quests. 

It’s entirely possibly that you’d enjoy animal crossing so take what I said with a grain of salt."
