But that also means that each culture has to swallow some bitter pills. I'm from the US, which is culturally and politically based on pluralism, tolerance, the acceptance of a wide array of races, the separation of religion form politics, the acceptance of homosexuality, and so on.

The Pakistani and Afghan governments likely looks at this values with utter disdain if not disbelief, while any Americans view the values of those nations at totally backward.

Having grown sick of his son's obsession with Zeppelin, the dad said, ""I can't listen to any more of this"" and switched the stereo to play whatever radio station it was set to. Not only was Stairway to Heaven playing on that radio station, but it was at the exact point of the song that was cut off when he switched from tape to radio, so the song continued seamlessly.

AskReddit,ferg6cl,t1_fer4xgc,1579353498.0,"It depends on your definition of pop. If ""pop"" simply means ""popular,"" then sure, everything played on popular radio or tv is pop. But if ""pop"" means music that is produced and intended to be financially successful instead of artistically significant, via a number of metrics that have historically resulted in vast amounts of album sales, then MGMT has never properly fit into that category. 

Keep in mind that Kids, Time to Pretend, and Electric Feel were all recorded well before the group was signed.

Was Alice in Chains labeled pop (maybe, but I never heard such a label applied to them)? Was Ween (same)? Were the Beatles when they released ""Tomorrow Never Knows?"" 

How about Dead Kennedys, The Misfits, Sisters of Mercy, The Melvins, The Cramps, The Butthole Surfers, Lambchop, Daniel Johnson, The Magnetic Fields, Moondog, Meat Puppets, etc. 

These are all groups that have received significant radio play despite not being pop artists. Sure, some have released songs that could be dubbed ""pop,"" but most of their catalogues stray far from pop.

AskReddit,feghs2p,t1_fega6yu,1579093174.0,"Ok. For the sake of a productive conversation, let's pretend that I forget everything I said before this message. Right now I am not explicitly calling you racist. But, just to let you know as one person to a fellow person, saying things like ""I'm not racist"" make you immediately sound racist. 

It's as if the cops rounded up 10 people, and one was guilty of theft. You're the one screaming, ""Officer, I can't be guilty because I HATE thieves!"" It's like that famous line from Hamlet--""*The lady doth protest too much*,"" in which a character is accused of a crime due to her insistent claims thats she's innocent.

This is not my original judgment nor my original claim. Instead, it's a very well established trend. People who respond to criticism about their views and actions with ""But I'm no sexist because I have female friends"" or ""I'm not a racist because I know plenty of blacks"" or ""I'm a really nice person who is drama-free"" tend to radiate to the rest of the world that they are, indeed, sexist, racist, and full of drama without realizing it. It's never a sure thing, but it's a hint. 

This applies to everything from online dating profiles to reddit comments to in-class statements to dinner table arguments to professional articles. I suggest that, instead of insisting that you're not racist or that you have no issues with other races, that you demonstrate these claims by sharing viewpoints, stories, and thoughts that demonstrate your lack of prejudice.

AskReddit,fefzuhp,t1_fecobco,1579070987.0,"I get where you're coming from. You're using ""normal"" in an intuitive, everyday sense, as I think most people do. But when placed under a microscope the notion quickly crumbles. And when it comes to identifying people, it's important to place preconceived notions under a microscope because identity is enormously important to people. And given that trans people are largely oppressed, sometimes violently so, this seems to make it extremely important to them and others.

I'm ""normal"" in the sense that I'm an adult male measuring 5'11"". But if my height were to be measured with the accuracy of an astrophysicist, It might turn out that I'm actually 5'11.3025678945143740872548809846275172435"". And that *could* mean that I'm highly abnormal in the sense that few other adult men have also been measured to that precise height. Heck, perhaps I'd be the only human in recorded history with that height, making me EXTREMELY abnormal. A veritable freak.

Similarly, designations such as ""albino"" and ""left-handed"" are normal or abnormal only in relation to relevant measurements. I would posit that there exists in the world a town, or at least could feasibly exist in the world a town, perhaps a very tiny one, in which there are just as many left-handed people as there are right-handed people. Perhaps there are even more lefties. Wouldn't the lefties then be perfectly normal in their daily context? Yup. Same goes for albinos. Context is key.

To add a personal touch I have Tourette Syndrome. Not an extreme case, but it makes me an odd duck nonetheless. It is *not* normal in my life. However, there are summer camps designed exclusively for young people with this syndrome. When these youngsters gather by the hundreds, Tourette becomes normal in their temporary community. The chefs in the mess hall who don't experience Tourette might be considered abnormal for not intuitively understanding the syndrome. 

Can you see why I take issue with your cavalier use of the term? All of the cases I mentioned fit in perfectly with your ""in the statistical sense"" criteria. Marathon runners, as you mention, are abnormal in the general population, but if you were to take a poll at the finish line of a marathon and asked, ""Are you a marathon runner?"" you'd get a 100% positive result, and there's nothing more normal than that.

To get back to the original matter, it's true that in my social life there are few trans people. But in college and when I lived in San Francisco I had groups of friends that mostly consisted of trans people. In those instances, being trans was most certainly normal. I was the odd man out, and was considered suspect by some for this reason. I was the weirdo, the outsider. I wasn't normal.

AskReddit,feclnfb,t1_fec7vaz,1578976970.0,"Yeah but how is that any different from a 5'8"" guy putting on their Tinder profile that they're 6'? Or lying that they went to an Ivy college?

AskReddit,feckttg,t1_febvz3x,1578976373.0,"Is it unnatural to get braces? They are a foreign object surgically applied to the body, yet many of us have received them. Does that make our mouthes fake? How about contact lenses? They're artificial objects placed directly on the eyeball, and they help people feel more like themselves. How is this different?

What about screws placed into the bones of people who've suffered severe fractures? Stitches to sew a cut? Orthopedic shoes? Wigs, weaves, and hairpieces? Those contacts that change ones eye color? AR devices like Google Glass? Nail polish (the nails aren't *naturally* that color, after all!)? Hair dye? High heeled shoes that appear to alter ones height? Makeup? The use of medicated cream to clear up acne? A cast or crutches to help mend a broken bone?

What about clothes that make you feel thin, or muscular, or taller, or shorter? What about a haircut that you think makes you look more attractive? All of these things are alterations of your natural look that make you feel better about yourself. You need to recognize that gender confirmation surgery is not different."

Sleeping with a woman who then reveals that she's trans would upset me, but I can't place my finger on why. And, as you said, ""homophobic/transphobic"" doesn't quite feel like the correct diagnosis, but maybe I'm deluding myself. 

I also strongly agree that all the comments saying ""it's in the interest of their own safety to disclose"" sound menacing and dispassionate. Thanks for the insightfulness!"
AskReddit,feciy8f,t1_feaxung,1578975045.0,"A close buddy of mine is FTM and last summer we went to the beach together. I saw him in a male swimsuit and there was absolutely *nothing* that would give away the fact that he was raised as a girl. He had a square, masculine face covered in facial hair (very dashing!), a hulking frame, built pecs carpeted in thick chest hair, and all-in-all the body of a sculpted man. He's been taking testosterone but hasn't received any surgery.

When we first met 15 years ago he looked far more feminine, but now nobody would suspect that there's a vagina under that swimsuit. He and I have talked about the times when he's gone home from a bar with a woman and they get undressed. Not once has any partner objected to his surprise vagina. But that's his experience and his alone. Still though, this one example invalidates your claim. No politics necessary."

Please do not legally hitch yourself to her, despite your desires.
