Nurse,ffc69wq,t1_ffc67jk,1579792520.0,Sure can! Send me a message with your email! Congrats!
Kratomm,ffaunab,t1_ff9i3cu,1579744880.0,"If that ever happens again you CALL THE EMT’s. Your seizure threshold was so low and the med mix up caused rapid detox (which was mentioned). 
They would have given you meds to ride it out in the ER (probably sedatives/benzos, anticonvulsants, antispasmodics, and some fluids)"

StudentNurse,ff8wtgh,t3_erzz6f,1579698680.0,Watch nurse sarah from Registered Nurse RN. She’s on YouTube. And has her own site.
Nurse,ff6og5h,t1_ff6l9o0,1579631535.0,Awesome!
Nurse,ff6jjoi,t1_ff6j9jd,1579628558.0,Very welcome! Diploma programs are AMAZING for adult learners and new high school grads too. They’re about a two year program and have a greater focus on clinical practice. So no fluffy classes. Right to the point.  Also Portage learning has pre reqs geared towards nursing and they’re a work at your own pace course. They include labs and are accepted at most nursing programs. I’d get those out of the way first.
Nurse,ff6j5un,t1_ff6fm3z,1579628326.0,Our Pittsburgh magnet hospitals don’t require the BSN. They require that you have it within a year of your hiring date. And they’ll help pay! North Dakota is the only state that REQUIRES a BSN for hire (unless it’s been updated per our practice acts).
Nurse,ff6iz8x,t3_erwo6d,1579628215.0,"The difference in pay at my Pittsburgh hospital is TWENTY FIVE CENTS!!! They have less clinical hours and I went to a diploma program. Both get an RN. You’ll see some job postings that say “BSN Preferred” but that absolutely does not mean any RN is exempt from the position.

Point is you’ll pay more for a BSN (more debt) and you’ll make less than a dollar more with the title. 

Also, why wouldn’t you get tour RN and have your employer pay for further education. It’s a win win situation that way! 

Just my experience. Good luck!"
