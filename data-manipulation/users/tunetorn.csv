LGBTeens,fd7fgtf,t3_ejvg3a,1578203644.0,"hey sis. I understand. 

One look at my post history and you can see that im in a similar situation (considering self harm and being trans). I know the world seems like it's ending and if not the would then sometimes it feels like your life is talking apart. we're living a very hard life in a very difficult time. things seem out of control and the future looks ever so grim. but we need to take it one day at a time. it's all we can do. 

hrt isn't an over night cure. dysphoria wont go away in one day. the world will not end today. we're playing a long term game and sometimes it doesnt feel worth the effort. without the promise of future happiness, life seems worthless and by that logic, you feel worthless about yourself. you're not. you're so very loved and filled with potential. I don't know you even at all but the fact that you're still here with this much pain (a pain more people than you think share) means you're strong and on some level you both want and expect to be happy in the future. I believe it also. it's the only way we can continue. we have to believe it gets better. if it doesn't, then we'll have been wrong and that's too bad. but the consequences of assuming the worst in comparison to the merits of optimism reveal that we have an obligation to ourselves to put in the effort. 

I'm so proud of where you've already carried yourself and I'm confident that you can keep going. it doesn't have to look good, you don't have to know what you're doing because none of us really do. we'll still love you and cheer you on either as a fellow runner or as a spectator. one step at a time, one day at a time. it may be awful, it may not. we can't ever know until it's been decided. as Anthony Hopkins once said, ‚ÄúNone of us are getting out of here alive. So please stop treating yourself like an afterthought. Eat the delicious food. Walk in the sunshine. Jump in the ocean. Say the truth that you‚Äôre carrying in your heart like hidden treasure. Be silly. Be kind. Be weird. There is no time for anything else‚Äù¬†

dms are open to anyone. stay safe, sis."
