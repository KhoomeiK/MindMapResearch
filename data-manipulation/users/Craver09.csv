cats,fegiq8h,t3_eormll,1579094013.0,What a handsome boy. Sorry for your loss. Getting close to this with my Lucy and I do not look forward to that day.
cats,fede2ft,t3_eocqsw,1579008933.0,Beautiful kitty!
metaldetecting,fdniyw8,t3_em1wnr,1578586795.0,That is quite a find. Congrats and happy hunting.

dashcamgifs,fdiuo6m,t3_eletmk,1578451434.0,Forget car lengths as that is literally 1980s training.  Use the 2 second rule instead.  Unless you fall asleep or get cut off - you will always have ample stopping room.
metaldetecting,fdelw45,t3_ekth6l,1578341789.0,Very nice find. I have found 5 of these and none of them looked nearly as nice as this one.
