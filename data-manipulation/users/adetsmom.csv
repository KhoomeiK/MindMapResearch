bipolar,fe9uh0v,t1_fe31i6x,1578941556.0,Yeah its pathetic yet funny how that somehow brings it home. Doesn't really work on men though ha ha!
bipolar,fe0dcod,t1_fdzxxwj,1578810683.0,"So true. For years I would share articles etc with loved ones and was conffused that they were still so confused, i immediately realized, I Don't understand them at all either! So I gave up the need to be understood. It was absolutely liberating! Not worth all that energy! And just think, most of us have spent years studying pschiatry and brain chemistry, and the ""normies"" probably think DSM is a rappers name.   In this context, its the same as expecting a child to understand and be sensitive."
bipolar,fe05e9n,t3_encbw8,1578803474.0,"I was at my nephew's wedding recently, and part of the bridesmaids toast included a joke about bipolar. She's a nurse. I chose to ignore it instead of letting it potentially wreck me. Another time a coworker did the omg me too crap, and i responded oh wow ii just thought you on your period a lot. Somehow she found that offensive. I found it funny (still do). Some people just can't be educated so i don't bother."
bipolar,fe04oig,t3_encbw8,1578802992.0,"Yes, but can't help but laugh, because eventually they are bound to discover it's so so much more than a fad, regardless of whether that is a true diagnosis or not... Like the social stigma just to start."
