sex,fevqxrx,t1_feul6ua,1579400431.0,"One was circumcised, and my current one is not. Besides being nervous the first time we did it because I’d never seen an y circumcised penis, it has literally had no impact on our relationship whatsoever"

sex,fes7dv7,t1_fes6lep,1579362167.0,I use a pumice bc my heels get really dry. My bf on the other hand has like baby feet it’s really weird and so he doesn’t need them. But if you get dry cracked heels it’s good to use and the pumice is only $2 so no need for pedis. I personally don’t have that pedicure money to be getting that done all the time
sex,feri5s3,t1_ferh5k6,1579354186.0,"I mean it smells like dick, but dick smell doesn’t smell bad? If that makes sense. My point is it shouldn’t be like a scarring experience to give a blow job to someone at the end of a day, unless they’ve been sweating all day or something. At it’s worse, it might have sweat, which after the first lick just goes away and the duck just tastes/smells like nothing lol. In my experience, vaginas have a stronger smell than dicks at all times bc it’s a moist environment whereas dicks are just chilling and being dry most of the time."

sex,ferhplw,t3_eqedoj,1579354019.0,Yeah that smoke smell really likes to seep into clothing and furniture :/ sucks you had to buy a brand new mattress just to get rid of the smell
bulletjournal,ferbfq8,t1_fec919n,1579352018.0,"I believe the paper on this notebook is around 80 or 90gsm as well,m. I usually use the mildliners, which don’t bleed through at all on this paper. The stabilos seem to be more watery, so I feel like they kinda pile up at the end of anything you highlight, and that part will bleed through if that makes sense. It’s not that bad and if you lift up quickly it shouldn’t be an issue."
sex,ferb17d,t1_fer9z40,1579351850.0,Dude I’m from florida and there were so many guys that wore flip flops daily (which is NOT a shoe and if your toenails look wack that’s just worse) and there was one guy particular in my band who had the scariest heels I’ve ever seen. I sat behind him in rehearsal and it was a sight to see. He also always smelled bad. One time we accidentally took his uniform home to wash and my mom made me swear to never take his home again bc the scent of his cut through and stunk up our whole care and laundry room.
sex,feraa7c,t1_fer7e1e,1579351724.0,"lmaooooooooo asking someone to take a shower is shallow?! My b boo if not wanting to date someone that smells like literal poo is shallow, call me the shallowest of them all"
