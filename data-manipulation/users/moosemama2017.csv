AmItheAsshole,ffk1ial,t3_etwny0,1580012941.0,"NTA. My dad's family made fun of my body when i was little. I remember being 5, and being teased for eating too many sweets at Christmas and how it would hurt my figure, and later being around 7 or 8 years old and hearing ""you're just like your father, buttcrack always showing!"" 

It is not okay to tease a child about their body. It's not okay to tease anyone about their body. But children? If she grows up hearing stuff like this often enough she's going to have a very hard time with figuring out how to have a good relationship with her own body and diet."
AmItheAsshole,ff8s4ag,t3_es8oxf,1579693926.0,"NTA, but i do think you should thank him. Wait, don't attack me yet! I definitely think he is in the wrong for how he said it and saying that you should be solely responsible for your child on days he works, and i think every stay at home (or even just home for the day) parent deserves at least a half hour repreive from their child once their spouse gets home from work.

I think he should thank you for providing him a meal, and taking care of your child while he's at work. I also think you should thank him for giving you a few minutes to be without the baby, and for working his 10 hour shift to provide for the family. 

I am a firm believer that expressing gratitude for even the small things can go a long way in improving/maintaining relationships. I thank my husband for taking care of the litter boxes, even though the cats are both of our responsibility. I thank him for doing laundry, even though half of it is his. I thank him for doing dishes even though he helped dirty them. 

Expressing gratitude regularly makes you take a moment to realize they've done something either for you or for your mutual benefit, and it is crucial to ensuring your partner doesn't feel resentful, forgotten, or taken for granted."
Fencesitter,ff7tjpa,t3_es41lc,1579658014.0,"I'm 21 too. I vary the answer i give people based on whether i think they'll fight me or not. If someone is super pro-kids to the point they think you're a child hater if you say you're unsure, i say i want them eventually. If someone is totally anti-kid, i just agree with the reasons not to want kids. If someone expresses being unsure themselves, or just ambivalent about children, i will express my unsurity. 

Honestly i don't think i will know for sure until I'm in a financially stable enough position to make the decision. A lot of my reasons for not having kids have to do with my mental health, money, and personal time. Having enough extra money would solve a lot of those problems, but I'd still most likely have the energy and mental health issues. 

I think people who are unsure usually just play it safe around others, whereas people who are super into kids can't help but express how much they love and want them, and people who are super against kids always seem to end up going on rants about how much they don't want them and hate being asked about it."

First year i was invited they informed us we'd most likely be on an air mattress or sharing a twin size bed. We have gotten hotel rooms every single year we have been together and it is great. I don't get in-law overkill (aka i have time to decompress and be alone with or without my man) and we show up bright eyed and bushy tailed usually a half hour after everyone else has woken up. Hotel also means we can have sex.

AmItheAsshole,fcnen3s,t3_ehw713,1577810144.0,"NTA Your wife needs therapy ASAP. My mom has this kind of irrational insecurity too. Not that I've ever heard her get upset over my dad saying he loves me, but when i was little i was a daddy's girl. 

I'd stay up on weekends waiting for him to get home from work and when he did he would bring me ice cream and we'd watch tv together. He'd take me to DQ (i was a food motivated child) so we could sit and talk. He did this because he worked 2nd shift so i never saw him during the week, and my little brother required a lot of attention so this was pretty much my only one on one attention with a parent ever. 

Eventually my mom started getting upset that i was getting so much (probably 1 or 2 hrs a week) attention from my dad and she wasn't, and got mad at him in front of me over it. A few times. It was enough to make me wonder if my relationship with my dad was wrong, and i started pushing him away and feeling awkward with him and any man. I thought any one on one attention with a man was wrong unless it's a romantic partner. It really screwed me up because i felt i wasn't allowed to be close to my father, and i was a tomboy and got along with guys best before this so it really messed up my friendships too. 

I love my mom and because of therapy I've realized why she did what she did and I've forgiven her, but her issues created issues for me. I've started being close to my dad again but from the time i was 11 to the time i was probably 17-18 i just felt awkward and watched with him. Help your wife work on her issues before they do permanent damage to your daughter."
AskReddit,fcnbtd9,t1_fcn2ijt,1577808289.0,"Overseas? Like China, which is well known for paying $0.25/hr for labor in sweat shops? I suppose those mattresses would be cheap, yeah. My store's brands are all made in America, so the labor alone to make a mattress is usually at least $15/hr. I'm not saying it all has low markup, there is garbage furniture that gets insane markups. It really depends on where you go and what you're looking at, but in my experience both selling and owning furniture you really do get what you pay for."
AskReddit,fcmggr1,t1_fcm6ng6,1577774341.0,"Maybe the manufacturer markup is high if you're only taking into account the materials to make it. 

I work at a furniture store and we have a few brands that train craftspeople like crazy, recertify them every year, and are so painstaking about the handmade process and ensuring everything is perfect that it can take them 1-3 months to finish a sofa, depending on the intricacy of the design. That's a lot of labor hours. Funny enough, those are $1500-3000 couches and only have a 50% profit margin, which isn't a lot when you consider the salespeople, warehouse employees, customer service peeps, HR, delivery employees, shipping, etc costs that the store has to pay before even being able to offer you the couch.

Now i will admit if you're looking at a sofa under $800, it is very likely mass manufactured, made with poor quality materials such as recycled foam, particle board/plywood, cardboard, low end springs, and staples. I actually took apart a couch that was like 60% cardboard once. If these are the pieces of furniture you are looking at, yes, they cost the store about $200 give or take and have been marked up quite a bit, have a 1 yr warranty cuz they're trash, and yes as a salesperson i will try to talk up the more expensive shit but thats mainly because i don't want you to come yell at me when your destructive relatives visit for the holidays and bust your couch.

As far as mattresses go, you are often paying for the coil count, foam density, quality foam, pressure relief, and engineering that goes into it. A brand that's been around 150 yrs will charge more than a brand that's been around 1 yr because they know more about how to make a mattress that lasts and stays comfortable. My store only caries a handfull brands, most of which have been around since the 1800s and 1 is tempurpedic. There is often a 50-100% markup (that i can see). 

And no, as a salesperson i am not allowed to haggle. Prices are what corporate says and no matter how much you beg i can't cut that without losing my job. However, if you are very nice and easy to work with, sometimes we will find extra coupons for you."

Id tell them they're nice guys and I'd be cool being friends but they'd continue trying to get in my pants, send nudes, etc. Now i always tried to reject them politely before ghosting, but if they wouldn't accept it or if they went off i just caspered my ass on out."
