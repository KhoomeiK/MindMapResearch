eg. Roy Halladay barely got 2000 reddit upvotes last year when it was announced cause everyone already knew based on his stats that he would easily get in

When they come out with a new cpus usually it adds instruction sets eg. sse4 instructions, sse 4.1, sse 4.2 etc and practically none of the software ever utilized the instruction sets until like 5 years later 

All you need to know is SCALING.  It makes no sense ""No PC is using an AMD Jaguar"".

Just look for the past 40 years whenever intel or amd come out with a new processor that added new instructions.  Look at the consoles.  PS3 launch games, PS3 final games.

It's like saying ""why isn't 'Last of Us' a PS3 LAUNCH title?"""

anything above scaling is practically like a dust particle :D

PlaystationClassic,fe7q9ot,t3_cp7u6h,1578917894.0,To follow up if you downgrade to firmware 1.24 it will see your DS4 controller as DS3 instead of 8bitdo and you will be able to use both digital and analogue on any screen.  No mapping needed
