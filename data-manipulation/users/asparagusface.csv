Keep in mind that impeachment and removal from office (conviction in the Senate) does not require that the president break any of the criminal laws that you and I are beholden to. They are held to a much higher standard, as they should be considering the massive and lasting damage they could inflict on our country. Read up on what impeachment actually is and get back to us with your thoughts on why you think he is innocent. And don't be lazy and just say you don't believe the witnesses called at the impeachment inquiry. Each one of those people have demonstrated mountains more integrity in their careers than the shady, tax-evading, racist, misogynistic, sleazy, lying buffoon that currently occupies the White House.

Also, I find it INTENSELY UN-AMERICAN for people like you to support such a traitorous individual, who betrays our American values with his every action. It's like his supporters are so afraid of being wrong about him that they double down on their bad decision to vote for him and only end up prolonging the damage that he is doing to our country. We are rapidly eroding our democracy and becoming more of a plutocracy. If you don't know what that is, look it up. REMOVING TRUMP IS THE MOST PATRIOTIC THING YOU CAN DO FOR OUR COUNTRY!"
