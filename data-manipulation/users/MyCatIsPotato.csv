self,fftlwpy,t3_ev2cja,1580223903.0,"I feel this so much. I've deleted my Facebook, never used Twitter, and only have a handful of friends on Snapchat because of this very reason. Social media in large, is personally, very bad for me. I love Reddit because it has such a variety of things to look at. However, there are some really shitty people on here too. I'm an extremely emotional and empathetic person so I try to connect with people emotionally but that can backfire. The type of people who treat others like crap will never change no matter what you say or do. They either don't care at all how they make other people feel, or they relish in the pain of others.  There's nothing you can do or say to change them. It's like trying to talk a volcano out of spewing molten lava. It'll never work. The thing that works best for me is to spend as little time on any type of social media as possible, and to focus on the happy content only. If I see something that upsets me, I close out of it to remove myself from the source of garbage."
