Veterans,ff9tab7,t1_ff92vt6,1579720786.0,I'm at 70% overall.  have proven hearing loss in records but denied due to not enough to qualify. 10% L and 15% R. Psychological they only gave me 30%. I have to bump an issue to 40% in order to put in for Total. They wont give me ratings for my shoulder and several other issues that are listed and service connected.
bipolar,ff6ffq3,t1_ff68owg,1579626029.0,"I have been untreated for a few years and I'm just not trying to get help again. I've been drinking quite a bit for a 2 to 3 years now. This time, I'm over the hangovers and headaches or scratching money up to numb myself. I just need time to go to the DR and get shit right"
Overwatch,ff3rjyc,t3_eredvc,1579547314.0,"In quick play, I tend to squat on a character but I will change to counter if needed. Enemy Bastion, I go Hog. Need spacing or Enemy Mei, I go Orisa. Pushing, I go Rein. I dont do Winston or Zarya and Dva is played out. If I am healer, I go Mercy. 
The other thing is the map. Some are just better on certain maps.

You have to create a team who talks to fix those bot issues."
Veterans,fem29e9,t1_fem24jj,1579237384.0,I would love a switch. Especially into something that works better with me. I'm just worried about it not being enough.
Veterans,fem19s6,t1_felw92a,1579236505.0,You were able to get a position with these types of courses? Seems like employers want degrees in CS or IT
alcoholic,feid30p,t3_ep2fm3,1579135685.0,"Your a 21F who is living life. Young people lose control because they lack consequence knowledge. Plus it is college parties. It's all peer pressure and if they are easily pressured, this will happen. I've been drinking half a liter minimum or more of alcohol, via shots, a night for 2.5years.  Twice a week parties like this isn't doing your body that much damage."
Veterans,fegtkxb,t1_feey7go,1579102228.0,Veterans are sparking things up in the flowering cannabis industry.
bipolar,fedjsbj,t1_feddn6z,1579013301.0,The VA prescribed me Gabapentin for that. Unfortunately this is my second attempt at sobriety due to relapse. I'm moving to access better healthcare from the VA so here's to getting better and living better

bipolar,fecccf3,t3_eocl2d,1578970628.0,"After the military, 8 years, I was medically retired for Bipolar 2. Longest job I have held was 2 years as a warehouse manager. I was pretty cool with my boss but but I fell short on projects and started more projects than I could manage at a time. To deal with the stress, I drank, every night. Usually a pint of hard alcohol from 6pm to 10pm or later. Pass out, wake up, move forward. Every other job I've had has lasted days to a max of around 6 months. People dont see the after work issues you have. It's difficult. I'm sober for 8 days now with medication. Not taking the seroquel due to the grogginess and difficulty waking it creates in the morning."
bipolar,fecb91e,t1_fe8qzln,1578970026.0,"I took Lithium for a few months. Accidentally took an ibuprofen, mistaken for tylenol, early morning due to headache. I kept myself from fainting and passing out. I fell asleep later on after drinking plenty of water. I also had the zombie thing and I stood in one spot for 5 minutes staaring off for no reason. I also didnt like driving an hr for bloodwork every few weeks."
rap,febqdtr,t3_eoara8,1578961576.0,"Your flow would travel along the lines of what you listen to. How unique or restrictive is your playlist? I listen to all kinds of rap with exception of this mumble stuff. This enabled me to develop a diverse flow and style that's unique to myself, my flow, how I perceive rap should be, and interesting to listeners."
LifeProTips,fdvqj3v,t1_fdubzpf,1578750342.0,"The US has yearly inspections for vehicles. Some States more strict. Emergency kit not required. If you know the right person or place, license and insurance not required."
bipolar,fczj3u7,t3_ejhmz1,1578102362.0,"I've been out. Medical discharge for BP2. They still cant touch me, but they pay me every month"
askscience,fcrmgfu,t3_eiedw5,1577903729.0,"As far as oxygen transfer, no it does  not lead to each cell. The best description would be a drive through.

Oxygenated blood flows to a spot. Cells and blood come close together. Transfer occurs through convection. Cells absorb oxygen and blood becomes deficient in oxygen. This is when it recycles back to the lungs where the same process occurs to oxygenate cells."
bipolar,fcnt73r,t1_fcnbx1m,1577817945.0,I've been off meds for 2 to 3 years. I don't know if I was manic the entire time but I was definitely everywhere at 100 miles a minute. I'm now at the low end again :(
Veterans,fckploa,t3_ehneuo,1577730449.0,Couple PTSD with paranoid personality disorder and good luck fixing it. I've been trying for years

apexlegends,fc146il,t1_fc0xfv4,1577307758.0,I've never been able to do this. I've had zero beacons to use before. Do they reset each ring?
apexlegends,fbzc3cw,t1_fbyk9rb,1577241753.0,I personally prefer a R301 over R99. I think you need toe purple extended mag to get full benefits of both of them though. I've explored Flatline as a viable option as well as Devotion and Spitfire.  Just trying to run the best combo.
apexlegends,fbyjotv,t1_fbxh31h,1577218611.0,Perhaps it's just the pub lobbies. I only play pubs due to no solid squad but I plan on getting into ranked during season 4. It's nice to know its used more with higher tier players.
