curlyhair,fg00u0k,t1_ffz82zj,1580397690.0,"Hmmm I've never used a drug store gel before, but there may be options in the wiki.

When you say it made your hair look crusty, were you not scrunching out the gel to break the cast when your hair was dry?"
curlyhair,ffz4xw9,t1_ffz359v,1580364122.0,"Welcome! You've got an awesome base going, so I bet you're going to have even more gorgeous curls after this.

&#x200B;

1. Get sulfate free shampoo and silicone free conditioner. Can be drug store, can be more expensive like devacurl or jessicurl.
2. Get a good quality gel! This I always buy through jessicurl (developed an allergy to devacurl but it was my holy grail for ages).

Your basic routine can be: shampoo, rinse, put conditioner in (usually at least double the conditioner as shampoo). Do some of the rest of your shower routine to let the conditioner soak in. Brush your hair in the shower with conditioner in with a wet brush or tangle teaser. Rinse out the conditioner, scrunching your hair as you do it. NO MORE BRUSHING after this. Then, scrunch the gel into your hair. Loooots of gel. Do all this in the shower with your hair shopping wet. Some people can manage the conditioner and gel and brushing upside down, mine becomes a tangly mess when I do this, so I don't really have tips on that.

Get out of the shower, then either scrunch your hair into a microfiber towel or old tshirt, or try plopping. Wait for your hair to dry all the way before scrunching out the gel crunch. You can blow dry it with a diffuser for more volume and faster drying.  


I'm capricious as heck, so sometimes I blow dry my hair straight, sometimes I wear it wavy/curly. You just need to find the routine that makes you happy!"

You've had a moment of clarity that shows you can live feeling a different way. Go get a professional on your side to help you identify what might make you feel this way, and what's in your control to change. You've got this.

This isn't blaming, you're just searching for ways you can make change together. Some things will be on you, some on her, and some on lifestyle. You know you don't want to feel how you do today, and the exercise you're going through is just to help you understand how! No need to feel guilt over what you discover and things you may want to do differently."

pics,ffsngy1,t1_ffshgqu,1580186253.0,"I grew up wearing a back brace from 10 to 13 years old. They wanted me to consider surgery and I refused.

As an adult, my curve actually went backwards a few degrees. It has never caused me pain. It stayed stable eventually after getting worse through most of my teens.

Questions I've considered as an adult (13 year old me should not have had control over that choice probably): will it prevent problems in the future, like pressure on my lungs? Will it cause problems with me having kids? Will it prevent me from doing things I enjoy like gardening?

At this point, I have no intention of considering the surgery until it actually causes me pain or poses a risk to my health. I'm very lucky on the pain factor.

You can wait, it just is harder to recover as an adult. Get multiple opinions from multiple doctors. See what happens with specialized PT to support his spine. I'm just anecdotal data, but I'm very glad now that my parents didn't force it on me."

I highly suggest putting yourself back on the job market, and in the meantime working with a therapist to identify what of your burnout is in your control (overwork etc.) And what is caused by the company that you need to avoid at your next one.

I got a new job and put in my notice last week. I get 3 weeks off in between to recover and get myself back.

My dad has cerebral palsy and as a kid his doctors told him he'd never do anything athletic in his life. It also made learning hard for him because he couldn't hand-write notes fast enough (we're talking the 1960s for school, no keyboards in class)

You know what he did? He went to law school and he got special permission to tape record all of his classes, so he technically attended all of them twice: once in the classroom, once when he listened again at home to take notes at his own pace. He's been a lawyer for over 30 years now.  


At 65 years old, he now goes to OrangeTheory 3 times a week, and he took a special disability-friendly skiing class recently, that helped him learn how to balance enough that he ended up able to go down the mountain 15 times on his own.

Seattle,ffcfxzq,t1_ffc9qq8,1579798616.0,"Of course! I have a friend who was in the Vegas shooting but didn't actually get hit. She and I talked quite a bit about the way it impacted her.

Have you ever been in a bad car accident before? At least for me, every time I got in the car afterward I had a sense of fear/possible impending loss that took quite a while to get over.

Now picture that feeling every time you leave your house. This is just my opinion, not based on studies, but humans aren't built to anticipate our own mortality every second of the day. We know intellectually that we're going to pass away some day, but your brain can't handle just going to the grocery store and expecting that something could take you out at any moment. It's not healthy to be on your walk to work and think ""hey, something could kill me before I get there"" every day. Witnessing an extreme act of violence like this will rock your sense of safety.

My friend said it would hit her completely randomly, just out walking the dog, and she felt like she needed to rush home just because she wasn't able to handle being out in the open air like that. She needed coping mechanisms from a professional to ground her to reality again."
