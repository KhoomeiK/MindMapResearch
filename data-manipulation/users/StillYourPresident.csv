It wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that these large corporate customers seem to be lining up to give away their IT budgets and their in house operations.  My guess is they're probably sick of hearing about things they don't understand, like their own fucking business rules, getting in the way of their expansion dreams.  So instead they give up what gives them their competitive edge to simplify operations and end up just being another carbon copy business running on a out of the box, turn-key technology stack and end up being owned by MS or their partners."
