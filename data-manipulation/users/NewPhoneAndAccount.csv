A mortise is a lil hole dug into the wood and the tenon is the protruding part that is glued.  A mortise is the female part to the tenons male part. Not related to dovetails or fingers or any type of box joint other than the obvious that it's a right angle joint. Mortise and tenon is usually 8sed for a load bearing joint which reinforces the connection... a table leg going into the table or somethin like that."

But..
 Gordeau has a command grab that eats the opponents grd meter, you should use that a fuckin lot. I can tell by your post you know this but also cant break people open.  Which is an oxymoron to me.  Do it or dont. If you're getting tagged while tryin to command grab, you're too predictable. 

Gordeau basically shouldnt ever be losing the grd battle unless you're straight up outclassed by your opponent (which happens a lot to me).  Its not a terrible idea to play like a grappler, a grotesque horrible full screen special having grappler.


Also you need to know how to get damage from the little tiny incidental hits. Abare it's called in other games I think. You need to halfway be able to convert your giant buttons and specials into damage.

Now I'm not going to blame a country for the words of one man, nor for the screams of some football hooligans or fanatics, that's an emotionally charged situation and people can say dumb shit they regret. But the fact that fans feel it's an okay thing to make monkey noises, or a commentator of the game (!) To even say something like that.....fuck

But the fact is in many countries, the fans would self regulate. That type of talk would be stamped out. In an American football game, it would be stamped out violently.  Which isn't better.

  Mostly what I'm worried about from this is that 800 year old Lukaku  cant be stopped by a professional soccer team. I mean shit, yeah hes big and sorta fast still but hes fuckin ancient.

Of course. And I wasnt tryin to diminish the faults of the US at the time... we own it, at least to some degree. Just trying to make a point to say that some stuff still happens overseas.



Hell up until the mid 60s there was a famous book (actually made a GREAT movie about it), The (negro motorists) Green Book, which basically was a guidebook for black people traveling across the US; it was basically a book of places black folks could be safe on the road: lodgings, garages, gas stations.

Shit still happens in France too.  Is mocking and being racist towards a visiting athlete the same as a governmental suppression of an entire people? No of course not. But it does paint a picture. 

Now I grant you that is a minority of countries and you dont hear stuff like that in western Europe nowadays (aside from italy). But its 2020 now... i wonder what it was like 70 years ago in the rest of Europe. I would be surprised if there was a huge difference between the US and the rest of the west."

Its like, you know how stereotypical 'good looking stay at home moms' do yoga and spin class?  That trope in movies or whatever. That's how stereotypical fit nerds do bouldering. They call random large rocks a 'problem' and stuff like that. Every IT department needs to have a bouldering night.


For some reason they just gravitated toward bouldering, probably cause they're light as fuck..maybe cause they got well developed forearms from pressing them cherry switches on the mechanical keyboard.  Like half my IT department goes bouldering.  Of the leftovers, like a quarter are huge behemoths who can lift my house and the rest are fat like me.  The fat guys and the skinny guys arent fun.

Everything doesnt have to be powered all the time. If you want to get really really technical, the game is about power management. Do you need another layer of shields or should I put power into engines?"
