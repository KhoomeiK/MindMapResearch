>There’s another, potentially bigger problem though. Cook “corrected” the results of the surveys to adjust for the fact that per capita alcohol sales in the U.S. were more than double what respondents the survey showed. To make the correction he simply doubled the amount each respondent claimed to have drunk. As, Trevor Butterworth of Forbes [has explained](http://www.forbes.com/sites/trevorbutterworth/2014/10/02/when-data-journalism-goes-wrong/), this approach assumes that:  
>  
>The more respondents said they drank, the more wrong they were. For example, if you said you had one drink, Cook’s multiplier would put you down for two–not a huge difference. But if you said you drank 14 beers a week, under Cook’s system that would be 28 total drinks;  
>  
>Every non-drinker was being entirely honest/accurate (since two times zero is still zero), it’s only the drinkers who are fibbing/misremembering;  
>  
>None of the extra alcohol is being consumed by high school kids, since the survey only counted adults;  
>  
>All the alcohol sold is being consumed.
