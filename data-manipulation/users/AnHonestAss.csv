The guys’ face was split in two basically and from what I read a few years ago on the internet they tried to save him but it was a miracle he even survived the first few hours, so there was nothing they could do."

Saudi Royals are billionaires and they’re not really working, as they can’t be fired. Your perception of money is a bit skewed imho"

ChoosingBeggars,fddbwms,t1_fddaqv9,1578304711.0,Yeah but calling someone who gave you a GIFT a “bitch” is also an overreaction

AskReddit,fd73okc,t1_fd6zh3o,1578199027.0,"Please stop spamming all of my answers. In rare cases - yes, but not in most. A chance of negative side effects isn’t too bad for a convicted pedophile or a serial rapist."
AskReddit,fd6nbq2,t1_fd5pfxb,1578193396.0,Then the process would be reversed so there is no problem
AskReddit,fd6n77k,t1_fd5sdyy,1578193356.0,"Your comment would be applicable IF chemical castration was irreversible. However chemical castration IS a reversible process that simply gets rid of sexual libido while the hormone shots are taken. 

Reddit, please do your research just a little bit before forming a strong opinion.

AskReddit,fd6m8zc,t1_fd69rrt,1578193034.0,It is reversible
AskReddit,fd6lyju,t1_fd5ynzn,1578192926.0,But how is this applicable to chemical castration which is NOT permanent?

WritingPrompts,fczcjkx,t1_fcz9b0m,1578098187.0,That’s strange. Using that word to mean “upright” is genuinely quite common. I read a lot and it seems to pop up here and there.

offmychest,fc4j6up,t1_fc4iwuo,1577418210.0,"Well I see how it is. Then going by your logic, I just think it’s funny how you guys think the only thing we’re seeking are “tall attractive athletic white men” and that emotional or sexual connection is not important to us. Clearly reinforces the fact that all you care about is looks. 

Thankfully I’m not going by your logic, and yes I have a fair share of the stereotypical handsome men after me, luckily I have options and I’m not here to “get one”, I don’t want a relationship, and he can get who he wants too. I just want to find a way to break it to him that I don’t think I want to sleep with him. Im not obligated to because of his looks, that’s for sure."
offmychest,fc4iqv4,t1_fc4ilts,1577417837.0,"So you mean “women”? Excuse me, but how does my situation apply to anyone else? Why would you group me together with others? 

Also, yes, the guy is amazing but everyone has their own flaws or moments of incompatibility so i think that me wanting a fulfilling sexual relationship isn’t too much to ask for."

movies,fbrxdm8,t1_fbq4mka,1577047411.0,Actually they allow nightly tours with photographs. You’re usually led alone in a small group of up to ten people per night and you’re given hours to explore it without being bothered by other tourists.
