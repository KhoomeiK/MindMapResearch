JoeRogan,ff95i12,t3_es6plo,1579705318.0,400 replies and the same four photos over and over... big bloody whoop.
politics,ff8yi0d,t3_es5ufe,1579700126.0,Republicans votes 48 times to repeal Obamacare. I think it’s time for the House Dems to Impeach Trump every other week and just completely tie up the senate. If the senate can’t do any other business then Trumps agenda will be stalled
politics,ff6yor6,t3_ervkpb,1579637610.0,"Back in 2016 when the media was dumping all those stupid ""Bernie Bros"" stories, I saw HRC and Albright give a speech where Albright said, ""There is a special place in Hell for women who don't vote for other women..."" HRC laughed like a hyena.  Talk about sexist.  


It came out that the ""Bernie Bro"" moniker was coined by HRC as a way to claim sexism against her. She tried the same thing in 2008 by alleging sexism in the Obama camp with the term ""Obama Boys"".  That didn't last long because someone quickly released that calling a black man's supporters ""boys"" wasn't a good look.  Had they been smart enough to come up Obama Bros then we would have heard these same charges leveled against Obama.   


I volunteered for the Sanders campaign and almost all the volunteers were women.  They had us men easily beat by 2 to 1.  So much for the ""sexist"" Sanders campaign.   


Finally, I was told on social media by HRC supporters to ""shut up"" that they didn't care what men had to say and several of them told me that I wasn't a ""real"" democrat and they ddin't need my vote or support... and then after the election they blamed us for HRC's loss because we ""didn't support her"".  


I am completely and utterly disgusted with HRC.  I never supported all those comments that she should just ""shut up and go away"", now I couldn't agree more.  This self-important harridan needs to shut her yap and go away."

politics,feyjiy8,t3_eqqtku,1579446328.0,Of course Trump can’t understand why he’s getting impeached; he’s so fucking stupid that he actually believes all the Faux News conspiracy garbage about the Clintons murdering people and Obama breaking the law that he honestly thinks Presidents are given carte blanch to break the law.
whiskey,fev4rm4,t3_eqjgfi,1579393068.0,I dig it. Mine started out just like that.
