Like a reassurance that we're right there and that people will have to ask before petting/approaching, and she's so much more chill standing next to some stranger while on a tight leash than being free... She basically just cowers and growls and avoids them, in the latter scenario.  She's the sweetest, most loving dog, she just has trust issues and doesn't know how to express that love to outaiders; she's just a testament to each dog being unique lol"
