On reflection, it's not like we don't have a similar situation in the west it's just less overt -- people with money don't spend time in jail waiting for court dates, can hire lawyers to defend them adequately, and are often given much lighter sentences being that they're often viewed to be more upstanding citizens than people of lesser means.

My mom's cousins were a more extreme version of OP's family -- the parents are hardcore quiverfull evangelicals and of the 7 kids only 3 of them are anywhere near normal and have a lot of social and psychological problems from their upnringing  -- the one who is the closest to being normal is gay and was disowned by everyone in the family except for the other 2 ok-ish siblings, and even that person still has a lot of stuff they're trying to work through like all they've been taught from their parents about things like race, class, sexuality, and spirituality.

All of them were completely home-schooled from preschool through high school, and the ones who went to college have gone to ultra-conservative private christian colleges. Most of the boys went into the ministry and all but one of the girls went to a christian college and then dropped out once they found a husband so they could start their own giant families.

The majority of the kids aren't able to socialize with people outside their immediate family well, especially if the other person is of a different race or nationality, and can't really even hold a normal conversation. Many of them are completely intolerant of ideas, values, or viewpoints outside of what their parents indoctrinated into them for years and years. They're not permitted to listen to music unless it's christian music, and some of them had never seen a movie that wasn't some kind of religious propaganda until they got to college.

They used to go on trips to 3rd world countries to go build churches and stuff like that, and once when I was about 15 they came out with about 4 of their kids and stayed with my family for a few days to visit before moving on to their missionary work in Mexico. It happened to be during Passover and my father is Jewish, so we invited them all to join in our Seder. The mom was horribly offended by the offer and wasn't even content to not participate -- she and her husband took the 3 kids they had with them and left the house for the evening because she didn't even want them \*in the same house\* during Jewish customs or prayers. There's one girl who is around my age and I remember asking her if she enjoyed their trips, and she just looked at me blankly and said in a very creepy way ""\*\*It's always fun when Jesus is involved.\*\*"" and I think that was the point when I stopped trying to hang out with her for the rest of their time with us."

I had to give up my cat to another family a few years back because as much as I loved him, I realized that it wasn't fair to him for me to keep him -- I was working long hours and lived alone, and he would spend most of his days sleeping in a dark corner of the bathroom until I arrived home, when I would only have a couple hours to hang out with him. A coworker and his wife had just lost their cat from old age and were looking to get another, as they had a small dog who also missed having a friend around. It was really hard to let him go, but I know he's having a much better life with them then I could have given him at the time -- he even loves the dog more than the dog was prepared for, and loves having another animal to play with and follows the dog around everywhere.  

My boyfriend and now live across the country (and I wouldn't want to tear my cat away from his new loving home again) and just got a Chihuahua a few months ago whom we love dearly, but is so much work I'm glad we waited until we were both in a spot where we could devote a lot of time and energy into caring for a pet."

Every guy I've ever dated I knew for some time before as friends, whether that was a few weeks or 5 years (in the latter case, we both liked each other pretty early on but were dating other people at the time so never pursued anything past friendship). The getting to know the guy is what takes it from ""he's cute"" or ""he's fun"" to ""i want to be with him"" for me. If I was single now I don't think I would participate in online dating apps or websites or the whole process of dates...that just doesn't really appeal to me and it just feels strange to base initial decisions off of a few pictures and a short bio, and I've also never really been interested in hookups.

Obviously, I find ripped dudes attractive but it's not a requirement whatsoever. I've dated dudes with many body types: beanpole skinny with little muscle, ""average"" with a little muscle tone, overweight with a bit of a gut, and only one guy I've dated was very athletic and toned, though he didn't have a 6-pack or anything just muscular from being very active. Two were completely bald and one was missing a hand, so far from what I'd think of my ideal male partner. In some cases I had an instant physical attraction to the guy, but in others I was more attracted to their personalities and didn't care that their body wasn't perfect, just as I hope my partners do for me. 

That said, I don't think I would ever date someone \*significantly\* overweight (the biggest dude I dated was about 230lbs at 5'10"")...not only would I have a hard time finding them very attractive even if we meshed really well otherwise, but it shows that they would have a lifestyle incompatible with mine, as I would want someone who'd be able to walk around the city with me, or travel and explore, or go to the gym together, and who would at least respect my fitness goals and choices, if not participate in them alongside me.  


Full disclosure, I've never used any online dating services or Tinder. The way that many people find each other now with technology really promotes shallowness -- oftentimes you know very little about a person and are largely judging on the photos they post.  If I had been looking at profiles for the guys I've dated, maybe half of them I'd think were cute, but I probably wouldn't have ever messaged them/swiped right if I'd only seen photos and a profile online if I was just judging based on looks and a short bio. Being someone who's interesting and fun and can make me laugh is what takes a guy from ""yeah he's cute"" to ""I want him to be mine."""
