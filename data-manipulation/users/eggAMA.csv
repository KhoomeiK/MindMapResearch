news,fdk55s0,t1_fdjgu5q,1578496298.0,I’m a believer in the laffer curve: if you lower taxes your tax revenue may potentially rise due to a growing tax base
news,fdjfsci,t1_fdjfjr5,1578468930.0,"Way too much spending. I’m for a small federal government with minimal power and reach and more authority to be given to the states. I like Bernie as a person, but every concept he says is more $$$. Trumps no angel, the deficit under him has been terrible. I can’t imagine it getting worse, and that’s the main reason I don’t support him.

Also, recently it seems he’s not only been criticizing the rich ( which I support to the extent that there’s massive corruption in the states and there should definitely be scrutiny) but villianization of them as well. The wealth tax, ‘there should be no billionaires’ is something I can’t really stomach."

news,fdjezea,t1_fdjeoau,1578467996.0,"Jesus, and then people wonder why swing voters vote for trump huh.

I don’t have a fox subscription. I don’t get my “news” from YouTube. It’s simply a video from a consumer journalist who compares the difference in spending between different candidates.

I’m not a red cap. I vote every election based on the candidates. Neither am I a “vote blue no matter who” shill.

I seriously don’t get it. I replied to a simple post commenting on whether or not an Iran war is going to affect any previous trump supporters into changing their votes. I stated why I’m doing so, haven’t been rude to anybody yet I’m being insulted on every side and being called an idiot."

news,fdjde60,t1_fdjd5eu,1578466202.0,"Straw that brakes the camels back? I have no pleasure in casting my vote for him if it happens, but I vote election to election based on which candidate would be best for me.

I was team Obama in 2008, but he made a lot of dumb decisions so I wasn’t completely on the bandwagon. I probably would vote for him over trump tho.

In terms of the war thing, I’m a Muslim. I’ve seen countries where my family reside be destroyed by the war on terror. Even under Obama tons of terrible stuff like that happened. I supported trump over Hilary mainly because of her history as a war monger. If trump stays true to his promises and stays out of conflict, he not terrible enough for me to switch my vote or abstain. If he does, well he’s gone for me."
news,fdjd58h,t1_fdjcwnw,1578465939.0,"I am libertarian, but in the short term I can’t imagine throwing away my vote, as much as I hate to say it, as the us is a two party state. It’s more of a lesser of two evils type thing. John stossel did a decent breakdown of the increases in spending planned by all major candidates: https://youtu.be/XA3b-omI5mE"
news,fdjd1gu,t1_fdjcvvx,1578465828.0,Lol it’s these types of stupid reactions from people that pushes me away from the Democratic Party. Hur dur of you’re a republican you must be a soulless monster who only cares about themselves and no one else. I donate to charity. I volunteer. I care about people too. I just also happen to believe there are diminishing returns from welfare and the likes.
