fatlogic,fexjvbi,t3_eqtmpn,1579432166.0,"Actually I have a good friend who has almost the BMI of an obese person but he's fit and lean. So yeah sometimes BMI is not accurate.
However he runs everyday and does HEMA (it can be pretty hardcore sometimes) so unless you're doing A LOT of sports, and I mean intense sports not some yoga or walking, your BMI is probably accurate. 

Also, it may seem dumb but ... At a certain point we don't need BMI to know if we're too fat. You don't need to know you have a BMI of 34 to know you're too fat, just look in the mirror, just pay attention to your hurting knees and back and lack of breath."
fatlogic,fej9y61,t3_ep3w7r,1579163403.0,"Ah ... Honestly, they promote intuitive eating, not counting calories, etc ... This is natural indeed, this is how it should work. However we are in 2020. Processed food is everywhere, high in sugar, high in fat ... It all happened very quick. Maybe in like 50 ... Or even 100 years we will be able to eat junk, not count calories and still be healthy. Maybe.
But for now we have to adapt. Our body is not used to this new diet yet so we have to watch the quality and quantity of food. It's not deprivation or disordered eating. It's adaptation. It's the way I see it. We certainly won't turn back and stop make processed and junk food so we must adapt."

I see a band, with only boys in it. Boys that most would qualify as attractive. This description applies to each band. So ... Ye, don't the difference since I only know one of the two."
