Documentaries,fffumd5,t1_fffsjbh,1579892149.0,"I mean the image was popular in the late 60's when Guevara was executed. Not sure when the t-shirts first started but I'm fairly certain the Che chic shirt was cliche by the 90's and universally recognized as a joke by mid 00's.

I wouldn't expect to see anyone wearing one in the last 15 years"
gaming,ffeawb1,t1_ffeaqqo,1579841622.0,Lol that explains the vitriol then
gaming,ffeakrg,t1_ffe8gv8,1579841341.0,Noice. So it's not a fun game then?  That's a shame.
gaming,ffeaioc,t1_ffe8k9a,1579841289.0,"The joke was that, no, I did not play the game but felt strongly enough to give my opinion despite how useless or unfounded it may be."
gaming,ffe869u,t1_ffe7u0p,1579839325.0,"The hope would be to indicate that my entire comment is pointless and not to be taken seriously.  I gave a strong review for a game I hadn't played. It's a joke. Some people got it, others got mad. I find the latter amusing."
gaming,ffe7uv1,t1_ffe7itn,1579839068.0,I thought I made some points there. Am I wrong?
gaming,ffe7spw,t1_ffe7qs4,1579839019.0,"Thank you for clearing that up, I had no idea"
gaming,ffe7c5e,t1_ffe64nr,1579838649.0,Lol I didnt. Just wanted to put some bullshit out there and see if it sticks. I tried to make it clear with my disclaimer though.
gaming,ffe7605,t1_ffe6c8g,1579838513.0,Ah yes fellow reviewer! What did you think of Death Stranding?
gaming,ffe70g9,t1_ffe5jsf,1579838392.0,My voice deserves to be heard.
gaming,ffe6myc,t1_ffe5s10,1579838099.0,Was hoping the last sentence would tip people off but alas...

gaming,ffe4yoe,t1_ffe4c1k,1579836826.0,"Let me also chime in as someone who's never played it.  It's a great game, but for intangible reasons.  When describing it, yes, it sounds a bit drab--but at the same time its satisfying, its relaxing, but most importantly its *immersive*. Honestly it's difficult to put the controller down."
Frasier,ffdjgmd,t1_ffctbbf,1579822169.0,That's a fancy way of spelling *duck a l'orange*
oddlysatisfying,ffaxxyq,t1_ffaqyg7,1579747068.0,Your love is all I'll ever need :)
oddlysatisfying,ff9onyl,t1_ff9g5r4,1579717423.0,"Just walk into a room with this guy and next thing you know, his balls snuck their way between yours! Absolutely ridiculous

EDIT: a word"
todayilearned,ff93nci,t1_ff920j7,1579704049.0,"Also of note: surrender is a great thing and should be encouraged if you are the likely victor. Less of men are killed, less stuff is destroyed, everybody gets to take off work early etc."
SweatyPalms,ff6ekda,t1_ff6a0u4,1579625489.0,"In short, itll burn you almost as quickly as if you grabbed with bare hands.

If it's a thick oven mit  that got a light spray from the sink, you might get away with it just feeling really really warm, but a  normal kitchen towel will make you drop the food on the floor."
lotrmemes,ff60eds,t1_ff5z8yr,1579615891.0,"Yeah but they're sweet.

AskReddit,fewoauh,t1_fewlxif,1579416908.0,Some heathens boil hot dogs to cook them.  The left over water is the liquid in question.
AskReddit,fewo667,t1_fewm8yi,1579416763.0,You think it's easy getting to the big leagues?  Dog Water Chuggin' ain't easy at a pro level.
ChildrenFallingOver,few8527,t1_few7t5z,1579406742.0,I'm wondering if theres a soft bag/cushion on the ground as a safety measure and he just gleefully flops down on it.
aww,fev9uel,t1_fev9h49,1579394879.0,I think I made it to the second paragraph before the alerts in my head went off.  I'm just too paranoid at this point.  Every three paragraph response is a red flag now.
