""Republicans"" is a detail, really.  When the Republican party dies (it seems the most likely to go), the new replacement party will either fill the 'conservative' void, or will sprout to the left of the Democrats, and push them into the conservative role.

You are probably confusing the details of today's issues with the bigger concept of progressive vs conservative.  Yes, when you introduce some 'landmark' issues to people when they are young, they will get a lot of support because young people tend to be more progressive.  And as they age, support for *those issues* won't wane. But the *tendency* towards conservatism in a lot of people will show in the *new* issues that are making waves in the future.

So I was just reading a book, and it was by a non-crazy animal researcher, and she was seriously talking about moving towards some type of 'personhood' for many animals, in contrast to our current legal system which has for millennia treated all animals as 'property'. To hear the case for it, it makes sense . . . I doubt many people today view animals as unthinking automatons like they did back in the 1700's.  And one of the logical endpoints of following this line of thought was the total banishment of the idea of pet ownership.

Now imagine *that*, not today's social issues. Forty years from now, and the oldest Millennials are entering their 70's, and the hot issue is pushing for some type of legal 'personhood' for animals, and the outlawing of household pets.  All the young kids are for it . . . it's been brewing since the 2040's, and 80% of under 30's think that pet ownership should be banned.

Do you think all those Millennials are going to stick to their ""progressive"" roots, when the current day ""progressives"" are talking about outlawing their *fur babies*?  

No, they'd be hollering about how the new generation are a bunch of degenerates, or something, and fighting it tooth and nail.  And being called 'barbaric' or something by the kids.

People are divided into ""conservative"" and ""progressive"" mindsets. Don't tell me that you don't know people who fit those molds. And when push comes to shove, nearly everybody picks one side or the other.  And based on most political results you see, the division between the sides is very close to 50-50.

Boomers have the same 50-50 split as every other age group. And Republicans are just the current 'legitimate' party catering the the 'conservative' 50%.  When the Boomers die, they'll be replaced by the next generation who looks just like the last generation.  And when the Republicans finally dissolve, they'll be replaced *by another party that is fundamentally conservative, in some form or another*.

Without a bass instrument playing, you're relying on the voicings and context of the other notes played or sung to define the chord structure. A typical bass line should unambiguously define the chords, *particularly* when the bass note is ambiguous or unexpected. If the progression calls for a **Eb9/C**, then I would expect the bass to focus on **C**, and would be unhappy if they played mostly **Eb**, for example.  Even simple bass tricks like playing a pedal tone across multiple chords or chromatically descending lines add a lot of complexity to chord structures.

Not to mention, sonically and even physically bass frequencies *get our attention* when they're prominent . . . they really stroke that ""move"" button.  So a rhythmic bass line will also reinforce or *define* the groove of a piece overall."

I did and couldn't find anything saying that the ""debunking"" was debunked.

What I *did* find were a few *terrible* articles that took the totally simplistic and thoroughly debunked value of 79 cents per dollar and ran with it, using the same flawed calculation to see how that 79 cents overall compared with the value for different ages groups, minorities, and geographic regions. Oh, they also had a section on ""other things"" that might account for the gap.  Of course those included ""occupational segregation"" and ""caregiver responsibilities"".

Nothing at all about what the jobs were, how much experience workers had, how much education, whether they worked overtime . . . the thinks that *actually* determine how much money you make.

Of course, if you read the actual scholarly paper that introduced the 79 cents per dollar figure, you'd know that they *did* account for all of these things, further in the write-up.  By the end of the same paper, after accounting for things like actual job, experience, education, and hours worked, the female-to-male gap was reduced to (I believe) 94 cents per dollar. 

In the same paper that floated the 79 cents per dollar figure.  Meaning that anyone who *used* or *uses* 79 cents per dollar either failed to read past the first page of the actual paper, or chose to ignore it's actual conclusions and instead push a false agenda.

I'd say that it's a function of how our ears 'hear' or 'process' sound, but they're not really doing anything *improper*. We hear mid- and high-frequency sounds much better than low-frequency. If you listen to a complex sound (sawtooth, pulse . . . anything but a sine) with a low fundamental and start dropping the frequency, the fundamental eventually starts to recede and fades out of hearing, but all the high frequency stuff remains.  At a certain point, your brain entirely loses track of the fundamental as a tone, and starts treating the rest of the signal as a series of discrete higher-frequency bursts, repeating at the fundamental frequency. Basically, a bunch of fast clicks or pings.

For reference, a 20 Hz tone is equivalent to 32nd notes played at 150 bpm.  Fast, but discernible.

Maybe this is suboptimal for listening to music, but for living in the natural world, it's probably just as easy to recognize, categorize, and react to a series of clicks as it could be to an equivalent low-frequency note, if we could hear it."

PoliticalHumor,fdkwfaq,t1_fdkf4gu,1578512556.0,"Yes, you point out some valid concerns. Personally, I don't think ""income inequality"" or even ""wealth inequality"" are that much of a concern. I think we would be much better off concentrating on a dysfunctional corporate ecosystem, which is a bigger problem. How much I make at my job -- and how much the CEO and Executive VPs make -- is not determined by a cabal of *billionaires* sitting in a dark back room. The decisions to unfairly distribute the results of the *huge* productivity gains mostly to CEOs and high-level executives was made by Corporate Management and by Boards of Directors.  And remember . . . while those guys are *rich*, they are generally *not* billionaires.  Bezos is a billionaire because he *owns a shitload of valuable Amazon stock*, not because he's CEO.  Same with Bill Gates.  The ridiculously wealthy came from either 1) recent explosions in the valuation of new firms like Amazon, Google, and Facebook; or 2) inherited wealth from earlier generations.  

The fact that we are now so focused on *billionaires* seem to me to be the problem.  Billionaires are not the cause of the problems, and billionaires will *not* be the solution to the problem.  Jeff Bezos being a billionaire has *nothing* to do with whether or not Amazon paid any taxes last year; that's *entirely* a corporate and tax issue.  Squeezing every *billionaire* dry will not pay for all the shit being proposed by the loonies in the Democratic running.

Address the tax code, so it's not a loophole ridden mess that allows ""pay to win"".  Address corporate governance, so it's not a circlejerk of giving each other ridiculous pay packages.  Those changes would be great, and would surely help the economy *and* the people.

But no . . . *those* things are hard.  *Those* things will piss people off.  So they won't get tackled.  It's much easier to vilify a small group of people -- in this case, ""billionaires"" -- and tell *everyone* that all the pain will be on them.  The problem with this is, it won't be enough, so the bar will start to be lowered.  I mean, by your own logic, you can take away half of Bezos wealth, and he won't ""feel it"".  Well, you could probably take half the wealth of everybody who's worth $200 Million, and *they* wouldn't feel it, either.  You can bet that they're next in the plan.  And after that . . . who really *needs* $50 million?  Or $25 Million?

PoliticalHumor,fdg31tf,t1_fdfpt1j,1578378162.0,"Fundamentally I boil Socialist policies down to ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"".  Every person is expected to contribute to ""Society"" in the most efficient, valuable way they can. ""Society"" then fairly distributes all of these contributions to the population, insuring that every individual's needs are met. This is a wonderful fantasy system, nicely suited to classic science fiction stories.  Mainly because in classic scifi, writers assumed technology would save us and provide us with *infinite energy* and thus *infinite resources* generally. It's easy to imagine a happy socialist society when magic technology allows everyone to have anything and everything they desire. Because of technology, no one really *needs* to contribute; it's purely voluntary and is seen as an added benefit to humanity. And also because of the same technology, everybody's needs are fully met, regardless of how much they -- or anyone else -- contributes.

In reality, though, we don't have infinite resources. To get more ""stuff"" (meaning everything, including services like medical care) we *must* have more effort from the population. The effort can either be more people (of course, then you have more people to take care of), harder work by the people, or *smarter* work from the people. This is the world that we live in, and there's nothing we can do to change this.  Because of this reality, we must acknowledge that since ""more stuff"" comes from ""more work"" or ""smarter work"", that means that ""less work"" and ""less smart"" invariably lead to ""less stuff"".  Remember that.

So . . . I believe that Socialism goes against many of humanities' basic instincts, such as 1) Primacy of the self then the immediate family then the extended family or tribe (if *everybody* is starving, and *I* have an apple . . . I'm going to eat it; if I have five apples, I'm going to feed my wife and children; if I have a bushel, *then* I'll feed the clan); 2) Expecting greater rewards for greater efforts (since this is hard work *and* better technique, I'll just say that if I bring home two deer per week for food, and *you* bring home one rabbit per week, then I expect to eat better than you do); and 3) Respect for personal ownership of self and property (keep your hands off me, and keep your hands off *my* shit). Socialism wants everyone to treat everyone else as equivalent to themselves, optimally.  If I have one apple, I should give it to ""Society"", so ""Society"" can insure it goes to the person with the greatest need.  If I hunt like a madman and bring home most of the food, I should be happy to eat exactly the same meal as my lazy brother, who sits under the tree most days. There is no such thing as ""my stuff"" or even ""my*self*"", because everything *and everybody* belongs to ""Society"".

Because of this fundamental disconnect, Socialism cannot be implemented *in groups larger than an extended family or tribe* without some type of coercive government to overrule those instincts and *force* people to comply with the requirements.  Lets be honest . . . in *any* society there will be people who will kill for family; there will be *plenty* of people who bring home *lots* of deer and *do not* want to eat (or live) like the poorest in society; and nearly *everybody* wants ownership over themselves and their property.  Also, let's address the previously mentioned ""Society"" that's supposed to take everybody's contributions, and redistribute them *fairly* to everyone *according to their needs*.  Who or what exactly *does* this? Obviously, it must be a branch of that coercive government that does it. So it seems that to really implement Socialism on a scale bigger than a kibbutz, you'll need a large, powerful, *coercive* government.

Let's face it . . . unless you believe that every single human being in equivalent (equivalent in capability, not equal in value) to every other one, then you *must* realize that this system *rewards* the lazy and the incompetent, and *punishes* the intelligent and hard working. We've already discussed on ""more work"" and ""more intelligence"" end up providing ""Society"" with ""more stuff"".  Even if ""Society"" *owns* everything, and each individual is left with nothing but his mind and his hands, there will be people who produce MUCH more than most do, and probably (if Pareto is right) about 20% who produce 80% of the output.  Not because they're ""privileged"".  Not because they ""had a head start"", or any other anti-capitalist excuse.  There will be people who do most of the work, and create most of the ""stuff"", and in general, *they will be pissed if they live the same life as the bottom 20% of the population, who probably produce NOTHING*.

So is actual, ""real-world"" socialism exactly what I said?  No, but it certainly *tries* to be what I said, and totally *ignores* all the reasons why in the real world it can't work.  So I don't even want to start leaning in that direction.  And let's not forget . . . those times that it *has* been tried on a large scale, it *has* lead to huge, coercive, *oppressive* governments that have ended up killing *millions* of their own citizens via inadvertent starvation to outright murder.

TL;DR . . . Socialism fundamentally sucks as a philosophy unless you are part of the bottom half of society, because it will always unfairly take from the productive to support the unproductive.  And it can never be implemented in the real world without a gun to the population's head."

To hear the case for it, it makes sense . . . I doubt many people today view animals as unthinking automatons like they did back in the 1700's.  And one of the logical endpoints of following this line of thought was the total banishment of the idea of pet ownership.

Now imagine *that*, not today's social issues. Forty years from now, and the oldest Millennials are entering their 70's, and the hot issue is pushing for some type of legal 'personhood' for animals, and the outlawing of household pets.  All the young kids are for it . . . it's been brewing since the 2040's, and 80% of under 30's think that pet ownership should be banned.

Do you think all those Millennials are going to stick to their ""progressive"" roots, when the current day ""progressives"" are talking about outlawing their *fur babies*?  

No, they'd be hollering about how the new generation are a bunch of degenerates, or something, and fighting it tooth and nail.  And being called 'barbaric' or something by the kids.

Without a bass instrument playing, you're relying on the voicings and context of the other notes played or sung to define the chord structure. A typical bass line should unambiguously define the chords, *particularly* when the bass note is ambiguous or unexpected. If the progression calls for a **Eb9/C**, then I would expect the bass to focus on **C**, and would be unhappy if they played mostly **Eb**, for example.  Even simple bass tricks like playing a pedal tone across multiple chords or chromatically descending lines add a lot of complexity to chord structures.

Of course, if you read the actual scholarly paper that introduced the 79 cents per dollar figure, you'd know that they *did* account for all of these things, further in the write-up.  By the end of the same paper, after accounting for things like actual job, experience, education, and hours worked, the female-to-male gap was reduced to (I believe) 94 cents per dollar.

I'd say that it's a function of how our ears 'hear' or 'process' sound, but they're not really doing anything *improper*. We hear mid- and high-frequency sounds much better than low-frequency. If you listen to a complex sound (sawtooth, pulse . . . anything but a sine) with a low fundamental and start dropping the frequency, the fundamental eventually starts to recede and fades out of hearing, but all the high frequency stuff remains.  At a certain point, your brain entirely loses track of the fundamental as a tone, and starts treating the rest of the signal as a series of discrete higher-frequency bursts, repeating at the fundamental frequency. Basically, a bunch of fast clicks or pings.

For reference, a 20 Hz tone is equivalent to 32nd notes played at 150 bpm.  Fast, but discernible.

Maybe this is suboptimal for listening to music, but for living in the natural world, it's probably just as easy to recognize, categorize, and react to a series of clicks as it could be to an equivalent low-frequency note, if we could hear it."

PoliticalHumor,fdkwfaq,t1_fdkf4gu,1578512556.0,"Yes, you point out some valid concerns. Personally, I don't think ""income inequality"" or even ""wealth inequality"" are that much of a concern. I think we would be much better off concentrating on a dysfunctional corporate ecosystem, which is a bigger problem. How much I make at my job -- and how much the CEO and Executive VPs make -- is not determined by a cabal of *billionaires* sitting in a dark back room. The decisions to unfairly distribute the results of the *huge* productivity gains mostly to CEOs and high-level executives was made by Corporate Management and by Boards of Directors.  And remember . . . while those guys are *rich*, they are generally *not* billionaires.  Bezos is a billionaire because he *owns a shitload of valuable Amazon stock*, not because he's CEO.  Same with Bill Gates.  The ridiculously wealthy came from either 1) recent explosions in the valuation of new firms like Amazon, Google, and Facebook; or 2) inherited wealth from earlier generations.  

The fact that we are now so focused on *billionaires* seem to me to be the problem.  Billionaires are not the cause of the problems, and billionaires will *not* be the solution to the problem.  Jeff Bezos being a billionaire has *nothing* to do with whether or not Amazon paid any taxes last year; that's *entirely* a corporate and tax issue.  Squeezing every *billionaire* dry will not pay for all the shit being proposed by the loonies in the Democratic running.

Address the tax code, so it's not a loophole ridden mess that allows ""pay to win"".  Address corporate governance, so it's not a circlejerk of giving each other ridiculous pay packages.  Those changes would be great, and would surely help the economy *and* the people.

But no . . . *those* things are hard.  *Those* things will piss people off.  So they won't get tackled.  It's much easier to vilify a small group of people -- in this case, ""billionaires"" -- and tell *everyone* that all the pain will be on them.  The problem with this is, it won't be enough, so the bar will start to be lowered.  I mean, by your own logic, you can take away half of Bezos wealth, and he won't ""feel it"".  Well, you could probably take half the wealth of everybody who's worth $200 Million, and *they* wouldn't feel it, either.  You can bet that they're next in the plan.  And after that . . . who really *needs* $50 million?  Or $25 Million?

Where does it stop?  Does it come all the way down to ""he's got $2 Million in his 401K; **no one needs that much to retire**, so let's take half...""?  If you're putting people's heads on a pike for being successful, where do you stop?

As we've already established . . . there are a *lot* of people with a lot less than that in this country.

PoliticalHumor,fdg31tf,t1_fdfpt1j,1578378162.0,"Fundamentally I boil Socialist policies down to ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"".  Every person is expected to contribute to ""Society"" in the most efficient, valuable way they can. ""Society"" then fairly distributes all of these contributions to the population, insuring that every individual's needs are met. This is a wonderful fantasy system, nicely suited to classic science fiction stories.  Mainly because in classic scifi, writers assumed technology would save us and provide us with *infinite energy* and thus *infinite resources* generally. It's easy to imagine a happy socialist society when magic technology allows everyone to have anything and everything they desire. Because of technology, no one really *needs* to contribute; it's purely voluntary and is seen as an added benefit to humanity. And also because of the same technology, everybody's needs are fully met, regardless of how much they -- or anyone else -- contributes.

In reality, though, we don't have infinite resources. To get more ""stuff"" (meaning everything, including services like medical care) we *must* have more effort from the population. The effort can either be more people (of course, then you have more people to take care of), harder work by the people, or *smarter* work from the people. This is the world that we live in, and there's nothing we can do to change this.  Because of this reality, we must acknowledge that since ""more stuff"" comes from ""more work"" or ""smarter work"", that means that ""less work"" and ""less smart"" invariably lead to ""less stuff"".  Remember that.

So . . . I believe that Socialism goes against many of humanities' basic instincts, such as 1) Primacy of the self then the immediate family then the extended family or tribe (if *everybody* is starving, and *I* have an apple . . . I'm going to eat it; if I have five apples, I'm going to feed my wife and children; if I have a bushel, *then* I'll feed the clan); 2) Expecting greater rewards for greater efforts (since this is hard work *and* better technique, I'll just say that if I bring home two deer per week for food, and *you* bring home one rabbit per week, then I expect to eat better than you do); and 3) Respect for personal ownership of self and property (keep your hands off me, and keep your hands off *my* shit). Socialism wants everyone to treat everyone else as equivalent to themselves, optimally.  If I have one apple, I should give it to ""Society"", so ""Society"" can insure it goes to the person with the greatest need.  If I hunt like a madman and bring home most of the food, I should be happy to eat exactly the same meal as my lazy brother, who sits under the tree most days. There is no such thing as ""my stuff"" or even ""my*self*"", because everything *and everybody* belongs to ""Society"".

Because of this fundamental disconnect, Socialism cannot be implemented *in groups larger than an extended family or tribe* without some type of coercive government to overrule those instincts and *force* people to comply with the requirements.  Lets be honest . . . in *any* society there will be people who will kill for family; there will be *plenty* of people who bring home *lots* of deer and *do not* want to eat (or live) like the poorest in society; and nearly *everybody* wants ownership over themselves and their property.  Also, let's address the previously mentioned ""Society"" that's supposed to take everybody's contributions, and redistribute them *fairly* to everyone *according to their needs*.  Who or what exactly *does* this? Obviously, it must be a branch of that coercive government that does it. So it seems that to really implement Socialism on a scale bigger than a kibbutz, you'll need a large, powerful, *coercive* government.

Let's face it . . . unless you believe that every single human being in equivalent (equivalent in capability, not equal in value) to every other one, then you *must* realize that this system *rewards* the lazy and the incompetent, and *punishes* the intelligent and hard working. We've already discussed on ""more work"" and ""more intelligence"" end up providing ""Society"" with ""more stuff"".  Even if ""Society"" *owns* everything, and each individual is left with nothing but his mind and his hands, there will be people who produce MUCH more than most do, and probably (if Pareto is right) about 20% who produce 80% of the output.  Not because they're ""privileged"".  Not because they ""had a head start"", or any other anti-capitalist excuse.  There will be people who do most of the work, and create most of the ""stuff"", and in general, *they will be pissed if they live the same life as the bottom 20% of the population, who probably produce NOTHING*.

So is actual, ""real-world"" socialism exactly what I said?  No, but it certainly *tries* to be what I said, and totally *ignores* all the reasons why in the real world it can't work.  So I don't even want to start leaning in that direction.  And let's not forget . . . those times that it *has* been tried on a large scale, it *has* lead to huge, coercive, *oppressive* governments that have ended up killing *millions* of their own citizens via inadvertent starvation to outright murder.

TL;DR . . . Socialism fundamentally sucks as a philosophy unless you are part of the bottom half of society, because it will always unfairly take from the productive to support the unproductive.  And it can never be implemented in the real world without a gun to the population's head."

Grip is made from cord-wrapped oak, covered in thin cowhide. Scabbard is a poplar wood core, lined in felt, also covered in thin cowhide.  It has some raised designs under the leather, and all the leather was dyed in dark purple.  The chape and throat are made from mild steel sheet, with a modified capnut and some twisted wire.  Belt and suspension are also purple dyed cowhide, with parts from Tandy Leather.
