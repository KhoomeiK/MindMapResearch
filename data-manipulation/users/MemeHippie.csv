spirituality,ffhi5wb,t1_ffhg63y,1579936323.0,"I used to go through this same hangup. In a nutshell, eventually my picture/view of the universe changed. I came to realize that, it is not some grand scheme, set up for me and only me to be the puppet that experiences all of this, rather I am a part of this environment, this whole universe, and everything is conscious and aware. It only does not seem that way, because my consciousness is localized to me, it is set up that way. And because the “border” of our consciousness is topologically enclosed by the outer boundaries of our skin, we feel alienated from the rest of the world, and we have to work to change our perspective, to feel connected and “one” with the world. Once you’re aware of this, you can do that just by focusing on it."

Crystals,fffrjbp,t1_fffdxs5,1579890239.0,"You’re doing great!!! The difference between chalcedony and agates is like the difference between grains (plant) and pasta. You identified it correctly, agates are just chalcedony with banding, and some would argue that there is obvious banding present here."

explainlikeimfive,ffehqup,t1_ffegd5d,1579848489.0,"It’s not an opinion. You just gave an incorrect answer that didn’t make any sense and didn’t apply, and two people tried to point that out to you. You’re still trying to insist that your first comment was just your opinion, I guess?

Now you’ve made a whole other issue out of whatever that other guy said to you, not even focusing on the original issue at hand. Maybe you changed the subject at hand because you knew the first one was a moot point not worth arguing. 

You’re not gonna get anywhere arguing with me, I still think that your original answer had no relation to the question, and was just you trying to show off your *philosophical wit*, which you probably just learned recently. Thing is, most people don’t think it’s that cool. You have to learn your audience and time/place for that, I’m not trying to be rude Im being honest. You sounded pretentious and like a know-it-all, and were quick to defend yourself when people called you out, and tried to poke holes in any argument they had. 

No need to keep arguing about it, or even reply to me. Like I said, you’re not gonna get anywhere with it. Just learn from this and use it to have easier, better conversations in the future."
explainlikeimfive,ffef9ca,t1_ffef0jn,1579845779.0,"Well first, you’re just trying to be right. You really were wrong on this one, but you are holding onto your mistake and trying to create evidence to say you’re right that isn’t actually there. You don’t have to eat crow and apologize, but the correct thing to do is accept that you were wrong on this one and quit trying to be right, as if for the sake of being right. 

Secondly, you went through someone’s post history just to try to find a morsel of evidence that their character does not line up with a statement they said. That’s not just weird, it’s redundant because people change over time, they may not agree with their past ideas. It’s never something you’d do in real life unless you were trying to win an argument, and at that point you’d be stooping pretty low."

MineralPorn,ffebbwr,t1_ffdzpka,1579842009.0,"This would be extremely expensive because of the time and skill required to facet it, and that it is 100% optical grade quartz. Nearly 99% of quartz is not optical grade, and it’s very expensive for the nice stuff. A 22,000 carat piece of **rough** optical quartz, uncut and unpolished, would cost thousands of dollars.  Optical quartz price has gone up lots in recent years due to carvings becoming more popular"

explainlikeimfive,ffbbahf,t3_esljon,1579758330.0,"Educated guess; the fibers were massively mis-aligned and set out of order when the paper was crumpled, and setting a weight on top of it makes new small “folds” in that fibrous structure that aligns the whole crumpled mess to all fit in that small space, the space between the two surfaces you’re pressing together. I imagine it might actually take some time for the fibers to move into place, not for them to resettle/harden once they are in place."
