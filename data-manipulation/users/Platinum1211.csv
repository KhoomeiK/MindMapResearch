ITManagers,fdhew7g,t3_el26wq,1578421186.0,"In the past 3 years I've opened \~8 new facilities and expansions totalling \~2.5 million square feet (just opened a single 1m sq foot warehouse) - leading IT efforts for each of them. I can tell you I still don't even understand everything. Like others have said, ask questions and soak it all in. You'll make some mistakes and that's OK - just make sure you're covering the basics.

Here's everything from my checklist from the million sq foot facility we opened last year. Note that this also included new hires requirements. The biggest lesson learned for me was to validate low voltage being on the master permit. This really got me good on one install and now I have it as a line item. GC didn't include low voltage in the master permits, didn't know until contractors were nearly ready to pull cable. Delayed us fortunately only 2-3 weeks. Give yourself breathing room on any dates. There WILL be delays either in construction or waiting on materials. You will also forget to order equipment and not realize it until it's install time. The amount of times I ran out of SFP's or properly lengthed cat5e for patching in. Hope this helps.

sysadmin,fcyp11p,t3_ejdswl,1578084189.0,"Depends on how much you're willing to bend for them. 

One option is conditional 2FA - don't prompt for 2FA behind corporate firewalls. Make sure 2FA is required for VPN access. If they want to be able to work from home, they have to use a personal device for 2FA. Otherwise they don't work from home, sorry.

Hard tokens are an option as well. You provide the first one for free, if they lose it they have to pay for a 2nd.

On a side note, as others have mentioned having a cell phone is like having home internet. Nearly everyone has, and they don't ask for reimbursement for their home internet, or electricity when working from home. It's a push notification or for those who don't have smart phones a single SMS. If it's really that big of a deal, have them expense any SMS overages on their phone bill up to 30/31 messages (1 per day) - make sure 2FA is once per day per device. That's if they really want to get picky. What are they going to do, expense a dollar IF they go over their SMS allotment -- which who has that anyway nowadays?"

confession,fcbx8x4,t1_fcapku5,1577591985.0,Disagreed. No way a 12 year old understood he was going to paralyze a kid or should be held to the same standard as an adult. There's a reason kids are treated differently in the eyes of the law.
confession,fcajbil,t1_fca22df,1577570277.0,Dude he was 12. This is kids being kids with serious consequences unfortunately. It's shit like this that gets kids tried as adults and sentenced to long stints in jail before their brains have fully developed to understand consequences. It's not excusing his actions but ffs he was a child.
