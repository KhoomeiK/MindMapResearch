I remember one time when I was 5, we were eating breakfast, and I had just finished peeling my boiled egg. I went to put salt on it and the cap fell off the salt shaker (wasn’t screwed on all the way.) All the salt poured onto my plate and my egg. I immediately started crying (because I knew I’d be in trouble.)

My mom (who was in the kitchen) comes over and says “What did you do??” (Her typical reaction; not “What happened?” or “Is everything alright?” — just would automatically assume everything was MY fault.) I told her what happened, that the cap fell off the salt shaker. She said “I work hard to put food on this table. And this is what you do? You better eat that egg.” So I sat there while she stared at me and I ate the egg. Half a salt shaker’s worth of salt and all. I cried throughout the whole thing. And she sat there until I finished it.

It’s this sort of guilt and shame that leads to negative behaviors later on like OCD, hoarding, overeating, etc. I had this epiphany just a couple weeks ago; we DON’T have to continue any of this bullshit we were brainwashed to do. I literally thought to myself the other day: “I could leave my plate in the sink and not wash it.” So I did. It was such a weird feeling. I was giddy from the excitement, almost like I was rebelling. 

I’m so glad you had this epiphany and wish you many many more, and the strength to continue growing and healing!"

She wishes she could have had something to brag about when she was your age but since she didn’t, YOU are the next best thing. You are her bragging rights she never had."
