Always fight fair and with honour and if you lose then negotiate as favourable terms as you can so that you don't give your opponent reason to take revenge on you.

aoe2,ffcpkuq,t1_ffck812,1579804507.0,"Sure but part of my original point was also that their character is changed.  Persians were not a civ known for archery (not speaking historically here but gameplay wise).  This civ UT fits in much better with a civ like Vietnamese who need a buff anyway and are definitely archery based.

I just don't get why a civ like Persians that was largely fine and nobody complained about got this crazy buff which also has nothing to do with the civs prior identity.  

Meanwhile Viet fans continue to beg for a buff and it seems like a clear opportunity missed.  Nothing about Kamandaran for Persians makes any sense whatsoever."

aoe2,ffc0c18,t3_esnt70,1579788264.0,"The problem with constantly buffing civs is that some other civ is going to drop to the bottom and then need a buff.

But worse than that we'll have civs completely unrecognizable from their original incarnation and character.  Just look at Persians."

But it is unpredictable because for example last year we had a fairly big event called Mangrove Shallows Cup which kinda came out of nowhere.  But then no King of the Desert in December (sadly).  So it kinda fluctuates depending on if a sponsor suddenly jumps up and throws some tournament money down.
