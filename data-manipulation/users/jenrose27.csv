Baking,fdfg50i,t3_el3uem,1578360912.0,"A simple favorite of mine is just the classic Toll House chocolate chip cookie recipe, veganized. Find either Earth Balance or Myoko’s Creamery European style butter (the best!), both at Whole Foods. Then get dark chocolate chunks (really good ones at WF, too, just double check for dairy), and some ground flax seed for the “eggs”.  Mix 2T of that + 6T water to equal two eggs, just let it sit for 15 minutes or so before using them. Proceed as usual! ** I sprinkle a little extra sea salt on top before baking. Salty sweet goodness! **"
