> Facebook and Google apps are among the worst offenders. If you allow iOS to give access to this data, they can and will save it and sell it.

Neither sell your data, *technically,* a fact that both companies will pound, trumpet, shout, and remind you of. Both run very lucrative ad networks in which they allow advertisers to target groups of users who have X interest and believe Y about Z so they can be expected to respond to some message or some product. In many cases, the advertisers themselves are uploading additional data about you in order to target you with surgically precise ads. For example, Target uses your purchase history in store, combined with your credit card data, and uploads you in a list of names and addresses to Facebook saying ""please target this list of users, if they on Facebook, with an ad for X product,"" a practice that provides some of the most intrusive ad experiences on the internet. Seriously, fuck Target. I hope no one ever shops there again.

>  You should assume that any app that asks for access to your photo library, contacts, calendar, microphone, camera, GPS location, etc. can and will use that access to download that data to their servers without your knowledge or consent, and resell it or use it for their own purposes

AmItheAsshole,fcuy25e,t3_eizcvf,1577990810.0,"NTA but it was probably unwise to quote an unrealistically expensive hourly rate for babysitting.

You're comparing apples to oranges. You didn't quote $35 an hour because you're an amazing babysitter, you quoted it because that's (nearly) how much you make coding. That's why your rate seems unfair to your cousin and your husband: it is.

Speaking of unfair, your cousins should not have assumed you'd babysit in the first place. Honestly, they sound kinda sexist. Sounds like they assumed your time was not worth much in part because of your age and gender. Hard to imagine your cousin and her husband making the same assumption that you'd be delighted to babysit for 3 days for $15/hour if you were a 24-year-old guy.

What may have been wiser would have been to know the going rate for babysitting, realize that there was probably no middle ground between babysitting rates and your coding rates, and simply say ""I'm not available to babysit. I have several freelance projects that are important to me and are frankly quite lucrative. I was planning to spend these 3 days maximizing progress on those projects."""
