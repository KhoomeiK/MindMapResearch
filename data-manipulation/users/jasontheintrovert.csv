SuicideWatch,feotyh0,t3_eq6g9o,1579305459.0,"Look, this is the suicide watch subreddit. We are all on our last leg here. I fight every single day trying to stay alive to keep myself from blowing my brains out from my gun.  Nothing you will say here is going to make me think of you any different. 

Judgement here is definitely a waste of time and energy for the majority of us. Explain your situation, so you can get it off your chest and also so I can try to offer some insight. If not, I guess I tried."
SuicideWatch,feohkfx,t3_eq6g9o,1579300284.0,"Going into detail will definitely help us understand the severity of the problem and may offer some advice on the matter. 

We have all been through some crazy stuff, some crazier than others, but trying to work through it by analyzing the entire situation helps a lot. Trust me, you will not be judged here."
Methadone,felticy,t1_felsydg,1579230551.0,"Yes, I have tried to split dose a couple of times, it did not work out for me as I hoped hence why I prefer to dose once and it’s something I prefer. 

In hindsight, my comment was only a rebuttal to the statement the OP made stating: 

“Same.  I don't think that I've heard anyone say ever that they prefer dosing once a day”."
Methadone,fegmal2,t1_feglid4,1579097088.0,"I’ve been on methadone maintenance for exactly 27 months.

My comment to you was  detailing how it effects  and works for ME, and only me -  It wasn’t to compete or one-up you. 

I initiated my dialogue with you because I was more intrigued reading the discussion on how Methadone in general works for different people per the comment thread.

I have a buddy who’s been on maintenance for 15+ years and he takes his single dose early in the morning  and he experiences no withdrawal symptoms whatsoever until it hit 50 hours.  Weird how our body works."
Methadone,fegd8jk,t1_feb76wh,1579088516.0,"Oh lord, don’t get me started on libido while on methadone. I literally have 0 desire to have sex now at my current mg - my partner literally has to beg me every  other 2 weeks. Its a chore to even masturbate whilst indulging in porn. Its like sex is a thing in the past for me. It’s embarrassing..."
Methadone,fegd2xh,t1_feasj9f,1579088326.0,"I believe at the majority of clinics (well, all the ones in GA), you only can jump up 5 -10mg (20 being the cap per week) every couple of days until you are stabilized with your preferred mg. 

It took me about 4 and a half months to stabilize at 120mg starting from the starting dose of 30mg. There were times I didn’t request an increase for a week or 2 because I thought it  was lasting a full 24 hours before experiencing any withdrawal symptoms (hot, cold flashes, etc.) but that was short lived. When I felt like the methadone wasn’t holding me over the 24 hours after a single dose around 90-105mg anymore, I started to put in requests for an increase.

After a lot of trial and error with taking methadone and understanding my body’s metabolism rate, I feel 120mg is my sweet spot after being on it for 7 months now. It lasts more than 24 hours after a single dose and don’t feel withdrawal symptoms until around the 42 hour mark. 

Just monitor how your body reacts after 12-16 hours after dosing at your current mg and work your way up until you stabilize at your sweet spot. You’ll eventually find it and probably stay on it until you start to taper off of it."
Methadone,fegb5lw,t1_fea7952,1579085857.0,"Trust me, I know exactly what you’re talking about. 

One time I came to my clinic 15 minutes after it opened (5:30AM is when they open) to dose for the day and restock on my 2 week take-homes and went to go stand in line per my usual routine, it was about 20-25 people ahead of me that day for the first time in a VERY long time - I guess the clinic was short on nurses and their system was acting up. 

Not even 2 minutes roll by after checking in and standing in line with all those people, the nurse out of nowhere yelled out my number, “504!!!” - my entire face went pale and was shocked because I knew (being at multiple clinics) that people at these clinics DO NOT PLAY about their position in line. The look on all those people faces that were waiting since opening felt like an ALL-OUT riot was about take place any moment. A guy then proceeds yell at the top of his lungs “WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, HE LITERALLY JUST WALKED IN”. 

The amount of huffing and puffing and the lip smacking with big OL’ wide eyes eyeing you up & down as I was walking past all those people was absolutely crazy - as if it was my fault they had to take care of all the weekly take-homes first before single dosing due the short staff on nurses and system crashing."
Methadone,feg9a4e,t1_fedqcss,1579083215.0,"Believe it or not, I actually dose 120mg once a day and it works perfectly for me as it actually holds me over a full 24 hours with 0 withdrawal symptoms.  I dose at 5 AM and don’t dose again until next day 5 AM on the dot until I have to restock on take homes and dose at the clinic at 5:30 AM when the clinic opens. 

I really think I hit my sweet spot with 120 mg - it’s been about 7 months now and don’t have to increase or decrease.

I’m on phase 5 at my Dallas, GA clinic (18 months) and have 2 week take-homes."

SuicideWatch,fdxo7xr,t3_enakk8,1578771175.0,"Each and every day I think about suicide. It’s a hard battle, but I think as time goes, the ideation dies down a little."
hivaids,fdqcr4e,t3_emgpzl,1578663167.0,Inconclusive result means that your rapid test came back neither positive or negative - the test may have been faulty or administered incorrectly. This is why they are sending it to an official lab to get a more definitive result with 100% accuracy.
SuicideWatch,fbxfvzi,t3_eez6ds,1577185320.0,Make sure you let anyone that is extremely close to you that it isn’t their fault. Try to minimize the guilt fallout so you will be able to cross over peacefully in the afterlife.
SuicideWatch,fbi0u5q,t3_edhckx,1576887566.0,"I use to take 2 showers every day (morning & night) - now, it’s maybe once a week. Depression and suicidal ideation literally have me chained to my bed all day. You’re not alone."
