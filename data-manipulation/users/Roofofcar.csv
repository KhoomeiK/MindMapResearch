When you make false claims, it’s one thing.  When you then attribute your fantasy to every member of another party, you’re just silly.  

Hopefully when you get a little older, you’ll get some real life experience and see that the media you’ve been consuming has painted a very false picture of reality."
todayilearned,ffingzx,t1_ffin4t6,1579978098.0,"In a country with huge food security issues, it’s a fair assumption, but you have to remember that the Kims are fat, Jong Un is into basketball (The Interview didn’t just make that up) and as a result I’d imagine food rations jump up a bit for the players."

When someone is purposefully shaking their boobs / pecs / butt provocatively for a crowd and are in control of their faculties, you’ll find the preferred traction is hooting and catcalling.  There’s nothing more awkward than silent burlesque."
brooklynninenine,ffimzhi,t1_ffiihcm,1579977761.0,"Yes, exactly.  This is entirely true and correct in every way.  Please note that the one thing missing in every one of these #metoo examples is consent.  Once someone asks for it, it’s quite literally the definition of “acceptable.”"

Do with that what you will."
