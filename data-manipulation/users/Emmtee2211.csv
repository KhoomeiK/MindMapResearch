Then you are invited to click on the link below for this ""5 second water hack"" that will help you to achieve results like all the people in the pictures. Except the ""water hack"" is taking this magical pill that is just going to melt all the unwanted fat off your body. OP is so considerate because he will lead you to the link where you can spend $50 per bottle on these magical fat-blasting pills."

It is so blown out of proportion. My goodness if they are told they can’t eat whatever they want whenever they want they immediately scream “deprivation!”.
fatlogic,fefmzw6,t1_fefbrmi,1579059854.0,"That’s too funny, this reminded me of his comment as well! It was hilarious, he said something like, “you don’t even have to run, you can just walk briskly away and she won’t be able to catch you.”"
fatlogic,fe051ys,t3_enfb82,1578803256.0,If she went to the regular changing rooms she likely would have complained they were too small and it was fatphobic because they aren’t made for people of all sizes.
