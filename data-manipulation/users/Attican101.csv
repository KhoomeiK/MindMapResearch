Edit: It was a pretty big moment in the show, for Chidi to get all his memories back, I can't recall anything on that level happening to Eleanor"

Totally thought the twist was going to be they were all pretty nasty behind closed doors and were drinking/smoking and whatnot.. Admittedly it was mainly based around one of the central committee members, playing a pretty terrible person in Modern Family (Pam)"

You are correct, I had thought there were two Moonliners before the modern version, with the first being much closer to the traditional V2 (a bit of a brain blip on my part to think it be a disarmed version as those originals would long have been used up undergoing testing)

And Hughes in regards to product placement or did he get into eugenics at some point? 

An interesting yet seemingly near unknown part of his life around the 30s is that Walt was a member of The Rancheros De Visitadores while out in California, riding his horse ""Minnie Mouse"". It was a gentlemens club including socialites/industrialists/politicians, which later included members such as Ronald Reagan and Clarke Gable, I have to wonder if they had any impact on Walts mindset at the time [link](https://www.independent.com/2012/07/11/los-rancheros-visitadores/)"

Walt definitely got close with a few Former Nazis after the war, basically helping turn Wernher von Braun (former head of The German rocket program) into an American hero long before the moon landing [link](https://youtu.be/eXIDFx74aSY)

As well, he had a vision for a small utopian city (Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow) [Epcot](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7e/84/dc/7e84dcb65d28213bbf915d2e103afc64.jpg), that may have been influenced by living for a time in California, a world leader during the early 20th century, in the ideology of Eugenics."
