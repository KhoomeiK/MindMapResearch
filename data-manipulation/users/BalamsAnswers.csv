I guess in the back of my mind I knew it wouldn't be possible for me to keep her. It's not fair to her, either. She doesn't deserve life in a motel room or the back seat of my car. 

I wish you all the best, and I hope you're able to get back on your feet soon."
homeless,ffvkaxh,t1_ffv7olp,1580266123.0,We're okay. We're going to hit the dog food pantry tomorrow which should get us through the week. I really appreciate your concern and offer. We'll pull through :)

homeless,ffv7a3j,t1_ffv6cm7,1580257373.0,"I don't have any family, and I only have a couple of friends, who, unfortunately, can't take her. According to her DNA test, she's 50% Husky 50% Golden Retriever. I live in a large metropolitan area and have contacted every single rescue here. None could take her or spare a temporary foster. I was blown away.  Every rescue I contacted advised me to send her back to the county shelter I rescued her from, and I just can't do that. I've found a private adoption website run by the Petco foundation that allows you to rehome your animals and the adoption fee the adopter pays to Petco is dispersed to the rescue of the adoptee's choice, so it all seems very legit. And of course, I would be able to meet all potential adopters before making any decisions. I know she would be swooped up in a heartbeat, it's just bringing myself to do it that's killing me :/"
HumansBeingBros,ffpi7f1,t1_ffpcav2,1580095656.0,"I was wondering this, as well. That’s a pretty new-looking car, so I’m sure there’s a jack inside. They could have had the car off the ground in 30 seconds."
AbsoluteUnits,ffpewgp,t1_ffnyigv,1580093331.0,Rescue only means that the dog is on the euthanasia list unless a 501c3 rescue group steps in and pulls him out of the shelter within a certain amount of time.
AskReddit,ffk3hrk,t3_eu0agw,1580014667.0,"I’m always honest with my interviewer, but explain how I’ve evolved since acknowledging and working on said weakness. “I’ve always had a hard time receiving criticism or feedback from my supervisors without taking it personally, but I go out of my way now to ask for performance reviews so that I can get better at processing and applying feedback with each meeting.”

maybemaybemaybe,ffi7ag1,t1_ffi54g7,1579966961.0,"Make sure you get them a big cage, as a standard rat cage is far too small. I recommend getting a decent-sized ferret cage with lots of levels. They can be litter box trained as well so you don’t have to use bedding. I only ever put bedding in a couple of baskets that they could burrow into, but otherwise used felt to cover the surfaces so they had nice squishy carpeting. The dollar store is also a great place to get toys! My guys loved baby toys and crepe paper that were way cheaper than toys from the pet store."
news,ffdoe0f,t1_ffdkwo9,1579825180.0,"Well, the false accuser would probably get chewed out because ""their date was being inappropriate"" is not a valid reason to call law enforcement out to you, especially when you're in a public place and no-one can corroborate your story. 

I'm not trying to argue that this is right or wrong, but simply stating what is mostly likely to happen (at least in the US). I've seen police refuse to come out for actual domestic cases because no-one had been hurt (yet), so I can't imagine them showing up to mediate a bad date without consequences."
AskReddit,ffdftq3,t1_ffdex22,1579819983.0,"Yup. Hire 70-80 year old door-greeter and take a policy out on them. Wait for them to die, and recoup multiple times the money that they ever paid out to that employee in the first place. It's absolutely vile, but they stopped doing it after they had to pay a huge settlement to the widows of these people.

Edit: I should probably also mention that no, the employees were not aware that these policies were being taken out on them."

news,ffdcm41,t1_ffd5hc1,1579818038.0,"That does raise a good question of who, if anyone, is held accountable when a third-party makes a 911 call on someone else's behalf. If I texted my best friend, told her to call 911, and I wasn't in danger at all, that seems pretty cut and dried. On the other hand, if I press the panic button on the app, and after 2 failed attempts to contact me, police are dispatched, couldn't I easily say, ""whoops! Must have pressed it on accident, my bad!"" and not face any consequences? 

Then again, I'm wondering who in their right mind would ever do this in the first place just to get out of an unenjoyable date."
news,ffd2bvo,t1_ffd0ivg,1579812030.0,"The panic feature is accessed through an entirely separate app that you have to download, so that should cut down on frivolous bans. Also, I'm pretty sure someone abusing the system is going to be facing consequences when law enforcement arrives and sees that no-one is in danger."
Fantasy,ffctwa7,t1_ffcsmqm,1579807169.0,"I've heard that sentiment about GB a few other places, which is exactly how I felt about Kingkiller. Loved the first book, wanted to throw them all in the garbage by the time I finished the third. Does The Lies of Locke Lamora work as a standalone? Maybe I could knock that one out, save myself some disappointment, and start WOT right afterward."
Fantasy,ffctq5u,t1_ffcsg9w,1579807070.0,"I *do* love loads of magic in my fantasy novels. 15 books seem like such a big commitment, and I'm the type of person who can't pick up another title between series. I have to finish them all in one big push lest I start getting worlds mixed up. But the stellar reviews also lead me to believe that I probably won't ever get fatigued by the series, despite how long it is."
Fantasy,ffct9qz,t1_ffcruc2,1579806804.0,"The fact that WOT is complete makes it extra compelling. I've always wondered what it feels like to start a series, knowing that I can read it from start to finish without crossing my fingers that the author won't die before finishing it (or have someone in place to finish it posthumously. Thanks, Sanderson!)."
AbruptChaos,ff9vo3g,t1_ff9sidw,1579722511.0,"My dog is half golden, half-husky, and it's always a toss-up with her and wildlife. Sometimes she'll very delicately pick up a small animal (toads, baby birds, bats) and deliver it to me when she's having a golden day, and sometimes she'll nab a groundhog and flail the poor thing until every bone in its body has broken."

tifu,ff9jk1b,t1_ff9i9qt,1579714365.0,"Where in my comment did I say that every single prostitute working in a massage parlor was a victim of human trafficking? You asked why women who *are* victims of trafficking can't simply ""quit,"" and I explained why. 

Would you like me to post my comment again so you can double-check that I made no such claims?"
tifu,ff9g6sj,t1_ff8rcn6,1579712326.0,"You live in a third-world country. You save up all the money you can possibly get your hands on to get a plane ticket to the US. You find a job online where you’ll be cleaning motel rooms for 10 bucks an hour, and they’ll rent a room to you for 20 bucks a night. Awesome! You finally arrive in the US with only 100 bucks to your name. You head to the motel to meet your “boss.” They have you get in their car and ask to see your passport to verify your identity. They don’t give it back. They drive you to a shady massage parlor and throw you in a barrack with a bunch of other girls. No one speaks English or can ask for help. You’re locked in your room with no money, no passport, no phone. If you’re lucky, they get you addicted to heroin so you become complacent and have an even harder time trying to escape, but if you did, where would you even go? You’re now being sexually assaulted multiple times a day. Customers are paying for the experience to assault you, but you don’t see a dime of it. You’re a hostage, and a slave, even without chains."
tifu,ff9fh1k,t1_ff80kww,1579711889.0,"OP, you should really take the advice given above. A ton of these places are fronts for human trafficking, and the women working in these places are doing so very much against their will. The fact that your masseuse didn’t speak a lick of English and was spoken to like a dog by reception are some pretty serious red flags if this story is true."
AdviceAnimals,ff9e6fs,t1_ff98l7g,1579711074.0,"Yup. I worked FOH for years. If you were sick and couldn’t find someone to cover your shift, you were SOL. I remember getting bronchitis and chugging codeine cough syrup the doctor gave me earlier that day throughout my shift, praying I didn’t cough all over my tables when I was dropping off their food. 
The only time I ever got a modicum of help from management was when I couldn’t get my shift covered for a surgery. They helped me make sure I had the day of the surgery off, but I was back at work the next day when I was supposed to be on bed rest for 5 days. That was probably the most miserable week of my life."

He’s getting so flustered with me because despite his perfect directions, I continue to stall over and over again for about 20 minutes. He finally watches what my feet are doing and notices that I’m hitting the brake instead of the gas when trying to get started.
