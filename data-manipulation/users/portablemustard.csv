In that case, it creates a bridge mode between the VM and the machine hosting it (virtual network adapter). So if you have a network share on a directory on your machine, you can connect to it from the VM. That way you have data stored directly on your machine or what not.  


But if you meaning sending data to and from your device. Then yes definitely on that. The bridge mode allows your VM to communicate with your LAN/WAN through your PC."
