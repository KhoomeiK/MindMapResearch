Android is much better today, but those early phones required those cores (and the battery drain) to make that patchwork OS passable. A WP7 or WP8 handset with “lesser” specs would run circles around the others, for a better price point. 

The end of Windows Phone was all a vicious circle of apps. The selling point for some buyers was that this App Store had 500k apps, the Play Store had 500k, and the MS store “only” had 100k. That led to a spiral of decreased market share, then developers not supporting it, and so on. 

Then you have crap like Snapchat. The creator/founder killed off third party access after a data breach. The developer of the WP Snapchat app offered the code to Snap for free, and they turned it down. They simply refused to allow the platform, period.

> While we’re imagining a city that is instrumented to measure things but not people, try imagining a mobile device that gathers data about its user, but doesn’t ever share that data with anyone, ever. Its backups are encrypted to a passphrase that only the user knows, and it jealously guards the data about its use from the vendors who supply its apps. This device knows everywhere you go, it knows what you buy, it knows whom you talk to and how long and maybe even what about. In other words, it is extremely similar to the device you’re carrying around right now – with the vital difference that it keeps what it learns about you private.

Interestingly, we had that for a brief time. Cortana, as it was deployed on the Windows Phone operating system, stored the information about you on the phone. It did not default to a cloud or to a profile. It was all on the phone in something called the Notebook, and you could go in and edit/delete items about you whenever you wanted to."

And the maintenance on the generation side isn’t as dependent on the amount of power flowing. It’s the very existence of the lines, transmission and local, and the substations. You still need every bit of that infrastructure, so the minuscule “savings” on the generation end isn’t that big an impact on the overall operating cost."
SquaredCircle,fdfczr0,t1_fdexkug,1578358791.0,"Net metering refers to arrangements where the utility pays you back at the retail rate, kinda like running your odometer in reverse. 

What APS (and other utilities) have done is move to paying back the wholesale price of the electricity. They pay you back, but not at the full retail price. Which is fine if you think about it. The utility is having to pay for all the maintenance on the infrastructure to bring you the power — AND having to pay for the infrastructure that allows you to sell some back. 

If you let a lot of people sign up for net metering, and they keep “netting out,” it allows them to completely escape paying for the transit costs of the electrons they are selling. Those costs are borne by other customers, the vast majority of whom are lower income. True Net Metering is a policy that over time and at scale subsidizes solar and renewables for rich households, on the backs of poorer ones."
