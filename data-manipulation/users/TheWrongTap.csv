None of it personal, it's dickheads, and you are already an easy target because of the Roo gear. None of this is worth getting assaulted over."

deliveroos,feqs02u,t1_feoytgf,1579345367.0,Oh mate. Hope you get sorted. That does sound potentially fatal for your scoot.
Leeds,feqnj1k,t1_feqkmdg,1579343965.0,"yeah sorry that was a bit abrupt but if you are somebody who is into fishes, you are going to be left very disappointed/upset at these 'ponds'. Koi are monster fish and really should not be kept like that."

cats,fdt2t3w,t1_fdt0ab1,1578711179.0,Dwarf puffers are the best but goby are pretty amazing too. I was hoping to breed cherry shrimps for the world championship but it made me too sad to sell them (because people don’t know how to keep them alive) so I’m stuck with 2 cherry shrimps tanks now :(
cats,fdsyv75,t1_fdsppro,1578709734.0,"haha, i think my fish might be too tiny to taste like salt because i only have 3 Endler's guppies (they are beautiful and tiny) in one tank and like about 15 normarni lampeyes in my other tank, they are cool cos they look a lil bit like fairy lights when they are shoaling around. Then I have hundreds of cherry shrimps and some other shrimps. Maybe they taste like salt actually? I dont really want to lick those though.  Don't lick reptiles mate, it's too unpredictable :o"

cats,fdshfia,t1_fdsgagq,1578702812.0,"They are freshwater tanks but yeah there must be some added flavour, even if it's just a trace. I'll keep an eye on her chin and beans now though to be safe. thanks for the info."
cats,fdsfx7l,t1_fdsczdr,1578701877.0,"Really? Oh no, my cat's favourite drinking bowl is the plastic tub i use to do my fish tank water changing (It usually has some dechlorinated tap water in there). She has to stand in the water with her paws to get to it. She also eats like OP's cat sometimes, while we are on the subject. Should i be concerned?"

deliveroos,fbxxs1v,t3_ef2500,1577203245.0,"It's disgusting mate, almost as if it's designed to catch you out. Nothing you can do about it now but in future you need to make sure you complete one order within the hour that it was offered. It's so convoluted and shit, you can be waiting around for orders for nearly an hour and the c's will have the gall to tell you that you didnt attend if you fail to understand their stupid rules. Merry christmas."
