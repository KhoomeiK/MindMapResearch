todayilearned,ffst6o7,t3_euxlay,1580191552.0,My Grandpa was in charge of documenting the events of where he was stationed in WWII. He met and was the  chauffeur for Gen. Mark Clark there is a pic of him and the general on the jeep he rode in. There were horrifying photos (to me at least since I was so young looking at them) of dead ppl and such. Blown up buildings and bridges. I wish I could post some of the photos or donate them but I just found out they were “Lent” out by my dumbass sister to my dumbass cousin so her dumbass could use them for a history report that my dumbass cousin lost along with all the photos... I should have these two arrested and charged!
