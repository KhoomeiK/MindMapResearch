aspergirls,ffskhmg,t1_ffqscc1,1580183944.0,"Do you ever lose time by basing things in your phone? Ideally I’d like to just put my phone away, because it distracts me and allows me to avoid tasks, but so many resources are on my phone, like alarms and apps. I don’t know GTD, I’ll look into it!"
DogCare,ffmerdv,t1_ffhf0xc,1580053513.0,"Yes, or an inflatable neck pillow is another one that can work in a pinch!"
aspergirls,ffivblt,t1_ffh9gds,1579983594.0,"Thank you for your kind words. The responses here have been so helpful. Not just for learning techniques I am going to try, but hearing that other people have similar problems, and how they have dealt with them. Inertia is really what it feels like, and seeing other people cope easily with things I struggle with feels lonely sometimes. I think you're right and that thinking of my abilities and achievements differently may actually be practical, because it could help me be more realistic and achieve more. Trying to keep up with the people around me and do things in the same way/at the same time definitely isn't working, anyway! I have never told my colleagues that I'm on the spectrum, in part because I don't think they'd understand. I think for most of them their idea of a spectrum person is like John Nash from A Beautiful Mind or something. I also mask a lot and emulate other people. Perhaps doing less of that and instead trying to be realistic about what is possible for me, and trying to adjust other people's expectations, will make a difference."
DogCare,ffh8fky,t1_ffh7tuw,1579926083.0,I said that to myself once as well!
DogCare,ffh71xd,t1_ffh6xy1,1579924920.0,If the wound is looking red or wet or there’s pus take her to emergency!
DogCare,ffh6xy1,t3_etll8u,1579924828.0,"Get a cone on her now. Borrow one or find a pet shop. If you can’t, do anything you possibly can to stop her licking her stitches. The last thing you want your new puppy to go through is another surgery. And get her to the vet ASAP!"
aspergirls,ffh2e89,t1_ffgrb9d,1579921266.0,"This is so incredibly helpful to hear. Thank you so much for commenting, really. Your experience is really similar to mine. I’m always late to everything too! I hate it about myself. And maybe I am just expecting too much of myself?? Maybe I’m just not capable of as much as the people around me are. some days I really feel like I shouldn’t even have my job.
It’s a hard pill to swallow though. I have had a couple of successes in my professional field that felt incredible, but they were very hard won and I have not been able to follow them up by progressing further, like I’d hoped.
I think I should give the bullet journal another try. Setting an alarm to literally just look at it could be a way to make it functional for me. Perhaps I’ll try to keep it much simpler than I did last time."
aspergirls,ffgm9kz,t1_ffgjwiu,1579909519.0,"I wish I knew. I have never been great at it, but in the past I have excelled at certain things and done at least *some* things properly/very well. I’ve definitely always had areas where I’m failing. I just turned 30 and sort of evaluated things and felt like a complete loser. I have done almost nothing of what I’d hoped to do by this point in my life! I think I have let opportunities go by just sort of not being able to manage my own brain. To give you an extreme example: in 2017 I signed up to take the LSAT, with the intention of applying to law school. I studied the test and got good scores and felt competent at it. I actually really liked the test! Then someone advised me to take a week’s break from doing practice tests, because I was scoring well and burnout would have been counterproductive. I occupied myself with other things and did not return to focusing on the test at the end of the week. Worse than that, I actually forgot to turn up on test day."
aspergirls,ffgjukq,t1_ffgi3rv,1579907895.0,"That is really helpful, thank you so much. I really like the sound of your system and it sounds manageable for me!"
aspergirls,ffghxor,t1_ffgdn94,1579906633.0,"Is eating the frog a specific method?
I do often try to do the hardest thing first. Very often, I never get to the tasks after it because I lost or absorbed/forget that the list exists.
I think setting time limits and taking short breaks sounds ideal. That’s what I’d ultimately like to get to. Very often I don’t get the thing done within the time limit, which upsets me, and often I take a break  and really lose focus on what I’m supposed to be doing/ start doing something else completely."
aspergirls,ffghjeu,t1_ffgf10y,1579906373.0,"Yes! I started this and had great intentions about setting up a routine but it faded away/I didn’t stick to it, like so many other things."
aspergirls,ffgh2hp,t1_ffgf742,1579906070.0,"Thanks. So you keep your bullet journal at home on your desk or something, and look at it every so often? How do you remind yourself to do it? And do you remember to work toward whatever goals are there even when not looking at it, like during the day? I feel like I drop every goal I have.
Setting timers for the sake of it sounds like a good idea!"
aspergirls,ffgggvo,t1_ffgfvab,1579905684.0,"Small tasks can take me a really long time. I can start something and get very absorbed in details and forget what I’m actually supposed to be doing and waste huge amounts of time. I feel like I always choose the wrong thing to work on/prioritize. I think of a task, write it down somewhere and never look back at that place. I have trouble switching “modes” and transitioning from one task to the next. If I feel like a task is not finished or right or good enough it can get me really upset and meltdown-y. I also do a lot of avoidance and procrastination and make excuses not to start tasks that feel very big or difficult. I think that covers the main stuff!
I would like to be really organized and have a daybook and systems I follow and know what’s going on at all times, but it’s almost like I’m allergic to it. I can’t even get close to it."
DogCare,ffg20ed,t3_etbfia,1579896740.0,Very hard to say what this might be without seeing the actual area. It could be any number of things. You should take him to the vet. How come you can only access a vet within a matter of weeks? You should definitely have access to emergency care and short term urgent care for your dog. Especially for a rescue whose health history you’re probably still learning about.
SmolBeanSnark,fffcmzb,t1_ffezdpd,1579881022.0,"Someone please dm with this person, get all the information and then post it, so it’s here but not linked to this person who needs to stay anonymous."

reactivedogs,ffdewva,t3_esyifc,1579819433.0,Tell your vet about the effect of the traz! That might not be the best medication for your dog.
Dogtraining,ffc4ybv,t3_esu2ml,1579791632.0,"She arrived on Monday—give her two weeks to relax, at least. You won’t properly know what she’s like for a while. She’s terrified, and in a new place. Try to be patient and not expect too much, even if what you’re describing sounds really hard and trying! There are heaps of great threads on this sub with details about how to deal with separation anxiety. Look up Sophia Yin’s videos and the treat and train toy.
Crate training, when you’re on the road success, will probably make a big difference. Also, stop squeezing her mouth shut. That’s an odd method that I’ve never seen be successful, and you’re likely confusing her and maybe scaring her. Good luck!"
Dogtraining,ffb1gf9,t1_ffb0vle,1579749421.0,"Wow. Your sister’s dog must have really hated that ear medication. That makes me nervous. I’m almost wondering if it’s worth asking the vet for some trazedone for this process, because I really don’t want it to reverse the great progress she has made in trusting humans. I will change up her location, thanks."
Dogtraining,ffaru5s,t1_ffaqxur,1579743014.0,"Yes, that's important. I think it's my only hope! I just did it and she really hates me now. It was the first time we've used the muzzle ""negatively""/in a way she doesn't enjoy since we started muzzle training. There's probably no way she'll ever enjoy getting cold squirts in her ears.
This dog has a rough history (and a minor bite history) and doesn't easily trust humans =("

aspergirls,ff0n24d,t1_fezbovu,1579470427.0,"Yes!!! Every single day. I had no idea that was a spectrum thing, or why I did it, but every day I feel compelled to carry everything but the kitchen sink around with me. I live in NYC and take public transport every day, which is why I use the backpack. Carrying in a purse or something I carry on one side hurts my back."
veterinaryprofession,fezu7rc,t3_eqzpyl,1579461714.0,"Not a vet but from a training perspective this is horrific, and a very effective way to get the dog to fear the muzzle and work even harder to protect himself from the muzzle ( ie by aggression)."
aspergirls,fezst8j,t1_fezr3yt,1579461198.0,Thanks!
aspergirls,fez00c8,t1_feynclh,1579452580.0,"I agree with all this. I pretty much only wear soft sweaters that feel really nice to the touch, and loose pants. I find that if I dry clean and lint roll them they look a little bit more “intentional” and professional. I struggle more with shoes and bags, because all I ever want to carry is my rei backpack but everyone else carries nice bags!"
SmolBeanSnark,feyhdde,t1_fex0umj,1579445585.0,"Sorry you’re going through that. Not to get political but these kind of stories were what made me support and root for Bernie Sanders. You’re essentially being punished because your partner happened to get sick. His sickness is being leveraged to make some money for other people. Sanders is truly the only one committed to fixing that. Also rent control and housing. I hope things get better for you, and that your partner recovers and thrives."

SmolBeanSnark,fey8j7n,t1_fet8kg1,1579442100.0,"Just wondering, what would be a way to cook them that wouldn’t ruin them? Also what kind of mushrooms are they and why are they so expensive?"
Dentistry,fev6aw9,t1_fev090z,1579393564.0,"Last time I went, two years ago, it ended up being $700 because the dentist told me I had two large cavities that urgently needed filling. Long story but that dentist was wrong. I think he may have been upselling me because he knew I hadn't seen a dentist in a long time. Thank you so much for your advice!"

SmolBeanSnark,fesgxra,t1_feru9y5,1579364999.0,Every day I discover more about what a food dumbass I am.
SmolBeanSnark,feoh8wv,t1_feoen7e,1579300088.0,"thanks for such a thoughtful and generous response. I was getting worried that I had chosen the wrong place to ask dumb questions about something I know nothing about, and risk triggering or upsetting people.
What you describe in the obsessing, bingeing, isolating etc sounds awful, and very unhealthy. I can see how the endless self-congratulatory shots of green smoothie CC posts would be less than helpful if you’re trying to hold that at bay. For me I just saw it all and thought “that looks gross.”

Then again, it’s very CC to latch on to some silly trend and be tone deaf about the implications."
SmolBeanSnark,fen7l6t,t1_feluu7m,1579278717.0,"Also, if she wanted her work to be available for free online, like you say she does, I am pretty sure she would have done it herself, and you wouldn’t need pirated PDFs from strangers on Reddit."
SmolBeanSnark,fen6w3e,t1_feluu7m,1579278288.0,"What do you mean was? She’s still alive. I think you misunderstand what anti-capitalist means. It does not mean working for free or not being compensated for one’s work. How else is she supposed to live? I’m no expert on her work but from my memory of what I’ve read she argues capitalism reinforces the patriarchy and white supremacy because it keeps workers subjugated and dependent on bosses. The way to be free of subjugation is to actually receive the profits and outcomes of your labor, rather than your boss or an owner receiving them. Again, use a library, where her works circulate freely.
Having worked in the publishing industry I can assure you its damaging to artists and writers to steal their work and justify it by saying it’s exposure, or it’s good that people are reading their work, or something. They need to be paid to be able to work."

SmolBeanSnark,felg8yo,t1_felfucl,1579221459.0,Don’t pirate her work!!
Dogtraining,fekuik9,t1_fektb3l,1579207872.0,"Force free and positive reinforcement. Do not trust or hire anyone who tells you to use force, hit, punish, scare or “discipline” Kermit. He’s had traumatic experiences in his life and you’re training him to feel SAFE and confident. Just like you would with a human who had anxiety or trauma.
It sounds like Kermit May have separation anxiety. You could read up on that, and understand some of the basic ways people 1) manage it and 2) treat it.
Clicker training is great, and speeds things up a lot.
This subreddit is also a great resource to ask questions and there are a lot of experienced trainers here.
Lastly, there’s nothing wrong with medication, if a trainer and vet think that’s right for Kermit. You can successfully combine both, if that’s what will work best for him."

Dogtraining,fekoscm,t1_fekoiid,1579204492.0,"Poor guy. Have you tried training? I have had lots of very fearful foster dogs who have had deep, deep anxiety that improved greatly with training.

Dogtraining,feisuii,t1_fegvu5d,1579146319.0,Maybe I should try harder to find a muzzle she can eat through. It would definitely make training easier
Dogtraining,feisqvv,t1_fegvu5d,1579146247.0,"That sounds like a method. Problem is the muzzle I chose is one of the soft cloth ones that form a loose band around her snout. She can open her mouth while wearing it but only a little, not enough to eat.
Her face is so small that this was one of the few that fit, and it’s only to wear for a few minutes at a time at the vet, because she has trauma around the vet."
SmolBeanSnark,feirflm,t3_ep9vvk,1579145325.0,I am so happy to see people reading this book. It’s incredible and I re read it now and then. Her story is so awfully sad. I hope she’s resting in peace.
