BattlefieldV,ffd4d3z,t1_ffclb07,1579813180.0,Learn to play without it. Well you can't now I guess. But you really should. Aim assist is for noobs.
BattlefieldV,ffd46kx,t1_ffcf458,1579813079.0,"I would have given this 6.2 rebalance a chance (not even bothering before that) if you would remove snap aim. Hell, give me the ability to turn it off completely and leave it in the game. I can see with your wording that that MIGHT be an option, but I'm betting we'll only be able to lessen it. If it has to be on in any capacity, I'm not playing. I HATE aim assistance. It's BS to play against and not fun to play with. I refuse to play games with any sort of mandatory aim assistance.

That being said, I've barely been playing since june. You remove frontlines, you treat rush like some flash in the pan mode, those are the modes I like. I hate all the other ones. I played when those modes were available. Then you do the ttk nerf and I deleted the game from my ps4. Then you add snap aim and make rsp basically useless making my decision all the more justified. Funny, because I thought rsp would be my reintroduction to the game, being able to actually play the game mode THAT I BASED MY PURCHASE OF THE GAME ON. But no. It was the worst update in the history of the battlefield franchise."

I'd be surprised if you are a veteran with the way you act, but if you are, it's too bad you didn't die in war.
