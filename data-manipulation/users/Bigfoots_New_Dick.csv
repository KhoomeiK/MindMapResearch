television,ffdred0,t3_et1jhb,1579827074.0,"Kathleen Kennedy needs to go. She is too safe, nostalgic, and I can imagine her shooting down great ideas. 

If caution it is because of Rise of Skywalker and Solo, amongst others, then get someone else because she had her hands all over stopping and delaying and ordering redo's for those projects. And they turned out to be disappointing. When you start clusterfucking the people with the actual artistic vision and molding them into whatever Disney market scheme you have, you are inviting uninspired disaster. This fucking sucks.

Get her out of the picture, replace her with Feige or someone. She is clueless and too conservative with image. No creativity or freshness will get past her anymore."
philadelphia,ffdqmrq,t1_ffdpleg,1579826590.0,"You're absolutely correct. But  you can't just yell ""fire"" in a crowded movie theater or threaten someone. Speech is protected in a hierarchy with political ideas and educational things at the center. As you move away from that, it becomes much more likely that there is no First Amendment violation.

When you weigh the public danger of something with no political or moral point, such as dancing around like a fat dumbass in blackface in a largely African American city, honestly you are gonna get your ass kicked but not arrested.

&#x200B;

But if you want a city permitted event that's broadcast on live TV, we're not talking normal Free Speech exercised. It's an event the city is allowing you to do. You can make fun of Kenney, probably get away with a bunch of political stuff. But doing something that undoubtedly could cause violence and give the city a terrible name based on changing times, not gonna fly. There's nothing redeeming about it. It's an easy analysis."

philadelphia,ffdfome,t1_ffda81l,1579819898.0,">Clearly the city thinks it has some way of forcing the parade to follow it's rules

They do. You can't parade without a permit. The city isn't going to permit blackface on its streets. They can revoke a permit or choose not to issue it. I imagine the permit contains provisions specifically on not allowing crude or offensive displays.

A permit exists for a reason, its not like a fucking SEPTA token"
philadelphia,ffdfff5,t1_ffd9hi4,1579819746.0,He's right. Do you know what a permit is? It's basically a contract where the city decides and enforces the provisions. The new condition of that permit is no blackface. It's not that hard.
philadelphia,ffdfb0s,t1_ffdbhlu,1579819672.0,It's not unconstitutional. It's certainly not Constitutionally protected though. I imagine the parade is a permitted event. It's a contract with the city. The city can and has chosen to make this a condition of that contract.
philadelphia,ffdf5vj,t1_ffd1uuy,1579819585.0,"Speech with no real content or effect other than hate or offensiveness is hardly protected by the First Amendment.

Either way, I imagine it doesn't matter because the parade isn't normal speech that needs to be protected from the government. 

The answer is no because it's a permitted major event that the city effectively grants and allows them to do, shuts down its streets for and has to pay its security and law enforcement to plan for. I imagine No Blackface is just a new condition to that agreement with the city. Which it shouldn't even have to be, but these are mostly fat Italian trumpers dick heads who couldn't give a shit about rights or equality. And they'll be racist and offensive just to feel tough."

philadelphia,ffb0y7j,t1_ffa0w5i,1579749082.0,"I can tell you from being in the law practice, there are countless rich Jewish doctors who literally perform/diagnose things that aren't necessary in order to help build harm for damages in a personal injury case. They establish a relationship with certain attorneys who send them all of their clients from accidents/injuries, and the Dr. makes sure something comes out in the reports.

&#x200B;

For instance, I've seen a guy get completely negative, clear MRI and Xray of knee that shows absolutely NOTHING. Bad for the case, especially if it's a legal standard that needs permanent injury. What does the doctor do? Says he ""suspects"" something it didn't pick up, does an invasive surgery and says he saw, corrected it with minimal invasion. 

&#x200B;

I in no way mean to say this doesn't happen legitimately, as scanning tests and those who review are in no way infallible. Sometimes opening up to see the real damage is the best or only way. But what I'm saying is that certain doctors have certain trends and show up in certain attorney's cases every time with gold mines.

I think you get collegiate coaches who are loved by their fans/staff. Lack of experience in NFL means more vetting, longer process. But for a team that’s about to add a whole class of new young talent, it makes sense to have fresh coaches too."

Biggest thing i saw from Jim Schwartz was adaptability. He played a different ball game, more blitzing and really good plays against the run. 

It was just so obvious that Offense cant score consistently early, and that our WR situation was clearly a disaster with personnel and production. The last two seasons was literally the “game plan” falling apart every start, with the D coming out to keep the score close over and over.

The D usually stepped up to keep leads late as well on last minute plays. Offense only did that a handful of times, namely the last 4 reg season games.

Schwartz at least keeps his guys in the game, having each others back. Can’t say that about the other side of the ball. He keeps his job for now, but he’s gotta step it up with some young CBs next year."
