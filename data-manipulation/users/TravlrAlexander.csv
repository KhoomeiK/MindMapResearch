* Detroit: has very African-American-centric culture, you go here for fireworks and other events but can't find parking and don't bring cash
* Dearborn and Dearborn Heights: Some weird mix of old white people doing neighborhood watch and Arabic cultures, you come here for the Henry Ford Museum and Green Field Village.
* Ann Arbor: You only go here to visit the hospital while wondering how that one building can support itself with 90% of it's mass supported by 3 stainless steel poles
* Brighton: Small town that tries too hard to look like Ann Arbor. Modern Art Decos everywhere and a busted metal statue of a man with a small penis in front of a Mill Pond with an angry goose infestation, and a massive children's playground made of splintered wood.
* Grand Rapids: Art, Opera and Sports. Also the grand river that's cool. 
* Saginaw: Factories. You come here because you're passing through to see -
* Mackinac Island: You come here to spend money on overpriced fudge and pay ten dollars to stand on a big porch for a moment or two while your six-year-old child laughs at the horse shitting in the road. Ancient, liver-spotted white people relive their 20's by treating the seasonally-employed South African culinary staff like subhuman oddities.

FUN FACT: The U.P. does not exist within Michigan as a whole and was joint-annexed by the cultures of Canadians and Texans at an indeterminate time in recent history."
