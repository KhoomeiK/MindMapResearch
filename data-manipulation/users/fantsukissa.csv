AskReddit,fffamf3,t1_ffe56sz,1579879744.0,"that's true. my friend used to be a hamster breeder and took good care of her hamsters. but  occasionally she woke up to a hamster cage with headless hamster babies and ""happy"" mom."
AnimalsBeingDerps,feyopiu,t3_eqwekr,1579448435.0,She looks like a good doggo who would like some more belly rubs. She's cute and beautiful lady.
AnimalsBeingDerps,feylrqm,t3_eqw6l9,1579447305.0,Aww she's cute derp. I hope her recovery goes well. I remember how much my derps hated the cone of shame after spaying.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fex7td3,t3_eqnt8z,1579426409.0,"he looks almost exactly like my cat who does that too, but to windows and tv. occasionally on doors too."
AskReddit,feraz9w,t3_eq62yh,1579351826.0,just hold an animal and threaten to harm it. I'll tell you anything to prevent harming of an innocent animal.

AskReddit,fejp19o,t1_fejexx5,1579182109.0,"Me too. I understand digital clocks, but I visualise time better on analog clock. I instantly get how much time is left and how much has passed, but with digital clocks it takes time. I use a analog version on my samsung watch, but when the battery is low I have to use battery saving mode which has only digital clock. On those days I have serious problem staying on schedule at work."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fe35qf2,t3_eno95y,1578846163.0,one of my cats looked quite the same after eating lasagna. no one can be mad at that happy purring face. also the white parts with the sauce are going to be stained for some time.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fe1ey86,t1_fe073tq,1578825778.0,"my cats are the same too! they eat lasagna, pea soup, bread, pastries, anything really. also trash from floor and plastic is worst. they try to eat plastic, throw it up, then eat it again, throw up again, etc. this repeats until I manage to take the plastic away or they manage to swallow it without throwing up."
facepalm,fdmb13s,t1_fdm70x4,1578544348.0,there are stoves that have a timer. those are usually for elderly or people with memory problems. I used to live in an apartment where there was that kind of stove and often forgot to put the timer on and wondered why nothing heated.
blursedimages,fdjmhv1,t1_fdjcoz7,1578478032.0,It's very difficult even for skinny people. So for her to be able to do it means she's very strong and has worked very hard. Really impressive! It's sad that she's being compared to a chicken while doing a badass move.
facepalm,fdgqau7,t3_el9n2r,1578405506.0,"I live in finland and here almost all sheep are farmed for meat, not wool. If the farmers wanted to sell the wool they would need to process it after shearing it. The money they would get from the wool is so little that it's just not worth it, so it's just disposed. Sheep meat however is expensive."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fd3ht66,t3_ejw4wy,1578158408.0,"I'm really tempted to buy one for my cats. They might like it, or not.."
therewasanattempt,fcuhfpl,t3_eixuy8,1577981037.0,It probably comes with a hearing aid for the doll so kids with hearing aids can relate.
therewasanattempt,fcudba7,t3_eiwppo,1577978280.0,I wish I was as skinny as I was the first time I felt I was fat.
AskReddit,fcpxefz,t1_fcogjnc,1577874208.0,"more like couple seconds. farts are fun, but shitting your pants is absolutely hilarious. it's the cleaning part that sucks."
AskReddit,fcpx2zu,t1_fcor5x2,1577874009.0,lots of fiber and water. if pooping is easy then you don't have to push much and so no pee.
hitmanimals,fcnw30w,t1_fcnvwb3,1577819598.0,ooo! thank you!
AnimalsBeingDerps,fcnohb5,t1_fcnkvy8,1577815390.0,"birds die doing this around any buildings. I grew up in a regular one storey house and birds often flew into the windows and died. 

my cats on the other hand run head first to walls and seem to be fine. birds are more fragile than cats it seems."

AskReddit,fcnletv,t1_fcnkoms,1577813761.0,"mine came with instructions, but I still failed. now luckily I have cats so I can't have even plastic plants because my adorkables chew them too. edit. ""luckily"" because this is explanation people accept when they ask why I don't have plants. if I say that all my plants die, they will suggest this and that plant that is ""impossible"" to kill."
AskReddit,fcnfx4z,t1_fcncusi,1577810891.0,"it depends on how in hurry I'm going to be. I usually pee first thing in morning, then after coffee I poop. if I know I'm going to be in hurry I'll try to pee again because I don't know when I'll have time to pee next time. if I'm constipated and have to work to get poop out then I can't help but pee too, but usually I don't have to pee while pooping."
AskReddit,fcnernu,t1_fclzgaw,1577810225.0,being comfortable enough to fart around each other is important in a relationship. I had a boyfriend (for a very short time) who couldn't handle the thought of any natural bodily function of a woman. he would run out of the room even if I said that I had farted (I hadn't but wanted to test what would happen). I'm lactose intolerant and love chocolate so that relationship was doomed from the start.
AskReddit,fcne5vs,t1_fcmuafc,1577809834.0,fart battles are fun until there's a shart
AskReddit,fcnbj3h,t1_fcmrazw,1577808095.0,that is true. once had to nope out of situation when a guy had a huge one that was hanging to his knees. no way I'm doing anything with that size.
AskReddit,fcn99ci,t1_fcn7ha0,1577806538.0,"what ever it was potted in. I have absolutely no green thumb, so no plant survived long enough to require change of soil. at first I tried other plants and those died within few weeks. cacti lasted a month or two."
AskReddit,fcn7akg,t1_fcmlyqw,1577805131.0,"fanny is used mainly by the finnish swedes, I think."
AskReddit,fcn716h,t1_fcms8ha,1577804939.0,"I'm not here to downvote, but to explain the difference. finnish ""pe"" and english ""pay"" are not pronounced the same. ""pe"" is more like the first syllable of ""pelican""."
AskReddit,fcn6gyx,t1_fcmo1wg,1577804525.0,the finnish speakers use fanni and the swedish speakers use fanny.
AskReddit,fcn6a2d,t1_fcmcqk3,1577804388.0,"my great uncle's name was yrjö. his son's name was yrjö too, so they were called iso-yrjö and pikku-yrjö, meaning big vomit and small vomit."
AskReddit,fcn5gup,t1_fcmlj7h,1577803779.0,"I've heard of a foreign guy who's mother-in-law's name was kyllikki. because he couldn't pronounce finnish ""y"" he called her kullikki. kulli means penis in finnish so that was interesting family event."
AskReddit,fcmzw2f,t1_fcmpci8,1577799089.0,"I gave up after killing 15 cacti. some just dried up and others got too much water. last one seemed ok until I touched it and it broke into half and an army of small black bugs emerged. 

when people ask why I don't have any plants I use cats as an excuse. can't have plants because cats would eat them."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fcmydpp,t1_fcmixbx,1577797551.0,mine too. once I dropped a little drop of ice cream on my toes and she licked it off before I could stop her. now she occasionally licks my toes and between them hoping to find ice cream.
AskReddit,fckx0es,t1_fck8o6n,1577735007.0,"or any detox product really. a little while ago there was news of a woman who ate a detox supplements for months and ended up in hospital because of liver failure. some of those things are actually quite dangerous. if you have a functioning liver and kidneys don't eat that shit. if you don't have functioning liver or kidneys, do what the doctor says and also don't eat that shit."

facepalm,fc8eojc,t1_fc6uebd,1577533222.0,"nope, she just absolutely loved the taste. she's into all kinds of weird foods too so in a way I'm not surprised.  but luckily when I stopped using the spray she lost all interest in the cords because they didn't taste yummy anymore."
facepalm,fc8e82c,t1_fc774rr,1577532935.0,"what ever the taste was, my cat loved it! as soon as a sprayed it on she would run and lick it off. I used it only twice. as soon as I stopped using it she lost all interest in the chords because they didn't taste yummy anymore."
facepalm,fc6cf36,t3_egdb8p,1577477304.0,I bought cat version of this to keep my cats from chewing the cords. in away it worked because the arseholes licked it off and didn't chew anything.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fc5j565,t1_fc59qhl,1577459026.0,I have S&M cat too. I bought her a self-grooming corner brush that she could rub herself to. she only uses it if I slap her butt or side at the same time. when ever she wants to use it she will go next to it and yell at me. if I don't start slapping her she will bite my feet and ass. she does this many times every day.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fc2a66o,t1_fc17gre,1577348115.0,I didn't know that valerian was like catnip before I bought a package of valeria tea to help me sleep. I put it in cupboard unopened and later it was on the floor shreaded and the cats were high as a kite.
blursedimages,fc10fto,t3_efgio4,1577304710.0,that looks like a pretty and sturdy box. I'd love that over any useless junk.
