But the thing that irked me is that it made it sound like counting calories of home cooked food is really hard. Initially Ill admit its a bit of a hassle. But once you have a base of ingredients, it becomes so much easier. Once you scan something and its in the app, its just a case of weighing the chicken and it takes seconds. When it all comes down to it, most of us don't eat that many different things. 

The calories burned though, yah the apps and websites are way innacurate, my TDEE comes out at like 3700, and I know eating 3000 will cause me to either gain or stay the same even when weight training 5 days a week.

dvdcollection,fgn5s4s,t1_fgn1t8g,1580938244.0,"Up until I think 2 years ago I had only a handful of blu rays, I had previously had more but sold them almost all due to needing money due to a gambling error (I don't do that anymore lol)

But my wife started volunteering in a charity shop and they had a blanket deal of 10 ""media"" for £5, so cds, books, games, dvds and blu rays. So she would volunteer, send me photos of the inventory and I would pick out 10 and my already decent dvd collection grew.

Then I went into CeX one day (UK electronics second hand chain store) and I saw some dirt cheap blu rays, like 50p £1 and was buying arm fulls at a time. Not long after that I decided it was time to not buy more dvds unless super rare or flat out not on blu ray, (stargate sg1 looking at (you) and so now I have a lot of blu rays, fuck loads actually.

Now I love new tech, which makes my rather slow adoption of 4k so weird, when it comes down to it, its probably money, while not poor, I don't have endless money and 4k blu rays aint cheap enough that I can just mass buy them yet. Still I will be now going out of mu my way to get some stand out 4ks.

I want pacific rim, then I will own including the blu ray that comes with it, 5 copies? Unless you countbthe 3d one. I have regular blu ray, then I saw this 3d one with the box in the shape of gypsie danger, then the steelbook lol."

I have many thoughts on this, also will admit to massive bias here,I despise smokers and smoking, I think it's a dirty stupid habbit and if people wanna kill them selves fine but second hand smoke is a thing and fuck people that smoke around others. 

So details, I M35 with a 4 year old preemie with moderate chronic lung disorder from her time on a ventilator. I already hated smoke but all this has made it so much worse. Anyway, during her time in the nicu on a ventilator she would desat a lot (for those not in the know oxygen saturation should be as close to 100% as possible, in the nicu above 94% was the goal, under 88 was worrying and under 80 is fucking panic.

So my mum and her husband (inrefuse to call him step dad) were both big smokers, they would come to visit us (her) in hospital and would hold her. We quickly realised just the residue of smoke on them caused her to desat under 94, when we asked the doctors if this could be causing it they told us it absolutely could be. Me and my wife came to a very easy decision and have them an ultimatum. Stop smoking or you will not be visiting her, at all. 

They stopped. 

I have other thoughts on smoking, I take my daughter to school, it's like a 10 min walk, the amount of people (almost always mothers) I see dangling cigarettes at waist height (their childrens face height) is fucking shocking. Or dangling it near new borns heads in a pushchair I mean ffs new borns. These people don't deserve to be mothers imo. 

So anyway all that said, fuck your inlaws and the fact your husband sides with them, fuck him too. Do not cave in, prioritise your baby."
