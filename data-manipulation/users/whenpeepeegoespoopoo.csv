paydaybuilds,ffcfjbd,t3_estjs4,1579798366.0,"There are a few ways you can make a build. You can start with a weapon and build around it, pick a perk deck and build around it, or pick a skill tree and build around it. Using a weapon would be like building around something like the dual strykes or grimms by using a good perk deck and skills to make them as strong as possible. For a perk deck, I would look at the strengths and weaknesses, then try to soften the weaknesses and bolster the strengths. That would be like picking grinder, then  choosing grimms to compliment the Regen ability, but taking a light vest and armor skills to soften the lack of survivability. You could also build around a skill tree. This would be more of your stealth of overkill builds. Build around the steal tree with silenced weapons, or build around overkill with a judge and dual strykes to mow down anything."
