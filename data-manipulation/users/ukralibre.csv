When you read the list - it is full blown MCAS. For example my relative had occasional headaches, i told him because of his father he must have HAT **Hereditary alpha tryptasemia.** Five years later he has got GI symptoms, neurological and now he is convinced because food list match. First years i had occasional GI symptoms and lots of neurological, now it's worse because of medical mistake and natural progression
