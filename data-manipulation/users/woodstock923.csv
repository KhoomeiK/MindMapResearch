Yes this is a sub focused on Warren for President. Being generally open-minded, I’d say most folks here are interested in hearing the perspectives of others. Especially since the race is close and many people are undecided, perhaps folks can be persuaded to join a thoughtful AND progressive campaign.


That being said, trolls are not as obvious anymore. Concern trolling is particularly noxious. And agents both foreign and domestic are seeking to promote infighting, for various ends. (Not all conspiracies are false, some are confirmed by multiple national intelligence agencies.)


On the surface it would appear the numbers are stacked in Bernie’s favor against Warren, and the brigading is tiresome (thank you mods). I don’t like seeing my little comments go from 50 to 0 karma...


BUT as 2016 taught us, what we see reflected in polls and social media is not necessarily real life. I don’t think many liberals and Democrats think Warren is a snake (I love snakes). So all we can do is be vigilant, but move forward. Grow a thick skin, but not turn away people who are looking for real answers.

ElizabethWarren,fefb46l,t1_fecqjky,1579052422.0,"I don’t think it’s a matter of believing one over the other. I trust both of them. Bernie is likely denying the implication that he said something like “A woman can’t be president”, which I believe. Warren is likely validating that they had a conversation in which Bernie expressed his doubt that America was ready for a woman president, which I also believe. See? Nuance. But we can’t have that when only the loudest voices are amplified.


To those who say “why didn’t she provide more context then...” my gut instinct is “hey, yeah, she’s the great explainer after all”, but I’m also a young man. I haven’t experienced a lifetime of discrimination and doubt about my exceptional ability. She knows more than I do about this kind of thing, that getting into the weeds was going to benefit no one, and that instead of defending a male coworker’s somewhat insensitive comment, she felt like acknowledging the event without minimizing it, and diplomatically proposed to find common ground and move forward. That’s what I fucking want in a President right now, not four more years of shooting from the hip."
