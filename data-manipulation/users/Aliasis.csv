But within anime, it's not exactly unusual to have guys with more stereotypically feminine fashion styles!"

The nice answer is that, the game obviously intends for both women to have romantic subplots with Cloud, so both sides are canonically correct and this argument is pointless.

But do I have an opinion? Of course, and it's obviously Aeris. She's the default date option, Cloud's into her right away (agreeing to be her bodyguard for a date), and Cloud's final goal is to meet Aeris in the Promised Land (in the ending, he says this right to Tifa's face, and she just looks like she's kind of accepted it). No, Aeris isn't only into him because he kind of reminds her of an old teenage boyfriend - she explicitly says as much during the date scene, and at any rate, Cloud's personality - even when he thinks he's an ex-SOLDIER is absolutely nothing like Zack's, so this argument is kind of silly. Aeris also was designed as the love interest from the earliest storyboards of the game, so it's hard to deny that she's intended to be the primary love interest. Aeris brings out the best side of Cloud (he seems to have fun and finally gain his balls to do the right thing over money after meeting her) and vice versa (he supports her quest to find out more about the Ancients).

But compare that to the dynamic with Tifa - years of pent up shame, feelings of failure, and worst of all, a complete lack of communication. Tifa's inability to tell Cloud the truth until it's too late nearly cost the party their lives. More than that, frankly, Tifa didn't seem remotely interested in Cloud during their childhood, and only sort of perked up after all the other boys had already left and Cloud said he was leaving, too. Tifa wants a hero and just shoves Cloud in that box, even when it's built on lies. Not to mention, Tifa is completely co-dependent and weak in terms of personality. Not just her inability to talk truthfully with Cloud, but being unable to continue on the important mission of, you know, *saving the world* and instead needing to clock out and hang out with comatose Cloud. (Compare that to Aeris, who will run off to save the Planet when needed.) I couldn't really forgive her for that, and more importantly, it seemed to me that even if Cloud and Tifa got together, they wouldn't have a healthy dynamic. It would've been built on Tifa's obsessive fantasies and Cloud's guilt.

Sure, it's obvious Tifa and Cloud to develop a close friendship by the end of the game, and yes, there's an optional implied romantic scene before the finale. But it seemed pretty clear to me that in the ending sequence, Cloud chose Aeris, whatever that meant."
cats,feosiy9,t1_fensnc7,1579304788.0,"That, and a lot of college kids literally don't know how to take care of themselves without their parents' help and really should focus on that before learning to take care of an animal that is 100% reliant on them for everything. If you can't do your own laundry and keep your apartment clean, I feel like you won't clean your litter box every day. Plus, you've got to be able to *afford* the animal - in addition to daily expenses like food and litter, there's vet appointments and you've got to realize that an emergency at any time could mean a huge bill. And, I should mention, student housing usually doesn't allow pets, and a cat isn't going to do well in a tiny dorm anyway.

There are very good reasons not to get a cat in college, because a cat is a 15-20 year commitment and they deserve homes that can care for them.

That being said, there are people out there who adopt cats in college and make it work! If you're prepared to make serious adjustments in your life - never traveling too much unless you have close friends/family who can help care for the pet, always being prepared to possibly pay more for housing that allows pets, etc. - then that's absolutely wonderful.

I'd definitely hope that college students understand that commitment before they adopt, though."

aww,fe05qaf,t1_fdztpb6,1578803715.0,"Wait, ferrets definitely do not poo anywhere. Ferrets specifically poop in corners, away from their food and bedding, and will go for litter boxes if you put them there."
menwritingwomen,fdzfmep,t1_fdz032t,1578789741.0,"Yeah.. I don't think Murakami has zero problems with female characters overall, and undoubtedly some of his writing deserves an eyeroll. But every single example posted here seems to massively miss the point of the narrative or passage in question, and then everyone jumps on it and takes it out of context. Not all sexualized, gross, and/or uncomfortable writing is a problem of sexist fetishism."
cats,fdsvd2h,t3_emuo1h,1578708429.0,"That's amazing. I was about to join the throngs of redditors being an armchair zoologist or whatever and going YOU NEED A WIDER BOWL but then your cat picked up the food and put it in his mouth. That's amazing. Rather inefficient for him, but hey, as long as he's having fun. Will probably stop him from eating too fast, too!"

deathnote,fdflhdr,t1_fdehwfk,1578364464.0,"I can confirm this joke has been around since the manga first came out. I almost find it touching that there are kids out there reading Death Note for the first time and just hearing about it now. Even if I was into Death Note before they were even born, what a great legacy the old Death Note fandom left behind. Brings a tear to my eye."
deathnote,fbz6ty5,t1_fbz2pnz,1577236886.0,"Light is indeed ""popular"" with women in the sense that women like him a lot, but he doesn't seem to like them back at all. The manga spells out pretty explicitly that Light only ever ""dates"" women to further his agenda as Kira, and he never once is shown being sexually or romantically interested in them - in fact, it's usually the opposite, that he secretly despises them or at least thinks negative thoughts toward them. (Goes as far as Light's internal monologue saying several very sexist things..)

> Apparently in the How To Read book it even mentions that it’s assumed that he’s on close terms with her before getting the death note.

Nothing that implies any romance, and really, quite the opposite. Yuri's implied to have asked out Light before (pre-Death Note), but he rejected her and in fact told all the girls that he isn't open to dating so he can focus on his studies. It's pretty interesting that this is yet another example of the author deliberately adding details to show that Light *doesn't* date women, even before becoming Kira.

> And he could have bought magazines featuring men instead.

He could've, but that would only push the narrative that Light has a secret to hide. Japan at the turn of the millennium, when the series takes place - even Japan today - is not a place where it's easy to be out of the closet. Light puts so much energy into crafting a public image of being the perfect golden boy, and that ""perfect"" kid has to be completely ""normal"", so straight. Personally, I think if anything, Light reading porno deliberately to put on a show because he knows L is watching is hardly testament to his *heterosexuality*...

Obviously there's no hard evidence that Light is romantically attracted to any gender and Death Note isn't a romance. But the manga goes out of its way again and again to make it clear that Light really doesn't like women."
