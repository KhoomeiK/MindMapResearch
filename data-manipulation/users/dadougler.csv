blender,fguf8yt,t3_f0cukh,1581119353.0,"* Looks like your floor texture may a little bit too low res, especially closer to the camera.
* The floor is just a little too reflective. I can make out the mic a little too well.
* The floor definitely needs some bump or displacement, that will help with the being too reflective too.
* As others have said the XLR connector would be good, and the cable should be thicker.
* The lighting works but I think you should try some other options. The bright light draws your eye away from the mic and that should be the focal point. 
* It look like your already using some red and blue lighting, I would bump the amount of red and blue a bit to make it more dramatic."
blender,fguedea,t1_fgudybq,1581118752.0,Sounds like your on the right track. Try to not get too tied up in perfecting renders early on. It's better to experiment with a bunch of different things than to perfect only a few.

Since you can't see the ""ground"" you lose some sense of height. Are these the tops of 100 story building or the tops of 10 story buildings? 

It helps if your art is telling a story. And has a focal point. What should I be looking at this gives interest?

It's definitely not bad just mostly needs focus. Maybe less global illumination and let the ambient light from the colors do more of the work."
blender,fgud5kx,t1_fgucsrf,1581117923.0,Try upload it to a youtube channel instead of imgur. That may be the only difference between the tutorial and your result. Different platforms will apply different amounts of compression. Imgur is trying to be mobile/ social media friendly and compress pretty aggressively.

blender,fgucmnv,t1_fgua4t6,1581117571.0,"Yeah so it's defiantly an issue with compression. Video codecs like h.264 encode information based around movement. Meaning the small movement from one frame to the next will encode nicely, but when there is lots of fast motion the codec does a much worst job compressing resulting in the what your seeing in the video. This is probably happening once when you render the video file out of blender and then when you upload to imgur they compress it again. 

[Here is a Tom Scott video that demonstrates this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6Rp-uo6HmI)

First if your not rendering to an image sequence I highly recommend that. You can then re-encode the video to test different settings without having to re-render the scene. I typically just render to a png sequence but you can also use tiff for lossless and better dynamic range. Once you have your sequence rendered to images add the image sequence to the video sequence editor and set these settings for the video quality:

Try these settings:

* Encoding> Container: MPEG-4
* Video> Video Codec: H.264
* Output Quality: Constant Bitrate
* Encoding Speed: Good
* Keyframe Interval: 4
* Bitrate 10000
* Min: 0
* Max 12000

You can also try the WEBM/ VP9 codec but make sure you put it in a WEBM container.

You will still likely run into issues if you upload because they will just re-encode the video again. You can usually look up the recommended codecs and settings for various hosts to minimize the amoung of compression they do. 

Also if you render to image sequence you can download a tool like ffmpeg or handbrake to encode the sequence to a video with more control that blender."

This could be a need app for company/ product reviews. Open the app and point it at a company logo or product and have a summary of reviews or star rating pop up on the object."
blender,fgu9ejq,t3_f0fciz,1581115432.0,What is your rendering workflow? Are you rendering directly to video or rendering to image sequence first? I think your running into compression issues. Can you upload a still rendering of what your expecting it to look like?
