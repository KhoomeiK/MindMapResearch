* Every Indian in western media -> either a comedian, a creepy nerd or both.                 
* Physical stereotypes -> short, smell like curry and have small dicks                                
* Cultural stereotypes -> patriarchal and perverts 
 
_________

It is pretty hard for them, to the point that many Indians will simply avoid trying to hit on anyone outside their ethnicity for fear of considered perverts.                                  
Others will often be very cautious on dates with Americans, very consciously trying to avoid being associated with the stereotypes, coming off as stiff and cold.

Some problems are of Indian's own creation. The cultural obsession with fair skin makes some think that the white men have innately better chances. The sexual repression growing up in India, means they are already fighting a huge amount of inexperience in dating.            
Lastly, no matter how much you try, it is **insanely hard** to fully integrate into a culture, and that includes adopting their dating etiquette. 

Nothing comes naturally. I find this to be greater point, where westerners will often ask immigrants to integrate without understanding how wildly difficult it is to do so.               
Learning to be fluent in the language, not just grammer but also slang and a foreign accent, adopting postures and outfits, picking up sports they have no interest in, learning songs they have no nostalgia towards, learning the subtlest of cultural cues (fuck me, this one has been the hardest of them all) and so much more.                       
Every single thing that comes naturally to a citizen, is a very measured and deliberate step for an immigrant.                          
It also does not help that it is very hard to come off as interesting, when all your interests and skills are alien to a westerner and your humor needs cultural context to make sense. 

__________

Britain seems to have kind of moved past that, where Indians are a more integrated part of society. Similarly, now the Chinese-American community seems to be breaking away from their old stereotypes. But, in the US, Indians still get kind of type casted as a person, until they prove otherwise. Maybe they still have a generation to go.

> men are completely clueless with western dating etiquette 

True, but those people are unfamiliar with most western things. This would apply to any sufficiently rural non-western group of people.               
A lot of well educated Indians, are often familiar with the etiquette ( They grew up with the Internet), but lack any experience well into their 20s (when they usually arrive in a western nation). Compound that with the fact that Indians in the west have really low self esteem due to the average stereotype of an Indian male looking to date being pretty negative (they smell of curry, small dicks, not considered attractive, often short and scrawny, assumed patriarchal and creepy) and that mistakenly adds a few more unfortunate blokes to the already large list of clueless people.

> no idea how to cook, clean or really even dress themselves

This seems to be true about most men in the west as well......                         
If anything, most Indians I know, cook once they arrive in the west, because they are cheapskates first and eating out is expensive.                       
I have noticed that many times people in the west are just as clueless about dressing themselves, but since they grew up in the culture, they can just dress how their mom dressed them, and it will still be socially accepted, because that's the norm."

But dealing with family (I mean people you consider family) are almost by definition not transactional in nature. They will often go above and beyond to help out without expectation of reciprocation.              
However, every relationship has a limit. The family might become less likely to go out of their way to help down the line, if you have been outright transactional in your dealings with them. They will eventually respond in such.

Looking at family like a 18 year contract is why parents are kicking kids out as soon as they turn adults. As you grow up, you will realize that non-transactional relationships are very hard to come by. If you have a great relationship with your parents, it doesn't hurt to take the inconvenience of dealing with your little bro/sis for a bit.

I do not know a single big industry team that lets you call move the Master head locally.                      

Most dev processes include going from "" feature branch -> push to remote -PR-> dev -PR-> Master -PR-> Release                               
Each of these have different CI/CD routines associated with them.                   
Then there is the process of adding reviewers, addressing merge conflicts and making sure any BLOBS we commit are the correct ones, since git is pretty much useless with those.           
Also, we routinely merge / rebase different feature branches to avoid histories from diverging, which can be work as well.                            
The cost of a wrong approved PR can mean downtime -> and hundreds pf thousands lost to the company.                 
It is simply better to be slow, deliberate and correct than fast and sorry.

> you simply use a gui instead of understand the core principles of it

I never said that. I use the command line, except for the merge tool and diffing.               
Which are just objectively better..... esp. since we often diff between             
Try it out, the VS code git extension is really good.

I don't want to go into the details of it, but if your argument is that either the underlying graph system (genius as it is) or the UI of Git are accessible, then you are simply being tone deaf to a huge majority of developers who complain about it."

ProgrammerHumor,fei58rc,t1_fehdht1,1579130565.0,"lol, dude I am pretty good at git now. Hell I spend more than 30 minutes a day using it. But, the learning process is what I complain about.

Believe me, a 30 minute git tutorial will not teach you the complex ways in which Version control systems interact with CI/CD pipelines. It is that process that makes fucking up in Git a major issue.

Git gives a core developer too much power and doesn't natively allow that power to be limited (without jumping through major setup pains).             
I have developed on 2 massive software teams. One company used Perforce Helix and another used Git (they literally own Github).                
While git allowed that team to be a lot more flexible, I noticed far less fuck ups in the Perforce Helix VC system.

It is no surprise that Git comes from the same person who owns Linux. Because just like Linux, Git gives you all the power in the world with very little polish. But, every developer I know, has traded that power away and jumped from a linux system to MaxOS for unix development, simply because of the polish of MacOS.                   
What I am asking for, is a MacOS-esque alternative to git."

I did not suggest changing GIT in any meaningful way.

Only to dress it up in pretty script to make it more accessible.

A good example, is that I have already moved to using VScode as a tool for DIFFs and as a MERGE tool and it is wonderful. There are very few things in the world that can't be improved, and Git is not an exception."

I am comparing them to how the west views these cuisines.

I am a strong advocate of not using terms such as Chinese food or Indian food or people going to Thai restaurants and ordering Pho. But, I don't make those decisions.

I am talking about an entirely different base framework on which a cuisine is made made. Cantonese dishes (fish based/ light/ sweet) would never be put under the same umbrella as Sichuan or Hunan, had China not been a single Country.                           
You could spend a month without ever eating the same dish again, in a Taiwanese night market and it is still considered a minor sub-cuisine of Chinese food. That's absurd.

Similarly. India has maybe 10-15 independent cuisines, (that is ignoring the rich street food and tribal cuisines which barely have national availability even in India) and of them, maybe 2-3 are known by people in the west. This is again, looking past the fact that Nepali, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Srilankan food often get bundled into ""Indian food"" as well."
