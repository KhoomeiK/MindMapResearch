nottheonion,ffqooo2,t1_ffqkf82,1580140051.0,Yes and no. Not sure when but they nerfed it a little sometime between 2013ish and a few years ago. But certain symptom combos slow research so utilizing those plus organ failure and other nastiness seems to do the job
PSVR,ffpmkz4,t3_eu8p0u,1580098808.0,"We had a big cold snap here recently, lots of snow and whatnot. My basement I rent is already super cold so yay immersion? I forgot to lock the deadbolt before departing to Skyrim, and my door doesn't have an actual latch so the wind can blow it open on rare occasions. I left a building out into the snow right as my door blew open and blasted me with -12C air (10.4 in freedom units). So realistic lol"

PS4Dreams,fe5jhf5,t3_enubv6,1578870201.0,I was just thinking this. Add VR to the mix and you got yourself a stew.

fatlogic,fd4luqt,t1_fcyml8o,1578168774.0,Well I would actually agree. However a DBZ binge pretty unlikely to kill you. Not so much a moral issue as biology.
