JUSTNOMIL,fgnme2o,t3_ezbaag,1580948002.0,This is great practice for when baby is also a toddler like MIL and throws a fit crying when you say no more candy.
EntitledPeople,fgnkfcr,t1_fgl8lvv,1580946716.0,"The driver didn’t hit the kid in this case though, the kid rode his bike into the side of the car and the mother blamed the injury on the driver. Would she have done the same if he had ridden into a tree?"
EntitledPeople,fgnka3c,t1_fgmvgn0,1580946624.0,"Not at all. Had it gone to court it’s very likely the mother would have had to pay out for the car damages. ‘EP’ didn’t break her kid’s arm, the kid broke his own arm because he wasn’t watching where he was going. His carelessness caused damages, which his mother is legally liable for. You can dislike what I say but it’s still true"
dogs,fgnk2id,t1_fgmko76,1580946499.0,"Not really, as I said chicken is a super common allergy and more than 50% of dogs have some level of intolerance to it. If they’re the same breed there’s a much higher likelihood. You’d be surprised at how many things are common allergies/intolerances"
dogs,fgnjypw,t1_fgmipsu,1580946437.0,Did you follow a proper elimination diet though. They take months
dogs,fgnjrut,t1_fgn9ra4,1580946326.0,"Oh I could rant all day about those situations. The most rage inducing one for me was the pony that was given a prosthetic leg by a rescue and they were all doing a circle jerk of patting themselves on the back. I predicted the pony would be dead within 5 years and I was correct. It spent those years in agonising pain constantly colicking because it was unable to get up and down without help, and because it was compensating with the other side while walking which made the bones and muscles grow wrong. Equines are so different from cats and dogs, prosthetic limbs on them is straight up cruel. 

I also watched another rescue keep an elderly cancer ridden horse alive longer so they could post photos of her decline and wring more money out of the public - they even said *four* vets had advised to euth her because she was in agonising pain and parts of her intestine had died and they kept her alive for another 19 days to get more money out of people. Many rescues will do the same, get an animal that rightfully should be euthed and keep them alive and drop thousands of dollars into them and beg for donations when the money could be spend on multiple animals that have an actual chance at a healthy life"
dogs,fgmi9rn,t3_ez8q6h,1580925113.0,"Have you done a elimination diet to rule out food allergies? Chicken is a super common one and it’s in *everything* pretty much because it’s so cheap. Once you’ve ruled out diet, are they allergic to anything in your environment? Cleaning products, your shampoo, perfume, washing powder etc. 
once that’s been ruled out, have you had skin scrapes done to see if they have mange or mites?
Chlorhexadine foam wash is great as it soothes and cleans, and cones of shame to stop them worrying at it"
dogs,fgmhkwp,t3_ez266w,1580924711.0,"Your family has really let your dog down, eventually he’s going to bite the wrong person and will suffer the consequences that should be going to the owners who failed him. He’s 5-6 yeah? Why hasn’t he been going to the vet for annual check ups and vaccinations? Has he been sterilised and microchipped? Has he ever had a dental checkup? Have you ever had him checked for any of the common problems that plague the breed? Enlarged heart for example, which makes him far more prone to DCM. The fact that he’s a male of a breed that is pretty much 100% chance of developing bladder stones which have a high chance of being life threatening to males. Did your parents do *any* research on the breed before getting him?


Find a behaviourist ASAP, ask them to help you muzzle train him and get him to the vet for a checkup and vaccination. Then continue working with the behaviourist on the other behavioural issues."
EntitledPeople,fgmcopb,t3_ez3jw3,1580922039.0,"So your brother was riding his bike on the footpath and not paying attention to cars coming out of driveways and rammed her car so hard he broke his arm. Sorry dude, he’s at fault here. Sucks that he was injured as a result but maybe he learned from this experience to pay attention to his surroundings"
