running,ff7bvnm,t3_eryzsb,1579645890.0,Wasn't there a study done that proved running on a tread mill actually changes the fundamentals of time?  i.e. two minutes on the tread mill = 16 hours of your life you will never get back.

AskReddit,fedlugs,t3_eol16q,1579014709.0,"I used to love cats. I had two that were really sweet and mellow. I now have two cats that are total pains in the butt. One constantly meows and caterwauls and attacks visitors. Like draws blood! The other is paranoid and screams and hisses when I come near her. They both barf A LOT. They try to kill me by running between my legs when I'm walking down the dark hallway. And kitty litter is a smelly nuisance. I will keep both of them til the day they die and I do love them but they exhaust me!! My 90 lb lab is the best, sweetest, happiest thing in the world. Dogs are better."
AskReddit,fdqqhbh,t1_fdqajb7,1578672695.0,Nivea cream (in the big tub) is the best and cheapest eye cream there is. It doesn't sting your eyes and moisturizes better than any of the super expensive eye creams. Also good on dry chapped feet.

books,fcoor3o,t3_eiazke,1577837581.0,"I loved the book and everything Michael Palin does. He sees everything on such a human level. I didn't take my time with it. It was a page turner for me. Have you seen the mini series ""The Terror"" (season 1) ? It's absolutely amazing. Can't recommend it enough."
TheTerror,fcgjemt,t3_eh1mzg,1577640786.0,I lost it when >!the older man who gave books to the younger man (sorry can't remember everyone's name) just walked out and laid down on the rocks to die!< That scene made me wonder if I would be able to watch the rest. I did and glad about it.
TheTerror,fbmiira,t3_edsnxf,1576984285.0,"This what I loved about the show and the characters.  They weren't just cookie cutter characters either good or evil. They had depth and you could feel for them on so many levels.  Love them, hate them , cringe at them , cry over them.  I wish more movie and tv shows gave us this kind of depth in characters."
