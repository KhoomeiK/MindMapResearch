AskTrumpSupporters,ff3jt3q,t1_ff3i3fg,1579542562.0,"To a certain extent, yes. But such a high turnover indicates at the very least a serious problem in the recruitment strategy, the hiring process, and employer attractiveness. Stability is extremely important to any organization, and the fact of the matter is that an unstable organization is one that is not being efficient with its resources.

Would you disagree with this interpretation? Do you think the turnover in the White House has had a positive or a negative impact on the administration and its capacity to carry out its own agenda?"
AskTrumpSupporters,fep4rfm,t1_fenisss,1579312110.0,"> Sure. But the right people have to win before things can change for the better. I think we can both agree on that even if we disagree on who the right people are.

Sure, the right people have to win, and we most likely have vastly different views on that.

But what do you mean by winning? Elections? I have no faith in either party and think that a two-party system is fundamentally flawed and contrary to the interests of the vast majority of those it is supposedly meant to represent and serve.

> The stakes are too high to play fair with an opposition that doesnt.

Neither party plays fair. Dems are just as corrupt as Republicans. You’ve established your belief that the Dems are generally corrupt trash, but can you honestly tell me that Trump and the Republicans aren’t corrupt either? 

> Dems first.

That’s fine by me, as long as we go after the Republicans just as hard. What do you say to that?"
AskTrumpSupporters,fenfadq,t1_fend81i,1579283444.0,"I understand your sentiment, but don’t you think that as long as we perpetuate this type of thinking that nothing will change?

psg,fel8b0k,t3_epqo9b,1579216230.0,"We bought him after Monaco finished second in the league, and at the time he came off an amazing season, like most Monaco players (B. Silva, Carasco, Fabinho, ...). He was definitely a step up for us, in the sense that we pretty much only had Maxwell as a competitive left back, but we bought him as a promising backup, with the long term goal of having him gradually replace an aging Maxwell in our starting XI. 

Given the context at the time and seeing where he is now, overall he’s been a pretty big disappointment. When fit - he’s pretty injury prone- he definitely brings options to the table in terms of attacking football, although he really lacks quality in his crosses which is really frustrating over time. And defensively, well...he’s not horrendous, but his lack of defensive quality can really become problematic against tougher opponents, especially French elite clubs like Lyon (or whichever club is in form over any given season) or in CL. Kurzawa reminds me a lot of Aurier, in the sense that he’s a great attacking fullback, who can be a liability defensively, but also probably isn’t helped by the fact that he is surrounded by an entourage which imho doesn’t serve him well. 

If he does go to Arsenal, I think it’d be good business for PSG. It’s no secret that he doesn’t fit into today’s PSG, so offloading his salary would definitely be beneficial to us, so long as we can find a suitable replacement. As for Arsenal, I think it will really depends on Arteta and what he’s able to get out of Kurzawa. There’s talent there, but probably not enough discipline and hard work."
