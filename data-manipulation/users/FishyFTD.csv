depression,fepvm2x,t3_eqaqv2,1579332906.0,"Love is real, it just might not be what you think it is. There are many things in this world we confuse for love. Lust, limerence, these things make us feel strong emotions, but the truth is love might not be as powerful as we think. Of course there is familial and platonic love, but I like to think of romantic love as less of an emotion and more of a choice. We can feel emotions, but the concious effort to think rationally is what constitutes love IMO. Love is not as commonplace as lust or inference, but it isnt transient. If someone truly loves you, they don't ""fall out of love."" That simply means they felt something they confused for love. Love, being a choice, rarely changes over time and eventually you'll meet a person mature enough to understand this"
