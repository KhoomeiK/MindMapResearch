popping,ffgefci,t1_fff3e72,1579904394.0,Did not know this subreddit! Thank u!
popping,ffge8tt,t1_fffinrd,1579904278.0,We are bed sheet twins haha
fatlogic,ffefz4i,t3_esqqw3,1579846533.0,"Oh but like are we not supposed to say ur ""sexy, pretty, healthy"" when ur like 600 pounds?"
fatlogic,ff2h5l2,t3_eqob2b,1579505927.0,"It is not normal or, as I most likely think, just not true for her.
I get panik attacs and nope, it will have nothing to do with someone exercising but with something that happened. But at stuff like this its not other people problems."
fatlogic,fejern3,t3_ep4l2t,1579170590.0,I mean yes. If u eat good food. Not if ur overeating for years ans a sugar addict
sex,fehi3pz,t1_feh3xsr,1579116994.0,Was about the last sentence and saying it hurt U. Not her. Pretty much made it sound (at least for me as a non english person) that u where hurt because you werent allowed to see her change and would not have cared how she felt in that moment.
sex,fehhy19,t1_feh5c7y,1579116899.0,"Im not a nativ english speakter. So for me it soundet like he was hurt because she didnt change in front of him and he didnt care about how she felt. Can only translate it for me so idk if stuff is like something i just say in some way.
If then sry"
sex,feh2flj,t3_ep3yhr,1579107736.0,"Professional/a Therapist. 
Ur most likely not in the right head space to enjoy it.

Also: take it slow. Even if ur just laying there and ur kissing or something. Just go as far as u think it's good for you. Ur partner showing u that he won't push u is great.

And I think both together can help u over all and maybe also help u to bring u in the head space where u can just enjoy."
sex,feh1wdj,t1_fegzpzn,1579107421.0,"So f*** her feelings because u can't see her chanfe clothes?

Edit: read down there why i said that. (Under this comment)
>Soundet like op of the comment wouldnt care about how the girl feels even if she didnt want something."
sex,fdqt0k6,t1_fdqsfsc,1578674245.0,"It wouldnt ruin ur life to a point where a normal, healthy person would say ""I am going to kill myself"".
Thats why I said u schould seek help."
sex,fdqrs41,t1_fdqqvn8,1578673488.0,"Normal to not want a child, yes. But saying u WILL kill urself isnt normal."
sex,fdqq844,t1_fdqay0o,1578672534.0,Having sex or gettin suicidal about maybe having a child?
sex,fdq2myv,t1_fdpzyby,1578651844.0,"Still. If u are that scared of sex just don't have sex.
It is not normal to say u put ur dick in someone but would kill uself if a child comes out. 

Seek help or don't do it."
sex,fdpzorq,t1_fdpuoak,1578647643.0,It can still give the girl the feeling that shes not good enough/doesnt feel good.
sex,fdptp2e,t1_fdps3br,1578640075.0,Yep. Most girls would be offendet.
fatlogic,fdlgzgo,t3_elw2xp,1578523813.0,"So it's my genetic that if I eat more then 1400 I'm gaining but I'm also natural thin because of my genetic? 
So I'm genetic fat and thin? I start to not even understand what these people are even trying to tell me."
fatlogic,fdlae8k,t3_elkhce,1578519834.0,Eat 500 and i guess drink pure sugar?
