Jogging doesn't have to be interesting. You keep distracting yourself with podcasts and music all the time so you don't have to actually be here in the moment. They suggested jogging because it gets you in the moment. You'll find that reading books will become enjoyable on it's own again because you aren't constantly distracting yourself and training yourself into getting quick dopamine hits from something else. Jogging can be a form of mediation, but trying mindfulness exercises and meditation can also benefit."
