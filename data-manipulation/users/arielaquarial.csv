When you give them pellets, you can be sure theyre eating it all/giving them enough.  With flakes, you have to not only worry about the size, but they immediately disperse and start dissolving and sinking. This will dirty you water a lot quicker. A good pellet will float for a few minutes and give your betta time to 'catch' it.  If you decide to switch, it might take a while for your betta to recognize it as food especially since most pet fish stores feed them flakes."
bettafish,ffake1g,t1_ffak2d9,1579737918.0,"Definitely too much. I give my little guy 3 little betta pellets per feeding, or 2 bloodworms.  Keep in mind a bettas stomach is only as big as their eye!"
fatlogic,ffajsbr,t1_ffadtxv,1579737483.0,"Right? Its not like I'm on a diet of chocolate and wine! Most foods I cut out have very little nutritional value, anyways. I ate some of my trigger foods over Christmas week and all of my symptoms came back within a day. If I can avoid it, I definitely will!"
bettafish,ffajb3w,t1_ffacgqu,1579737131.0,"Skipping feedings for the next 2-3 days will help bloating. In fact, you can skip feedings for up to a week if symptoms don't go away. I regularly skip a couple feedings a week to prevent overfeeding.  I still recommend keeping an eye out for the pineconing. For now, skip the treat until he's back to himself and then try reintroducing it. If it happens again, you'll know to ditch the treat ."
bettafish,ffac0tf,t3_esijbo,1579731977.0,"It's possible that he's bloated due to overeating. If you look down at him from up above,  do his scales stick out? Its called pineconing and it's a symptom of dropsy. Google pineconing for an idea of what I mean."
fatlogic,ffabc3o,t3_es9s6i,1579731561.0,"I changed my way of eating in Aug 2018 and cut out certain foods. I wasnt overweight or anything (although I'm not complaining about the -20lbs), but i was suffering from GERD and IBS. EVERY SINGLE TIME I hang out with a friend,  her SIL is constantly asking me ""oh, you're still eating like that?"". Yes, Brenda. This is my life now, deal with it. This is why she's overweight and can't seem to lose any weight.  I offered her help, but once you start talking about changing your diet, people suddenly lose interest."

SkincareAddiction,ff1u84g,t3_er1kpm,1579486296.0,"I cut out soft cheeses and switched to organic heavy whipping cream (for my coffee), and i stopped getting dairy-related breakouts. I still use butter, but other than the heavy cream for my coffee, I don't eat any other dairy."

fatlogic,fezy9o9,t1_fey9jeb,1579463180.0,"I remember this episode! I wish they made more of them. I also really like Secret Eaters (which is also on youtube). The title says it all. They can't figure out why they're not losing weight since they only eat \~1400cals a day, but surprise surprise, they're not accounting for their morning doughnut, 3 cheeseburgers, and all of the other snacks throughout the day (not to mention all of the alcohol!)."

SkincareAddiction,fetcbmq,t1_fesm8yd,1579373851.0,"So, I switched to the TO vitamin c suspension 23% + HA spheres 2%. Its a strong one which is why I could see the difference, and it tingled the first few weeks I used it, but I'm on my second tube and I definitely plan to keep using it.

Edit: I had a red spot on my nose for years from aggressively popping a pimple, and it took care of it in a few months."
