loseit,fehgyui,t3_ep0lsb,1579116330.0,"Hey, I don't really know what to say. I wanna lose about 25 kg, I've already lost 4 kg, but I'm afraid I won't be able to keep losing weight like this. 

I gained about 6kg since 2018, and now I'm trying to loose it but I'm hitting a point where its harder to loose, that was the reason I gave up in 2018 and ended up gaining weight. I hope I'll stay motivated enough to finally lose those 21 kg left, I will keep you updated!"

depression,fe5bihf,t3_enud81,1578867329.0,"Idk I think I'll give mine more time just to see if they'll work, it's the first time I'm taking meds. Maybe you need a heavier antidepressants? Idk"
SuicideWatch,fe51nxd,t3_ents6k,1578864871.0,"Maybe they just want to help someone bc no one helped them when they needed it. Idk if that even makes sense but maybe a stranger has better chances at a good life than yourself, so you want them to see that and help them get through the rough moments. Idk"
depression,fe50k3i,t3_ensjqp,1578864580.0,"I mean... I had the urge to projectile vomit all the time every day for the first few weeks, but other than that I don't really feel any different. I should give it more time, but idk just telling u there are some really bad side effects but they  won't last forever"
SuicideWatch,fe4xn5o,t3_enta8u,1578863798.0,"I used to be that guy, my ""friends"" would beat me if I didn't give them the homework. I just started avoiding them, and I finally realised who my real friends were"

SuicideWatch,fc3ovap,t1_fc3o2ab,1577394930.0,"Distracting yourself is about not focusing(on my problems at least), which is the only thing I'm good at. This may be an unhealthy coping mechanism, but I like to make a lot of different worlds with different scenarios which I'm pretty and smart and liked by everyone, and other narcissistic stuff like that. But also scenarios where I kill myself and people actually care about me. I fantasise about suicide and self harm a lot, and for some reason it makes me feel better. I haven't self harmed for a long time, but I still have the urge to so this helps. 

I was so caught up in in this imaginary world, I wasn't living in the real one. I wouldn't recommend you try this coping method, but maybe if you can control it you can try. Just be careful, you don't wanna go down that rabbit hole"
SuicideWatch,fc3nbce,t1_fc3mwe2,1577393812.0,"I usually watch YouTube, play video games or sleep. I don't really have much free time with school and all, but when I do these are the easy solutions. I occasionally go out with friends, but it distracts me like only 50% of the time. Sleeping is the best form of escapism I know works, for me at least, maybe you can find something similar?"
SuicideWatch,fc3mn5y,t3_eg0o9i,1577393337.0,"Hey man, I know things can be pretty shit at times, especially at the holidays. Just do whatever you can to distract yourself, that's what helps me keep going"
