I know the cost of running their servers and laser scanning everything must be pretty high, and I want them to pay their developers well so that they stay on and keep doing high quality work.

So, expensive, but arguably justified."
iRacing,fgo0wjk,t1_fgnn0xt,1580957241.0,"I'd rather have the current system than any of the bad F2P models out there. If paying a sub fee and paying for cars and tracks means that those things are all of amazing quality and the height of simulation, then so be it. 

There are plenty of options if you want a racing game that's a one-time purchase, but we're all here for a reason."
todayilearned,fgnbmi0,t1_fgn3w5n,1580941460.0,">Sir Humphry made a bit of a mess of naming this new element, at first spelling it alumium (this was in 1807) then changing it to aluminum, and finally settling on aluminium in 1812. His classically educated scientific colleagues preferred aluminium right from the start, because it had more of a classical ring, and chimed harmoniously with many other elements whose names ended in -ium, like potassium, sodium, and magnesium, all of which had been named by Davy.

So basically, it was kinda fucked from the beginning.

>The official change in the US to the -um spelling happened quite late: the American Chemical Society only adopted it in 1925, though this was clearly in response to the popular shift that had already taken place. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially standardised on aluminium in 1990, though this has done nothing, of course, to change the way people in the US spell it for day to day purposes.

So really, technically the Brits are right, but at the same time I can see the case for why it has a few different spellings."

cars,fga70bk,t1_fga522y,1580647556.0,"Exactly. As a racing fan and a sim racer, pretty much every moment of racing in the movie just made me wish it was literally anything else.

 I would have preferred to see what really happened when they developed the car after losing the first Le Mans. The Ford engineers who were called nerds in the movie really upped their game the second time around. While Shelby did his thing, the engineers pretty much made the first racing simulator and used cutting-edge computing to gather data from the car that changed how race car development was done thereafter. But no, in the movie they're just nerds who didn't have that practical blue collar workin man common sense to tape yarn to the car."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffum6ia,t1_fftnm3o,1580244897.0,"One of the letters in my name is an S, where the usual spelling uses a C. Everyone assumes that I spelled it wrong when contacting them. I usually just let it slide, unless it's for something important, in which case I spell it out *very* slowly and clearly multiple times throughout the conversation so that they have plenty of time to still spell it wrong anyway. It doesn't change the pronunciation at all so it's whatever I guess, but I get frustrated as hell when someone starts an argument with me saying that *I* spell *my own* name wrong. Bitch, I'm buying insurance and it fucking better have my actual name on the policy."
spaceporn,ffh0fjv,t1_ffgz6lt,1579919778.0,"Well I'm not really knocking its mechanics or anything, but I mean that 99% of its relevance today is due to the graphics, whereas we remember a game like Bioshock because of its setting and narrative rather than its graphics.

Justrolledintotheshop,ffgbkle,t1_ffg7x4o,1579902629.0,"Well let me clarify that this isn't something I did all that often. For something like the gas cap, I would only have to mention a refund if they were being very indecisive and I was *very* sure that was the problem. I only went all the way down to absolutely match Amazon for a loss that one time to demonstrate to the shop customer that I was willing to be there when he was in a bind. After that I was able to get him to compromise within the profit margin. 

As for discounts for counter customers, those went only to regulars that were extremely cool and only on items that were somewhat high prices but had a lot of wiggle room. Even then, it was all case-by-case. And of course some people you could just tell were down on their luck and needed a bit of help to not break the bank completely. 

All that said, I was routinely top seller in the store, coming second only to the Asst. Manager, who had grown up in the town and knew all of the shop owners/employees. I say that to illustrate that it's not like I was giving handouts, but sometimes, if you just give 'em the pickle, it goes a long way to a beneficial customer-store relationship."

Justrolledintotheshop,fffxfgb,t1_fffvszj,1579893911.0,"I was lucky enough to work for a certain store (think green and red) that actually was willing to take a hit in the name of customer service. They probably would have asked me to slow my roll if I was doing it constantly, but just doing a quick warranty return for something small like that was seen as making a small sacrifice to ensure a customer left feeling that we really did everything we could to solve their problem and make them happy.

Really, I had quite a bit of leeway for those things. Pro tip: the employee discounts at this chain can be quite significant, going as low as wholesale purchase price depending on the brand. We were authorized to override prices on most of our stock to be as low as our discount if it meant making a sale to a happy customer. Treat the boys in green like human beings, and they could potentially save you a lot of money. On the other side, if you came in and asked for this discount every time, my hands would suddenly be tied very tight and you would be told that, regrettably, there was just nothing I could do to lower the price. Ya know, ""manager's really been on by back about it"" kinda thing lol.

Edit: One particular case that comes to mind was for a used car dealership in town. They called asking for a price on a part. Shops that we did business with already had a decent discount, but this guy had been on Amazon seeing that he could get the part for half the price. He told me as much after I gave him our price, and hung up. I grabbed the part, mocked up an invoice, threw it in the delivery truck and drove it to him. He saw that I had matched the Amazon price and I told him ""We have our quoted prices, but never assume I'm not willing to work with you to get the price where you need it. I want you buying your parts from me. If this part fails, I'll have a warranty replacement to you in 15 minutes. Good luck doing that with Amazon."" 

The next month, that shop had increased their purchases at our store by a decent percent. Customer satisfaction is paramount."

Justrolledintotheshop,fferkdi,t1_ffenomo,1579862041.0,"I worked in an auto parts store that offered free ""check engine"" code reading. One of the most common codes was for an Exhaust Gas Recirculation leak. The #1 cause for that code was a broken/wrong gas cap. Similar thing on the PCV, though that was far more rare. If it doesn't seal exactly right, the ECU is gonna bitch about it. We would say to the customers ""Before you take it to a shop, buy a cap from us and see if that fixes it. It's by far the cheapest potential fix, and if that's not the problem, I'll immediately do a full refund for the cap and recommend a good mechanic."" 99% of the time that fixed it. I think only once in the 2 years I worked there was the issue actually in the EGR system."

Secondly, it's more about highlighting the wealth inequality that exists in nearly every country. In the same country where a person is paid $5 a month or whatever to make designer handbags, there's a person living in a mansion who has his teeth brushed for him. It's a problem everywhere.
