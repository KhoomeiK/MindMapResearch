I get the whole being sick thing often sucks because I have that issue too and goddamn was it hell for me just before I got my gallbladder out (especially right before, but even for years I would get sick often). I'd always feel really guilty when I ended up not making it to work because kept throwing up or I was in too much pain from my stomach or a headache, or some other issue (thanks MS).

BUT that card is still yours for covering for her and she's not being punished for ""just taking a day off"" by not getting a gift card?
Oh I'm absolutely sure she had gotten talked to about how many days she's missed, from being in that position. Still though for it being framed as taking a day off (pffft) and expecting you to give her your card that YOU got for covering her work is bs.

If someone got something for covering my work while I was out, especially if it was work that they didn't like I wouldn't expect them to give me a card. I'd be feeling bad enough as is. Hell I'd be feeling that much worse about being gone on the busier days. Slow days suck, sure, but at least manageable and thanks  for covering. Busy days I'd feel like hell and be practically kissing ass and at least buying snacks.

Course NTA."

WTF,fglmx0r,t1_fglcre5,1580904847.0,"I had 6 cats once (though one we got from someone that said he'd take her back eventually and never did) but they were all fixed, all used to people, all box trained (though the one kept peeing in this one corner or would pee on papers. Goddamn was it frustrating. Even with a box she'd still pee outside it). 

We had a big house, didn't have carpets, and would clean up right away. Mom also tended to be somewhat neurotic about smell and cleaning so litter boxes where cleaned pretty often, had the biggest one be this tote box on the basement stairs (they couldn't get to the basement, just on the stairs) and a cat door on the door to the stairs.

Down to 3 as most of them have aged and passed, and when the 23-24 yr old goes it will be 2 (since did get new ones so now have a 10 yr old and a 2yo) in a much smaller place. No litter box problems and the litter ± pads we use are REALLY good with odor.

Considering a kitten for the 2yo eventually since she's been a mom and reacts so stronger to kitten noises, but there's so much work involved with kittens, including litter training, socialization, as well as vet and everything else that we're on the fence about it.

That's definitely the thing with kittens. I've brought so many home as a kid and that's why we ended up with all of them. Would have been more but did find home for some litter mates and problem cats that were friendly but problem pee'rs (like one that peed on mom's head. Absolutely a friendly cuddle baby but uuuuuuh.... He went to a farm house and did well out there for a good number of years)

Absolutely can't just get some kittens and just leave them. They're a responsibility that have to make a sacrifice for. Vacation? Not anymore! Especially if they were feral. Those babies are going to need a ton of  socialization time even if they had been around people. 
Heck it took a decent amount of time for Bunny (the now 23yo) to become semi-less skittish with people to tolerant, and even longer to become a lap cat. And I had to bottle feed her. Her half-brothers weren't nearly so bad since found them before they opened their eyes but so much worse for needing attention because of age. There were shifts. Fuck that for there being vacations with the babies. 
(Eventually did give 2 to a friend of mine when the babies were old enough to be ok.)

Sorry this is long but baby cats can be a lot of work. They're babies. She shouldn't just take them because oh they're cute, then expect them to be fine with how she's been having them. She's seriously screwing things up and making it harder for them to adjust later"
AskReddit,fglef2z,t3_ez0c7z,1580893476.0,"""You're too young to have/to be dealing with.....""

Oh well shit, that fixes everything then doesn't it? Guess now that you told me all that pain and sickness shit I've been going through is going to go away and wait until the proper age to come back I guess!

Nevermind I'm 30 and been dealing with a lot of it for years, and lot of papers/research say that the age things started is around the usual age things tend to pop up anyways.... And even if it wasn't I'm still goddamn dealing with it.


But hey you guys say that I'm too young for it, so just have to make sure to let my body know it needs to knock it off and wait until later to be an asshole."
