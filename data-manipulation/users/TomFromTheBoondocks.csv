Paranormal,ff6qj5h,t1_ff5qso2,1579632783.0,There are several theories. People say that they're portals for spirits and ghosts and demons and shit to come through so sleeping in front of them just makes it easier for them to interact with you. With Feng-Shui I guess people believe that when you dream your soul leaves your body (astral projection) and when it has to return it might get confused about which body to return to and if it tries to go through your reflection you're fucked. I'm obviously not an expert and I definitely take the mirror theories with a grain of salt but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Like imagine waking up in the night and seeing something in the mirror that isn't there in your actual room. Hell no.

Cringetopia,fejf9or,t1_feje54h,1579171352.0,"I guess I did a poor job of explaining it. I'm talking about white culture as it exists today. It's completely different than all of the old, and ethnically and culturally distinct groups that contributed to what you're talking about. It wasn't just ""white people built Europe"" it was a ton of ethnically and culturally diverse groups. Like how Norwegians are distinct from Russians in their appearance and cultural practices. What I'm saying is that those things that you're talking about that were so amazing are just absent in today's ""white"" culture, where as non-white traditions have historically stood the test of time. Quinceñeras for instance. What's today's white equivalent in the west? St. Patrick's day for example, a cultural abomination compared to the actual reasons the Irish people are historically fascinating. Western white people are generally just one big blend of people who have little to no connection whatsoever to their culturally rich past. It's emphasized in the US because we're even more removed from our European past. And that last paragraph is ignorant as fuck mate, borderline racist."
Cringetopia,fejdbab,t1_fejad8f,1579168394.0,"There's no such thing as modern white culture. Look at ethnic or indigenous cultures, they have coming of age ceremonies and naming ceremonies and other unique, cool shit that give meaning to them as members of their group. Coming of age ceremonies give children some semblance of progress and achievement starting at very young ages and continuing through to adulthood. White kids in Western societies today don't really have that anymore. There's more to it than that but it is interesting to read about, look into cultural anthropology. Hopi, Zuntwasi(?) and Masai are really interesting to read about. Only fun thing I ever studied in school."
