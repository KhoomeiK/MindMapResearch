They also patched a paladin being able to solo him. To do so, they needed the ""reckoning"" talent which gave the paladin an automatic extra melee swing every time they suffered from a critical hit. There was no limit to how many stacks of this buff you could get. So a paladin would go into a duel with a rogue and the paladin would allow them to hit them for hours, accumulating the stacks. I believe if you do /sit to sit down, it's an automatic crit if you get hit too. The rogue literally had to have multiple sets of weapons because they would break from all the use.

Another fun thing you could do before they patched it was bombing the Ironforge auction house. 

There was 1 auction house per faction in Vanilla and the Alliance one was located in the dwarven capital Ironforge. It was in a very small room and it was always full to the brim with people. Technology being what it was in 2004-2005, that part of the city was laggy as hell because of the concentration of players in that small room.

In the first 40 man raid, Molten Core, there was a boss called Baron Geddon. During the fight he would randomly place a ""living bomb"" debuff on a player. It would be a simple countdown after which it detonates and deals massive damage to the player and everyone around them. The way you would deal with this mechanic was to have the player run away from others and focus healing on them. 

The ""bug"" part was that Baron Geddon could target a hunter/warlock pet with the ability and the hunter/warlock could cheese the mechanic by dismissing their pet. Funnily enough, the game remembered that the pet has that debuff though so a few jokers used that to get the debuff in MC, go back to Ironforge and kill everyone in the auction house room. 

At least it helped with the lag, at least for a few minutes while everyone released their spirit and ran back from the graveyard."
