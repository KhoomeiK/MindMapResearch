Thanks!"

cybersecurity,fe6bim5,t1_fe68730,1578886220.0,"I got a Humble Bundle for certifications -- basically 15 books on different certs and one of them is the Sec+ book. I also have books for the Net+, A+, and many more, can't remember of the top of my head.

I also watch Professor Messer's videos. I find that they are more of a general overview than a deep dive -- which is probably what they are meant to be.

I do have networking knowledge but nothing hands on which I would say is my downfall so far. I'm looking at the CCNA instead of the Net+ -- thoughts?

Also, if you decide to go to another company, they might have the requirement to have a degree to move up the ladder. They might not. Again, like you said, it's where you want to go."
cybersecurity,fe66d60,t3_envk8c,1578882797.0,"I'm basing my response on the text you've provided and my personal experience -- I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I'm going my Master of Science in Computer Science focusing in cybersecurity.

I would say that you should get a BS degree. As /u/AdvancedCranberry said, it's going to be hard to get into management without a degree (I know a guy who is nearly 60 who came back to school to get his degree because he couldn't get a promotion -- and this guy has been in cybersecurity nearly his entire career -- he doesn't need a degree but he can't get a promotion without it).

Also, as others have stated, many companies offer tuition reimbursement so that is a great thing you should take advantage of if your company offers it.

Getting a degree, IMO, teaches you many things besides just studying and taking tests, it teaches you how to study efficiently, think about problems in a different way, time management, navigating bullshit procedures, dealing with people, soft skills -- public speaking, networking, etc, and much more.

Imagine how powerful your resume would be with a degree + certs + experience -- I feel as you would be the first on the list for many places.

**However**, you have a good head start and I wouldn't get rid of that for a degree -- You can go to college part time and work full time so you gain all the experience in the field.

Think about this as this isn't a decision to be taken lightly. Talk to your boss, your colleagues, your friends and family, and get their input on this -- getting a different perspective really helps.

So those are my two cents, take it with a grain of salt. If you are going to go for a degree, do it now as when you get settled into your career, it will be hard with all the other stuff going on. I'm 22 and I decided to get this done early because of my particular situation, and once you get you degree, no one can take it away from you.

Also, how hard was the Sec+ test -- any tips/tricks?  I'm taking mine next month.

And do you have any tips to get an entry level job in the info-sec industry? I've been applying to many jobs and haven't been having any luck. Thanks."

college,fe00hla,t3_engcam,1578800126.0,"I hate online additions to textbooks with a passion. They cost way too much, most of the time they are terrible at recognizing answers (if you have to do homework with them -- Chemistry homework sucked ass), and you have to buy it with the book - you can't get the book without it.

What a pain in the ass."
