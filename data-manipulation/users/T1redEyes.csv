I’ve worked in bad conditions and in countries where you don’t get a lot of supplies... seeing this shit *here* makes my blood boil.  It’s important not to accept working in conditions that are unsafe, just because someone who would never take the risk themselves wants to make more money or is fucking stupid."

medizzy,fdzjau9,t1_fdy8dua,1578790757.0,"Hey... it’s interesting to hear how things have changed - or rather it sounds like they haven’t changed that much at all - haha!  
Trained in EM, heavy on trauma.  We had surgical residents, but we were, for the most part, friends, and EM attendings were running the show for trauma at almost all places I rotated at.  
I was also trained on live animals for the very invasive things, and that was excellent training.  
(Animals were under general anesthesia and we were very respectful with them.) Nowadays simulators are becoming more and more realistic - and for these procedures I feel both of these options beat cadavers other than for pure anatomical purposes.  But others may disagree. 
It could also be that I’ve seen too much death  and I prefer the living... lol.  I’ve had forensics training as well.   I spent time overseas in areas with armed conflict.  Lots and lots of trauma.  

Regarding REBOA - did I read that right - attendings yelling at each other regarding thoracotomy vs. REBOA?  What, really? 
Man... I’d say choose REBOA every time!  It’s for sure easier than floating a Swan-Ganz catheter.  People are so resistant to change.  I still struggle with remembering how many patients we lost because we couldn’t use tourniquets.

Exposure and training procedures - my advice is to do as much as you can, however you can. 
Get that exposure, including REBOA before you graduate. If you can get your program to sponsor you for any conferences, take advantage of that.  Especially those that have practical training (as opposed to lectures only).  And something else - I spent a lot of time with anesthesiologists in the OR on my “time off”.  The airway is *yours* when you are done.  Nothing makes people more nervous once they are flying solo.  Nobody better to learn from than the guys you’d call for back up at your hospital.  The traumatized airway is not the one to learn on.  Again, all that is purely my personal opinion.   I wish you all the best on this journey, stay strong... stay safe...check on your colleagues as you go through training and beyond.  

And... thank you for your comment on my other comment... it means more to me than you could know...  
I got a reddit bug and my votes don’t work right, but I’m sending upvotes, and best of luck."
medizzy,fdy1zjg,t1_fdu2wzg,1578775192.0,"Yes, the title is wrong.  I was also wondering what the circumstances were, and it seems like someone found he was shot by the police in Brazil several years ago.  Resuscitative effort zero from what we can see here. 
Since you mentioned REBOA, I was curious to ask you whether that’s part of your guys’ EM curriculum now?  It wasn’t when I trained.  
We were trained in thoracotomies and cross clamping the aorta, etc.  It doesn’t seem to be widely used in the civilian setting currently.  
I’m hoping to learn REBOAs this year.   A lot has changed in trauma management."

medizzy,fdtxek9,t1_fdswf5g,1578723773.0,"I’ve been in a situation where a patient who was dead, moved, and made another person jump - somewhat nervous laughter ensued all around, and some jokes.   This was well after calling it (time of death) and working on that patient for a while and giving everything.  
Nobody I ever worked with didn’t give it their all.  

I’ve had medics scream at me (just because there was so much emotion) when I had to decide whom to keep working on, showing them that the brain of their patient was already coming out, and we had several more casualties that needed help.  That’s how dedicated they were.   

We didn’t laugh at all that day, but I’m sure all of us did or said something that wouldn’t sit well with many people on other days.

I’ve held the hands of patients who were still conscious, and I’ve told them they are in good hands when they were slipping away, fighting with my team to bring them back.  
I can’t think right now of anyone who has never done the same... it is common.  We feel.  
But we usually grieve alone, or sometimes with very few others.   

I’ve had several colleagues who have killed themselves.  Sometimes it is too much.

With that said, I don’t know the story or context here.  They seem to be certain he is dead...
An injury like this could well be survivable - definitely would resuscitate when he initially presented.   And I would not allow filming.

Eta for clarity: 
When I watched this the first time it seemed to me that they had perhaps found no pulse on assessment prior to filming and decided he was dead and not to resuscitate.  The agonal (reflex) breath startled them, leading to the laughter.   

Since then someone found the story (buried in the thread) that this was man was shot by police in Brazil several years ago... I still couldn’t say what exactly their situation was there... but the facial injury alone is survivable no matter how bad it looks - I’ve actually seen worse and the patient survived - resuscitation would definitely be initiated (US).  If anyone ever comes across this, and the person is conscious - do not make them lie down, let them sit up and lean forward.
Often patients are able to breathe on their own in that position. You want to have several airway options (and ideally, people trained well in them) available before you attempt anything. 
Well, I just wanted to add this fwiw."
