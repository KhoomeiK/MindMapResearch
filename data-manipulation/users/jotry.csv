FFRecordKeeper,ffqqlcx,t1_ffqevot,1580141346.0,It’ll be a bit before I can get to a clear for the Type-0 torment. Haven’t felt too well.
aww,ffpezvi,t3_eu9jdd,1580093399.0,I see this pic and first thing I think: Botan (from Clannad) is real!
FFRecordKeeper,ffokjqv,t1_fflcyq0,1580078595.0,Checked and I happen to have both. Got a stacked Rem and Queen as well so I’ll have to try it soon. Really need to try Odin soon to get some of those sweet accessories too.

TrueOffMyChest,ff98upd,t3_ego7n0,1579707517.0,"I know this is a bit old, but I had to post something. I can’t say I understand everything you’re doing through. I’m a 6’2” guy. What you feel and have expressed are valid. I actually have a classmate that would approximately be your size. I’ve seen posts from her where she gets people that joke about it and it seems to be good natured. For some it is a way to relieve tension of acknowledgement of the situation. That’s not to excuse anyone for treating you like you are a kid and can’t do your job competently. 

Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and put people in their place. I don’t believe they’d try that with her. I never knew it but she likes guns. They probably know she’d cap them if they got out of line. Lol I’m not saying to do that, but it’s all in your attitude. Some people unfortunately aren’t always thinking with their head and say things they shouldn’t. 

Some things should be left unsaid. If someone is worrying about the height of future children so early in,  frankly that would be a sign to me to walk away. For me personally, it would be a walking sign. I’m not saying it is wrong, but for my values I’m far more interested in healthy children. The questions they ask on your height just denotes their own insecurity. 

I can say as a man I don’t worship tall women or models for that matter. The women I’ve dated in my life are far better than any fascination with a model I’ll never date. If anything a shorter woman would be more appealing to me, but my crushes have ran the gamut of heights. The personalities of the women I’ve dated short term and long term were better than anything and what stands out the most. Each had their own physical beauty as well. I know it would probably mean more coming from a short guy as I understand that is what you like, and that’s fine. The heart wants what the heart wants. 

I just wanted to let you know you deserve to find someone that loves you for who you are, and that you will in time. You sound like a great individual. Most of all I wanted to write this due to your comment about suicide. Please don’t ever consider it. Please. You don’t know the hole it leaves in the hearts of those left behind. There is always the hope of better days."
GetMotivated,ff2rcgi,t3_eqz4w1,1579520655.0,"I agree with this really for the most part. The only exception I would say is if you can’t respond with kindness, just don’t respond. That in itself is kindness. More to you, but when you’ve dealt with someone’s toxicity for so long with so many chances given to improve that just don’t come, you don’t need to accommodate them. It’s their own sickness they won’t cure and there comes a point you need to distance yourself from them so you don’t get the same illness."

aww,felkavd,t3_epn9lr,1579224221.0,"I have an irrational fear of bats. I understand that. I wish them no harm, I appreciate what they do, but all reason goes out the window when they’re flying and they are within a ten foot radius of me, and this is just the little ones."
aww,fel2rei,t3_epn9lr,1579212804.0,No. Just no. Good lord no.
AskReddit,fej2yx5,t3_epdqvi,1579154950.0,"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. If you aren’t bawling by the time the little girl finishes reading the last letter she gets from her mother who passed away giving birth to her, I have to wonder where your heart is. Oh and this is only 40% of the movie I estimate at that point. Hope you are well stocked on tissues."

todayilearned,fdi5xgk,t3_elfc3c,1578436302.0,Gordon Ramsey should work on not being a dick himself before worrying about his children.

AskReddit,fc73yqn,t1_fc6ngc9,1577496906.0,I can testify it is. Now imagine throwing them up out your nose as well.
