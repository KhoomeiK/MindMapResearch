legaladvice,ffjuouh,t3_eu0k24,1580007452.0,I have been laying low and have not said a word to him about the will. On the surface we are on good terms. We will get a lawyer right away. Ty
legaladvice,ffjuiku,t1_ffjrjsi,1580007311.0,"We do have an estate attorney, she drew up the will. My brother is executor. Mom mom changed executor when she filed for divorce. And thank you"
legaladvice,ffju1gx,t1_ffjrrla,1580006932.0,"I have seen a copy of the will and a copy has been mailed to me.

He’s a bastard. My mother had filed for divorce 2 days before she was diagnosed with a stage IV glioblastoma and didn’t continue, couldn’t continue, with the divorce. 

My older brother is the executor of her will. He lives in CA so is trying to deal with finding a litigator. I’m helping as much as I legally can. 

Yes her will was completed with her attorney and everything is in order with the paperwork.

She willed all her belongings, paid for by with her trust money, to her 3 children, and its most of everything in the house. And we are to receive half the earnings from the sale of their house if he moves. He’s moving to his home state ASAP he said. So he has a lawyer and is going to fight it."
family,ffhuyax,t3_esksls,1579955112.0,"My mother died last week, today is her memorial. I miss her more everyday. My best friend, who lost her mother 3 years ago, said to me that time doesn’t change the pain, you adjust yourself and you’re life to deal with it. She also said that time does 
have  a numbing effect but when you feel the pain, it’s still as intense as it was when she first passed. I don’t know if that helps you in anyway. Maybe we shouldn’t fight it, or try to go around it. We have to go through it, cry, scream, hate the word every now and then. Please try not to isolate; going out or talking to friends and family may not be appealing right now but honestly the distraction helps a lot. I’m so sorry for your loss and I wish you the best on your journey  to find some peace of mind."
SweatyPalms,ffe4su1,t3_et0j4d,1579836703.0,That’s scary and sad. She probably has dementia or a mental illness.
CancerFamilySupport,ff7vuvb,t3_epcnz9,1579659581.0,"Lost my mom a week ago today from a glioblastoma, 3 1/2 months after being diagnosed. I woke up with a terrible sore throat and I went to call her to whine like I always do but ended up having a panic attack because I’m never going to talk to her again. I’m sorry for everyone’s suffering. Fuck cancer"
CancerFamilySupport,ff7vf1p,t3_epoigp,1579659282.0,My mom died a week ago today and I still go to call her almost everyday. It’s such a empty feeling. Take care of yourself.
CancerFamilySupport,ff7v33k,t1_fez052z,1579659059.0,So sorry about your mom. Mine died a week ago today. I still go to call her almost everyday before it hits me in the gut every morning that she’s gone. Take care of yourself.

I have a hole in my heart and I don’t know if it will ever heal but being with friends and family helps a little. I hope you find an answer to your question. If you do, please share it with the rest of us. Take care"

CancerFamilySupport,fej7pev,t3_enkh6x,1579160409.0,"My mom died 2 days ago from brain cancer. Our situation was similar to yours, my mom couldn’t walk or feed herself or talk very well. We put her in hospice for her own safety, and I must admit, it was sad but also a huge relief because I knew she would be safe. It’s too hard to do it on your own. I wish you well."
CancerFamilySupport,fej7enu,t3_epcnz9,1579160031.0,My mom just died 2 days ago from brain cancer. She stopped talking a few months back and I will still go to call her when something happens. It’s a shock every time when I remember I’ll never talk with her again. I’m so sorry about your dad. I hope time will help numb the pain a little bit. Take care of yourself.

AmItheAsshole,fe2iiub,t1_fe2ae4b,1578838718.0,"My mom has been in a nursing home for 4 days, we took care of her at home until she could no longer walk with help, so I’m sure you know the system much better. It doesn’t matter though at this point because she probably will pass this weekend. I’m sorry about your mom."
AmItheAsshole,fe0d7yz,t3_en894e,1578810543.0,"Got it, ty"
AmItheAsshole,fdz1gvk,t1_fdxnng8,1578785743.0,No I’ll help her if she needs it. I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t. I was very angry at first but it’s fading.
AmItheAsshole,fdxwp20,t1_fdxob32,1578773698.0,"I hope you never have to watch anyone die and yes I take it personally when my mom is in pain and another person won’t push a button. If her roommate ended up on the floor because she fell out of her wheelchair, should I leave her lying there and not get involved? No one asked her to monitor my mom, if she happened to hear moaning, push the damn button. And I do know why she refused, and I have talked to the staff often."
AmItheAsshole,fdwrtjm,t1_fdwoaot,1578761750.0,"Thank you, I’ll check on the medicaid, I’m checking out everything"
AmItheAsshole,fdwrgut,t1_fdwpm9m,1578761630.0,"It’s possible that she felt more was involved. When I volunteered in a nursing home in high school, roommates would general watch out for one another and help if they were at all able to. It’s not in my nature to look away when someone needs help, and I don’t understand people who do. That’s my problem, I know. Some people have no empathy and I find that a little scary tbh."
AmItheAsshole,fdwot4y,t1_fdwlx4g,1578760929.0,"She was not asked to listen for my mom moaning; my daughter asked if she heard her please press the button. I did say, when replying to another message, that I would help her. To me, it’s comparable to walking by a person on the side walk who needs help."
AmItheAsshole,fdwjiu6,t1_fdwdz2e,1578759368.0,Thank you for your sympathy and great advice.
AmItheAsshole,fdwj5lb,t1_fdwg70l,1578759213.0,"No it takes one second to push the button. I volunteered in a nursing home for 3 years in high school, so yes I have been in a nursing home. You have obviously never had to watch your mother wither in excruciating  pain and have to wait 10 minutes for a nurse after the button gets pushed. And if that button doesn’t get pushed, she could be in that pain for hours. You think it’s too much to ask another human being watching and listening to that to push a button? I feel so sorry for your future nursing home roommate. YTA"
AmItheAsshole,fdwdt8s,t1_fdwacfs,1578757664.0,I wish I had said that to her but I was in shock that she would refuse to do so little to help someone.
AmItheAsshole,fdwdc30,t3_en894e,1578757585.0,"She would, thank you for reminding me of that. I get petty when I feel my mom is in pain and doesn’t get help while someone else sits and watches and listens and does nothing. That kind of person is just cruel."
AmItheAsshole,fdwcni9,t1_fdw6otv,1578757374.0,"We have had the worst time getting her into hospice, and for some reason they couldn’t admit her under hospice, she’s in under rehab. Her social worker had to fight just to get her that. I don’t understand why she is being refused. My brother has power of attorney and he lives across the country and has been trying to coordinate her care from there. She has Medicare part A with United Health Care and AARP.  It is beyond frustrating but I will continue to fight to make sure she gets the best care."
AmItheAsshole,fdw6n1h,t1_fdw5g12,1578755597.0,I know I feel kind of shitty. I think that’s why I asked you if I’m the asshole because I feel a little bit like one. It goes against my belief that we should be helping others when we can.
AmItheAsshole,fdw5pkp,t1_fdw2nds,1578755353.0,"Thank you so much, I’m going to look into moving her."
AmItheAsshole,fdw5id1,t3_en894e,1578755312.0,I’ll add a little note that just says “do onto others...”
AmItheAsshole,fdw4xgx,t1_fdw34w0,1578755109.0,Thank you so much and I will look into that.
AmItheAsshole,fdw4sfh,t1_fdw3igz,1578755055.0,I believe she would do just that. Thank you
AmItheAsshole,fdw4n2y,t1_fdw48t9,1578755000.0,"They do not have private rooms and Medicare will only pay for 20 days of hospice, then it’s $11,000 a month out of pocket."
AmItheAsshole,fdw4dh6,t1_fdw37w9,1578754894.0,Thank you for the advice. I will look into getting her into a private room.
