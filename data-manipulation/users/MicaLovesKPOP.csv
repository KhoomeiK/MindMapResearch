cars,fgib2aq,t1_fgiaenf,1580814886.0,"I think some are. I know in Scandinavia cars are very expensive, which I assume would come from similar taxes.

On the other hand, in Germany a 370Z can be had for just over 38k USD.

If I really wanted a 370Z, and there were none available here or they cost too much, I'd be best off importing the oldest one I can find in great condition, from elsewhere in the EU.

Import costs are based on the car's list price and its age. The older the car, the more discount you get. I believe once you get to 25 years old or so you're basically at the (very low) minimum.

Cars imported from outside the EU have a bit of extra cost, and of course shipping and such will cost more, but it's still quite affordable. Hence importing from Japan is popular and generally cost-effective as cars are cheap there. The only issue is cars are RHD there, I personally only want LHD. 

I'm actually not entirely sure if they would use the Dutch list price if said car model was also sold here, but I assume they would."

kpophelp,fghwsof,t3_eyizuv,1580796299.0,"Generally speaking, K-Pop is just music from Korea. It's sometimes further specified, especially for things like rock, hip-hop or trot, but you'll find people calling any music from Korea K-Pop.

There's kpop songs in English and those aren't English Pop either, are they? :)

Edit: comments made me realize what you're asking exactly. I would categorize based on if it matters to you. If you don't mind Japanese songs or versions of songs mixed in with other  K-Pop you may not want to bother categorizing it differently?
