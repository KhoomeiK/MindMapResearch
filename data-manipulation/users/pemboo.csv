As a DM you fudge rolls, not all the time but you fudge rolls, and you fudge PC's rolls for them.


You are all there to make a story, the PCs are agents in a story, and yes there should be consequences for their actions but you can't sit there as a DM and roll a natty 20 every roll and just kill everyone.


You change rolls on the fly, you change rules, you change monster's stats, the experience is bigger than the game rules.
