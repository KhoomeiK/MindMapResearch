TeardropTrailers,ff35obg,t1_ff2u243,1579534276.0,What’s your cupboard like now and what would you want it to be?  I was considering doing mostly drawers.
TinyHouses,ff202dm,t3_er3ioz,1579490230.0,Yeah that flat part will leak and be a pain for sure.  Just make a patio or free standing deck.
TeardropTrailers,ff1zk67,t1_ff1v8q5,1579489864.0,What would you get / do with that extra 2 feet?

AskMenOver30,fclx0mx,t3_ehut15,1577758535.0,"In general I find for it to be an adventure it can’t be planned.  With the exception of deeper wilderness excursions or overnight trips in the woods ( in that case I email my parents details and when to call for help if I don’t let them know I’m back).  To this end, I keep a plastic bin in my trunk with gear in it. 

In my car a small pack with basic survival and first aid kit in it.  Large first aid and trauma kit. Two quarts of water and some snacks.  A bathing suit, towel, sandals and an extra pair of sneakers.  Toiletries and change of clothes.  Small solar charger for my phone.  Car fix kit.  

Training wise I’ve done cpr, first aid, stop the bleed and basic wilderness first aid and then advanced hemorrhage control training.   Also done several orienteering classes and keep a compass in my kit.  Other outdoor skills and survival skills from boy scouts and outdoor experience.  

Pretty much just choose a direction in my car and get lost.  Hit anything interesting I see along the way.  

For international travel I usually book three nights in a hotel and then find a apartment from there if I’m staying for 30+ days. Then I just explore, the last few weeks I’m there then I’ll see if I missed anything.  Way more fun discovering things by chance than having a punch list."

75HARD,fcfojb8,t3_eh5viy,1577632282.0,I’m doing keto.  It’s actually the easiest part of the challenge for me since I’ve been doing it almost 2 years with no cheats.
getdisciplined,fc7nuzy,t1_fc7n1kq,1577513763.0,I don’t take any meds.  Never have.  Don’t drink smoke or do drugs either.

getdisciplined,fc75xt0,t1_fc6puk7,1577498417.0,"Nothing that I can decern.  Me feeling better and generally happier was a result of success at first then in compounded it after that.  But that change wasn’t until I was 2-4 months in.  So idk what was going on in the very beginning.  

In general I didn’t have any major hang ups, depression etc.  I just wasn’t happy with things.  But that state wasn’t the trigger either."
getdisciplined,fc75gfk,t1_fc6yl25,1577498041.0,I’m 35.  So I can’t claim this lol
smallbusiness,fc3a76j,t3_efy1r6,1577385208.0,"Hard work + business skills + resources + luck.  


Hard work in the right direction.  You can work hard and not be productive.  This can be hard for even seasoned folks

Business sense is something the more you do the more you get better at.  You begin to intuitively know what to do and what the next step is.   This let’s you be successful in later ventures but can’t always be taught, you just learned through doing it.  

One thing I see is new people often get excited about something a guru tells they is “critical” and they go whole hog in for about 80% but never finish before they’re onto the next shiny thing.  Completing a product and getting it to market is crucial.  Most spin their wheels half way.  

Resources.  If you are successful you have more resources.  An example is I started my first business and built up a small team over years.  When I launched my second business and I needed a logo, a website, some seed money, a email client, and server space.  I already had it in place.  When I first started I had to go find all those things.  

When I called my various contractors they gave me a better rate than anyone could at a quality that few could compete because my first business was their largest client.  So I got top quality work for a low price with a single phone call.  

My website was a adaptation for the first website so it cost me a few hundred bucks not a few thousand. On a server my first company was paying for.  Things like this compound.  

Relationships are a huge factor here.  Who you know and what they can help you with.  

Sales acumen. I’m not a good sales guy, but after learning how important it is I got a business partner in my second business who could sell all day long. I knew that’s what I needed because ive learned along the way it’s what I needed. 

Scalability.  I struggle with this still. I tend to get drawn to business models that don’t scale super well.  Six figures sure, 7 or 8 figures is a stretch.  It’s a major weakness of mine so I’m working on this but it’s the difference between the two scenarios you laid out

Finally luck.  If you’ve done all the above you set yourself to capitalize on luck that comes your way.  If you don’t have your shit together you’ll miss out big."
