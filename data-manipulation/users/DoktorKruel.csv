“Human right” is the phrase lefties use to make it sound okay for the government to give people free goods and services. There’s no list of “human rights,” because a “human right” depends on what the politician promises to give people. 

The right to seek employment is a civil/natural right; the right to “a job” is said to be a “human right,” along with internet access, transportation, plenty of food, and a house.

If everyone only bitches and moans when the other side does it, nothing will change."
Libertarian,ff9kxa5,t1_ff9gamn,1579715173.0,"I have a couple of thoughts on that. 

* It’s already a crime for crazy people and felons and wife-abusers to buy a gun. If you don’t think they’ll follow the law that says they can’t have a gun, why do you think they would follow a law that says they have to get a background check?

* Background checks are required, even at gun shows, if either party is a licensed dealer—which is almost everyone at a gun show except a few guys selling from a private collection. That’s usually a couple of dozen guys walking around with a gun that has a sticker on it saying it’s for sale. Almost all of the guys with booths or tables are licensed dealers and have to conduct background checks. 

* If anyone is selling guns “for profit” or as part of a regular trade, they’re required to have a license. So if there is someone at the gun show buying glocks and selling them to bangers without conducting a background check (1) ATF will get a report that he buys X-number of guns per week, and they’ll investigate, and (2) he’ll be prosecuted for selling guns without a license, which is another federal crime, and (3) gun shows usually have a significant police presence and ATF agents are there in plainclothes looking for that sort of thing. Thus means that legitimately, someone might be able to sell a gun without a license only occasionally, and someone who’s prohibited might be able to buy a gun without a background check only occasionally. 

* Shooting up a school and robbing a bank are already first-degree felonies (and the former comes with the death penalty). Why do you think someone committed to their plan under those circumstances will be deterred from it by just one more (less-serious) criminal offense? That would be a completely irrational proposition. 

The real question is whether the state is justified in imposing a huge burden to the collective liberty because of a very remote possibility that it could stop a handful of violent acts. I think the answer is “no.” People who give up liberty for safety deserve and get neither. If I’m going to give up my liberty, I want something huge in return. Keeping a few dozen people from getting their guns *this way*, since they’ll just go buy them anyway using a straw purchase or they’ll steal one, isn’t a valid reason to limit my freedoms."

It was clearly a waste of their resource, and it would have been even more of a waste if the guy told them to choke on a dick and sent them on their way.

I think it’s time for journalists to set up their own accrediting body. If you have certain basic training and do continuing education on things like journalistic ethics and bias awareness, you get a credential. And if you write a story that is baseless, or has made-up facts, or flows too far into persuasive writing rather than reporting, you get your credentials suspended. Only credentialed journalists get premium access. Everyone else can still write whatever they fuck they want, though, they just don’t get the access. And when the public reads a story by a credentialed journalist, they know they don’t have to be as suspect as they do if it’s written by an un-credentialed journalist.
