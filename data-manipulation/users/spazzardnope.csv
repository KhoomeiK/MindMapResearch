If I remember correctly, the Pana had data on the second channel also though, as you could overlay text as well as just marking timings, etc... This is clearly far more than that (or at least had the potential to be), and looks extremely interesting. Fantastic work by the way, I forgot to say that beforehand."

Assholes are just that, Assholes, but any dick who hurts an animal on purpose is a major asshole, and I'd keep your dogs in too for the time being if that is possible, and warn your kids too, a paintball to the face is not fun... If it's asshole kids, call the Police and put the fear into them, if it's adults, same, call the police."

Still looking forward to 2020, even though I have a lot of shit going on. I can't help apart from reply to you, and again give you my own experience... Man up? Grow up? Heard that so many times.... Means nothing.

Please try and look after yourself, and guess what, you will be surprised at how many people don't actually think you are whatever you think you are. 2020 one little step. join a book club, join a card club, you don't need to be alone... If you think I'm taking the piss, then try one first... It helped me, and still does. Some of my best friends are people I wouldn't even have talked to before I got out of my own funk."

SuicideWatch,fc585eu,t3_efyam6,1577448103.0,"30? Like another poster said, it doesn't matter. When I hit 30, I had in the year leading up to it lost my house, my partner, my business and my family, because I wasn't able to deal with my depression, and turned into an alcoholic.

I'm 41 next week, and in the past 10 years, I got married, divorced, relapsed into alcoholism, lost my job because I passed out drunk in front of my computer, evicted, slept on the streets for a few months, and my cat was murdered. (not all at once, that would have been a wild ride).

But, I'm looking forward to 2020, if only because I am in a better place than I could have imagined 10, hell even 3 years ago."

SuicideWatch,fbxm9ri,t3_eeyc3w,1577193684.0,"There is nothing wrong with not being with family over the holidays, (abusive father), but you also don't have to be alone. I have been working with homeless charities for the last 5 years, and admittedly the first year I did it, I was very reserved, and treated it like ""Look how good I am being, look how much I'm working and giving up, all ""you people"" should be grateful"", because I was very lost myself.

After I got to know people, it became more of something I look forward to. Tomorrow I'm really looking forward to it, and have even got a festive jumper, which if you knew me 10 years ago would have been ludicrous. Even got a present off one of the friends I now look after through the year thanking me for my support, and it was a beautifully framed photo of me my first christmas there carrying in 5 crates at once with the face of death looking like I hated every second... (had no idea that photo even existed).

All i'm saying is things change. That and your cat surely loves you in it's own weird cat way. Your dog is a blessing in disguise, I don't know where you live, but I live in a total shithole too, and never talked to anybody because I was naive and scared of talking to people, and the people I did ""socialise"" with were really bad for me.

I'm not ""ugly"" either (whatever that means), but my outlook was, and I didn't get there on my own. I'm still shy and can come across as a total d\*ck, but things change."
