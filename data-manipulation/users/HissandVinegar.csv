It’s been awhile since I’ve been trained on this and I don’t have my notes handy, but it takes something like 4-6 lbs. of pressure to cut off venal circulation and 11-13 to impede arterial circulation.  How relatively easy is it is to cause serious damage is why there are only visible/photographable marks on ~15% of strangulation victims in abusive relationships. Ofc a happy, healthy kink-incorporating relationship is different, but is really important to be educated on both short term danger and longer term health risks.

Tinder,fgz7wi3,t1_fgz4tg6,1581191681.0,"Well, some food for thought in terms of women carrying weapons for personal safety. 

1.  Carrying a weapon isn’t as much of an equalizer as it’s made out to be and when there is a disparity in physical strength, it can escalate the situation. Often, by the time someone is close enough for you for you to be sure they’re a threat, they’re close enough to take your weapon off you and use it against you.

In intimate partner and family violence, it becomes even more dangerous because of the social and power dynamics at play.

2. The statutes in your state and the individual law enforcement officers and court officials handling your case in are going to factor heavily into how protected by the law you are in regardless to self-defense.

3. Unfortunately, stand-your-ground laws aren’t necessarily an effective protection for women. There’s a lot of gender (and racial) bias in how those cases play out in actuality."

Tinder,fgz0tnw,t1_fgyvkhq,1581189435.0,"1. It’s not really the same thing though. Locking your door is a reasonable safety precaution on an inanimate object and doing it has very little impact on your life. A woman never being able to do anything alone is a massive imposition on an autonomous being.

2. It was a possible implication even based on the one direct quote I gave though! Like, I can tell you he was not concerned about men hiking alone or women being rapists. (Tangent: There are studies suggesting that as many as 1 in 6 men are sexually assaulted. It’s honestly not a small risk for men either, and to use the super Reddit-famous example of Terry Crews, it’s not just about physically overpowering another person. A lot of predators use social conventions and power dynamics to get away with shit.).

3. I know you didn’t have that piece of information about him going into this conversation and I am a stranger on the internet, but regarding “benefit of the doubt” towards the stranger instead of the person you’re talking to it’s a really common response on Reddit and in real life that can feel really invalidating. So if a friend or family member ever does disclose to you or is trying to process something with you, asking questions can be a better strategy than devil’s advocate. Obviously there’s a huge gray area when it comes to human interactions but~

Tinder,fgyx5fp,t1_fgywhhs,1581188289.0,Most people I’ve met in the woods *are* super cool . I’ve even made summit friends I’ve hiked back with while going it solo!
Tinder,fgywycw,t1_fgyuol7,1581188214.0,"It’s not a stupid argument. It’s a real consideration in assessment of the risks. Sexual assault “dark alley style” just isn’t nearly as common as people think it is and it doesn’t even make my top 5 fears while solo hiking. Could it happen? Absolutely. But it could also happen with my third date from Tinder or when I’m out at the bar with my friends or when I’m walking home from work late at night. With hiking, it’s just so much more likely I’ll run into bad weather or get lost or break an ankle and not have a buddy to hike back in good cell service to call S&R.

I don’t consider it disrespectful to my hiking community to think about the risks (and I do). I work in sexual and domestic violence advocacy. I *know* how common it is overall in my community. But. Making “fear of sexual assault” a primary consideration in every decision is not something that makes sense for me."

Tinder,fgyuad6,t1_fgyqv92,1581187094.0,"1. No. “Good way to get raped” implies it’s something the person being raped did to themselves. People do not rape themselves. Rapists rape people.

2. He did though so.

3. I didn’t go straight to it. I made that assessment based on his words and actions.

4. It’s funny that you’re calling me a misandrist while giving every bit of benefit of the doubt to some dude you don’t know about a conversation you were not there for.

5. You keep calling it “concern” for my safety. It was not: If anything he made me feel unsafe.

First because of his comment and then because on the car ride home he put my hand on his penis multiple times. LPT: If a woman removes her hand from your genitalia multiple times, she does not want you to grab it and put it back. 

I can tell you that I have never had my hand repeatedly put on a penis I didn’t want to touch while hiking alone."
Tinder,fgyra7r,t1_fgynx9f,1581186179.0,"It’s not about any given stranger than any given familiar? It’s just that, statistically, it is much more likely someone you know will assault you (and maybe not even in a way that they’d consider assault) than the “stranger in a dark alley” trope that many people often think of. It’s also like, a pretty high barrier to hike 10 miles out into the woods with all the proper gear to go prey on a stranger.

See, I wouldn’t have been offended if he’d been legitimately curious about safety concerns and wanted to have a real conversation about it. I don’t need someone to unquestioningly accept my opinions, but I do need someone who is a potential partner to listen to my reasoning and have a basic level of respect for me."
Tinder,fgyor4r,t1_fgykutk,1581185367.0,"“A good way to get raped” is *not* how people with genuine safety concerns for an acquaintance discuss risk of sexual assault.

Tinder,fgynami,t1_fgyk3am,1581184996.0,"He *is* wrong though. If sexual assault is your concern, it’s more dangerous to go on a date from Tinder or to go out to a bar with your friends. Solo hiking does carry risks, but frankly, I’m far more afraid of becoming injured or falling ill, getting lost, or running into extreme weather conditions while alone.

I don’t expect every woman who hikes to have the same threshold I do, but I’m not interested in giving up a huge part of my life due to fear of an unlikely hypothetical. Nor do I think it’s very productive to view every person with a penis I meet like a potential rapist.

1. Most sexual assault is perpetrated by someone who knows the victim (Partner, family member friend, date, acquaintance, etc.)

2. The hiking community in my state is very friendly and I feel significantly safer around strange men on the trails than I do strange men on the sidewalk.

3. It’s a stupid fucking thing to say to a date he was alone in the woods with and wanted to see again. It showed me he was ignorant, dismissive about sexual assault, and untrusting of my (an adult woman with significantly more outdoors experience than he had) assessment of my safety."

But I’m super afraid to share because he honestly has like... No understanding...  ....The existence & dynamic of disordered eating/exercise habits was new information to him? And like, the dynamics of family violence (my personal history and professional work) seem very foreign to him. It’s silly. Because he does notice (I froze during a sudden movement when he was sautéing vegetables and he immediately stopped to check) and seems like a really kind, open, nurturing person, but INSECURE ATTACHMENT. 

...I usually connect better with men who have personal experience with trauma because I don’t feel too damaged for them. Which is extra dumb because I don’t think trauma makes other people damaged goods. And I’m so scared in this case because he has a daughter and I have a lot of deeply rooted terror about becoming my mother and what if he hears this and is like this woman is clearly too unhinged to be around my child.

Ugh. I've been doing this so badly. On the third date dude was like ""So you keep alluding to past trauma do you wanna talk about it."" and I was like ""NO WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME TODAY OR THIS WEEK TO GO OVER IT but also I think it's inappropriately early to unload I'm just afraid I'm being dishonest if you don't know it exists early so you can bail, get it?"" and he was all ""No I really don't [because I'm well-adjusted (my addition)] but thank you for trying to explain it to me.""

New boy and a couple friends have dragged me for bodyweight stuff upon occasion and I have the membership for the treadmill, but I *really* don’t like gyms and have very little interest in lifting-lifting.

Sigh. It's normal early stage anxiety for those of us who have been burned a million times I think. We boned for the first time on Saturday and he was quiet on Sunday so I have been feeling VULNERABLE WITH A CAPITAL EVERYTHING. Then Monday he reached out to plan a mid-week thing and was like ""Totally not excited to see you~"" so everything's back down to normal response levels... For now.

Maybe it's a coincidence, but it's happened with every male friend or date this year SO. I AM SUSPICIOUS. Ex and I have this bantery bit 'bout him teasing me about not identifying as a runner (which is fine and even fun) and this bit where I am legitimately trying to be friendly because I want to join his run group and he won't stop flirting because he has this I-don't-want-this-toy-but-I-want-it-when-someone-else-is-playing-with-it mindset (which is not fine and not very fun). So over the last month or so we've been talking more again and he even behaved himself coming with me to a running club info night.

I reached out last night to ask if he knew of any open positions at his company because my friend's husband (who is currently sole income for his wife who is midway through a 2 year academic program and their two kids) got let go and ex works in a similar field.

It depends on your level of comfort and if you feel you can trust him.

And there are men who will be okay with and/or actively interested in establishing non-sexual intimacy. 

Do you feel that you'll be able to communicate and establish what you're comfortable with?

Personally, as I've gotten older I prefer to establish more of an emotional connection before boning and I let my early-stage dates know that. Honestly, it *should* be a given that anyone you date will be respectful of your boundaries, but IME that's rarer than it should be and it's become something that impresses me."
