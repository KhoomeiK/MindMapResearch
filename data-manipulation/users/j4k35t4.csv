videos,ffh0nmu,t1_ffgu73w,1579919948.0,I think it's unlikely the internet made it up. It's quite specific and MAOIs were sometimes used to treat people like him. The author knew his stuff and I think it's pretty likely he included this specifically on purpose.
China_Flu,ffgv0of,t1_ffgnji0,1579915762.0,Thanks for that livestream. Subbed.

China_Flu,ffev72y,t1_ffepdrd,1579866949.0,I think you're on the money. You don't shut down cities unless you know something bad.
China_Flu,ffeqcax,t1_ffeptt1,1579860220.0,You could at least spell it correctly
China_Flu,ffeptzn,t1_ffep11f,1579859443.0,Also I didn't edit anything. Anyone can see when a comment has been edited. There is a star next to it. Like this comment.
China_Flu,ffepilh,t1_ffepehl,1579858966.0,"Begone, mouthpiece of the state.    
Edit: and this hospital wont do a thing. You caused this in China by letting everyone eat everything under the sun. Again."
China_Flu,ffepeyf,t1_ffeo8fx,1579858812.0,I encourage everyone reading this to read deeper into this thread and consider where the upvotes have come from.
China_Flu,ffep85s,t1_ffep11f,1579858516.0,"For what it's worth, I'm not anti China (so keep the general insults, swearing and being an ass to yourself). I'm on this subreddit to learn about the virus and not for hero worship. On top of that, your post was obviously orchestrated propaganda"
China_Flu,ffeowq7,t3_et7wzu,1579858041.0,This post and the comments reeks of propaganda. Submitted 20 mins ago and most posts are already highly upvoted.
OnePunchMan,ff5qgmn,t1_ff4i8ue,1579606079.0,"There is a chance that Saitama started this whole world in this moment. The Hero Foundation was started when Saitama saved the kid from Crablante, upon which his dad contributed funds. This scene might also have been a 14yo Garou reading about his hero."

todayilearned,feil86e,t1_feidqgo,1579141134.0,Not really. You can combine multiple images for a higher resolution

WinStupidPrizes,fdu1rev,t1_fdtzhfk,1578725975.0,"From other replies, it looks like different cars behave differently (different gearing, etc.). So my blanket statement originally may not be correct for all cars, but that was my experience in mine"
worldnews,fdtywvp,t1_fdtxm9i,1578724533.0,Check out https://www.airliners.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1438597&sid=94082256c51b307f9a77dea6d457fcee - the airliners.net forum has actual pilots and engineers mostly and is my go-to for these types of situations. You can kind of see it as it happened in the first few pages of that thread with mostly knowledgeable people commenting

worldnews,fdtvh4x,t1_fdtqb5y,1578722862.0,The missile flew for longer than was shown in the clips so he probably just saw it. I know my phone has a fast camera mode and he probably had it out anyway
worldnews,fdtvb2m,t1_fdto06c,1578722780.0,"To be fair, it was kind of believable given that everyone knew they were covering up the missile"
WinStupidPrizes,fdtmuay,t1_fdthf17,1578719057.0,"That is not true in a power steering car. The steering is MUCH heavier than a non-power steering car when power is lost. Source: lost power while doing 50mph and was battling just to keep it on the road, fighting the road camber."

Firefighting,fd1px5w,t1_fcyglj5,1578134966.0,"This firefighter is an unpaid volunteer who had just lost his house, and the inactions of the PM he refused to shake hands with (who had just been on holidays and was using this as a photo op) are partly to blame."

But then I have my 14 month old climbing up my legs and my wife laughing at us together and it's better. It was a rough 3 or 4 years in between though.     
Hope you're doing ok. A divorce after that length of time is like getting ripped in half. People that haven't been through it can't comprehend the sense of loss."
