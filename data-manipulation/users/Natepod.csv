tifu,fefm67h,t1_feflois,1579059311.0,Is it okay now?
Blessed_Images,fcp9st5,t1_fcp95bq,1577855451.0,"Eats like one too,she looks tiny but she's 80lbs smallest Shepard I had. Had a tiny Chihuahua once that ran with a pack of 85+lb shepards. Technically my sister in laws but I raised and re named him from Paul to cheech."
EmKay,fcmfohv,t3_ehsjqv,1577773521.0,"I'll be his friend,there use to be a garden snake""non poisonous"" near my hose I called Frank. My mother killed him,I watched him grow 3-4 inches longer. Poor Frank"

petty_revenge,fcmdt8v,t1_fcmcnfn,1577771679.0,Yeah if I was a girl balls would be removed. The other guy didn't know she was with me the same time as he was. So we befriended each other to expose her. That girl even had the nerve to go through MY PHONE! I've never hidden anything

entitledparents,fcm6rxm,t3_ehuw5z,1577765703.0,"This happened to me taking my niece to a splash park. She was 6 I'm an over protective uncle,my niece also shares my hair color eye color and complection. An older boy I was guessing 10-12 kept splashing her and bothering her. I asked please leave her alone,he didn't so I acted like we were leaving but I was looking for the parents. After 10 chairs I find a sleeping woman and man looking at his phone headphones in.... After confirming it was their child and the explanation of events their reply was ""he probably likes her"" to which I replied ""SHE IS 6 YOUR KID IS AT LEAST 10 he shouldn't like her that's weird""  ""No he's 12 and it isn't,look he's having fun"" They pointed to him splashing water on another child. I knew to just make a complaint,leave,and take her to grandma's pool."
petty_revenge,fcm2d9w,t3_ehtzfv,1577762426.0,"To prevent this I make up ridiculous things so nobody ever really knows why I'm going. Any doctor appt is personal,same thing with sex life,personal so I make up ridiculous things so nobody every knows if I'm telling the truth or messing with them."
petty_revenge,fcm00fa,t3_ehkp84,1577760687.0,"Maybe he accidentally made one.... What a jerk if you aren't happy say something. My ex girlfriends ""friend"" was her side man then full time man after we broke up. We broke up because I said I didn't trust her around him. Funny how we called her out in front of her friends about it turning her into more of a hoe."
dogs,fclywc4,t1_fckdomm,1577759874.0,"Same,there's nothing like the love you feel from your pet when they have to touch you while they're sleeping. Or run to you when scared,annoying you with a slimy toy to throw when you're bored. Getting a tongue in the face if you sleep too long"
ProRevenge,fclxs15,t1_fbxgmwr,1577759076.0,Our dog Lexus had one litter of 9 puppies only one because they said it can take 4 years off a females life but she lived until 12. Pure bred AKC German Shepards no history of bad hips w/papers sold 4 for $900 2 for $600 and $400 for one. I wanted to keep the star of this story and we gave my grandma basically his wiry haired twin.
dogs,fcltzi0,t3_eho07v,1577756417.0,"I was very depressed after my last dog passed away. Along with his son who's still alive,I was lazy,felt alone because my only dog left was moaping. But this puppy saved me and my other dog,made me more active,gave me a daily schedule and purpose in life. I have more energy because she's 1 and it's fun teaching her new stuff. Can get on my nerves but it's a good thing for me believe it or not."
