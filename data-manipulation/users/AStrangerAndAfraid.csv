AskReddit,fcyjkaq,t1_fcycdlz,1578081140.0,"You know, I wonder why people think this is abnormal behavior.

I’m no expert on human behavior and I’m just as appalled as many by this behavior, but I don’t see how people are surprised by cruelty. To me it seems as default as altruism. Why are we so convinced that being human is about being good,  docile, house-trained, responsible, reasonable, etc... when there are plenty of examples to the contrary?

IDK, man. The fact that we decided the adjective “humane” describes compassionate behavior seems pretty naive and arrogant to me when we’re just as capable of being as awful as other animals.

Not saying humanity is all evil and whatnot, but it just seems like we’re still clueless animals that are slaves to our instincts and emotions no matter how smart we become."
