AskAGerman,ffqc4k9,t3_eukr6k,1580129932.0,"Austrian here. In my generation, women wore their engagement ring on the right hand, and move it over to the left hand once they were married (because wedding rings are worn on the right). Some wear both rings on the same finger. 

I never heard of the 'ring should cost 1 month salary' rule in  Austria, but it seems common in the UK. I find that rule pretty idiotic and a waste of money"
