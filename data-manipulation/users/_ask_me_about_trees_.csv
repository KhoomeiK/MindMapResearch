Now where did I put that work order?"
AskReddit,ffjio8q,t1_ffivlx3,1579999084.0,I had a gram of pure powder 2cb and did quite a bit of it. I would be surprised if it was the cause of psychosis but drugs affect everyone differently.
mildlyinteresting,ffj9odg,t1_ffj4br7,1579993704.0,My problem was they weren't using it sure it can hang out in a field that long but people getting in and out of ot wet I'm assuming would cause some problems
nextfuckinglevel,ffh76ht,t1_ffh6dlk,1579925025.0,It's all good I'm just glad you understood I was overexcited and not just being a dick. It's hard to communicate on the internet sometimes
nextfuckinglevel,ffgzurd,t1_ffgpkhn,1579919345.0,That poor Durango. Also how you gonna put a link where you're talking about accessories but the link is loading it on a trailer?
AskReddit,ff7e2xa,t3_erstu3,1579647418.0,I have enough anxiety about stupid shit no room to worry about that
wholesomememes,ff4smub,t1_ff4pk4c,1579571474.0,"While it was huge news, comparing it to landing on the moon landing is ""one big step"" 

(Pun intended)

But honestly if I wasn't on reddit at the time it probably wouldn't be such big news in my life.

Like I said how does a celebrity's death affect my life as a normal person other than they won't be in any movies anymore.

But I will admit as much more of a music head, when artists I'm deeply invested in die too soon (i.e. mac miller) it fucks me up. 

Mac's family just released all the stuff he was working on when he died and I won't lie I've been crying more lately.

Edit: a word"
wholesomememes,ff4mnpi,t1_ff4m4fr,1579567313.0,Seconded. Used to think he was the bees knees when I was emo and donnie darko was my favorite movie.
wholesomememes,ff4mk8x,t1_ff4m1bx,1579567244.0,I try to stay out of celebrities personal lives too. Albeit I did know he died but I dont get why people are freaking out because you didnt know. It's not like you knew the guy or his death affected you especially as a kid.

TILI,fehnep5,t1_fehmyt0,1579120072.0,Ah that makes more sense. My favorite Canadian youtuber is always saying stuff like well this was 400 Canadian pesos but you could probably get it in the states for a couple paper clips and some chewing gum. Thanks for the insight.
TILI,fehmjst,t1_fehm80s,1579119577.0,Holy shit. For real? Literally every grocery store around me is about the same price. I think walmart is the 5 for a dollar but I've seen them other places for 17 cents a pack. This is in Texas mind.
TILI,fehlx5g,t1_fegst4b,1579119215.0,"Have you ever bought ramen in a grocery store? It's like 5 for a dollar lol sometimes even cheaper.

Edit: plus now he has all those extra seasoning packets. Nothing better than double seasoning ramen especially when you start adding extra veggies."

NintendoSwitch,fds7uvx,t1_fds71py,1578696335.0,Is there really that much to do?  I beat it a few times but in no way 100% then it got old.  But that's just an opinion and I tire of games easily.
NintendoSwitch,fdrmcx0,t1_fdquswb,1578686538.0,I was thinking the same thing about 90 hours on odyssey. Like wtf
cosplaygirls,fdp90f4,t3_em90i2,1578622822.0,This is awesome. Theres not enough 18 cosplays and you do it well.
DIY,fdp42wl,t1_fdoagau,1578619519.0,It's for holding things. Say you want to cut a bolt with a saw. If you tried to hold it it would be very difficult and you'd probably cut yourself. With this you can put the bolt between the two jaws and tighten them with the handle. You can put a lot of force on the handle and it will hold things very tightly. Inversely if it is something delicate you can put very little force on the handle and it will not damage your piece. They're insanely useful.
DIY,fdp3t4q,t1_fdoka8z,1578619336.0,Finally some sanity in this thread
