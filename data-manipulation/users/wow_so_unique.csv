offmychest,ff4nj5k,t1_ff4nf2e,1579567931.0,"Oh gotcha, sorry I misread. I don’t think they’re attracted to crappy guys . . . they just realize it too far in for the breakup to sound reasonable.

Edit: oh and I meant my ex was a jerk not abusive"

Thank you!"

offmychest,ff3gehr,t1_ff3g98d,1579540500.0,"Ah, I meant on silly things like whether or not a song was good, haha. Obviously you need someone to point out the real problems. : )"
offmychest,ff3fyvj,t1_ff375pz,1579540258.0,Glad things are better now! : )
offmychest,ff3fu6c,t1_ff365wb,1579540184.0,Yikes!! Glad things are better : )
offmychest,ff32tum,t1_ff32nqi,1579532222.0,"Exactly. I never understood “love makes you crazy,” but I do now."
offmychest,ff32laz,t1_ff30s7d,1579532040.0,"That’s something that took a while. Part of it was when I explained to him how certain comments hurt, he didn’t stop. We teased each other, sure, and my family was like that—but specific comments on appearance/things I love got out of hand. 

That, and it was combined with more. He got the number of another girl, invited her to lunch with us, and texted her frequently. He knew it bothered me and didn’t stop. (He’s dating her now, lol.) He would pick fights with me and lecture me for hours, and he didn’t show any pity when I started crying. 

My tip? If it bothers you, it bothers you. People can say, “Grow a thicker skin” all they want, but that doesn’t make it hurt less. Don’t tell yourself it shouldn’t hurt; acknowledge when it does, and if things don’t change, change things."

AskDocs,fegkdl5,t1_fegcbg3,1579095421.0,"I wasn’t told much, but I got the report myself and this is what I remember:
The cells were enlarged, and the notes said it looked like a response to infection (lymph node has been swollen for 4 months by the time it was biopsied).
There was a brown node within the lymph node.

I think my doctor was just reaching for anything she could test, but I honestly don’t know.

Okay! I’ll see if I’ve had what you’ve mentioned and bring it up to my doctor. Thanks!"
AskDocs,fegk3h3,t1_feg7ila,1579095164.0,"Sure! the pain in my shoulders is nearly constant. quality is hard for me to describe, somewhere between achey and sharp. other pains can be random—sudden cramp-like feelings in my back, aches on the lower part of my ribs (both sides), and sudden pain in my hands and wrists. Neck pain is also nearly constant and a similar quality.
My hair isn’t thinning I don’t think, but I do have three patches ranging from dime to quarter size with no hair."
