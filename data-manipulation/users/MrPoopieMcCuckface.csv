AskReddit,ff738vg,t1_ff64cts,1579640238.0,I fall asleep very quickly. One time my step father saw my light turn off from outside and thought he would go upstairs to my room and say goodnight. By the time he got upstairs I was already out like my light. He didn’t talk to me for three days before I asked my mother why he’s acting weird. He thought I was ignoring him for no reason and wouldn’t believe me when I told him I had fallen asleep.

HumansBeingBros,fersgua,t1_feobzxk,1579357857.0,I was at work and eating some Swedish fish. I put 3 in my mouth but one started sliding down my throat and got stuck. I was clawing at my throat while my coworker just gawked at me. I was able to dig into the back of my throat and get it out after a short time but the thing that bugs me about it was the lack of action on my coworkers part. He would have watched me choke to death.
