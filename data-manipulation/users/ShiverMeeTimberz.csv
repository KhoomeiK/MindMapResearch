woodworking,fepc7fz,t3_eqawer,1579316956.0,"I believe it's a derivative of arsenic.  I would hope you weren't inhaling a lot.  Being an ER nurse,  watch for signs or respiratory distress,  hoarseness of the voice,  wheezing,  shortness of breath.   There would be a normal amount of carbon monoxide which takes 24 to unbind from your red blood cells, but it would probably be low or maybe slightly elevated.

  I dont know for certain because I dont know how much you were exposed to and for how long, but if you are not having any complaints I wouldnt worry about it too much. If you are having symptoms, it can never hurt to get checked out, too."

In Georgia we have HERO, Highway Emergency Response Operators or something and they have lights and people in vests who change tires SAFELY.

 I really liked Red Planet.  The graphics were awesome.  I think got about 8 hours of game play, but no real reason to keep playing once I beat it.  

Vader immortal series are amazing but they are in episodes at $10 a piece.  I have the first 3 and they are exciting, but questioning how many episodes (and how much money will this playthrough cost me.)

BEST FREE GAME would be ISS, the International Space Station.  It provides a tour and interactions inside and outside the station.  I highly recommend.

Space Pirates is fun and gets you to sweat.

Job Simulator was popular but I found pretty boring and got refunded."
