TwoXChromosomes,fgvht0w,t1_fgudzbz,1581149186.0,You’re strong in other ways. Physical strength can be shallow. Women are said to make the best snipers in the military because they lack the ego men have when going into training.
TwoXChromosomes,fgvf8my,t1_fgubv3j,1581147797.0,"I have this same issue with movies. I like strong female characters like Jessica Jones, or Wonder Woman, when they give a reason for them being able to kick men’s ass. But movies like Anna, where she is just an average woman beating the shit out of men does not allow me that suspension of reality like other movies."

OutOfTheLoop,ffi3xqn,t1_fffy94b,1579964377.0,"The primary problem with Joe is the way in which he treats his guests. He’s routinely far more critical and dismissive of his left leaning guest than he is his right leaning guests. 

I have seen time and time again where he lets alt-right people say the most absolutely insane shit and he lets it slide. Where on the counter, to be specific, he completely shuts down Adam Conover regarding the age in which sexuality is determined because Adam couldn’t remember the name of the study on the spot. 

He does a good job of letting people voice themselves on his podcast but he is a terrible interviewer in the fact that he often not knowledgeable enough on a subject to stop lies in there tracks. But for one reason or the other he’ll stop someone like Adam who is referencing a scientific study just because joe “feels” its bullshit"
