If briefly, lol. Much less distressed meowing and flailing though. And yes, it may seem the easier answer is to not pick him up, but sometimes it's necessary. Also his brother loves being picked up so sometimes it's just habit and you pick up the wrong brother."

She obviously has some stuff she needs to see a therapist about, but that's a REASON not an EXCUSE for her behavior. The way you called her out was definitely a dick move, but absolutely warranted. Sometimes you just have to accept being the asshole and hope it's for the greater good -- if the waitress overheard, she'll probably feel a little better after the shitty thing your sister said, and maaaayyyybe just maybe getting called out publicly will start the ball rolling with your sister facing the music on her body image problems.

I work overnights at a 24hr grocery store and finally after someone /fatally/ overdosing in our bathrooms, we got locks installed (because upper management pinches pennies every chance they get and ignored both staff and security's repeated requests for bathroom locks for years, despite how many 911 calls we have to make to haul people out of them).

When sharing a sentimental item, it's generally a prerequisite that the person you're sharing it with also shares similar feelings to yourself about the item and the event surrounding it. There's a major disconnect in his feelings about how and why he'd be wearing it versus his mother and sister's. If he really wanted to share their sentimentality, he'd have asked to wear it at the wedding proper.

If he were walking down the aisle in it, giving the garment and by extension his mother and her feelings their due respect, that would be fine.

The fact that he asked for /her/ dress for /that/ purpose makes it seem that he wildly misunderstands the level of sentimentality that goes into that kind of thing, and/or has some undiscussed beef with the mom and is intentionally trying to hurt her in a really weird way instead of dealing with it like an adult. I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he's just really oblivious and a good sit-down conversation between them about how she feels about it and possible alternatives would solve the situation.

Naming children after other people is kinda gross too honestly, having to lug around someone else's name and legacy shouldn't be forced into kids. Sneaking it in as a middle name isn't /as/ bad but still, I'd be much happier if an adult child chose to add a family member's name into their own out of respect.

tifu,fdhr70g,t1_fdhpp6s,1578428575.0,"There are ... So many possible answers. The blanket answer for ours is that our store is in a crappy part of town, so when nicer stores get new shiny terminals, we get the janky old crap they get rid of. 

Ours in particular are also programmed very narrowly, so if the customer isn't doing exactly what it expects them to, it freaks out. And no one reads anything, so that happens a lot. 

Half the stuff inside is broken so cash and coin jams are constant, as are receipt jams (please just take your receipt even if just to throw it away, there's probably a trash close by, but leaving it there can cause issues with the next one coming out, and the next person isn't likely to move it and the attendant won't necessarily have time or notice or they might just be dumb/lazy, but it's a small act that can help to stave off at least one very common SCOT problem). 

The scales are exceptionally finicky sometimes, and things can also have an incorrect weight in the system, causing problems between what's on the bagging scale and what the system expects there to be (especially when people impatiently hit ""I don't want to bag this item"" instead of waiting for the computer to realize it's there, or hitting the button and then setting it on the bagging scale anyways, and then they look at me and wonder why the gosh darn machine is broken). I don't blame people entirely for not waiting on it, as they frequently require Netscape Navigator levels of patience (or it at least feels that way compared the pace of things we're used to now).

I've seen a lot of weird software problems I have no idea what the possible cause could be, and sometimes there's nothing to do but shut it off -- might be worth turning on again but if the problem persists and there's nothing we can do about it, that terminal is just out of order until we can contact a specialist. 

Oh and sometimes they just run out of cash and we don't have time to refill them, although that's usually just cause to switch it into Cards-Only mode, I've seen...less particular employees just close the whole terminal because they didn't want to deal with it. 

I would say overall though that for problems I see when I'm running the self check-outs, it's a pretty consistent 60-40 split of human errors and machine errors."

Unfortunately for them my overnight team is not dumb, and there's not enough of us for them to have been able to pass off that someone not there could have rung them up.

If she'd flip out that badly on a child in front of their primary caretaker over so small a slight, I can only imagine what anger and spite might drive her to do if she had enough time alone with him (and with the added fuel of blaming the kid for getting her kicked out).  

But yeah if this were a wholly different scenario in which she was a sane mature adult who simply wasn't comfortable living with or playing stepparent to a child, and expressed as such leading to more agreeable breakup...

And then mead happened. :( At least, the homemade mead my friend's dad made, I quickly learned the hard way I couldn't have more than two bottles of in 24 hours. Then years later I discovered Bärenjäger and had to learn my lessons all over again."

I could absolutely see this happening with a week to sort out the emotions about it and the numbing of adrenaline when it actually went down."
AmItheAsshole,fd7lebv,t1_fd7h7e8,1578206281.0,"Most of the games I had access to as a kid were significantly tamer than the books I could get my hands on the television I watched. Especially when I was old enough to stay up for SVU. I think the grittiest game I had as a kid was probably just metal gear solid, which if anything just gave me a better appreciation for stealth kills but I was already pretty edgy and violent by then."
AmItheAsshole,fd7kjwr,t1_fd71c8u,1578205935.0,It definitely sounds like something I'd have done around that age if put in a similar situation.
AmItheAsshole,fd7k15e,t1_fd6unxh,1578205713.0,"They're not the literal worst parents but they definitely need to take and /actually listen to/ some child psychology courses. Sounds like they're more likely to scoff at it anyways, if for no other reason than it's easier to deny the advice of professionals in a field than admit you fucked up. They are being abusive, they are damaging their childrens' mental health with these kinds of behaviors, and you gotta stop making excuses for them and sweeping it under the rug. Abuse isn't just an on/off switch of ""nothing"" to ""they tripped down the stairs I guess"" kind of things. Anyways, hopefully the kid's psychologist will be able to point some things out to them and help the kid work through what they've put him through."
