NoStupidQuestions,ffgbssj,t3_etgexu,1579902768.0,"I have what I refer to as a ""kick spot"" on my upper back.  If someone comes anywhere near it, I flinch uncontrollably.  It doesn't hurt (unless I flinch so hard I run into something and lord knows I've done that!) but it is completely out of my control.  It sounds like you may have something similar.  For me, it totally depends on the type of touch - a solid palm placed on my kick spot is fine.  Anything vaguely pointy (think pen, finger, bottle of water, etc) makes me flinch.  Perhaps experiment with your partner (or on your own) to see if there is a type of touch that makes it better/worse...?

The kick spot seems to be inherited - my sister, her son, my dad and I all had/have it to varying degrees.  I think I'm the worst flincher of the bunch."

NoStupidQuestions,ff3p677,t1_ff3kzz1,1579545859.0,"We had a semi-feral cat whom we adored but seemed to only tolerate us. Some 7 years later he had a health crisis which, with lots of vetting, medicine and pilling, seemed to suddenly make him realize how much we cared for him and he became quite affectionate. He would lay down to sleep with us (but as soon as we fell asleep he’d go sleep on the couch), follow us around and then finally ask for pets."

And before all those lovely people warn me of the dangers - the only time she is allowed in the dryer is when I'm there.  She can't get into it on her own (due to some...ahem...pudge issues.  The dryer is never left open and lord knows, my husband probably isn't entirely sure what the dryer is, so I'm pretty sure Gracie is safe."

A professional animal tracker is called to a house in the winter and asked to try to decipher the strange tracks in the snow.  The family that lived there was concerned that some strange winter-beast was scoping out their home, children and pets.  The animal tracker arrives and spends quite some time staring that the strange markings, then looks up and says ""You have a golden retriever, don't you?""."

TruckerCats,fdqyvzt,t1_fdqnngl,1578677024.0,I've actually ruined two DVD players because I'd tease/play with one of my cats by opening and closing the tray with the remote from across the room.  I'm still not sure if Gracie knew that I was responsible for it but we both had a heck of a lot of fun with it.  I think I used the second DVD player 90% for playing with Gracie and only 10% for what it was intended for!

These are well educated, sober women and they don't get it.  I have a good relationship with them and have taken the time to explain the difficulties to them and they STILL won't stop doing it.  Think how hard it would be to get the message across to someone dealing with mental illness, drugs or alcohol in their system, or if no one bothered to explain WHY they shouldn't do it.  It just won't work."
