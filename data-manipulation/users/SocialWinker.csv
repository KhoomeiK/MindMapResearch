His position was that he should not be tried because it could cause the peace agreement in Sudan to fall apart, leading to more violence. Of course, since then there was a civil war in Darfur that only really sorta ended when al-Bashir said he would not run again in 2015. Surprise, surprise, he didn't keep his promise, and won the election (opposition boycotted, so it wasn't much of an election). Then there was the whole violence against protesters in 2018. Shockingly, the people of Sudan weren't huge fans of al-Bashir at this point, especially as the price of food skyrocketed. There were mass arrests and a few dozen people died before al-Bashir was finally deposed last April. Now there's a transition government in place, al-Bashir has been convicted of corruption and other charges by a Sudanese court and will be spending 2 years in prison, after which he will be sent to the ICC to answer for the allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. So whatever your feelings on Franklin Graham, he got this one wrong.

As such, negative rights exist unless someone acts to negate them. A positive right is a right to be subjected to an action of another person or group. In other words, for a positive right to be exercised, someone else's actions must be added to the equation. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder. ""

Basically, a negative right involves freedom from interference. A positive right is basically required to be provided by an entity such as the government, for example healthcare (for those in most developed nations that aren't America).

With the nature of 1 year deals, there's minimal risk to giving these younger players a raise, so we don't see them try and cut pay often.
