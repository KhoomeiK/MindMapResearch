relationship_advice,ffvtiwr,t3_evhw3g,1580272821.0,"I dated someone four years younger and it was the worst relationship of my life. While he was a scumbag unrelated to his age, we were in such different spots emotionally and it was an impossible hurdle to overcome. Luckily he found a mistress who worked at McDonald’s and ran away to Florida with her, and I swore I’d never date someone younger again."
offmychest,ffsnasj,t3_euzwie,1580186112.0,"I’m a prior NG 68W and I had a lot of men who had similar experiences. I know you probably don’t want to, but counseling would help you tremendously; I saw it help lots of my soldiers who came back.

Thank you for your service."
ibs,ffsi9ox,t1_ffsd2ct,1580182361.0,"I thought about that, but the last time I ate shrimp (6mos ago?) it didn’t bother me a bit? And crab cakes don’t bother me, just the legs. So, no idea. I guess it’s just the richness."
relationships,ffqn96e,t1_ffpsof7,1580139063.0,"Looking up statistics and “research” is ridiculous. I simply said prepare yourself.

And please note how I did give you a specific way you will communicate - via email, or not at all.

Thanks!"
Advice,ffprv25,t1_ffpqsmc,1580103466.0,"Yeah, definitely don’t generalize! All the MA’s I work with love their jobs. And it might be worth it to become an MA because the schooling is not very long and not very expensive, and if you decide you like healthcare, you can start your nursing pre reqs while still getting healthcare experience.

I got an MA before going into nursing and it made a huge difference. I knew how to do IV’s, draw blood, do intradermal, subcutaneous and intramuscular shots, all ahead of everyone else. Some girls I went to school with couldn’t even take manual blood pressure yet. 

Like I said, it might be a good way to get your foot in the door, see if you actually like patient care, and then if you decide you do, you can get started into nursing! Or PA or whatever else you might want to do."
relationships,ffprn5p,t3_euj9rp,1580103251.0,"You should first know going into this that there is like, a 95% chance your relationship won’t last. I’m not saying that to hurt your feelings, it’s just true. So maybe try to prepare yourself for that on some conscious level.

If he’s underway on a sub, you’re not going to hear from him until he comes back up. He might have access to email, but subs are supposed to be undetectable and he will have serious restrictions. Your communication with be minimal, if you get any at all, while he is underwater."
endometriosis,ffpqcbb,t3_euj88k,1580102020.0,Are you in the USA?
Advice,ffpq9j9,t3_euj8og,1580101947.0,Maybe look into being a medical assistant? Or a surgical tech? The schooling is about a year and it’s still hands on. It doesn’t pay billions but MA’s and ST’s are always needed
relationship_advice,ffpavkf,t1_ffp964z,1580090479.0,"YES. This.

He turns to other women when things get tough. That’s not someone who should be married."
relationship_advice,ffp9ha7,t3_eugpy1,1580089506.0,I’d have left you after you created a dating app because you couldn’t be patient with my postpartum issues. Yikes.
GERD,ffp91yn,t3_eugqkp,1580089219.0,I only get symptoms in the evening/at night - I’m like a sundowner. It makes me dread night time and it also wears me out.
Outdoors,ffmiuuq,t3_eu8j2c,1580055373.0,Absolutely stunning
Outdoors,ffmisti,t1_ffmfk87,1580055343.0,Yes feel this! I’ve lived in CO forever now but always hold that blue ridge close to my heart.
AmItheAsshole,ffmijcc,t3_eu8hdw,1580055227.0,"NTA and never **would** be the A. I recently cut my dad out of my life - it was kind of without warning, except after a few days I wrote him a letter and told him why I was done. If people aren’t good for you, you don’t need them in your life, and this includes family. Don’t take the abuse, take care of *yourself*. Here for you if you need anything."
AmItheAsshole,ffk5gxv,t3_eu2odl,1580016492.0,NTA. You picked and paid for that seat. I hate when people act entitled just because they have kids.
raisedbynarcissists,ffjvfew,t3_eu14ud,1580008032.0,Yep. I heard that from my dad constantly before I went NC.
AmItheAsshole,ffjvd67,t3_eu1522,1580007983.0,YTA.  How dumb.
relationship_advice,ffjrvdg,t3_eu0179,1580005266.0,"I like to keep at least my shirt on and as many lights off as possible, if it’s fully dark I’ll take everything off. Everyone has their own preference, maybe he’s self conscious, who knows. The only way to find out is to talk to him about it!"
birthcontrol,ffjpmn2,t3_etzh8o,1580003784.0,We can’t tell you whether or not she’s pregnant. She can take another test in another week or two or go to the doctor for a test.
birthcontrol,ffjphw5,t3_eu02rj,1580003693.0,"I got the implant and gained 10lbs very quickly and my already out of whack hormones went even crazier so I got it removed soon after. I’m on a pill for endometriosis and it’s been the most effective for me so far. I wouldn’t get an IUD, personally."
birthcontrol,ffjp6sr,t3_eu08gk,1580003482.0,We can’t tell you if she’s pregnant or not. She needs to take a test after the appropriate amount of time.
ibs,ffj0qwz,t3_etwu3w,1579987479.0,I had a small one once years ago before I worked in healthcare and it gave me one of the worst stomach aches I’ve ever had.
