depression,fdiw8g6,t3_ello66,1578452450.0,"There is probably life route outside the competition where You wander around, don't give much shit about things and go from one job to another cause of boredom or lack of skills or lack of mental stability. I'm sure there are simple jobs  which can be manageable in small doses and if it meant traveling from place to place then probably You would need to leave some sweet extras and life habits behind. If You have loving family then they would welcome You back during hard times... Of course there is always route of being love bringer so You won't feel like only taking from others, but bringing love, too like Your family supporting You. Just nice person helping people at home. Even with depression there are small acts which can boost Your and others mood up. Maybe You are really introvert and closed, but trust me there is way to open up around good people. They are not here to kill You."
depression,fditpld,t3_el54zx,1578450820.0,"It's crazy how I can focus while playing such video games like Planescape Torment where You read crazy amount of text, think about philosophy, characters, complicated world, tasks, but my brain completely shuts down when I need to read few sentences for college or talk about basic stuff. I guess the moment I'm not interested is the moment my brain gives up and yes lots of times I'm afraid to answer simple question cause my mind can't put together answer so just trying to avoid or change topic as fast as I can."
depression,fdis56l,t3_eljn2x,1578449826.0,"ooh, I'm so stupid too like most college homeworks were zero effort disasters. For example one where I needed to translate text, I translated only small part of it then copied it in different ways to look like I have done more. Many times just copied stuff straight from wikipedia and usually hoped that others will give me answers in group chat. Lots of cheating and sometimes it was hard to even put effort in that. That's my way of college and I couldn't even finish 2nd year before giving up and then getting back to feeling like giving up again. Basically You aren't doing that badly when it comes to school things. At least I hope so.

At the end if You can't give money, You can give more love to others, family etc. That's thing I'm working on. Being nicer person, I guess and turning stupidity into charm and sarcasm. Will that be enough... not sure. Baby steps to improvement..."
