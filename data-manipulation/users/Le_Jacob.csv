Entrepreneur,fdlil6d,t1_fdli4th,1578524813.0,"When you drink or drugs, you have a good time, and I’m a big believer that everything evens itself out. If you take MDMA, you’ll feel absolutely fucking AMAZING for that night. You’re happy to see everyone, music sounds great, you want to dance.

The next few months you’re gonna be trying your daily routine, playing games and hitting the gym. They don’t compare to the MDMA trip you had, and you just can’t enjoy the daily things anymore.  **its all relative, which is why people feel up and down so often. Because they compare to recent moods** That means you stop going to the gym, you binge games and movies just to get near the happiness level you were once at.

Either you take more MDMA and go down a horrible spiral, or you force yourself to knuckle down, wait through the depression (however big or small it may be) and get back on track.

The past 2 years I have had the biggest depression of my life, and I’m super motivated to hit gym (because of all the pain I’ve endured, I’ve slept in my car for months and lost my girlfriend, family and business) and find happiness in the small things. It allows me to enjoy my work, take pride in my work, and therefore I’m much better at my work.

Take it one step at a time, and find your daily pleasure from non-artificial sources (gym and feel good about yourself, do boxing, go running, do some art, volunteer for charity, hike a mountain)."

Entrepreneur,fdlgf11,t1_fdlg3wr,1578523468.0,"I do a lot of experimenting with this and it’s all personal notes.

Listening to music seems to produce ‘happiness’. The more you listen, the less happiness produced.

A well-timed song (motivational song in the gym, love song during a breakup) can be used to condition yourself to have that feeling when you listen to it.

Overplaying a song removes this conditioning.

When I’m lacking motivation, I stop listening to music etc. I’ll then listen to a song that reminds me of a motivating time (reconditioning myself) and I find that may keep me going for a day, or more."
Entrepreneur,fdlfgrv,t1_fdl7w3p,1578522883.0,"Go to the gym, eat healthy, don’t smoke (or drink caffeine if you’re susceptible to anxiety or sleep loss). Drugs and alcohol affect you in the long term (up to 1 year) and you don’t realise it until you stop. Get something you enjoy (gaming, art, dungeons and dragons, badminton, train spotting) and do it regularly. Don’t masturbate too much and don’t listen to too much music. Most importantly get your priorities straight, do your washing up/cooking/cleaning/personal hygiene on a routine, make sure you’re happy with a hobby, then make sure you’re physically fit, then you’re ready.

The rest of your time will be optimal to work, whatever you’re doing you need to see to your natural human needs before you can think clearly. This is why people come up with these stupid ass ideas like a T-shirt printing company."
