seizures,ffh03i0,t1_ffetpim,1579919526.0,"I can corroborate his story. I have PNES and it was only after having both an EEG and a CT scan that the doctors actually came up with a diagnosis. 

Going to a therapist, as well as taking medication for anxiety and depression are what really started to help me. And after years of pestering from my mom, I started using marijuana to help alleviate some of the symptoms. She wanted me to use CBD oil, but I was against using that from the start because oils are just freaking nasty, and she was acting like it could be a cure-all for any type of ailment.

While I don't actually use CBD oil, eating marijuana buds and edibles have really helped me come a long way. I still have them occasionally, but nowhere near as frequent and severe as they used to be."
