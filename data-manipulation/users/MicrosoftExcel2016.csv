How can you make such a generalization without backing it up with sources?  
  
Answer: youíre wrong  
  
> There are thousands if not millions of different types of toxins in the world, ranging from full proteins to peptide-based to small organic molecules to completely different structures, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, the component of Gram-negative bacteria that causes septic shock). Some may not survive the digestive tract, others might. Some can act through the skin, others can't be absorbed. Inhalation is the next best thing to injection, but probably not for every single one of them, so it's impossible to make broad statements about their efficacy and median lethal dose via different routes of exposure. The exact same thing applies to the ""poisons"" category - while something that is damaging when absorbed cutaneously, such as methyl mercury, is probably just as damaging directly injected into the bloodstream, it's impossible to say that with certainty about all poisons
