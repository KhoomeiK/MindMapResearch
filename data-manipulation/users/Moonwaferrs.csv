beauty,ffqx0xt,t3_euqbag,1580145562.0,I'm turning 20 and I still have mine....I think it depends on genetics! I'm the only one in my immediate family with chipmunk cheeks (and it's facial structure based) so I couldn't tell u

DecidingToBeBetter,ffb4bhf,t1_ffb2csm,1579751437.0,"I just wanted to say I'm in a very similar boat, and I second this!

Also...make sure you get counseling/therapy! Don't feel bad about it, it really does make a difference. This is some really hard stuff. Get help!"
DecidingToBeBetter,ffb3njz,t3_esl56t,1579750953.0,"I hear it has a lot to do with positive self-talk. It takes a long time to cultivate, and it takes conscious effort. I've been trying it, and I do feel a little nicer. I try to talk to myself (mental voice) like I'm my little sister/kid, and it makes things drastically easier for me for whatever reason

EX: Should you tell your kid sister/brother/kid that they're worthless for making a mistake? Nope. Tell them how to do better next time and that it's ok. Stuff like that

Edit: Don't be afraid to praise yourself either! If I do something I'm proud of, even if it's really simple (i.e I clean up when I wanna stay in bed or choose a healthier coping mechanism) I tell myself I'm doing a great job, I'm doing good, etc."

college,ffb2n8n,t3_esh19l,1579750243.0,"1. Eases you gently into the social atmosphere of the school (not saying you buy friends, but social opportunities become much more available)
2. Involvement like the other dude said. Volunteering, becoming a member of the community. Does wonders for your mental health
3. Gives you an occasional break from soul-crushing academics

I'm not a sorority girl, but as a junior, I wish I had been. I kinda had your viewpoint about it, at first."

college,ff70j8t,t1_ff6uqvn,1579638689.0,"I agree. This is something I experienced as well and worked hard to get through. I still have to work on it sometimes. But some of the most random classes will have a presentation/group work component, you can't run from it forever."
DecidingToBeBetter,ff4und5,t1_ff4jtg4,1579572848.0,Have you been able to meet many people post-college?
college,ff2czaj,t3_er72ir,1579501179.0,"Oh definately! For me it's a mix of being in the wrong environment and being around so many others who also hate the school but feel obligated to finish. I can say definitively that these have been my worst two years (despite clubs, volunteering, neat grades, everything they say you should do), and I'm not looking forward to unemployment."

offmychest,fcvzbhu,t1_fcuuv50,1578013537.0,"I'm taking the time to focus on myself. The thoughts (at least in my case) have been right. I'm not ready for someone else, I hardly really have a relationship with myself and that's why I feel this way. Taking a break from dating and all that related stuff and (as cliche as it sounds) trying out new things, changing my social group etc. I want to believe when I'm ready to bring someone into my life again, I'll know. My friends and family think it's odd I want to take a long break from dating from this current heartbreak since I'm young, but Ik what's right for me. Manage yourself and the internal turmoil, and I believe we'll be ready to take care of another again one of these days. It'll be ok."
offmychest,fcutixo,t3_ej10qw,1577988196.0,I feel the same.
