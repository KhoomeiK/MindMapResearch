keto,ffphf55,t3_euhl4z,1580095109.0,Hi. I've been keto for over a year and I still use sugar alternatives (and enjoy them!) and many others do with great success. Get off your high horse.
dogs,ffphbr7,t3_euhmuz,1580095042.0,I play Pandora reggae station for my pup on the tv.

keto,ffpds7h,t3_eugn47,1580092526.0,"If I want it more al dente, I puncture it. If I want it softer, I saw it in half (carefully) and drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper and bake face down in oven on baking sheet at 375 for 35-45 mins depending on size. 

I usually scrape out the squash into a bowl, add all my fillings and cheese and repack it into the half. I bake it again for 20 mins and it comes out like a casserole."
dogs,ffpddjr,t3_euh37u,1580092235.0,"This is called superstitious behavior. 

I would start carrying treats **on** you while you go to get treats. Take it slow. Reward the behaviors he exhibits you want (sit, down, etc)"
puppy101,ffpd297,t3_euha0e,1580092014.0,It's up to you. I'm a fan of tipping people in cards personally that vibe well and go above and beyond with my dog. Food also goes over well!
