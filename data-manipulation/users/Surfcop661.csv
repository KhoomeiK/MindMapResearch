ABoringDystopia,fffpjnr,t1_fffja1c,1579889008.0,"The IE is full of meth, they just don’t make it there anymore.  LA’s meth comes straight from Mexico and is run by the Hispanic street gangs. 

California has become a one party state which is usually not a good thing. I’ve been here my whole life, and I love it here. I do think we are killing the goose that laid the golden egg. And I hope I’m wrong, but the exodus currently underway hints that I’m not. 

 I really don’t have a dogma when it comes to homelessness. I’ve seen it explode recently as we spend more and more money on it. If you subsidize something, you get more of it that’s not really a dogma, but that’s what’s happening here. 

In LA we aren’t honest about who the homeless are, and that makes most of the programs to help them fail. With exceptions, they are not just like us but down on their luck. We can’t just give them a place to live and some support and expect positive results. 

The mental health system has failed. There is no system in place to put a person desperately in need of medication. At best, they are held for 3 days, pumped full of sedatives, then released back on the street.   When cops are the initial evaluators to determine if someone needs medical treatment for a mental health issue, something needs to change. 

As far as the bussing homeless goes, it’s not something I’ve really noticed. It’s been an issue with local cities dumping homeless Downtown, but I haven’t heard much about out of state dumping.  I don’t think is a major cause of the increase here."

ABoringDystopia,fffh67o,t1_fff2on6,1579883868.0,"Most of the people in LA aren’t natives. The article is from The NY Times, usually a fairly reliable source. 

I have thousands of encounters a year with LA’s homeless. When they are coherent enough, I ask them how they got there. It’s anecdotal, but it’s obvious that mental illness is the main reason, followed by drug abuse and former incarceration.  I’m sure there are some who are like you say, but that’s not my experience. Really don’t care to look it up anyway. 

FYI, the drug labs in the desert is very 20 years ago. The Cartels took over meth production, and make it cheaper and better than the old desert labs.  Plus the restrictions on getting the precursors here in the state’s has nearly eliminated the made in the USA meth."

The vast majority of homeless in LA are home grown or come to LA on their own. Saying a lot are there because they were shipped out from other states is just wrong. 

And you have the cart before the horse. They are homeless because they are drug addicts. They are not drug addicts because they are homeless.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I think  the beaches in Central America, Indo, Australia and most California beaches are nicer.  (Venice and Santa Monica and most of the Southbay excluded.). Big Sur takes my breath away every time I see it. Never saw anything in Florida nearly as stunning. Carmel has white sands and is prettier than the gulf coast.  And North San Diego county has the best beaches in the country, it’s just not affordable. 

And have you been to Manuel Antonio?  I would take pretty much any Pacific coast beach in Panama, Costa Rica or Nicaragua over anything I saw in Florida.
