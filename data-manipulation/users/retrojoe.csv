New York is the example case of stop & frisk being a racist practice.  
Here's a [NYT editorial explaining how a federal judge says that NYC has been conducting illegal, racist search and seizure](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/opinion/racial-discrimination-in-stop-and-frisk.html) under the guise of stop and frisk. The meaty paragraph is:

>the city conducted an astounding 4.4 million stops between January 2004 and June 2012. Of these, only 6 percent resulted in arrests and 6 percent resulted in summonses. In other words, 88 percent of the 4.4 million stops resulted in no further action — meaning a vast majority of those stopped were doing nothing wrong. More than half of all people stopped were frisked, yet only 1.5 percent of frisks found weapons. In about 83 percent of cases, the person stopped was black or Hispanic, even though the two groups accounted for just over half the population. 

Here's a [great paragraph from the NYCLU](https://www.nyclu.org/en/press-releases/analysis-finds-racial-disparities-ineffectiveness-Nypd-stop-and-frisk-program-links): 

>Last year [2012], the NYPD stopped and interrogated people 532,911 times, a 448-percent increase in street stops since 2002 – when police recorded 97,296 stops during Mayor Bloomberg’s first year in office. Nine out of 10 of people stopped were innocent, meaning they were neither arrested nor ticketed. About 87 percent were black or Latino. White people accounted for only about 10 percent of stops.  

If you're the sort of person that says 'show me the data', then you can look at this [academic analysis of NYC stop and frisk searches](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256067814_An_Analysis_of_the_NYPD's_Stop_and_Frisk_Policy_in_the_Context_of_Claims_of_Racial_Bias) broken down by precinct that show, even when you account for the racial make-up of the neighborhoods, black and Hispanic pedestrians are stopped and searched at a rate far higher than white people, which can't be justified. This paper has been cited in 153 other academic papers, which is a lot. 

**TL;DR - NYC shows that stop and frisk is not used well.** 88% of searches turn up NOTHING. 6% of searches led to a ticket. 6% of searches led to an arrest. Most of these searches targeted black and Hispanic people and the vast majority of them were innocent."

>I don't see how this works, if someone buys or rents they still fill 1 dwelling. The reason rents go up is supply and demand. So if more people are moving to the area or housing is being demolished rent prices will move. I don't see how buying vs renting impacts it.

We saw something like this in Seattle. New Money comes in, bidding/buying up the nice houses that aren't mansions. The group of people that formerly could afford those either bid higher, go after the next lower tier of housing, or go to the rental market. These shifts ripple down the ladder until people who could maybe have bought a house five years ago are stuck renting because house prices are rising at a higher rate than they can save for a down payment. The people who were renting and just hanging on before are forced to double up with others or have to move to the next town over and commute in.

As real estate increases in value, more of the upper middle class feels pressure to buy before housing is out of reach. House flippers come in to make a quick $50k to $100k as the feeding frenzy climbs. Speculators begin to see it as a better investment and buy it to hold or rent. The supply of houses shrinks as the older houses get bought up and new housing can't be built fast enough/is too far away/is too expensive for average families. 

People who have houses see all this. They might cash out move away from the region. If they do sell, it's probably to downsize because they'll have a hard time trading up due to competition and price. More likely they're holding on, watching their equity get more valuable. That also reduces supply."
