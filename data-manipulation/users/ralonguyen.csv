aww,fe87bal,t3_enu32f,1578923385.0,"While the gesture is amazing, there are a couple of reasons why this is a bad idea:

1 - Companies that specialize in cribs and cradles are required to undergo safety tests to ensure less chance of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).  As evident by recalls, this testing doesn't guarantee safety for infants; however, said required due diligence should not be overlooked.  Looking at this design, I would be wary of the lining of the cradle suffocating the infant.

2 - This baby is gonna use this cradle up to 18 months max; then all you can do is take the boat off for the child to do some imaginary play.

But kudos to the grandfather, showing his skills.  True craftsman are a dying breed."
