Sometimes, this is true. 

>Those short moments of happiness are not at all worth living for, considering most of your life will be spent on misery.

It's horrible that you feel that way..


>As humans, our curse is that we are never pleased with anything.

Greed is a terrible thing.  It's good to learn to be happy with what you have, because changing it may only take away the ""small"" things you have, making you wish you had those things again.  The grass isn't always greener! 

>No point in being happy nor bitter, just live life as long as you can or end it early, in the end, nothing matters.

Be happy! Life is too short for bitterness and unhappiness.  We will not get everything we want , when we want.  We can be mad for those few minutes, but in the end, I am grateful for everything I have, because I could have less.  

It does matter.  Try to think positive."
CasualConversation,ff7zuyz,t1_ff7wvft,1579662342.0,"Great comment but here we go. 

>you don't know if people deserve something or not

Mm, I disagree. For instance, if you have someone that treats you well, and you cheat on them and treat them terrible, you DON'T deserve them.  And they DON'T deserve you.  They deserve a lot better. 

> your happiness shouldn't be affected by what someone else has.

You are correct.  Don't allow yourself to be unhappy and negative and bitter because someone has what you don't, and what you want. 
But, 
Ex: People work their butts off and don't have anything. They work and work and nothing ever comes out right, whereas there are people that DON'T work, have never worked, feels like the world owes them something when the world doesn't owe them a piece of sand, and they have everything.  And they take advantage of the good they have in bad ways!  Aka, being nasty to other people, acting like they're above and beyond because of their situation, when in reality, they haven't worked for any of it.  Silver spoon and golden platter. 

>I never look at someone with beautiful features/hair/etc and think ""fuck that person. That body should have been mine.""

You never know what someone has been through.  Maybe their whole childhood they were told they are ugly (jealous of the people they deem nice looking) too fat (jealous of people they deem to have a nice body) too dark, (they WANT that light skin, bitter towards anyone lighter than them).. you never know."
