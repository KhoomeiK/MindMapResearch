movies,fgva7t7,t3_f0lkpn,1581142066.0,Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough are both enjoyable but not as good as Goldeneye. They have a real 90s cheesiness to them and some of the dialogue is cringeworthy but they both have some good action scenes and are worth watching at least once. TWINE kind of broke the standard Bond film template and had some interesting ideas. Die Another Day is Pierce Brosnan’s only outright bad film but it does have its moments here and there. You’re best watching them and deciding for yourself if you like them.

JamesBond,fgr8102,t3_f002ql,1581040411.0,"I’m looking forward to seeing Rami Malek in the role of the villain as I think he’s a very accomplished actor. I just hope they have given him something decent to work with and I hope he won’t be playing Dr No. There’s no need to bring his character back and if EON intend to continue to making Bond films then they should be coming up with new characters instead of recycling old ones. I’m also really keen to see what score Hans Zimmer will come up with for NTTD as I like a lot of his work. Ana de Armas should be good too hopefully if she’s been given a decent character to play. I just the other two Bond girls have some personality and charisma, particularly the one that’ll be 007. Neither one of them seem very interesting in any of the promotional material for the film."

JamesBond,fge9fch,t3_exytmd,1580694403.0,"I’d say Craig definitely. Quantum of Solace had a few very violent scenes like the motel fight where he stabs the guy in the neck. Also Casino Royale with the nail in the eye. Dalton only really got violent with Licence to Kill, The Living Daylights wasn’t that extreme."
JamesBond,fge8ohl,t3_exyjes,1580693885.0,I think the DB5 has been really overused in the Craig era. I didn’t mind its brief appearance in the first two Brosnan films and Casino Royale but bringing it back in Skyfall just seemed a bit pointless and cliched especially since the Craig era is a reboot with no connection to the original films. It was something special to the Connery era not the Craig era. But other then that I look forward to the new film.

JamesBond,fgd8la1,t3_exrn47,1580680007.0,"Licence To Kill is not among my personal favourites, but I see why it's become a favourite for other fans. I particularly liked Robert Davi as Sanchez, the tank chase at the end, which is one of my favourite action scenes in the entire series,the soundtrack and Gladys Knight's title song. Pam Bouvier is also one of my favourite Bond girls and I liked Q’s role here too. Its grittier nature made it rather different and interesting at the time. Good film overall, though I still think The Living Daylights was Timothy Dalton's best film.8/10"
JamesBond,fgadds8,t3_exmyoe,1580649922.0,For Your Eyes Only is a brilliant Bond film and probably the most interesting of the Roger Moore era. I loved that the gadgets were removed and it was back to the basics. Also Melina Havelock was a really solid Bond girl and I like that she had her own motivations for the film. I could have done without the Bibi character though. Moonraker I can tolerate but I don’t enjoy it as much as Roger Moore’s other films and it’s too similar to the far superior Spy Who Loved Me.
oddlyterrifying,fg8fxpr,t3_excut4,1580618320.0,Looks like something out of a horror movie.
