offmychest,ffd0y1s,t1_ffcktcc,1579811255.0,Took me 6 months of applying hundreds of times. Got maybe 5 phone interviews and no in person interviews and then all the sudden all at once I had 5 phone interviews 5 in person interviews and 4 job offers all at the SAME TIME. Like some switch was flipped. Keep at it man.....

At least 90% of the time probably more!"
offmychest,ffd0j8x,t1_ffceweo,1579811029.0,"I spend so so so so so many hours filling out forms full of the same shit my resume had. I got so fucking tired of it. I applied to maybe 250 postings over 6 months the last time I did a job search and I was so glad to finally land the job I want and not have to do that shit anymore. It drove me INSANE.

WHY will you NOT read a resume? its ridiculous."
relationship_advice,ffchnz0,t1_ffcdcq0,1579799673.0,This was my thought. It may not be all that great to have 2 people with crazy demanding careers where you never see each other.

dankmemes,ffcfd4c,t1_ffca4sw,1579798260.0,They do. however the PS4 has to be in rest mode. Even tho its not a lot of power usage I still dont like to leave it on rest mode all the time just in case a game update comes out. Just feels wasteful of electricity.
dankmemes,ffceeea,t1_ffca28p,1579797667.0,"Even if you have 600 kb/s and it should take an hour it never ends up taking exactly that amount of time. Bandwidth fluctuates all the time on both ends of the connection. That's why the ""time left"" predictors are never very accurate."

My goodest boi demonstrated his guard dog skills one night. My friend was coming in for my wedding and getting into my house late so I left the door unlocked for him. When he got in the house my dog would not let him take another step or he was going to fuck him up. He didn't calm down until he saw me give him a hug and be friendly with him then he realized the guy was not an intruder. 

Definitely woke up the whole house if not the neighbors."

It's all negotiating power one hospital can't negotiate price with an insurance company as well as a whole country can. This also includes equipment, pharmaceuticals, and everything else that goes into the cost of health care. 


Ah well I guess next major surgery I need I can always travel to Europe, get the surgery, vacation for 3 weeks while recovering and fly back for 1/2 the cost of the same surgery here in the US."
