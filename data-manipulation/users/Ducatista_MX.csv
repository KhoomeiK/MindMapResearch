Yes, and you will have ""a rock and a rock and a rock and a rock"", not a number ""four"". Again, numbers don't exists in nature, numbers are ideas in a mind.

&#x200B;

>It did not increase just in your head. It did so even if your a dog with no concept of numbers. This is math \[...\]

Wrong, something increasing is not math. A chicken laying an egg is not doing math, is just laying an egg. Arithmetic [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition)  is a mathematical process, it requires numbers. You can represent ""3+1=4 rocks"" mathematically but first you need to learn to count.

Without numbers, grabbing another rock is having more rocks, not doing math.

&#x200B;

>It’s why a few philosophers thought numbers had a physical existence on a different plain of existence, since their existence without needing a human mind was so self evident.

Yeah, those philosophers lived two thousands years ago.. those ideas are obsolete now, as most of the knowledge of that era. The world of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areas_of_mathematics) is orders of magnitude bigger than what Plato could imagine."

What exists is ""a rock and a rock"", nothing more. A ""two"" is not there, look as hard as you can and you will find only rocks.

Because is easier to say ""four rocks"" than ""a rock and a rock and a rock and a rock"". A ""four"" is not there, only rocks.

>The word is not the Logic, the underlying concept is the Logic. And that concept preexists the word describing it.

Sure, but ""concepts"" are abstract ideas.. literally just ""thoughts"". Without minds thoughts don't exist. Without minds you only have ""a rock and a rock""."
ChristianApologetics,fdpjy7j,t1_fdphvia,1578630679.0,"Wrong again.. sexual reproduction requires a male and a female individual of the same specie.

A person that hasn’t learn the concept of “2”, would not have an idea of what you are trying to say. Without a mind to create the concept of two, it will not exists.. 

Think about this, if you put two rocks in a bucket, you’ll have a bucket and a rock and a rock.. Saying “two rocks” is an abstract form of saying “a rock and a rock”. If you add another one, you will have “three rocks”, or “a rock and a rock and a rock”. 
It’s that simple, and it’s also obvious how practical this concept is, and why every civilization managed to invent numbers of their own."
ChristianApologetics,fdntjav,t1_fdlnsno,1578592537.0,"> Sure, one group might use the word two while another group might use the word dvah. But the underlying principle intended by both words remains the same.

Here's where you are wrong: 

The word ""rock"" and the word ""priedra"" represent the same object in two different languages.. the object exists regardless if a word for it exist.

Now, the word ""two"" and the word ""dos"" (or the symbol 2 for that matter) represent a concept, not an object.. there's no object ""2"", you can't find it in nature, you can't get a buckets of ""2""s.. Two is an abstract idea, it only exists in a mind. It is useful for us to communicate and represent features of nature that we observe, two is a human invention.

It's pretty obvious then, if a mind doesn't exists to conceptualize the idea of ""two"", then the concept does not exist. Without minds, numbers don't exist, math does not exist.. abstract things don't exist."

ChristianApologetics,fdl3l4a,t1_fdamaqd,1578516470.0,"I think you are very confused about what ""math"" is.. 

Math is only one form of  language, you can say ""the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides."", or you can say it ""c2 = a2 + b2"".  
You see, both statements say the same thing.. but the ""math"" way of saying things is more useful as a tool to derive knowledge, like finding the length of the hypotenuse.

In this sense, the fact that a triangle has defined properties that can be expressed mathematically doesn't mean that math exist because of that, math is just a way of describing this properties. Math is just a language, and thus invented. The triangle properties are the ones being discovered, math just help us express them. Math is just a human invention the same way english language is.

The ""laws of logic"" are on the same boat.. through them we express properties of reality, ""something is what it is"" is an introspection created in our minds, and thus a human creation. Sure, regardless of human evaluation things are still what they are.. but the expression is only valid through evaluation, and to be ""true"" a human mind has to be involved."

Ok, so your definition of god includes the ability to create universes from somewhere else outside such universes. Got you.

&#x200B;

>Hawkings statements rely on assuming no such God exists. 

Such gods are irrelevant to Hawkings statement, He is talking about the properties of reality. Reality as far as we **can know it** is limited to this universe, with the properties it encompasses. Hawkings doesn't need to assume the existence of alternate planes of existence for his statement to be valid.

&#x200B;

>And then he adds something irrelevant to God, i.e. that the space-time we live in started a a singularity   and anything subject to that space-time \[...\] would have no time to create anything. 

Exactly, now you get it.. Hawkings statement has nothing to do with alternate planes of existence. He is talking about **reality.** Whatever exists outside reality (if anything at all), is irrelevant to Hawkings statement.

&#x200B;

>I am assuming nothing except what the definition of God is. Hawkings argument is on its face incompetent.  

Hawkings doesn't need to weight his argument against your assumptions, or anyone else's for that matter. Hawkings needs to weight his statement against reality, nothing more. 

A four sided triangle is impossible in our reality.. sure, a metaphysical being capable of creating four side triangles can be assumed to exist, but that assumption doesn't make it any less impossible.. and yes, a ""four sided triangle"" is as nonsensical as ""change without time"".

Is it? 'Cause I'm pretty sure I'm getting it.. you define god in a way that bypasses reality, then assume this definition is correct, and then you expect for science to somehow ""disprove"" your assumptions.
