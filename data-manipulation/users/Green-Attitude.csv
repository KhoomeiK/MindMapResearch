offmychest,ffgb91h,t3_et5tt3,1579902431.0,"I used to strip when I was a lot younger than I am now, and I agree it's not something you should be judged for. You do need to be very careful, though. 

There are men who will try to get your contact information, or who will put pressure on you to meet them outside of the club. 

At some clubs, prostitution becomes common enough that dancers who won't do it can't make much money. 

There *will* be a handful of plain clothes cops, and people involved with human trafficking, at any given time. 

The club you're at might be better than mine was, if you're making that much money every shift off of dances. Just remain alert to danger."
birthcontrol,ffemna2,t3_esx347,1579854686.0,I'm so sorry you're going through that; I would be mad too. That really blows.
offmychest,ffee25o,t3_et4xdz,1579844572.0,"I deleted Facebook and it turned out to be a really good decision. No more wasting time surfing through profiles, or worrying about being stalked by others or offending great aunt Karen with spicy memes. I don't miss it."
offmychest,ffbazzf,t3_eslxla,1579758020.0,Yes
offmychest,ffbahfy,t3_esoiqg,1579757435.0,"Jesus, that's creepy. I'm sorry OP. If I was you I'd run now, lease or not. When i say run, I mean like - find a new place and then pay someone $50 to make a phone call to Bob from a burner phone, telling him you died. I don't even know what I would do in your shoes. Do you think your parents might be able to help you out with this situation? I don't know them at all, but sometimes parents are cool like that."
prolife,ffb7zdo,t1_ffatk2j,1579754469.0,"Eh, you know, I thought about it a bit more and you're probably very right. I think I'm just a little batty right now because *I* want to have a baby, especially twins. I don't know if I'm really all about this pro-life stuff. I'm probably just hormonal."
prolife,ffb630t,t1_ffb4u56,1579752778.0,"This is an honest question because I actually don't know about this: what are some of those countries, specifically? I'm just an ignorant American, and when I hear ""first world country"" I think about places like the US, Canada, UK, Sweden, etc., where abortion is fully legal or even subsidized. I realize that those aren't the only first world countries though; I'm just not as aware of first world countries that don't permit abortions."
prolife,ffb5d9w,t1_ffa83fb,1579752230.0,"I remember one time I was at a happy hour with my old boss, and she said I could just wait to get pregnant until I'm 40 or 45. 45? All of the women in my family have had their kids between age 18 at the low end and 34 at the high end, I don't know what kind of fire I'd be playing with in my mid-40s... it's awful."
SuicideWatch,ffay7qv,t1_ff8m6aj,1579747247.0,"No, I'm sorry but this is bad advice. I don't know if I can explain this well enough, but as someone who has seen suicide before, it's not about how much you love them or how much they love you. When someone is suicidal, it's more akin to a medical emergency like someone about to have a heart attack or a stroke. We all would like to think we're powerful and important enough to be the hero and change their mind, but in reality they need to go to the ER."
SuicideWatch,ffax0j4,t3_es9ma0,1579746454.0,"Call the police, don't try to sort this out by yourself with love or snuggles. Even if you have to set him up or he gets angry at you for sending him to the psych ward where they will ultimately take him, this is what could save his life. That may sound harsh, but I know of someone who didn't make it because their girlfriend found the note and waited too long to alert anyone."
prolife,ffan19t,t1_ff9cftl,1579739786.0,"Well, that's fair enough. But especially in America and other countries without a strong social safety net, some women are involved with prostitution and things like that for real. I've seen a lot of shady stuff, and there's something suspect about a woman aborting healthy twins and claiming that her ""boyfriend"" is totally along for the ride, all while ranting like someone who just escaped from a mental hospital. I think there could be more to that story than meets the eye."
prolife,ff9d0a8,t1_ff6iq5v,1579710274.0,"At the risk of sounding like an old lady or something, I think you sound like a very thoughtful and caring young man.

Those women who responded to you probably didn't take you seriously, but I see your perspective as a conscientious one."
prolife,ff9bbf2,t1_ff6i2wg,1579709063.0,"I am in the US, and I agree that this is a major problem within our culture here. I'll be honest -- I used to look down on women who were teen moms, or who seemed extremely young and unprepared. But as I get older and my window of prime childbearing years gets smaller, I've begun to think that they may be better off. If you had a baby at 17, your kid is school-age and out of diapers by the time you're 22, and you still have plenty of time for things like education and a career. I'm sitting here at almost 27 trying to find a life partner, and my boss would probably hate it if I got pregnant and needed to take maternity leave...all of this because I believed that having a child at a young age would ruin my life."
prolife,ff9a3l6,t1_ff6j8e9,1579708300.0,Thanks for sharing! I'm definitely interested in learning more about this.
prolife,ff999ra,t1_ff80ldu,1579707783.0,"All I'm saying is that while I do think abortion should be a very rare thing, to a much greater degree than it currently is, I also don't know that I'm in favor of overturning *Roe*. There is the question of separation of church and state, and the question of whether the government should be given the power to hold a gun to someone's head to force them to continue a pregnancy. 

I don't want women to be forced to have kids they don't want, so I think in that sense I would technically be pro-choice. But at the same time, abortion is *so* preventable that I think people on both sides of the political aisle should be placing much more importance on things like making birth control accessible and teaching people how to use it. At worst, the pro-life side doesn't support contraception enough and the pro-choice side acts like abortion is just something everyone does and then ""shouts"" about on Twitter."
prolife,ff97yio,t1_ff8872y,1579706939.0,"Well, it's obviously not a procedure that should be a first-line resort or birth control method, you know? The fact of the matter is that whether you think it's ""murder"" or not, somebody dies. It's also an expensive, invasive medical procedure - either an induced miscarriage with the abortion pills, or a surgical process. 

There's nothing about it that is ""nice"", or ideal. And there's no reason for it to be happening left and right. Unfortunately though, sometimes it *is* necessary to save a woman's life, or in cases of rape and that kind of terrible scenario. These things do happen...I have a distant cousin who got pregnant at 12, and I do not think a child is capable of being a good mom."
prolife,ff96qhl,t1_ff81wlw,1579706149.0,"I understand, and I apologize for any offense that my words caused."
prolife,ff80oxv,t1_ff6j5sn,1579662944.0,"Yep, this exactly. My parents weren't wealthy people when they had me. They were 24 and 29 and lived in a small cheap apartment. As a family, we didn't move into our first house until I was 2 1/2 and my brother was about 6 months old. He was born at home in the dining room of one of our apartments to save money. My grandparents were working class, military. Grandma delivered mom by herself in Oklahoma, and called my granddad at his station in California to tell him the news. I always felt like our family was doing well."
prolife,ff7zmuz,t1_ff7uoqf,1579662184.0,"*Shrugs* Well, I've found that people have wildly different opinions about this kind of thing. I think it depends in part on differences in life experiences we've had. I've never been pregnant and probably can't have kids, so I think there are some aspects of abortion that I can't totally understand. Does that kind of make sense?

I know my wording was harsh, but if you read that post you'll see why it's pissed off so many people. The way she was talking about getting rid of her twins was beyond belief."
prolife,ff7crd3,t1_ff7bv4u,1579646535.0,Really? I actually didn't know that.
prolife,ff7asf4,t1_ff5rbvw,1579644902.0,"So, the thing is, I don't know that I'd say I'm /not/ pro-choice. At the end of the day, I think there are some circumstances where abortion should be a safe and legal process. But I also think it should be far more rare than it is. This is 2020 and we have all kinds of birth control methods that are pretty darn near 100% effective, combine that with things like condoms and Plan B and I don't know how anyone is getting pregnant on accident these days. I'm pushing 30 and I've never been pregnant. 

You may have seen a post with over 3,000 upvotes from r/childfree where someone was claiming they got pregnant with twins on the pill and had an abortion....that didn't seem kosher to me. I bet she's right back on her knees and the father was a pimp named Little Tony or Mr. X or something. She's gonna realize one day that twins don't grow on trees, but it will be too late. Life doesn't hand us more than a couple of gifts apiece, that's just how it is. 

I'm not as pro-abortion as I was in my early 20s because I'm not as naive as I was then. I think society is failing mothers and partially hiding behind a smokescreen of ""motherhood is just an option!"" as an excuse. But I'm also not exactly pro-life because I don't know if ending a pregnancy is really the kind of choice we can make for each other."
prolife,ff6mqdt,t1_ff6lco0,1579630500.0,That sounds really good! Almost like a Southern version of Irish coffee.
prolife,ff6hhwf,t1_ff6g6aq,1579627310.0,"Yeah, that's definitely very true. I also thought it could be because I live in a somewhat more conservative part of the US where Planned Parenthood may not be as well-off as in places like California or Massachusetts, so they may be more desperate for donations here? I still think they do good work with regards to things like contraception, but also think it's slightly concerning that they aren't more concerned with privacy given the sensitive nature of their business. It doesn't affect me personally, but getting a letter from them could be a big problem for some people."
prolife,ff6fqru,t1_ff6dra7,1579626222.0,"These are good questions too, Zora74! I'll get to these in a bit."
prolife,ff6f7xu,t1_ff5rbvw,1579625894.0,Those are good questions! I'm gonna do my best to answer them after I drink my coffee.
prolife,ff5mpji,t3_epwrpf,1579600584.0,"I know which post you're talking about, and I'm personally leaning towards the suspicion that it's a fake story. I did a quick Google search, and apparently most people don't know they're having twins until they're at least 10-14 weeks pregnant. Maybe more than that. So if this story is really true, someone who is supposedly hardcore childfree waited around for 2-4+ months to get an abortion? Sure."
