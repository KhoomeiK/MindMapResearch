I have investments, I own property, I have a good profession that pays well when I get a contract, I have a wife and a daugher I'm crazy about, lot of good friends and creative outlets, but I can't ever seem to actually feel happy. So, like, I could say 'being young again' or 'having ten million dollars' but I really don't think that'd do it. I honestly couldn't tell you. I wasn't super happy when I was young and money would just complicate things. Maybe the ability to eat whatever the heck I wanted to eat without gaining weight? That'd give me some ocassional happiness, maybe. Very illuminating question."

movies,feahb4a,t1_feaeiw0,1578948736.0,"Yeah it's a strange choice. But maybe it's because like with Venom, he's not, like, a *bad* guy. Like, he's a gifted doctor and surgeon with a wasting disease and he's looking for a cure. He finds it but it comes at a horrible price. Sort of like the Lizard. Or how Venom is a jerky weightlifter who gets subsumed and posessed by the symbiote. I even think Morbius teamed up with heroes now and again in the comics IIRC. I agree he's a weird choice. We'll see how this one does and, if it does well, how the next one does. It's like they're doing their own little weird thing over there at Sony of dark, sympathetic villains. Like the Dark Universal thing that was attempted but with super villains from comic books."

Is the plot incoherent? Who cares? Lasers! (Or for horror, it's like ""Is the villain one-dimensional? Who cares? Gore!) And we're all so hungry for quality that we WILL rush out and consume whatever's offered. So the producers get the wrong idea. But if a sci-fi movie bombs then the maker's ass-covering decree is that it's the genre's fault, not the quality of the product.
