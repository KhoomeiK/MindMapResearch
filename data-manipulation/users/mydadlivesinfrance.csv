When you mention veganism and its affect on climate change, you always get the canned ""its not individuals its corporations"" response.


All this screams to me is: if they were in charge of those corporations, they would behave in just as recklessly. If you cant even make the change for yourself, what the fuck makes you think you're any different?"

PETA has the unfortunate issue of being blunt about hard truths. They don't sugarcoat anything. For the best comparison I can come up with, and probably because I was reading about it this morning, I'll use the trolley problem with a few adjustments.


PETA is place in front of a train switch with 5 people tied up on one track and 1 on the other. The trolley company somehow profits off of this, and the overwhelming majority of people are okay with, fund, and participate in this. 


PETA has about a minute to make a decision, so they step up to the switch, place their hand upon it  and say, ""Tying people to train tracks needs to stop. I don't care that you enjoy it; I don't care that many people make a living doing it; and I don't care that your uncle runs a trolley and takes really good care of his people before he ties them to the train tracks. I will work tirelessly to stop this from happening in the future, and part of that work will be showing others graphic images of other trolley deaths. For now I will pull the switch to kill the 1 person, because that is the least amount of suffering."" Then they throw the switch.


The other scenario is that there is no escape no matter what happens, if PETA kills the 1 then the 5 will starve, dehydrate, or succumb to the elements. Or possibly live forever tied to the tracks, fuck, and create more people tied to tracks. In this case PETA kills the 5 to minimize the suffering, supposing death by trolley is the most humane killing practice available as stated by the national trolley victim doctors association and the national trolley humane society.


Now I don't necessarily agree with this scenario. In fact, I don't agree with the opposite either. No two situations are the same and require the same practice."
MurderedByWords,fdgqwh6,t1_fdgn360,1578405984.0,"And my point is that is the situation vegans face at nearly every restaurant or event they are invited to.


And i'm sorry they didn't ask if they preferred murder. I'm going to the pool later and I'll be pretty upset if they don't have a death option."

vegan,fdewwje,t1_fdeq4vq,1578348307.0,"Yea, places should slaughter living beings for my enjoyment. 


Now imagine every menu item from fucking carrots and salads to a bowl of nuts having animal products in it."
vegancirclejerk,fdat7fo,t1_fd8o2vz,1578249810.0,"Yeah, they cant wrap their heads around the ""process"" of mixing, heating, and pressure to make meat replacements.


But grains, grass, and antibiotics force fed to a cow, mashed up in saliva, broken down to a cellular level by stomach acid, filtered through organs, passed through the bloodstream, assembled into flesh, slaughtered, skinned, sliced, doused in minerals, and then heated is perfectly understandable.


TL;DR: a single 101 cooking class teaches how vegan ""meat"" is processed but it would take a 4 year biological, anatomical, and chemical course to fully understand how flesh gets made."

However, weighted training at 5-10% of bodyweight has shown improved performance."
