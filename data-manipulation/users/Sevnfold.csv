videos,ff5ghoq,t1_ff4yjxu,1579591826.0,"So basically Billy Mitchell was the record holder for a long time until Steve Weibe (player in this clip) beat his score. Walter Day (in the referee shirt) was basically the judge, he received score submissions and validated them for Twin Galaxies. It's important to know that there was a small group of people who cared about this scene of vintage arcade records, and Billy was sort of the Micheal Scott and Walter was Dwight Schrute.

So after Steve legit beat the record there was a little back and forth of new high scores. Two things happened, Walter accepted fishy submissions from Billy and if I remember he gave Steve a hard time. So Billy submitted a vhs tape of him beating Steve's score. But if you remember vhs tapes you know they can be a bit fussy, so at one point in Billy's tape it gets fussy and blacks out for 2 seconds and when it comes back his score had jumped up. That should be enough to disqualify the submission but Walter accepted it. And like another comment said you have to play on an original motherboard. But surprise, there was some confusion on that with Billy's game. So theres strong evidence Billy and Walter cheated, to put it bluntly.

Honestly if someone told me to watch a documentary on Donkey Kong I'd be like nah. But somehow it's really interesting. And if you watch it, King of Kong, you get to see Billy act like hes a living messiah but hes really just a huge dork."
