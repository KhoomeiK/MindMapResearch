dankmemes,ff4yarh,t1_ff4uafu,1579575367.0,"The origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of English school football at  Rugby School in Warwickshire in 1823,

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union

What is considered to be the first American football game was played on November 6, 1869

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football

Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to rugby occurred.During the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football

Alright, previously, I didn't really read the last one, just saw the date and made the edit. Now I know the date means that it's the time when Rugby similarities occurred but the game itself seems to be older according to the article. So according to wiki, what I call ""real football"" was still first.

But yes, others mentions seem to be roughly same years (definitely same century when you only look at the first official games)  and similar games appears through the whole history so I still stands a little bit corrected. So to me it's fifty fifty now."

E: just thought it might be ok to add that according to Wikipedia, American football's first game dates to November 6, 1869 while our football's first games dates to xx BC which is the reason why I call it the ""real football"" - because of history, nothing else. To me those are completely different sports.

First I'd like to say - don't look at the price, I'm just talking about how good it's supposed to be.

Second - looking to the side would actually be helpful, but if you want to race, I think looking to the front is enough (I've never been on any of these tho so I might be really wrong). But it's still not that hard to put more monitors in there if the game allows it.

Last - I don't know, I really feel like proper chair with proper steering wheel, pedals etc. would give me worse experience than vr. It is always possible to connect it all to vr and still have the proper feel tho but then you're just trading the monitors for vr set and everything else pretty much stays.

I'm in country where if you're not on highway (which connects only the most important cities, it's not everywhere) you drive through some village literally every few minutes. In a collage you are supposed to go 50 while out of it you can go 90. While it seems logical to go 50 in bondage and it probably is, it's also pretty frustrating sometimes, going from speed to show every few minutes while the road is still same. Usually if there's not radar, people go to something like 65, but sometimes someone goes 50 Everytime. If you're not used to that, is super frustrating and if roads are frequent at the moment your usual distance you drive in 20 minutes became 30 minutes and you literally can't do anything about it because the car in front of you is right and you're wrong. Not advocating this behavior, just sayin' that it might be really frustrating.

The thing is, in order to put it in public and make it more enjoyable, you need to solve these problems.

The biggest problem being wg have always had problem to reward support. I mean, just think about it, you see your group is bigger so you rush the enemy. Since your the first one, you die immediately, but because of it your whole group follows and they basically win the game. Whole game can be won because of you, but you get the least xp and credits. That's why nobody really does things like these, things that would actually win the battle.

Another problem is also the fact that most players would have really big problem using it correctly. Do you really think most arty players would use smoke screens? Especially - would they use them correctly? (For example to cover lights before they get the sweet passive spoting spot or covering the heavys so they don't get shot before getting to their position). Or do you think the cooperation in public would be high enough for the other types of grenades to be useful? (If arty fires it at TD's in mines, would your teammates use the advantage and rush heavys while they still can?)
