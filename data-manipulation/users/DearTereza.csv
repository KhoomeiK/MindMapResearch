BrandNewSentence,fffkq33,t1_fffk2nl,1579886067.0,"How many cats are sharing a box? Burying waste is instinct. Problems with it indicate problems with the box, same principle. Should be at least 1 per cat."
googlehome,fffhqt4,t3_et8ypl,1579884226.0,"Just as an additional aid to anyone dealing with this confusing aspect of Google Home, remember that 'Groups' and 'Pairs' are different. Speakers in a group will all play the identical sound (useful for things like 'All speakers'). Pairs are stereo split, allowing the speakers to play different sounds to create true stereo."
BrandNewSentence,ffffu8i,t1_ffffnmc,1579883043.0,I do exactly this! Definitely works.
BrandNewSentence,fff2stk,t1_ffeu4nr,1579874164.0,"Just because there are so many posts like this, a suggestion from my own trouble with this.

What finally worked for me is feeding my cat a small meal when I go to bed. She then has a quick zoomie and goes to sleep. If you feed them at human dinner time and expect that to be enough till morning, then by the time you go to bed, they're hungry. They have tiny stomachs! This is why they then go all zoomy and chaotic. Kitty is hungry!"
BrandNewSentence,fff2o0o,t1_ffezyfc,1579874058.0,"To anyone reading this who actually has that problem, cats only poop outside their box if A) The box is not clean B) They're being forced to share a box with other cats. They have strong instinct to bury their waste (an adaptation to prevent potential prey knowing there is a cat around), so if they do it outside in the open, they are in distress. They wouldn't choose to do that otherwise.

If they pee rather than poop outside their box, it can be the reasons above, but can also be territorial marking if they feel insecure (may happen when a new pet or human joins the household)."

whatsapp,ffc7y8h,t1_ffc32qu,1579793609.0,"Thanks but no, I have my WhatsApp pictures set to not sync with Photos. Deliberately, as I don't want most of it backed up.

I have now received clarification from WhatsApp on the matter. The nightly backup file created is absolute, so images deleted from the device will also be absent from backups made after that point."
oneplus,ff9hai5,t1_ff9g1x6,1579713000.0,"Thank you, this is great!"
killthosewhodisagree,ff99cqe,t1_ff97pr8,1579707836.0,"Yes, I tried to broaden it out in my reply because it's clear to anybody looking around earnestly that this is a universal problem. As you say, it's human more than it is political - the same can be observed with peoples' attitudes toward sports teams, home towns, spiritual affiliation/lack thereof.

It's very telling that a global resurgence in nationalism is happening at the same time as the increasing radicalisation of large swathes of the global left. Everything is shifting to extremes. It's profoundly dangerous.

It's a great shame that the internet, which has the potential to broaden access to knowledge and perspectives, is for many simply functioning as a tool to greater insulate oneself from differing perspectives and narrow down a filter bubble. The people I know who are more aggressively on the 'left' or 'right' are marked by their shockingly ignorant perception of what the 'other side' is actually thinking. It's all daft caricatures or extreme examples they found on Twitter."
oneplus,ff8ysw9,t1_ff8vgsx,1579700371.0,"Perceptually, the difference is marked. I see a more linear descent of my battery percentage. It used to fall very rapidly and the phone would go into battery saving mode, with all the attendant anxiety that brings. The meter is now more linear and doesn't incorrectly flag my battery as being below 10% when it's clearly not. Recalibrating the battery has increased the actual time my phone is usable, because it's no longer thinking it's empty before it actually is."
killthosewhodisagree,ff8vi6t,t1_ff8pqkp,1579697495.0,"Absolutely agree. I wrote a long comment on this the other day, and was summarily downvoted to hell because people either side couldn't tolerate the idea that perhaps extreme polarising rhetoric on both sides of the political spectrum might be counterproductive.

Indeed, this one will be too because any criticism of the newly aggressive left or increasingly polarised right will cause people without much subtlety of thought to instinctively 'disagree-vote'.

This sub ought to be about showing the worst excesses of polarised, us-them thinking - literally people calling to 'kill those who disagree'. And the posts certainly are. But the comments are a total shitshow of us-them bollocks."

killthosewhodisagree,ff8ocn4,t3_es47ik,1579688728.0,This subreddit has gone to shit. The comments under any given post just turn in to brigade voting on political lines. It's so ironic for a sub with a name like this one. I've seen this on almost every post now.
oneplus,ff8o7rk,t1_ff6xh9l,1579688520.0,"Perhaps you aren't aware of the reason people recalibrate. It's precisely because the percentage display gets out of whack with the actual physical, chemical capacity of the battery. The whole point of calibration is to reset that percentage display to get a more accurate idea of the state of the battery pack itself. The display is calculated rather than measured, thus it is prone to becoming erroneous over time."
oneplus,ff8o46y,t1_ff7ytpu,1579688371.0,"Thank you, that's an excellent suggestion and I will do just that."
oneplus,ff8o3ce,t1_ff7jm44,1579688336.0,"I love that phone, but the huge number of reports of it having green screen tint at low light is a huge oversight and to me suggests OP chose a substandard OLED panel for this model. Apparently it also has worse viewing angles than the Pro, which backs up this idea that the panel is lower quality."
oneplus,ff68tp2,t1_ff675da,1579621840.0,"Thanks friend. If the recalibration doesn't prove to have made things sufficiently better, I'll do this."
oneplus,ff649zl,t1_ff5ymjy,1579618760.0,"I looked into this, and found a good battery at replacebase, but removing the phone back looked like a tricky clip situation. Was it really not that bad?"
Kitboga,ff5t7gp,t3_erln4t,1579609340.0,"The only sad thing is it's next-to-impossible to explain to friends why daily scambaiting streams are actually the surface understanding of what is really a community, full of positive attitudes, acceptance, positivity, all-purpose nerd-ery and general loveliness. It's such a peculiar, eccentric, and very-internet thing. Pretty much impossible to communicate what this channel/community 'is' in any meaningful sense to somebody. Even showing them an episode/clip/stream isn't enough, it takes a while to 'get it'."

killthosewhodisagree,ff4ejfg,t1_ff3sntb,1579561725.0,Well we're both getting plenty of 'disagree' votes from typical Reddit leftists who don't realize they're as bad as the right wing cultists they're lambasting. It's a depressing statement of our times that it's now controversial to argue for civil discourse and the free exchange of ideas in a peaceable fashion. Our generation would rather insult and threaten one another.
killthosewhodisagree,ff3nm50,t1_ff3fjm0,1579544906.0,"You are suggesting a dangerous game of descent into anarchy. If you don't support raising the level of discourse, you're merely an anarchist and perhaps and anarcho-communist judging from the above. If that's the case then our disagreements are too broad for constructive debate in this thread.

Ultimately though we disagree, it's with a common goal of finding the best way for people to coexist, thus I can still only wish you well."
killthosewhodisagree,ff3ne45,t1_ff3izr9,1579544768.0,"I agree with that, there are some people on the left behaving abominably and creating a very dangerous culture that is anti intellectual. I agree with a fair chunk of Jordan Peterson's assessments on this matter.

Where you and I perhaps differ is that I see it on both sides and it's hardly new. It's just gotten worse lately as the internet has allowed people to be radicalised by their own filter bubbles."
killthosewhodisagree,ff3dmx8,t1_ff3bxra,1579538996.0,"I was railing against uncivil discourse, not war, or rising up against tyranny. You have straw manned me in the most peculiar way. Are you suggesting that more insults would have prevented the holocaust? I presume not.

You have listed the sort of causes that had clarity about them, so the argument feels cohesive. But the person threatening violence here is merely aiming at at the perceived 'right wing'. This is not in any way comparable."
killthosewhodisagree,ff3ddq3,t1_ff3c6dr,1579538865.0,"I think we're broadly in agreement, actually. I'm coming from this idea that the newly aggressive left is a very dangerous thing and no better than the aggressive right it is countering. I'm not making any judgements on which is 'worse'."
killthosewhodisagree,ff3a3fc,t3_ereyun,1579537194.0,"It's so depressing to see a post like this 'Like'-d so much. The same sentence threatens to 'beat the shit out of you' for being 'inhumane'. The author has apparently seen no problem with this.

It's so important that well-intentioned people who make arguments associated with the political 'left' do not fall in to the same traps as those on the 'right' whom they are criticising. Civilised discourse benefits everyone. Aggressive discourse is the least likely to convince anybody of anything, which is rather the point of discourse itself.

If somebody is being inhumane, it sufficient to rhetorically demonstrate that point. You might even make them realise that and revise their position. Throw in threats and insults and you most certainly won't.

This is why our generation's polarised politics are so bad at producing meaningful dialogue and subsequent societal progress.

EDIT: The slew of downvotes this painfully-reasonable comment is receiving within minutes is evidence of its very point. Sorry - my bad - burn the non-believer!

EDIT 2: If people are reading from this that I am more or less critical of the left or the right, you are applying your own lens here. I am deliberately being neutral and not inserting my own view about which 'side' is 'worse'."

wholesomememes,femo5oj,t1_femn3nm,1579264404.0,"As a general rule no, but it's totally dependent on context cues. There are envisagable situations in which it's fine and even sweet, but many where it is not and is just going to make somebody uncomfortable in a context where they still have to be nice to you and can't get away. Redditors will rush to more extreme polarised opinions for this, but I think it's really just a prime example of 'context is key'."

Additionally if you watch the 'Making Of' documentary on Netflix, it's clear that Netflix has a really close relationship with the Henson company.

DarkCrystal,fe7im0u,t3_enf8qx,1578915039.0,"In what way does any of this 'vilify threats to the status quo'? If anything it's the opposite - the 'bad guys' that always get overthrown invariably represent authoritarian power and greed. The 'threat to status quo' is seen as morally superior and wins in the end. The Skeksis are pretty obviously meant to be a symbol of excessive drunk capitalism (see their decrepit 'fine' frocks, jewellery, sucking up the planets resources etc).
