Don’t worry about how you look, work on overcoming your ego instead. That’ll take care of so many areas of your life, and it’s very likely it’ll shed light on personal issues you didn’t even know were there. Besides, plenty of ugly people have incredible game. Look at Patrice O’Neal.

Btw to be clear I’m not trying to accuse you of having an ego in the connotative sense. Just based on this post you don’t seem like a stereotypically egotistical person to me"
