LifeProTips,fep4sxt,t3_eq7dmv,1579312137.0,"In a snow storm in a busy tiny two lane road, a jerk cut me off to pull into an auto body shop.  A trail of cars behind me saw it happen and after my husband flipped the bird, a woman behind me did the same to that jerk.  You never know who's also watching too.  Why would she?  I had to do a sudden stop and she could had rear-ended me if I didn't catch it in time."

Its... a lot to take in considering his suicide years later.  But the thing that made me happy the most about this movie is that... while I don't believe in the afterlife, I like to believe that there's a beautiful place that exists somewhere in death (and it is nothing at all).  I try to picture the world like it is a painting before I go.  Even if its going to be nothing, its worth believing in and thinking about up til you die."

AskReddit,fek513o,t3_epj100,1579192751.0,"Everblue 2, very... niche and underrated.  I don't know who else had even played this when I've talked about it online many times since its release.  I'll come right out and say I'm a huge fan of underwater games such as Ecco the Dolphin series, Treasures of the Deep, Aquanaut Holiday, Endless Ocean and its sequel, and a few others like it.  Underwater games are far more rare and I suppose a lot of people do NOT like the genre but that's because it is in game that is mainly a platformer (TMNT, Mario, Zelda etc).

Everblue 2 is an incredible game for a treasure hunter.  It scratches all kinds of treasure hunting itches it has.  There's a huge number of collectibles that you can get, and you can get more once you've upgraded your equipment.  The best part about the collectibles if that you help people along the way in doing their side quests.  There's a complaint that this game is slow but if you're going to explore the ocean, you'd take it slow!

Quite honestly, there's no other game like it."
todayilearned,fei98dp,t1_fehp1jf,1579133119.0,"I used to volunteer at a shelter and I always dismiss the cats that does the leg rubs and head butts for the first 10 minutes.  You want to look to the cats that are shy at first and then warmed up to you later.  I was there repeatedly and those cats that does the warm ups in the first 10 minutes never did bothered me much after that first visit.  The shy cat however took a while to come out of her shell and clumsily came down.  This shy cat was consistent in the greetings and I found out a month or so later that she apparently almost never came down for anyone else but me.  You better believe that I was heartbroken and knew I had to get this cat home ASAP.  My husband and I met her again later and she came down and walked across our laps purring super loud!  And you know what else, a month after that realization, as soon as we walked in the door with a cat carrier to the counter (transparent glass window facing into the cat room nearby), she came down and was ready to go home with us!  Best cat ever and still is.  She was a 8 years old large gray tuxedo.  She's turning 13 in a week.  We love her so much."
aww,fdruug4,t1_fdreskv,1578690145.0,"Torties don't have a speck of white.  Calicos do however.  You're thinking of calicos and most tri color cats (black, orange and white) are actually female while the orange or black and white are males.  There are rare exceptions to this rule though.

IAmA,fdniof1,t3_emb3u8,1578586618.0,"I don't have questions but I highly suggest you look into your pooch's diet about those ""deadly farts"" your dog is having.  Its a sign of intolerance or a food allergy that have a massive impact on its skin.   Rottweiler is a notorious breed that is already suffering from food allergies.  So I highly recommend you look into that."

aww,fdhy3qh,t1_fdhoaht,1578432263.0,"I've volunteered and worked at a shelter.  We had a cat that is a diluted tortie and she was probably something like 12 years old.  I don't know how long she was at the shelter but I know it was long as in two years.  She was the oldest cat as well as the most problematic.  She couldn't walk her hind legs very well, and couldn't use the litter box very well.  She also one of those testy cats too.  She'll bite you if you try to pick her up.  One of our shelter coordinators loved her and wanted her to have a lot of chances... when honestly she would had been put down already.  On top of that, when a pet bites someone in the shelter, they get pulled to a ten day quarantine.  Rules were very strict about that and Sheeba (that's her name) got pulled often where she barely got any audiences to see her which also compounds the problem to the length of her stay."

Our voices are affected by how we hear ourselves and trying to mimic the sounds when we learn to talk eventually.  I didn't talk at all until I was four.  Mind you, I did made sounds but they're more like squeaks or shrills but nothing comprehensible."
