AskReddit,ffhhdp4,t3_etcyd6,1579935314.0,Acknowledge the fact that they are pressured by society to suffer without showing any pain or emotion. How much shit do men go through that they're expected to just let roll off their backs? I know so many men who work hard and struggle and literally bleed to do what they think is right. Our men are not disposable.

AmItheAsshole,fdn4kxg,t1_fdn39j4,1578577103.0,I know it's not but sooo many people at powwow are from Canada and I've never heard anyone call themselves aboriginal. It's always we're *insert tribe* from Canada or First Nations. Also so many people rely on their on their craftmenship to bring in money that it makes no sense to discourage a sale to anyone. ESPECIALLY since good quality handmade muluks are expensive af.

Try telling yourself that ""these thoughts aren't helpful or worth my time"" when you get caught up in negative self talk. Or picture saying those things to yourself as a child. Little you didn't deserve to feel bad and neither does grownup you."
AmItheAsshole,fczfj2k,t1_fczeqy5,1578100124.0,Yes declining would be the ideal solution.
AmItheAsshole,fcyxlxw,t1_fcxtudg,1578089315.0,Yeah but those were your -friends- who I assume you like. Not a sibling pulling the family obligation card because she's unpleasant enough to not have a single friend.
