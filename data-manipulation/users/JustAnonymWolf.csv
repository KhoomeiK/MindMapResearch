Also, electrical stoves are a relatively new thing here. Probably came to market somewhere in the early 10's, but because stoves are not something you buy often it took some time for them to get known.

Still not popular as there are many places build with the gas pipes in and it would be more expensive to get rid of them.

We made one for class one year. It was between Christmas and Halloween so we combined them.

We made a huge star. Stuffed it with candy, added ribbons to look like guts.

Decided to add lots of perforated paper residue (the little circles). Someone had a glitter jar, we also poured that in.

Then we added small balloons filled with red gelatin.

To top it off, the pinata itself was made from lots of layers of TP and glue. Extra sturdy.

We attempted to break it, but it was too resistant. Got the one of us that was into boxing to hit it with a broom stick.

The force made everything fly through the class: hard candy, ""guts"", paper flakes and the balloons.

People got hit, clothes got permanently stained and the cleaning was just excruciating. Not to mention the glitter, a permanently addition to that class now.


_But it was fun_"
