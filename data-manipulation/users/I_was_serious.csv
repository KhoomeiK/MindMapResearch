The way the book I have explained it (and it was written by a psychotherapist but not jung) would make me think, for manipulativeness, try to incorporate strategic planning. For acting violently, perhaps just strong assertiveness is enough. For deception, maybe just more privacy instead. (Not sure about that last one. I'd have to think about it a lot more for find an adequate way to view that one.) I don't understand it as a ""dark side"". More a hidden, rejected side. But I realize I could be wrong in how I'm  viewing it."
Jung,fdnnb63,t1_fdnmusi,1578589356.0,"Thanks. Ill check that out.

 The book I read was by David Richo and it had a section on shadow work that advised to pay attention to those qualities you can't stand in other people, especially in people of the same sex as you, and find a way to incorporate those things in a positive way. An example it gives is if you're a woman and you hate  another woman's judgmentalness, you can try to embrace discernment in order to find the positive aspect of judgmentalness and also integrate it. So you're seeing what's in your own shadow by your negative reactions and responses to other people. In a way, it seems like sneaking up on the shadow or learning to see your own projections."
Jung,fdnit76,t3_embege,1578586699.0,"This quote is great. The concept of shadow always seems so slippery for me, and I'm never sure if I understand it correctly. 

The other day I learned about what's currently called ego depletion and I thought a saw a similarity between that concept and this, whereby when you've run out of willpower, you're left behaving negatively or with hostility or just 'not your normal self'. 

But it seems like newer schools of thought didn't integrate any of Jung's concepts, even when he may be describing effects that nueroscience is finding causal explanations for now. Or it's possible that I'm just making false connections between entirely different concepts. Idk. 

My understanding of shadow work is that of full self-acceptance, rejecting no part of yourself and finding a way to see enough good in that which you reject to be able to own it fully. Can someone tell me if I'm totally off on this? And if anyone knows about the ego depletion thing, is it just absolutely something else entirely or is that possibly pointing at the shadow too (i.e. describing the same phenomenon)?"
Jung,fdndw29,t3_eldgiu,1578583715.0,"That's not my understanding of meditation. For me, it's not ignoring thoughts, it's noticing them and returning focus back to the breath. So you end up more aware of what's going on in you because you're not judging it, reacting to it, analyzing it or any of that. You're just noticing what's there. Some things may keep cropping up over and over, and those probably deserve some attention afterward."
