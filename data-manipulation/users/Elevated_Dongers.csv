I just don't know how to get through to them, and I'm considering telling them if they vote for him they're going to see and hear a lot less of me. I just can't wrap my mind around it. They got my sister too, she's leaned into the delusion. My sister acts like she's ready to die and get to heaven. Her phrase lately has been ""if I die, I die"".

It fucking hurts dude, I feel like *I* was the delusional one all these years thinking my parents had a good head on their shoulders. It seems like they are getting worse. They basically live at the church, they're there every chance they get. I actually got my mom to say that Obama was ordained by got after she told me that Trump was ""because god says all leaders are ordained by him"". That was kind of funny but less satisfying than I had anticipated."

Especially In patty form with onions and garlic and bread crumbs and some soy sauce. You should give tuna a chance. Very healthy.
