walmart,ffwzpc9,t3_evmcd2,1580314623.0,"Go for it! Good managers are few and far in between so you want to learn from the great ones and she seems to be one. If you work as good as you do, its already a plus. Pace yourself though and know when to say no. Hard workers are usually pigeon holed because they’re good at what they do. Good luck kid"

todayilearned,ffncq3u,t1_ffmgzng,1580064353.0,"Lol! You gtfoh. Did you not watch the documentary? You seem to be ignorant of a piece of your own culture. Yes, today most choose their lifestyle but there was a time where it was forced on a male who had no female siblings. Samoans are also very connected to the church while at the same time tolerable of homosexuality and child molestations. Lets not get carried away with samoan pride. Respect and value have lines that should never be crossed. Nice try, private joffery baratheon"
