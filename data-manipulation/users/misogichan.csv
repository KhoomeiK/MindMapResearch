The biggest problem with vacation rentals in my view is that they don't compensate the non-owners for the shit they have to put up with.  There's a pretty argument to be made that Hawaii is at or close to the maximum number of tourists our infrastructure can handle (road traffic, water resources, waste disposal, airplane seats, etc.).  Hotels pay Transient Accommodation Tax so they're helping pay for this infrastructure tourists use.

An economist would probably tell you the efficient solution and socially optimal one is you charge a fee/tax to the Vacation Rental Units to do business that's high enough to cover their infrastructure costs and also discourages inefficient/marginal TVUs from being in the market and wasting tourist infrastructure resources.  That sounds basically like what they tried to do (albeit they made some pretty silly moves at first when trying to enforce it leading to neighbors of TVUs being threatened with fines, but they seem to be steadily moving towards greater competency)."

1. Delays and mistimings in when they signed construction contracts resulted in some contractors not being able to work during the time they were contracted for and then the state had to pay penalties and the contractors passed along their additional costs (e.g. heavy equipment that was brought from the mainland but sat idle).
2. The county overpaid for land acquisition.  There was only 1 guy who filed suit against the government because they felt his land was undervalued and countless stories about them paying above market prices.  For example, a church I went to had a radio tower in the path of the rail.  The state paid them for the property and then paid for temporary facilities to allow them to continue broadcasting in the meantime elsewhere.  Because of the delays the government paid about the same amount for the temporary facilities they rented for the church as they paid for the land.

Also, we know there was good reason for the feds to get involved because the state's auditor launched an investigation and the Rapid Transit Authority stonewalled the investigation and told employees not to speak to him.

One commentator mentions how technically fuel dumps can take time, so it might be safer to not take that time and just get on the ground ASAP with an overweight landing.  Another aspect, though, of this is that this was a transpacific (13 hour) flight fully loaded, so it might not have had enough runway to do an overweight landing even though the plane was designed for it.

There's also questions about why didn't the pilot dump it earlier, since part of the 25 minutes he was in the air he was over the ocean, so why didn't he realize he needed to dump the fuel until he was on his final descent.  Then again, depending upon when he realized he had engine failure, and when he knew he would have to make an emergency landing it might have been too late to drop it over the ocean."

tech,fe5bp5d,t1_fe37zwf,1578867354.0,"**At 8TB, this is the largest portable SSD we've seen**

By [Paul Lilly](https://www.pcgamer.com/author/paul-lilly/) 2 days ago

I'd totally jam 8TB of portable SSD storage into my pants pocket if (A) such a drive existed and (B) it was reasonably priced. Point B will be addressed at later date, because SanDisk, a division of Western Digital, has taken care of point A. Well, sort of.

SanDisk did actually build what it claims is the world's [first 8TB portable SSD](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005229/en/Western-Digital-Brings-Innovations-CES-2020-Demo) (I can't find anything out there to disprove the claim) and has been showing it off at CES this week. However, it's just a prototype at the moment.

There's every reason to believe this will become an actual shipping product at some point. Unlike some prototypes, this is not some whimsical new bit of tech. It's a capacious SSD stuffed into a durable-looking, pocket-sized enclosure with a mini lanyard. But then there's point B.

Pricing will dictate if this is a feasible product for the masses in the near future. Collectively, we're very fond of Samsung's T5 SSD, which tops our list of the [best external hard drives](https://www.pcgamer.com/best-external-hard-drives/) (and might be supplanted by the recently announced [T7 Touch](https://www.pcgamer.com/our-favorite-portable-ssd-is-getting-a-2x-speed-boost-and-fingerprint-sensor/)). And that gives us a good frame of reference—the largest capacity is 2TB, and it [sells for $350](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/portable-solid-state-drives/portable-ssd-t5-2tb-mu-pa2t0b-am/).

SanDisk also offers a portable SSD in a similar looking enclosure. It tops out at 2TB as well, and costs [$270 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078T9SZ3K/ref=twister_B07Y17L7BZ) (and has an unrealistic $500 list price). At four times the capacity, the 8TB prototype could conceivably carry a price tag above $1,000.

That's where I would lose interest, and I doubt I'm alone. The good news for SanDisk (and Western Digital) is that SSD prices have come down a lot over the past several years. The bad news is there are market indicators of a [pending spike](https://www.pcgamer.com/predicted-rise-in-nand-pricing-could-make-ssds-more-expensive-this-year/) due to NAND flash memory costs. If that comes to pass, it would be more reason to delay turning the prototype drive into a retail product.

SSDs are of course inherently faster than HDDs. The bottleneck on these kinds of devices is the interface, and in this case, the prototype takes advantage of the latest USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 specification (20Gbps). Looking strictly at the interface, the theoretical maximum bandwidth available is 2,500MB/s.

SanDisk isn't providing any benchmarks or details about the SSD inside. I can confidentially say it won't offer 2,500MB/s transfers, because if nothing else, overhead will make that impossible. But there is the potentially for this to be not only the most capacious portable SSD on the market, but one of the fastest as well."

worldnews,fdgost8,t1_fdghqpw,1578404290.0,"I wouldn't say the religion is based on it.  If you go back to the original texts Jesus makes it pretty clear that money should not be important.  In fact, your mortal state shouldn't be important except to the degree to which it helps you share the gospel with others (e.g. ""blessed are the poor"" because the rich are distracted and weighted down by their wealth).

I think you're right about money corrupting the church, though.  One of my favorite orders are the Franciscan Friars, who took vows of poverty, but even they became divided and split over the form and extent of poverty necessary.  Money brings power and power leads to corruption.

I would say though that a lot of their problems also are caused by loving traditions and the prestige around it over their brothers and sisters.  It's basically another form of pride that blinds them from wanting to do reform and be open about the rot that's grown."
todayilearned,fdgc6ft,t1_fdfyj91,1578389613.0,"Yup, I remember one meeting I was told to forecast the cost allocation for something.  I told that can't be done definitively or simply because several departments all share it and are contributing to the cost and even if one drops using it the others will still require it.

I go and do it and then present it and then they argue how these numbers are useless because it's all based on a bunch of arbitrary assumptions I've laid out and there's countless ways to have sliced and divided the expenditures.

Long story short, I realized the key to speaking to management isn't to tell them the truth.  It's to tell them the truth they're in the mood for that day.  If I'd just switched what I presented on each day they would be ecstatic because we would be in sync.
