Regarding your behaviour being a ""me"" problem, that very much depends on what your intentions are here. If you wish to get through to nobody by acting like an asinine prick, then I suppose carry on. You're doing a great job of being a terrible person. Buddy."

You didn't make the distinction between party and ideology when you claimed the left does good while the right does bad. The best reading of your comment would suggest you were referring to the ideology, because you literally were talking about ""the right"" and not ""the Republican party"". Nevertheless my point still stands, because what I said can also be said about political parties anyway, so I don't know what the fuck you're even on about. 

You argue like a diseased chimp with an itch he can't reach. What are you, thirteen?"

worldnews,fexemsy,t1_fex20gu,1579429747.0,"The left is not good for everyone but the rich. You are so wrong about that, but it's understandable. You need to learn more. Recall the worst atrocities in history were committed by the left, and they resulted in the deaths of hundreds of millions. Or did you think communism was fine? Do you understand what tendencies motivate the radical left, and what conclusions play out? You should probably look into that, so you know better what you're aiming at.

I am neither rich nor right-wing, but I take great issue with the left when it gets out of hand because in many places (work, school), they constitute the tyrannical majority that can't be criticised. You probably can't imagine the left has ever done anything wrong, but as of late, they are the most censoring, anti-diversity-of-ideas people there are. They will mob you, shut you down, defame you, police you, and dox you if they become convinced you're worth ruining. And all it takes is having a different idea, maybe a right-leaning one, or a left-critical one, and you're done. This is not the hallmark of social justice, but of ideologocally-possessed radicals on the march towards misguided oppression.

The left gets fat in politics just as much as the right does, unfortunately. And the right balances the left necessarily, so they both have their places. For example, the right supports hierarchies, which you get as soon as you value anything (particularly competence), whereas the left speaks for those dispossessed by the hierarchies, especially as they tend towards corruption. You need both otherwise you can't have anything, but few understand their etymology, function, or motivation."

teslamotors,feemsn2,t1_fedr43z,1579036928.0,"Yea it seems to be in the ECU programming to retard engine power until it's warm. It's a good feature. You hear stats thrown around like >50% engine damage is done within the first 60 seconds of start-up, with the good news being you can mitigate this by simply letting it warm up a bit. Let the oil get to temp and go where it needs to, makes a lot of sense. Cold days, I idle for a couple minutes and go easy on the throttle for the first five-ten minutes of driving, until the engine temp gauge levels out. Should keep the car happier long-term.

Bombing,fcyce0x,t1_fcy67ec,1578077990.0,"Go bomb streets, but don't blow the yard spot. It's toys who don't know what they're doing who end up getting security heightened at yards that used to be chill. Usually it's because they have no conception of what they're doing at all, which is why people talk about rules. 

At the end of the day, yards won't last long-term unless people take certain precautions. Yards aren't a free-for-all, they're different. You have to know how they work. I'm aware of the contradiction between ""rules"" and ""illegal graffiti"". It's kind of like laws of war. 

So long as you come correct, yards can be painted for decades more. But if toys blow the spot, then no one can paint there anymore. This is why toys get jumped, and yards get regulated. There are dos and don'ts. If you don't know, ask. Better yet, stay the fuck out or you will be capped."
biology,fct6id4,t3_eioanp,1577934155.0,"A good rule of thumb is: for every hour spent in class, you should be doing three hours of independent study for that course. 

Some lectures are merely meant to canvas the material and show you what to focus on. Then you go home and review everything on your own. Come back to lecture armed with questions, or better yet resolve those questions during office hours. Pro-tip: it's a lot easier to learn concepts quickly by having an active conversation about them with an expert. Professors are almost always delighted to chat with you during office hours. Office hours are a highly productive and under-utilised resource.

If you want to get the most out of lecture, then you can study the material prior to class so you're not seeing it for the first time as it flies by you rapidly. That means: do the reading and attempt the exercises ahead of time. (It's very hard to do this.) The payoff is, by the time you get to lecture, you'll be filling in the gaps as opposed to drowning in new material. Lecture will consolidate the information you took in during in your independent first-pass. Then you can ask far better, targeted questions during class. 

The benefits of such preparation also highlight you as an actively engaged student in the professor's eyes. This sets up a great relationship, and often leads to opportunities to work in labs or become a graduate student. Most students don't do this, so you will stand out easily. Other students will also start coming to you for help, which confers benefits too. After lecture, if you have some good questions, it's usually possible to go up to the front and speak to the prof for a few minutes. They can give you hints, and this will help get you on their radar.

So don't just show up and expect the class to teach you everything. It's not going to work. Instead, be a prepared and actively engaged student and you will fast rise to the top of the class. By doing so, you'll develop skills for success (such as foresight and time management) that are highly transferable to other domains like your future career. Easier said than done, of course. Procrastination and scraping-by is much easier, and something like the default student behaviour. But if you can overcome this, then you will be a superstar and things will come much easier to you."

POLITIC,fbipkmp,t1_fbidcqw,1576908850.0,"The rule of thumb is: extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. 

If you're asserting some bullshit, then the burden of proof is on YOU to support your claim. Otherwise, the reasonable thing to do is reject the claim for lack of evidence. This is what Politifact did: reject the bullshit for lack of evidence. It's fabricated tripe for dummies, obviously.

You don't get to say ""but where's your proof the claim was false"". It's up to YOU to provide proof your claim is true in the first place, otherwise it's unsubstantiated *by definition*. ""There's a 13th planet and it's made of cheese and diamonds"" doesn't count for shit unless there's some evidence to support it—of which there is none, so the claim is rejected. Does that make sense? Can you wrap your braincells around this simple concept?

It's like you didn't even think this through at all. You seem completely unqualified, and far too stupid to claim anything about anything, so you should probably just shut the fuck up 'cause you're embarrassing yourself, you harmful idiot. If I was you, I'd spend some time thinking about how to be better 'cause let me tell you, you are right at the bottom of the pile, bucko. How's the weather down there?"
