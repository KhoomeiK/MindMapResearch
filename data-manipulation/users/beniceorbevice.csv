For it to be considered a national passenger railroad it has to go through something like 90% of States, if the long haul lines were cut, Amtrak would not receive any govt funding any longer. If they wanted to keep Amtrak only in the Northeast corridor the rest of the States has no interest to keep funding it. There are tons of people who have been interested in buying and privatizing the Northeast corridor themselves - and it would be very profitable. But the long haul routes can't stay afloat on their own then. It's either keep it all the way it is, or cut lines to the rest of America and privatize the Northeast but you can't just cut off the rest of the country.

Hold on what did you earn? A job that put you in the position of others' future lives? Who put you in that position?

I don't even need to know anything about you I'm 100% sure another girl checking out your social medias for hire would probably dismiss your application too. Why? Because girls hate each other's lives especially if someone looks better or lives better than you. You can argue all ""that's not me"" but that's exactly you because you checking their life out before you even spoke to the person is exactly that.

Also, you're basically saying just because you have money to go to law school you should be able to do these things, but the person you're hiring -  should also be a lawyer, no? You're literally down talking all your equals and even ones who have more experience than you in the field assuming a bunch of the applicants had experience
