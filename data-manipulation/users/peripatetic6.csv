solotravel,ffhk3wu,t1_ffhil34,1579938926.0,"Sorry I was so vague. I've never been there but tentatively plan to spend a lot of time there when I retire. Big draws are the favorable visa rules for US citizens, and the low cost of living.

So I'm interested in:

Cost of living/esp short term rentals. (I am looking at airbnb).

How difficult it'd be if I only speak English.

Safety for a woman.

Politeness of locals. I don't really want to make friends, just treated with courtesy.

How easy it is to get around without a car.

How walkable it is.

Architecture. Natural scenery. (I don't care about shopping at all.)

Restaurants/food. Coffee!!!

Climate. I can research this to some degree. I think it has super hot summers. 

Transportation between Tbilisi and other attractions in Georgia towards the mountains.

Thanks very much!"

ViewAskewniverse,ffgp97n,t1_ffchr8y,1579911598.0,"The only reason I wasn't disgusted at this terrible movie was because I went to a reboot roadshow. Being in Kevin Smith's sweet presence and listening to his masterful storytelling makes me happier than almost anything else could. Love the hell outta that guy.  Seriously so grateful he's still around. 

Hope he has more great movies in him like: Chasing Amy, Dogma, Clerks. But in any case I'll always be in his audience fan-girling away. 

I'd rather be in a Kevin Smith Q&A after a bad movie than see any great movie."

ViewAskewniverse,ffeeyx5,t1_ff4imcn,1579845480.0,He was never a snarky asshole. Never. Don't know what Kevin Smith you're talking about.
ViewAskewniverse,ffeep6l,t3_esvez0,1579845205.0,"Just saw the Salt Lake City screening and agree it's a bad movie, though the plot surrounding Jay and Millie was the thing that worked for me. And the experience of the movie with the crown including Kevin was awesome. Most important Kevin spent a LONG time answering questions afterward and talking. He could just have a nightly fireside chat and I'd be there. He's a master storyteller. The most entertaining talker I've ever heard. So I don't much care about the quality of the movie (which to be clear sucked) because I love Kevin so much.

When Clerks 3 and Mallrats 2 comes out I hope he tours with them. I'll be there."
ViewAskewniverse,ffeear5,t3_esuh0z,1579844807.0,"Just came back from the Salt Lake City show and Jay was not there. Kevin said Jay had to take care of his kid. That was the only mention. But Kevin is SO damn entertaining I didn't much care. I'd pay to hear him talk anytime. And I have more than once.

He's a master storyteller. Hope you all have a great time."
