I still think carbs are the enemy, because they produce inflammation, which appears to be the root of most western diseases. From purely a weightloss perspective, my lowest weight was when I was eating high fat high protein keto, but my energy was shit and my hearing kept going out and other problems.

femalefashionadvice,fej0h9n,t1_feipc6s,1579152539.0,Fit and shoe type can make a tremendous difference here. A lot of female film stars of older eras were quite short but looked very glamorous in the long coats of the 1940s and 50s.
femalefashionadvice,feicvv6,t1_feia2c3,1579135551.0,"My long coats come to mid calf or longer. This is a personal preference - I have a very formal, ladylike style, and this is good length for corporate/business work. It is not everyone’s preference - in fact I rarely see that length here on the casual West Coast - but to me it looks most professional and most elegant and honestly the most adult. 

I notice the quality tends to be better on long coats, or at least they don’t seem sell long wool coats at a low price point. (I presume because it only tends to be older adult women who wear them.) That is another benefit I think - I can spot cheap wool coats a mile away.

However, the most important thing is it makes you feel amazing. If you feel powerful and strong in a long coat, go for it! If you feel silly and it makes you feel old fashioned and you know it’s going to just sit in your closet, get something else that fits your lifestyle. 

Another good length is two inches below the knee/the narrow point where your knee starts to curve in but before your leg curves out to start your calf. Kate Middleton has a ton of great wool coats if you want some inspiration."

I’m no doctor but it’s something about a high protein low carb diet makes you susceptible to kidney stones already, and then add in that most nuts have a lot of oxalate, which forms into kidney stones. Of course, spinach also has a lot of oxalate, so it might have been that, because we also eat a ton of spinach.

femalefashionadvice,fea7vrn,t1_fe9zwg9,1578945396.0,"1960s-style clothing cuts can be very flattering, which is loosely what the last 10 years or so style has been based on until quite recently. A boxy top of well-made fabric over a pair of smart, ankle length pants is a nice go-to outfit, or any outfit that showcases the arms and legs, which are usually leaner if you carry your weight in your mid-section.

The trick in this body shape is to find just the right *length* of your *tops*. There is a sweet spot on this body type where the bottom of the shirt hangs, and with boxy tops in particular it is essential to find that spot, otherwise the shirt just looks awkwardly oversized and not figure flattering. I don't have any photos to show you, but the bottom of the shirt should hit the spot on the hips where the hips (in silhouette) are at their maximum curving in to the waist, but before the waist flattens out or starts to expand again. (You are in essence hinting at a more hourglass shape.) You can play around with finding this spot in front of a mirror, with a slim pair of trousers and boxy tops of different lengths."

We’ve just been trained that eating fat = becoming fat, however for me the slimmest I have been in the last few years was when I tried keto - which is lots of fat (and protein) and very low carb. A lot of the keto community believes that it’s empty carbs that make you put on weight plus it gives you inflammation (which appears to be the root of a lot of western diseases), but with fat you get full and don’t eat as much.
