redsox,ffhswxa,t1_ffhibaa,1579952236.0,There is no reason to consider the feelings of a cheater at all. They probably only won in '18 because the Astros couldn't cheat against the Sox. Fuck Cora and all the other 2017 Astros.

PSVR,ffgu4tx,t1_ffg5pii,1579915119.0,Are you serious? If there is one thing I've never heard about RE7 it's that it lacks immersion. I have never played a game that was a terrifying as RE7. It's only like that in VR though. It doesn't matter that you use a DS4. You feel like you are in that creepy house.
billsimmons,fffhjq4,t1_fff4gfh,1579884102.0,Who cares? You take any 11 other NBA players with one of those guys and that team isn't going 10-34.
billsimmons,fffgfiu,t1_ffeg8ka,1579883407.0,Trae Young just isn't that good. He doesn't project to get much better either. The Hawks blew it. It will go down as one of the worst trades if all time. There's nothing won't with saying that. Young's empty stats on the worst real in the league aren't going to change that.
billsimmons,fffg2jg,t1_fff2b8x,1579883186.0,Getting stats on a terrible team is way easier. Other teams let Trae Young score because that know they can just go outscore the Hawks.
billsimmons,ffffuwz,t1_ffeg1wh,1579883055.0,You are completely delusional. Trae is way closer to Bowie than Hakeem. He is just an empty stat collector. Running your whole offense through one guy can be impressive if he is good enough for you to win. When you do it with someone like Trae Young you get the 2019-2020 Hawks. He is barely a net positive because his defense is so bad.
southpark,ffeyo72,t1_ffemqoz,1579870595.0,What's a fakeal and why would it cover your bum?
bostonceltics,ffet2g7,t1_ffenz04,1579864203.0,Great. He puts up empty stats on the worst team in the league. He is the worst defender in the whole league. He's just the James Harden of shitty teams. Terry Rozier could put up those stats if the team didn't care about winning games and ran everything through him. I'll pay attention to a Trae Young stat when his team can win more than 30% of it's games. No team with a starter in the all-star game should ever be 10-34.

That isn't the same as what Republicans have done. They have committed actual crimes. Stolen money. Given away classified secrets. It's not the same. It is disingenuous to even suggest the parties are close to being similar at all. The fact is that if Trump was a Democrat, Democrats would have already voted to remove him."

politics,ffd698g,t1_ffd08yw,1579814233.0,There was no guarantee that they would get that money back. That money wasn't given as an investment.

That are all bad people, or they wouldn't have destroyed the lives of so many others in search of a bigger pile of money they won't spend. 

I wouldn't have any issue with a wealth cap. You can have as much money as you want, but you lose all societal protections. Either give back enough to get under the cap or leave the country and never do business with Americans or American companies. If they kept their billion, it would be completely legal to do what ever anyone wants to them or their stuff. Basically the Purge for billionaires. Except regular citizens are still protected by the government. So billionaires who try to defend their hoard or themselves by harming citizens would be fully prosecuted and have their assets stripped completely."

todayilearned,ffcoh4h,t1_ffcd688,1579803819.0,"The only problem with using the technically correct terms is that people are resistant to unfamiliar things. I don't see any problem with calling plant milks ""________ milk"". It's not inferior to cow milk, it's just different. Calling is almond milk instantly let's you know it's made out of almonds and is a milk substitute. As long as it clearly says what it is, I don't see the problem with allowing frozen dairy dessert being called ice cream. Just make them list percentage of butter fat."

nba,ffa56xq,t1_ff9pkgp,1579728107.0,Because the league isn't full of Luc Longleys and Greg ostertags coming in just to foul Shaq. What the fuck would the Celtics do? Shaq would score 100 against a team with Kanter and Bob Bill as their only centers.
nba,ffa4pit,t1_ff90zz4,1579727834.0,The league would get different players. Guys like Hibbert would be back in the league. Teams literally just had to collect big stiffs to foul Shaq and get in his way. He changed the way other teams built their roster.

todayilearned,ff699kj,t1_ff4x2ij,1579622123.0,Bullshit. No one scores as much today as Gretzky did. There is no reason to believe he wouldn't dominate if he played now. He might only be the best by a small margin instead of a huge one because the overall talent level has increased. There is no way it has increased enough that he wouldn't still be the best player. He was so far above his peers that he is a statistical outlier.
