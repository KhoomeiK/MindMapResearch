 One time he handed me his card and told me not to give it to him under any circumstances.

I don't think any Mario game before or after has evoked such different emotions so perfectly through art and music. Sunshine was really good atmospherically, but it was mainly just happy-go-lucky island atmosphere whereas 64 went from happy-go-lucky in Bob-ombs battlefield and Whomps Fortress to lonely hopelessness in Jolly Rodger Bay to fear inducing and creepiness in Big Boo's Haunt to mysterious and curiosity in that oil puddle level in the basement and that's just some of the jumps in atmosphere that it makes and it does them all so well.

By the time she got an N64 is pretty much as far back as my memory goes (although there is footage of me beating that mine cart level on Donkey Kong when I was super young). Not only does it give me extreme nostalgia from my real life, but it's also just an amazing game all around. The atmosphere, the music, the enemies and levels.
