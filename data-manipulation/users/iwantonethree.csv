loseit,fegmi8t,t1_feg2g6t,1579097256.0,Why thank you! :-)
loseit,feg1sbz,t1_feg081d,1579073224.0,"I’m so sorry you feel that way / had that experience.  Maybe it is just the people I’ve worked with / trained / taught.  All I can say is this makes me very very sad :-( 
And of course I haven’t taught in every single country in the world .  
But seriously - in my experience this has never happened . I train / teach trainers every day. It’s my job. I’m horrified and sad by hearing these things.
I’m not for a second disbelieving you.... just so sad and ashamed it’s happening.
And so hoping it’s not affecting anyone’s determination and commitment ."
loseit,fefzhck,t1_fefxsrv,1579070579.0,Ok maybe ‘good people’ was not the right expression.  ‘People genuinely keen on helping others improve their health and fitness ‘ would have been better. And I stand by that percentage
loseit,fefu8cr,t3_eoszga,1579065361.0,"She’s not a personal trainer she’s a group fitness instructor (if that) and ... I’ve worked in the fitness industry for 150 million years (feels like some days lol) in several different countries and have NEVER , EVER, come across anyone who has done something like that. 
It is absolutely shocking.
What I’m saying here is.... this person (if it’s true) is a unicorn .  99.999% of people working in the fitness industry are good people who want to help.
PLEASE PLEASE don’t let this stop you in your commitment to Better health and fitness .
You’re better than her."
relationship_advice,fedxcmf,t3_eojv2w,1579021882.0,"Erm.  I am a mum and ‘normal mum stuff’ when my daughter has a sore throat is making her tea with lemons and honey, and stroking her hair, and deciding if maybe she needs to go to doctor, checking on her every half hour or so, or even lying on her bed with her for comfort."
loseit,fe4jypf,t1_fe2lzw7,1578860143.0,"Exercise in and of itself is pretty ineffective for weight loss (Personal trainer here)... you can’t outrun your fork.
It is hugely beneficial from a health perspective, but it seems to me the immediate goal is fat loss, and to achieve that the emphasis needs to be on your diet.  It’s fine to focus on that for now and let exercise happen naturally later.
May I ask why surgery is not an option?  It seems to me you would be a prime candidate."
AmItheAsshole,fdtok5y,t3_emy819,1578719786.0,Of course you’re NTA.  You know this
newzealand,fdto02i,t3_emw7n5,1578719549.0,Everything I ever want on amazon doesn’t ship to New Zealand
AmItheAsshole,fdtmksq,t3_emv42p,1578718944.0,"NTA.   Mother of 7 here (all kids so so so different).  We helped most of them into cars (some bought their own).  I’d be SO PROUD if one of our kids came to us and said what you’ve said.  Had done the numbers and worked it out.  So proud.
I’d say ‘that one is going places’ !!"
offmychest,fdll9mq,t1_fdlfhsi,1578526569.0,Thank you so much x
