The other thing I keep in mind is anti-vax beliefs are kind of like religion to these people. Evidence and science are irrelevant to them. It’s all about belief systems and being a part of that community with a sprinkling of getting a kick out of thinking they’re more clever than the educated people. 

The hardest part of engaging with them, for me, is keeping my own emotional response in check."

australia,ff2o0m6,t1_ff2khl0,1579515676.0,I was caught on King Edward Terrace with my young kids in the car and it was terrifying. The little one was hysterical. The sound of those hailstones hitting the windscreen was insane. We couldn’t see out because the leaves from the tree we were under absolutely blanketed the car.  Once it finished the road was a 30-40cm river of ice and leaves. So so glad it hit when we were in the car. Two minutes earlier and it could have killed one of the kids. I know I sound like I’m being melodramatic when I say that but that’s how it was.

People are donating whatever they can including offers to go and get people with no transportation or horses or whatever. Our local supermarket is sold out of water and the shelves were emptying fast last night.
