chicago,ffyxda2,t1_ffywn9x,1580357549.0,"Pretty much all of the Republican candidates I've read about hold positions where they disagree with things the majority of the population wants. Along with being usually highly religious and carrying the prejudices that come along with that grouping.  They usually hold personal opinion over scientific fact and as a whole are seemingly morally corrupt or outright ignorant. There are so many politicians like this that it's hard not to group the whole of the Republican party along these lines. Around 90% of Republicans support Trump and the decisions he's made. Republican politicians are no different. They truly are seperate from Democrats. Obviously there are normal, good people running as small-time republicans. But as a whole, higher tier republicans do not put forth policy that helps their constituents. They are worse on people as a whole than Democrats are."

aww,ffxiq24,t1_ffxgv7p,1580325947.0,"If enough people said third lemon and people understood it then yeah it would make sense and be a correct way to say it. It'd probably be a joke though, just like saying fifth wheel when you could just say third wheel. And it refers to any 2 wheeled device that doesn't require a third wheel to work. So yeah if you're for some reason specifically referring to a motorcycle it wouldn't make a difference. Saying fifth wheel when it's not really used anymore is just as silly lol. It'd be like saying righteous and being serious about it. It's just not regular anymore. You can do it, it just doesn't make sense to seriously argue everyone should be doing it too."
aww,ffxg8av,t1_ffxfepo,1580324519.0,It really isn't to everyone else though. I think you're being sensitive about something that doesn't really matter and has no bearing on anyone. A third wheel can also be used to refer to 2 wheeled things. Thanks for letting us know the original term though. It's just colloquially outdated and it's erroneous to argue so hardcore about it. It's kinda sad. Language is ever changing and this is something that's changed.

It's going to take more than 50+ years it's been since lawful equality to reach true equality. Black people don't have the same economic opportunities and that's a fact.

Anyone white born in the last few hundred years was given the privilege they have in life. They've been on top for the last thousand years while blacks have been slaves for 500+. Whites are on top of society, they haven't really had to crawl. Racial pride is a negative, but taking pride in being the dominant color is kinda weird and definitely supremacists of anything. It's one thing to be prideful for escaping poverty, it's another to be prideful of something you did nothing to get. But you don't think about that or you wouldn't think as you do anyways.
