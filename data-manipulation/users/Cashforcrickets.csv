Bolt actions OR DMRs on Erangel and Vikindi. 

Sanhock and Karaken I prefer bolts for 1 hit kills. 

Basically if it's close enough that you can headshot people without them dodging it, go bolt. If your shooting 250+ every fight....DMR will do better. Also I like to run DMR as primary with a bolt as long range."

WTF,ff56uai,t1_ff524uy,1579581912.0,"I think Hulk and Snow White were sharing a room on the 3rd floor. Things got tense over Hulk's snoring and Snow White here, lost her shit and threw her ice chips at him. After some heated debate, they realized how much of themselves they saw in the other person. They scooted their beds closer and took a selfie.

During a rerun of Friends, Snow White asked him what his favorite toy growing up was. Hulk said, ""Scooby Doo"" cuz hes kinda fucking retarded and didn't understand the question. They held hands as Rachel completely dicked over my mans Ross. Hulk became visibly upset that Rachel did not reciprocate Ross's feelings and he yelled, ""Hulk Smash!""

Sleeping Beauty here took that as a challenge and gave the ole green weenie a slobbing. Everything was going well till Banner here bent her over to give her his purple headed fanny canon. Her health deteriorated with every pump and within seconds, she was comatose and pregnant.

Hulk is just checking in on her on his way to get some BBQ Lays out of the vending machine."

worldnews,fd2ki5g,t1_fd2gycs,1578148525.0,"So I'll play the devils advocate here...couple things in your post:

1. Your post makes it sound like AFTER the drone attacks, Iraqis began chanting ""death to America"". However, they were chanting that the week prior and during the embassy attack. 
2. Let's not pretend it was a peaceful protest at the embassy. Let's just not friend. Have you seen the footage? Lives were not lost because troops arrived in time. Rest assured it was very scary for those inside the embassy. 
3. Iran and US has had many skirmishes before. This is not the first time, nor the last. Iran has committed several offenses too. This is an escalation for sure though. 
4. Trump tweeted in 2018 that he was through fucking around with Iran. They are a terror sponsoring nation and NOT an ally to US.  That fact NEEDS to sink in. Their government PAYS for terrorist militias to conduct jihad and other military operations. If you want to discuss whether we should be involved at all...that's a different discussion.
5. I, for one, am proud that we have a president that gives two flying fucks about American lives. You kill one of ours, we will slaughter 100. Fk it. Keep that in mind. He is setting policy around the world. It was becoming normal to ""attack American embassies. I love the message it sent: We can reach you anytime, anywhere.
6. The fucking general he killed is a terrorist. He's being made out to sound like a peaceful, courageous, general....when in reality, the world is a better place without him. Its fucking sickening how anyone can defend killing this monster. 
7. Who knows what actual information the administration possessed on this general. It appears it's possible that he was in the middle of planning an attack and this was a ""2 birds 1 stone"" kind of situation."
