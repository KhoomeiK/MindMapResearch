movies,ffhwd75,t3_ethiof,1579956879.0,Randy Newman score did not even remotely fit the tone of Marriage Story. Super jarring for me. It was like watching an intense drama with 90’s romcom transitions.
Equestrian,ffg5pxa,t3_ete4bn,1579899022.0,Congratulations!!
Horses,fffgo6s,t3_etam70,1579883558.0,Way to brush it off and stay on :)
aww,fff56mv,t3_et5pja,1579875984.0,"Legitimate question, I know I’m gonna get downvoted. How do we know the elephant is being hurt? I use a dressage whip on my horse, and I have never, ever come close to hurting him, nor would I. It’s an extension of my leg aid. The most i ever give is a tiny tap that either reinforces my leg if he didn’t “listen” to it, reminds him to engage a certain muscle to help him move better, or ask him to move forward (again if he didn’t listen to my leg first). I’m not saying I know for a fact the elephant isn’t being tortured or harmed, but how can we be so sure just from this clip?"

entertainment,ffb7iwm,t1_ffap26y,1579753982.0,"I laughed when I read your comment because I say that constantly about one of my cats. She’s dumb as a bag of rocks but I do love her. I love my horse too, but I genuinely think horses are not as smart as dogs or pigs in many ways. Sometimes I observe our horses and I’m just like... i love you but how are you still alive??"
Horses,ff96fxn,t3_es9lig,1579705954.0,:’( glad you shared a beautiful relationship.
Horses,ff92b1z,t1_ff7pjmt,1579703095.0,Thank you :). I’ve had it shaved for 3 years and I still love it.

news,ff37id5,t1_ff328tf,1579535535.0,"Yeah, that’s all true, but I don’t see that risk as any higher than what humans put themselves through by enjoying a sport. If you’re active, you’re gonna have some wear and tear. In my experience, if horses are well cared for, they have happier lives if they have a purpose and a goal, and are exercised. It’s certainly significantly better for them than sitting in a field all their life, or being feral."
news,ff30f4c,t1_ff2ankv,1579530314.0,"Amateur equestrian here (i have a horse and my sport is eventing). I don’t know much about racing, but Santa Anita is horrifying to me. But i strongly disagree that “any horse sport in general” is “extremely dangerous for the animal.” What makes you say that?

Edit; I’ll add, I’ve seen minor bumps and bruises to horse and rider, but I’ve personally never in my entire life seen a horse have to be put down as a result of an injury from my sport. And it’s one of the more risky equestrian sports."

wholesomememes,ff1zk3w,t3_er27i7,1579489863.0,"I’m a woman. I grew up with two brothers who constantly told me my voice was too high and grating and I needed to shut up. It definitely helped condition me to not speak up for myself. Today I told my twin brother (I’m 31) that someone said something sexist to me and it upset me - I was filling out forms for a new job and the HR guy kept saying I should ask my father for financial advice, “or maybe your husband.” My brother’s response was, “women are so much more insecure than men.”"
wholesomememes,fewf38u,t1_fewdta2,1579409532.0,"I’m sorry, I would need a lot more information to understand. But i will say, the two biggest things that make my marriage unshakeable are 1)vulnerability (which is both facilitated by and results in good communication, which can solve almost any problem) and 2)putting the marriage first. We both have super ambitious careers and we support each other like crazy, but that can make it hard to humble ourselves and put our egos aside in order to prioritize the marriage. But we made a commitment to do so no matter what. I wake up happier every day knowing I still get to be married to my husband. (i think maybe I just got the best one.)"
wholesomememes,fev30c1,t1_fev18l0,1579392585.0,That’s horrible. I promise there are good men out there who will love you and your body.

aww,feruce2,t1_fenz08k,1579358443.0,"Anecdotal but... my best friend growing up had a Russian blue who liked to sleep on my chest during sleepovers and I wouldn’t be able to sleep because I was terribly allergic to her :(. Sorry, Midnight. I eventually got allergy shots as an adult and now have 2 kitties of my own.

Edit: I guess my allergies were severe, though."
