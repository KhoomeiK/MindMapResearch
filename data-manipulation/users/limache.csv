So if my experience is true, then people shouldn’t be disconnecting. 

I can’t tell if the AI is actually more difficult than people because some of the trades I can get sometimes are stupid and i could only imagine a human going for it. 

Doesn’t the AI calculate the total value of a trade? 

For example, sometimes I would be able to trade 2 greens that are mortgaged for 2 unmortgaged pinks AND I have the remaining pink, giving me a monopoly while the other guy would have to pay even more just to get his 2 greens unmortgaged and he doesn’t have the third green while I can build 9 houses immediately on pink."

Sounds like your brother is also very young or not bright if he keeps selling out. 

Expensive properties are overvalued. Reds are the highest I’ll go - yellow and after I don’t want. Too expensive to build.
