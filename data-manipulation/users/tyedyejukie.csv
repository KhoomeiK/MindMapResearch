My husband and I have stacks of old $1, and $2 Bill's saving for our future children and current nieces and nephews. Husband lovveeesss quarters. I mainly collect everything I get that's out of country, and gold $1 coins, and I'm greedy with silver quarters. 
It may be strange, but we enjoy it. We also have regulars that share the joy in the little things, who also bring us their own stashes. I've done many a trade!"

AskReddit,ferx16e,t1_ferok43,1579359213.0,"Oh it was. I mean I always knew he was crazy, we broke up because he started getting violent, and the last straw for me was that he shoved my elderly mom into the wall.
I see the guys sisters all the time and were still in good blood, I didnt expect that but i think at some point they knew he was gonna do something horrendous. Just glad none of us got hurt. Really opened my eyes though."

AskReddit,fernspd,t3_eqgcg7,1579356244.0,"At the time, me and said guy were broke up, but were trying to make amends. 
Said he wanted to take me put one last time, after 3 weeks of being split and pretty much me not talking to him at all. Felt fishy to me, I kept saying no. 
A week or so later, my best friend agreed shed ride with me because I felt so weird about it. (Shed been friends with him for a few years by now and felt like I was being stubborn).
Fast forward to evening, he picks us up. 
That it was weird he didnt greet us as we entered the truck. He drove past the restaurant wed agreed to eat at, and things went down hill fast. My best friend kicks the back of my seat and I turn around and she shows me a message on her phone that says ""amber, hes got the child locks on, I cant open my door.""
I calmly asked ""hey where are we going? I thought we were gonna eat at Nicks"" 
I felt like I was gonna vomit when he looked at me and smiled and told me ""dont worry, I'm gonna take care of you. And her ""
At this point I'm terrified, hes getting further and further from my neighborhood in a direction I dont know. It's getting dark and I'm starting to not be able to tell where we are. I'm starting to panic, and I can hear my friend try to open the door again. 
At this point, said guy is driving with this huge smirk on his face, and my friend calmly asked him ""hey man, is there a reason child locks on?"" No response.. he just chuckles. My friend lights a cigarette a d realizes he has window locks on too. 
""Bro, really, wtf! Can you atleast roll down the windows for us, I can't breathe with her smoking in here""
Thank god my brain was functioning. As soon as he rolled down the window enough, I popped my arm through and grabbed the door handle from the outside as he was trying to roll my arm up in the window. I barely got it out in time, hopped put, flung my friends door open, and we just started hauling ass. 
Were running, just running for our lives, next to a field, until finally I see headlights. We can hear my exs truck getting closer and him screaming my name. 
The headlights are on us, and I'm petrified its him. My friend grabs me, ""come on! Its Will!""(her boyfriend at the time, who'd shed already texted and was hauling ass our way to save us)
Will couldnt even stop the truck, we had to just run and jump in because crazy ass mother fucker was behind him. We got into the truck and will os already on the phone with 911. Crazy ass is trying to push us off the road. 
All I could think was ""if he gets to us, hes gonna kill yall and take me and no one will ever see any of us again""
After what seemed like years, and after losing him on the road, I get a call from a detective. Saying they had him in custody and he was claiming I had stolen something from him and he wanted it back. I met up with the detective and explained everything, my bestie backing up my every word. The detective sighed heavily,and looked at us, ""I'm glad you girls got out of that truck."" My friend and I both looked at one another and she grabbed my hand, ""we are too"" 
Detective walked us over to his patrol car and opened the passenger door. On the seat was a lock box popped open. Inside: rolls of duct tape, swat grade zip ties, candles, a few leather bdsm looking materials (I dont wanna dive real deep into that it still gives me nightmares), a hunters knife, a .22 pistol, a sex tape, and a couple sex toys. 
Detective- ""we have him in custody, hes on his way to a trip in pysc. He willing admitted to pick you and your friend up with the intention of kidnapping you. With permission, were gonna place a protective order against him for the both of you. And I hope you seek charges."" 
Oh trust me, I did. 
He just got out in January on probation and I have a 6 year protective order in place. From what I hear, as soon as he can, hes moving out of state. So thank god for my friend, her boyfriend, and the detectives. I may not be here otherwise"

Advice,fek9853,t3_epmae6,1579195241.0,"Tell her, or continue your relationship harboring a lie. No growth comes from that. Can you imagine if yall get married, and have kids, and she finds out. 
I went 9 months engaged to a guy who'd cheated on me twice and his best friend finally told me 3 weeks before our wedding. 
Take my advice, tell her. And if she has the grace in her heart to forgive you and move forward FIX YOUR SHIT DUDE."
AskReddit,fek51r2,t3_eplkl3,1579192762.0,"My apartment isnt haunted, but my store is!
I work at a Circle k in texas, and the lot next to us is a cemetery. It's been there since the 60s.
My cooler door will open at random. And this past week my front doors, both of them, have been opening and slamming shut while no one is here. 
My coffee machines will make coffee out of no where. My chip bags get knocked down, cups get thrown on the floor. My registers will shut down one by one at 3 am atleast 1 or 2 times a month, and IT can NOT explain it. We hear foot steps all the time, mostly overnight. The first 2 weeks I started, I had my pony tail yanked 3 times. I thought I was crazy so I didnt say anything until my assitant saw it happen. 
One other thing that sticks out in my mind is that one night I was watching footage for my back diesel cams and a large white mist appeared at the pump and the buttons on the pumps started reacting. As if someone was actually there trying to fuel up. 
My overnight guy got the piss scared out of him NYE and called me at 2 am because he was convinced someone was in the walk in giggling and breaking 6 packs glass bottles. I viewed cameras next morning to see if he was just making shit up for breaking my product but he was at my registers when it happened. Unfortunately i have no audio in there so I couldnt catch the giggling. I watch cameras every monday and almost 90% of the time I run audio at my registers I can hear voices behind my audio. Many voices. My store has been here since 89, and every single person that has worked here or is working here, has a story. Original manger has a picture of a full body apparition on her phone via our servalince cams. I dont think itll ever stop. 
We mostly just ignore it, or tell them to piss off and let us work."

I dont think I even learned that fun fact til I was 19.

I have employer insurance, and the only thing I get ""free"" is my birth control. ONLY because I pay an extra 10 a month for what they call ""women's wellness"" package. No insurance? That shit costs me 120 USD out the door. 

Dont even get me started with the ""in network"" providers either .."
