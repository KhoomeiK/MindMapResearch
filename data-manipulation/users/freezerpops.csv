aww,ffhafvx,t3_etdw25,1579927867.0,What a beauty! [This is my Apollo](https://imgur.com/a/EIipsg7)
popping,ffcvea3,t1_ffcg5vq,1579808057.0,You gotta use a skin prep (liquid plastic film) to help them stick sometimes and give yourself plenty of room around it. I was so excited when my tattoo artist brought it out as I’m a wound care nurse and work with transparent dressings all the time with vacs and for autolytic debridement. I’m getting my hand done today and brainstorming how to maintain a seal while it heals.
Art,ffck7ii,t1_ffcf354,1579801214.0,Yes! Dance Macabre is great for cardio
AskReddit,ffck1yj,t1_ffc9hks,1579801122.0,"It is sometimes very helpful to have a specific piece to show, as long as you understand that things will need to be tweaked to look good on skin. Can save the artist a lot of back and forth with ‘oh I want flowers, no, not those, no, not there, make them smaller etc etc’.  I usually show up with at least a rough sketch if not a full piece to my consults."
food,ff6hmkb,t3_erxfbm,1579627389.0,Wow! Recipe?
snakes,ff33opv,t3_ere33l,1579532873.0,Beautiful! Was this found in the wild? I don’t see an albino surviving well...
AskReddit,fev3qbz,t1_fetzwh0,1579392760.0,Yeah we had a sex worker who frequently came in with STDs (STIs I guess) in her colostomy because of this. I make a point to educate all of my ostomy pts that it’s a one way street unless you’re managing your BMs with irrigation.
Aquariums,fefpthj,t3_eosy3o,1579061802.0,Ropefish are social fish and love buddies if you can pick up more!
Aquariums,fefph6q,t3_eoqdx0,1579061552.0,I might be tired but the perspective of this pic really fucked with me for a few minutes. Cute little bristlenose!
1200isplenty,fdsgu2c,t1_fds8pef,1578702465.0,It’s seriously so satisfying. Try making yours with broth instead of milk and throw some extra seasonings in; it can take a lot of flavor!
1200isplenty,fdsgqxk,t1_fdqzp1d,1578702415.0,"Just regular Quaker Oats, I prefer the old fashioned over the quick cooking because it retains more texture IMO."
1200isplenty,fdsgnkq,t1_fdr8ij4,1578702363.0,"Depends on what flavor I’m going for. This is quesadilla cheese, I also often use a cheddar mix, or Parmesan if I’m mixing a little pumpkin in it (I skip the salsa then)."
1200isplenty,fdqkmhh,t1_fdqjjvy,1578668947.0,"Thanks! I cook with with vegetable broth instead of milk, toss in some garlic, onion, cumin and chipotle powder. It’s my favorite quick, cheap dinner since my husband has become vegetarian."
DessertPorn,fdofxeo,t3_emc334,1578604341.0,Yeah you’re gonna need to drop the recipe! That looks awesome
todayilearned,fdijqsn,t1_fdhyd62,1578444458.0,"That’s horrifying. That poor woman, I hope she is safe."

aww,fd26ewb,t1_fd1qduf,1578142412.0,"One of my cats, our most beautiful idiot, will steal broccoli right out of your hand. Carrots he’s ok with, green beans are always a thrill, edamame husks are the ultimate snack. He can’t have edamame husks though; he accidentally got into some once and when he pooped them out. Dear god. The mess."
UpliftingNews,fcxk8bj,t1_fcxitn9,1578064965.0,"The energy isn’t the problem for me, more the problem solving and work drive. We picked out an oaf of a pit/boxer mix whom we love but isn’t going to win any Nobel prizes haha. Then a few months later a little cattle dog who is high energy but seems stimulated by an intense game of fetch and a little training. They both get walked 2-6 miles most days of the week, with a 30 minute fetch/tug of war session, plus a big backyard and tons of toys. I just can’t imagine having a dog any other way. I knew so many people growing up who kept their dogs in the yard because they were ‘crazy’ but never walked them, played, or anything to wear them out."
UpliftingNews,fcxdgnm,t1_fcwo3my,1578059975.0,"People like the idea of a certain breed without actually being willing to deal with it. My neighbors got a second HUSKY that they leave outside, all summer, in the Kansas heat. They’ve escaped several times and I spent an hour last month corralling them back to their yard while their lazy ass owner wouldn’t answer the door as I knocked. I even jerry rigged the fence so they couldn’t push it open. Never walk them. 


When we picked out our mutts from the humane society I specifically avoided breeds that I know I just can’t care for. Met a really sweet German Shepard with separation anxiety and I had to be realistic that a nervous, super smart dog isn’t a good choice for our family."
