depression,fd920f7,t3_ekbw1d,1578227116.0,So there is a possibility I'll die soon. Great!
depression,fd91dfz,t3_eka9gy,1578226765.0,"It is, for me. I don't want someone to be unhappy because of me. They could be in a beautiful, healthy relationship, and instead they see how unhappy and negative I am and it sucks out their energy.

I'd feel like a dementor in a relationship."
depression,fd50mej,t1_fd4ctf8,1578172991.0,"Don't call him/her selfish. It's rude and insensitive. You don't know what's happening in her/his life. If you think people who commit suicide are selfish, then you're completely wrong. I bet you've never experienced (serious) depression before, otherwise you wouldn't call them selfish."
depression,fd1y3bl,t3_eju58r,1578138626.0,"People who say that don't know what's it like to have depression. They're probably happy with their lives, and can't even imagine that pain. 

You described my feelings perfectly: ""My body is a prison and I want to be set free."""
depression,fcykmgz,t3_ej8kzv,1578081725.0,And I don't want to live.
depression,fcyhdya,t3_ejj0uk,1578080174.0,"I am soo ugly. I heard people saying it.
And I remember my cousin calling me ""ugly Betty"" when I was younger."
depression,fcyg2wu,t3_ejihcy,1578079607.0,"1. Happiness, I guess...? I don't know, I've never been in a relationship and I don't miss it, tbh. Even if I was in love, I'd rather stay alone, cause I don't wanna hurt someone with my depressive behavior.

2. I don't know, since I've never had any friends, if I had at least one true best friend, I'd be happier. 

3. People think they make you feel better. Doesn't work for me. Well, maybe watching TV."
depression,fcvynh5,t3_ej6q71,1578013097.0,It's a sign! Don't do it.
depression,fcsnj51,t3_eiow89,1577920435.0,Do you know what helps me when I feel down? Watching Friends. Try it.
depression,fcsmp5f,t3_eikx42,1577919842.0,"I really hate ''it's all in your head"", because it's not true. It's real. Why should I lie to myself, if I know it's real?

I'm unwanted, too and it's not just my imagination. I can see people avoiding me."
depression,fcslo2h,t3_eil325,1577919165.0,"Now I feel a little guilty for being depressed. I was born into a loving family, but it wasn't perfect (I was abused by my brother, my parents don't know how to help me with my problems and don't understand depression). Plus, I'm not intelligent, not even an average looking person (I'm so ugly), so I can forget about having a successful life. 

I know a lot of people have worse problems, and I wish them nothing, but happiness."
depression,fcskbo8,t3_eikmur,1577918297.0,"Me. I am so ugly, it hurts."
depression,fcqla1s,t1_fcqegnl,1577888005.0,"Yeah, I feel terrible even without having these kind of dreams and I feel completely lifeless today, or more like sad, tired, angry and annoyed by everything.

I hope you find a best friend soon."
depression,fcof74p,t3_ei7i25,1577830772.0,"I wanna escape the pain, but if they told me I'm dying, I wouldn't mind at all."
depression,fclnyw2,t1_fclkeaz,1577752271.0,"Exactly. I don't trust anyone, cause I think I'm boring and uninteresting and tbh, I know it's true. I am.

Everyone says ""you have to love yourself first"". Well, how am I supposed to love myself? There's nothing good about me. I hate myself and I understand why no one wants to be friends with me."
depression,fcldie0,t1_fcl9qr4,1577745290.0,"While I think hiding it is not the best thing, I still think it's better. I don't hide it and then I come off as rude, or uninterested, which is not true. It's just the way I am. Fear controls me.

I have serious trust issues as well and I can't stop it. I fear the day when someone shows genuine interest in me (doubt it) and I won't believe her/him, cause I always think people wanna use me, or make fun of me, or whatever.

This person I had a crush on didn't care about me much, but the fact that I was seriously depressed (I had tears in my eyes) due to my problems and that I was kinda in love, made me forget about hatered of hughs. I had a weak moment."
depression,fcl864f,t1_fckz04u,1577741894.0,"Well, I think that not knowing how to hide it is worse, because you can feel that negative energy from them. 
It's not attactive. 

You're right. I dream about having a close best friend with whom I'll be comfortable to hug, share my thoughts, feelings and stuff. You know, like those fictional best friendships (like Monica and Rachel in Friends), but I think that friendships like this are rare and I'm not a lucky person.

It depends on who hugs you. Someone who I had a crush on, hugged me 2 times and it felt good, actually, and we were just classmates. But otherwise I hate when people hug me, even my parents (and we've always had a good relationship with each other)."
depression,fcky1e5,t1_fckvq3q,1577735636.0,"I'm so weak that I can't even hide my shyness and depression.

I do have a loving family. Good parents and brothers, but they can't help me with my problems.

I've been hugged 4 times, and I didn't like it. I've never liked hugs and I try to avoid them. And I personally haven't hugged anyone first and I don't think I ever will."
depression,fckv66u,t3_ehpfnk,1577733882.0,"I've been holding my problems, feelings, thoughts in myself my WHOLE LIFE, since I'm shy and quiet, I've never had any friends, not even fake ones (which is good), so I don't share anything with anybody. Imagine that feeling. So many thoughts thoughts in your head."
socialanxiety,fcilbmm,t3_ehck1h,1577664483.0,"Hey, I'm 21[F], my favorite shows are Friends, Two and a Half Men, Spongebob and many others. I enjoy watching TV and playing video games. And I've never had any friends, cause I'm super shy and quiet. Nice to meet you."
depression,fcicqpl,t3_ehao8c,1577660614.0,"I remember when I had my first panic attack. It was embarrassing, when I think about it now. I was panicking, cause I thought I was gonna die and I wasn't alone in the room."
depression,fci9bpl,t3_eh871d,1577659323.0,"I remember when I got PS1. I was 6 and so happy. I played it with my cousins all the time. 2 years later my younger brother broke it. 

And then, after 15 years, I bought PS4 and my childhood memories arrived. After all those years, I have PS again. And now, I'm playing it with my younger brother who broke the PS1."
depression,fci7imw,t1_fcdgsvq,1577658668.0,"I think they regret it, too."
depression,fcacla4,t1_fca9in6,1577566803.0,"I forgot to say that the therapist will not help me with my problems. It's impossible to get rid of these problems. And when I mean impossible, I mean literally impossible. That means, it's impossible to not feeling depressed. These problems are the main reason I wanna kill myself. And since they'll never disappear, I'll never be happier.

No chance."
depression,fc9z5xm,t3_egrb98,1577560389.0,"Well, I'm not a touchy person, tbh. I don't like when someone touches me. I don't like hugs, holding hands, or whatever. 

So there's no way I'll get addicted to physical contact."
socialanxiety,fc9jvcw,t3_egqvil,1577553741.0,"No, I am not good looking. I'm extremely ugly and unattractive. There are people who said I'm ugly, but no one said that I'm pretty. Now I'm sure they're right. No one has ever been interested in me.

As they say: ""Everything happens for a reason"", and in this case, ugliness is the reason."
depression,fc95jr0,t1_fc92a1t,1577547382.0,Yes.
