PublicFreakout,fghtxza,t3_eydoj5,1580793777.0,"Beginnings are so powerful. These kids are really lucky that they got checked by an adult with a good sense of proportion. He made them take a step back after that initial transgression across the line, and he did it with seriousness but also compassion. Together, that conveys respect. And even better he redirected them towards cleaning up their own yard. This is wisdom, this is gold. Those kids now have a crucial sense of reverence and purpose that they never would obtained had they been caught the following year [throwing rocks at cars from an overpass.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtBTKM8T984) Those are good kids, and these are good men who just made a positive impression when it counts, at the beginning of those kids' natural explorations to test [their place in society, and thus their self-worth.](https://goldcountrymedia.com/news/149796/roseville-children-hailed-as-heroes/) Bravo!"

This is what most people think, even scientists. That's the secret to finding what's right in front us, that nobody is paying attention to. Don't get mad, revel in the beauty and the power of your own ability to see and imagine and work out what's going on all around us in the world and beyond. It's fun, even if people don't believe you! Fuck 'em."

>A [forklift driver was cruising down an aisle in a warehouse in Shropshire, England](https://97x.com/forklift-accident-causes-entire-warehouse-to-collapse/) when he bumped into one of the shelves. Moments after, the shelf collapsed on top of the forklift and caused a domino effect.
In just seconds, nearly every shelf in the warehouse was brought down and the worker was caught underneath it all. Miraculously, he was uninjured. It took rescue teams nearly eight hours to dig through the thousands of tons of cheese stored in the warehouse, but they eventually pulled Tomasz Wiszniewski from the mess. They believe he was saved by staying in the forklift during the mayhem.

Advice,fdljf5h,t3_elxfy4,1578525346.0,"It sounds like a phase. A goofy phase. Be kind and patient, tell her how you feel after a while, in gentle moment. You and your sister will have long lives together, and how you treat her now when she's acting silly will go a long way toward how grateful she is toward you later, when she knows she was an ass and she feels embarrassed about it. She's working something out about her feminity, because she wants to be taken care of, protected. I've seen girly girls go through that when they are younger sometimes, act dumb and helpless, and some guys go for that just like dummies themselves. And I've seen, more than once, adults who really missed out on key a psychological phase in their youth — they make up for lost time and reenact it many years later in all the worst ways. Keep reminding her why you like her, and she'll begin to pull away from all the ways you don't, eventually. I'd say two years is the standard duration of a phase, and it'll being to change and change again as she discovers whatever she needs to experience in order to move on. And someday let her be there for you, patiently, while you go through a difficult phase."
