politics,fgm13jv,t1_fglv9pd,1580915774.0,"> The DNC has been dangling the potentiality of women losing their right to bodily autonomy since First acquiring it via Roe V Wade! If that’s the only thing the democrats can stand behind then we need a 3rd party that actually has progressive ideas

Yeah so you don't sound like a progressive at all, especially with this nasty ass comment. In fact, IMHO, you've pretty much just outed yourself as a troll pushing that favorite narrative of the Russians. 


You see, your view of the Dems here is a weirdly twisted mirror image. It's like a flat GOP strawman representation of the Dems, but with the perspective lazily reversed to make it an attack from the left. But, it reads more like you can barely hide your disdain for the concept of women's bodily autonomy at all, much less care for its protection in the first place. 


Secondly, the suspicious hint of ""do nothing""-i-ness in your second line's criticism and the baseless ""pro-choice is all they have"" claim presented as if it's news to you belies a certain unfamiliarity with the *fact* that while the Democratic Party overwhelmingly already shared major policy goals with the Sanders campaign, they then adopted more of his policies as a part of the official party platform in 2016 when he stepped down from the race and endorsed Clinton. 


Something a die-hard Bernie supporter would probably know. A Bernie supporter probably wouldn't criticize the Democratic Party - that advocates for a living wage, healthcare reform, protecting minority and voting rights, funding education, and passed 400 some odd bills in the House - as only caring about abortion.

But maybe I'm wrong.

They no longer made that suggestion with new hires.


The reason for this law became quite clear a few months later when a different new hire came in to work under me (I ran a dept at that point) and conversation went there and I found out this guy started out making more than me, after I'd even had a couple of raises and promotions over the years.

For example Skyrim's audio didn't work until adding a launch command that has it use xaudio2.7 or something. Check ProtonDB and they'll have whatever you need to get a game working if anybody has done it. Only a handful of mine don't run.
