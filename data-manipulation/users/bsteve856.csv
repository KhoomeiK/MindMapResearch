MurderedByWords,ffe9ucw,t1_ffe5ltt,1579840704.0,"> You act as if people who are both working don’t deserve to benefit from that with both incomes. That they should not have more money coming in vs a single income family. That’s just...absurd. It’s punishing people who would choose to both work instead.

No.  That is not what I am saying.

My view is that people should be free to work for whatever price they want, and the employer could pay them whatever they want.  Workers and the employer can come up with any wage number that makes sense to them.  That is just free market.  Just like with any service or product, the market determines the wage.

The problem is that there are situations where the market price of the work is extremely low.   The employers say ""hey, it makes no sense to me to pay you much,"" and the workers get into a situation where they think that even very little money is better than no money and are not able to support themselves and the family.  This is, of course, bad for the society, so in the 1930s, the government said, ""yes, Mr. employer, we understand that the market rate for that job is very low, too bad, so sad for you, we will nonetheless force you to give your worker a wage that we think he can support himself and his family."" 

Now, setting the wage above the market rates is not without its drawbacks.  There always are drawbacks when the government tries to interfere in the free market.  But, the government has figured that those costs of setting minimum wage above a free market wage are outweighed by its benefits: you don't want full-time workers to be a burden on society.

But suppose that the worker in addition to having a cashflow from employment has cashflow from inheritance or subsidies or whatever.  Then the government's argument that we need to force the employer to pay above market rates goes away.  

So it is with dual income families.  There is no reason to force the employers to pay both the man and the woman minimum wage, because the reasoning behind the minimum wage disappears.  As long as the income for the family, regardless where it comes from, supports the family, then who cares how much either of them get paid?"

MurderedByWords,ffdxqnd,t1_ffdqaj8,1579831546.0,"I am not sure if I am not communicating well and so you do not understand my point, or if I am not understanding your point.

Here is the issue.  Let me try to break this down.

(1)  It is in society's best interest that people are able to afford to live in housing and eat and do whatever normal people do.  We do not want to have people starving on the streets, or be a burden to the rest of society.  It makes sense to make sure that the family that the worker supports makes a sufficient amount of money to support his family based on his paycheck.  Thus, the minimum wage was passed. 

(2)   At the time that the minimum wage laws were passed in the 1930s, it was the norm for women to be employed until they got married, or until they started having kids.  It was expected that the entire family be supported on the man's wages.  Therefore, the minimum wage was set to assure that the man's wage was sufficient to cover the expenses of his family.

(3)  Let's suppose that we have the scenario where the woman stays at home, raising kids, and the husband is making the minimum wage which covers their expenses.  Everything is working smoothly as it should.  Let's say, though, that she decides to go to work.  The extra money that she is bringing in is going to be nice, will raise the family out of mere sustenance levels that her paycheck will provide, etc.  With her husband making the minimum wage how much should she be making?

(4)  Well, if he is already making minimum wage on which he supports the family at mere existance level, there is no logical reason within this framework why her wages should be as high as the minimum wage.  Remember, the entire reason for the 1930s minimum wage was to assure that a family can live on one income, so that we, as a society, do not need to carry the burden of the cost of taking care of those who work but cannot live on subminimum income.  So, under the minimum wage policy, a dual income family of the 1930s, could survive on 1.0 minimum wages.  

(5) But you correctly point out, your spouse's income should not effect of what you are getting paid.  There is a good reason for that: we do not people to people to be discriminated based on their sex or marital status.  

(6)  Because we, as a society, no longer wish to pursue the policy of sexual discrimination or marital status discrimination when it come to payment of wages, and we have minimum wages jobs, a dual-income family has an income of at least 2.0 minimum wages.

(7)  Because many families are dual income, and because minimum wage jobs are relatively rare, families are making much more money than minimum wage.  Therefore, there is little reason to raise the minimum wage to sustenance levels as was the idea in 1930s.

(8) One option, of course, is to say, OK, we'll give each worker sufficient amount of money to cover the bare essentials of your family, and make the employer pay the employee that, so that that family won't die on the street or be on societal dole, but if there is someone else in the family making money already, we'll subtract that amount from the worker's pay.  This solution, of course, sounds very unfair, and would never be politically accepted.  Thus, we have very low minimum wages.

I hope that I explained my position why minimum wages are no longer expected to cover the expenses of a single income family clearly enough."
MurderedByWords,ffdoudv,t1_ffdnarg,1579825463.0,">Minimum wage was intended to fully support yourself and family.

Yes, you are correct.  It was to protect the man's wages and to protect the well-being of the man's family.  

So let me ask you this: if someone wants to spend time working to supplement the wages that the primary breadwinner makes, should they be allowed to do so, and what should their wages be?  It makes no sense to have the supplemental family income be above the old minimum wage standard by using your logic."

I totally get that guards do wrong things.  Guard are only human and make mistakes.  Guards are often negligent.  Guards are often assholes, and take out their frustrations wrongfully on prisoners.  And some guards are doing malicious things to prisoners. 

I fully acknowledge that guards are capable of doing wrong things and they often do.  But that is NOT the issue.

The issue is this: if a guard does do a wrong thing, then what is the appropriate response?  What is it that we, as a society, think should happen to guards who do wrong things?  

Well, the appropriate response is to hold the guard responsible for his actions, and to punish him appropriately, whether it is to write him up, to lower his rank, to put him on unpaid leave, to fire him, to imprison him, etc.  And we should also hold the bosses of the guard responsible for letting that happen.

The appropriate response is exactly what you have provided a link to: there are judicial methods of dealing with wrongful actions of guards.

But what we do not want to do, is to let prisoners inflict violence on the guards.  Yes, I understand that a prisoner may feel hurt by the guard's actions and fully understand that the prisoner wants to exact revenge, but we cannot allow prisoners to physically attack a guard even though the guard is doing the wrong thing."

news,ffchp36,t3_esuqkc,1579799692.0,"I am sorry, but I have always had very little faith in the Doomsday Clock.  Yes, I've read the information from their website ( [https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/faq/](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/faq/) ), but it does not make things clear.

Firstly, it is totally unclear what the units (seconds, minutes, hours) measure.  Yes, I understand that this is a metaphorical clock (they could have used yards on a football field, or meters on a soccer pitch, or mL in a wine bottle), but how do you translate from the subjective measurement of how likely it is that ""how close we are to destroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making"" into these units?  What is the conversion factor between the likelihood of getting destroyed within the next year (or month or 10 year or whatever) to minutes of the Doomsday Clock?  If we say that the likelihood that we will destroy ourselves in 2020 is, hypothetically, 0.01%, how does that translate into minutes on the clock?  What is the conversion rate, or formula?  Is the metaphorical clock linear or logarithmic or some different scale?  Does the scale vary with time?  

Secondly, the measurements of the metaphorical clock is total non-sense.  During the 1950s, when the Soviets detonated their thermonuclear bombs, when the Soviets put Sputnik in space, when ICBMs were developed, people have stockpiled foods, built shelters in their backyards, governmental buildings had fallout shelters, the kids had duck-and-cover drills in schools, etc.  During the time of the Cuban Missle Crisis in Oct 1962, which was the closest that our civilization has ever gotten close to nuclear war, the Doomsday Clock was set at 7 minutes.  Today, when the only people who prepare for nuclear war by building shelters by burying school busses and hoarding 22 rifle rounds are considered ""crazies"" by the society at large, the clock is set at 100 seconds?  That is pure nonsense.  If the Cuban Missle Crisis was 7 minutes, and the mere installation of a phone line between the Whitehouse and Kremlin brought it to 12 minutes, then today we should be more like 20 hours from midnight."

The excellent state of the environment is something to be proud of.  The boomer generation and silent generation have drastically improved the environment.  It is unbelievable how much cleaner everything is now compared to 50 year ago.

Just compare how filthy the waterways, and air has been in the 1970s and earlier.  The horrific smog that has enveloped the planet has been effectively eliminated. The DDT that has almost wiped out the bald eagle population has been banned, and the population has rebounded.  The CFCs that have been destroying the ozone layer have been banned, and nobody talks about it anymore. The lead in gasoline and paints, that have caused untold harm to developing children has been banned, and nobody talks about lowering of the IQ of the kids due to lead poisoning anymore.  The sulfur emission has been severely restricted, the forests devastated by acid rain have bounced back; nobody talks about the horror of acid rain anymore.  The particulate emissions from coal plants have been drastically reduced, and now we able to see across all cities; nobody talks about particulate emissions anymore.  The horrible polystyrene mess made by clamshells, by packaging, etc. has been effectively eliminated, so styrofoam waste is almost nonexistent compared to the 1970s.  The oxygenate MTBE, which was to reduce air pollution but increased water pollution has been banned, and now, our water is MTBE-free.  The clearcutting of old-growth forests has been effectively banned, and there is more land devoted to forests than ever before.  Etc.  

It is the boomers who made environmentalism a thing.  Prior to the 1970s and 1960s, nobody understood that.

There are a couple of problems. First, you are in possession of stolen property. You do not have the title to it, the original owner does. This means that you could be criminally charged for receiving stolen property. Yes, there may be a good faith exception in some jurisdictions, but the buyer admits on social media that he thinks that the property is stolen. 

Secondly, since the buyer does not have a good title, the original owner can just take the bike without any compensation to the buyer. The buyer is out 80 GBP. Sure, it is morally right to give the buyer 80, or more, or less, but there is no obligation to do so. The courts have generally said that buyer would need to recover his money from the seller."
