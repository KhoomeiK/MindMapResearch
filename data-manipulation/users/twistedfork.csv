I think 10 is probably right around the time that her peers are going to start having their periods.

Also, I really don't think your kid honestly believes in Santa at 10. There is no way her peers haven't talked her out of that one yet."
TrollXChromosomes,ffcymba,t1_ff93hmz,1579809961.0,I just made my boyfriend a unicorn themed b-day cake and we both love tacos. I have been trying to find a cheap gift for him for valentine's day and i think i'm going to buy that unicorn taco holder.
