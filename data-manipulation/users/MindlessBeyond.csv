Also I feel like that's a lot of sugar?  I'd do dates and almond butter or honey and almond butter.  What if she – and I know I'm about to go totally into left field here but bear with me – ate a meal with one less sweet thing but more overall food?"

If you're already sitting down when this happens, I would suggest just calmly and evenly telling them that you're sitting down because you're dizzy/lightheaded.  It might prompt someone near you to offer their seat to the person too. 

Another option is getting a collapsible cane and using it when you're feeling poorly. I walked with a cane for a while when I was young and otherwise fit looking and people were extremely thoughtful towards me on public transit.  I know you say activity is important for your symptom management, but using it didn't impact my ability to walk briskly once I got the hang of it (my issue was weight and pressure on a joint) and it can help with stability too."

She was stooped, used a walker, and had trouble descending the three steps to the sidewalk. I heard drivers straight up yell at her to hurry up as she made her way to the curb. Although some were courteous and caring, I was still appalled at how bad it was overall."

blogsnark,ffv6jz3,t1_ffttxxt,1580256876.0,"I noticed that. Suspect they have a nose for fiction that is just challenging enough to the status quo to make the mainstream feel like they're being righteous while giving said mainstream the voyeuristic stuff they want. The Help was wildly successful, had a strong messages that racism is bad, but was still a story about how black people just need a nice white person in order to get liberated. I also remember reading some critiques saying the author really misunderstood what it was like to be a black person living in the south, but I don't remember the details. Either way the book was wildly popular and criticism was mostly sidelined. They probably hoped for the same thing to happen here."

Within the centerpieces my mind immediately jumped to two other eras that have barbed wire as a visually distinctive element: WWI and the Holocaust. If som used barbed wire centerpieces for a WWI book party they might get away with it, but if they tried to do it for a book set in the Holocaust they probably wouldn't, IMO rightfully. Anyway the most visually distinctive thing on the cover are those bird/flower things, IDK why they didn't just use those. Just on an aesthetic level, that cover is awesome."

I eventually moved off of it because it was making me sleep all the time, but I've always wondered, what about a medication would make you gain weight in a specific place?  I don't remember it making me hungrier or giving me specific cravings, but at the time I was on the Unemployment Diet so my calorie intake was pretty restricted. I did not gain weight on it but during weight loss I've retained a bit of a pot belly and I'm unsure if this is my own fault or a long-term side effect."
