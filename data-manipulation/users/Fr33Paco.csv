So you're saying this needs to change? I thought having the $MY\_DOMAIN there it pointed that rule to the name in the .env file?"
cars,ffu9izz,t1_ffu9gok,1580237322.0,true yeah.
LosAngeles,ffu8koz,t1_ffu8iog,1580236757.0,Samesies...already shedding a tear..lol...SOOOOO Freaking awesome
cars,ffu8ei5,t1_ffu8d1d,1580236655.0,ohh..no..shit...that's coool.
cars,ffu7q9o,t1_ffu7hw1,1580236253.0,"Yeah, my friend had a GTI and she absolutely loved it, super nice looking cars. My buddy has a Jetta GLI and has started modding it, super nice feeling cars. Yeah, in hindsight regardless I probably would have gotten the FoST, the small FiST has been an issue I've come to realize."
Traefik,ffu6sjp,t1_fddqx15,1580235697.0,"Hey I was just following your guide last night. To try to setup my Traefik.yml but at the end started getting errors stating ""unsupported ..."" I also thought I had the latest versions of yml running, but I'm not able to use anything above 2.3, how did you get it running with newer versions? I thought it was just a matter of naming the file.

Sorry if I'm asking so many questions but I got stuck. As well as traefik is only reacheable through the IP address and not the FQDN, and the additional containers return a 404 error.

Hope you it's not to much trouble."
cars,ffu582v,t1_ffu1xnw,1580234752.0,"Yeah, I've always had a soft spot for Hyundai, used to own a tiburon back in the days. I was fortunate enough for the SRT4 Neon was an awesome sounding and feeling car. 
Yeah, my FiST is one tough cookie, super reliable no issues in 100k miles I just hit. I ended up getting it because Ford gave 0% apr, was really close to getting the FoST too, I guess I'm glad I didn't as it's not as reliable. Super bummed out the FoRS wasn't a good thing either because i remember wanting one since i was a kid and probably would have bought it if it would have came out when I picked up my FiST. 

Now my FiST is delegated to being my FBO DD, and my A4 that I'm swapping the 2.7t my project car so I'll be busy for a bit. Not to say I still don't mind having 1 of each drive configuration."
cars,ffu4s6n,t1_ffu1nm4,1580234483.0,interesting.
LosAngeles,ffu4rgk,t3_ev5e3b,1580234471.0,"Beautiful morning, great weather outside. Drive in this morning to work as not bad at all, I may start coming to work late more often now."

cars,ffu0utr,t1_fftzraj,1580232066.0,I didn't think about that it makes sense that would do other stuff
cars,ffu0t79,t1_fftz6dt,1580232038.0,That is a fun fact.
cars,ffu0sbh,t1_fftntsn,1580232023.0,Gotcha. Been kinda thinking of getting one kinda still. Lol went to look at them when they first came. End up getting an srt4 instead.
cars,fftrzsz,t3_ev5gof,1580227837.0,"Wow didn't know borgwarner was that big. I mean I know a lot of OEMs use their turbos but, I'm only aware of the car oem"

selfhosted,ffs83ml,t3_eux0dt,1580175461.0,Subbing to find out if this is a thing.
apexlegends,ffs6w4t,t1_ffryn6i,1580174612.0,Thought that was that one famous actor from AHS the covenant or whatever with the witches.
MotoLA,ffs4imo,t1_ffs4fhh,1580172938.0,That's a bummer I would have shot down and picked it up right now. As I was getting off work in a few minutes
FordFocus,ffs4bz5,t1_ffrwy2b,1580172807.0,One of the many hoses that has to deal with the intake. Something must have came loose or maybe a hose got knicked somewhere.
funny,ffs45fn,t1_ffs1nu7,1580172679.0,I'm going to go check it out. We recently got 2 Aldis close to me. Never seen it before

Currently work in IT, so no real paper handling, what I do manage I have neatly stacked in folders or separated or organized in both of my note taking apps. I'm mostly okay, have managed to have awesome experiences good and bad growing up."

todayilearned,ffrhwpl,t1_ffqq1ad,1580158343.0,Same...the exes would spend hours on those games. It's a bit endearing but also crazy how much time.
LosAngeles,ffrh3ls,t1_ffrgwvn,1580157917.0,Probably...we can all have different levels of empathy to all kinds of situations. Apologies if mine are not on up to par as many others.
LosAngeles,ffrg7i3,t1_ffrfz59,1580157441.0,"I did to those who spoke to me, I don't punk out when asked a question or how I feel about a subject. I don't usually bite my tongue. It's how I sleep at night. Ultimately, if it doesn't affect my money or my family. Then I don't have a reason."

LosAngeles,ffr7qbt,t1_ffr7j3i,1580152277.0,"Understandable, just as everybody else is sharing theirs, I can do the same. Believe me, I know how much of an Icon he was, I'm not trying to knock on that. Just expressing my opinion just like everyone else."
LosAngeles,ffr4wfu,t3_euno0m,1580150520.0,"I'm as LA as they come, born and raised here. Never watched Basketball but always followed Kobe because he was LA. Yeah, it sucks he died in a crash along with his daughter and stuff, but I'd be lying if I said to me it's not such a big deal. People die all the time that we are not aware of. It sucks, I'm sad with him passing the way he did as a person and not because of his status.  

Just as sad as what's going on in Hong Kong, just as sad as what's going on in the middle east. Just as sad as some of the archaic laws in the states that make certain people seem bad."
FocusST,ffpw87c,t1_ffpiq9q,1580108140.0,"We did. It's in the Volvo c30.

I wish we would have gotten that body style"
