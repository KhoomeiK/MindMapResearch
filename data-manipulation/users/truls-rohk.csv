  You don't have ruler flat response though. http://www.acousticfrontiers.com/room-modes-101/

  You likely have peaks and valleys in your bass response as high as 20db from one another.  The eq on the 1000 is setupto get that response within an anechoic chamber, but that all goes out the window once that's thrown into a room.  Sure it's still a good starting point, but you need separate, extensive DSP at some point as well as lots of time and effort in room treatment and measuring and deciding sweet spot in order to reduce the room modes to flat.

  In addition, THX specifications do not want a flat response. Ideally you want more headroom in the bass region http://www.acousticfrontiers.com/2013314thx-reference-level/

  Please, by all means enjoy, your system, but just because you like it and someone else is doing something very differently doesn't mean that they are wrong.  That's all I've been getting at with my replies.

  Have a good one"

  Their is your bias and projection.  There's no reason it can't provided he builds and powers it appropriately.  

  >the input sensitivity for that old amp is 2.12V for full power

  Easy enough to boost if necessary, and there are plenty of receivers that do 2v or more straight out of the box.  I don't know if that's what OP has or not, but it's hardly a hiccup

  >If the hot thing to do is hook up a 40 year old PA amplifier more of us would be doing it.

  How much do you think technology has improved in the past 40 years?  Amps aren't particularly complicated and the improvements that have come about recently are in class D and G amps in efficiency and signal shaping (DSP), not really in any sound quality or distortion measurements.  Solid State amps are solid state amps, good components and AB are all going to be extremely similar over the past few decades if wattage matched.

  Oh look, the hot thing where most guys who do DIY subs use PA amps to power them.  And (since I can see you zeroing in on the ""Noisy"" referenced and ignoring everything else), that is in reference to the built in fans the amps usually have and not the output qualities.

  Also... Think of any high end actual theater you've been to.  They   use  PA amps to power the subs for IMAX and any other premium theater sound experience.

  >But I promise you a DIY sub with a generic PA amp and no forethought into the matching aside from power requirements

  Yes, it will take designing and building the proper enclosure.  That's not exactly rocket science.  AND even if went generic sealed, it's not that hard to match a low end SVS with some EQ (which is really where all the ""magic"" in that sub is).  They boost the low end in order for it to get down to a -3db of 24 hz.  This means the headroom overall is quite low for the subwoofer.

  If you don't care about reference volumes that's fine.  Most people don't."
hometheater,ffj3ntb,t1_ffiyxyd,1579989568.0,">SVS engineered this sub to do a really incredible job in a small footprint.

  of course they did.  That doesn't have anything to do with the noise and distortion measurements of plate amps.  They are NOT inherently superior in any way regarding these measurements.  Plate amps are chosen because they are the norm for the home theater market, not because of any inherent acoustical or amplification properties outside of a separate amp.

  It is notable the STA-300D (The amp within your sub), does not provide any THD or S/N ratio measurements.  If they were worth bragging about they would.  That's just marketing 101

  I'm glad you like your entry level premade home theater sub.  Doesn't mean you can't do better for less if one is interested in that sort of thing.  

  Obviously, you aren't and that's fine.  But doesn't mean your is better than OP's if he designs his box appropriately and takes other proper steps in setting everything up.  He may or may not do that, but his raw materials have far, far more potential than a single SB1000"
