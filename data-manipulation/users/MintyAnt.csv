I've been eyeing those cargo bikes with 2 seats and electric assist"
television,fdd1w87,t1_fdczlsn,1578291502.0,"I think the show was more written off what people reported and believed rather than what is scientifically correct, but that's just an observation.

As such, several concerns over radiation or certain actions they took are not factual, thus why people who we thought would die in 5 years didn't.

But either way, it absolutely increased the chance of cancer for everyone involved to varying degrees"
UpliftingNews,fd9dfhk,t1_fd496dg,1578231882.0,"I mean, there's already a concept of primary and secondary caregivers at many companies. Most of the time the woman is the primary and gets the higher time off because, y'know, their body is physically ravaged by the experience.

But I've seen the man get primary too. But it's always depressingly because the woman has no paternity at her job."

wholesomememes,fd68buo,t1_fd4yicq,1578187034.0,"My father once busted me for having both an Xbox and a PC in my room, both connected to the network, by a router.

I didn't realize it at the time, but the router I grabbed from his networking bin was meant to be the central hub of your house internet.. the cable modem goes to the router, and the router routes to all devices.

So by having a second one set up in my room, it started clashing with the houses router and caused it to drop in and out.

I remember being awoken to his looming shadow at like 2am and him going ""WHERE IS IT""

Like shit I didn't know what a router vs a switch was, I just wanted to internet my games! But he was convinced I was trying to like bypass his router and pirate stuff or somesuch.

He actually taught me a lot of other stuff, but shut down when it came to networking, something he knew a lot about.

Looking back, it would have been a good opportunity to teach me a bit about networking like what a router is, what a switch is. I'm already invested since I set it up, and my back's against the wall :p"

If I have a glass food jar for peanut butter or sauce or whatever, I usually wash it and keep it. I have a small collection I shove stuff in like used nails, forks, scrap metal, etc. Comes in handy!"

I don't love heights and it's an insane amount of work"
wholesomememes,fd6640c,t1_fd4eso8,1578186048.0,"Lamp works great, a radio on loud can also be super handy.

As you determine what breakers turn what off, label that breaker somehow. Tape and pen, excel sheet, whatever.

Also bear in mind that circuits tend to be for both sides of walls, not rooms."

I've found some different dry food he likes. I have about half fancy feast for wet, and I try various other brands for the other half of wet, but there's not a lot of solid research.

SequelMemes,fcc7nmz,t1_fcbiowp,1577595311.0,"It's the best of recent star wars stuff because it's so, so much smaller in scope. This show is by no means particularly good, but it's just simpler and takes a bit more time, vs these gargantuan movies with Galaxy level concerns.

Like this last movie had star destroyers with planet killing guns on each one.
Mandalorian has some blasters."
