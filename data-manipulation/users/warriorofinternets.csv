AskReddit,ff69bii,t3_ervm8h,1579622158.0,"Lived in Rome for a few extra months after my school ended. Budgeted well but by the last month I was there I was down to less than 300$ in my bank.

For breakfast I would have an espresso, some biscuits, and a cigarette. For lunch I would go in for a slice of pizza (around 2euros), and for dinner I would find a bar, buy a drink, and then raid their buffet ‘aperitivo’ sepections. 

The aperitivo saved me because I was able to find bars which offered meats veggies breads cheeses in unlimited quantities as long as you had purchased a drink.  I would buy 1 euro beer, eat for a while, then go to another bar and buy a 1 euro beer and eat again.

Over about 30 days I spent on average 6-7 euros a day, coming out to $180.

I returned to my senior year in college with about $100 left in the bank, and I immediately found a job on campus as a lifeguard.  After my first paycheck I could afford to buy books for the semester, so I did, scanned the entire books in my apartment to a digital pdf format and then returned them for a full refund.  Then I used that money to buy groceries (ate ramen for like a week and a half straight before that).

That was the last time I had no money, but the experience was invaluable and the first thing I did with my job out of college was to build up an emergency fund."
AskReddit,ff67i7a,t3_erujv7,1579620971.0,"Well I’m working for a travel agency that sends folks to China and I’ve been getting regular updates about this.

First was ‘we don’t know what it is, but it’s not serious’

Then it was ‘we know what it is and it’s contained to a medium sized city’

Now it’s ‘it spread to Beijing and Shanghai’

In total 3 ppl have died and 200+ infected. 1.5% death rate in the earliest stages before they set up treatment plans etc.  I figure if it makes it to the US they will have better medical services and more access to care than the people in China so that mortality rate would decrease probably under 1% (speculation).

As I’m not a typically at risk population and don’t have health complications, I’m able to not worry too much about it."

AskReddit,ff609pv,t3_ero9fj,1579615789.0,"I posted this previously, one of my go tos:


Another great nun joke. 3 nuns heading to church get in a car accident en route and all three die. After a brilliant flash of light the nuns find themselves standing at a pair of
golden and pearl gates with a rather holy looking man beside them.

“Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven” says Saint Peter , “to pass through these gates you must confess here and now to any outstanding sins you have committed in your life.”

The first nun approaches Saint Peter and says “once, before I took my
final vows to become a nun, a local boy showed me his penis and I touched it with my finger”

“Hmm that is serious” responded Saint Peter, “put your guilty finger inside this dish of holy water and say 5 our fathers and your sins will be forgiven and you may enter.”

While the first nun was complying with Peters instructions, he noticed the other two remaining nuns had begun to jostle and fight with each other for their position in line.

“Sisters! Sisters! Do not fight In this way when you are so close to heaven! What is the matter?”

One of the nuns responded “if I’m gonna have to gargle this holy water it sure as shit ain’t gonna be after Sister Mary sticks her ass in it!”"

Clearly we all saw the giant flames which passed from the burning twin towers and crossed approximately 200ft sideways to reach any area of tower #7.  

Of course fire tends to jump multiple hundreds of feet from building to building as one collapses straight down.

I agree that #7 collapsed after being consumed in flames. I disagree that the fire was caused by the collapse of wtc 1&2.

I also believe it to be far more likely that the missing trillions Rumsfeld announced on September 10th 2001 was the root cause of this tragedy.


“On September 10, 2001, then U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld disclosed that his department was unable to account for roughly $2.3 trillion worth of transactions.  The next day, the U.S. sustained the terrorist attacks that changed the world, and this startling revelation was forgotten. “"

This was done by the CIA hiring mobsters and busing in protestors to Tehran to overthrow the elected government.

Between 1953 and 1979 the shah ruled with an iron fist and murdered thousands in secret black site prisons.

Finally in 1977-1979 the Iranians rose up again, this time deposing the shah, and installing an Islamic government led by A religious leader named Ruhollah Khomeini.  It was a direct result of the last us led coup that the Iranian state viewed the Us with mistrust.

So now you say why not just revolt and overthrow, and they can rightly say they tried
That and got fucked over by America and her allies.

Also If you are wondering why the USA and UK overthrew a democratically elected leader in the Middle East, it is a one word answer. Oil."
