Don't you know, Trump has declared himself immune from criminal prosecution investigations due to the impropriety of accusing the POTUS of a felony, IAW the Nixon era memo as cited by Mueller.

It is also the position of the President and the Republican side of Congress that no impeachment attempt is valid without an accusation of a statutory felony, backed up by ironclad evidence.

But in any case, you are not allowed to accuse the President of a common felony, such as illegal drug use, nor to demand to search for evidence to back up such an accusation.  

Nor are you allowed to demand his removal without the accusation of a felony, because otherwise it's political baseless grandstanding.

flashlight,fgl9ydv,t1_fgi7ihn,1580887521.0,"Like the Battlemech that shares its name in the Battletech universe, it's reasonably priced and reasonably powerful.

The BT Catapult is a fire support mech whose job is to stand a few hundred meters from the front lines and bombard opponents with salvos of small missiles.  Unlike its namesake siege weapon, just in case something pops up right in your face, it also carries a simple backup weapon in the form of four identical medium lasers.  It's not the biggest, not the smallest, not the fastest, not the slowest.  It's simple to understand, and in-universe, simple to repair.  

The TN Catapult V6, so far to me, certainly seems to take after its fictional counterpart.  As a pocket thrower, its advertised job is to stand a few hundred meters away and bombard a target with photons.  But if you find yourself wanting to light up something right at your feet, it has moonlight and medium power modes.  (much like the mech's range brackets, it does not ramp smoothly-jumping from about 200 lumens straight to about 900 in main mode.  Moonlight can be achieved directly with a long press.)  Simple to operate, having only one button, full time battery indicator on said button, no command sequence needing more than four clicks, and onboard charging using the current USB-Mini standard, it doesn't have the latest in whizbang UIs, playful blinky patterns, brilliant body colors, or custom charging cradles.  It just does its job of lighting things up both near and far.  And at 6 C-bills, I mean 60 USD when on sale, 75 USD at full retail, it's cheaper and more feature rich than the 4-D LED upgraded  ML300L Maglite that you can probably find being touted at your local hardware store.

All in all, from an efficiency point of view, I really like it so far."

Fun fact: in a collision, you don't really care about the car, you care about the meatbags inside it and how they interact with hard or pointy things therein.

Thusly did auto engineers realize that you can't reduce the total amount of energy in the collision, but you can control where it goes.  Energy that goes into bending metal or throwing bits away is energy that is not going into the hollow center and the columns of noisy goo within.  You can also add things like seat belts and air bags to reduce the chance of sharp and pointy meeting soft and meaty.
