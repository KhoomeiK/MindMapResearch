aww,fehuahl,t3_ep8ewp,1579124001.0,"I worked at the Ca D Zan which is the glided age home of John and Mabel Ringling. The house sits on the  edge of Sarasota Bay with a long retaining wall running the length of the property.  One day while on break, I stood on the wall admiring the view when I noticed a dolphin in the water below just hovering there. Then I saw a large wave/ripple approaching the wall.  Several dolphin were herding a school of fish toward the wall and, naturally when they got to it, they had to change direction right in the mouth of the waiting dolphin. Not only did they use the wall as a tool but it was part of a coordinated effort to catch their prey."
