soccer,ffqb3ej,t1_ffq97j2,1580128871.0,"Yep, playing the kids who don't make our bench, is a safer prospect than risking players that could well be involved in the league run-in and CL. I'd like us to do better in the cups, but not to the detriment of the PL or CL this season."
JusticeServed,ffq64ut,t3_euihf7,1580122570.0,"Usually I don't like people stomping on an unconscious person in a fight, but if they literally just tried to murder you like this, I think they were too lenient with him."
LiverpoolFC,ffn8bop,t1_ffn84g5,1580063031.0,Did you decide not to watch the replay?
soccer,ffimixn,t1_ffi0qj9,1579977441.0,I'm surprised he's played recently. Figured he'd be on the bench rather than risk injury and the transfer falling through.

LiverpoolFC,ffhnvmb,t3_etn9kk,1579944479.0,"I'm surprised. I assumed we were still awful at them. Trent takes an age to throw, and I feel as though to usually comes to nothing. 

I've got no problem with us having a throw-in coach, and I'm sure it helps us, but it seems a bit convenient that we score (luckily) through a throw-in and everyone is preaching his name."
soccer,ffgms8u,t1_fff9daa,1579909869.0,Even if Rose fails there this probably still counts as a coup for them.

Real talk, who has ever hit the ground running like this before? He'd have to go on an almighty drought to not be a perfect signing."
LiverpoolFC,fffqixl,t1_fffdn5n,1579889618.0,"Imagine that. Would be a unique sight, and the only thing I can think of that trumps both Origi's winner against them and them losing to our U23s."

soccer,ffdj1j0,t1_ffda7fr,1579821908.0,"Due to an injury no less. I thought he did well. Good control generally, and he wasn't afraid to make runs and ask for the ball."

soccer,ff8xrke,t1_ff8q84z,1579699515.0,"Even at half that price I don't know if he could be a worthwhile investment. I think basically any team could get a better or more promising player for 70m.  I don't think we'd ever re-sign him, even if we were guaranteed his best form."

soccer,ff60nt4,t1_ff5mcng,1579616094.0,Especially as you play afterwards. I feel like there's definitely a theme of teams blowing their chances to catch up this season.
