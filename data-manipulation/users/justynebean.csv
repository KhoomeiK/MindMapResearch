Anxiety,fe64p4a,t3_enxhli,1578881724.0,"Oddly, podcasts helped me a ton! I had awful driving anxiety for years and by no means is it completely gone, but a good podcast or audiobook helps distract my brain in a healthy way for some reason. I still struggle a lot with driving at night though and driving at night in the rain is an absolute no for me."
