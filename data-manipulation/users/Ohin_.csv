Summerblade (fire) and winterblade (ice) are on par with/much better than the axe/club equivalents, while being a bit cheaper and available from level 180 onwards, which will help you a lot if you decide to go TH on the Spectres. Gnome Sword is available for 200+ and is dirt cheap, while Falcon Mace has the same stats, is more expensive and only available for 300+. Same with Falcon Battleaxe, much more expensive, only 300+, and, while it has more attack, it's 2H, which can be bad anywhere you need a shield.

The only thing that might be slightly bad for Swords is that it imbuement items might be slightly more expensive."
