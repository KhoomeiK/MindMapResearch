Divorce,ffewmoo,t3_esx80r,1579868553.0,"You deserve to be happy. You deserve to be with a partner who respects you. Do you have that now? It’s not up to your partner to make you happy (only you can do that), but it if your partner isn’t right for you, no amount of time will fix it. Sometimes you have to decide that your happiness and their happiness is worth more than both of you limping along in a bad marriage. Sometimes it’s not a big thing that ruins a marriage like an affair or addiction. Sometimes your relationship simply hits it’s expiration date. 

It’s ok to decide enough is enough. I was always lonely in my marriage. I actually thought we were happy and then one day he came to me and told me he didn’t love me anymore and didn’t want to be married to me anymore. Then he left me for another woman. We had been married for 17 years. I went into therapy and discovered that what I thought was a decent marriage was abusive. For years I had tried to get him into marriage counseling to work on our communication but he refused. He told me I was the one with the problem, not him. When I look back I see that his abuse had me convinced that there was something wrong with me. I knew I was lonely in our marriage but I thought that was normal.

With the help of my therapist I learned how a supportive partner acts. I’m now in a healthy relationship and my partner supports me. I’m not lonely anymore.

Don’t stay in a lonely marriage. It’s not good for either of you. Counseling can help (unless one of you is abusive, like in my marriage). I’m not saying to toss everything out the window without trying, but you BOTH have to try. One of you can’t fix it without the other. You’re a team, it has to be a team effort."
emotionalabuse,ffazvrb,t3_esju65,1579748359.0,"CPS is legally required to protect children. When they receive a call they have to follow up on it. Usually if the call is for a child under the age of 7, they must follow up within 24 hours. 

A caseworker will speak to the children. Someone’s they go to the school (especially if they are contacted by school personnel) but usually they show up unannounced at your home. They will interview you and each child separately. They will walk around your house to make sure the children aren’t living in unsanitary conditions. They will open your refrigerator to make sure you have food. They will turn in your kitchen sink faucet and flush your toilet to make sure you have running water. They will check each child’s bedroom to make sure they have a bed to sleep on. 

They are not looking for a perfectly clean house. They don’t care if the kids’ rooms are messy. They need to make sure that the kids are being fed and living in good conditions. 

From there they write a report and you’ll get a response. If it’s really bad they may take the kids right then. It really depends on the situation and the living conditions. 

They are not there for you. If you need help you need to contact your local domestic in violence center. They have so many resources and are very helpful. Most of the people who work there have been through it and are. It judgmental. 

CPS has been contacted for my ex twice. Once by the school and once by the courts after I filed a PFA against him in behalf of my son. In both cases the abuse was unfounded and the records destroyed."
abusiverelationships,ffay7ms,t1_ffaw3ta,1579747245.0,Oh yeah. He liked to act like his behavior was so normal. I truly believe that’s how he thinks relationships work. I would feel bad for his girlfriend if she wasn’t a cancer-faking liar.

He’s incredibly patient with me and listens when I rant and rave over my ex. He holds space for me when I’m triggered. He has picked me up off the floor when my daughter refused to come home, having been manipulated by my ex. He went with me and held my hand when I filed a PFA against my ex, and when I had to face him in court. 

He does the dishes because they need done and doesn’t hold it over my head. When I’m sick and I come out of the sick fog my house isn’t trashed because he picks up and takes care of things. He wakes up in the morning to get my teenage son up for school because he knows I’m not a morning person. He makes dinner and goes grocery shopping. None of these are things my ex would do, even for his own kids, yet my boyfriend does it voluntarily.

NarcissisticAbuse,ff9n36w,t1_ff9mx8v,1579716449.0,They all use the same playbook. Mine discarded me as soon as he found someone easier to manipulate. He moved her in the day I closed on my house. We were married 17 years. He knew her for 6 months.
NarcissisticAbuse,ff9mufd,t1_ff9lj07,1579716305.0,"I appreciate this, thank you! I am playing the long game. Remaining the sane, stable parent. Loving them unconditionally. Not blaming or shaming them (which is different than holding them responsible for their actions). 

My daughter is easier to manipulate so he does. I remain consistent. I love her and makes sure she knows I love her even when she won’t say it back. She knows I love her no matter what. She’ll learn that he loves her if she complies. 

I have done a lot of research. I have spoken to my therapist, my lawyer, her guidance counselor, and a domestic violence counselor. I have read books and blogs and articles, and watched videos by professionals and proper who are like me and lived through it. 

One big difference between me and my ex is that I read and research and continue to educate myself on topics I don’t understand, whereas he believes he knows it all and is not in need of additional education. As a parent it is my job to understand my kids and how best to raise them, and at this point that means understanding their father and how he operates. 

So I learn and adjust and love my kids. He just tries to win."
NarcissisticAbuse,ff9jz2k,t1_ff9jm3u,1579714615.0,"That’s so sad, I’m sorry. My ex doesn’t bad mouth me in front of my kids. One of his personas is Good Father so he does everything very subtly. Not much that I could use against him. 

Our kids are older, teenage and preteen. My teenage son saw through him pretty quickly, but he was always my ex’s scapegoat so that’s not too surprising. My daughter is my ex’s golden child and she gets caught in the middle. My ex treats her like an equal, not like his child. She worries about him and takes care of him, which is inappropriate. This is a lesson she has to learn on her own so I’m careful not to accuse her or my ex of things around her. I love her unconditionally and she’ll learn that his love is conditional (she’s already starting to learn this)."
NarcAbuseAndDivorce,ff9jm6g,t3_ese6e3,1579714401.0,"I agree with others, behavior is what matters. 

Your job is to be the sane, stable parent. You can only protect your kids from so much. Usually these types of narcs just want to win, and then they lose interest in actually parenting after a while once they realize they have to actually get off their asses and do shit. 

Talk to you lawyer about how to proceed. Make sure you have a lawyer that understands domestic abuse (even if he wasn’t physically abusive, all abusers have the same mentality). Abusers use the same playbook so they’re fairly predictable. That’s to your advantage. 

When you are in court stay calm and remain factual. Don’t accuse him of being a narcissist (especially without a diagnoses). Narcissists are excellent manipulators and your knowledge of their narcissist tendencies is a secret weapon against them. When they try to push your buttons and you don’t fall apart it throws them off and they start to unravel."

NarcissisticAbuse,ff9f5tf,t1_ff9e6ey,1579711696.0,"He was emotionally and mentally abusive. He uses the kids to manipulate and abuse still. He alienated my daughter from me for 2 months at one point - I hardly saw or spoke to her in that time and our relationship is still recovering. 

He blames me for everything just like he always did, but now he’s limited to the kids. So he does things like blame me for refusing to do their laundry when they ran out of closeness clothes at his house (a lie, of course I do their laundry). One of his reasons for leaving me was that I was a terrible housewife - this is him twisting the knife to I make sure that I still know I’m a terrible housewife and he was justified in leaving me (even if none of it was true). 

It’s a constant battle with him over the kids. At one point he was convinced our (perfectly normal) teenage son was an alcoholic juvenile delinquent on the way to becoming a drug user. All because my so was mad at his dad and stole (but didn’t drink) alcohol at his dads house. Somehow this was my fault, even though he only acted up like this at his dad’s house. He said I didn’t allow him to parent properly when I filed a PFA against him for getting too physical with our son. Everything is still my fault. 

Now he wants our daughter to go to counseling (when he refused before) and he said it’s because I’m a terrible mother and it’s my fault that she resents me because we got divorced. He left me for another woman. Still my fault. 

It’s the same abuse he always did before. Blaming me for things either out of my control or things he’s responsible for. Gaslighting. Redirecting. Invalidating. Doing anything he can to make me feel inadequate.

It’s exhausting dealing with him. He doesn’t care about what’s right for this kids, just him being “right.” It’s a constant battle and our kids end up caught in the middle. Everything I do is questioned. The difference is now instead of telling me I am a terrible housewife who makes his life miserable, now I’m a terrible mother who can’t keep my house clean (I do) and my children are suffering for it (they’re not)."

My mother taught me her codependent ways and normalized abusive behavior, that’s how I ended up marrying a many who was abusive.

My ex never joined my church because his family is Catholic and I am not. He never bothered to do much so we always went to my church because that’s what I wanted to do. I always told him if he wanted the kids to also go to Catholic Church (which they very easily could have done Saturday evenings), that was fine but I wasn’t taking them and doing the work, that it’s his religion and I am totally fine with them being exposed to both as long as he takes them. He never bothered. 

My son was confirmed by the time I moved out and we were working on our custody agreement but my daughter was a few years away from starting confirmation. I know my ex, and I wouldn’t put it past him to try to pull a fast one and suddenly have a strong desire for our daughter to be Catholic. I also didn’t want him to stop taking the kids to church on his weekends. He stayed in our marital home so there was no reason for them to stop going to church his weekends. 

I made sure that our custody agreement includes that the kids will continue to go to my church (their church, where they were baptized and went their whole lives) until my daughter is confirmed. We also have a clause that states that we can make changes if we both agree. And I don’t expect them to go every single weekend, just regularly. 

I think having something like this included in your custody agreement is very helpful, especially if you have an established religion. Religion is something that can become an issue in any marriage to begin with and especially when children enter the picture and that doesn’t go away in a divorce."

I found this book to be very helpful. 

The thing is with narcissists is that they are predictable and their love is conditional. Your job is to be the sane, stable parent and to love your kids unconditionally. 

When dealing with parental alienation, you have to be patient. You can’t blame the child or point out the other parents’ (obvious to every one but them) manipulation. You have to love your child unconditionally. That means when they tell you they hate you and that you don’t love them, you calmly tell them that you do love them. No blaming, no shaming, just love. Lots and lots of love. 

She wanted to be at his house and not mine and I let her until she was ready to come back home. It took 2 months. It broke my heart.

It’s hard when your instinct is to protect your child, but she was right. 

My ex has a Good Father persona. So he doesn’t talk bad about me in front of the kids - not directly. He is a covert narcissist so all of his manipulation is subtle. That meant that he ran out of excuses to keep her from me. He claims he always encouraged us to have a good relationship and eventually he had to act that way as well.

She then proceeded to pack my items in garbage bags and he dropped them off at my house. Then he called me ungrateful. I never had a chance to pack my things, or really have closure on the house that was my home for 15 years. A few weeks later he changed the locks and held the rest of my items for ransom, saying he would only give me them if I agreed to his terms. I had to get my lawyer involved to get my things and even then he packed them up and left them for me on the porch. Now I’m not allowed into the house without his prior written approval (he filed this with the courts so I couldn’t walk into the house I still own whoever I want, which I never did anyway). 

He also agreed to buy me out of the house (which I agreed to as well) and he has changed the amount several times. He agreed to pay me for half of the items in the house and later changed his mind. He emptied and closed our joint bank accounts when I didn’t immediately agree with him on how we were splitting our finances and assets. 

The discard and replacement is harsh. They will do anything to win. 

Just be careful because my ex tried to alienate my daughter from me. I never thought he would stoop so low as to manipulate our kids but he sure did."

You have to learn to set healthy boundaries. That is the center of recovery. Melody’s book walks you through what a healthy boundary looks like and how to make and enforce them. 

I frequently consider if my boundaries are healthy whenever someone gets upset at me. I think about what my boundary is and if it’s reasonable. Usually it is and I carry on even though the person is upset. People become upset when your boundaries no longer benefit them. Oh well. That’s their problem, not mine."

Check out [Chump Lady](http://www.chumplady.com). She helped me a lot. 

My ex left me for a woman 10 years younger than him. She was a “friend” who was helping us around the house while I was recovering from surgery. She convinced him that I was being lazy instead of recovering. Then she faked cancer because I was getting to much attention while I was recovering. She lied about a lot of other things too. When I figured out the lies my husband was furious with me because, as I found out later, they had been waiting for me to finish recovering to run away together. She’s now living in my house with my husband and raising my kids half the time.

I started seeing a therapist and she helped me see how abusive my ex was throughout our marriage. I agree to a divorce pretty quickly because he treated me so badly when I found out the OW lied. I am still struggling to get on my feet financially but I took time to grieve and heal. The entire experience was really traumatizing. 

I also learned I’m codependent which explained a lot of my behaviors that contributed to my marriage ending - mainly that I didn’t know how to set healthy boundaries. Had I been able to do that I wouldn’t have tolerated his abuse for so long. It had been normalized to me. 

Overall I’m happier now. I’m in a healthy relationship with a wonderful man. I’m not where I need to be financially but I am working on it and I will be soon. I went into a lot of debt to get out of my marriage and that’s ok because I’m worth it. My happiness and well being are worth any amount."

My sister’s ex is barely in their lives. She has full custody. When the kids were little he had them most weekends but now he sees them once or twice a year. Child support has been spotty because he’ll literally quit working so h doesn’t have to pay. Now that she sees what I’m going through with 50/50 custody with a narcissist she is much more grateful that, while she has to do al the work of raising the kids on her own, she doesn’t have to deal with him hardly at all. He doesn’t pull the shit our exes do with us. I’ve told her more than once that I’m jealous. As much as I have enjoyed having time to myself for once (since I did all of the work with the kids when we were together and now he actually has to do some), having to deal with his delusions and accusations is exhausting."

We had issues and ended up seeing a coparenting counselor which was really helpful to have a third party explain to him why he’s being an unreasonable idiot (in therapist speak). One of the things he told us is that our kids will act up if we don’t get along. It’s so frustrating because me ex is so unreasonable and accuses me of the lost ridiculous things. The latest was that I am refusing to do their laundry because our kids ran out of clean socks and underwear at his house.

I just think it’s hilarious because of course he assumed I would be the one talking shit etc. That custody agreement has helped me so many times when he would forget what was in it and insist on different things.

We’re still fighting over finances and I believe his need to be right about how I was a horrible wife and how much better his GF is is stronger than his need to hoover me back right now. 

I believe that she’ll tire of his abuse at some point and leave him. That’s when I expect him to come sniffing around. It will probably take a few more years, I don’t see her going anywhere until our divorce is final since that’s what he’s blaming all of their problems on and why they can’t get married.

Let’s say on the financial statement he says he has Checking Account A. That’s it. Then in the detailed financial statements from the bank you find transfers to Checking Account B. That shows that he lied on the initial financial statement and is hiding money.
