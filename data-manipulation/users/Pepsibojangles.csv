facepalm,fdkqx14,t1_fdkqjpu,1578509290.0,Thanks for the reply. I only ask because there is a quasi national story about a family in my area whose 12 year old underwent some kind of surgery. I believe it was hormone therapy. Thanks for clarifying.
facepalm,fdkq5tx,t1_fdkq05l,1578508843.0,Does the hormone therapy I read about count as a medical procedure? Or am I misinformed?

yourmomshousepodcast,fcuk5d4,t1_fcujb2v,1577982835.0,"yup, that we know for sure. I guess what i am asking is why you think my admittedly completely made up theory is not plausible. 

I feel like whoever is in charge of McDonald's web marketing people, saw more hits/hash tags/ whatever metric they use to monitor social media for McDonald's along with YHM tags. The marketing team probably had some meetings and decided to throw some money, which probably was chump change to them, to get in on the action. McDonald's got mentioned a few times on the show, gave some plausibility to the ""joke"", Seems like something a corporation would do. In my opinion anyways."
yourmomshousepodcast,fcug0uw,t1_fcufmfb,1577980074.0,"It didn't have to be the first thing. Christine had a period of a week or two where she was doing paid Instagram posts. Why wouldn't a big corporation advertise with a youtube show ""personality"" that gets hundred of thousands of views?

What do you think happened?"
yourmomshousepodcast,fcue0bd,t1_fctwpmo,1577978732.0,that was after the main mommies ran with the joke for a little while. McDonald's throwing a few hundos at christy to do an instagram post to capitalize on the running joke is very different then McDonald's giving Tim and Christy 5.3 million or whatever the number was.

ConanBeingAwesome,fcjzc82,t1_fcjq2el,1577711504.0,"You must not have been around for when this went down. What you are saying is very disingenuous. You are completely overlooking the importance of the lead in. In late night television, the lead in is the one of the most important  factors on how well the show ratings preform. Leno's ""Comedy"" hour or whatever it was called bombed. It was abysmal and the ratings reflected that. Conan's Tonight Show despite being on later had better ratings.

After Leno took the tonight show back over, the ratings were worse than Conan's Tonight Show.
