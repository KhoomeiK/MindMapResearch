I remember I once rolled over on my mattress and this spring stabbed me in the leg. It started bleeding and I just didnt do anything. It became infected, and turned a funky color. I never did a thing. Pus was oozing out of it for weeks. The skin became black and I would randomly feel sick and need to vomit. Guess where I would vomit. Right into a trashcan next to my bed that eventually got tossed into a bathroom that slowly filled with garbage and waste until mold was growing inside and somehow the ceiling over the shower had fallen in.  I am honestly surprised I didn't die in that apartment."
NeckbeardNests,fgh21pp,t1_fgh15oz,1580774830.0,"Imagine how the person living in that must felt on a daily basis.  Many years ago I found myself in the midst of probably the darkest time of my life. This was basically my apartment. I Just stopped caring and had given up and it showed. My apartment became a shit hole, my relationships fell apart, my health started to get really bad.  The best thing that happened to me that year was my apartment building catching fire and losing all of my worldly belongings.  It finally bottomed me out and slammed me into rock bottom HARD. Then I was able to start getting better

Fortunately that part of my life is a lifetime behind me, and I have made some great strides moving forward, but still have some stuff to work on. Seeing stuff like this makes me sad. It reminds me of a time and place that I would never wish for someone to go through and makes me wonder what became of the person who spent their nights alone in that place... wishing whatever it is would just fucking end."

Im not sayin ""Nah, high school kids don't have guns"". Im saying ""Nah, high school kids have ZERO issues amongst one another that require a firearm or the threat of death. Just go box it out like dudes. Get beat up and move on.

That is not to say that I am not aware that high school kids do not handle things with firearms. I am saying that at that age there is absolutely nothing between high school children that requires death. Look, I get it. The world is a totally different place than it was when i was a high school senior 20 years ago. I have watched it change over the years and it has been incredible to see all of the technological and cultural advancement we have made in such a short time. However, with that...Children have changed. Over the past 2 decades children have become more and more desensitized to violence and completely apathetic to the world around them. I mean... Just look at the video.

It is so sad to people in my age range to see people in your age range so completely adapted to a world full of hate, indifference, and violence that shit like this doesn't even phase you. It really sucks that you are spending some of the best years of your life in a world in the condition that this one is in.

This isn't a jab at you or anything, honestly.  It's just been quite the ride watching the world change so drastically and to finally see the point where children are completely indifferent to death and violence, and rather than anyone trying to intervene...Everybody stood around and watched and filmed.  I hope that one day shit goes in a different direction dude, this is definitely not what we imagined as kids watching Stick Stickly on Nickelodeon and calling in to pledge hours on ""THE BIG HELP"".

I truly hope this doesn't sound rude or anything. It's Just my experience and nostalgia passed down to a stranger online here on a comment. It doesn't mean anything ultimately unless it does, know what i mean?

Take care High School Senior. The world is smaller than you think it is, but the opportunity is endless. Stay safe and Good luck!"

I do know that they exist, and going back my comment does seem to generalize a bit more than I intended. It is just that in my experience and that of those around me the police have not been as professional as one would have hoped. I have personally seen the police do some pretty horrible things to people that did not deserve it, while I have also seen the police do some pretty great things. It just seems that there is a massive divide between the police and communities they serve, and it does not seem to be getting better. True, not all police are power-mad sadists bent on harming anyone they contact and we only see a small percentage on the news and it usually bad....BUT...
 Why is it when some clearly horrible thing perpetrated by a cop is caught on tape, and any reasonable person would look at it and think "" Well, damn. There was no need to beat that man for 12 minutes until his brains were exposed"" there is NEVER any sort of accountability. These dudes can literally shoot an unarmed suspect in the back 36 times and walk.

He dies on November 7th 2018 completely unexpectedly and I completely disconnect from my Girlfriend and son and fall into even further depression and now stop eating. 

Now friendless, unable to sleep most nights and spend my days wishing I had some place to go or someone to talk to. It is incredibly painful and lonely and sometimes at night I get os desperate for human contact and someone to talk to outside of my home that I call crisis lines and try to spark up some kind of conversation. 

Tl;Dr: Hanging on by a thread and waiting for it to snap any moment."
AskReddit,fevkh7z,t1_fetsm95,1579398457.0,">I am sorry for your loss. My cat of 15 years died unexpectedly, and for a year or so afterward I would wake up with new little scratches and nail marks on my chest where he would sleep at night. Then on my birthday following his death, we came home and in the hallway there was a playing card with his toothmarks on it. When he was alive I would toss cards and he would catch them and he would bring them back with his little toothmarks puncturing them. It was one of the strangest things I have ever experienced because there were no other cats in the home to scratch me and That particular deck of cards which the card came from was one I do not own, or have ever owned"
trees,fevizpi,t1_feufqof,1579397980.0,I agree. But if someone is funny and it has turned into an impromptu stand up performance I am not about to take that away from my dude

magicTCG,feuswcv,t3_eql44v,1579389624.0,"I do not mind them inserting an advert card into the pack, totally fair. I do wish that they would utilize the backside of these as a token, or print some numbered bubbles so new players can use it as a life tracker, or anything other than THE EXACT SAME ADVERTISEMENT. I ended up with an enormous stack of these cards and couldn't help but think about how much wasted paper was sitting in front of me about to get thrown into the recycling bin that would not be tossed out had it had some sort of utility other than to serve as an Ad."

I saw him way back on the Antichrist Superstar tour and that was fucking great, then saw him a few years back and man it was awful. He was so fucking stoned or drunk or both that he could hardly perform. He just slogged around the stage and kind of mumbled into the mic. He puked on the side of the stage several times before the show ended early.  Fuck his live show.

Nine inch nails on the other hand are more enjoyable and on point live currently than they were in the 90s IMO."
