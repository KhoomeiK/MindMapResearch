yea I was talking more on a general level in that they simply turn off of a game/anime as a whole. Not suddenly going ""wtf I love dubs now"". especially for a newer viewer/player.  

Unless the dub was the only thing wrong and everything else was perfect I doubt someone would bother finding an alternate voice track when there's so many other games/anime to choose from atm. 

>More often, I am seeing people complain about perfectly competent dubs, like Xenoblade Chronicles 2 or Haikyuu. 

I still think Rex sounds a bit werid, but I think anything other than that is just preference and not really ""factual opinion"". personally, A dub has to be [REALLY BAD](https://youtu.be/bangt7d9vGA) before I feel like it literally starts to take away from the experience.

i think the opposite. I'd wager many people are put off of anime as a whole because of bad dubs from companies that didn't or couldn't care enough for decent voice direction. Recent example with Japanese Dubs: Black Clover's anime turned off a LOT of people due to the (supposedly, haven't watched it) annoying voice of the protagonist and his constant screaming. But apparently now some 70 episodes in it's ""starting to get good"", so people are curious on when it gets good and possibly how much of the anime to skip to get to ""the good"". 

if you want a game example, [Arc rise Fantasia](https://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/arc-rise-fantasia) is a pretty infamous example of a game with horrible english dubs that only turned people off the game and had it panned by critics. Shame because I hear there's a pretty good japanese cast for it.

in any case, the dub vs. sub debate in games is an antiquated one. Based around a time where a game either lacked the foresight to keep more than one voice track in mind, or in some cases where the disc simply lacked the space to keep multiple voice tracks. So you actually did have to choose one or the other. It still existing today are due more to either liscencing or simply a cost cutting measure.

I went into a career out of college that everyone here (and reddit in general) looks down upon for pay that people would laugh at. And TBF, things didn't go my way. I was laid off 2 years later (yea, pretty obvious what industry I was in). But I knew what I wanted to do, why I wanted to do it, and had a plan (TLDR make up for the fact that I couldn't get a masters lol). it involved personal projects I'd work on regularly after work (another thing this sub looks down upon) as well as some extensive math studies. 

I was expecting 3-4 years before I'd have the experience needed to even be considered, but I was lucky enough to be at the right time at the right place with the preparation needed. Professional experience in the domain, side projects directly related to what the company wanted, and the technical knowledge to explain on the fly what I did and did not know. 

Now I'm basically doing exactly what I wanted to do for more money than I ever expected @ 2 years of experience. still nothing the sub would find impressive but wayy more than enough to do everything I needed and more.

That's not necessarily something I'd recommend to everyone, nor is it a plan I'd recommend to follow. But it was a roadmap I researched and realized that I needed more than leetcode to achieve.

that's not a lag problem, it's a problem from putting jump doubleflight and glide on the same damn button. KH1 solved this problem and idk why 3 reverted it lol. 

Either way I don't think the speed of glide is a problem in 3. In fact I find 2's glide to hard to control to be useful outside of traversal. It's a good medium Between KH1's glide and super glide (heck it might have superglide's speed, it just lacks that wind VFX and has more land to cover).

Steering it sucks tho. you're basically wiggling the analog direction just to correct for how damn wide sora wants to turn.

Btw the TL:DR to the rest of your comment

>I don't know how you can dispute this.

KH3 Sora isn't defenseless in the air and has plenty of options that are way better than 2's options of ""super awkward spinny dodge"" or ""glide way too fast away with no i-frames"". KH3 sora homes in a lot better in the air (maybe too well. In crit you could basicslly fly with combo master), 90% of his magic isn't useless or overly slow in the air (and he can by default move and cast), and air slide lets him traverse in a quick and safe way (and if you want, very far). he can also close Hella distance if you want from airstepping. Or you know, he can just guard lol.

I wouldn't say it's better or worse than KH2. just different. I do wish they tweaked glide controls and let sora keep air combos in the air (ironic, given how much Sora likes being in the air now) but I also never want to go back to a game where sora can't guard in mid air, y'know? They both have good and bad elements."

I feel that's unfair because all KH2 had to worry about was 1 (very straightforward story) and COM (slightly more convuluted, but still understandable). KH3 had to come off both the BS time travel of DDD and setup all the stupid plot threads of the X arc.

As a result, KH3's story has no identity of its own: there are no new characters, concepts, nor ideas introduced in KH3 (which is unfortunately good. they had enough plot points to close). Except the Final World and I guess Yozora (note: I haven't played Re:mind yet. no spoils pls). The entire point of KH3 is more to bridge plot points more than create any new concepts

- power of waking? DDD
- Black box? KHX back cover
- Chirity/Strelexia/""the girl""? KHUX
- all the other characters thst popped in? from all the previous games. Even popped in a small Re:Coded reference.

True, and that's always a worry in a community. Saw it firsthand in another sub (and tbh, I kinda agreed with the motives, even tho the top mod handled it in the shittiest way possible). Can't say much to that other than that he's gone this long without doing this and that it's a bridge we cross (and probably burn) when we get there. Future is never certain and no single person is immune to this. 

Personally, as long as the sub (visual novels) doesn't start getting picky on what VN's can or can't be discussed here I'm good. I don't read EVN's but if there really is some divide and gambs one day snaps and tries to justify an EVN ban with how it's ""protecting community values"" I'd fight against that. Visual novels as a definition is nebulous but I think most agree that the origin of the VN doesn't disqualify it from being a VN. 

>Ideally it could be someone with a verifiable track record and an existing long-term presence in the community, even though people who fit this profile are obviously not super numerous.

Ideally, yes. But when a community like this is semi-anonymous to begin with its hard and annoying to keep tabs and who does what. 

In addition to that, It also doesn't necessarily transfer well; just like how you may have a genius professor with multiple rewards in research be shit at teaching 101, you can have an active member of the community who seems to have well aligned goals end up being a shit leader. In this case, doing something out of duty and not for fun becomes a grind and that person may either become just as unresponsive or even ""snap"" and become power hungry.

 ofc the age of the SRPG matters in that case.

- Tactics Orge had an 8 year run but has been dormant for 19 years.

- FFT had a (IIRC) 6 year run but it's been 15 years since A2.

- if we count all the non-Disgaea NISA SRPG's as a ""series"", I belive ZHP was the last game to do this some 11 years ago. even then ZHP is a special kind of system. you and enemies move ""simultaneously"" in a turned based fashion. Not really like Disgaea nor FE. 

- Luminous arc 3 was 11 years ago and infinity died with its company

It's unfortunate that we have had an SRPG drought the past 5+ years and I'm not saying  I hate those kinds of games. FFT is my GOAT. but seeing what games survived (I. e. what games companies deemed as profitable enough to continue making) throughout the years is telling in and of itself. Imageepooch dying on what could be argued as one of their better games doesn't help with the sentiment  either."

It seems like you're assuming a young western audience and that you need a AAA levels of success, so by those metrics: probably not. The big turned based game that did do this this decade (Undertale) basically had an arcade mini-game built into its turned based RPG system. so it seems that you can't just make a pure turned based game and expect to compete with pokemon/dragonquest.

Possibly needing time to gather data to justify the pitch. Then from there after being approved they'd need time to find a studio, make contracts, etc.
