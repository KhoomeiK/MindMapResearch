She is literally doing the opposite and saying all the abuse is legit and she has a mountain of evidence such that the only way to disprove that evidence is to say she faked it which is literally unbelievable bc of the mountain of evidence. 

Now I have no idea wtf actually happened between these two ppl. But she’s definitely not revealing her criminal master plan or anything."
dataisbeautiful,fgqze3m,t1_fgow4o7,1581034767.0,"Yeah Reddit makes it seem like Romney lost because of that statement. That statement was literally nothing but a meme. The truth is that people just liked Obama better. 

I voted for Obama twice and said I would’ve voted for Romney over many others, just not Obama. That was the general feel of America, Romney’s not a bad guy but seemed a bit out of touch. Reddit’s just over blowing the drama of that entire election."
pics,fglqv06,t1_fglmdr7,1580908517.0,Sure but thinking in % only allows you to grasp F. I’m American so I already know the F system. I need to figure out C system much more frequently.
pics,fglqpb3,t1_fgleuhv,1580908381.0,"Haha yes -40F is -40C. But, using the approx you get -40 - 30 = -75 divide by 2 = -37.5. 

It’s a bit off but it gives you the correct approximation that it’s cold as fuck."
pics,fglqj1t,t1_fglpfcl,1580908230.0,This is pretty good - not sure I could do it so quickly in casual conversation. I work with a few Australians and they’re always speaking in terms of Celsius so I just need something I can do without thinking too much.
pics,fgl2gct,t1_fgkz28f,1580879943.0,Because no one does that for a quick approximation. C to F is double it and add 30. F to C is subtract 30 and divide by 2.

todayilearned,fgj5fzg,t1_fgj0l2v,1580837333.0,They overcharge insurance companies bc they only ever see a fraction of what they charge. Insurance companies literally have enough power to say “this is what we re paying you regardless of what things cost. Fuck off if you don’t like it”
todayilearned,fgj5c97,t1_fgj3mwc,1580837274.0,Yeah my whole family works in healthcare. Hospitals don’t get paid shit out of insurance and are forced to over charge in the hopes of getting something back. They overcharge insurance companies mostly and see a fraction of the true cost.
todayilearned,fgiyrwm,t1_fgiv4d1,1580833708.0,"Hospitals will absolutely not lobby against it. It will save them so much headache, time, paperwork, money etc. insurance companies will and they have the real power in our healthcare system."

news,fg4cpng,t1_fg4b8ck,1580500964.0,"Totally fair criticism of a shitty pay system. However, to OPs point, it seems like he’s complaining that his ceo has performance incentives and he does not. I think his argument is more powerful if he argues that he should have fair, performance based incentives bc his work contributed to hitting targets. That should be the argument to make. 

However, arguing that his ceo has performance based compensation and he doesn’t and that’s unfair is not a good argument in a vacuum. As someone who works in an industry with lock step pay AND lock step bonus, I fucking hate not having performance incentives. I get paid the same as ppl doing the bare minimum and it’s annoying. I think everyone should have performance incentives from CEO to staff employee."

investing,ffozqdq,t1_ffodhhp,1580083711.0,Yeahup I’m in such a market. We’ve converted our $3600/month 1 bedroom apartment into a 2 bedroom. My roommate and I each pay 1800/month. It would be 1.2M to buy but then there would still be maintenance and all sorts of condo association monthly fees.
investing,ffoziol,t1_ffogzzp,1580083614.0,Yeah I neither have the skills nor 100+ hours as I’m working close to 80 hours a week already. So if I ever get into real estate I’d have to use a property mgmt company.

Yes, I’m aware of bohemian rhapsody and change of seasons and stairway to heaven etc. I’m just saying that wouldn’t be the norm.

dataisbeautiful,ffjo0ab,t1_ffi4z7k,1580002680.0,Unfortunately that would have the opposite effect where songs would get obnoxiously long with repeating choruses with nothing different. You’d end up with every song being 6 minutes long with just repeating choruses.

nottheonion,ff49o7w,t1_ff2w7t1,1579558581.0,"Idk what your job is, but I’ve found being sociable has made me a better worker. I’ve seen ppl spend hours grinding away trying to find a solution and eventually finding one. Sure, they’re working hard but that’s not really the most efficient way to go about a task. 

When I’m stuck I can usually call someone that I know has done this before and ask them for their approach. Having a large network means more ppl to draw and learn from. From an optics point of view, the person grinding away might be a “harder” worker but spending twice as much time on something isn’t always a great thing. 

I don’t think “kissing ass” should be rewarded but networking and learning from your network is a real skill."

Don’t get me wrong - there’s some beautiful scenery and ppl can be really nice when you get talking to them. But not somewhere I’d actually want to move.

Edit: I should clarify that I’ve mostly only been to the Baltic states and not deeper Eastern Europe."
todayilearned,fejkyqq,t1_feisjam,1579178408.0,The public pays attention more. If you read about a kidnapping you tend to move on. Hearing the emotional appeal makes you pay attention more and burns the memory of the kid in your mind. That way if you’re doing groceries and see the kid in a car on your way to the store you remember and call the cops.

investing,fdxe8pj,t1_fdx83ku,1578767891.0,Oh yeah sorry - I was really responding more to the video than your post on dividend indexes vs. dividend stocks bc the person in the vid seems to be only focusing on choosing individual stocks based on dividends.
investing,fdx6cgu,t1_fdvmawe,1578765752.0,"Why wouldn’t people just invest in a dividend index for stable income producing asset? Why invest in an individual dividend stock instead of an index? Is there a theory that a stock giving high dividends is posed for growth? That seems kind of a silly theory because that in a vacuum would mean you should invest heavily in REITs. 

My plan is index equity until I’m older, start shifting to dividend indexes as I get older and later into retirement."

Edit: also find it weird that I get downvoted for explaining why HOAs exist. I didn’t express any opinion on their validity or personal preference for them or anything. Just explained why they exist lmao.

Edit2: I think I understand where some of the confusion comes from. I live in NYC and growing up our house was 10-15 feet away from our neighbors house. If you live in the country and your neighbors house is 500 yards away - then yes whatever they do - no one cares. But, when you’re living in a very densely populated area and are forced to see, hear, and smell everything your neighbor does - it’s a different environment."
AskReddit,fdok8kt,t1_fdok01r,1578606826.0,I would say that it’s healthier to be able to play both individually and with a group and I’d foster an environment where my children are friendly and okay with sharing their toys. Don’t think that’s controversial at all.
AskReddit,fdoju2h,t1_fdo93pc,1578606596.0,Mmm kids want a lot of shit that’s not good for them. Your job as a parent is to help them make better choices. If my kid doesn’t want to eat vegetables and wants ice cream every night than I’m going to force them to eat vegetables and not have ice cream. This is a similar policy - they don’t have to play together all the time but yes sometimes they’ll have to share and play together.
insanepeoplefacebook,fdo4tdu,t1_fdn7oiz,1578598914.0,Anyone that’s proud of the shit they were born with rather than the shit they achieved in life is pathetic. Racists fall completely into this category.
