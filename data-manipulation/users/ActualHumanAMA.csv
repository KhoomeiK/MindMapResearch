devopsish,ff8t357,t3_esaupr,1579695049.0,"After the SB tool leak/sale, it's hard to imagine that the FBI doesn't have the means (and hardware!) to access the data in secured devices. I personally think it's more of a need to legally justify how said data was obtained."
DestinyTheGame,ff7uovj,t1_ff7o6o8,1579658798.0,"Because if the sparrows were too fast they could get to the next zone before the instance loads, causing all sorts of issues."
AskReddit,ff5llcr,t1_ff5i6z9,1579598864.0,This is my life sentence.
AskReddit,ff5ljv4,t1_ff5ilxw,1579598802.0,The goal was the moon though...
AskReddit,ff5ligl,t1_ff5l2ka,1579598743.0,"Not gonna argue with you, but our of curiosity what did you want out of life? What goals did you fail to achieve?"
DestinyTheGame,ff0hqk0,t1_fetrj9v,1579468964.0,"Thank you for this reply! The way that Destiny works is pretty fascinating from a technical standpoint, and as someone who wants to get into programming/game dev I really appreciate this focus on empowering the community. 

Out of curiosity, does Bungie have anything planned for GDC 2020?"
news,fe6m0oz,t1_fe6lpvp,1578895450.0,"That's going a bit overboard, who here is chanting ""death to America""? Certainly not me. I'm not criticizing the US as a whole, just the recent actions of a few of its leaders. Do you think I should consider the entire history of every nation if I want to critique their recent actions?

These sort of reactionary tribalist judgments really make it hard to argue on the internet. Idk i'm too drunk to argue at 1am on a sunday."
news,fe6ln0l,t1_fe6limb,1578895051.0,"Depends on how you define ""success"". Is it GDP? Average quality of living? Individual potential for upward mobility?

I don't have answers to this question, but it's near impossible to achieve one criterion of success without making concessions to other ones."
news,fe6lh8f,t1_fe6kd5j,1578894885.0,Just because you acknowledge one side as bad doesn't mean you  can't acknowledge that the opposing side is also bad to a much lesser extent.
depression,fdff6r1,t1_fdfbk1l,1578360275.0,"Thanks, I hope things improve for you!"
depression,fde1e0x,t1_fde0sen,1578328987.0,"I also quit my job thinking it would make things better. The only thing I wanted this past year and a half was to succeed in my job. The realization that I had failed at something I wanted so badly was the last straw for me, and mentally I just broke. Like a switch flipped in my brain."
depression,fde112k,t3_ekwdxh,1578328754.0,"Two months ago I was in a similar situation. Stifled at work, manager seemed to hate me, no opportunity for advancement, etc. I saw the writing on the wall and put in my two weeks. Things aren't exactly better now for me, but if your job is that toxic to your wellbeing then you may be better off looking for other opportunities."
depression,fddzxel,t3_ekw7uf,1578328014.0,"Those sick people probably wouldn't want you to throw your life away for them. We all have our battles, best we can do is treat eachother with compassion."
depression,fcq1otb,t3_eigxpr,1577876820.0,"This is my excuse for not striving to get better, since I worry that without my issues my life would be boring and average. The thing that frightens me is that I would eventually feel okay with that sort of life, which is sorta equivocal to death in my mind."
cripplingalcoholism,fcdincb,t1_fcbd7ok,1577610356.0,cute!
depression,fc50awh,t1_fc4ykxw,1577436520.0,"Sure, feel free to message me. I'm pretty drunk right now so apologies if I don't reply since I tend to pass out around this time."
depression,fc4xxer,t1_fc4vis0,1577433205.0,"Thanks for offering, but I don't really need it."
depression,fc4vfsn,t1_fc4uz5u,1577430020.0,"Not really an option, I don't want them worrying about me and it would screw up my relationship with them"
depression,fc4dyk4,t1_fc4dktw,1577413894.0,"I never said I didn't care about my boyfriend, but my depression ended up straining the relationship to the point where he just wasn't enjoying being with me anymore. I don't blame him, but I wish I had focused on myself more before meeting him so he knew my best self. 

Maybe i'm just generalizing based on my own issues though, i'm really not a great authority on this stuff."
depression,fc4d7zb,t3_eg4twu,1577413281.0,"Thank you for sharing, these images are very evocative and creative! I really love the way that you convey your emotions through the use of color."
depression,fc4cz91,t3_eg3yr6,1577413087.0,Congrats!
depression,fc4cuf1,t3_eg4qv1,1577412978.0,"I used to wish I had a girlfriend/boyfriend, a car, and a job. I always assumed I would be alone and jobless forever. I thought that having those things would help cure my depression. Turns out I was still depressed despite obtaining these things and eventually I lost the car, job, and boyfriend. 

The point is, those things probably won't make you happy if you aren't already. It may be better to focus on yourself so you can enjoy these things once you obtain them."
depression,fc4cfc1,t3_eg41dm,1577412635.0,I would recommend a change of scenery. The happiest i've ever been was when I worked in a new city for a month. It was like I left my problems back at home and could try to reinvent myself because nobody knew me.
selfhelp,fc4bx0m,t1_fc4b3ap,1577412222.0,"Ah, okay. Sometimes addictions can be due to an issue with brain chemistry so I was just checking."
depression,fc46cao,t3_eg3r7i,1577407807.0,"I don't really have any helpful advice, seeing as I have the same plan for tonight. Just remember to drink some water to stay hydrated I guess."
depression,fc45xi1,t3_eg3fd2,1577407489.0,I appreciate other people venting because it reminds me that i'm not alone in this struggle.
depression,fc45rvm,t3_eg3ldp,1577407367.0,"You have a spouse, had a business, and were able to achieve sobriety for 9 years. You don't sound like a loser to me. 

You're stronger than you think you are."
selfhelp,fc45abl,t1_fc455wn,1577407000.0,"I would start by looking up online courses in coding or designing websites. If you find that you enjoy that sort of thing, then it may be a viable career path for you to pursue."
depression,fc44hji,t3_eg3aoq,1577406407.0,"Yes, I am also struggling with feeling 'lost' in life. It's not that I have nowhere I can go, but that I don't really want to go anywhere because none of the paths I can take seem rewarding or interesting. Trapped in our own expectations I guess."
selfhelp,fc443lg,t3_eg2e1l,1577406116.0,Maybe you are viewing relationships as a means to improve your life and not an improvement in your life in and of itself. How were your old friends holding you back?
selfhelp,fc43v8g,t3_efvz1m,1577405940.0,"You may have a problem with dopamine regulation and/or reward salience. Out of curiosity, do you have trouble completing tasks and paying attention to things you find uninteresting?"
selfhelp,fc43ift,t3_eg36p3,1577405676.0,"You seem like a bright and motivated person. I would recommend learning a coding language such as python or java and then possibly looking into web development. You can leverage your graphic design, video editing, and people skills to work with clients to help them sell their products online or create websites that take advantage of SEO techniques to drive traffic and generate income via amazon product referral links.

I've found that you don't quite need to be successful in entrepreneurial endeavors to benefit from them, many companies look for self-starting and self-motivated employees when hiring for long-term positions. Anything that shows that on your resume will be very important later on in your career."
totalwar,fbc0xq0,t1_fba2t6y,1576712979.0,"They have anti-crunch policies to ensure that their employees are not overworked and have adequate paid leave. Even if that means delays, it's better for their employees health and wellbeing. That alone makes them better than the majority of game development companies."
