However, I build PCs/teach people to build PCs fairly often. The vast majority I've worked with say something like ""my parent/child plays this game. I want to play that with them without spending 2k+"" Deal, I can do that for you. And I'll build it so you can upgrade it later on, instead of building a whole new tower.

The instant someone recognises the slightest disagreement in their methods of either and they become viciously defensive, if not outright offensive.

Before the hate brigade comes after me, no I'm not running around cramming budgeting/driving advice down peoples throats willy-nilly. These conversations have all been instigated by the other party, when their car breaks down, or when they ask for help making a budget. I've just stopped making myself available to give advice at all to people anymore.

Finally yes please make it be required. I'm not rich by any means but I do well with what I have, and I owe that all to my mom getting me interested in finance, and then the financial planning courses that I took in high school."

It's utterly ridiculous to me that you're using so much conjecture in favour of him by point out supposed character flaws in the victim. That's a red herring. It doesn't matter if she was an asshole, a brilliant civil servant, or as you said a saint. She was *murdered*.

todayilearned,fcudwul,t1_fcu8vem,1577978668.0,"It won't dispute intent, there's nothing to show he *meant* to kill her, but her murder could've been avoided if he hadn't been driving drunk. It's utterly ridiculous to me that you're using so much conjecture in favour of him by point out supposed character flaws in the victim. That's a red herring. It doesn't matter if she was an asshole, a brilliant civil servant, or as you said a saint. She was *murdered*. A life was snuffed out early because someone wanted to disregard the safety of others by driving drunk."

AskReddit,fctkx5f,t1_fct9dew,1577947040.0,"I think it's because most people don't strive for actual discussion on a daily or even weekly basis. Anecdotal of course, but most people I know just want to read some interesting life experiences, or funny stories. Which ideally the latter would go into a different sub, but as even this thread demonstrates, jokes and puns are the way to go to optimise ones daily upvote stipend."
Warframe,fctbztq,t1_fcsxvex,1577938548.0,"I've been told so many times that I'm a shitty fan for playing as you described, and it's nice to finally see it described in a non-negative way.

I still do wholeheartedly love WF, and DE, but I just can't play the same game daily for years and years on end. Like you said, I do hop on every single quest and play through it, and I do play for a few days afterwards, but aside from that I'm just chilling in stasis while Ordis flies us around the system exploring.

Anyways thank you for being a positive outlook on this sort of thing. Positivity seems so rare these days."

I've honestly been debating selling them, a barracks and an armoury, because right now the only fights I can actually win are the little fights in tournaments. This is getting a little long so I'll say cheers and I hope your day is going well."

It's a great way to bond and spread a little happiness into the world. The first game my little sister shared with me was Kya Dark Lineage, and I still think of it like I think of Jak and Daxter, even though it's been more than a decade since I played it."
