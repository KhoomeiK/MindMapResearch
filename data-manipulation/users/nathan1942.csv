politics,ffducr0,t1_ffd4ec3,1579829141.0,"Months ago there were 20 plus candidates. Now its down to 12 with only 3 having an actual chance of winning. If your candidate isnt Biden, Bernie, or Warren they arent competitive and will not secure the nomination. 

The situation has changed significantly over the past few months now that the primaries are about to happen. Bernie is the highest polling progressive in the race with the best chance of winning the nomination. All Yang can manage to do at this point is split the vote and be a spoiler. Same goes for any candidate polling in single digits."
politics,ffdtd5y,t1_ffdbin7,1579828439.0,"Bernie should tap Yang for VP. A young minority VP would give him broader appeal and set Yang up to run again or 4 or 8 years with better credentials and name recognition. It gives Yang a great opportunity to build off of Bernie's progressive policies.

Her polling has been flat for a while now and polling shows she has a worse chance of beating trump. If we want a progressive democratic candidate left leaning voters need to be able to unify behind one candidate in the primary elections.

All she is going to do if she continues her campaign is split the progressive vote and give Biden a greater chance of winning the nomination."

The VA rally may have been predominantly white, but you can find proof that the protesters represented pretty much all races and genders. Over recent years the fastest growing gun ownership demographics have been women and minorities.

The police found the terrorist in a boat in someones yard, but it could just have easily ended up being a hostage situation so i get why they went door to door.

That being said the police response was probably overkill. There was a lot of discussion after the fact about whether it was necessary to shut down the city or if it was more of a social experiment to see if the government could get away with doing so."

politics,feewumg,t1_fee89he,1579042946.0,"Most states don't allow them to strike and shut down schools, so they protest by only doing the minimum work per their contract. They don't enter school until it officially starts, leave when it officially ends, and don't partake in extracurricular activities or take any work home with them. It has limited effectiveness because it mostly impacts kids, not adults.

My cousin is a teacher and her union actually went on strike and shut down three schools. It lasted one day before their contract was renewed and the union was fined $100,000. So it can be very effective, but is typically a last resort."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feetvj2,t1_feeerf6,1579041100.0,"His campaign seems to be more focus on social media, facebook & twitter, and direct out reach such as knocking on doors, phone banking, and rallies. 

You won't see much in terms of ads outside of early primary states at this point, especially if you don't watch a lot of new channels. Historically he doesn't get a lot of news coverage, especially positive coverage, because his platform goes against the interests of the individuals and corporations who own the news networks."

We have already seen a lot of primary contenders parrot his views to some degree in order to court voters. If he were to win and just put the building blocks into place for these policies the next democrat would more or less be required to continue with his agenda, especially if he were to serve two terms."

I'm not trying to argue that you were not raped or that your feelings are not valid, I'm just trying to give some perspective.

Only you can decide if this is a dealbreaker for you. If he truly has gone no contact with the rapist and this is the only issue with the relationship then maybe you can put this behind you as the issue has been addressed.
