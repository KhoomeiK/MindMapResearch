Daytrading,fesk8kq,t3_eq03xg,1579366100.0,Equity futures often have some nice retracement around 15 minutes past the open.
Daytrading,fesjebj,t3_eqgupo,1579365794.0,"Yes buying on margin is essentially taking out a loan to purchase securities.

You pay interest on the outstanding margin balance. Rates typically vary based on amount borrowed. 

Margin can be useful in something like trading futures as you only need to put up 3k to control a 60k contract(crude) However it is not so great for longer term invetsments because the longer you use margin, the more interest you are paying and the greater return needed to break even. 


It is also important to understand what a margin call is. Margin is great because it allows you to increase your returns however it goes the other way as well. Losses are magnified on margin. If your assets decrease in value too much, you will have to deposit more money to maintain ownership.

Daytrading,fepnxkx,t1_fep4syl,1579325618.0,"I'm doing very well this year. Had some stumbles in December but crude has been very nice to me. I'm averaging about 20k takehome a month so far but that's extreme extrapolation haha. Since August I've made a decent amount in futures.

I started paper trading in August then used a couple thousands to started trading micros and was thrilled to hit $20 a day in September then I took on investment in October and its been up since then."
Daytrading,fepnrkc,t1_feplgti,1579325472.0,"I don't know what this means but at 20 contracts each tick is $200.

Most of my trades start targets at 2 ticks below entry. 1 tick on crude covers fees so that's nice.


I don't care about macro movements. I employ my strategy to look for entries and make my trades and walk away. This 3k was just over an hour of trading on January 17th.

Most of the time my trades are less than an hour. I usually trade between 1-3 times in a day to meet a target of 0.75-1.5% most of the time in on the lower end of that"
Daytrading,fepngg3,t1_feoz739,1579325219.0,"I started with es like most people then went to Russell and just recently switched to crude. My strategy seems to work better with crude.

Crude is extremely volatile which is great for my scalps but also dangerous if you get stopped out by a pop. So far I've been careful as i learn crude and have gotten fairly decent at determining when it will pop and by how much."
Daytrading,fepnbo5,t1_feozaew,1579325108.0,I manage a fund. I take on investment and trade with that. Currently it's just under half a million. 20 contracts is only about 65k I believe so most of it is not being leveraged under the current strategy so it's in longer term investments.
