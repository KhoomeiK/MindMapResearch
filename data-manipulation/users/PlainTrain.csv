AZURE,ffm8gpq,t3_eu5mjb,1580050295.0,"When I took it in October at a testing site, the lab part crashed and we had to restart the machine.  The timer rolled back to the time that I first entered the lab, and amazingly all the work I had done in the lab was still there.  That was a nightmare of a testing sequence.  The exam would crash about every fourth question so I wound up staying much longer than I thought I would.  Passed, though."

It's one of the most video gamey sequences in the whole movie.  That was one my complaints about TFA Poe was that they made him seem to be a better pilot than anybody in the older movies."

>The man was slowly fumbling with the bolt, hinge and staple, and as Jack stood there with his hands in the lower rounds, his sight cleared:  he saw that the broad street was filled with silent, attentive men, some in long togs, some in shore-going rig, some in plain frocks, but all perfectly recognizable as seamen.  And officers, by the dozen, by the score: midshipmen and officers.  Babbington was there, immediately in front of the pillory, facing him with his hat off, and Pullings, Stephen of course, Mowett, Dundas...He nodded to them, with almost no change in his iron expression, and eye moved on:  Parker, Rowan, Williamson, Hervey... and men from long, long ago, men he could scarcely name, lieutenants and commanders putting their promotion at risk, midshipmen and master's mates their commissions, warrant officers their advancement.
