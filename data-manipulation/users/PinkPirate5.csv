cats,fe0sxlg,t3_eknjrc,1578818230.0,"Update:  So Riker has calmed down a bit with the sucking over the past few days.  He still tries it a little when he sleeps but Moriarty has started kicking him off and he seems to take the expression of the violation of his personal space pretty well in stride.  I still sometimes have to seperate them at night, but he seems to be stopping to try and get back at him sooner, so I think he's getting the message.  I appreciate the help and advice."
startrek,fdfej9p,t1_fdevyaj,1578359832.0,... yeah I've got a more Klingon reaction to Tribbles personally.  Something about the pitch of their purring and trills rubs me the wrong way.  But I do love those episodes anyway.
cats,fdcrk8a,t1_fdbz54d,1578282302.0,"Benefit of the doubt if they were rescued from under a person's staircase or the like, they may be in the process of being treated.  I don't discount your position.  It is cause for concern.  But lacking further context from OP it's hard to know."
cats,fdcqr4j,t3_ekk3uh,1578281698.0,"Look at the tiny babies, eyes open and everything.  So cute.  Just want to love them forever and ever."
cats,fdcpjha,t3_ekd8ao,1578280803.0,Looks like you had fun with the nails.  All the more impressive if you've ever had to put on polish when kitty decides they want to 'help'.  :)
cats,fdco497,t1_fdcnmxa,1578279755.0,Yeah it's mostly been when they're lying down on the bed to sleep or getting up in the morning.  So far I've caught them early enough so the worst he's had has been some wet fur and a 'save me mommy' cry and look.  But thanks for the suggestion and I'll certainly keep keeping an eye on it.  They're sitting on either side of me right now and are just fine.
cats,fdcns0t,t3_ekfjor,1578279505.0,"Awww look at those adorable babies <3

Yeah, my mom was the same way before we had someone dump my first cat in our yard.  Their behavior is sometimes hard for people to understand cause it's very alien to human behavior.  But once you come to understand them, they really can just melt your heart."
skyrim,fdcm6y2,t3_eke1oc,1578278371.0,Wow this is an amazing rendition of the character.  Love the detail in the work.
