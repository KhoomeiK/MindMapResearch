fightporn,ffndtcx,t1_ffn2g3z,1580064616.0,"Context matters, but not as much in a case like this. A young fit man or in your case a young fit woman beating up an elderly person who in almost all scenarios won’t be able to fight back, passerbys will and should intervene. It would be different if it was two similar ages people who could have a fair chance against eachother but an old person could have a heart attack or whatever

Do I agree in the excessive beating of the attacker regardless of what reason they had for said attack?, no. Because I don’t really see death as justice (since head kicks can be deadly easily), do enough to render the situation safe for you and the victim then leave the rest to the law. 

But that still doesn’t make it ok to beat the shit out of an old person. Like I said, it’s also not ok to beat the attacker senseless as they might have been provoked. What if your friend had killed her aunt? Even if she deserved it, it wouldn’t have been right.

Also since you said context matters here, The attacker lured the old woman out of her home then took her onto the street and started beating and raping her, his defense was that he was drunk and thought she had broken into what he thought was his house, which doesn’t hold up as he knocked on the door and asked her to come with him to the street etc."

NetflixBestOf,ff7s8hx,t3_erz9l3,1579657099.0,"Having watched all seasons but 5 (which is to do with the point i’m about to make) I can say try it!

It’s the type of show that as it’s an anthology and the settings for each are drastically different (even time era etc) you might love 1 season and hate another. 

Personally I really loved season 2, 4 and 7 the most. I love the others but have some issues with 8 and 9 as 9 was just a little too silly for me but still fun!

5 for me is the perfect example of the “try it” part, I tried it, really didn’t like it and moved on. It didn’t make me like the show any less overall and allowed me to enjoy every season I watched.

So I’d say give it a shot, I see people saying it’s boring or low quality etc which tbh I’d just say that’s kinda bs, yea it’s not like a HBO series level of quality but you grow to love the actors and their characters in just 10-15 episodes which I love. 

Try out season 1, if you enjoy it fantastic, if not maybe just see if the plot of any of the other seasons interest you and try them. It’s really worth it even if you just find a season or two you like because I think it’s one if those shows you don’t “like” you love it or hate it.

I’m not sure which to go for as everywhere I look people say one is better than the other and some places say ine has X problems and another place says it doesn’t. I plan on using it for cosplay helmets (i know i’ll have to do them in multiple parts due to size i don’t mind that). I’d really appreciate some help as I’m buying it today or tomorrow and want ti make the right decision
twentyonepilots,fe9cc94,t1_fe8ltv7,1578936319.0,Nope? I don’t use twitter and tbh idk if I still have an account but maybe I should make a new one. Sorry if I got your hopes up haha
twentyonepilots,fe9bzax,t1_fe8s0cx,1578936198.0,It’s in the comment I edited it to save me replying to everyone. It’s the google drive link
cosplay,fe89hve,t1_fe85e8t,1578923959.0,"Tysm for the response! I nearly went for a decent resin printer that was at a good price but I’m glad I didn’t as Fdm just seems much simpler and better for my use and obviously like you said I’m a beginner at this. 

I plan on using the printer for helmets/masks and props mostly and for some reason I much prefer the idea of printing in parts than in one go, I just imagine it would be nice as you could be 100% happy with each piece and on more complex stuff you’d likely have to do parts anyway on a cheaper printer. I too am a bit of a freak for post work haha I’ll spend hours sanding the smallest thing to perfection. 

I like the idea of doing commissions! I’m not sure how i’d get started with something like that but i’d love to do it! (Etsy maybe? I’m not sure ;p). But I think that’s be a great idea as I could use some of the money to upgrade my pc which is currently a fire hazard more then anything haha and then save the rest for a future printer.

The Solo Blaster And Overseer Mask are really cool I love them. They were done on the Ender 3pro? Was the mask hard to do  and is it wearable? It’s awesome either way. I’d love to see the skyrim mask when it’s done or if you have any progress shots as I plan on doing some Skyrim and Dark Souls cosplays! 

I think you’ve just made up my mind on which printer I’ll get as I’d be paying nearly half and still getting a machine that ticks all my boxes so thank youuu!!! That’s at least €180 I can put towards getting an actual monitor. I’ll check out all the Ender models and see which one I like best, but from just a quick look and your comment I think the 3pro is the one i’ll end ho going for!

Thank you again, I really appreciate the help!"
twentyonepilots,fe86i35,t1_fe8685c,1578923086.0,Ahh tyy. I’m just happy to help out if I can. Hope you enjoy them!
cosplay,fe84ij6,t1_fe7ch22,1578922462.0,Do you use the Ender for cosplay? If so how do you find it size wise and print quality. It’s looking like I might not have the budget for the cr10s so I was thinking of opting for the Ender or Anycubic as they are really nicely priced. Thanks!
twentyonepilots,fe7zmfm,t3_eo32ti,1578920886.0,"I know it’s not as good as using Spotify but I have a google drive doc with all of Npi Rab and Deleted songs too (alternate versions and two, dollhouse etc).

If anyone wants a link I’d be happy to help out as I originally got it from someone else, although I might just start using Spotify for Rab as I assume you could add it to a playlist? 

I’m not sure but maybe someone could put the deleted songs onto Spotify using the google drive if it hasn’t been done already :P

Here is the link I was going to just dm but I didn’t expect so many of you to want it haha. u/DearCory u/BlackCrayon1 u/shrynk0 u/Ace_Hardwear u/MobyBrick (sorry for the mentions I just wasn’t sure if you guys would see the edit)

It’s a bit I impracticable as it’s audio files so you can’t use it like Spotify. But i’m sure you could upload them somewhere or format them differently to be able to have them in playlists etc. Hope you guys enjoy them! Srry I can’t give something better it’s the best I have :p"
cosplay,fe5u4eq,t1_fe5tk4t,1578874986.0,"I’m not sure if these are good or not or what they mean but this is what he has listed;

Silicon sock

Official Capricorn PTFE Tube

Official support rods for larger prints

TriangleLabs TL Smoothers with heat sinks with custom thermal silicone pads on base

Stepper Dampeners (Nema 17)

Stepper Motor Heat sinks (for enclosure printing)

I think that’s everything. It only comes to about €20 more expensive then buying from amazon and I won’t have to wait for shipping so as long as I can return it if there is issues I assume i’m better off going for this one? Also it has been setup and used so he knows it works fine and I can see it working before buing etc"
cosplay,fe5ste9,t1_fe5ezz1,1578874169.0,"Ah ok thanks. On amazon it is a bit cheaper but the guy I’d be buying from is including some upgrades which make it worth it and I’d be confident buying from him as he has lots of good feedback whereas on amazon whatever seller sells the cr10s through amazon (I use amazon uk) has bad reviews and apparently people aren’t getting all the parts etc. 

Fingers crossed I can get a return if I buy it local, I’ll ask tomorrow. As I’d much prefer not having to deal with the problems people on Amazon were having, 

Thanks again for the help"
cosplay,fe5erqo,t1_fe5ei7b,1578868547.0,I was going to be buying off a guy who lives about an hour from me who sells 3d printers. What’s the lemon rate? Sorry i’m not really that used to slang when it comes to stuff like this haha. I’ll make sure I can return it to him if there is something wrong with it before I buy.
cosplay,fe3oced,t1_fe3lqyt,1578851277.0,"Tysm for the response! 

I know in the post I mentioned a cr10s I can get for €380 but after looking into it do you think I’d be better off getting a cr10 (non S) for €300? 

From what I understand the main differences are you can’t change nozzels on the cr10 which only affects speed and the cr10s  has a system where it stops when it runs out of filament and has anti power outage features which are good for long prints. 

I’m very tempted by the larger area as I know i’d never need more space while the wanhao i might someday feel a need for more space but just not sure which of the 3 printers is most worth it for me, Is €50 more for the cr10 over the Wanhao worth the double printing area? This is my first 3d printer and I don’t really have the budget to upgrade for a good few years which is why I’m now sorta leaning towards the cr10

Thanks again for the help! I’m not well versed in this stuff so it’s nice to have someone who is!"
buildapcsalesuk,fdz6k78,t1_fdnweau,1578787167.0,Did it ship? Someone else said parcel motel doesn’t work with ebuyer but if it does that’d be great
fightporn,fdz4n0k,t1_fdysms0,1578786686.0,True but people have also died to less
fightporn,fdz48y8,t1_fdvie0f,1578786519.0,"Not to mention by the end the cunt he was beating was likely unconscious so probably wouldn’t hold up in court (and they were separated by the train so the guy no longer needed defence per say). So the head kick and punches could go to attempted manslaughter or whatever (idk if it would, but i’ve seen people say less is attempted manslaughter on this sub). I think it was fully justified until the head kick to the back of the head, understand why but think it was a little too far to potentially kill over spitting.

Edit: if you look at his legs it looks like he’s knocked out by the 4th hard punch. So that’s 3/4 hard punches and a back of head kick to a knocked out person on concrete, would that end up attempted manslaughter or? I guess it depends on where this is

Edit 2: someone linked an article and it seems he was fine after."

I wasn’t sure if the thing about seeds being legal was true or not but i’m glad to hear they are so then I don’t have to be super paranoid ordering. That site you suggested seems good so I’ll either buy from there or Irish Seed Bank, i’ll just have to research into what plant I want to grow and which ones are good for beginners etc or I might just make a post here asking for suggestions. thanks again I really appreciate it!"

I was thinking of buying seeds for a couple plants but wasn’t sure if the site is safe and reliable etc (I’m paranoid when it comes to getting into trouble as I never have haha), would you think it is?
