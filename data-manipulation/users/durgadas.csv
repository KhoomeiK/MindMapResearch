AskReddit,ffh751v,t3_etin5q,1579924991.0,"The general uselessness of ""beliefs"" altogether.

I've come to think of everyone walking around with some kind of ""beliefs"" they wear like armor as ridiculous and counterproductive.

Socially, we all interrogate each other for our ""beliefs"" so we can make value judgments about people in an overly simplistic manner.

At best, beliefs are working hypotheses... and practically speaking many working hypotheses are needed to work in the social ego world. It is tiresome, however.

I discovered a kind of freedom in not believing much of anything, consciously; and then mining out stuff from my childhood to place in a similar position. 

In transcending this addiction to ""my"" thoughts, I've noticed just how invested people are in ""their"" thoughts, ""their"" story and especially ""their"" conclusions. I think and I write a lot here and on Quora, but none of the conclusions I come to have a particular hold on me.

This came from a long time spent living in ashrams and learning about Yoga & Advaita Vedanta.

Treating beliefs like this then changes into taking the same general attitude toward thoughts- any thoughts, really.

What is interesting to me about this is that the preponderance of ""beliefs"" in a given area of human endeavor reveals a great well of ego and ignorance in that area. 

However, removing the beliefs and even investment in one's own thoughts is the work of the authentic scientist and religious person alike; despite the ""believers"" attempts to create dishonest false dualities.

Once I got to the point where I didn't feel much need to invest much even in the thoughts in my own head, I felt a lot lighter and less susceptible to the various lies of society today, which seem terribly insistent.

Perhaps this seems very abstract, but it's been 15 years of practice here, and it's probably the best thing I've ever done.

It is a very active position, as SO MANY especially on social media, seem to want to push one into proclaiming fealty oaths to various false dualities and create some allegiance to a particular set of similar conclusions.

The longer you look at this, the clearer the cynicism becomes, but even with cynicism, it requires a VAST level of wisdom to be cynical in the way Diogenes intended it, for example. There is a role for people wise enough to in some way 'transcend' society and poke holes in the weaknesses of society, for its benefit.

However, few have a balanced enough viewpoint to do this appropriate, but they will proclaim they are cynical or use what they believe to be cynical methods to simply find fault with things. Over time, this crass fault-finding has become known as cynicism; but it is not in fact.

There is an epidemic of similar distortions, outright lies, Dunner-Krueger narcissists, etc. but just... disagreeing with your own thoughts solves a lot of problems out of the gate.

MaliciousCompliance,ffgzh4g,t1_ffeu31o,1579919059.0,"My work place is... different. 

We were recabling and one junior tech who is fairly new was helping us, and despite me telling him NOT to unplug THIS SPECIFIC thing, and instead unplug the switches so we can move them around... he unplugged the backup Cisco UCM. HARD down. 

So, before I could fully troubleshoot it, my boss tells me to reboot the other one (aka assuming that plugging the backup server back in made it boot automatically) in the hope it will come back up and work again. I recommend, STRONGLY, that we NOT do that. The other techs recommend strongly that we not do that. ""This will literally break everything.""

Naturally, it doesn't come back up. I should mention that we had a consulting company put all this in for us, and they told us they were using two servers that run VMware and put all the various bits and bobs to run the system on that. 

Well, despite asking for this information for 6 months (I manage our other VMware infrastructure), I never got it. Boss doesn't demand it and generally ignores anything I ask for until THINGS ARE DOWN HARD.

So, TWO ESX hosts have been HARD down now, so the phones are buh-roke.

I finally get someone on the line from the consulting company and they finally give me all the info, and I login and see: Wow, the VMs are not set to autostart. No effing wonder. 

So now we've got split brain, etc. 

After two days of fixing it, it's done and I have more information now that I need to maintain my systems.

TL;DR: Boss.exe has stopped functioning.

Boss forces me to buh-reak shit so I can get him to realize that being reactive is NOT the way to go, and being PROACTIVE is far better. 

Of course, I've had to do this with every. single. thing to make progress, at any level. <headdesk>"

AskReddit,ffgvgjw,t3_etdal4,1579916081.0,"My wife has an Olympic Games medal, Pan Am Games and a Commonwealth Games medal. We go to Sports Halls of Fame events here and there and get special seats to stuff.

The Vancouver 2010 Olympics was pretty awesome as we had access to stuff non-athletes didn't really; and for a period, around other famous athletes, she gets respect and the honorifics she deserves.

I had the most memorable 'watching sports event' experience ever there, as we got to watch Canada beat the USA in Men's Hockey, in Canada at a Canadian Olympics, surrounded by the Women's Canadian Hockey team who had just won Olympic Gold the night before.

She shared City Athlete of the Year with Silken Laumann a couple of times, and so on. So, not SUPER famous except in her lane, and even though she's the first woman of Indian descent to ever win an Olympic medal that doesn't stop old white guys from savagely discriminating against her, even at her job.

So, brown women who are Absolute Legends get their fair share of shit, and her medals these days don't seem to count for much as far as getting ahead or earning more money. 

Even her students (she's a teacher) tend to say passive-aggressive and racist stuff to her when they do trivia like ""Which teacher has an Olympic medal?"" and when they find out it's her; they are confused at how a brown Indian woman can have an Olympic medal and usually ask her ""For what country?"" even though she's born and raised in Canada and was on the Canadian National Team for like 12 years.

Nevermind that her dad was also the reason Canada can be in the Olympics in Field Hockey, but was left off the team because of racism. That kinda shit is alive and well, even today.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There ARE some things that kinda show you 'the level' she's used to that happens sometimes, however. I think that something similar probably happens with many former athletes:

She used to coach her school's swim team, and I'd tag along to be supportive. As a former cycling athlete myself, the swimming thing is confusing to me, but she's lived that since she was 6 years old. So, in order to ease both my confusion and my general boredom, I'd try to pick a few people to track through the meets.

This one time, one of her best athletes was in second place with such and such a time in the male 18 category. Trying to be interested, I said ""So that's good, right?""

Her reply was telling: ""I did that time when I was 10.""

Oh, yeah. THAT Is The Level."

I didn't even know Novell-style stuff still existed before I worked here, but we're DEEPLY embedded with them, and still use Netware 6.5 for our main file servers.

We use eDirectory, Groupwise, GWAVA, GW-Retain and GW-Reload getting into Teamworks, Zenworks, iPrint for installing software on machines, etc. We have a wide range of file and other kinds of servers from NW6.5 to SLES 12 (and a few test SLES 15).

I'll be redoing our entire infrastructure with a brand-new eDirectory tree, new Groupwise, Filr servers, etc. So, I can probably answer a lot of your questions.

We seem to prefer 10-year-old or more solutions here, and proclaim our undying love for Windows 7 even past the date of its expiry... like Windows XP before it.

I seriously STILL have to maintain virtualization solutions that allow us to run 'products the boss is comfortable with' like XP and Netware 6.5.

We have AD, but use it just for Citrix and products that don't support eDirectory at all or cannot be worked around using LDAP."
