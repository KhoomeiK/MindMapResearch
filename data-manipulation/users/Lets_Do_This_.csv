The opposite, seemingly gaining fat while not eating enough, is literally against the laws of physics. There is simply no way to produce fat except by eating more calories than you burn in a day, and saying stuff like ""it's because he takes after his so and so's side"" is just a lame cop out for his eating habits. 

Try actually counting your calories for a bit. There are a lot of free apps that can help you. A ton of psychological/behavioral studies of ""naturally"" thin people simply found they were satiated by smaller portions and didn't consume as many calories outside of main meal times. Another common feature was them significantly underestimating how much they consumed as compared to others."

Also, it doesn't matter how stocky or thin your genes run if you choose to consume the amount of calories that will result in the build you choose to have. If they wanted to be thinner they could eat less and have that. If you wanted to be fatter you could eat more and have that, too."
