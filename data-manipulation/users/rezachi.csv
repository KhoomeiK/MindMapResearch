All of that is irrelevant, though. My cities teachers salaries are on public record, as are the details of the pay scales and benefits.

This CPA costed about $75 to prepare our stuff the way we wanted, so maybe a $35 difference. Their refund was greater than what I got with the same numbers on TaxSlayer somehow, so paying the $40 to do my own instead of the $75 for the pro would have actually cost us more money overall. 

Then, we started having problems with the agencies (IRS refund just sitting one year, state DoR mysteriously changing out status to married filing jointly for seemingly no reason and issuing us a check we weren’t owed another).

Get laughed at by wifey for being naked dude removing a round from a rifle. 

Our Ring had detected motion, but by the time it started recording there was nothing to see (this really made it hard to justify paying for the service anymore). Later investigation showed that someone had been in our front yard and vandalized a yard inflatable, but must have split when the light came on."

My wife woke me up when the alarm was going off, told me to check it out, and FUCKING STAYED LAYING DOWN IN BED.”"

I also add food and change the water at that time, so if I wander downstairs after about 10pm they both follow me down there. That’s their chill room with a bunch of random old furniture and shelves they can catloaf on to their heart’s content. 

If I need to get out quickly, I know exactly which room the cats are in and it doesn’t take real long to clear."

If you’re the type that generally charges the phone overnight, wireless let’s wake up, grab it to answer a text, and plop it back on the charger without having to be tied to the cord or mess with the plug in the dark. 

It’s not the solution if you want to spend as little time as possible in a charging state."

You can find that anywhere and be working the next day if you decide you don’t like the color shirt the manager had on that day. A lot of times you can even go back to the place you no-showed, since they can hardly find consistent workers even without DQ’ing people who quit."
GetMotivated,ff5sz6d,t1_ff5a832,1579609084.0,"That’s not the employer asking how long it took for your degree, that’s the employer asking about a 17 year gap in your resume. If I saw that, I’d assume it was a mistake or that you left the workforce to raise children. It doesn’t say anything about how long it took to get the degree. 

I don’t know your specific situation, but this doesn’t sound like the same situation as “worked full time while taking degree part time.” That scenario means that you would have had some means of supporting yourself over that time, why leave that off?"

Once I got past that filter, it was all interview skills and selling my abilities, but I disagree with anyone who says that the piece of paper had nothing to do with it. 

From that standpoint, I agree with your mom. But, I’d use common sense with it and try to learn something useful with the money I’m spending, not just go get a degree in “anything” just to check that box."

By that time, there isn’t a whole lot of people coming in behind you. 

Showing up at t-1:30 has worked great for me, I pretty much walk up to security at that point. I haven’t tried 1:00, but I’m sure it would be a policy thing I did show up that late."
