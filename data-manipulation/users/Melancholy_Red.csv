Just beware that MIL may try to get involved as you get closer to the birth. So have a plan just in case like no one else besides your husband in the delivery room and tell the staff including the nurses dealing with you not to let her in if she does show up at the hospital. Another great idea is if anyone asks and you know they will post it on social media or tell MIL give them a due date that is like 2 weeks after your real one."

fatlogic,fccchiw,t1_fccbg7d,1577596827.0,"The person I originally responded to was saying anorexia just meant underweight not that they lacked hunger. 

And no your also wrong the definitions of anorexia are:

lack or loss of appetite for food (as a medical condition).

an emotional disorder characterized by an obsessive desire to lose weight by refusing to eat.

Anorexia can just be used to describe the disorder without the nervosa part."
fatlogic,fcbx1pz,t1_fcbust1,1577591921.0,No you have no clue. Anorexia is an eating disorder that is often CHARACTERIZED by being severely underweight. It doesn't mean being underweight by itself there are other characteristics of anorexia not just being underweight.
