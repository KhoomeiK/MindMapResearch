Secondly, from a former smoker, quitting really only sucks for a short time. A days of feeling shitty, a week of feeling cruddy, then a couple months in, you start to appreciate the 'new' things, like the subtle smells and tastes you've been missing all this time (kissing, for one, is AMAZING after having been a smoker for a long time, you don't even realize what you're missing, plus your partner enjoys it more too!). Waking up after an undisturbed night of sleep is wonderful after years of smoker's cough. 

People around you start to notice, and some of those folks who tended to keep their distance no longer do because you're not a walking ashtray.  Nieces and nephews, your friemds' kids, they all wanna be around the cool uncle/whatever now because it's more pleasant. 

Then, bam, it's been a year and you realize your walk up the hill doesn't leave you feeling like there's an elephant on your chest. You don't twitch when you're upset with no access to smokes anymore. 

2 years in and you'll feel 10 years younger.

It's worth it. I promise."
