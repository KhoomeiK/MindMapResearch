AskReddit,ff2vhaj,t3_er59yq,1579525733.0,"So I made some online friends playing a few games when I was like 14-15 (mainly final fantasy 11 if anyone is curious).  We played a lot and I finally joined voice chats with them and they were pretty surprised I was a girl (never hid that but never explicitly said it either) but after a few awkward moments they seemed to get over it.

Fast forward another couple months and all of a sudden they decide that they’ve “put in a lot of effort to be my friend” and had that “girls are worse at video games so we’ve been bringing ourselves down to keep you in the group” kind of attitude.  And now I “owe them.”  So they demanded I send them pics (reminder that I was 15 at the time) and other weird shit and when I refused they got very aggressive about it.

Turns out I’d apparently given them enough info to go off of to figure out who I was irl and they proceeded to scare the shit out of me for quite some time after that."

theydidthemath,fengioz,t3_eq2ikd,1579284195.0,"Okay so I know you wanted the equivalent energy but idk how to calculate that.  But based on the image I’m going to say you could trick it into thinking you moved that total distance.

10km = 32808 feet and 4.788 inches (thx google)

Let’s just assume we’re talking about a male and he’s about 6 inches (I’ve heard that’s about the average?) and call that the “stroke length”

Every 2 strokes then would be 1 foot, so in 65617 strokes (rounded up to keep the numbers nice so it makes sense) he would trick the watch into thinking he had moved 10km (I’m not trying to figure out exactly how the watch would figure this out, but the watch physically moved that far)

So, to keep using the image, it would mean he takes 16404 strokes to finish each time.  So let’s assume he takes about 5 minutes to finish?  That’s 3280.8 strokes per minute or 54.68 strokes per second.  So to kinda answer your original question, very vigorously.

Edit: I’m going to emphasize that I clearly stated I wasn’t going to try to figure out how it measured this and was just giving the distance that the watch moved (more or less)"
AskWomen,fendhfa,t3_eq15b9,1579282342.0,"Omg finally a question I’m 110% capable of answering haha.  I had a pretty kick ass job at an amazing company and it was very early in my career so I have to say I was very lucky to get that job tbh.  I left to take a kinda crappy job (as far as jobs in my field go, and especially by comparison) so that I could move in with him.  Before that we were living like 3+ hours apart and it was driving me crazy.

I do not regret my decision overall, and we are now engaged.  That being said I still miss that job and can’t help but be a little resentful of what I had to give up (like if he ever complains about his job or anything).  I know we made the decision together and he didn’t force me to move or anything but still, I can’t help feeling that way sometimes.  Not to mention I just miss having a job I liked and feel like the stereotypical “girl giving up her career for love” kinda deal... not only was that job/company way better but I took a very big pay cut to move here too.

It was worth it but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t suck."

A lot of the men here have similar amounts of experience to me though, they’re not all more experienced.  Also there are like 2 other women here that I occasionally work with, but it’s like 95-99% men throughout the company.  So I can’t speak for how to manage confidence when everyone else has more experience than you, but on the whole just believe in yourself, it’s so easy to second guess yourself even on things you KNOW just because the environment is intimidating.

Maybe talk with him after about boundaries when you’re playing around like that?
