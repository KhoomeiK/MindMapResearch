mtgfinance,ffpcxu3,t1_ffp2wyh,1580091928.0,"No, they are limited by supply and demand, not their ability to generate new product. Designing more cards (creating more supply) does not increase demand. An upwards shift of the supply curve in fact decreases equilibrium price and increases equilibrium quantity demanded.

Think about how ludicrous the notion of being able to generate “equity” by making new sets is. Why does wizards do sets quarterly? why not weekly? Why not daily? If you can consistently generate demand just by making more cards then you would hire an infinite number of designers and artists and print a new set every minute!

So clearly they aren’t creating demand, they are working within some other hidden market mechanic. In the grand scheme of things they compete for entertainment dollars. In a narrower sense they have a captive market that they have to do enough not to lose. It’s a bit more complicated in the collectibles market but the basic economic principles remain. Any playable card is a weak substitute for any another playable card (yeah you probably don’t want a lightning bolt in a mono blue deck, but lightning bolts and counterspells are still substitutes in the sense that there’s a human behind the buying decision who derives a certain amount of utility and enjoyment from having either card)"
mtgfinance,ffozkky,t3_euesm4,1580083638.0,"The math here is fundamentally flawed. Wizards doesn’t create “equity” by printing cards; that wouldn’t make sense or else they’ll just keep making up new cards and make infinite money. “Equity” (terrible term for what it is in this case btw) is created by player supply and demand, which is largely driven by growth and aging (thus higher disposable income) of the player base. 

The only thing wizards can do to increase the value inherent in the system is to make a great game people want to play and continue to grow the player base.

In fact, reprints serve two purposes. The obvious one is that they are capturing economic value, and they are, but the less obviously but perhaps even more important aspect is that they want to keep the price points of eternal formats to a level where it’s not prohibitively expensive for younger players. I’m sure some WotC economist has worked out the math on when formats start dying because they are too expensive and make adjustments accordingly."

exercisepostures,fexsb8a,t1_fbikt7y,1579435365.0,"A lot of recent workout programs and studies are challenging the “to failure” conventional wisdom. There’s some additional gains to be had assuming correct nutrition but not as much of a difference as originally believed. There are also numerous drawbacks to working to failure every set or even every workout. Physically the risk for injury is higher, when you’re tired your form always suffers, and if you’re pushing yourself to failure then often you aren’t stopping when your form degrades. Working to failure causes the release of more cortisol stress hormones which affects your insulin sensitivity and glucose modulation. Psychologically working to failure makes you more likely to skip workout or cut programs short.

So basically the thinking is, yes, if you’re literally Adonis with the power of perfect form and the mental fortitude of an elephant then working to failure might get you the fastest gains. But for normal humans prone to human weaknesses and user error, it might not make sense depending on where on the continuum you fall.

changemyview,fe0e3rm,t3_endtgg,1578811515.0,"At first I saw this CMV and thought - What a selfish a--hole. But after thinking through it further, this is actually a really good CMV. So here's my shot at it.

Legally you don't owe your country anything (besides tax dollars). By staying in your country to agree to all the rules of the country, including defending it should the need arise. But in most of the western world, if you don't want to, you can choose to leave and renounce your citizenship at any time up to the point an enemy invades and a draft actually occurs.

You also don't owe your parents anything. You don't have to treat your parents with respect, no court of law will convict you for being disrespectful to your parents. Some eastern countries with strong family values have court opinions which held children responsible for the care of their elderly parents, but generally only if they've obtained some benefit from their parents after the age of majority. Certainly if you were estranged from your parents at 18, no court of law will find you responsible for their care.

So clearly the problem you're having isn't legal indebtedness, you even point that out yourself when you tried to justify that ""there is nothing wrong with that morally""

So you kind of hit the nail on the head. This is a moral and ethical issue, not a legal issue. Your morality is your own. The fact that you are even bringing this up shows that your moral compass says that you should feel bad about not being responsible to your country or your parents. If you were a truly cold-hearted person you could just walk away from whatever civic or familial obligations you have, as many many people do every day, without ever having to post a CMV on reddit. So in that sense, no one needs to change your view, because your view is already that these things matter."

In a digital connection everything is a 1 or a 0. Electrons more instantaneously and precisely. The transistor has 2 states - open or closed. Combining transistors gives you 6 basic deterministic logical operations. Transistors are etched on a flat surface in a 2D layout where you barely ever have to consider physical interactions besides shielding. The brain isn’t like that. There’s a continuous scale of permeability of receptors, there’s the physical 3D layout between neurons and the shape of the synaptic cavity as well as the shape of dendrites. All of these things “change” the map of connectivity of the brain.
