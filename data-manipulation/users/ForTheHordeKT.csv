AskReddit,ffalbzf,t1_ff958ax,1579738619.0,"That's why raising the minimum wage is like doctors just merely treating a symptom of a disease rather than focusing their efforts on eradicating that disease to begin with.  Yeah, min wage is not enough to live off of.  But that's exactly how it's gonna go down.  They'll raise min wage, maybe have one golden year of enjoying how nice it is to finally live affordably, and then everything else will rise to keep the status quo as it had been when min wage wasn't affordable.  We need to stop being so pissed off about WHAT min wage is, and start getting pissed off over WHY min wage is no longer sustainable."
TwoXChromosomes,ff8ntin,t1_ff83ou9,1579687923.0,"Yeah, the whole time I read that I was going ""Huh... that sounds kinda rapey to me... Ok, *that* was pretty damn rapey too.  Uh... holy shit I think I just read about a fucking rape.""

Yeah, being held down and screaming and fighting someone off while they just fuck you harder and faster is absolutely, 100% rape."
tifu,ff7qkkf,t1_ff5ybmb,1579655944.0,"Yup, can confirm.  Built one crazy badass gaming rig earlier last year.  GF spoke of wanting a desktop PC instead of the laptop she uses.  Offered up my old desktop which wasn't a bad PC, just not the absolute gaming beast I run now.  She accepted the offer in order to save some cash.  What did I do?  Backup all my shit onto my external HDD I wished to keep and then I formatted that motherfucker and reinstalled Windows.  She don't need to see the atrocities to mankind I had saved on that old HDD."
personalfinance,ff4hyxa,t1_ff4f0nh,1579564061.0,"Yup, you don't quit jobs near as much as you quit people.  If the people running the show are toxic, condescending assholes who just can't seem to pull their heads out of their asses then I don't care how much you love WHAT you do there.  You're going to be miserable doing it.

I've managed to lessen the effects of mine by being a raging asshole right back at them.  Seems to be what this place thrives on.  If you aren't a raging asshole, you get eaten alive.  The trick is to be an even bigger asshole than everyone else.  But now I find myself going in to work getting all worked up by a bunch of assholes and then doing what I can to be an even bigger asshole back so they get just as pissed off as I am but lay off for a bit and by some fucked up measure they seem to respect it.  And now I'm another asshole at work in a place full of assholes.  Not really what I want at all."
TalesFromRetail,ff2md7q,t3_er4zks,1579513105.0,"Yup, it's amazing when you no longer give a fuck because you know you'll be gone anyways.  Or if it's some kind of side gig you don't really need.

The last time retail was my main job, I was quitting Home Depot to move on to working in gas/oil jobs.  I wasn't store-side, I was on the MET team.  If you ever see a clusterfuck of orange shirts down an aisle, they're the MET guys doing all the merchandising stuff, setting planograms, taking on all the projects and the general idea is that this mostly frees up the store-side people working the floor to help customers.  That said, the general shopper didn't know this and always approached us anyways because we stuck out like a sore thumb clusterfucking the aisles the way we did, and honestly why wouldn't we help if asked?  I mean I have no idea how to build a patio deck or install a toilet so I'm going to the store-side guy for that, but I'm all up and down these aisles.  I can tell you where nearly anything is.

So I get this guy out in garden while I'm working those bays who storms up to me and declares ""I guess YOU decided YOU don't want to carry any more tripod sprinklers!""  I can already tell how this is gonna go, and I bite back some sarcastic remark about how yup, I knew that YOU specifically were coming in today and when we all met to concoct our diabolical schemes, I had spit-balled out there about how great it'd be to fuck this one particular guy out of some tripod sprinklers.  So I tell him I've recently seen them, but suggest that perhaps we are out of stock and we should have a look.  I walk him over to where they are and surprise, an empty spot where they go.  This guy is absolutely fuming at this point, and asks me what good that does him.  He's lecturing ME about how I need to do my job and keep up on the ordering and now I'm getting a little sick of him.  I tell him let's scan the onhand count and see what we see.  The system shows 1 in stock, but this thing is never right.  I look up in the overhead, and even ask someone store-side working out there if they saw the damn thing.  They tell me no, it's out.  They were looking earlier and couldn't find it either.  So now this guy is going full on tantrum mode and like an idiot, I'm still convinced I can calm this dumb fuck down.

So I tell him I'm sorry, there are more of these on order.  I show him the little truck icon on the PDA and click into it, he can see in two days the date of the next shipment coming.  This isn't good enough for him, because hey.  If working retail has taught me one thing it's that you can change reality and the whole space-time continuum around you if you try really hard at being the whiniest little bitch you can be.  If that doesn't work, then you weren't trying hard enough, right?  So I tell this douche that some of our other locations probably have some in stock if he really wants one today.  I was living in Utah at this point working the Riverdale store.  We had the Ogden and Layton stores very close by.  I pull up the counts of nearby stores and show him that Ogden has something like 4 on-hand, but Layton has 15 of them.  My advice is we saw how on-hand counts can be a little off, but I really doubt it'll be off by 15.  Layton is going to have one for you for sure.  So he asks how far away Layton is and I tell him not far, just shoot down the I-15 a bit and get off at Hill Airforce Base exit, blah blah.  Practically run right into it.  He demands to know how long it'll take and I tell him eh, like 10 minutes at the most.

This is where he just goes absolutely apeshit and screams at me, and where I am just fucking done with this asshole.  He goes ""NO!  HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE **YOU** TO GO TO LAYTON, GET IT, AND BRING IT BACK HERE TO ME!""  So I just laughed right in his face and told him I wasn't going anywhere.  ""So my time isn't worth shit then?""  My response; ""Nope, sure isn't!  If you want, I'll get a manager over here and you can see if they feel like sending someone out there for you.""  That was when he resorted to calling me a stupid lazy idiot and so I told him ""You know what, you got 3 options with this stupid thing as far as I see it.  You can go to Layton, you can go to Ogden, or you can go to hell!  I really don't give a damn which!""  He stormed off and I guess left.  He could've went to Layton or Ogden I suppose, but I kinda hope he went to hell LOL!  I thought for sure he'd bitch and I'd hear something about it, but I didn't.  So either he just stormed out of the store or they were all fuck this kid, he's leaving anyways.

I have plenty of retail war stories but by far out of everywhere I've lived, the fuckers who shopped out in Riverdale, Utah were by far the biggest, most entitled and abusive fucks I have ever seen!"
IAmA,feoubuf,t1_feofhcr,1579305618.0,"Agreed, we both were victims of some quite unfair trauma.  I think in my case being so young, I must've repressed a lot of the memories.  Like, I remember pointing to this non-disposable rubber douche bag with a flower print that must've been pretty common etching on those things because there was one hanging in the shower at our house (my mother had divorced my biological father by that point and we lived at my grandparents).  My biological father must've had that same douchebag at his place, because I do actually remember pointing this thing out and calling it the ""flower thingie"" and describing it being used to basically douche out all the uh... evidence from my asshole after his acts.  To paraphrase it in the jaded curse-laden words of a 36 year old man now.  I remember my mother being stunned and her wtf moment.  To hear things be told much later as an adult though, I had a great grandmother who had retired from working as a social worker and she was the one who ended up spurning my mom into action.  I guess my mom was just like ""I don't know why he would say that or what to believe..."" until my great grandmother said ""Look, he's 3.  He's too young to even have a single notion of those kinds of acts.  Why would he just get that in his head?""

I remember bits and pieces of that time, but not the whole of it.  But I dunno, I guess mostly I had responded and shared my own experience because to be honest, like I said I was a lot younger than you during my experience.  And our experiences weren't exactly under the same conditions.  But I guess I mostly hoped to give you comfort by sharing my own experience and saying that if this quite understandably haunts you a lot, that there's hope moving forward that you will be able to go a long time in your life without even giving this shitty thing a second thought.  I'm pretty happy with my general life, it helps that ever since then this piece of shit has never been in my life again.  But I really never even think about it at all unless the topic comes up.  I still get angry when I do think on it, if I ever saw him and recognized him I'd probably end up in jail for beating him within an inch of his life.  Guess it's good that I started my childhood out in California and life as it went on has brought me way out to Michigan and I will never run across him by weird chance.  But by and large, I just keep on keeping on and am pretty happy in general.  I hope that you will be able to say the same.  By even making this topic, and speaking out and getting this word out you are damned brave."
IAmA,fenu9q2,t1_femv6ks,1579290833.0,"I'll be honest, no clue lol.  It's the US I'm in.  But fuck him.  I don't need shit from him anyhow."
IAmA,fems7k7,t1_femoonr,1579268107.0,"Won't argue the truth of that.  But being in a victim's shoes and having a good idea of where they are at mentally and emotionally after such a thing.  I can understand why someone wouldn't.  I think a lot of whether you do or not also can bank heavily on how much support you'll have from those around you.  But also, whatever your wishes are as the victim are ought to be respected."
IAmA,femkmlr,t1_fem36ia,1579260301.0,"I know where you were coming from though when you didn't press charges.  My biological father molested me when I was a toddler.  My mother fought huge custody battles in court to keep him from me and I'm glad our whole family rallied around us to make sure I never had to see him again.  One of my aunts in the 80s was one of those hardcore punk rocker chicks and while she looks a little more formal these days, she hasn't lost her blunt in your face mannerisms LOL.  She would run into this fucker at a store somewhere and loudly be all ""Sicko!  Freak!  Fucking child rapist!  You are a sick fuck!  Sick fuck!""  And just publicly shame him into leaving for his car any time she ran into him anywhere.  My grandfather took an even crazier turn.  He was one of those angry redneck Texan types you really don't want to piss off.  He drove around with a few guns in his van and if he ran into him, he was dead set on killing the motherfucker until one of the neighbors at the business they ran out of that industrial lot called the cops on him because he didn't want to see him ruin his life murdering the fucker.  But damn, I can honestly say I had someone willing to kill a motherfucker for me at one point.  There were plans in place to run off with me out of state with some other family members if the custody battles didn't go well, but luckily he lost his visitation rights and I've never had to see this son of a bitch again.  Last form of contact I ever got was maybe 15 years ago or so, some random document was mailed to me.  Apparently he changed his will in order to specifically call me out as not being a beneficiary of anything despite being his son.  Fine by me, I don't want any of his shit.  Just continue to fuck off and stay out of my life, or else I'll curb stomp your goddamn head in the second I see you.

But we decided when I was that young (about 3 years old when it happened) that we didn't want to pursue him criminally at that time and dredge it all up and put me through that.  I've largely put it all behind me now and rarely really even think about it until I run across the topic, to be honest.  And it still pisses me off in one way, yet in another it was so far back in my childhood and I've moved on and done so much since then that I'm also past it.  So I can at least offer that much solace to you.  Do what you need to do to get your closure and resolve it for yourself.  I guess for me and my family, our big win was just getting my biological father's visitation and custody rights taken away from him so he could no longer even be a part of my life.  I think you might have it a little harder than me, I mean I was so young and you were a lot older in your incident.  But, I can at least offer you that there will come a day when you find for the most part life goes on and you're able to keep on keeping on and this won't even really come up to haunt you until the topic gets brought up, if that helps."
AskReddit,femise9,t3_epr0g5,1579257724.0,"I think it could be a good investment.  Not only would it show you how petty the people that you surround yourself with can be, but you can also learn a lot about yourself if you approached it pragmatically with some thick skin and were willing to be open-minded and accomplish some self improvement.  Not to mention, there's going to be some positive reinforcement in there too."

Who'd have thought giving birth meant you were also expelling out of your vagina any other interest that didn't fall in line with cooking and parenting how-to's.  I'd have said some shit like ""Oh, this old thing?  Well, I just finished reading up on how to mind my own fucking business and after that, this was the only other thing I had laying around the house.""

My mother was an avid reader as well.  I think she definitely imparted that on to me.  As a young boy she would read out loud to me and once I was old enough to read myself, I remember her having me read out chapters to her.  Shit, even in my teens if we were on a long drive she'd suddenly be all ""What do you have right there?  Start reading it out loud.""  And then usually she'd want to borrow the book from me once I was done with it lol."

AskReddit,fef5uv0,t1_feec3q4,1579048897.0,"Yeah, fuck it.  I've considered the same.  And my GF gets all shitty with me sometimes because I like to drink beer after I get home just about every day.  But my thing is this; I grew up in a house with alcoholism.  Yeah, I like my indulgences.  I have quite an indulgent personality.  This goes with my beer, good food, even things like video games or my car.  But here's my logic.  I bust my ass.  I work hard, long hours.  And I still get shit done at home.  Yeah, I drink a lot of beers after work.  

But I grew up in a home with an alcoholic.  My mother was the nicest person you would ever meet.  She wasn't very confrontational, it you REALLY had to get her at her wits end and backed into a corner before she snapped at you.  She put up with way more bullshit from people than she ought to have.  When she was sober.  Get her drunk, and holy fuck man.  All that repressed anger came right the fuck out and it didn't matter if you were the cause of her anger or not.  Look out, and don't provoke her!  God damn that stuff turned her into one mean bitch!  

And I remember at the height of her problems with arthritis, and shitty things going on in a dysfunctional home, she was always perma-drunk.  She would start shit with everyone, go out and drive just completely fucking sloshed.  For a large chunk of my childhood we lived out in the middle of fucking nowhere.  Like, driving an hour just to get into town because we were out in the sticks.  We lived in the foothills just below the Sierras out in CA.  [There was this winding-ass curvy road along what could sometimes be a pretty decently raging river at certain times of the year, and here's the street view if you wanna check it out, this is a ways below Pine Flat Lake.](https://www.google.com/maps/@36.8178136,-119.3879186,3a,75y,170.9h,80.83t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s4OL4XktN04t9rZg7PXnamw!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo0.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3D4OL4XktN04t9rZg7PXnamw%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D192.01755%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656)  I have no fucking clue how we never ended up going over the side of that road and into the water.  It's nuts.  She'd take this winding curvy road with us kids in the car just fucking TANKED!  She was argumentative, started shit.  Could get violent.  After a while she couldn't even show up to work sober, she lost more than one job because of it.

I am none of those things.  I don't start shit when I drink.  I am civil.  After more than one beer forget it, I'm not driving anywhere.  If I know we got a few places to go after work, then I don't want to drink.  There's been plenty of days I have no more beer in the fridge and on my way home I'm just too tired and irritable to stop at the store, so I say fuck it.  I'll do without.

All of that makes me feel comfortable with it.  There's a difference between being indulgent, and being an alcoholic.  When it starts affecting your work and relationships.  When you're faced with situations where for some reason or another you can't have a drink and that really pisses you off and then you go through extra lengths to make sure that doesn't happen.  When you start being a dumbass, doing stupid shit and jeopardizing aspects of your life.  All of those are signs you need to sit down, be honest with yourself, and reconsider things."
AskReddit,fef3poh,t1_feehro2,1579047450.0,"Yeah that's the key.  With no minimum specified % then it really just boils down to finding something low.

Or shit hahaha, how about those tiny little Coronitas?  Those things are tiny as hell!  This thing didn't say how big the beers in the 12-pack had to be either.  I could probably pound down 12 of those real easy with little effect, be more like drinking a 6-pack of normal sized stuff."
AskReddit,fef3332,t1_feeblfa,1579047030.0,"Hahaha for real!  Exactly my thoughts.  I mean I drink 3-4 after work typically over the course of me chilling at home before bed, and these are fucking 8%.  This thing didn't specify what kind of beer.  So I just buy shittier beers and probably break even.

Hell, if I still lived in Utah this would be even easier.  The beer they sell at their grocery stores and gas stations is straight-up watered down piss-water unless you're buying one of the Utah brewery brands.  If you want normal strength of any of the other beers, you're going to a state-run liquor store and a lot of those fuckers seemed to run banker's hours during the weekdays (well, more like noon-7pm although one or two stayed open till maybe 9 or 10pm at least in the Ogden area) and even shorter hours on Saturdays.  And they all stayed closed on Sundays lol.  If you want the hard liquor or wine, forget going to a market or convenience store.  You're only getting that stuff at the state run stores.  Now that I live in Michigan, it is SO much easier to get my beer and I don't have to go to a special store to get full strength beer or hard liquor.

I feel like especially people who live in states with laws like Utah's, this wouldn't really be a hard challenge at all haha."
personalfinance,feeomb8,t3_eolsxr,1579037982.0,"I feel you.  I had my stepfather do the same shit to me.  I had been working and paying my parents rent too the second I turned 18 (and my birthday is in April).  Only I found out after my taxes got rejected.  Being a young 18 year old and not having a place like Reddit to get some solid advice from, what I elected to do instead was take the amount I got fucked out of recieving for my tax return by having to file as a dependent and deduct it from the next rent check I gave him.

TalesFromRetail,fed3ywe,t1_fe9e2kd,1578997649.0,"True.  That said, people like this need to get the shit kicked out of them by somebody.  But I think deep down they know this about themselves.

If they catch themselves just treating anybody like shit that they interact with outside of a place of business, they're liable to get clocked right in the fucking jaw.

Not worth losing a job over these miserable piss ants though.  And it's good the manager didn't feed the bullshit.  Another reason these people consistently act like such immature children is that they often receive special treatment to just shut them up, and the behavior gets rewarded rather than them being told to go piss up a rope and never come back."

AutoDetailing,fdvsm14,t1_fdsd7hg,1578751102.0,"Yup, back when I bought my old '06 Mustang I used to have, I had initially found some ad claiming to pay up to $400 a month to wrap your car in an ad.  I'm going shit man, that'd pay this new car payment AND the goddamn insurance!  If it's too good to be true, it usually is though.

I was dumb enough to tell them what I drive and to give them my address.  The alarm bells went off when I get a $2200 check with instructions to mail $1800 off to some address that wasn't even in my damn state.  This would be payment for the auto specialist to contact me once they received my payment to come in and apply the ad wrap.  The remaining $400 out of that $2200 I was to keep in as my first month's payment.

I'm going bullshit, why aren't YOU paying the guy?  Why make it complicated?  So I look up this address I'm supposed to send payment to.  It's a house for sale.  These guys were using this address as a mail drop for their scammy shit because they knew the place was vacant.  I called up the realtor and let them know they should probably check out the mailbox frequently.  And I emailed the scammer and told them to get fucked, I was on to their bullshit.  The check would have appeared to go through, I'd have sent off my own legit $1800 and then my bank would have rescinded the $2200 deposit when they figured out the check I had deposited was bogus.  That's how the scam works.  Oftentimes they have you use shit like Moneygram, Western Union, or send off cashiers checks and shit.

I don't want them in my life.  And I wouldn't date anyone who had them just to make sure I can keep on avoiding being around them.  Call it what you will, but someone with an attitude like me should certainly not be raising children.  It's a choice.  Is it one that sounds somewhat selfish and bitter to make?

Guess that happens when the whole damn thing is privatized.

Poor dude probably needed a phone in order to get back out there and go on the hunt for a job and actually be able to get called back if someone wanted to give him an interview.

I'm not against pulling my weight around the house and helping out.

Then cops this attitude when I finally get home about all this stuff she's done and how I'm the biggest asshole for wanting to sit down and chill for an hour or two after putting in a longass day of physical work.

But I suppose it's kind of the same how I am neither republican or democrat because there's things on both sides that I am for and against.  On this particular issue, I feel strongly that its our right to own firearms.  I think a government who wants to take that away is about to do something that they're afraid is going to make their citizens want to shoot them.  That was kind of the spirit of the whole 2nd amendment, to make sure the citizens were equipped to deal with a government that went all tyrannical on them and a sort of check to make sure that government wouldn't even want to get to that point.  I'm not asking for a damn tank to be parked in my driveway and to have some surface-to-air missiles installed in my back yard, but I do think we should be armed somehow.

I'm not sure why all these shootings all of a sudden have become more prominent than they used to be.  Is it because society is just becoming that more debased than it used to be?  Is it that this has always been a thing, but now we have more information and news coverage right at our fingertips to be able to see, hear, and read about things on more of a global scale rather than being isolated to just simply local news for the most part?  If you'll indulge a more drunken musing of mine at the moment (hey, just got off work after a long thing and beers till bedtime is kinda my thing) then shall I put on a tin foil hat and suggest that this sudden surge of mass shootings is an orchestrated attempt to get us all up in arms over allowing our gun rights to be revoked willingly?  I honestly don't know.  I got no answers.

I will say this though.  There's the part of me that feels gun ownership needs to be kept as an available right to all.  But there are also some really shitty people out there who should not have access to them.  Some people are just pieces of shit, and for others it's a matter of mental health.  

I will say this.  I'm a registered gun owner.  I could go out right now and order an 80% finished lower receiver.  That's the part of the gun that makes it a *GUN*, as defined by law.  They had to sit down and decide what part of the gun is a gun, and what part is just parts and accessories to that gun in order to upgrade or change that gun.  So the lower receiver was decided.  It's the part that takes the ammunition, has the firing pin in it, etc. etc.  All the rest of the gun is just the barrel, the grip, etc. that can be changed out or swapped and upgraded.  So the lower receiver of any gun is the part that has the serial number and is what makes it the gun.  Someone somewhere decided that as long as it isn't more than 80% finished (as in, manufactured) then it doesn't count as a completed gun that has to be registered.  So if you want an unregistered gun, all you need to do is order an 80% finished lower receiver, follow some instructions to bore out the rest of it yourself, then purchase the rest of the ""accessories"" yourself from a gun store like the barrel, grip, etc. to complete the gun and bam, now you own a gun that never even had to be registered.  I could do that right now, and have a whole other AR15 nobody even knows about.  Go ahead and take the one I own that is registered.  I can still have one under the table that nobody knows about until I intend to use it.  That shouldn't be a thing.  So until that gets nipped in the ass, the rest of this shit is useless.  Until we change that, then all we're doing is keeping these guns out of the hands of those who would be law abiding citizens properly registering their guns with no ill intent.  The ones who have worse intentions will still have a way to get what they want.  That shouldn't even be an option at all.

Also.  To address the mental health aspect of it.  Crazy as it sounds, I would be willing to submit to a mental health check of some kind.  Make it once a year, make it twice a year.  I don't know.  To keep your guns, submit to some kind of analysis.  If it cuts down on shootings then I'd be down.

No, it's not practical.  Shrink that shit down to 5-10 rounds and you wouldn't get a complaint from me.  That is the only thing that makes these guns any more deadly/worse than any other gun.

I load up 5 rounds in the mag, send my paper target downrange, pop off the 5 rounds.  Zip the paper target back up to me to examine the cluster of where I hit.  Mark my holes off with a marker so I can shoot up that paper target some more and see if my next 5 landed where I was aiming them without confusing them with the last 5.  5 at a time, nice and slow.  5 bullets empties my clip, and I just put another 5 back in to go again.

I was late rushing to work and of course this occurs.  So I wad a thing of toilet paper and shoved it up my nose to plug that damn until it quit, and kept on rushing to get ready.  It had finally subsided, so I chucked that thing in the toilet.  Toilet is gross as fuck, so I'm not touching it till I'm done brushing my teeth.  Well, after I brushed my teeth I rushed on to grabbing my things and running out the door.  Forgot to flush a bloody twisted up snot-rag plug thing and just got ranted to when I got home about how disgusting it was.

And that set me off.  I pointed out how the seat and front of the toilet looks like a fucking sacrificial altar every time her period starts and that's totally OK to leave the toilet like that, but one late and stressful morning I have running out the door and a bloody toilet paper gets left in there and I'm the worst motherfucker in the world for it?  Hell no.  As long as we're bringing it up, let's go ahead and talk about the state we both leave the toilet in...

To her credit, I haven't seen it bloodied up since that day and I am a lot more conscientious of flushing any nose bleed rags before running my ass out the door in the morning."
TalesFromRetail,fc536lb,t3_eg2q6r,1577440757.0,"Heh, got that at CVS all the time when I last did retail.  Like motherfucker, when it comes to someone deciding on prices I am at the very bottom rung of this ladder.  They don't give a FUCK what I have to say or think about prices charged.  So bitching me out isn't going to accomplish a damn thing.

Luckily it was a gig I was doing on the side over the weekends, so it was a nice bit of extra income I didn't NEED.  And I didn't NEED to put up with their shit while I rang them up.  So I'd get all dickheaded and be all ""Yup, price is rather steep isn't it?  Oh, [insert any other place here] has it for cheaper?  Oh, I'd definitely be buying this there instead then if I were you.  Why'd you come here to buy it if you already saw it over there?""  I mean bullshit, motherfucker.  I could see going to the store anyways vs. online for the instant gratification and not waiting for shipping, and then trying to weasel in some kind of price match.  You can still get fucked with that shit, but OK I'll give ya that one for the attempt before I tell you tough shit.  But to sit there and tell me you were shopping elsewhere, didn't grab what you needed there, and just decided to come way out of your way here for the extra stop?  Get the fuck out of here, no you didn't!"

TalesFromRetail,fc2gabw,t3_efnlb3,1577358572.0,"I never saw just how ridiculous people can get till I worked a market out on a lake.  Bass Lake, out in the Sierras.  About 14 miles south of Yosemite's southern gateway.  I lived in a little studio under one of the gift shops down the row of little storefronts at that lake.  One of my more fond times of living, although it sucked for a couple reasons as well.  For one, when they needed some help on my day off, all they had to do was come over and knock in order to try and ""call me in"".  But, on the other side of that spectrum the store manager was cool on the occasions I told her ""Shit, I'm kinda chillin here drunk off my damn ass right now.""  And she'd go yeah, well that's what days off are for right?  Nevermind then, just thought I'd ask!  And that'd be the end of that.

The other drawback is even if I did remove my work shirt, there's a lot of locals that also hit that market up all the time.  Wasn't just the camping and lake visiting tourists.  So I'd be recognized as an employee by people even if I was wearing just plain clothes and I'd be standing outside my apartment smoking a cigarette or bullshitting with some regulars at that bar next door.  Hours after the place closed and they knew damn well living there a lot longer than I did over what time that market closed.  Did not stop them from going all zombie at the gates outside the door for like 10 minutes before spotting me and begging or insulting me to unlock the door.  Sorry, even if I wanted to I got no keys to the place!  And I don't want to, I'm off now!  Just gonna have to suck it up and drive like 15 minutes to Oakhurst.  Be glad we weren't so far up in the sticks of the Sierras that it'd take like an hour or some shit just to commute to the kinds of chains that stay open 24 hours."

We all had Xmas eve dinner at her aunts' house, and we all exchanged gifts of books to each other.  They weren't part of the rest of Xmas' gifts, this is pretty much its own thing we do right after dinner.  I instantly liked it last year when they had first told me about it."
