Your biological sex is different from sexuality. It is a part of you. If you are to be a well rounded individual, you must know how to work with your biological sex and, learn how to act.

You don’t get it. I’m saying shut up about sexuality. It doesn’t define who you are.

No, they don’t deserve anything. They are like the rest of us. If they have a problem, they can use the same things we use. The ABC123+ community is stupid. They don’t deserve anything because they feel “different.” Just suck it up and be a man or a woman. Despite how you feel, you are still a human person. Otherwise, you end up with people trying to one up each other all day like right now.

Sexuality doesn’t define you but, biological sex does. Sexuality is just an emotion which, lucky for us, can be controlled by pure willpower that a person has. We aren’t animals. Smokers don’t have to smoke. People who masturbate can stop. ABC123+ can stop this stupid oppression game. Biological sex is the only thing that you talked about that does make a difference.

It also influences the way women vote and think. When they are married and have children they look to protect their children. Without anything to mother they, look for the anyone who they can mother. The maternal instinct is good when it’s out into the family but, outside it becomes destructive. 

In a time where people are constantly feeling more lonely and sad, friendships and hook ups aren’t cutting it. I’ve seen 20 and 21 year olds waste their life not wanting to settle down. They are more concerned about themselves than anyone else. College is infiltrated with moral individualism.

Nuns and Priest are devoted to Christ. The entire reason why they don’t get married is because, it’s supposed to allow them to be closer to Christ. It’s supposed to be the overcoming of the nature to the spiritual. 

I’ve been going to college for two years now. What I’ve seen is unhappy and depressed people who at least try to act happy. It’s the same sort of story for all of them. Moral Individualism. “Because everyone has a different history and story, I can’t say what they do.”"

But, someone who gets married in their 20s and  has children is turning the motherly instinct on with the first pregnancy. Focusing it onto her children instead of letting the instinct go crazy.

Not to mention men also have a lesser known biological timer. In the 30s men tend to get really selfish and materialistic.

“Completing yourself” doesn’t make any sense from a biological point of view. Humans need other humans to help them, we are social animals. We need interaction.

AskAPriest,ff8u9mx,t3_erzwy2,1579696296.0,"(Not a Priest) I’ll quote the Catechism for this one: 
2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity,141 tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.""142 They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.

2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.

2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.

Homosexuality is not a sin but, homosexual acts are a sin. The Catholic Church calls homosexuals to chastity. As it does for Priest and Singles.

S if you heard that we hate homosexuality, then no. We believe that they are called to chastity."

In a religious sense you only need a Priest (If not available, a lay person can do it), two witness and, yourselves. Legally it’s even simpler. (Plus traditionally the families would host and pay for the wedding, I don’t know if you practice that were you live.)

In general, it’s very simple to get married. Not to mention most colleges have married housing, if necessary.

I think the reason why most people don’t wanna get married or are scared of it is because of the responsibility and the sacrifice of the self, it requires. Maybe that’s why your boyfriend is scared of it.

He doesn’t know if he is capable of holding down a house or is scared of being “held down” by marriage.

In all honesty, every time I’ve seen a couple get married that do have that sacrificial love, it only makes them better people and therefore the society as a whole.

Marriage is the end of a story. But, it’s a beginning of a new story.

Most people think the older you get the better but, it’s the exact opposite. The younger you are the more flexible you are to change. This really helps with marriage. When your 18,19,20 and or, 21 you are still developing as a person. So you grow into the marriage. I’ve seen my friends who were complete mess, become tame thanks to marriage.  Younger marriages also have more children. Because, well your in your prime for children from puberty to 25.

If you wait for marriage I’ve seen people become very selfish. Not in the intentional way but, they become very self centered, men especially, if they don’t have children. They get into things like robots. “You touched my robot!” What I’m trying to say is that they become really picky.

Women. Well... After 30, theirs been hundreds of reports on how women who don’t get married and have children become cat ladies after 30. Mainly due to their biology trying to kick in and raise children. But, because there are no children,  the motherly nature forces it into animals.

Anyways, point is, get married young. Especially if you wanna have children.
