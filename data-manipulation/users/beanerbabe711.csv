drugmemes,ffhl5wu,t1_ff6aa5z,1579940430.0,I know there’s different strains. Are there any kinds that mock a stimulant high or is there some for anxiety too? So new to kratom
drugmemes,ffhl3p6,t1_ff6exdi,1579940343.0,I’m thinking of growing some and taking it via pill form. I have a lot of neck and back pain from a car wreck years ago and would rather take kratom for pain than Tylenol 800mg or Tylenol with codeine
PublicFreakout,ffhkyur,t1_ffhkugl,1579940146.0,No. SHE.
PublicFreakout,ff8e4cr,t3_es2z99,1579674648.0,Why on earth would you go around showing and telling people?? That video legit gave me anxiety. I would not tell a SOUL.
PublicFreakout,ff739t2,t1_ff72v80,1579640253.0,Wow I didn’t know that. I really don’t care what people wear but fur isn’t for me.
drugmemes,ff69mi9,t1_fewngdd,1579622356.0,"I feel like you should get more up votes just because you said “gullet” XD I Always hear older folk use it, “Shut your gullet MARGO, I’ll take out the trash when I want.”"
drugmemes,ff68ny0,t3_erdkjf,1579621736.0,Honestly I got too spoiled smoking the good stuff. But I like mids.
drugmemes,ff68j6v,t1_ff3ye6v,1579621651.0,What is kratom like? Does it get you high?
drugmemes,ff68bhd,t3_erlvtc,1579621508.0,Can kratom get you fucked up? Never tried it. I know there is different kinds and it’s legal here in Texas.. I’m curious but kinda scared lol.
drugmemes,ff6862g,t3_ergolm,1579621408.0,I used to get awful anxiety from smoking bud.. I’ve been smoking for about 5+ years and one day I spark up the usual bowl and a few minutes later I feel far to overwhelmed. I experienced intrusive thoughts and my heart was beating so hard I couldn’t concentrate because I kept hearing it thump over and over again. I tried to do things around the house to get my mind off of it but it didn’t work. That’s when the panic slipped in. I had no idea what a panic attack was at the time. I was confused as to why I was having one.. I had quit for two years because every time I’d smoke it’d happen again. I was pretty down and sad because I couldn’t smoke but luckily things change and I’ve been smoking again with little to no anxiety. I’m so glad because weed helps me with physical pain and mental lol
PublicFreakout,ff67hp8,t1_ff627bk,1579620962.0,"The dreads that form on the back of the neck are so irritating to comb out. It instantly puts me in a bad mood because I’m tender headed Lol. And yeah, she wouldn’t know what her culture was even if it smacked her in the face. If she got in my face like that I would’ve punched her right in the mouth. She got lucky he didn’t deck her. Although I wish he would’ve."
PublicFreakout,ff5h82f,t3_ero03x,1579592747.0,Well deserved beating.
PublicFreakout,ff5h0g6,t1_ff55q1x,1579592476.0,Very true. I’m Hispanic but my hair is super super thick and dense and if I don’t brush it for a day or so it begins to form dreads and it takes about an hour or more to even comb it out. I have to use deep conditioner and saturate it to pick it apart. Sometimes I’ve had to cut them out.
PublicFreakout,ff5gtbf,t3_eroexc,1579592232.0,In my opinion it’s disgusting the way she flaunted around In that fur. We aren’t cavemen anymore. You can wear faux fur. I don’t target people or even protest against people who wear fur but that lady is super annoying
PublicFreakout,ff5gn2x,t3_erq6ws,1579592013.0,Did the blonde hit her first? If not then the other girl should be held accountable. I don’t know the full story though
PublicFreakout,ff5gbfo,t3_erirh1,1579591616.0,Wow. It’s no wonder she doesn’t get “enough” subs. She’s an entitled cunt.
BipolarMemes,ff4k415,t3_erj3em,1579565540.0,Literally I don’t know why I do this but it’s true sometimes
PublicFreakout,ff42yr1,t3_erc5do,1579554406.0,"Fuck a regular street fight, let’s go get our swords."
PublicFreakout,ff40f1n,t3_erfaut,1579552822.0,"This video makes me hate that stupid bitch more than I should.. Like damn, I’d pay good money to see this hoe get dragged by her hair and knocked out"
bipolar,feudm2n,t1_feucct7,1579385568.0,"Yeah. Almost everything is confusing to me. Also white and warm tones calm me down. As much as I love black and gloomy colors, I find staying in a room that’s so dark isn’t good for my mental state. I’d love to have cute lights to hang up. I def know what you mean on the one step forward and a thousand steps back thing.. it can be super frustrating."
bipolar,fepcrm6,t3_eq9s5x,1579317333.0,"Wow, I’m proud of you. I’m about to be 24 and have been confused and struggling with my diagnosis for a while. My room gets absolutely filthy.. I love your room though, looks cozy."
PanicAttack,feo9c7i,t3_eq5fe6,1579296848.0,"Panic attacks are random and are often triggered by stuff you view as odd or random. I once had a panic attack because I was smoking some weed and was listening to a song that reminded me of living in California. For some odd reason I kept thinking and thinking about how MUCH I missed living there.. then BOOM, out of nowhere, I had a panic attack. It didn’t last long but I still found it weird. 
I honestly don’t know what causes your panic attacks, but what causes mine is trauma from years back that randomly pops up, too much sugar or caffeine or smoking too much weed at once."
entertainment,fej7dfi,t3_epbdc5,1579159989.0,She’s a rude coke head who makes a living off of being a mean girl. That’s basically it. Nothing special about this woman at all.
PublicFreakout,fdov728,t3_emhcfa,1578613615.0,This fucking breaks my heart. I wish things were not this way.
SyrupSippers,fdor9o3,t1_fdor79a,1578611114.0,I wouldn’t let it bother you. After all it’s just Reddit.
SyrupSippers,fdoqu1b,t3_emcvva,1578610837.0,But.. why are you so hurt ?
PublicFreakout,fdjmged,t1_fdhhrtx,1578477974.0,You never know with strangers.
PublicFreakout,fdhatr1,t3_ele71p,1578419055.0,Just think if you’re at A party and people are passing around a joint or blunt and you’re drunk and can’t tell then freak out like that
PublicFreakout,f83tpbo,t1_f83pyqz,1574220668.0,The cops didn’t even come. Shows what a joke your opinion is. If you did this to me I’d just brush right past you. If you were to lay your hands on anyone or push them out by blocking the entrance then don’t be surprised when you get decked.
