SmashBrosUltimate,fenubai,t1_fenru17,1579290859.0,"I’ve seen many comments complaining abou it being “just another swordie”. Not even the fact it’s a fe character. Plus it doesn’t matter what series the character comes from. A sword fighter is a sword fighter, whether they’re from fe or not"

Also we get so many poke and fe characters because we don’t get reoccurring characters really so they want the characters to be up to date. Plus we are getting more dlc so I don’t see the problem here"
