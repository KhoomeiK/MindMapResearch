Aphantasia,ffu1t1p,t3_euvz05,1580232656.0," Isaac Asimov had aphantasia.

Here is an interview where he talks about his complete inability to visualize:

Transcript:

>IA: ""I have no talent whatsoever for writing movie scripts.""  
Interviewer:""How can this be.""  
IA: ""Easy. The requirements are different.""  
Interviewer: ""Writing character or...""  
IA: ""Well you have to have a picture in your mind. You can't just tell a story. You have to at all times know what's on the screen.""   
Interviewer: ""Visual medium.""  
IA: ""And it's useless to ask me to do that. I never see anything that I write, I only hear it. Conversations, all that I'm aware of. That's why my books are so ""talky"". One of the reviews of Nemesis says it's talky (oh what do they know) but it's true. It's great talk but he wouldn't know that.""  
Interviewer: ""But what you talk about is visualizable.""  
IA: ""I suppose, but that's purely accidental.""  

In this second one he talks about forgetting what his daughter looked like when she was standing next to him:

Max cost for any medical treatment in Sweden is $119 for healthcare (after that it's free) and $244 for medicin, but the latter gets progressively cheaper the more of it you pay for.
