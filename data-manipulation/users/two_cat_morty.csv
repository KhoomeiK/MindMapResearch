rarepuppers,ff5g1v4,t1_ff5e3c3,1579591287.0,"That is a fair argument and one that I think is very important to consider. I have looked into fostering and adopting and also thought about having my own children. I am not decided yet. I believe it is the exact same argument as with dogs but with much more personal happiness at stake. 

Personally I think asking people to adopt a rescue rather than buying from a breeder is *really* not asking that much. You will be a tiny bit sad for a little while that you didn't get the golden retriever of your dreams, you may even have to go through the process of fostering and returning several dogs before you find the right one. But in the end these are such small sacrifices to make when the alternative is that same dog languishing in the shelter and perhaps being euthanized.

On the other hand, children are a much more important component of our lives, and in general bring us great happiness. Children coming out of foster care are much more likely to have serious behavioral issues, and these are much more likely to dramatically impact your life in a negative way than if you were to end up with a poorly behaved dog. Basically, there is much more at stake in choosing to adopt a child than to adopt a dog. I therefore would never judge someone poorly for choosing to have their own children. It is a hugely unselfish decision to adopt rather than conceive your own, and it is unrealistic to expect everyone to be that unselfish. However, we should still be able to acknowledge that it is a selfish decision we are making. We are denying a foster child, who had no control over their upbringing, the chance for a stable and happy life so that we ourselves can be more assured of our own happiness. If I did choose to have my own kids, I would have to admit I was making the more selfish decision. I would not hate myself for it, but it would be irresponsible to not fully consider the consequences of that decision, and it would be inhuman to not feel at least a little bit sad about that potential foster child I decided not to take in. 

Dogs, though. I have worked with hundreds of rescue dogs at three different shelters in my life. You cannot convince me that a family going home with one of the animals is making any meaningful sacrifice. The great majority of those families and those dogs will be happier because of it."
rarepuppers,ff5exfs,t1_ff5dhtk,1579589938.0,"I did not say that death is the worst scenario, although we should all be able to agree that it is horribly sad. Of the thousands of dogs that are euthanized in shelters  *every day*, how many of them do you think could have had a happy life with a family? Even if you think the proportion is extremely small (and I would disagree), that is still an immense number of dogs who lost out on a chance of life. That is heartbreaking. I don't understand how anyone could not think that is heartbreaking. And you could *do* something about it by adopting. 

If you think their lives are so miserable that their existence is worse than death, you could also *do* something about that by adopting. MOST rescue dogs do not have behavioral issues that cannot be fixed with basic obedience training (which all dog owners should be prepared to do anyway). This is a cop out excuse people love to give and it's just blatantly untrue. I have worked with hundreds of rescues in my life and this is just absolutely not true. And *even if* you were concerned about such issues, nearly every shelter has an friendly foster policy that would allow any potential owner to determine if any potential dog is a good fit. These excuses that are brought up again and again are just so flimsy and easily surmountable if you put any amount of effort into it. I am confused that you believe my empathy to be shallow when you yourself did not convey one bit of sadness at the current plight of these animals. You just list their miserable conditions and conclude we should do nothing for them but instead buy from breeders. Where is the empathy in this? 

You say we should buy through breeders to put puppy mills out of business, but does adopting from a shelter not have the exact same effect? The basics of supply and demand even argue that adopting is better than buying if you are trying to put puppy mills out of business. If you reduce the supply of puppies from breeders by buying them, more people will have to turn to mills to find a dog. The price of puppies will increase as supply falls and demand increases, further incentivizing the creation if mills. If, on the other hand, people turned to adoption en masse, breeders would have a hard time selling all of their puppies, and mills even moreso. The price of puppies would fall. There would be less of a market for puppy mills.

Are you really saying that it's not only okay to buy from breeders, but that it is *better* to do that than adopt? I have never even heard someone make that argument. Only that breeding and shelters are largely equivalent ethically and that it is up to personal preference."

I'm not sure exactly what would work in your situation. Maybe something like, ""why are you telling me that?"" The best replies are ones that turn it around and make them explain their reasoning, because their reasoning is probably dumb. A lot of times when someone tells me to smile, I just say ""Excuse me?"" as if I am really confused by what they just said.

I mean that if you automatically take that option off the table completely, you're putting yourself in an unfair position and the wrong frame of mind right off the bat. Because in saying that you will *never* leave someone, you are saying you are willing to put up with unlimited and undefined abuses for the rest of your life no matter what. That is showing yourself no love and no respect. Self respect is knowing that you would leave someone who did not deserve you, no matter who that person is.

It is important to know what your boundaries are in terms of the amount of hatefulness you are willing to endure and the amount of love you are willing to go without. It is fine to say I would never in a million years expect my partner to cross those boundaries. But you should still be able to state clearly to yourself (and your partner, if necessary) what those boundaries are. If you are saying you will not leave your wife, it should be because she has not yet approached those boundaries. Not just because she is your wife.

But this woman has zero authority or standing in how you parent your child. If you offer her a compromise, it will just show her that you think her opinion is important in matters of parenting (when it isn't)."

Parenting,fcwy77q,t3_ejaveh,1578042720.0,"It is hard enough for this generation to make it on their own as it is. It's unfortunate we don't all have family to lean on like your daughter does, but that's no reason to pull the rug out from under her. There are many cultures (past and present) where cohabitation with the extended family is completely normal. 

You mentioned in another comment that many people glamorize struggling, and I think that's an excellent description. If we can't even extend a helping hand to our own family members, then who are we going to show compassion to at all? Some people experience struggle and in turn want others to experience that same struggle. This thinking is backward and helps no one."

Stop whining just because people are being critical of the US.

vaxxhappened,fctanej,t1_fcsuzry,1577937423.0,"Vaccines cause you to make antibodies that fight off those infections. Why would an infection just ""vibe"" in your body rather than being killed off?
