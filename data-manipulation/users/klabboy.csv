neoliberal,ffalsyj,t3_es8doh,1579738948.0,How’s the impeachment process going? My republican friends think there’s no real evidence. And I haven’t been paying attention
Documentaries,ff8ly2k,t1_ff8lj33,1579685031.0,No of course not. He does sell his stock and also gets other income from various sources. But he also invested heavily in google and other companies in the early 2000’s not to mention he has numerous companies which he likely gets income from - that 81k is just from amazon.
Documentaries,ff8gfc9,t1_ff8g7fk,1579677342.0,Yep. Good work. Thanks. It just bugs me when I see either factually wrong shit or horrible comparisons.
Documentaries,ff8fz6l,t1_ff8cy50,1579676795.0,"No he didn’t. Remember the stock he owns in amazon isn’t actually income. If he sold all of that it would sell at a increasingly lower rate than at the current market value. Since a massive sell order would cause the price of amazon stock to plummet selling his shares would sell to the market at a fraction of the current price. He would need to do that slowly and overtime into the market in order to make anywhere close to that “income” you gave him. 

His income apparently is [81k](https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/work/1410621/jeff-bezos-makes-more-than-his-least-amazon-paid-worker-in-11-5-seconds/amp/) but his stock earnings are different and not actually earnings until he sells.

todayilearned,ff66rct,t1_ff58tmj,1579620474.0,"Price controls often result in either shortages or surpluses. And with property - as in rent control - that’s among the worst price controls out there. 

A much better way to deal with it is through up zoning all existing areas. Creating supply rather than limiting price. As creating supply doesn’t create distortion. With price controls on rent you end up with housing just literally falling apart since the land lords can’t increase the prices to offset the cost of repairing the old buildings. There’s no benefit to repair and replace failing buildings and thus it just won’t be done. Leaving the tenants in those areas to rot in bad conditions. 

Plus there’s some criticism of rent control that it actually benefits the wealthy more because they are able to pay more in rent but will live in rent controlled housing thus actually benefiting far more than the people the policy is actually trying to help - these are often elderly retired folk with savings.

But again decide for yourself and look at the below two links. But I’d consider it a strong possibility that it’s bad policy.

Here’s an article on price controls that touches on more than just housing: https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PriceControls.html

Look at the studies portion... pretty much every study shows these laws increasing rent and reducing housing availability https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_control_in_the_United_States#Studies_on_effects_of_Rent_Control_in_California"
todayilearned,ff64tqh,t1_ff5a9dk,1579619149.0,"Price controls as they are called - with some specific examples of price controls being things like rent control or min wage - always result in either a surplus or a shortage of the good demanded. But often price controls merely cause shortages. Either way, the effect is the same for the group (often) targeted for the policy - a lack of access. 

Price merely reflects supply and demand, they are a secondary feature of the market - not a primary feature. So controlling price is like trying to cosmetically treat a condition. Think if your house is being eaten by termites, and you decide just to paint over the damage. But prices are still very important they reflect the underlying supply and demand of the market. So if prices are rising there’s obviously something fundamentally wrong with it either too few suppliers or an increase in demand quick enough to not be offset by new entrances or some combination of the two. A better idea for policy is to target the underlying issue - often destroying monopoly power in that market or promote competition/improve incentives is a better option than distorting price. 

But feel free to take a look for yourself. Here’s a quick overview of price controls. https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PriceControls.html"
