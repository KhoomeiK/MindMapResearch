Not THAT many problems. The way you chose your words is telling.

I agree with the others here who say you are better without her. 

The fact that she admitted she only uses Sophie is an additional factor for being lucky she cut ties with you. Chose your friends carefully, your ex was not any better than Sophie."

With one of these you have less trouble with grime and only have to use a very small amount of detergent. 
Without this you also don't have to use as mich detergent as recommended. This was the reason my laundry smelled horrible like wet dog for months. Regular cleaning, less detergent, keep the lid open when not in use - you should be fine from now on."

Sorry for the German item although I searched in English. You put these little marbles in the vase, bottle, etc and add water and a little dish soap. Then you swing that thing, swivel them and your bottle should be fine again. The balls are reusable. Hehe. What a word joke.

The point here is I guess that if you don't tip, nobody makes an angry twitter post about it. It's ok if you don't tip in Germany as the hourly wage covers the service. The average wage of German waiters is 8,50 Euros (9,49 USD). In my hometown in lower Bavaria I know it's higher, about 11,50 Euros.
