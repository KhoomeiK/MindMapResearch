Paranormal,fgub1kt,t3_f0egh3,1581116511.0,"These stories always amaze me how they demand you help when they think you work somewhere and you’re only on break or it’s your day off. Most companies have policies where you are not even allowed to assist a customer even if you do work there if you are not on the clock. Even if you were an employee, demanding someone helps you when they aren’t getting paid for it is just entitlement."
MurderedByWords,fguaekk,t1_fgu9u2l,1581116088.0,Well yea I guess that was kind of my point in agreeing lol

funny,fgu8ann,t3_f0flx8,1581114768.0,Omg she reminds me so much of my great aunt that passed away last May it isn’t even funny. I’d say something like “oh shit” and she’d be like “hey! Don’t you fucking swear!” But also anytime I’d refuse money for helping her she’d force it into my pockets and tell me to shut up. Oh man the feels.
MurderedByWords,fgu7jrb,t1_fgsyj1i,1581114447.0,"That’s such a great point. I used to despise Rush Limbaugh, but after hearing a few candid interviews from him and his multiple guest voice appearances on Family Guy he’s pretty much admitted to just being a “shock jock,” proved he can see the other side and be light hearted about it and doesn’t actually agree or believe half of the stuff he says and I have learned to take stuff I hear from him with a grain of salt. It’s all about approval ratings and meandering to a public consensus."

Like Romeo and Juliet laws. Majority of the lower age states the other party has to be within 3 years of 16/17 until they themselves are 18 still. Which is why it’s common for most people here to just say 18 across the country."

ChoosingBeggars,fgna1fv,t1_fgn9asp,1580940546.0,"I never said they were your first comments, but it's reddit. You made a comment people didn't agree with which gave you your first downvotes, but then you continued with insults/snarky comments and as such you went aboard what I like to call the ""Downvote Train."" Happens all the time, say something people don't like and in turn the rest of your comments, related to it or not, are hunted down to give downvotes. It's downvote by association at this point."
ChoosingBeggars,fgn8p19,t1_fgn6ja5,1580939793.0,"Bruh, the downvotes aren’t for disagreeing, they’re for the constant insults you’re replying with calling people “idiots” and “fucking morons” for not seeing it your way."

MurderedByWords,fgmsx6b,t1_fgmq5c4,1580931397.0,"Clinton was never convicted by the senate though, he was acquitted by them and served the rest of his second term. In fact his approval rating went up to its highest numbers during and after the impeachment hearings. Unfortunately that’s how this will go for trump too since the senate is mostly republican and on his side and his cult still worships him.

Edit: Wrong word apparently"
AccidentalRacism,fgcfsmd,t1_fgcd6bh,1580672237.0,"Wrong. “America” isn’t a country. We live in the United States OF America.

cats,fg4wa2d,t1_fg4w14r,1580512513.0,"To clarify in FL where I lived The humane society was funded to pull strays off the street, neuter them, and return them. It was an awesome funding effort to keep stray animals from producing unwanted babies."
cats,fg4w14r,t1_fg4vfpu,1580512353.0,Oh they don’t. I lived in Florida for a few years and was blown away by the concept of a TNR program since the humane society was funded by FL state. We def don’t have anything like that here in my part of NY though.
BoneAppleTea,fg4vm72,t1_fg4v8rn,1580512087.0,You’re right I was basically going off the old stigma of “correlation and causation” and that’s clearly an ignorant stand to take.

Like I said if they are bad sources please let me know so I can be wary of them in the future
BoneAppleTea,fg4td1a,t1_fg4q6yq,1580510672.0,That’s awesome! Good on you.

BoneAppleTea,fg4oqpt,t1_fg4of59,1580507752.0,On studies by the Mayo Clinic and Harvard. Are those not legitimate sources? (I’m not arguing I’m actually concerned that these sources may not be legit.)

assholedesign,fg4nvbn,t1_fg41eqy,1580507215.0,I had to do this with a gym membership. They made it impossible to cancel. No option on the phone or through the payment provider and when I went to the location I had to fill out forms to cancel that they were conveniently out of every time I went there and when the forms were present they needed a manager who was never present (5 attempts). Ended up just changing my expiration date for my card online and telling my bank the charge was unwarranted to get them to stop.
therewasanattempt,fg4n6qm,t3_ewrcyq,1580506794.0,"I dunno this is actually heartbreaking to me. Everyone is making puns and jokes but you can tell by the video before he jumped he made a conscious effort to test the road for speed before he leaped. I get it, animals are food etc etc but by comparison it looks like someone kidnapped trying to flee and it’s sad."
assholedesign,fg4jg01,t3_ewn6qh,1580504501.0,This reminds me of Juicy Juice products. The round containers are sold a bit higher than the square containers but are only 48 ounces and the square ones that are cheaper are 64 ounces but the round ones look bigger because if the shape.
MurderedByWords,fg4i78j,t3_ewsjku,1580503754.0,I know the point of the post is about LGBT and I’m not a religious person but man does this speak volumes about religion. Our old priest at the church my family has always attended passed away about 5 years ago and the new guy that took over always seemed a bit “off” to my family so much so it got brought up every holiday. When the big wave of this molesting across the country broke out he was actually found to be guilty of it himself to the point none of them were surprised. It’s sad how helpless these people feel because they have this position of “power” so they feel ashamed to speak out.

BoneAppleTea,fg4ges2,t1_fg4ehph,1580502877.0,"No one said it did my dood. What it does do however is create resistance to insulin and raises cholesterol. Hence why someone who’s diabetic and has a history of heart attack shouldn’t eat an overt amount, which is what raises my concern for my mother being on said diet. Not once did I attribute my mother’s weight or even mention it, to eating fat, which is what your analogy implies."

BoneAppleTea,fg4c1tc,t1_fg4ahgn,1580500559.0,"Awesome thanks for the info. That explains the no carbs then the slow reintroduction of them, which honestly worked amazing. Funny how just a different terminology skews your view on something. Appreciate the insight."

So by what you said I assume the Atkins diet is basically a keto diet? That’s pretty much what my college friend had me on so I suppose I was technically on it as well lol"
cats,fg46ef4,t1_fg465i8,1580497109.0,"Haha he’s a Manx actually. He’s just very responsive to speech and gestures, plus I coddled him as a kitten so he responds and follows me like a dog. I can literally get him to follow me and jump up on anything (even my shoulders) with just his name and hand gestures."
BoneAppleTea,fg466wp,t1_fg4597p,1580496986.0,"Good on you. That’s awesome. That said I feel like that’s mostly carb restriction that gave you that change, not necessarily the keto diet itself. I went to college with a guy that’s now a personal trainer and he gave me a diet years ago that helped me drop from 215 down to 155, and it was all about not having any carbs and then gradually reintroducing them. I mean heck I think the first 15 I lost were just from not drinking a 2 liter of pop every day. My bigger issue with it though is the higher fat increase from it just seams like it screams heart problems which my mom def didn’t need, but that said different diets work for different people because no one is built the same."
