My mom was there, and kept telling them his heart is the only organ that doesn't have any issues. She had to fight to even get an autopsy, and GUESS WHAT. His heart was perfectly fine. It was the blood clot that traveled from his leg to his lung that killed him. Doctor knew he had DVT but decided it must be the fat guy's heart.

selfimprovement,fdibaam,t1_fcyw2ys,1578439108.0,"I aim to brush/floss at night before bed but I'm bad at it and usually end up brushing/flossing in the morning. I've been getting better at doing it at night, but I still really like getting three thing checked off my list right off the bat each morning, so I kiiiiiiiinnnda cheat. If I brush my teeth at night, I count that for the next morning.

I think I am going to take yours and the other commenter's suggestion of doing it twice. Maybe once in the evening, once after breakfast."
DecidingToBeBetter,fdf8ib7,t3_eiyc7m,1578355771.0,"Budget! I'm so bad with money and I know it but it's so easy to ignore. I've taken my credit cards out of my wallet so I won't even be tempted to use them. I have a little tracking system in my daily planner to use, and I think actually seeing it every day will be helpful.

Quit smoking! I came to the realization that I can make it 3-4 days without a cigarette before I cave. It's the slow season at work right now, so that stress is super low (work is usually what makes me buy a pack). I have plans to see my partner during day 3-4 which I think will be a wonderful distraction to get me over that hump. 

Clean and get organized! I do so much better when I have some kind of routine, some structure. Too much free time leads to me starting shit and not finishing anything, leaving a mess in the wake. Or telling myself I'll do it later (I never do it later....). It's worked in the past and I'm hopeful it will stick around even longer this time. Cleaning, I'm going through my house, room by room, and just tossing anything that I even hesitate about keeping. So much stuff I hold onto ""just in case"" coming up with scenario after scenario about some future-me who needs and/or really wants that particular item.  I'm moving furniture that hasn't been moved since I moved in here, I'm rearranging shit, organizing it. I bought fucking wicker baskets for gods sake. Everything needs to have a proper place, and be placed purposefully. Not just tossed in a pile on the bed."

OP, I grew up with an older sister who made me cry at almost every birthday (mine mostly, but sometimes others') or family gathering. It lasted into adulthood but I started trying to change it about five years ago. She still fucking bothers me and tries to provoke me, but not responding has worked wonders. I just ignore her or walk away or change the subject. I started out with the first two, but as I started to do it more, it started to work sooner and I needed it less and less often,and I became more confident about just starting to talk about something else. 

She is saying anything that she thinks might provoke a reaction from me. She doesn't care *what* she's saying as long as it's at my expense. She'll bring up some embarrassing moment from when I was a kid or something I said that she thought was stupid, and yes, it does still bother me for a moment but, I realize it doesn't matter. Why on earth does me doing something stupid 20 years ago have anything to do with me right now? Or if she's making fun of me for something recent, still, why does it matter? We all do stupid shit, and there are only two people who will remember that stupid shit: you and your bully.

I think I just realized how much of a bully my sister is."

I have a similar issue, and a lot of it stems from not seeing the point. But I made a checklist of little good habits I wanted to or needed to start up again. Brushing, flossing, and making my bed were the top three. I never saw the point of making my bed before because why bother? It's gonna get messed up again that night. But man has it helped. That and brushing/flossing in the morning, and I have three things checked off already. I've also found that by making my bed, it makes me want to tidy up other parts of my room too. It's also great because if I have a bad morning, I can still go back any time that day and make my bed or brush my teeth.

I fucking love checklists. I try to make a list of ten things, half are daily things and half are based on that day. I aim for 8 most days. I feel you on the spiraling stuff. I need some sort of routine to keep it together, and this checklist has really helped me. They're just little things but they add up and it keeps me accountable to some extent.

If it helps, you can get a white board or just a piece of paper taped to the wall, and keep tally marks of how many times you've brushed your teeth that week/month/season"
BDSMcommunity,fcphd61,t1_fcp8mv0,1577864120.0,But the context given by the OP was that they do not want to be called sweetie/dear/whatever. Everyone using those terms are blatantly ignoring OP. Intention doesn't mean shit. You can easily change your language to fit the comfort of those you're responding to.

It was a major point of contention with him and his mom, she wanting him to have a ""normal"" life. I wish she could have accepted him before she passed."
