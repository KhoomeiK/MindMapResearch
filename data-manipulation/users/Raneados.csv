Sideways wisdom tooth isn't that big of a deal.

Even with no insurance in the US it's probably gonna be ~300 bucks, a 30 minute surgery if that, then a few days of being careful with the hole in your gum. You'll change some dressings, have a follow up, and maybe have some painkillers ranging from ibuprofen to vicodin. Or neither. Some people shrug off wisdom tooth surgery really easily.
