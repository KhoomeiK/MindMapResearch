Part of what he said was right. I had this tendency to push people away, especially during moments that I was hurting.

introvert,ffdbb5g,t3_esraar,1579817188.0,"Absolutely yes. I am 29 and I just literally got out of my first ever counseling session in which I cried and was able to talk about some things I’ve been holding onto for years without processing them. Deaths in my family, miscarriage, abusive relationship, intense pressure of my schedule with grad school, moving 5 times in 3 years, family strife, money issues, and just nonstop stress. 

At the end of it, my counselor said to me, “im wondering if you might be an introvert?” 

Blew. My. Mind. 

I’ve been so good with people and my job requires me to be face to face with people and really articulate...I’ve had to develop public speaking skills and been in charge of large volumes of people. I was a drill sergeant in the army for goodness sake.

Unfortunately you’re going to have to deal with more than just blatant sexism and shit talking, but realistically you’re not special. You’re essentially going to be treated as different for your entire career. You’ll be treated as the weakest, hazed, bullied, and will always be on your guard and feel as if every little quiet snigger or comment is about you. The guys that are nice to you and stick up for you are probably just trying to sleep with you and may brag about it and drop you after. Your mental health will be challenged heavily so I hope you’re resilient. 

My advice to you that has worked for me: 
1.	Talk shit back. You’re going to have to get some really thick skin pretty fast. Combat dudes just talk shit to each other nonstop and if you can’t join in without taking it personally, it’ll just prove that women are too sensitive. 
2.	Do NOT sleep with anyone in your unit. Better yet, just only sleep with civilians so you never have to worry about someone saying some shit about you. If a guy lies and said he slept with you, first truthfully deny. Then if he keeps going just talk about how small and awful he was. Shame him. I’m serious, you have to be brutal sometimes. 
3.	Be the toughest, baddest, strongest, fastest version of a human being that you can. But have someone on the outside you can be a woman with. Don’t lose who you are. 
4.	go to therapy once you need it. It’s a strength not a weakness. 
5.	HAVE SOME FUCKING FUN! Once you’re in, you’ll be around some pretty fun people and while there is a lot of bullshit in the army these days, you’ll bond over it. You’re going to be a grunt, and honestly most of the ones I worked with on the trail as a drill sergeant were pretty great. You’ll get to shoot things and ruck around etc. 

I guess that’s it. If you end up hating infantry land you should become a medic! It’s the best job in the army other than a PA! Haha. 

Good luck!"
