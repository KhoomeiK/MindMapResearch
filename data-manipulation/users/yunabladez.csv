Almost all harem anime always ends with the MC choosing the first girl that appears in the anime, even though he meets a bunch of girls he is more compatible with or that threat him with more care. And its usually that retard gorilla girl that hits the guy even when he does nothing wrong.

You likely will need a knife to be able to do the phone in stealth + know where the fuse box is+ fuse + a good repair character. That is quite too many requisites, considering how rare knifes are now and how most people dont play repair characters.

Compare that to boats or cars that are marked in the map so long as you have one + people dropping the parts near if they are bad at repairs. Also, people are more likely to help you fend Jason to repair the vehicles than help you with the phone."

You are joking, right? If you want easy kills you use a high tier killer like Spirit, Freddy, Billy. Doctor only seems ""cheap"" for new players, which would have a hard time with any killer anyway."
deadbydaylight,fffackz,t3_etajib,1579879572.0,"Its stupid BHVR does this and says that the logic behind it is to make it less frustrating for **new survivors** (even though the change benefits ALL survivors), because that is what I love about survival horror games, having an easy time when I am the survivor, never having to improve and a hard time when I am the monster.

I guess anyone playing killer should be automatically great at it right? Who even fucking cares about new killers or the current killer player base anyway? They should be so amazing at the role that they can reach red ranks perkless or not even bother.

The way BHVR does things makes me think they agree the survivor role should be easy because most newbies will select it and the killer role should be  hard and only for people that already experienced a lot of survivor rounds.
