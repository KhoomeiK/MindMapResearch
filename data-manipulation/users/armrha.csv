Like as if the government passed a law randomly ordering a bunch of young men to stick their hands into wood chippers, they actually do it rather than refusing to go along with it like a sane person, then they’re complaining that the country is ‘ungrateful’ for their sacrifice. What is there to be grateful for? It’s just a tragedy."

Should they have gotten a pat on the back just because they went and did violence in another country? If they all unionized and refused orders they could have shut the whole war down, and that would have been laudable, but they went and did it anyway. ‘Ungrateful’, ridiculous."

LateStageCapitalism,fez2ehj,t1_feysvzt,1579453208.0,"Well, vigilantism is wrong, justice must be administered as a society, not individuals. Is this hypothetical guy pro-lynching?

Don’t get me wrong, I love free shit just as much as the next guy but all the whining makes me feel like people don’t appreciate the work that goes in to the game. I don’t want them to make anything free that threatens their ability to keep maintaining the product."
WTF,fets9o5,t1_feqlm7y,1579379433.0,"Nah, not a teenager, but still, losing your job is hardly your 'life being ruined', I mean - you can get a new job, or a new car, over time. You can't get a new eye. It's not like they are stabbing your eye out. That's what I mean by unfair. It's the concept of retributive justice, written about since the 1st century and by Kant and Hegel. If punishments are too weak, people resort to lynchings and other vigilante justice. But if they're too strong, people distrust the government and the justice system in general as an act of brutality - like if they chopped off the hands of a guy who stole a loaf of bread, or executed someone for speeding.

Kant considered punishment important for the concept of justice alone, which must be carried out to maintain order and rule of law, entirely without regard of the criminal or victim. It's neither revenge nor forgiveness, but just the process in which those behaving harmfully against society are controlled.

I don't object to the proper amount of authority being wielded by the appropriate authorities, it's just vigilantism is against the law for a reason and the ethics of redditors is so bizarre, like you find American people posting every day just wishing somebody was robbing their house so they could shoot them - death sentence for a stolen TV, isn't that nuts to you too?"
WTF,fetrg6n,t1_fernabk,1579378911.0,"Guarantee? How can you guarantee that? How can you predict how every last car thief would act? Maybe he'd just graduate to preemptively shooting people because the last time you let somebody get close enough for stabbing you lost an eye. You know the cycle of violence, where people who are victims of violence aren't like 'Well, that's it for me, no more violence.' - they want to get back at the people that hurt them."
WTF,feqj3tx,t1_feqegh2,1579342501.0,"Killing someone for theft seems completely psychotic. Wouldn't it be better that they work to provide restitution for what you lost? Killing them just means you lose out on any potential payback for what they did.

Reddit in general seems to have an obsession with thieves being murdered for their crimes, but it's hard to argue that it's a fair punishment for the crime."
WTF,feqixyj,t1_fepua7v,1579342432.0,"If you believe in human rights, you believe in the idea of a fair trial and fair punishment. Doing something wrong shouldn't be an automatic death sentence.

Just the act of carrier landing, for example, can net you dozens of hours of gameplay practicing different modes. In flight refueling is also many hours of content.
