They didn't see her at all until they passed by the area again, and were shocked to later find her in their photos from earlier in the day. Even pointing her out, it was easy to see how she was missed.

Epilepsy,ffdadap,t3_eswz7v,1579816578.0,"My husband developed a seizure condition a few months ago, and was on Keppra for a period of time. Here are the questions I have some experience in:

*How long did it take to find the right dose that worked for you?* He was on Keppra for about 8 weeks, sometimes with another med, sometimes by itself, pretty much moving one lever or another the whole time. Ultimately finding the right med is a careful balance between controlling seizures and minimizing side effects, and after a few appointments his neuro determined that Keppra wasn't helpful in his case.

*Did you still deal with multiple seizures even after being on the meds for over a month?* Yes, and even now with drugs that are overall ""better,"" we're still seeing regular seizure activity.

*For those this particular medication didn't work for, what was the next one you tried that did work?* I'm a little cautious to answer this, as everyone's seizures are unique and what's perfect for one person may be the worst thing for someone else. Rather than asking your neuro about a specific drug, be open to keep trying new ones until you identify that it's working or not, and if not, go to the next one.

*Did you eat a lot more and tend to get ""wired"" from it?* I don't recall his appetite changing, but he would occasionally appear almost manic, and would suddenly want to clean the whole garage or talk for literally 20 minutes straight. This wasn't all the time, but when it did happen he would exhaust himself with the activity which often led to another seizure.

It sounds like you're already doing this, but keep on communicating anything that's out-of-the-ordinary with the neuro and sharing what is and isn't working. With what you've written here, it sounds like you're still seeing regular seizures AND negative side-effects, which generally will be the neuro's cue to try something else or request further tests. Both seizure control and good quality of life are important - if the seizures stop but the meds otherwise make you a zombie, that's not a very good med. It is possible to gain control of the condition and to live a pretty normal life, but it can take time to find that sweet spot. Either way, best of luck in navigating this new twist in the road."

fasting,ffasz7f,t3_esd7dt,1579743776.0,"I thought the issue wasn't so much that fasting *causes* eating disorders, it's that those with eating disorders have latched on to fasting as a way to hide or normalize their ED because when fasting, not eating is socially acceptable where people (rightfully) worry when your eating habits are different due to an ED.

I'm not an expert by any means but seeing posts asking how long without any food to lose x amount of weight or doing their first ever fast that's like 10 days and they're 2 hours into it and need support is not the approach of someone who is being thoughtful and reasonable in fasting."

So many people would come in and spend hours reading books and magazines, at most paying for a cup of coffee. I worked in the cafe and it was literally always full, almost always with students studying and then just putting the books back (or leaving them for staff to put back).

Around the same time Amazon was starting to be a big player in book sales, and I could often find a book that Borders was selling for $35 for like $10 online; cheaper even than my employee discount gave me. Borders basically became a preview for buying books on Amazon, or a library - neither of which are profitable ways to run a business. It was a fun place to hang out but they hadn't monetized hanging out, and it was clear they weren't going to adapt to the changing book market.

Get one finger up along the side of the cup, as close to the top as you can reach. Gently hook your finger and push down on the cup, making the cup kind of a ""hot dog bun"" around your finger.  Pull down until you get the base of the cup out, and from there you should be able to grab it.

It sounds like this was a ""Jenna problem"" and that she wasn't really keen to listen to you and was more worried about her workload, and doesn't really comprehend *why* people use a service like this. Some stylists *think* they know what you need, and some really get it.

Maybe next time you could give Trunk Club a try? It's the same inventory (and not just what's in stock at that location), and while I've had a couple different stylists, none have ever made me feel bad for my budget or tried to pressure me into something I didn't want.

Logically to me if she's been having her cycle for 20+ years and only now gets seizures, my thoughts go to some other issue. Again, not a doctor.

Has she done any tests like an EEG or MRI? Do her neuros actually ""not try"" to figure out the cause, or they just haven't been successful yet? Epilepsy can take a long time to navigate through -years in some cases, and it's not for lack of trying. It's just that the human brain is incredibly complex and we don't understand a lot of how it works yet, and in the absence of something like a physical injury, it's even harder to figure out. Even with a physical injury, the process is still frustratingly slow sometimes.

Epilepsy,fd416q3,t3_ejwy65,1578163461.0,"Get his doc involved. They see this all the time and can advise.

One of my thoughts is that the medication makes him unwell or uncomfortable, and he's either not verbalizing it or only understands it subconsciously. There have been a couple times my (normally compliant) husband refused to take his medications, because the side effects were so negative and he just couldn't deal. We worked with his doctor and switched some things around to be much better for him.

Second thought is to get a pill organizer and leave it somewhere visible. They're more attractive than the pharmacy packaging and then he can see at a glance that he missed a dose (much harder to ignore). I got one from Amazon that had removable pods in a larger case so you can just take out the pod for that day. Depending on what cocktail he's on it may be overwhelming to see multiple pill bottles out all the time and that's why he wants them out of sight.

Final thought. You can support him, but ultimately he needs to do as much as he's capable of to take care of himself. If he can read time and take his own pills, he needs to do that, and if he doesn't, he instead needs to handle the consequences. You may need to outline that he has a choice between taking the pills on time, or cleaning the bed himself. He is creating more work for you by doing less than the bare minimum to provide his own care, and that's BS and he needs to be called out on it."
