worldbuilding,ff93tn3,t3_esbw0v,1579704173.0,"Problem: the genocide of the laekhiri (the ""magic race"", scholarly in nature, have widely contrasting views about the ""greater good"" and such) is extremely reminiscent of moralistic tropes in fantasy, and real-life genocide has been ripped off so much in fantasy it's almost laughable at this point. The idea of a mad emperor wiping out a race he sees as a threat is very problematic and dull to me - how the hell did he maintain his power in a society which focuses on the education of a leader rather than birthright, as such in my story? how can I not expect my audience to laugh at a very 1-dimensional, stereotypically mad and omnipotent villain within a universe claiming to be allegorically original?
Solution: the emperor isn't a villain at all. He's one of the most popular leaders in recorded history, with almost universal love in the masses. He is remembered for being altruistic yet pragmatic, and all in all, brought a lot of economic + social good to the empire during his reign, while even gaining the respect of conquered lands after granting them autonomy and positions in his counsel. When he decides to order the executions of all known laekhiri almost everyone is on board, after a terrific invasion of the capital claiming thousands of lives and ruining infrastructure beyond repair pretty much caused universal hatred towards them. The moral dilemma is within himself- if he decides to abandon the idea, the masses would hate him and another, much more fatal invasion would be certain, as the invading laekhiri recognise his weakness for mercy. His legacy of prosperity would be forgotten and the city would turn to a massive overgrown catacomb, millions dead, with no possibility of peace for decades. If he goes ahead with it, thousands of innocents including children would be slaughtered.

In the end, he decides to give the order. Even though he forbids killing those not yet learned in magic, and presses for merciful deaths, to his army, fuelled with rage and trauma and vengeance, the words mean nothing. He lives with crippling guilt for the rest of his life over something his court praises him for.

I'm probably gonna use this guy as a POV character before the MCs are introduced - nothing better than tying a reader's moral concsious in knots."

LeftWithoutEdge,fems92q,t1_femj21b,1579268143.0,"Ok, here's an allegory for you. You have 100 people baking bread for you every day for a year. Every day, they bake 5 loaves each, and you take 4 of them to put into storage. Some of them starve because they don't have enough bread to feed themselves or their family.

 A lot of them start to realise that the fact that they're baking 4 extra loaves a day that go towards you means that they're running out of wheat and draining the land, so soon enough they won't be able to bake any bread. One day late in the year, you decide to give 10 of them 1 month of bread made by 1 person between them.  This obviously isn't enough to keep them and many others from starving later on, and you do nothing to cut surplus bread production altogether, but it keeps them happy for a while and stops you from getting into trouble.

I've learnt that there's a good side to being ugly. Friendships and relationships that are based on how a person looks are often shallow and meaningless. People see you by how good a person you are when you're ugly, not how good you look- people like you because you're a sound person, not because you have a nice face you don't have any control over anyway.

I learnt this because, before I started paying attention to how I look, all my friendships were *real*. Our connection and bond was based on something that has meaning, and I was a lot better off for it. But when I did start trying to look good, people would pay attention to my looks, but often I'd find out later that was all they cared about and I was wasting my time with super shallow people who really don't give a shit about you. 

Often, beautiful people don't have to pay attention to their personalities at all, and you might see that as a bad thing for you - but all it means is that, at the end of the day, your 'soul' is a lot more beautiful than theirs, cheesy as it sounds.

Maybe ask r/legaladvice. I don't know.

If you have a bad relationship with your wife, the best thing is to go ahead with the divorce. There's nothing worse (besides abuse) than growing up with parents who hate each other but refuse to split up. It's a hard thing to accept, but things will simmer down eventually - you can find another partner, and other reasons to live - and it's for the best. Life is like an obstacle course, you might get used to jumping hurdles but every now and then something will swing down and hit you in the face for no reason and send you flying. You'll end up on the floor hundreds of meters back wondering ""why the fuck am I even trying?"" but every now and then the path clears and becomes so beautiful you can't help but carry on. Talking to people who know the path can help you find the good bits and help you reach them - talking is soso important - but you still have to acknowledge your inherent value, the sheer beauty of your existence and your daughters existence to be motivated to carry on.  Shitty and mediocre metaphor, I know, but essentially, carrying on is worth it. If not for yourself, then for your daughter.

fantasywriters,fdeo5dv,t3_eksf50,1578343122.0,"My way of doing this was to make the magic reliant on a specific source. In my story, the goddess of nature gave a specific race the ability to manipulate her creations- e.g making trees grow instantly to form walls, healing, reincarnation, etc. etc. so that they could protect her realm when humanity began to take its toll on natural life. However, because she only created SOME things, the magic is limited as such. For example, if a wielder ended up somewhere with zero vegetation, water or life, they would be practically powerless, seeing as the earth itself wasn't created by her. 

The concept of ""you must give to take"" still exists in this world. A wielder draws directly from the power of the centre of the planet, aka the goddess herself, which is a feat which requires centuries of study, practice and commitment (they have lifespans longer by tenfold to account for this). The ""giving"" in this case is the sheer amount of preparation and time it takes to get to that point.

Having a vulnerability to depression through genetics isn't a curse. Neither is a traumatic family life. Sure, they're both things that will almost certainly affect you permanently, as would a broken leg which didn't heal properly, and as with the leg, it might hinder you; but having depression or trauma doesn't mean you're incapable of having a good life. 

The traditional route of therapy and medication doesn't work for a lot of people, and that's ok, if not expected. A pill and an hour of talking a week won't erase years of suffering. Recovery is more than blood, sweat and tears: it's something which has to consume every moment of every day for it to work. There are plenty of people who have done it and fit every definition of a ""happy"" life, while all that trauma is still there. 

If you know you are someone who has had a traumatic life, or is genetically predisposed, and ultimately bound to experience mental illness, there's nothing you can do to change that.

fantasywriters,fcyvf9c,t3_ej5470,1578087930.0,"This is a really good opportunity to stimulate character development and establish conflicts for the character. 
How they deal with interacting with mortals can say a lot about them as a person. Do they completely avoid human interaction, and if so is that because they've been hurt enough already or lack the courage to risk attachment in the first place? Do they hate mortals for being weaker, or envy them for their ability to appreciate life?

If they don't avoid interaction, how and why? This is a more interesting route in my opinion, because the ""bitter shutoff"" is a very familiar and relatable trope in this context. If a character has the qualities to resist apathy once they lose enough to time simply passing, that is something that definitely needs more justifying seeing as most people wouldn't be willing to put themselves through something like that. 

The Doctor, for example, doesnt really like saving the earth. He doesn't like the pain and trauma that comes with it, and there are several points in the series where he is ready to give up. But he constantly returns to earth, because the very thing that gave him the curse of (basically) immortality also made him the only being who can be held responsible for NOT preventing destruction, aka being a time lord. This is obviously just an example, but my point is that this creates a lot of capacity for complexity. The fact that immortality is something a lot of people strive for but is a double-edged sword is something you could definitely tap into and explore."

depression,fcyslxk,t3_ejeyfi,1578086194.0,"What I take ""you're not alone"" to mean is the fact that most people who are depressed hide it. They think theyre too privileged to have a 'right' to complain, or talking is a sign of weakness, or if they do tell someone they won't understand and/or will think you're weird for feeling such a way. It's quite ironic- you might be at a party with 50 depressed people in a room, each one performing the role of someone who is anything other than depressed, precisely because they collectively have no faith in anyone sharing their problems, BECAUSE everyone else with their issues is doing the same thing. 

Something I've really tried to overcome is the idea that no-one can relate to my suffering or what it feels like to be me. Everyone I've ever met has experienced that gnawing, existential pain that comes every day with depression at least at one point in their lives, and a lot of people are fucking terrified of that feeling returning. My damage, in its essence, isn't something alien and incurable- it's human, it's life, it's the bargain of conscious existence. Mental illness and perhaps lesser, more generalised suffering doesn't discriminate, and there are plenty of people you might envy furiously who also feel like their over-suffering is intrinsic to who they are.

Yes, the fact that we are burdened with years of depression while some others never experience it is unfair. Being alone is unfair. But loneliness is often self perpetuating, because you're trying to interact with people you perceive to be somehow  fundamentally better than you, which is ultimately doomed, rather than the confusing dark mess of feelings and experiences that they actually are. 

Tl;Dr : most people who are depressed hide it.  most of the time this comment comes from people who have never experienced genuine trauma or depression. But it's a lot more likely than you think that that person is really trying to say they understand because they've been through it themselves, and realising just how vulnerable everyone else is can, imo, help you find a sense of assurance."

ugly,fcfh08v,t3_eh537w,1577629819.0,"The most important thing to recognise is that we put WAY too much emphasis on how people look in our society, in terms of their value. There are plenty of gorgeous people out there who are mean, lazy and untalented, and there are even more 'ugly' people who have beautiful souls (as cringy as it sounds) and are consistently kind, observant and hard working, and are MUCH more likeable than more attractive people. If you are that kind of person, most people won't even notice whatever physical flaws you have. 

If you think youre doomed because of your looks, you're wrong. You are doomed if you think it's the only trait that is of any value."
