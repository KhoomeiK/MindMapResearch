dogs,ff2i1cr,t1_ff2ejcy,1579507028.0,There’s a video in the Sophia Yin article where he does exactly that. The dog isn’t “submitting” it’s being choked by a slip lead and forcefully held down until it gives up. That’s called [learned helplessness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) and is a pretty shitty way to live.
dogs,ff2ha7h,t1_ff2droa,1579506086.0,"Not really, and that’s where the trouble lies. It looks at first glance to be similar steps, but her steps are much more detailed.

>once the bowl is down, stand close to it as you release her from the stay and she begins eating, at which point you can then move away.

Cesar’s advice of standing over the dog eating it’s food can be interpreted as threatening, especially to a resource guarding dog and will make them uneasy or even downright hostile. If the dog starts resource guarding you can’t walk away according to Cesar, so there’s a good chance a dog could escalate to biting to get the point across. No one wants that. 

>[Cesar says] For every time that you do walk away when the dog is showing food aggression, the dog “wins.”

So buying into this philosophy not to let the dog “win” puts you, the owner in an antagonistic relationship with your dog. It’s very different from the post I linked where you are developing a cooperative relationship with good communication so that your dog feels safe about eating his food and no longer needs to guard it from you. In this case Cesar changed his methods [from what he used to do](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9ihXq_WwiWM) but he’s unfortunately held on to the philosophy of competing for dominance with dogs. I’m not sure how much he’s updated his other training but as long as he holds to dominance theory I don’t think he’s the best or safest trainer to recommend. Which is why I suggested other trainers to follow instead."

dogs,ff056tb,t1_fezla5n,1579465336.0,"You seem to be sending mixed messages here:

>Make her feel she does not have to defend herself.

>the key is to have him take over the care for her. It's gonna be hostile but he'll be okay

Both the dog and the husband seem to be flooded with negative emotions right now. Throwing them both further in the deep end with having him take over all care immediately sounds like a bad idea to me, and is risking more bites, but we can just agree to disagree.

>The biggest steps are to have the husband take over the care as much as possible and be around her often; as well as reversing the way he responds to her

So I agree with working toward this in the future, but it sounds like they have (with the best intentions) been trying to force this fearful dog to accept the husband, and it hasn’t been working and everyone’s frustrated. I think a two week shutdown type treatment with minimal, positive only interactions (for both dog and human) is the best way for everyone to calm down and start to feel at least neutral about each other while waiting until the trainer can come in and help with the specific dynamics in this situation.

>When you ""ignore"" (not respond) to the growling that is saying ""you do not intimidate me, and I am the one in control"".

This can be very dangerous depending on the situation. Do you ignore a dog who growls when you get near their food? Do you ignore a dog who growls when you try to put a harness on? Do you ignore a dog who growls when you try to pet them/pick them up/move them? Ignoring a growl in any of these situations can easily lead to a bite. You certainly don’t want to punish the growl or react badly, you want to calmly stop and/or back off while trying to determine why the dog is growling and how to address it."

It’d be much safer than tying her out especially if your dog already has a habit of getting loose.

The dog has already bit him twice and is still deathly scared of him. I think this is a bad idea and risks even more bites, possibly on the face.

>If she growls at him or displays negative behavior tel him not to get upset (they can sense that very well) and just either ignore or return with love

I’m not sure what you mean by “return with love” but if you mean physical affection it’s a really bad idea, and a good way to get bit. A growl is a warning that shouldn’t be ignored, it should be respected and listened to. You want to figure out why the dog is growling and avoid the trigger with management or deescalate it with training."
dogs,fezdpz9,t3_eqpcly,1579456277.0,"It sounds like your dog and your husband are both a bit overwhelmed with this situation. I think a trainer is a great idea, and as long as they approach it from a management/positive reinforcement approach it should really help.

I can understand your husbands frustration as it’s very demoralizing to have an animal react in fear every time you see them, especially if your dog shows affection to you and not him. Your dog is still very scared of your husband, and some of the interactions may be actually making this worse.

While you’re waiting for the trainer, maybe try having your husband mostly ignore the dog, but have him drop tasty treats whenever he’s near the dog. Don’t have him toss directly or try to hand feed yet. Just toss or drop casually with no other interaction/eye contact so that the dog starts to see him as a non threatening food dispenser. He can also be the one to put the dogs food down, but again, no forced interaction or anything dogs can perceive as a threat (eye contact, looming over, etc).

Try to watch carefully for any signs of fear (head turning, lip licking, paw lifting, freezing, etc) and try to back off whatever’s causing that fear so the dog doesn’t need to escalate to growling or biting. Obviously it was unavoidable to capture him, but the more he has to escalate to be heard, the harder it will be to get him comfortable. I hope the article below will be helpful.

There’s also a wide range of allergic reactions, from mild to severe. I would probably still have a dog if I was only mildly or moderately allergic.

You’re probably already doing a lot of the basics like keeping to a predictable routine of food, potty breaks and letting her get used to you and her new home. Try not to over stimulate or put her into situations where she’s uncomfortable while she’s still learning who you are and whether you can be trusted. Some dogs don’t know how to play or don’t feel comfortable enough to play at first. Any training that builds confidence is a great idea to try once she’s comfortable enough."

Aussies/BCs/Catahoulas are smart dogs and usually need more than exercise to be happy. There’s lots of dog puzzles/enrichment to buy but you can also make homemade puzzles like a box of empty toilet paper rolls and a handful of kibble. A Kong with kibble and smear of peanut butter is also a good one to start. Making her work a food ball to get her daily food out or scattering kibble in a snuffle mat or a piece of shag carpeting, or even grass outside is also calming and rewarding. Hiding kibble around the house or yard and making them search it out is another good way to use the dog’s brain. Start easy (let the dog watch you put it down) and praise when she finds it—just don’t put it anywhere you don’t normally want the dog to go.

* Something else that might help is training an “off” switch if your dog has trouble settling herself. Rewarding the dog anytime she is lying down in a spot you like with treats or jackpot kibble is a good way to start teaching a relaxed settle and http://www.dogsandbabieslearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Relax_on_a_mat.pdf takes it to the next level. Kikopup’s YouTube videos on capturing calm and Karen Overalls relaxation protocol are other options too.

* As far as punishment goes, unless you time it perfectly it can really backfire, especially with “softer” dogs like Aussies/BCs. Research showed that dogs who were disciplined just as or right before they did something bad would learn quicker and retain that lesson longer than dogs who had as little as a 15 second delay in punishment. The dogs who were punished during the bad act showed signs of stress and yet still did the bad act once they realized no one was there to stop them. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/canine-corner/201305/does-punishing-dog-after-transgression-really-work"
