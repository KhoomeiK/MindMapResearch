Periods,fdhmi9y,t1_fdhlx1a,1578425793.0,"Haha don't worry girl me too, up until a year ago I thought of pregnancy as some alien parasitic thing and it freaked me out. I get what you're saying. 

Did your doc explain what he or she even means by a false period? I have literally never heard of that in my life. If they meant implantation bleeding, that would happen before your period was due and would not last longer than like a day I'm pretty sure. It would be spotting.

I really think you're alright and your doc kinda sounds like a jerk from what I can tell. If I were you and felt a week would be too long, I'd just go buy another test at the drug store and take it tomorrow. If you're due for a period and it tests negative, you're in the clear and can relax"
Periods,fdhl282,t3_elg317,1578424915.0,"Okay definitely stop hitting yourself. Sit down close your eyes and take 10 deep breaths. You already know you will be okay even IF you are pregnant. 

I am quite confident it is not unusual to have very irregular periods for a while when you get off birth control. If the pregnancy test was negative, I think you are okay. If you're worried, take another and reduce your chance of having a false negative.

Blood tests are the most accurate for pregnancy, so if you are able to and it would put you at ease, try that. However I think the urine tests are good enough, unless you are not close to your period yet. How late is your period now? If it's been a day or two and you tested negative it's really unlikely that you're pregnant.

The symptoms you described are me every single month when I am close to my period. Try to relax, this is going to be okay. Worrying is not going to change anything other than make you feel worse, and most likely for nothing."

AskWomen,fdeza75,t3_el02kh,1578349787.0,"Just under a year ago I found two lumps in my breast, went to the doctor, got sent in for an ultrasound. At the start, the technician told me not to worry, that everyone always fears the worst, and most of the time it is nothing dangerous at all. What a relief, right? She was so confident and friendly that I felt really hopeful and happy for the first time since finding the lumps.

She started the ultrasound and over the course of the 30 mins I was in there, she got quiet, and her eyes got teary and she left pretty hastily at the end, barely even saying goodbye to me. I was like, well I guess I'm way more fucked than I thought.

The technicians can't give you a diagnosis, only the radiologist can, so I went home and waited for a call from my doctor.

A week passes incredibly painfully, I don't get a call from my doctor. I start feeling better thinking it must've been negative. Two weeks pass. I don't hear anything. My mom suggests I call my doctor just to make sure it was negative.

I finally muster up the courage to call, and incredibly, they tell me that they never even received the results.

Oh my fucking god. The rollercoaster started again. I spent almost every day of those few weeks crying when I woke up, crying several times throughout the day, and crying myself to sleep. I had accepted that I was sick, and was ready for the worst physically, but the thought of my family losing me is what would kill me every time. I was 22 at the time, and I'm the youngest in our family.

A week later, I get a call from my doctor asking me to come in to discuss the results. Turns out I had a bunch of cysts, but all totally benign and nothing to worry about!

I remember thinking before I heard from my doctor that if this turns out to be nothing, I will have nothing else in my life to ever complain about. I had never been so worried and scared in my life and wouldn't wish that upon anyone, though I know there are people who suffer far, far worse, and that breaks my heart.

I have to remember this horrible experience more often so I don't take anything for granted.

-------EDIT:-------

To those of you who had a different result than I did, I sincerely hope your state is manageable, or will become manageable, and that a light will appear at the end of the tunnel. You are a force to be reckoned with just for being on the journey you are on, and I hope what you are going through will be nothing more than a memory for you soon."
Periods,fdecng8,t1_fdec4dt,1578336116.0,"Okay I see, that's so shitty. In that case, totally understandable. If I felt awful all the time or it was affecting my sex life significantly, I would get it removed. So sorry it's bothering you that much OP. :(

You could also look into the Mirena if you are ok with hormones. It is like the Kyleena, but slightly more hormones, and a lot of women just lose their period entirely."
Periods,fdebo1n,t1_fdebdw5,1578335502.0,"I considered it but they are more bearable than the pain of insertion/removal, and I figure that if I take it out I'll probably regret it at some point and then be too scared to get another inserted lol. My insertion was the worst pain I've ever experienced so I'm putting off having the IUD move through my cervix anytime soon."
Periods,fdeb46z,t3_ekxvma,1578335156.0,"I'm exactly the same! I got the kyleena (hormonal), not surgically though. I have the exact same symptoms as you, and have for the last few months. I find that since I got the IUD over a year ago, my periods are a different experience every couple months lol. 
I also went from 4 day periods to 10 day ones, brown spotting is pretty frequent for me too at the start (like for 3 days) of each period. It's pretty annoying and sometimes I'll feel absolutely insane leading up to my period, which was never an issue before.
I will say that my cramps have improved in some ways. But mostly they're just different (sharper, shorter and come much earlier than before). I attribute that to the hormonal aspect of the IUD. I heard the copper ones can increase cramps if I remember correctly so I dont think that's unusual.

I don't think it's anything to be worried about but I'm curious what other people here think too"

UofT,fcth8vq,t1_fcte1ao,1577943209.0,"Before getting famous he opposed bill c16, his reasoning was quite misunderstood by the student body (myself included), student body freaked out, Peterson rose to fame and left. Nothing really happened other than that. I just imagine he is 1) too famous and controversial to come back as a regular prof and 2) much of the student body has been so repulsed by their interpretation of what Peterson said about bill c16 and trans people that they haven't done enough (if any) further research into what he believes in and was trying to say and would likely freak out again if he decided to return.

He is still tenured though so he could return. But honestly I think he has much bigger fish to fry."

Things may get rocky for a bit but they are going to get much much better without that chaos machine in your life.
abusiverelationships,fcnc59z,t3_ei2pcq,1577808510.0,Definitely abusive. He wanted your lives to be completely enmeshed and that is not a healthy dynamic. To me it sounds like he was love bombing you and is doing that to his new gf. I'm sure he did feel bad about how he treated you but that doesn't nullify the horrible ways he treated you. Try not to feel guilty about your new job and friends. A healthy partner would be over the moon happy for you and allow you the space to enjoy that independently.
