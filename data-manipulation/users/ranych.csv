UBreddit,ffvzbu4,t3_evhn2q,1580278107.0,"It should take at least a few hours to update on UBLearns, but it'll more than likely be updated at least 24 hours or 1 day after you swapped classes. If it takes a bit longer than that, you can always try contacting the UBLearns Support Team through the following links:

sleep,ffvnzbm,t1_ffuntd2,1580268631.0,"That's interesting. Do you happen to have a link by any chance that talks about having late night negative/anxious thoughts during sleep?

Sleeping with the lights off usually isn't a problem for me, but I guess I kept it on the past few nights in case I have any of those bad nightmares again. Yeah I can look into that if I must."

nyc,ffsvkb8,t3_ev1fgi,1580194184.0,That’s so awesome! People coming together to lift an SUV so that the pedestrian can be saved. Actually kinda restores some faith in humanity and makes us appreciate our city a bit more.

UBreddit,ffssdpn,t1_ffq8hio,1580190725.0,"UPDATE: The class is up on UBLearns, but no syllabus or any materials have been posted except for classroom recordings and shit. The professor hasn't really made any official announcements except about recitation not being this week. I think you'll probably be just fine going into class tomorrow unless she posts or announces anything right before lecture which she'll likely go over anyway."

nyc,ffshwvv,t3_euubu9,1580182111.0,That looks pretty cool and love the creativity of it as well! There’s a rat (for Year of the Rat) that is holding a pizza slice which definitely adds a NYC twist to this.
UBreddit,ffs8goe,t1_ffs8250,1580175712.0,"Ok I feel pretty relieved that it didn’t go too far. Nonetheless, their behavior was unacceptable and you’re right in that it could have been worse. Really hope that kid who was dared to drink river water for money is not hanging around with a bad group of people or with toxic people though."
