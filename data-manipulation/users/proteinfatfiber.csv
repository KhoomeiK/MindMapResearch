NewParents,ffj475d,t1_ffj0ddq,1579989958.0,We just got that and are SUPER impressed with the video quality. There is a little green light on the camera but looks like it could easily be covered with tape. It doesn't blink as far as I can tell.
HomeImprovement,ffi5xba,t1_ffhwxfe,1579965944.0,I would NEVER buy a house with a barn door on a bathroom. Good lord.
workingmoms,ffi4zq2,t3_etqvzh,1579965232.0,"My job is 30% travel (though I think that's going down a bit after the summer). I'm due with our first in June so we haven't gone through it yet, but the plan is just for my husband to take on full parent everything while I'm gone (usually two nights at a time, every 2-3 weeks). We're lucky that a) I schedule my own travel and can work around big life things, b) we work the same hours on the same campus so he can do daycare, and c) my mom is only 90 minutes away and would love to stay anytime he needs extra support. 

I already feel like a bad mom for needing to be gone so much but my job pays the bills, so this is our life until I can find something that pays the same."
dogs,ffguq0j,t3_etcbx5,1579915549.0,"I know this is an unpopular opinion but I'd rather put my $75/month into a savings account for vet care. I ran the numbers after one of my dogs broke her toe (~$2000), and I would barely have saved any money once I factored in the deductible, out of pocket, and monthly premiums. The available coverage in my state and price range would still leave me on the hook for a huge amount of money in the case of a catastrophic event, so I'd rather save that money up front instead of flush it down the drain every month for years."
puppy101,ffgf6pz,t1_ffg6wi7,1579904873.0,"Oh god you're so right. Having a puppy is maybe 20% Kodak moments, 80% wondering what's wrong with them why won't they stop barking /biting you /peeing in the house"
pregnant,ffgb5he,t3_etbnx4,1579902371.0,"I'm 21 weeks and we've been working on the nursery for a few weeks now! My husband is painting dinosaur murals all over, and we've already ordered the crib and some other big things. No one in our family is in a position to buy the big ticket items from our registry so we've started getting those, leaving all the $20-100ish stuff until after the shower in case they're gifted to us."
BackYardChickens,fffmf6m,t1_ffflonu,1579887101.0,"Great to hear, thanks!"
BackYardChickens,fffme90,t1_ffflzrz,1579887085.0,"Awesome, thanks! I was definitely leaning toward starting with adults and you just sealed it for me."
pregnant,ffa656u,t3_eshibl,1579728633.0,"That definitely sounds super annoying! On the other hand, I think I'm guilty of this too - I don't have or know any kids except my niece, so when I'm around other babies /toddlers she is literally the only point of comparison I have. I still want to make conversation, so what do I do? Keep bringing up my niece. I know it's annoying, I know the other mom doesn't care, and it still comes out of my mouth.

I'm due in June so it'll go away for me, and hopefully your friend tones it down as she gets to know and gets more comfortable around your baby."
AskReddit,ffa4tli,t1_ff9chzg,1579727898.0,"Same, it's one of the very few movies I turned off halfway through. I normally love slow movies but I was just so bored."
AskReddit,ffa4m9y,t1_ff9j2qp,1579727784.0,I've seen it 3 times and I literally couldn't tell you a single plot point.
pregnant,ff3ztmx,t1_ff1q5y0,1579552454.0,"Mine too! He is obsessed with finishing the murals he's painting in the nursery. I don't see him at all on the weekends except when he drags me in there to give an opinion on the right color or line weight, lol"
pregnant,ff3lq39,t3_ere984,1579543730.0,"I'm in the US. I called as soon as I got my bfp and was told they don't see patients until 8 weeks. We had an ultrasound at our 8 week appt and the midwife explained we'll see her monthly through the 2nd tri, then biweekly through week 36, then weekly.

So I got an us and exam at 8 weeks, an exam and doppler at 12 and 16 weeks, and our anatomy scan at 20 weeks. It's so stressful waiting between appts!!"
