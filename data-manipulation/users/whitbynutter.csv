My father in law was a Chief Petty Officer in the Polish Navy, he was captured, starved and left for dead in a concentration camp in Belgium, fortunately the camp Dr., a Belgian, saw him on a pile of bodies and realised he was still barely alive, the Dr. picked him up nursed him back to health and helped him escape to London, he then immigrated to Canada.
My late father in law had a brother who did not enlist and chose to stay and protect the family.
My father in law told me that the Germans took him out into the woods and be-headed him.....much like those in this picture."
