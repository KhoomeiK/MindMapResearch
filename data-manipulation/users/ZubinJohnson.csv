LitterRobot is the best option, especially for multi-cat homes. It really works and also reduced litter tracking around the house, but it is going to cost over 400 bucks, though you do not need a special type of litter for it.

The other successful option is the [PetSafe Scoopfree](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100l4nWU/destination:https://www.chewy.com/dp/55640). It is cheaper, not as smart at the LitterRobot, and is available with or without the hood. It is reasonably successful and effective. But it relies on its own pebble/crystal litter in liner trays (for ease of use), though you may also improvise and use a different type of litter if you want.

Then there is the Cat Genie, which works on a different principle. It uses washable granules and needs a water connection/plumbing. And it needs special type of litter. PetSafe also has an option like Cat Genie, but washable granules are something that only work best if you have a spare bathroom that you can leave open for the kitty.

Tray-type feeders like Catmate C500 are the best if you are looking for feeders to be used for a portion wet food. (C500 even has a small ice pack that keeps the wet food fresh for at least 2-3 hours). And it costs less than 50 bucks and you can therefore get two."

cats,fctawb2,t3_eiobsb,1577937624.0,"Adding a little bit of catnip to the regular scratch post or the carboard scratcher can keep the kitty off the furniture.

Another thing worth checking out is a carboard-type scratcher or sisal mat, instead of a scratching post. Some cats love scratching on such a surface. It may create some mess to clean, but it is often not a big hassle.

Nail caps like the Soft Claws (more options [here](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100l4nWU/destination:https://www.chewy.com/s?query=Nail+Caps)) are reasonably effective. 

The major challenge is to glue them carefully to ensure there is no discomfort. Also you would need to replace them about every 4 weeks after checking for damage (in most cases they fall off automatically). Finally, you would have to guard against accidental ingestion. Otherwise they are pretty convenient and effective.

Finally, if nothing else works you can also look at a [cat deterrent spray](https://petgearguide.com/best-cat-deterrent-spray/) like Sentry Stop That! and Claw Withdraw to discourage the behavior. You can also look at Scram Mats and furniture protectors if you do not mind the decor changing a bit. There are some transparent ones that are virtually undetectable."

A mix of dry and wet food (wet food in the night and dry in the morning or something like this) would be a more healthy option. You could even look at feeding senior cat food which is low on calories, but a vet is probably the best person to guide on this. Increasing the water intake by getting a fountain would also help.

In addition to adjusting the diet, the kitty needs a solid workout.

You can consider getting a cat tree and some interactive cat toys to provide some interactive fun your kitty might like. Look at SmartyKat toys - they do not require a lot of supervision and their electronic toys are not very costly. Cat springs are also a cheap toy option.

Finally, you can check out a [cat slow feeder](https://petgearguide.com/best-cat-slow-feeders) for the chunky kitty to increase the feeding time and make it work for its food. Most feeders work with dry kibble only, but some do allow adding the wet food along the rims."

CatTraining,fcp9tij,t3_ei74qo,1577855472.0,"Toilet Training the kitty is not always the best or easiest solution. (Copy pasting the major factors from the article [here](https://petgearguide.com/best-cat-toilet-training-kits/)).

Major Limitations

The cats have a natural instinct to dig, eliminate and cover their excretions, so toilet training means that they would not be able to go through this process. This may sometimes lead to a few behavioral issues.

Using a litter box allows you to inspect the excretion, detect any change in volume and habits and diagnose any potential medical ailments. You cannot accurately do this evaluation if your cat does its business in a toilet.

If you toilet train your kitty, you would have to ensure that at least one toilet is always accessible to it, the toilet seat is kept down and the lid open.

If you have multiple cats and you want to toilet train more than one, you will have to get a multi-cat training system or arrangements for an accessible toilet for at least two at one time. It is quite possible that your cat may not like sharing the same toilet with another feline.

Cats do not have opposable thumbs, so they cannot flush the toilet. You would have to do the honors yourself or get a reliable auto-flush system (like Techo or Kohler)

Slippery toilet seats can sometimes lead to the kitty falling into the toilet and getting stressed about future use. YouTube is filled with videos of cats falling into the toilet when trying to relieve themselves. If your cat is going to share the toilet with humans, you would have to ensure that the seat remains clean and dry and there are no urine droplets around the rim to avoid transmission of any diseases from humans to pets and vice versa. You may also consider using the Poo-Pourri Toilet Spray to keep the toilet seat disinfected.

Major benefits

You save considerably on the cat litter and litter box accessories. If you use the traditional litter box, you need to change the cat litter frequently. Similarly, you would need to invest in litter liners, litter mats, scoops and what not. Investing in cat litter and litter box accessories is a recurring cost and you can save hundreds of dollars per year, even if you still have to keep a cat litter box as a backup.

If your cat is toilet trained, you do not need to worry about sifting and scooping your litter daily. This is especially useful if you have litter dust allergies or simply hate the activity. (An alternative is to look at getting a self-cleaning cat litter box). This is also useful during vacations.

Toilet training your cat minimizes the issues with litter tracking and litter odor around the house. While most litter and things like litter liners, disposable litter boxes etc. are biodegradable and eco-friendly, not having to deal with disposing-off such items is just more environment-friendly."

LitterRobot is the best option, especially for multi-cat homes. It really works and also reduced litter tracking around the house, but it is going to cost over 400 bucks, though you do not need a special type of litter for it.

The other successful option is the [PetSafe Scoopfree](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100l4nWU/destination:https://www.chewy.com/dp/55640). It is cheaper, not as smart at the LitterRobot, and is available with or without the hood. It is reasonably successful and effective. But it relies on its own pebble/crystal litter in liner trays (for ease of use), though you may also improvise and use a different type of litter if you want.

Then there is the Cat Genie, which works on a different principle. It uses washable granules and needs a water connection/plumbing. And it needs special type of litter. PetSafe also has an option like Cat Genie, but washable granules are something that only work best if you have a spare bathroom that you can leave open for the kitty.
