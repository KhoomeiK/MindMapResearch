Because of the wavelength characteristics of red light it scatters less. Meaning it travels farther...from which one might reasonably conclude means that red light is less desirable for those seeking to conceal their position. I cited a cool book that explains this phenomena that I thought folks might like to read. But it's also a well-known bit of 'science'...so when he smugly preens that he 'hasn't seen any science to support my wisdom' he's being a smarmy prick. It's literally science...easily confirmed and infinitely researchable.

http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/spring08/atmo336s1/courses/fall13/atmo170a1s3/1S1P_stuff/scattering_of_light/scattering_of_light.html

But I guess ""my science"" here seems suspect. That's what a prick writes.  It's not fun, but I played along.
But he keeps going. So let's examine what he posits. 
""The most visible color in terms of our sensitivity to the energy is actually a bright yellow-green (optic yellow) during the day and something more like teal at night.""

Awesome..we were having a discussion that was clearly focused on lighting at night so its completely irrelevant that optic yellow is the most energy sensitive during the day...this is peak aKsHuAlLy. It means nothing and contributes zero to our discussion.  But maybe his revelation that teal at night is critical. Have you ever seen a teal light? Have you ever, in all of your years seen, heard of, used, or otherwise coveted a teal flashlight? Do they even exist? Again, this is more aKsHuAlLy, presented not for us to learn, but to somehow signal intellect. It's useless. The opposite of wisdom.

He goes on to cite me: ""Unless we were doing a map check we stuck with blue, under cover whenever possible."" And he replies: ""Probably because blue light is generally more useful.""  Thanks...but, I know why I used it. It's smug and condescending to tell me. This might be worse than the aKsHuAlLy stuff.

But let's continue.  I said ""Red light just catches your eye. Knowledge vs wisdom."" And he replied: ""Maybe. Or Knowledge vs lore, with lore understood to mean received wisdom with no real basis in reality but well-subscribed nonetheless. It wouldn't be the first time the military did something that wasn't as evidence-based as they thought it was.""

Not maybe...definitely.  Red light catches your eye. It's cultural. Red means stop, alert, or danger. We use it traffic signals. We use it on brake lights. We use it as a warning. We are trained to see it and alert. It's not MaYbE, its definitely.  It's something that is discussed at length in the book I recommended. The rest of his diatribe is equally worthless. 

It's not life or death info. It's mildly interesting. Trying to take me to task with useless aKsHuAlLy BS is annoying...as in it's not fun. 

Are you satisfied or would you like to talk more about teal flashlights?

bugout,ffgp0vz,t3_ethger,1579911434.0,"There's an interesting story behind red lens filters for military use.  I recommend an excellent book called Jungle SNAFUs and Remedies,  by Kearny, that goes to exhaustive lengths describing the selection process. It's also a good read about other iconic gear selection decisions.  

Tactically, red lens only preserves night vision, but is the most visible along the Roy G Biv spectrum (rememberyour middle school science?).  That's why it's used for warning lights, brake lights, etc.

The best for staying low vis is actually blue (violet actually,  but good luck finding a violet filter). The problem with blue is that it renders water features invisible on most maps. 

Plus, blue is the natural luminescence given off by jungle rot so its easier to obscure.

At any rate, you should use a filtered light, stationary,  and under cover when possible.  The color is far less important than the movement and the modality."

I never said Delta isn't elite, that's obvious.  The OP posted ""Yes but delta force and st6 have a rigorous selection process within an already elite group. Which is why it's on a higher lvl."" The key phrase here is 'within an already elite group'.  I simply highlighted that you can assess into Delta from outside SOF... perhaps the band and chorus weren't particularly elite.   This is bashing the band and the chorus, not denouncing Delta.  Its been a while since I saw the data, but I think historically selection attracts about 40% Ranger Regiment,  40% SF and 20% other...of which soft skills make up a tiny chunk,  like maybe 5%. 

You're right, there is some wisdom in attracting all kinds. But the reality is that soft skill guys don't do well. The band guy was a great dude, super nice, perfectly pleasant.  But his ruck issue at selection was the second time he'd ever been issued a ruck. I helped him set up his gear and he told me so. He had purchased his own ruck for train up and it was already set up. He was virtually clueless. He was in great shape. Maxed the PT test and finished first, by a good margin, on the first roadmarch. When we started doing land nav he was useless. Great attitude, but no skills. He routinely lost his map. He never finished an event within the time allotted.
 He had to activate his emergency lost student procedures multiple times.  Similar story with the chorus guy. Both lasted about a week.

I've never heard of them not taking anyone without combat experience.   I'm certain that's not a rule. What is likely though is that the guys with combat experience do better at selection. Causation vs correlation. 

 My comment wasn't a referendum on Delta or selection or any of that.  I have immense respect, reverence even, for both. One of the best experiences of my life. My comment was to highlight that the OP was incorrect in saying 'within an already elite group'.
