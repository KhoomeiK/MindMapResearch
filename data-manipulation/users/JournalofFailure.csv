UnresolvedMysteries,ffd3ee6,t1_ffd00nq,1579812638.0,"I knew he was a gifted comic actor, but *Ozark* was the first time I'd seen him in a dramatic role.  He is brilliant on that show - easily holds his own with Oscar nominee Laura Linney.

Then again, I've always thought comic acting was much harder than drama.  As PJ O'Rourke put it, ""anyone can get on stage, say 'I have cancer' and get applause.  But how many of us can get up there and do five minutes of stand-up comedy?"""

UnresolvedMysteries,ffd2m4f,t1_ffcq4ge,1579812191.0,"Most of the Wonder Years kids came out pretty well.  Danica MacKellar got a degree in mathematics and Josh Saviano ~~had a successful but controversial music career under the stage name ""Marilyn Manson""~~  became a lawyer."

cars,ff6qhin,t1_ff6n3v6,1579632757.0,"I think Mexico is the only country where Nissan is the number one car brand.  The Tsuru (1991-vintage Sentra) was Mexico's VW Beetle.

cars,ff6q6y4,t1_ff6pdc6,1579632582.0,"When they first came to North America, Toyota and Datsun were neck and neck.  Toyota pulled away in the early seventies and never looked back.

Nissan really fell behind in the eighties when they changed their name and rolled out a series of boxy, uninspired models.  Honda overtook them and they've been the third-place Japanese brand ever since.   These days they don't even have strong reliability to fall back on."
