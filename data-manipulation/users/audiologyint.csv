You probably want to start with a normal toothbrush and have them touch and smell it. Treat them when they are comfortable with the toothbrush. Then get closer and closer to their mouth with the brush continuing to treat until you can touch their teeth over the course of days or weeks.

Make sure you have a good tasting toothpaste. Nova gets poultry flavored toothpaste from Virbac. That makes him like it more because he enjoys the flavor. Over time he will get used to it. Now whenever he sees the toothbrush he comes running over. Eventually I was able to get him to use the electric toothbrush but that took a while."

relationship_advice,fcmv8el,t3_ei1wim,1577793856.0,"Relationships are WORK but they should not be excessively difficult or painful. They will require you to adjust and compromise a lot. But you will find someone with whom you want to put in the work. To be honest, it's probably a bit difficult for you to understand this because you haven't dated very much. You will change a lot in the next 10 years so much you will be unrecognizable. She will too. You can either grow together and stay together or fall apart. That's usually how relationships go."
relationship_advice,fcmun20,t1_fclzcyb,1577793074.0,"I was with my dude for 5 years before I even had the courage to break up with him. Then I found myself wanting to get back with him because I thought he would change and I still loved him a lot, nothing did. Broke up with him again 2 years later, when I was really sick of it and fell out of love, and have never been happier. I actually regret not doing it sooner and cleaner because I hurt him a lot more than I should've."
relationship_advice,fcly3q2,t3_ehwbsb,1577759304.0,"I had the same exact experience. 7 years wasted on a man who just couldn't let it go. He isn't going to change unless he wants to and that is really unlikely to be honest with you. Find someone who you don't have to beg for time.

Honestly take a hard look at your relationship. Do you want to have kids with this guy? Can you imagine what your life would look like if you have kids and he's still playing as much as he does? 

You won't have a partner, you'll have another kid to take care of."
