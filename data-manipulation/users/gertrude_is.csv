relationship_advice,ffcrj6g,t1_ffcqllv,1579805777.0,"Yeah.  This is the teeniest detail and like you, I'm not knocking her as I'm sure this is not easy, but...in her post she mentioned his lack of career affecting her social life (or something to that effect).  Again, no offense intended but it seems like she's grabbing at every excuse to justify her decision that she's already made.  No offense OP!  It's just easier for objective eyes to see it."
eyeblech,ffcp6di,t1_ffcmt6x,1579804243.0,Haha right.  Or squish it.

Sounds to me like he's had this expectation (from himself and others, forEVER) about becoming a doctor and he probably realizes it but just can't move forward.  

I'm sure he loves and trusts his GF and doesn't want to let her down.  So why not."

I like this. It reminds me of how some people need permission to die (as in, at the end of life).  Sometimes a person just needs that."
AmItheAsshole,ffcdc1j,t1_ffc67oi,1579797005.0,"I don't necessarily think this is the case. We heard the ending but not the beginning and middle. OP didn't provide us with that info, but then again, he wasn't asking us to judge that. He only asked us to judge the events of today, you know?"

AmItheAsshole,ffbflor,t1_ffa207f,1579763144.0,Yeah. She's gonna be the crazy scrooge who hoarded her money and when she dies she'll leave her secret multi million dollar inheritance to her pet goat instead of loved ones or good causes.   Maybe she'll write OP into her will for the nickel (except probably not).

Yep. Even if he stayed, he'd always doubt and question if she's lying. She took his trust for granted. Damage done."
AmItheAsshole,ffbe5sn,t3_esizgo,1579761459.0,"I know you were trying to be helpful but think about it: *the fact that you had to watch tutorials in the first place* shows your inexperience and ignorance about the procedure.

I need surgery. Do I want my doctor to watch a tutorial about it a day before or do I want someone who actually knows what they're doing because they are licensed to practice said procedure?

Sorry, YTA"

UnsentLetters,ff5sliq,t1_ff5rcjd,1579608668.0,"So relatable! It's the hardest thing.  By nature I want to help but guess what else I learned? My help might not always be welcome or even needed, even though it was well intended.  And that's not even to suggest he is 'broken' - just that he needs to do what he needs to do for himself.

I always want that crystal ball to see into the future but on the other hand, there's also an inner peace feeling that no matter what, it's ok.  

I hope you're ok?"
UnsentLetters,ff5m1k1,t1_ff5asrb,1579599557.0,"I think you still need to step back and let them be, even for a little while. I've come to realize that trying to control a situation can come across as trying to control them, and that only pushes them away. I've also come to realize that letting go of that control doesn't have to mean you're losing them. If anything, you're 'keeping' them because you're not holding on as tightly. One last thing (since I'm being so sage lol): I've also learned to let go of what I think things should look like, in lieu of just being and letting things happen naturally.

I don't know if this is anything you can use, but this comes from about two years of introspection and chasing a person I love that I also know truly cares about me (possibly even loves) but who just can't right now."

Isn't being with someone supposed to be reciprocal?  Mutually satisfying? 

I feel like you're losing out on your desire to give everything you want to someone you love as much as they love you (if that makes sense. I'm not sure I articulated it well, although it sounds perfect in my head :) )."

This reminds me of a dream I had when I was little.  It haunted me back then but didn't give it another thought until I was in college years later.

A man in a black suit and a woman in a green dress are dancing around in circles.  Ballroom dancing, although I can't name the dance.  Round and round they dance. Eventually the scene closes in on their faces and I see the woman is actually dead. The man either doesn't care or doesn't notice. That's all I remember, although the dream is still as clear as if it happened yesterday.

I'm flipping through our giant art history textbook freshman year of college and my mouth drops open as my sight lands on this image:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnolfini_Portrait

I would swear Arnolifi and his wife were the people in my dream.  It was just one of those overwhelming feelings.

For awhile I tried to research Arnolfini's story; I figured maybe I could find some information on how his wife died.  Most of what I found was general info or just about him.  There was a book about them that I found but it was out of print.  Every once in a while I will Google them to see if anything pops up.

Who knows.  The couple in the dream could have been characters from a TV show I watched back then but the feeling I had when I saw the photo was almost breathtaking.  It just makes you wonder."
