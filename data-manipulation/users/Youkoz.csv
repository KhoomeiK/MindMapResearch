So I just need to find fabric/ribbons in a similar blue and fun fact, the method I'm using for the brooch is really cool. It'll look beautiful and special, but if you look really really close you'll see that it has a snake skin pattern. I learned how to make beautiful looking things from snake discovery (btw it's shed skin! No snakes are harmed!) You'd think it wouldn't be as pretty as it is, but it's amazingly simple and elegant."

Lolita,ff1vv93,t1_ff1gxip,1579487347.0,"Yo. Are we the same person or what? o . o  I am 24, plus size, and never worn lolita yet either. It's really hard as this kind of person to kinda..... tell people that you need something different sometimes? Like shoes. Sometimes it's not just about the size of the shoes.... it's whether they're wide or not. If you have bad arches. If you have just really painfully sensitive feet...... and then it comes to tights too. Tights can fit you and still be extremely uncomfortable. Just because it SAYS it comes in your size doesn't mean it actually fits you well. I personally can't wear anything labeled control top, because of a stomach condition.

Ghost of Thornton hall was.... interesting. To say the least. The end was rather dark.

Also Curse of Blackmoor manor is my favorite. It scared the crap out of me too.... still kinda does. The secret passageways are reeeeaaaally unsettling. \*shivers\* they scared my friend when we played together as well."
ndgames,feypeww,t3_eqwvjt,1579448674.0,"I did this with my friend Gillian! We started with Blackmoor Manor just cuz its my absolute favorite, but it turned out to be a little bit frustrating. Second we played Shadow Ranch and I feel like it went much muuuuuch better. Something good to keep in mind is that even if you know the game like the back of your hand you should have them play on Junior so that they have a checklist. The checklist helps you both from getting super confused because like you might expect a cut-scene to be triggered.... yet nothing is happening. And you're like whaaaat is going wrong here? and you just get so confused.... Checklists are so good. We did Last Train to Bluemoon Canyon next and now we just started The Haunting of Castle Malloy.

&#x200B;

My first and foremost recommendation is that you play a game that you already know yourself. If you yourself have played it before it'll be easier to help when someone gets stuck, and it'll make the experience more enjoyable for them. 

Second of all: The Secret of Shadow Ranch. Why? Because I felt like it was more linear because it was separated into a three day time span, rather than just free range activity. Plus, if you know literally anything about Arizona or the desert at all, it's not hard to keep from accidental death lol. Like obviously don't touch the hissing rock. Don't touch the scorpion. Don't touch the twitchy chicken. And try not to be incompetent when doing chores! Second chance is nice, but having to use it can be frustrating."

* Gin standing in the door way staring at her brother doing something in his room, giving him the ""I made food come and eat right now I literally don't care what you're doing get your ass up and eat"" look, without saying anything.

I feel like I don't fully know them (we only see them together on screen for like a fucking minute) but I feel like trying to piece together what their relationship is like when it's just them is really fun.

How Ryuu protected her in childhood, but when they joined the mafia Gin was able to take care of herself all the more and become a deadly assassin.

I don't know how to say it other than that. That I would feel. Fancy. Feminine, fancy, dignified, and I feel like the feeling is pleasantly warm. And this, despite the fact that the dress was a shade of green that made you almost walk into a wall it was so blinding. But it was lacy, and it had a bell skirt, and an adorable bow in the font.

Sometimes it's not just about the size of the shoes.... it's whether they're wide or not. If you have bad arches. If you have just really painfully sensitive feet...... and then it comes to tights too. Tights can fit you and still be extremely uncomfortable. Just because it SAYS it comes in your size doesn't mean it actually fits you well. I personally can't wear anything labeled control top, because of a stomach condition.

Ghost of Thornton hall was.... interesting. To say the least. The end was rather dark.

Also Curse of Blackmoor manor is my favorite. It scared the crap out of me too.... still kinda does. The secret passageways are reeeeaaaally unsettling. \*shivers\* they scared my friend when we played together as well."
ndgames,feypeww,t3_eqwvjt,1579448674.0,"I did this with my friend Gillian! We started with Blackmoor Manor just cuz its my absolute favorite, but it turned out to be a little bit frustrating. Second we played Shadow Ranch and I feel like it went much muuuuuch better. Something good to keep in mind is that even if you know the game like the back of your hand you should have them play on Junior so that they have a checklist. The checklist helps you both from getting super confused because like you might expect a cut-scene to be triggered.... yet nothing is happening. And you're like whaaaat is going wrong here? and you just get so confused.... Checklists are so good. We did Last Train to Bluemoon Canyon next and now we just started The Haunting of Castle Malloy.

&#x200B;

My first and foremost recommendation is that you play a game that you already know yourself. If you yourself have played it before it'll be easier to help when someone gets stuck, and it'll make the experience more enjoyable for them. 

Second of all: The Secret of Shadow Ranch. Why? Because I felt like it was more linear because it was separated into a three day time span, rather than just free range activity. Plus, if you know literally anything about Arizona or the desert at all, it's not hard to keep from accidental death lol. Like obviously don't touch the hissing rock. Don't touch the scorpion. Don't touch the twitchy chicken. And try not to be incompetent when doing chores! Second chance is nice, but having to use it can be frustrating."

* Gin standing in the door way staring at her brother doing something in his room, giving him the ""I made food come and eat right now I literally don't care what you're doing get your ass up and eat"" look, without saying anything.

How Ryuu protected her in childhood, but when they joined the mafia Gin was able to take care of herself all the more and become a deadly assassin. How having a girlish face and voice, and being easily embarrassed when people tell her she's cute, doesn't mean she's any less incredibly deadly and cutthroat.

BungouStrayDogs,fd4lyvj,t1_fd37zky,1578168804.0,"Legit though, I'm assuming that despite the fact that they look like they get totally ripped, when he goes FULL tiger, not the humanoid version, like full ass tiger his clothing gets like, sucked into his ability (ability space??) and then just comes back when he's not full tiger anymore. Which would actually explain (sorta) why when he's only doing half that they just rip. Like Akutagawa cuts the tiger in half, and even though it was an illusion, I'm assuming it was probably mostly accurate until it faded away, there was no blood there. So I wonder what the actual full tiger feels like. Does it actually feel like a tiger? or is it made of like pure energy or some shit?"
BungouStrayDogs,fd4lb8a,t1_fd2ryrr,1578168579.0,But then how does he fix his shirt and pants though?
BungouStrayDogs,fd4kvu4,t1_fd43x1p,1578168525.0,She's even got Chuuya's attitude and Dazai's skill in bothering Kunikida lol
BungouStrayDogs,fd4kmq5,t1_fd32vpx,1578168425.0,Aaawww Boooo D:  But thanks for the info anyway!
Lolita,fczuyy0,t1_fczq4p9,1578109059.0,Ah! I found one! [https://i.pinimg.com/564x/89/3b/4c/893b4c736a954068ef1074c463760622.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/89/3b/4c/893b4c736a954068ef1074c463760622.jpg) Military Lolita with cravat!!! and she's got the brooch at her throat just like I want to do! The blouse that they show with the skirt in the pictures is actually black..... and the blouse picture I included also had a version in black. I'm unsure whether I should get the shirt black as well but.... I do want to keep the tights black.
Lolita,fcywdd0,t1_fcvvf49,1578088531.0,It seems like there's mild math involved in telling which one you are by the measurements and I would ask for help (because sometimes my brain hurts I'm sorry) but god that's so embarrassing. Everyone will know my size after that \*flinches\* But I will say thank you so much for the advice! I'd actually like to know myself honestly...
Lolita,fcw3lmz,t1_fcvwxn0,1578016361.0,"you know I was actually thinking something similar...... it's like something a southern belle would wear sorta. Or it gave me that vibe. I think probably the main reason I wanna wear lolita (I once wore a dress that was lolita shaped, but was for a cosplay and was very bright green but it gave me a feeling) is that it makes me feel (or I deeply feel it will) Fancy. I don't know how to say it other than that. That I would feel. Fancy. Feminine, fancy, dignified, and I feel like the feeling is pleasantly warm. And this, despite the fact that the dress was a shade of green that made you almost walk into a wall it was so blinding. But it was lacy, and it had a bell skirt, and an adorable bow in the font.  Good times lol (I already have a peti-coat from the cosplay so at least I don't have to buy a new one!!! very fluffy)

What was I saying? Oh, that yeah it gives off that kind of vibe and since I'm from the USA I kinda feel like that's also sorta dignified."
Lolita,fcvtwnc,t1_fcvsuov,1578010009.0,Sounds like Mary Janes might be the best choice lol. I'm such a clumsy girl with weak ankles that I don't want to break ; n ;  I have no idea what my body shape is. I feel like a fucking potato and probably look like one so I don't know.
Lolita,fcvslzv,t1_fcvrr8z,1578009177.0,"Thank you! Yeah the last one........ it's so hard because I love it so much but at the same time I don't think it would work. I'm not sure why I like it so much I just do TT \_ TT I don't even like short sleeves! Ugh. I actually put together a little imagey thing based off one of the skirts that might be the start of something, I think I'll edit the post and add it?"
seiyuu,fctr8ll,t3_ed6fkm,1577955351.0,We need this on r/BungouStrayDogs lol!
AskReddit,fcnzxks,t3_ei4bkv,1577821590.0,"Lucky me! The Armed Detective Agency is on the case! Dazai will know what to do! And if all else fails, the President can just bride Ranpo-san with praise and I'm 100% found."
BungouStrayDogs,fcg3e3j,t1_fcepjrq,1577636148.0,Thank you! <3
BungouStrayDogs,fcdgzum,t1_fcakkhc,1577609922.0,"I think I see it too! Perhaps leaning even closer toward western than the examples I found, but I can really see that. (Fashions evolved within themselves as well)

Whatever it is I love it anyway\~"

BungouStrayDogs,fcdfpcs,t1_fcakc89,1577609584.0,"I considered that as well...... the only thing that made me think it had to be Rat Boy committing the crime is because of what he said in the movie when he revealed that he too was effected by the fog. He said crime and punishment go together or something like that. And the imagery implied that Rat Boy was CRIME, and his ability was PUNISHMENT. Idk the movie was weird though XD I'm not sure what to think about that guy."
BungouStrayDogs,fc9s9b2,t1_fc9s1p2,1577557448.0,The horrified confusion on his face when Dazai got him brought me so much fucking joy
BungouStrayDogs,fc9ruvp,t1_fc9q0q4,1577557272.0,Scary! Rat Boy is scary! Also here look at this  https://imgur.com/OkW0ZWE
BungouStrayDogs,fc9f65z,t1_fc8ddl7,1577551773.0,"That's what I said, just in a round about way. Mostly because I'm the kind of person who's reluctant to say something is canon if I'm not 120% positive it is."
RoleplayingForReddit,fc9eiyt,t1_fc84a1c,1577551465.0,"Just curious, but what do you think caused it this time?"
BungouStrayDogs,fc5juqg,t3_efm2be,1577459565.0,"Despite the fact that this is an AU, I feel like everything up until the point where Dazai shows up is what would definitely have happened in just the regular non-AU story, and I gotta say, even though I can't read Japanese..... HOLY FUCK AKUTAGAWA... he was a brutal child..... I mean understandable but holy fucking shit."
RoleplayingForReddit,fc3id31,t1_fc3i5tp,1577390452.0,Absolutely!!!! <3

BungouStrayDogs,fbwy4q3,t1_fbuzrox,1577162648.0,That guy had short hair I think....... I kinda wasn't expecting him to die. He kinda had a cute face so I thought he might live. Nope.
