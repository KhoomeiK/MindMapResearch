Things like pto, vacation, retirement, and yes insurance. If something is extremely important to be covered it is important to ensure the employer can or will have that covered in the insurance. 

You can always offer to decline the insurance in exchange for higher pay and go through the marketplace. Often you can get tax credits that apply upfront and reduce premiums.
