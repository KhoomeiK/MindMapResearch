fatlogic,ffdrwgr,t1_ffbxmce,1579827412.0,I was raised that the best thing to have with a sandwich is lays wavy potato chips dipped in cottage cheese and that stuff is the bomb. I’ll eat the whole tub and bag in one go if no one stops me.
fatlogic,ffbepvx,t1_ffa62v4,1579762097.0,"Same but with Pringle’s. I’ll get one of the big tubes, leave the store, stick it in my cup holder and it will be halfway to mostly gone by the time I get home. I don’t go near Pringle’s anymore."

Bernie: I’ve been fighting for the American people for a long time, since well before the 80’s. 

Hillary: *gasps* Vintage! So adorable! 

Bernie: Thanks! *walks away*

Hillary (to Warren): That is the ugliest effing campaign I’ve ever seen."
halloween,felyq9w,t1_feleymc,1579234375.0,Have you considered wigs? I know there are a few companies that sell split color lace front [wigs](https://www.amazon.com/Straight-Synthetic-Halloween-Replacement-Hair/dp/B07Z91QDRL/ref=mp_s_a_1_14?keywords=split+wig+lace+front&qid=1579234303&sr=8-14) . They usually need a little plucking and dry shampoo but they can look pretty natural without the commitment.

trippinthroughtime,fdhnrlh,t1_fdh2hyr,1578426544.0,I like this interpretation a lot more. I hadn’t thought about it in this way but I can get behind this
trippinthroughtime,fdhf86l,t1_fdhdz99,1578421387.0,"Yeah, you’re probably right. All I can say is communication skills are hard, yo. I’m not perfect at it and neither is anyone else. I’m definitely not a passive aggressive person in real life, I’m much more direct, but when texting that’s my first instinct. Is it a good instinct? Maybe not. But here we are. 

Also I wrote the comment not to bitch about my bf not understanding me but more to just share how I relate to the post, and that my bf not getting my hints actually diffuses my anger because I genuinely think it’s cute and gives me a second to reflect on if getting mad was actually worth it. Like I said, I can’t stay mad at him. Neither one of us are perfect communicators but somehow it works. 

My comment may have come out the wrong way but I stand by it."

trippinthroughtime,fdhbhu0,t1_fdgkw1q,1578419404.0,"I kind of wish my bf would understand this but he’s so adorably oblivious to it. 

I never, ever use “K” in a normal text. I save that shit for when I’m furious. I’m usually pretty wordy so when I shut down and respond “K” you would think he would notice something’s up. 

But no, he carries on with the conversation, emojis and all, completely oblivious to my silent fury at whatever he said that pissed me off in the first place. But it’s hard to stay mad at the dummy."

fatlogic,fd2v7gh,t1_fd0cvaj,1578151922.0,"Omg same boat.It was so easy to lie about my weight to myself because it’s distributed evenly.(aka “I wear my weight well”). At my heaviest this summer I hit 190lbs at 5’9”. Sure, not obese, but still 30lbs outside of my healthy range and 45lbs away from my goal weight. But since I’m tall I would constantly get comments like “OMG stop you’re not overweight you’re so thin!!!!1!” Like no bitch I’m already having hip and knee pain from the excess weight and I’d like to stop living in denial about it."
SandersForPresident,fd2rp52,t1_fd2kq9p,1578150987.0,"True, but Bernie not accepting their donations doesn’t stop anyone from being a decent person and using the recourses at their disposal to better society. It’s not like they’re all sitting around desperately wanting to help the world but are waiting on a written invitation. Obviously putting all our hopes in the hands of billionaires is not the solution, but these people could easily show through their actions who they really are. There is nothing stopping any of them from actually contributing. They’re just assholes."
antinatalism,fcxjuw7,t1_fcu3qa5,1578064713.0,"Absolutely. I worked for a while at a preschool in an affluent part of town and we had two siblings from a Chinese family there. The older sister had been taking piano lessons since before she was three years old. And apparently she’s quite good at it, just in the time I was there she went to competitions and galas in Vienna, Carnegie hall, etc. she practices about 3 hours every day. And she’s 5 right now, she’ll be 6 soon. 

I wouldn’t even think it was that bad if she actually liked it. except I heard her tell the other kids all the time that she doesn’t like playing piano but she has to because “she’s a prodigy”. Her parents have basically brainwashed her into thinking it’s her reason for being on this earth to play piano and make it a career and when she’s at school she’s a miserable spaced-out zombie with no attention span because she doesn’t have the energy for anything else besides piano. It’s heartbreaking. 

Oh and side note the younger brother basically has none of this pressure. He’s 3 and a delightful, happy, normal little boy from what I can tell."
