SuicideWatch,ffgofg2,t1_ffgo7ku,1579911014.0,It may be good to at least try making the conscious decision again for your hobbies. You can try walking as a start.
SuicideWatch,ffgo1hs,t1_ffgnwm4,1579910740.0,We did establish that you do want to do them. So it’s a matter of keeping those changes consistent?
SuicideWatch,ffgnpdv,t1_ffgniuv,1579910504.0,"Ok. So to sum things up, you’re trying to find a solution for wanting to be proactive in the changes for your habits?"
SuicideWatch,ffgnfug,t1_ffgnd3v,1579910318.0,I see. How about family?
SuicideWatch,ffgn8w7,t1_ffgn7tq,1579910187.0,I see. It doesn’t help then?
SuicideWatch,ffgn6b5,t1_ffgn39i,1579910138.0,Do you tell her the stuff you mentioned ?
SuicideWatch,ffgmudi,t1_ffgm7cn,1579909908.0,"Ok. If I may ask, how are things in your personal life?"
SuicideWatch,ffgl5z8,t1_ffgktbj,1579908773.0,I see. Would you be willing to try walking again as a hobby?
SuicideWatch,ffgkioi,t1_ffgkdmx,1579908336.0,Ok. That’s definitely a good start to how you can set that hobby. You do know what works for you in that regard. How about the other ones?
SuicideWatch,ffgk0vl,t1_ffgjoz1,1579908011.0,What goals did you make for starting out those hobbies?
SuicideWatch,ffgjiic,t1_ffgjcxs,1579907675.0,"Ok. Also, have you tried looking for a hobby to keep you occupied?"
SuicideWatch,ffgj4fy,t1_ffgiudv,1579907418.0,Did you try letting yourself stay away from online longer or deciding to log off earlier than you want to?
SuicideWatch,ffgioo2,t1_ffgij1n,1579907126.0,Ok. Have you done any efforts before on reducing your online time?
SuicideWatch,ffgi97a,t1_ffgi6z0,1579906840.0,I see. How much time do you normally spend online?
SuicideWatch,ffgi06x,t1_ffgho6z,1579906678.0,"From what you told me, you do make efforts to study, work and look after yourself. To continue, what areas are you looking to improve on?"
SuicideWatch,ffghjxl,t1_ffghefo,1579906382.0,"I’m sorry to hear that it makes it worse for you. If I may ask, what do you normally do on a daily basis?"
SuicideWatch,ffgh21z,t1_ffggvqm,1579906063.0,"I see. Still, it may be a good idea to have a support system around for your emotional health and support. You mentioned that you are aware of what you have to do. The problem is starting it or doing it consistently?"
SuicideWatch,ffggcxe,t1_ffgg1g4,1579905613.0,Is there any reason why?
SuicideWatch,ffgd4e8,t1_ffgd0ek,1579903579.0,"I see. You mentioned that talking to others about this didn’t help you feel better, right?"
SuicideWatch,ffgcwiz,t1_ffgcgea,1579903442.0,It can be a cause for executive dysfunction.
SuicideWatch,ffgcavq,t1_ffgc24i,1579903074.0,Have you been diagnosed with depression before?
SuicideWatch,ffgbsir,t1_ffgbmev,1579902764.0,Is it possible that it may be executive function disorder?
SuicideWatch,ffgbgjx,t1_ffgb5ky,1579902560.0,"From my understanding and experience, it’s when you have negative thoughts about things that you wouldn’t want to think or act on. They can show up randomly or -in my case- when you’re about to do certain things during your day. There is the chance that they may become a fixation."
SuicideWatch,ffgb3lu,t1_ffgb0ne,1579902339.0,Do you have intrusive thoughts?
SuicideWatch,ffgaqjf,t1_ffgajd2,1579902119.0,I see. What exactly causes that internal conflict of wanting/not wanting to do something?
SuicideWatch,ffgaa2d,t1_ffg9oro,1579901839.0,That’s one that I heard more than once.
SuicideWatch,ffga8hw,t1_ffg9oro,1579901813.0,Did you try the one mini habit of just going on a walk outside for a few minutes?
SuicideWatch,ffg8sim,t1_ffg8bix,1579900922.0,I see. You mentioned mini-habits. What were those exactly?
SuicideWatch,ffg879s,t1_ffg7utc,1579900561.0,I’m so sorry to hear about that. You mentioned before about having a three month period of having consistent exercise and self care. Did that improve your wellbeing during that time? What exactly did you do then?
SuicideWatch,ffg6vn0,t1_ffg6tl0,1579899736.0,Was there any one method that you believed worked for you?
SuicideWatch,ffg680o,t1_ffg64um,1579899331.0,"I see. If you’re comfortable telling me, what exactly have you tried?"
SuicideWatch,ffg5hjr,t1_ffg552x,1579898880.0,You mentioned having no motivation to do things. How long has that been around?

SuicideWatch,ffg4y9n,t1_ffg0oxz,1579898555.0,How so?
SuicideWatch,fffzyyy,t1_fffyiqt,1579895487.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that. You must have tried plenty of things to improve your situation. You’re already on the right track by noting what you have to work on. If I may ask, have you told anyone else about how you have been feeling like friends, family, a campus counselor, etc.?"
SuicideWatch,fffkjz6,t1_ffeebe8,1579885961.0,"Hey. Sorry for the late response. Anyways, is there anything else that you’re comfortable telling me about?"
SuicideWatch,fffi9pk,t1_fffi6by,1579884549.0,Thanks!
SuicideWatch,fffi1rm,t1_fffi0kj,1579884416.0,"Currently, a Bachelors in Biology."
SuicideWatch,fffhyg1,t1_fffhvaw,1579884357.0,"Right!
I didn’t know that thesis’s were a thing for a Masters."
SuicideWatch,fffhpci,t1_fffho6d,1579884201.0,Oh. Bacteria staining?
SuicideWatch,fffhii9,t1_fffhhku,1579884080.0,Oh. What kind did you do?
SuicideWatch,fffgx9c,t1_fffgulr,1579883714.0,Did you ever have to do an experiment like that with E.Coli to get it to glow in the dark?
SuicideWatch,fffgmxx,t1_fffgl1g,1579883536.0,Like introducing foreign DNA to bacteria?
SuicideWatch,fffgivl,t1_fffggq1,1579883466.0,I see. Where does the technology part come in?
SuicideWatch,fffgaz0,t1_fffga8i,1579883330.0,What’s that like?
SuicideWatch,fffg7w4,t1_fffg6sj,1579883277.0,"That’s amazing!
What major?"
SuicideWatch,ffffzzm,t1_ffff6z0,1579883142.0,This is for a PhD?
SuicideWatch,ffff5lv,t1_ffff3kg,1579882620.0,I’m so sorry to hear that. Thesis? Are you in a university?
SuicideWatch,ffff17a,t1_fffezrh,1579882544.0,How about school?
SuicideWatch,fffeymx,t1_fffewr8,1579882499.0,That’s good to hear. I’ll hope that things will be better for you soon.
SuicideWatch,fffepk3,t1_fffeko8,1579882337.0,"Ah. I see.
It’s not too late to try again."
SuicideWatch,fffef3v,t1_fffe52v,1579882154.0,What do you mean exactly?
SuicideWatch,fffe3kb,t1_fffdg29,1579881947.0,The best thing you can do for that is to make time for exercise and find healthy changes for your diet. Starving yourself can do more harm than good if you’re looking to lose weight.
SuicideWatch,fffcfqq,t1_fffc7ps,1579880898.0,"You don’t have to go through that alone. Also, you do have a lot of courage to be open about what you’re going through like this."
SuicideWatch,fffc6xs,t1_fffc04s,1579880745.0,Change in what way?
SuicideWatch,fffboun,t1_fffbjh2,1579880426.0,"That, I can’t be certain of. I’m certainly no expert when it comes to relationships. What I can say is that now is the best time to look after yourself and find a solid support system for you."
SuicideWatch,fffbgcd,t1_fffbf29,1579880277.0,Ok. What else would you like to tell me?
SuicideWatch,fffbbcu,t1_fffajt6,1579880187.0,Sure! Would you like to continue talking?
SuicideWatch,fffay4g,t1_fffajt6,1579879949.0,"Ok. As for the blaming yourself thing, if you do find this helpful for you, it may be a good idea to make time for self care. If it’s worth anything, it wasn’t your fault for what happened. Like I said, it’s not too late for you to make new friends."
SuicideWatch,fffadex,t1_fffaba7,1579879586.0,I see. Are you able to tell whoever’s looking after you about this?
SuicideWatch,fffa9lo,t1_fffa7sb,1579879518.0,Are you still there? Are you finding it better for you or worse?
SuicideWatch,fffa6dy,t1_fffa2ij,1579879460.0,"I see. You must have had a lot to manage at the time, and I’m sorry that you had to go through that. Are you on any new meds?"
SuicideWatch,fff9z9g,t1_fff9ut8,1579879330.0,"If you’re comfortable telling me, what caused the nervous breakdown?"
SuicideWatch,fff9tp0,t1_fff9m2j,1579879231.0,"Ok. Continuing on, you went to another professional to get off of those same meds, and you were living without meds until a nervous breakdown a couple of months ago. From that, was your overall well-being improving after getting off of the meds?"
SuicideWatch,fff9k6r,t1_fff98hx,1579879059.0,"Ok. So to sum up things so far, you had a tumor, and you went to a hospital to get it treated. Due to stuff like not wanting to eat or sleep at certain times, you were admitted into multiple psychiatries without testing if you had a mental disorder. Next, from the pills that you were given at the time, they made you do things you never intended to do to someone you liked, this causing them to block you for almost a year. Am I right so far?"
SuicideWatch,fff96uu,t1_fff90aa,1579878816.0,"Mentally speaking, you were fine beforehand?"
SuicideWatch,fff8ytn,t1_fff8txc,1579878668.0,Sorry if there’s a lot of questions. I just want to get a better idea of what’s going on.
SuicideWatch,fff8wap,t1_fff8txc,1579878620.0,It wasn’t for any mental condition?
SuicideWatch,fff8ss6,t1_fff8ps0,1579878556.0,"So, refusing to eat and wanting to go to bed? Stuff like that?"
SuicideWatch,fff8nhg,t1_fff8i5c,1579878457.0,"If I may ask, what did you mean by timetables?"
SuicideWatch,fff8fqk,t1_fff8efg,1579878307.0,What for exactly?
SuicideWatch,fff8a50,t1_fff88av,1579878199.0,Unruly behavior?
SuicideWatch,fff81d7,t1_fff7ppj,1579878028.0,"Right. To continue, what exactly prompted having to be sent to psychiatry?"
SuicideWatch,fff7ovk,t1_fff7e45,1579877791.0,"You didn’t know that things would turn out the way they did, right?
Still, I’m sure that you certainly had no intention to hurt her."
SuicideWatch,fff7al7,t1_fff79ug,1579877517.0,Why’s that?
SuicideWatch,fff77mt,t1_fff72y4,1579877460.0,You weren’t in your right mind then. That certainly isn’t something that blames you.
SuicideWatch,fff715h,t1_fff6fd8,1579877335.0,"From what you told me, you didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. Also, you can still make friends -whether online or in your personal life-if you need someone to talk to about your feelings."
SuicideWatch,fff6cko,t1_fff62xc,1579876842.0,"You still feel guilty about what happened, right?"
SuicideWatch,fff61wn,t1_fff5x91,1579876625.0,Have you told her about the pills and what they did to you?
SuicideWatch,fff5prz,t1_fff5j0z,1579876379.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that. To clarify, is she the reason why you’re considering this, or was it a culmination of the reasons you told me?"
SuicideWatch,fff5aro,t1_fff5a0a,1579876069.0,The same ones?
SuicideWatch,fff59b7,t1_fff50ch,1579876038.0,You also said that this happened almost a year ago. Was there anything going on since then?
SuicideWatch,fff4zqp,t1_fff4ya6,1579875845.0,I see. Are you still on those medications?
SuicideWatch,fff4v6d,t1_fff4szp,1579875751.0,And those things caused her to block you?
SuicideWatch,fff4hwh,t1_fff4adr,1579875480.0,You mentioned before about doing horrible things on them? What did you mean exactly?
SuicideWatch,fff4519,t1_fff43zn,1579875208.0,Is there a counselor that you’re comfortable talking to?
SuicideWatch,fff430r,t1_fff40yx,1579875165.0,Are you attending any school?
SuicideWatch,fff3yfg,t1_fff3vm0,1579875067.0,How about family?
SuicideWatch,fff3tp7,t1_fff3r76,1579874965.0,"From the people that you do talk to, are they friends, family, etc.?"
SuicideWatch,fff3nsj,t1_fff3jvm,1579874837.0,"If I may ask, is there anyone that you can confide in or talk to in your personal life about what you’re going through?"
SuicideWatch,fff3fc9,t1_fff3dx9,1579874656.0,And you said taking them made you feel worse? How long were you taking them?
SuicideWatch,fff3chz,t1_fff3btg,1579874594.0,What for then?
SuicideWatch,fff39ro,t1_fff363x,1579874532.0,Ok. You mentioned pills. Were they meant to help treat you for bpd?
SuicideWatch,fff35jq,t1_fff33fr,1579874440.0,I see. Was either ever treated?
SuicideWatch,fff307h,t1_fff2xru,1579874324.0,I see. I’m so sorry to hear about your condition. How did it turn out for your search?
SuicideWatch,fff2sfb,t1_fff2o10,1579874155.0,They were supposed to treat you for something? May I ask what were you in there for?
SuicideWatch,fff2grg,t1_fff2fkk,1579873898.0,Someone at psychiatry?
SuicideWatch,fff2dwn,t1_fff28nv,1579873837.0,"If you don’t mind, may I ask how psychiatry factored into her blocking you?"
SuicideWatch,fff22k1,t1_fff21fs,1579873582.0,"If you’re comfortable, would you like to elaborate?"
SuicideWatch,fff20nk,t1_fff206d,1579873539.0,A crush?
