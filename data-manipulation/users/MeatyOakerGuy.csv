customhearthstone,fem9t0t,t3_epgdhi,1579245135.0,With the recent changes and buffs to the weaker heroes I’d rather have pyramad or patches than this. You gain absolutely 0 tempo in the early game and you’d take bottom 4 a majority of your games with this hero.
customhearthstone,fem9lwu,t3_epurs5,1579244890.0,"It’s a cool idea, but the lack of tempo and damage you’d take sitting with cards in your hand would make you take way too much damage early on. The 6 drop is a bit too late to need the demons for buff purposes, the 3 drop is almost unplayable because if you’re holding cards (especially enough to make a taunt that matters). You’re gonna die. Demons are already very very strong"
