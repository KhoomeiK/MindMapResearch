ADHD,ffj6bky,t1_ffj54sy,1579991500.0,"Clearly you didn't read the entirety of my post, nor any of the other responding comments, or my responses. I literally said verbatim in my post that I don't blame him in the slighest and that I apologize to him when I get frustrated, because it is frustrating, it would be for anyone. I've said I'm well aware it's not my responsibility to take care of a grown man. The vape was an Christmas gift. And the entire point of the post was looking for advice on how to help him better. That's what you do when you love somebody, you don't just give up because it's difficult. I outlined all of the things that I'm responsible for in order to stress the areas his disabilities affect the most, it doesn't have shit to do with validation. 

Furthermore, I have told him that I refuse to keep doing things for him and have given him a time limit in order for him to do better. Again, you'd know that if you read any of the other responding comments or my responses. If you're going to be argumentative and negative rather than actually offer any help, your opinion isn't needed here. If your input were more along the lines of ""hey, you seem like you might be enabling him a little bit and maybe that's why things aren't getting better"", that'd be one thing. But you're just being combative and not actually helpful."

AmItheAsshole,fexdq9w,t3_eqpkz1,1579429292.0,"NTA. I had two little girls who I literally considered my children, they were my entire world. They were sisters from the same litter that I'd adopted right as they hit the 8 week mark. In 2017 I lost them both when my apartment burned down while I was at work one day, they weren't even a year old yet. It was an electrical fire that started in the wall. Given its been a few years obviously I'm mostly in an okay place when I think about them. But there are days where I'll see or read something regarding a fire, I'll smell burning wood or smoke, and suddenly I'm a mess. And so many of the times I think back to that day, I always think to myself that I would give anything to have been able to give them a painless, peaceful death. One where I was right there with them holding their paws and kissing their heads, and telling them how much I love them as they fell into a peaceful sleep for the last time. I would give literally anything in the world to have given my girls what you gave your kitty. My babies died terrified, in pain, huddled in my closet looking and calling for their mama who wasn't there. 

To have the option of giving them a peaceful passing with you by their side is more of a blessing than so many people realize, and your baby was lucky to have been able to spend their last moments with you, knowing they were safe and loved."
ADHD,fex7fms,t1_fewmheo,1579425989.0,"Firstly I just wanted to thank you for volunteering your perspective. I have firsthand experience with how difficult it is trying to help other people grasp the concept of something they can't understand or relate to. I'm an addict in recovery, and just the way you wrote your analogy about the TV remotes reminds me of the way I've tried to explain active addiction to people. Things being both in your control and also out of it. The best way I've come to describe active addiction is that basically it's as though you have this evil twin who takes control of your body, your life, while you still remain trapped on the inside, only able to look out through the eyes. It walks, it talks, and acts just like you but it's not. It starts doing things that you'd never do, but you physically can't do anything to stop it. You'll watch yourself risk friendships, relationships. You'll sacrifice anything and anyone who means something to you, willingly risking death every time. Nobody in their right mind would actively choose to live such a life, which I imagine is similar to your struggles with ADHD. If you don't mind me asking, what medication/dosage are you on? Trying to figure out what dose would be best for him is frustrating and has taken forever.

 And as far as the boundary thing is concerned, I have done literally exactly that, 3 months and all. I said to him exactly as you did, that even if he doesn't realize it consciously, he has no sense of urgency because he knows I'll pick up the remaining slack. I've told him I'm not his mother, and I'm not doing shit for him anymore. Granted, as I said above, I'm fairly certain there are other factors that influence his behaviors I mentioned above. If he just had ADHD alone that'd be one thing. But he has ADHD, I'm almost positive he's a high functioning autistic, and was never taught any basic life skills regarding Independence, or given any guidance needed to navigate the adult world as a toddler or even a teen. Probably seems natural for most people. But if all our parents did when we were growing up was dress us, feed us, and keep us alive without teaching us any of the important or necessary things parents are SUPPOSED to teach us in order to function in the adult world, I imagine we'd be similarly fucked up."

ADHD,few4x94,t1_fev7l4a,1579405427.0,"He's well aware, I've had many discussions with him regarding the pressure it puts on me to be in the position I am. The problem is it's not that he's uncaring or ignorant to my feelings, it's not how he WANTS to be, I doubt anyone would. He knows of his shortcomings and is well aware of his failures. And I know it absolutely eats at his self worth and self esteem to constantly be reminded how much he's failing me. It's hard for both of us, and again, I don't blame him for it. 

Tons of people grow up in shitty home environments with shitty parents. And most people find a way to adapt as a result. However, certain types of people are incapable of coping and adapting the same way most do, hence my hypothesis about him being on the spectrum. You can't tell by looking at him, or even talking to him really. You have to really know him to see the things that I have in order to recognize his behaviors/actions are just different enough to indicate something more. Combining his mental inhibitions and his childhood, he was pretty much born at a disadvantage to overcome his circumstances. Being born with ADHD and high functioning autism is tough even for a child born to wonderful parents. But to be raised with absolutely no guidance or care in accordance to those specific needs, naturally they'd be developmentally stunted if those needs were never met when it was most important to their development. 

We've basically talked about all of this, I'm a fairly decent communicator. He knows that there is a limit for my patience and financial support among other things. I have made my boundaries very clear of what I will and will not do for him going forward, and that by a certain time his time on the clock for doing better is up. That's where we are currently. Again I just wanted to maybe hear from someone on the other end of things who can help me understand my boyfriend's point of view a little better from a personal standpoint, and maybe any advice."
ADHD,fevdvsn,t1_fev72b4,1579396296.0,"No I very much appreciate the response from someone else in my position, so thank you for taking the time to read in the first place. And yes unfortunately we've had many sit downs about how unfair our current dynamic is to me whether it's his fault or not, because regardless it still doesn't change the present state of things. 

But yeah what it seems to me is a very very bad combination of things such as the ADHD which is out of his control, in addition to the absolute garbage environment that he grew up in. It doesn't exactly all add up to the most functional adult. And I know at the end of the day it's not my responsibility to teach a grown man how to actually BE a grown man, there's just so many levels to it and things that get in the way that prevent a simpler more direct solution. I wish it was a simple as sitting down and saying look, this is how things are, this is how it makes me feel, and this is what needs to change. I know because I've done it many times at this point. And it's not that he's unaware of any of it, so the more he fails, the more it adds to his guilt and lessens his self worth. And that in turn pains me to see, because I know he doesn't WANT to be this way, nobody would. 

And as far as the Adderall goes, I know I may be leaning a little too heavily on that avenue as a complete  solution, so thank you for that insight. And luckily he no longer drinks at all. He used to drink like a fish in the beginning because it took away his physical pain as it was his only escape from a suffering that never ends, but I had to put a stop to it and he's been fine since  I just want his medication to be able to put him in a place where he's capable of seeing the light to start crawling out of the hole he's in, because as you said, it is absolutely exhausting. Living life as an individual in general is exhausting, let alone an additional being that SHOULD have been self sufficient long ago. It's like all of the individual problems he has all tangle up together in a giant knot where each issue is either connected, a cause, or a result of the others. It's like an impossible maze to navigate, and with his drawbacks I imagine it'd be almost impossible for him to untangle alone. 

I just don't know how much life I have left in me. I've been in a handful of severely abusive relationships where the problem and solution was a lot more clear cut. Regardless of emotions, if someone who's supposed to love you is intentionally malicious, harmful, or displays any sort of similarly unacceptable behavior, the solution is clear. You figure out how to get out, and you do it. But I don't have that in this situation. There's no evil to remove from my life, no abuse or manipulation or anything like that. It's just...hard. And it makes figuring out the solution that much more difficult because the right answer isn't immediately apparent. It's why I'm so lost. I know I have to do what's best for me in the end, but I know there's a perfectly doable solution in this mess somewhere down the line, be it sooner or later. I'm just unsure how to cope until then, or how long is long enough in terms of waiting patiently for things to change, you know?"

I've just never had to spell it out, I was trying to think of how to properly convey how it's pronounced, it's like saying woof-tees or wuff-tees. I think wufftees sounds more like how we say it.

We went with Cloud (like Final Fantasy Cloud) and Rayne (because I've always wanted to name my daughter that if I ever had a child). So we ended up with Rayne and Cloud as a complete accident in relation to the names.

AskReddit,fenwf19,t3_eq1wzh,1579291853.0,"I just want a place to call home, my own home. I spent years trying to survive the hellhole house I lived in where I was tormented by my stepfather, and my mother just enabled him. Eventually I turned to opiates in order to cope and just to survive living there a little longer, as I was actively suicidal. I know it's usually the other way around, but it was the only thing that was keeping me alive in the short term because my norm was being so depressed and anxious I had zero normal functionality. I couldn't sleep for 3-5 days at a time, even just sitting up to get out of bed felt like treading water. I couldnt work, I barely ate or did anything. I was 24 when I started using, just couldn't take it anymore. The only way my parents realized something was wrong because they saw there were some days that I was functional. 

Given my living environment and subsequent setbacks, I was literally just able to move out this year at 29. I know it's a major accomplishment in and of itself, but obviously I have a ways to go as far as working and saving money, and working on my credit.  I live in a very small house, and there's 4 of us total. My boyfriend, who was in an equally abusive household, our roommate/friend Nick who owns his house, and Nick's boyfriend. And again, obviously it's great that I'm out. But once again, I'm living under the rule and authority of someone else. Someone elses house, someone elses space that they own that isn't mine. And we also have two cats. But due to the big change in size of their previous living environment (his parents two story house) they started acting out a bit at the restricted space. There's holes all over our roommates leather couch just from them chasing each other all over it, they'd claw the carpet, run around at 3am and wake them up. They never did any of this at their old house and I was so anxious about it I couldn't sleep at night. So we just started keeping them in our small room 90% of the time and it kills me. I don't let them outside on their own as they'd 100% be hit by a car where we live, and neither of them will move at all if we put them in harnesses to walk them outside to stretch their legs. 

We all just feel suffocated and I just...I want a home that's mine. I've never, ever in my life felt that I had my own home. Even growing up I was constantly reminded by my stepfather that it was HIS house, not mine, and that if I didn't like it I could get the fuck out. I'm just so tired of not feeling like I have a real home to go back to, somewhere I don't have to hide myself or my animals so that they don't bother others, feeling like I have to erase any evidence of my existence in the house in case it bothers someone.  

I just recently acquired a secured credit card to start repairing my credit after I ran it into the ground during my addiction, and I finally got a well paying job this year and am just starting to save money. I'm on my way, I just want a home. It's all I've ever wanted, nothing more."

AskReddit,fdmzrsl,t1_fdmx6gn,1578572728.0,"Yeah thats more what I figured would affect you in the long term was issues with talking. Cuz as a kid, all you really take from hardly being allowed to speak is that no one really wants you to. No one wants to talk with you, or hear what you have to say unless you're dying. That's just so....incredibly heartbreaking and cruel to do to a child. Like, someone can't be that naive to think that something like that wouldn't cause irreparable damage to a child that young.

I work front desk at my hotel, and my boyfriend works maintenance here as well. Except the issue here was with one of our male guests who was a gay married man, whose husband was also staying here. My bf had gone up to help them with something, but only one husband was present. He started talking to my bf saying stuff he'd like to do to him, like he'd ""suck his cock real nice"" that'd he'd ""give him a massage and slowly rub his balls"" and ""take advantage of him."" It was a whole thing and frankly I was horrified after he told me. And they were like, 3 decade long regulars, on our cork board behind the desk there's actually a photo of them with our bosses. I told our GM about it and he was equally horrified and apologized to my boyfriend for it. And even worse because they were well aware of who I was in terms of my relationship to my boyfriend and the next time I'd seen the couple together, the guilty husband would just talk to me like he'd said none of the rancid shit he'd said to my boyfriend.
