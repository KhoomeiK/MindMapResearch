Abby sounds rude af. The kind of crap she's saying suggests to me she's insecure or angry about something to do with children (choosing not to have them, seeing them as burdensome but societally expected... Who knows?).

I have another illness that was the catalyst for going casual. I don't go to work to work at least twice a month due to my depression. I fight. I keep fighting. It's hard but it's better than barely existing and not being employed.

What helps lessen the days I take off is using a checklist of the most BASIC stuff I need to do every day to function with a bit of super basic self care. Eat x3 (normally I manage 2 meals), take my medication x2, brush my teeth x2, shower x2, skin care x2, make my bed, read for half an hour and put my clean clothes out for the following day.

If girls are washing their hair every single day and you're hardly washing your hair... Whose hair is the likely problem? Theirs. Has there been any evidence to the contrary? Is maintenance collecting the hair and saving it? I would consider their action toward you as harassment and bullying. I am sorry that these people are so stupid.

AmItheAsshole,ff0wfyz,t3_eqxekx,1579472920.0,"NTA. It was clear that your sister should've left her child at home. If she couldn't find a sitter she should have been at home. Your sister opted not to do that. She also opted not to ensure her child was supervised whilst in your home. You made it very clear that your studio was a ""no go"" area.

At 9, going into an area you've expressly been told not to, damaging something INTENTIONALLY and laughing about it whilst being discovered screams there's bigger issues at play and your sister would've been aware.

I bet you've grossly undercharged your sister in relationship to the hours put into it, materials cost, pressure to finish the commission and the delay it will have on other work. If she doesn't like the bill as it is. Give her the bill you'd bill a client for the work to date if they decided not to proceed!
