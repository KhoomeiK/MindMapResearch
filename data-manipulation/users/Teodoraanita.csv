AskReddit,fcjmwz3,t3_ehg5ac,1577694450.0,"I don't know if it saved me exactly, but my gut feeling says so to this day. My class went on a school trip with the Nun that teached us our religion class. We went to this nice little church, had a picnic, everyone had a really nice time. When the bus got us back, it was little after 10 pm. The bus stop is one street from my home, and that was the only time that day that I was on my own. Then a car started to follow me. I was freaked out. I was 13 at the time, and still went by the stranger-danger rule that my mother instilled. This guy opens the passanger doors and asks me what time it is. I thought it was strange, because I could see he had a nice wrist watch, but I told him aniway, because I'm a kid and I'm still under impression that I'm supposed to be polite to everyone. I thought that was it, and went back to go home, but this guy still follows me, the door to the car still open. He asks me where I live and if I needed a ride. That gave me a bad feeling, you could see I was a kid, and I looked even younger than my age. I said no, because I was next to my building by now. He insisted that u get in his car, 3 or 4 more times, and I still said no. I guess he got annoyed by me and left. Few days later, there was news on TV that a young girl was found dead, raped and beaten in the next town over, and that guy in custody."
