ADHD,fehg7qu,t1_fehetpw,1579115890.0,"Thanks for sharing! Looking at it, I definitely tick a lot of the very often boxes except I'm not fidgety. I don't talk a lot but if I'm having a one on one conversation, I could talk the pants off someone. I still remember the time someone has got up and left while I was still talking, that was 10 years ago.

Interrupting others when they're busy, is something I used to do a lot but I managed to stop doing so much because one time one of my past bosses got annoyed with me for doing that.

I do interrupt people when they're speaking, I often hear 'let me finish' - I used to think they just spoke too long or I want to talk before I forget what I was going to say. I've recognised this has happened a few times and it makes me feel like I am a rude person who doesn't think or respect others, even though I do."
ADHD,fehbif8,t1_fegqjde,1579113149.0,"I know someone who is ADHD and almost 40. Very impulsive, does things without thinking them through - sort of like being adventurous or a risk-taker, talks a lot and moves from one relationship to another very quickly, 2 weeks minimum."

ADHD,fedkncm,t3_ed9cs2,1579013895.0,"I have way too many things to do it's overwhelming but I have been hyper-focusing on drawing, actually, I chop and change what I do. One minute, I'm drawing, next minute I'm coding, next minute I'm hyper-focusing on being healthy etc.

I need to pay my rent, I have the money but I haven't paid it yet. I want to finish my drawing by Friday."
ADHD,fecrzux,t3_dru8q7,1578982381.0,"Start with small things. Maybe start with making your bed. It will make you feel accomplished that you actually did something and improve your mood.

Also if you have dishes in your lounge or bedrooms, make seeing dishes as something you absolutely can't stand seeing unless they're in the kitchen. I had to associate danger like knowing I could stand on a glass cup and cut my foot and not be able to walk anymore or a thousand mice will infest my home and crawl all over me in my sleep if I don't remove them (something outrageous like that)

I had to start small, every day did something small and it has gotten easier. The first thing I did was open my curtains straight after I wake up, I kept doing that until I felt it became a habit, took about a week. Then I started making sure I removed dishes from my room or the lounge. Now I have added making my bed and picking up clothes. You will see over time, it doesn't take very long at all.

The problem I had was thinking it would take forever and that majorly discouraged me but it actually doesn't long at all if you do small amounts every day - I'm terrible with time but this has seemed to help me so far. Good luck :)"

My ex-bf had ADHD and gave me Ritalin one time, he used to talk a lot. And funny thing is, before I dated him, I was the one who talked a lot. It was interesting dating someone who seemed to take over the talking aspect. I went to work that day I took Ritalin and for the first time in my life, I felt present in a meeting. I was so focussed and productive and I received praise that day. I'm now going in for an official diagnosis."
ITCareerQuestions,fe20ekd,t3_en8z73,1578833120.0,"Yes, all the time. One of my previous roles was way over my head that I even cried to a friend on my 2nd week and told them I was thinking about quitting.

My fire was burning out, there was so much to learn, above and beyond just IT related things and I was so close to throwing in the towel. But guess what, I stayed and I held on. I settled in by the 3rd month, my confidence grew and my role became like second nature.

It's going to be a wild ride, it's scary and you're going to have learn as much as you can. This is how we improve and grow. Unless you choose not to learn, one day, you'll look back and say to yourself, I'm glad I stuck it out."
ITCareerQuestions,fe1yktl,t3_enfo8p,1578832391.0,"Yes. I have only been a contractor for 2 years, my last one was a 3-month contract which ended in September. After that, I couldn't find anything and I've applied for loads of jobs since then - it's harder to find contract work at the end of the year and in Jan.

I've learned my lesson though, as you do. Should've saved way more money for this moment and communicated sooner with my agent - had missed a contract that went to someone else a day too late! I would've been his first choice.

It has been a curse and a blessing at the same time though.  I've had so much time to rethink and re-strategise for next time, time to upskill, lose weight and get myself in a healthier mindset overall. I am looking at going back to full time and have a job lined up for Feb if I don't find a contract sooner. But I prefer to contract, we just need to be savvier next time. Lessons in life are good things :)"

I'm doing a lot better now, but the last 3 months I was in the lowest of lows and felt so lonely I would cry myself to sleep.

ITCareerQuestions,fdwnv27,t3_en1zsb,1578760647.0,"You are actually in a great position to negotiate with your current employer and the new job employer right now. If I were you, I'd have a chat with your boss/manager and would tell them about the new offer. You could ask for an increase in salary, benefits or whatever you need to stay put. If they are as unrivalled as you say they are, then surely they would understand your position.  


>You can't negotiate with anyone unless you can say no; and you can't say no unless you set yourself up with alternatives - Jordan B. Peterson

I know you may feel a bit disloyal to your current employer, but there are many great workplaces like this. I've been in your shoes before, was on $50k and received an offer of over 50% increase plus benefits. Loved the workplace I was in, loved my coworkers but the pay was too low.

I ended up taking the new role and found the environment was so much better. Better office, better flexibility, made even more friends, you name it. I am still friends with my old coworkers to this day. Everything has a risk and I am a risk-taker by nature. This was 6 years ago and honestly, I've come out so much better off because I took those risks. Good luck :)"

I was a drinker for years and everything in my life was 1000x more stressful than it needed to be, my job is stressful too. Once I stopped drinking, I slept so well and was able to think and handle situations a lot better. Maybe give it a try for a couple months and see how you feel."
depression,fdoyk4n,t3_em82f6,1578615819.0,"That was a brave and caring thing for you to do.

I had the same experience twice in high school, it was really sad but I just sat with them and listened. You are a good person and we need more people like you in this world."

learnprogramming,fdo1xqu,t3_emdyim,1578597395.0,"ok heres an example of how I describe it.

An object could be a Dog.

An object has properties.

A dogs properties can be: name, breed, age, gender.

Objects can also have methods (which are functions) - see the function eat and bark.

A dogs method could be: bark, eat, sleep, poo.

let dog = {name: ""Toby"",breed: ""Labrador"",age: 2,gender: ""male"",eat: eat(""dog biscuits""),bark: bark()}

function eat(food) {return ""eating "" + food;}

function bark() {return ""woof woof"";}

console.log([dog.name](https://dog.name) \+ "" likes "" + [dog.eat](https://dog.eat));// returns ""Toby likes eating dog biscuits""

console.log([dog.name](https://dog.name) \+ "" is barking... "" + dog.bark);// returns ""Toby is barking... woof woof""

A module is a reusable piece of code, so I could turn Dog into a module if I want so I can reuse it whenever I need to in case I have more dogs."

\[updated\]: just got off playing the daily box thing plus a couple of beginner rounds. 39 mins and I am definitely feeling a bit of a sweat. If I had gone another round I would feel like I worked out at the gym for sure. Today is my first day.. man I love this. Finally found a way to workout without going to the gym. I can't stand working out at the gym simply because I get anxiety. I have about 20kg to lose. I feel like this, combined with eating a bit better (I'm not that bad I eat pretty healthy) and this game will get me to my goals!"
