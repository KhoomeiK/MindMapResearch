AmItheAsshole,ffei6kj,t1_ffedaxm,1579849000.0,"Yes to all of this.  My dad and son are both red/green colorblind like the OP.  They usually can't tell the difference at all between greens/reds/oranges,  yet neither one has an issue with stop lights.  My dad says he CAN actually see a difference in the color, but it's really more of a hue/brightness thing with the lights.  Green is much brighter than red.  My son hounds me when the light turns green and we aren't moving, so he clearly can tell the difference.  It's also easier to see the differences in bright outdoor lighting."
amarillo,ffcw1gm,t1_ffbcti0,1579808448.0,"No problem!  I get irritated when people come on here asking and everyone just jumps on ""Amarillo sucks, there's nothing to do"" like we're a podunk one stoplight town.  Amarillo certainly has its problems, most cities do, but we don't have lead in the water, there's no absurdly long commutes, and we don't have extreme natural disasters that completely destroy the city and kill dozens of people every few years."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffb6yq5,t1_ffauzw4,1579753461.0,"Yeah, I know.  I was also taught to double space and still struggle to not do it.  But students who WEREN'T taught to double space know that it's fairly normal still for people to do it, so will go in and add spaces.  It's a trick if it's being used to lengthen a paper, and it doesn't add a huge obvious gap.  Doesn't matter if it was a legitimate formatting rule from the past.  I've been struggling to change my double space habit for almost 2 decades.  I gave up and now just 'find and replace' if it's actually important for what I'm working on.  It rarely is."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffal4l8,t1_ffaag7c,1579738475.0,Because that's not noticeable. . .
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffal2aw,t1_ffadfiy,1579738431.0,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but just about every teacher under the age of 45-50 knows this trick, and probably used it themselves in college.  They also know the tricks of line spacing, raising the font by .1, adjusting the size of all punctuation or spaces, using a font that is slightly larger even at the same size, using double spaces after a period (habit to us old folks), and my favorite, character spacing. I used to edit financial policy books and documents (sounds fun, right?) and they would have to fit on a certain amount of pages, so I got pretty good at fiddling with settings to get a 3 page document down to one while not appearing overly edited.  Believe it or not, most decent teachers care less about whether you actually meet the length requirements and more about whether you wrote a good essay.  If you can write an excellently argued, concise essay, but missed your length requirement by a couple inches, I would let the length issue slide."
SubstituteTeachers,ff7tc7t,t3_eru7ct,1579657867.0,"Depends on the class.  Usually something like ""Hey guys,. I'm ______ and I'll be spending the day with you."" or ""Hey, Mr X couldn't make it today, so I'll be filling in.  You can call me _______ or ______ or even *some goofy name* but please refrain from whistling or clapping to get my attention.  I'll think there is a dog in the room and will end up calling for animal removal.""  

Sometimes kids, especially elementary, will come up to me on their way in and say ""Hey, you're not my teacher!"", and depending on the kids I might joke around and say ""I'm not?  Since when?"" and then try to convince them (jokingly) that I really am their teacher.  I just changed my hair or makeup.  Usually gets a laugh and is a fun icebreaker.  There have been a couple high school classes I forget to even introduce myself since the extent of my interaction with the class is taking roll and telling them they have assignments in Google classroom.

I'm actually at the point now that in elementary most of the kids know me, and most of my high school jobs are for the same few teachers, so they know me too. I rarely need to inteoduce myself, so now it's mostly answering questions about where their teacher is or trying to not look too happy when they tell me they are so happy when it's me instead of their ""mean"" teacher.  Cracks me up because I'll sub later and see the same kids complaining about the ""mean"" teacher give that teacher a high five or hug the next week while I'm subbing next door, lol.  Kids are funny!"
SubstituteTeach,ff6uyg0,t3_erx4c8,1579635416.0,"Depends on where I'm working.  If I work at the elementary or intermediate schools, I try to eat something substantial for breakfast, then bring a small snack for lunch. Elementary teachers only have about 20-30 minutes for lunch, and conference periods aren't always guaranteed.  Usually I bring a protein bar or some nuts and fruit, and lots and lots of coffee.  If I work at the middle or high schools, I'll often go to Subway since I know I can get there and back with plenty of time left over. If I sub for a nurse at any school, I bring my own lunch/snacks since  I usually don't get a real lunch.  I get lots of downtime during the day to make up for it, but lunchtime is usually super busy for handing out medications and playground injuries."
facepalm,ff264jo,t1_ff1w9dj,1579494876.0,"Because that happens so often?  Negative conversations about men rarely go ""OMG what is wrong with males?"" Or ""I seriously hate males, y'all."" ""I wish I had a male friend.""  Never once have I heard a woman say anything about males unless we are talking about actual animals or discussing a medical/scientific study or something, and even then, it's used as an adjective, not a noun.  In regular conversation, it's always men.  ""I can't stand men"" ""why are men so dense?"" ""I'd love a good man in my life"".  

So maybe you don't feel like that because 1. It doesn't actually happen with any sort of regularity, and 2. You are not used to be stripped down and feeling like a piece a meat to the opposite gender."

facepalm,feh8aml,t1_fegz34k,1579111214.0,"Centuries?  Go further back.  People have thought the world was on the verge of ending since humans gained the ability to self-reflect.  There are predictions/warnings going back to the most ancient civilizations discovered.  Even if we only focus on Christianity, John thought his Revelations dream would happen in his lifetime.  2000 years ago.  Worries about the world ending isn't new.  What's new is our ability to cause it."
facepalm,feh7t0v,t1_fegreq2,1579110930.0,"I see what you're saying here.  I have family that think along those lines.

The quicker it comes, the better.  The world is fucked, but I can't be bothered to try making it any better. "" I may have paraphrased a little.

facepalm,feh767e,t1_fegb4uo,1579110564.0,"For real.  Everything I was warned about as a kid is happening, yet because these ""signs"" don't mesh with their political views, there are just crickets.  Though, I suppose that was also one of the warnings too.  I'm actually an atheist now, but grew up very religious, and things in the last few years have really sent up my Revelations flags.  An entire continent is burning, fracking is causing earthquakes, once nearly irradicated diseases are making a comeback,  and evangelicals have been overwhelmingly fooled by charlatans (Trump, Olsteen, Meyers. . .)."

I've had to get onto family members for not stopping the tickles.  It's not funny or cute to forcibly tickle my kid until they pee their pants and then feel shamed.  Not ok.

AmItheAsshole,fe9m2tz,t3_eo7r9p,1578939350.0,"NTA - according to her own calculations, your lender money is supporting him, not her.  You are supporting a 30 year old man who should be doing that himself. Your daughter is also not the asshole, the boyfriend is.   The bigger issue beyond him not providing for himself, is that he sounds potentially abusive.  Threatening to leave if she doesn't ask her mom for money (to support HIM) or he will go running to his mommy is immature at best, emotionally abusive at worst.  I think a heart to heart with your daughter is in the near future.  She probably doesn't see the red flags in his behavior."
AmItheAsshole,fe9kuna,t1_fe9ja2c,1578938779.0,"It is absolutely a racket, and I can't judge anyone for looking for a cheaper alternative.  I made a full post on my judgement (NTA), but I'll repeat this advice: buy previous editions whenever possible.  They are nearly word for word with mostly cosmetic or minor typo changes, and they are drastically cheaper.  Amazon, eBay, and Half.com are the ones I mostly used to find my textbooks.  The only times this method hasn't worked is 1. if you need a key to some stupid online program, but sometimes you can find those separately, and 2. If it's a brand new textbook with no previous edition."
AmItheAsshole,fe9jlty,t3_eo70k3,1578938260.0,"NTA - It's 2020, and I'd be shocked if you are really the only one taking digital notes unless this is a math class.  Honestly, I'm impressed you can keep up that fast on a tablet.  I could on a laptop, but not a tablet, so good for you!   Scanning everything seems a bit overkill to me, but whatever works for you and your study habits, but since that isn't as common, I can see how not bringing passed out homework or papers could be seen as slacking in the eyes of a professor.  I'd hope graduate school professors would know their students are generally trustworthy, but I'd certainly side eye my high schoolers if they tried telling me they scanned their homework so it was more accessible.  Again though, if it works for you, more power to you!   High schools hardly have text books anymore and a large portion of the work is turned in online using Google Classroom or other online services.  Your professor is stuck in the past (and is missing out on some great teaching applications) if he wants everything on paper.

Regarding the text book.  Eh.   I see the legality issue, and it's valid.  But damn, textbooks are absurdly expensive for no good reason, so I also can't fault you for trying to find a cheaper alternative. New editions are pushed out for exorbitant rates when they only have minor spelling changes or a new forward/dedication.  If you want to get around the moral quandary of having an illegal version and want to rectify that issue with your professor, find a cheap previous edition and purchase a used copy of that and be sure to bring to class a few times or the next time you chat with him.  I rarely spent more than $10 for my previous edition textbooks and never had an issue with having the wrong version.  If it's a math class, you might just check that any homework/practice problems are the same (ask a classmate) since sometimes they will slightly change the problems."

There's not much wind down there, so even with lower temperatures, it'll feel pretty nice! There's a small museum, lots of trails of various difficulties, and some interesting history.  It's the second largest Canyon in the US and definitely worth a visit.  There's a cafe down there or you can bring a picnic.  They have horse rides, Jeep tours (I think?) and a zip line for the adventurous!"
amarillo,fdzxr8x,t3_enag1w,1578798382.0,"What else are you looking for in a home?  Do you want a large lot or property?  Large, small?  Newer, older?  Walking distance to stores, or out in the boonies?  Good schools, or don't care? Without knowing more, it's hard to say what the best fit would be.


There are a lot of pretty nice neighborhoods in your price range.  I'm sure there are some toward the northeast, I'm just not overly familiar with that area.  Most of the new growth is toward the southwest, so if you're looking for a new home, check that direction.  If you want an older neighborhood with mature trees and classic homes, Wolflin is nice and has a lot of variety.  Cityview is newish and has more budget friendly homes that come with smaller yards, but it's a great neighborhood for a starter home and there are a lot of younger families.  Across Western from City View (around Arden) is a great little neighborhood.  I'm not sure if it has a name.  Lots of mature trees and pretty nice houses without being way overpriced.  If you want more property, check south of town.  There are quite a few new developments down off Soncy and McCormick/Lair/Rockwell.  I'm not sure what the prices are, but probably at the high end or over your budget.  Mescalero Park is an older country neighborhood off Georgia and McCormick with a mix of older and newer homes that tend to be in your price range. You might also check out Canyon.  It's a short commute to Amarillo via I-27, but is a great little town!"

First things first: you are a serious badass, and sound like someone I'd love to know!  I also love backpacking and camping and always dreamed of making my own survival huts, but never really had the means.  I hope your parents appreciate what an awesome daughter they have!  If they don't, I do.  If my daughter chooses to make forts and sleep in the wilderness, I will be so damn proud of her! I also understand that the sleep you get in the wilderness is incredible.  I use a hammock when I camp, and coming back home to a bed freaking sucks!

Onto explanation/advice if you want it.  It sounds like dad and step mom are sleep deprived from an infant and are probably projecting or wishing you would help, but don't feel right asking their teenage daughter.  I'd be willing to bet some of it is from a place of guilt as well, particularly from your dad.  He's probably worried that you are spending the night elsewhere because you don't feel like you are part of their ""new"" family.  He likely has no idea on how to even bring this up to you, so instead is trying to assuage his own guilt by asking (in his own sadly inefficient way) for you to stay at the house to be a part of the family.  I could be way off base, but as someone who comes from a similarly complicated family (I have two half siblings; one on each side, and two step sisters on my dad's side), I'd reckon I'm probably on to something.  If you ARE feeling like that, you might want to say something.  As the adult, that SHOULD come from your dad, but we all know adults don't always make the best choices.  I'm almost 40 and still kind of resent that my dad more or less chose his step family and left me behind.  We still talk and have an ok relationship, but if I'd talked to him at 15 or 17 and told him how I felt, things may have turned out better.  Best of luck to you on your college applications."
