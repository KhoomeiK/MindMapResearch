It passes with time, and the next relationship will be amazing all over again. You're young, you have all the time in the world to fall in love."

We aren't our own person anymore who enjoys to read, write, play/sing music. We aren't allowed to do these or be anyone else but mothers. And wives. It took me a few years to find myself again, because that's the roll I took, and I drowned in being a mother. Fuck anyone who tells you what you should and shouldn't do because your a mother. Be you.

relationship_advice,fef58cq,t1_feeu6vf,1579048472.0,"I'm not sure, the relationship is so fresh, only you can judge that. She may feel attacked, or ashamed or embarrased. She may feel angry if she didn't know. Assure her that while it makes you uncomfortable for unknown reasons, you aren't bringing it up to shame her, blame her or attack her for it. Let her know you want her to feel comfortable to talk to you about it."
relationship_advice,feesb4n,t3_eos6qc,1579040147.0,"First off, it's totally okay to feel insecure and other feelings you might not understand. What won't be okay is if you approach her in an attacking way. If you do decide to approach her about it, do it as gently as you can. It may not even be her in the video, or she may not even know it was posted. Either way, talk about it as respectfully and calmly as possible, because who knows what directions it might head in, and emotions have a way of clouding our judgments and putting words in our mouths that may not come out right."
relationship_advice,feerivf,t3_eos85w,1579039670.0,"I hate getting on the ""leave him"" train, so before suggesting that, have you talked to him about how you feel? It seems he doesn't appreciate you, or care that you are in pain. Sounds like he is also down-playing your medical condition, which would understandably make you upset. If this is a relationship you want to keep long term, you two should really have a sit down discussion, or even consider therapy. If he isn't willing to hear you out, and truly understand why you are upset (about the lack of caring/planning for your birthday, and his lack of caring while you are in serious pain) then it shows how serious he takes the relationship. I wish you the best!"

I realize I do it, and I try every day to work on it. I started therapy late last year for an unrelated reason, but I have talked about going on antidepressants to better myself, especially better myself as a mother. My therapist told me she was proud of me acknowledging that I need a bit of help to do better. I'm a little over a month into my antidepressants and while they aren't making a difference at this moment. I may need to either up the dose or switch brands. Maybe try looking into it again, you may have better results this time around.

If you find his room smells gross, then put your big girl panties on and have a calm, mature and respectful discussion about proper hygiene when taking care of his ""needs"". He may have stopped masturbating at home, but that doesn't mean he's completely stopped doing it. By taking control of his phone when you think he's masturbating only tells him to be disgusted and ashamed, and that he can't even feel safe in his own house to do what naturally, all other boys his age do."
