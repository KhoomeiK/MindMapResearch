Limiting the effects of MOV doesn't mean ignoring MOV.  They simply capped it at a 10 point win.

This means a 25 point win is treated the same as a 35 point win.  Which I think makes perfect sense.  Once you're beating up on a team the stats don't really mean much for accurately judging the winning or losing team.

Gonzaga could get to all of the Big East schools over four months.  But they can't get to all of the Big East schools over two months. 

And I don't think the rest of the conference wants to play conference games in November and December.  And if only Gonzaga were having their games spread out, I think the other Big East teams would complain that it was an unfair advantage that they had to play Big East games back to back to back while Gonzaga is breaking up the games with home games against Idaho and Ark-Pine Bluff.

UConn joining the Big East also makes it less likely.  Gonzaga is a better academic fit but the Big East likes the double round robin and I can't see them going to 22 games."

CollegeBasketball,fffact0,t3_etbm0n,1579879576.0,"The size of the arena has been cited as a part of the reason why they have been able to sustain success.  It is the same reason VCU built a small arena (similar sized). 

Gonzaga has had up and down seasons over the years.  But by making it so hard to buy a ticket, people always want to go to a game.  So people will still go to the games when the team isn't as good or when the opponent isn't that big.

Think of what happens if they build a big arena.

Let's say they build a 15k arena.  You know what happens?  Attendance for Alabama State game will decline.

People who want to go to one or two games a year will simply go to the UNC game and the BYU game.  Those games will get 15k fans.

So now the attendance for big games is much higher but for minor games drops off.  This is when you end up with a lack of home court advantage and upsets can happen.  It is also when you can have a downward spiral if the team has a down season.  The fans will just hold out for a big game.

But if only 6,000 people can go to a game then people will go to minor games because it is their only chance to see the team play in person that season.  It sells out.

This ensures that they always have every seat filled.  And since you have to pay to build each seat and the school doesn't have a lot of money, you want to make sure each seat you pay to build will be used every game."

personalfinance,fek821g,t3_epm0sc,1579194551.0,">So based on amortization, when you get a loan, let's call it a $400,000 loan, when you make payments, you pay a large interest payment and a small mortgage principal payment. Even 60/40 or 80/20 for intrest to principal ration. If you refi the loan in say, 5 years, then you’re effectively paying the bank some really high-interest rate, call it even 50% right? **You only ever get down to the 4% that your lender quoted you if you hold onto the loan for all 30 years.** 

You don't understand how interest is calculated.

You pay interest on the money you're using from the bank.  As long as you owe money to the bank, you will be charged interest on that amount.

So if you have a 4% interest rate, you will pay 0.333% every month.  The monthly interest rate is 4% divided by 12 months.

Lets say you buy a $400k home at 20% down.  So the first month of the loan you have an outstanding balance of $320,000.  For using that $320,000, you are charged $1,066.65 in interest.  Interest is the charge for using the banks money for that month.  

The interest is paid first.  Then whatever other money is paid, is applied to reduce the principle on the loan.

So early on in the loan repayment schedule, you are using more of the bank's money so you're charged more in interest.

But let's say after 15 years you only owe $100,000 to the bank.  Now you will be charged $333.33 in interest that month with the rest of your payment going to reduce the principle balance owed to the bank.

Let me know if you need more clarification.

Now, about HELOC, they are traditionally higher interest loans and they also have a call option on them.  The call option allows the bank at any point to require you to pay back the whole loan at once.

There is no benefit to paying a mortgage with a HELOC."

-  **Semester system:** More in-depth study into the courses you take as you spend more time on each course you take.  A more broad scope for the courses which can lead students into ancillary areas to the focus of the course.
