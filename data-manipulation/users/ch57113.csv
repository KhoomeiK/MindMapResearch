Because the floors only need to be cleaned at the end of the night unless there is visible trash right? Next time I'll mash the goldfish into carpet so the mess is less noticable. Cause the place was super clean before we showed up right? Restaurants are super clean right?  This isn't your house. It isn't an art gallery. It's a shit hole restaurant where the servers work on tips. If the family leaves a shitty tip, they suck. If they leave a big tip, shut your mouth and clean it up.  Sorry kids are messy.

You're an idiot. If the parents left a fat tip, or if they didn't, you wouldn't know. Cause it's none of your fucking business is it. You just saw some shit you didn't like and called it trashy without having any perspective or frame of reference.   I guess parents shouldn't leave the house unless they pay some irresponsible teenager to watch over their child right?  Change my diaper you simple basic bitch."
trashy,ffh8iiy,t1_ffgpxzt,1579926153.0,Kids throw stuff. They make messes. No one cleans up their own table kid or not. Did they leave no tip? Otherwise fuck off. This isn't trashy. It's life for a couple with kids. Do you think customers are going to get on the floor and pick up debris with their hands?  Really?  Unless they left a 10% tip or less fuck off. Guarantee they deal with the same shit at home but what are you going to do? Fucking toddlers. They suck.

Coat a piece of bread in egg

Cook for about 30 seconds on each side, don't forget the thin sides!

Have wayyy more material than you think you'll need. You may just not be in mood to play a few, play a few too fast, play a shorter section, or whatever. You can burn through a lot of songs in a short time when you're by yourself. Don't wanna be scrambling to fill time with bullshit.

jazzguitar,fetottg,t1_fesoq9q,1579377761.0,"Other instruments, no. Dubbed in walking bass lines withy guitar, abso-fuckin-lutely. 

Getting my loops in order was like learning a whole new way to play. You have to comp out in way that won't fuck you up trying to solo over, know when a triad is just a better approach (less is more), and apply basslines for a much fuller feel. Once I figured out what was worthy to present to others, it took hours and hours to get the loops set up.  Best advice if you choose to use one; make sure you are in perfect time when you record them. Sounds stupid but sometimes I just have my guitar tuned to itself cause I'm just diddling at work. I lost about an hour of loop setup when it occurred to me I didn't time up. Second tip; document what youre doing as your going. Make sure you know write your loop set so you don't have to later try and figure out what changes you were recording.

jazzguitar,fetnptd,t1_fetk4oj,1579377310.0,"No problem man. I practice everyday because I just enjoy playing. The threshold to toe the line on is when you're obligated to play for a specified amount of time. I like the gig because it's right next to my house at an establishment I frequent anyway. The pay is nice and they feed me and give me drinks so I'll give them one Saturday a month. Sometimes I do a Sunday brunch gig which is really cushy. 

I left off a couple tips.

Don't over exert yourself. You may be expected to play 2 hours with a break, but if you're not hitting it hard everyday, that will really test your endurance. Find a good blend of melodic, interesting, and relaxed runs to use to save your fingers. Towards the end of the gig I'm almost always struggling for strength in my playing. 

This might just be me, but if I have more than 2 drinks I deteriorate significantly as a player. I lose syncopation in my hands and struggle heavily. Unless you've played jazz with a buzz in the past and confident you can still hang, save your drinks for after you're done."

I use a loop pedal, programmed about 15 compositions. I keep the tunes mid tempo and boppy; wave, moose the mooch, there is no greater love, all of me are a few I use loops on. Gypsy stuff works well too.

Pure solo stuff I worked out chord melodys with room to improvise over tunes like Misty, night and day, lullaby of birdland, days of wine and roses, nice work if you can get it, some original arrangements. There's others but you get the point. 

It's almost just a paid practice session since I'm just background, but people do listen and will take notice of you're good. Don't fuck about too much and don't noodle around. Be professional and don't take requests."
