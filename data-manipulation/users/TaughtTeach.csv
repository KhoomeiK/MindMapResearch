productivity,fdwg1or,t3_emeiqg,1578758286.0,"We must organise our plans and prioritise our tasks. 

The ‘Eisenhower Matrix’ developed by former ‘U.S President’ Dwight Eisenhower; helps plan and plot tasks into an order of priority by importance and urgency.

Start by plotting down tasks into 4 separately ranked categories:

&#x200B;

1.High importance/High urgency = High priority tasks that require your attention and must be dealt with immediately using all the assistance you have.

2.High importance/Low urgency = Medium priority tasks that require your attention but not immediately. 

3.Low importance/High urgency = Medium priority tasks that do not require much attention but needs to be done immediately and can be delegated to others.

4.Low importance/Low urgency = Low priority tasks that do not require your immediate attention and can be delayed or discarded.

Be mindful of the planning stage. If we do too little, we will inevitably face obstacles that we had not prepared for, which may push us off track.

Conversely, spending too much time planning and waiting for the perfect time to take action is a form of procrastination.

Any thoughts on this?"
