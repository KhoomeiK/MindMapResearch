MazdaCX9,ffst4ep,t3_eur73l,1580191486.0,I picked up a 2019 GT back in October. I’m beyond happy with it. Mazda is going after the luxury market and reliability has been key in the last few years. You have zero to worry about.
whatcarshouldIbuy,ffsssu4,t3_euwpop,1580191155.0,"I test drove both. Picked the CX-9, but the GT. It had a better ride, quieter, more responsive. I loved the tech. The infotainment knob is a game changer for me. It’s just fun to drive."

The child of one of your technicians was running around and grabbing customer’s belongings. Let’s ask those officers if that’s against code. I assume you have lots of chemicals that an unsupervised child could get in to. That minor is the responsibility of your employee. I would very much like to have the authorities involved.”"

You clearly didn’t read the entire article. 

Rather than take my point for what it is, you would rather try and educate me through insults.

Apparently I, and I assume a slew of others, will gloss over this because “incendiary device” means nothing to us. Sure, we could all look it up, but truthfully, most of us won’t. 

And the article stated clearly that this was not a grenade, but a device the man made himself. And the article itself eloquently stated that it blew up (or exploded). I’m sorry this exchange seems to have upset you so much."
news,fdgxqe4,t1_fdgwimj,1578410908.0,"My point is that the news tends to water things down so that the impact is lessened sometimes. Like PTSD. In World War I, it was called Shell Shock. Then it became Battle Fatigue in World War II. Now it’s Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. We tend to disassociate acts from human emotion now. Incendiary device sounds electronic, detached. And sure, it may be the true, technical term. 

Also, the article stated: the man lit the device, threw it and it exploded, although quickly extinguished itself. By the description of that, it was an explosive device he made at home."
