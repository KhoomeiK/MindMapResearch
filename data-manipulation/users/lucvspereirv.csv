Yeah, I think coming back to therapy is the best option. My former therapist wasn't helping a 100%.


About talking with my mother, I feel like I'm going to disappoint her, as you said, or get her preoccupied or sad.


My friendship circles is dying as the day goes by. They don't put effort to be together or to do something cool. It's like I'm the only one trying to reunite us and this is killing me.


I tried Tinder a few times, but it only made me feel worse and incapable. It's very hard for me to know new people or new friends. I'm a very shy person. I feel like everybody else is judging me or mocking me behind my back. I can't trust no longer."
