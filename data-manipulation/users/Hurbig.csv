1) Don’t disrespect. If something has high cultural significance to them then you should treat it the same way. Inform yourself on their customs. 

2) Don’t exploit. Don’t make profit of their culture while they don’t get to see a cent of it.

Almost all interactions I had when visiting countries were people excited to show me their culture. When you show interest in the food, language, clothing, religion etc. people usually are happy to share.

minimalism,fflgamw,t3_eu5jux,1580039325.0,"If it becomes obsessive then you might have a problem. Many people see that something helps them in life and take it to the extreme because they think once they have achieved this extreme, they will be happy.
Often they end up unhappy because they can’t perfect their obsession. No matter what they do, they haven’t done enough. 

Just seriously consider how this goal benefits or harms you or your loved ones. Getting rid of a lot of stuff may give you a boost of feel-good hormones, but you may regret it long term.

That being said, I know of people who have taken the minimalist lifestyle to an extreme and are very happy about it.

This is what I do when unsure if I should keep something: I put it in a bag, store it away and if I haven’t missed it once in a year it should go. For example with a kitchen utensil you will come to realize whether you actually use it in your daily life and if it thus has value to you and improves your life. I have noticed that I do want two sauce pans because I do want to use them at the same time from time to time and it would annoy me not to have them. Others wouldn’t mind having one or none at all. It is an individual thing.

Your quality of life may not decrease by getting rid of a big bed and sleeping on the floor on a futon, but it may not increase either, because a bed in your room will not clutter your room. If you just get rid of it so you can fit everything into a bag then it’s probably the wrong motivation. If you don’t own a bed and you don’t want to get one, that’s a different story.

Also, if you go to the extreme too fast you might end up rebuying a lot of stuff. I recommend making it a process and not throwing away 300,000 items at once.

Even if you don’t throw anything away anymore, that doesn’t mean you have to buy new stuff.

But I am no psychologist and no hard core minimalist. These are just my personal views of things."

KingkillerChronicle,ffkz8er,t3_etvrz9,1580031848.0,"Ok, that’s a long list, but most of it isn’t that dangerous or wrong to tell. 

1, 7 and 10 are all things he’s not allowed to talk about because he would get in trouble for it, be it because of the iron law, the university rules or his contract with the Maer. But the consequences of talking about those things are irrelevant to him as he has already had to go undercover and there is a bounty on his head anyway. He get angry at Chronicler for endangering him, maybe partly because he does still care about his safety (though we know he’s suicidal, I think he just wants to make sure that chest is opened somehow) and maybe partly because even if he doesn’t care about himself, he gets angry because Chronicler is selfish. 
Anyway, Chronicler finding him endangers him because he might be found. But telling incriminating facts about himself wouldn’t make him more likely to be found and if he’s found, he’s going to be killed anyway.

3. He was explicitly allowed by Shehyn to talk about his time with the Adem, he just isn’t allowed to teach any of it. But talking about the Ketan is not teaching the Ketan.

4. If the Chandrian are still out there then it would probably be beneficial to him if suddenly their names are known and spread, as they wouldn’t be able to track down the people finding out about them anymore, since there are so many speaking their names. But that’s just my theory.

5, 6 and 8 are probably not that critical either, because the iron law and the university will not be able to prosecute anyone because they know a guy who knows a guy who said something bad about them. Sleat and Devi are not able to operate because the authorities are unaware of them, but because they can’t find any incriminating evidence. 

9. Cthaehs words. I don’t see how that is a problem. The way I understand it, the Cthaeh doesn’t choose words that are dangerous if they get around, it chooses words that are dangerous if the person in front of it hears them. Whatever the Cthaeh said it made Kvothe do something that brought great misery to the world. The Cthaeh knew Kvothe would tell those words, but of course it also would know what words would be most dangerous if Kvothe didn’t spread them. Maybe it even knew what to say so that Kvothe would spread them.

Which leaves us with 2. Maybe it is a mistake on Kvothe parts to talk about it, maybe it is Rothfuss forgetting that that would be something Kvothe leaves out, maybe he is lying or maybe Auri is dead when Kvothe tells the story so it doesn’t matter anymore.


That’s just how I feel about things. Generally it is difficult to write a story where the main character tell his story to other people in his life. Some things just don’t seem to be natural when doing so. I don’t think people would talk about their sex life that much for example. I don’t think people would use direct speech that much. Kvothe might have a good memory, but there is no way he remembers everything people said to him word for word through all those years. So he’s filling in details and making stuff up. Writing a story this way is hard to do both believable and enjoyable so we just have to suspend our disbelieve a bit sometimes."

AskFeminists,fdq972g,t3_emg955,1578659922.0,"I am not getting tired of strong women, I’m getting tired of strong women done badly. Whenever there is a strong female lead there seems to be a need from the writers to clarify why the lead is a woman and not a man. As if there was need for a reason. And often the strong female character is already bitter because she has some sort of personal crusade against men. Don’t get me started on reboots where the gender roles are reversed, I don’t want women constantly portrayed in a “See! She can do it too! DESPITE being a woman! She is incredible! Just as good as men!”

It think that’s why I enjoy strong female characters more in kids shows, because there people don’t feel the constant need for some sort of social commentary, since children wouldn’t get that anyway. Carmen San Diego and Kim Possible are some great examples. 

That being said, I understand that it’s not easy to write strong female characters, as there are not a lot of good examples to follow. Even women, who know what it’s like to be a woman, seem to have trouble realistically portraying women. 

Also, sadly, the majority of media portraying women as shallow is to some extend a self fulfilling prophecy, as there are many girls who grow up thinking that this is what they’re supposed to be, which makes breaking out of this circle even harder. (Not saying the majority of women are like that at all, but it does have an effect.)

And what you say is very true, people who try to portray women realistically seem to be afraid to give them flaws as they think it would shed a negative light on women. 

However, I am confident that we’ll get there eventually. A lot of this stuff is trial and error, since a new age of more strong female leads is beginning and we writers are just figuring that stuff out."

One thing I had to realize on my weight loss journey is that it takes small steps for some people. I started my journey by getting a calorie counting app and setting a daily 800 calorie deficit as my goal. I didn't even manage one week. So I went down to a 400 calorie deficit, which I managed for two months, but counting calories was getting exhausting. 

So I thought I could just keep my current lifestyle but not count the calories anymore and -surprise- I started gaining weight again. I was so frustrated. Counting calories took so much out of my time and made me so anxious about eating, but without it I just couldn't stay on track. So I had to reevaluate and set my goal to maintain first, just through lifestyle changes, not through counting. 

Throughout the day I made small good decisions, not because I felt like I had to, but because I knew I could. Just by portioning my snacks and not eating straight out of the packet I reduced my intake significantly. Whenever I cooked I just asked myself while eating if I really needed a second helping or if I was already full and just wanted more because I liked it. That way I could put leftovers away for later and have another healthy meal without even cooking! With certain things I realized they're just not worth the calories, I just ate them because that's what I always did. I don't even like yogurt that much and most of them have a ton of sugar in them. I could eat pancakes without butter, I didn't miss it. when cooking I could use way less oil and it would still be tasty. After looking up once how much calories fast food has, I have over time reduced the amount of fast food I eat, plus whenever I get fast food, I order small portions and drink soda instead of water.

These are just personal preferences and it's all things I changed slowly over time. For two months now (after 6 months of maintaining) I have been losing weight veeeeryyyy slowly. But it's ok because I know in the future I can make more small changes that will eventually add up to a completely different eating lifestyle. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that for some people it is best to wake up one day and do a complete 180, but others (like me and probably you) just need time and shouldn't expect to change overnight, but allow themselves to make bad decisions as long as there is progress. As long as you are not in intimidate danger due to poor health, you can take your time losing weight. Maybe you could start by preparing one home cooked lunch per week or reducing your soda intake. Then, once you feel up to it, you can raise the bar.

I always empathize that feminism is not just about women. Men face a lot of challenges too as a result of gender inequality. Overall I think women may be at a disadvantage, but it doesn't even matter. As long as people suffer from gender inequality, whether men or women, we should try to fix it. I think it's important that when we talk about other people's struggles, we don't pretend to know what it feels like. I also think that a lot of men ""wrongly"" consider themselves feminists because the have accepted that women can be gamer too or that women can be smart and then they think of themselves as progressive even though they might have some quite misogynistic views.

You cannot gatekeep feminism though. Feminists don't agree what feminism is and that's ok. I have been told I'm not a feminist, because I wouldn't use the term ""oppressed"" to describe myself. I think women who are ""anti-men"" aren't real feminists, because feminism should be about gender equality. At the end of the day, whether somebody considers themselves a feminist or not does not define their political views, it is just a nice term people like to use. IRL I hardly ever say ""I'm a feminist"" because that doesn't contribute to anything. I just make my views on gender equality clear whenever the topic comes up. 

I would go as far as saying that male feminists not just could, but should tell female feminists if they're wrong regarding something. Because at the end of the day we cannot have gender equality if the scales tip and men aren't allowed to speak up anymore."

And sadly it is true that historically a lot of women were locked up in their homes and there aren’t a lot of influential female mafia figures. I think the Bechdel test is something a movie maker should take into consideration, but it is not a must in every movie. 

Even though I am a feminist the only novel I wrote does not pass the Bechdel test. The main character is a teenage boy with depression and although he has three influential female figures in his life, they never crossed paths. I tried to “fix” it, but it just always felt forced, so the nearest I got to passing is a woman ordering tea from another woman. Everything else would have felt forced to me, as there is no way of these three women to organically meet each other. I have barely any scenes where more than two people talk at all and one of them is always the main character.

In LotR you could have shown the scene where Eowyn talks to the girl that arrived to tell them they were being attacked and it would have passed the test, but instead they decided to skip that scene and rather show Eowyn talk to Aragorn about what the girl said. Really unnecessary if you ask me. Does that mean I hate LotR? No, I love the books and the movies. But I wish the next Tolkien / Peter Jackson would take into consideration that women can have conversations too.


Anyway, I guess what I’m trying to say is that an individual work of art not passing the Bechdel test is not the end of the world, but it is the overwhelming sum of movies and books that don’t pass the bechdel test that is disturbing. In a lot of works it would not have been hard either. 
I don’t think we should give good movies bad ratings because of it though, that’ll make people upset and not make anyone change their minds. My hope is that we can make people conscious of this issue without being accusatory.

bisexual,fd47kam,t3_ejk4oh,1578165081.0,"I would totally date a trans woman or man and I am not opposed to date an NB person either, I have just never got to know one yet. Even if somebody did not feel comfortable dating trans people that should be ok, as long as they are not hateful of against trans rights IMO. 

I consider myself bisexual and not pansexual because non-LGBT people (at least where I live) don’t know what pansexual is. I don’t think it necessary to distinguish myself from people who are attracted to just two genders."
loseit,fd0yx5s,t1_fcymq9g,1578125661.0,"I'm not a recovering alcoholic, but since I have ADHD, which makes me much more likely to become an addict, and used to have depression I chose to not start drinking at all. It is hard. I feel like I always have to explain myself and make sure that EVERYONE understands that I don't judge them for drinking. I am tired of constantly handing back wine and champagne glasses and of asking if they have alcohol free beer and getting an eye roll as a response. (Not that I think they should have it, but if they do by some chance, which is sometimes the case, I want one.) People don't seem to want to understand why I don't want to drink."
ADHD,fcxjyqc,t3_ejfvr6,1578064784.0,"Of course you can treat ADHD without medication. I am a firm believer that ADHD itself isn’t even that bad, it just makes it very hard to live in a world that was built for non ADHD people. I was never unhappy because I had ADHD, I was unhappy because it prevented me from having normal friendships because other kids thought I was weird, I was unhappy because I struggled with my education because I was just magically expected to be able to “do the thing.” Just like it doesn’t make me unhappy that I’m unable to fly, but it would make me unhappy if everyone was able to fly but me.

ADHD medication has sometimes given me depression like symptoms and I don’t like to depend on medication to be able to do what I want. I still take it though, because I don’t think I could do without at the moment. I am working on meditation and mindfulness and so on and it helps.

Whether you want to take it or not is a personal decision. You should not avoid it because your family pressures you to, but if you don’t want it, you can go without. As far as side effects, I’d recommend you talk about that with a professional. People like to pretend it doesn’t have any side effects at all for anyone, which is just not true. But it is not generally bad to take meds either."
AskFeminists,fcx9nim,t3_ej6bd7,1578056566.0,"If you'd be fine if you didn't have to watch these movies then it's none of your boyfriend's business to make you watch them. Surely he doesn't want to watch all movies either, what you watch should be your choice. 

I can understand that he would be bothered by your preference if he had to hear you rant all the time, even if you are right of course. I think the term eye candy describes it pretty well. Even if a woman can do more than just look pretty, they have to at least be pretty to get a lead role. As a bisexual woman I do like to look at pretty women, but as a feminist it annoys me that we women are expected to look good for other people's enjoyment. 

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that you might have different views on how important this is and that should be ok. You cannot always agree in a relationship. As long as he can live with you not watching those movies and you can live with him watching those movies it should not be a problem. Maybe it would be easier for him to accept that you don't want to watch a movie if you don't tell him the reason, as he clearly doesn't understand it. Saying you're not interested should be reason enough."
SkincareAddicts,fcvcvm2,t3_ej1uo1,1577999447.0,"I didn’t get a lot of acne till 17, which was when I was put on the pill I am currently on. I know the pill helps a lot of people with acne, but I checked the side effects and it does list acne and it started at the same time as I started this pill. 

My quality of life has improved much on it though, since my endometriosis symptoms were treated with it.

I am now at age 19 only starting to really develop a skincare routine as I never had one before, since my skin has never bothered me. It was only half a year ago that I realized this weird breakout will not go away. 

Since I am a stress eater and usually don’t eat clean when I’m stressed either my acne is worse since starting university. Also, I constantly have my face resting in my hands while studying, which is not helpful either."
knitting,fcu2cpc,t3_eirllt,1577970323.0,"It’s nice that you don’t get discouraged over this. I see so many people who start knitting and they make a few mistakes and give up.

This is just from personal experience, but my recommendation to you would be to try and knit a scarf, that’s not too broad. It is a simple first project that doesn’t require a lot of “concentration” or complicated patterns and will get you a lot of practice on the stitch. In the end you can compare the beginning of your scarf to the end of your scarf and you will feel so accomplished."
DidntKnowIWantedThat,fcqcv1k,t3_eiai5e,1577883484.0,Am I the only one who thinks that toddlers should actually learn that they can spill things? Just imagine you grew up thinking that nothing ever spills and then one day your parents hand you a real bowl and you don't know how to hold it.

konmari,fcjm4fa,t3_eh04jh,1577693379.0,"I think I’ve always known I have a problem and just made up excuses why I couldn’t take care of it. In my head people either could do it, in which case they have already done it, or they couldn’t do it it, in which case they never will. The guilt and stress has always been there.

One of my biggest problems when cleaning out the house is that I have recently started to try and reduce my waste. I tried to donate and recycle as much as I could, but at the end of the day there was just so much stuff I had to throw away and the guilt was overwhelming. I had to convince myself that these things would eventually go to the trash even if I kept them another 20 years and that I should throw them away now so that these 20 years will be a happier time for me. The most important thing is to not buy any more trash. For that r/minimalism is a great inspiration.

My greatest strategy for not getting a lot of new stuff is to have “constant” furniture. I have one closet for clothes, one cupboard for general stuff, one shelf for books, one drawer cabinet for paper work and one big box for video games and movies. I don’t allow myself to get more storage so whatever I want to own has to fit in there, even if my room could fit more. 
I still have some boxes in the attic, but those only get smaller as time goes on, nothing is allowed to go up there anymore.

In the end it is a mistake (or many small mistakes) that I made in the past and through cleaning up I can finally leave the past behind me."
