starbucks,ffu7tgc,t3_ev62y8,1580236306.0,"sometimes i just look at yelp for all the coffee shops i go to, and there was one for the starbucks up the street from me. it was two stars because ApPaReNtLy there was a barista that was leaving as the person was ordering, and the person spilled the drink as they were exiting the store, and the barista “didn’t even offer to mop it up”. they were ranting about the unprofessionalism and how the barista should have put the customers needs before their own..... but the barista was obvs off the clock. like did the reviewer think that a barista should act like they’re working everywhere they go?"
