depression,fgbpkbb,t1_fgbnhz4,1580664813.0,Do you think they will judge me especially about the drug use? Is that something I should not mention or is it better to be honest?
offmychest,ffuh9b5,t3_ev9lam,1580241914.0,We need more understanding people like you at school!
MDMA,ffniqi7,t1_ffjzlcj,1580066435.0,This!!
MDMA,ffmji08,t1_ffknhw2,1580055543.0,We would probably never leave the hotel honestly... But we've never tried this. Only thinking it won't work as my husband and I become very cuddly and could end up conversating for hours and losing track of time doing other things together.
MDMA,ffjq8vd,t1_ffjpjog,1580004192.0,Thanks and that actually sounds like a good idea. The first few concerts where we lasted the whole night there was because we were both making friends with other people in the crowd.
MDMA,ffjq2da,t1_ffjpcgb,1580004069.0,Thanks for suggesting but it's not our thing
MDMA,fffav2i,t1_ffec1kv,1579879896.0,Thanks this is the best!

MDMA,ffe5ktz,t1_ffe3q4c,1579837288.0,"Thanks for actually answering my question instead of saying not to do so. I could just say pass on drinks right, so hopefully no one will press me on why!!"
jobs,ff0we2l,t1_ff0nang,1579472903.0,Thank you so much for your detailed answer! I'm definitely going to use this to better prepare myself for my next interview. I typically do well in interviews but haven't left a job in my current circumstance so it's a new challenge for me.

jobs,fesudgf,t1_fesnlnr,1579369084.0,We get 3 days of PTO and they renew a year after the date used. I used my first one around August so I wont have any until this coming August.
jobs,fese24i,t1_fesc29w,1579364231.0,Yes I was thinking of going part time at my current job so I can find time to look for a new one since I cant take a day off for interviews and such. Thanks for your response!
jobs,fescmuf,t1_fesbk7d,1579363881.0,"""From your post it sounds like you’ve used up all your vacation time on fun stuff and now just want them to not pay you while you go to the beach for a week.""

Which I don't find a terrible thing to do lol especially when you request time ahead for it. My concern is that I basically can't ask for a day off for another 6 months and as I said I have family and friendly commitments coming up so that will be tough. Sounds like I'm just going to have to find a new job soon."
depression,fe9d5l6,t1_fe9adku,1578936490.0,Thank you for your support as well. I really appreciate the kind words. And I am very fortunate that I am able to communicate my problems to husband very openly. It can just feel very hard to overcome the lack of motivation in this society where we must strive to work 40+ hours a week to survive. I am currently feeling like I don't belong in this kind of society... But I'm not wanting to give up completely on life.
depression,fe8ux1s,t3_enrs4c,1578931161.0,I understand how you feel. This is exactly why I prefer not speaking to a therapist. I feel like I have to justify everything I say when I don't have to.
Advice,fdpw9xw,t1_fdpvvwq,1578643139.0,The problem is to not to win her approval. The problem is that myself and the other people are a team. She sent out an email to everyone in the office to welcome everyone on the team. I was not included in that welcome and that's why I feel left out. I hope that makes more sense to you.
Advice,fdpvpme,t1_fdputmv,1578642453.0,I wish it was that easy. I guess I wouldn't be here if I didn't care
