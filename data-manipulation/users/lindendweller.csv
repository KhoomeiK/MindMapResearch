That's because they have been taught that racism is bad (or at least that you have to pretend that it is) but never examined what the underlying system or logic behind it is.
Similarly, some people will claim not to subscribe to american exceptionalism (or other brands of nationalism, let's not let my European ass off the hook here) but never look inwards for implicit exceptionalism, or for institutions of exceptionalism."

I mean if the best de can hope for is nordic style social democracy,  so be it,

as for the success of capitalism in america , I'm going to point to the looming climate catastrophe,  decades of wars for petrol and other resources,  and record high inequalty and prison population to say : human nature cannot be trusted To handle the means to accumulate wealth and power,  because upward mobility is a cute way of talking about stepping on other people's necks."
todayilearned,feh60mk,t1_feh3ma1,1579109871.0,"the fact that large scale attempts at socialism failed does not take away from the merits of the communist and anarchist critiques of capitalism,  and even less of how comprehensively they tie gender,  race, sexual preferences etc... into their critique. 
now criticisms of socialism based on ""human nature"" are moot because human nature is incredibly malleable.  the same people that killed 6 million jews are the ones keeping remembrance. and the ones victimised are now the oppressors in a new country.

failure of attempts at socialism should be used to bulletproof the next attempt, but to shit down the Idea entirely.

if you are so doubtful about human nature,  shouldnt you want power to be evenly distributed, so that people have very little power to abuse ?"

I watched the movie yesterday and I have to say it's a huge mixed bag for me.  
I really like the visuals, star wars had never been this epic in scale, but the story is too rushed for any scene to properly land. It clearly pays the price of being part of a trilogy that was rushed into production (to make back the 4.5 billion investment) before a clear idea of where they were going was chosen.
