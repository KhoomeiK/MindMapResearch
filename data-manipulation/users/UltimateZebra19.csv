I dont give a fuck about internet points, but I do about sounding like a dumbass or pissing people off.

Its my rule because 90% of others dont have a rule.

By the way, what are *You*, telling others how to behave on the internet?

Asking questions is different than talking about something. For instance, the lady above said that the vendor was actually the dick, but that is not the case. Rather, he did not know that there were other vendors. This made his point invalid. Instead, he could have asked ""Are there any other vendors that do not do this? This would get really tiring after a while."" I would have said something along the lines of ""yes, there are normal ice cream vendors"" and that would be that. However, due to him not knowing about the other vendors, he got downvoted to hell by other redditors."

TheMonkeysPaw,ff6wput,t3_erzaw1,1579636452.0,"Granted. In order to do so, it costs billions of dollars to replace all signs on earth, and years of work. Roadwork becomes commonplace, and as such traffic halts to a stop in many regions.

Languages that do not have lowercase letters begin to lose road function. Examples include Mandarin, Arabic, and Japanese. Road and highway systems shut down in many nations, without the ability to make signs. Supply and tradelines are practically destroyed, anarchy ensues in many regions of these nations. Billions are in chaos.

However, in the mations where lowercase is used, many signs are no longer large and easy to see, or do not get people's attention as much. Without lostening to warnings or not seeing signs, driving becomes much more dangerous, and thousands more die.

TheMonkeysPaw,ff61699,t3_eruqs7,1579616487.0,"Granted. You travel back in time to kill the first flea with the mutated bacteria. As such, millions of lives are saved and the populations of Europe and colonial regions surge. Overpopulation and global warming is a huge issue in todays world, pushing us towards extinction.

 However, you also get unknowingly infected by it. You proceed to travel back home completely unaware, and spread the original infection to hundreds, then thousands, then millions. The almost completely foreign yersinia pestis blazes through our fragile, vulnerable systems, without any resistance. This, combined with the warm climate and dense populations, result in a massive death toll. By the time doctors figure out what it is and administer antibiotics, billions die. Remaining scientists are astounded by the speed at which the plague killed its people, killing so fast that the signature black pustules never even pop up before subject death. As such, it is named ""The lightning plague"".

Congratulations, you just sent humans back thousands of years."

trashy,ff2dj6l,t1_ff2avcr,1579501763.0,"Not necessarily. Many do not try and push their agendas on other people, which is what i consider most trashy in any situation. Sometimes they are there to fill a hole in people's lives. Other times many people follow a religion for the moral compass, and are agnostic. My aunt and uncle are very Christian and I am atheist. They have never ONCE tried to force their religion on me.

As for religions that tend to reap benefits from followers, I would say that is trashy, a lot like the Catholic church in the 1500s. Since then they have gotten way better. That is just one example, others might be smaller cult-esque religions that ask for donations and such which are trashy.

But these few, exploitative religions do not speak for them all. What has the Shinto religion of ancient Japan ever done to you? Are your Lutheran neighbors slightly crazy? Taking one example and generalizing might make YOU a bit trashy.

In this case, something like this is quite common for Jehovah's Witnesses, which is why I consider them quite trashy."
