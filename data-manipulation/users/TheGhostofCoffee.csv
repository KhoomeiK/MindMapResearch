Edit:  I think Mike and Rich undersold Picard and Data's relationship.  Data was ride or die with Picard.  Picard even went to court to get him some rights.  Data loved serving under Picard...everyone did.  Every time Data fucked up, either something happened to him where it wasn't really him, or he simply didn't understand why it was wrong.

Data was far and away the MVP of TNG.  He even talked Picard into lightweight breaking the Prime directive ( using a technicality as an excuse) to save the planet the little orange girl lived on, because Data made him see it was the right thing to do.

I guess they gotta be funny, but most of those clips they showed of Data being a jerk,  Data wasn't in control or was malfunctioning.  They need to up their standards if they gonna try to talk down on new Trek.  There is plenty of stuff to critique without bringing yourself down."
