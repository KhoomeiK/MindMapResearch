recruitinghell,fgyl3cz,t1_fgyiuzf,1581184376.0,"> It is simply not the case that all good work happens at companies with difficult hiring practices   
  
Yea they could just get lucky that the person they didn't screen very well is a good hire. The whole point is to remove the gambling aspect though.  
  
> an objectively qualified applicant gets turned down for hundreds of jobs? CS degree, experience, the whole 9?  

There is no 'objectively qualified' in this field. There are tons of people with CS degrees who are terrible workers. 'Work experience' on your resume could be anything. It might be very good work experience, it might be like I said, tweaking css on wordpress sites and calling yourself an experienced full stack developer afterwards. These companies won't know that just from the resume screen which is why all the technical interviews are necessary. You'd be amazed at the people with CS degrees that fail fizz-buzz tests.

> I'm sure you'll tell me it's my fault somehow, but I did everything I could have reasonably done to get hired in a timely manner

It's absolutely not your fault. A bad hire can cost a company a lot of money. They are absolutely fine with having a process that turns away some good candidates as long as they can have a better chance of not hiring a bad one. The system sucks on both sides which was the point of my original post. Even when a company reaaaaallly needs more hires, and there are candidates who have great resumes and can ace the interviews, it can still take time. Which sucks for the people who need jobs and are burning through any savings, as well as the company who has an empty position they need filled."
recruitinghell,fgyj262,t1_fgwqq5e,1581183858.0,"Small companies can definitely be faster, I wasn't saying all jobs are going to take 3 months to get in. But it varies wildly. Most places have a minimum of resume screen -> phone interview / online code challenge -> onsite -> offer sent -> paperwork -> start working and get paid in 2 weeks to a month., The time between those can vary wildly if it's not a tiny company with basically one person making the decisions. That would still be 1 all day interview but just that can end up taking a while depending on how many applicants they are dealing with and how many people they want involved in the process."
recruitinghell,fgyhe3l,t1_fgv6xme,1581183385.0,"There are tons of other companies who aren't as picky also hiring. Like was said, the damage a bad hire can do makes it worthwhile for larger companies to be picky even when growth is demanding more hires. My company also gives like 3/4 of a months salary as a referral bonus if we can refer them to a good hire. There are tons of bad applicants out there, just because the demand is huge doesn't mean they are going to let unqualified people in. And most of those applicants have 'work experience' which means there are shitty companies with lax hiring processes that will still hire the bad people, which wouldn't happen if there wasn't so much demand. 

Programming jobs are notoriously harder to hire based on resumes because there is so much bullshit and titles are meaningless. I've seen 'software engineer' jobs who literally just tweaked css all day in wordpress sites. So yea you can absolutely turn down 100 applicants and still say there is a shortage because those 100 applicants were not qualified for the work. My company also gives classes and workshops to the community and has hired junior level that showed promise from there. The demand is very real."

When it seems that all games are going p2w it becomes frustrating for those of us who do not like playing that way. It is also odd from my point of view people who pay for power.

The way the show did it felt like they wanted to turn the series into a romance novel with a fantasy background. Also the sets felt way too clean and way too gray. I still enjoyed it a lot. I think the chemistry between Geralt and Jasker saved a lot of the slower parts."

As to why he did this? Pure memes. There's no real reason to do this and it is super expensive. Posting on reddit IS the end goal. There are valid reasons to chance influenced bases because there are some items that give you extra benefits for wearing shaped gear, but that is not what is happening here."

\> Almost invariably when you see someone say ""the media isn't talking about this""

You are taking people on extremes and using them as a reason to shut down everyone. And even in your second response, it is absolutely a case of both sides. Both sides are biased, so therefore the same? That does not work that way. That is an example of 'middle ground' and people peddling that fallacy is a large reason why the political spectrum has shifted so greatly in the U.S. Bias does not automatically disprove a claim. Does someone with a political agenda have a reason to complain about something that appears to make the other side guilty? Yes. Is it actually true? Completely different question. Pointing out political bias does not answer the second question."

Is it false? You try to play the 'both sides' here but what you are doing is pre-emptively shutting down any criticism be citing this, which is just as flawed and pushing your world view as the people who you are talking about. ""Almost invariably"".. ? Wow, with that reasoning you literally cannot raise a single complaint about media coverage without getting shutdown by your statement, completely whether it is true or not. You are full of way more bullshit than the guy in the picture."

There are tons of cool people/groups posting really great content, just takes some work to find them and be fine with unfollowing anyone that starts sharing crap. I do definitely notice a lot of drama and other bullshit gets through more on Twitter than I'd like. A lot of people that post interesting content are ok with letting their personal fights leak over."
