The bolt head in the middle is a retractor. Turn it one way (usually counter clockwise) and the tensioner will retract. 

Usually the procedure is to retract it, slide the assembly in place, then hold not in place with one hand and get the two bolts started. Get them finger tight and then get them in far enough so that the tensioner is flat against the mounting surface.

Lean burn is really just the next stage in fuel injection. I think most of them are direct injection (fuel is injected into the cylinder directly, instead of into the intake steam like regular injection or carburetors would).

Since we now have reliable and sensitive sensors for airflow and mass the auto companies can cut the fuel use to the bare minimum, just enough to avoid overheating the charge or causing detonation (quick note — a lean charge tends to burn hotter, rich burns cooler. Lean is also prone to “uneven” burns which can result in hot spots in the cylinder or even classic detonation).

I should extend this a bunch but I’ve got meetings and work :)"
MechanicAdvice,ffxf7l5,t1_ffwu6bt,1580323927.0,"Try putting them in front of a bright light and you’ll see how little difference there really is. Reflected light like this amplifies the appearance of any discoloration. 

Also, rub both between your fingers. You’ll feel that they’re indistinguishable to touch. Old oil feels very different — not as viscous, not as “slippery smooth”.

Oil will go black rapidly.  Any carbon in the sump or oil passages will get picked up by the detergents almost immediately and kept in suspension, and any blow by (all cylinders have blow by, the important question is how much) will add to it in a heartbeat. 

Remember that oil is intended to lubricate AND carry particles in suspension. The particles are either big enough for the filter to capture them or small enough to be pretty much harmless in suspension. The next oil change will carry out the suspended particles."
XTerra,ffxe5ef,t1_ffxc668,1580323305.0,"Thanks for the suggestion. I’m a software architect and deal with excel a fair amount. I don’t know that I’ve got enough interest personally to break it down further. 

I’m not averse to doing it at some point, but for now I’ve got too much other stuff on my plate. 

The fuel efficiency change was up because of the introduction of lean burn technology, which lets them pare the fuel usage while cruising down to a bare minimum. 

It would be higher but the later Xterras are slightly taller and wider and have just enough drag increase to offset most of the gains."
XTerra,ffx6m0t,t1_ffwwk63,1580318841.0,"Out of curiosity I calculated how much I spent on fuel for 425k miles. I have intermittent records of miles per tank, gallons to refill the tank, and cost per gallon at the time. 

I’ve tracked it periodically and I average around 19mpg on the highway and about 15mpg around town, so call it an average of 17mpg. I’ve got more highway mileage than around town (about a 60/40 highway/city split), so those will be a little higher than whatever the actual numbers are. 

At 17mpg that’s about 25,000 gallons of fuel. 

Average price for the last two decades seems to be around $2.50 per gallon in my area. It’s been as high as $3.50 and as low as $1.49 per gallon in the records I have. $2.50 is probably a little high for an overall average but I’m to lazy to research the actual average. 

That’s $62,500USD, approximately, over 19 years (2001 - 2019, since it’s only January of 2020). 

So it’s about $3290 per year for fuel, and about 22,400 miles per year. 

The high mileage is a product of long commutes — as much as 120 miles per day — and a lot of weekend trips with the kids to my ex in-laws house, which varied from 100-250 miles depending upon where we were living at the time. 

My ex put about 30% of the miles on the vehicle, the rest are mine.
