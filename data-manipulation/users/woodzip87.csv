I rescued her at about 7 months old, I think. She's now about 10. Her head is still small but the rest of her is so fluffy now."
aww,fgfgirh,t1_fgfgek3,1580738085.0,The line of color going down and out from her eyes always gives her that sad look when she's looking up at you. It's really hard to leave her for work in the mornings :P
ElegooMars,fgbq9oc,t3_excmra,1580665035.0,"I wanna make MH stuff >:| I don't have one yet. Maybe in Q2 of 2020 :P let's get past these taxes... I'm going to fail so many prints though. I hope I can learn plenty in the meantime from this subreddit. Also going to practice at a local ""fab lab"" that has Form 2 printers."
Gunpla,fg2c5qh,t3_ewc0fn,1580442245.0,I just started my first. Well... my second. I did one when I was like 13/14 (i'm 32 now) and i was hard on myself so on and so forth. But I started with the HG RGM-79 'GM'. Very cheap
ElegooMars,ffi0cq1,t1_fff2rxh,1579961184.0,"I gotcha. Thanks. Yeah I can't really afford it now anyways. Own one taxes and such which I wasn't expected. HOA fees. etc. There's a lab near me that has welders, plasma cutters, wood tools, CNC routers, FDM printers, SLA printers, laser cutters, ... and more! So I'll just test out things there to learn the pre- and post-processing. When I get mine maybe I'll be all ready"
ElegooMars,ffi076z,t3_etjwfa,1579961035.0,Bet you can't fit a dozen dogs on a dime.
ElegooMars,ffez84v,t3_esvd5p,1579871112.0,"Due to bills and tax season and stuff I'm going to have to wait anyways. I'm hoping it drops in price by the time I can get to it. I was holding off for it, but $170 more than the now $230 regular Mars..."
aww,ffc6nnd,t1_ffc365j,1579792770.0,So in a sexy way?
WGU,fdknu0x,t1_fdeekah,1578507446.0,I just submitting Task 2 of C726 last night and  had it kicked back. I just submitted it again a couple of hours ago. Now I'm looking at C727 and wondering where to start :P
WGU,fdeb8yg,t3_ekwh9b,1578335238.0,"Nice! Pray for me. lol. I started Dec 1st. I am trying to finish the program in one term to save money and just plain get it over with ASAP. I came in with the CEH so I had 8 classes to go. I finished the first 2 classes in a week. I've been on C726 for... just over 4 weeks. I am, at this very moment, working at section 5.2.5.1 of Task 2. I hate this so much T\_T So vaaague.

Grats!"
