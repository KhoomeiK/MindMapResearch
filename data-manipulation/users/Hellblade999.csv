There's no purpose to life. We're decaying sacks of flesh that evolved over billions of years from atoms. There is no why, just how.

Maybe I'm not meant to be happy, but maybe I'm not meant to be sad either. I'm not meant to be anything, that's how devoid of meaning the universe is.

People ask why I beat myself up and call myself ugly. It’s because my experiences lean to the fact that I am. The fact that I get stonewalled or rejected and the fact that I’ve used multiple dating sites for years and cannot get a first date makes me feel utterly invisible and repulsive.

ForeverAlone,fe94fkm,t3_eo0g38,1578934144.0,"I'm the same age as you. It depends how hopeless you feel, and what you've already tried.

First point of contact is immediate social circles, which could be close friends or people at work. They are the biggest cause of the FA problem in my opinion, and having a social circle that is not conducive to meeting potential partners--directly or indirectly--will cause you to suffer with dating problems. If you have a social circle, ask people in it if they know any single women. Do not be reticent about this, you have nothing to lose if you ask.

Second point of contact failing this can go one of two ways. You can either try a) online dating, which is a crapshoot for most men and can leave you feeling even more unattractive, or b) joining clubs or hobby groups that you are interested in your area. Again, YMMV with clubs, because it depends on location and who attends said hobby groups.

Third point of contact is whether you'll be willing to cold approach in bars or clubs. Many FAs are not willing to do this; even ""normal people"" dislike this option. If you are unwilling then write this off. My advice would be to find a quieter bar with a vibe that matches your interest--so if you like sports go to a sports bar, or if you like rock/metal/indie/etc. then find a bar that plays this type of music--and you could meet friends this way. Friends may lead to meeting women, but this is no guarantee. I made many friends going to bars but I never met any women this way.

The FA problem is primarily a social and mental health one, looks are secondary (they matter a fair bit but are not everything). If you are failing on the three points of contact, ultimately what you do is luck determined. People will tell you to self-improve, but I've done this and it hasn't resulted in any attention.

A feeling that comes along with failing these three points of contact is a feeling that these things can't change, or that you wouldn't know how to change them. This is normal. They can be changed but it does take a lot of effort. If you can't see it changing, the only thing left to do is a build a life as if you'll never find someone. You may not, and if you don't you may as well try to build a life that is as less painful as possible. Pursue your hobbies, follow your passion, do the things you want to do in life, and the loneliness will subside. It won't go away altogether all of the time, but you can certainly experience happiness for good stretches of time on your own."

Firstly I have focused on my hobbies. I exercise, I write a lot, I read a fair bit, I’ve joined clubs, I go out to bars by myself, I play video games and watch films, amongst others. The moment where a woman is supposed to notice this like everyone says it does never happens. I don’t know why this is the case because I don’t act like this in real life. Believe it or not people in person have called me “the happiest guy in the world”. 

If I am not unattractive then fine, but I don’t know how I’m supposed to conclude that I’m not if reality is indicating otherwise. A person who cannot get a job after hundreds of applications will have their confidence knocked, and they will start to feel like they have no value. 

Yes desperation does smell bad, but I don’t know how I will stop wanting a date or sex. I have always been a romantically driven individual, and it’s a curse as much as it is a beautiful thing. Yes I could focus on my hobbies more, but that does not solve the underlying issue at hand."

I’m not jacked or huge, but when I wear fitted clothes people call me big man or muscles. Normal people seem to think that anything over 15 inch arms is fucking massive, but being somewhat above that (15.5 at least) on my 6’1 frame makes them look skinny IMO. But the fact that I get unsolicited comments about going to the gym or having huge arms means I must be doing something right.

The lean/ripped look doesn’t suit me at all. I barely look like I exercise when I’m lean, and I don’t have the best ab genetics either. Despite being stronger than 95% of the population I still looked average when lean. I like to rock the bear mode look, being closer to 15% than 20%, and look tankier in clothes. Plus I get to eat more. 

I used to be really into the gym but I don’t take it as seriously these days. It’s hard to gain strength after a certain point without seriously bulking, and I hate gaining fat so there’s that.

If you're wondering what I've tried:

* Regular exercise with a healthy plant-based diet that involves at least 6-7 portions of fruit and veg per day, but only getting compliments on my muscles by other men. I've built up to 100lb weighted pull-ups for reps.
* Taking jobs that force me to be social
* Joining clubs, but only meeting men or older people through them
* Attending social gatherings, but only meeting other men through them
* Got good grades and a degree, but have sent out hundreds of job applications and cannot get a job that isn't retail, warehouse, or food service. This means I can't afford to move out of my parents' house, at least not without neglecting savings altogether: this is a huge knock to my confidence
* Asking friends for dating advice, but them telling me to just be confident and be myself. One of them literally told me that he wouldn't be confident if he was me, and that I need to get my shit sorted first (but the fact that no one will hire me for good jobs prevents me from getting my shit together)
* Signing up for seven different dating sites, paying for one of them, having my profile reviewed, changing my profile multiple times over, but still cannot get a first date
* Focusing on my own hobbies, including writing, hiking, reading, and even just gaming and watching films when I feel like I've had a productive day. I regularly write on my blog and have started writing a book that I plan to get published: it's been on my bucket list for a while.
* Improved my dress sense and hair style. I literally had a compliment the other day about being well-dressed and that looks aren't the reason I'm alone.

I honestly want to think there's a good reason for dating me, but reality tells me no. The total lack of interest from women in real life and on dating sites makes me feel like I'm ugly. You can think of yourself as a comedian, but if no one laughs at your jokes then are you actually a comedian?
