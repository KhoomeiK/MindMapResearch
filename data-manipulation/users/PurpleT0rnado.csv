RedditForGrownups,ffeo0a4,t3_et5zxa,1579856678.0,"I think you need to ask yourself some serious questions and really think about the answers. 

1. What is your vision of the two of you in a year? 5 years? 30 years? 

2. Your answer to that will help you answer this: do you want to build a life with him? (Love is easy, marriage and kids are about choosing someone you want to spend the next 40 years with and whose genes you want to recreate.) 

Men are different than we are. For most, putting their vulnerabilities out there where anybody, including you, can see them is like inviting a scary, painful death. That might seem ridiculous but that’s why so many American men suicide rather than get help. So be gentle. 

He doesn’t trust you enough right now to talk about what’s bothering him. As mentioned above get to a doctor to see if it could be physical. Do it lovingly and gently, not with threats and ultimatums. You can tell him it’s for life insurance for your child in case he were in an accident.  Hopefully the doctor can at least get him on something to lift his mood enough that you two can talk. 

Then try to find a Good therapist, someone you BOTH connect with. There are many bad therapists out there and there are many good ones who are Not Right for You. 

I know it’s crazy expensive, but you two should make appointments with several, as recommended by friends, family or medical people you know. And, it’s not as expensive as being a single mom. 

On the other hand your answers to the questions may make it clear that you don’t want to re/build a life with him. 

Good luck. It’s hard, but you will survive and hopefully so will he."

They have faced an unimaginably heartbreaking loss. There is a saying that parents are not supposed to outlive their children. You don’t have to share or even understand their grief to be supportive as they try to recover from theirs. 

I also think you should be a little better to yourself. Someone else mentioned college counseling centers. The weird thing about pain and grief is that you can’t always tell how bad it is, and how much better you could be, until you have professional help to dig it out. I strongly encourage you to take advantage of any and all resources you can find.
