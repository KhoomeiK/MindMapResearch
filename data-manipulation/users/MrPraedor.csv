leagueoflegends,ffgl54i,t1_ffgf9qe,1579908757.0,Lets be real its far more often that bot side of the map feeds or gets super fed than top side of the map. Biggest problem in my mind that so many bots are not willing to back out when they see 4 man dive coming and try to out play it. This will always lead one team getting extremely far ahead depending xan bot make the out play.

In its current form for major regions its basically 1 or 2 bo5's against each other and that's it. Getting out of groups is almost meaningless now that LMS is gone and even then last years group B showed that even 3rd seed could get out of MSI groups.

Making it 8 team tournament for example 2 LPL, 2 LEC, 2 LCK and 1 LCS. Last spot would be determined between 2nd LCS and best wildcard team or if you wanted to give 2 wildcards a chance 2nd best LCK and LCS vs 2 best wildcards.

Then 2 groups of 4 with top 3 from each group going to playoffs. Group stage 1st seeds go to semis while 2nd and 3rd go to quarters.

Wildcard vs major region would take 1 day, group stage would take 4 days (2 days for each group) and playoffs would take 3 days (1 quarters, 1 semis and 1 finals). So if you started thursday/friday you could finish by next weeks sunday depending how many rest days you wanted."

Here are the some of the reasonings.

FNC was clearly stronger than S04 was last year, so their base is higher.

FNC maze only one roster change, which  an be considered an upgrade 

S04 made 3 roster changes which only support can be considered as an upgrade.

leagueoflegends,ff9w3xf,t1_ff9u9p7,1579722791.0,If you dont think Impact has been best western Top ever since he came to NA he can not be tier above Soaz all that time. For example Soaz was best EU top S7 and even some parts of S8.
leagueoflegends,ff9vswh,t3_esgcm7,1579722598.0,"1. G2 only one with no player changes. Even if Caps/Perkz swap doesn't work they can always go back. Biggest threat to them is not taking Spring seriously enough.

2. FNC second biggest threat to G2 and I think only team that can beat full power G2. Roster has rather high chanse to go boom, but even then they should be top 5 with purely on player talent.

3. RGE Had only one roster change and it was massive upgrade on adc. Hans is mechanically talented carry who needs someone with voice to guide him. I believe that Vander can be that person.

4. TL Broxah has shown he can jungle for bot sided teams and I think that is best strategy for TL to go forward. If they want to enable Jensen in mid, he needs to be able to guide Broxah. Broxah is good following plans and mechanically talented, but he is not most vocal or able to come up with plans during the game.

5. OG Talented roster that I think would have made to Worlds if Kold didn't have problems during gauntlet. Now he is replaced with Xerxe who is in my mind similar level jungler. ADC change is also side grade in my mind. Destiny and his synergy with jungle/adc will be crucial and  they can even challenge for 2nd if everything works out."
leagueoflegends,ff9r0nh,t1_ff9ndx0,1579719139.0,"Soaz has been at Worlds finals twice and out of groups 5 times. Also Soaz went pretty much even vs TheShy when they faced.

leagueoflegends,ff8dypp,t1_ff89265,1579674477.0,Problem that many NA fans still have hard time to understand. Being top 3 in NA in some roles doesn't necessarily mean you are top tier talent. Licorice is good but still has lot to improve on while players like Impact and Soaz have showed that they can change through different metas and play always at good level.
leagueoflegends,ff8de1j,t1_ff8crq1,1579673842.0,100T or EG would be my guess. Dardoch has had far too many chances to show up before I give him benefit of doubt.
leagueoflegends,ff8d9yc,t1_ff89wbi,1579673718.0,"Ok lets go deep on this one.

>Yeah except Kiin wasn’t the problem on his team, he was the pure reason they were relevant

How was Soaz problem on MSF roster. That roster literally had only 2 winning conditions. Soaz finds an engage or bot lane snowball so much out of controll that mid/late game doesnt matter. 

> sOAZ can’t play carries for shit even when given resources 

He is basically same as Impact. He is most efficient when playing with no or low resourses and can utilize them well. Sure he is not player like Nuguri or Cabo who you want to funnel all your gold, but that is not what game is about in its current state.

> he always loses topside control when he’s playing weak side

This is literally what happens when you play weak side. You give up control of one side of the map to gain it other side. The whole point is that even when he has lost the control on his side of them map he can make most out of it.

> sOAZ can’t do shit unless it’s tank meta, his champion pool is garbage and he cannot play carries for shit.

Soaz has one of the deepest champion pools in competitive scene. Lets be real in NA there are only 2 top laners who can actually play carries at high level Huni and Ssumday. 

> I don’t see how he should be put above Impact when Impact has shown to be able to beat/hold himself against players like Nuguri, TheShy(MSI, not Worlds) and Wunder

You do understand that Soaz has beat/hold himself against players like TheShy (at Worlds) and Wunder."
leagueoflegends,ff8c12q,t1_ff8agqf,1579672418.0,That is just not true and you know it. Just because Impact is winning in NA doesn't mean he is tier above Soaz. Next you are telling me Impact is better than Kiin cause he almost got to relegation last spring.
leagueoflegends,ff89isu,t1_ff85odi,1579669994.0,Practicing so when he finally retires from league he can go to play in NA.
leagueoflegends,ff8771w,t1_ff86brv,1579667949.0,"Ofcourse Eika is pretty unknown to those who dont watch regional leagues and has potential to be total bust, but Soaz and Impact are pretty much exact same player.

Veteran top laner who excels at being weak side player, but can still do his job as carry if given some resourses. Known for his tank play and play making resent years. More of a smart player than hands player. Always performs at high pressure situations."
leagueoflegends,ff86qe1,t1_ff81ss0,1579667558.0,Yes but wasn't this ranking for how they think teams will place end of the split and not how they are coming to split.

leagueoflegends,ff8462e,t1_ff841g8,1579665512.0,Because he is NA talent and does well in NA. Pretty much same as Pob.

leagueoflegends,ff83vgn,t1_ff82eso,1579665291.0,People have tried to tell me this since S5. Last year Soaz had bad team that didn't play around him. There was not much he could do there. Kiin was in similar situation last spring and I think he is on of the best top laners in World.
leagueoflegends,ff83oc9,t1_ff81b3f,1579665138.0,"Impact is good and I think he is pretty much same as Soaz. For Licorice I think he is one of the better tops in NA but everytime he faces better opposition he can't match up let it be Bwipo, Wunder or Kiin. Soaz can still be effective against players like and have controll on games."
leagueoflegends,ff824ru,t1_ff7tku3,1579663996.0,"People have tried to tell me since S5 that Soaz is wached up, but he has kept being top tier top laner in EU. Sure he has had some bad team like S6 Summer OG and MSF last year but I dont hold that against him. For example Kiin in my mind is top 2 top laner in World with TheShy and even he almost went to relegations last spring. 

Top lane as a role is really reliant how well your team does and how much resourses you get from your team. Last year he had to play weak side on a losing team while most of his picks were just so they would have tank/engage in team."
leagueoflegends,ff7z0yj,t3_es4iu4,1579661757.0,"I feel that people are sleeping on IMT Soaz and Xmithie are still easily top 3 in their roles and Hakuho should be ok too. Eika is question mark for me but if he isn't bottom 2 mid laner Altec should be able to play as clean up ADC.

For me they should be lower tier playoff team rather than bottom 3 team."
leagueoflegends,ff7y39e,t1_ff7vtqv,1579661103.0,I would add TSM to that group too.

leagueoflegends,fen0gw6,t1_femvtax,1579274198.0,"Dude you can make argument that G2 was better than FPX when considering whole year, but its extremely disingenuous to claim that FPX was over performing whole year. You dont over perform whole year you are actually good if you manage keep great from whole year around. 

Considering they had 77% win rate whole year and they were 13-2 and 14-1 in regular season shows they were clearly dominating LPL whole year. Sure they had bad playoffs spring, but that was more of a choke than team overperforming every other part of the year."
leagueoflegends,femx31z,t1_femtzgt,1579271868.0,"Yes teams tend to struggle, but ES is totally new team and was ranked last by LPL analysts coming to season."
leagueoflegends,femrol5,t1_femnztk,1579267667.0,He got lots of help in game 1. In game 3 not so much but in that game he didn't use his tp well and got caught. This kind of play is not good if you need to give resourses to your bot lane
