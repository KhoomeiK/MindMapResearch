Advice,fcvxos3,t3_ej1az7,1578012462.0,"First off, so sorry for your loss.

I greatly sympathize for you. I had a dog since I was 7 and he passed away when I was 20. Like you, I had never had anyone close to me pass away before. It hurt like hell and I felt like I lost a part of me. 

As time went on, I didn’t cry every day/night. I learned to cherish the time spent with him and I knew all the happiness he brought me would be of no use if I just saw the pain instead of all the happiness after his passing.

It gets better, and that doesn’t mean you forget them, you just learn to carry their love in your heart. 

That being said, it’s been a few years now and there are still nights my heart hurts, but I know my furry friend is looking down on me. 

You got this!"

depression,fcttgss,t3_eivgjg,1577958642.0,"Hi!! 

Im currently 21, and I feel you. When I was 18 i was stressing out about my relationship at the time (it was 4 years). We planned on moving in together and all that good stuff. Long story short, it didn’t work out. Not gonna lie, it was one of the worst pains of my life holy shit. But whether or not you end up with your SO through this, know there is so much more to life than these moments/relationships. 

You got this, trust!"
depression,fcttanu,t3_eivkwd,1577958393.0,"I’m assuming you’re young and currently live with your family? If so, it gets so much better when you move out my dude. Been there, and still go there almost  every time I visit my family."
