ChoosingBeggars,feku95x,t3_eplznn,1579207720.0,That sounds like some bs to me.  Take them to small claims court and get your money.  Don't fall for that crap.
ChoosingBeggars,fei6lyn,t3_ep4wht,1579131434.0,"Time to take that wench to small claims court for the cost of babysitting AND the ipad.  I'm pretty sure the judge wouldn't like her attitude at all.  I'm sorry you're having to deal with an immature, selfish, entitled jerk like her and her husband. :("
insanepeoplefacebook,febxgp4,t3_eo7mq9,1578963887.0,Can we just shoot her into the sun and call it a day?
cosplay,fe0f4k0,t1_fe0a3sz,1578812328.0,"Honestly, I kind of liked the time jumps.  It wasn't really as confusing as everyone told me it would be (and that's from someone who hasn't yet played the games).  I thought the way they brought it together at the end was interesting."
AskReddit,fdmqop5,t1_fdmhkan,1578561046.0,"Same here (as far as fighting with obesity, my parents didn't force me to eat, but my aunts and uncles did when I had to stay with them because my parents were working)."
AskReddit,fdmqn3z,t1_fdm3egs,1578560984.0,"My aunts and uncles on my dad's side had this rule, but to top it off we weren't allowed anything to drink until after the food was finished.   They had no concept of portion sizes so they would give adult sized portions to us little kids.   I hated dinner time when I stayed with them, it was so bad.    Thankfully my parents weren't like that.  I have severe weight issues now though because of this crap.  Seriously people, don't do this shit to your kids. They will eat as much as they want when they want to, don't force it."

pics,fctp458,t3_eirpkp,1577952372.0,"Congrats friend!  It's hard, even after a year (i've fallen on and off the bandwagon a few times myself).  You don't know me, but know I'm proud of you for sticking with it!"
USPS,fcrz00z,t1_fcqo9cf,1577908666.0,In 2016 I started my USPS career as a cca (now a FTR clerk at the plant). I NEVER saw a map like this or had a route explained to me.  That and I rarely had the same route at the same station twice in the two months I lasted.  It was ridiculous.
aww,fcmy2h6,t3_ehygcw,1577797211.0,"Dad looks so proud of his son, too.  I love it! <3"
Overwatch,fcjvtvk,t3_ehgqh8,1577707210.0,"Wait, was that Kaplan Rein at the end?  I want that to happen soooo bad."
