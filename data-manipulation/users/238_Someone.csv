So the real problem is SSD and Medicare are not adequately funded, it isn't the handful of people defrauding the system."

You can say that but the real problem is that SSD and Medicare are grossly underfunded. 

This is not a result of too many undeserving people on the roles, because the vast majority of people (like me and yourself) that have been approved have earned our benefits. The estimated amount of fraud is $3 Billion out of **$900 Billion**, so eliminating this $3 billion per year of improper payments would only reduce costs by at most 0.4 percent.

To illustrate how insignificant that amount is; reducing the $3 bil in fraud to zero would only extend the solvency of the Social Security Program by **3 months** for the entire current life span of the program.

Like most disabled people, I can barely make ends meet and I can't hardly afford medical treatment, and that is the fault of politicians because the money and the means to secure those funds exists, and there are many ways to accomplish this, there is just no political will to do so because it would mean that large corporations and the rich would have to start pulling their weight.

The Social Security Trustees estimate that reducing benefits to restore solvency would require **an immediate 16.4 percent benefit cut** – the equivalent of reducing benefits this year by more than $150 billion. This means even after they wiped out all instances of fraud, it would require cuts to **yours** and **my benefits** benefits if they went through with the ""necessary"" cuts. I put ""necessary"" in quotes because the cuts are not necessary, the issue is funding, not fiscal responsibility because there's very little fraud in SSD compared to other government programs. 

In conclusion, government fraud and waste needs to be cut elsewhere, and SSD should be properly funded before they try to cut benefits to anyone, and afterward they can talk about issuing reviews and eliminating what little paltry amount of waste that exists.

Doing all that (minus collectivizing the Fed) would add nearly a trillion dollars of tax revenue yearly, more than enough to pay for all kinds of welfare, social spending, and public works projects. 

But no need to worry, taxing the rich would likely be enough alone to cover expanded social spending.

Conservatism is just ruthless Opportunism, it is codified selfishness that is based and dependent upon a self-perpetuating all-consuming fear. 

Which is why Conservatism is doomed to fail, because it always and invariably collapses inwards due to self-interested backstabbing and paranoia."
