fatlogic,ffck9qs,t3_esw8kh,1579801252.0,"This is definitely something I’m working on right now. Ideally, I’d like to not be dependent on MyFitnessPal forever so I’m learning how to tune into my body. 

It kinda sucks. Counting calories is easier."
MarioMaker2,feaazty,t3_eo3bob,1578946461.0,Thanks for posting this! Watching that segment was amazing and I was too enthralled to take down any of the course codes.
LoseitChallenges,fea97ih,t3_eo479q,1578945855.0,Thanks for the reminder! I logged!

PCOS_childfree,fdoxpci,t1_fdnz8pm,1578615263.0,The sidebar where links to stuff shows up (if you’re on desktop which I never am lol)
fatlogic,fdo0tk7,t3_em00tr,1578596784.0,"I just recently got my license and started driving. I still park like an asshole. There have definitely been times where I have been doing the dose shuffle between my car and the one beside me because even the quietest parts of the Costco parking lot are still busy af. 

Should I be whining about experienced driver privilege?

Nah, I’ll just keep parking far away. I could use the walk anyways. It’s not **that** cold out."
fatlogic,fdo0al0,t3_em3sda,1578596472.0,Okay so you never learned to listen to your body or create healthy habits and instead white knuckled your way through weight loss and maintenance so as soon as you went back to your old way of eating you gained the weight back. K. Got it.
PCOS_childfree,fdnxt9g,t3_ce42ap,1578595030.0,"Thank you! I am so happy to finally find a PCOS space that isn’t all TTC and diet posts!

ETA: I’m offering sidebar help if you would like. I’ve never done sidebar stuff, but I’ll definitely learn."

PCOS,fdkntgo,t3_elv2lo,1578507437.0,"I feel this in my soul.

I especially feel your comment about wishing this wasn’t so fertility focused. That seems to be a thing in every PCOS group I’ve found. I get that this is a very real struggle for those who want to conceive. I am not one of those people.

But I also get that lots of doctors are still under the impression that PCOS only matters if you want to conceive. I know for myself, I was definitely told that and it wasn’t until I started trying to lose weight and looking for resources and communities to connect with that I started to learn that there was so much more going on and the impact of the disorder and importance of treatment had been extremely downplayed.

I also am trying to actively treat PCOS. Started taking metformin. Trying to find a dietician who doesn’t just roll their eyes at me and tell me to “eat better” (aw yeah public health). My insurance now covers dietician without a referral so I am hoping going the private dietician road will be better. Also working on getting more exercise. 

I learned about these treatment options from this group. Just had to filter through pages and pages of pregnancy posts to get there."
fatlogic,fdd1bt5,t3_ekk3u2,1578290882.0,"I guess this means I’m no longer fat. Fuck yeah!

And to think I was going to eat less in order to stop being fat. The fuck was I thinking?"
LoseitChallenges,fda7bm6,t3_ejf8nn,1578242606.0,"I’m sorry if this has been posted somewhere... I’ve looked and can’t find it. I’m also sorry if this is old news, it’s been awhile since I’ve participated in a challenge. Do we no longer have team subreddits?"
Winnipeg,fb5epvl,t1_fb4v5uw,1576526253.0,Right? How bad are taxis when a 45 minute wait for a ride share is way better than having to call a cab?
