starwarsblackseries,fee60vx,t1_fee51ca,1579027125.0,"Well itâ€™s evident that we collect for totally different reasons. I collect because I like the look of the figures and they bring about a sense of nostalgia and joy. I honestly donâ€™t care if they appreciate or depreciate over the long haul. Also, youâ€™d make way more money passively by actually investing in the market. 

And most collectors here on this sub seem to disagree with you."
starwarsblackseries,fee4j1t,t1_fee3ysu,1579026237.0,"They are both collectibles, but the circumstances of appreciation are different. The current asking price of a 1979 Kenner Boba Fett isnâ€™t due to scalpers buying out retailers to hoard them and resell. 

No, not everyone gets a trophy but that doesnâ€™t mean you should go around trying to rain on other peopleâ€™s parades because of some personal desire for exclusivity."
starwarsblackseries,fee3mqo,t3_eoo3jb,1579025708.0,"I agree that people without money to collect probably shouldn't, but people here aren't complaining about MSRP - they're complaining about profit-driven scalpers who buy up entire cases just to resell at huge markups. To hobbyists, which this sub is primarily comprised of, you're demonstrating a lack of moral fiber and depriving fans/future collector generations of equal opportunity to enjoy the Star Wars figures that we all love. Also, vintage figures do have hefty price tags, but that's primarily because they aren't offered by major retailers anymore... and I don't see how that applies to this Mando situation. 

Basically, stop trying to justify your scalper hustle on a hobbyist sub and take that shit to r/Flipping."
