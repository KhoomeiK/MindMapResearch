soccer,fezivs4,t1_fezfwxo,1579457787.0,"Well, Barcelona passed on him, so he had to lower his expectations a bit."
soccer,fezc8fj,t1_fez827d,1579455872.0,"Honestly, I would say no. The keeper is guaranteed to get the ball first. It's never within playable distance for Van Dijk."
soccer,fezbphu,t1_fez88g2,1579455738.0,It's not a fair challenge in my opinion. There's no way VVD can get to the ball before De Gea. The only way he can win it is by impeding the goalkeeper.
unitedkingdom,fesoqtj,t1_ferladz,1579367497.0,"People have been misinformed so long about what makes us fat and the power of exercise to make us thin that it can be hard to break through those mental barriers and easy to convince ourselves we're doing the right things even when the evidence shows we're not.

Around 18 months ago, I was just under 15 stone - despite having an active job and fulfilling what the government recommends as daily exercise. I spent two months eating an average of 1500 calories a day and lost over 30lbs. It's one of the best things I've ever done.

The dangerous time is often trying to return to a ""normal"" diet. Even with multiple visits to the gym each week you can still easily put on weight with sporadic stress eating."

todayilearned,fd52bhi,t1_fd516sp,1578173577.0,The US didn't pursue Saddam because it would have exceeded the UN mandate and put at risk the coalition that Bush Sr. had assembled.
totalwar,fd230of,t1_fd1fy5x,1578140898.0,"In fairness, if an army lost half its fighting men in battle, it would probably struggle to capitalise on its victory. It's just that TW doesn't work that way."
MapPorn,fd2037q,t1_fczyrsi,1578139544.0,The number of Americans reporting 'English' ancestry halved between 1980 and 2000 according to the US census.
notliketheothergirls,fd1c2wh,t1_fd13psz,1578129651.0,"Except that's demonstrably not true. The chance of a baby being born male vs. female varies around the globe.

For example, the UK has records going back to the early 1800s. Every single year, more boys than girls have been born. What's interesting is that this leads to a balanced gender demographic around the age of 30 and women significantly outnumbering men by middle age.

Edit: looking more deeply it looks like there's some debate about whether this happens at conception or if female fetuses have a higher chance of miscarriage."

AskReddit,fcqgzji,t1_fcq4cje,1577885825.0,Same. I get funny looks on the treadmill though.
todayilearned,fcqgpru,t1_fcq71hi,1577885677.0,"Popular conception of him is tainted by the personal animosity many American generals felt against him rather than his capabilities. Certainly, he was a flawed leader who took credit for the successes of others, but I can't help but feel the balance has swung unfairly against him."
MapPorn,fco5ld4,t1_fcnukzb,1577824515.0,*Wages of Destruction* by Adam Tooze is the place to start.
MapPorn,fcngwzv,t1_fcnaiba,1577811468.0,The Nazi economy was based on strict price and wage controls. They lacked critical resources and had burned through their foreign currency in the 1930s. The outlook for their economic model was bleak regardless by 1939.
MapPorn,fcn9nji,t1_fcn6bax,1577806809.0,The German economy would have likely collapsed without a war.  It was dependent on war plunder and expansion.
toptalent,fcl6he7,t1_fcl2ah2,1577740848.0,Pretty big. The world champion earns £500k and there are tournaments throughout the year with six figure top prizes.
Darts,fcl5lcx,t1_fcl5clf,1577740302.0,Definitely not the rugby attitude I know. What a poser.
Darts,fcl52zv,t1_fcl4v8p,1577739988.0,"Shameful from a former rugby player if that's down to Price. Once the game is over, 100% respect to your opponent whatever the outcome."
unitedkingdom,fckytu3,t3_ehm3gc,1577736118.0,I really don't give a shit. But the idea of inviting this country to elect our head of state given recent results doesn't exactly enthuse me.
Gunners,fbxfy3m,t3_eeywj4,1577185408.0,"Over the past twelve months, they managed to make an experienced manager look like he's never coached a day in his life. 

There seems to be a number of thoroughly unlikeable characters in this squad."
