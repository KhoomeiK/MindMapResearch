Edit: you people actually don't understand what lobbying is. Lobbying is when a special interest group sends a person who schedules meetings with legislative staff, presents policy ideas or bills in those meetings, and either gets told ""no thank you, try a different office"" or reaches an agreement to work together to draft legislation. Your corrupt congressman having dinner with corrupt board members and CEOs and agreeing to vote a certain way for favors or a promise of a job IS bribery, but it ISN'T lobbying. Honestly, conflating bribery and lobbying is in the best interest of these monied organizations because it normalizes the illegal behavior that they are engaging in as ""lobbying"" even though it isn't legal.
