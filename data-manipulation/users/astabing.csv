gnome,ff8oop4,t3_es9wqp,1579689230.0,"I am achieved it by copying original .desktop file to $HOME/.local/share/applications/ and appending ""env GTK\_THEME=Adwaita-dark"" to ""Exec="" key inside that file. ""Adwaita-dark"" here is the dark Adwaita theme.

So, for example for ""virt-manager"" it would be looking like:

`grep Exec virt-manager.desktop`

`Exec=env GTK_THEME=Adwaita-dark virt-manager`

Original .desktop file for virt-manager for example could be found using:

`dnf repoquery -l virt-manager | grep .desktop`

`/usr/share/applications/virt-manager.desktop`

Would like to know how same could be achieved for Flatpak apps"

Watches,feh67xa,t3_ep5avx,1579109993.0,"This is my first ever watch. ""Raketa"" from early childhood presented by my loved abuelita (aka ""babushka"" in these places) more than 30 years ago. 

For some reason this watch is unofficially known as ""Raketa Star Wars"". Dunno, likely in past USSR times it looked futuristic, but currently it's funny to compare it with any nowadays smart watch

Everything except band and glass is original. Originally it came with similar milanese band, so design concept is preserved. I also found a guy selling bunch of original new glasses for this watch model and just in case bought several and replaced old one

Now it fully serviced and ticking similarly to my other Swiss watch - something about 1-2 seconds late per day which is not bad for the old guy, huh"

You will be able to find a job in Vilnius definitely, but in some places work culture could still be kind of post-soviet, so likely this could be difficult. But not sure, somebody from logistics could tell more. 
In your place I would try to take long vacation and try to live and observe here for some month or so at let say autumn. If you will be happy, then This is a way :)"

cybersecurity,fc8id3x,t1_fc8f3fw,1577535543.0,"I am pretty sure China already have its own autonomous internet which could be disconnected from the world if needed. But they have too many global economic ties to not talk or even think about disconnecting themselves from global net. BTW, firewall is not that simple, it seem to me simpler to prepare for country scale intranet than setup huge filtering boxes on perimeters.
In terms of Russia I think all these talks about possible war is just bluff from them, they just do not have military or financial resources to be at war with NATO, for example take last case with aircraft carrier Kuznecov which was on fire - they even can not fix and put on service one fucking ship! Their elite lives, having businesses or even have citizenships of western countries, it would be kind of war with themselves for them. All they care is their money and their citizens to be disconnected, misinformed and so silent as much as possible"
