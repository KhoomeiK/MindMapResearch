wow,fel8x36,t1_fel7so3,1579216624.0,"Same. From lvl 1-110 you explore the world, quest, and collect mats mostly alone. With the occasionally stranger running by. You could invite them and quest together, but it’s hard unless you happen to be on the same stage of the same quest (and it isn’t a struggle for 1 person). Otherwise you just enjoy the RPG.

If you crave the MMO part, there is a Looking For Group button and you can Que for a range of dungeons for your level. I recommend doing each one once. You are partied with 4 other players and...while pretty easy, it isn’t soloable by you alone. So you do work together as healer, tank, and 3 DPS.

Once you hit 110, the world gets a bit busier and there are monsters and quests you cannot do without others joining in to help. At 120 you are with the active player base doing world quests, raids, Weeklies, Timewalking, and mythic dungeons"

Vermintide,fdnn6v4,t1_fdms23p,1578589286.0,"Thank you for the write up! Something like this was what I was looking for. (I had found Royale w/ cheese’s guides to Cataclysm but I couldn’t find anything for Champion (post 2.0 patch information is hard to find.)

Our weapons and gear are all over the place, since we just equip whats the highest level (unless it’s grey)(Someone mentioned not burning Dust because you want it for later? But i feel like we should burn dust now and turn blues into oranges maybe and find those talents you mentioned. Maybe hold that gear for 30 or so power levels. Would that be right?) 

but generally IB has something+shield, BH has Rapier/falch/axe, Pyro has Bolt staff, Kruber BoT has sword/shield ( he’s my bot, i can definitely swap him to a exec. Sword)

For talents, i know that we all have the lvl 5 temp. Hit points. I think its on stagger for IB, headshot/crits for BH and melee kill for kruber bot. Then our Sienna has the “heal yourself to heal others” since she’s the most squishy and every-time we find extra heals we have her heal herself to top off the rest. It seemed smart at the time. We also all have the Overwhelming Power talent.

Generally our playstyle is: Ironbreaker is leading the charge, pushing and swinging. Pyro sits in the middle casting and using her Ult to clear specials, BH watches the rear and snipes specials with ranged weapon, and Kruber Bot....well he’s a good boy and is just enjoying being out killing things. Lol.

We don’t have a dedicated armor slayer though...it’s kind of a group effort (or bombs) to kill the 2-3 shield or armor vermin if they spawn. Although as BH i try to headshot all of them and I save my Ult for the really big armored guys. But I’m not a perfect shot.

Another redditor mentioned not focusing the boss during the horde....and I think thats why we wiped so much on Champion. It’s like, on vet there’s Monster Music and we fall back to open ground, clapping ourselves on the back for finding a good area to fight. Then while we fight maybe 1 special spawns and i just pick’em off. Or a horde spawns but we keep chipping the boss and push the horde and its a bit messy, but we do it.

On Champion Monster music plays, then a gutter runner starts chattering and Im looking for him when....gattling rat! And we swing to tag and shoot and then Hook rat grabs someone! Then we race to help and bam! Gutter runner pounces, and the whole time we’re all chipping at the boss and he’s swiping each of us, chipping our health....then two of us are down and we wipe.

God help us if a horde spawns too. Lol."

We use a little Amazon best seller electric heater on our feet at our computer desk, but thats about it. I hope that helps! (I’m curious if you get a thermometer what the temp is. I hope its not less than 60!)

Maybe instead of huddling in an office type room, try closing all the doors off and staying in the living room. It should be the most “central” and heated portion. I know each of my rooms get real cold inside if i leave them shut without airflow"

So i try to just find small tips to help us get an idea of what we should be doing. Like when we reached lvl 15 and the “stagger”talent row was really confusing I was able to just recommend the flat 7% power one because I read someones guide where they did the math.

I’m hoping there might be some other small tips I can ease in, like, always fight in small rooms on champion, or, idk, one person should always be ranged and the rest melee? We just have no strat on Veteran, we just balls-to-the-wall it and we win, lol. But Champion was a beast."

We win Veteran games hands down, but we only get like, 25% through Champion before trash/Monster spawn kills us. So we’ve just been doing Vet QP and mixing it up looking for tomes and grims which is pretty fun and can be challenging. Should we just keep doing this until 300 power level gear drops or until a higher level?  

I feel like there is a strategy we’re missing...maybe we should spend our resources now to upgrade our blues to oranges? Or optimize our talents somehow? (We are Pyromancer, Bounty Hunter, Ironbreaker,  and a Mercenary BOT)
