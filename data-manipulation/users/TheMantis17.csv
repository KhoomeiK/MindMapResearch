reksaimains,ffsrh07,t1_ffrtzeg,1580189835.0,"Most efficient farm is complex, yet simple- I usually start red with Q, then head over to Krugs with W (for healing) and then to raptors. It’s important to utilize that healing as often as possible. I like to weave in, burst Q, heal, repeat. Also be sure that you are using the unburrow airborne effect on monsters not on cool down. Don’t want to waste that either. Ultimately, you’re just trying to get whatever you can reach quickly, because your early game strength and clear speed is nuts compared to other junglers.

If I learned anything playing Rek’Sai, it’s that people are very predictable. If you can use it to figure out how people move, you can easily get the drop on enemy champs.

Often times there are champs (like ADC’s) who would melt you if they saw you coming, but if you surprise them, you will often win.

Also Hail of Blades is the best. Pog champ."
