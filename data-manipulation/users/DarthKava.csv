We should be able to lead a dignified existence regardless of income.  I am in Australia and will always be happy to pay Medicare tax so that essential medical assistance is free for everyone. Society where everyone lives a dignified existence is the one I want to live in.  Government taxes, laws and spending should reflect the need for dignified existence.  A low income family or a pensioner should be taken care of if need be regardless of what they have contributed to society.  By the same token the person who works hard to learn a profession or invests time and money into a project or an invention should be able to enjoy the fruits of their hard work.  They deserve to be able to buy a mansion, a large boat, a jet.  They can travel anywhere they want and stay in fancy hotels.  They have earned this money.  They can spend it however they want.  Should they pay taxes? Absolutely! If they avoid taxes through loopholes in legislation then it is up to the government to close those loopholes.  If they pay taxes in full, what is your problem with them? If someone has a lot of money they have earned (not stolen) why would you complain that they have too much. They contribute to society by paying taxes.  What else you want from them? Do you have any particular people in mind, or do you despise the entire rich class?"

movies,ffozshf,t1_ffo3jfg,1580083738.0,"No, I didn’t think you were condescending. Not at all. I think that downvoting and upvoting is a quick and useful way to show your agreement or disagreement with a statement.  Reddit is a lightly moderated Wild West of people with different attitudes, cultures, level of maturity, etc. 
I have been banned from subs and downvoted into oblivion before so this is no news to me.  I do enjoy those rare occasions though when people have a thoughtful discussion.  It’s quite refreshing and worth it for those moments."
movies,ffnwl4t,t1_ffmqfiy,1580071681.0,"Yes, I suppose that this is just a reminder for myself that just like in “Who’s line is it anyway “, the points don’t matter."
movies,ffnw92x,t1_ffni9c5,1580071543.0,"Yes, this is one of those quite polarising movies that you either love instantly or feel quite indifferent to.  It may also matter at what stage in your life you watched it for the first time.  It’s quite fascinating."
television,ffjvl90,t1_ffiq0d0,1580008158.0,It’s like three shows in one sentence.  Firefly BSG and SW.  Respect!

Sam Beckett sacrifices himself to fix his friend’s life.  He is now all alone..."

movies,ffimz3i,t1_ffhrzxh,1579977754.0,"Yeah, that’s where I got the idea from.:)"
movies,ffimttn,t1_ffiedzy,1579977652.0,Yes
movies,ffhoyu7,t3_eto026,1579946156.0,"The Big Lebowski is my only 11/10 because there seems to be no limit to how many times a year I can watch it and still enjoy it every time.
10/10 is LOTR trilogy, Band of Brothers, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill.  I am sure there are others but this ones sprung into my mind straight away."
AskMen,ffhepf4,t1_ffgoopz,1579932167.0,Agreed!
AskReddit,ffhelxs,t1_ffgub7x,1579932062.0,"Well, I wouldn’t describe the conditions which Chinese workers have to work in as the best.  Not sure about their lifestyle or quality of life, but in the West they don’t have to put nets around the building to catch the workers jumping to their death."
AskReddit,ffgrktk,t1_ffg75cn,1579913259.0,"Ok, please give me specific examples and let’s discuss them. I bet the non-qualified worker in the west would still be better off than a Soviet worker in the same situation."
AskReddit,ffgrc01,t1_ffg7eyj,1579913083.0,"Ok, you are describing a human experience ANYWHERE.  I still maintain that it is easier to break the mould and succeed in the western country than in the USSR/communist regime."
AskReddit,ffgr2us,t1_ffgpczt,1579912900.0,I agree there.  Humidity is the worst! Once I visited Townsville in the early summer. It was like casing through a heavy hot mist.
AskReddit,ffg6mk2,t1_ffg453c,1579899582.0,"Ok, but statistically is it reasonable to assume that if you put years into your study in school and university and study hard to get good marks, you are more likely to get a good job? Then, if you do your job well, you are likely to be promoted?  Or perhaps, if you become well known in your field, you can get a much better job in another company? Luck plays a role, of course, but one has to be good enough to be able to utilise an opportunity when it presents itself.  Going back to the original point, the difference between the West and USSR,  in the West you can elevate yourself through hard work.  In USSR you couldn’t, because everyone is supposed to be equal."
AskReddit,ffg5lhj,t1_ffg3ssk,1579898947.0,"Well, lets be honest, Ditch digging is not going to compensate you well financially ANYWHERE.  When I said hard work I meant that working hard is more likely to be financially rewarding than being a slacker in your chosen profession.   Its all relative.

Edit. In USSR you got paid your standard wage regardless of how good your work was. That usually removes any incentive to go above and beyond."
