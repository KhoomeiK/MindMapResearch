SuicideWatch,ff3u6xs,t1_ff3ok0a,1579548938.0,"My god I was just thinking about that, I past by a comercial of a woman sitting with her two kids and I couldn't help but thinking: maybe the answer was to never leave in the first place, maybe the reason why I am deeply insatisfied is because I have lived many lives in so little time and now I can't appreciate any, maybe it was never meant for people to be integrated in more than one society because then the pleasure of companionship will start to feel too fake, from an evolutionary point of view this makes perfect sense since we only have unlucked this option only a few decades ago and nature had made us so that we naturally belong to our original tribe for a better of survival.."
SuicideWatch,ff3jltk,t3_erf1lu,1579542439.0,"Hi there, I just wanna say that I feel exactly the same, though my life is not as ""perfect"" as yours and I am 26 yo; I believe that I really am not depressed or sad, just really not interested in life anymore, I got a job in country that is not my home country, and the only thing keeping going is a the fact that I could never feel a sense of belonging anywhere I went, I traveled many many times and setteled in many places but I have no friends ""not cuz I can't make any but because I really am not interested in the people I met throughout my life"" so I'm telling myself that I'm feeling like this only because I didn't meet the right people that can accept me as I am, but deep inside I'm afraid that even when I find a community that I feel like I beling to I would still feel like this and in that case I really wouldn't know what to do"

SuicideWatch,fcyqvlo,t3_ejbjwl,1578085207.0,"I feel exactly the same and here's what am telling myself, I will definitely kill muself one day but until then I have to try all the things that people say are worth living for, I did try lots of things by now and I can see that they are as wortheless as life itself but I'm just telling myself that maybe I'm wrong and the only way to make sure is to try all the rest, one thing I'll never do though is bring a kid to this world because I'd never make a person suffer and especially not my son, and if there's one thing I know for sure is that life ia suffering and there's no escaping from the existential dread of being alive, it's true that I'm extremely lonely (not because I can't make friends, in facts many many ppl want to be friends with me but I just have very high standards when it come to the quality of the ppl I should spend time with) so my goal now is to find as community that I feel I belong to because I feel like I never felt the sense of belonging in my life, maybe that would make me reconaider, if that too didn't feel meaningful then I'll shoot myself in the head and I'll go back to being nothing"
