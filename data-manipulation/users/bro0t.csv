The amounts of stress needs to be reduced in society. Because then people are less likely to self medicate with alcohol/weed/other stuff. Which is a very common trigger for mental problems.

If people have substance abuse issues help them instead of stigmatize them. Be more open about it. Give proper education on them that is unbiased. Instead of the “everything is evil” speech i got.

Because most of the things they say about things like mushrooms is wrong, its not addictive, you cant overdose. And i never heard the word psychosis once during those classes. Which i think is something people should mention.

Getting rid of the drug problem isnt banning them, but educating, because people are gonna try it anyway. So its better to tell them how to do it safely so they dont get hurt.

schizophrenia,ff63odr,t1_ff635da,1579618337.0,"I believe the fast would have some effects. I dont know but it could be possible.

As far as i know the amount of schizophrenia cases (%) hasnt risen that much and is pretty stable.

But the percentage of depression, burn outs and anxiety disorders have risen a lot the last years. On top suicide among students has risen as well. (Someone i knew before i dropped out killed herself a few months ago)
And thats a problem. But i think thats mostly environmental. Seeing how college pressure is higher. Tuition is way higher and forces people to go in debt if they dont have rich parents. Only to work for a pretty low wage if they are even able to get a job.

If we fix that less people will have depression and anxiety. And there will be more attention to those with schizophrenia or PTSD and stuff like that.

But i know some people have “outies” i believe they are called. My best guess is just nature being weird"
Showerthoughts,fei7vu5,t1_fei7rwv,1579132249.0,Yea thats still the scar from the umbilical cord.
schizophrenia,fei7tfj,t1_fei7qig,1579132206.0,"Yea exactly. But because my thoughts were also a mess it was really hard to figure out what was real and what wasnt.

It sucked"
schizophrenia,fei7lq7,t1_fei7a5k,1579132071.0,"For me voices were mostly from the outside like imagine the last time you talked to someone, how their voices sounded.
Like that. 
Although i had also some in my head that were like thoughts but not mine. They felt like sounds but the source was inside my head. It was kind of fucky."
schizophrenia,fei6z12,t1_fei6ns6,1579131668.0,"They dont recognize the symptoms.
The hallucinations and delusions feel so real. They ARE real to you. And that impacts your behaviour and turns it “crazy” for lack of a better word.

Although some people know something is up. I heard voices and was aware it wasnt a good sign. But the delusions i didnt find out for myself until i was on meds for about 4-5 months already.

There is no way to give someone a “taste” of psychosis so to say.
Have them have symptoms for a half hour in a safe environment.
If thats possible people would react differently.


They cant imagine what its like to have this disorder because you cant imagine what a “different reality” is like"
schizophrenia,fei6htl,t3_epaj0h,1579131360.0,"Well. It is common for psychotic people to not know they are. I didnt know i had sz until my doctor told me i probably have it 2 years ago.

My mom said the same thing
You cant have schizophrenia because you never had a psychotic break (while i was psychotic)

Its hard to understand when you never experienced it yourself"
dndmemes,fei48ix,t1_fei4333,1579129931.0,"No idea. Its dnd, do whatever the fuck you want.
My bar had a rule that if you were sitting at the bar with your back towards the bartenders you had to give them a beer. And when a regular did it you also got an ice cub in your neck.

Fun times"
