TooAfraidToAsk,ffeqsfh,t3_et8anf,1579860895.0,"A specific answer is that human diseases are easier to catch than those exclusive to animals. That’s not to say some diseases can’t be transferred to humans. Those are called zoonotic diseases. 

Another non-biological disease that can be ‘caught’ is that of folded prion disease. This is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and is generally referred to as mad cow’s disease or Kuru. It’s caused by the consumption of affected nerve tissue that contains these folded prions which are introduced as a protein into the brain and cause tissue to disintegrate because they’re integrity is altered due to the fact that it is folded and doesn’t behave the same. Spongiform encephalitis is the generic term that medically describes the condition. Spongiform meaning full of holes and encephalitis which means death of brain tissue. So, holy brain death, Batman!

This is only a risk when eating brain and nerve tissue of an affected animal or in some cases humans. The transfer from human to human is far more prevalent in studied cases in part because a tribe of natives in Papua New Guinea had a tradition of eating the brains of their deceased and they were the known exposed demographic. 

Risk of transfer from an animal to human is pretty low if the meat is properly butchered and only certain parts of the animal are consumed. It’s also becoming more important with livestock to not feed slaughter byproducts back to the animals as was practiced for a long time in a kind of morbid attempt to recycle.

I believe the social implications are a result of keeping order and not seeing your fellow human as food or being fearful of becoming dinner.

So in short, disease, and an ordered society keep us from eating each other like what some may refer to as “savages.”"

People talk about sleep hygiene a lot with things like keeping your devices and entertainment off and allowing your mind to calm. But there are those who can utilize things like a book on tape or some kind of media to occupy their mind enough to keep it from racing on things that might otherwise cause you to remain awake. 

The point of them saying to keep devices off is so you can disengage the mind enough to get rest whereas some can put on, for example, a documentary on a subject they’re familiar with and maybe have seen enough that it’s not new or engaging and just follow it enough for it to be somewhat hypnotic enough to sleep. 

There’s a whole subreddit for people who use Futurama for just that. It’s called r/Futurama_Sleepers. Sleep psychologists tend to not like this use of television, etc., because that area of psychology still has some etablishmentarianism that holds onto some older premises that being day people is natural for everyone and that sleeping space has to be silent and devoid of anything that is remotely stimulating.

Also Facebook needs a dislike button so people can quickly and effectively show that. It would help to disengage the false sense of general agreement and echo chambers so commonly reinforcing false senses of majorities throughout social media.

NoStupidQuestions,ff7hmnm,t1_ff7gpsp,1579649754.0,"That’s probably the underlying cause there. Apparently it’s important to not be in bed unless you’re tired and think you’re able to sleep. If you spend time in bed not sleeping then you’ll start to associate bed as a place where you aren’t sleeping and/or dread going to. 

Even if it means less sleep for a few nights try to go to bed only if you’re tired enough to sleep. It won’t change that you’re not sleeping a bunch as it is anyways. When you return to bed the next night you will be more exhausted and it could help the pattern to readjust. 

If this is chronic I’d also suggest talking to your doc about sleep meds that could help. 

But some of us have a natural sleep pattern that pushes us to be wakeful later and and that makes for a pattern for us to sleep late and wake later. It’s like a circadian rhythm that is longer than 24 hours. You might be one of these people. It’s super difficult and makes integrating into the world’s “normal” cycle very challenging."

These entities don’t want competition or regulation and would like to be able to manipulate their profits based on what we have to pay for basic services as they see fit. 

Ajit Pai, the chairman of the FCC decided to ignore all electronically submitted petitions for net neutrality citing the excuse that there are “too easily faked,” thus allowing him to serve the special interests who lobby and petition to keep their ability to monopolize the services they provide and what content you are and are not able to access and the speed at which services are accessed on their infrastructure. 

Whoever is either elected or remains in office, Ajit Pai needs to be removed in favor of someone who is less compliant to an industry that is full of  monopolies. Trump appointed him but trump likes to fire people. Let’s hope he gets a bug up his ass and fires Ajit, but hoping doesn’t do much when the only people that can do anything about it are more interested in serving big business than the interests of the people.

On the actual topic of Ariana Grande, she’s a pop icon. And it’s not like pop stars don’t work hard at what they do, but her music is generically poppy. It’s so much this way that it can be interchanged with little differentiation from a quite a few of her counterparts. That’s a nature of the production of that genre of music. 

So, in a lot of senses she is in fact rightfully hated by those who want more for pop music. She’s banking on it and the industry rewards her for being the placeholder that’s she is, so maybe the hatred towards her personally isn’t all warranted, but what she represents deserves a lot of the criticism. 

As for the representation of her being more popular amongst twelve year olds, there’s something to that. 

A person that has the ability to think and grow typically has phases of growth where some things they like when they are younger don’t hold the same appeal as they get older. If Ariana Grande holds the minds of twelve year olds primarily then that might be an indication that she’s targeted and tailored to an immature demographic.

As a North American I’ve often wondered about this and I’ve done research on how it works but what I’d really like to know is how does this affect the quality of what you watch? Are there still adverts? Does the government control the content and advertising differently?

I’ve not watched broadcast or cable television since like 2004. I find it incredibly asinine as the ads seem to be engineered to make people stupid(er). Paying for cable or satellite television is even worse because in that case you’re essentially paying them to pipe ads into your home and make you stupid(er). The commercialism *and* advertisements don’t outweigh even some of the good content that’s available. 

I enjoy streaming services and block ads on as many devices as possible, so I think given the option for a state run television service or a streaming I’d choose streaming but I’ve never watched German television.

unpopularopinion,fejdr56,t3_eph2cr,1579169060.0,"What I find most dangerous about stoned drivers is their apprehension to a.) turn right on a red when there’s not an oncoming car for miles, b.) not turning left unless there’s a green arrow (like you need special permission to do something legal) and last but definitely one of the worst, c.) driving 15 mph+ under the posted speed limit. 

I know that chocolope is some serious shit, but just because you’re so stoned that 30 feels like 80 it doesn’t mean you can obstruct traffic. 

The old adage that a stoned driver is more likely to stop at a green light than run a red is true but isn’t always better. It’s just about as dangerous (albeit in a slightly different way) and causes far more issues by impeding traffic while the the high individual is presumably contemplating I don’t know, the meaning of twine or something. 

So I think the only people who think stoned driving is ok driving *have* to be high to think that. (Sorta /s.)

Of course there are TONS of functional stoners who are so familiar with its effects that they drive seemingly ok, and not withstanding the emergency reaction time argument, they’re not typically an impedance to other drivers. But not everyone can handle their weed that well. 

HOWEVER, the bad stoned drivers are sometimes about equally as bad as Lyft and Uber drivers. They might be the worst offenders of the two because in big cities they’re everywhere and they have little to no regard for other drivers and traffic laws. It’s all about getting to the passenger, stopping in traffic to pick it drop off, turning right from the left lane or left from the right...[“human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together – mass hysteria.”](https://youtu.be/JmzuRXLzqKk)

And to be fair, the more automated cars get with more toys and entertainment and the less people have to do related to the task of driving the more likely they’re going to be filling that perceived space with other things that can distract them. Like snap chatting with a cat filter while doing makeup and watching Disney plus and doing sudoku. And it turns into doing anything but driving. That’s kind of the direction of driving as a culture at least in the US. The devil’s lettuce is probably a relatively small contribution to that bigger issue with people driving with heads up their asses. Sometimes it might even be someone else’s head. It definitely is if they stop at a green light."

Shitty_Car_Mods,fee6od0,t1_fed9tb8,1579027510.0,"Music and photography are big parts of what I do as well. But the more I dig into what trends versus the components of what makes beauty the more I think it’s not subjective but a result of a collection of other things: marketing, monopolies and industry. And the objective aesthetics take a back seat to the individual, emotional, and commercial identity the “art” or trend represents. That’s how it becomes subjective. 

People argue that media is a result of public demand when in essence it is dictated by influencers and industry.  As a result trends grow and identity becomes interweaved and kind of take on their own life and economy. While I don’t fully agree with everything Scrunton says in this, there are a lot of valid points in [this documentary](https://youtu.be/bHw4MMEnmpc). Being a photographer I think you might appreciate it. 

Individual taste is subjective but taste can still be criticized as being objectively bad. 

I believe the idea that all aesthetics are subjective is a means by which individual ego can ratify itself as valid in the absence of the critical skill and knowledge to qualitatively assess the historical and contemporary value of art and beauty.

Merely standing by when the general population’s ignorant concept of beauty is the profane equivalent of hoarder’s house and the transcendent quality of beauty is relegated to subjectivity and mislabeled altogether isn’t the right battle to choose when we ourselves are artists as well. 

But this kind of discussion is the kind of debate that allows us to polish these ideas to a point where we can distill and refine these observations. (Thanks for continuing this as it’s been enlightening.) I call them observations because although opinion is inserted, there’s a fair bit of observation. 

People like what they like but it could still be a dumpster fire. Calling that dumpster fire art or beauty is where I draw the line.

For me this is more than an opinion. It’s a working thesis. So I have a lot more vestment behind it than merely laissez-faire where the unregulated economy is that of beauty."

As for some other things you may have missed In that aesthetics aren’t as subjective as we are led to believe as feelings and participation trophies and digital platforms make our egocentric culture believe. Therefore the entire basis of subjectivity and objectivity are what is in question.

But I do think there’s an element of hypocrisy in what you say because you edited your statement to imply that you don’t think there’s any reason for discussion because I’m dug in. But in fact is that not what you did from the beginning? Essentially isn’t the term “okay boomer” just labeling and shutting down discussion? And you did that with your first response. I think it’s admirable you got to here but you don’t really seem to be open to discussion beyond that. (Perhaps I’m wrong.) If you were I think you’d find we may not disagree as much as the emotional response seems to dictate."
Shitty_Car_Mods,fecjdua,t1_fecek81,1578975340.0,"I’ve been thinking about what the most appropriate response to “okay boomer” could be and the best one I can think of so far would be, “whatever, snowflake.”

Relativism in aesthetics comes from the glorification of sensation over function. The identity that comes with what that represents rather than the human tendency to appreciate the aesthetic of the object or the function of the object. 

This is why the fallacy that beauty is in the eye of the beholder doesn’t fully ring true. While aspects of beauty can be somewhat subjective, balance and symmetry based on the function that comes with it are fundamental to why beauty actually matters. And it’s much bigger than that. It’s about the ability to critically think as a result of the being taught the importance and history of aesthetics which is something that has been dying in our culture for a very long time. 

“It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, *that form ever follows function.* This is the law.”

-Louis Sullivan. 

As for opinion, it’s not merely opinion. It’s a fact that balance and symmetry—form, does follow function.

Yeah what makes that thing get off the ground *is* probably grocery bags. Ha! I joke. 

But in reality this is a small factor of a much bigger discussion on life and beauty and function. 

I’m sure on some level there is the possibility of acquiring a taste for this kind of thing, but for many, the lack of function or the ruining of a previously better performing car seems a travesty. *That* is the aspect that might be somewhat subjective because the function that aesthetic provides to someone, that element of joy, is in fact functional. It may drag the belly of that car on the smallest of bumps at its highest of inflations, but it brings someone joy. As for the identity that comes with it being a transcendent investment, that’s another discussion altogether."

These cars do not. And while I’m sure this comment will garner some fanboy hate as it always does when I talk about this topic here, I agree with you for posting this here and applaud your courage to stand up to what is seems to be an awful trend in slamming cars. 

HOWEVER, the slammed community is full of incredibly kind and amazing people and while I respect their enthusiasm, I don’t share their appreciation of these cars and I’ll argue it academically while still being astounded by their passion and willingness to engage in discourse. Because the nice ones make me want to like slammed cars (and the fans can make or break almost anything if you get down to brass tacks). As for the ones that don’t engage in healthy discourse, well, like so many (the ones that will probably downvote this) *they probably just need a hug.*"
