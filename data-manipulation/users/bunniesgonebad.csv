I like to go for a walk for half an hour and listen to a podcast or music, come home and have some coffee, do my makeup and whatnot. As long as you have an actual plan not just ""I'm gonna wake up early and do something"" make it more like ""I'm going to wake up at 6:30, be out the door by 6:45 for a walk and then come home, shower, get ready""

I find if people have vague plans they never actually do anything. You should want to make a schedule to keep you on track and reward yourself for doing so. You're like a dog training itself! I do that for a lot of things like ""hey you actually exercised tonight! NOW you can watch YouTube or reddit or whatever""  know what I mean?"

Maybe a nice mug with some tea, a house robe with cute cat stuff, candles, a journal is a great idea, or even cash!"

fatlogic,ffftakf,t3_etbmyx,1579891328.0,"I'm back to counting and I've been doing fine, staying around 1500 (5'4 135lb) but last night...I'm trying to do more intuitive eating which is definitely working! But last night I had the most ravenous hunger and ate like 1000 calories just at dinner. I was satisfied and not overly full, and I took my time, and did everything *right* but I WAS SO HUNGRY LIKE 3 HOURS LATER WTF BODY?!?! But I also give myself a break cause I'm just ending the red demon plague, BUT STILL I felt awful eating so much in a day (it was like 2000 at the end) and ruining my week but I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.


Frustrating! GAH!"
loseit,fff2p9n,t3_etampp,1579874086.0,"What are your current stats? You may be reaching for too low of a calorie goal. If you're exercising like that you should be aiming for 1500 or so. 1200 is like the bare minimum to keep a 5'4"" body even *functioning* at a sedentary lifestyle. Let's say you're doing HIIT at that height and you weigh 130 lbs. Pretty basic, you would want to be eating 1500."
