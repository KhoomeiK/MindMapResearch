AskReddit,ff0r1w2,t3_eqies2,1579471477.0,"When I was 26 years old I woke up one morning and my brain ""vomited"" a condition called a ""Chronic Anxiety Neurosis"".  I'm of course using the word ""vomited"" not in a literal sense of expelling stomach contents, but in a figurative sense, of expelling a psychological problem that had been in my brain.  The split second I awoke, and became aware of my body on a bed, my brain still had the problem.  But over the next few seconds (roughly 3 seconds) the condition completely vanished.  When it did it felt as if a ""worry-filled worldview"" was unable to construct itself, and instead fell away towards the center of the earth.  Over those 3 seconds it was as if my ""mind's eye"" was a pipe obstructed with mud, but suddenly became cleared of the mud!  I was astonished, and sat up in the bed, then walked to a bathroom and looked at my face in a mirror.  I was stunned by how attractive I looked (in sharp contrast to how my face appeared when I had the neurosis).

I left my apartment and began walking around, and observing people.  It was very obvious that I was experiencing a heightened state of awareness.  That is, I was significantly more awake and aware than other people were.  And a wonderful feeling of pleasure accompanied every sight, sound, smell, etc...  This was a distinctly different state of brain functioning (different from ""ordinary human waking state"") that I had read about in books.  The most notable of these books was *The Master Game*, by Robert S. De Ropp.  De Ropp's book is one of something like 110 similar books by other writers, about an elevated state of brain functioning sought by practitioner's of George Gurdjieff's ""system"" of ideas and physical exercises.

The most amazing feature of this state of brain functioning was this: *I had direct control of my emotions*!  When resting in bed with my eyes closed, I would visualize myself successively hugging people of a long line of people walking up to me, and with each hug saying to the person ""We can work together"".  When doing this visualization I could will into my mind a heavenly wonderful feeling of love for all beings (after doing it for around 20 seconds I would acquire the power to will the feeling of love into my mind).  It was similar to sexual orgasm, but much more intense, and not in my crotch, but *in my head*.  That love was accompanied by joyful excitement about the possibility of relieving suffering of any kind, in any creature, human or non-human.  That excitement was so strong that it seemed like I could, potentially, bear any level of suffering if I knew that my actions would relieve the suffering of some creature.

For me, the second most amazing feature of this heightened state of awareness (called ""self-remembering"" by Gurdjieff students) was the extraordinary power of empathy I possessed when visually observing other humans.  It was as if everyone I looked at was ""naked"", emotionally.  The emotional states of other people were so varied and vividly obvious it was as if people were different colors! (Yellow, Green, Blue, Red...etc...)  I call vividly recall my astonishment the first time I saw someone experiencing a suicidal depression.  It was a fast food worker...a young woman around 16 years old who was dutifully filling small paper sacs with French Fries.  When she moved she appeared to be encased in a ""filmy mental bubble"" of depression!  I could plainly see that all of her movements were a struggle, and that she did not want to live!

I was delighted by the sight of many children, who obviously were care-free compared to the adults around me.  One particular child, a small boy around 5 years old, fascinated me.  I was looking at the front pages of different newspapers displayed at a gas station, in a row of newspaper vending machines.  The boy started playing ""peek-a-boo"" around the sides of the machines.  He was very excited...I believe that he was able to see that I was experiencing a very unusual state of mind.

I possessed this amazing state of brain functioning for approximately another 37 days, interrupted only by nighttime sleep.  When sleeping the only dreams I had were very brief, vivid dreams that lasted only 3 or 4 seconds.

After the first 20 or so days of possessing this state (which I call ""Socially-Bonded Release"": a term I believe is much better than ""Self-Remembering) I lost desire to keep it.  It was too horrifying to see suicidally depressed people.  Even when none were in sight, it was like a faint ""background scream"" was always in the distance.

Perhaps the most amazing ""empathy experience"" I had occurred during a relatively brief, 2-day period of the state, that I had two years later.  I was walking around Washington D.C. at the time, at night.  I encountered a man who was sitting on a sidewalk and acting in a very strange way that showed that he was obviously very distressed.  He was moving his arms in two alternating ways, each lasting around 3 seconds.  One way would be to place his hands down on the sidewalk, as if to steady himself to keep from falling over.  The other way was to vigorously rub his hands across and around his head, as if to brush something very annoying off of his head.  Well, I could literally see exactly what he was trying to brush off of his head.  The was hallucinating 6 or 7 wasp-like insects that were rapidly flying around his head (so close that their legs were probably brushing his short hair).  The poor soul was obviously experiencing ""delirium tremens"" caused by withdrawal from alcohol.

I've described this state of brain functioning to many people over the years (hundreds, I'm sure).  I've yet to encounter anyone else who can testify to having experienced something similar.  Gurdjieff taught that this state is ""in between"" ordinary waking state (what his students call ""waking sleep"") and ""cosmic consciousness"" (IMO most eloquently described in the book *Autobiography of a Yogi*, by Paramahansa Yogananda).  In De Ropp's book, he lists five possible states of brain functioning possible for human beings (from least aware to most aware) as : (1) sleep without dreams, (2) sleep with dreams, (3) ordinary waking state (""waking sleep""), (4) self-remembering (what I call ""Socially-Bonded Release""), and (5) cosmic consciousness.

The remainder of this reddit post is ""the backstory"" of how I ""accidentally"" (more or less) discovered a way to produce the state in myself:

I grew up in a city in Louisiana, USA.  I was very shy with girls, which caused me to acquire the aforementioned ""chronic anxiety neurosis"".  At the root of the shyness problem was an inability to ""make passes at"" females.  The family I grew up with was completely non-affectionate, physically (e.g., the first time I hugged with my parents was when I was 26 years old).  Getting my first kiss was especially difficult.  It happened when I was 18, and according to my memory, it was the first time any part of my head was pressed against any part of another human beings head with the intent of expressing affection (brief touches from football tackles don't count).  Lips-upon-lips kissing is like bicycle riding: a bit tricky at first (tricky to keep a lot of pleasant friction going) but easy once you ""get the hang"" of it.  I'm sure that I would have had little difficulty getting my first kiss if I had had any practice initiated by anyone else.  But expecting someone who has never experienced head-to-head affectionate contact to make their very first ""pass"" is like expecting someone to start their first bicycle ride without training wheels!

Continuing with the story about how I got rid of the neurosis in a way that caused the ""awakening"":

When I was 25 years old I graduated from a University in Louisiana, with a 4-year degree in Computer Science.  I made a decision to express more ""self-reliance"", and as part of that goal I decided to ""throw my life out the window"" and move far away from Louisiana.  I drove my car from Louisiana to California, and rented a hotel room near the center of Los Angeles.  I busily searched for employment, and after three weeks I found a computer programming job I was satisfied with.  It was the first of three similar programming jobs I had over the next 8 months.  The third job was with a small company that made computer games for home computers.  One day at that job (I had been employed by them for about six weeks at the time), while sitting at my desk making code for a computer game, I noticed an amazing feeling of calmness.

That calmness forced me to realize that I was suffering from some kind of mental disorder that causes excessive worry.  I also realized that my many self-reliant actions over the prior 8 months had caused a kind of ""crack in the wall"" of the anxiety problem I had.  It seemed that a complete ""cure"" was within my reach.  I decided to ""amp up"" the apparent cure I had discovered (confronting social fears and in other ways acting very self-reliantly), in the hope of completely ridding my brain of the condition quickly.  With that basic strategy in mind, I started doing many ""nervy"" kinds of things (asking various women for dates, initiating strange-topic conversations with strangers, offering hugs to people, etc...).  The calmness seemed to be growing in my mind, and replacing the anxiety.

The ""purge"" of amped-up self-reliant actions lasted 7 days.  The ""vomiting"" described in the first paragraph of this long post occurred on the morning after the 7th day of the ""purge"".

I am hoping that other people with a ""chronic anxiety neurosis"" who read this will be able to duplicate the ""awakening"" that I described above.  To any such person that succeeds: PLEASE CONTACT ME.  I will pay for plane tickets (whatever is needed) to arrange a meeting.  I believe that someone experiencing the state would be able to ""pull me up into it"" by speaking very rapidly to me while I look steadily at them."

AskReddit,ff076le,t3_eqies2,1579465899.0,"When I was 17 (45 years ago) I lived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana USA.  One summer night around 3 am I had a dream in which a close friend of mine (""Bill"" I'll call him) phoned me ""just to say hello"".   Immediately after Bill said that to me (in the dream), I awoke.  I then sat up in bed with an amazing feeling of certainty that our house phone was going to start ringing and it was going to be Bill calling me ""just to say hello"".  I spoke out loud to myself, saying ""wow...I *know* he is going to call"".  Around ten seconds of silence passed, then our two house phones started ringing.  My mother answered the phone next to my parents bed.  I could hear her talking to someone, then she put the phone down and called out to me ""It's for you."".  I ran to the other of the two house phones (located in a recreation room at the other side of the house) and picked it up.  It was ""Bill"".   I was almost breathless with excitement and could barely talk.  I was trying to tell Bill about the dream and about the feeling of certainty that the phone was going to ring and it was going to be him, but he would not listen. He told me ""I just wanted to say hello"".  I could hear other people talking in the background.  It sounded like a party of guys getting drunk (which made sense because Bill's speech slurred like he had had a few beers).  The call lasted around two minutes, then we said ""goodbye"" to each other and the call was over.

Bill had moved away from Baton Rouge, to Little Rock Arkansas (around 330 miles away from Baton Rouge), seven months earlier.  He did not tell me about the move when it happened, which stung a little bit because we were close friends.  During the seven months between his move and the amazing phone call I had not communicated with him in any way, so I had no ordinary way of knowing that that 3 am call was going to occur.  

I am now 63 years old, and according to my memory that middle-of-the-night call was the only such call I've received in my whole life.  I am also certain that it is the only call I've ever received with the stated purpose of ""just to say hello"" (or any other words to that effect).  It was also the only time in my life that I have had any kind of hunch that a phone was about to ring with someone at the other end wanting to talk to me.  I felt compelled to believe that ESP exists after that phone call."

My eyesight was perfect when I started my freshman year.  Near the middle of my second year, I began to notice that distant things were becoming blurry.  I didn't know what was causing it.  I continued to spend most of my time looking at books and notepads, without doing any kind of eye excercise like what you described.  But please note: I don't mind at all wearing glasses.  Actually, I believe it benefits me.  The blurry distant stuff reminds me every morning to put on my eyeglasses, which serve to both protect my eyes, make me look smart, and help other people like me more (studies have found that when people look at the same face both with and without glasses, they say the with-glasses version looks better).

One (""David"", I'll call him) said, ""Isn't it so crazy the way young guys tease eachother for masturbating when everyone is doing it?""

Everyone laughed, except one guy (""Joe"", I'll call him).  Joe had an obvious look of astonishment on his face!  David saw this, and became very confused, and asked Joe ""What?  You mean, you have never masturbated?""  Joe was speechless.  His silence of course said ""Right...I've never masturbated"".

That is, 100% accuracy would be achieved if the mean (both vertical and horizontal) of the hits were to match the aforementioned single point.  Precision, on the other hand, is how tightly all of a group of shots cluster together.  ""Precision"" does not make sense as an adjective describing a single shot.
