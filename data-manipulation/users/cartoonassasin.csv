We might also take a side trip to the time that 2 New York millionaires competed with each other for the fanciest wrist watch with the most features (called complications by watchmakers) built in. Somewhere along the way that will remind me that prior to the invention of the Chronometer ocean navigation could only use lines of latitude, and not longitude, since there was no reliable way to measure how far west or east you'd sailed. The Chronometer was the first accurate time piece that did not depend upon a pendulum for keeping time, and therefore, it would work on a rocking ship at sea. 


Speaking of pendulums, did you know that if you hang a very heavy weight from a very tall tower, and allow it to drag a point through sand, you can see the rotation of the earth in the marks in the sand. 

Oh, and that whole thing about toilets flushing counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern because of the rotation of the earth is really just bunk. Toilets are just too small to feel the effects. 

Anyway, I soak up information like a sponge, and someone asking me a question is like squeezing that sponge, so that's why I tend to go completely off topic when asked a question. But I generally get back to the subject by the end."
