It has made an impact on my dating. Typically because mine is inoperable thereâ€™s a conversation I have with the SO at the start making sure theyâ€™re aware just what theyâ€™re getting into. Mine could come back and bite me in the arse after all. I already typically make jokes about it with everyone. So people are typically aware.

But yeah I usually sit them down before getting serious.
As youâ€™re well past where I am, Iâ€™d say bring it up in conversation casually or otherwise and in person I recommend. 
Not first date but after it.
Best of luck. :)"
