todayilearned,ffg83yv,t1_ffg4j4m,1579900504.0,Couldn't you just adjust the sensitivity of your scanners/ tracking systems to ignore objects of that size?
CoinBase,ffckgjm,t3_esez1e,1579801366.0,This sub reddit is a ghost town as far as actual employees of coinbase. Just be thankful you don't have any money in the platform and use a more reputable service.
CoinBase,ffck8c9,t3_esc4mw,1579801228.0,"Don't use coinbase, it's trash and their support team is non existent."
CoinBase,ffcjr7l,t1_ffbfikv,1579800942.0,"I'd suggest using bisq or local bitcoin. Find a reputable and reliable person to do business with and stick with only them. Localbtc requires kyc for large amounts and bisq requires no kyc at all. 

Going through any of these large exchanges that accept debit cards and credit cards are not worth the hassle or the headache. I've been waiting 17 days to hear from coinbase support if that tells you anything about them. They'll literally hold your money hostage."
ethtrader,ffcjdhf,t3_esu1u1,1579800711.0,This isn't actually crypto it's essentially loyalty points for their exchange platform that waives fees. It's garbage.
Lastpass,ffc56b8,t1_fano4g4,1579791779.0,"I know this thread is a little old but yesterday in class I tried to install lastpass on brave browser, instead of firefox, and the chrome webstore page just straight up doesn't exist anymore. Links from a google search just 404."
Bitcoin,ffc35t3,t1_ffc0v8m,1579790383.0,You can use a top up debit card that you buy from convenience stores. Obviously a debit card from your bank isn't anonymous.
Bitcoin,ffc0ptw,t1_ffbztlb,1579788561.0,You do realize you can buy a burner phone and activate it with cash right? I still wouldn't touch changelly with a ten foot pole but still.
news,ffc0d11,t1_ffb36iz,1579788286.0,Love me some Cmilk.
todayilearned,ffby85o,t1_ffbuyzh,1579786567.0,"I always wonder, did they get ad revenue from flash games like that back in the day?"
ethereum,ffbwg2h,t1_ffb2ohf,1579785023.0,That's INSANELY steep. The New York Times publishes roughly 150 articles on a weekday. That means you'd have to pay $120 to read everything they posted yesterday. No thanks. A $10 monthly subscription that you can pay for in crypto is fine but paying per article is ludicrous.
Bitcoin,ffbvglb,t1_ffb44je,1579784114.0,More like he's a delusional boomer who read one too many Ayn Rand books in college.
ethtrader,ffbv9zl,t1_ffbuvc6,1579783942.0,No problem. You may also want to open up the developer console [CTRL + SHIFT + I] and view the logs while loading a YouTube or twitch video to see if they give you anymore information. I strongly suspect it has something to do with no script or ad block but can't tell exactly with the info you've given so far.
ethtrader,ffbutev,t1_ffbtyxu,1579783501.0,"You can enable and disable specific shields(adblock settings) for specific sites. You also have the option of disabling brave shield entirely and only using ublock origin. I personally use brave with ublock, privacy badger, noscript, and https everywhere but I don't experience any issues with YouTube or twitch."
MiniPCs,ff8bddg,t1_fdd5vpl,1579671759.0,"I mean its a 2 month old site with no whois look up information selling a single product and using a gmail email address instead of one linked to the domain. If that's not suspicious af to you, you are beyond help."
ethtrader,ff5q57p,t1_ff4upyl,1579605654.0,[This](https://time.com/5388596/billionaires-welfare-bernie-sanders/) is a nice article explaining the problem.
ethtrader,ff4g9tm,t1_ff47c5e,1579562891.0,"I mean if you think wealth inequality is bad now what happens when all the billionaires just put all their money in crypto and have to pay ZERO taxes on the acquisition of wealth. That's a pretty scary thought IMO. It's bad enough how much welfare in tax breaks we give the wealthy in the US, now imagine if they paid no taxes at all."
ethereum,ff4fnhf,t3_ergr9l,1579562471.0,"I mean unless there's something other than getting an airdrop or pay per click motivating people to use Dapps they're all gonna be pretty trash communities. Cent and Steemit are just full to the brim with referral links, click bait articles, and plagarized content from other platforms. Why would I use one of these slow platforms with an extremely small user-base to maybe make a couple extra bucks that I can't even use do to withdrawl limits/fees when I can just use Reddit and invest my money? DeFi is in an okay spot right now but the decentralized gaming and social communities are bloated with absolute trash."
Bitcoin,ff42m9n,t1_ff41o1b,1579554188.0,I mean the gas price for an eth transaction is like 2 cents.
ethtrader,ff418d1,t1_ff3hb0l,1579553333.0,"I'd like to know what evidence you have that it will, ""pump like mad"" if it's officially announced."
todayilearned,ff1qyes,t1_ff1o019,1579484235.0,Terms like conservative and liberal transcend political parties and are much more useful/accurate when discussing American politics IMO.
todayilearned,ff1p9wa,t1_ff1gofl,1579483143.0,Ah yes the ol' liberals destroyed American family values argument. What a beaut.
ethtrader,ff1k5e8,t3_eqt7wa,1579480478.0,There's a lot of information to peruse through there. It's a high level explanation of the cryptocurrency landscape as it relates to game theory.
ethtrader,ff18x46,t3_equn6a,1579476417.0,"Looks like it could be a cool game. I currently only play mycryptoheroes. I've tried some others but most require an initial investment and aren't even actually games. Gods Unchained seems to have a decent following and actually lets you play without having to invest in it, which should be a requirement for these kinds of games tbh if they actually want interest from the public to grow.

Is the game going to permanently be on the testnet or is it going live on the mainnet on release?"
science,fevrzwx,t1_fevqs0z,1579400812.0,The government's views/ policies are separate from its citizens. Japan has anti-immigration policies and criticizing that is criticizing the government. That's not bigoted or racist. It's like saying someone who is against the practices of the Israeli government is an anti-semite. That's just beyond irrational.
ethtrader,fevo58o,t1_fevd0v6,1579399608.0,Similar things have happened at the Canada–United States border where people have been forced to unlock their laptops or cellphones essentially just because the border agents want you to. [This](https://www.straight.com/news/1236821/canada-border-services-agency-officers-confiscate-lawyers-phone-and-laptop-after-he) is one of the more prominent cases I remember. I guess you just give up your rights as a citizen when you cross the border.
CoinBase,fevl5km,t3_eqbloy,1579398720.0,Support is essentially non-existent atm. Lots of people are reporting several week waits to contact support members. All you get is auto-response messages for your ticket and then the case gets closed. Lets hope we hear from them by February.
