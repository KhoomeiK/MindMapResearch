depression,feiuwz3,t1_feiieun,1579147877.0,Reading your reply & the replies in this thread definitely made me feel less alone... yet it made me wonder why us? Why must certain people suffer this while many others live charmed lives? I wish it were different for us all. Wishing you the best in life.

relationships,fdxiuao,t3_ena2pl,1578769141.0,"Your sister is being selfish and controlling. Asking someone to change their appearance to suit your preferences is disrespectful, even if it's for only one day. I know you mentioned that your hair feels like a comfort to you, and I relate with that fully. My hair feels like an important part of my unique identity and if someone tried to make me change it, I would feel personally attacked. Keep those glorious locks."

Do you have any other family members you can stay with? If not, I would suggest getting a camera so you can have proof of him coming in there if he does it again. You have to tell your mom. If she doesn't believe you, then you need to talk to a guidance counselor at school and get authorities involved. You need to get out of there. You don't deserve this."
