insaneparents,ffauwmm,t1_ffat68d,1579745056.0,"Like I said yesterday, fuck you. The comments everyone left on my post yesterday are genuinely helping me heal by seeing I’m not alone. The most I’ve seen someone comment on a story on a mega thread is maybe a couple comments. You’re basically sending my story there to die and be read by no one. Like I said yesterday, fuck you."
stonerfood,ffau3wt,t3_esl0n6,1579744527.0,Holy crap. This just blew my mind. This is the ultimate stoner food.
insaneparents,ff83cws,t1_ff81okr,1579664900.0,"No, my mom is insane and it has nothing to do with the loss of her mom. I’ve been on my own since I was 17 and there’s a reason. The two texts a week are only to either ridicule me for something she saw on social (for example: went away to the mountains two weekends in a row, and said she’s not surprised I don’t have any friends and that I need to grow up) or to ask me to yell at my younger sister for “turning into” a bitch like me. Years of physical and mental abuse and I use this subreddit as a safe haven for all of my bottled up rage I have from growing up with such a spiteful bitch. 

Granted I didn’t include these details in the post, but in a sub like r/insaneparents, if you’re going to assume something I’d bet on it being an insane parent."

insaneparents,ff7ux9p,t1_ff7ulsr,1579658953.0,You have no idea what your words just did to me. I immediately started crying after I read sugar cube and man did I need to hear what you just told me. You are so warm and comforting and my real mom is a robot and you are so wonderful thank you so much

insaneparents,ff7eznw,t1_ff7ehec,1579648016.0,I’m okay. I can’t stop crying and honestly I can’t decipher if it’s because my meme or the realization that my mom truly does hate me enough to do this
insaneparents,ff79ejz,t1_ff78zzy,1579643800.0,It’s tomorrow morning apparently. I live ten hours away and tomorrow is my first day of work after being laid off two months.

cats,fdkr3xi,t1_fdkbfvb,1578509405.0,"My cat did this for the first time today: as I was going from my bed to leave the room, she looked up (from about the midway point, a little to the side) and sniffed at me constantly until I left the room. It was so weird but it was so damn cute. This video is so damn cute as well. Cats are amazing."

insaneparents,fckcncf,t1_fckcdlk,1577722335.0,"Joined! Thank you. Honestly I think this subreddit is the most wholesome. It’s like we are all on a team together, existing with insane parent(s), and helping each other through it. OR maybe it’s just a place where insaneparents get triggered and get banned lol."
insaneparents,fck96s9,t1_fck5qwo,1577719970.0,"Same. I live 1000 miles away for a reason. They can see my hypothetical babies when they visit, but if my mom pulls the “if you move here life will be easier” bs she is trying to do with my other brother, there’s no fucking chance."
insaneparents,fck2vig,t1_fck0di1,1577714946.0,"Same here. It’s taken me so long to realize everyone else was allowed to have flaws but if I did something wrong, everyone had an opinion and wanted to scold me. We were at a theme park recently, my first time back home in two years so mom took us. My oldest brother (32) who still lived at home and was just fired from his sixth job in a row just pushed my 11 year old brother to the ground because he wanted to be in the front row not the back. My mom literally just stood by, not saying anything. When I called my brother an asshole, and grabbed my little brother, my mom told me to stop being such a bitch. Later in the day, when said little brother said he missed his dog more than I missed my cats, I told him it wasn’t a contest and we all love our pets. My mom stopped walking, looked at me, and asked why I was such a hateful person. 

That’s like every day with my mom. I’m 25 and I still am trying to work through un-rationalizing those behaviors and figuring out why I am the way I am. One thing I know is once I do have babies, I know exactly how not to treat them. And I don’t want my mom anywhere near them."
