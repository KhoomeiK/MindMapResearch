UnresolvedMysteries,fempznj,t1_femfdx0,1579266175.0,"Anyone can get addicted and completed hide it from even the closest family members.  I woke up in the back of an ambulance and when I got to the hospital my mother who I had loved with for years while using had no idea.  The only people the knew were my girlfriend I was living with and who was helping me get sober, her family and my brother-in-law who I worked for in construction and dealt with addiction a lot in the work place.   And he only noticed one hoiliday, I was acting a little weird.  

My girlfriend only knew for sure because I showed her my marks, although she had an idea.  

I was a nerd of a different sort, although I was a partier back in the day I rarely drank and didn't smoke because it gave me anxiety.  I did my drug of choice because of undiagnosed bipolar, and social anxiety but I had learned to hide it all very well, which unfotunately hindered me more.  

I would absolutely not have been unheard of for me to ask to leave earlier or something similar and maybe try to get a week off to cold turkey myself to sobriety.  

Usually I just ended up not showing up to work if I couldnt get a fix.  

I don't know if I believe the drug angle but we should never deny the drug angle or mental illness because a person doesn't fit our idea.  Everyone who met me after my incident would exclaim, ""I had no idea you were ever into that.  You always looked great and clean cut.""

Just like families and not accepting suicidd, I see a lot of incidents on here that remind me so much of drug use related but it's given little thought.

Such as the brother that disappears while on the phone with his brother and a cop and he's really paranoid, running through the woods.  My first thought was meth but everyone had a conspiracy theory, until last year it comes out from the brother he was on meth.
