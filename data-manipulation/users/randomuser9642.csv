fatlogic,fffelgs,t1_fffd87r,1579882266.0,"> I just don't buy that there's not a single form of exercise that is out there for someone to enjoy. 

I can easily believe that. especially if you're morbidly obese. When everything hurts, and everything hurts more when you move, let alone exercise, of course it won't be fun.

I don't particularly enjoy doing laundry. It would be great if I could find a way of doing it that I'd consider enjoyable, but I don't think it's out there, I really don't.

But between just doing it, and spending the rest of my life wearing dirty clothes, it's an easy choice to make, isn't it?

Exercise gets easier; it's not all the same and there might be something left to be discovered that could be fun. But even if none of that makes a difference - so what?"

RagenChastain,ffa6zjm,t1_ff8soeh,1579729098.0,"yes, she does. And all of it is beyond pathetic - she admits to not making any progress, so she simply doesn't need a coach. At best, she would need a different coach. It could always just be a bad fit, but the combination of Ragen and coach Steve fails to deliver results.

This is on another level, though. Somehow I doubt that a doctor would discuss the possibilities of going back to her full training regimen with Ragen and consider her an equal in that conversation.

Not only would the doctor not be delusional about the amount of training Ragen could possibly be doing, he would actually be able and qualified to diagnose her and her abilities to exercise. Without being snarky - she can't claim the same for herself. Nobody could.

Nobody that isn't a doctor could do that. None of us would get to agree, or disagree, with that assessment the way she makes it sound. We can trust or distrust our doctors; we can feel well enough (or pain-free enough) to try and ramp up our training volume. But we cannot form an educated opinion on the projected progress of our recovery. How could we?"

The audacity. Because clearly Ragen is the equal of a medical practitioner with a license to practice, a degree, and all that jazz. It's lucky they both reached the same conclusion, isn't it?

>My goal is to get my IronFat event done by the end of May for several reasons:

You're tired of making up little stories about a discipline you know nothing about?

You're tired of reality biting you in the ass time and time again for trying to achieve big or small athletic feats with zero training or preparation?

You really wanted to gain fame or at least notoriety as the fat athlete, and you kept failing at that?

1. I want to do it before it gets too hot. Heat is my enemy. I would  have preferred to do it in March but there’s no way I’ll be ready in  time so I’ll hope for a cool day in May.

The last post had you admit that the various obstacles that presented themselves on your ""journey"" kept reducing your fitness to zero. Just how do you reckon you will get ready for your next attempt faster than you had planned ever before?

(Of course, you've always claimed that you could easily cover the distance, I guess...)

>2. I may have a little speaking tour coming up in Portland in June and  I’d like to have this behind me when I go so I don’t have to worry about  training and such.

Or even you don't think you can keep selling the idea of ""working towards an IM"" to your audience unless you actually complete something?

How about a sub-60-minute 5k fun run? No cheating.

>3. OMG am I so very ready to be done with this.

I have good news for you: You're done. If you ever even started.

>That said, based on all the unknowns,  I’m going to see how it goes before I set a final date.

what ""unknowns""? I am sure you have diagnosed yourself perfectly well; and everything else should be straight forward by now. You have dropped the tome constraints on your event. If speed was really everything you ever struggled with, you should have a really good idea of what you will be capable off, and how long it should take you to build up - again - to your peak performance levels. Remember? You can allegedly do the distances no problem.

Regular reminder that you entered the half IM claiming you were good enough to make the cut off times, too...

>We’re going to ease back into it a bit and then build the mileage that I  need. I’ve been allowed to do things slow walking and light weight  lifting and such, but nothing that might strain or irritate my neck –  every time I tried it set my rehab back. So I haven’t been really  training since September.

Oh, now you have been ""allowed""? Whatever happened to ""agreeing"" on all of this?

In the same spirit, I would like to ask who makes up the ""we"" that are going to ease back into the training?

>Today was a short walk (Short as in, it may have taken my GPS watch –  nickname: Old Unreliable –  longer to find the satellites than it took  me to complete this walk.) Good news – my neck feels fine. Bad news – to  say that I am out of shape would be vastly understating it. Getting  from where I am today to where I  need to be to complete the event in  May is going to be a challenge.

This is outright pathetic on so many levels. Mostly because no sane person with a modicum of training experience would use their recovery training to gauge their competition readiness.

You are not allowed to do a full workout, and yet your little walk is enough to demonstrate that you're nowhere near fit enough to be ready to.... oh, I nearly said something like ""race"" or ""compete"" there."
fatlogic,ff2n7ab,t1_ff2argk,1579514404.0,"I think I saw somewhere that 20 minutes of moderate cardio was good enough to max out a single, specific health marker.

Watch as they turn this into ""20 minutes is all you need for everything"", and go from ""workout"" to ""move your body until your breathing is moderately elevated"". I am disappointed that there is no reminder that the movement should be done joyfully.

I tried to Google it, but all I can find are recommendations of 20 minutes of vigorous exercise, or 30 minutes of moderate exercise *daily*."

fatlogic,fedgrtf,t1_feddufa,1579011103.0,"> They can also be judgement of, you know, *quality*. 

But that's not what's happening when people talk about bad foods, either.

There is high quality vodka, there are amazing cheeseburgers, and there is great chocolate pudding.

You can have under-cooked potatoes, cold vegetable soup or bland stew.

You know, *quality*.

The context here is to look at the nutritional make up of individual foods, and concluding that it is always bad to include any of those in someone's diet.

No, cheeseburgers aren't ""bad"". There is absolutely no reason - as far as nutrition is concerned - why a healthy person shouldn't have cheeseburgers as part of their diet. (Because they aren't poisonous, basically.)

Of course you could have too many cheeseburgers - but that's true for absolutely every other food, too. Or someone could eat nothing but cheeseburgers, and that would be bad - but that's probably true for every other dish as well, unless it was specifically designed to be perfectly balanced, nutrients wise. (And I've said it before: That might just be possible for a very weird and specific cheeseburger, too.)"
fatlogic,fed5pm7,t3_eogue0,1579000167.0,"I wish it would connect the dots a little more.

You could go on a fad diet until you've lost what you wanted to lose. Only then do you need to find something  sustainable at 1200 or 1600 or whatever kcal for the rest of your life. But you can stop living off of cabbage soup.

It would be quicker, but takes even more discipline - and going too low is not going to be healthy, either."
RagenChastain,fed4gqe,t1_febf2m3,1578998376.0,"Two not entirely sober assholes decide that going out for a joy ride and throwing eggs at strangers would be outright hilarious. Ragen just so happens to be their final target, so she gets the last two eggs and the cartoon for good measure.

Over in /r/running you'll occasionally see runners telling stories of having stuff thrown at them from passing cars. So, it happens.

And it could have happened to Ragen; even at 2am.

As a FA activist, she would explain to us that this is what society does to fat people; and how everybody is out to get her.

A sociologist might well ask ""what the fuck is wrong with people?""

As a comedian, she did fine: Never mind any of that. HOW COULD YOU MISS? What about the other eggs?"
RagenChastain,fe5a6eh,t1_fe43lr0,1578866953.0,"She's a long away from her first Netflix special, nobody will let her roast people on national TV anytime soon, either. I may be biased because I expected it to be much worse.

But for a first time, amateur stand-up, I think she did will.

I say that, however, ignoring what I know about her and her HAES stance. I know she ain't training for an Ironman, I know she never ran a Marathon, and I know the story of having eggs thrown at her probably never happened. I also know that that story, true or not, is usually told to make a political point.

Ignoring all that, the act itself was okay.
