docker,ffv8iyj,t3_eve7z7,1580258219.0,"1. Don't try everything all at once. Work on the databases last as they are generally the hardest.

2. You can use a volume map to store files that need to be edited. Alternatively you can directly replace or edit files in a container via docker exec commands but this is not a good production method. 

3. There's several ways to skin a cat. You can include all the files needed for the containers at build and any change involves a new build and deploy (this is considered the best usually). Or you can mount files in a volume and reload the container as needed. With nginx you can even gracefully switch to a new config without even restarting a container using a -s HUP in a docker exec. But it's probably better to put them behind a proxy and reload containers.

4. There are shortcuts for containers to reference each other using DNS. Localhost.docker.internal for example will reference the host up from inside a container.

5. Check out docker compose and some examples folks have already built. No doubt you'll see some nginx-Cassandra examples."

docker,ffa340h,t1_ff9v6e5,1579726925.0,"Swarm used to be recommended for an easier lighter version of kubernetes but due to the announcement that it will no longer be developed, it's no longer recommended. It sounds to me like docker compose would be the best solution in your situation. It allows you to launch multiple containers and specify all the necessary volumes, networking, and parameters necessary in one go. Then you can docker-compose up or down to bring the stack up or down as needed. One disadvantage I haven't seen a solution to is that there's no good way to update one piece of the stack without cycling the whole stack.

You can in theory split up the pieces but I've had issues with multiple compose stacks communicating with each other or standalone containers due to the way they set up networking. No doubt there's a solution but I haven't had a chance to work it out.

Reverse proxies are easy to implement in a container and the traeffik or jwilder nginx solutions are both good options. Haproxy is a good solution as well but has less of the automation unless you're using the ingress controller.

If you haven't seen the hashicorp tools (terraform, vagrant, vault, consul, etc), take a look at those. I've seen folks talk about using consul and nomad to control their stacks. You could set up automation with a CI/CD tool like teamcity, octopus deploy, circleci, or Jenkins as well. Check ins of yaml to a VCS can trigger deployment events."
dataisbeautiful,ff9v7q6,t3_esc6vh,1579722203.0,So what caused all the individual fires to start?
docker,ff9u9kz,t3_esf4qr,1579721463.0,"Yeah, this is a misunderstanding of Docker. No worries, it's a common misconception. Getting past the ""a container is the same as a VM"" stage is a phase we all go through. There's several things you've missed:

A container is NOT the same as a VM: yes it often looks that way because we have containers with all the files and configurations of a full OS but a container doesn't need to be that way. It is actually possible to have an assembly compiled application in a container with no additional OS files. This is because a container is not a full OS. It leverages the kernel of the host and does NOT run it's own. The reason we have all the extra OS files in a container is because most applications are built with dependencies on those. The app can't leverage files from the host, just the kernel, so we bring those along. This is by design so that you can have them different for each container. Your app may prefer a different version of library or a whole different library. This allows multiple infrastructure incompatible applications to run on the same host. Because a container leverages the host kernel, the resource demands should be less for a container than a VM as none of the drivers and so forth need to be loaded again. The security impacts are also different as a container has more access to the host.

Containers win at scale. The major advantages of containers come from their ephemeral nature. Managing VMs takes more effort per system than containers as you need to IP them and manage them independently and directly. A container will pull networking automatically and can be updated with a redeployment without being directly patched. Combine this with kubernetes and now a yaml edit from v22 to v23 means all your systems are patched for this month with basically no effort. Additionally when you scale up the amount of running applications, you increment the quantity in a yaml without having to spin up the VMs. You might argue about automation but I assure you that editing a yaml will always be quicker, easier, and better than ansible, etc. Each bit of kernel overhead you're saving by running containers instead of VMs also adds up at scale.

Ephemeral means easy set up and clean up. A developer can docker run nginx -p 80:8080 quicker and easier than they can install nginx and set it up for port 8080. They can also remove it quicker. Any time an application breaks, you can redeploy it faster and better than uninstalling and reinstalling. While yes some things take extra config to set up due to a container, your average application on docker hub has the most common configurations available by default or with basic parameters. In many cases this actually makes it easier than the normal installation for that app. You're experiencing extra heartache because you're not running anything at scale yet so the benefits are at the low end. Some of the things you mentioned like a reverse proxy can be one time costs when using an ingress in kubernetes and each additional application gets automatically added to the RP (depending on set up, traeffik and lets encrypt make things pretty easy).

In the end however, each environment is different and you may not see benefits for what you're doing. You'll need to assess for yourself if containers are right for you. Sometimes the hot tech is a bad fit. Hope this helped, best of luck!"
