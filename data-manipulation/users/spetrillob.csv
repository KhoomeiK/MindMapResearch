socialanxiety,ffh4bv1,t3_etjmvr,1579922754.0,"We’re constantly surrounded by the same people every day in high school, most of whom we had known since elementary, so it’s easier to make friends. Unless you live on campus, are active in school activities, or are just a social butterfly, you’re not likely to make many friends in college. I had a few acquaintances in college, but never any friendships. I’m hoping I can change that as I enter the “real” world"

I graduated from college last spring and I’ve been looking for a job, but it’s difficult because I’m not normal. I don’t want to pretend to be something I’m not to earn a living. That isn’t living. I had to pretend all through school and I’m tired. I may have a job soon, but I still have to depend on others to see my potential before I’m hired. I’m not going to try to stifle myself anymore, though. If it’s meant to be then it’s meant to be and they won’t mind that I’m so different."

Is your desired career path dependent upon a college degree? If so, perhaps it is worth it. But if you're happier not in college and you're happy with what you're doing in life, then don't go next semester.

It's their loss, not yours. Maybe use this time to find a path that gives you meaning in spite of your occupation. I believe that there's reason in everything and maybe this is the Universe's way of telling you that you don't need to be there anymore and that you need to do something that caters to you. What's ""normal"" isn't always better. Remember that. Our empathy makes us unique and a valuable asset in this cruel world, and there are many people and animals and living beings around us that need people like us to understand them."

It destroys the child within us while weâ€™re still children, and we either succumb to the destruction or learn to find that inner child again.
