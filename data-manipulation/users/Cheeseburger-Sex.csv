Cyberpunk,ff9d5rz,t3_es85ht,1579710387.0,This current technology is gonna look so primitive compared to the shit that's gonna be made in the coming years. Can't wait for advanced prosthetics to be a norm
AskReddit,ff5z5xo,t3_ertv7o,1579614892.0,"In the grand scheme of things, we're still very primal and young in our species' lifespan. I mean, the United States isn't even 250 years old and we only JUST got the internet a few decades ago. We're still very animalistic and still carry bullshit traditions and ideologies and can be very aggressive when it comes to confrontation. I guarantee at the first sighting of an alien ship itll get blown to shreds by trigger happy military.

If I was from another planet and saw how our species interacted with one another I would stay far-the-fuck away"

AskReddit,few24ru,t3_eqies2,1579404423.0,"Probably too late to get noticed at this point, but rather often I'll be doing whatever and out of nowhere get an impulse to check my phone and not a few seconds later will I receive a text from someone. 

I remember reading something a while back about how some people have a sense that allows them to unconsciously pick up on the signal your phone receives when a text is about to come in, which is what that ""I should check my phone"" impulse is. Not sure how credible that is tho cause I can't remember where I read it."

thewalkingdead,fe4sjie,t3_enso2u,1578862343.0,"I think even if Shane backed down out in that field, he wouldve killed Rick later because honestly, Rick was an idiot in the beginning of the apocalypse. He was stuck being the good guy, and killing Shane is what changed him and made him the great leader we knew him to be. If he never killed Shane, he wouldve kept making the wrong calls and Shane wouldve killed him or his own decisions wouldve led to his own death."

thewalkingdead,fdyyosm,t3_en7hpo,1578784878.0,"I forgot who said it, maybe Gimple? But I remember the idea of a ""What if?"" Walking Dead series floating around, so maybe that's what this is about?

thewalkingdead,fdq9nb6,t1_fdpdet5,1578660366.0,"Personally I think the difference there is that regardless of the reboot, FTWD was always gonna turn to shit with those new showrunners. I think with Angela Kang behind the helm of the main show, there's a chance that she could do it right"
thewalkingdead,fdlh6me,t3_elupfv,1578523935.0,"My guess is that as the communities grow and become larger (especially with the Commonwealth), the show is eventually just going to be a crime show set post-apocalypse. Like NCIS but with zombies."
