I feel that's reasonable and if you don't then quite frankly I don't care."
AskReddit,fegf6k9,t1_fegcprg,1579090687.0,"But one of those things goes against a clear convention. The convention is that those who adopt the male or female gender are, by an overwhelming majority, genetically male or female. There's nothing wrong with breaking the convention, of course, but if you're going to break the convention other people should know you're breaking it... because that's how conventions work. They're allowed assumptions so we don't have to waste a lot of time mentionning something that isn't an issue for the overwhelming majority of people.     
     
In my mind it's a bit like ISO standards. There's a standard there, most people use and are comfortable with (I.E. by sheer numbers most biologically male humans identify as male- that's not discrimination, that's just how people are... just like the vast majority of countries in the world have adopted the metric system). If some people don't want to/can't follow the standard then that's fine but it's perfectly reasonable to assume the standard has been followed unless otherwise indicated.     
     
Being Trans is perfectly fine, of course, as long as you _don't_ keep it to yourself _when it's relevant_ (so for example, when I'm working with you as a colleage= irrelevant; when I'm thinking of potentially having kids one day, or even when I'm just deciding where to put _my_ genitals- because I also have a right or two _myself_ in that regard...= it's relevant!)...      
     
So I'd say if you're not following the convention and you don't say when relevant that _is_ a lie of omission... because that's how conventions work by definition.     
     
FYI: Although I have no hangups about people being Trans and if someone said to me early on in a relationship that they _were_ I think my reaction would be a polite and respectful ""thankyou for being honest but it's not for me, I'm afraid""... having said that...  using the imperial system of measurements is unacceptable in all circumstances... piss off with your inches and your pounds."

AskReddit,fe7dxnq,t1_fe5xgp3,1578913282.0,"It's technically a vapour: When you compress it enough and it is at a temperature below what is known as it's _""critical temperature""_ it will condense into liquid.      
     
What is critical temperature, I hear you ask? Well... the critical temperature is the temperature above which no amount of compression will make the gas form a liquid. I could apply pressure all day and it would remain a gas.      
     
... I mean if you get to ""heart of a star"" type compression then I'm sure some crazy shit probably happens, but for our purposes this is true.     
     
I seem to remember that the critical temperature of Nitrous Oxide is around body temperature... _checks wikipedia_ ... yeah it's 36.5 celsius. So unless you warm it in your bathroom it's a vapour when it comes out of your  imaginary tap. If you had a high enough pressure tap (thought 44 bar but google thinks 52 at room temp) then you could probably keep it liquid in the majority of the length of the pipe. We tend not to do this in cylinders (as in fill them completely or near completely with liquid nitrous) because if the temperature varies a lot you'd get massive swings in pressure and tanks are at risk of exploding- which isn't good. If you were ballsy enough to do this in your ta you'd really  want to be careful with the temperature of that room, though because if you leave your heating on the tap might explode.     
     
Edit: Source- I am Anaesthetist and we are required to know shit about the drugs and vapours we use (in addition to a load of other random shit, apparently- it's a ballache to learn but it allows me to show off like a know-it-all arsehole from time to time).

askscience,fduj72g,t1_fdrcq1e,1578733892.0,"Well I did spend some time thinking about that... and I have a solution. I think... this is based off nothing but school knowledge of Newtonian physics and my extensive Kerbal space program experience... but I think the trick is to not have the the cheese flying headlong into the ISS.    
         
My thinking is as follows     
-The ISS also moves at orbital velocity relative to the earth (27600km/hr according to google).       
-If my cheese is traveling at... i dunno...  27601km/h relative to the earth IN THE SAME DIRECTION as the ISS then it's speed relative to the ISS would be +1km/h... I.E. it would eventually catch up the ISS from behind- but slowly.      
-I could also propel the cheese at 27599km/h, which would cause the the cheeae to travel at -1km/hr relative to the ISS... which would then catch the cheese up and hit it at 1km/hr.     
       
I'd have to get my cheese at the right altitude to start with to allow the orbit to get higher or decay in line with the velocity difference. Also: depending on where the cheese entered orbit relative to the surface of the Earth/ISS it might take a while, at 1km/hr, to hit. This also  might not give the intended satisfying ""thwack,"" but I wouldn't have thought it would cause obliteration.     
     
Note also that the proposed cheese is a camembert, one of the softest cheeses. I don't want to go softer because then you're entering ""splat"" rather than ""thwack"" territory. Harder (say a large parmesan) is likely to bounce off or cause more damage if the velocity is off a bit. You certainly  don't want to use Stilton as that will probably eat  through the side of the ISS, causing loss of pressure and the ultimate demise of the astronauts/cosmonauts inside.       
      
I'm not saying it'd be easy but if they can land a probe on a comet I'm sure they can lightly hit the ISS with a bit of cheese."
