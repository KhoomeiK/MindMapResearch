craftsman113,ff6xl01,t1_ff6ep6d,1579636962.0,Thanks for the detailed response. That looks like a pretty decent dust solution. Sealing up the back is always tricky because you want to be able to tilt the arbor. I haven’t found a great fix for that yet.
craftsman113,ff4w09k,t1_ff4k0h9,1579573785.0,Can you talk about the dust collection?  What is the “hopper”?  It looks almost like a drywall texture hopper. Looks pretty slick whatever it is.
Christianity,ff2dcek,t1_ff1pb4s,1579501561.0,"As a carpenter I see this so much differently.  A church that can provide the opportunity for trades people to be part of creating memorable worship space is giving more than just wages to the workers, but is giving them the blessing of being part of something much larger and inspiring than they are ordinarily able to be part of. I have had the great fortune to have worked in a number of ornate churches and it is one of the most spiritually fulfilling experiences for me personally. While restoring and maintaining worship space I feel in the closest communion with both the laborers of the past and worshippers yet to experience the beauty of the church."
craftsman113,fep7b3j,t3_eq6dk1,1579313747.0,"CAUTION  The following fix is not recommended, but it did keep my saw going for quite a while. I had a similar break in the same spot.  I tried JB Weld which was worthless. Then I tried regular 5 minute epoxy but wrapped some plumbers tape (metal with holes) around it and put a nut and bolt on to tighten it. Think kind of like a hose clamp.  The strap went right around the sort of heart/triangle part and the bolt was along the flat part at the top.

If you were going to attempt that then get the strap and bolt/nut all worked out before opening the epoxy. Also, get the steel dowels that go in the holes where you want them because you probably don’t want to mess with adjusting them with a rickety repair like this one holding it together. 

I realized writing this that I made that repair more than two years ago and I still use my saw every day."

They are really just letting the club turn into a shit hole. I would consider reporting the issue to local law enforcement or Health and Safety. I know having police around is not great for business but you should call someone - you can probably do it anonymously. I’m sure you put up with enough customer’s shit as it is, you don’t need to put up with any dog’s."
craftsman113,femyzas,t3_epvuwj,1579273191.0,"If everything is in working order I say it is a good deal. The fence is magnitudes better than the old stock fences. I don’t love the cast iron wings - they are heavy and reportedly tend to warp, but no big deal. You could swap them out for stamped steel sometime if you want.   The giant “3HP” on the front is a little deceiving. It probably has a 1 1/2 HP motor at most, but that is fine.

Apple Valley was established by people who wanted a specifically sport area (personally I have zero interest in it) so that’s the local ethic, and it is on land that does not have the same restrictions as somewhere like JT."

SweatyPalms,feessxf,t1_fee5xg7,1579040447.0,Pretty much the only time climbing ropes fail is when they get abraded or cut through from a sharp edge. Weighting a rope over an edge and moving around on it at the same spot is the best possible way to cut through it.
Louisville,feehmwz,t1_fedvqke,1579033932.0,"The guy is absolutely right. Anyone can sign a legal contract with another party stating that you agree to do such-and-such, even if the things you agree to are protected by law.

LifeProTips,fdwacqu,t1_fdu2lcl,1578756703.0,"I have slept in these things more than once in different situations. 

This is right. 

An important factor I have not seen mentioned is that the Mylar bags or sheets are a “vapor barrier.”  This means they will keep moisture from getting in but more importantly they keep the moisture your body produces from going OUT.  Your body releases moisture, especially your exhaled breath, and this will make the inside of the Mylar bag much wetter than most people expect. More than one person I have spent the night with thought they either spilled their drinking water or peed the bed. It can be uncomfortable but the important thing is that if you are wearing insulating layers under the Mylar they will get wet, collapse and provide little or no insulation. 

The best way to use the bag is to take ALL your clothes off. Wearing light underwear is okay. Definitely don’t wear fleece, down, cotton hoodies, or a sleeping bag liner or blanket under the Mylar. Put your insulated body in the sack, then put insulating layers over that. 

You will feel wet and uncomfortable in the bag but will have the best chance of using the bag for survival."

LifeProTips,fcuf5gu,t1_fcuaqyw,1577979466.0,"My experience is different. I was arrested and went to jail because I was very courteous (as I have always been) and told the truth to a police officer, while someone else told the officer “his version” of what happened. 

This cost me thousands of dollars in bail and legal fees that can never be recouped.  After the incident my police friends asked why I talked to a cop? “Never talk to cops!” they said. 

If a police officer is involved in a use-of-force incident they are recommended to wait two sleep cycles before recording the incident so as not to be in an adrenalized state (among other reasons.) But citizens are expected to “talk to the cops” right away and have whatever they say in an adrenalized, injured, terrified, or otherwise not-normal state used against them.

I am in no way “anti-cop” and have a number of law enforcement friends but the advice to “just talk to the police and tell them the truth” is bad advice for citizen."

I love finding number letter combinations that appear to make sense like one recently that had a random “5SIX7” in it. Words spelled randomly in the characters are awesome. When I see a good one sometimes I take a picture, like one recently had “CAR” in the plate.
