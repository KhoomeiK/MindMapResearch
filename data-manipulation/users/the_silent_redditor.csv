tifu,ff9a4ga,t1_ff8pgnt,1579708315.0,"> call a chiropractor

The good part about chiropractors is.. physiotherapy. 

The bad part is when they come to my department with a vertebral artery dissection after [ridiculous manipulations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/eh0ke5/chiropractics_at_its_finest/)

Or when an [elderly man is killed after his neck is broken mid-session.](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-50397867) By the way, this lady is still working and still referring to herself as ‘doctor’, despite not having qualifications. The family of this old guy asked that the term doctor be protected from chiropractors, as he thought he was seeking help from a medical professional and not a charlatan in a white coat.    

[Lots of recorded deaths and paralysis as a direct result.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20642715)

Or when [even those in the ‘profession’](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/i115h/iama_chiropractic_assistant_for_two_years_and/) admit its all bullshit. 

[Or the fact it has roots in a fucking ghost story.](https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-chiropractic-quackery-20170630-story.html)

They are snake oil salesmen. They use [pseudo-medical jargon - what this guy is saying makes ZERO sense medically -](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oeQY5kyIAkI&t=9m) with  the exact aim to baffle people into a false sense of legitimacy. 

They are, at best, completely misguided on how to help people, and in doing so end up causing more harm than good. Realistically, I think most know *exactly* what they are doing: practicing something disguised as some quackery-form of medicine with the only intent of shafting people for as much money as possible. 

There is basically no evidence for it, other than the benefits of physiotherapy. 

They are not doctors. Don’t let them do anything to you. You wouldn’t let a plumber carry out dental work, or a carpenter fix your computer; these people have absolutely **zero** medical training and are **completely** unqualified to give any form of any medical diagnosis or treatment in any person. 

Do yourself a favour and see an actual doctor and then a physiotherapist.

[BONUS video of the same dipshit chiropractor](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FUojAWqKEok&t=12m40s) using a ‘high-velocity, low amplitude adjusting instrument’ to put a patient in a ‘mirror image of the current biomechanical configuration’. He talks about how he can adjust the atlas to ‘send information to the cerebellum’; anyone with a whiff of anatomical/physiological understanding knows that the atlas is a bone, and bones cannot send any information anywhere. The fact that people actually look at such ridiculous things with any hint of seriousness is beyond me.. much less pay these people to deliver their evidence-less nonsense.

**TL; DR: Do not call a chiropractor.**"
