college,fek8l6a,t1_fej3wb5,1579194866.0,"I highly disagree with you on this one. Although I do agree with the prospect that you should only go to college IF IN FACT you actually want to exceed and do well academically rather than simply party and binge drink, that doesn't mean that you can't have a bit of fun all the while. You definitely should socialize with others in college because the fact of the matter is that networking plays a BIG role in adult life, especially once you graduate from college and have to find a job. Even as a very good student, I can tell you with confidence that college isn't supposed to be a miserable experience in which you simply have to earn a degree."
college,fe57vwr,t3_ennr3x,1578866387.0,"I currently go to a relatively small and (dare I say it) mediocre college in the New York City metropolitan area. I live with my mother and we are practically poor, but I'm also a very good student and I worked very hard in high school so I could now attend college on a full ride. Although I don't attend the college of my choice, I do have certain prospects given that the college that I go to is small and below my own standards. That being said, I'm in the top ten percent of my entire class as far as academic performance is concerned. However, most Americans just take out student loans or simply work so as to basically pay for college. Many students also depend on financial aid and scholarships to pay for a portion of their tuition. Personally, I am trying my very best to avoid student loans since you actually cannot file for bankruptcy on student loans in the U.S. Student loans are almost like a cancer here."
college,fe4jyyc,t3_enj55m,1578860146.0,"I just started college last year and it's insane how fast time is just flying by now. I don't really like the school that I go to either, but I'm just trying to grind it out and make the most of what I have right now. Hopefully things will improve since I don't have very many friends in college, whereas I was having such a blast in high school."
