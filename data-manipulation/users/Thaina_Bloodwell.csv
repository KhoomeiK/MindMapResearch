metro,feteqtt,t1_feta4zt,1579374676.0,"It's realistic because you can die easy, but the enemies can be easily killed as well (talking about humans with gunfire or stealth). So in the same way you can kill them with a few shots (or only a single one) they also can kill you that easy if you get spotted."

Killingfloor_2,feknqo9,t3_ehv5t3,1579203870.0,The most important advice for a firebug: don't ever even think attacking Scrakes and Fleshpounds with incendiary weapons... they will become enraged and start doing more damage against you and your teammates!! Just attack them in special emergency occasions or when you are the last player alive in the match.
occult,fekku2s,t1_fekkm6n,1579202140.0,Thank you so much for the support :3
Vampire,fekknzp,t3_eoqmme,1579202039.0,"For your description I only remember the second one... it's the scene of the vampire Jan Valek killing everyone in the hunter party from the movie ***John Carpenter's Vampires, 1998.***"

occult,fekhvz8,t1_fekhoit,1579200381.0,I love this movie and banner too :3 really good.
callofcthulhu,fekhmnb,t1_fekg7ef,1579200224.0,"I will play this game.. actually I'm waiting it to come to Steam, then I'll buy it. I like FPS games so I think I'll like the game."
occult,fekhdjm,t1_fekgw6h,1579200075.0,yes!! I edited the movie's banner.
callofcthulhu,fekg8kd,t1_fekfhnx,1579199397.0,Those are good news!! I hope they do a sequel with more horror scenes and that Chutlhu actually appears in his physical form along the game!!
callofcthulhu,fekfw7d,t1_fekff90,1579199193.0,wow very good.. I just got more fan of this game for the reference for another HP Lovecraft's story... the shambler is really scary!!
callofcthulhu,fekfof8,t1_fekel83,1579199063.0,I'm curious about this game.. looks like an action FPS with horror atmosphere!! But may you tell me if Cthulhu himself actually appears in this game?? I'm really wanting to see him in any game...
callofcthulhu,fekef6e,t1_feke713,1579198318.0,yes... for those who actually want to see Cthulhu himself this game is a bit dissapointing.
occult,fekcpcr,t1_fekbf5r,1579197296.0,"An important and useful article and info, actually this symbol is much more than the wrong view of nazi and hell that most of people juldge when looking the  swastika today."
occult,fekc9ev,t1_fekbg4p,1579197035.0,"I totally agree. I included a lot of symbols with their own meanings... it's a good thing for those who like it to search and get more info before judging. As you said, this symbol doesn't deserve to be hatred because of the wrong meaning of the nazis in Second World War."
occult,fekbyqp,t1_fekbeet,1579196858.0,I agree... a very good experience in a first person perspective horror movie.
