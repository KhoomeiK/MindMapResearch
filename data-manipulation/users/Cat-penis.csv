Ebay,fftbu4l,t3_ev4xap,1580215766.0,"I just about bought a Wii off eBay. It’s defective(won’t read discs at all) and both the console and controllers were covered in some sticky residue, This was after the dumbass shipped the first one to the wrong address and this guy had nothing but positive reviews. So now my only recourse after this whole ordeal is to box the thing up, drive down to the post office ship it off and wait another week just to get a refund.

I just started using eBay and this experience has soured me entirely. This was literally my second purchase all I learned was that you can’t trust seller feedback and the site does not give a single fuck about helping you out if you screwed over."

I guess it would be like if you had a distant uncle who you may or may not have met when you were 5 but you know who they are because your family talks about him and you’ve heard stories, then one day they die tragically. You’re not sad, but a lot of the people you care about are. There’s a significance that’s hard to ignore."
