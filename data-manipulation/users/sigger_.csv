You can do it, but many of the skills will not be transferable even though it seems like they should be. Skip bootcamps, either get a bachelors in CS, or buy 4 books on Java or C# ans learn the hell out of it. Once you work your way through those books, then you should focus on a """"""cool"""""" language like Python or Go. The vast majority of enterprise developement is in C, C++, C#, Java, or Scala, and you will benefit from learning to concepts in those languages. Again, its going to be a lot of effort, and pretty much constant diligent learning for well over a year before you'll be proficient enough to even contribute to open source project on github.

SweatyPalms,ffeb52g,t1_ffdv5d9,1579841841.0,"Like 60% of all reddit content to main-adjacent subs is certifiable guerrilla marketing. Like, sure, maybe the guys over at the Ring marketing department didn’t directly hire an actor and a director to film this, but It’s not unusual to think that Amazon, who owns Ring, is able to collect all internet-posted Ring content (the watermark in the top left makes it easy enough), use their data services to aggregate these and filter them and sort them into indexable containers, and then strategically post them about the internet for perfect subliminal marketing campaigns. 

I mean, this thing has the logo on it. People here are talking about how they’re going to buy Ring doorbells now. Once you start noticing these reddit posts, it becomes quite obvious. This is also true for “meme subs” like “/r/prequel memes”, “/r/thanosdidnothingwrong”, “/r/empiredidnothingwrong”, “/r/marvelmemes”. I mean, I know for these examples, they’re all huge franchises, so it’s not surprising that they’re popular, but this is Disney we’re talking about. They would melt their entire creative department in molten lead in a heartbeat if they thought they’d get a better ROI, if they could. And they definitely know how to maintain an Internet presence. Do you really think it’s organic or natural that the Star Wars Astro-turfed meme subs showed up in preparation for the sequel trilogy? Or that the marvel one still gets to the front page regularly despite the flagship of the franchise being over now and the purple villain only being present in <4 hours of content? Is it really that memeable? Is “I see this as an absolute win!” really a meme that is solid enough to exist organically for months/years, let alone the 30 other ones that get pasted onto the bottom of twitter screenshots?

* this is no place to die 
* you can’t defeat me. But he can. 
*  no, I don’t think I will

Do people think these all, and hundreds more, cropped up organically? I know they were huge movies, but just imagine the social and subliminal benefit of tricking your audience into advertising for you, and the absolutely minuscule investment cost to set up such a system. It would take just a few memers on a pay roll and a couple blokes moderating a sub that you reserved. Buy some upvotes and idiot mass-consumers will want to be part of the inside joke and next thing they know they’re watching 50 hours of media  intent with the captions enabled just to screenshot memeable one-liners to post of those subs. 

All of reddit, and, for the most part, the entirety of the internet, is just one big ad, but they’re just better at hiding it nowadays. It’s easy to make things seem like organic content now. Especially when companies like Amazon, Comcast, Disney, Google, Microsoft own so much of the world, and have so much data. And they have petabytes of user data, including everything from your IP address to the stuff you enjoy looking at to the trajectory of your cursor in the checkout page when you’re buying funko pops, petabytes of everything you do that they run analytics on, feed into AI/ML algorithms, and use to profile you to maximize targeted ads to make sure you consume as much as possible and then some. 

It’s never been easier to trick people into buying your product. The days of direct advertising is over. Now we just consume product forever."

ITCareerQuestions,ffcb4js,t1_ffc9jfb,1579795624.0,"Powershell automating AD account creations with EVERYTHING is pretty much what got me my promotion before people who’d been there for a lot longer than I have and have more experience. 

I made a script in powershell, only like 500 loc but 350 of it was the GUI, it requires only 2 fields: name, and title/department. The script will parse the name such that is splits at the first space, meaning that even last names like “Van Winkle” will create appropriately, then creates the username, which could be “pappyv” or “pvanwinkle” or “pappy.vanwinkle” or “pappy.van-winkle”, use your knowledge of your environment to get this right. Then, it creates the user account and uses a switch statement on the title (which is a drop-down selection in the GUI) to assign the correct groups, and you can also add radio buttons to add extra groups of you need to. Then it creates the users home directory on the server, and assigns the correct permissions (only the user and the domain admin can access this folder), then it uses the username to create the email address and sends this off to the exchange server/O365. At this point, the account is made, and will then send an email to HR and IT that this new user has been created and has these permissions. 

You can modify this to include anything you want for AD account. Set the SMTP address and aliases in the user Attributes. Change OUs based on job title. Assign office location automatically. Hook in your UC to assign a phone number. Anything. 

Probably took me 10 hours all together to make and has saved a LOT more than that in terms of time spent creating, and fixing mistakes. I later adapted this to 6ish other clients to fit their environment, using a base template as a jumping off point which I got from a narrowed down version of the original. 

The only way to learn is by doing it. Once I did this, I moved onto automating backups of .conf files for routers, creating new .xml files for network devices from old XML files, deleting the Downloads folders of the users on the DC when disk space got too full, hooking into Azure/O365 to automate removing malicious OAuth approvals and remediating compromised accounts faster than a human operator ever could (connect to O365, disable account, change password, list forwarding rules, allow the operator to remove forwarding rules that they deem malicious by choosing Y/n on each one, check OAuth/App registration, remove these, change password to something memorable, send email to user’s boss.) 

I mean, you can do almost literally anything with powershell. So identify some stuff that you do more than once a day and start there. People think that powershell is some arcane magic but it’s really quite fun and it REALLY makes you stand out to your bosses.

ITCareerQuestions,ff82x9p,t3_es2xkp,1579664576.0,"Cost of getting an MCSA is $0-150, including all books and most importantly a spare PC to install Windows Server 2016 on, and those really aren’t hard to find. And likely you will work in a place that already has those in production and you can just poke around and do as you please to learn more. 

Cost of Azure will be higher because you have to do a Pay-As-You-Go sub and Microsoft Nickels and dimes every single thread that you use in Azure - and you will have a hard time passing ANY azure cert, even the AZ-900, without at least going into the console and playing around. 

Yes, you do get a $200 credit, but that’s for a month. That means best case scenario, if you can do AZ-900 in 3-7 days, you only have 21 days of labbing left for 103. and if you expect to pass the 300, 301, and 500 without labbing, you’re going to have a rough time. 

MCSA Server 2016 is also one of the strongest IT certs that exist, and windows server will exist until the very last byte of data is sent across the very last Ethernet cable of humanity. 

That’s not to say that azure isn’t here to stay, but windows server is is pretty much every single company in the developed world. And it will stay like that for a long, long time. 

Additionally, there is a lot of overlap in the two because Azure’s big draw is AzureAD + Office Apps + windows license recycling. Most environments have some form of cloud in them and most places would trust an MCSA-holder to maintain some parts of Office and AzureAD. Obviously this is a far cry from DevOps or Big Data or machine learning which are other domains of Azure, but for the most part you won’t be able to go wrong with either. 

Also to consider, MCSA is 3 tests, while each Azure cert is only one test - but: the AZ-103 by itself means very little. But the AZ-103 + AZ-300 + AZ-301 is a potent cert combination. Additionally, so is the MCSA server 2016 + AZ-103. 

I’m not picking a side, just trying to give you more insight into this choice. I think it may also be wise to consider that generally a cloud ops role isn’t something that you can get with a few certs and no experience, where a T1/T2 role + MCSA is perfectly doable and you can use that experience to pivot into cloud after just a year or two. 

You won’t get into either without knowing networking and basic systems administration. Maybe take the new CCNA before either, as that will be a great first cert, and then if you get access to your companies windows servers, the MCSA should be a breeze. I find it’s less rare that a T1/T2 gets to play with Azure/AWS in production vs windows server, which is probably explicitly part of your job.

Technically, the newer CySA+ covers more requirements than the Sec+, but the Sec+ is a lot more commonly requested, and many places that are a few levels removed from the government, or some that aren't even related at all will still require it. 

The OSCP is an impressive cert that should be pretty potent in a job hunt, but with no real experience, you'll be hurting a bit. Unfortunately, most of the security industry is off limits to newbies, even with degrees, as it often is something that a person will move into after a few years of non-security work.

Make a github and post your garbage personal projects there until one day you submit a project that isn't garbage. You'll be surprised when it happens. Fork some other people's stuff, or work on opensource stuff, read a third book in that language, then supplement with something like Go or Python or Powershell (the last is technically not a programming language but is still pretty important to know if you chose C# because C# + Powershell + Azure is a crazy potent combo).

 And while I usually will argue for the A+ against this sub's usually judgement, I will cede that in this case it would be worthless to pursue. The issue is that it is VERY possible that your first job would require that you get it anyway. Or your resume gets automatically filtered because the characters ""A+"" were not on there.

ITCareerQuestions,fety0qz,t3_eqm15p,1579381174.0,"I can't offer too much, but I was studying for MCSA Server 2016 and switched to other stuff after about 6 weeks of studying. From what I remember, and from what I can get out of my coworkers who have MCSA Server 201X, the first test is the hardest, the second isn't easy or anything but its not as bad, and the third test is a joke. IDK if I'm just remembering it wrong, but maybe you're thinking about your experience of the first and applying it to the next two, which might not be the case. 

And also, consider motivation/discipline. You say it is a time investment, but would you \*need\* an Azure cert within 10 weeks? More than an MCSA? I would say finish out the MCSA since you already have momentum (which I think is a factor that is largely overlooked in self-study), and then move onto Azure. Additionally, Azure management and MCSA Server 201X have a LOT of overlap since AzureAD is like the main selling point for migrations, and domain controllers are like the main reason Windows Server 2016 exists. Not to mention #2 for either is Exchange and Office365 (which is manageable with Exchange Powershell). 

So I would say wrap the Server 2016 as fast as you can and then move on to Azure. It'll still be there in 10 weeks. And the MCSA is one of the strongest certs you can have in IT, and the MCSE is pretty great too, especially considering that you would be able to get the MCSE with just one more test as long as you take it within 11 months and 29 days from when you pass the 70-742. (if I recall correctly, maybe I got something mixed up). 

The truth is, if you switch to Azure, you'll have the certs, but once the 2019 test comes out, your bosses may not want you studying for the 2016 (even though the OSs are almost functionally identical by design), and you may need to take the 70-740 again. Its hard to know what management wants out of each cert when they contribute to partnership status and reseller status with Microsoft. The 10 weeks are going to pass anyway, and if you have your Azure AZ\_103/300/whatever by then, will you be allowed to help, and otherwise barred from helping if you don't?

TLDR: You have the momentum to finish, the 2nd and 3rd (especially) are easier than the first, its a strong cert, the AZ-X00 stuff with be there waiting for you anyway, but don't let the sunk-cost fallacy stop you from making the change to Azure.

I mean, every business-y business has Windows10 endpoints with an AD domain controller and their productivity is Microsoft Office. And it’s been this way for almost 25 years. If you already use that and you aren’t in the cloud yet, it makes 0 sense to pick anything other than Azure. 

But if you use MacBooks/BYOD and your mail servers are GSuite and your productivity software is google docs/sheets/slides, the only reason to go with azure would be for the non-corporate resources which are also available on AWS.

ITCareerQuestions,fd3s86z,t3_ejz8vp,1578161239.0,">How can I get started in IT? 

Start learning. Read the material for the CompTIA A+, and take that test. then move on to Net+ and Sec+ and the new CCNA. Find resources in /r/CompTIA

>Or is it too late? 

Bro, you’re 24. You are extremely young. People get into this field and do well in their 30s, 40s, even 50s. 

>Additionally, are there any specific disciplines that would involve writing?

Cybersecurity has a lot of policy writing. Auditing/compliance is a lot of writing. Management is a lot of writing. You’ll have a hard time getting there without tech skills tho. 


>I'm wondering if it's possible for me to get started in IT without a degree in IT/CS or relevant work experience? I'm slated to take a course on computer forensics at Georgia Tech, is that a worthwhile course to take?

You can do both without a degree, but IT definitely places less importance on a degree relative to CS. You’ll be fine getting started but later on you will want a degree because it will stunt your career. And yes, it’s a worthwhile course to know the terminology, and knowing the terminology is a HUGE part of IT interviews and cert tests. Like 40% of all CompTIA tests are just memorize acronyms. And putting that course on a resume would make it stronger but it certainly won’t be a silver bullet. 

>Some Background:
>1. I'm a 24 yr old living in the Atlanta area (I live at home, so I can be more flexible with my job options)

Atlanta is a fine place for an IT career. Any city is optimal. 

>2. I'm about 85/120 credits done with my degree in International Relations/Russian, but I can't afford to go back to uni at the moment/due to personal reasons, I'd vastly prefer to finish my degree in the ATL area. 

You can do IT without a degree. Only like 40% of the people at my company have degrees, and for those that do have one, they all would have been hired without one. 

>3. In terms of overall IT/Computer knowledge, I'm fairly good with basic computer maintenance , but I don't (currently) know how to code.

A+, Net+, Sec+, homelab the whole time. Replace your Comcast router with a Unifi gateway, and Unifi WAPs. Subnet your Network, add VLANs, get an old desktop and put Linux on it, make it your print server, get a RaspberryPi and put an OpenVPN on it, get another and put DNS Pi-Hole on it. Sub to /r/homelab, /r/homeserver, /r/raspberrypi, /r/linux4noobs, /r/sysadmin, /r/python, /r/powershell, /r/netsec. Give yourself projects. Learn how to install Linux and how to do nested virtualization, how to script updates, how to build a NAS with a RAID 5 storage volume. Btw you won’t need to code until later in your career but you should start with Powershell or Python after you learn how computers actually work. 

>4. In terms of interests, I'd like to work either in computer forensics or in pentesting, but I'm open to anything to get my foot in the door.

Pentesting is very VERY technical and hard to get into. All of Cybersecurity (which includes forensics) is hard to get into relative to other niches because it’s very hot and requires a lot of technical aptitude. Where a sysadmin would only need to know Windows Server and maybe some light networking, a cybersec guy would need to have advanced-level knowledge in Windows, Linux, scripting in multiple languages, networking, malware, compliance, physical security, recon, web apps, binary exploitation, data, etc. - it’s a much more reasonable goal to aim for being a network engineer or a cloud engineer or a data scientist or a sysadmin and then move into cybersec after getting enough experience in those things, and others, to be able to defend them properly. 

>Lastly, I speak conversational Russian and am working on learning Korean, would either of those be of any help? 

Probably honestly not, in the short term, but it would open up opportunities for interesting global and remote work and also look great on a resume because it definitely stands out and shows you like to learn - and knowing how to learn is the single most important part of all of IT. 


I would suggest:
* CompTIA A+
* CompTIA Net+ 
* CompTIA Sec+ 
* Cisco CCNA (after feb changes) 

Then you will know which parts you actively like and want to pursue and you’ll have a solid foundation to do so. Some people want to live in SIEM, some want to live in a Linux terminal, some want to build network infrastructure. And while usually, with enough learning, most people can do most niches, the only way to really thrive is to find out what you want to do. The industry is so wide that you can do whatever you’re best at. Like if you find out you REALLY like malware analysis, then there will be jobs for you. 

Also - don’t skip the A+, people will tell you to because it’s too easy but they are wrong in this case because unless you have a fresh IT or CS bachelors then it will be worth it, and even if you did have one you should probably still get it anyway. 

Also read the wiki.

“Niches”, that people specialize in which lead to better careers and higher pay:
* Cybersecurity 
* Data Science
