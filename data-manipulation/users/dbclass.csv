Blackfellas,ffbs3gd,t1_ff9i6mo,1579780602.0,"It wasn’t Atlanta, it was in Texas."
Atlanta,ff9gio6,t1_ff9cqwo,1579712525.0,"I understand that. It’s the reason I left Atlanta for college, I just couldn’t stand the environment around me anymore and the mindsets of people in College Park, but I think we can mold West End into something that’s a national model for redevelopment. Gentrification is gonna happen either way, so I’m glad we can get ahead of it and build a neighborhood that’s affordable and accessible to all. We’ve been shut out of economic success for so long but I have hope that this will be different."
Atlanta,ff9beri,t1_ff9adbz,1579709123.0,"That’s what I’m banking on. Even in the soulless wealthy South Fulton subdivisions, you can still feel that those are black neighborhoods. My parents neighborhood in SF is pretty diverse but you still feel comfortable knowing that you can have late night cook outs and gatherings without having the cops called. That’s all I want West End to be. So many AA are uninformed about the real value of real estate. So many of us could’ve bought cheap asf property in 2009 and would’ve been wealthy 10 years later, but so many of us are afraid of where we came from that we jumped ship to the suburbs as soon as we get a taste of money. I really wish my parents had bought in O4W instead of South Fulton."
Atlanta,ff99bdc,t1_ff98xtc,1579707812.0,"Atlanta has significant black wealth. If this neighborhood completely loses its culture, it’s our fault. If I go back to Atlanta after college, I’m going straight to the West End (or possibly Washington Park). This area of the city has too much potential to miss out on. If the current residents stay and bank on future development, everything will be okay. Plus, I don’t mind diverse faces if the culture is still there."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ff96rde,t1_ff96kha,1579706165.0,"Yeah but in that case, we’re all slaves right?"
Atlanta,ff94xpm,t1_ff945u0,1579704937.0,"Yeah, I think West End is gonna be a model for Black gentrification. All the wealthy and middle class African Americans here tend to move to the suburbs but I see West End bucking that trend."
Atlanta,ff908eo,t1_ff8zu7b,1579701510.0,To take this area to the next level. West End Mall is wasting a lot of space in this area and it’s bad urban design. I think the residents of West End deserve more than Rainbow and Maxway as retail options too. This development could be a huge college student destination with the AUC right across the freeway too.
Assistance,ff8xgfd,t3_es6rod,1579699247.0,"Unfortunately they’re probably gonna drug test, so even if you live in a weed legal state, you wouldn’t be able to work for them."
Atlanta,ff8wykh,t1_ff8vz9u,1579698808.0,I’d agree with you if this was in Buckhead but West End needs this development.
politics,ff7nbep,t1_ff7ksoc,1579653655.0,"A lot of wealthy liberal don’t understand that politics is more than a game for most Americans. It isn’t about teams or who getting the most points to me, I simply care about policy. Bernie’s beliefs brought new voters to the democratic primary that are either new to politics or just weren’t democrats before. They’re playing by different rules. They don’t care about party loyalty and they don’t see other democrats as allies. That’s the issue. Trump is our collective enemy, but centrist democrats do as much damage as republicans do to stop progressive policies from moving forward. So yes, while I’ll vote for whoever wins the primary, I’m not going to be friends with people who continuously prove to me that they stand for the rich and wealthy over the majority of the country."
politics,ff726fp,t1_ff6ppet,1579639628.0,But he wasn’t a Democrat in the first place. You guys are telling people who are only on your side because of Bernie to vote for someone they wouldn’t have voted for anyway.

PresidentialRaceMemes,ff5niue,t1_ff5nfsy,1579601824.0,He’s a social democrat/progressive. Liberals are for less market regulation and less social programs. Clinton/Biden like candidates are liberal. Moderate republicans are also liberal.
Georgia,ff5mlbf,t3_ern8wa,1579600404.0,What’s with the hate for summer? You guys actually like wind chill? I can barely ride my bike in this weather.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdjzd58,t3_elox1n,1578492113.0,"This thread is already fucked but before I can’t post anymore (I’m black just too lazy to get verified), both Clinton and Trump were warmongers. Clinton with Russia and Trump with China and Iran. I don’t have to defend one to attack the other. They both suck, in fact, the majority of our federal government sucks. This is what happens when corporations buy your politicians. As long as war time companies are making money, this isn’t going to stop. We need to elect a person who can’t be corrupted, and as of now, Bernie Sanders is the only person running that has had the same ideals since before a lot of us were born. You can’t attack Trump and defend Obama and Clinton. They’re all killing poor middle eastern citizens. You’re a hypocrite if you say otherwise."
NoStupidQuestions,fdisyys,t1_fdisu2r,1578450354.0,Well duh it’s breaking the law. I’m asking what would the impacts be and would it work as a protest.
NoStupidQuestions,fdis8uu,t1_fdis0kr,1578449890.0,Wouldn’t that help their protest though? The government is spending money they wouldn’t have to hold them in prison.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdikt0b,t1_fdia40v,1578445122.0,"I get paid $8.50 an hour at a restaurant where I have to take orders, prep the lobby, and clean, so $9 for 30 minutes of driving might seem a little ridiculous to some. That money most likely isn’t even going to the driver anyway, it’s going to the app company. They profit off of being a middleman."
college,fdhwd6n,t3_elcmhp,1578431350.0,"I only have one job right now and I’m not getting enough hours to pay rent. I was okay until December and now I’m paying rent from behind. If it’s possible for you to use grant or loan money for your off campus housing, please go for it. This just sucks."

Atlanta,fdhu8sw,t1_fdgsycv,1578430247.0,That what they should call it instead of the jumbled mess of a name it has currently.
PresidentialRaceMemes,fdgscv8,t3_ela14l,1578407083.0,I know this is a joke but China isn’t actually communist. I don’t think there’s ever been an actual communist country (or at least one that lasted beyond a few years).
Atlanta,fdgrerg,t3_elbrlj,1578406370.0,I was obsessed with MARTA as a kid. Riding in a car just isn’t as cool.
Atlanta,fdg8pjx,t3_el1bxg,1578384780.0,Traffic is terrible in West Midtown and there isn’t good transit access. Midtown is great and Downtown is on its way to becoming a good neighborhood. I’d personally look at the East side though in areas like Old 4th Ward or Grant Park along Memorial or Dekalb.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fdg6onh,t3_ekxvd5,1578382219.0,Damn so questioning literally anything suspicious is insecure? I’m not saying you have to be 100% transparent about everything but I’ve messed myself up before believing everything was good with people who were plotting behind my back the whole time. That feeling in your gut isn’t there for nothing.
Valdosta,fddjcxo,t1_f0kf45n,1578314593.0,This is late but I used it in November and December so I think I have good enough experience. The seats are about the same size as Greyhound’s. Space is tighter upstairs than downstairs on the bus so I’d take that into consideration but you’ll most likely have two free seats since the buses are rarely full.
eagles,fdd3wci,t1_fdcz496,1578293721.0,Naw I’m sure a lot of CNN commentators actually believe the bs they spew when it’s segments based on opinion (and I’m a leftist)

doordash_drivers,fd40voi,t1_fd3j6g5,1578163364.0,I totally agree with this. I’d rather have the tip as part of the fees.
PresidentialRaceMemes,fd3yrj9,t3_ejpjfz,1578162838.0,"If we aren’t going to accurately measure who qualifies, why have them at all?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd3p4ih,t1_fd3ommu,1578160491.0,Yeah because if Iran assassinated Trump for the crimes of the American military for the past two decades his supporters wouldn’t be in the streets protesting huh?
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd3nmy6,t1_fd3m7ra,1578160041.0,"That is utilizing violence though. They oftentimes broke the law on purpose and provoked police action because of it. What’s the difference between that and the Hong Kong protests? It doesn’t matter what side attacks first, but if violence isn’t involved at all who’s gonna care about your protest? You think Mandela would’ve succeeded by peaceful protests guided by apartheid SA military guards with witty signs? That’s not protesting at all, it’s literally obeying your oppressors."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd3mdip,t1_fd3a7ge,1578159747.0,"If the US attacks them for protesting, than it makes us the bad guys. That’s the point of a protest. Civil Rights protestors went in breaking the law knowing they would get hurt but that was the point. The world isn’t supporting the US here."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fd3lnp5,t1_fd3ek87,1578159517.0,"Are you saying the civil rights era protests where people were literally getting their faces chewed off by police dogs and shot with water cannons didn’t involve violence? There’s a huge departure from that to our current pre-planned, no goal, social media protests where there are no stakes."
AskReddit,fd09gpj,t1_fcy46np,1578115613.0,Annnnnnd it’s gone
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fd08jhh,t1_fczq6zb,1578115231.0,They think the American Democratic Party is far left. This is a country that is so far right that Nanci “let’s compromise with republicans” Pelosi is what they consider too far to the left.

CFB,fcxk1ia,t1_fcwi3jq,1578064838.0,Take note that this stadium is on VSU campus and is miles away from the actual high school.
CFB,fcxjxsx,t1_fcwg1hj,1578064767.0,Our athletic field house is considered one of the best in D2. There are worse stadiums in D1 than Valdosta’s. Just because a high school uses it doesn’t mean it’s trash. This is a city that treats football like a religion.
CFB,fcxjaa1,t1_fcxg38c,1578064318.0,"What’s crazy is that Valdosta City Schools just build a shiny new high school but no stadium to go with it. I honestly don’t see it happening, Bazemore-Hyder is really historic to this town."
CFB,fcw6g4k,t1_fcw3l4p,1578018236.0,"All of those team have had 4 national championships within the millennium, so on par with Valdosta. (not sure about Colorado, can’t find any national title data for them)."
college,fcvha2c,t1_fcvccbz,1578002065.0,"It’s just a regional state school. To be fair, my set of circumstances don’t apply to everyone and if was trying harder I would’ve been fine. You have to maintain a 2.0 GPA per semester to stay enrolled, and if you dip below you get a probationary period as a warning. If you’re suspended you would have to sit out the next semester (excluding summer) so you’d spend about 6-7 months before you can come back."
CFB,fcvge28,t1_fcvg096,1578001538.0,Furman looks really tough. A Southern-Valdosta rivalry would be epic. I can see that selling out year to year.
