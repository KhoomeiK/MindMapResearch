As a nurse, I have seen some really awful cases; as someone's close friend for years, I saw the saddest thing I think I've ever seen in my life, where one of my best friends in the whole world developed CTE from this exact scenario, and wound up killing his own mother with a hammer to her head. Lives have been ruined, and for what? There are many, many, many other team sports that your children could play -- please don't destroy their futures by being so hardheaded (pun intended, sorry, I had to). Please, please, please, in begging you to have a talk with a doctor (preferably a sports specialist and/or neurologist, but a GP will also do fine and can refer you to a specialist if need be) then sit down and have a talk with your boys, and then have a good, long think with yourself and reassess what you think you should do and go from there.


I don't like how you are getting all of these comments saying that you're awful and don't care about your kids. I believe that you do care about your kids because you obviously want them to have the experience of working hard, being part of a team, having success, getting exercise, gaining self confidence, etc., and that is definitely commendable, but there are many other ways to go about it."
