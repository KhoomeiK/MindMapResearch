Insurance,fejumqn,t1_feghdrz,1579186229.0,"I mean I created this thread just because I wanted a little bit more back from the $370 I paid (not all of it back obviously). I don't know why you keep saying they will make no money. I paid them $450 in total, I'm not asking for all of it back, not even half of it back. I just think getting $32 back out of the $450 is just ridiculous. Just a little bit more back would be good and they will still be getting a decent amount of money. Everyone wins

So for the broker's insurance plan as listed in the documents, The total 12 month premium is only $1541. Though if you add it all up the amount I would have paid is a lot more than this, even without counting the $200 broker fee...  Was there a kickback to the dealer?

The new insurance I signed up for is $105/month and the total 12 premium is $1260.  I did not have to pay anything more for the first payment.

I've never been in an accident but I did have one speeding ticket back in 2018, other than that I'm clean. I'm still getting the California Good Driver discount."
Insurance,fegaad3,t1_feed8k0,1579084646.0,"Just to clarify, the broker on the first phone call where he charged my credit card didn't even say ""there are some fees"". He only told me that AFTER I got home a couple hours later and I called him after realizing how ridiculous I'm paying. On the first phone call all he said was ""ok today's charged will be $370 whats your credit card number?"""
Insurance,feg9lcd,t1_feep8rv,1579083663.0,"I'm not expecting all $450 back. I know the broker deserves a good amount of that money. However, I'm getting just $32 back. I'm losing a lot of money for just 12 days of insurance. I just want a fair amount back.

I was more than willing to stay with the broker, my intentions was never to cancel. Out of curiosity, I shopped around and literally every company was cheaper and I don't have to pay an expensive broker fee too. If every company I looked at wasn't cheaper, I would have gladly have paid the broker fee and not have canceled. How is it fair that I have to pay more monthly when I ALSO had to pay a broker fee. I thought the broker would ""help"" me find the best and affordable plan. I had to pay a broker to have him sign me up for an overpriced plan lol?"
Insurance,feg95wp,t1_fedq2nq,1579083050.0,"I thought a broker was supposed to help you find the best and affordable plan right? Every company I looked at was cheaper and also I don't have to pay any broker fees. How is it fair that I have to pay a broker to sign me up for an overpriced plan lol? If the broker had been honest and just given me a fair plan, I wouldn't have canceled and never made this thread. 

My intentions was to never cancel, I thought I could trust the broker. I didn't even realize I had overpaid until I got home and decided to check the price. Also was there a kickback to the dealer? Even with the broker fee, it still all doesn't add up to $370."
Insurance,feg8f3e,t1_fedx490,1579081980.0,"Your're misunderstanding, I was actually willing to stay with the broker until I found out how much more I had to pay compared to literally every other company. How is it fair that I hired a broker to ""help"" me when he did the opposite by giving me an overpriced plan and then charging me an expensive broker fee on top of that."
Insurance,feg87rh,t1_fefw5ow,1579081689.0,"I never said I wanted a full refund. I just want a fair prorated amount back. All together they charged me $450 for just 12 days. I'm getting just $32 back (FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY NOT THE BROKER). How is that even fair when the broker gave me an overpriced plan? Every company I looked at was cheaper, literally everyone. None of them charging me a broker fee too. Why did I have to pay a broker so much when he didn't even help me find the best or most affordable plan?"
Insurance,feg7y89,t1_fefbic5,1579081315.0,"You're misunderstanding, my strategy was never to pump and dump. I was more than willing to stay with the broker, I never had any intentions to cancel later. BUT when I told my dad I had to pay $370 he called me an idiot because I got scammed. I then shopped around and literally every company was cheaper and I don't have to pay an expensive broker fee too. If every company I looked at wasn't cheaper, I would have gladly have paid the broker fee and not have canceled. How is it fair that I have to pay more monthly when I ALSO had to pay a broker fee. I thought the broker would ""help"" me find the best and affordable plan... I had to actually pay a broker to sign me up for an overpriced plan???

It's frustrating that I'm charged $450 for just 12 days of coverage and getting almost none of it back.

Just to clarify, I don't want all the money back, I don't even want half of it back. I understand I used the brokers time so he deserves to be paid. But seriously, how is getting just $32 back out of the total of $450 even fair? That's just 7% back.

Btw, I do appreciate the replies though. Thank you for that. I know you are probably really frustrated with me and this thread. I just hate being scammed and taken advantage of due to my age."

It's weird because I was able to drive home without needing to sign the documents. I actually thought I was doing something illegal and I needed to sign them right away. So I hurried and signed them as soon as I got home lol..."
Insurance,fedoavy,t1_fedl8nl,1579016315.0,"Oh I forgot to clarify. On the first phone call he didn't tell me it's more expensive due to fees. On the first phone call he literally just said ""alright so for today it will be $370). I called him again when I got home because it hit me that $370 was ridiculous (he already charged my credit card). So only when I asked why, he told me."

Insurance,fedjmzc,t1_fedium4,1579013195.0,If he told me about the expensive broker fee I probably would've told him I will call him back after I shop around(that's what you're supposed to do right?). It's not like he did much beforehand (short phone call). I honestly thought the extra cost was almost entirely taxes since the tax here is kind of high in CA.
Insurance,fedinhn,t1_fedhvac,1579012501.0,"I mean yeah I understand that the broker fee is how they make money. BUT it would have been nice if he had at least told me that the ""extra fee"" is the broker fee. I literally asked him why do I have to pay $370 for the first bill and he just told me ""fees and stuff""."
Insurance,fedhsv5,t1_federah,1579011875.0,"I know man, I'm stupid as af. But is there seriously nothing I can do? He literally only said ""ok for today it will be $370 what's your credit card #). Didn't tell me about broker fees or anything at all. Charged my credit card on the spot, and then emailed me forms to sign which then lists the fees. 

Idk if there was a kickback to the dealer or he just wanted to take advantage of a young naive driver..."
Insurance,fedhgh8,t1_fedgju5,1579011620.0,"I don't think the broker did much to be honest. The phone call wasn't really long and he didn't explain anything. 

But the question is will I get that fee back at all? Not even a prorated amount? I think it's unfair that I had to pay so much and not get a prorated refund of that fee when I was only insured for a week and a half. I thought I could shop around and find something cheaper with similar coverage(I did) and cancel..."

AMA,feda0g1,t3_eodp42,1579005212.0,I'm confused. I read that this disease is always genetic. You said you haven't slept in a year and half. So before that you were perfectly normal and slept ok? The symptoms didn't occur until a year and a half ago?
Insurance,fed9cgl,t1_fed8umv,1579004522.0,I was never told about the broker fee when he called me to sign up. He asked for my credit card to charge me the $370. BUT I DIDN'T SIGN ANYTHING YET. I paid first and then he said he will email me in a couple minutes to sign the forms. Then did the forms show a broker fee of $200...  So he charged me $370 before I even got to look at the forms to sign.

So I won't get any of that back, not even a prorated amount? That's kind of stupid, my new insurance I switched over to didn't have any broker fees at all, just paid the monthly price and I was set.
