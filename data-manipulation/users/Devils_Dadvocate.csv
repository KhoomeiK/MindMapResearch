Foodforthought,ffyz7z6,t1_ffwv36e,1580359014.0,"Labor machines don't really have any ""thinking"" parts, at least not currently. They're only built and programmed to their function. If a factory robot were to ask itself such a question, it becomes a moot point because without it's factory position what does it exist for? What would it do if it didn't have to do its job?"
Foodforthought,ffyyrnv,t1_ffxeww2,1580358645.0,"The thing about this is that the job amount remained mostly the same, but they've shifted into different positions. Instead of a factory being operated by factory workers, most human positions in factories have been replaced with machinery. This got rid of the original factory jobs, but created jobs in making/operating/maintaining these machines. The problem there is that most of the time a higher level of education is required for these new positions that was previously not required with plain human jobs in the same factory. The catch there is that, as I'm sure you already know, obtaining higher education has become exponentially more expensive compared to the time that all these jobs were human based."

They might say that freedom would be the right to observe and endure the suffering that every human is entitled to, and let their mind function on its own. Personally I'd say that there's a certain lack of freedom with both situations, you're either forced to be well by the government or forced not to be well by your brain. I still wouldn't agree that either is right, as these are very black and white terms to see the issue in. I see what good could potentially be done from mandatory treatment, but that invites a measure of oppression that would far offset its benefit. Not to mention that this would open the door for normal people to be falsely committed. Still, if mental treatment should be the individual's choice, then it becomes an odd case when said individual can't choose clearly, or simply choose at all. Forcing everyone like this individual to be committed would be far too extreme, and attempting to treat an involuntary patient would make little to no progress. I'd posit that a nice middle ground between the two would be to have something like a DNR status for people in this situation. They could assign themselves an order that in this sort of event they either don't want treatment or they want to be committed, even if at that moment it is involuntary. Or maybe you could select a small group of loved ones that could vote on whether or not you should be committed in the event that you can no longer tell."
changemyview,fdlfdjv,t3_elratb,1578522827.0,"I'll agree that there's a bit of truth to this, as most people would dress to look a certain way and that shows what kind of aesthetics they favor. However, to put the point as a generalization isn't correct. I've met a fair amount of people (and I've been one of such people on quite a few occasions) who completely went against my first impression on viewing their attire. I've seen people in drug-rugs who don't even drink, people who regularly wear pajamas in public but showed a great dedication to detail, and I myself have tendencies to wear hawaiian shirts and to play to industrial metal on my headphones, which wins some very surprised expressions from people who ask what I'm listening to. I can see your thought process, but you can't tell someone's personality from only their outfit with complete certainty."

changemyview,fclylsr,t3_ehjsof,1577759663.0,"Well, being that the tyrannical government would have one of the largest militaries in the world, complete with tanks, planes, drones, and apocalypse-level explosives, I don't think armed citizens would stand a chance. Of course, armed citizens do make it so that the only option a tyrannical government has against a rebellion would be genocide, which would be counterproductive for everything in their country, but they are perfectly equipped for said genocide and expecting common sense out of the government will fail you often."
