AskReddit,fefopk9,t1_feep9nw,1579061024.0,"> but really, I enjoy the cheap prices as much as anyone else.

I think we all do. But where things get cloudy for me is where exactly does it turn into a viscous cycle where people demand low prices because wages are low *and* wages stagnate because industry demands cheaper products. At this point it's a ""chicken & egg"" conundrum for me.

I mean, if I made enough to buy a fridge that lasts 20 years I'd likely be fine paying much more for it. And the worker building that fridge would have higher wages to also buy more expensive/higher quality goods. Conversely, if my employer is reducing benefits and not giving out raises I'm going to seek the cheapest consumer goods I can find. Sorry if it only lasts 3 years. Sorry if the guy building it makes $2 a day in Malaysia. I have less buying power, damnit! I'm really at a loss over this shit every goddamn time I buy groceries. Seriously, fuck Walmart. Fuck Amazon. But you know what? WTF am I supposed to do when every year my wage buys less and less and less? We buy cheaper and cheaper, trying to stretch our dollars; but it seems to only be feeding the beast."
AskReddit,fefnirf,t1_fef2h0b,1579060204.0,"Yeah but here's the thing.... There *are* some decent, sturdy clothes at Walmart; as they've used their muscle to get certain reliable, reputable brands on board. However, since they weild such buying power they've forced those brands (looking at you Levi's) to capitulate to a price point and hence, a manufacturing cost, that destroys QA as that brand seeks cheaper and cheaper sources. 

A personal example: Dickies work pants. Sure I can *still* get a pair for roughly $25 retail, having bought these as my preferred work pants for over a decade. BUT.. these days that $25 doesn't buy me the guaranteed quality it did 10-15 years ago. If I go to Walmart right now, I can get three of the exact same pant; same size, same cut, same color. But I'd bet they aren't the same pants. One will be slightly smaller than the other, one will have a couple weak seams and one will feel *almost* like the pair that I paid $25 for in 2005, which actually lasted 4 years back then. Btw, none of these will last 4 years. 

So for me, this is the ""sometimes"" quality. Formerly quality brands, cutting corners because they have to make the price point Walmart asks, otherwise they loose their biggest market, pushing out product they know is substandard because if they don't they'll lose 60% of their retail market. Sure, one in three or four of their products holds up maybe as long as it did back in the day; but that's actually a fluke. They are only ""high quality"" when every single duck lines up in their outsourced Chinese factory, Banghali textile mill, Indian cotton farm, and so on."
