The problem is that LA is such a large area with such a huge disparity in rent rates, that to take an average is a bit silly. The 1 bedrooms in Santa Monica or Downtown are $3,500-$4,000 but go to the valley or Eagle Rock and you can find decent places under $2K."

todayilearned,ffkb9yd,t1_ffk5c7p,1580019959.0,"Oh please, I work in customer service in LA and A-List celebs don't have security with them 24/7. I've served everyone from Michael Keaton to Jennifer Garner to James Corden and nobody had a security guard. The only people I've ever served that had personal security come in before they sat down were Beyonce and Jay-Z, and that was in a ""Power Dinner"" restaurant that Papparazzi frequented the exterior of. Most celebrities live a pretty chill life."

You just can't live anywhere ""cool"" or ""cool-adjacent"". I'm cool-adjacent-jacent. If you want to live somewhere cool you get two roommates in a 2 bedroom place. For some people that's worth it."

We work in customer service. Sometimes that means putting up with someone's oddities to our inconvenience. Yes, it's annoying, but really he didn't do much harm. He slowed your close by a bit.  
  
It doesn't seem like he was rude or entitled. He just sat in and ate. And sure, he didn't tip, but sometimes people don't tip. Oh well."
