ethfinance,ff6mobx,t1_ff6a6il,1579630465.0,"I would say a better metric would be % of net worth once you're above the ""poverty line"".  If you can't meet basic needs, you shouldn't have much or any money in crypto.  After that it would vary depending on your risk tolerance.  Young people with a long investment horizon maybe 5-15% in an ultra high risk asset is reasonable as long as the rest of your portfolio is diversified.

Median net worth of an individual American is about $80k.  

So anything over $12k invested so anything >70 ETH at todays prices would be my estimate. 

Or >8.6 ETH if you bought at ATH $1400. 

Or >38,709 ETH if you got in at ICO price of $0.31.

So global time and space estimate would be anything greater than 38.7k ETH is ""a lot"" of money."

django,fehz04t,t1_fehvh42,1579126726.0,"After reading some forums, I don't think you need to do anything with the ufw firewall.  you should just manage your port settings from the 'Networking' tab on your management page.

if you already enabled ufw, just do:

\> sudo ufw disable

Once you have a static IP set, port 8000 open on your lightsail>Networking tab, and your django app running on your instance, it should work.  Good luck!"
django,fehvh42,t1_fehjdxt,1579124677.0,"Ok, I just spun up a lightsail instance with Ubuntu (base OS), installed python3 and django, enabled ufw 8000, enabled custom port 8000 over TCP on lightsail>Networking panel, and ran the development server (with DEBUG= True in settings.py) and was able to see the default page at http://<your-lightsail-public-IP>:8000

I would guess the problem lies with your public IP.  In the 'Networking' tab did you click 'Create static IP'?"
django,fehif4e,t3_ep69pl,1579117181.0,"Not as familiar with lightsail, but first things I would try in the terminal: 

\> sudo ufw status

(to check that port 8000 is open)

Then i would try adding ""localhost"" and/or ""127.0.0.1"" to your allowed hosts in settings.py and reboot your server.

I believe this is exposing the development server to the outside world and you really should use some combination like nginx/gunicorn if you plan to use this for production."
