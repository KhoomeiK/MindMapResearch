Being a villager in China (or anywhere really) must have really sucked. Just trying to farm and shit, and at any moment some dude with an army can just come take all your stuff, rape, pillage, and kill you. Done so in the name of people and causes you likely have never heard of and wouldn’t affect your anyways.
