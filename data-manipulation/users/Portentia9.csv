LifeProTips,fe09q6e,t3_enggy4,1578807061.0,"I am not going to ""force"" myself to think or feel anything beyond what are my true emotions. That is depriving myself from a certain and very necessary release of whatever pains me. 

I've tried 'lying' to myself. It only made things worse. The moment I *allowed* myself to truly *feel* my true emotions, they poured out in torrents of tears. I am on the mend. It needed to happen, instead 'forcing' myself into a false-positive train of thought. That only intensified my inner-turmoil and I denied myself to feel the pain. Pain needs to be felt and dealt with accordingly to the individuals personal needs. 

This post basically says, ""Don't address your wounds"". Lie to yourself and say that they aren't there and aren't real. 

A more positive message should have stated this obvious fact: Heal thyself. Lying to yourself and *forcing* unnatural thoughts and denying true feelings is pure B.S."

I joined for personal reasons a few years ago. I feel the voting system and 'mods' are a joke. I killed my Facebook account several years ago and found this site as an alternative of sorts. But, I have to scratch my head in wonder about a 'downvote' on people expressing themselves, specifically when commenting on say, pet fotos. Fucking stupid. Anyhow, I would be lying to myself to say that there aren't certain things that 'grind my gears' when I am perusing Reddit.

AskReddit,fcominw,t1_fcn1vk3,1577835966.0,"Preface: because this has to do with poo.

A fellow I knew had a religious zealot for a mother; a real shitshow.

She trapped me in his room one night while he was attending a study group. I'm not going to get into the thick of it, but when she asked ""What are your thoughts on God?"", I tried to bail. She went on her own way talking mostly to herself. Mind you, she was lying on her son's bed staring at me unblinking. I had expressed to her that I was not comfortable having that kind of conversation with her, specifically. Well, she ignored me and went on to say that when she takes a shit, she **believes** that it is her sins leaving her body. At that point, I said ""Okay, enough"". The entire time she was lying on her son's bed, staring me down, she was also stroking this garage-cat that I had brought in because it was freezing outside. I also had a spaceheater running, for they did not have proper heating.

The fucked-up thing is that after I shut her ramblings down, she suddenly snapped to, stopped petting the cat, angrily snatched it up, got up from the bed, turned the heater off and proceeded to throw the poor cat outside. In the freezing cold night. 

I wonder what this God-fearing zealot shat out after that episode of God-loving-fearing behaviour?"
