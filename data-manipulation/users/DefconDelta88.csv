I mean if they're lying then yeah it's a scam, but if some dude is just side hustling some candy on the tube to make some money, idc. The entire basis of capitalism is selling a thing for more than you paid.

And quite frankly I don't mind paying an upcharge on a candy based impulse buy. If rather they sell me overpriced candy than a pair of headphones *when I'm already wearing significantly nicer ones...

Between the horrific emotions deeply embedded in the fabric of the ordeal, the victim blame and shame game, and the gross dismissal of our experiences by cold, callous, generally overworked officers and detectives, there's just so many reasons why we don't want to come forward.

It's already hard enough being a rape victim without even counting in the longterm psychological impacts that often manifest in very unapparent ways and take years to become visible to us, the victims. I couldn't handle someone asking me why I did X thing and telling me it was stupid. I was 17. Of course I was stupid. *I was a kid.* They're all stupid at that age. Doesn't mean they deserved it.

Why bother with a system that just drags victims through the mud and leaves them behind anyways? My only regret is that it might have happened to someone else, and maybe if I had the strength left to *endure* the way people handle rape victims, I could have prevented more victims. But I was tired and sad and ashamed and barely processed the whole thing for a decade, and in the end, I realized by that point that the best thing I could do was connect with other survivors and help give them someone to talk to who *knows* what they're going through in a way that is beyond words, and can help put feelings and thoughts into words so they can be processed and healing can happen.

My healing came through talking about it, and the aftermath. I hope some day, victims can come forward with the confidence that someone is going to be there to embrace them with the support they need and will seek justice in any way they can. And a system that isn't grossly broken. I hope some day their only option won't be to just talk about it, but to be able to walk outside without the fear of bumping into their fucking rapist.

For anyone reading this, if you've been silent and alone, talk to someone. It took me a decade and I wish I'd done it sooner. Feel free to PM me. Doesn't matter how old you were when it happened, whether you're a guy or gal, what you were wearing, who you were with, how drunk or high you were. You didn't deserve it, and continuing the silence will eat you from the inside out. No matter what we went through, many of the emotions we experience from it are very much the same, and we don't start healing until the pressure from those feelings can be processed and released. 

It will get better, but it starts with a conversation, whether it's a therapist or a friend or a random internet stranger who's walked that same dark path.

Hell, the AIDS epidemic in the 80s was largely ignored for quite a while because people saw it as a disease only gays had to worry about and hoped it would eradicate the whole group. Wasn't really until people caught on that it wasn't a ""gay disease"" or god smiting those filthy queers that they really started to do something about it.

I'm happy on 2020. We have our damn problems but we have more escapes from those problems and a largely more progressive society than we've ever had before. Doesn't mean bigotry hasn't found a revived platform recently, but that isn't the trend, just a speed bump we're rolling over.

As a kid, I was leery around people already and took a while to warm up, but the older I got, the more friendly and open I became. None the less, despite eventually becoming highly outgoing, I always had a very strong danger sense. There were a few instances over my childhood where even at the time, I recognized some shit was amiss and likely saved myself from some terrible experiences. To this day, I think a lot of the coaching my parents did is part of what enabled me to have a pretty good eye for real danger. My sister is a lot more paranoid (to the point where it's a hinderence) but there have been two instances in our adult lives that the same sense of danger very likely saved not just my life, but hers. The most disturbing one was when her and I were on a cabin trip in the mountains and went for a walk after dark down a quiet road (forested area here in the PNW). Anyways, I won't go into long details since it's a bit of a story, but the short version is we wound up getting stalked by a pickup truck that was acting VERY suspicious. My sister is scared of a pin drop, but she knows her fear is validated if I'M sketched out because historically speaking, it's rare and it's only ever happened when it's warranted. 

Safe to say I had a dreadful feeling when I watched the truck slow down a ways up ahead of us, feign making a turn, and then starting coming back around quite literally *looking* for us. I sent her with the dog into the dark woods about 30 yards back well out of sight while I slinked through the underbrush under the cover of the darkness and heard two guys talking about us and looking. I didn't catch enough to get details, but I heard enough to confirm I was not about to be on an episode of Cold Case Files and disappeared into the woods, grabbed my sister, and silently circled the lake to get back to our cabin. 

It's the same feeling I had when I was a kid and was in two different scenarios in which I'm pretty sure someone was going to try and grab me (I was a very small child, not difficult to do). I'm glad I had those experiences because it's the difference between questioning myself and brushing it off as paranoia, and knowing I'm in real danger. 

Trust your instincts. Talk to your kids. Help them develop theirs, because god knows it might be the difference between them becoming some serial killer's yard ornament, or living a full, happy life."

People are far more interested in being right about something than they are about being correct, so in general, the world is full of opinions founded on opinions.

It takes effort to learn about anything, and all my life has taught me is that a hell of a lot of people won't even put in the bare minimum effort to be informed, but they'll readily tell you their opinion.

We are taking about a species that borderline panics about not having all the answers, and thousands of years of history have demonstrated we are fine just making shit up so we feel like we do have the answers."

2019 I made it to $90k a year and get to bring my dog to work, I have my own 2 bedroom apartment to myself (I have fucking crown molding too lol), got my dog, ditched the dead weight bf, am nearly finished with 2 huge writing projects and ready to get published, I learned to sculpt, and am in the process of building my dream PC.

Even just 3 years ago I was only making $40k a year.

Shit can change fast. The major lessons I learned in the last decade: be kind to yourself and to others, the love you put out comes back to you, and don't subject yourself to dead weight people, you deserve better."

Good lord, reddit, not literally everything on this sub is written by a 13 year old boy.

As someone who is bisexual and has engaged in some oddball bedroom fun for the sake of spicing things up, this sounds exactly like the kind of thing I'd have done with a specific ex gf. We had more than a few hilarious bedroom mishaps (that always ended with us laughing to the point of agony). I also thoroughly enjoy the feeling of cum, which I should add, by no means suggests I like the god awful fallout after the fact. Feels good but nobody in their right minds likes the monkey hop you gotta do between the bedroom and the bathroom with a hand towel cupping their crotch."

My dog lives to chase them. We endulge when we go for walks, and one time a squirrel ran up a tree, but was absolutely horrified when it turned around to see my 100lb golden malamute had followed it up the tree (about 8 feet in the air, dog was perched where the trunk split into two sections)

I'll never forget the shock on that squirrel's face. Lucky for him I don't let Fawkes catch the little buggers since I have zero interest in unnecessary vet bills."
aww,fcabr6j,t1_fc72b9o,1577566318.0,"Interestingly, I've noticed the way they check in can vary from breed to breed. I grew up with the field/American Labrador varient and have a looooong history of some pretty hard-core training with them, my last lab being the pinnacle of a well trained retriever. He was the first dog I managed to train to the point where commands were seldom vocal (most either eye/head movements and hand gestures, with a few vocal commands and some tongue clocks). After Gunner passed away at 16, I adopted Fawkes, who is a golden malamute (golden retriever malamute mix). He's probably the most gorgeous dog I've ever seen, and while the golden in him is super apparent, his personality and general behavior is way more malamute than retriever. I've had him for a year now and we have done a lot of work (he was a 2 year old rescue that had no training) and over the last year I've learned quite a bit about his body language and quirks. Now that we have very established routine and he's as familiar with my tone and body language, I've noticed over the last 6 months how differently he pays attention to what I'm doing. My labs traditionally would look back and check, usually slowing down a tad when they did. Offleash they would go ahead of me a short ways to make sure the trail was clear and then double back to check in, or bark to alert me somethings up ahead (usually a blackbears, we have a lot of them).

With Fawkes, he almost always has one or both ears pointed back at me, and if he does a visual check (not often) its only a quick side-eye, but he's always listening for my footsteps and commands. His Offleash behavior is pretty similar to my old labs. The most interesting difference I've noticed is that he is EXTREMELY receptive to directional commands (we have different tongue click patterns to indicate he needs to go left, right, slow down, speed up, and ""wait"" for stop)

I can only assume it's a characteristic of the malamute since they're bred to pull things, and a reason why no matter how much I train him, he will pull if he has a harness, but not with the usual pinch collar we use for a walk on the leash. 

I've had a few other breeds over the years by proxy (long term relationships that come with dogs) and trained all of them since apparently people fucking suck at this. The Shiba Inu was by far the most stubborn dog I've ever worked with (fucking diva) but he made huge improvements over time, hounds have rocks for brains, and Goldens are awesome, pretty similar to my labs, although slightly less neurotic about playing fetch *constantly* (my labs were beyond obsessive)


Anways, been fun learning some of the differences in how he pays attention to commands. Malamutes can be slightly less motivated with training than my labs were (labs saw it as a game rather than work) but damn if he isn't phenomenal with directional commands and paying attention to where we are going."
