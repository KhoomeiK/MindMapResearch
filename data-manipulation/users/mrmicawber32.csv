ShitAmericansSay,ffvah6k,t1_ffumcey,1580259527.0,"Depends where you go. San Fransisco has Excellent food and variety. Lincoln England does not. I've lived in both. But London is better than maybe Montana... I found that small business restaurants tend to be better in the US than in the UK. A local pizza place in California will be far better than most I've seen in the UK. However our chain restaurants are so much better than the likes of chillys, or olive garden. Pizza express is actually decent where as olive garden will make you sick. But the best pizza I get in Lincoln is fucking dominos, where's as US has amazing pizza. Bit of a rant sorry..."

insaneparents,ffv8cdr,t1_ffuilyj,1580258096.0,"So I agree with the sentiment, but as abortion was illegal in America not that long ago  parents may feel like they didn't have a choice. Hopefully this isn't the same for future generations, as all parents definitely decided to have their kid, regardless of religion or whatever, there was a choice."

ChoosingBeggars,ffv7fto,t1_ffsfxig,1580257483.0,"Ok so I think they are probably dick heads, however if ask them how many hours a week they are expecting. Cause if it's like 5-8 hours a week I'd consider it. When I rented a room I paid £450 a month, and earned like £1200 at the time after tax. So if I could do a 30 hour a week job, and do a few hours at this house I'd do it, if there was no rent or the rent was like £50 a month or something. Anyway it might not be as bad as you think."

nottheonion,ffu8g6f,t1_fftqniv,1580236683.0,"The point is that in the EU we don't wash chicken as it let's bad abattoirs get away with it, and can mean lax standards. Abattoirs have very high standards here, and we don't want your washed chicken at all. Not spoke to anyone that wants it, it sounds nasty that it needs it. If the US had the same standards of cleanliness as the EU, the  either washing chicken is pointless as the EU has low salmonella numbers, or the US is getting away with disgusting chicken because they wash it after."

Costs have spiralled, Guarenteed costs per kilowatt are much higher than wind solar and tidal. And that's without environmental concerns. It's really not worth it. A large battery grid mixed with large tidal and wind would make more sense."
television,ffrdmj5,t1_ffqg5i7,1580155918.0,"I think it's harder to sell this shit in the UK, as our advertising rules are fairly strict. If you wish to state something, there must be evidence to back it up. You can't say your chicken is the tastiest chicken, unless you have done a scientific study proving it. Famously carlsbergs beers tag line of ""probably the best beer in the world"" is ok, as it's ambiguous. However, there's no way you can say your oil shit cures anything unless there's scientific evidence that it does. Also fantastic you can only advertise over the counter medication."

I doubt your education was of a similar quality to that of a decent school, however I'm talking about society as a whole. Home schooling should be banned because it is not possible to control the quality. If you can't see that, and see it from a scientific perspective, then the quality of your teaching was not good."

insanepeoplefacebook,fficsh1,t1_ffi5mcj,1579970799.0,"Still shouldn't be allowed. Some people get shot end up being fine, many don't. Should definitely ban guns, and home schooling. If your mum's a qualified primary school teacher then maybe on til you're 11. But how can she teach secondary maths without a maths degree? English without and English degree? History without a history degree? Science without a science degree? There's a reason it's different people for the job. You're obviously not well educated and we'll adjusted if you don't see the massive flaw in home schooling, it's mental it was ever allowed."

However anyone that dies will be noticed. A bit of both sides happens, but 3% mortality seems high. Successful viruses don't kill their hosts off quite as often. Usually they either are highly contagious and low mortality, or high mortality low contagion. Just a maths thing. I wouldn't start panicking until the WHO declares an international emergency. As they haven't  the contagion rate is probably quite low, and with China's huge response we can hope that not vast numbers have gone overseas."

insanepeoplefacebook,ffhoz0j,t1_ffh2gc2,1579946165.0,"So homeschooling in general doesn't have the same standards as normal schooling, that's why it's bad. Obviously some will be ok, but most aren't. Private schools are bad because it makes the rich parents not care about the state of public schools, and how well funded they are. Of rich people's kids had to go to public schools, they would be better funded."
