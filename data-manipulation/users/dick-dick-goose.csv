I took what you said to mean that, since I care for them and about what happens to them, that I should take them home with me. I'm both NP and PA right now, just having acquired my PA license, until my NP expires.





What did you mean, if I misunderstood? Do you believe that me opening my home, in my off hours, would benefit addicts more than my professional input and effort in a Best Practices policy put together by a group of professionals would?"

science,ff0s9fv,t3_eqz8c4,1579471795.0,"We know to expect them when the weather is bad. Often they have chronic health issues, but they don't really meet admission criteria. They're fed, and given a chance to shower if possible, while lab results are pending. When they're discharged from our ER, they often make their way to another in the area. We now have a program that links hospitals that are not within the same organizations so that we can see when and where they were last seen, and get Social Work involved to find resources for these folks that aren't ER beds. We just can't handle the influx that has exploded over the past couple years. Since we started this program, we see the same faces much less often - and when we do, they're actually meeting admission criteria.





Now we need to find a way to stem the flow of repeat OD patients. Treating and releasing isn't cutting it. We need a pipeline to inpatient and outpatient recovery resources. But those are often cost prohibitive for the patients who need them, and many of those patients will need them for a while before even considering them."

>Disclaimer: didn’t happen today but happened recently.

>It started as a beautiful day. I had class all day and was looking forward eagerly to making the sex with my new girlfriend. Up until this point I had never dated/been with any partner who loved sex more than this lovely lady, and had only had the pleasure of placing my average sized rooster into her ham wallet a few times, we were newly dating. She was at her apartment, and was giving me signals via text that she required penis at the earliest opportunity available, so after my final lecture I quickly made my way to her residence for lovemaking.

Now she has another love in her life besides sex, this being her cat Jewel, a lovely female cat with a healthy curiosity and meow. I greet Jewel on my way into the apartment and then make my way into my girlfriend’s bedroom where she had been preparing for imminent penetration. 

At this time, my girlfriend had been experiencing skepticism over the birth control she was taking, claiming side effects. Because of this she had been off her pill and had agreed that we could forgo with condoms but it was an absolute MUST that I pull out and relieve my love goo onto a surface of her choice. I had demonstrated satisfactory control over my hydrant in the past and felt confident living up to this arrangement. Not saying I’m some sort of stud, but if I knew it was a cummin, I’d know.

So away we go, putting our genitalia together to achieve mutual rewards of dopamine. Her bedroom door is open during the act, as no other human being existed in the space at the time. But there was a being, Jewel. During all this, the usually vocal Jewel had come into the bedroom to inquire why I was on top of her mother with my chapped, white ass in the air. Confused as a cat must be, she got closer to investigate, arriving at a viewing location at the foot of the bed behind me, still I had no idea.

Oh! That feeling. It’s going to happen soon. I communicate to my girlfriend in the least sexy way possible that I’m close to arriving and the dam is about to burst. She understood the circumstances, and instructed that I relieve my reservoir onto her abdomen area. This seemed like a conservative choice in comparison to past locations for discharge she’s requested, but none the less it’s her call, that’s the arrangement, and consent is vital.

I pull my unimpressive rifle out of her tiny linen chest and raise the barrel towards the target, when suddenly Jewel arrives on the scene, viewing the opening between us as the perfect opportunity to get to the bottom of this. I didn’t have enough time to be shocked or adjust the shaft vector, as the flint had sparked and the bulk of my seed had left the tip. I’ll never forget Jewels beautiful eyes turning towards the payload at the wrong moment, and her face became the target of my biological attack.

The reaction was instant, Jewel grimaced, recoiled in horror as she bellowed out a defeated growl and ran away with the evidence all over her pretty face and whiskers. My girlfriend’s face was written in utter shock, like she had seen JFK being assassinated, and I knew I fucked up. I care so much for animals, and although it was unintentional I was mortified by the actions instigated by my cock. 

Without thinking, I jump off my girlfriend and run to comfort Jewel, who has taken refuge under the couch to reassess the damage. I wanted so bad to be able to communicate to her that I was so sorry and didn’t mean to Jizz on her, but all’s she saw was this man she barely knew running at her naked with a full mast after spreading a warm, unknown substance on to her.

To this day, although my girlfriend laughs at the whole matter, I still do not, as Jewel runs under that same couch every time I come over. Her eyes wide from the trauma of the event, and me crushed that I squandered a budding relationship with a lovely kitty. I cannot blame my Johnson, just the sad, broken man attached to it.

TL;DR i accidentally came onto my girlfriends cat who jumped between us during sex, now she hates me (the cat)

Edit: Shit! Thanks guys my inbox and notifications are going off the wall. I’m not new to reddit, new to posting just got an account, wanted to post on subs I’ve always enjoyed reading. Background info: Yes this happened yes I chose to write this with over the top vocabulary and long winded in nature because my favourite TIFU posts have used this style and I was half imitating, half mocking it. I also could be an entitled, pseudo-intellectual who likes to flex on the masses using inflated words. Or maybe I was trying to think of every sexual word I’ve ever heard in my life. Who knows really. I came on a cat so I’m really unsure about motives or just overall life goals"

The days spent recovering were difficult because I couldn't do much bedsides think and feel. So I made myself sleep through it. It was much easier to process the situation when I was back in the context of my real life.






So, go easy. Have some soup, some advil, and some melatonin and magnesium. Let yourself sleep. When you wake up, rinse and repeat. When you can't sleep right away, watch/read some light stuff. Once the cramping and bleeding is gone and you can be up and around, take a shower and get out of the house for a while. Even going to work will feel good."

I say that not to say look at me, but to say that those thoughts will come... and they will go. And they will come again, and they will go again. Whether the feeling with those thoughts is despair, frenzy, peace with where you are and no desire to risk future pain, anhedonia, or anything else - those feelings will come and go, and come and go again and again. If you need help getting out of the pit or over the hump (and often you will), then reach out. The only good thing about how common depression and thoughts of suicide are is that you absolutely know someone who's gone through it. And if you happen to reach out to someone who hasn't gone through it, well, they absolutely know someone who's gone through it. The more you reach out, the more likely you are to find help that suits your specific needs from the spectrum of therapy, medication, and crisis care - and specific considerations such as affordability and access. And the more likely you go on to become a grey-haired person at all. 







In the past 20 years, I've run the gamut from Medicaid with 6-month waits for appointments, to outright fraud with someone else lying to their doctor to get an antidepressant prescription to give to me, to no insurance and paying out of pocket but able to afford it, to fully insured with pocket-change copays. I've ""lost"" and gotten a new prescription for a 90-day supply of antidepressants to give to someone who was in need. I've asked for help, and in turn been able to provide help.
