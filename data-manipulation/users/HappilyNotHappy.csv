SuicidalPeople,ff9c9qj,t1_ff9bqfn,1579709711.0,"There’s gotta be something? 
If not I’ll try and give you actual advice now:
I understand why your depressed, I mean it’s normal to be upset after relationships. Think about it with a clear mind. You’ll feel alone now, but talk to your friends and family or someone you trust. Hang out with them for a bit. Try to enjoy yourself. You won’t feel mike this forever, Since I haven’t gone through a relationship, dating wise, I can’t truly say anything about it. However just do anything (safe and in reason though) that will give you relief. Eat your favorite food, watch videos of cute little pandas, play video games with friends or by yourself. Just do little thing that give you a bit of joy okay?"

tifu,ff9654v,t3_es489q,1579705752.0,"As many people are saying on here, you may possibly be hurting your kids more without going through a divorce. If you’ve genuinely tried to make your marriage to work and still you never resolved, you truly did everything you can. Hell it doesn’t even seem like she loves you. I know you’ll want to do anything for your kids and you’ll go through any torture for them, but listen, later in life (or even now possibly) they will understand. Let’s be honest, have you honestly done anything wrong in this situation? You’ve been faithful and worked to attempt to make things work instead of quitting and cheating. When your kids are mature they’ll understand. 
And if they notice you two aren’t getting along and then you separate and you both end up being happier, they will be happier too. All children want is love from both parents"
