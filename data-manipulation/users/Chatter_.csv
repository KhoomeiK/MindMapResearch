todayilearned,ffs08ja,t1_ffs03vf,1580169978.0,That made me chuckle. It’s funny cause it’s true.
modernwarfare,ffrulb6,t3_euue7a,1580166173.0,"I feel like once you get to a certain point, the sbmm stops working as good"
modernwarfare,ffqwywz,t3_euqa6f,1580145526.0,Welcome to the club
MGTOW,ffqfzrj,t1_ffq5qtn,1580133481.0,Cool. There are some me extremists in here who I’ve seen write that men shouldn’t even talk to a female. I think that’s a little far & that they need some help if they can’t even talk to the girl who are ringing up their groceries. Just beware & don’t let others or society dictate what you should be doing with your life.
MGTOW,ffq5kl6,t3_eulnll,1580121716.0,"Sure. You can be MGTOW at any age. It’s a something unique to each person. For me I still date frequently but no marriage, cohabitation, monogamy, or supporting a woman in any way."
modernwarfare,ffn4nkn,t3_eu9x5n,1580062045.0,"It’s wrong. In one mode, shows a spm but 0s for all the other categories."
nba,ffn3fu4,t1_ffn1zxj,1580061620.0,I posted the correct pronunciation
nba,ffn35z6,t3_eu9xzb,1580061537.0,"Yah-nis Ah-deh-too-koom-boh.

They had a pronunciation lesson in a game last year & I finally got it down so il play. I always just say Giannis though since I don’t have to take a split second to think while saying it. Also, Wikipedia has it wrong on his page."
modernwarfare,ffiuk6u,t3_etvgrk,1579983087.0,"That’s bs. I have demascus & the PKM, PP19, & AX are the only 3 guns I use now. I primarily play HC & Ima 24/7 pusher."

RobinHoodPennyStocks,ffiq6pb,t1_ffiia56,1579979969.0,Nah I was tryna be smart with it when I had less money into it. I would take small earnings & go rather than trying to maximize it. I’d take 5% & sell at 5% down. I’ve increased it to 10% either way now. I played the long game.
MGTOW,ffil43b,t1_ffijd3a,1579976465.0,Yep. Also make sure your locations & location sharing is turned off.
DunderMifflin,ffikkgh,t3_etty7m,1579976092.0,The last episode makes pushing thru season 9 worth it.
pussypassdenied,ffiik1j,t1_ffiifll,1579974711.0,You right bro. You got it. I’ll start posting up every woman being charged with a crime then.
pussypassdenied,ffii34j,t1_ffihsfx,1579974388.0,No. So everything in the world could be a pussy pass denied if that’s the case. A woman having to pay $3 for a gallon of milk just like a man & not getting it for free wouldn’t be pussy pass denied. She has to actually try to get something in order to be “denied” it.
pussypassdenied,ffihde5,t1_fficujf,1579973908.0,"But when was she trying to use the pussy pass? Anytime a woman is sentenced it’s considered pussy pass denied? I would think she would have to actually have to use her gender to get something or an advantage then denied just as a man would.

Women get preferential treatment though but just because a woman got a speeding ticket doesn’t make it pussy pass denied."
RobinHoodPennyStocks,ffibjvo,t1_ffgzbpt,1579969954.0,"This is the play. I’ve been day trading since I was 18, 29 now, & full time for the past 5 years. I’ve only had a couple times where I kept my money in long enough to make big profits. Yea I’ve missed out on a lot of money but I’ve also was up even more times when I could have easily lost if I stayed in a day or even 15 minutes longer. At the point now where 2% a week & I’ll hit my weekly goal."

pussypassdenied,ffi8srm,t1_ffi7o7f,1579968035.0,I’ve said this in a few posts but I think the mods gave up or are nonexistent. Ima create a random post & see what happens.
introvert,ffi8oyo,t3_ets306,1579967961.0,Look at the sky or trees swaying in the wind with a beer & a cigar with my dogs walking around. I live on about 10 acres so I’m secluded.
AskMen,ffi8ag1,t3_ets50g,1579967675.0,Got married & had kids. I’m good on both.
AmItheAsshole,ffi7y3u,t3_ets8ss,1579967432.0,"NTA. I’m the same way. I don’t have millions but getting towards my first in my late 20s. No one knows how much I have since I haven’t spent much besides my dream car. 

That’s your business. Don’t count another man’s pockets & don’t let them know how much you have under your mattress."
RobinHood,ffi287z,t1_ffi23dk,1579962923.0,Huh? To just deduct from the amount you’re already transferring? Seems like the most efficient way. But okay
RobinHood,ffi1xfl,t3_etrehh,1579962656.0,I think all companies charge to transfer money out to another. Some reimburse those charges like WeBull.
AtlantaHawks,ffgj208,t3_eti3ud,1579907374.0,Ummm... what? I doubt you’ll have much participation.
todayilearned,ffgiwh6,t3_eti4tl,1579907273.0,I think OP means improvised not improved.
MGTOW,ffgcb7m,t3_eth17f,1579903079.0,"I work out or doing something everyday. For the days I’m in a rush or don’t have time, I do a short pull up or chin up workout & the 6 minute abs. Can knock it all out in 15 minutes."
MGTOW,ffgb2kr,t3_eth3kt,1579902321.0,"Hopefully he raised this issue before they got engaged. If not she will could argue it was signed under duress since they already had future plans for the wedding. & yea you’re right, they don’t work. A judge can & do over rule any prenup agreement."

RobinHood,ffftgy8,t3_etelcd,1579891437.0,No stock is a 100% chance of profits.
RobinHoodPennyStocks,fffrew5,t3_ete3uu,1579890163.0,Investopedia.com & YouTube are great places to start. Could also look into a paper trading account to get the gist of how things work.
RobinHoodPennyStocks,fffm1p6,t1_fffljv2,1579886874.0,Offering price is .21 so it should go up a few more cents

AskMen,fffclk8,t1_fffc4le,1579880998.0,I was talking to a chick for a year before I went exclusive.
AmItheAsshole,fffarux,t3_etaue7,1579879839.0,NTA. I had 30 days after I graduated college to move out of my moms house. Ending up going to college early & renting a house with a friend. My siblings & I were raised to be independent & started working at 15 though so your household may be different.
modernwarfare,fff9ri6,t1_fff7clt,1579879192.0,I would just double kill melee with it or shoot one then melee on shipment.

modernwarfare,fff06lg,t3_et7qr6,1579871987.0,Could have just gone to shipment & bash in two folks head in a row. It was pretty easy for me. The Longshots were harder since I was doing them all on the wall in shoothouse.
FoodPorn,fff010t,t1_ffeno39,1579871848.0,It really does. Looks professionally made.
modernwarfare,ffezz3z,t1_ffezrox,1579871799.0,Oh I’ve used the same emblem & calling card since the first two weeks. & the blueprints mean nothing to me since I can make the same guns myself with demascus camo.
todayilearned,ffezjbr,t1_ffep86f,1579871400.0,Lol. He could have bought someone for 1/10th of that & not have her blabbing all over the internet.
