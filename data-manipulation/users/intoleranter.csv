AskReddit,ffeqh0t,t3_esy6i5,1579860418.0,"Story from a Moldovan guy I know: 

When he was a kid, he had to stand in line for hours to buy basic food. Lines were starting at 4 or 5 AM. Arriving at 7 AM was a guarantee to find empty stores or cans of beans (at most).There was a paper card that the store seller would fill in how much you bought of your allowed monthly ration. You had to bring your own milk bottles and turn them in, in exchange for full milk bottles. There was a ration for everything, including olives and bread. There were no doctors' appointments. You just went to the hospital and brought in eggs, cigarettes, bars of soap and towels in your bag. A nurse would prioritise people based on what they brought for the doctor, sometimes they would steal a bar of soap or a towel to keep for themselves. Cigarettes and coffee were valued as best bribes (good cigarettes were hard to find, most of the usual smokes came without any kind of filter). It was illegal to brew your own alcohol, but most people did it anyway. It was illegal to buy gold from the gypsies,  although very few places sold any jewels. The police would come pick you up any time they wanted, for any bogus reasons, without telling your family where they'd take you or for how long you'll be held. If you were ever released, you'd be too beaten and too broken. Sometimes you would just ""disappear"" or ""suicide"". Orphan kids would be sold to Americans or Germans looking to adopt, although some other kids would be also kidnapped and sold in the Western world for organ harvesting, bone marrow and blood donations.

800 calories is not sustainable in the long run, and you will have binges that will do a lot of damage. Around 1100 would be more plausible to be sustainable. 

If you go to the gym, split the time like 20 minutes cardio, 40 minutes weight exercises. You won't gain any muscle with those 1100 calories (I know that's a worry for females). 
Don't go to the gym every day, you'll burn out before you lose the weight. 
Do 1 day gym, 1 day light jog, and figure out a way to fit in 1-2 rest days per week. 

Cut down bread and sugar. 
Don't get dehydrated (consider electrolytes). 

Don't starve yourself, or you'll gain it back very fast. 

In kilos, 1.5 kilos per week would be a good rate of dropping, considering your starting weight. Don't strive to drop too fast. The negative effects certainly can outweigh the benefits, including loose skin and ugly skin marks.

This was said by an ex.

Long story short, she was nice at first. Then I cheated, because I was a scumbag back then. Then she hit me, multiple times, on multiple ocasions, when she would remember what I did, although after she found out, I never cheated again (ever. Not on her, not on the future girlfriends). I actually loved her, or it would be fair to say I started loving her after she found out I cheated. But after I cheated, she started being horrible to me overall. Always picking fights, always criticising everything I did. So I eventually broke up with her, because there was no way any of us would manage to be happy anymore. Then she started trying to manipulate me to get back together, which I always rejected. Then she just texted me ""I hate you"". I never replied. After all I did to her, it was the only time she said she hated me and I took it seriously. 

She hasn't contacted me since. I know she's doing well profesionally but is still single almost 17 years later.
