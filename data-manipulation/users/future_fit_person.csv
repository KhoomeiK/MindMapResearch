Similarly, fasting isn’t inherently disordered - the disordered behavior is *compulsively* fasting because of one’s obsessions/fears around food and weight."

fatlogic,fenjg1q,t1_femgyj8,1579285994.0,"Isn't the primary mark of an eating disorder emotional disturbance and compulsiveness around food? From what I've read, people with eating disorders have compulsions to engage in their behaviors, which are linked to extreme emotional reactions to what they do or don't eat. Whereas this is not the case with diets or lifestyle changes. Non-disordered people may often make impulsive food choices but don't experience the kinds of compulsions to binge or not eat or purge that people with eating disorders do. I've certainly made impulsive food choices, but would not say I have ever had any food related compulsions. Food choices and weight have also never had an impact on my emotions, either positively or negatively."

Eg, try 24 or 26 or 30 hours or something. Don't decide to ""fast for as long as I can"" because that will lead you to feel like you are failing when you eat and that's not healthy.

Speaking of planning, haveyou tried pre-planning and pre-prepping your meals? Evidence shows that people make better food choices when they do it ahead of time instead of making a decision on the spur of the moment when they are about to eat or are hungry. If you haven't it might help to try coming up with a meal plan for the week that will have you losing weight without being too extreme or leaving you unsatisfied, so you aren't making impulsive choices."

After around 5-10 days it is recommended that you not break it with carbs, and for very long fasts breaking it with bone broth is the most gentle option. I haven't done a fast longer than 7 days and I never have used bone broth, I just avoid carbs the first day.

Edit: if you have been fasting for 40 days, I think starting with bone broth is the best idea. I don't know the discussion you had with your doctor about sweet potato, but with long fasts like this there is a risk, though small, of refeeding syndrome, which if I understand correctly is primarily caused by eating too much in particular too many carbs too soon. Again, I am not a medical professional but the most cautious course of action would probably be taking both carbs and solids slowly by just having bone broth for a few meals, then have some low carb solid foods, and then reintroducing carbs."

And almost everyone ought to be fasting at least 12 hours most nights. IF is just a schedule for when you are or aren't eating and EFs are temporary events, not something you constantly do.
