If you run you can get things set up so you don't have to bring a phone with you to track your run and listen to music. Basically, set up a playlist on your phone then move that same playlist onto your watch. It can take awhile to transfer over. Then connect your earphones directly to the watch via bluetooth. So I have the Nike + app tracking my workout and the music app playing music. 

Also, getting and responding to messages on the watch is way less obvious in meetings than pulling your phone out.
