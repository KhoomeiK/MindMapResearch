For example, parents are much morelikely to live within a few miles of their children than a thousand milesaway orhalfway aroundthe world. So the model studied here is too simple to be directly applicable to the evolution ofmankind as a whole. In such complicated situations, the results sound a note of caution: if thelogarithmic time to CA’s seems patently implausible, then at least one of the assumptions ofthe model, such as the random mating assumption, must be causing a great deal of trouble.On the other hand, it would be interesting to know whether there are simpler real-lifesituations in which the assumptions of the model do apply reasonably well and the theoremsprovide reasonably accurate quantitative descriptions.

>Joseph T. Chang has proposed that in a large, well mixed population of size N, we only have to go 1.77 log2(N) generations in the past to find the time when everyone in the population (who left descendants) is an ancestor to the entire population.[1] For example, a population of 4,000 individuals would, on average, have a most recent common ancestor about 13 generations earlier and an IAP about 24 or 25 generations earlier.[1] **This model assumes random mate choice and is unrealistic for the human population, where geographic obstacles have greatly reduced mixing across the entire population.[1]**

>The identical ancestors point for Homo sapiens has been the subject of debate. In 2004, Rohde, Olson and Chang showed through simulations that the Identical Ancestors Point for all humans is surprisingly recent, on the order of 5,000-15,000 years ago. Ralph and Coop (2013), considering the European population and working from genetics, came to similar conclusions for the recent common ancestry of Europeans.[2][3][4]

>All living people share exactly the same set of ancestors from this point back, all the way to the very first single-celled organism.[2] However, people will vary widely in how much ancestry and genes they inherit from each ancestor, which will cause them to have very different genotypes and phenotypes. This is illustrated in the 2003 simulation as follows: Considering the ancestral populations alive at 5000 BC, close to the ACA point, a modern day Japanese person will get 88.4% of his ancestry from Japan, and most of the remainder from China or Korea, with only 0.00049% traced to Norway; conversely, a modern-day Norwegian will get over 92% of his ancestry from Norway (or over 96% from Scandinavia) and only 0.00044% from Japan. Thus, even though the Norwegian and Japanese person share the same set of ancestors, these ancestors appear in their family tree in dramatically different proportions. A Japanese person in 5000 BC with present-day descendants will likely appear trillions of times in a modern day Japanese person's family tree, but might appear only one time in a Norwegian person's family tree. A 5000 BC Norwegian person will similarly appear far more times in a typical Norwegian person's family tree than he will appear in a Japanese person's family tree.[5]

>What's particularly fascinating about this is that we in the present day can actually change who our most recent common ancestor was. After all, the estimate that the MRCA lived only two or three millennia ago, long after humans became isolated on far distant continents, only works because of the globalization of the last 500 years. The theory is that enough European explorers intermarried with the various indigenous populations of the places they colonized so that, over time, even the most isolated groups become linked into the overall family tree.

>This is a controversial theory, particularly since there are still thought to be a handful of uncontacted groups in South America and southwest Asia. If these peoples - each group of which only numbers about two hundred or so - really have remained completely cut off from other humans for millennia, then that would force the most recent common ancestor back to the Upper Paleolithic, anywhere from 40,000 to 10,000 years ago.

>We can at least say this: in 2011, it's possible but not proven that the MRCA dates back to a surprisingly recent date, anywhere from 8,000 to 2,000 years ago. In 1511, before European exploration had really begun in earnest, the MRCA was still unquestionably an individual who lived in the Upper Paleolithic. And, by 2511, the current trends in globalization suggest that everyone will definitely share a recent MRCA...and one that gets more recent with each passing generation as more and more lineages mix.

So, they'd probably be related at some point before they migrated from Siberia (say, 25K years ago), up until the time of European contact.  They were a mix of European and East Asian peoples.

> • Genetics demonstrates that humans cannot be divided into biologically distinct subcategories. Although there are clear observable correlations between variation in the human genome and how individuals identify by race, the study of human genetics challenges the traditional concept of different races of humans as biologically separate and distinct. This is validated by many decades of research, including recent examples.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

> • Most human genetic variation is distributed as a gradient, so distinct boundaries between population groups cannot be accurately assigned. There is considerable genetic overlap among members of different populations. Such patterns of genome variation are explained by patterns of migration and mixing of different populations throughout human history.7 In this way, genetics exposes the concept of “racial purity” as scientifically meaningless.

> • It follows that there can be no genetics-based support for claiming one group as superior to another. Although a person’s genetics influences their phenotypic characteristics, and self-identified race might be influenced by physical appearance, race itself is a social construct. Any attempt to use genetics to rank populations demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of genetics.

Everyone has long agreed that human beings are a single inter-breeding species, and have been for thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of years. To sort a species into sub-species, it is necessary to have biological variation AND a way to group that variation. We have biological variation. The problem comes in establishing the ways variation clumps, groups, or sorts into subsets.

>Why? The authors highlight just how many social differences could be discerned by forensic anthropologists. Given an original sample of bones classified into social groups, a forensic anthropologist can with high probability predict to which group another case of bones belong. They can separate Japanese from Chinese from Vietnamese, or northern Japanese from southern Japanese. Or, and perhaps most incredibly, “white males born between 1840 and 1890 can be separated from white males born 1930 to 1980 very well, and they are distinguished by time, and would appear to qualify as different races” (2009:74).

>Because the environment generally changes gradually as latitude/longitude changes, most phenotypic variation in humans is clinally distributed across geographic space. As a result, human phenotypes vary in frequency across a range of populations, and are not simply present or absent by population or continent. This is true even for aspects of human variation that have been seen as closely associated with race, such as facial features, skin color and hair type. For example, skin color, a trait traditionally associated with racial categories, is a product of long-term evolution involving more than 37 genetic loci, local environmental factors, migrations and gene flow among populations. As such, skin color shows a clinal distribution that cannot be separated into disparate categories. Similar phenotypes have arisen in both closely and distantly related groups adapting to similar environments, including genetic variants for light skin pigmentation which have, for example, evolved both within and outside the continent of Africa.

>Like human genetic variation, phenotypic variation in our species does not follow racial lines. Race constitutes an arbitrary and artificial division of continuous variation, and thus does not provide an accurate representation of human phenotypic variation or population similarities and differences.

O. Wilson then challenged the concept from the perspective of general animal systematics, and further rejected the claim that ""races"" were equivalent to ""subspecies"".[67]

>Human genetic variation is predominantly within races, continuous, and complex in structure, which is inconsistent with the concept of genetic human races.[68] According to Jonathan Marks,[38]

>By the 1970s, it had become clear that (1) most human differences were cultural; (2) what was not cultural was principally polymorphic – that is to say, found in diverse groups of people at different frequencies; (3) what was not cultural or polymorphic was principally clinal – that is to say, gradually variable over geography; and (4) what was left – the component of human diversity that was not cultural, polymorphic, or clinal – was very small.

>**The word “race” is not commonly used in the non-human biological literature.** Evolutionary biologists have many words for subdivisions within a species (Templeton, 2006). At the lowest level are demes, local breeding populations. Demes have no connotation of being a major subdivision or type within a species. In human population genetics, even small ethnic groups or tribes are frequently subdivided into multiple demes, whereas “race” always refers to a much larger grouping. Another type of subdivision is “ecotype”, which refers to a group of individuals sharing one or more adaptations to a specific environment. Sometimes the defining environmental variable is widespread, so an ecotype can refer to a large geographical population. However, sometimes the environmental heterogeneity can exist on a small geographical scale. In such circumstances, a single local area with no significant genetic subdivision for almost all genes can contain more than one ecotype (e.g., Oberle & Schaal, 2011). Ecotypes are therefore not universally a major subdivision or type within a species, but sometimes merely a local polymorphism. Ecotypes cannot define “race” in a manner applicable to all species, and whether or not ecotypes can define human races will be addressed later. Of all the words used to describe subdivisions or subtypes within a species, the one that has been explicitly defined to indicate major geographical “races” or subdivisions is “subspecies” (Futuyma, 1986, pg. 107–109; Mayr, 1982, pg. 289). Because of this well-established usage in the evolutionary literature, “race” and “subspecies” will be regarded as synonyms from a biological perspective. In this manner, human “race” can be placed into a broader evolutionary context that is no longer species-specific or culturally dependent."

A lot of the people calling for his head were targeting him because they are ideologically racist against white people. It's a special kind of hypocrisy since they are accusing him of racism, which is what I was trying to point out.

So, they're assholes.  Too.

The reason that they feel it is acceptable to be assholes is because they feel that they are the plucky rebels, and white guys are the evil empire.  That's all I was really getting at.  

Feeling oppressed is time and again the main reason people feel justified in being assholes.

That story is ingrained in us:  The good guys can do no wrong, the bad guys can do no right.

When that one Taiwanese guy was shitty to that foreigner, Taiwanese people were like ""That guy does not represent Taiwanese people; he's a piece of shit.  We are ashamed that he is Taiwanese, and we are ashamed that we have underlying racism that allowed this to happen.""

That's the proper response.

""White people can be racist, too!"" would not have been the proper response."
China,ffail3s,t1_ff9s1wb,1579736596.0,"> No one would care if Morgan was Asian and therefore the people making a big deal of this are just as if not more racist than Morgan. Prove me wrong. 

I'll give it a shot, but I'm not even sure what you are saying, exactly.  That no one would care if an Asian person mocks the Chinese language?

I'll go with that.

White people might not care, but someone probably would.  

What if it was a Japanese person making fun of Chinese people?  Chinese people might certainly care that they are being made fun of!  

And decent Japanese people might say ""Man, that one Japanese guy is an asshole for making fun of you.  Not all Japanese people are assholes like that guy!  He's the worst.""

I think that would be the correct response to an asshole who makes fun of other people.

Edit:  And, if the point is, then, ""Why does no one stick up for white guys when people make fun of them?""  

I've realized that it's not really about *PC culture,* or any of that stuff, really.   ""Racism = privilege plus power"" isn't an axiom, even if some people take it as one.  It's an observation.

 It's really about how we tell stories.  David versus Goliath.  A band of plucky rebels versus the evil empire.  

The *little guy* overcoming the odds and beating the Big Bad is a fundamental element of our myths and stories.  People root for the little guy.  Almost instinctively.

In places where white guys aren't the little guys?  Where they *are* considered the big bad guys (because, obviously, historically they have had the power, were thus the oppressors)?   

They're not seen as the underdogs.  People don't root for them to win.
