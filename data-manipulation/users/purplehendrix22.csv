MMA,ffsq7uy,t1_ffspmir,1580188655.0,"Yeah exactly, like rookie contracts in the nfl, if you sign and then blow up and start crushing it, it doesn’t mean you get paid more until you get a new contract. Like you’re saying with Conor the money is there for him and the UFC so there’s no point to either of them *not* making a deal, they all make money when Conor fights and they only make more each time, except for maybe the last, would expect a drop off after the lay off but I’m not sure of the exact numbers, no doubt it sent him right back into stardom though, and he took 0 damage so that won’t affect negotiations in terms of time."
MMA,ffspalk,t1_ffsoy7n,1580187818.0,"Exactly, everyone knows how many fights Conor has on his contract doesn’t really matter given his position in the division and his popularity, the UFC wants him to fight as much as possible and will until his body falls apart. Unlike the prelim guys that are fighting tooth and nail for another fight or two on the contract, Conor knows no matter how many times he fights he’ll always get offered another, it’s all about pay now."
MMA,ffsnjuh,t1_ffsj3w3,1580186320.0,"You’re absolutely right but I think for someone to get to where Conor is in his career he must have a very trusting relationship with his manager and maybe they’re at the point where he just lets him handle that, it’s worked beautifully so far"
