depression,fdqnhc8,t3_emnl5m,1578670813.0,I can’t even fucking express how true this is. This really hit me hard.
depression,fdnsde1,t3_emcz0i,1578591868.0,"Zoloft was my very first medication. It didn’t help me at all. It made me feel empty and I would get a lot of headaches. I took it for a month, then quickly changed to Prozac (and so on :/). With meds it’s a process, you probably know that. If it doesn’t help after a month, consider trying another medication. Though, have hope. You’ll find the right one."

I think maybe your friend might have been raised to think of mental illness that way. Some cultures and many parents in grave into their kids and people heads that mental illness is stupid, a waste of time and energy, it is so easy to be happy type thing. Maybe even she herself suffers from something that she forces to tell herself that being sad and depressed is pointless and it shouldn’t be happening. I wouldn’t blame her for thinking that way, for some people saying those things really do help them, and they probably think it helps everyone to think “legit smile and be happy it’s so easy lol” and they’ll immediately get over it. 

Anyways, my best advice is to have a very civil discussion about this topic and really try to understand her point of view. Hell, you might even help her realize how depression and mental health awareness is an important matter. If she avoids talking about the subject, maybe there’s some pain or embarrassment she feels talking about the subject and I suggest trying to help her with it (if there’s a problem I mean). If your friend refuses to care about the fact that you’re depressed, I might have to tell you to find new friends. But that’s only if she really puts no effort into understanding your struggles. That’s just not what friends do. I know it’s not easy to make friends for some, but being the best you can be can only be achieved if you're surrounded by people that see the real you and respect you when you’re down. You want to be real, so hangout with real. Friendships are equal. There is no “lol don’t care about your feelings” or “i don’t like that you’re depressed it’s stupid” it’s “i love you and support you no matter what!”. Know your worth and value.

Much love and support always. sorry if this didn’t make sense. I ramble too much. :)"
depression,fdmualu,t3_em7ni5,1578566118.0,"I understand what you’re going through, I really do. It’s good to be aware of your feelings, and asking for some help in understanding those feelings shows that you still do care about the changes that are happening to you mentally and physically. I’m no doctor, and I can’t really tell you a yes or no if you’re depressed, but what I can tell you is that (maybe) realizing how fake high schoolers are really hit you harder than you think. I know it did for me when I found my sophomore year of high school. Everything in high school nowadays is a popularity competition, a beauty pageant, the fucking Olympics, I am the next Albert Einstein type of bullshit. Maybe the friends and people you normally hang around aren’t the best. Maybe you want to be more, you want to feel a sense of purpose, or you want to feel like you belong; you don’t want to be like the others. And when you realize that you’re not much like the other teens, it just means you’ve matured enough, maybe even to the point where you can say “god, I’m so over the high school, these kids blow ass.” Without realizing, now this is what happened to me, you started to isolate, disconnect from hobbies, lost interest in the things you used to enjoy because you just don’t really see the point. You’ve reached the “don’t care much, I’m bored.” Correct me if I’m wrong tho, I just feel a vibe from you that this might be the case. But enough of this lame ramble.

The best advice I can give to you is to organize, take a day and really think about the things you don’t like, about the things you just want to change, redo, etc. And start a new one. Maybe you're bored with your current life, bored of the people you thought you knew, you need a fresh start. Try new things, find real friends, be yourself; you want real, so be real. We all need real. Don’t let your grades drop, because then you’ll lose more motivation and you’ll start feeling bad. Watch the way you handle yourself, and if you feel like you are not getting any better, seek help from your family, or call your doctor and tell them how you’re feeling. They’ll be able to send you to someone who can help you. Plus, most schools provide guidance to help. It’s hard to feel motivated, I know it is. But one doesn’t want to go downhill. I know you can do it, you’re strong. You have meaning.

I hope this helped. The way I think doesn’t make sense so sorry if this is confusing. My love and support always."
