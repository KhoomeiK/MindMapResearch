Except not being draftable doesn't exclude you from participating in war, but being a man DOES exclude you from carrying to term and giving birth. Even for the sake of starting an argument it's already flawed, because he's not even eligible for draft on 2 layers. And the draft is a legal construct, pregnancy is a biological one.

 You yourself said:

""His argument is that it is silly to rule out an entire class of people from having a relevant opinion just because they are not directly affected.""

War directly affects everyone, constantly, at all times. Women and men are both the primary progenitors and victims of war.

""The *point* was for people to disagree with it to show how stupid of an argument it is for both topics.""

 But the point is that people think him equating these is stupid. Discussion of the topic of abortion should include both parents, but ultimately it comes down to the woman's sole decision whether to have one or not, and a man should have zero control on whether the abortion is performed or not. Influence yes, control, no. People don't even agree that both sides of the analogy are ridiculous.

""It's like telling someone who favored marijuana legalization before any state thought about legalizing that ""the laws are clear: marijuana is illegal and the courts agree with me.""

Except marijuana was never a human rights issue, was never the focus of a constitutional amendment, has never gone to the supreme court, and most likely never will.

""When did anyone do this?""

""Even the most inequivalent things can have similarities. That is how analogies work. It is silly to just jump in and overextend the analogy until it breaks, unless you can explain why the analogy should be extended that far."" 

""My point isn't even about whether Stefan's argument is a good one. My point is that it *is* an analogy for the sake of argument.""

""he doesn't place everything between qualifiers, he just makes his point.""

""He is comparing silly arguments""  
If his comparison isn't even good, then how is he exemplifying that both arguments are silly? That's the point of the contention. The fact that his analogy provoked argument doesn't give it any merit."
therewasanattempt,fcyzzrc,t1_fcyv3z3,1578090851.0,"> men should also be able to give birth in the abortion debate 

No, because it's about men having a say in whether or not a woman can have an abortion, not whether men can have an abortion. Highlight what's actually being said first instead of inferring the impossible. 

> The abortion debate is much, much more than just a woman's bodily autonomy. 

maybe, but the legal precedent isn't. Roe v Wade is cut and clear. Weren't you the one who said that ""It's only when that goes into legislation that it becomes a problem."", especially when the entire argument in the first place is concerning legal prerogatives?

> It is silly to just jump in and overextend the analogy until it breaks 

It's silly to pretend that an analogy is the end all be all to an argument and then refer back to simplicity when is buckles under scrutiny. 

> unless you can explain why the analogy should be extended that far 

Do I really need to explain that war can be done by anyone against anyone, and everyone can commit it and participate in it with one of the most expansive causes of death and despair on a global scale with a massive death toll (this point further exemplified by the fact that the woman in the original post was a a war profiteer), as opposed to abortion where only a percentage of females who are able to conceive in the first place, carry the baby to a term where pregnancy is even recognizable, and then make the conscious decision to abort it (who's death toll only counts if you even consider abortion murder in the first place), thus explaining why the topic of war is above and beyond anything that abortion could even hope to reach in terms of egregiousness?"
