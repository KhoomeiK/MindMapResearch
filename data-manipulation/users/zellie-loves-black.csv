PublicFreakout,ffdmwtp,t3_eswm73,1579824286.0,"Had the same thing happen to me. Was at a Walmart for a pit stop and I was speaking Spanish to my Gramma in the bathroom when all of a sudden this fat ass lady was yelling at me and lecturing em on why it’s rude to speak a foreign language while other’s were around, and that since this is America, you should only speak English. It hurt me so much, I understand how awful racial and ethnic discrimination is. I feel sorry and pity for those who have to bear through it, if only we all accepted each other."

My dad actually recently discovered a channel that has no ads, but instead switches from one game to another since it’s live, whereas normally commercials would show. I forgot the name unfortunately but I think it’s a clever way to fill the commercial time and make it more interactive. I don’t know if this is a feature from Xfinity but whatever, I like it."

One day, at around twilight, I was playing with my dog Rex and enjoying the usual when I saw this big ass scorpion on the front porch. Two year old me did not know it was a scorpion, and proceeded to pick it up thinking it was a CRAB. I told my dad to come over because I found a “desert crab”and when he saw it, he freaked out and killed it. I cried cuz I thought he killed an innocent crab., but little did I realize it was actually a dangerous critter. I swear that’s not even the last thing I’ve done that’s almost killed me, but it’s probably the dumbest. (Note it was my first time seeing a scorpion)"

As long as a guy’s personality, loyalty, and morality outshines his entire character, i’d settle for him. It’s pretty embarrassing for me to see other girls reject men/other people simply because of height.  Remember, personality is the most important quality of a person, no matter how rich or poor, how pretty or handsome, or in this case, how tall or short. Find that special someone who loves you for who you are!"
