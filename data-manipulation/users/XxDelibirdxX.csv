depression,ffaooub,t3_esl0aj,1579740904.0,"I feel you. I've started referring to it as ""other friends"" (made a post about it the other day on here) basically one is under the impression they have friends and all but these people dont actually care for you as much as you them, you get excluded from their plans with their ""real friends"" and you just feel like they tolerate you for whatever reason. Sucks and sure cry it helps you sleep trust me because that's what I've done the past few days. You can always try asking them why they did not ask you it could give you closure"
depression,ffao8bk,t3_esl0no,1579740591.0,I'm in the UK and if you want your pills and help you need to refer yourself to therapy (?unless you want to pay for it) a doctor will not diagnose but they will gladly issue pills to you
relationship_advice,ffansxj,t3_esl5c2,1579740303.0,I didn't walk but I traveled by train for about 3 hours. If you like the person that much then it's how long is a piece of string
relationship_advice,ffank9m,t3_esl5yu,1579740141.0,"As someone who's been cheated on we are aware new interest is a different person and if we have chosen to have a relationship again we are ready to trust. Be honest and communicate well, alot of reassurance and all will be well"
relationship_advice,ff1ldi7,t1_ff1l45p,1579481064.0,As I said just communicate with them saying that it makes you feel insecure and they should come to some agreement about it. My sister and her husband message each other every minute they are apart and that works for them but for me I like my space as does my partner just means we can talk about our days and stuff when together
relationship_advice,ff1kxvh,t1_ff1k8jf,1579480851.0,"Mines on his phone like 24/7 he sees. Definitely not, I mean of it bothers you bring it up. I have an s9 and when I swipe a message away like while I'm busy to sort later I forget as although unread there is no unread message icon on my messages app if you get what I mean so it's like there is no message. As I said if you think it's a problem there is never any harm in honest communication  but it's likely all innocent"
relationship_advice,ff1jpxd,t3_er4xue,1579480286.0,"Haha 2 hours? Mines been away for 9 days and after getting there safe it was 2 or 3 days before a few messages. Tbf I never really messaged them either but that's just how we are. Loads of reasons for to reply, wouldn't take it personally"
relationship_advice,feq6ilk,t3_eqe4s1,1579338216.0,"If you cannot trust the guy you should not be with him. I'm not going to play the blame game but him doing things and hiding things that knowingly upset you is downright disrespectful ontop of damaging your mental health. 
    You can attempt to re build trust with them if you wish but its not going to be easy at all, my partner cheated and we spent a long time rebuilding our relationship, its doable but it's a massive mental strain"
offmychest,fejf2qx,t3_ep4fz5,1579171062.0,"My dad owns a restaurant and I have eaten there twice. I tend to go elsewhere when I'm in town, he made a joke last time we were over that I did not like his cooking, to be honest hes a great chef but I prefer to cook myself"
offmychest,fe71bz5,t1_fe6mx48,1578908704.0,I feel this. But it goes in waves. Sometimes affectionate and others completely ignored
offmychest,fe712p0,t3_enrwa2,1578908587.0,"Alot! I mean I've been having a hard time mentally and struggling but I do bot feel like I can confide and speak to anyone of my friends or family about it. Honestly I feel like a burden and putting my issues on people who, outside our mutual interests, probably do not give a damn and it sure as hell hurts"
secretsanta,fc8612h,t1_fc7yj49,1577527650.0,"I actually did still have the receipt hallelujah! When I used to send before I had a book that I stapled receipts too with who had what sent and had a complete stamp when I had them saying it had been received which I kept (on my accountants instruction) for 5 years, so I did think it was weird I had not kept this one but it was in my files then whole time so all is good, I have all the proof and its undeniable that it was posted, sent and signed for their end. I just worry because it is in my nature to be very careful and anal about these things, once bitten twice shy you know"
secretsanta,fc84inp,t1_fc7ss8x,1577526708.0,I have sent photos of the packages destination and period that it was signed for. I may bor have rh receipt anymore though
relationships,fc6xlou,t1_fc6x2hy,1577492107.0,Alarm bells! 100% do not move in with her again. Who knows where the line is for this chick? I'm all for sharing and helping but damn girl! Nice lingerie isnt cheap
secretsanta,fc6xf0z,t1_fc6wjvc,1577491971.0,"You went out your way to gift a stranger and spread a little joy. Even if they don't say it thank you for being awesome, try not to worry :)"
secretsanta,fc6x4dc,t1_fc6x2sf,1577491752.0,I added a tracking code
secretsanta,fc6x1y2,t1_fc6vq5g,1577491702.0,I've been super busy and I thanked mine once when it arrived and again in the gallery when I opened
relationship_advice,fc6wx2x,t3_egj226,1577491603.0,Of course not! I feel like if you are together 24/7 you need time because what the hell would you talk about?  I do not live with my partner of 5 years because we both run on different schedules and it works for us but people say its weird.. we have only ever had like 3 fights 2 of which we sorted straight away. I believe with our separate interests it gives us something that's just ours and its important not selfish at all
relationships,fc6wj3b,t3_egj2bm,1577491317.0,Lace a pair with something? Maybe she will stop. Its disgusting and disrespectful
secretsanta,fc6w30w,t3_egizr5,1577490992.0,"I'm in the same position as you. I sent recorded and have proof of them receiving too. We are not out to prove anything to people, I did my bit and made an effort if they are not happy that's on them"
offmychest,fc2kmba,t1_fc2kcsw,1577364953.0,"Me either, I'm not disagreeing just saying, I know people who have done it and such. I would find it WAY too weird"
