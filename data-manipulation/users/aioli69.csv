dating_advice,ffk38yz,t1_ffk342n,1580014450.0,He seriously does not seem worth it. Try to stop stressing about it because you can’t read his mind. Try and do something to distract yourself from the situation
dating_advice,ffk31hr,t1_ffk2xhc,1580014267.0,"I’ve been in this situation before when I was your age. If he wanted to text you then he would, he wouldn’t leave you on read. That’s not something people do when they want to be in a relationship. He’s not worth your time or energy. You will find someone better."
dating_advice,ffk2uyi,t1_ffk2lpr,1580014106.0,I already said it in my first comment. It seems like he just wants sex or something sexual. Hence the FWB part.
dating_advice,ffk2j4n,t1_ffk2eit,1580013817.0,A relationship with him. He has all the tell tale signs of someone wanting FWB
dating_advice,ffk2dh7,t1_ffjzkux,1580013681.0,Don’t get your hopes up
cats,ffjzjn3,t3_eu1f1e,1580011283.0,Feel better Mia!
cats,ffjzipa,t3_eu0s8c,1580011262.0,Do not move. You have been blessed.
dating_advice,ffjzdvz,t1_ffjpn28,1580011158.0,This is very typical of someone who wants sex. If he liked you he would show you and respect you. He’s keeping you on “the hook” - I know from experience. It sucks but you have to move on and keep him just a friend.
AskWomen,ffjy5p7,t3_etxjwg,1580010182.0,I was not looking for anyone. I had spent my teens looking for “the right one” and once I stopped and enjoyed being with myself I was able to find it. We started working at the same place and instantly loved him - as a friend at first and then it developed into a long term serious relationship. We live together and have a happy little family now!
relationship_advice,ff7i2mu,t3_ertsws,1579650051.0,"My (26f) boyfriend (28m) finds it insanely sexy when I am wearing ANYTHING baggy and comfortable. 

Maybe you could offer to wear his? 

Also, maybe he just isn’t the one. He doesn’t sound very nice to you and 3 months in he should be on his best behaviour!"
facepalm,fen6ghx,t1_femccqr,1579278018.0,Proclaim them as a genius. Or they will revolt.
television,fen68oa,t3_eq0osp,1579277883.0,I need to watch this now. Just so I can join in on the comments.
MakeupAddiction,fen5fpf,t3_eptx05,1579277377.0,This is amazing!!!! Way to take your mistake and roll with it! You are talented.
dating_advice,fen5cal,t1_femzqbm,1579277315.0,"Do you mind saying where you live? Doctors where I am from check for it always, as medication helps manage it."
dating_advice,fen558k,t3_epzxt1,1579277189.0,"Wow. Telling you upfront says a lot about her character. Personally, I would never want to risk my health, but that is something everyone needs to determine themselves. If you truly like this girl and connect with her you could always go out with her and see how you feel. Just because you go on a date doesn’t mean you owe her a second or third, or need to hook up. If you do really like her there are ways to protect yourself from getting it as well. I would suggest listening to your gut in this case. I can only imagine how hard it would be to have to tell someone you have herpes so make sure you are honest and upfront with her as well."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fen4m04,t3_epy6ou,1579276851.0,Omg! The little guy is such a jerk! I can not believe they are scared of him
MakeupRehab,fen4af8,t3_epwru2,1579276650.0,Yes please add pictures! I need to do this.. I have so much makeup that I need to downsize without throwing out perfectly good makeup. I am *trying* not to purchase more makeup... but that doesn’t mean I want to throw out what I have!
