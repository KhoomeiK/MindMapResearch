DontFundMe,femn0lz,t3_eplnef,1579263200.0,There should be a subreddit devoted to offering these people jobs and seeing what they say.
Filmmakers,fegc70s,t1_feg508b,1579087232.0,This is what I meant to say in the original comment.

Filmmakers,fefi9xd,t3_eot9lr,1579056889.0,"Or just be a decent person and clean up. That's something you don't need a permit for...

Edit: I was definitely misunderstood. I mean the people that made the mess should have cleaned it up. Just pointing out the issue isn’t that they didn’t buy a permit it’s that they didn’t clean it up."

diyelectronics,fdirzp0,t3_elil5y,1578449726.0,"You might be wondering why people are saying a 12V supply will work...

That ""battery holster"" (whatever it's called) connects 8 AA batteries (1.5V each) in series. In series voltages add up, so 8\*1.5V means that will output 12V.

Happy hobbying... and may this be a lesson to hoard all the plug in power supplies you ever lay your hands on."

diyelectronics,fcthftw,t3_eismmg,1577943390.0,"One of the first things I made where I said ""Wow electronics is cool and I can totally do this"" was a 555 astable vibrator circuit with a little buzzer on the output. I swapped the two ""timing"" resistors with a potentiometer and by adjusting this, was able to control the frequency/duty cycle of the timer, which as a result affected the tone of the buzzer.

Maybe a cool project for a musician."

Or he eats the food from the communal fridge and they know? Maybe he is just not compatible with these people at all. I just dislike how people use the race card when things don't go their way instead of trying to root out a problem. 

Do you really think the whole workplace are just straight up racist? Just dislike the guy because he is black? I highly doubt it."
