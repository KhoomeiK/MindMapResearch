sanpedrocactus,felb42o,t1_fel9tyl,1579218034.0,"I’d get it under grow light (not too strong), some straight pumice in plastic pot and put that on a heat mat or warming pad if you have one, itll encourage rooting. Once that baby shows ANY signs of rooting (even the tiniest of nubs!) you need to water it with some fertilizer mixed in, any tomato/veggie fert works well in low doses for cacti."

sanpedrocactus,fekx8k4,t1_feklcp6,1579209484.0,"So the sand actually holds more water than it lets through. Thats why sand castles can stand up when wet because it compacts and hold water well. 

If you have indoor plants you want your mix to be as gritty as possible unless they are under lights/ you have terracotta. Sand is not necessary, perlite will help increase the “grittiness” of your mix but I personally like pumice because it doesnt break down or float."

politics,fdlx79r,t1_fdl5y0u,1578534651.0,"You are completely correct we can’t start slashing without complete industry and educational reform, which lets get real would never happen in a political climate like we have today. I should have stated it in a way that portrayed that the healthcare cost issues is a snowball issue starting with the cost to educate doctors which turns into pay since they have to pay off their loans.

Increasing medicare funding to make more room for doctors to practice could in turn end up with more supply of doctors which would by economic theory would get paid less if demand is spread over a greater supply. 

Elizabeth Warren has a decent plan for addressing student debt which is pretty nice but should do more for those who put in a shit ton because if it doesn’t it won’t fix anything like we are discussing. 

I don’t claim to have the answers but this is definitey something we need to address before only rich people can go see the doctor."
politics,fdkyvwy,t1_fdj8xpm,1578514005.0,"Please, enlighten me then. Why is finding ways to reduce costs ignorant? I find it insane that people are so comfortable taking out 250k loans. At 4.5% thats 310k. Paying banks 60k. 

Doctors in the UK and EU pay £9250 a year for school. But you know, we should pay more so we can get paid more because its not like not being able to afford a doctor is life threatening or anything."
politics,fdkxv6z,t1_fdjs0t7,1578513402.0,I literally said we need reform in so many areas in the healthcare industry....  including the cost of colleges! The number of residencies must increase and medicaid/medicare needs to pay for it so that costs can go down. But all you read was cut a doctors pay.
sanpedrocactus,fdj6rh4,t1_fdit62q,1578460029.0,"If its a fresh cut, yes, but a little bit of water at this stage encourages roots. What I usually do is pot mine in damp grit mix and put it in a warm spot outside, and they have roots within a week. I dip my ends in sulfur and callous mine for at least a week to a month depending on how hot it is, pot em in damp grit mix, put them in a warm pretty much full sun spot and they have roots usually within a week. Dry or left out its taken up to 6 months for some genus."
politics,fdj4ixb,t1_fdiuwao,1578458238.0,So.... you wouldn’t instead say it costs way too much to go to school to be a doctor? The exponential increase in the price of education is what starts the economic issues later on down the line.

unpopularopinion,fdij1p9,t3_elc6d6,1578444018.0,Right so only people with money should have kids. Totes. No kiddos for you poorsies. /s
politics,fdie7fv,t1_fdibvy7,1578440895.0,"Exactly. I’m all for keeping jobs- its the Admin and doctors that make ridiculous amounts of money. We need reform in so many ways in the healthcare field, but unfortunately too many people are paying attention to the 1000 receptionists and not the 100 porsche cayennes in the parking lot, and you know its not granny on social securitys car."
sanpedrocactus,fdi5ilf,t3_eld1io,1578436100.0,"Potting it and putting it on a heat mat will help it sprout roots faster than normal, which may be a good idea since its such a small cut. I like rooting in pumice because I can pour water in the pot and it holds the slightest bit, but its like the plant senses it and pushes roots out to search for it. Sometimes cuts this small can shrivel if they don’t root quick enough, so just be aware of that when you are picking your method. You will need it to be generally warm to grow roots or else the plant will stay in dormancy- hence why you don’t want to take cuts or graft while they are dormant."
TechNewsToday,fdfxro4,t1_fdfpcka,1578373161.0,"You get a shit ton of national debt from waging a shit war for 19 years and bailing out millionaires which is not exclusive to any state.

AmItheAsshole,fcw0517,t3_ej14g8,1578014078.0,"YTA. But a little ESH except your kids. You realize that if you children are used to a certain level of comfort that if your ex makes 1/6th the amount you do that if she is only on one income and has to pay a mortgage, car payments, bills etc. that your kids will not be living the same life at both places. What if she can’t afford the area where they go to school on a single salary? Would 4k be absurd so your girls don’t have to change schools as well? I don’t think so. Especially if its only until they are out of school. 

Alimony is another story. If she was working at the time of the divorce I would fight that tooth and nail.

But watch out and keep track of all your payments.
