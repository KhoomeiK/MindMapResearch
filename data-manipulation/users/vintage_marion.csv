childfree,fg0nk02,t3_ew8is0,1580411394.0,Sometimes even the ones who plan still have warped views. I had a genuine discussion with my friend about a child not being a purpose to live and keep going. By the end of it he said well I should just kill my self because life doesn’t have meaning. I was like WTF? That was eye opening to how cross people’s thinking is.

depression,ffls28q,t3_eu6aze,1580043353.0,"That’s depression, I’ve had very close people who want to talk and spend time with me but depression says “Nope”. It’s in your head this feeling no one really cares,but after years of dealing with it and learning the signs of when someone actually is there for me it’s been manageable."

raisedbybipolar,ffbxluo,t3_essyou,1579786040.0,"From a lot of if not all the research I’ve done the likelihood of you having it decreases with age. Usually if it’s going to be severe it starts in the early teens and very serve starts as a child. If you want to be sure go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist. But you have to be honest, with them and yourself. Honestly your awareness is a good sign that your not suffering or if you are it’s not severe."
raisedbybipolar,ffbtupb,t3_eslkc0,1579782536.0,"I went no contact and my mother died at 56, so it was definitely not expected. So I have lived the “worst fear” the “I could live with myself” scenario, honestly I blamed myself without realizing that I could have done nothing. If I had stayed in contact and seen my mom, it would have just been more crying, pain, upset, stress and whatever else her illness could throw at me.  I can see all this now, for years I hated myself but i see that I would have been worse off."
depression,ff1e9g8,t1_ff1e1rz,1579478085.0,"I’m sorry about that, I’m so used to it that’s it’s not even a pain it’s just an inconvenience. I used to use alcohol to help sleep but I’m currently off that, so late nights starting at my phone it is."
depression,ff1dqnb,t1_ff0ynki,1579477869.0,I can totally relate to the getting to warm and sweaty and than is almost impossible to sleep comfortably again.
depression,ff0uped,t3_eqxc9u,1579472425.0,Wish I had the sleep feels good/dreams are good depression. I have the can’t stay asleep and dreams cause anxiety and I’m always tired depression.
depression,fexbssn,t3_eqs4h8,1579428285.0,"But no ones life stays better. Even non depressed people have shitty days, weeks, months, even years, but the difference is they are not depressed when it happens. I have major depression, it lasts a long time when I have an episode. I mean I go months but I don’t ever forget that it’s my depression that’s making me feel this way. Life seems awful when in reality it’s not most of the time (real trauma aside) because my brain isn’t working correctly and I can’t be happy, or I’m very irritated by everything. I just feel like this thing about life getting and staying better doesn’t make sense to me. Since depression causes a warped perspective, we don’t see what life does to us. We can’t control the fact that we can’t be happy and focus only or mostly on the negative, so being focused on when it doesn’t make life worse isn’t in my opinion a way to help with depression.

What have you done to deserve being manipulated and burdened with his problems? If he’s hurting you emotionally and draining you mentally do you think he feels guilty? Just adding some perspective."
relationships,fevhng0,t1_fevhd11,1579397582.0,"It’s not, this is only 2 months in? If he’s toxic now IT WILL GET WORSE. Just leave and block all social media, keep records if he becomes stalker/violent. Also if he does any self harm, remember it is NOT your fault a short relationship like yours will not cause wounds that deep."
depression,fevhbrn,t1_fevgnhr,1579397442.0,"Have you tried everything?? I don’t know what treatments or people you have talked to but suicide can be idealized. Is there no one (if you were to take one last minute to think) being hurt by your death? No friends, family, coworkers, heck even stranger/neighbors who see you that would wonder what happened? Any pets who would be left hollow from the loss of you being in their lives?"

depression,fevft95,t1_fevfa8s,1579396913.0,"I hope you reconsider, I don’t know you or your situation but your life can be changed at any minute. Also doing wrong by someone can have nothing to do with them. Have you thought about that? That someone’s view point/bias made what you thought right into a wrong? We are all guided by perceptions not always reality and depression is one that skews reality.  I hope you take a minute to think before acting."

alcoholism,fcqvljr,t3_eij696,1577892876.0,"First off I am proud your admitting drinking is a problem, that is a huge step!! Now to the scary things I read. I know many people who completely change when drunk but being drunk does not excuse the behaviors. You both need help because physical violence (drunk or not) is still violence. Not remembering is no excuse because i assume your tell him what he did when he’s sober but he still drinks. I know people close who can’t stop once they start and it’s a hard task to help them. Start now, hopefully this hasn’t gone on too long. Also your young, if he can’t or won’t change don’t think you can change him. Only he can help himself and the same goes for you. Seek help, you do not deserve to have hands laid on you ever!! Check out r/stopdrinking. I’m not sure where you live but look up AA meetings, or Smart recovery even look to drug/alcohol counseling to head in the right directions."
