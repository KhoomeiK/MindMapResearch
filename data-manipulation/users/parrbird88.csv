It’s not fair to the struggle to say one person was able to miraculously cure someone 

I’m sure he’s been to countless rehab programs, therapy, promised himself hundreds of times he’d stop, before he finally was able to. Yes she was the extra push but please this is oversimplifying a complex issue"
CPTSD,ff4udb1,t3_eriumm,1579572661.0,"I feel this to my core 

What has helped me a bit was realizing that I’m actually anxious about engaging in the activity I’m avoiding because I know doing it will create even more negative feelings. 

So I say to myself these kinda of things: 
 
‘OK so I’m avoiding doing my taxes because something about doing them makes me nervous. 

I know I can do them though and I know that I’ll have to anyway. 

I also know I’ll just beat myself up, get depressed and have anxiety if I don’t do it. 

I also know it will take less than an hour to actually do it. 

From a lifelong pattern of this, I know that it’s never as bad as I build it up in my head to be. 


If I wait until it’s deadline time, I’ll get it done for sure but will have wasted SO much of my time worrying and thinking about a task that will take an hour 

Ok so I’m gonna feel stressed out while I do it, go in thinking this, because it’s true and even though it’ll feel that way, the feeling AFTER I finish will be fcking liberating’ 

And that’s how my self talk will go . It won’t always work of course, but sometimes it does. And I’ll take any help I can get with this stuff 

Good luck to you"
