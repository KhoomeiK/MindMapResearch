AskReddit,ffbdyy1,t1_f436weq,1579761246.0,"It's basically like being racist. The thing is you can insult people of different races, you just can't do so directly influencing something they have no control of. ""Haha your ancestor used to be my slave"" maybe insult them on things that are much lighter and acceptable? Specific to them? Like the decisions the make? Or how they take care of things? Or how they're late for work? If you have the question of where to draw the line. Think of the same joke you're about to make and see if you can use that joke on a person of other race, gender, etc"
AskReddit,ffbdqbv,t1_f43hrtt,1579760977.0,"Inter""sex"" not gender. Like someone else said gender is a social construct and sex is biology. I can be a male and still like to wear mascara and sport a long hair and talk like a girl and that shouldn't make it abnormal or illegal."
AskReddit,ffbdhjc,t1_fbnvmnl,1579760703.0,"The entire reason for the suicide rate is their nonacceptance. I can name my own trans friends who are very very happy in life in a city where trans people are not looked at as someone different. Unless you actually have proof of mental illness specifically found in trans people, you are literally just a pathetic transphobic individual trying to find reasons to hate on them. Unless you're actually curious and open to arguments on the reasons for the suicide statistics you have no right to be ""anti"" transgender. Imagine if someone was ""anti"" you just cuz you look ugly and ""statistically"" ugly people suicide more"
