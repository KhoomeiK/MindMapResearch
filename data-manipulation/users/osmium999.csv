And it's through anime that i recovered this ability, and even now, even if i watched it a thousand times, the last episode of angel beats is like a tears trigger. I hope it could help you (the anime is only 12-13 episodes long and quite pleasant)"

SuicideWatch,ff5a25z,t1_ff59awy,1579584814.0,"Yeah ... i'm sorry to but that's not that bad, at least i'm happy doing it :/ and i think there's not enough stories clearly adressing the problem of depression, it's to ""edgy"" i think you should try to do your comics anyway, i mean ... you can adress serious issues with simples drawings and by practice you can get anywhere. 

And i dont think it's really possible to get 100% sure about suicide, after all we're not supposed to do that. That really amazes me the fact that no mater how depressed and done i am about life there's still something inside my head preventing me to cut to deep"

All i can give is the hope i have for you to get better, or at least to leave with a smile on your face.

About the comics, i tried to convinced me that the most important is the story... I wanted to creat a girl as fucked up as me how try one last thing to stop beeing alone. I thought it would be a good idea for me to stop feeling alone xD 
What did you wanted to tell in your comics ?

And about the letter i think it's important to make one, maybe keeping it on you so nobody can descover it ... before. I wrote several suicide letters but i can't keep me from putting jokes and humour in it and i think it's not the right thing to do :/"
Parappa,ff588qc,t3_erpggm,1579583139.0,"That's a nice suicide letter it's beatifull. I'm so sorry for what you had to go through and that it all had to end so soon but i understand. 

It's funny and sad at the same time ""I wish i was special, so verry special"" (like the song). It seems like having a tallent you can be proud of or something that makes you special is the absolute necessity to survive in today's humanity... Dam you Darwin !! 

I dont really know what i could wish you ( luck ? XD ). Of cours i hope you dont die, but i'm not arrogant enough to belive that i could change your mind. I just think that finding something toi can be proud of or working to become somone you can be proud of is the only way to survive ... And if you live, i hope you find it

But, to have you're daily 2 000 cal you have to eat 14 twinkies. The problem is that your brain doesnt stop the hunger when the amount of calories is reached. The hunger stop when you're stomach is fulled. And you can't fill your stomach for a day with 14 twinkies. I suppose that the guy who did that was starving ?

Yeah i was wrong there is no differents types of calories. But when you chose food the amount of calories is not enough. The fiber concentration, the amount of that food you have to take to stop hunger. Calories is only one element of a bigger thing."
