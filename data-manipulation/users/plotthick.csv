Remember when replanting starts in empty spots, to dig deep into your bed and scratch in a scant handful of whatever the new start needs.

As for planning, I usually put a big ol plant or three in each big ol 50sqft bed, then put little things around it.  Like:

* a bed of carrots (the soil needs to be carefully prepared) with celery on the downslope to catch the runoff. 
* Two tomatoes, with onions on the sunny side and lettuce in the shade. 
* Two non-running squash, trellised vertically on rebar, with lettuce early on before it's crowded out
* Lay down greensand in the winter to age, then fava beans for the spring, then garlic which loves aged greensand.  Usually 100 sq ft will get me through the year.

>what’s between chicken wire and cow panel!

Cattle panels are 10 gauge.  They don't bend.  Chicken wire is 18 or 20 gauge, pretty flimsy.  Welded fencing is 12 to 18 gauge, I prefer 14 because you can re-use it a bunch of times, the thicker wires make stronger weld joins, and yet it's pliable enough to roll up and store.  I like it with very wide holes: big enough to pull a tomato or beans/peas through.  Leave them long enough to re-use as trellises later (pea supports in the spring then Tomato cages later)."
gardening,ff7oss5,t1_ff6y3j9,1579654701.0,"Dang you're awesome.  It's going to be a epic garden.  

Cattle panels are kind of overkill.  Something like flexibleish fencing (between cattle panels - chickenwire), turned into a circle, would be juuuuuust fine.  You might need to support them with two stakes each, but that's it.   

Oh, and you'll need larger ones for INDETERMINATE tomatoes.  Those get 15 - 20 feet high/long.  Determinates stay one size, about 5' plus or minus a foot, and they set all fruit at once (best for putting up).

gardening,ff6ek9e,t1_ff5g85b,1579625487.0,"Thanks for the reply.  I'll start with the general then go to the specific. 

Break everything up into blocks of beds, not rows.  We think of growing crops in rows because that's how they're grown in the field and farming equipment goes up and down and up and down... but we're not farming equipment.  We can be more efficient. Beds are better because foot traffic compresses soil: no feet in beds= fluffier soil, happier roots, healthier plants.  And twice as much area for growing means way more yield.  Beds should be blocks of 25, 50, or 100 square feet (or square meters depending on where you are) to make applying amendments easier.  

Smaller crops like lettuce can be packed pretty tightly, especially if you ditch the row mentality and go with beds.  This allows better spacing so you get more crops for your usable space.  Some of the smaller lettuces can fit five or more per sq ft, especially if you cut, amend, and re-plant immediately. 

Beds need to be only as wide as you can reach into, so two feet wide if up against something, 4 feet if you can get access from both sides. Paths should be at least 2 feet, more like 3 or 4.  You should be able to run a wheelbarrow, or waddle with a tub, up and down every other path.  Think of laying out your garden like a leaf or a river system: you don't need big paths everywhere.  But I gotta have a wide main path, and branching paths out to smaller areas are fine. 

Raised beds will warm sooner and dry out quicker which would definitely be a benefit in your zone.  Edge them with anything you like: just mounded dirt, rocks, cement blocks (can plant in them or use the holes to support trellises), etc etc. 

Okay that's enough about layout, I could go on all day. 

Here's more on spacing in beds (picture is worth a thousand words): http://www.organicgardeninfo.com/planting-garden-beds.html

Tomatoes will take up an enormous space...eventually.  4x4 or bigger in latter months but tiny early on.  Until then, plant short-lived crops around it to reduce soil moisture loss, squeeze out weeds, and utilize space better.  Lettuce, radishes, etc.  Do not use ""tomato cages"", those are a joke.  Get concrete lightweight fencing and make 3-5 foot tall rounds.  

Squash too.  They get huge, some of them vine out for dozens of feet.  If you get those, get a trellis or a lot of runway.  They grow fast, so the only thing you can interplant with them is alliums, though those sometimes get overtaken too. 

Speaking of, I don't notice any alliums or herbs.  Herbs are gold!  Put them by the back door for easy snipping. 
  
Oh, and I cannot overstate the importance of timers and drip tape.  Gilmore is my brand of choice, choose one you like (metal, not plastic fittings)  and stick with them.  Same company, same threads, less leaks.

Let me know if you want more.  Companion planting is all fine and dandy but knowing what you planted where is, in my opinion, far more important for amending soil and rotational control of nutrient loss/increase and pest control/eradication."

Monocultures may do better for a time, such as when all the whites were very happy that they got all the benefit of everyone's labor, including the labor they stole from black slaves.  But eventually those systems fail.  If the monocultures don't diversify, they fail for a long time: all your eggs in one basket.  Diversity leads to better outcomes: more innovative, more income, better health, less vulnerable.  Resilient, strong, diverse.

But standing in the way of a better future is... both cruel and immensely sad.  Those towns deserve better than that.

It's obvious you didn't watch the video, and are responding out of your own racism (the video didn't talk about black representation).  But I'll answer anyway, even though your talking points are straight from the MRM.

&#x200B;

>Why do you expect white men to give you anything for free?

Equality of Opportunity is all that's asked for.  The current bias against women is provable and obvious, by the numbers.  When a whole class of people aren't even given the opportunity to work, they can't prove themselves by their work.  Women are systematically excluded from most movie/media productions.  See: John Stewart's realization on The Daily Show. 

&#x200B;

>This is not a charity. You wouldn't give anything you had earned away.

Equality of Opportunity is all that's asked for.  The movie business doesn't give anything away, it takes carefully considered chances.  Currently we're seeing that women in that industry can bring in pretty damn good money.  And it's true throughout the business world: more diverse companies make more money.  That's not ""charity"", that's good business.

&#x200B;

>And the movies now are going out if their way to make characters gender/race equal.

The world is just about half women, half men, with maybe 5% of it being what we call ""white"".  Less than 1% have non-brown eyes.  How many Hollywood casts are mostly POC, half women, and all having brown eyes, per year?  The answer is very, very, very few.  Therefore this is not ""gender/race equal"".  The video wasn't even about ""gender/race equal"", it talked about what kind of great stuff we're missing by ignoring 75%-90% of the population.  Wonder Woman, Parasite, and Russian Doll are good examples: people besides white men can tell good stories that make great money.

But there's always someone (usually a young white man, like I'd bet you are), who ignores the benefit they could get to focus on how the new diversity is ""taking away"" from white men.  This is like bellyaching that you didn't get an ""A"" because the teacher graded based on how well you did on the test, not the color of your skin or whether you have boobs.

Dementia patients are a rapidly-growing population, and just like when the Boomers hit delivery rooms, then schools... there aren't enough trained personnel to deal with this influx.

Housework Gap occurs in every country, in every generation, at every income level, at every education level.  Hopefully these two points will clarify: 

1. Even in relationships where the woman works and the man is (temporarily) unemployed, the woman does more housework per week than the man does. 
2. Across every country, when you add up total average paid+unpaid hours, women work more than men.  If we had to pay women for their work, the Wage Gap would slam shut, economies would surge and men would be left far behind in earnings.
