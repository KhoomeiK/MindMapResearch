""Pregnancy blood tests are typically¬†quantitative¬†or qualitative. A qualitative blood test delivers a ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù result to a pregnancy. A¬†quantitiative¬†blood test can answer how much human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is present in the body. This hormone is produced during pregnancy.
The time it takes for these tests to result can vary. If a doctor has an in-house laboratory, you may receive your result in a few hours. If not, it could take two to three days.¬†"" just saying."
