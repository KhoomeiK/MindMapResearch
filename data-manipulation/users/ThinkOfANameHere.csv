>Bigger socialist government will fix everything.

This is a strawman. First up, socialism has absolutely nothing to do with climate change. Socialism is a government model that involves redistribution of wealth, and climate change can and does operate without socialism involved. Regulation is more of an issue of asking when it becomes authoritarianism. Socialism is a political hot button word and it's a tell that you're trying to turn this into a political issue rather than an issue of facts. Authoritarian governments are not just socialist.

On top of that, the larger body of climate change supporters is not is calling for an authoritarian gov't reformation to fix global warming. show me the statistics otherwise. It's a simplification and strawman used to scare gullible libertarians who don't look into the demands put against the govts.

What people want is for CURRENT GOV'TS to use CURRENT POWERS to regulate Emissions and waste like other markets. Major companies oppose this because it eats into their profits created by not giving a fuck about the environment. My personal favorite is when coke and other [major polluter brands](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/23/coca-cola-plastic-waste-pollution/) helped push the argument that it was the [average person causing the plastic pollution](https://www.treehugger.com/plastic/cokes-uk-head-sustainability-says-we-dont-have-packaging-problem-we-have-waste-and-litter-problem.html), when in reality they were the ones who pushed for disposable containers and [undermined recycling efforts](https://theintercept.com/2019/10/18/coca-cola-recycling-plastics-pollution/). This is just one example of companies pushing against eco-friendly change, and it definitely gets 10x worse with [oil companies and climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuels_lobby). It doesn't matter what the gov't looks like, people just want these gov'ts to put their foot down on exploitative companies putting the people at risk.

>Only ""advanced governments"" are needed to fix the problem .... not  China, India, Far East, etc. ... because that is where the money is.

and I don't know where [you're getting China isn't involved in climate change](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-11/caos-cm110519.php). These are the countries that are pushing the most for this. China is a smog infested shitshow and it kills its workers so fast the CCP realizes it hurts their profit margins (not that they care about the wellbeing of the people. Only that they can't replace cities worth of smog-ill workers.) That's why they give half a shit (and the fact that the rest of the world is demanding them to do it as the country with an even worse carbon footprint than the US. China cares too much about its trade relations to ignore a unified demand like that). They and other ASEAN countries are also done with [Western Trash](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48444874), with many countries outright banning it. India is on the same boat with all this. They're figuratively and literally sick of the pollution and global warming that is affecting their nations as much as everyone else.

And all this talk of it being bs with 0 sources backing it. C'mon man, at least try to have a civil debate and cite some stuff to look at. I've read up on all this and the conclusion isn't that there's some scary boogeyman group looking to put an authoritarian socialist boot down on the west. It's that there's an alarming trend in our current environment, a mass extinction event with no other explanation outside of human interference, and people demand the businesses at fault take responsibility. They refuse so the people turn to the gov'ts to demand justice as these companies put everyone at risk for their own bottom dollar, and for the gov'ts of the world to mitigate the damage their recklessness is continuing to cause."

Japanese were still killed if they tried to leave there, any priests of any non-japanese based religions were killed, China had a small district in nagasaki, which was about the only leg up over the dutch they had. It was all still highly restricted and Japan wanted as little to do with the east as it did the west, they just knew better than to butt heads with China and the country literally nicknamed ""the dagger aimed at the heart of Japan"" (korea)."

PoliticalCompassMemes,ffbheb3,t1_ffbevz7,1579765398.0,"> the advantages of smaller companies can be very real, especially when a potential monopolizer gets complacent 

This was only a serious problem up to and during the recent age-of-information boom. Aside from best-buy, intel used to be the monopoly on gpus. The got too complacent and technology advanced to the point that any startup could finance parts exponentially better than Intel's outdated crap and a bunch of markets basically tore into intel while they were still groggy, prompting a sudden reverb of competition (which has now converged into a dual-competitive market between intel and amd).

Beyond that, technology has only served to push the distance between monopolies and small startups farther apart, improving communication and organization exponentially, making it harder for inept leadership to throw wrenches in the machine. This means the barrier to entry to even challenge a monopoly is even higher. The benefits to small business have been getting less and less important as big business uses tech to emulate it. they'll spot you even faster than before as you try to climb, and even if you can get the jump on them their recovery will be faster than it used to. The reason this competition could even break through in these examples is because the US gov't anti-trust laws ensure there can't be a monopoly that entrenched into a market... tho that's changing as people learn to play the system (for example, the big ISP moguls figured out they can carve up the map and play multilateral deal makers with one another to get around anti-trust while giving themselves competition free markets. Same game with media-moguls).

> Plus most of the bullying examples I can think of are state-aided by  companies that get powerful enough to get noticed by state-senpai. 

That's only the stuff we see because working through the state causes behind closed doors negotiations to get a lot of public paperwork. direct competition like profit gouging and disinformation are far harder to get a read on when it's proper anti-competition or not unless the state steps in to demystify the motivations (or if it's dead obvious like back in the gilded age, when vanderbilt basically starved NY to get the deals he wanted on his rail supplies shit. But that is the result of an-cap levels of free-market). Great example is the boeing-lockheed monopoly on spacecrafts. They made the United Launch Alliance, and they controlled the US space market entirely. Orbital Sciences corp had to sue to get access to russian-made rockets because ULA blocked them by threatening the gov't to start shit. It was only by direct gov't intervention, pulling the ULA out of contention for contracts that SpaceX got the new lion's share along with a few other companies.

>maybe shit wouldn't work out totally fine in Ancapistan. 

Ancap never works out. Perfect examples are the gilded age and banana republics. the problem is that with such a giant push into globalism and organization, businesses don't just have a higher barrier to entry, but the monopolies have an even higher ceiling. It's high enough that without regulation it'll spill right into the state and use it as an iron boot to stomp out any other chance to lose, outside of political reformation en-masse.

The only reason Ancap ever looks good to people is 1 of 3 reasons. 1- overestimation of self-importance. People think they'll be in that top .01% who are the new-age nobility... even tho the people that will be are the current 1-.1%. 2- lack of understanding. As this meme points out, a lot of people only know the basics like an econ101 class and never dive deeper than that. 3- the people arguing for ancap have hit that state ceiling and want to go higher / use the gov't as a springboard, to the complete detriment of their competition and literally every worker, small business, and stable market around. True an-cap is the libright equivalent of being called a nazi as an auth-right, commie as an authleft, and anarchist as libleft. it's the most extreme version and like all the other extremes, it's only good on paper and terrible in practice.

Edit: can't forget the other time monopolies kinda break. Going back to vanderbilt- they break when they literally destroy markets. Even with regulation there's tons of examples of companies working together in the name of short term gains and causing recessions. Imagine what one company as a monopoly could do with absolutely 0 checks and balances. The answer, as shown by Vanderbilt is a lot. A lot of bad that caused the market to basically wither and then nobody got anything out of it until another monopoly, standard oil, came in and swept it up. That is ancap in action. Destroy a market and another monopoly from a different market takes its place."

This is something that has been taking hold in all sorts of examples. My personal favorite is WW2, [shape coding](https://www.wired.com/story/how-dumb-design-wwii-plane-led-macintosh/). TL;DR: the reason we use all sorts of distinctive controls that can't be mixed up with one another is because that's exactly what was happening with the samey feeling and shaped controls of WW2 planes, so what a pilot thought was the landing gear was actually the air brake, and similar disasters. Yes the people made a mistake, but the system in place never accounted for humans to make mistakes.

It's not important in all scenarios. Again, you don't need a whole process every time someone picks up a plate of food. However, when someone is dealing with a task that can put someone's life at risk, there has to be more care than just ""lul fire this dude and move on"". Maybe it was a one time fluke, but sometimes there's a deeper cause (not just ""Being on the phone"", but rather ""driver is distracted"") that can address multiple problems when solved for the safety of others and the operator."

This comment was deleted by 52 once it started getting downvotes, and left up the comment it linked to. His justification is that ""well he didn't break any rules"" and ""he didn't specifically change the sub"" as though that alone decides if a mod should be a mod. [Drdreamtime lies](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/eqsx57/rjusticeserved_turns_into_a_furry_subreddit_hours/ff24b81/?context=3) about why he banned people and was actively censoring the sub. He has a plethora of comments on his account goading people in the middle of a shitshow. How is that appropriate for a mod to do?

This is not appropriate mod behavior. Censorship of opinions (excluding ""opinions"" that obviously lean into vitriolic hate, the thing DDT tried to call the comments) is unacceptable. Attacking the character of those you censor is unacceptable. Snidely mocking people you've wronged by censoring a sub is unacceptable. But something is going on behind the scenes where 52hz won't remove drdreamtime even though this is hardly his first round of bs. He specifically has been in a slew of controversies that has been giving the sub a horrible image.

I'm not saying there weren't vitrolic comments and posts. Oh I definitely spotted some of them myself, but obviously DD was powertripping and once again JS is fine with it. I can't blame people for getting POd and leaving at this point. I'm about ready to do the same if this gets swept under the rug again.

worldnews,ff39fuf,t1_ff2kdoe,1579536806.0,"It's an annoying balance.

People know this is a human system. Mercantilism has always existed and always been at odds with governments. before it was a lot harder for merchants to get a leg up because it was far harder to raise any armies without a centralized system, but it was hard to centralize merchants because they'd inherently fight over their markets. This on top of the fact that merchants didn't exactly have a penchant for war as war was at odds with their goal for trade during peace (as peace means more customers and less risk during transport). A few places got by like Venice, pisa, etc but they had to have that inherent natural border not just to benefit trade, but to make up for the poor military efficiency.

This all changed when technology gave rise to better communication and administrative theory improved the mercantile shortcomings. Suddenly you could have companies like the Dutch East Indies, a company owning a damn country. The british raj was owned by a british company first, etc. Once monarchism started falling out of favor as people realized populace power > divine declaration, there had to be a new status quo.

Well, monarchism left a bad taste in people's mouths for any overly-authoritarian gov't, so now there's a power vacuum... and thus democracy takes over. But who has the greatest power in democracy? Who else but the merchants, the ones who supply the people. This is where Capitalism births from, and why pure capitalism is destined to monopolies, as eventually that power pools.

Socialism and Communism always have these major flaws- normally revolving around how authoritarianism always leads to poor leadership, as the gov't acts less like a filter against radical decisions and more like a megaphone for good and bad decisions. It tends to rub against the people's mindset because it was built on a flawed understanding of the human condition, requiring goalpost moving like how people somehow ""learned to love their chains"". It ignores ideas that filters cannot be naturally made (anarchistic capitalism is an obvious proof of that), and that eventually a system of ""equality"" will lead to a power vacuum filled and eventually replaced by someone who sees ""equality"" as ""some people are more equal than others"". Capitalism just works, but it shows that the human condition is naturally flawed, self centered and complicated. It displays all these problems but also turns the dial on them up to 11 as a cost for turning up the dial on libertarianism.

If the country is running a democracy, it needs to balance capitalist indulgences with populace demands. People believe it's doing more harm than good because in some ways it is. Unchecked capitalism leads to things like the banana republic and gilded age America. On the other hand, all this power means that getting one of those ""in the system"" to agree with you gives your position more weight. Mixed market is the inevitable best solution on paper, balancing that power and voice of companies with the people's demands and liberties... but in practice nobody can decide where the lines should be drawn because there's always someone mucking about to get the line where they want it, and everybody has different goals and opinions."

That is also a major explanation for why children adopted in general, [As this report explains here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016028969390018Z), biology in the beginning plays a role in how effective early-education can be. HOWEVER, later adoption shows that it is the overall educational exposure that will effect the IQ later in life.

Basically, what you stated is a bit of a misnomer. If someone has a low IQ family, but is adopted early on and thus presented with higher socio-educational exposure, they will inevitably have an equal or higher IQ score to those who are adopted later on, and regardless of where they came from, the later adopted children will have a relatively equal IQ to their peers, regardless of biology. It shows that while time goes on, experience forms the majority of our knowledge (which makes sense since the whole point of development is to absorb information and learn about the world).

While it likely does play a factor, low IQ does imply poverty, meaning poor education and nutrition access, as well as a disconnect from technology which could expose them to more education. Being up for adoption until 17 means that there is a relatively equal level of circumstance and thus their intelligence reflects this by relatively equal levels. By the time they're up for adoption, even as young as age 7, those formulaic years have been wasted in poverty, creating the uphill battle.

Yet as that link showed, an early enough intervention can still yield better results than if they were supposedly biologically gifted. Intelligence certainly has some level of biological factor, but more and more nurture has been showing intelligence is not as linked to biology as some groups like to claim, and it is why experts in education are calling for more work to be done in early child care and intervention to take advantage of those early formulaic years, where there is the greatest chance to massively improve a child's future intelligence."

Either way, CCP is a dick."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fen67iz,t1_fen5cq0,1579277863.0,">Wow, some type of education before school age does have a small affect on IQ!

It has a small affect alone, however it has a large effect on how effective future schooling will be. Which was repeated by multiple of those links and studies.

It's hilarious how you ignored every other point I made and focused on the one you could throw a bunch of videos at, which I do appreciate. I've seen the videos, and i've seen these links and a ton more. The videos show a similar effect as Sefan is known for, [cult-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Molyneux#Cult_accusations) indoctrination and many of these speakers are questionable with their research, however I am not going to systematically debunk 17 different hour+ long videos in a single reddit comment just as you won't try to debunk 10+ links to various articles and research. that is fine, these are reddit comments. I will point out that [even his own interviewed professors](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/08/stefan-molyneux-iq-and-race-what-the-experts-think.html) dislike his methodology, simplification, and overall lack of intelligent conversation to the topics at hand. I wouldn't point to many speakers who agree with me, and I hope for you to avoid molyneux as a biased and poor host of information."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fen4dw7,t1_fen1r69,1579276710.0,">Why do they have constant war?

Because there's a power vacuum? As I said, they were ravaged by colonialism, followed up with being hit by the Cold War interventionism and a finishing touch of US holy-warrior funding to destabilize the USSR's target countries for literally building their allies. This is then exhaserbated by the fact that the borders were drawn up mostly by those colonialists. Shocker- just like Africa it was shoddily done, focusing more on the politics than cultural-social climates and natural borders. Just like africa- people constantly fight over them because of it.

>Why do they have extremist terrorist?

Because that's who the US funded and supplied weapons to. Once they got a foothold and the US literally just left them there after the USSR collapsed, they were the ones with the guns and tools to impose their extremism. It'd be like if you gave a countries worth of militant Christians and racist extremists, then they went and started indoctrinating and ext- oh yeah nazis and WW2. Didn't even need the funding for that one, just the most incompetent gov't in Europe (seriously, they have debt so they just print more money? Jesus and people made jokes about greece not having any economists).

>Why does education get put on the back burner?

Because in the western world, Education up to a certain point is government funded. US public Schools, European public schools, etc. Religious extremists require large military funds. These extremists either took hold of countries or caused enough instability that the power vacuum was filled by a militant dictatorship (if it wasn't just installed by that cold-war interventionism). Without the support from the gov't, wide access public education fails, full stop. If you cut all gov't funding for education in the US right now, the total IQ in the US would plummet too.

>Education has very little impact on IQ. How you were raised (before  school age) and what your parents intelligence is affects your IQ.

I'm just calling bullshit on this one. yes being raised can affect IQ, and parental intelligence affects IQ to varying degrees. What's the variety? Based on how much schooling can prevent negative influence. The reason low IQ parents tend to have low IQ kids is that both live in an environment where there is little educational access in any form at an early age (Yeah, imagine some war-torn migrants running around different countries with a bunch of toddler brain teaser puzzles and sesame street books. doesn't happen). Education is one of the most important factors for IQ improvements, especially at a young age where the mind is malleable. This has been researched and observed [over](https://www.iqtestexperts.com/iq-education.php), and [over](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brainstorm/201806/how-much-does-education-really-boost-intelligence), and [over](https://psychcentral.com/news/2018/06/24/study-shows-education-boosts-iq/136418.html), and [over](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29911926), and [over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_education), and [over](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/39/5/1362/802787), and [over](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/39/5/1362/802787), and [over](https://www.voanews.com/science-health/study-more-education-increases-iq-score), and [over](https://neurosciencenews.com/education-iq-9413/), and [over](https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/spring-2013/schooling-makes-you-smarter). I can keep fucking going, but the point is clear. Education is the biggest factor, and its lack-there-of is what will universally drop a country's IQ. You are once again reversing cause and effect to push a racist/nationalist-extremist rhetoric."
