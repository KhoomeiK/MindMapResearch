aww,fgjfp5h,t1_fgj5bui,1580843069.0,"Not sure where you saw me say that i think this parrot should be just released outside randomly, but if you care so much here is what i  think..
I don't like birds being pets. I don't like when birds, especially more complicated ones like parrots, are bred/captured for the puspose of being a pet. I don't like when people get all cute and nice and supportive about someone getting a bird as a pet. And by pet i mean an animal kept away from it's natural habitat. A cow on a farm where it can walk around fields like they normally would isn't a pet. These people are in pet store where animals are sold as pets. I doubt these are some ""rescued"" birds saved from inappropriate conditions with intent of bettering their life by putting them in better care. If it is then i'm wrong."

Anxiety,fg4alrg,t3_ewmjw4,1580499682.0,"Would the person you'd like to be do it? If yes, maybe try acting like that person you want to be instead of trying to be yourself. Like actors in movies. And it kinda of gives you an excuse to not get embarrassed because you were just acting as someone else. And as you do it you might see that people don't really judge or even care about you as much as maybe you think they do. Also confidence can be a choice. You don't have to be confident, you can choose to act confidently and damn it feels good.
Sorry if any of this shit is useless but seemed kinda relatable so there it is"
