My friends baby had a very similar diagnoses with such a list of defects. And now that little Stevie has passed away all the procedures she was put through seem so... Futile. So much suffering in such a short life. Seeing this post reminded me that it could have gone the other way too and all of it would have been worth it."
MadeMeSmile,fguu4lo,t1_fgsoscm,1581129488.0,"Holy shit, I replied before but now that I'm seeing the amount of problems your son had I'm even more impressed that he pulled through! That's incredible! 

Can I ask: how is his day to day life now, do he still have any ill effects from his heart problems? Does he get tired easily? 

What an amazing heart warrior your kid is!"
MadeMeSmile,fgutqxe,t3_f0b42f,1581129242.0,"Wow, your son is a little fighter and I'm so happy for you. My best friend lost her daughter early January to this. She was only a month old and already went through so many operations. It's was (and is) heartbreaking. Fuck you congenital heart defects!!"

relationship_advice,fg2fg7s,t3_ewexyw,1580443989.0,"Ok, I just read a bit of your comment history and figured out the 'friend' is actually you. 

So here's my advice. Cut the GF loose, you are with her for the wrong reasons and the last thing you need is a relationship right now. You have bigger fish to fry my friend. 

NOW LISTEN TO THIS AND PLEASE UNDERSTAND IM SAYING THIS FOR YOUR BENEFIT: 
Find a good therapist and work on your own toxic and shallow personality, your anger issues and narcissistic tendencies. Do it now whilst you are still young. Do it now before you do something that will forever affect someone elses and your own life. You have serious issues. You are on a dangerous path and if left untreated there is a large chance you will end up making other people and yourself very unhappy for the rest of your life. Good luck."

THIS GUY DOESNT GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT YOU. HE DOESNT 'CARE'. HE JUST WANTS HIS TOY BACK SO HE CAN HAVE CONTROL OVER YOU AGAIN BY MAKING YOU LOVE HIM DESPITE HIS SHITTY BEHAVIOUR. 

There. Now get over him and move on with your life FFS."
