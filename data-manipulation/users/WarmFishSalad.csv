politics,fcd86xt,t1_fcc4fau,1577607565.0,"you dont understand that there is a global competitive landscape for world economies and the corporate tax rates are a major factor.

im sorry.  i have no idea how to help you."
politics,fcby8lf,t3_egx95m,1577592302.0,usually you think this is good for employees but it actually ends up cutting jobs.  good news is that we have more jobs than workers so it's not really going to be an economic impact.  should be all upside...in theory...
politics,fcbm4aa,t1_fcbfyfw,1577588441.0,"holy shit you're just not hearing any of the words I say.  email BMW CEO Oliver Zipse and ask him ""Hey Ollie, does cutting the tax rate in the US from 35% to 21% help you and your 11,000 employees in Spartanburg, SC make more shitty SUVs?""

the US went from being one of the highest rates to being far more competitive, while being the largest economy with the world's standard reserve currency with the benefits of having some of the best schools and best technology on earth.

if you don't understand that kansas and the US ain't equal...there is no point in bothering.  just keep repeating whatever you read in the news media."
politics,fcb9pal,t1_fcaqa5h,1577584188.0,">If it doesn't work for an entire state, what makes you think it works for the country?

why are there macro and microeconomics?

scale matters.

but don't take it from me.  take it from the people who are running the biggest corporations in the world.  Ask them if the united states slashing their corporate taxes makes a difference when planning how to structure the global supply chains."
carcrash,fcb5vbd,t1_fcak5l8,1577582761.0,it's a bunch of uninteresting cars and the crashes i saw before getting bored were hardly amazing
news,fcaixzm,t1_fc9uxrh,1577570052.0,concrete science doesnt have anything to do with the average person.  just think about the number of people who dont wear seatbelts despite physics being taught in every highschool classroom.
politics,fcaa0m6,t1_fca4rlj,1577565405.0,"hi.  just to make you aware, i am talking about the united states.  its is a collection of 50 states.  its major competiton is the rest of the countries in the world that all have their own rules and regulations.

just because kansas had a plan and failed doesn't prove *anything* when we are talking about economics on a global scale.  US corporate tax rate went from 35% to 21% .  

this means we leap frogged a dozen and a a half other countries when it comes to tax treatment.   doing this is economic stimulus.  its not *smart* stimulus.  its clearly as *waste of money*.  but saying that it isnt stimulus or that it doesnt have an impact ""cuz kansas"" is intellectually bankrupt."
politics,fca4bpv,t1_fca45tv,1577562871.0,tax cuts are economic stimulus.  either you dont understand or you are being intentionally dishonest.

politics,fca0st9,t1_fc7lilj,1577561142.0,it would be better.  but thats really just a random comment rather than something adding value to the conversation.  the point is that donald has run the country into further debt to have more economic stimulation now
politics,fc9jj0m,t3_egqjhq,1577553598.0,"look, dems have people saying ""medicare for all"" and "" free college"".

this doesnt sound like either side gives a fig about the countries debt, so its not as if young people should feel one way or another.

fiscal conservatism is dead.  the debt bubble is only going to balloon until it pops...and the millenial generation will get to enjoy that outcome.

the current generation if baby boomers wilo be dead.

now, think for a minute about your claim that he *raised* taxes on everyone else.  if true, why has corporate cap ex shrunk and yet consumer spending accounts for 83% of GDP?"

AmItheAsshole,fc6ge7n,t1_fc6fqi3,1577479952.0,"totally possible.  honestly.  between my job and some earlier experiences i am definitely jaded about relationships.  marriage is the worlds worst gamble if you are an earner.  

when my sister got married the only reason why my dad didnt force a prenup was because he had more money than she did at the time.

getting deeper into the weird shit, i'm pretty sure that my parents would have actually been considering seperation more seriously if we did not go on a disasterous trip together, where i got very drunk and lost it on them.  

i think they think i would melt down if they split...which is probably true"

AmItheAsshole,fc6fbqx,t1_fc6do2y,1577479230.0,"there is no question that it dampened any idea of longer term relationship beyond college.  my mom was lukewarm on her but kept it to herself, only years after we split did she share her true opinion.  but my dad was adament and he knew how to push my buttons.  

many people have criticized the term ""posioned"".  it think they are right.  it didnt rise to poison.  when i wrote this i didnt have a better word for it.  perhaps, now in retrospect, ""dampened my prospects"" or ""needlessly interferred with"""

i actually has a section in my first post explaining that depspite his tendency to be a bit of a prick, he is almost universally loved by family and friends.  he is a comedian in the truest sense, always cracking jokes and he is probably one of the most generous people around when anyone elses for help.  he is truly a lovely person and my personal hero...despite this situation.
