AskReddit,ffd4yva,t3_esse9d,1579813518.0,"Me, my mom and my younger sister were traveling to visit my moms cousin when I was about 4 or 5. We stopped at a really tiny grocery store. At the back of the store was a yellow fridge that looked like it could be from someones kitchen. You could buy stuff from the fridge and same with the freezer on top. I remember thinking it was funny because every other store I had ever been to, the fridge and the freezer had the clear glass doors so you could see what you wanted to get before you opened it. Anyways, in the freezer was a box of ice cream drum sticks. My mom didn't buy anything out of that freezer as we only had so much money on hand that we could spend at the time. As were standing in line to buy the potato salad and bagged salad for lunch, the guy in front of us got done buying his stuff, he turned around and he had two of those ice cream drum sticks in his hand. He gave one to me and one to my little sister. I don't recall his face but I do know he was wearing brown suit with shiny dress shoes."

If I'm on the right side and there is someone on the left side, I'll let them know that they should take it. If I'm in the center with someone else and they are in front of me? I'll let them know I'm defending so they can go for boost and push forward. It's not hard to communicate if you are not in comms with them and it gives the added effect of teaching them that teammates need to communicate at first until it becomes second nature to know 'I'm right here and he is right there so I should push/defend/go for boost/rotate back etc. You can assume that they know what they are doing and you do find players in rank that know but until they show that they know, I announce my movements. Even if I'm not in comms, I verbally announce what I'm doing on the field to keep me in the habit of announcing when in a party, what I'm doing.
