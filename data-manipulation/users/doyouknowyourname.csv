shameless,ffi7hri,t3_ethd4z,1579967107.0,I feel like vee wouldn't say that. It implies that there are even dirtier non-white people. Its the kind pf subtle racism we all ignore and have become numb to.
blackladies,ffhiz72,t1_ffgzq0x,1579937393.0,"I'm from America. Pennsylvania. But i feel like i go through what op is going through because of the things you said above. I grew up with my white moms family. My dad became uninvolved after my mom passed. So I didn't even have the grace to live with the white family member who willingly fell in love with a black person. I know my grandparents and their siblings loved my sister and I, but racism abd ignorance isn't going to just vanish from a person over night because they inhert some black children.

 What happened was I grew up thinking the Civil Rights Movement was the end of racism and everything was happy and right and perfect in the world but in reality I was just being shielded from even knowing what racism truly meant at home and in school. My grandmother didn't even really admit to us we were black until we heard it at school. And when the kids our school said/did racist things, well, then I saw racism as saying/doing mean things to a person because of their skin color. But I still didn't know why one person would choose to say mean things to another person just because their skin color was different. Why not eye color or haircolor or any other arbitrary thing? 

So in reality, I was just learning to hate myself and basically internalizing all the racism I saw and heard. And, it happened, sometimes subtly, sometimes overtly, all the time because the school we went to was all white. Then when I was eight, our family separated my sister and I, which made me the only person with any kind of color whatsoever in my tiny little grade school and my tiny little high school. 

I had to unlearn all of those toxic traits. I had to teach myself the full, real history of what black people endured in america and I'm still learning. It took awhile, and its agonizing to read the some of the worse parts of our history, but the better parts are always beautiful, black human beings overcoming astronomical odds and that's a truly, truly inspiring thing."

That said, to answer your question about why sone people bring up race. ""All the time"" is because they don't have the privilege to ignore it. Unlike a white person, nearly every aspect of my life is influenced by the color of my skin, whether i like it or not because its thrust upon me. 

Some white people say crazy things like ""I'm colorblind when it cones to race"" and that simply is not true. Thousands of studiesnon implicit bias can confirm that. And, while race is a human made concept and has no basis in science other than a measurably higher melanin content, i still have to deal with doctors treating me differently(worse) and getting less calls back for job applications than my white counter parts.

 Thats because we live in a society that has demonized black skin for centuries. They made have black skin illegal. There are still laws on the books that specifically put black people on a lower rung. Thousands of public murders were left untried and unpunished even when the whole town knew the perpetrators up until the 1980s. People are again today specifically targeting people of color to kill en masse. The people of this country voted for the same disgustingly racist idiot that the kkk pit their supprt behind in 2016. When you have race (because its forcibly put on you) everything is related to race.

Unless you actively teach the reasons why it not the case, they might start to believe the troubles the black community faces in the US and around the world are the fault of black people themselves. Thats hpw you get black republicans (not that corporate dems are good, just less evil) And then maybe and hopefully they grow up and realize racism is very very real, but unfortunately that usually means something terrible happened in their lives solely based on their skin color.

Its literally the same thing. My life depends on being connected to yours to continue. The fetuses life depend on being connected to the mother. I'll die if you disconnect me. The fetus will die if you disconnect it. Why is the fetus's right to life more important than mine? Easy, its not.

What it boils down to is you think your right to a life unimposed by others shouldn't extend to women because you see women as a literal baby making machines and nothing more. Its the exact same concept in both scenarios and in both cases no one has any responsibility to stay attached so the other can live. 

If you continue to refuse to see the difference, well thats just pigheadedness. I've laid it all out for you.

LifeProTips,fcymz81,t1_fcycq4v,1578083057.0,"As a black woman, just because a black person performs an action doesn't mean that action is not racist. Now is the black person a racist for voting that way? No. And I can even kind of almost see the rationale fpr voting for your immediate family above your people, in certain circumstances. In the end, I still think its at the very least a selfish or ignorant act. And how any black person can support Donald fucking Trump after the evil ignorant shit he does and says, it beyond that even. Repulican might as well be short hand for 'I stand with the white supremacists.'



There is no way around the fact that conservative policy and even moreso, this new and improved(in the most destructive way possible) Trump Republican-ism that has gripped white, evangelical America is detrimental for most black citizens. Like, I neeed healthcare, bro!

 Conservativism literally means taking the slowest pace possible to progress or change. We need rapid fire change. The black community is hurting. Having more money for social programs is never going to detrimental, thats why we need to vote for progressives who actually care about social issues abd the environment and representation. To vote for Republicans is to vote for defunding the very basic social programs we have now, which theyre rapidly trying to do, along with gutting the EPA. Locking up brown people on the border for npt being able to prove they're citizenship. Literally guessing at countries for deportation of people who they can't find the info. Even toddlers. Just sending them to random fucking countries, only after lockimg then in wire cages for weeks on end with tootbrushes or clean water or adequate plumbing. And some of those kids just get taken away to adopt put to childless white ""savior"" parents. 

By the way, I am 4 more times more likely than a white woman to die in child birth and even shes more likely to die than those in any other developed countries by quite a lot because of our bullshit health care system. But no ones talking about that for some reason.


Also to defund planned Parenthood like the Republican s like to do os asinine. Even if your against abortion, why make contraception harder abd harder to get when thats the one thing that would prevent a lot of unnecessary abortions. Unless you just want a way to control women which is fucked up.


There's literally no reason to vote republican as a black person. Or any person of color or poor person or woman. None.


Edit: remember the guy that trump called his African-American? Even he abandoned this pile of burning shit."

Why in the world do i need prior authorization when my doctor wrote me the prescription because i needed it in the first place? And being that i got sick at such a young age, i will never be able to make more money than the cutoff for Medicaid which is abysmally low. Thank god my state expanded medicaid at all when the aca passed or I'd be SOL right now and honestly i probably would've just ended it. Not to be morbid, but being this sick with absolutely zero hope of getting better or any kind of help is enough to make a person suicidal, ya know?"

PoliticalDiscussion,fchxxx0,t1_fcgu6in,1577655433.0,"You should probably do some reading yourself. The type of abortion you described doesnt even exist. Most abortiins happen at 6 weeks. The only ""abortions"" that happen late term are because the mother's life is in danger, abd generally thats just inducing birth to a fetus that isn't viable. So it falls under your own standards for exception. 

I can't imagine any one carries a baby into its third trimester and then decides they don't want it. That just doesnt happen very often. And if it does, putting more and more barriers in place for allowing quick simple safe and painless  procedures very early in pregnancy isn't helping anyone achieve your goal. Stop voting for the party that defunds planned parenthood, one of the largest providers of birth control which therefore has one of the largest impacts on preventing abortions from being necessary. 

If you care about children, don't vote for the party that defunds social programs that help children, or the party that expects charity to solve the problems capitalism creates, like mass poverty and in equality around the world, when its very obvious that that wont wotk because it isn't. Repulicans don't want to provide food or education for America's children, but you want to tell women they have to carry every accidental pregnancy to term or, at least, make it ridiculously hard to end the pregnancy, anyway. 

It's like republicans want to see as many people suffering as possible. I just will never understand you. You play economics on paper with absolutely zero regard as to how those policiea affect real people's live in very real and painful ways. You want to blame the people for being moral failures rather than acknowledging that its the system that makes these people, because somehow,despite all the bad things you've done and the people you hurt because you can justify those catiins because you have the context to do so, but everyone has their own context to justify what they do. We're all just trying to survive while trying not to thibk about our imment deaths, but more people sufferung doesn't bother you because you're judgement tells you they deserve it.

 Where is your conpassion for your neighbors? Are you a Christian? You know what Jesus says about neighbors. And you know what the Good Samaritan did. But a republican vote does the opposite. A vote for a republican always inevitably hurts the most vulnerable people in our society. They cut food stamps, public housing funds, education funds, and medicare/medicaid only to spend even more on the military futilely blowing people up in other countries(always brown ones because America is a very racist place especially red areas. We might oppose war if it were against white people. In fact, im sure we would.) 

And why dont you realize by now that free markets are a synonym for oligarchs. You're trying to give the already most powerful people in the world more and more power. Is it because you secretly fantasize about being a billionaire one day? Because you wont be. You could work full time getting paid $2000 (yes thousand) from the time of Jesus Christ until now and still not have as much money as the 50 richest people on earth. But you want them to be less regulated. Why? Because you trust a single unelected individual over your own govenment and constitution? Because you guys also say you love the constitution! Its all a contradictory mess."
PoliticalDiscussion,fcgrg9z,t1_fcbsace,1577643302.0,"According to your comment like three down from here, your parents were going to vote red long before impeachment. Your mom was convinced a year ago because of ""late term abortions"" (not a thing). Gtfoh and stop lying."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fc9csv4,t1_fc7sadd,1577550653.0,"But using the word racism in that context diminishes what ot actually is which is a construct made by those in power to oppress those not. It wouldn't hurt you to use the word prejudiced instead. Very few things can happen to a white person in this way. It's things loke being called a name. For people of color the prejudice against them is ingrained in our systems, organizations and law. Pretending the two equate is not helpful to anyone. When you're using the same line white supremacists use because semantically you think its correct, thats a slippery slope. 

Im tired and i don't want to explain further. There are great books and documentaries that deal with this. Find some of those. Its imperative that yoy know all the history of ""race"" in western society before you start putting your opinions about it out in the world. What you'll learn is that to be white in America is to literally not have race. No ones going to discrriminate against when it comes to housing and doctors probably actually help you when you see them. You'll live longer and be multitudes less likely to die in childbirth. You'll be able to get low interest loans more easily or a good education. 

Idk don't know man. Its just not the same."
