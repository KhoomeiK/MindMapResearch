socialanxiety,fej2rr9,t3_epf0ab,1579154747.0,"You can get money by filling out surveys online, from what i have heard the pay is way below minimum wage, if you live near an university or research center you can get cash by participating in research studies (paid by the hour), typically pays a bit below minimum wage, and you would need to consider if the transportation time is worth it."

mcgill,fdc9ewh,t3_ekjap9,1578269710.0,Not Peel/Mcgill but you can take the 144 bus from Sherbrooke or Atwater and get dropped in front of Stewart bio. Unfortunately it only comes every 25-30 min and is often late

mcgill,fcbg4p1,t1_fc2cxfc,1577586448.0,LMAO pretty much all research labs at Mcgill require you to send in a transcript when applying and most of them aren't even paid. If you are low-mid 3s its fine anything lower and you might as well drop out caus you aren't going to be making money anytime soon
