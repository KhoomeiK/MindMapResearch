MMA,ffk7i6p,t1_ffjw881,1580018218.0,There's fighters that can get away with putting themselves in 50/50 situations due to an iron jaw though and Pico certainly isn't one of them lol he's no Gaetje
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffdq6xw,t1_ffdaqlj,1579826311.0,"I’d bet you would find out dragging a person for a mile becomes very exhausting. At least most people run on concrete, dragging a body in the woods over uneven terrain is far more strenuous."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffdppu8,t1_ffdo70v,1579826012.0,If you’re trying to run a mile as hard as you can it can feel awfully long.

climbergirls,ff7zu71,t3_erzyvl,1579662328.0,"Holy take a deep breath girl. You've obviously been through a lot. 

I've broken my scaphoid before, albiet mine never required surgery as it wasn't displaced. That being said the process of getting your range of motion and strength back in that wrist is going to be slow and frustrating at times, moreso in my opinion than many other injuries I've had due to how much you demand from your wrist as far as strength in so many different directions.

I think to be fully comfortable again doing pushups and really feeling like I wasn't at a huge deficit anymore mine took 9 months and I was regular with my physical therapy. My cousin is a PT so I didn't actually see anyone, but she gave me range of motion exercises to do as well as whenever I could throughout the day putting my hands down flat on a table or counter in front of me and leaning forward into it adding weight and pushing into the range of motion as far as I felt comfortable and in fact to the point where it is a bit uncomfortable as any stretch should be to gain flexibility. 

The process is slow, but if your last surgery was in June and you went back to climbing a month later that also is probably asking a lot. I would really get onto your PT and remember everyone's recovery time can be different, but it's totally possible you'll regain full strength and most of your range of motion back I think.

Best of luck to you and if you have any other questions feel free to ask!"
