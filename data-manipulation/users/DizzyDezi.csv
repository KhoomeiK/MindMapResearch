""There was also another cougar attack in B.C. in the past week.

On Saturday, an 11-year-old boy from Boston Bar, B.C., escaped without injury when his golden retriever stepped between him and a charging cougar.

The cat was shot and killed on scene by an RCMP officer.""

From a CNN article about Angel the dog:

""Forman said when her nephew pulled the cougar's body off Angel, who at first appeared fatally injured, the dog sucked in a ""big breath of air and then got up."" Ever the protector, Angel ""walked to Austin, sniffed him to make sure he was alright, then sat down."" Despite receiving a few deep bites and scratches Angel's prognosis is good.

""She had some pretty nasty injuries across the front of her head and neck"" said veterinarian Jack Anvik who is treating Angel at the Sardis Animal Hospital. ""If there had been enough time for the two of them together the cougar would have probably killed the dog,"" he told CNN.
According to his mother, Austin is so thankful for Angel's bravery that he ""went to town with his grandpa and bought a huge steak for her.""

""I feel very good now that we know she's alive and the fact that she saved me and survived is amazing,"" Austin told CNN. And Angel appears to be in good spirits while she recovers at the Animal Hospital.

""She's a golden retriever,"" Anvik said. ""They're always happy."""
