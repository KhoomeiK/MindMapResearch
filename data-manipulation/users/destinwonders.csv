ptsd,ferkl0l,t3_eqd6b2,1579355098.0,Usually after working with it you’ll start to remember more things. It’s one of the things that happens when you go through trauma.
ptsd,ferj2u9,t3_eqbwfo,1579354537.0,I feel the exact same. It’s so hard to function in a society that doesn’t care about how you feel.
HazbinHotel,fe4q73o,t3_enpcz9,1578861805.0,SO CLEAR
HazbinHotel,fe4ozd1,t3_enpovs,1578861527.0,I wish they worked that way. I’d do it all the time haha.
asktransgender,fdzy2rn,t1_fdzw753,1578798617.0,"Yea, exactly what I think. Dysphoria is getting the best of me :("
asktransgender,fdzy0ff,t1_fdzupxb,1578798571.0,I think I will! It’s just that dysphoria gets at me sometimes.
asktransgender,fdzxux6,t1_fdzuotm,1578798458.0,Thanks! That’s exactly what I do too. “Dustin?” “Yep” haha
depression,fdsmk9n,t3_emr4dw,1578705166.0,"Yes. It hasn’t just caused depression/anxiety, but part of my ptsd is from it. At first when I was young I thought it was “teasing”. Then when I got into high school I realized I was being bullied most of my life before. Then I was bullied in high school. It really sucks. I don’t have any friends. I’m too scared to make them."
socialanxiety,fdm2qyh,t3_em1qd6,1578538415.0,Honestly though. I remember the ones that were strict about this didn’t even give a shit if you did. They would say things like “well what are you gonna do in the real world” and other bullshit.
depression,fdkwow1,t3_elqwy9,1578512713.0,"Honestly, I have no clue. But I think it’s because of bullying in highschool, and a toxic relationship then as well."
chinchilla,fdfxgnn,t3_el5rkq,1578372897.0,"Cons: they chew up everything, so much POOP, can be skittish, needing air conditioning (if you don’t have it). 
Pros: SOFT, very cute, pretty easy to take care of, loving, experience, soft."
conspiracy,fdfx4i5,t3_ekvimq,1578372610.0,Wow what bullshit
