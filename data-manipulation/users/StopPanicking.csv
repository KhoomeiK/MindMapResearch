depression,ffiuu2y,t3_etvq3s,1579983281.0,"I hear you on that. I started journaling late Dec 2019 and reading Louise Hay to safely dig through my childhood trauma. While I was able to come to the conclusion that a lot of my negative thought forms hidden deep within my subconscious are due to the way others treated me, I still struggle. I just can’t control it. My body weakens or becomes numb with everyday. I’m just mentally exhausted and unhappy. I realize that while these thoughts exist and my reality is a reflection of my mind, I can’t break free. I think it’s because I just truly hate myself and my life. I am constantly being attacked for existing by others and it’s not fair. My life isn’t what I envisioned it to be when I was younger and it sucks."
publichealth,ffc8mrx,t3_cwf7l1,1579794046.0,"Hi, I’m thinking heavily about getting a MSPH in epidemiology or health policy with a focus on data analytics. I have a few questions though! I’ll be 4 years post undergrad soon and I have very minimal research experience. I completed a summer research internship and a capstone course during undergrad but that’s about it. Since graduating, I have completed a year with AmeriCorps and worked primarily in healthcare. I was premed but I soon realized that I’d rather focus on examining and mitigating health and education disparities instead.

My question is, do programs expect applicants to already have a strong foothold in research and/or data analysis? I was strong in both areas during undergrad but I was more drawn to service. I don’t regret my decisions but I wish that I put more time into research.

Nevertheless, I was wondering what the average applicant would look like? I really love the program at UNC, UMD, or JHU and would like some insight.

I’ll be studying for the GRE in the meantime."
NewToEMS,ff3dbgr,t3_eqjw6u,1579538833.0,I took it last Thursday and got kicked off at 70 questions too! I got my results the next day and passed! Don’t worry too much.
depression,feavcpf,t3_eo28e0,1578952539.0,"You're not alone. I feel like giving up every day only to back down after I've made my plan. I just feel exhausted with living, feeling inadequate, and alone. Life always had its ups and downs for me. I just want balance and equilibrium. Or at least the ability to be decisive and brave enough to succeed."
depression,fdkndph,t3_elqwy9,1578507174.0,"Negative thoughts that keep cycling in my head due to previous childhood trauma that’s gone unresolved for years. I didn’t realize how detrimental my negative thought patterns were until recently. It’s the primary reason why I’ve held myself back from experiencing life. I hated myself and didn’t think I deserved happiness because of lies I was fed by virtually everyone for years. The reason why I finally woke up? I finally became mentally exhausted due to beating myself for years. It finally took a mental toll. On top of all this, I have social anxiety disorder. Even with all of these mental obstacles, I’m finally taking my life back."
Anxiety,fd2nfnx,t3_ejsckx,1578149718.0,I hope that there won’t be a war for the sake of the innocent people that would lose their lives as a result. Stay safe dude.
socialskills,fccrqsy,t3_egq56x,1577601858.0,Best thing I’ve ever done. It’s not worth your mental health. I’ll be cutting off family next.
socialskills,fc7rvst,t3_eglewi,1577517037.0,"So true, it’s always best to move on because chances are all will be forgotten."
