It takes a lot of concentration and skill to be off-the-cuff funny.  Too much ""comedy"" and your gameplay suffers and the audience can feel you force it.  Too little and you're not entertaining to listen to and they tune out.  Likewise, too much interaction devalues your streaming and annoys people that want to see you play the game and want to see your opinion on it before possibly purchasing it or seeing what you or the game has to offer.  Ignoring your audience means people will also stop watching because they could simply watch curated, edited videos on YT if they didn't want interaction.

If you enjoy roleplaying with them and you think their main barrier to this is their lack of extra writing, tell them.  Be encouraging, because writing in something that isn't one's native language is daunting.

This can extend to even talking out of character and you may make a good friend in the process.

Firstly, what comes before all of this for all content creators is the script.  Basically, you're writing a paper, without the finer points of it.  The easiest thing to so start with this basic structure:

1. Intro.  End Intro with thesis.
2. First point.
   1. Evidence of this.  Your analysis of this. (Repeat this until you make your point)
3. Second point.
   1. Evidence of this.  Your analysis of this. (Repeat this until you make your point)
4. Etc until you finish every bullet point.
5. Outro.  Final thoughts and because this is in video format...
   1. Telling your audience to subscribe, ding the bell, check you out on social media, leave comments to help the YT algorithm suggest you to people etc.

In videos your points can entirely be made without video clips, just narration, but most people don't want to see that, so you'll have to find a way to get the clips.  Getting familiar with editing software will also be good because what you purchase or download to use to edit your videos will dictate the limitations of how you can edit it.  Some software does more, some does less, and for meme-related edits, it depends.  Content awareness scaling can't be done in everything.  Pausing on someone's displeased face, turning it grayscale, and playing the *Curb Your Enthusiasm* themesong is achievable even in Windows Movie Maker.  Basically, what you need is a good basis and writing because even with any fancy software, without good writing, the video is just filler.  The rest is basically making jokes.

&#x200B;

Other bits that might help:  Starting your videos with a disclaimer about fair use, reading up on it, flipping the video clips or speeding them up slightly also helps avoid the Youtube copyright matches as well as overlaying royalty free music on it..."

Oil slicks don't really cycle/change colors based on light refraction.  They may change a little, but not through all the shades. There are also multichromes (duochromes and more) where they only cycle through three or two colors.  On cars these are called Chameleon paints.

Think of how dark a balloon can look, but look lighter when you blow air into it and it stretches.
