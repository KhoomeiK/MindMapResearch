unpopularopinion,fgqqbig,t3_ezr8r7,1581029243.0,"Well, OP, the last two days for me has changed my view on people struggling with their weight. I was just told I have a tumor on my hypothalamus, and that I have been living with Hypothalamic Disease. I am over weight for my height and i have difficulty losing it. I cant even keep a job. It took me 37 retakes to get my GED. I dropped out of high school because social anxiety was so bad for me that i got suicidal if people saw me. I cant sleep unless im heavily medicated AND stoned off my ass. This is because I've had a disease I didn't know about that ive apparently had for at least 15 years depending on the age of my tumor.

I am overweight because i cant control it. Even if i do everything right. I can't control my appetite and i cant control how i feel. Sometimes i eat to feel anything. Because i have nothing else to help me aside from pot. Now im not obese or anything. Ive went from 180 to my embarrassing weight now. Ive gained and lost weight all of my life struggling with it. This problem i have affects my pineal gland functions as well. I cant exercise because im always struggling with weak ess and exhaustion that i could never figure out until all this unraveled.


To make an entirely long reply short(er) ... I will have to say your opinion is valid to those who havent experienced problems or those who dont know what the real problems are. I feel like once you are slapped in the face like i was not that long ago... You realize you never truly knew what was going on with anyone because you are not them and they could be suffering from a disease or other health concerns that are beyond our realm of control.

Be humble. Try to relate, even if you cant. You could be that overweight person in a wheelchair or some random guy on reddit who just found out his life expectancy has been cut in half. You do not know what is affecting people that have those issues. It could be anything."
