Generally a nice, level-headed guy, but he would lose his cool anytime someone called him out. One day, he was driving with his gf through the suburbs, when a guy he knows pulls up next to him at a stoplight with his friends and calls him out to race. He declined, but when the dude called him chicken, he just lost it and decided to race him. Ended up crashing into this rich dude's Rolls Royce.
