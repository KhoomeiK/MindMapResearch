PS4,ffk0frp,t1_ffiv7k4,1580012020.0,"Japan is a fairly small market really.  The rest of Asia is mostly South Korea, China is potentially huge but the Chinese don't hold much love for Japan and all gaming consoles are only beginning to gain traction in China due to more modern entertainment trade deals.

PlayStation dominates in both South America and most of Europe, they are also well regarded in the middle East too and a few countries in Africa.  These are markets MS doesn't even support with a few exceptions.  It isn't even a contest really.  They were much better than MS at localization of basic functions and games, they are penetrating more markets by the simple virtue of usability in native languages, among other things.

NA and the UK are the only secure footing MS has nowadays.  The rollout of gamepass is really helping them stem the bleeding of customers.  That was a short term smart move but I'm somewhat doubting of long term profitability and ability to push consoles.  The PC/Xbox bridge seems to be their biggest strength now.

Nextgan may be different with the aggressive acquisition of some great studios but we've seen great studios die in MS hands so time will tell.  I'd put my money on Sony though as they have better international infrastructure and penetration.  It isn't just the US and Japan now, this is a global market."

Furthermore it is not all white people, a chunk surely, but by lumping everyone white in you are creating the same false narrative of say, all black people.

They heaved the seat like it was a hail Mary pass and that flew out of bounds.  Plastic flew everywhere as it just fell apart.  Then they picked the seat up and dropped it again.  After that they just threw like 10 broken pieces onto the belt haphazardly.

Reach our destination and it was unusable, it came off the baggage claim in 4 sets of pieces, 3 sets in bins.  We waited at the American Airlines desk for an hour to be told it wasn't their fault and that they had no car seats and wouldn't pay for a new one.

science,fct5jin,t1_fcsx2gu,1577933429.0,"Well the oil and coal industries lobbied the government and sought to mar public perception.

You'd think the Exxon oil spills would have reversed those efforts, or the BP catastrophe, but maybe they were more removed because they mostly just ruined the poor oceans.  Which is bogus because of the amount of indirect economic damage.

It seems that Americans only understand direct damage, such as the world trade center, to act.  It is really like ignoring gangrene until you have no legs, or known cancer you just let slide.

But hey, it only effects the future so who cares, I guess.  The short sightedness extends to almost everything, from economic to war to infrastructure, to structure of government.  It seems quite pervasive and I find that tragic, we know what to do but greed and short gains push us into short cuts that become long term nightmares."
