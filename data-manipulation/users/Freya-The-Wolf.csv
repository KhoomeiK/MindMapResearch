AnthemTheGame,fenaq7z,t3_eq0d5a,1579280650.0,"Also, if you're playing interceptor with the legendary rally cry (the one that autorezzes downed teammates if they're in range) and use it just as you die, you rez yourself. Somehow managed to do that a couple days ago."
NoahGetTheBoat,fegd2wq,t1_fegbxs0,1579088325.0,Good bot

oddlyspecific,fegcp3d,t1_fegcm9i,1579087861.0,"Nope, the post in question was a pic of antivax stickers I found in a public bathroom with a title similar to ""why are people spreading these lies?"""
oddlyspecific,fegckvv,t1_fegby4m,1579087718.0,Uh because it's a subreddit to make fun of antivaxxers? And antivaxxers are stupid and wrong?

aww,fdr51ll,t1_fdr2mm3,1578679647.0,"We know he's Boston terrier and pug, but the chihuahua is just a guess since he doesn't have a squished in nose. Though it's entirely possible his Boston side just didn't have the squished nose, since I've seen many without it. I live with my parents, and my mom is a foster participant in mwbtr (midwest Boston terrier rescue), so I've seen my fair share of Bostons lol. Around 30 different ones! The one in the pic was a foster that we adopted, since he fit so perfectly in our family. He just got his offical tags today!"

actuallesbians,fdop8wx,t1_fdop339,1578609815.0,"Said my age in a previous comment. You said you learned LGBTQ+ slang in LGBTQ+ second grade when you came out 11 years ago. If you deleted it, I have screenshots."
actuallesbians,fdop0mw,t1_fdoojtq,1578609677.0,"There are no errors in what I just said. Would you like me to take the classes so I can show you the A+ I got without any practice? And sure, you're allowed to write whatever you want, but you said you never insulted them, which you did. I'm not ""defending"" dick. I'm defending innocent straight men, the ones who would never send unsolicited pics or creepy messages. Those people exist. A small percent should never define how you see an entire group. It's like saying ""well one black girl was mean to me, so all black girls are mean!"" It's stereotyping, and that's incredibly rude and inconsiderate."
actuallesbians,fdookpl,t1_fdon70i,1578609408.0,"Also, never seen someone unironically use the laughing crying emoji. And if you came out in second grade, which you say is 11 years ago for you, and second graders are 7, that means you're 18. And you still use emojis unironically."
actuallesbians,fdoobli,t1_fdonylw,1578609254.0,"You insulted the poem.
Which was about a man and a dog.
Also, your bio is literally ""NO FUCKING MEN ALLOWED""."

actuallesbians,fdonsov,t1_fdonh7s,1578608937.0,"I'm not the one who first brought up how aMaZiNg my writing skills are. And the poem was about a dead dog. You just insulted someone going through one of the most painful things in life. But I bet you don't care because he's a man and ""mEn dOnT hAvE fEeLiNgS."" Also, the use of the face emojis makes this comment all the cringier. Lmao."
actuallesbians,fdone3e,t1_fdon70i,1578608692.0,Did you learn LGBTQ+ slang terms in second grade? Pretty sure you didn't.
actuallesbians,fdonadq,t1_fdomt5f,1578608630.0,"""Good reading g"" found an error! I'm also a writer, you can see my most recent poem on r/writingprompts if you so choose. I was referring to the errors that you not-so-subtly edited out of your first comment. I already know queer women are being raped constantly, but so are men! And I'm not the one breaking out the cuss words because ""how daRE AN INTERNET STRANGER HAVE OPINIONS!!!1!1"".
Give me a second to find some articles, since you want research."

actuallesbians,fdom0b2,t1_fdolg3p,1578607867.0,"Thank you for being respectful in bringing up this point, unlike OP. Since it already said butch, I made assumptions."
actuallesbians,fdolvcl,t1_fdolioe,1578607786.0,"I'm a lesbian in a 2 ½ year relationship. And besides bois it says anyone interested in the community, and that it's not an exclusive community. Why the fuck would a 16 year old be on reddit as a dating site?"
