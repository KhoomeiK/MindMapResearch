Be warned though- this is brutally hard work and if your training was like mine they taught you nothing to prepare you for casual teaching. I will not go back to it without ten years experience as I am completely unequipped for it. 

If you can't or don't want to work full time, you might be better off looking for a school where you can work part time. Contact all your local schools and let them know when you are available. Contracts come up here and there, I did one term as a casual then one on contract then got a full time gig. I wasn't going to learn anything without the full time role as you get beginning teacher support (in Qld at least) and lots of tips on practice and planning. Good luck!!"

I was drowning and not coping with behaviour management but at the end of week six I realised there was only another 3 weeks until assessments then holidays, and I could hang in there for just a few more weeks. By the end of week 8 I was back on top of it, less planning as exams were coming so I didn't need to put in 60 hour weeks any more. Then in term 2, when I started to feel overwhelmed in the middle of term, I knew I just had to hang in there. So stick with it and get all the support you can from your team.
