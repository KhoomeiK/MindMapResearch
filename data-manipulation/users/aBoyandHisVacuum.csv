Justrolledintotheshop,fffqmbe,t1_fffpz8g,1579889676.0,Unreal. Im 30 and my biology degree bores me. Pays the bills but Im.on a journey to learn all I can before cars disappear. So cheers. You are very well read. Question.. it says the Western Union splice is best for solid not stranded. Do you use it for both? Or another method for stranded?
Justrolledintotheshop,fffoglg,t1_fffoaj4,1579888340.0,You may have changed how I wire 120v. Yussﬂ!! Love the tips. Dropping an order of those right now.
Justrolledintotheshop,fffnujb,t1_fffnnwo,1579887970.0,Thank you. This is golden.
Justrolledintotheshop,fffnsyz,t1_fffnp5p,1579887943.0,Well that sounds dope!! Im all for that. I'll look it up.
Justrolledintotheshop,fffnafc,t1_ffff8rn,1579887633.0,"Im alittle new to wiring. And yes I hate it. But in your opinion. What is the best splice option? I've tried a few. I like the ones with butt connectors and lead, glue shrinkwrap built in. But I've heard even those fail.

Edit-Well off to the garage to redo all my wiring ;) cheers for the amazing knowledge. I'll be reaching out as I hone the skill. Zap zap"
chicago,fffmku4,t1_fffd18m,1579887198.0,I was curious. And your assumption is dead on. Hahah. Check out his comment history....Type A

Documentaries,ff9l4be,t1_ff968mh,1579715288.0,What's nice is all these super wealthy die. And hopefully their kids blow it on cars and houses so I can buy some foreclosed mansion in 50 years :(
Documentaries,ff9kx2t,t1_ff9fubt,1579715170.0,This... Everything this. I saw a 60 second car video today. No back story. No lag. Just exactly how to weld this part and done. No please subscribe. Nothing. I couldn't believe it. It gave me hope for once.
worldnews,ff497nv,t1_ff47jui,1579558294.0,Im sorry. Never meant to come off so delusional. Just wanted to promote high paying paychecks for those of us who were told they don't exist. I just mean to promote that their are wild careers out there. I know of park designer. Who started from 30k who's now at Disney doing park design for 220k. I just mean to bring a solid reply but im slipping.
worldnews,ff43gdv,t1_ff40kze,1579554708.0,Agreed. Can't say it enough. Like yes envy the cash. But most these people are hollow boring shells. They kicked ass cause everyone hated them growing up. Hahah ok I'll stop
worldnews,ff3x885,t1_ff3sh50,1579550834.0,A degree.....
worldnews,ff3wmas,t1_ff3w2ss,1579550447.0,Also. Cheers from the Bio Side. Im at Abbott Labs.
worldnews,ff3wgrt,t1_ff3w2ss,1579550352.0,I wish I didn't come off like that :( I should proofread. But you... You are the backbone to our industry and you guys barely max around 70k it's sad. You deserve so much more. Many of my buddies are in the lab. And im so jealous of their careers cause of the cool state of the art equipment. I'll step back and rethink these comments. Mad respect for what you do.
worldnews,ff3w54c,t1_ff3ua80,1579550152.0,You are a really good person. All I have to say is cheers man. Keep up the hard work.
worldnews,ff3vrrt,t1_ff3ogka,1579549922.0,Very very true. It sucks that alot of my respondents live in rural or urban areas where it's extremely depressing. There career options. I digress. Ive worked in a few different states. But im still very isolated. I'll shut the fuck up. But most of y'all need to go-to college and get the fuck out of your bullshit situations. That's my end point. Go out there. Go for it. Whatever.
worldnews,ff3vb2e,t1_ff3sgh4,1579549632.0,It's actually.... We were wrong. Im a d/c- average student. I barely graduated HS. In all remedial courses. I went on to graduate college with and realized.    The grades and intelligence were not even half of what was required. Just being able to have a beer with a boss meant way more. Which most of my super smart. Good grades colleagues can't do. End of rant.
worldnews,ff3v350,t1_ff3riyx,1579549496.0,Yes and no. I have a shit biology degree with a C+ average. There is alot of just playing the game. Or reaching out. It's hard to explain but I really wish more people realized how obtainable these careers are.
worldnews,ff3tm0s,t1_ff3nsfc,1579548579.0,It's still relevant. Hahahah
worldnews,ff3n36y,t1_ff3n1rt,1579544580.0,Don't we all.
worldnews,ff3ml3n,t1_ff3m870,1579544267.0,Yes yes. This is true. But I've worked in other states. With completely new people... And I've met so many walks of life doing all kinds of things and making way more then we were ever told growing up. That's my point. Wild ass positions out there making crazy money. And I met many of these people by offering to have a beer or grab lunch.
worldnews,ff3lcvc,t1_ff3l4vm,1579543505.0,That's the kind of thoughts that make me so sad. Yes yes anyone can get those jobs. Stay in school kids. There's so much out there..
worldnews,ff3kwr0,t1_ff3kocx,1579543231.0,"Glassdoor.com.  Any director position at Pfizer, Baxter, etc. Thats just pharma. Tech. Netflix. You name it. If you don't beleive me PM me and I'll get you a paystub from several of my friends."
worldnews,ff3km51,t1_ff3k7y0,1579543049.0,We are beyond similar. Dad's a carpenter so I grew up carrying drywall in mid Winter Chicago. Went to college and was like. Omg. You'll pay me 70k to sit on Reddit all day. Ok... Eventually it got to me. Went back to construction and wrenching.... Well.... I have bills and people don't always pay. And it's cold and dangerous. So now im back. And Im alittle older and wiser now. And I have to say I really really appreciate the warm desk and no more roofs mid Winter. It might be boring and full of fakes. But im alot happier now knowing I can eat tomorrow. Lol  I do miss wrenching. But that's what my garage is for.
worldnews,ff3k87i,t1_ff3jv9i,1579542816.0,Honestly? Any big corporate firm. Big pharma just pays ungodly amounts for easy spots. Just need a degree. STEM opens alot of doors. Of course you have to understand it's dull. It's very much like the movie Office space. But if you remind yourself not to absorb the office politics and enjoy the free hot choclates...life gets alot easier.
worldnews,ff3jbve,t1_ff3j87w,1579542267.0,Hahaha cheers!! You get it! Im in Big pharma. It's easy peezy. Just gotta know how to play the game.
worldnews,ff3j8p4,t1_ff3iq34,1579542215.0,Many. Many of my PHd buddies and medical friends failed because they were rude ass people and can't socialize well. I very much agree with you. When I have community college buddies who are doing well cause they played the game right. And knew how to shmooze.
worldnews,ff3j01s,t1_ff3i2rr,1579542068.0,Agreed. And it also depends on the career. I work in big pharma and connections are the reason im here. Some of my friends make 300k+ and we do nothing all day at times.
worldnews,ff3iw5d,t1_ff3hcvw,1579542001.0,Many of my colleagues make 300k as directors and managers. Plus many many benefits and even work from home half the year. There's plenty out there.
TreesSuckingOnThings,ff01ev2,t3_eqs7y6,1579464119.0,You guys realize that a tree lifted a 400lbs+ engine!
projectcar,fezzpjy,t1_fezypya,1579463633.0,It's def a work in progress. When im bored or have no money for new parts I paint something or try to learn a new technique in dipping or powder coating. This is my canvas. But it's funny cause I'll get something wired up. Then 6 months later. Hate it and wanna re do it. So alot of different thoughts and moods in this build ;)
projectcar,fezwbm3,t1_fezvghz,1579462499.0,"Thanks man! First project car. So alot of learning. But so far I have officially doubled the horse power from 170 to 302 with just bolt ons and a tune. ID 1050x, GS up pipe, Cobb Down, Cobb In, STP exhaust, 11 blade VF52, FuelLab filter and fpr, motul fluids. Boosted Performance Tune. Im sure im missing stuff. But the real fun is the Allpine 8 speaker system I built. Lol"

VacuumCleaners,fcv7n1g,t1_fcv7fd3,1577996335.0,Yeah that's so odd. Why would that be the feature and not in every model. But yeah longer cord is the best
VacuumCleaners,fcv7574,t1_fcv6urj,1577996035.0,The bottom one. It has the most features. And seems like the best version. And I think black is sexier. Lol
VacuumCleaners,fcv6rgu,t3_ej1hzw,1577995809.0,Basicly the same motor just different designs see if you.can try one out at a local store and narrow it down. All are solid choices.

Bankruptcy,fcthx8o,t1_fctf8vf,1577943857.0,Yeah alot of times its way cheaper to write it off or have it as a loss on their books. And many people owe 12k on a 6k car. So it's not worth it sometimes. Idk. Im rooting for ya.
Bankruptcy,fctexih,t1_fct5adk,1577941085.0,"It costs more some times to pay for repay, storage, auction, etc. You may get lucky! And im hoping you do."
biology,fct1p1a,t1_fcsuv8t,1577930583.0,Love love love this!! My favorite class and professor in college was my local flora pressor. And it was everything I wanted out of college. Field trips.

Documentaries,fclrq57,t3_ehpyt0,1577754856.0,Honestly....as a biologist. This is old news. But for the young Redditors who will soon be executives. Cheers and hope this changes the status quo
Bankruptcy,fclfyys,t3_ehskaz,1577746896.0,Absolutely not. You will be absolutely fine. If you get behind on any bills. Let them know youll get a paycheck soon. They will work with you. No reason for a guy in your situation to do that. I know so many making $60k with 300k in debt. Please. Ur fine
todayilearned,fcl1oco,t1_fcl18t0,1577737878.0,"Fully understood. And I apologise for the Snarky tone. But I value my towns amenities and I know my tax dollars pay for them. That's all. . But I'll shut up. :) So yeah the house was about 230,000 and I im paying $1700 a month for a 30 year mortgage. And the taxes. Just outside of Chicago are about 7400 a year for me. Which the 1700 includes.   But it oddly ranges here. Because I have several friends with 800,000 homes and they pay marginally less compared to me. It all depends on village/city. Etc."
todayilearned,fchnr79,t1_fchnf76,1577652157.0,"10 year? It's 15 to 30 in America. And people have no idea how much taxes pay for. Schools, malls, parks, parades. I understand... Government is bad blah blah. But has no one ever played SimCity? And yes I pay 7400 a year on a 230,000 mortgage."
todayilearned,fchl0vc,t1_fche7uc,1577651463.0,It would be only 3200$.....a year for taxes
