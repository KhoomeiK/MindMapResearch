college,fesh41c,t1_fes9p86,1579365024.0,Unfortunately I'm not able to drop anything as none of of the classes are offered over the summer. I'm slowly getting used to it I think. I just keep telling myself that in 3 months it will be over for at least a little bit.
college,felhnfj,t1_felclux,1579222396.0,"Thanks! I think it will be alright. He's actually a really great professor, his tests are just awful."
college,fekupuq,t1_feko7bo,1579207989.0,Fair enough. It's just frustrating having to give the school so much money for a class I haven't had a chance to attend yet.
college,fekugvb,t1_feks4l7,1579207845.0,"That's fair. At this point, I have no choice but to drop the class. I'm one credit short and am unable to be full time because I can live off campus. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I cannot afford the extra class. So, at this point, the only thing I can do to graduate on time is drop the class and take a cheaper one elsewhere. Otherwise I won't graduate on time even if I stayed in the course. I'll probably still attempt to persuade financial aid, but I'm fully expecting to not receive the full refund and be out 500 dollars."
college,fekomli,t3_epl7cy,1579204399.0,"Jacksonian America and Western Civilization. The classes themselves are super interesting and I'm excited. However, the professor is one of the most difficult professors on campus. He's one of the ones where you can listen to the lecture, take notes, study the PowerPoints, and do all of the reading and still do bad on tests because they cover things that were never mentioned in lecture or the books. He also picks the most random facts and trivia to test over and it's so frustrating."
college,fekmiyw,t1_fekelx9,1579203146.0,It's actually a Bible class my school's biblical studies department offers. I think it has something to do with understand why God puts us through hard times and how to keep our faith in the face of these struggles. I'm not too sure though. I was forced to register last minute and haven't attended a single class ðŸ™„
college,fek9q7w,t1_fek8jhq,1579195540.0,"Yeah, I wish he had set office hours, but he's one of those professors that is more likely to take you out for lunch rather than set up a formal meeting. It's great, but makes things a bit difficult when I need something small like this and can't find him anywhere. I appreciate the help with the email! Thanks!"
college,fek8b0w,t1_fek7mpc,1579194700.0,"The syllabus states that he does not have office hours and that we can show up whenever. I have showed up several times in the last couple of days and he hasn't been there. I guess I could address him as ""professor""(no PhD). It just feels weird because everyone refers to him by his first name."
college,fe9a6rh,t1_fe8vgdv,1578935768.0,"I plan on going to the registrar today once they open after lunch. I barely found out all of this on Friday afternoon and today is the last day to drop a class at my university without a W. Luckily I'm already enrolled at the CC for a class. I just need approval before I go ahead and pay for the class. 
I should probably start applying to jobs now given the situation. I was going to wait a bit, but it might be better to have something lined up prior to graduation just in case they're willing to work with me."
college,fe97819,t1_fe8te8o,1578935020.0,"Unfortunately my school doesn't accept CLEP for most things. The only one I could test out of would be Western Civilization, but they won't let me do that because it's in my major. They don't make things easy. My parents are not willing to pay for the class despite knowing that I cannot afford it. They think it's my fault that I'm short an hour, which is might be and expect me to pay for that mistake. However, it's literally a single credit and no one caught on until my final semester and even the registrar doesn't quite understand how it happened. 
Thanks for the reassurance. Ideally I'd be able to take a crappy job if nothing and pay it off fairly fast."
college,fdp6chb,t1_fdp3t0i,1578621038.0,"Unfortunately I do not qualify for assistance in my state. I've looked into it, and apparently most social services have yet to be expanded to include college students. 

I attend a small Christian university in the Midwest where most students come from upper middle class families. Most poor students don't last long here. My friends back home go to large schools with food pantries and housing accommodations for low income students. At my school, you're forced to get a meal plan the cheapest one you can get is nearly 2000 dollars for 75 meals a semester. The dining hall closes for every holiday as do all of the on-campus restaurants. They charge students 25 dollars a day if they can't afford to go home for the holidays, and do not provide food. Most events cost money or are Greek associated. If you're already struggling to pay for books and food, how can you afford join a frat or drop $30 to go to a concert? It creates such a disconnect amongst students when you have an entire group of people that can't get involved with the community because everything costs money. And of course, the only on-campus jobs available to poorer students are shitty minimum wage jobs in the dining hall or at maintenance. The nicer office jobs tend to go to students that are in some way personally connected to administration. It's humiliating when you have to clean up after students and staff or serve them their lunch, only to see them in class later. You aren't treated the same."
college,fdp46d0,t1_fdp3tp2,1578619584.0,"I wasn't expecting much from financial aid, but I was at least hoping that she would have some sort of advice or resources to give me. I'm currently on a payment plan, but it isn't going to make much of a difference unless I can find another job that pays enough. 

I'm more upset about how awful she was to be honest."
college,fde7avo,t3_ekwk7a,1578332751.0,"Ugh, I hate this so much. I've had to do it for almost all of the classes I have taken in college and it never gets any easier. Name, classification, and major are pretty simple questions to answer. But when they ask me to tell a random fact about myself or tell the class something that no one knows about me, it's like my brain stops working and I always humiliate myself."
college,fcvzbuf,t1_fcvxj8y,1578013542.0,"Yeah, it's a pretty small Christian school. The donors haven't been too happy with administration in the last couple years, so they're struggling financially and therefore trying to get as much money out of us in any way they can."
college,fcvrtr9,t3_ej3dps,1578008667.0,"My school requires it if you live on campus. So, basically everyone has to get one since we're required to live on campus all 4 years. The only way to get around it is to either claim that your vegan or to drop down to part time so that you can move off campus, but they're starting to make that difficult as well."
SampleSize,fajjbef,t1_fajj77o,1576140621.0,"Yes, sorry! Thankfully I got all the responses I needed!"
