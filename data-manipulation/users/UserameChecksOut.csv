india,ffj3bz8,t1_ffj2csx,1579989331.0,"Do you know Begusarai is called ""the little Moscow""? CPI has a stronghold there. Giriraj Singh wasn't even willing to content election from that seat knowing Kanhaiya and CPI but BJP forced him to contest election from that seat only because they knew the ground figures. 

In 2014, a nameless candidate from CPI got  1.92 lakh votes. 

BJP in 2014 got 4.28 lakh votes and in 2019, they got 6.92 lakh votes. 

What did Kanhaiya get with so much celebrity campaigning and social media stardom? Almost as much as anyone would have gotten.  

&#x200B;

You're trying to understand Indian politics from social media posts and youtube channels. That's how we lost in 2019 and we'll lose again in 2024."

What a change in career. How was he even eligible to apply for M.A./Phd in History after doing CS?"
india,ffj1vjo,t1_ffibwnd,1579988298.0,"You're delusional.

Do you think a specific forum/channel filled with like-minded people with similar opinion represent India? They don't. Posts on r/india don't accurately represent the opinions of a common voter. This is the biggest problem with social media. It creates a comfortable bubble around you to sit in and relax.

Take a look at r/chodi r/bakchodi you'll see a whole different side of reddit. Same if true for youtube, Facebook, twitter.

I wasn't surprised when BJP returned with a historical mandate in 2019 because I knew they were coming again, because I talk with real people on the street. You're totally wrong about what a common Indian thinks and that everyone is IT cell troll and paid-media. 95% non-hindus (maybe more) are in support of NRC-CAA. That's just fact."
india,ffj0y7f,t3_etsjcn,1579987627.0,"You've no idea. People who are opposing CAA-NRC are not even 1 percent of those supporting it (excluding Muslims because they'll of course protest against it - and BJP doesn't care a bit about Muslim opinions). 

I have yet to meet a non-muslim in my real life who thinks NRC-CAA is wrong. India is broken beyond repair."
india,ffizp5j,t1_ffiju35,1579986717.0,"More than half of the crowd looks Muslims. Rest are 'woke youth' that have been anti-Modi since the very beginning. You're over-rating Kanhaiya Kumar. He won't win elections. If Giriraj Singh can beat him in Beguisarai with 4 lakh votes, anyone can beat him ANYWHERE.

You people don't understand, social media is not India."
todayilearned,ffhii8n,t3_etim6j,1579936775.0,"Yeah, but that's his version of the story. The people who survived the Holocaust aren't mostly the best ones, good people die first in such systems. Those who survive are often the ones who are in good books of killers."
india,fffw6qz,t1_ffffrqe,1579893135.0,"China is doing very similar to what Shah Muhammad Reza did in 1950-70s in Iran - good economic growth at the cost of personal freedom because he believed that he had a vision and people's freedom was getting in its way.  So he crushed every voice of dissent that went against his dream to make Iran a global power. Chinese regime thinks similarly but this time, China has greater control over it's population than what the Shah had at his time. Islamic revolution removed Shah but you can't say the same about China. I have yet to see a popular uprising or mass protest in mainland China. It appears that everyone's busy counting money."
india,fff060h,t1_ffeyjxg,1579871974.0,"Blame Kejriwal and Chutiya Anna Maadarchod for all those exxagerations and pushing young people towards a so-called revolution when it wasn't necessary at all. They broke Congress beyond repair. Change of regime is good, but atleast we could have a powerful opposition. BJP making government in coalition would have been much weaker. 

Everytime I see that Anna on tv, I want to punch his face so bad."
india,ffezwea,t3_et85tc,1579871733.0,"India had (still have) a GOLDEN chance to be the next superpower after China. Everything was going according to plan - young population, huge workforce, China-US trade wars, increasing labour charges in China, businesses getting hostile of authoritarian China. All India had to do was provide a stable environment for business to grow. Provide infrastructure to businesses and freedom to work. 

Still, India screwed up. In a decade or so, indians will be going to Bangladesh to seek jobs unless we get our shit together."
AskReddit,ffcgw15,t1_ffc76ie,1579799196.0,"Yeah. Great. It has worked for me. I've made around $20k from YouTube this year. Not a lot but ok. More importantly, my time on YouTube has helped me learn skills that can be sold online as a freelancer. I'm saving as much as I can. Trying to build up atleast 10 years worth of emergency fund. My parents have a small house in my hometown, so that's my last refuse if things go terribly wrong.

Problem is that I don't wanna get married and have kids exactly because of this reason.

Another thing is that I've been trying to live a minimal life. Cook my own food, avoiding ordering food as much as I can. I can afford all of this but the problem is that you get used to living a high expenses life and then it's a problem."
AskReddit,ffcg3zo,t1_ffbiyqx,1579798717.0,"SAME!!! I was never poor. I always had enough, my parents always loved me and provided me with everything. I'm financially independent now but still, the feeling that I might get poor someday scares the shit out of me. I can't stand the feeling of not being able to buy something I want. That's why I save a lot and keep my places where I have 100% security even if the return is low. Can't wake up to a morning getting to know that all my money is stolen by some scammer bank or market slowdown or whatever. 

My parents have a home in a small town which I will never sell, to keep it as a last refuge if everything goes wrong. I've enough money to sustain myself for 10-20 years without job. I also fear to get married or have kids because that's added burden. The feeling that someday I might not be able to buy food for my kid terrify me. It's strange."

india,fe2fwje,t3_enktjn,1578837936.0,"The only serious threat to Modi right now is Arvind Kejriwal. I've been following him closely for last 7-8 months and the guy has been going so good, it makes me really happy. He has evolved a lot since 2015, he has shown a non-idealistic approach, he has stopped targeting modi all together, he's understood that he has to first create his own 'Gujarat model' (Delhi model) before he goes on selling this model in other states. He's not getting into super idealistic 'democracy within the party' bullshit, he has understood that HE is the party. As long as he has good intentions, he can be the sole ruler for the AAP and thus prevent any inner-party conflicts. 

He's exactly like how Modi showed he was before 2014 except he is actually delivering. He has understood how to win elections, how to use social media. He didn't go to JMI/JNU for protests, it was a very smart move. He earlier screwed up by questioning Indian Army in Surgical Strike and that hurt him a lot in 2019 LS. He didn't screw up this time. 

He's doing everything right atm, and I'm really hoping to see him come up as a serious opposition in 2024 elections."
