I ran straight to the teacher because that was the policy and if you didn’t the discipline was pretty extreme.

leafs,fff952w,t3_et606a,1579878783.0,"It's simply incredible how off and bad at this in general our fans are. The Leafs don't ""need"" cap space, the cap space was made by getting Ceci and him coming off the books in the off season. The gamble around all of this was how tight the cap would be and counting on an internal solution to backup goaltending, and it didn't pay off. We have three tradable players of real value, Johnson, Kappy, Kerfoot. Everyone else isn't going anywhere unless it's a trade rape or they are a fringe player and simply a small sweetener. Literally no one wants Bracco. Know how I know that? because he's literally traded by every fan trade, you don't want him? they don't want him. Zach Hyman is basically on the no trade list, what he does for guys like Tavares or Matthews is too valuable on this roaster. Anyone who doesnt see this has zero idea how to evaluate lines or a roaster. Another 3/4 D man would be great, but unlikely to happen this year. The only move this team ""needs"" to make before the deadline is something on backup goaltender. Andersen has been fucking terrible for weeks now and needed to be benched a few times this month, but couldn't be because the alternative was even worse. We need someone who can win games and even a playoff series if necessary. The roaster has not performed well enough to be rewarded with a big deadline move on D. Such a move takes Dubas from being completely fine regardless of this season's outcome to being under actual internal scrutiny. He's not risking that for this years middling performance.

I randomly run into a work colleague who was also single at the time. My other friends are all tied down and go home for the night, so me and my colleague keep drinking, we randomly run into this girl who was a roommate of an ex girlfriend of mine in college and her friend. One thing leads to another and we all head back to this girls place. There’s two different bedrooms. I’m messing around with the ex girlfriends old roommates friend even though I’d be getting weird vibes from her, but she was hot and it had been a month for me so I was ignoring my better instincts.  Then my buddy from work comes out knocks on our door and says “ hey I think somethings wrong with so and so she passed out”, I come and look and she’s in rough but okay shape and totally passed out. I laid her on her side in case she got sick (she’s still fully clothed for context here) and put a blanket over her and then was preparing to leave as I’m not ditching my buddy for this girl that’s already half off putting. I let the other girl know me and my friend are probably going to leave and then she’s flips shit and says I shit you not “she’s fine! She wanted it, just go in there and wake her up”. Keep in mind this chick passed out making out with my colleague. Meaning at this juncture she’s obviously out of sorts and obviously in zero ability to consent to anything. After my buddy replies “um no, I’m not a rapist”. She loses her shit full crazy town and starts screaming and runs into the room screaming “wake up! WAKE UP!” At her “friend”. While she’s in the bedroom me and my friend completely disturbed and freaked out, sneak out the kitchen/ back door freaked the fuck out and run down the block. We had taken that girls car to the house from the bar so we needed to go a half mile + back to the bar to get one my car. Then we hear this chick screaming  in the distance “WHERE ARE YOU?!?!” And other insane shit I can’t remember form 15 years ago. We see the lights of the car and engine start like 100m down the road and the screaming continues. We lived in a town with lots of snow and had a good two feet at the time. We dove behind a big pile beside a driveway and watched this psycho bitch drive by window down screaming and literally looking for us. The next day I contacted the ex GFs old Roommate who had passed out, she was okay and hungover, I told her what had happened with her friend as I felt that was some insanely fucked up shit and could have been incredibly bad with the wrong people. She believed the story about her “friend”, apparently she only knew this girl for a short time. Don’t stick your dick in crazy, kids."

news,ff4u8me,t1_ff4qn5v,1579572572.0,Not a DR or a researcher but mushrooms have also shown positives here and have no down side mood side effects in most people aka hangovers. I’ve felt months of positivity about previously negative feelings after very small does of mushrooms. Psilocybin is the active drug. I’m sure there are benefits to MDMA but it’s definitely a depression inducing drug on a come down. Anyone who’s takes it regularly as a party drug knows this and is housing 5-HTP pills prior and other endorphin pre-requisites to help with the come down side effects.

The style and skill set has been monstrously developed, talent levels across all teams are at similar levels or parity including skating. Today’s great players probably share levels of skill with Gretzky certainly there are far better shooters than him. There were players in the 80s who’s skill probably wouldn’t make AHL teams in this modern age. Players don’t regularly drink beer after games anymore and actually have year round medical staff and trainers etc. the NHL in the 80s was like the 50s for the NFL. The NHL today is a truly modern sport in all facets. It’s was notable for example that Gretzky didn’t really party he would go for runs on road trips while the guys fucked around at the hotel."
HumansAreMetal,ff3np9v,t1_fexw0bo,1579544959.0,Anyone thinking you throw fights by having your nose broken by shoulder checks (lol wut) and then allow yourself to kicked that hard in the fucking jaw has never watched many fights. Never grappled ever and most certain has never done any striking at all. Guys throwing fights dance around a few rounds eating punches on the outside and then let a decent hook slide before hitting the ground. They don’t risk literally dying from a headkick.

todayilearned,ff1kel8,t1_ff1gqfm,1579480606.0,It’s irrelevant if you signed something saying the company employing you owns that type of intellectual property. There’s all kinds of weird laws depending on states. In California none competes are illegal others like NY it is legal but nearly unenforceable unless the company can truly prove some type of intellectual property damages. Basically the former CTO working for a direct competitor or something. I’ve worked in tech for ten years anytime I leave I’m always signing none disclosure agreements about why I’m leaving etc which bar’s both the business and myself from saying literally anything negative at all about each other. Many times even if you are fired/ laid off the company will have you sign one to avoid wrongful termination lawsuits and  in return will only divulge you were employed there to x period of time and your title in reference  checks. They do this because many times terminations even in “right to work states” could easily be viewed as unlawful if the former employee has the money and time to fight it in the courts with evidence. I’m in mid-upper management now and I’m constantly dealing with this kind of bullshit through HR etc when hiring. The NDA’s are the only reason I’m okay with it all because that way any employee can at least spin a questionable departure or one that I felt unfair but out of my hands in their favor since I can can provide a glowing review and I know the business is bared from saying anything disparaging.
insanepeoplefacebook,ff1hh6o,t1_ff00src,1579479297.0,"You need a visa to be documented and work and get to get driver’s license or social security number, not citizenship. In fact it takes around 7 years at the fasted to naturalize as a citizen in the US and during that time you get no vote, but you pay all the same taxes and sign up for the draft like everyone else. I was born in Canada and now hold dual citizenship in the US. I’ve lived in the US always legally since 1997. It would be great if the rest of my fellow American citizens could read about our own laws before having opinions on things they don’t understand. 

When I was in 9th grade our US history course took the a sample citizenship test I would eventually have to pass 15 years later to become a citizen.its frankly the most basic thing in the entire world. I didn’t study then or 15 years later. The entire class of Americans failed. I passed, the only Immigrant. This was not a shitty school or area."
