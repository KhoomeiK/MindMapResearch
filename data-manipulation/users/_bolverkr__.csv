Music,ffe5y99,t3_eszbh5,1579837573.0,"Liars funeral by Slipknot. It’s one of those songs that makes you feel like your floating, but this one is negative floaties. The screaming is minimal, but the one word he repeats, “liar”,  just has so much emotion packed into it it’s unimaginable.  The way it sounds forced and through tears at first, but grows stronger just hits in a place I didn’t know I had. Crazy how vocals really do make or break music. Not to mention any names *cough cough* Ozzy osbourne. Piece of shit."

I was implying that the coach was knocked down with great force, as if the referee were playing the game himself. It was then my jest that the coach, seeing and understanding the great velocity of the striped man, would then request to have him play the sport himself, as he is clearly quite good at removing people from the upright position."

He was back inside in a few minutes, and his ears were red as hell. He said he got a pretty good talking to. And where do you think recreational Fentanyl comes from. Pharmacists steal drugs. It’s a fact. They get creative about it. It’s a fact. The government catches them. It’s a fact. If the pharmacists know where the camera is, they avoid it. It’s a fact. You’re on ILPT, and I’m giving ILPT’s from my personal experience. If you want to call bullshit, I recommend not using the word “Totes” again. It (incredibly) makes you look even dumber than you are."

I had a coworker escorted off a job site by two men in suits for pointing the wire out to a pharmacist. You can find footage taken by these same cameras online in videos of people “miscounting” pain prescriptions. Sounds fake, but the reason no one knows is so that this will keep working for them."
IllegalLifeProTips,fdnqd1j,t3_em5jsm,1578590838.0,"Walgreens and other pharmacies will sometimes have small cameras hidden in the ceiling tile and used by the FBI for watching pharmacists steal drugs. Depending on what you are stealing, the DEA and FBI could be watching you. Other than that, just watch for loss prevention. Make eye contact with everyone who looks at you, and if it happens twice with one person, leave. They’re loss prevention. Don’t steal anything that could be used as a street drug, don’t steal anything that could be used to make a street drug. If it’s simple shop lifting, you’ll be fine."
