We have all of this profitable safari companies and private game lodges which do not support hunting in any way and make a lot of cash while uplifting their local communities.

southafrica,ffq915x,t1_ffq7dih,1580126527.0,"Look, you're being reasonable, so I'll give you a better example than Knysna, which I find problematic. Tshukudu Game Lodge is a rehabilitation centre that offers walks with elephants as well as big cat encounters. They do good work. They don't have a dodgy past, and the encounters, in a large part, finance the facility's work. They may battle with the new legislation. Unfortunately, dodgy operators far outnumber the good ones. By limiting human interactions across the board a greater emphasis is placed rehabilitation and release, which is far better in the long run. Unfortunately, the good operators will suffer, but I believe this legislation is better for the animals involved in the long run. Walking with elephants, as an example, is a money making scheme regardless of who runs it. It normalises human interaction which is  not in the best interests of the animals and precludes release. These operations should not be supported, even when their intentions are ultimately good."

The catholic church is also well known for taking advantage of  people in their care, most notably children. And yes, tax religious organisations. They operate for profit and should be treated as such. It's all well and good when we look at what the good book has to say on how they're supposed to operate, but that's not how the vast majority of religious organisations operate. There's a difference between a religious institution that seeks money and power, and the faith that they peddle. I have no problem with the latter."

Anyone may also contribute, however, by the very definition of science, a contribution needs to follow a strict set of guidelines for the findings to be valid and accepted by the scientific community. Little Billy may be passionate about science and knowledge, but if he's building a steam powered rocket to prove that the earth is flat, his hypothesis is flawed and his contributions will not be accepted as valid, unless his findings can be repeated by other scientists. That doesn't stop little Billy from exploring his hypothesis. And should little Billy's passion follow the scientific method, there's a good chance he'll prove his original hypothesis false and eventually move onto real science. If you'd like to compare science to art, I think dance is a good place to start. Anyone can dance, there's no barrier to entry, but if you'd like to do the Tango, you're going to need to learn the steps. Same deal with science. You can't just proclaim you're a scientist. You need to understand the framework first. Science is the method through which we as a species understand our universe, so it needs a few checks and balances to ensure that various findings are valid to the best of our current knowledge that's what makes it different to art. Art, in a way, is the expression of our perception of the world around us. Everyone's personal perception is valid, so every artistic expression is valid in a small way. Not so with everyone's science. If my science is flawed and does not improve our understanding of the world around us, it should not be included in our species' pool of knowledge."
