I try and avoid installing generators because you have to maintain them, refill them, swap out the fuel if you dont use it because it goes stale, etc etc. For a 60 watt site, a $3.5k generator and remote start kit could instead be spent on another 8 days of battery runtime and skip all the maintenance crap that comes with generators."

AskReddit,fcj7yhw,t1_fci1arv,1577679543.0,I dont use those services because i have to cook it myself. Would rather just have it come precooked in a healthy state and i heat it in the microwave. We had a local shop that did it as part of a gym where you could go pick up healthy micowave meals that the gym enthusiasts would eat for themselves so it was good before the guy running it shut down and moved it to another city.  So now i eat takeaways every night.

And the fact that your lungs arent meant to have smoke of any kind in them... doesnt matter it doesnt have nicotine in it or the chemicals that cigerettes have, its still smoke from fire."
galaxynote10,fceoj69,t1_fcejasx,1577622395.0,"Can you please explain further? How can a pixel be a sensor? I was thinking they would use the camera or a light dependent resistor like in the note 8.

Edit: I think you might be right. If i move my finger to pull down the notifications menu anywhere near that pixel, the screen turns off. If i put my finger over the camera or anywhere else near the screen it stays on. I am super keen to find out what component they are using as the flashing pixels now interest me as they must be reflecting into something?"
