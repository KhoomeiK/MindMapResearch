Entrepreneur,fddktdx,t3_ekl4zj,1578316119.0,"Hi! Great site, and the product looks like something I would try - I've got a growing bald spot that I'm thinking of doing something about ;)

Also, congrats on the first sale!

I think this type of product would benefit from social media influencers using the product and demoing it on their blogs and Youtube etc. I have a feeling you'll get the most bang for your buck there."

So far I like the effect that the breathing does for me, I feel motivated, happy, wanting to do things, socialise, work, play..its difficult to easily describe lol! I'm seriously hoping this is not a placebo affect, as it seems right now that I have found what I was looking for!"

getdisciplined,fd7sntq,t1_fd46mxu,1578209482.0,"I've tried a 6 minutes of the technique I found here: https://youtu.be/FRCoURLGy-k . What got me was not breathing after exhaling all the oxygen from your lungs, I think I managed just under a minute - does this get easier over time ? . Overall I definitely felt more awake and alert after."

So if you use a package fulfillment service you may lose on your margin a bit but again it's just temporary."

getdisciplined,fd1cyhx,t3_ejsntn,1578129993.0,Isn't one cup a day a good thing for your health? Read  about that somewhere.
getdisciplined,fd1camy,t3_ejex15,1578129735.0,"I started meditating a good couple of years ago while learning Reiki. Once I got the hang of focuses on the breath and acknowledging thoughts but not getting carried away by them, I noticed I could meditate while not meditating for example while walking or running.

Especially while running, alot of people I know don't meditate in the traditional sense but do long runs which is their way of meditating. I'm sure this could be applied to other areas as well ie cooking , what are your thoughts ?"
southafrica,fd1913a,t3_ejj1vo,1578128773.0,"Here is how to calculate the customs fees:

Clothing Price in R = R655

Fees = Clothing Price X 10% = R65,50

Duties = Clothing Price X 45% = R294,75

VAT = (Clothing Price + Fees + Duties) X 15% =  R152,29

Total what you'll pay to customs = Fees + Duties + VAT =  R512,54"
getdisciplined,fcttba1,t3_eirisj,1577958417.0,"I was in the same space as you and I still enter it from time to time. Procrastination is my weakness. What helped me was using the pomodoro technique - I found if I just entered the flow - the timer switching to on gets me in the zone, I'm more motivated to continue and eventually I end up doing some good work."
