canada,fdolap8,t1_fdoeek9,1578607445.0,Are you seriously wondering? The answer is clear. If the black box vindicated Iran it would've been released moments after the crash. Instead they blamed it on technical malfunction before the plane even hit ground.
worldnews,fdokvuf,t3_embvsd,1578607199.0,Anyone wanna bet Iranian's don't turn out in the millions to fanatically cry and protest their government murdering 83 of their own countrymen like they did for one piece of shit general who got what was coming to him? It's all crocodile tears.
