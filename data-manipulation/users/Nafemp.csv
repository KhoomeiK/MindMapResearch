Yes uninformed and stupid voters exist in abundance among adults but guaranteed 16 yos would only increase that number and there likely would be an even larger percentage of uninformed voters among the 16-17 yo bracket.

> Or people with a private education, because they'd be too impressionable and susceptible to peer pressure.


Mate it’s really no different in public school lmao. This isn’t at all exclusive to private schools impressionability and peer pressure is more exclusive to being 16 and being in any sort of school system, which the vast majority of 16 yo’s are.

*and yes is definitely a reason why 16 year olds shouldn’t vote*

I do not want elections decided by the select few popular groups who follow popular thought in any given high school and have the influence to push their weight around the school.

If 16 year olds were allowed to vote in ‘08 and the god damn Jonas brothers somehow hypothetically ran a lot of them probably would have voted for the Jonas brothers, or heck even if they didn’t they’d probably just do it solely because they played one of their songs in their rally. We both know it.

> A lot of adults are less capable of critical thought than a 16 year old.

Not true.

Lack of pre frontal cortex gives adults in edge here. 16 yo’s are still actively learning critical thinking skills and often struggle due to impulsivity.

> Unless you agreee we can't trust anyone over 75 years of age to vote, because they're mentally declining and unable to grasp the long-term consequences of their decision because they'll be dead.

Yeah sure I can agree that *some 75 year olds* probably don’t have the cognition to vote anymore just like how they don’t have the cognition to do a lot of things(much like how I agree that some 16 year olds probably have the development required to be trusted to vote)

Except the thing is that a lot of them that are too far gone almost certainly already don’t vote and it’s a lot easier to take them in a case by case basis as they’re a far smaller population segment and have already been granted their right to vote over the last 50 some odd years. 

> A lot of 16 year olds probably have a fresher memory of American History class than a 60 year old.

politics,fgi7oip,t1_fgfahz9,1580809914.0,"Driving's quite a bit different and way less complicated than elections with much more direct consequences that a 16 year old could more easily grasp.

It's much easier for an impulsive immature brain(Not that it always does) to grasp the immediate consequence of 'if i drive like a jackass i'll die' than it is for them to understand the more abstract consequences of voting for a terrible candidate for a baseless reason. You're literally talking about elections possibly being decided in the halls of American Highschools here and I'm sure if you really think back you'd be sure to find plenty of rash and dumb popular mindsets that spread solely based upon peer pressure and impressionable youth at your own HS.

It's also just better to have a more educated voter base and by putting the cutoff at 18 there's a higher chance that your voter base is going to be more educated. Most 16 yo's haven't even taken a HS level gov/econ course leaving only the select few with independent interests in politics having any real education on the topic prior to voting."

politics,fgf0s2u,t1_fgdipne,1580718299.0,"Key word little by little.

We already do allow them more responsiblities at 16 and even younger by allowing them to volunteer for preferred candidates and get a feel for the political field without taking the burden of deciding who would be a good candidate to vote for and why without directly impacting the vote themselves.

At 16 many simply lack way too much brain development time biologically speaking to consistently be expected to make mature choices on that magnitude."
politics,fgezuuk,t1_fgeobdg,1580717015.0,"Interested in politics is one thing.
Voting on the other hand takes a degree of maturity that most 16 year olds don’t and can’t possess.

I feel like teens should be encouraged to volunteer much more than they do but I’m not sure how I feel about 16 yo’s voting. They can just as easily if not more easily vote for an idiot for some shallow Short sighted reason."
politics,fgezsdu,t1_fgengkz,1580716921.0,"That’s anecdotal though, for every one of you and your friends at 16 you’ll have another 16 yo who will vote for a candidate just because he said something funny on tv or some other equally as stupid reason why someone in their teens does stuff.

16 year olds are still on average way too impressionable, ill informed, and immature thanks to still developing prefrontal cortexes to make decisions that impact a nuclear superpower. 

You can’t earnestly tell me that no one you knew made a seriously stupid decision at 16 that they ended up regretting. Now apply that to voting which can’t exactly be taken back and which the consequences of are much larger."

Regardless of religious views a lot of smaller local churches are actually pretty good and useful tools for the community.

EDIT: also fair to mention that anything of decent quality you give has a high likelihood of going to thrifters over people who actually need it. Also a fair chance that some of those thrifters are likely resellers. This is all possible because goodwill has zero vetting for who gets to benefit off the donations. A lot of churches or other charitable groups who give it away do."

there's 2 factors working in your favor.

2.

Not even top 100 players agree with you on that btw, players like T90 for instance have gone on record talking about how to come back from a bad dark age start which generally consists of being aggressive in feudal, causing idle time, killing vils, etc. to make up the difference.
