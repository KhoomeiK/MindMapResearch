The difference comes from when you look at what they do and where they're donating.

What does a person testifying gain by donating? Seems like it would be the other way around (donating to a testifier) if you wanted to influence them. This case is Trump's defense donating to the people who decide his guilt. 

Second, where are the donations going to? Is it some dude who donated a 20 to Sanders for the campaign in 2016? Again, this case is Trump's defense donating to the people at the impeachment trial.

And then, look at the timing. One of these guys donated the maximum amount allowed right after impeachment began.

Again, it's hard to find people who haven't donated money to someone when you're trying to gather people who have the most intimate view of the presidency and the government.

Well, to play a big devil's advocate, you probably went to a western film school. Anime is often dependent on tropes (usually bad) but it's unique in the sense that they can rely on that to subvert those traditional tropes and plots. Or explore them to a logical extreme. A popular anime right now that exemplifies that is One Punch Man. The whole trope of 'hero always wins through punching better than the other guy' is taken to its limit with a character that's pretty explained by the title. He ends up being, mentally, a pretty normal guy who's kind of bored of not ever having anything exciting to do because he always wins. He's not one of the characters who always yells about justice and heroism, but he's still *good* which gives some really nice emotional moments about halfway into the first season.

Hunter x Hunter is a fan favorite for a series that looks and feels pretty normal and tropey in the first few episodes before it takes extremely dark and philosophical turns. 

Western media has tropes too, obviously, and they still play on them a lot, but anime is reliant on them to a greater extent a lot of the time and the medium is often more focused on that subversion/exploration than other mediums are, so it ends up having unique storytelling in that area you don't often see elsewhere.

TL:DR anime as a medium has issues following tropes but it has the potential to turn out much more thoughtful pieces of work that plays on tropes by exploring or subverting them."
