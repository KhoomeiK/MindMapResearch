This song is a bop"
singapore,ffe2ac2,t1_ffdqu7x,1579834835.0,"The fitting course is for health personnel in Hospitals/healthcare where they can be the person who trains more ppl for such fitting in their relevant departments in the hospitals.

I’ll be doing the fit testing next week and it’s paid for by the govt as well."
kpop,ffcbtc0,t1_ffcaz9s,1579796057.0,"There’s artists who’ve debuted way longer and still wouldn’t be able to get the chances they have been given. This doesn’t just apply to KPOP but everywhere. There’s no definite time when one should hit it big, otherwise how will the big names really stay as ‘prestigious’ as they are?

And let’s remember that racism plays a **huge** part in this. It’s not just some part, but you know if they’re all Americans they would get so much more."
singapore,ffbzw59,t1_ffbz2if,1579787914.0,"Yes it is the right thing. SARS did kill too many people back then.

I just pity the people who are currently not infected but basically unfortunate to live there and be deemed as 'dangerous' to public and therefore locked in...increasing their chances of contracting the virus from now on. But no chance to escape :\\"
singapore,ffbyflg,t1_ffbxatv,1579786743.0,"Yup, and it’s cruel that the whole city is being locked down with no way of getting out... I know it’s for the world’s sake as a better good but still, it’s like being told “Whatever disease the city has, y’all stay in here and don’t spread to others” kinda isolation.

And CNY is coming too, makes me empathise with the 10million + Wuhan citizens because they have close to 600 who are contracted with the virus."
singapore,ffby5k2,t1_ffbxkf7,1579786506.0,"Working in healthcare here and we have a training course that’s specifically for fitting the N95 masks but from what I know now, only the frontliners aka Nurses/Doctors/PSAs/people who go to wards for work will have to take.

I don’t think this course is really available to public. But anyway, contact precaution is the most important step and staying at home if you have a weaker immune system. Practice good hygiene too."
aww,ff9nsrr,t1_ff9a68d,1579716871.0,"Amidst all these praise for the boy, I was looking for this confirmation. Glad that I found your comment.

Thank you. I’m also hopeful that the dog will be well taken care of by the people in the neighbourhood."
iPhone11,ff9bvpi,t3_escxwv,1579709431.0,"That’s definitely too much sun for me but lovely picture! 

Almost thought I was reading a post from r/painting"
SkincareAddiction,ff9apqv,t3_es6wt4,1579708685.0,"SUMIKKO GURASHI!

AHHH. Pardon me as I’m a huge fan of this cartoon character series.

Thank you for sharing your chosen ones. I’m thinking of trying with what I have (Inkey List BHA, Innisfree volcano pore mask but I’m lacking a cleansing oil.)"
singapore,ff99s60,t3_esbbcu,1579708101.0,"Oh dear, must have been terrifying to be alone and puking all over yourself. Glad that you felt better after the vomiting.

Have to be careful of what you eat. Take care!

Don’t really know what to say about the kindness as I know I’ll also pass my packet of wet tissues to a sick stranger without a doubt. And I’ve always felt that there’s so many kind people in SG too."
kpop,ff996w1,t1_ff994ch,1579707731.0,"Oh really? When? 

Might have missed those."
kpop,ff990p3,t1_ff95nht,1579707622.0,"Cool, but I really think that they would have put BTS RM if it’s just him.

And if I’m Grammys, I would invite the whole group onstage rather than a single member. But we’re not even sure if their appearance is confirmed at this point so I’m still waiting for the actual confirmation."
