MadeMeSmile,ffjtcad,t1_ffia45c,1580006392.0,"I both agree and disagree with you on this one. more and more people are understanding what birds really need, which is much more then seed, water, and a little cage. My cockatiel mallow has a mansion of a cage, still gets out of his cage to play 3-6 hours a day, gets all the fruit veggies and pellets he needs and has a great life. And i’m happy to say that this is becoming the normal for bird owners. having a pet bird is one of the most amazing and rewarding things, they’re more like a child then a pet in terms of their needs (especially larger parrots) but if you treat them the way they’re meant to be treated and give them lots of love and attention, they thrive!!!"
