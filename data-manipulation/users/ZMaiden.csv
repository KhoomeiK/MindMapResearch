aww,ffe8j4b,t1_ffe79mc,1579839615.0,"We’re further along the evolutionary train imo, but we are not unique in a lot of ways we think we are. As far as caretakers or protectors, we evolved enough to understand consequences on a large scale and even then we can’t get humans not killing a species into extinction for backwoods medicine, can’t get humans to curb their selfishness to save the environment even if it means a hundred years from now humans wouldn’t be blue to survive. My male cat is sure a protector of my sisters female kitten, he loves her and takes care of her,  does he understand that the consequences of fleas are bad for her health? No. So when we comb her and bathe her she gets really upset and he gets growls and really upset with us.  He understands caretaker. He doesn’t understand present pain for future healthfulness. So are we just going to be ok with literally being the same as my domestic cat thought wise? Either we’re better than them or we’re just selfish and short sighted."
islam,ffe7f9l,t1_ffcvgcf,1579838718.0,"As long as you don’t ignore your friends presence, if he’s shy, he might prefer not being put on the spot so to say. Sometimes it’s nice , as a socially anxious person, to just sit and let other people talk. There’s no pressure on you to voice an opinion, if you think of something you can put it out there without pressure to maintain a narrative, everyone else will do it for you so u feel included but don’t feel the pressure of guiding a convo. As long as u don’t feel shut out, it feels nice to let everyone talk and not pressure u to talk as well, unless you want to and then ideally everyone would stop to listen, acknowledge what u said but then move the attention away from you."
islam,ffe6w4h,t3_esxcgb,1579838297.0,"Lol as a person with severe social anxiety... let the two people talk, just throw me a head nod or an eye contact every now and then, but pls don’t ask me to talk in a three person convo, I’d feel more awkward. Don’t ignore I’m there but good god don’t ask me to engage, now there’d be *two* people I’d have to (in my mind) entertain. So Much Pressure. Do much better in groups of four or more, less time I have to over obsess about what I’m going to say lol."

AskReddit,ffe5h86,t1_ffdbpch,1579837212.0,"It’s interesting to me that your parents said the 90s were that scary. My family lived for a year in Ukraine round about 96 I think.  Dad was starting a church there. I was the oldest at 13, still pretty young though. I used to walk down a block or two to go get in the bread line. I knew enough to say “ one please” or “two please” and then walk back home. I was only ever afraid in that anxiety of not knowing the language way. I heard sometimes the adults talking about the Russian mafia snatching up a kid, but I was just told not to go with strangers and not to answer the door if the answer to my ( forgive my butchering) “ sto eta?” Wasn’t “eta mama”. Lol. Mostly I remember lots of homeless people passed out on the street ( once even outside our apartment door), kids playing in snow covered trash heaps like they were mountains, old ladies accosting my mother on the street to lecture her if they thought me and my siblings weren’t covered up enough for the cold lol. Trying to communicate for my mother with the little Ukrainian/ French I knew and the little English/French they knew. I still remember the smell of the meat markets, the dogs running around snatching up fallen bits. I still dream about those fucking giant steps and all the statues my mother had us crawl over for pics. I’ll never forget getting to see a ballet in the opera house, even though it was under construction. I never really felt in danger at any point. I played basketball with some burly Ukrainian teens and told them not to go easy on 13 year old me and got an elbow to the nose, no regrets. I had a little boy climb a tree outside my apartment window and cry out “America I love you, America marry me.” I hated it while I was there but god, I had some good times. 

Edit: one weird time though, my dad had to go out and “buy” used hypodermic needles from some of the kids my age with candy, they fished them out of the snow covered trash heap in our courtyard and were playing with them."
Pets,ffb9s9c,t3_esnxa0,1579756523.0," I'm so so sorry for your loss. But that is just the most beautiful way for a pet to go. He knew he was going to go and he just wanted to be with his humans before he went. I know it seems sudden, and it seems like that's the worst, that you didn't (and he didn't) have a chance to fight. But trust me, sudden and peaceful is infinitely better than other options. I had two cats literally die in my arms, one to painful fluke of a disease, and the other to a grand mal seizure. I drank myself into a stupor for weeks to try and forget what I saw. My babies never got to say goodbye to me, count yourself lucky.

edit: and it seems like you got a nice elder cat, I legit secret service protected my current boy to his 5th birthday because I've never had a cat last that long. First girl died before her 2nd bday and second girl died after her 4th. My current boy went missing for a month and I thought my curse was in full swing, but we found him and now he's being an overbearing older brother to my sister's cat.

edit2: I had to think of it like this. You might get multiple cats, and love them, and they might die. But, you live so long compared to them, you were built to give love and home to so many cats. And there are so many cats out there who need love and home! We can handle grief, and they live shorter lives than us. Therefore, we are built to give as many of them as possible homes and love. It's hard on us, but we can handle it. There is right now or shortly thereafter, a cat that needs you, and you'll find him\her when you're ready, but when you're ready the right cat will find you and it'll need you, you are made to make a home for them."
islam,ffb5wls,t1_ff2tad6,1579752640.0,"I have loved all the comments in this thread. But I just don’t think Islam is for me. It’s a beautiful religion, it really is. And I live a lot of the same ideals, I refuse to have sex before marriage( even though I’m pretty ashamed at being a virgin at my age), I absolutely hate showing too much skin ( my sister loves to rub me that my fav style is long T-shirt over shorts with crazy leggings underneath) But I’m a functioning alcoholic ( lord knows it took a long time for me to acknowledge that as a fact) and I do the occasional recreational drug ( my only drug of choice is adderall because I’m older than most of the people I party with and an energy drink just doesn’t cut it when you’re trying to dance and stay awake for 16 hours and then just sleep for 3 or 4 hours before u do it again) I don’t think I could let go of my precious alcohol. It’s the only thing that keeps me from spiraling into deep depression. I’ve tried to quit before but I just went multiple days without sleeping ( because my mind wouldn’t shut up). I don’t think u can be a Muslim and also be an alcoholic."
WTF,ffb4e4x,t1_ffb0bem,1579751491.0,"believe me I know. I have vague memories of reaching a dead end paved resort road and not knowing if I shoulds just cut across (which would have likely taken me into who knows where off the resort) or backtrack. There was a weird table right there at that dead end, white cloth, full of stacked water bottles. It was so odd to me, it struck me out of my daze, and made me think for a minute, I truly looked out and saw cars passing behind the tree line that I was just about ready previously to pass."
WTF,ffayp7v,t1_ffa922f,1579747565.0,I went on a resort trip to Mexico one year. Wasn’t used to having unlimited access to free alcohol and got so drunk I pissed myself because I got lost and couldn’t find my way back to my room in time. Was so drunk I was more focused on walking normally and trying to remember landmarks that I didn’t even realize I needed to pee till it was too late. Def not a normal occurrence for me lol. The resort wasn’t even a thirty min walk in any direction and I got lost as fuck lol.
WTF,ffay4xv,t1_ff9qoe4,1579747196.0,Lived in a college town for a few years. The amount of times people “fell asleep” in front of me at a fast food drive thru would shock you. Like full on passed out behind the wheel for a good ten to fifteen minutes before someone was brave enough to go check on them.
aww,fewyg1f,t1_fewik7q,1579421411.0," Day ten, nothing to report, systems still critical. Made landfall successfully, attempted to reboot food processors, attempt failed. Subsisting on emergency rations, rations are low. Investigation of local resources recommended.

 Day eleven, scouted out locations of local resources, native population is not hostile on a glance, yet seems to turn hysterical once presence is noticed. Recommend stealth at all costs. Rations are critical.

  Day twelve. Reconnaissance teams have reported back local resources as edible to us. ""Massive resources"". No food scout has returned after report, security levels to be elevated.

 Day thirteen, all command staff has vanished, suspect locals are hostile. Captain has elected to inspect the area, expects to report back and return samples.

Pets,fej1u9w,t1_feiy3dp,1579153837.0,"he was in some pain, but his pain didn't overpower his joy for attention. It was when we could tell he was getting no joy from anything (food, treats, petting)  and was only in pain that we knew his time had come.

edit: at one point before he lost all mobility in his back legs, he'd still try and and run up to you, tail wagging for pets. when he lost mobility in his back legs, he'd still drum the floor with his tail, wanting pets. it was when he just melted into the floor and wouldn't even lift his head, when previously he would at least see you and try to muster up a tail wag, if he couldn't even wag his tail or lift his head we knew the pain was too much."
Pets,feiwiyb,t1_feivfvi,1579149144.0,"I think not necessarily, lots of terminally ill people have pain but they still want to live. That’s the hard part with pets who can’t tell you when enough is enough. My family had a lab who got to the end of his life, we were literally having to pick him up and drag him inside after he would collapse after doing his business outside. He wanted to live, u could tell because he would still get excited when I would rub his belly.  He couldn’t stand on his own at one point but he still found joy in being petted. It was when he couldn’t even find joy in attention that we knew it was time. He was glassy eyed, not even acknowledging treats or pets and that’s how we knew. Don’t put an animal down, pain or otherwise, if they’re still trying to find love and life. They’re holding on for a reason. Once they have no joy in life then u know it’s time."
videos,fe6kagy,t3_env0eb,1578893684.0," Why am I ugly crying right now! lol. Christmas has always been a super important holiday for our family, because it is my mom's fav holiday. This year has been so hard for her, my parents lost their home, and then lost everything in their storage unit including all our old xmas ornaments, baby books, her mom's wedding dress, and all her santa collection. It was hard for her. But my siblings and I got together and said, we're having xmas dinner, let us handle the food. So we bought all the food and gave it to her to make (cause no way was she going to take ""charity"" so her making the food meant it wasn't charity) and we had one of the best holiday meals ever."
relationship_advice,fe6h6s5,t1_fe3guoj,1578890785.0," You did write it poorly. It comes across as blaming and shaming the OP, who may have responded poorly but by no means was he abandoning his sibling. OP may be the only stable influence in his siblings life, but he is not the parent, and he is not obligated to be a parent. He is also young, and in a hard situation, and there is no cause nor is there any benefit to blame him for his reaction. He's here to ask for advice, what you posted is not helpful, it is only hurtful. This kid is going down a bad path, in those cases you don't just ""love and support unconditionally"" that's how you get a drug addicted drop out problem. If harsh words are enough to affect him now, then maybe he can have a self reflective moment and make a turn around."
relationship_advice,fe6f8sd,t1_fe67xw8,1578889132.0," yeah, with her ""couple girlfriends"" line I'm willing to bet she's just not ready to approve of any girlfriend. Cat, you need to take it as she's not ready to let go and it probably has nothing to do with you as a person. You could be a perfect little stepford gf and at this point you still wouldn't be ""good enough"". Just be you, don't stress about trying to impress her, if she makes little comments just say ""well, good thing I'm dating ""boyfriend's name"" and not you."""
news,fe6ddf0,t1_fe4eitp,1578887620.0,"I didn’t vote for trump but it was a close call for me and here’s why. I didn’t want to vote for Hilary because I was just a little tired of what I felt was a dynasty of bush and Clinton, I just wanted something new and not a return to old classics. Also I thought what’s the harm in trying something radical it’s not like he can do much damage in just one term ( what I thought at the time because I thought he was at least mentally stable). I thought, let’s give a fresh, non politician a chance and see what happens. In hind sight I’m glad I didn’t follow through on that, because good god he showed himself to be so so unstable. I thought any change was better than more stagnation, but god, 4 or even 8 years of status quo with Hilary would have been infinitely better than this shit show. Positive outcome for me though, it made me really firm in my support for a true change in the future as opposed to believing in baby steps to change things."

news,fdj85v9,t1_fdj5jpx,1578461195.0,"actually no, I regret to this day leaving a company I cared about and where I felt the owner cared about me. I gave 7 years of my life and only got a 50 cent raise in that time. I would have stayed for the rest of my life, but I just couldn't afford my living costs. I'm saying it's tragic that a lesser chain who cares infinently more about food quality and employee happiness loses employees because by their very caring, they can't afford to pay their employees what they're worth, while a bigger chain scrimps and ignores food safety to get more money for themselves and can then pay just a little bit more.

edit: previous company, we followed expiration times religiously, which meant we were very strict about our ordering but sometimes ran out of ingredients. current job, food expires in four hours, so every four hours we...change the times on our containers so we don't ever throw anything out."
news,fdj4ird,t1_fdiguyi,1578458235.0,"I didn’t get shit. U could say, but you work in the fast food industry, that’s to be expected. Previous to this job, I worked at a pizza chain for 7 years. Every year at Christmas, my boss the store owner would give everyone a 20 dollar gift card to somewhere and a company shirt or hoodie. I understood he got those gift cards by trading gift cards for our store, but it felt really nice... just a little thing to show he really loved his employees. Working for an even bigger food chain now, nothing. Oh wait... we got a party where everyone had to sign up to bring our own food. I would still praise that last job to the high heavens, how we cared about the quality we put out how we cared about the fucking company culture because they seemed to care for us. I only left because he couldn’t pay me more than 9 an hour after 7 years, but at least I felt like he gave a shit about us. His own wife would cook food for us if we had to work on the holidays. This new job, I get paid more but you don’t even get a break unless you’re a minor no matter how long u work. And the boss and managers are so super focused on good reviews because that’s how they get their bonuses, they will give away free food just for good reviews so they can get a bigger bonus. I went from a company I truly believed in that just couldn’t pay me, to a company I hate ( and hate all the health code violations they do just to get food out super fast for good reviews)"

funny,fdd5y7u,t1_fdd0wb7,1578296242.0,"all of that is objective to what is happening right now in a ""young"" persons life. 22 or younger during ww2? there were kids who trusted their own self evaluation to die for a cause. At that point, the only difference between an 18 year old who is willing to die for a cause and a 35 year old is just cynicism and fear of death."
