And sure, you can come up with a scheme like you mentioned, where some people would get more of map A and some more of map B, you could also suspect that map B drops more after midnight but before noon, or that it depends on the current daily highscore time in the labyrinth.

The fact that sound processing is a performance hit is because the game (i.e. the software running locally on your machine) has to process hundreds of different sounds at the same time. That has nothing to do with server communication. The server doesn't tell your client ""what sound file to play"". The server only has to tell your client that mobs are dead now. And it *has* to do that, there's nothing to optimize there.

About applying currency to items that the currency can't be applied to: yes, they could change that so it gets denied before the request ever gets send to the server.
