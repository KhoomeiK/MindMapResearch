ShaneDawson,ffyjobv,t3_evqm9d,1580348030.0,I used to love watching that channel like when they first started a while ago.  I haven’t watched them in a long time. Their content got boring to me really fast and I feel like their reactions don’t really add much commentary to the video most of the time imo

facepalm,ffubdzc,t3_ev5uzj,1580238422.0,I've had people spell my name wrong in a email even though it's spelled perfectly in the email I sent them. I don't even have a difficult name to spell yet everyone always spells it wrong. I've never made a big deal about it though. It's really not that serious.
kurtisconner,fftnjsd,t3_ev0ffr,1580225025.0,I will move to San Francisco just for you. Just give me a few hours.

Tinder,fftmua9,t3_ev0jwk,1580224548.0,He clearly doesn't have a sense of humor. You don't want to be with him anyway. He sounds boring. His loss.
