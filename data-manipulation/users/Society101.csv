She is no longer on the show. Same with the rest of them when the showing hadn't returned yet. Angelina knows what to do.
jerseyshore,fgzcus1,t1_fgulf37,1581192980.0,"I agree. I mean it's easier said than done when you are accustomed to bringing in that kind of money, but still...
I think Deena the only smart one. She continues to live a normal life. That way when the lights go out and all the cameras are gone, she won't need to keep up appearances or sell her soul to keep up celebrity living."
jerseyshore,fgy54py,t3_f0lh0m,1581179536.0,"Why isn't Jenny or Angelina in the promo? They were key players in the note. lol
Edit: okay, so this is old. A part of me feels sad for Ron. We always talking about the exploitation affecting Sammy, but I think the same can be said for Ronnie. I think some of this has contributed to his downward spiral."
jerseyshore,fgy45u9,t3_f0lh0m,1581179322.0,"I am sorry, but *I laughed. 1) because ""multiple people in the household..."" gets me every time and 2) because this proves just how much Family Reunion is lacking. The show is still capitalizing off off of Ronnie and Sammy drama from 10 years ago to keep interest. That is sad. Although, the note is classic. Just can't deny.
So glad Sammy decided to move on anyhow.  Family Vacation may constantly relive the past (to some of us fan's delight), but she was able to break away from that aspect of her life. *No cast members were harmed in the making of this promo."
lostgirl,fgkmgpk,t1_f7vbgdc,1580868938.0,"To me Rainer was like several of the overarching bads. He was larger than life until, like everyone else, he lost his fizzle once he came into contact with Bo. One thing I loved about the Aife character is that she was probably Bo's only opponent that was actually stronger than Bo in the end. Both Dyson and  Trick (needlessly) had to sacrifice themselves  to defeat Aife or else Bo woud have died. I liked that. Showed Bo wasn't an all encompassing life force. But the show learned their lesson with Aife. They made sure no other overarching bads would make Bo look weak in any real way. So by the time Rainer came a long, it only made sense that they built this wanderer up as some great mysterious terror only to turn around and be rendered completely useless at the sight of Bo. Crazy. lol"
lostgirl,fgkkre8,t3_dxqb4p,1580867847.0,"Wow! Good stuff but I see it differently.

Bo was such a beautiful protagonist in the beginning seasons. It was rare to see a heroine who genuinely cared about and focused on helping others over her own agenda. So I was all for her. I liked her with Dyson best. Their chemistry was phenomenal. Their story made sense. I felt she was forced with Lauren from day 1. Such a long term lacking relationship those two had.  I am surprised to read here that they ended up together in the end, corny.

However, Lauren was my favorite character by far. She was one of two consistent human storylines. She dusted Kenzi as far as her ability to help out, save the day, get ish done and even pave her own way. She was the true star amongst the crew. She was brilliant, caring and devoted.

Don't get me wrong. In the end...well season 4 where I stopped...I came to love Kenzi more than Bo, but she basically lived her whole life in emotional servitude to Bo which was not cool to me. The few things she had to herself were always taken away prematurely - yes her possible engagement to Hale being one of them. It just became too much for me to not accept that Kenzi was a bonified fancy-styled sycophant. The character was destined to be more than that, but the show limited her in that way.

Dyson started out interesting. Sexy. Purposeful. Then he fizzled out into some Bo love - sidelined. It seems the show really did not know what to do with his character after about early season 3. Taking his love was the end. I knew it. Reminded me of Angel and Buffy. Once you take it that far with the love interest, it's too difficult to get the audience back behind that union. 

I really liked Tamsin. She had so much beauty and built in folklore as a Valkyrie. Also her story was intriguing. She wanted so much to be one of the good guys. I wish we could have seen that story developed more. I find it sad when a show is so afraid to let it's main characters grow in fear that they will outshine the protagonist. This is unfortunately the downside of BIG BAD of the Week style fantasy. All attention on main girl. Everyone else becomes weak and secondary bylines with each passing season.

That brings me to Trick. Trick was the only character immune to the magicalness that was Bo. He was inherently more powerful than her from the start. He rarely got directly involved in the big bad, so there was no need to reduce him in efforts to keep Bo on top. But then, they tied him into her by making him her grandfather. And then it started for him. Everything was about Bo. He made terrible risks for Bo. He could do nothing because of Bo. Boring.

Hale has to be in my top three. Wasted potential all around. So much I can say about his character, but not without controversy. He was sexy and smart. He and Kenzi were a natural match. He was heir of clan Zemora. He was a male siren (which could have been used in a very creative way). He also has a solid human world job. But why was he first to go? All that cushion and they couldnt find a decent storyline for him except sacrificing himself to Kenzi. 

I like that Vex indirectly joined the crew but remained as complex as possible. Keeping he and Evony around was one of the better decision the show made. Less everyone would have been eaten up by Bo's start power. Glad these two did not.

With that said it really was a good show which proves that despite it all, the characters were brilliant especially Bo. Just pointing out the shortcomings that made the show a bit disappointing toward the end. But still, not much can match those first few seasons."

BringingUpBates,fgh5iig,t1_fggxqta,1580777177.0,Okay thanks.
BringingUpBates,fgh5fk8,t1_fggvgro,1580777121.0,"I agree. But they accept the norms of their Gothard based religious beliefs. The role of woman is wife first and mother second if she is married. Which means the odds of them having a traditional job that is not family related is almost non existent. Michaela will likely break that mold. However, she spent the majority of her marriage years thus far as a stay at home wife with an internet business. Josie has been back to the salon since she's had her child? I do not think so, but maybe there is proof otherwise. Luckily for her, she able to go into business with her friend."
jerseyshore,fgh50cr,t1_fgh0ern,1580776840.0,Okay. Will go find it.
BringingUpBates,fggwe6f,t1_fggvyf1,1580771053.0,But how old were the men marrying in at age of courtship announcement opposed to the Bates boys. That is what I was trying to compare to see if Bates men's courtship failure has to do with age as opposed to other fundy men especially their brother-in-laws.
BringingUpBates,fggv3ip,t1_fggusv6,1580770233.0,"Okay. Age. Hmmn... I would have to check the age comparisons at the time of courtship. But until then, Zach's ex turned out to be not so fundy. And maybe that was her bad, because she was the one sitting in disguise. She did not want that life. She ended up taking her time to find someone. I think she had at least two or three relationships before she found her husband. Good for her."
TheMandalorianTV,fggu8g7,t3_eyf1sc,1580769679.0,You guys are rocking it! This is the way.
BringingUpBates,fggtsdu,t1_fggsf56,1580769390.0,"Fair enough. In that case, let's compare them to the men who have dated and married the Bates sister. We definitely have a few lengthy ones there with Michaela and Carlin that come to mind, but some of the others have been across a period of time, too. So I am not fully buying the quickie marriage reason. I think someone has stated here and I have in another thread,  that maybe these Bates boys want these women who are fundie lite (fun, free, godly), but somehow still give the men those Gothard benefits. There is likely some sort of disconnect going on here. Maybe from the female perspective, the boys appear to be fundie lite with their dress and their pop culture references, but when the ladies get in there, the boys are nothing but old school fundie in their views. I know Gil has some wholly sexist views. Maybe the boys pattern.
 I just think many modern women are not down with that kind of thinking anymore. What most of their sisters have managed is rare.  Not every woman can be or is willing to be a stay home woman, with only a side business to cultivate like the Bates sisters (looks like Michaela will be the exception)."

BringingUpBates,fggroi9,t1_fgg2vkc,1580768055.0,"Hmmnn...I dunno. Across fundydom (even using Duggars a comparison) it just seems like the Bates have the worse track record at choosing. Both Zach and Nathan may have been rushed, but it looks like Trace took his time before announcing...still kabloom. I agree in average society you may have to date many times before chosing the right one. We just don't see that for their kind. It would be interesting to figure out how they are missing the formula."
BringingUpBates,fggrakh,t1_fggnkrr,1580767811.0,It was a beautiful statement. Looks like she was the one to end things.
BringingUpBates,fggr6yu,t1_fgg4uol,1580767748.0,Yep. He just posted an acknowledgment. Looks like she felt their relationship should end. So many here were right!
BringingUpBates,fgg0fxw,t1_fgfxysz,1580751562.0,I agree that the crush is Chaney. My point of notice is that there is no need to simply call her a crush if they have announced courtship already...unless it did not pan out.
jerseyshore,fgfz0eu,t1_fgcntb9,1580750686.0,This is a pretty good analysis of it all.

BringingUpBates,fgfwmnc,t1_fgfvxw2,1580749215.0,"I know, but they called Katie's man a boyfriend. Trace and Chaney were seeing each other before Katie and Travis. They also pubically announced it as dating. Kelly confirmed they were courting on one of their Lives. Katie and Travis have not (and pobably will not at this point) announce anything regarding their status. Odd UP wouldn't hint at Katie's crush and Trace's already confirmed girlfriend...if they were still together."
BringingUpBates,fgfw3rg,t3_exx8sa,1580748891.0,"Well if it is a break up, Bates boys are 3 for 3 in failed courtships. What is that all about???  Seriously, something is going wrong once the women are confirmed with them. Do you all think they are arranged whereas the girls have basically fallen in love?"
BringingUpBates,fgfvrao,t1_fge04m6,1580748676.0,"True. It could be that they realized just how far things went in that family and she wanted out. Similarly to Ashley. But, I also could not tell Trace was that into her. He may have been, but just bad at showing it all the time. Referring to a girl you're seriously seeing as friend (and emphasizing it) is usually a bad deal."
BringingUpBates,fgfvj9c,t1_fgdy872,1580748538.0,"You list all viable options. I keep trying to find a scenario where they could still be on, but it appears otherwise online. The only thing I could think of is that she does not want media attention or part in the show at all. That way they do not mention her in their branding but the two are still a couple. Maybe. This would explain why he posted a new years message to her, but she had not done the same. Maybe that is why she has not really posted anything on instagram.

I think it's a break up too, but also know that sometimes social media can be misleading."
BringingUpBates,fgfv5ed,t1_fgfe4v7,1580748297.0,"True, although Trace never seemed that into her as she was into him. He kept calling her a ""friend"". She did not like that. I did not like that! lol"
BringingUpBates,fgfv1ky,t1_fgdy34i,1580748232.0,"Yeah, I think they have called it quits. In the promo for the new season,  UP says Trace has someone new he's crushing on.

When they saw those trash bags they labelled her. It was down hill from there.  Add Jenny hating her, Sammy using her, and her bruising Mike's ego - well then that was a wrap.

Jenny has always been freaking miserable deep down inside. She tries to validate herself through relationships. We only gave her passes because she does have a tender heart; at times she really does want to help. But she is always hating on the other females in the house that she thinks are her competition. The others, she makes her minions. You know what we call that - mean girling. When Snooki tried to be Angelina's friend, Jenny held their friendship hostage. That is childish as fuck. Ronnie is a hot disgusting mess at this point. Are there really any words to describe just how far he has fallen? All I want from him now is a come back story. Situation's appeal will definitaly change as he attempts to merge brands with his wife's. That just leaves Deena and Angelina. Both married. They need to change it to a family style show, like the Kardashians. They need to have their own storylines.

I can understand why during this reboot they are mystified by all the hate. Times have changed! Back in the day, they just thought the kids at the shore were coming at them because they were jealous. lol Once the taping was over, they were able to read the news, hear from the community and see what was on the internet about what others thought. Now everything is in real time. I think Snooki can be annoying because she wants to be both bitchy and the saint. But I can understand her need to protect her ego and her children.

DuggarsSnark,ffsyctn,t3_eui4xu,1580197660.0,"This is a phenomenal question. I am sure there is not one fixed answer. I think the reason why reality tv is so pervasive in western society is because there is an idolization of ""the perfect life"". People peer in to either subconsciously confirm it's real or not.

These other people you listed are predators who made an entire lifetime of abusing and exploiting others. They are menances to society who have been and still are endangerments to others.

I read he gave several of the female coaches a chance to thrive outside of their normally trajectory. Yes, I think it was advantageous to him, becaue he had a burgeoning child athlete , but I think he also began to see the disadvantages women still face in the sports arena and he was planning to try change that.

I am talking about the fact that the very person who hurt you could have saved someone else's life. With that said, from a larger perspective - what is this person? A sinner or a saint? Angel or a demon?  Depends on who you ask. Maybe a mixture of both? Neither?

On another similar note, it sucks when someone we know to have been a dangerous person, rehabs their life and no one remembers our pain.

ETC:
Thanks for sharing your experience.
I have concluded that  Jinger's oversharing of Felicity in SM  is tied to something going on with her personally or her marriage. But I can't place it yet."
DuggarsSnark,ff660ga,t1_fehvhs9,1579619971.0,It is so sad that they are controlling. But I think she is choosing to stay at this point.
CountingOn,ff65tr2,t3_ernh7m,1579619843.0,"""It makes single people like me feel lonely."" 
You are choosing to watch the show. That means you make yourself feel lonely. The show should not adjust to you. You should find programming more suited to your interests. I mean there are definite reasons why the show should go, but not because not everyone can relate to the set-up.
Honestly not trying to be rude. I just don't want you or (any of us) to suffer needlessly."

BringingUpBates,femtlyp,t3_epuu15,1579269243.0,Kelly said January in response to an IG comment. Not sure if she meant this January or next.

jerseyshore,feljsox,t1_fektyf5,1579223878.0,I've heard through out the years that he is a jerk. Glad to finally see it confirmed with an actual story. I would have returned the item with the quickness.
BringingUpBates,feiir9e,t1_feiiieh,1579139477.0,"Yeah. It's hard to say what is going on with them. Only time will tell.

DoubleShotatLove,feh7we8,t1_feh6vty,1579110985.0,Oh! Thanks! I never saw that show. So he's really into her? Wow. That's cool. I guess I gotta watch.
DuggarsSnark,feh260o,t1_fegmcg4,1579107579.0,"I think she *is* bossy. But maybe she is chill when she is not working (like she always is when with her family). CDAN speaks of her several times. There was a recent blind item about her not being a favorite anymore because of that MedicCorps stuff. I wonder if it is true. I mean, it is the only thing that makes sense anymore. I have tried so many of the theories (and excuses) out, but they've all since expired."

DuggarsSnark,feg58nq,t1_feelo58,1579077512.0,"Wow! Thanks so much for posting! If true, the first one #4...gives a lot of details that suddenly makes sense of a whole lot of confusing Jana info.
Such as...
*There was a period of time where Jana was basically non existent on the show. Folks demanded more of her. Wondered where she was and what she was doing (before her social media).

*Pics showing Jana out on her own (Walmart; driving without a chaperone).

* her family letting her road trip with Lauren (without a chaperone) in general and despite constant speculation about their relationship.

*Jana confessing that she has ""dated, courted ... whatever you want to call it"" before, but nothing ever worked out. This caused so much confusion, because many of us could not accept that she'd be allowed to give away pieces of her heart. But at this point, it's the only thing that makes sense about her situation.

*TLC slipped up this past season asking ""when she was looking for someone"" as if she was off the market or they've concluded she is no longer searching for someone...for whatever reason.
(We're still not sure what that one was all about)

* Her -it's complicated- Facebook relationship status. 

* The whole...  her initially being the only female traveling out of country with MedicCorp (this was strange in itself). Then the Duggars tried to keep her out of the group picture. It was the Bates that acknowledged her presence on the trip. And coincidentally when they were being taped without her knowledge (who was right there next to her and twin, but a Bates brother).

Also, no one can convince me she has not hooked up with Lawson Bates. This is a side bar. A while ago, I concluded they were a thing, but possibly never intended to court/marry aka hook up. Which means they had to hide it from parents/public.

I find it quite interesting that these famous fundies who have worked outside the home, travel alone often and have possibly lived outside the big house before marriage --- not one of them have rushed into marriage like their siblings. Not a coincidence.

These people are getting their sex (and/or romance) somewhere. Not trying to be crude. This is a realistic conclusion short of them being asexual/ELSD.

During one Bates Live, Whitney forced Lawson to admit he was in love before. Now how could that have happened short of the Jinger stuff?

I am just saying. I don't follow CDAN often, but the general consensus about this blog is that if names are revealed there, it's because the blogger can prove the information true. 

Do you think these blind items about Jana make sense?"
