When talking directly to her, my wife picked important things to emphasize like milk, mommy, or daddy those kind of words. It’s crazy how much they actually pick up, even the facial expressions, which are critical to ASL."

todayilearned,fczj78p,t1_fczhugl,1578102419.0,"Started by saying the word “milk”, then signed it at the same time and we’d give her the bottle. Then she started signing it herself when she was hungry. A lot of her signs weren’t perfect or she put her own spin on it. We did that with pretty much every sign until we started doing sentences like, “I want milk” or “I’m all done with my milk”. She knew quite a lot by a year and a half. Words like fan, done, mommy, daddy, sleep, diaper, dog. It’s pretty much the same as learning a language for the first time. She was signing by 6 months until about 2 years old when the doctor forced us to stop. We started the day we brought her home from the hospital."
