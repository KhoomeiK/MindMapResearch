PublicFreakout,ffbh8fb,t1_ffbfrca,1579765186.0,"Not sure why you're trying to argue with me, honestly. You're just reiterating half the points I made like you're correcting me. 

The katana is a slashing weapon. Curved on purpose to make it more effective. How much it curved varied from weapon to weapon, so a blanket statement like ""katanas are not curved enough to make much use for slashing"" is just plain wrong. The curve does not have to be large to be effective if it's placed right. The curve is at the point of the blade for a reason, designed that way so that you can easily slice into an opponent without worrying too much about catching on the bone. The curve is also minimized so that the sword can be used for thrusting, but the way the katana is made makes it very strong on the edge and spine, but weak to lateral forces, so stabbing was not the main technique. 

""Long knife and short sword

Knives such as the seax and other blades of similar length – between 1 and 2 feet (~ 30 cm and 60 cm) – are sometimes construed as swords. This is especially the case for weapons from antiquity, made before the development of high quality steel that is necessary for longer swords, in particular

Iron Age swords:
        
Seax, a tool and weapon, common in Northern Europe.
        
Gladius, an early ancient Roman blade
        
Xiphos, a double-edged, single-hand blade used by the ancient Greeks;
   
Certain Renaissance era sidearms:
        
Baselard, a late medieval heavy dagger;
       
Cinquedea, a civilian long dagger;
      
Dirk, the Scottish long dagger (biodag);
       
Hanger or wood-knife, a type of hunting sword or infantry sabre""

So like an undersized sword meant for stabbing.

As far as arming swords go, I was saying either 1 or the other, not both. The term 1 handed or 2 handed is a classification, not a manual, and I couldn't remember the size.

Ok, but it's called a bastard sword, or a hand and a half sword, or a long sword. So again, why are you trying to argue with me like I'm wrong? I prefaced my original comment with ""IIRC"" as a tip off that I was going off memory alone and to take what I wrote with a grain of salt."
PublicFreakout,ffbfdsr,t1_ffbblae,1579762883.0,"To your first point, no, the katana is curved to make slashing easier and katana were all wildly varied within the form.

The term short sword is referring to things like the Gladius, or an undersized sword meant for stabbing from behind a shield. An arming sword was a 1 or 2 handed knight's sword, not a short sword.

A bastard sword is the older term for a hand and a half sword and a claymore is a 2 handed greatsword from, I believe, Scotland or Ireland.

And yes, that was the whole point of my comment. While greatswords *could* be used for chopping off limbs that wasn't their purpose. Only large axes were used to intentionally dismember people, with many of the weapons not even having the option to do so."

I quit after duos got taken away, btw, so I skipped the current MM bullshit, but it was nearly as bad before.

Now the meta has solidified for the maps, with the only real variation being ""which over powered guns am I using this patch?"" and everything else staying fairly consistent.

I started this game essentially blind and it took me a week to even find the Menagerie."
DestinyTheGame,fewno59,t1_feur7m3,1579415981.0,"Right but when skill is matched then gear matters. A good guy with a good gun versus a good guy with a bad gun will lose most of the time. And every new player has bad guns, and every veteran has good guns. So it's bad players with bad guns versus good players with good guns. So people just give up, which is my whole point.

**Also, this is a tangent so you can ignore it as it's just an argument specifically with your assertion that the team doesn't make the player. This has nothing to do with my point above and it *will* be long.**

I have been playing FPS games since 2002, starting with Duke Nukem, going on to UT2004, eventually into CS 1.6 which I put a few thousand hours into, onto some F2P games like Combat Arms or Black Squad, as well as 4,000 hours in CS:GO. Too many games to count really.

Suffice to say I have been playing competitive FPS games for a long time, and I have always been good. So you can believe me when I tell you that having a premade squad makes a *world* of difference compared to a group of random people. And that's without communication. If you all have mics and communicate and they don't? Game over, you win. 

Now, having a premade squad doesn't assure victory, that is true. There are many ways to still lose, but to act like it doesn't matter is absurd. Your teamwork will be better, your call outs will not only exist, but be better understood and listened to. Selfishness and memeing will be funny for the group, not 1 person on a team of 6. Strategies will form around the better players in the group, and the more they play the more cohesive and numerous those strategies become. Teamwork will actually exist rather than 3 people trying to play Rambo simultaneously.

Someone doesn't have a weapon they want? Well your 3 people won't have to wait for MM and that alone will save you tons of time a solo person can't do anything about. Then the actual strike or forge or event is a breeze because ya'll have 3 players who are coordinated. No one is being left as a ghost to respawn on their own after 30 seconds because their teammates didn't bother to stop for 5 seconds and resurrect them.

There are very numerous benefits to being in a premade squad and your stats *will* reflect that. They don't call them carries for no reason. They make your life easier and carry you to a place you otherwise wouldn't get to. And if you are the carry even shitty teammates who listen are better than good teammates who don't."

My point is that Bungie doesn't match make very well and the new players who try Crucible get absolutely destroyed and many give up. And you can't really blame them when they get slaughtered by weapons they can't get, by people who already have a huge skill and experience edge.

DestinyTheGame,fewlsr5,t1_fewgbsk,1579413942.0,"Better Devils is amazing in PvP and one of the few handcannons that can get the explosive charge perks. I would say the Better Devils is roughly on par with an Austringer, though I feel the Austringer god roll is better than the Better Devils because it will out range the Devils by a lot. The Austringer is way easier to grind for god rolls as well. 

I personally don't like the Old Fashioned, but you should use it for a match and see if you might. Your taste in weapons will change as you get better, so try not to throw away any Legendary weapons unless they are duplicates or have perks that don't apply to the gun. Like a Sniper rifle with Hip Fire Grip or something. I also wouldn't bother with any blue weapons since they come with fewer perks and I don't think blue weapons have mod slots, but I could be wrong.

Most handcannons will 3 tap to the head, but some will 2 tap, depending on the perks they've activated. Austringer is 2 to the head and 1 to the body or 5 to the body for most guardians.

Currently, after spending about 100 hours grinding, my average kdr is at 1.8-2.5 with most matches. But that doesn't stop me from getting rofl stomped when a Rumble lobby pops up with 3 laggy as fuck Chinese players and 3 people with LoW and 2 with Mountaintop."

I'm not shocked in any way that Crucible numbers are low and New Light players aren't playing. And that's what my argument is about. Ya'll are justifying as hard as you can, but in the end while these obstacles are possible to get over, but to many people they aren't worth the trouble. 

A healthy multiplayer population *requires* casual players, and currently there is no way to be a casual Crucible player without having hundreds of hours in PvE.

The things I'm talking about may not matter to you, but if you want a healthy and *large* player base, these are the things preventing that. These are the things that will turn casuals, bad players, and impatient people away entirely. These are the things that will cause people to give up long before they ""get good"" or ""get geared.""

And the fact that you can't counter these weapons without the weapon or another Exotic/hard to get weapon is all the more infuriating.

It all adds up to making Crucible a truly un-enjoyable experience. Your only choice is to grind for these weapons which can take weeks (I couldn't buy the Lord of Wolves without Forsaken and am on week 2 of grinding for it) or play crucible for it, or you can't even get it! 

So I'm not surprised that the F2P players both aren't playing Crucible and if they are they are trapped in the lower ranks because there isn't much you can do when you get 1 tapped by every one in the lobby especially since you can't do that yourself because all you have is a Masterworked Austringer and a shotgun and your enemies have LoW, Izanagi's, Mountaintop, and Randy's Throwing knife.

2. Turn and walk away. This works mainly on younger dogs that already know you, but can work on some older dogs or can be ""trained"" into a dogs behavior. 

3. Basically the same as 2, but you walk in the direction they're going. Sometimes they just want to go for a walk and in that case making it clear you're also going for a walk will encourage them to join you. This usually takes longer, and I really only recommend doing this in isolated areas where the lack of a leash isn't so dangerous.

The actual key to catching your dog starts before they run away. Whenever you call your dog, after they come to you they should get some serious loving or treats for the first year or so that you adopt. This will instill in them the idea that coming when they're called is *always* a good thing. Even if they get in trouble they will always come because of the chance for a treat/love.

Specifically your argument that the prices haven't gone up significantly past inflation. Which is flat out wrong. I suppose you could argue that none of them were buying houses in 1946, but I think it's important to note the difference between the start of their generation, halfway between our generations, and our current generation. It shows a distinct increase in the ratio of house cost versus wages made. 

And yes I also looked everything up and did the math. Congratulations? My whole point is that the 1965 numbers are as relevant to 2020's as 1975's are in this argument. As you said, ""they are statistics"" which clearly show house prices outpacing wages. And that 10 year difference, between 1965 and 1975, accounts for almost 30% of the increase in house prices, from the 75% increase between 1965 and 2020."

If you use the oldest boomer ages (1946) it's harder to find numbers, but my best guest, and liberal estimate, is about $10,000. The numbers I saw suggested 7k, but I rounded up for you. That's $131,000 in today's dollar, which is roughly a 75% increase on top of inflation."

It's about how you say it and the context you use it in. Also your own attitude matters more than the word itself. To be offended because someone who pretends to like you pretends to be your friend is the height of absurdity.

Man 1 (Aces) - Gets dealt 2 cards, both Aces. This is considered by most to be *the* best starting cards you can get in Texas Hold 'Em. He is starting the game with a pair and the other 5 cards haven't even been dealt yet.

Man 2 - Dealt a King and Jack of the same suit. Not quite as strong as a ""pocket pair"" but still considered a decent start. If pocket face cards (AA,KK,QQ,JJ) are considered S tier, this would be considered A tier along with any other combo of suited face cards.


The flop, or first 3 cards show up and Man 1 has a chubby. He's got Three of a kind Aces, a hand which will win 70% of the time you get it. Rainbow cards, meaning all different suits, and no Straight possible yet. He is feeling confident and likely raised.

Man 2 on the other hand is looking at 4 out of 5 cards of the best Straight you can get, and if he's really lucky he might get 2 more diamonds for the Flush. If he's really, really lucky he'll get an Ace of diamonds for the best Flush you can get, second best if not. Straight Flushes and Royal Flushes cross his mind, but are dismissed as unlikely. He calls ready to fold but hoping for a 10 (Straight) or at least a diamond (Flush). Currently he has no hand.

The turn. The 4th out of 5 cards. This is the turning point for Man 2, and the start of Man 1's downfall. The 10 just gave Man 2 the Straight, which beats a Three of a kind. His heart is soaring, it's not only the 10 he needed, but it's a 10 of diamonds. Now he's thinking about the Straight Flush. Now he's thinking about the Royal Flush. His hopes are high right now and he considers it his pot.

Man 1 feels uneasy. His 3 of a kind is now vulnerable. These are high stakes and the likely-hood of his opponent having face cards or suited cards is high. He still feels confident, but doubts are forming. He likely raises again to prevent showing weakness to Man 2, who calls or raises. This gives power to his doubts and his game plan has changed from ""get as much as possible"" to either ""need to get him to fold"" or ""he has the straight, fuck fuck fuck. Fuck."" He's now praying for another 9, Queen, or 10 to show up giving him a full house, which beats all the previous hands. 4 of a kind hasn't crossed his mind since he was first dealt the Aces.

The River. The final card. The single most hated and loved card in Texas Hold 'Em. Feared and revered. Ace of mother fucking diamonds.

Man 1 and Man 2 simultaneously get hard at the same time. The pot is theirs. They just fucking won. Each is giddy, but doing their utmost to keep it from showing outwardly. Each one is madly thinking through the best possible ways to get their opponent to all-in. Man 1 just got the dream hand. Four of a kind Aces. 3rd best hand possible, and the best version possible. The Royal Flush is considered but *dismissed as unlikely.* Man 1 now hopes Man 2 has either a Flush or a Straight so he'll call the all-in. 

Man 2 plans to buy lottery tickets tonight.

The rest is in the video. Hope this helps, also below I'll list out the hands in order from best to worst as a reference.

**Royal Flush** - 10 J Q K A of the same suit. Extremely rare. Might see it once every 100,000 hands. 

**Straight Flush** - Any cards of the same suit in order that stops at King or lower. i.e. 6 7 8 9 10 of hearts or  9 10 J Q K of spades.

**Four of a Kind** - 4 cards of the same number/face. i.e. 2 2 2 2 or Q Q Q Q

**Full House** - A Three of a kind and a pair in the same hand. i.e. K K K Q Q or 8 8 8 3 3

**Flush** - Any 5 spades, hearts, diamonds, or clubs of the same suit. i.e. 5 cards with the same colors and symbols, but random numbers and letter.

**Straight** - 5 cards in a row with 2 or more suits. i.e. 4 5 6 7 8 or 10 J Q K A

**Three of a Kind** - Any 3 cards of the same number/face. i.e. K K K or 7 7 7

**2 Pair** and a **Pair** are fairly self explanatory. i.e. 3 3 or 4 4 or both.
