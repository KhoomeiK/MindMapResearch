It’s about delaying your initial reaction, and thinking about it a bit. Maybe you decide your initial reaction is the right one.

You are on the right path for you right now. This nurse is talking nonsense."
BorderlinePDisorder,fgn838a,t3_ezdlut,1580939468.0,"When it comes to spirituality of course everything is very individual and different for each person at different stages in their life and spiritual journey and also it will depend on the religion. BPD adds another layer to this.  BPD people can be very sensitive to human emotions, they can have a very strong desire to seek out spiritual truths. In this they can have a lot of strength and depth in their spiritual journey, that others may have a more difficult time grasping (this is as huge generalization). 

But on to different religions:

I'm no expert on Buddhism but in some strains of buddhism, the self is an illusion. And also a good buddhist has to free themselves of any kind of attachments, because attachments are based in a false sense of self.  So, a BPD person might not feel a sense of self, but they might have a strong craving to be a certain way or to have an identity. 

In Christianity, the self is always foundational and while there is language of self-emptying, it always assumes that God created the self and that means it is good. Most Christian traditions will say that you need to have a self, before you can, out of wisdom, love, and maturity, empty it. So for a BPD person who struggles with a sense of self, in a Christian perspective, it would be more advisable to build up a stable sense of self as God defines you, before you focus on the self-emptying (which is just another way of being authentically you). In this way, self love and love for other can find a healthy balance. 

In Christianity, this idea of self-emptying had some abuses. Sometimes people like women and minorities were asked to self-sacrifice more than those in power. Like women were told to ""bear their cross"" if the  husband was abusive and endure it with love toward their husband. So feminist theologies began to talk about self-actualization as a higher priority than self sacrifice.  

It is a very deep and fascinating topic. For me, I have done things that i thought at the time were super spiritual, like sacrificing my wishes and desires, but later realized I just caved in to someone else and betrayed my own integrity. I used to think standing up for myself and loving myself were not spiritual.  I think that was really misguided on my part.

Hello,
Thank you for contacting Blackstone Products, so I tried the wind guards on our griddles, it does work however the hood of the griddle catches where the vent is to the wind guard so the lid closes but no 100% all the way. You should be okay however if you use both of these together, just be advised it does catch at the vent of the wind guard.
