Just make sure to hold your head high and not give up. Tons can change in just a year alone. Nothing in life is permanent, so while the good times dont last forever, the bad dont either, you taking initiative like this already shows you have a good head on your shoulders and have the willpower to push through the bad times. Truly wish you the best of luck. On a side note, if you still have your first bank account you opened when your parents co-signed, make sure to get it switched to an indepent account and get their names off their."

patientgamers,fcl3yoi,t1_fcjxkpt,1577739291.0,"Aye, I feel the port is less about doing justice, and more so a testament to how far technology has come. I remember in middle school me and my friends would talk about how awesome it would be to have RPG's like Skyrim and such on a handheld."
