relationships,fg7ej2s,t3_excbmw,1580590574.0,"If you’ve already told her many times what risks her behaviour poses, just stop! Some people only learn by consequences, like a nasty bout of food poisoning. You’re just driving yourself crazy, worrying on her behalf when she clearly doesn’t give a rats. That’s a lot of mental energy to expend on someone else!! Plus, if she’s been doing this without consequence for 4 years she probably has the constitution of an ox and is way less susceptible to the kinds of issues you fear for her than the average person. As long as you don’t have to eat her food, step back and just worry about your own stuff. It’s lovely that you care, but she clearly doesn’t need or want you to, so save yourself the agonising."

fasting,ffokxeu,t3_eu8ml7,1580078741.0,"The natural and artificial flavours and sucralose (it’s Blue Raz? I’m assuming a sweetish raspberry-esque flavour?) will spike insulin, so full fasting effects will not be achieved. A flavourless electrolyte supplement would be better."

aww,feipt69,t1_fehvndt,1579144208.0,Thank you soooo much for taking the time to provide all this fabulous info! Definitely going to be putting it into action. Fingers crossed we can get a similar result with time and patience. They are both wonderful kitties in their own right and it kills me that the grumpy (only since new kitty arrived) cat’s  previously blissful existence has been ‘ruined’ by our super sweet newcomer!!

fasting,fe7o1h4,t3_eo0n5d,1578917282.0,"If you pay for the Premium version of MFP you can track calories under 1000 (which I had to do following bariatric surgery). It gives you a warning message at the end of the day about your calorie count not being recommended but you just ignore it.  Annoying, but I get why they do it."
loseit,fdtxqqy,t3_en0din,1578723956.0,"Well done, that is no small feat!! Logging is key for me in terms of awareness and accountability and I’m currently on a 41 day streak with My Fitness Pal - heading for the hundred! Thanks for the inspiration boost!"

fasting,fdmwwe0,t3_elvwwm,1578569511.0,"Congrats and thanks so much for all the details, totally helped with a couple of questions I had knocking about in my head. I also keep a small container of ground Himalayan Pink salt with me whenever I’m doing over 18 hours of fasting. Perks me up and keeps headaches at bay (and I love salt, used to ‘drink’ it from the shaker as a child, lol)."
BariatricSurgery,fdmvxsn,t3_em75lm,1578568315.0,"Getting in your water is a bit of a full time job initially!! I started with 3 sips at a time with a couple of minutes in between and just did the best I could. The post-surgery guidelines are typically an ideal, but there is recognition that it will take a bit of time to get up to the recommended numbers for both water and protein. I love that you are practicing this ahead of surgery - never even occurred to me!!"
loseit,fdj54nl,t3_ellfrk,1578458709.0,"You are a rockstar!!! Everything you shared was gold and totally resonates with me. MFP is my fave tool, and like you I would love to be able to not need it, but I do.  This is my year to get rid of a 60lb weight regain and I’m at 14lbs down and feeling really positive. Keep moving forward, you’ve got this!"
