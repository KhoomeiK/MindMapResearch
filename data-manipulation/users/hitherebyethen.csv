and no pardons needed ahaha, it’s taken me a while to think of it like “fuck him”, but you’re right. 

i really hope i can one day feel comfortable showing my scars. it’s comments like yours that make me feel closer and closer to that day. thanks again :)"

ahaha i like him but it was casual and i didn’t think it would be quite fair to get him involved in my personal emotional struggles. didn’t think it was very relevant in a hookup anyway. but you totally have a point, i am going to have to show them to someone at some point if i chose to be in a relationship. i can only hope they’ll be as accepting as you are. either way, i really hope some day i’ll be comfortable enough to stop hiding them"

Trust me, I despise the idea of him doing such a thing to anyone else, but unfortunately we’re both minors and I’ve tried to look into the laws for my state to see if I could report him, but everything I could find was incredibly murky. In other circumstances I would probably just try and file a report against him anyways, but I think at my age my parents would have to get involved. I can’t even imagine telling anyone in real life, let alone my parents."

offmychest,ff7avu0,t1_ff5l5km,1579644986.0,"well first off: you’re an amazing friend. she is genuinely so lucky to have you. 

i think it depends on the person, but for me, i just always wished i had someone to talk to about it all. i think a big part of healing is being able to kind of purge out all the negative thoughts and flashbacks. listening might just be more affective than anything you could say with words.

on the side of saying things, i think it would’ve been helpful to hear that it’s not my fault. i know some people might think that’s kind of a given, but i really spent a long time (and sometimes still do) thinking it had something to do w me as a person or my body. i felt a lot of guilt and still go through all the events wondering if i could’ve done something different to prevent it. however u think is the right way to express these concepts to her is probably best. 

please please please feel free to msg me. i’m more than happy elaborate on any of these, add more ideas, or just talk it out. either way, please also feel free to keep me updated. i always wished i had someone to support me through this, and i’d love to enable you to support her the very best you can."

AskReddit,fdypyn9,t1_fdymtu1,1578782406.0,"Thank you for sharing. 

That all makes sense. I’m extremely fortunate to have grown up in a fairly stable family environment, but as you said, it’s certainly hard to see what is going on behind the scenes when you’re living through it. 

I think a big part of why my parents object to therapy and such is because they’re immigrants and when they were around 12 their country was at war, so to them my issues may (understandably) seem minuscule or hard to understand. Furthermore, the concept of mental health isn’t as prominent in their culture.

More info: 
I am actually the daughter in this scenario. This was 5 years ago, and my parents told the psychologist they would get me therapy, but ultimately never did (nor discussed my mental well-being with me after that day). 

They told my parents this because a friend had discovered I had been self-harming and took me to the guidance counselor. When they called my mom in, I explained how I had been cutting (multiple sessions a day) and dealing with a lot of anxiety. Now, 5 years later, I am still dealing with a lot of the same things and am hoping to get therapy or other mental health services for myself once I graduate from high school. A part of me feels I may not have such deep issues with these things had my parents followed the psychologist’s instructions that day. I was just curious what their rationale could potentially be for deciding not to get me therapy."
