You got a very nice base for your army. There's a Witch King, a bunch of orcs, and a troll. You said that you have a morannon command set already, which allows you to get additional command. Assuming you're going for matched play, this is what you have at the moment:

\- Witch king on fell beast, with full upgrades is 225 pts.

\- Morannon captain with shield: 55 pts

\- Orc shaman: 50 pts

\- 18 morannons with spears and shields - 162pts

\- 18 morannons with shields - 144 pts

\- morannon with banner: 32

\- Mordor troll (two handed?) 100 / 130 pts

That's whooping 798 points, BUT you lack command units, as you're two units over. Models you'd need:

Some cavalry. Here you can go for Black Numenorians or your traditional warg raiders.

For archers, I wouldn't recommend anything orc-ish. You might want to ally something like Harad, in which case get a box of Hardad warriors, and convert one of them to a captain. In green alliance they can go up to 50% bow limit.

If you want to go bigger numbers, substitute your morannons for regular orcs.

Car insurance (young driver):

80 per month

8 tax

Other expenses:

Fuel about 80 per month

Now add food for two people, let's say that if we eat just the very basics at 50 per week and a tenner for house maintenance supplies (probably could do cheaper) it leaves us with a grand cost of living at:

1268

I now work a second job as a pizza delivery driver in the evenings so we can get out of debt...

Edit: additionally, phone (I need unlimited data for work) is about £30. My wife needs some prescriptions, and there's a couple of other expenses... it really adds up. I'm not on minimum wage, but the money just runs away anyway."
