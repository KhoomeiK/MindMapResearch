those lucky motherfuckers. I saw bitcoin when it was first announced and remembered my history classes: ""unregulated currency market? SCAM!""

i should have said ""unregulated currency market? SCAM I CAN EXPLOIT!"""

Eurasia really is the one that is a mess - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Plate#/media/File:EurasianPlate.png

Africa is pretty straight forward - aside from the fact that it is rifting apart. 

North And South America are their own individual plates - with the Caribbean plate between.  

Australia is on it's own plate.  New Zealand/Zealandia is one of the more complex spots too as it sits astride the Pacific-Australian plate boundary.

her shit of a lawyer (doing his job) told her exactly how much to demand to make it not worth my time to take her to court and fight it.  

oh and my lawyer ""yeah if she made just 10k more you probably could make 4x what you make, but she'd be told to pound sand on alimony by the judges.""

stupid ass shit.  those laws are meant to protect stay at home spouses, not avaricious asshats with jobs."
