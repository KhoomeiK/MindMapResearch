Truckers,ffqosjc,t3_euh5lg,1580140124.0,"I started my career with Prime. When they gave me my rig, it was a lease OP truck that the dude, after driving for all of an hour, swung hard into a parked truck at a truck stop down the road. He blew a .09. Got hammered the day he got his truck, got thrown out. Truck had like 59 miles on it when I got it.

At some point, someone forgot that I was a company driver and gave me that truck. And I loved it. Condo cab, brand new headache rack with aftermarket lights on the back, black (which is rare, most Prime trucks are primary colors)... 175,000 miles and only had a single issue, where the horn and cruise control were toggling rapidly, which ended up being a short in the steering wheel.

But the best part? That sweet l/op 65mph. It was glorious."

I went from not even being able to clear the third chamber, to obliterating the High Dragun in the span of three runs. You start getting better at clearing rooms, better at dodge rolling, better at managing curse vs cool for better casings and chest drops...

You'll kill your past. :D Don't let the Gungeon get you down!"
WTF,ffc6nvh,t1_ffc21ps,1579792774.0,The tiny glass shards might have something to say about it.
EnterTheGungeon,ffc64e3,t3_esrrxt,1579792417.0,"Wicked dude! I got my first Jammed Kill Pillars Master Round just last night! :D Which is hilarious, since I didn't get the master round on the Bullet Twins that same run.

The Gungeon is a cruel mistress."
