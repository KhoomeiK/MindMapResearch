canada,ffstjz5,t1_ffrlsls,1580191940.0,"Fuck no, hospital waiting rooms are milling with sick people, that's one of the riskiest places to go unless what you have is worse. Plus it's going to take time, and for nonresidents, possibly money, and it throws your plans into disarray. Staying home is going to be enough for most people, whether they have a regular cold or flu, or 2019-nCoV."

Wellington,ffr4jw8,t3_eu4u7d,1580150306.0,"There's still some skepticism about whether it is indeed transmissible before symptoms show; the data hasn't been made available yet and the announcement was by a minister, not a doctor or researcher. Other coronaviruses are not transmissible this way.

A two-week quarantine on entry would be a massive economic hit; it would effectively shut down international tourism to NZ. Most tourists are only coming for a fortnight in the first place, and those coming for less than several months would still have little interest in spending two weeks of their stay cooped up under quarantine. And that's not to mention business travellers, particularly to Australia.

Don't buy into the fear. It's less transmissible than measles, which is definitely transmissible before symptoms, and of which we had over a thousand cases in Auckland alone last year. But did you or anyone you know contract it?

Epidemiologists aren't recommending anything we're not already doing. Yes, we'll get cases in NZ. But we'll deal with them, it's unlikely to become an outbreak. The flu kills more people every year, but nobody's freaking out about it, because it's not a new unknown thing."

funny,ffq8zl4,t1_ffq1myg,1580126474.0,"Not the parent commenter, but I would imagine that any money, whether metered out or lump sum, would make things worse if they're not clean. You could make an annual amount conditional on, say, having a consecutive year of clean drug tests, based on a certain number of randomly timed tests per year, and over time, you could either taper off the testing frequency or increase the money given at a time, as they establish a track record of being clean. You could also have a provision that they could use money for a rehab program.

Any complicated thing like that is going to have non-negligible administration costs, though, and your beneficiaries may not appreciate being treated that way, so you'd probably want to only maintain that for a few years before either deciding that they can be trusted with the money (in which case just give it to them) or they can't (in which case, find a worthy charity or distribute it to other people). And unfortunately, you won't be there to decide, so you'd have to come up with some rule that would determine your decision.

Probably talk it over with your lawyer, they'll have most likely seen this sort of situation before and would have some recommendations."

There's definitely a difference, even with equal preparation, of a threat that you can kinda forget about until it happens, and one that you're being reminded of every day, seeing on the news what it's doing to other communities and wondering if you're next. Given the choice, I'd probably pick earthquakes too. But I dunno, I might change my mind if Wellington gets the big one. Or when..."

Wellington,ffj0nl6,t1_ffhrv62,1579987413.0,"Yes, but no. You'd need 1000 M5 quakes to dissipate the same energy as one M7 quake (or 1000 M6 for one M8). There aren't enough small quakes to add up to a meaningful effect, and I think we'd get pretty sick of it if there were."
Wellington,ffizunb,t1_ffhs7ig,1579986826.0,"I assume you mean wildfire? Fire, just get out of the building. Wildfire, stay on top of all alerts and follow instructions from emergency authorities. *Don't wait, evacuate!* If there's a recommendation of voluntary evacuation, go then if you can; don't wait for an order of mandatory evacuation, especially in or near towns that can clog evacuation routes with traffic. Know your exits, too; the fewer roads out you have, the sooner you should leave. There are relatively few wildfire deaths among those who evacuate when ordered. It's usually firefighters and people who have stayed behind to defend property or who think they can wait until the last minute.

Tornadoes, we don't get monster ones here, pretty much go to the smallest most interior room, or the basement if you have one. Sit in the most solid corner, and if your building gets hit, head down, hands on neck and elbows around face to protect them."

Wellington,ffivdw6,t1_ffiqs4r,1579983635.0,"Nah, it's still the main quake, it's just a mode of shaking that arrives sooner because it travels faster. P-waves (for **p**rimary or **p**ressure) push and pull the ground toward and away from the hypocentre, and since rock doesn't really compress much, they travel quite quickly. S-waves (for **s**econdary or **s**hear) shake the ground perpendicular to the direction to the hypocentre, and rely on friction, which, while pretty high in the earth, does give up a bit more energy and so the wave is slower. S-waves are more damaging, though, because they tend to have more of a horizontal component, and on a larger scale, a slight twisting component."
Wellington,ffhrlt6,t1_ffhr04j,1579950247.0,"Doubt it, it just did a regular go-around and is coming in for landing again. Wasn't a big quake, and if they had to check the runway I'd imagine they'd have been in a longer hold or had to divert.

Also, stop-start works *way* better with a manual, because it stops as soon as you let the clutch out in neutral, and starts again as soon as you apply the clutch; by the time you're in gear, you have power, rather than it only starting when you come off the brake. And they try to combat that in the automatic by starting as soon as you reduce pressure on the brake, so if you try to ease to a stop (to avoid that slight jerk back as the suspension decompresses) by reducing brake pressure just as you're coming to a stop, it thinks you're not really stopping, and aborts the engine-stop.
