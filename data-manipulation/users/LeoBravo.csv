Do you know what parish you need? The church baptismal/marriage records at the NLI website MIGHT go back far enough to give you the much-needed connection but these aren’t indexed so be prepared to scour through lots of microfilm.

Also, if you get stuck and are losing the will to go on, look up the overall history of the relevant surname. If you’re lucky like I was, a medieval historian might have some historical genealogy on the heads of the clan which is a nice addition to the family story, for example in my case I got the name of our overall ancestor, ie “everybody with this surname is descended from this guy somehow”.

2. Shorten terms to contract lengths. No more constituencies; if you like the job a representative  does, you go online, fill out a form that says “that’s my guy!” and thereafter whenever he casts a vote in Parliament it’s worth one more because now he represents you too. When he starts doing a poor job you can go online and transfer your vote to someone else and then THEY have your vote instead. Each representative gets paid according to how many people they represent, so representatives are motivated to please as many people as possible.

But that was considered “interference” and ignored. Once the Leave vote happened anyway, it was no longer possible to prevent economic damage from happening to Northern Ireland, and at that point the goal became MINIMISING the damage.

In terms of “giving Nationalists an invisible veto”, both Nationalists and Unionists are supposed to have a veto — that’s how Stormont is supposed to work. So if Stormont hadnt been suspended at the time, that veto would have occurred anyway. But Stormont was suspended, and the DUP was in coalition with the Tories as a clear end-run around any restrictions that Stormont would’ve applied. The fact that that little stunt backfired and ended with the Tories throwing the DUP under the bus (once no longer needed) is not something Varadkar nor Coveney engineered: it was merely a predictable end result of what happens when people trust the Tories.

Ultimately, how is it that Ireland and/or the EU should have dealt with Unionists? Dealing with Northern Ireland as a whole was impossible because, as already mentioned, Stormont was suspended. NI had no government. I don’t recall any private consultations of the SDLP or Sinn Féin either.

I’m not trying to be smart with you but I’m genuinely unsure what more Ireland and the EU could have done. The assumption was that the DUP already had an “invisible veto” via their coalition. And both sides having a veto should have approximated Stormont.

So this is a legitimate, non-rhetorical question: what should Ireland and the EU have done?"

It took away his master and made him more receptive to his master’s more... unorthodox teachings (which they had frequently argued about before then). It caused him to defy the Council for the first time by taking Anakin as a Padawan, which - when he saw how he got away with it - gave him a more rebellious (mischievous?) attitude than he would have had otherwise.

Regardless, a slug that hits a lightsaber would pass through the magnetic field, the plasma within would reduce it to molten, liquid metal, which would be carried by its momentum out the other side and hit whatever’s behind the lightsaber. I’m not sure what kind of damage it would do, though. Without a solid, pointy tip, the bullet probably wouldn’t have as much penetrative capability, so I dunno how far it would pierce flesh.

CurseofStrahd,ffiitr4,t3_etrmxu,1579974898.0,"Anything that predictable can be countered.

If the party knows he’ll drop through the floor when in trouble, then the logical thing to do is to lure him to the basement and fight him there. Or station the destined ally in the room below. If my party were so clever as to predict his every move that masterfully, I’d allow the party ally to deal a 1hko as Strahd would be taken so unawares that I’d treat it as a coup de grace, and he’d instantly be reduced to mist form.

This is a battle of wits; Strahd is only as “one step ahead” as he is because over the course of the adventure Strahd uses Scrying on the players and has spies in every town. It’s up to the players to figure out they’re being spied on and develop countermeasures, or their attempt to defeat Strahd will be doomed before it even begins. Strahd can prepare any (level appropriate) spell if he knows what to prepare for.

The party needs to:

* solve their tarokka readings and obtain the critical weapons/allies/info

* protect themselves from Strahd’s surveillance

* keep Ireena from Strahd so that he becomes desperate and less cautious

* lose to Strahd a few times over the course of the adventure (the first time they enter Castle Ravenloft should not also be the final time) so that they get a feel for the type of tactics he uses

* optionally, gain additional power from the Amber Temple

“Play Strahd intelligently” means Strahd should not be a battle they can win just by walking up and fighting him like any old boss battle. It should be like *Mass Effect* where they spend the entire campaign accumulating every advantage they can find ahead of the battle. If the players just blunder into Ravenloft and expect to win with little to no prep, let Strahd give them a spanking and send them back to the drawing board."

Regulation is necessary for precisely this reason. Economists have already defined “rent seeking” behaviour as being unhelpful to the economy over the long term.

You don’t understand the Troubles, the IRA or the problems with the Brits as much as you think you do, so avoid speaking about them unless it’s to ask a question (and include no assumptions in the phrasing of the question, either). Even when you think you’re being sympathetic, you’re probably wrong. Speaking favourably of the IRA won’t go down well. Speaking unfavourably of the IRA won’t go down well.

What you ARE expected to know: A. The nation of Ireland is not part of the UK, England, or Britain. We are our own country. British currency is not accepted here. B. Northern Ireland is a separate thing and is technically a part of the UK. Spend your British currency there."

todayilearned,ffeainx,t3_et4b2a,1579841289.0,"Reading that article reminded me of Star Trek’s most unbelievable conceit that I had completely forgotten or overlooked: the idea that the French language will become obscure by the 24th century and French people will willingly transition to speaking English (with British accents!). This, to me, is more implausible than the idea of Americans and Russians serving in the same military, or money being basically abolished. The French are as protective of their language as American Republicans are protective of their guns: you can have the French tongue when you pull it from their cold dead mouths. The idea that Picard would be ABLE to speak fluent English isn’t fanciful in the least, but the idea that it would be his FIRST language is practically unthinkable to me."

If the dude decided he needed his gun, I’m not waiting to see what he does when he gets back to his car so he can shoot from behind cover. If he’s still holding his gun I have to assume he’s still planning on using it."
