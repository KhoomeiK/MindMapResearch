Sometimes there's something hiding underneath it all causing the problems. Therapy is a great way to get these feelings out.  And being vulnerable with the people you care about can bring you closer (as long as they're not dicks) If you're 25 and under it's likely (also) hormones and that gets better with time

You should be given a frikkin medal. That's how badass you are. I'd say to look for community to try to help if therapy and meds aren't cutting it. Find a mom group, pick up a hobby you cam bring your kids along as well (crafting hobbies are often kid friendly). Meet some more adults. And yes, it's okay to be bitter. Our society doesn't support parents as much as we should. That wasn't as bad when people still had grandparents at home to help, but as more families are more nuclear there is less family support and nothing else to cover the gap. Except community. I know between working and kids you likely don't have a lot of free time or energy, but it's worth it to get out when you can. You can also try volunteering at old folks homes with your kid. Having a kid around really revitalizes them. And as a bonus other people would love to hang out with your kiddo to give you a little break. We should really have more intergenerational help."
