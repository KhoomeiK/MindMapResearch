intermittentfasting,fesdr8q,t3_eqggdd,1579364132.0,I tend to treat coffee as more of a special treat (cold brew) but tea I could definitely do. I’ll just have to make a cup to bring to work before I switch to my water supply. Thank you!

bulletjournal,fe4krnm,t3_enquc3,1578860360.0,"I prefer to not do weekly spreads. I do a daily set up of tasks (dots), notes to self (dash), and money spent (squares). I have a monthly list/calendar thing for each month and a future log for stuff in the future. I also do little circles for events. Doing pretty drawings and tape is nice and all but my bujo is to keep my life running smoothly, not for looking pretty. Don’t sweat not having pretty monthly cover sheets and a cute weekly spread. This is the one point where function beats fashion IMHO."
bulletjournal,fe44ust,t3_enm3ni,1578855786.0,I applaud you for re watching everything. Even the movie we do not speak of.
SkincareAddiction,fe41lfb,t1_fdzlnkl,1578854914.0,Here here! People think I’m “overly cautious” when I don’t want to walk through places filled with latex balloons.
SkincareAddiction,fe417zp,t1_fdyke7v,1578854794.0,Can confirm. Both my mom and I found out we’re allergic to latex because we had braces with latex rubber bands at the same time. At that point she had been a nurse for over 25 years and had never reacted to latex (gloves) before. Skin is weird.
German,fdcgp11,t3_ekhzs0,1578274456.0,Yes. For the German word for turkey. (Truthahn) This made explaining Thanksgiving very not fun for me while there. I sounded like an idiot.

SkincareAddiction,fcspfkz,t1_fcn9g00,1577921782.0,"It’s ok. My injury is a combo of overuse and natural structure. I’ve accepted it for what it is which is my body saying “slow down bitch!” LOL
I’m thinking STRESS plays a bigger role than I’m willing to admit. My relationship is kind of a roller coaster through the holidays TBH. I’ve introduced no new products but I’ve pared down to the basics just in case. The cicaplast balm is doing the trick again luckily. The thing was really unhappy for a few days.
I have been to an allergist! I did the scratch test and only reacted to two plants that don’t exist in my area! It was wild. Considering my history the doc was expecting me to light up like a Xmas tree. She thought I was sensitive to particles in the air so I use a nose spray to keep things clear in there. Also turns out I have not horrible but bad acid reflux so I chew a anti acid tablet before bed. Life has improved significantly since these additions. My skin just hates me I think."
bulletjournal,fcsotuc,t1_fcso22c,1577921353.0,"Thank you. I had more pictures of my monthly log, future log, workout log, and cleaning list but this captures my bujo perfectly. KISS at its best."
SkincareAddiction,fcn8q2r,t1_fcn6e2m,1577806162.0,"Darn it. I thought this might happen. Alas. Thank you for your help. I really appreciate it. Since this is the 3rd flare in about 3 months I plan on making a appointment with a dermatologist ASAP. 

My GP kind of brushed it off and just gave me the steroid cream to be honest. No follow up or questioning. I haven’t been back since reference this specific issue. When I have my yearly check up (summer) it hasn’t been flaring. 
I have a number of medical allergies: latex and multiple kinds of antibiotics. I react to skincare products not a lot but more than the average person. I can’t use benzoyl peroxide without going cherry red and I tend to use sensitive marketed face products. 
My dad has super sensitive skin (we’re estranged so I don’t know more than that) and my mom has roscecea (spelling, sorry). 
The only addition of “winter” clothing is jackets that don’t touch my neck. I like funnel neck silhouettes. Florida isn’t particularly cold to most people but we’ve fluxed this year a lot for me. One week is 50 Fahrenheit and low humidity and the next is 75 Fahrenheit and 80% humidity. Up down up down. No new hobbies. I usually run but I’m injured. 

Thank you again."
SkincareAddiction,fcmwo6u,t3_ei28wu,1577795643.0,"My skin has turned dry AF in the last 3 years. Thanks late 20’s! This only began 4 years ago and usually only happens once a year during the first cold snap. When I first got it a friend thought I had shingles from the picture. It was only on the side of my neck at this point. 
This year has been awful though. 
My routine that actually touches my neck is thus: Bioderma sensibio micellar water on occasion, Aveeno unscented body wash, I use either Vanicream lotion or cream or FAB Ultra repair cream. Occasionally I throw some extra jojoba or LEO oil on top at night. I occasionally  drag a little Differin down my neck but that’s only when I squeeze too much out at once. Like 1-2 times a week maybe? Sunscreen: Etude House Sunprise or Purito Centella unscented. 
When this thing happens I use La Roche Posay Cicaplast to “treat” it and it usually helps. It only moves to cover the entire front of my neck this winter. I launder my everything in the Tide sensitive unscented but I use regular dryer sheets. I wear a polo to work. This routine has been in place before the last two flare ups. 
When this happened originally (patches about fist sized on the side of my neck) I used a steroid cream from my GP and it cleared right up. I used that until it expired 2 years ago. La Roche Posay has worked since then but this is getting ridiculous."

Nothing like pointing out the prostitutes and their little love-shacks I guess? Took me by surprise that’s for damn sure."
AskReddit,fc2g0fa,t1_fc2d74c,1577358109.0,Moral of both sides: people can really suck sometimes. My aunt (hearing) taught sign language/worked with deaf kids for 30 years. I was shocked at the amount of families that don’t learn ASL to better communicate with their kid. I was even more shocked when she talked about the blow back the deaf community gives some folks who elect to have implant surgery. She went to Gallaudet University for her masters over 35 years ago and the culture is just wild.
