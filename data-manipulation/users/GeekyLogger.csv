todayilearned,fekxgy9,t1_fekcifw,1579209621.0,Ok I see what you meant. Thought you meant overall. No his data is pretty spot on.
todayilearned,fekb2cq,t1_fej765u,1579196326.0,Yes. Nearly 3x as many.
todayilearned,feinou6,t1_fec6h31,1579142792.0,True. But if you define old growth as the original trees grown there since Jesus/God/Allah/Buddha/The Creator/Batman put them there then there is literally zero oldgrowth left on the planet. It’s one of the things that makes the argument so complicated. Done right a properly managed regen forest is just as healthy or even healthier than old growth.
todayilearned,feinczv,t1_fedsgxd,1579142572.0,Yup. In many areas we’re forced to put special guards on the young trees to stop 5e ungulates from eating them.
todayilearned,fein89u,t1_fecalv1,1579142483.0,"Read up on the history of the softwood lumber dispute and then watch “Over a Barrel.” (Be warned she’s very biased but her facts line up). This sort of dirty pool was even a problem and being brought up as early as 2009&2012 by Harper. 

It’s not a case of “good vs evil” but it’s not pretty either. Corperate funded activism is 5e new state sponsored terrorism. Basically it’s what China is doing but on a smaller scale."
forestry,feimwsv,t1_fecaoav,1579142268.0,"The big one I see is the drug and alcohol policy refusal. Every single other industry has shift work and a D&A policy. I can see wanting to have some control over shift work but the blantant refusal to consider anything is baffling. Brian’s ego and desire to go into politics on a win have destroyed thousands of livelihoods and numerous companies. The Union is suppose to be for the workers, not the ego and political agendas of the board members. No one can win at this point."
todayilearned,feimium,t1_fecbvb2,1579142009.0,Not quite. Most loggers here understand and want to protect our forests. They just want to use a renewable resource intelligently and without the back room interference of American corporations. It’s not a clear cut case of “good vs evil” unfortunately.
todayilearned,feim6zx,t1_fecg8yk,1579141790.0,Exactly. Even the American courts ruled that it wasn’t a subsidy (and we even sometime sare forced to pay above market rate) and that they had to pay the money back to Canada but of course it never happened
todayilearned,feim1fp,t1_fecvc2a,1579141687.0,Haha you guys are awesome. I was going to reply with info but others already beat me to it. It’s also not so much how many trees me replant but how we manage our regrowth. (Basically not at all). Do to our size we can get away with this. Many European countries actually have more technical policies but we get to cheat a little.
todayilearned,feilooc,t1_fecgrfv,1579141449.0,Depends on the location and biosphere. But yes fairly often hand fallers will be sent in to fall aspen/maple/alder to open up for the intended regrowth.
todayilearned,feilj0b,t1_fechpbz,1579141339.0,A bunch of universities changed it a little while back. As I said in the post it’s extrmely complicated trying to determine what constitues old growth. Adding the confusion in the last report was that they were trying to determine what percentage of the original stand must remain for it to still be considered old growth. Does selective logging change that? Windstorm damage? Fire? What type of regen? Etc... Basically it’s a giant headache that lets both sides play with the numbers.
todayilearned,feil5t0,t1_fechu51,1579141088.0,"That’d be an entire course worth of economic discussion. Basically? Cheap resources and eliminating competition. Read up on the softwood lumber disputes and it’ll key you into the last time corporate America took a swing at the Canadian lumber industry. It’s not “the evil American picking on poor mom and pop shops” it’s a group of rich assholes playing dirty pool to fuck over a group of slightly poorer and smaller assholes. Canadian corporate can’t match corporate America. 

Corperate backed activism is the new form of state sponsored terrorism."
todayilearned,feikh78,t1_fecjji4,1579140629.0,100% absolutely. I mean there are some really stupid and over the top policies/ideas biased upon identity politics/social pandering to the fickle masses but for the most part we have a good system.
todayilearned,feika1k,t1_fecm69m,1579140492.0,Exactly.  It every logging company went “oh no I better save the environment! I am gonna plant trees!” For even the evil companies it’s in their interest to take care of the forest. Healthy ecosystem=healthy trees=more money. However just like with hunters and conservation loggers on the individual scale tend to be extremely environmentally conscious.
todayilearned,feik0ch,t1_fecr1y9,1579140311.0,As I mentioned in another comment Finland actually has a more technical plan but Canada gets to cheat a little.
todayilearned,feijvd9,t1_fecwrne,1579140218.0,"In BC it’s 3 to 1. Most trees planted in many European countries are farmed trees. This naturally leaves a slightly less healthy ecosystem. Compared to many countries such as Finland, Swendan, Norway, etc Canadian practices are not nearly as technical but because we have such massive swaths of land available we can afford to let Mother Nature take over. Basically it comes comes down to geography. (From what we force natural resource companies to do right down to the regen stage)"
todayilearned,fecd0jj,t1_fec6y3i,1578971040.0,Thanks for phrasing it better than I did. Common problem of mine; I have the info but I either don't get it across properly or when I do I piss people off!  :)
todayilearned,fec8mhh,t1_fec89l9,1578968567.0,Ahahaha right? All in all it's just different methodologies.
Competitiveoverwatch,fec7pfc,t1_fec0tbd,1578968092.0,Also depends on player size and what airline they're on.
todayilearned,fec6ots,t1_fec5jpp,1578967563.0,"Like I said it's mostly just me being pedantic. Tree farms are really just giant plantations where trees are planted it perfectly straight rows, they are actively managed, pruned, thinned, taken care of.  It's all about efficiency and cycle time.  


In Canada we plant (usually by hand) and then pretty much let mother nature raise them naturally. Makes for a more healthy ecosystem. There's a LOT that actually goes into it (from species choice to site prep) but we don't actively work the regen as much as a farm"
todayilearned,fec6187,t1_fec46q1,1578967220.0,That sounds something like what Cinderella said when she got to the ball...
todayilearned,fec5t56,t1_febkf1q,1578967103.0,"Bullshit. That's tripe peddled by foreign funded lobby groups like the  Sierra Club.  


* 54% of BC Crown land is protected.
* Only about 30% of the Coastal Timber Base is actually available for harvest.
* Vancouver Island has roughly 39%-48% of it's old growth left. (Lobbyist groups like to fudge this number a lot). Of that amount 55% is flat out off limits. In addition to that much more of it will never been logged due to factors such as non-cost efficient, too steep, no access, left for public relations, visual retention, etc.
* There are several factors which determine what makes up ""old growth"" forest but the main one is that the stand much be 180 years of age.  (used to 250). This makes things really complicated when trying to figure out what's left. 
* Lobbyist groups like to forget about the entirety of the interior's old growth forest. This is mostly because there is a shit ton of it left but it doesn't look nearly as majestic and doesn't tug on heart strings or purse strings nearly as well as coastal old growth.
* The BC timber industry is under attack from foreign funded groups for exactly the same reason American oil companies fund the environmental groups that attack the Canadian oil industry.  


tl;dr  
It's  mostly bullshit and it's actually extremely complicated. It involves a lot of big money names and dirty pool. In short; it's not about saving anything it's about fucking people over so they can get richer."
todayilearned,fec0nbw,t1_febm7v7,1578964905.0,"Yes but no. To the average person that is 100% correct. By law we must plant more than we harvest. It's *INSANE* how good/extreme our forest policies are. We're easily years/miles ahead of everyone else. However. *Technically* we don't tree farm, we replant That's more something you'd see in Europe or South America. But I am just being extremely pedantic in a forestry way.
