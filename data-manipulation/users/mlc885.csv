todayilearned,fd8t2gc,t1_fd8o996,1578223071.0,"I'd say time is probably the largest factor, chain fast food places literally want to serve food more quickly than a sandwich shop could, even when they are very busy, and employ the minimum number of people with minimal training.  The thing they want to do is unrealistic and effectively requires prepackaged, mostly-assembled goods with long shelf lives, since otherwise you'd just be constantly making a massive amount of food to throw much of it away."

The parents were in the house! I can see why they'd do this, especially if their daughter invited the kid, but this is exactly why parents don't let their kids host potentially crazy parties.  If someone set the house on fire it would be silly to tell the daughter that she should have foreseen it, because if she should have foreseen it then they should have as well.  And they're the people with the life experience!

So it's a cheap way to try to teach her a lesson, but she's not going to learn much from it other than don't let your party get too big to fully supervise.  But someone could do this to an adult too, people are just much more likely to, like, steal from you than blow up your toilet with a firework."

Presumably if you were incredibly brilliant or lucky you would already have an amazing career, so the time you end up spending on this will (probably) not live up to what you actually deserve to be paid for what you produce.  The most likely outcome is that you make something beautiful that not enough people buy, though I guess you could argue that making the beautiful thing would still be an enormous success if *some* people bought it; we have all inherited books."

I assume this is a Melania joke, and it is cute, but there's really no reason for Ivanka to be there.  There is surely someone more qualified than her for whatever she was picked for, assuming it wasn't because someone is friends with Ivanka or to buddy up with Trump, so naturally people are going to be annoyed that she was chosen."
