Indiemakeupandmore,ffijrfe,t1_ffi30yt,1579975533.0,"My mom is in her 50s and has a phobia of dentists after an awful and traumatic experience with one as a kid. She needs a few teeth pulled, and while she mustered the courage to have a consultation a year and a half ago, she hasn’t been brave enough to go get the procedure, and she didn’t like the dentist she saw for the consult.

Good on you for being brave and going anyway. Teeth are really one of those things you don’t want to overlook the health of. My mom has been dealing with abscesses because hers are so bad, and I think it’s partly why she got so sick right after the consultation. It was pneumonia, but at the very least, I think her immune system was compromised. Hope this doesn’t scare you more... she already had infected teeth, though."

Idk how much you’re into tea, but if you ever wanna try a tea that naturally tastes like chocolate, the Laoshan black from Verdant Tea is my like... HG tea"
