FemaleDatingStrategy,ffxdr33,t1_ffwhp25,1580323069.0,Does saying that make you feel better about yourself?
FireEmblemHeroes,ffwyoej,t1_ffwdpr3,1580313978.0,If that Siegfried happens I would straight up drop everything and build Xander to +10 even though I deeply dislike him.
OrderOfHeroes,ffvs81h,t3_evhhi5,1580271772.0,"Yo I’m actually pretty hype for this but weirdly I may be rolling everything EXCEPT red. If I get a Lif or Girl Byleth, cool, but L!Ephraim merges, the possibility for DC fodder and my first Hilda, and Leif FINALLy coming home, red can wait."
FireEmblemHeroes,ffuw46w,t1_ffutjj5,1580250453.0,"I’m just wanting NY!Takumi merges (I’m at +3 since Y1 and I’d like to get him a couple more), but Fallen Takumi is fun! What’s your Leo build?"
FireEmblemHeroes,ffus47j,t1_ffr9hm6,1580248317.0,"That’s fair. Also nice Leo flair, I’m +10ing Picnic Leo myself"

FireEmblemHeroes,ffr1uei,t3_eukp2i,1580148615.0,Oh look it’s me. I just wanted one or two N.Y.!Takumi merges.
FireEmblemHeroes,ffr1q7l,t3_etarry,1580148542.0,"Is it too late to rally the Takumi gang? I don’t know if 19th is a good enough place to springboard to a win, but I do think If we band together we can see any version of him on banners.

FireEmblemHeroes,ffpai7a,t3_eu6gij,1580090220.0,"I can’t speak highly enough of Tailtiu, but lots of people have said that already, so I’m going to tell you about Setsuna. Setsuna doesn’t have a refine yet but she’s versatile. You can run her really tanky with Guard Bow, or you can throw something like Fishie Bow or Bouquet Bow on her to make her really fast. When she gets her refine that opens up more doors for her too. 

Caeda’s also really great because she’s cav and armor effective and gets flashing blade on her weapon, but for a flier +10 I can’t recommend Shigure highly enough. He also doesn’t have a refine but there are enough cool lances that he doesn’t really need one. He’s fast but also solid enough where he’s not going to die to everything. His own lance is great but Wagasa’s also really good. 

Roy gets QR5 on his weapon and between that, Distant Defense seal and something like Steady Breath, he’s almost unkillable in modes like Rokkr Sieges. I’m hoping one day a DC seal happens so I can see how that works for him, and I’m considering Rouse ATK/def on him when I get the spare Edelgard. 

I can go on all day."
FireEmblemHeroes,ffp9a4f,t1_ffltvs6,1580089372.0,"YES JOIN THE TAILTIU SQUAD. She’s the reason I have never once cared about Ophelia. I run her with Special Spiral and an AOE special and she’s the best unit ever. 

I’d also spend some feathers on OG Roy, especially if you have Steady Breath to spare. Mine is +10 and I LOVE HIM.

 I can show you my builds for them if you want"
FireEmblemHeroes,ffodf2c,t3_eu7v85,1580076561.0,"My boy Leo’s been on NINE banners? 

But then why can’t I get the +10 though"
relationship_advice,ffmb7f7,t1_ffk6ne6,1580051678.0,"Yeah I agree. 

On a personal note, last breakup was like seven years ago and as soon as it happened, he whipped out his phone and deleted all of the (admittedly very few) nudes I had ever sent him and had me watch as he did so. I was still of the mindset that eventually we’d get back together (thankfully we did not), so I was like dude it wasn’t that serious I trust you, and he was like “we’re not together anymore, no matter what happens in the future I can’t have these now.” 

That relationship was hella unhealthy for a lot of reasons but that was something he handled really well because it WAS that serious and at least he didn’t take advantage of my naïveté in THAT way."

EatCheapAndHealthy,ffj9l60,t1_ffitoi7,1579993646.0,"As a picky person who’s working on moving in with a bf who loves all food and knows how to cook it well, this is how you do it."
FireEmblemHeroes,fffxpfl,t1_fffvjwt,1579894082.0,"Yeah I was considering voting for her at least once, plus a vote for Seth for my bf who mains him. Lord knows If anyone needs a redemption alt that represents him in the games he comes from, it’s Silver Knight Seth."
IncelTears,fffko2u,t1_ffevt4z,1579886031.0,"I agree, that’s a really really new one."
FireEmblemHeroes,fff0dup,t1_ffewbxl,1579872168.0,I agree with you and tbh I hope she wins. My votes are all tied up with Takumi but I really do think the top 2 will be Edelgard and Eirika when it comes down to it.
