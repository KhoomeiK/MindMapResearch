uncharted,ffu3zga,t1_ffu1i1o,1580233994.0,"Personally, I'm against it for a few reasons:

1. I don't like the idea that movies are the end-all, be-all of entertainment. I think video games are still an underappreciated art form that isn't taken seriously, and games like Uncharted that go the extra mile in terms of acting and storytelling are more enjoyable for me than a lot of movies I've seen recently.
2. I have personally never seen a video game movie that did the game justice. I think this is mostly due to the fact that video game movies aren't actually made for fans of the game, they're made to catch the attention of people who haven't played the game, and likely won't. Because of that, the movies often come across as cash grabs made by people who don't actually care about the game/franchise, they just want money.
3. Unlike books, where every reader of a book can have different interpretations of characters, video game characters are often more established. When you factor in the fact that not only do Uncharted's actors provide their voices, but they're also entirely mocapped, I think it'd be difficult to find an actor that feels right. For me, no actor other than Nolan North is going to feel like Nathan Drake. Others might come close, but something is always going to be a little off.
4. Being able to be an active part of the story is a unique experience that movies can't replicate, and for me that interaction is a big part of why I enjoy games so much.

**TL;DR:** I think games still aren't taken seriously, most video game movies feel like cash grabs, and no matter how good of an actor you get for the part, they're always going to feel a little off."

Best of luck when you pick it back up again!"
writing,ffmzz02,t3_eu8e7w,1580060619.0,"As others have stated, it can be a stylistic choice. One that some people aren't going to like, and one that others won't mind. Writing rules can be pretty strict, and if people aren't willing to go outside them and experiment and play around a little, they'll likely feel pretty stifled at one point or another.

If you've got your own rules for them and you're using them consistently, by all means. But I think if you're using them because it feels easier than finding more effective ways to get your point across, or they're preventing you from learning and growing as a writer, then maybe consider challenging yourself to cut back. Don't be afraid to experiment in other ways, as well!

My #1 piece of advice to writers, beginners and more experienced alike, is to read a lot. Not just in one genre, and not just fiction. Reading is a huge part of the learning process when it comes to writing."

My experience was mostly the same as yours. I know you can get through some encounters entirely in stealth but I can't remember if I've ever managed to do it on crushing. I did the ""kill a few guys, go back into stealth"" approach and that got me through a lot of the tough fights. Good luck!"
uncharted,ffk3nyj,t3_etdi0j,1580014819.0,"Disclaimer that it was the opposite for me, I found U4 way easier on crushing and actually gave up halfway through my attempts at both U1 and U3 on crushing, so take this with a grain of salt, but: I found Lost Legacy on crushing the easiest of the series. As someone else says, stealth is utilized a bit more, so I'd say if you go that route, the encounters are a bit more tedious and time-consuming, but not necessarily difficult if you're patient."
uncharted,ffk33p5,t1_ffgi8x0,1580014321.0,"Yeah, that happened to me in U3 as well. Got stuck in a barrier of sorts when trying to get out of the cruise ship. I had to restart the section because there was no death animation or anything. Funny now but was really frustrating at the time."

Yeah, in the early part of the epilogue having cash is good, if only to buy food and stuff. I craft a lot, but I like having a full satchel of food I can easily access from the menu, plus horse revivers and such for Buell. That stuff adds up pretty quick when you've only got $10."

I spent all day yesterday and part of today building up the market area next to the yellow house, only to decide it was too much and I wanted something simpler, so the only differences between these is the market. It was still very much a WIP when I decided to reload a different save, but this is what I had:

* [Arial shot](https://i.imgur.com/5JoM4vc.png).
* [The view from the front gate](https://i.imgur.com/qSiKhyA.png).
* [Street view](https://i.imgur.com/CLsJXfp.png). Clinic is inside the garage. The bar is the hot spot. The market and gardens are past the archway.
* [Close up of the bar](https://i.imgur.com/YHJ2oZz.png). Pretty much the exact build in norespawn's video I linked, with a few very small changes.
* [The market](https://i.imgur.com/oBOG3ED.png): Vault Tech Rep's ""Junkers"" shop, the armor shop, and the weapon shop + motel. The initial plan was to put a caravan post in the back, next to the other blue house that overlooks the garden, but I haven't unlocked it yet.
* [I was going to decorate the area more](https://i.imgur.com/j1khVyc.png), put some armor displays out front and a suit of power armor in the little enclave between Junkers and Armory, but I didn't get that far.
* [Closer shot of The Bunker](https://i.imgur.com/XskKWSS.png), the gunshop + motel.
* [And the clinic waiting room](https://i.imgur.com/SxFA8Nk.png). The clinic itself is behind the wall, but there's nothing else there so no screenshot.

And the much more simple version:

* [Street view](https://i.imgur.com/cAOANyD.png). Nothing much different here but Carla and the fog.
* [And here's the market](https://i.imgur.com/Qt5Yu0Y.png). I prefer the simple approach as it makes for very easy shopping. I don't have a weapon vendor yet but when I do they'll be in the last shop.

The settlers live in the yellow workshop house, and I live in the SoSu's old house. They're very basic inside so I didn't take any screenshots, but if you want I can get some. And if you want, I got a video tour of the more ""complicated"" market that I can upload for you if you'd like, but there's not much to see since I didn't decorate the inside of the buildings."

RedDeadSinglePlayer,fd3nfbp,t3_ejxaj5,1578159973.0,"Haven't had that happen to me. I sometimes get different robbery tips from NPCs, or camp conversations I've never heard before, or I sometimes miss out on some gang member item requests for one reason or another, but that's about it. Have yet to trigger that cutscene with Mrs. Grimshaw forcing Arthur to bathe, though."

reddeadmysteries,fcxqrpm,t1_fcpaqc7,1578069207.0,"I've had Javier come find me because Bill was captured, yes. I think the closest to the hostage woman is there's one woman who will pretend she hurt her ankle on the side of the road, and if you get off your horse to help her she pulls a gun on you. Not many encounters like that, though."
reddeadredemption,fcl1b5e,t1_fckx3kd,1577737653.0,"I've heard mixed things about the ""changing your outfit/mask"" thing. As far as the lawmen go, though, I think they'd recognize Arthur even if he had a bag over his head."
