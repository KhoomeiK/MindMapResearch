Teachers,ff1gb6r,t1_ff118hx,1579478771.0,"What kind of students do you teach? Mastery grading is a great thing if you have students who care and are on a high level. Right now I am teaching “intervention” which is really mostly I-ready. I have okay buy in, there are great incentives going on both in my class and out. My biggest issue is that I’m told to keep them on grade level (rather than ‘their’ level, because what’s the point of intervention) and they are not meeting mastery. If I were mastery grading, my students would never have a chance to pass. Now, with my other classwork, I do have high numbers of students not turning in work. My question is, how do you determine if a student meets mastery if they do not do the assignment? If my boss says to prepare a presentation for the staff and if it’s good I’ll get a stipend, then I don’t do it, should I still get the money? A few of my students now, and many more from high school, won’t even write their name on the paper. Or a definition. In HS English I would literally give 50% for header, definition, my example, and partner work (which we went over as well - should be 100%), then grade for mastery on their ‘I do’. I had the same students consistently not do any of the easy points despite my telling them it was a grade, then MAYBE turn in half a sentence ‘answer’ (for ACE response - biggest tool I used). 
I guess what I’m trying to say is that you can’t grade for mastery unless your students are at a level they can reach it AND there is a high degree of buy in. I’m glad you’re able to."

gardening,fegfe8a,t1_fegavrq,1579090903.0,"Your explanation makes sense, but the original post doesn’t strike me as inherently sexist. The ‘typical’ view of a man is that he doesn’t empathize/care outside of a very narrow circle, and I see this as more of an empathetic gesture than a sexist one. Of course, that can be reinforced by my worldview; I have made several pieces of furniture myself, plus garden, paint, and bake. I don’t see woodworking as inherently male, and I would like to give OP the benefit of a doubt there too. I am a feminist, and there are a TON of things men still need in order to be equal - one is the expectation (rather than praise) of doing empathetic acts, or housework, caring for their own children, and emotion. I watched Hamlet the other night and basically all the characters were telling him to man up and stop having emotions. That’s unacceptable. One of the ways we fix it is by calling out societal problems and discussing them. So, you feel ‘less than” because you don’t have woodworking skills? Or feel like this post is saying that?"
