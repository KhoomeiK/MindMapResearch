leagueoflegends,ffly4h2,t3_eu5uu8,1580045567.0,"As someone who was pretty good in csgo and ow I think league is a bit different although the same points that the op has mentioned definitely applies. The primary difference is 'getting a lead'. Since mobas are won or lost based off of gold they are a bit harder to solo carry in comparison to csgo or destiny 2 (crucible not Gambit but yeah fck the drifter) . The only fps I can say is as team dependent is ow. 

Regardless though whatever is mentioned makes sense to me."
leagueoflegends,fflgtng,t1_ffkwi33,1580039558.0,I think tryndamere is one of those champions who needs a small rework. He can be irritating at times because of random crits but I guess his trading pattern is simpler to compensate for the fact that his dmg is inconsistent and random at times.

If he walks up to you to engage and you aren't a slow immobile tank with no gap closer or slow or anything to kite him with then I don't know what you are doing. 

Imo his w is perfectly fine. His ult aoe range should be  clearer and that's all. Maybe I am have been playing against garbage setts cuz I ain't really challenger material like most of Reddit but at least in high plat I haven't faced any sett where I felt like his w was nerf worthy."

destiny2,ff9oaim,t1_ff913k2,1579717169.0,"Why not. Stats speak for themselves. It's still one of the top two or three most played games and also winning the twitch race against a giant like fortnight. It's also literally the face of esports (altho csgo and DotA are big contributors too). 

The most toxic game I have played is ow. 

The most toxic person I have met is someone in Warframe. 

League being the most toxic is just a meme. Toxicity is prevalent in all online games, forums and other forms of social media. 

I have had friends who quit playing DotA because of toxicity. 

As someone who has been playing league for over 5 years now among many other online games like csgo , ow , Warframe , d2, cs1.6, call of duty etc I can assure anyone , if it's a competitive game toxicity is bound to happen, it's a result of people being over competitive. 

I have encountered absolute assholes on Reddit and other social media so do I tell my peers to not use them ? 

The internet is a breeding ground for toxicity it has little to 0 in connection with league in particular. Pvp games are in general just more toxic than pve games because of competitiveness. 


Ps - just someone who is tired of the ""oh but league is the most toxic game ever"" argument. If it were that bad no one would be playing it. 


FYI a personal observation valid for every pvp game I have played  especially ow - It's always the vocal minority often the toxic people themselves who complain about toxicity while justifying their own offenses as ""I was defending myself"" or ""I was trying to stop someone from being toxic""."

Real katanas I mean with the edge capable of splitting a falling strand of hair. Even 'real' knock offs which are sharp and have the same ish weight etc are costly I think. Do tell me if your dad can get his hands on one. I'll probably do anything to get it too. It will help keep me company on my lonely path.

If he used his q to farm then go on him get two or three quick vitals and then back off. Bone plating is preferred in this lane matchup for anyone who is having trouble. Try to get short trades . Make sure you play your ult in such a way that you get to keep the healing even after he ults you. Aka don't proc it too soon if you think it's going to be a drawn out fight. It's a bit diff to explain in words but like unless you have your items or you are severely ahead , make sure you keep the heal in the death realm or his base damage will eventually kill you because of his passive and conqueror."

I am working currently and I'll probably head abroad for my masters. I don't think anyone is really going to remember me or even call me as a matter of fact. It's always me trying to be the one to keep the threads connected but I can only do so much. There comes a point where even people you adore be it a girl you love or a friend you adore or a buddy who is like your own sibling eventually drift away because they aren't obligated to feel the same about you, which in my case is very true. 

I guess life can be summed up by saying that it's a journey where you face hardships, meet new people and finally overcome those hardships to realize whether the journey was worth. For many people if not most it is, for me it's actually the contrary. I hope my take on life changes as I grow up even more but something tells me it won't.

You lose out on tower damage but it's not a big deal because the raw AD from manamune combined with your demolish is enough to chunk some plates. 

I always go legend alacrity. Attack speed is good while taking towers , attack speed also makes fiora more fluid to play because more autos = faster vital procs.
