1. dog is 100% of the time on leash attached to you or in a crate.

2. dog goes outside when he wakes up, after he eats, before bed , when he shows body language of needing to potty.

3. outside is for potty first, he goes out on leash and you stand in one spot until he potties. After he potties he can have off leash play time.

4. If he does not potty in 5 minutes, take him inside and crate for 30 minutes and try again, repeate until he potties.

5. Loads of exercise, lots of long on leash walks, don't allow him to potty wherever. Pick 3 spots on your 3x daily walks where he is allowed to potty, once at the start, once at the middle and once at the end. If he tries to potty elsewhere hurry to the nearest potty spot and praise him.
