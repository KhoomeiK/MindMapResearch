todayilearned,ff2ckcb,t1_ff1k29t,1579500749.0,"Reddit had convinced me to hate him but then I started to regularly listen to his podcast. I agree that his style can seem pompous, but I think that's not because he's arrogant, rather that he's genuinely amazed at the universe/space and the privilege he has to talk about it for a living. I would rather have someone who sincerely admires what they're talking about than a dull science communicator. 

And I know he gets a lot of hate for pointing out science errors in movies (not sure if he still does this?), but if you put yourself in his shoes he's literally studied this stuff his entire life and science mistakes would be a lot more apparent/interesting to him. It doesn't diminish the movie in any way to have science errors since a movie isn't expected to be an educational documentary, but for many people it's entertaining to see these flaws. It's very understandable if this isn't your cup of tea, just don't follow him on twitter."
