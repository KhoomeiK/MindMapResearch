ABraThatFits,ff7yn03,t1_ff7nv3l,1579661486.0,weird. i’ve been a loyal buyer of theirs and recommended a number of others to the brand with no issues. sorry it didn’t work out for you.
nonmonogamy,ff3nz46,t1_ff3dg2j,1579545123.0,"then you talk about those boundaries and why they’re there and come to a different agreement if possible. you don’t just disregard them because it’s too hard. that’s shitty non-monogamy. how easy or hard it is for one party or the other to find partners doesn’t negate tempe fact that ethical non-monogamy means being respectful of your partner(s) and not lying / breaking boundaries because it’s easier in the moment so you can get yours. 

sorry, can’t excuse this guy for any of it. you don’t trample boundaries, you discuss them and honor them."

xxfitness,feekfz7,t1_fedppt9,1579035555.0,"0-2 miles is my major hurdle. sometimes it eases by 1.5 miles, but especially that first mile i’m doing a steady stream of trying to talk myself into going back home, no matter how much i enjoy running or how long i’ve been doing it."
xxfitness,feek7sr,t1_fedob5p,1579035426.0,"if i’m running with someone - as slow as it takes to hold a regular conversation.

if i’m running alone, i make sure periodically that i can sing along with the lyrics / repeat a couple of lines of a podcast. 

the best way to increase distance is to decrease speed. over time, your short runs will get faster, then your longer runs will, and your longest runs will always be the slowest."
corgi,fecqns1,t1_fea9osu,1578981054.0,"i remember being in my pjs, taking my corgi out for her last bathroom of the night, and (i live above a bar) we walked by a table of very drunk girls outside and i hear the squeal - turn into many - and the key words “cute” and “corgi”.  if there’s one thing my girl has, it’s a keenly tuned ear for the specific range of squeals that come from 20-something year old women, who she knows will fawn over her like she deserves. she immediately plants as i’m trying to hustle past, and pulls me with all 28 yearning-to-be-adored pounds of corgi might and drug me back to the table of drunk women. where i then had to make awkward conversation about my dog to a group that was many cocktails in. She was, of course, in dog heaven."
