Flute,fetx0mq,t1_fetswul,1579380922.0,"That’s great to hear, my gemmy has been great. I get compliments on it all the time from techs. I’ve had it though for about 13 years and the pic, which I’ve only owned for a little over a year, was made around the same time.

I’m saving for a step up though. Hoping to test play some other brands. Miramatsu, Sankyo, Powell, Haynes."
Flute,fes7mnb,t1_fes5mla,1579362201.0,Yes and these particular models were made before they started cutting corners. Haha I hear they’re getting better though the past year or two.
Flute,fepfbrs,t1_fepdmmk,1579319082.0,No problem.
Flute,fep9fad,t1_fep8g2q,1579315106.0,"It’s a LeFreque sound bridge. It’s supposed to help stable the vibrations. You should do some research on them.

They don’t make you sound better, like they claim, but to augment your sound. I use it sometimes depending on the music we’re playing and the tone color I’m going for...I mostly just use it as a tool to manipulate my tone.

I also find it strengthens my lower register."
Flute,fep95om,t1_fep4hlo,1579314932.0,"Haha, I understand. There is a niche for everyone and it’s good to know your limits and desires.

I wouldn’t say I have a favorite register necessarily. It’s all about the emotions and story I can get across with my playing. If the high notes are needed for certain emotions that’s what I’ll go after, but if low notes are needed that’s the way I’ll go. My focus has been on tone quality and color as a result."
Flute,fep2s0h,t1_feoyyht,1579310848.0,"Yeah, if you’re interested in playing piccolo a lot I would recommend getting one that is mostly or all composite/wooden.

Mine gets the job done, but I also play in a very large local concert band, so having a little more volume and brightness is not bad. It wouldn’t be the ideal instrument for an orchestra or smaller band, but would work.

I mostly bought it to have something in case I was called on to play piccolo, as my 1st one was not worth fixing, and found it at a great deal on Facebook marketplace. It was only played for one year and the girl decided she didn’t like it and it sat for a handful of years. Her mother sold it so it wouldn’t just become a paper weight. Haha

I would love an alto and almost bought one, but I passed. My savings goal for my new flute right now is $12,000 so I’m trying to be diligent with my savings. It can be hard though when you have a 1 and 3 year old...haha. My son is very excited I’m getting to play my “little flute.”"
Flute,feoyrpx,t1_feoy954,1579308318.0,"Yeah, mine is solid silver, which is quite common, but what you’re describing is very common too. I think you’re used to seeing piccolos with metal head joints and composite/wood body.

My solid silver is a little louder and brighter than the one you describe and the full wood/composite. I would love to purchase a wooden one, but I’m saving for a better flute at the moment."

Flute,fen89um,t1_fen6x3c,1579279145.0,"I do like my LeFreque. I pick and choose when I use it depending on the music. I know there is a lot of differing opinions on them, but I mostly use mine to manipulate tone color and to occasionally strengthen my lower register (again depending on individual song)."

Flute,fdhgufo,t1_fdhb7rs,1578422359.0,"That’s really cool...I love looking, but can’t wait to purchase and play my new find. I’ve been looking for an alto because I really want one and we need more low flutes in the flute choir I’m involved with."
Flute,fdh1fw8,t3_ekp5mt,1578413301.0,"The best thing I can tell you is to ignore your reservations about the upper register. Even playing the high notes as quietly as you can they will still be louder than you think they should. It is the nature of this instrument. That is why, among other reasons like tuning, there is rarely more than one piccolo player per group/song.

The advise I received was to be aware of dynamics, but not to stress to much because if you are to loud the director will let you know. If you don't put enough air through the instrument your high notes will not sound, may crack or be severely out of tune.

Another thing you have to remember about the flute and piccolo is dynamically they are naturally louder in the higher octaves than the lower ones. It is just a characteristic of the instruments."
pokemon,fddzp8i,t1_fddx7nv,1578327863.0,"Yep, the only reason I noticed is because I played halfway through and was not feeling like half my team, so I made some rearrangements and as I’m looking at stats I’m wondering to myself, why are all these mons so slow, even ones you would think would make sense to be a little faster. Weird.... there are some fast ones, but there just seems to be a lot with lower speed stat. There are some heavy hitters though, so maybe it’s a balancing thing?"
pokemon,fddut49,t1_fddrsgt,1578324509.0,I feel gen 8 is similar. As I’ve been playing through I’ve notice many of the new Pokémon have slower speeds.

StarWars,fd3l0br,t1_fd2fozi,1578159294.0,"People hated it because it did little to add to the overall story and was basically a long car chase. That said, I’m not saying there were not some great things about the movie itself. 

I felt this new trilogy as a whole shrunk the Star Wars galaxy. It didn’t feel as big as the previous movies and animated series made us feel. ROS made the galaxy feel much bigger than the the previous two movies to me with all the places they visited. This is just how I feel and I haven’t heard anyone mention this. This is one reason I appreciated the prequels, Star Wars The Clone Wars and Star Ward Rebels so much."
StarWars,fd3jex4,t1_fd3e4tj,1578158908.0,The Mandalorian has been fantastic. One of the best things to happen to Star Wars. Let’s just hope it keeps up with the hype.
StarWars,fd3ixfn,t3_ejwu18,1578158763.0,"By itself it’s not super terrible, but when viewed within the whole trilogy it’s quite awful. To me there’s really no point to the movie. The only things I felt like we needed from the movie was Luke training Rey,  Kylo killing Snoke and Rey/Kylo’s weird force connection. Other than that nothing else was really necessary for the overall story.

The visuals were completely awesome. The salt planet in the end is one of my favorite battle scenes. The contrasting colors of white and red were just so fantastic. That’s about all the movie did for me though. Haha

That’s just my opinion though and I’m really cool with other people liking it. I’m glad you enjoyed the movie."
todayilearned,fd34cxs,t1_fd31tcs,1578154656.0,"Right, he definitely made comments in a derogatory way. Nothing to bad or worth reporting, but it just seemed to amuse him. He is from an older generation and had 1 child so is ex-wife probably did all the work while he focused on career."

He has made several comments. I finally just told him if it keeps her from crying I’m all in and he actually accepted that. In reality I just like carrying my children and the carrier is really convenient.

The current team is Thwackey, Centiscorch, Corvisquire (these 3 are permanent members), Koffing, Boltund and Barraskewda. I will probably replace koffing with impidimp and Boltund with Toxel....I’m not super impressed with Barraskewda though and at the moment thinking of replacing it with Dracovish.
