The Switch keeps track of the difference between these two clocks. This is done so that if you alter the time the Switch knows and will disable any time based events in games (things that reset every 24 hours for example. Seen a lot in Pokémon and Animal Crossing). When you restored the changeable clock was also restored but not the hidden internal one.

Eventually you’ll beat the last boss, craft all the weapons and armor, enchant everything to its max level and upgrade your shop and the town to its limits at which point there’s no real reason to play anymore. It’s not a never ending game with randomized weapons or armors or anything like that and it’s not getting continuous updates for more content like Diablo or Warframe. So while I feel it’s a good game, keep in mind you can ‘beat’ it."
NintendoSwitch,ff7qd2d,t3_er98ys,1579655800.0,"This is because at the time you got your Switch there wasn’t a true Hong Kong eShop. You had to buy game codes and then redeem those codes.

Now that there’s an official shop they don’t want you using an out of region one.

NintendoSwitch,fdtf3fl,t3_emydyh,1578715851.0,"You said you enjoyed the Pokémon games. Imagine Digimon as like Pokémon but every time you evolved your Pokémon they’d start back over at level 1. And instead of 3 forms maximum, your Pokémon could have up to 6. And instead of a party of 6 it’s a party of 11. And sometimes you de-evolve them back to an earlier stage (again having the level reset to 1). 

That’s Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth. The only saving grace to protect you from the constant leveling you’ll be doing is that all members of the party get experience after battle which makes leveling low level Digimon fairly quick but also there’s a farm where you can leave a bunch of Digimon (like 30) to level up on their own while you play. And on the Switch version specifically, the farm Digimon will continue to level while the Switch is in sleep mode. 

If the part of JRPGs that you don’t like is all the level grinding then I can’t really recommend Digimon. While gaining levels does get a lot faster towards the end of the game that initial 1/3rd is gonna be torture for someone who doesn’t enjoy grinding."
