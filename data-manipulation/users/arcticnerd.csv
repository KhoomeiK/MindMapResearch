gaming,fepnung,t1_fepnmxt,1579325547.0,That's where I got my personal one! I don't need any fancy Fluke  meter for what I do at home.
news,fepnrbt,t1_fepjj3i,1579325467.0,"Yeah, I guess... I have a cousin that did five years in the federal pen. (meth, undercover FBI, all that shit). He was just about 5 feet tall and 120 lbs soaking wet. When he got out, he had buddied-up with the Arayan Brotherhood and was such a piece of garbage. Ghosted that dude years ago and never looked back."
gaming,feph4oh,t1_fepgp3w,1579320359.0,"Very cool. I was Network administrator for a medical facility for years. I miss that job. 
Non-sequitur; I learned the value of understanding electricity when I was in Auto-shop in high school. When working on an engine, it is inadvisable to lean over the engine placing one hand on the coil, and the other on the distributor cap,(unknowingly) and yelling ""OK Turn it over!"" Lets just say that grease and dirt are mighty good conductors of electricity."

Also, I remember the Duracell batteries that had the little meter on the side. For some reason I thought they still made those."

gaming,fep4gul,t1_feozqot,1579311925.0,"My SKS had a 50 round magazine, but you could still load it with stripper clips as well, if the mag was empty.  I used to also have the internal mag that flipped down on a swivel, but those didn't hold many rounds (10 IIRC)."

Damnthatsinteresting,fei0m6c,t3_ep6fki,1579127696.0,"My thoughts after seeing this;

1. Why no Flotation device on the deck during a storm? 
2. Why Camouflage? In a storm, If you get washed overboard, You want to be as visible as possible. That's why Survival suits  are bright orange! 
3. A storm is a storm, with waves that high, it's not difficult to become lost from sight."
