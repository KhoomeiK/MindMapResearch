offmychest,fgu011r,t1_fgtzm64,1581111563.0,Yes I have. I have been intermittent fasting and only allowing myself to have breakfast and lunch.

college,fg7p62q,t3_exbi6r,1580597984.0,"Is it one of the best schools in the nation. It’s quite hard for both in-state and out-of-state students to get in. You can’t really compare it to NYU or Tufts. UVA is a traditional college with greek life, sports, and a very competitive academic environment."
ChoosingBeggars,ffvmx87,t3_evd0ib,1580267907.0,Congrats pal
vcu,febnxbp,t1_febjs1u,1578960868.0,Very pale as in a lot of white people are in Greek life?
vcu,febdgfp,t1_febaazu,1578957682.0,"Haha, I was actually looking for the opposite of a full greek life experience. I guess VCU's greek life scene is perfect for me then."
vcu,febdb47,t1_feb9bux,1578957632.0,Rapists? Can you explain more?
IAmA,feb945e,t3_eo51wv,1578956549.0,"Hi Mr Guo Gu! My whole family claim to be Buddhists, but aren’t really involved with practicing Buddhist beliefs. I’m trying to do more research on Buddhism and hopefully devote more of my time into the religion. What are some of the basic beliefs of buddhism and practices?"
vcu,feb3v3t,t3_envuw7,1578955200.0,"I would try to increase your GPA a little bit this year... 2.1 GPA is below average for VCU and so is a 900 SAT. I would recommend retaking the SAT, try to increase your GPA, and write a bomb ass essay. Good luck!"
scholarships,feb1wxz,t3_eob93h,1578954694.0,"There are so many scholarships that don’t require you to be a certain race. Don’t lie about being a minority, that will just make you look bad. All you need to do is to prove that you can’t afford college by sending your FAFSA SAR or CSS report. No need to lie, it’s unethical."
suggestmeabook,fe5lbwn,t1_fdzyriy,1578870932.0,Thank you for the suggestions. Who wrote The Symposium?
vcu,fdh6m05,t3_eldqnr,1578416496.0,Try keeping a planner and set times to go to the library or a coffee shop to study. Create a study group with people in your classes.
