DunderMifflin,ffgzo39,t1_ffgxsql,1579919205.0,"Jim and Pams relationship was basic bitch/plain Jane fantasy. Every dumpy, mediocre, and charmless girl in the Midwest can pretend that they are Pam and that they’ll get their Jim eventually because he sees her for the beauty she has inside or some shit. 

In the real world, Jim stays with Karen. She’s attractive, smart, funny, creative, and can not only keep up with pranks, but come up with her own. She’s a true match. But this romance isn’t written for the aspiring young Jims out there. It’s for the Pams: the exact kind of girl who uses her love of The Office as an excuse for a personality. 

So crack open another Haagen Dazs, ladies. Load up s1e1 again and watch a talented hopeful man get inexplicably held back by a human roll of discount gift wrap. Your Jim is coming for you someday."

Uto-Aztecan has ~30 branches and the distance between the Hopi reservation and Mexico City is like 1500 miles. 

I know what you mean about language families not necessarily signifying cultural homogeneity, but I think the example you brought up is extreme.

It’s easy to categorize and compartmentalize Native Americans, but modern borders aren’t that old. Mexican ethnic heritage is very much intertwined with what we consider Native American, especially in the West. 

So, yes, it’s easy to imagine this hairstyle jumping from Hopi to Aztec to Mexican revolutionary."

coolguides,ffafupc,t1_ffa4mi5,1579734767.0,"Espresso refers to the method of extraction. You can use any roasted bean, ground fine, and brewed under typically 9 bar water pressure. BAR is barometric pressure at sea level. This puts the *press* in es*press*o. 

There is no espresso roast. Typically, the beans used for espresso are a dedicated mix of various origins and roasts to make a flavor cocktail according to the roaster’s taste. 

The difference in caffeine is only slightly affected by the roasting process, and greatly affected by the brewing process. 


More time brewing=more caffeine 


Finer grind=more caffeine. 


Higher temps=more caffeine


More beans=more caffeine



So, while brewing espresso only takes half a minute, the grind is fine enough to extract as much caffeine from a smaller amount of beans in a double shot as eight ounces of drip coffee, which is ground much coarser and brewed for longer. 

Cold brew is ground incredibly coarse and brewed in room temperature water, but it’s left overnight. It yields a concentrate because of the time. Turkish is ground fine and brewed quickly at high heat. It’s very strong. 

I hope this all makes sense.

Anyway:
I’ve spent this whole time reading some more and it turns out, like most everything, this whole issue is way murkier and more complicated than simply throwing numbers around. 






[This](https://www.genderhq.org/trans-youth-suicide-statistics-kill-themselves-manipulate-parents) incredibly long and detailed write up basically goes through both the long list of studies reviewed by Cornell that I posted and the NTDS and Pediatrics I mentioned before. It kind of looks at everything and:






I am going to have to stand corrected my dude. 






I can’t with any certainty say that post transition suicidality is reduced to that of the general pop. I can say with *some* confidence that the newest medical/surgical transitioning procedures are seemingly increasing the quality of life for these people *lately*. Turns out a lot of them start depressed and then maybe they give the trans thing a whirl. And it kind of works for most of them for now. 





One thing that this reddit debate and subsequent reading has definitely taught me, though, is that spouting off suicide figures is scaring parents into putting their adolescent children into a treatment that they don’t need and are too young to know if they want. 
So I’m not going to be bringing that up around any busybody moms groups. 





Good times. 





On a more personal note, I’ve gotten along great with the handful of FtM’s that I’ve met, but the MtF’s have been shrill, annoying, and make me want to kill myself."
ImGoingToHellForThis,femiznm,t1_femhp4t,1579258020.0,"It is not absurd to provide a long list of studies on the subject if you were truly motivated. But I understand being reluctant to drudge through dry scholarly shit. Especially when you’re already strongly convinced against it. 

I spent the last hour or so since your (hilarious) screaming rant reading the NTDS and the AAP reports from which the 40% suicide attempt figure comes from. Unfortunately neither of those surveys differentiated between pre and post transitions and, in fact, relied on the single question “Have you ever tried to kill yourself? Y/N?” 

Despite the simplicity of the questionnaire, it’s still compelling stuff. NTDS saw higher  attempts among the MtF as anyone would’ve expected. But the AAP saw it among the FtMs. 

Anyway I’ll screenshot one or two of those PDFs so you can see what I’m talking about."

That way of thinking gets corrected as you mature and develop."
