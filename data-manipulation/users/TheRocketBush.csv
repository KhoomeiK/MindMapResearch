It would mean that the rank is specific among a single group of them, though, so they'd need to be able to defend themselves well to be able to stay alive longer and make sure that ""ranking up"" with them is worth it. Maybe each group of Piglins has different characteristics that make them unique, adding to the whole ""piglins feel like real, living creatures"" thing.

I thought it would be funny because there's pretty much no need to mod one, and it's just kind of silly to have your drum modified for no reason.

The phantom was added to get people to sleep more often. It was designed to be difficult, and the best way to avoid them is sleeping. You can kill them, but they do keep coming back. They weren't made to be just another mob you fight during nighttime, though I guess it is *possible* to play the game with them. I don't think it's fun to fight them every night, though, and games are supposed to be fun.

The game does still have some challenging aspects, you're right, but in my opinion, not really enough. But like I said about u/you_got_fragged's idea, a new diffucutly system would make sure that everyone is happy, as my opinion is not that of everyone else's, of course.

Also, if there is a VERY low amount of challenge even when I'm better at the game these days, that doesn't mean it's a GOOD thing. Challenge is fun, and it shouldn't be exclusive to new players! Are you so afraid that this game might have even the SLIGHTEST thing wrong with it?! In a way, this entire subreddit is all about criticism. We suggest things that improve the game.
