It was a joke, but the fact communism is still disturbing to you shows me a lack of intellectual flexibility. Of course there are serious flaws in Marxism and it’s implementations, but the ideals of a just society are beautiful, and the insistence on perpetual extreme competition seems unsustainable, and likely to continue to fail until universal governance becomes necessary, or private entities become completely autonomous. Who knows, neither of us, and I’m not seriously promoting an ideology. I was making a joke to someone about depression, only an ideologue would make it all about their own ideology and try to make me feel bad.
