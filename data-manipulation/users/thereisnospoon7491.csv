But her life isnâ€™t together. She refuses to work a normal job. Requires others to support her. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s laziness or a severe anxiety being around people she doesnâ€™t know (which she claims she has). 

Iâ€™ve pretty much realized I could never build a full life with her because I donâ€™t have the resources to support us both on my own."

badwomensanatomy,fdfs2vl,t1_fddr2l8,1578368818.0,"May I ask you, because my girlfriend has endo and has strongly considered having a hysto - by she worries it will affect her libido. 

Sheâ€™s not a super physical person as it is (due to the pain) and my own libido is higher. Itâ€™s never been a problem for me but she often feels embarrassed and says she feels like she canâ€™t â€˜keep up her end of the relationshipâ€™ which Iâ€™ve told her so many times is absurd.  Sheâ€™s said she worries that if she has a hysto then she might not want to be physical even more. It seems to cause her a lot of distress."
