AskReddit,fgicsl7,t3_eyov66,1580817072.0,"I had a ""friend"" who was an amazing drawer and artist. Was quite smart and had expectations from his family to do well in school. I was his ""art friend"" because we knew each other and we were kinda friends. He was quite toxic, as he insulted my art peices but put it under a 'joke' and he liked to insult me in front of other people sometimes. I knew he must have not got much attention from his family or had some underlying issues so I never took it to heart. He was an interesting person but I moved schools and we don't really talk anymore. It was very interesting because if I didn't show up for art he would start frantically messaging me. I hope you find better friends OP!"
