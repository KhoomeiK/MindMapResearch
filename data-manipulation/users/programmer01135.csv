Your answer is yes, via one of two different routes: 

One, you set up port forwarding and the domain is accessible on the external IP of one of the branch's internet connection. This does require a static IP address (dynamic IP addresses have a very bad habit of changing when you least need them to, and dynamic DNS update services aren't always reliable), so you'd potentially need this to be provided by the ISP.

The other route is via a VPN connection, where the three branches are interconnected and have a private addressable space to allow communication across the VPN.

For the reselling business, you need to gather the following:
* Gross income. Hopefully you have a list of sales somewhere or can recompile it. 
* Expenses. These will be broken down by the following:
  * Materials/Supplies. Since you are a reseller, this will probably be a pretty big category. 
  * Postage / Advertising (if any)
  * Office expenses. Paper, ink, packing supplies, etc. 
  * Professional expenses. These would be things like fees for websites you use to sell your goods etc. Also your account and tax professional (or tax software) goes here. 
  * Utilities. Phone, internet etc.
  * Bank fees. This also includes fees paid to PayPal for their cut of transactions. 
  * Miscellaneous. Anything you spend on other business related stuff *and have receipts for*
