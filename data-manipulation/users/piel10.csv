Very gung ho about fat positivity, kept saying you can be healthy & fat, and that she was just heavy because of PCOS. 

Well, Livimg with her and watching her eat subway, chinese food, and pizza along with soft drinks nearly daily made me see otherwise. From those habits she became broke and became one of those ""it's the systems fault i can't get ahead oh my anxiety uWu"""

facepalm,fezeuuk,t1_feys7rt,1579456591.0,Had a friend who was a Mercedes service advisor. He said the cars are generally trash and the owners are mostly stupid
facepalm,fezefua,t1_fewc73b,1579456507.0,"I did once and some old lady complained at me. I told her I'm in the lines and shrugged, she pitched a fit about how her husband drives a big vehicle and can't help parking offset.

It was an f150, which easily fits in most parking spaces."
facepalm,feze5vh,t3_eqm32w,1579456433.0,"You're not even the person this happened to.

It was some German lady. She ended up telling the guy to either suck in his gut or learn to park in the lines. The guy said lines don't matter - from there i dunno what happened."

insaneparents,fel9ky9,t1_fejsyb5,1579217050.0,"I had a friend who did this to his sons PS4

HOWEVER Fortnite was causing behavior issues (which i believe, I saw that in my own ex gf). It hit an apex when his son raged during a game and lobbed his controller through his bedroom window. Buddy wasn't having none of it anymore

Though if you ask me he wasted $400"
insaneparents,feip4mr,t1_feioo2z,1579143746.0,"And those are legitimate diseases that need medical treatment, not more drugs to feel not-sick. An addiction is a dependency. Your body and mind YEARN for it.

If you get aids, your body just slowly dies without medical treatment. If you rail hydros (as I've done), you want more & have shakes, cold sweats etc  but it ain't gonna kill you - and if it does..well...loop back to my dependency point.

Can you ween yourself off aids, cancer, leprosy?"
insaneparents,feinch9,t1_feih9ch,1579142562.0,"Lol ""disease"" that's acquired by intention and is curable

Take accountability for your shit. My uncle and grandma were both crack addicts, shit one of my uncle's just died from heroin 2 days before my last birthday and i still have this mindset."

1) it's your computer, and it was yours before the relationship. You aren't selfish for this whatsoever. I work in the tech industry and I've seen kids RUIN computers, phones etc by simply downloading *shit*
2) he has an Xbox that you were generous enough to buy him. Do Roblox and Fortnite have kB/m controls for consoles now? If so buy a keyboard and mouse from dollar tree

If he really really wants a computer, i recommend sitting him down and teaching him about saving/investing for his own rig. My family did that when I was little, and I saved and saved to buy my first PC when i was 13"

Picked up my shoes, opened the door, threw em out and said ""get the fuck outta my house"".

I walked 30 mins to my dad's house, then punished my mom by essentially refusing to go to her house for a year. My advice is to make it backfire on the parent as much as possible so they know what they're doing is wrong, regardless of intention."
