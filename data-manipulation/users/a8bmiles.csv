We were talking about the representation of the residents of DC, or lack thereof. Not the representation of the poor, black people of DC.  In any case, since we're suddenly talking about race and poverty now...

DC is majority black at 49%, though a little behind the 62.5% of Baltimore.  There's also no real middle class in DC, it's pretty much rich people connected to politics, and poor people.  The black residents of DC are overwhelmingly in the category of ""and poor people"", but so are the white residents.

In DC, 17.4% of the population live below the poverty line in, compared to 24% in Baltimore. The ""...poor, black city..."" moniker you've selected could easily be applied to DC as well.

And while we're on the topic of...

Why does a resident of Wyoming's vote for Senate carry nearly 66x as much weight as a resident of California's?  Why is the House of Representatives locked at 435 representatives (set in 1911) instead of adjusting for population growth?

Not only do poorer, more rural, more republican (in general) states receive more representation in the Senate, they also receive unequal representation in the House due to ALSO not giving enough seats to the more populous states.

So I just compared CPU-Z stress test to Intel Burn Test, and got higher temps on IBT.

Temp on CPU while doing nothing is 25-26 C.

Peak temp on CPU-Z of 69 C, compared to peak temps on IBT of 72 C. I wonder if the difference is your 2 x 6-core vs my 1 x 8-core?

This is in a Corsair Carbide 500R case, which has a mesh side with a 200mm fan on it, and 5 more 120mm fans in it.

In any case, my Prism results were terrible in comparison, hitting 95-100 C on IBT. Out of curiosity, did you use the thermal application that came pre-applied with the fan? Or did you clean it off and use some other thermal paste?

If I had gotten pretty comparable results out of the Prism, I would be calling it awesome as well. So some other factor seems to be at play here.

> The game can be extremely taxing, it just doesn't scale well with core count past 2+ and not at all past 5-6 threads. 

Of course it will be extremely taxing if the game engine fails to utilize the majority of the resources (cores and threads) available on a modern system.  WoW's developers likely guessed, like everybody else did in 2002-2004, that frequency would continue to skyrocket and we'd still be on a single core with 2 threads, they guessed wrong (like everybody else did) and the struggling performance of the game showcases it's 15-20 year old code base.

Your example is like comparing two automobiles, one with 6 gears and one with 2 gears, and then stating that driving at high speeds is extremely taxing because the second vehicle doesn't scale well past 2nd gear; however, the vehicle can take full advantage of as many lanes of highway you throw at it.
