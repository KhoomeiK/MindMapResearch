Money,ffi0r03,t1_fff3jc3,1579961566.0,"I dont really get that far. If they ask how much something was, I say ""it was enough"". And if they pry, I ask why it matters. My mom used to pull the ""well I was looking to get that, so I just want to see how much they go for."" Which was a lie. And I would say, when the time comes for you to pull the trigger, I'll help you do research so you dont pay too much.

They've stopped asking me."

intermittentfasting,feiinb4,t3_epc80l,1579139405.0,"When youre hungry, chug some water. People often mistake hunger signals for water signals because, well, they feel the same. That really helps me.  When chugging water no longer alleviates the feeling, then i know im hungry.
