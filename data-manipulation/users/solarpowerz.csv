If possible, eat organic free range meat because the animals are treated much better while they’re alive and it’s healthier for you too. If you think you’d like to give vegetarianism a try, egg whites are literally the perfect protein. I think veganism may work for some people but most are going to require some kind of animal protein to stay healthy. Egg whites are perfect for that purpose. Anyhow, wishing you all the best."

And the airlines were making plenty of money. And now even though prices are cheaper, there are more people flying so airlines are still making money. The airlines are simply screwing people that’s all. Time to break up the monopolies and regulate the industry again. 


P.S. Cabin air is contaminated w/ toxic fuel chemicals that attack the nervous systems of pilots, crew & passengers. Airlines have refused for decades to install air monitors that detect & warn of contaminated air aboard: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=D97No_7fbR4&feature=emb_title"

Decentralized solar power is the answer (panels on homes w/ their own battery system). Safer from a national security standpoint, don’t singe birds right out of the sky, and ends predatory energy monopolies. Also, bladeless wind turbines are almost on the market. They are more efficient, cheaper to build and maintain, and do not harm birds and bats. 

Definitely time for the govt to subsidize all this plus electric car purchases. It’s working out for Norway. Almost have of the new cars purchased there are electric.

aww,fe0c7rx,t1_fdyoixz,1578809457.0,"Coyotes are very shy gentle creatures. They don’t want to mess with humans. They are excellent parents. Coyote attacks on humans are incredibly rare and only occur when humans have encroached on the coyotes territory so the coyotes can’t raise their babies without feeling threatened- virtually the only time a coyote will attack is if someone gets between them and their kids. They will eat small pets so one has to be mindful of that, but the coyotes have a right to live too. We got to respect mother nature and live in harmony with her. Grew up in coyote country and never even saw them hardly. Could hear them singing together at night but that’s it. They play a hugely important role in keeping the eco system in balance and healthy. They are shy good guys who just want to raise their babies and chill in the woods in peace <3

SandersForPresident,fcnd4p2,t1_fcn4oml,1577809161.0,"It's all about balance, the balanced middle way. Perhaps that's how you personally define centrism (but the reality is right now, centrism means letting corporations rape the land and steal all the money that other people earned, while giving lip service to various social issues).

Democratic socialism is the balanced, middle way. 
Capitalism without regulations leads to corporate feudalism, i.e. a tiny amount of people at the top who have stolen all the money and exert control on the rest of the population. 
No capitalism leads to authoritarian state, i.e. a tiny amount of people at the top who have stolen all the money and exert control on the rest of the population. 

Democratic socialism protects democracy. Remember, Labor produces Value. Billionaires stole our money which only has value because we labored for it. Democratic socialism is how we take it back."
