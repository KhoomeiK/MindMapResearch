YAwriters,ffjuogv,t1_ffjs1s2,1580007443.0,"Ehhh, I'm not trying to make my book a YA is the thing. If my book seemed to be in the YA genre I would be more careful with phrasing and make sure not to be too gory etc, but seeing as it isn't innately a YA from the replies I've gotten, I'd rather write it exactly the way I intend. I'd rather stay true to the story I want to tell than attract a specific age group. To be frank, I don't care if anyone read's it... In fact I expect it won't be aside from maybe a bored book-tuber who notices it has 0 reviews. If people love it I'll be really happy, but if they're going to like it, they will weather I am trying to lean in on a demographic or not.

I'm not negative, I'm just an artist, and I understand the likelihood of being ""discovered"" in any way. In the end I'm satisfied with telling my story as it's meant to be, and if anything that will bring the books overall quality up by not trying to please or frighten anyone.
Also i'm 28... I didn't understand teen drama or angst when I was one because I had a very unconventional childhood. I doubt I'll be more intrigued by them now."

It's just add's emphasis to bring the second word to the next level, It doesn't have an exact translation because like fuck it has a lot of possible connotations/ meaning's depending on what it precedes, it is used in the same sort of fashion though and it is considered crass so you don't find the highly educated or eloquent using it very often.

Until this thread I figured my book was YA due to the setting. But I'm not really trying to make it fit a specific genre. That's my editor and the one reviewer who finds it on amazon's problem not mine IMO. Most of the books I liked best weren't trying to hit a target audience.

I see YA as twilight, hunger games, city of bones etc but I thought animorphs was also a YA book and those were two opposite ends of the violence spectrum from what I assumed were in the genre. The later books are sort of YA I think as far as HP is concerned. 

I haven't read much of the genre to know to be honest. I stuck to educational books for the most part and was never confined to any age groups in my medial by my mom, she probably would have let me read GoT if we knew about it when I was still a kid. So I didn't have a good idea of what defined a YA book until I made this thread (story, violence, setting, etc) I figured the semi-fantasy and possible light romance put it in YA because of that lol."

I don't feel trapped in structures, having the story written out gives me time to think over main plot points, character arcs, I can begin to develop and see the characters personalities, how they react to what is happening and figure out where I want them to go. I by no means feel obligated to follow that...it's like an itinerary when you go to Disney world. You want to get all the things in so you plan the whole trip out, but sometimes you shift the schedule or drop some things because other's seem more fun when you get there or maybe you're just tired and want a snack rather than seeing splash mountain. It's a guide, not a rule. and i can fit all the story pieces together that way because i'm focusing on the whole. like sketching out a drawing I block in major shapes first and change, add, edit it as I feel suits it. I can also go back to it so if I do change something I know where and when I have to edit those things in to lead up to it without reading the entire book. And the most important part is, i can see the rythem. The up's and down's, the 30 page short draft is like a song, with lul's and crests that play together very nicely and I don't think i'd have that if I couldn't see it all on a few pages. 

I was in the middle of writing the outline for book two when I realized it seemed so out of nowhere. So I entirely changed it and moved the entire lot to book 3. In writing the outline for book two I figured out where and how I want book three and the ending to go and how to bring that story-line into the main one."
YAwriters,fffewus,t1_fffcpun,1579882467.0,"Alright, I'll check into it :) I got some books from writer family members for Christmas, Stephen kings book on writing and steering the craft by Ursula K. Le Guin 

I'm only good at planning because when I started writing fanfics at 14, and did into my 20's I always found it a relaxing hobby, writing my own series seemed daunting even though I have thousands of pages of FF and some that are 300-400 pages. I spent a lot of time getting characters right, nothing bothered me more than seeing characters say and do things that were out of character for them, and the dialogue between them still draws me back to re-read sometimes, I think I've gotten pretty good at certain aspects of writing thanks to it. I also love world and character building (I'm a DM for DnD as well) so I racked my brain for a while to see what the hangup was. 

I realized I found them so enjoyable because the story was set up for me. I always vaguely follow the story being set out. So I decided to write out the entire plot, who goes where, when and why, what's revealed along the way. So I can just enjoy writing and editing the story around that and focus on the people living through it. It's going well so far, and seeing the shorthand has me really excited to write it all out."

I really never found many I liked in that regard so i'd like to write it myself. 

I'll worry more about the story than the demographic, good stories draw people in, not a specific group of people."

YAwriters,fffcivg,t1_fffatke,1579880952.0,"Ahh, I didn't really think about the main characters age, I was thinking too hard about unrelated details and not the basics haha. I suppose it's an adult book then, as she's around 24-26 at the start. It wouldn't work with the story if she were any younger. But I do like the idea of it targeting younger people. It's the sort of book I would have loved when I was younger, mixing history, fantasy and good strategy. I also dearly wanted characters I could admire rather than foils to insert myself into. So that's what I'm trying to capture here.  

Also I'm writing a semi/detailed rundown of everything that happens in the series right now, a play by play of sorts, then I'm going to write book one and finish it. I want to make sure the story is thought out entirely before actually starting it and I want to edit/add in plot points and necessary things now in the concept stage rather than rewriting chapters. I also feel it allows me to see how all the pieces fit together and figure out how many books the story needs to be told rather than realizing I could have added a hundred pages to book two and gotten a much more concise story than filling out an entire third book. But I'm not going to jump around once I start writing, I just like to know what direction it's going towards and if I like/have worthwhile arcs and stories for everyone major. It's not pleasant to get through 600 pages and realize you have no purpose for someone you keep bringing up, kill someone off that no one knows or cares about, or get to the end and realize you didn't plan for a good conclusion to a major characters story and you have to go back and rewrite a dozen chapters for it.

Just enough to provide a clean surface/support for the top layers but not too sparse to allow it to crumble if pressed hard. When I try to change infill settings in Cura right now for some reason it still makes the print solid. So I manually changed the infill line width instead. brought the weight down by about 30 grams and print speed down by 4 hours, I did this before I printed the first and took it down further to try and bring the time down. 

For my mini's I do solid but have the infill print faster like 60mm/s with the walls at 25mm/s, I also have the mini's set so it thinks every layer is a top layer, which makes it print really nicely, for my monster's i usually have the infill much lower as they tend to be larger.

Where as for the floor tiles i'm doing it's 50-60mm/s for all of it and just the normal top/bottom layers. For mini's it's usually only a gram or 2 difference between infill or not anyway, but it makes a huge difference on the dungeon scenery like floor's which is my current issue"

For Draco it's the first, he was raised to think it, and he's not stupid as has been proven by his grades. Many former racists and children of racists have PoC SO's. If you're taught to think a certain way that thinking can be undone. Assuming it can't is basically giving up on the idea of anyone who is currently racist changing their minds, which wouldn't set a very good tone for the book series, and isn't a very hopeful outlook on life in general. 

There's plenty of kids raised by racists who realized what they were taught was wrong and that usually came from, you know, being around people who are the people they look down on and realizing what they were taught is stupid not even just racists but elitists and kids raised in cults. Usually that happens in school, that's why it would have made for good character development and given him an -actual- redemption arc.

I mean James was from a family of muggle empathizes but still pure-bloods, they pitied muggles but not one of them ended up being with one or even the descendant of one so that was clearly still Taboo on some level. 

There's a small chance they would have gotten into a fight or had a rough patch over something being carelessly said (post books I mean. he did call her a mudblood in 2nd year) Snape did that too and he's a half-breed himself. The chances would get less likely as time went on and he moved away from what he was taught to think. and it's Still healthier than the dynamic of Ron mocking Hermione every time she does something studious or something she enjoys, which is him putting down her interests and mind, not a slip of the tongue from decades of indoctrination. To be honest, I don't see Draco doing that anyway, he's a bad person most of the story but he isn't careless with what he says or does. He says nasty things specifically to get a rise out of someone, not just saying whatever thoughts come to mind like Ron tends to.


Not to mention he did talk a lot of shit, but when it came down to it he was pretty horrified when it was real. It's easy to say careless things when you don't think it's that serious. No one really took the basilisk serious, no one really took Voldemort being back seriously. It was sort of like spouting BS on the internet where no one can see your face. It's really mean and doesn't mean anything. But when it did mean something he was not down. Like when he found his muggle studied teacher about to be eaten, he was super not ok with that. Or how mortified he was when Hagrids hut was being burned down and he spent half his school career trying to get that guy fired. He was more of a shit stirrer than a true villain, and while that doesn't excuse his actions by -any- means. It does make it easier to imagine him stepping away from that."

In this way i'm helping flesh out the world, the lives of people, the rules and characters. 


Once i have the world, it's rules and the cities down enough that I can see what the world is like i start by making a list. Bear in mind all the story stuff i'm putting in here i'm making up on the spot so it's not great. 


Story starts here. 

A city is sieged. 

main character is caught in the siege and loses his best friend. 

They're defeated and the survivors flee. 

They reach the nearest city and are refused entry. 

Main character decides to fight back against the enemy

Enemy moves on to _____ area. 

Main character sneaks into their camp as a new recruit.

Defeats bad guy.

Uses his head to rally the refugees and gain the attention of the other city's leader.

Reclaims first city by rallying an army of refugee's and some troops borrowed from the other city.

Becomes king due to his actions. 


From that list i start to expand on it i usually insert things in between like. 

A city is sieged. 
main character is caught in the siege and loses his best friend. 
[meets another character that helps comfort him and bolster his resolve to survive]
They're defeated and the survivors flee. 
[main helps keep everyone going with a speech]
They reach the nearest city and are refused entry. 
[main character formulates a plan with their new friend to strike back]


As I go through I work out characters for it, give them names, ages, appearances, personalities and note down relevant backstory

Having this basic character model helps make sure I have variety as well, plenty of my own story has a set of african twins that are 600 years old. a 2400 year old egyptian witch, a 900 year old irish ginger witch, a edo period vampire. and due to my story they get to act and dress as they feel comfortable which half the time suits the world they are from.

For example in the series i am writing this has been really fun and rewarding because they vary in age from their 40's to being over 2000 years old and from all over the world, their morals and base natures from that time are still present so it's really fun to bounce a 67 year old gangster vampire kid from the bronx off of a 2000 year old greek vampire who started his life as an educated athenian with stoicism views and ended up being a hoplite in wars before being changed. 
 
From there I write a VERY short hand draft. 


~~~~~~~~~~~


Describe city and setting, show the life of the main while he works as a blacksmith in town, he realizes he's late for work while sword fighting with his best friend and rushes off. 

Meet's up with his blacksmith teacher and get's chewed out for being late while he get's to work. 
While working he hears customers chatting with his teacher about purchasing bows and swords because they're nervous about talk of war and a band of rogue mercinaries raiding cities. 

Later that night the main character goes to the inn to talk with his friend, telling him about his plan to join the city guard. friend thinks it's a stupid plan and tell's him he has his head in the clouds if an orphan blacksmith can join the guards watch. 


~~~~~~


I have about 30 pages on my main book series of this shorthand, where i explain who goes where, when and why. just basically what's going on spanning about 2 books of what happens. 


During this phase i rework that initial story progression list a lot and the rules of the world change and develop in every phase of this, adding new areas, new people new rules. 
For example in the series i'm writting the entire second book premise has been moved to the third book and now the second book has an entirely new storyline in which a few characters die. 
Writing it all out breifly allows me to make sure the story is concise and I know exactly where everyone is at any one time and I don't end up having to delete whole chapters when i realize it doesn't fit into the story progression because I went in blind. or having to rewrite half the book because I decide on a different goal for the story. 


once i have the shorthand draft done I start on the first draft, which i haven't done yet in my own book because i'm still ironing out a lot of the third book and some second book issues involving 5 people raiding an entire city with little to no resources. but doing so will be easy because i have a brief blow by blow of what i want to happen.


I got into writing by doing fanfictions when I was young to teach myself how to spell, and I always wanted to write my own books, but it seemed so daunting to write a book, while fanfics have always been an easy way to write something for fun, i realized it was because someone else had already made a story, timeline and characters for me to play with.

fantasywriters,fdes7dj,t3_eksf50,1578345507.0,"I've always found the limitations set on magic allow for more story and conflict. Having limitations allows for more balanced issues. for example Harry's only limitation in HP was how much magic he knew. but the world was still so filled with it he had tons of ways around talent or skill. (like gillyweed instead of learning a spell, having a broom instead of facing a dragon. It saved him because he wasn't very smart or talented and in just about every book it popped up as a deus ex machina to save him out of nowhere. Facing a basilisk? ehhhhh random phoenix! Facing voldermort in year one? Mom magic! We wanted to see him suceed because he was a nice person, but he rarely earned that victory himself. Even learning the patronus was only because he realized he had seen himself already do it (which imo is a little silly) or how killing himself actually gave him the choice to kill the horcrux inside him.

It all worked though because that's how the world was set up to be, nothing was too silly of a deus ex because that's how things always were in that world. 

There were far more clever ways they could have gone about thing. but due to him being a foil for the reader they didn't give him a lot of personality or characteristics of his own aside from jumping into danger to do the right thing. 

Limitations allow for characters to think through and figure things out, it helps them develop as fleshed out people by forcing them to face real trials and overcome them with their own skills and wit.

If it's a heavy magic world having limitations still allows for more dynamic solutions. You can have big magic and still keep it reasonable. Limiting the types of magic people can use is a nice way to do this, even naruto does it for their magic in which their chakra's element shapes the skills the use. (naruto is air i believe) so he uses his rasingan. sasuke is tallented with fire jutsu due to his fire chakra.



I'm writing a book with magic myself but it has hard limitations, the witches are tied down to potions, chants and limited skills that required time and effort to prepare but against other things (a vampire army for example) the smoke bombs and such they can make are excellent weapons, rosemary oil replaces garlic in my story as it's a pagan protection plant. It's used to anoint houses and weapons so vampires can't touch them The main character uses this weakness to make smoke bombs that turn the oil into an aerosol against a small army of them, it highlights her ingenuity and ability to adapt and and create strategies. Her skills are strategy, politics, combat and leadership, so doing things like this allows her tallents to be shown to the reader rather than just saying ""she's so clever, what a great leader she is!"" Instead she get's to use those skills to their full potential. by organizing the creation of, and designing the bombs.

Visions in my world are affected by the person seeing them, as their own reactions to what they see will affect the possible future. This is why in my story the greek oracals didn't care about anyone or anything, lived as hermits and gave carefully worded, vague answers, it allowed them to see the most possible outcomes by not directly affecting the future with their actions or words. One of my characters causes a lot of issues because she's very SURE about them meaning a particular thing (visions from the god she warships to shape the future, which they actually aren't)  and her actions to ensure a specific outcome limit the future's she see's. like tunnel vision and she's too driven and dead set on it to realize she's shaping the outcome herself, this is a later conflict because while they believed she was helping she was really causing a lot of harm and death by wanting to see a particular future take shape. 

As well as some larger skills like a cloaking spell to keep them hidden in plain sight for a while required the death of a horse to preform. This prevents magic from just instantly fixing all the problems, in my world it's a tool, like anything else. and that works well. 

Just because it's a heavy magic world (from what i can tell by your description) doesn't mean the magic has to outshine the characters and their own ingenuity. 

As far as types in the world, I don't think you really NEED a limit for that, you may want to limit the number of cards one person can be good with, or what types, or something to that effect to prevent harry potter syndrome,  but you don't have to as long as you set your world up to account for that."
fantasywriters,fcwst7x,t3_ej5470,1578036170.0,"There's always the option of casual friendships, many friendships last a few years, people who work at shops, bars etc she goes to or things she does that she found interesting enough to befriend (if she has interests or hobbies that would be relevant, being that old you have to get bored)

I was ride or die with dozens of people for a few years and I really still only talk to 3-4 of them because that's life, we all went our seperate ways and none of them were falling outs. I trusted a lot of them with my life and helped me through a traumatic loss, life went different directions for us though and I don't know any of them now, it's just natural. 

Does she find life (and people) tedious? 
Does she enjoy the company of others? 
Does she get annoyed by or enjoy casual life drama's?
Does she like to go out?
Is she afraid of people knowing?
Is there something (aside from aging) that makes her secret obvious? 

They don't have to know her secret to be her friend and there's nothing weird about drifting apart from them after a few years.

It all depends on her personality though.
If she's 410 there's a good chance she's confident in her ability to keep her secrets and maybe even a little lonely. 

There's a good chance she wouldn't be too close with any of them (again depends on personality) because she's aware of the finite nature of her friendships. That can bother her, or she can not mind like enjoying a cut flower, it doesn't have to last to add something to her life. 

Really it entirely depends on who she is and you know your character better than us, maybe she's bored and takes art classes and has coffee with some people there. Maybe she likes sports and has pub friends, or liked to bar hop. or has a casual friendship with a bookstore owner. If she does like people and friends there's a good chance she's pretty good at reading people by now, so if she's fairly intuitive about other people that could be a reason.

I have some vampires and witches in my story varying in age from thousands of years to decades old. Some like people, some don't some see value in friendships with short living beings, some see it as a pointless time sink. it has nothing to do with their age though, it's all about who they are and how they feel about it is another facet of their personalities."

ender3,fcmnjjr,t1_fcmkro3,1577783021.0,"Thanks for the reply :) 

I've leveled the bed for the last 3 prints (all with the same base layer results) going around the bed 3+ times at each corner using the paper trick where it resists just a little, and this last time I eyeballed it and made it even closer (almost touching the bed). The last time I did it the print adhered better (it didn't peel up like all the others while printing), it was almost too hard to get off in some spots but i think that was due to how thin it was and very little of it was touching the other lines. that's the one you see. stringy and disappointing.

How can i fix under extrusion? When it's going down it's thin and stringy as opposed to my first couple of prints that laid down good lines. 

All the prints got better line thickness wise as it hit the 3rd-4th layer. But I've leveled the bed so many times I don't think that's the issue, I level between every print actually unless I just finished one. and the poor first layer is causing issues as i'm trying to print out some quality of life parts for my ender and the slight distortions are leaving them unusable."

The prints are good and solid but the base layers are trash. As you can see on the lower left side that long spot that isn't catching light right was due to the first layer curling up. I couldn't even get the edge to adhere on the third object."
WritingPrompts,fcji2w2,t3_eh18e9,1577688422.0,"Scrolling through his phone in the corner of the generic cafe, reading the texts over again, 

[Ethan I need you, please, I don't know who else to talk to] 

He turned the screen off, instead focusing on his coffee but it didn't distract from the other bitter taste in his mouth. Why of all people was his high school girlfriend asking him for help, sure he was a great shoulder to lean on. Even he knew it that's how he managed to fall into relationships so easily, he was easy to talk to. A curse really, why did everyone have to come to him with their problems? He had his own life to lead, his own mysteries to solve, he couldn't spend all day sitting around comforting his old flame because she's stuck with some abusive asshole, he didn't have a kid with a clearly manipulative douche-bag, he wouldn't be dumb enough to, let alone twice. 

He scanned the crowd, eyeing the glimmering Zero's over people's heads, like video game quest markers but none of them had anything interesting to say. 

""Your bagle sir"" He jumped slightly, glancing up at the guy, some pizza faced teen with a warm smile, his eye's scanned further up on instinct and he paused for a moment, a physical hiccup, he squinted at the number, a one.

""Uh, will that be all sir?"" The kid looked a bit uncomfortable, nervous almost. He glanced around quickly, everyone still read Zero, so what was with this guy? The kid looked up, a look of realization washing over him as he let out a small ""oh"" He leaned down. 

""Can you see them too?"" He asked excitedly. Ethan was flabbergasted. 
""Yes, yes I can!"" he looked up again, just to check. ""what are they? where are they from?"" he asked. The kid's face fell a little. 
""I'm uh, not sure actually, you're the first three I've seen""

""Three? I have a three over me?"" He glanced up, knowing it was pointless but imagining he could feel the number floating there tauntingly. 

""Yeah, Everyone I've met is a zero, Except one of my friends, she had a thirty five over her, it's wild but when she came back from her mission trip it was only at four"" Ethan's mind was racing, not only was he not alone, and not crazy, there were others. 

""Hey, kid can I have your number? I've been trying to figure this out my entire life"" He passed his phone over. The kid began to tap away at the screen as he spoke.

""My names terry, and sure, let me know if-"" A loud wail drew both their attention. A woman was across the room. frantically hitting her child's back. The kid was half limp and blue, just a little thing, maybe five.

""He's choking"" she cried ""911, someone call 911!!!"" What seemed to be the husband shouted at the nearest person. Terry threw his phone back but Ethan fumbled the catch, the screen hit with a nasty smack and he cursed. By the time Ethan looked up the kid seemed to have flown across the room. pushing through the people starting to gather like water.

""I know CPR, give him here!"" Terry all but ripped the kid from her arms. Ethan was frozen, it seemed like everyone was, the only person dialing was the girl behind the counter, looking ghostly white. Everyone complains about no one acting in a tragedy, but your first reaction is, nothing just a silent panic dancing around with unknown fear while hour heart drummed loud enough to drown out the frightened muttering and cries of panic.

The scrawny pizza faced kid gripped the kid from behind a with a few hard pumps of his hands the kid gagged loudly. The the obstruction popped right out onto the floor anticlimactically, and the child's head lolled to the side as he started CPR on the frail little creature. As the kid gasped, and started to quietly breath in ragged breaths a small flicker drew Ethan's gaze. Just above Terry's head, the one flickered out replaced by a zero. Like everyone else. 

Why? Why did it change? He racked his brain, adrenaline and relief from the chaos still pumping through him. If it meant saving someone's life, wouldn't the doctors and cops he'd see have high numbers? No, but then, the girl who went on her mission trip had a number of them right? So what did it mean? 

His phone vibrated, mechanically he looked down. [I'm afraid, what do I do?] From her again, he didn't have time for her, he had been trying to solve this for decades. He stared until long after the screen went black and the EMT's arrived, none of them had anything other than a zero. Maybe they saved so many it didn't count, maybe because it was their job.

His phone buzzed to the familiar tune of a call and he answered slowly. The woman's voice was in a fevered panic.
""I'm sorry but you're the only person I know, I'm sorry I just think he's really coming this time he's been calling and-"" He stood up as she spoke, forgetting his drink.

""Just shut up, I'm coming to get you, packs your kids junk"" he hung up then, As he headed for the door he saw Terry again, he looked a little drained from the ordeal, but he was entirely focused at a spot somewhere above Ethan's head. 

""Your number, it's um...""

""I know""
