CPTSD,fff82sr,t3_etb6tk,1579878056.0,"Excellent question. Can you be specific in what your needs are? Is this the type of info you're asking for? Maybe not the topic, but the content:

For instance,  my brain showed signs of disconnection, my being unable to understand certain things people would say or do, or even an ability to accurately see and process the world around me. This awareness showed me how I was always being confused and saying and doing off things, and I had no idea why.  This was my normal. But it was hurting me and I needed to understand why...

My confusion level was very high. After a lot of introspection and a lot of research on trauma and brain development, I realized the reason for my disconnect. My brain was unable to evolve in the safety it needed. My trauma started during my time in utero. The continued abuses and trauma caused my brain to form in ways that my center part between my left/right brain, the CORPUS COLLOSUM, literally formed with holes. This in turn caused my L/R brain to be unable to talk to each other in a normal way. The synapses couldn't get from one side to the other side. This meant outside and internal data was ""dropped"" while my brain tried to communicate and share experiences in my whole brain. My ""world"" was always confusing and lopsided. 

Since this discovery I've found tools to begin changing the very structure of my brain. This is called brain plasticity. I can see the results and I'm doing much better in my observing and understanding and even relating to myself and others. I've also found my left brain needs more attention, my logical brain part. I have even felt pressured and movement in the left brain as I challenge myself with the new tools I'm using for this issue.

Please tell us if you are able, what exactly it is you struggle with so we can help fine tune the conversation. This is an amazing request for support. I applied your awareness of need."
CPTSD,fff64ja,t3_etay1c,1579876678.0,"Maybe it's a good thing you're aware of the possibilities of being set up? I feel that's important to acknowledge. This is self awareness and relationship awareness. This then allows you to stay aware of her actions in the future, and assess things as they occur. Hopefully she is being authentic. Then that's a win for both of you! She may be feeling good you reached out during a painful time in her life and is grateful. Giving may be her love language. And if not, at least you'll have a better awareness of the glitch and hopefully not have it trigger you to a negative reaction, but towards a self affirming boundary action.

I hope you're feeling more peace with this. It's a huge challenge for many of us and can be daunting and scary."
CPTSD,fff55oa,t1_fff1udj,1579875966.0,"You're absolutely right, and I truly hope I'm way off and way wrong. I wish someone in my past would have brought this issue up for me to have heard the possibilities that I faced. I had no idea the people who hurt me had alterior motives. I love being wrong, when the outcome is positive. I will always rather be wrong having said something, than to be right and having been silent. Thanks for your comment."

funny,ffdxizs,t3_et1753,1579831394.0,So grateful I have no people like this in my life.
narcissisticparents,ffdx3i2,t1_ffd2o7j,1579831087.0,"Sorry about your dad. And even though you apologize to me, I thankfully don't NEED YOUR permission to take care of myself and THAT is one step gained in my healing journey. And, that felt good when I read your post condemning my right to be self aware and self care. Sounds like you may need some therapy dealing with your grief. Lashing out on a site for people grieving and needing support from abusive parents is odd. I'd start with why you feel this is where you need to express yourself in your anger. 

Your initial post was exactly the way my psychopath mother treated me, turning my words into something not even relevant (NO mention or intent of saying I blamed my mom, only my traumatic birth was mentioned. MY traumatic birth.) and falsely judging, blaming and shaming for me gaining healthy actions that support myself (my post WAS me taking responsibility for my OWN needs in a healthy way.). That's another area you could look into."
narcissisticparents,ffdtcsl,t3_esyd3z,1579828431.0,"I'd begin seeing her like she was acid. If you touch acid you get a deep and serious burn. You need medical attention. If you put acid on your clothing it always burns a hole. You ruin that clothing.

She is TOXIC. And nothing you do or say as a kind and considerate human will EVER change HER. That's the who point... No Thing is about you. It's all her so, stop. Stop trying and live your life for you and your family. She is not family. She is a virus and infects everyone and everything. She'll keep using false blame and shame, triangulation, gaslighting and all the tools in her arsenal.

Change your patterns to only self care. Don't give her the time of day. She is a cancer. A cancer that only kills. 

Good luck."
CPTSD,ffdqfe5,t1_ffdpqns,1579826460.0,My pleasure and thanks for asking. I hope this helps you. 🤝 It makes it easier for me to go out in public now. And that's really a nice difference and also gives me hope as I heal other triggers. 👍
narcissisticparents,ffdgsxa,t1_ffdfuu5,1579820553.0,Thanks for the reply and encouragement. I have sonce figured out I was being triggered by a recent post I reached out to from someone saying goodbye on Reddit and stating they were ending their life. It took me back to childhood and my feeling I failed my dad when he died. It stirred it all up so this post was my way of trying to figure out this topic. It's all a puzzle. I'm slowly figuring it all out .
CPTSD,ffddy1g,t1_ffdbu1z,1579818856.0,"Sure. For this issue I became aware of it first. I began to notice how a crying baby hurt everything in me. It felt like knives and needles all over me and in my brain. I'd get tense and feel hypervigilant and like I needed to comfort that baby, NOW!

I realized this wasn't normal. Only then was I able to begin understanding where my reactions came from. My wounded inner  child hurt from a baby's crying because as a baby, I had needed soothed and comforted and I never was. Connecting this all together was key. 

I began to talk to myself every time I was confronted with this. I would silently reassure my inner child that she was safe, that I was here with her and she wasn't alone. I comforted my inner child, reminding her that baby had it's own life and the adult will do what they do. I needed to remind my adult self it isn't my job to rescue people, or police them. That's not my job. I can relax and allow others the right to their own life. It helps take the pressure off. I support myself now when I encounter a crying baby and I rarely feel triggered. It's really amazing to have gotten this resolved. Before it was all pain. Now it's just like people yelling in a store or restaurant. I'm safe and it's just noise. I've saved my inner child."

CPTSD,ffd0m61,t1_ffc993d,1579811072.0,"Thank you. I went NC five years ago after my psychopath mom died. She and my entire family and my two oldest adult children purposely didn't tell me of her year long struggle with cancer. I had no idea at that point my brain has been so brainwashed and scrambled that I suffered from Stockholm Syndrome. But her ""sudden"" death and being physically assaulted later that same day by four older siblings jarred me into waking up enough to realize I was not welcomed in the family and I needed to go nc. I do have my youngest adult son in my life helping me get on my feet and for me to heal much of the damaged done. My brain had been so altered by the abuse since birth I've since realized my left and right brain were unable to talk to each other. This probably has been one of my biggest challenges. So far I'm doing better as each year passes. Plus we moved from that area and are presently in process of moving five hours  further away. It's been hard and at first I felt I would literally die from the pain and confusion of the discordance. We left everyone and all we knew behind. But it had to happen if we were to heal and have our own lives in safety. 

How about you? Do you have family in your life? Are you nc?"
insaneparents,ffc6lfn,t3_eshql0,1579792730.0,That's a family with narcissistic behaviour. When the scapegoat can do nothing right in their eyes. It's time to cut all ties and go no contact. She's amazing and I'm impressed.

So, although you may think you have the right to tell me I'm wrong and get over myself, I'll say to you, you know nothing of what you speak and your judgement of me is misplaced. It's ok, because I know many people just like you, and you are angry and also hurting. I don't blame you or pity you. I'll let you be you. That's your right. Although quite abusive of you. And as far as my taking responsibility for myself, I have, or else I'd be dead. 🤗"

You NEVER, EVER, EVER deserved ANY of her anger or hate!!!!! Just the shock of seeing her in that state of dying is enough to cause shock and create more pain. For that I am sorry you went through this. But, the only other alternative was to not see her. Both have their own problems and pain. I understand because my nmom pretty much did the same type of final discard to me. She withheld her yr long cancer from me. All so her death would cause even deeper wounds. You understand this. 

Five years have gone by and it took time to finally be able to grieve and sort it all out. To be okay with how it all went down. To know I did my best and it was good enough, for me. 

And you have done your best, too. In time I guarantee this will settle inside. Be gentle with yourself. You deserve kindness. I hope you have support during this time going forward. I am deeply sorry for your shock, and pain, and loss."

CPTSD,ffanz1n,t3_es6qrw,1579740418.0,"I've never had a solid, or successful relationship with a therapist. I always seemed  to know more about the issues at hand than they did. I would need to explain to them the issues with a generational family system of abuse. They could not grasp the degree of manipulation and damage the family did and was doing at the time. Every therapist said I needed to deal with it, they were family and I was in the wrong. Even after I disclosed incest by both parents and siblings, sa by priest and nuns, and so much more. I was talked down to, ignored, blamed and shamed and told I was needing to change, not them, and they're family and so many of them insisted I was the problem. And they wanted to put me on medication but my system was so out of balance their drugs only hurt me and did nothing positive. I was blamed for that. Told my adverse physical reactions don't happen with the drug so it couldn't be a real problem, I was making my symptoms up. 

So, yes. I've not found a supportive nor knowledgeable therapist and realized healing was all on me. Thankfully I have access to the internet. Self healing is possible. 👍"

Especially a mmom since to them, you are a part of them and don't get to be a separate person. Of course any attention you give to others or get from others is a huge trigger to a nmom.

Good luck and make as many safe friends as possible. They'll be a support you'll need."
CPTSD,ffa4at6,t3_esh65x,1579727603.0,"That's me. It sucks and has caused some issues, usually with people providing me a service, like a hair stylist. I try to not take things personally, yet because my left and right brain is damaged (I have issues with them communicating with each other) I forget that I had bad service from them, and I go back expecting them to provide a good service and then they don't, so I get triggered. I finally realized I'm doing that very thing this week when it happened again at the stylist. My fix? From now on I'm writing down in my date book my experiences so I can refer back to it for the future. I shouldn't have to do back to a stylist to tweek the haircut about 80% of my haircuts! Something is wrong here. I'm moving so I'm finding a new stylist and this time I will share nothing personal and I'll keep it all professional, and I can still be personable. Maybe that will help.

But, yes, I do feel and think people do nasty things to me on purpose. Because my nfamily purposely hurt me and I have only begun to understand this reality. Now I'm kinda trigger happy about every person and how they behave towards me. 

Healing is fun.... Uh, right. /s"
narcissisticparents,ffa2sxd,t1_ffa0353,1579726747.0,"Thank you. I just realized I'm feeling doubtful of myself because I had reached out to an individual here on Reddit the other day who was saying goodbye and said they were going to end their life. Finally connecting the dots is helping. It's tough because this stirred up inner wounds I need and want to address from when I was a teen. I was my dying father's sole caretaker for two years when he was dying. I carried inside a self hatred believing (falsely) that I failed him. This is now what I've been feeling about this Reddit person. I'll work through this and accept I can be sad, and I can still reach out to others.

Advice,ff9xcor,t3_ekt7rk,1579723553.0,"Three kids here. All natural. Middle child was 100% pain free. First and third had some pain. They were all fast deliveries, too. From first contraction to birth they were between 1.5 hrs and  2.5 the longest. As someone mentioned, our bodies are made for childbirth. I found that staying calm and breathing through the pain, helps relax the cervix and dilation goes faster. Listen to your body. Do what works best for you. Everyone's body and every birth is unique. All the best to you both!! Enjoy that new miracle!

Edit:. A small bit of advice.... Kinda weird to talk about but important. While in the beginnings of labor, if they offer you to have an enema, accept it. If they don't, ask for one. They are painless and having it cleared out before birth, you won't ""go"" while in labor and your mind won't be worrying about it happening then. ""Everyone worries but its natural."" So, take care of the ""business"" before the important event happens. Your daughters birth!! You'll be happy you did."

It all works together and I am less anxious and bound up tight inside my emotional self and in my physical body. All the best to you!"

He may have had a preconceived idea of your age and you actually surprised him and to ""cover his tracks"" and push his surprised reaction away he came off a bit condescending? Just a thought. And a doctor may have some issue with appearing weak? Glad to read he was professionals for the rest of the appointment."

CPTSD,ff469io,t3_erj5zh,1579556461.0,"Awwwww, this is so sad!!! I'm sorry your big excitement was dashed by her issues. I'm sad she was unable to put aside her issues and focus on your big excitement. As in all things this is a challenge and a lesson. You deserve to feel happy and excited and good about yourself and your achievements and successes!! I celebrate your new adventure AND that binder AND even those sheet protectors. Sometimes in life it's helpful to look at challenges through a different perspective, or a different lens like on a camera. It could be looked at like this....

Those sheet protectors have an important job, to protect and be clear so you can see what they protect. And you also have a protector, your mind. It can be used to protect yourself and is something that helps us see out and others see us. I'd personally use those sheet protectors and remind myself of the importance they bring to my job and life. 

Congratulations on the new internship!! Have fun and learn a lot. And I hope you can rise above this glitch. You are worth having a life that makes you happy!!! 👍🤗🤝🏋️💐🎂❤️"
CPTSD,ff45gnj,t3_erjj0x,1579555961.0,I hear you on this one. It does take a toll on a person. I have zero advice and that's ok. Because I have no idea what I'm doing.

She went to the other side and came back, fully healed. She is still healed after 14 YEARS! Plus, all she experienced in the other side is what fills me with hope and helps me keep going.

Edit: Plus I met her and she was warm and authentic and personable."

CasualConversation,ff446vm,t3_erhtjn,1579555158.0,"Time to be AWARE of her but NOT ACKNOWLEDGE her. That's exactly what she's doing and it's meant to leave you feeling the way you are feeling; frustrated, ignored, less than. Know she's a c you next Tuesday and not worth the time or energy she's sucking from you. 

And I agree with you, there is a social etiquette she is ignoring. Her behaviour makes her feel bigger and strong, which she is the opposite, small and weak. And please do not feel bad about not acknowledging her. She has asked for this, so give her exactly what she wants."
