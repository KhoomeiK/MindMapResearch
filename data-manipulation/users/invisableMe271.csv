depression,ff7hl1e,t3_es2xos,1579649723.0,"Ok, first thing is you need to stop weed all together. It turns out that most strains of weed have been modified to make them have high concentrations of THC and no CBD. This combination makes anxiety worse and there have been rumors of it leading to psychosis and other conditions like that.

CBC marketing place did a story on it. Try searching  ""cbc marketplace weed"" on YouTube and watch what they said.

As for the hospital part, I've been in and out of the hospital my whole life. I remember one time I had surgery when I was younger and they had to hold me down. This terrified me for many years. I'm mostly over it but the hospital still makes me a bit anxious.

That being said, I know you would benefit from being there for a while. I know how scary it is but it is worth it to go and get help. So please just go and get yourself help.

Your problems deserve attention and you are worth helping. All you need to do is learn to trust the doctors. All they want to do is help you.

What business do you own?"
depression,ff4teiv,t3_ern9vk,1579572003.0,"Ok perhaps you should do some research on medication and how it works. 

Medication aims to change the compounds that are present in your brain. This in turn helps people to cope.

The thing with meds is that they dont have exactly the same effect on everyone. They can also take a long time to kick in. We dont have a solid understanding of why this happens. All we can say now is ot is because the brain is very complex.

As for proving, in medicine to prove something we do clinical trials. We do this because it is unethical to cut people's heads open to see what is going on in their brains. The kind of medication used for mental health problems has been tested rigorously. If you want more info, try searching for a research paper on the subject 

Mental illness is a physical illness. Your brain is made of matter and thus it is physical. The medication acts of a physical organ otherwise known as the brain.

So no, meds are not a scam. I know many people who would not be alive with out them. If you dont believe me do your own research and come to an informed decision.

I hope this helps"

depression,ff1eb2o,t3_er4cdp,1579478103.0,You're welcome. Good luck  :)
depression,ff1ds4y,t3_er4cdp,1579477885.0,"No you arent destined to be this way. You can get better.

What you could try is writing down how you feel on a piece of paper. Then when you see a doctor, just give them the paper. They will be able to take it from there and get you the help you deserve  :)"
depression,ff1cyd4,t3_er4eaq,1579477579.0,It's ok to feel that way. Perhaps you should go see the youth worker at your school. They should be able to help you and prevent this from getting worse :)
depression,fezyv8z,t3_er0ujy,1579463384.0,"Its great that you're taking your meds again. 

You should probably talk with your psychiatrist about how they make you feel. Not all meds have the same effects on you and they dont work instantly.

Good for you for trying to get better  :)"
depression,fezya3i,t3_er111y,1579463185.0,"You'll be ok. 

It does sound like you have depression. Yes teenagers are generally emotional but what you've described is more than just being emotional.

It is ok to talk about how you are feeling to your friends. Try to find someone you trust and tell them everything. 

In addition to that, try talking with the youth worker at your school tomorrow. They will be able to help you.

Its probably a good idea if you seek out a psychiatrist  to help you. You can be happy again. You haven't truly lost anything. You can enjoy life again. You just need a bit of help, and that's totally ok.

You have so much potential and you are worth helping. Please dont give up.

I hope this helps :)"

depression,fewk0k7,t1_fewjepl,1579412270.0,"It's ok to be afraid. But your psychiatrist spent a long time in school learning how to help you. They are trying to help you and they aren't going to tell you to do anything you shouldn't.

Yes there are side effects however by not taking them you are exposing yourself to the effects of mental illness. Either way, you will be making trade offs.

Just trust your psychiatrist's advice. They know what they are doing and they care about you.

Please start taking your meds again. It will make your life so much easier  :)"
depression,fewjepl,t3_eqsa2o,1579411819.0,"There is nothing wrong with taking sleeping pills to sleep. Also I'm really hoping you stopped taking your meds because a doctor said so. If not, please reconsider."
depression,fewj42z,t1_fewiaj3,1579411598.0,"You're welcome. At my university you first need to make an appointment with a family doctor then they refer you to a therapist. But I'm also in canada so we have government health care too.

You might be able to opt back in to your campus care. Definitely worth checking out. You'll get better. I believe in you :)"
depression,fewiaj3,t3_eqruic,1579411090.0,"Omg I feel the same way. It's also like that at my university.

Definitely go on the wait list. You could try talking to your friends about how you feel. If your university forces you to get health insurance like mine does, you could try seeking help outside of campus.

I hope this helps :)"
depression,few82pc,t3_eqriac,1579406713.0,"If you tell them, they will help you get better.

Please be honest with the doctors and therapists they are there to help you. You can trust them.

I know you can get better and I believe in you :)"
