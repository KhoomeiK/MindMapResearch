aww,fe3vjdi,t1_fe3twsy,1578853228.0,"in this occasion due to the severity of the fires and the harsh situations, it is needed because there is *no food* anywhere for these animals and it can 2 weeks before grass can even start growing and 4 for leaves (but due to the drought, it will take more); it can take up to months before anything else to grow back so this way is the best one, otherwise they will be forced to move toward the farms and eat the crops.

Which in consequence will cause farmers to shoot at them causing even more damage to this animals."
