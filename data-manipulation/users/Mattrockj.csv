The nano gel has got to be one of our greatest achievements yet, and this time i'm quite serious. This stuff can do practically, and un-practically, anything.

The only issue? We have no idea how it works. The lab boys were just experimenting with some goo they found outside the elephant room, and BOOM, they made this stuff. So far all we know is that we can make it change with magnets, we still don't know how though.

Currently we trying to mass produce this stuff for commercial sale. Let random people experiment while we gather all the data. And once we know how it works, we triple the price and sell a guide book separately.

The most common question i get asked, that's not about insurance, is ""When will we start developing scientific vehicles?"" And to that, i give you, the mini mech.

I'll be forward with this one, its not that great. When i said i wanted a mechanized vehicle of war, i never expected the lab boys to pull this one on me. It doesn't matter now since most of them are finding their new home in the incinerator to be quite comfy.

Our current estimates for practical uses? None. 

Estimates for non-practical uses? Anything that involves either a hellish glass of lemonade, or a new way of committing arson.

For start, neither had blonde hair. and while sure the green haired guy could, he has a slightly darker skin tone, meaning he isn't the farther regardless. now the other guy's wife could have blonde hair, well this just wont do either, since he had a larger build relative to a standard wrestling ring, and the kid is quite short. male body size, even at a young age, comes from the father, and that kid is not large. Ergo, that kid either came from a woman cheating on her wrestling husband, is confused about who his father is, or some other reason."

godtiersuperpowers,ff1geir,t3_eqzsx1,1579478815.0,"Just FYI, there is actually a difference between a succubus and an incubus.

A succubus is the hot one that feeds off sexual intercourse. They are only female.

An incubus is a male equivalent of a succubus, except according to several mythologies, they also use intercourse as a means of streaking souls, and only returning the souls in exchange for the soul of another (which you give them by having sex with someone). A succubus does not do this."

WritingPrompts,fewvmuj,t3_eqr3q3,1579420194.0,"Everyone eventually finds someone, its just an unwritten law of this world that you will. Well not unwritten, cause its literally on your wrist. Though everyone also stays away from someone, that one person whom they dread the most. These are the anomalies of this realm, and everyone acknowledges their existence... Well, except for me.

In a world of love, I never really understood the reason for it. Sure it can make you happy, but to me it seems more like a shackle. You're bound for life with one person who apparently shares all your common interests. To me that would be agony. I repulse myself, and i cant change, i was just born into this wold as coal among gold.

But who would i be without myself either? I would be less than nothing. A void, or a husk, and at the very least, coal keeps people warm. So while i may be the bane of my own existence, i'm still here for a reason. I'm an anomaly among anomalies. A white sheep among black sheep. Everyone is unique, which make everyone the same, so when one person is the same, it makes them unique. 

All these years brought me to today. All my experience, my personality, my bland uniqueness. My misunderstanding of what ""love"" is. My self hatred. My self Love. Everything. Which is why when i woke up this morning, i was not anxious for what was to come. Others get excited, because they learn who they will spend the rest of their life with. Others are scared because they have a new enemy. But with me, i knew what was to come, and when i blew out the candles on my cake, the shimmer on my wrists started, and i knew exactly what was going to happen.

I looked at my wrists, and the names written were the same. Familiar names, unique names, hated names, and beloved names. They were my name, and i was finally able to be at peace with who i was."
