BlackPeopleTwitter,ffiw3ms,t1_ffhcaxo,1579984117.0,"Yeah, point taken but most of those were in the late 1800s. When Lincoln created it the reason was to combat currency counterfeiting (which they still do). They started protecting the president **after** McKinley's assassination in 1901, so really only 1 president has died at their hands in nearly 120 years of protecting presidents. 

Not a perfect score still I know, but I think the information is worth mentioning."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffgsooy,t1_ffglqhw,1579914062.0,Because the secret service is really good at preventing presidents from getting assassinated

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffah5sj,t1_ffa88v0,1579735635.0,"Because it's large, culturally diverse and there's a lot of opportunity here. It's one of the states receiving the largest amount of new residents as well. I cringe when I see shit like this because I know in my area of the state this shit would be an outrage. But it's a big ass state so you've got anything from country bumpkins to major international metropolitan areas"

GetMotivated,fel9c56,t1_fekxp33,1579216892.0,That's pretty much what this sub is about tho. I don't think it's meant to apply to 100% of people and 100% of situations. It's just saying keep doing what you know is right and you'll see results
GetMotivated,fel984q,t1_fel856c,1579216820.0,Yeah I hate analogies

AskReddit,fek27dz,t1_feji70b,1579191034.0,"Some of these sound nice but it doesn't snow here. I don't drive my car to have fun, I drive it to get from point A to B, so that doesn't matter that much to me either. Why is a manual more desirable as time goes on? I don't get that part."
AskReddit,fek1ylx,t1_fejlsat,1579190883.0,"I'm surprised to hear this, this kinda breaks up the circlejerk a little lol. It seems like automatics are sinful for Europeans when the topic comes up on Reddit"
PublicFreakout,fejt3tk,t1_fejigiu,1579185192.0,He says at the end that he doesn't know whose dog it is

TwoXChromosomes,fdwttkk,t1_fdwhikp,1578762282.0,Honestly. People are getting completely buried in this comment section just for saying they like their kids lol
PublicFreakout,fdwjomz,t1_fdw0k5a,1578759442.0,This just sounds more like you creating a rage porn fantasy for you to get worked up about. I doubt that this will even be reported on at all.
JordanPeterson,fdqop56,t1_fdqmh26,1578671576.0,"Keep in mind the post said **social issues** not social justice, which is a different thing entirely. Let's be precise with our speech.

I agree wholeheartedly with your assessment of what kids should learn. Do you think a book should be excluded from the curriculum if it mentions a social issue? A lot of traditional English language literature touches upon societal issues of the time."
JordanPeterson,fdqjz04,t3_emql1w,1578668507.0,"I don't see why you can't teach both of these things. Social issues encompasses suffrage, civil rights, public health... and many other things. There's a lot of strong opinions about what's a waste of time for kids. So, out of curiosity, what are some things the folks who agree with this think kids *should* learn at school?"
stupidpol,fd4z8fv,t1_fcva9y2,1578172644.0,"I agree and say in the second sentence of the post ""The video is too long"""
stupidpol,fd4ybxx,t1_fcw3h6w,1578172339.0,"This was a reply to something I didn't even say, big brain. Lmao. Whether you watch the video is inconsequential. It's the comments people leave without watching that were so completely devoid of substance. Is that difficult to comprehend or something?"
stupidpol,fcv5k06,t1_fcujkb3,1577995092.0,Man some of you people are stupid as **fuck**.The video is too long but at the very least you would think that one might actually criticize it's content instead of circlejerking about how you're not gonna watch it bc you're totes not a narcissist
hiphopheads,fcteifr,t1_fct3vdf,1577940707.0,"They aren't being compared because they both have a vagina though. They are being compared because one is an example of mainstream appeal and the other of a more niche fanbase. 

What's reductive is you completely ignoring the context of this discussion and instead taking issue with the idea of two women being compared in any way."
JordanPeterson,fc53p99,t1_fc523tn,1577441528.0,Or maybe just a dead guy with a gun
JordanPeterson,fc53l7i,t1_fc4wafo,1577441365.0,Lmao
