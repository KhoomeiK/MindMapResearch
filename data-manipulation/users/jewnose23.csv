IncelExit,ffee7te,t1_ffeafwm,1579844724.0,"It really depends person to person. You know that  quote about how people can't be reasoned out of what they weren't reasoned into? It splits incels into 2 groups. Being incel purely on emotion, and being incel based on evidence beyond the anecdotal experiences of one person. 

That is why I dont find point in challenging the black pill. Because one group does not let their beliefs change, and the other is open to change, but has not found a reason to. People that can reason themselves out of inceldom simply wouldnt be incel."
IncelExit,ffe9swl,t3_et52ht,1579840669.0,You just said answered yourself. Because it's easier to give up.
ForeverAlone,ffbfzme,t3_esmz6b,1579763619.0,I mean to be fair I'm 17 and I can safely say I'll be alone because i choose to be. I'm scum that doesnt deserve others. No one should have to consider me there friend.
SuicideWatch,ffbfoxr,t1_ffbfbh9,1579763255.0,"To me, what is real is what I can find evidence for. I have evidence I'm not attractive, talented, etc... I'm a person of logical thought. I cannot change how I think without a reason to change."
SuicideWatch,ffbcz98,t1_ffb9366,1579760143.0,Unfortunately I cannot speak to anyone in real life. The internet is my escape. Thanks for the kind words though
SuicideWatch,ffb8awq,t1_ffb81g2,1579754777.0,I couldnt tell you. But dont spend your whole life trying to get it. You cant force someone to love you. Its effort better spent on other things.
SuicideWatch,ffb7xva,t1_ffb7vac,1579754427.0,I see that is unfortunate. Why do you care what your parents think of you so much.
SuicideWatch,ffb7udp,t1_ffb7ovi,1579754326.0,"Interesting. Does playing and singing help you in any way, or at the very least distract you from these thoughts?"
SuicideWatch,ffb7le2,t3_esni9u,1579754054.0,What do you like to sing? What kind of music do you play on guitar?
depression,ffadmti,t1_ffacgxj,1579733088.0,Idk man. At what point does suicide become the better choice. 20 years? A year? A month? I feel stuck. I want out.
depression,ffabzz0,t1_ffaaxyg,1579731961.0,I think you misunderstand. I have accepted that I'm unfixable. I dont like who I am. I merely accept that I cannot change
ForeverAlone,ff1ir4y,t1_fezuw7l,1579479865.0,But I'm not willing to change my mindset. Thats why I said I'm stuck here.
depression,feuwgzf,t1_feuce30,1579390621.0,"I will agree with you on that. As someone with the same mindset I would never force it on anyone else because I'm not quite sure it can ever be broken. However it is comforting to see I'm not alone in my beliefs. It almost validates that's it not just in my head, other people have these issues too."
depression,feu0k29,t1_feto82i,1579381932.0,So you admit it doesn't get better for everyone? Why say it all then.
depression,fetllp0,t1_fesrx87,1579376639.0,Not trying to discredit your experience but how can you say with one hundred percent certainty that life will get better for everyone? I'm sure many people die depressed.
SuicideWatch,femax7b,t3_ept7vg,1579246532.0,I'm sorry for your losses but this doesn't convince me at all. My death would not have the whole class sobbing. It would have my family and my few friends. And I dont even care about who mourns me. Thats not why I'm suicidal
RecoveringIncels,fej2x0d,t1_fej22u9,1579154894.0,Well fuck. I hope I get better to. I dont have much hope. Thanks for the help
RecoveringIncels,feitimd,t1_feiqu13,1579146810.0,God ain't that the truth. I cant stop
RecoveringIncels,feiqolz,t1_feiopmx,1579144802.0,Doesn't matter how long the list is if everyone's list is longer.
RecoveringIncels,feij6py,t1_fehwuur,1579139762.0,"Nevermind staying there, I cant even get there. I'm a logical guy. I can't delude myself with false hope. I need cold hard facts that say I have value. And I havent thought of any"
RecoveringIncels,fehv74x,t1_fefxtod,1579124518.0,Makes sense. But what do you when my list of things I dont like is many times longer
depression,fef8rje,t1_fef7oj0,1579050863.0,"I feel like its pretty common on this sub lol. Millions upon millions of people commit suicide, Someone dies from it every forty seconds. I'm sure you've met someone suicidal at some point. Suicidal people hide it because as much as people will deny it, society looks down on you for wanting to leave this earth early"
depression,fef6xjd,t1_fef62gf,1579049626.0,"I'm in the same boat as your friend as I'm depressed and suicidal. I obviously cannot speak for him, but when you want to die nothing means anything. Not friends, not family, nor anything they say.  He has to decide he wants help. You can't just give it to him or it wont be any good"
NoStupidQuestions,fef60qa,t1_fef52rj,1579049009.0,Overweight almost sounds better in my opinion because it's not socially okay to make fun of them.
depression,fef5xdu,t1_fef4seo,1579048945.0,I'm not sure what to say. Therapy only works if you take it serious. Meds only work if you take them. You cant force him to care about his mental health. You have to convince him
NoStupidQuestions,fef42hn,t1_fef3wi7,1579047690.0,Oh I didnt know about second puberty thank you.
NoStupidQuestions,fef3y97,t1_fef3p5w,1579047610.0,Well that fucking sucks. Thanks man
ForeverAlone,fef3qav,t3_eoplzn,1579047462.0,Wish I learned this a year ago. 17 and I'm already stuck here.
depression,fef310z,t3_eotyng,1579046992.0, Check if he even wants help first I'd say. Speaking from experience you cant help someone who does not want it. Itll save you a lot of wasted effort
SuicideWatch,feblvw7,t1_febc2p4,1578960157.0,No thank you
SuicideWatch,fe59isg,t1_fe58f3a,1578866833.0,Interesting. I disagree but I guess I can see where your coming from. Guess it shows how shit of a person I am. I just bother people so idk why I even brought it up. Excuse me while I go get my noose.
SuicideWatch,fe58753,t1_fe55q7s,1578866492.0,Do you truly believe the love of someone he has  never met will help him?
SuicideWatch,fe52or2,t1_fe4wcb3,1578865108.0,You saying you love someone you have literally never met and is nothing but text on a screen to you devalues the word. You cant make any promise to him.
SuicideWatch,fe4jo6m,t1_fe4iptk,1578860026.0,You are absolutely correct. I would never be angry at someone trying to help. That is not you. You made me feel worse. That's why I'm angry. I posted to get help and all I got was useless platitudes. I regret posting this at all.
SuicideWatch,fe4ft2e,t1_fe4e5hd,1578858804.0,"Just shut up man your spouting vague bullshit to try and make me feel better. ""Other reasons?"" What other reasons. Oh right you cant tell me because they dont exist. Fuck that makes me angry. Dont just tell me shit to give me false hope."
SuicideWatch,fe4dfxt,t1_fe4bk4z,1578858088.0,I'm sorry your right I'm not worthless. Technically working at my job provides a sort of value to me existing. However I'm not satisfied with my ability to generate money being my only source of value. So I just said I'm worthless for the sake of simplicity.
SuicideWatch,fe4cid3,t1_fe46zu9,1578857853.0,I don't believe I owe society anything. I believe that my worth is tied to what I can provide others and I fail in that aspect of my life.
ForeverAlone,fe3x7uj,t1_fe3svim,1578853672.0,Why is it not ok to think about? Many of us here feel the same way and can sympathize with him.
SuicideWatch,fdpv9vx,t3_emjyxh,1578641923.0,Same man. This world ain't worth living in.
depression,fdpueoq,t1_fdpu7yd,1578640892.0,Suicide is my choice. Between death and life I want to choose death. It seems like the better option
depression,fdpu65n,t1_fdptzu2,1578640618.0,Says who. You? Dont take away my right to choose what I do with my life
depression,fdptyew,t1_fdptsxd,1578640370.0,3 years and counting. Whether suicide comes first I guess we shall have to see. I'm definately leaning towards it
depression,fdptm6g,t1_fdpnu3t,1578639986.0,I'm sorry if I gave the wrong impression but I cant find the urge to try fix myself. Your mistaking laziness and apathy with resilience
IncelExit,fcvdr0t,t1_fcv9zod,1577999971.0,Easier said than done man. It's not worth the effort
IncelExit,fcil1fy,t1_fcgwdzo,1577664336.0,Thank you very much. One of these days I'll get around to trying to fix myself so I have nothing to be ashamed of.
IncelExit,fcc9oz5,t1_fcaasdv,1577595936.0,"As long as your not hurting others than do whatever you think will help. As someone too weak to try, I can wholeheartedly say most things are better than doing nothing."
IncelExit,fcc9brb,t1_fcb9b5g,1577595827.0,"You misunderstand, I dont logically believe i have value either. It's not just an irrational emotional thing. I also expect so much from myself that whatever value I convince myself I have will never be enough."
IncelExit,fc9ooxq,t1_fc8skhe,1577555866.0,Your right. I got the one thing I thought I wanted and it didn't fix me. It just makes me feel so hopeless. If this cant help me nothing will.
IncelExit,fc9ocgv,t1_fc8v9bk,1577555712.0,I would never expect her to fix me. I can't even fix me. I just pretend to have confidence around her and she seems to believe it. I dont want to burden her with my problems
IncelExit,fc9o3af,t1_fc8v6xb,1577555598.0,Havent said anything to her. I haven't told anyone about my pain. I just suffer in silence behind the front I put up
IncelExit,fc9noiq,t1_fc9ngzu,1577555425.0,About a month I'd say. I see her a couple times a week
depression,f6pi9ny,t1_f6owrtb,1573056951.0,"Logically I know I have nothing to offer to a women so I should probably just forget it, but my monkey brain keeps forcing me to have hope and I hate it. If I could turn my dick off I would in a heartbeat."
