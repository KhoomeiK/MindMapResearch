videos,ffcfamw,t1_ffcerp1,1579798217.0,"I guess then whatever estimator you used was incorrect.

Brute Force doesn't care what Letters or numbers you use. It ""brute forces"" every possible combination. What it was probably doing was calculating entropy, and a plaintext word didn't trigger the factor of special characters and numbers.

The fact is that any computer program designed to brute Force a password is going to try 0's for O's and other substitutions of that nature. 

All of this is ignoring the real problem which is not password complexity, because almost no one brute forces passwords anymore. Passwords are ""hacked"" through data breaches, password reset vulnerabilities, and social engineering anymore.

If y'all learn anything from this post, it's that you need to enable 2FA on any account you give a damn about.
