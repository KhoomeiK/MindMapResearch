In fact I hate the term ""white privilege"" as I would say it's the exact reason so many rural whites get radicalized into fascism. ""Privilege"" has the connotation of unearned special benefits. So ""white privilege"" registers to rural poor whites as ""all whites have it easy"" instead of the official definition which is to explain that white people dont have to deal with active suffering directly related to their skin tone. ""White privilege"" is not having to worry if a cop is going to shoot you for a traffic ticket. That's not a privilege that's just a basic fucking decency all people should have. But talk to the academics about poor white people who get just as much or at least a comparable amount of systemic shit thrown at them for being poor (which is the core method of racial oppression now-a-days is a lack of social mobility) and all of the sudden these big city liberals who think they're ""woke as fuck"" are going to lecture you about being a racist.

Class is the core method of oppression all other forms are delivered through class. The white bourgeois feminist has minimal to nothing to complain about because class dominates all forms of oppression in society. And that's why I fucking hate the term ""white privilege"" but still use it."

Sometimes syndicates dont always have a monopoly on the industry. Like there will be a local and a national. The national would make the decision to ramp up production.

Maybe I'm repeating myself here but under socialism a decrease in demand isnt a bad thing as a need for work decreases as well. 

Socialism has a huge critique on capitalism that technology will eventually make work obsolete and socialism is the attempt to structure society in a way to help phase out work.

Lenninists for example would start it with capital controlled by the party. Anarcho-syndicalists would probably have a specific lumber syndicate hire on new people, acquire a new property and expand their syndicate to meet new demands, as the entire industry would collectively be controlled by one syndicate (realistically not that different from how capitalist businesses expand now).

AskSocialists,fcxo8cu,t3_ejhaxp,1578067614.0,"I would assume most western inefficiencies come from regulatory capture. The US for example has such a massive carbon foot print from the lack of public transportation. 

Our food waste would rappidly decline just from eliminating the fast food industry. (You wouldn't believe the amount of meat they throw away every few minutes).

Of course the need to eat meat at all is entirely a crock of shit from the big ag and for every pound of beef the resources used to produce that could produce over 541 pounds of edible plant matter with a similar nutritional content. 

Your friend is right the western standard of living is massively unsustainable but a large majority of that is from propaganda and not from individuals consciously deciding that's how they want to live. 

Also You can't deny once capital is out of the way as far as barriers to research and funding we would easily come up with so many other sustainable solutions. Space travel even. I'm certain housing could also easily be reorganized to be more resource efficient without threatening quality of life."
worldnews,fcxlx4b,t1_fcwh1fj,1578066102.0,is it even a theory at this point? thats just kind of how the US works anymore.
