GET MONEY POWER OR FAME!! Lyle Lovett had Julia Roberts... they can't resist either. Let them smell the money. Never give it away dummy. Give it to a children's hospital instead.

Women aren't special. Neither are men."
AskMen,ffi76sf,t1_ffhm3g8,1579966886.0,"Throughout my years for some odd reason I either crossed paths with man eaters briefly, or still know a couple to this day:

They NEVER respect a man that shells out for them constantly! 

One lady in particular. She's the type that follows large events across the country. High end, think $3,000 a night. She has someone she's been regular with for about ten years.  She claims she can never Love a trick like him.

I've been that guy chicks would call after a fully paid for dinner date. Once she would be done with that sucker, it's on to fuck me. And they would brag about it! No dinner dates unless we're together together.

They need us more than we need them. Never forget.

Now, I don't participate in ""dating"". Not interested in kids or marriage. Now U go out for a good laugh and to people watch. No desperation stench on me. Pussy flocks(exaggeration) now. Meaning I get approached.

Can't believe I'm about to quote 50¢. ""Chase the money, not the girls, they come with the shit(money)""

Can't believe guys still get married. Women intiate 89% of divorces. 

Love ladies night out at the bars..."

YouShouldKnow,ff8cyam,t1_ff84dql,1579673377.0,Former property manager. I'll never drained or been advised to drain potentially 100s of tanks on a single property. Would need one employee specifically to drain tanks. What a easy job that would be.
