todayilearned,fejrd07,t1_feiwaed,1579183929.0,"Even with things like cars, okay. Lease vs buy?  Yes you can lease a Ferrari, it’s just how it gets structured and through who. There’s serious implications financially with both, short term and longer term.  Hell, depending on what you really want you can get into a premiere exotic rental deal so you have a stable of cars to choose from and you don’t have any of the maintenance, storage, consumables to deal with."

They can structure how to manage big purchases if you want to make them, and how to set things up to avoid the tax implications of any residuals to ensure that money goes as far as it can based on your desired lifestyle.  
If you want to blow it on hookers and blow that’s fine, but stupidly enough there is the expensive way to do that and the smart way to do that.  Same goes for having big houses, cars and boats.  You can do all of those things the expensive way or the smart(er) way."

news,fehm9e3,t1_fehbsby,1579119410.0,"It’s not big time that is the trigger.   The trigger is multiple offences.  Once you are convicted it doesn’t matter how big or small what you were dealing was, you are a convicted dealer.  
You go to jail you come out, you have a system that is stacked against you as a convicted felon (ie no one wants to employ you) so they turn back to drugs for income.   Get caught, strike 2.  Rinse, repeat.  Strike 3 mandatory minimum LWOP. 
And this is how you end up in jail for life for doing small crimes."

Add in wind though and it becomes downright dangerous to have exposed flesh at those temps, and wind just cuts through even the best layers of clothing like a scalpel."

I’ve had a da bomb when I was at an Indian restaurant in London of all places, this was long before hot ones was even a thing, they put some on some lamb for us because we said we wanted “real spicy food”.  It just wasn’t enjoyable and I’ll go so far as to say downright uncomfortable to eat."

There is no way Trudeau is going to align with trump and go to war, or risk putting himself in the middle of their fight at that moment.

Shit the Vice President is busy pushing bullshit propaganda on twitter at the moment that this general somehow was involved in 9/11 and that Iran was the root of the hijackers.   The US intel community 600 page report on 9/11 never mentions the guy once and is clear that it was Saudi backed.

If you are concerned about the actual amount of light paint a wall or multiple as the cement absorbs a lot.  If you don’t like the warmth then change the lighting itself.

worldnews,fcnf8mv,t1_fcnaiow,1577810498.0,"But even that doesn’t solve the problem;
Real life example: I am hiring for a new analyst position. I know the skill set I need but this could be sliced two different ways 1) I get someone new with minimal experience and we teach them and build them knowing that it will be a long roar 2) we get someone with experience who can hit the ground running.  I got a plan for both routes but there are a lot of unknowns. 

I’m not sure what the free market looks like right now so we post for the generic role, responsibilities and skill sets and see what comes in and who applies knowing full well we have a wide band of pay we may need to be looking at.  

I could write all of this out in a job posting but who is going to read it and the job searchers would likely be more put off by it than anything.  

I could post the salary BAND as you described but putting $60-120k is not exactly helpful. 

So....”what are your salary expectations” is a reasonable question.   

Let’s not forget we live in a time where data is more abundant than ever.  Glass door and other tools will get you within 10k for most roles and companies once you get into the specifics."
