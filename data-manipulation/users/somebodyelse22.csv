Screw the world who want to classify it for approval. Ooh! a black person and a white person? Who cares? An old person and a younger person? Who cares?  A tall person and a short person? A fat one and a thin one? What does it matter? That's why I was scoffing at people taking music into consideration, it's just not relevant to two peoples' relationship.
