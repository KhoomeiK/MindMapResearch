JusticeServed,ffmrcbj,t1_ffmpnuk,1580058111.0,Twitter  + clear name + saying dumb shit = a disaster that is waiting to happen. Many people still to this day don't get that Twitter isn't your private friend circle. It is a megaphone to the public and the internet doesn't forget.
YouShouldKnow,ffmijhq,t3_eu6lx3,1580055230.0,Sad to hear. Followed two courses back in the day. They were always friendly and helpful.
Nokia,ffmcujl,t3_etmjs0,1580052558.0,"Probably not exactly the answer you hoped for but what you could try to use a music app like Musicolet. After scanning your disk space you can select the song/sound through the album section (third symbol from the left) and tab the more options button (...). Select ""use as ringtone"". At least that is how I do it."

Games,ff9leek,t1_ff9i0ud,1579715452.0,Retroarch is really nice and convenient. Use it for my old PS1 games. Too bad that their only PS2 emulator core isn't usable for playing. Have to use PCXS2 for my beloved Suikoden games.
SubredditDrama,ff6g1ed,t1_ff66or2,1579626405.0,"The word you search here is ""neonazi"""
trashy,ff5zhab,t1_ff5tl8f,1579615149.0,"Welcome to idol culture in South Korea and Japan. From the little I have seen, it's brutal."
RimWorld,ff19vij,t3_er1f4b,1579476665.0,Pro tip for beginners. I learned that Pyromaniacs and wooden floors have a great synergy.
HollowKnight,fezsnjq,t3_eqwm19,1579461140.0,"Congratulations! This is a great picture. Makes me want to pick up my drawing tablet again.

Edit: Looks great on my phone. Thank you for sharing this great piece with us op."
facepalm,fezpnl4,t1_fez29h7,1579460089.0,"no it's probably ""I'm not racist because I'm to 1% African and can even say the n-word!"""
facepalm,fezkuxb,t1_fezf1tu,1579458397.0,"I mean as an European I look at the first amendment of America and think: Nice idealistic idea in theory but in reality completely self destructive.

Radicalization through the internet where you can say the most extreme vile shit (and lower the  inhibitions of others with that) without any consequences. It's like a body without a function immune system. State has to relay on companies to define what is actual dangerous hate speech and they do a piss poor selective job."
HollowKnight,fesljtk,t3_eqgrfj,1579366490.0,Light... Blazing bright?
gog,fems6j9,t1_femn4ou,1579268083.0,"Ok one reply. Dogpile downvoting isn't non aggressive or just ""don't agree"". It is used to silence people and discourage them from saying certain things again. A typical problem on Reddit. I didn't expect much agreement with my relative harmless statement but the downvotes clearly show me that even this little different opinion is already not tolerated on this sub. This sub is just another echochamber. First expressions are important and this was mine with this sub. I don't really see the point in participating here further."
gifs,femlx51,t3_eppkl1,1579261923.0,Drone racing is so cool. Seriously thinking about buying a drone someday. Probably a expensive hobby through.
