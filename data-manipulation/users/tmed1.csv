My turt does this all the time, usually just with his back legs sticking out, it's hilarious and v cute. I call it ""extending the solar panels""  :)"

Also I'd imagine maybe skydiving without a parachute- would certainly be fun, and once you hit the ground I would think it's a pretty instantaneous death, prob too fast to feel any pain. Can't personally speak to that one tho lol"

Back when I was using I overdosed a few times, it's like a rush of euphoria that's almost too strong/too good, and then warm nothingness. Very pleasant, and with all the fent around these days shouldn't be too hard at all! Yay..."

Hell, even just living in the same damn state as him- he was in long term rehab twice last year (6 months each time) and now staying at a halfway house in Florida. 

We're both New Yorkers, I'm still in the city but he's obv not. Been together for 6yrs but I haven't seen him in almost a year and a half.. and while we do talk all the time and I do respect that his sobriety is the most important thing to work on right now, I miss him like crazy and the loneliness gets rough. 

Hopefully this won't be for too much longer :("

Also it's not just ""my experience,"" that kind of sexual dysfunction in both men and women is one of the **most common** side effects of MDMA, along with nystagmus, increased body temp, etc. It wouldn't be a known, listed side effect if it wasn't an *extremely* common thing that other people experience too.

Using way too much spray tan and hair dye and a bad combover etc are all CHOICES.

Makes slightly more sense than zoomer 90s nostalgia tho. But yeah, culturally 2002 was not too different from say 1999 so the overall ""vibe"" was still really similar. Maybe they're just nostalgic for the approx years of their childhoods."
