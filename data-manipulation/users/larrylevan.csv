politics,ffg04vg,t1_fffs1i8,1579895586.0,Lmao. Where are these “actual republicans”? Last time I checked they all give undying support to Trump. Anyone who can’t stand Trump has left the Republican Party.
politics,fffzynf,t1_fffabp6,1579895481.0,"I recommend reading The Coming Third Reich by Evans. It really goes into detail about the rise of the Nazi Party and how Germany got there. The parallels are terrifying.

People tend to assume “Hitler’s Germany” just means 1939 onward, but there were six year prior that are also Hitler’s Germany. That is where we are now. 1939 is what happens when Trump decides he won’t abide by term limits (something he has bragged that he will do)."

If Russia invaded a NATO country and expelled the people from their land, NATO countries would be obligated to attack Russia. How is that any different? Oh right, because the Arabs are brown."
HistoryMemes,fff8upv,t1_ffef23e,1579878591.0,"Give me a fucking break. Israelis have also committed massacres and terrorism as well. They practically started the whole thing with the annexation of Israel and the expulsion of the Arabs.

And no, the Arabs weren’t subjugating Jews in 1918. There were barely any Jews in Palestine then and they mostly lived peacefully side by side. Stop parroting propaganda."

DunderMifflin,ffcgs26,t1_ffcb1tb,1579799128.0,"He didn't ""expose himself"" in the way you mean. He asked for consent from adult women to masturbate in front of them. Some said yes, some said no. He never did it in front of a woman who said no. 

Two women, years afterwards, blamed him and that incident on their failed comedy careers. However, as many will point out, they consented and it was in CK's hotel room. They could have left his room but they didn't."

Do you really think the fact that he is a game show host changes anything?  Absolutely not. He perpetuates the same corporate politics that have captured this country for the last 40 years. Jesus this site is full of idiots.
law,ff8zl8t,t1_ff8ernm,1579701001.0,"You are very naive. Besides, it doesn’t have to come directly from Barr or Trump. Look at how Stormy Daniels was unlawfully attested at that Ohio strip club. Trump has enough lapdogs and sycophants in power to do what he wishes without having to explicitly order it. My money is on enough Prison Bureau folks being Trump fans to make this happen."

todayilearned,fds7lnz,t1_fds2smk,1578696168.0,"Lol you just admitted that religious people are inherently horrible people. That the only thing keeping them and this world from becoming terrible is religion. Curious then how atheists and agnostics can go on with life without hitting women and committing other heinous crimes without threat of a god or absence of an afterlife?  Could it be that religious people are taught to be good so they get a reward versus non-religious people being taught to be good for empathy? And what a lovey message Christianity sends that you can be a shit person all your life and simply repent on your death bed. What a wonderful lesson that I’m sure pays it forward...

Also, religion has been used as an excuse for most of the horrors of this world. Hard to imagine how the absence of religious would result in more horrors. I’m sure the thousands of children the Catholic Church abused would agree with you."

AskNYC,fdl624z,t1_fdl4ugq,1578517659.0,That's not true (at least in my experience). The mail-in thing only applies if it's defective. I had a station agent transfer the funds from an expired card to a new card immediately and hand it to me.
