You do learn a lot about yourself when you’re alone. No everyone likes it and some people prefer to always be surrounded by other people.

OP isn’t saying he wants to abandon his family. Only that he wants to know who he is without living with them. 

No one said you have to move out in order to learn. We’re merely saying it’s ONE way to learn about yourself and become responsible. 

In western societies you also find people who would do anything for family and take care of them even if they don’t live in the same house. 

OP, you can google apartments for rent, and you’ll see the prices hat come up. It all depend on your budget, what kind of facilities you want, and which neighbourhood you want to live in. You can also try to find roommates to make rent lower. (I don’t know if it’s a thing a lot of people do in Bahrain but you can become friends with people you wouldn’t have met any other way)"

What exactly is the LGBTQ+ agenda? 

Cause the way I see it, it’s only people who fight against the discrimination they face everyday. 
Hell, trans people even have to fight to be recognised as who they ARE. Beliefs and opinions are meant to be challenged. 

I’m guessing the family knows the step son is transgender. There’s no believing or not in it. Only accepting someone’s identity."
family,ff30pme,t1_ff2j3eo,1579530554.0,Except being transgender isn’t an “agenda”. I don’t think there’s any harm in telling the BIL that he found his joke hurtful. Family members should understand that some things they say or post might hurt other people in their family.
family,ff30lj0,t1_ff2kysm,1579530460.0,"Except it only works when those jokes are funny and not coming from a place of ignorance/bigotry. Which rarely is the case. 

Usually trans “jokes” are all the same. Kind of like misogynistic jokes are all about how wives are nagging and women are stupid/hysteric. 
People should know some jokes are/can be hurtful. 

Dark humour is only funny when you know the person making it doesn’t actually think what they’re saying and when it’s so horrible and surprising it becomes absurd."

If anything her mental health is proof."
family,ff2f9dp,t1_ff0mexv,1579503674.0,"Just because ONE girl did it to you doesn’t mean “women do this shit a lot”.
In OP’s situation, I agree with everyone saying everyone should go see a therapist. Because if it happened and they didn’t believe her, it will destroy her. And if it didn’t, the brother will have issues. 

It must be incredible hard to tell your family that another family member assaulted you. And given the family history, it’s possible that the brother was abused himself by the uncle or grandad and reproduced what was done to him on his sister. 

That’s why they all need to see a therapist, so that they can process everything. 

And you have to remember that there’s even more people who don’t say anything their whole life for fear of destroying their family. I have friends who have been molested by cousins or even their father and have never said anything to anyone because coming out means you’re the one destroying your family."
