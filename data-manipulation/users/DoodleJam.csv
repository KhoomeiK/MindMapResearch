SuicideWatch,fcv2yhz,t1_fcuxvcn,1577993562.0,"It wouldn't surprise me that you got OCD from your dad since things went awry at a young age. But believe me, you would be better off mentally if you was away from your parents and that negative environment. It sucks that your friend doesn't have reception, but hopefully your OCD improves so much so you can move back into the city after a year or so where you can get reception again.

And I know you have reservations, but Trust. Your. Body. Generations of trial and error from our ancestors provided us with the bodies we have now. As a result, the brain is so powerful it can cause you to feel and think things that are not true. You can overcome that by trusting your body. And I know a routine of exploring your body will weaken the grip OCD has on your brain. Closing your eyes while doing that helps alot with shutting off your brain and being in tune with your body.

And the same can be said about your dog. Start off with being in the same room as her. Then letting her get close to her. Then petting her all the while ""turning your brain off"". We believe in you and you believe in yourself, you just need some motivation. And you can help turn your brain off and focus on your body with light exercises like stretching or yoga in your room."
SuicideWatch,fcuxalg,t1_fcutuop,1577990388.0,"I read your other post and I would recommend you move out as soon as you can because your parents are the main trigger of your problems. Unfortunately, your girlfriend is in another country so you can't really move that far. If your friends are local, I would suggest you move in with them instead. If that's not possible, maybe there are shelters or communities that take in people in your situation in your city because I really feel your OCD would improve if you moved out of your parents home. Now, I'm glad you have privacy because you can research these things without them knowing and once you're ready to move out, they can't really stop you, unless there is some court order that you have to deal with before moving out.

Also, I know you feel disgusted by it (again, many women feel this way too) I suggest you continue to explore your body. Your body knows what it wants and generally it is right. You admitted that it felt good and it got you to love your body again until your OCD told you to hate that feeling. So I recommend the next time you do it, just ""shut your brain off"" and listen to your body instead of your brain. Your brain is compromised sexually so it bombards you with feelings of shame, disgust, impurity and POCD. Just make it a routine of 1-2 times a day and I know you can overcome that negative feeling because it will become more natural to you."
SuicideWatch,fcurtci,t1_fctq54o,1577987201.0,"Hey, you're helping me as well! Before now, the only thing about OCD I knew about it that it causes people to clean alot or repeat things because they don't think they did it the ""right way"". But thanks to talking to you, I have a better understanding of the different forms of OCD as well as learning about Golden Child Syndrome, Depersonalization disorder and dog behavior. So let's continue to help each other out!

I was puzzled as to why you would continue to fear your dad since you're in your 20's and have a girlfriend. Then I found out from your other posts that you still live with your parents and it all makes sense to me. You are stuck between a rock and a hard place where your OCD prevents you from moving out, but staying makes the OCD stronger because of how your parents mistreat you. You rely on them, but at the same time they are controlling, which makes you feel worse about yourself. If I was to guess, your Depersonalization disorder started when your dad would hit you for minor things like messing up on homework. And since they put so much undue pressure on you, it caused a vicious cycle of stress, depression, and self harm because you didn't want to fail and disappoint them. But when you do, you would punish yourself physically because that's how your dad would do you. 

Then add on how your dad would shame you for not wearing underwear, not talking to you about sex, letting you feel that your privates are something to be ashamed of and sexualizing your dog's actions warped your brain into thinking that sexual behavior is impure and a negative instead of natural and positive. I hope you can understand that what you're feeling is a result of awful situations that were out of your control in your childhood. Judging by how active you are in this conversation as well as other posts, you are capable of managing the OCD where it doesn't control your life. And you show that you are willing to do it, you just need support and reassurance from others outside of your family like your girlfriend, therapist, me, Reddit users and the the rest of internet. Sorry about getting a bit preachy there, but this is a breakthrough to getting to the root of all your problems (in my opinion). Also it's a way to craft a plan to reduce the power of your OCD so you can enjoy your life with your dog and girlfriend. So here's some more questions:

You mentioned in another post you don't go out much. How did you meet your girlfriend and does she have her own place or does she live with you and your parents?

Do you have privacy in your home? As in, can you close your bedroom door without your parents busting in while you're in the middle of something?

You said you first explored your body (on accident) 3 years ago. Have you done it again since then? If not, would you do it if you knew for sure no one would catch you doing it and it still felt good?"
SuicideWatch,fct9mm5,t1_fct2nx6,1577936592.0,"I don't find you gross, but we may have found the cause of your depersonalization disorder. So you've been hating your body since at least 8 years old to the point where you cut yourself down there because you thought it was disgusting. And to this day, you find sex disgusting and don't like seeing people naked. You're actually not alone on that part. There's surveys were more women found sex disgusting than men. But when they become aroused that feeling goes away. Unfortunately, your (assumed) sexual repression keeps that feeling of disgust going and things like arousal and private parts are impure. We're almost there (I hope) to finding the root cause of your situation, so here's some more questions:

You hated your body at 8 didn't know about sex until 16 and didn't explore your body until 3 years ago. When was the first time you became aroused and what was it over?

When your dad hit you, what would he hit you with? Where would he do it? Did he give a reason why?

You say you was the Golden Child. Was you a only child or did you have siblings? If you do have siblings, did they go through the same things you did?"
SuicideWatch,fcsmczm,t1_fcsa29l,1577919618.0,"I'm glad you're finding this conversation helpful. I've heard of circumstances similar to yours sexualizing things that people generally don't find sexual. So if my experience of witnessing these things can help you manage your OCD where you can give your dog belly rubs without issues, that would be great for you and your dog.

So you was the perfect child who did no wrong and was pure in heart and soul. You was repulsed by sex and was uncomfortable with getting aroused. Then at 16, I'm assuming nature took over and your natural hormones and sexuality couldn't be repressed anymore. But, since no one talked to you about sex treating it as a natural and positive thing, you brain ended up sexualizing your dog thanks to your grandma's comments and that other thing. We're getting closer to the root of your OCD and how to manage it, so lets keep this dialogue going with some more questions:

What exactly was it about sex that repulsed you and why?

What is it about your body do you hate and did you feel this way before or after the cuts?

Why did you fear your dad and do you still fear him?"
LadyBoners,fcqm9bu,t1_fcpmm4b,1577888494.0,Glad to hear you're kicking off 2020 right!
SuicideWatch,fcp6h3j,t1_fcox9u5,1577852053.0,"1. I looked up dogs laying on feet and mainly it means she's claiming you or showing affection. However, dogs do ""get themselves off"", especially if they been spayed or neutered, so they do feel pleasure. It's mostly harmless since many animals do that by licking themselves or rubbing on something. But it seems that your grandma attached a negative, shameful bias to a perfectly normal, non-sexual behavior your dog did. And since this happened in your teens, it stuck with you with your dad adding to it by making sexual jokes about her. People who come from a sexually repressed background tend to consider sexual acts to be shameful even though it's generally a natural thing. 
2. I could see how 69 jokes could be applied since your dog has little fur down there and it could be compared to human behavior. And since your grandma made it sexuality taboo for you, his jokes makes you think about it more, which causes you to feel shame for impure thoughts (I'm assuming).
3. What I meant about physical arousal is, excuse my French, wetness down there. If the first sexual thing you learned was from your grandma (wrongly) attributing it to your dog's belly, then I'm not surprised your brain is creating sexual thoughts about your dog showing her belly. It's not ""normal"" but it's not threatening either because you're not actually attracted to your dog. Your brain is sort of using her as a proxy for the human body since her fur is shorter and her privates are noticeable like a human.
4. Generally a person starts thinking about private parts due to noticing them on other people or themselves. But since your dog has short fur, you're noticed them like you would a human. Again, I think this might have to with sexual repression but I'm not sure yet. For instance, I started to notice boobs when I was about 12 because my aunt cleaned her CD with her shirt and I saw her bra. I had to learn about sex pretty much by myself because I didn't get ""The Talk"" and I looked through old magazines my cousin hid under his bed. So when I see that dog food commercial where his thing is just swinging around as he runs or that phone commercial where the camera zooms in on a dogs butt in slomo, I notice these things, but I'm not reacting to it because I don't really consider sexual thoughts to be shameful. Especially if you're not gonna act on them.

So in other words, your sexual thoughts about your dog might have to do with sexual repression since you seem uncomfortable mentioning pleasure for your dog and yourself. So I ask: 

Did you come from a background where sex is taboo? 

Was your dad making sex jokes about your dog before you actually learned about sex or afterwards? 

Do you consider talking about sex among humans to be shameful or taboo? If so, why?"

When was the first time you had sexual thoughts about your dog?

What exactly about that position caused you to have sexual thoughts?

Was it only sexual thoughts or was there also physical arousal?

Are the thoughts limited to just your dog or other dogs in that position?

SuicideWatch,fcoh3d0,t1_fco8yxy,1577832074.0,"So let's review, you have OCD and you know you have it where it causes you to have false memories. It's also causing you to think about certain things you know is wrong but it pops up in your head anyway when you look at it. As a result, you consider yourself a bad person even though you haven't acted on your thoughts and never will.

This could be hard, but you might have to completely explain what is it about those particular characteristics that's causing you to hate yourself. Explain in full detail what exactly your false memories is showing you. In other words, confront your fears. Like a person walking under a ladder or a black cat, the only way it seems for you to get peace is to talk about what the OCD is showing you.

Being vague only reinforce your fear and gives more power to the OCD because, I'm assuming, you're avoiding whatever is making you upset. So what are the exact details the false memories are causing you to think you are a bad person?"

You're having those thoughts, but you know not to act on it because that's not who you really are. As for the other flavor of OCD, it seems like a more extreme version of Furrieness.
