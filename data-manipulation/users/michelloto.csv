I didn't believe it, not completely, but not being the most desirable dude in eighth grade, I couldn't completely dismiss it. Our classes weren't co-ed, so the only time you got to talk to a girl was in a special class like 'Guidance', or the library or after school... what they didn't know is that my cousin was also in her division. So before I made a fool of myself, I asked about that girl, was she trying to meet me? She was cute, by the way.  Well, of course, she wasn't...but we agreed to turn the prank on them. She met me by my locker before class started, and we started talking while they were looking. Then these clowns started to laugh...and she turned around and said, ""What are you laughing about? This is my man here, what's so funny??"" The looks on their faces..."
