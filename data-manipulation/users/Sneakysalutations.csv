facepalm,ffjkx0k,t3_etsmxb,1580000589.0,These are the morons that want me to pay for their healthcare..
Futurology,ffg4of6,t3_et7pc6,1579898387.0,"I don’t think throwing money to our government will ever fix it. It’s up to us. 

I recently bought a motorcycle and drive that whenever I can over my truck. I have electric golf cart for the neighborhood. I hunt and fish a lot of my own food. I use my own well water to drink. I don’t use single serve plastics / paper if possible. I pick up trash in the river if I see it etc. 

We can actually save our planet ourselves. Why do we always look to morons in suits to answer our problems when they’re always the cause? They just want our money."
China,ffd74cj,t1_ffcqwtz,1579814715.0,"Majority US society will embrace you if you embrace our culture! American isn't a color or facial feature, it's a set of ideas that you subscribe too. Sadly many of our countrymen would rather form a government akin to china where the government has more control in our daily lives. I want the opposite."

sports,fewpzys,t1_fewnrtl,1579417764.0,No like drugged the fuck up. She was hopping around and her winners speech was like a meth head speaking to the cops.
Futurology,fejorel,t3_epa9c8,1579181880.0,That’s why I live in the country with nothing but a few houses and a gas station.

MrRobot,fczw107,t3_ejjh0w,1578109575.0,"3 layers of inception. ""what happened, happened"" but only in MM's head. Real Elliot (the one we never met who awoke at the very very end) was in a coma the entire time. 

The death of Tyrell was him letting go of his loop and Awakening from his coma. 

I think that there is a Tyrell in real Elliot's world that may have tried to murder Elliot (hence the coma) and that is why he is such a central figure in MM's world."
facepalm,fczqx8t,t3_ejm5kq,1578107086.0,All I can say is had Hilary won we'd have already been knee deep in some WW3 with Russia over Syria. Lib shits have been saying the sky is falling for three years and we're doing better than ever.
DrainTheSwamp,fc7cc1u,t1_fc5b6f6,1577503284.0,It's literally the lowest form of debate and liberals love to use it. You have to ignore them at that point and realize you're dealing with a retarded child most likely.
