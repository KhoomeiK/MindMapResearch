Jonathan Torrens, a weird talking PEI kid. So nonthreatening that most people forget he exists about half an hour after he is on the clicker box. 

He was on the Degrassi, they had him on Street Scents, He got he's own show called Jonovision at one point. But by far his most famous role has been as Jroc on the Trailer Park Boys. Nova Scotia's only non fish, snow or apple, based export. 

As Canadians on the east coast, this kid just followed us around like a little brother who was kind of annoying but your Mudder wouldn't let ya leave him home cause she had baking to do or some shit and so along comes fucking Jono lagging behind picking his nose until it bleeds and then crying about it on the sidewalk while you has to ask the neighbor to borrows he's garden hose to wash off the dumbasses bloody face.. 

I mean it's not like he had the commercial success of say.. ya know he is doing better than that one guy.

The Lead in ""You'll never guess my secret identity."" A superhero show years back. He was in that show ""Sliders"" which was not Infact about small burgers but rather inter-dimensional travel. 
He has been in multiple movies and tv shows, he is apparently attractive to women.
Unlike Jono, he doesn't look like he could get knocked out by a month old marshmallow, thrown by a geriatric nursing home resident. 

But for the life of me.. I don't know that guy's name.

Though I might mistakenly refer to Jono as Taylor Thomas sometimes, because of the time frame he comes from in my memory.

Of all the childhood tv show characters and actors I recall. Jonathan Torrens was definitely the last one I ever expected to still either be alive or still working.

He just kind of kept showing up and we kept letting him.. 

But soon I forget he exists and all will be right with the world again.

Edit: Jerry O'Connell

Looking at a map for most of my life growing up in the Atlantic provinces and pouring over the sagas both of Eric the red and the greenlanders. I've been unable to come to a valid conclusion on where each location is. 

The best clue is white sandy beaches in Markland. Which though the western coast of Newfoundland has such, it is not quite as warm as the sagas tell. Able to leave cattle out during the winter. Although again, compared to Greenland, it would be balmy weather. 

I've considered Nova Scotia and the island of Cape Breton as possible locations as well and of course Prince Edward Island but the beaches there are red. 

It is a puzzle I've always come back to over the years. I suspect though you are correct in thinking there is an unknown settlement in Nova Scotia. The Annapolis Valley, is one of the most fertile places on the planet. The way humans go through native species, it is entirely possible the Vikings completely devoured a native species of grape in the area leaving no evidence of it.

If I was an archeological student I would be digging through old outhouses in Greenland looking for unknown seeds. And checking the lumber of ships to see what specific tree they were made from if they were built in Greenland. As Greenland relied mostly on drift wood and imported wood. That would leave a good indication of the location the trees came from as obviously there are huge differences even between provincial lines here in Canada. 

I've also found human footprints in solid stone in a place called ""flatrock"" in Newfoundland. As Helluland was described as flat I has always tickled my interest that, L'Anse aux Meadows could very well be the least enjoyable of the Vikings settlements. 

Then again.. if Bjarney is Cape Breton then Newfoundland would be Markland? Who knows really.
