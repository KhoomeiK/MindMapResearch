medizzy,ffc86r1,t1_ffbfiax,1579793759.0,"My earliest memory is of sitting on my grandma's lap in the front passenger seat of a car while my grandpa drove, no seatbelts involved. In the memory grandma was more worried about keeping the sun out of my eyes as we went to wherever we were going. 

 I was born in '83 and grandpa died in February of '85, so I was still in diapers for that. 

Then in elementary school, my friend's dad had a pick up and us kids would sit in the bed of the truck while he drove us to the pool or wherever in the summer. Can't even fathom doing that now as an adult, let alone letting my kid do that sort of thing. The only safety thing I can recall we ever actually followed through on from childhood was that same friend's dad having us wear a helmet when he took us for rides on his motorcycle."
