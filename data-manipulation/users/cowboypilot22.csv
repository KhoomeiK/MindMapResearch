The Ranger is far different from Midway, their dive bombers aren't nearly as dangerous as T9 or T10."

Hurting a Judges fee fees and disrespecting them isn't all that serious actually.  It can be a ""serious thing"" for poor people and still 100% be a power trip, ask our police."
WoWsBlitz,fg6lpjy,t1_fg5dpjo,1580571253.0,"OP hasn't had a problem with them either because of great positioning around ships with actual AA, or sheer dumb luck. I've wrecked several Musashis in my Taiho, and I've been targeted several times by good CVs while in my own Musashi.

It has *really* bad AA stats, stats that any good CV are going to exploit.  Her large caliber AA only does 170 damage,  with small caliber not being any better.  For some perspective the T6 BB Bayern does 179 damage with large caliber. And the Bayern definitely isn't  known for having good AA protection (even for its own tier).

Any good CV is going to know that the Musashi has *terrible* AA and take advantage of that.  It's a giant T9 ship running with T6 AA after all.

Edit - salt from the ~~scrubs~~ users that follow me around in this subreddit don't change facts.  The Musashi has bad AA."
