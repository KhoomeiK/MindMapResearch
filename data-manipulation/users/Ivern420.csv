leagueoflegends,ffy17r9,t3_evlthw,1580336535.0,At least you ever had friends to play with... Nobody I know plays. They all play Smite and I really don't enjoy smite remotely.
funny,ffxyn7i,t1_fftdz3z,1580335003.0,I honestly think its hilarious how many people would be cool with this lol.
FireflyFestival,ffxqzsq,t1_ffvvn29,1580330697.0,this is why I'm trying to get my friends on the RV train lol. I'm a great cook and we could probably avoid spending any money on food at all. Plus a lot of them are vegan or vegetarian so it would be convenient.
gaybros,ffxfwv2,t3_evobvh,1580324339.0,Which is crazy cause I only like my boys thick or chunky or thick and chunky.
vegan,ffw15b5,t1_ffvkflj,1580279996.0,So I do pretty much exactly this. I use a Ziploc bag with both sides but not the hinge cut( if that makes sense) then I press the ball down with a pot or pan til it's a thickness i like
aww,ffw11ip,t1_ffulhmd,1580279886.0,If it looks that much like a Pokemon. Probably not real.
funny,ffvw9me,t3_evfmuz,1580275179.0,Generalizations help no one. Generalization culture is just getting so old.

vegan,ffsz4xz,t1_ffsv1ra,1580198680.0,They are super easy and quick to make. I dont have a press I just use a big pot.
funny,ffsspw1,t1_ffsge26,1580191069.0,For interviews and stuff this is pretty normal sans the nails but shows and everyday not really.

bon_appetit,ffpvtk8,t1_ffn5vkx,1580107661.0,"Maybe frowned upon but always up the saturation in food picks to make them look ""warmer"". They will look more akin to how you see them IRL."
PoliticalHumor,ffgcfey,t1_ffgb33h,1579903149.0,Whooosh
bon_appetit,ffgbr2s,t1_ffg3j07,1579902739.0,"Yeah. I've made this based on Molly's recipe and it is very balanced.

Edit: as an add on I think the added sugar leads to more pleasing caramelization on the outside as well."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffa16ku,t3_esb7k7,1579725810.0,Yes because slave were paid millions of dollars a year....

food,ff1th1l,t1_ff0ysuj,1579485808.0,I wouldn't say underrated. Maybe underrepresented.
eatsandwiches,fetra3r,t3_eqbf2f,1579378789.0,Looks pretty good but I really don't get having a sandwich with so much on it you cant even bite it.
leagueoflegends,feo7hwp,t1_fen8h2u,1579296200.0,The league that hasn't existed in years? Lol

EntitledBitch,fe606kz,t1_fe6036o,1578878843.0,You should probably switch over to facebook. Seems more your style.
EntitledBitch,fe5zzxg,t1_fe5yha4,1578878722.0,How many times are you gonna respond to my comment lmao
EntitledBitch,fe5zy79,t1_fe5ys6r,1578878690.0,So not the comment I responded to?
EntitledBitch,fe5fil3,t1_fe570de,1578868870.0,TBF a lot of places probably don't carry all the ingredients to those lol. Though it's definitely possible to substitute here and there to wind up with a similar product.
EntitledBitch,fe56oey,t1_fe48roo,1578866087.0,"Yeah I did miss that because no where in your comment do you say ""minimum wage should be raised""."
EntitledBitch,fe563t5,t1_fe4bgb4,1578865989.0,That's reasonable and usually what I do if I'm out for drinks unless I'm getting some kind of crazy cocktail.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fe55sdd,t3_enmodp,1578865895.0,Who?
EntitledBitch,fe48r3m,t1_fe3jtzk,1578856872.0,You realise the cost of paying employees is factored into all goods? So the cost of paying wages is always passed on to the customer?
EntitledBitch,fe4878d,t1_fe3zot8,1578856690.0,"Because wait staff and bartender's wind up making more then minimum wage if they're good at their job. There is no way in hell I would continue to work where I do for minimum wage. Minimum wage isn't remotely accurate compensation for the knowledge, training, and service that goes into what I do. 

For example I made about $1000 over the course of 30-35 hours this week. So about 30$/hr. Minimum wage in my state is 10$/hr. So you're cutting my wages down to 1/3 my original pay."
EntitledBitch,fe46e3r,t1_fe2lbna,1578856196.0,As a bartender it has never ever bothered me to get a 10% tip. Is it a bit disappointing? Yeah but there are a myriad of reasons the person could have for it so it's not worth getting upset about it.
EntitledBitch,fe45cpz,t1_fe43l60,1578855954.0,Depends on the culture.

gay_irl,fdpw3db,t1_fdpt566,1578642918.0,This is what I tell myself so that I don't even join a gym. I doubt anyone would want to deal with me intimately as a person. Honestly could not see myself spending everyday for the rest of my life with someone. That sounds fucking insane to just be with one person or anyone or everyone forever. Leave me in a dark box with a PC I'm good . /Endrant
bon_appetit,fdk8gqi,t1_fdiylg4,1578498461.0,It's delicious and the recipe is extremely easy. I've made it a couple times myself.

gaybros,fdh6xvd,t1_fdf0w4r,1578416705.0,"Please.... I've had gay men tell me I have internalized homophobia because ""I don't act gay enough"". Not sure what that is even supposed to mean but there are plenty of toxic members of the community that think if you aren't out in a jock strap and rainbow wig once a week than you basically aren't gay or as good as other gay men."
