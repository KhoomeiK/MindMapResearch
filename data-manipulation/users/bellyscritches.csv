Narcolepsy,ffc7ex0,t3_espvh7,1579793265.0,"This is fairly common in narcoleptics. My doctor told me it's a combination of anxiety, stimulants during the day, and -especially- because of our whacked up sleep cycles. Sometimes it's not just about feeling sleepy all the time; sometimes it just flips so you're sleepy during the day but awake at night. I was on the Judy Garland diet for many years. Sleeping pills at night, and caffeine/nuvigil in the day. It took me breaking down in panicked sobs in front of the doctors nurse before I even heard the word xyrem."
AmItheAsshole,ffao7qm,t3_esfxc0,1579740580.0,"ESH. You're a casual babysitter, not a licensed daycare. Professionals barely get minimum wage, and they have to pay taxes. If you factor in what you should be paying for in taxes, I'd say you probably are getting paid minimum wage. Keep in mind, also, that most minimum wage jobs don't let you study at work. You've admitted the father doesn't trust daycares because he was molested,and you knew that you'd be screwing them if you left. JFC that's a low blow. That being said, they should have given you a bonus for the extended childcare while they went on vacation."
Narcolepsy,ff2uhe1,t1_ff29zcc,1579524648.0,"Yes absolutely! I thought you were implying they were one in the same. It's a horrible reputation to have for a drug that's helped so many people, myself included. I suppose the same could be said for a lot of drugs, though."
Narcolepsy,ff1oqqw,t1_ff1m5bg,1579482815.0,"You're right that GHB is a date rape drug. But xyrem isn't GHB. It's sodium oxybate, and there is a huge difference. Mainly that GHB is synthetic and uncontrolled, whereas sodium oxybate is pure and controlled. There are many articles out there that highlight the difference. Here is one if you're curious.

Narcolepsy,fezqkkn,t3_eqrrp0,1579460397.0,It's not the date rape drug.
AmItheAsshole,fey994d,t3_eqri9u,1579442413.0,"ESH. It wasn't a real bar, and a kid has every right to be there unless there were signs/rules to the contrary. And you have every right to speak freely; it's a restaurant, not a daycare. So y'all were both wrong."
Narcolepsy,fexwkx4,t1_fewf0bd,1579437661.0,See how broth works for you. I think anything chunky could be iffy with absorbtion.
Narcolepsy,few0s1j,t3_eqk1ov,1579403842.0,"Are you talking about broth? Or, like, lobster bisque?"
Narcolepsy,fero3ap,t3_eqg40e,1579356360.0,"If you have blue or green eyes you could be more sensitive. Also,if you look at screens a lot your eyes could be strained and cause sensitivity. Look into those blue light blocking glasses. Those should help."
Narcolepsy,fegrz4c,t3_eoxiro,1579101157.0,There's no such thing as a 30 minute nap for me. More like 2 hours.
Narcolepsy,feel4kq,t1_feehd1d,1579035956.0,"In my sleep study, I spent 30% time in REM (average is 20%) so it definitely didn't suppress for me."
Narcolepsy,feeeezp,t3_eopu2g,1579032049.0,"Same happened to me. I failed so many times my doctor finally gave me sleeping pills to fall asleep for the overnight. He said it's perfectly fine to have a sleeping pill because they're studying your cycles and stuff, and you need to be asleep to do that. HOW you fall asleep isn't the issue. I slept the whole night, got tons of information, and stayed for the mslt. And since I have narcolepsy, I was still tired for the mslt because I wasn't going into deep sleep on the overnight. I fell asleep on all five naps.

Tldr; get ambian for your overnight sleep study!"

Narcolepsy,fdsfn30,t3_emwuv4,1578701676.0,"I'm in USA. I don't have cataplexy, and xyrem has changed my life. I'm sorry you can't at least try it. Or suddenly develop cataplexy symptoms."
Narcolepsy,fdc7qyy,t1_fdc3c8m,1578268750.0,"I do not have cataplexy. And I still get that rush in the form of caffeine. Before when I drank coffee it was a minor boost. But now I definitely feel it kick in. That could be enough to work as your signal. Plus, you're probably still going to be on stimulants for a while after. My doctor prescribed me xyrem in addition to provigil."
Narcolepsy,fd4drgx,t3_ek0vkj,1578166678.0,"Similar experience. I went through countless stimulants and was disappointed with them all. They did help in a way, but not really a miracle cure. Eventually (and only very recently) one of the nurses suggested xyrem. She said that I'm not responding to stimulants because that's not what my body needs fixed. She was right. My awakeness wasn't the problem. It was my sleeping. I was sleeping so much but none of it was quality sleep. Enter xyrem. After a few weeks, I was waking up on my own and didn't need a stimulant during the day. It was so eye opening for me when this nurse pointed it out. **You could try a million brands of antacid, but they still wouldn't heal a migraine.**"
Narcolepsy,fd01tnq,t3_ejj9v0,1578112388.0,Good days are finding the energy for loading the dishwasher. Bad days are paper plates and plastic cutlery.
FosterAnimals,fcax0u6,t1_fcau9xa,1577578289.0,Yes I second the advice on talking to him. Sometimes I like to read a book out loud.
FosterAnimals,fcarhx6,t3_egxsbm,1577575190.0,Give him a few days to acclimate to his new environment. But definitely don't stay away from him for two weeks. A huge part of foster care is socializing. His forever family needs to hear about his personality. Try giving him a blanket or t-shirt that smells like you to get him used to your scent. Then you can sit in the room with him for a while. Never try to corner him. He'll come to you when he's ready.
savedyouaclick,fb7u31t,t1_fb604qa,1576599403.0,He wasn't.
