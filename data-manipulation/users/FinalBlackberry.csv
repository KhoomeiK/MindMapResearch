You would still need a can and electrical wiring but in case you ever redecorate you don’t have to take the actual picture light off and patch up the walls. 
Anything battery operated would require you to constantly be on a ladder changing batteries.

They automatically receive 20% off, it is their choice if they want to pass the discount on to their clients or have us charge retail and write them a check for the 20%. BUT we have to know. Designers have to call us ahead. 

Recently, I gave a lady that didn't mention her designer nor did the designer call ahead a discount, which I am allowed to do ( not the full 20% but anywhere from 5-15% ) she wondered why her designer quoted her more and ended up purchasing directly from me. Needless to say, she was angry that she didn't make her 20% cut. 

I say all that to say this, your client was sneaky and shouldn't have done that. However, you're cutting the vendor too much slack. Someone over there didn't do their job properly and allowed her to buy without providing an account number. And trust me they do have a clue, just don't want to be held accountable. 

Your best bet is to set firm boundaries with your clients. I would have her return the fixture, have the vendor issue a refund and then give her the option to either purchase from you directly or from the vendor at full retail price."

Check your weekly sales papers for meat sales and stock up (if chicken is on sale, I purchase an extra pack and freeze it), soups and stews go a long way. We make minestrone often with frozen veggies and cans. And freeze the left overs. Pasta is relatively cheap and you can do lots of different recipes. We do buy $3 loafs of bread because I enjoy it with preserves. I usually shop around for fruit sales as well. All veggies are frozen unless we buy potatoes or salad stuff.

You are not responsible to set your SK up for the future. Again, that falls on your SO and BM. And you shouldn't feel guilty that your biological kids have a plan. You can fully encourage it but that's about as far as I would go."

I was in a similar situation where I just felt sad that my kid was growing up. It wasnâ€™t extreme to the point where I couldnâ€™t let go of objects but I just felt sad the more he became independent. You can absolutely have codependency issues with your children as well. 
I realized early on that I would have a hard time letting go as he is getting older. Therapy has helped tremendously.

I would most likely grow resentful and feel like a not so great parent to my own, nor would I want to parent someone else's children without parenting mine.

As someone who works in a lighting showroom that carries fans I wouldnâ€™t suggest cleaning indoor fans that are not damp rated or wet rated with water. 
Youâ€™re risking water getting into the motor, regardless of how careful you are. 
If it causes malfunction it voids your warranty, even having your fan installed by someone who is not a licensed electrician voids your warranty with most manufacturers. 
Also fan blades warp with moisture. I live in Houston and lots of people affected by Hurricane Harvey came in for replacement blades because the humidity and moisture made their fan blades warp. 
If you need to clean the motor I would suggest using the extension of a vacuum. It really does get a lot of dust out."

FrugalFemaleFashion,fdf4lyp,t1_fdf1ugg,1578353187.0,"I actually read your entire post. I'm sorry, but when you ask strangers on the internet for opinions you will get their ""two sense"". 
People told you that it was legit, you got defensive for whatever reason and started to insult people. Well, ShoeDazzle has been around for at least a decade now, that alone should tell you they are legit, a brainless person would know that too, right?
Your hostile comments were unnecessary towards both me and that lady you called brainless simply because she told you the shoes were not warm. 
Have a great evening, cheer up a little or stop asking for opinions on the internet."

AskWomenOver30,fde7lia,t3_ekw0bb,1578332933.0,"Laxative teas work. 

Dandelion Tea worked as a detox, I noticed because It made me drink more water. I'm fairly certain it's a diuretic. 

Same with Cranberry Tea for UTI's . 

I have a friend with gorgeous skin. She swears it's the fact that she switched from coffee to tea. She drinks several cups throughout the day."

stepparents,fcgur2n,t1_fcg5y67,1577644192.0,"Why would an old phone be less stressful on you than the newest phone she decided to buy him? Why does it matter if itâ€™s nicer than either of yours? You are under no obligation to replace it if it breaks or gets lost. 
If you are strongly against it, make it a no phone rule on your time and available only at her house. If she needs to get in touch with him she should be able to do so through the adults."
