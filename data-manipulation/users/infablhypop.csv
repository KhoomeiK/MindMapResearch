movies,ffe1ym6,t3_esxzj6,1579834594.0,"I love Fury Road and it's artistic portrayal of these themes.

But big cars, big dicks, big wallets, etc. is a classic case of sexual selection, i.e what females have sought in sexual partners over millions of years. No one really looks great when you break life down like this."
webdev,ffcjrcf,t1_ffc0fvr,1579800945.0,"I went through that once. There is actually a way to do it online, its just unintuitive, and they tell you how to do it when you call. They just want to make it inconvenient and get a sales rep in your ear to convince you to stay."
wholesomememes,ff6htk6,t1_ff5t1m7,1579627506.0,Maybe you’re the best version of yourself up to this point. You can still improve from here.
softwaregore,feok938,t1_fenyt1f,1579301365.0,You'll never guess what happens next.
KerbalSpaceProgram,fed1xs6,t1_fecochq,1578994625.0,He demonstrated that putting them at the top is no better or worse than putting them at the bottom. So top is still fair game.
AskReddit,fecwylr,t1_fecuam3,1578987951.0,Wow. Thanks for sharing.
interestingasfuck,fecuw51,t3_eof992,1578985568.0,Probably because it reminds you of your impending mortality.

news,febkkp9,t1_feacgx6,1578959774.0,Seems like you could raise it like they did for Chicago.
AskReddit,febjlrx,t3_eo5orh,1578959498.0,If the colors you see are the same as the colors I see.
space,feb4ejs,t1_feb2tvb,1578955320.0,The new and full phases (or spans between them) aren’t arbitrary because they are the min and max.
space,feaibc1,t1_feah6ov,1578949132.0,Oh I never knew quarter moons delineated a phase.
space,feag466,t1_feaaj3s,1578948255.0,So why not 4 day weeks? Or 14 day weeks for that matter? Is your sensible moon phase math a post hoc explanation?
space,feafh1x,t1_fea20cw,1578948062.0,What do you mean by phase?
funny,fdye32s,t1_fdyc92w,1578778731.0,My point is that transpreading might refer to the spread of charge across a transistor. You never know.
funny,fdyb2ti,t1_fdxikln,1578777916.0,Transvestite and transgender are two different things but they both start with “trans”.

science,fdoyzvx,t3_emfgha,1578616104.0,"Cats seemed to understand when another animal was in need, but then failed the part of the test were they actually gave assistance."
aww,fdkihtl,t1_fdjusk6,1578504501.0,It seems you were right all along. Now if everyone would kindly reverse their votes.
evolution,fdkgn0f,t1_fdjcsx1,1578503463.0,It’s confusing but OP means a normally functioning brain will deteriorate without sleep while it’s possible for a disfunctional brain to continue just fine. So we don’t need sleep in theory. But why then do our brains arbitrarily force it on us?

biology,fdh4pt2,t1_fdh2ui7,1578415332.0,The main sources of genetic variation are random such as random errors in copying DNA which happens every time a cell divides or random combination of genes during reproduction.
biology,fdh2ay1,t1_fdh1d3e,1578413845.0,"Yes, since it’s driven by randomness as well as selection. If there’s no selection pressure to “clean up” genuinely useless DNA then it can stick around indefinitely."

Physics,fdedsex,t3_ekerj7,1578336827.0,One common thread throughout physics seems to be the Principle of Least Action.
energy,fd40wrg,t1_fd30zcn,1578163373.0,Yeah charging at home (and rarely anywhere else) was the best part of my EV experience.
YangForPresidentHQ,fczhoq4,t3_ejmhxm,1578101486.0,I don’t blame you. They are the best hats.

oddlysatisfying,fcyjxai,t1_fcy5lyu,1578081335.0,Yes.

pics,fcmur09,t1_fcmtuc1,1577793222.0,You don’t. But how often do you get mail that isn’t properly addressed to a person? I can’t say I’ve ever gotten mail that didn’t have a name or “current resident”.
DunderMifflin,fcmr7gu,t1_fcm3z9e,1577788219.0,Every frame of that film is cursed.
AskReddit,fcmql2o,t3_ehrop4,1577787327.0,Miso soup/ramen.
AskReddit,fcmlb5i,t1_fclz3pr,1577780052.0,"I have the stereotypical inclination to not share negative emotions, but I honestly don't get the impression that society made me this way. Have you ever shared your problems with a guy only to have them try to provide solutions instead of commiserating? Being the kind of person that tries to find solutions, I have the sense that I should only share my problems with another person if I think they can help provide a solution. If the problem is internal, I might feel like I'm the only one that can solve it and so there's no reason to share it with others. Also, sharing a problem with someone that they can't help solve seems like it would just be frustrating for both parties. It feels like just spreading the misery around."
pics,fcmgkds,t1_fcm8wii,1577774448.0,"Should have marked it with ""not at this address"". How to handle it from there is the Post Office's concern not yours. Don't open other peoples' mail."
pics,fcmg6ne,t3_ehtkfg,1577774045.0,Opening other peoples' mail is a federal crime. And just because it has your address doesn't mean it's your mail.
funny,fcmfunx,t3_ehtvb6,1577773699.0,What a terribly designed vehicle.
AskReddit,fcmetp5,t1_fcm4n1t,1577772653.0,Bit of a difference between posting your own nudes publicly and having private content hacked.
todayilearned,fckzru6,t1_fckf4gn,1577736700.0,It’s flawed.
interestingasfuck,fcha7v0,t1_fcgn30p,1577648680.0,"It's not exactly accurate... The difference between the LALP diagram and the HALP appears to be an increase in precision, not an increase in accuracy. For demonstration purposes the spread of the shots should really be about the same for all low precision diagrams, and the LALP diagram should be more off-center instead of spread about the center."
programming,fc4zvri,t1_fc4ow5r,1577435911.0,Even if your tests are just code that corroborates other code they have some value in that sense. One advantage of unit tests is that that you can have more numerous simple unit tests and fewer complex integration tests to achieve a similar level of confidence which can run faster and be easier to maintain in most cases.
programming,fc4zi1q,t1_fc4jb1j,1577435363.0,Probably like those memes were the unit tests pass but the integration tests fail.
todayilearned,fc4ct1q,t1_fc41yel,1577412946.0,Veganism is positively medieval then. :P
todayilearned,fc3zq05,t1_fc3xrdu,1577402824.0,"Thanks for that. I knew calling it ancient was a risk, but I wasn't sure."
todayilearned,fc3gn0o,t1_fc3e49a,1577389374.0,So even veganism is ancient.
fusion,fbtqsh5,t1_fbt73nk,1577090864.0,The basic premise is just that mass-energy equivalence applies to sound waves which seems reasonable.
