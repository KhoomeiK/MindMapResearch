This likely already has happened by anyone who bought first with the low prices being maintained.

Restricting the price from increasing only makes sense if there are enough masks for everyone, which there aren't. The masks only work effectively for 8 hours each on top of that so how many masks per person would you even allow?

Advice,fftijj9,t3_ev0gua,1580221471.0,"Hi, so i worked retail for a few years before and honestly you arent the only one this happens to. Not only did it happen to me too but also a younger chick who i was close with. Black people are just as racist as anyone else regardless of how they are always made out to be the victims of racism in modern media. They also always fall back on the ""its because im black"" excuse - happened to me because they didnt like the price of luggages, because i didnt help a guy and his girlfriend on my break, just endless nonsense that turns into a ""because im black"" situation.

The managers at the place i worked were African and even theyyy were biased against black people after having continuous bad experiences.

Working at retail will mentally drain you and you are going to meet the worst people in your area so just keep that in mind. You aren't becoming racist imo, just reacting to how things are. After you leave retail you'll forget all about this for the most part. Just focus on the people who are nice.

Also - STOP doing people favors like price changes. Fuck that. I've seen a girl get fired because she gave someone a lower price, there was no one to go check and it was super busy, next day the customer came in to return the item and wanted the full price on the tag as their refund. Don't ""help"" people like that, just so your job and focus on getting out of there and moving on with your life. All the best."
