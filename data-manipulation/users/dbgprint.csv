playrust,ffbnl1i,t1_ffbnj6h,1579774378.0,"Yes, but it is far from as easily accessible as scripting currently is on PC so you probably will never know."
softwaregore,ffbkppo,t3_esqhkk,1579769974.0,Yes
playrust,ffbkner,t3_esore4,1579769878.0,"I agree. Also, there really won’t be any cheaters or scripters."
IllegalLifeProTips,ffbd2oa,t1_ffb7i72,1579760249.0,Well said

YouShouldKnow,ff411et,t1_ff4101w,1579553213.0,I never implied it either. You seem to have some issues.
YouShouldKnow,ff40r1b,t1_ff40p7w,1579553031.0,Ok??? I never said most people won’t be OK with 8GB.... jesus christ
YouShouldKnow,ff40f45,t1_ff40beh,1579552823.0,"Not sure why you’re downvoting me, I’m not disagreeing with what you are saying at all I’m just saying that amount of RAM *can* speed up your computer a lot..."
YouShouldKnow,ff404xi,t1_ff3bqpa,1579552648.0,More RAM can speed up your computer. Windows’ memory manager splits some memory pages to disk which is super super slow. It obviously depends on what software you run and how much you had previously but going from 4 to 8GB RAM on Windows 10 you will absolutely notice better performance.
C_Programming,ff3zs7d,t3_er6qh4,1579552430.0,"It’s pretty much useless for arguments. For local variables it can be useful. It also prevents you from using the & operator which can be used to promote safe programming, but it’s not important at all."
C_Programming,ff3xrth,t3_erborj,1579551174.0,"A pointer is just an integer that holds the address of something (or nothing!). There is absolutely no magic involved in pointers, it is just an integer."
IllegalLifeProTips,femi6fk,t1_femhdna,1579256833.0,"I’m talking about the only useful anti cheats - EAC, BE, ESEA and FaceIt. It does create a problem. They have to «whitelist» the new Windows kernel since they check for kernel modifications. This is one of the reasons why closed source is great and Linux sucks for games."
IllegalLifeProTips,fej7778,t1_fej751y,1579159770.0,Imagine thinking «your mom» is funny in 2020. You really have no social skills do you? Wouldn’t surprise me considering you get so upset about anyone critising Linux that you have to insult their mother.
IllegalLifeProTips,fej71q0,t1_fej6zll,1579159579.0,Retard.
IllegalLifeProTips,fej5ccv,t1_fej4ksf,1579157520.0,Adobe Suite was just an example. There are millions of programs that work on Windows(and sometimes Mac too) that don’t work on Linux. Linux operating systems just aren’t as user friendly as Windows. I’m sure you’re very interested in this topic and know a fair bit about Linux but the average user doesn’t give a fuck and just wants an easy to use OS that they are familiar with and will never have compatibility issues with - Windows.
IllegalLifeProTips,fej3z8n,t1_fej3ppe,1579156024.0,Show me web-based Adobe Suite.
IllegalLifeProTips,fej2gw4,t1_feizk1w,1579154436.0,And then almost no software works on it.
IllegalLifeProTips,fej2fj0,t1_feiy8zf,1579154398.0,That works if you don’t play games using anti cheats.
Cplusplus,fecq03d,t1_feagq2x,1578980445.0,Why on earth are you suggesting he use malloc and delete? Use new and delete. If you use malloc use free.
IllegalLifeProTips,fe6o3um,t1_fe6mkjj,1578897738.0,"Just want to say that while a font may be legally viewed as a «program», most fonts are not programs technically speaking(none). A program contains code, fonts don’t."
technology,fe1201c,t1_fdy9lrx,1578821596.0,"Apple’s source of income is mainly selling hardware and some software, they use these things to better your experience. Google’s main source of income is selling your data. It’s not about who uses what services, all phones «track» your GPS (that doesn’t mean upload to their servers) but not all phones use this to sell data. Apple may be expensive and all but at least you are the customer and not the product."
