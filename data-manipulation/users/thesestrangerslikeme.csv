ChildrenFallingOver,fey3ylp,t3_equxo0,1579440517.0,You know you can trim videos right?
youseeingthisshit,fes9j9m,t1_fes049z,1579362901.0,That was really cool. I want an OLED
WatchPeopleDieInside,fem2zm6,t3_epluao,1579238050.0,"I know his shirt says NAVY, but it looks like NAW, which is definitely what that guy is thinking"
whoosh,fel8m3c,t1_fekw575,1579216427.0,"I mean maybe, but those things make sense based on the number system we follow which is 2 base 10. Math is the basis of everything, so if you’re saying that’s manmade then whatever I’m not gonna argue

It just makes zero logical sense to say a kid born in the 90s is an 80s baby"
IllegallySmolCats,fekksa6,t1_fekkp7u,1579202110.0,Yes please!
IllegallySmolCats,fekkhjg,t3_epmt8o,1579201937.0,Smol cat on a big couch. My favorite show! I could watch it all day
ChildrenFallingOver,fekbk95,t1_fek8srb,1579196618.0,Yeah that mirror could’ve easily broken
sex,fekafi3,t1_fek9gis,1579195953.0,Okay that makes sense
sex,fek92js,t1_fek8owd,1579195152.0,"Maybe not quantify it, but can you at least estimate by taste how much there might be?"
sex,fek8wg3,t1_fek8093,1579195052.0,"Yeah I’m referring to oral specifically. I think it’s more common to orgasm from that than sex. I’m one of the ones who hasn’t orgasmed from sex, but I’m working on it"
sex,fek7p93,t1_fek7hb7,1579194341.0,"Yes that’s what I mean. It’s the only thing comparable I would think. But referring to it as cum is easier and sounds better to me than lubrication. But that’s great to know, I’ll have to see what guy the I’m seeing does when it happens"
sex,fek7ij3,t1_fek74fz,1579194228.0,That’s good to hear!
sex,fek7g4o,t1_fek65lr,1579194188.0,"I didn’t say it was measurable, although personally, even though I definitely don’t squirt, there is enough that it will run out of my vagina slightly after orgasm. I wouldn’t assume that what happens with the women you’ve been with happens with the majority. I don’t even know if what happens with me happens to the majority, but nonetheless...

That’s good to know. I don’t have that sensitivity issue much, but it definitely like it when a guy puts his tongue inside me, and I can imagine it would feel good after orgasm as well. Thanks for the response!"
whoosh,fek6j34,t1_fek656c,1579193644.0,"Well you’re one of the only ones. You’re following a manmade technicality rather than logic

In case you would like to read it, I found this article: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/when-does-the-decade-begin-and-end-anyway%3f_amp=true"
whoosh,fek3tyc,t1_fek2w29,1579192029.0,"Who cares if there wasn’t a year zero, it’s more logical that the 20s would be 2020-2029. I mean when you refer to the 80s do you include 1990? I don’t think so"
rareinsults,feh2f4u,t3_eoqyw9,1579107728.0,It’s be more accurate if he said Malfoy
prephysicianassistant,feh27i2,t1_fegmjs2,1579107603.0,"This isn’t necessarily true because semesters hold different weight because of how many credits you’re taking. If in the first three semesters you were taking more credits than you will for the last five, you will need a gpa higher than 3.82 to maintain a 3.4. But it most likely isn’t going to be a huge difference since the normal course load is probably 15-18 credits"

Luckily I have a guy that actually cares about me now. It was just hard to let go and not feel guilty"
oddlyspecific,fefdnc7,t3_eoo3ch,1579054075.0,This isn’t specific
