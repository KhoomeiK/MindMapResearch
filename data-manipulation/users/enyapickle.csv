cyclothymia,fdrdekn,t3_empa57,1578682957.0,"I questioned my diagnosis at first but ultimately it was definitely the right one for me. I’d recommend sticking it out on the meds and tracking your moods (daylio & eMoods are great apps for it) for a month or so. I’m not a doctor or anything so take this with a grain of salt. 

I have cyclothymia and ADD so I take Zoloft, lamictal, and vyvanse (as needed for classes). I was on the Zoloft before the cyclothymia diagnosis and we added the lamictal after. I also went to weekly talk therapy for the first two months of the medications and I’m switching to every other week now because I’m so much more level.

Before this combination I’d go through periods from as long as a week to as little as 2 hours that my mood would flip between feeling this overwhelming love for all of my friends to the point of happy tears & feeling so driven to make big plans for the future and get my life together only to flip to periods of not being able to get out of bed and go to classes, extremely negative thoughts, and just overall dread toward life.

I don’t know if I’m special or something but everything is so much better now. I’ve been taking that combination for about 3ish months and I’ve never been so level and competent as I am now in comparison to the last 4ish years. Obviously, I still have some good days and bad days but my emotions are rarely so overwhelming that I can’t do everything that I need to."
succulents,fdfux5j,t1_fderv7e,1578370870.0,I repotted it yesterday and didn’t see any signs of rot so I guess I’ll avoid watering it for a few weeks and see what happens
NCSU,fd2kbwn,t3_ejwoe7,1578148455.0,tbh I didn’t buy it and just shared with my suite mate who had a different session time because I was broke after my other textbooks & that worked fine for me
backpain,fd0dkbl,t1_fd07oio,1578117299.0,"Same thing happened to me. I hope the injection works out! As far as the pain, you can take ibuprofen and Tylenol at the same time and it’s more effective."
backpain,fd073wj,t3_ejqt20,1578114624.0,"I’ve had an epidural steroid injection which didn’t personally help me but I’ve heard good things from other people. It’s definitely worth a shot & it’s a super easy process. It doesn’t really hurt either, just a bit of a weird pressure sensation so it’s more uncomfortable than painful.

Also, oral steroids are helpful to some people to! They help reduce swelling overall, but the injection is more direct. Prednisone is the most common one & if you get that prescription try to take the pills with juice or something flavored because they taste horrible."
backpain,fczbrwy,t3_ejkncc,1578097735.0,"Physical therapy!! So so so much better than chiropractors. You work on strengthening your core & correcting your posture to relieve pressure on your spine. My L5S1 is herniated too & I’m only 19 and I cannot imagine putting up with this for 8 years. You’re so strong!

Also, taking Tylenol and ibuprofen at the same time increases their efficiency. Tens unit is also the way to go! Amazon has some good ones if you’re in a pinch because that 2 day delivery is a savior."

NCSU,fckdwvr,t1_fck3e4a,1577723150.0,"I like the bricks! There are some buildings that are randomly placed throughout campus that kind of break up the brick monotony & have different architectural styles.

I think the people are pretty nice in general. You’ll find competitive people wherever you go. I’m in engineering and in the first year there were a couple people that were extremely competitive and acted like they couldn’t get into their major if they didn’t “beat” everyone else. There were also a lot of people that wanted to work together and didn’t make everything a competition. As far as competition throughout your major, it’s really about who you surround yourself with. I’d say 90% of the time people hold doors open & could carry a conversation if you were stuck waiting in the same line or something.

I’m incredibly happy with my decision to go to state. I wrote pros & cons lists of schools and spent hours researching things about the schools I got into and I drove myself mad trying to make a decision. I chose NC state because it was in-state for me & it’s great for engineering. I’d never even toured before enrolling. I can’t imagine being anywhere else, I love it here.

I hope you figure it out! Worst comes to worst, you can always transfer."

EngineeringStudents,fc7j1b4,t3_egdmb5,1577508968.0,"Do it!! I doubt anyone will care about your age. I had a chemistry lecture & physics lecture where another student was older than the professor last year. Even this semester I had an ex-marine in my intro materials science course. You can definitely do it & you won’t be the only one.

Do this for yourself! You put in so much work and you took that time off to help yourself and you’re ready. You got this!"
bipolar,fc7il6a,t3_eglvgj,1577508556.0,"This is so cool! Embroidery/cross stitch is my favorite way to turn off my brain and relax. I usually freehand it but there’s a ton of cool patterns online. 

Check out Etsy since a lot of amazon ones are cheap copies of the original artists. I really like Florals & Floss and Ellucy Stitches. 

If you stick to freehand though, there’s water soluble markers which are awesome for planning your own pattern."

backpain,fc74vnh,t1_fc6te8w,1577497596.0,wait really? I have BCBS and I’ve only used the search tool once or twice so I haven’t run into that yet but I’m glad you said something bc I’ll definitely check going forward.
backpain,fc6etks,t3_egfn98,1577478887.0,"This is the worst!! So absolutely upsetting and frustrating, I’m sorry this happened to you. 

A lot of insurance companies have a search tool to look for in-network doctors so you may be able to try that going forward. It’s incredibly stupid that doctors can say they “take” your insurance but aren’t in network.

I hope you can work something out, good luck!"

These tracking apps are so handy & I’m glad that I’m not the only one who meticulously uses them haha"

piercing,fc1wsy8,t3_efnm82,1577332136.0,What diameter is your conch ring? Mine is pretty far inward like that and I have a 12 mm one in but it’s slightly too big and then the 10 mm is too small. I can’t find anything that isn’t insanely expensive or the wrong size :(
