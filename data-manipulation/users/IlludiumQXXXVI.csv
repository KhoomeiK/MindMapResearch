I spent a few days in Cairo back in 2008 at the end of an extensive backpacking trip through the middle East spent staying in $5 a night hostels. My travel partner and I decided to splurge on a fancy hotel for our last night. It was probably $150 and not nearly as nice as this."

Wow, this is so interesting! I was diagnosed with chronic endometritis, or inflammation in my endometrial lining, after my third loss. I was treated with antibiotics and went on to have two successful pregnancies after that with no further losses. It was a miracle for me. Not all inflammation is caused by infection though, so I was lucky mine was so treatable. I hope this can be the solution for so many other women."

Borrowed shoes from a friend and carted my ass all the way across the city on multiple busses to get there, only to find out they're looking for people to buy and sell knives."

I went to UofT (Toronto) for undergrad and UT (Tennessee) for grad, and it definitely causes some confusion when I talk about one or the other without clarifying"
