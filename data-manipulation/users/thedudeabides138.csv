Prior to the adoption of the 25th amendment, no, a new VP was not appointed.

Since the 25th amendment, a new VP has been appointed twice. The first time, Gerald Ford was appointed VP to Nixon after Agnew resigned. 

Then when Nixon resigned and Ford became President, Nelson Rockefeller was appointed as Ford's VP.

Science and logic tell us that the probability of a miracle is extremely low, and having no evidence for one, it's not reasonable to believe in things which are extremely unlikely to occur and for which there is no evidence. 

>We can't verify most miracles.

Then we don't have a basis to believe them.

>Suppose Jesus walked on the water. There's no evidence to find, no archaeological artifact, no photograph, no footprints observable on the water. All we have to go by is the testimony of the eyewitnesses, which we have but many (possibly you also) choose to reject. Many miracles are this way.

That sounds like a fictional story then.

>They say, ""Prove it."" What do you have for them?

Nothing. But I wouldn't be stupid enough to argue that logically and scientifically they should believe those things happened. 

>You want methodology, but historical events don't lend themselves to methodology.

There is a difference between a record of a natural event and a supernatural one, and you know this.

>Miracles can only be proven in two ways: (1) They can be shown to be logically consistent with the physical world

Showing something is logically consistent with the physical world doesn't mean it actually happened.

For example, someone in this thread could make a reasonable argument defending miracles. That's logically consistent with the physical world, but it hasn't happened. 

>(2) By enough corroboration by credible eyewitnesses.

Disagree.

>As Alvin Plantinga writes

Don't care.

>According to Newton and classical mechanics,

Also don't care. Newton was wrong and has nothing to do with this topic.

>John Mackie (no friend of theism), says,

Don't care.

These people are irrelevant to the conversation.

>With evidence that there are non-material realities,

Present such evidence. 

>It's absurd to think that everything must be subject to scientific methodology and verification

Please provide me with an epistemological method that generates the same level of certainty as the scientific method."
