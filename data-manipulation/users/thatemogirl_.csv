gtaonline,fd6kjyy,t1_fd5uhcp,1578192403.0,"It's alright. Ghosting makes the person unable to kill you, and their mission is to destroy the vehicle that the person who supposedly ""ghosted"" is driving. So, it's cheating.  I'm not sure if in missions you're allowed to ghost, bc I haven't done this mission before. But it might be glitching, which is also against R\* too."
gtaonline,fd6ezmh,t3_ek1qvv,1578189972.0,"yea, same. rockstar should really pay attention to GTA V as ppl still do play. it's too bad though."
