Unless there’s something in the contract about holding up their end of the bargain (which I’m sure they’re smart enough to leave out but please do check), then the contract is pretty clear and if you want justice you have to work within the justice system. Adhering to contracts is part of that. 

If you don’t give a shit about bringing them to justice, just rehome the cat anywhere you want to and if they try to come after you, threaten them with a lawsuit over their false claims. If they take you to court you plead your case and the worst that can happen is they get their cat back anyway and pawn it off on someone else but they’re exposed as a shitty petmill."
