no it isn't for fuck's sake. Fair Oaks is such a big farm that losing a couple of calves to mistreatment is nothing to them. Not all farms are like this. Where I work, the median dairy farm is 70 animals. Producers simply can't afford to lose animals due to bad conditions. 

Calves are separated fro their mothers so that the cows can be milked."
