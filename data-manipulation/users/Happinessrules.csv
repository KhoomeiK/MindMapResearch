I stood up for myself and the person actually apologized to me and then wrote a note PLUS gave me free shipping.  I was so shocked and proud of myself.

It's no fun to be without an inhaler because you just never know when it will flare really badly.  I've read that adolescents may tend to misuse inhalers but other than that I have never heard of anyone trying to get an inhaler they didn't need.  It's really not a great feeling to use an inhaler because it jazzes you up so much.  So were you able to get an inhaler?  In a pinch, I have purchased an OTC inhaler, they're not the best because they will really jazz you up but will get you breathing."

ChronicPain,ffjdzpv,t3_ett8dp,1579996268.0,"I was in the same position as you.  I would seriously give kratom another try from a different vendor and one not from a smoke shop.  The kratom Facebook group has a wonderful list of approved vendors. Try different strains and/or vendors until you find one the works for you.  It took me a while to find the strains that worked the best for me.  Many vendors sell sample packs. Start with a small dose but continue increasing until you find your sweet spot.  I take between 15 and 20 grams for pain. You can take too much and get what they call the wobbles so you can't go crazy.  Usually, less is more. When I first started taking it I was worried about building a tolerance to it but many people who use it for pain have assured me that when you use it for pain you don't have to worry about taking a tolerance break from it.  

I can't take real late in the day because it interferes with my sleep but can take my last dose around 4 to 4:30 pm and I'm usually good for the night.  I know other people take it for sleep. You just have to play around with it.

Reddit has a wonderful kratom sub with great informational articles in the sidebar and really well-informed members. 

I am not exaggerating when I say that kratom has literally saved my life.  I have nerve pain that was getting so bad I was having suicidal ideations.    Of course, there are side effects and it can be addictive.  But I have to take gabapentin and the withdrawals for that can be hell so I will gladly take my chance with kratom. 

I hope you find something that helps with the pain so you can sleep.  There is no better medicine than a good night's sleep."

dogs,ffgzv5o,t3_etd5f7,1579919353.0,"When my sister lived in Tempe, AZ she was attacked on two separate occasions while walking her small terrier mix.  She was able to pick up her dog to protect it from getting attacked but was then bit multiple times in her arms and legs.  The first time was two Pitt mixes off-leash with their owner present and the second time was were Rottweilers that had escaped their rickety fence.  Neither time were the owners punished.  She had no idea if the dogs were current on their shots.  Both experiences were terrifying, cost her about $500 in medical expenses from the dog bites and took a huge toll on her mental health.  It was really disappointing how little animal control did to help prevent this from happening again.

AgingParents,ffazi2d,t3_esmfei,1579748101.0,"I'm sorry this sounds incredibly tough.  What happens if you tell her that you insist that she get another diagnosis from a different therapist or she can't live with you?  This would just be said to use as leverage.  But it will be impossible to get her on disability without one a proper diagnosis.  She may also benefit from medication to treat her paranoia than just taking pain pills, in fact, I believe pain pills may cause paranoia.   Here is a [link](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/painkiller-addiction/side-effects/#gref) that talks about the issues that may result from misusing pain pills.  I copied a paragraph from this article that talks about paranoia. 

*Depression and anxiety may occur as the result of using painkillers,* ***as can paranoia,*** *confusion, disorientation, distorted perception of reality and feelings of anger or hostility. More serious side effects of opioids can include liver damage and brain damage.*

I would ask her permission to talk to the doctor who is prescribing the pain pills.  It may help to understand why she is getting them and if they are the reason why she is paranoid. 

I also listed some sites that may be able to offer you some assistance with your mother. [Agingcare.com](https://Agingcare.com) and [https://www.n4a.org](https://www.n4a.org/) which will help you find a close Area Agency on Aging.

dadswhodidnotwantpets,ffaw4qx,t3_enbbui,1579745865.0,"You can purchase claw caps that will prevent the cat from scratching furniture.  I don't have any experience with them but I have read that many people use them on their cats successfully.  I would pose this question to Reddit cat owners who use them to see if they are easy and safe to use. You have to replace them every 6ish weeks. 

Someone mentions spray and I can say that it works very well.  I have also used packing tape with the sticky side out to prevent scratching when you don't want them to. If you have scratching posts available and any time the cat tries to scratch where you don't want them to you just pick them up and put them on the scratching post.  Move the scratching posts near where they tend to want to scratch on the furniture.

Cats always require you to play with them at least a couple of times a day for 10 to 15 minutes.  After play then feed them. Do not free-feed them.  Have two litter boxes available for your kitty.  They will use the box unless something is wrong such as an infection or they are feeling territorial like seeing another cat outside.  When you first get the kitty don't let them hide so block under your bed and places where they can get to.  It's easier to get the cat used to you if you have access to it.  I recommend watching Jackson Galaxy, ""My cat from hell"" either on Animal Planet or on youtube.  You'll be able to learn a lot about cats from this show.

I would write out a schedule on taking care of the cat and how you will do so.  I would also research how much to expect for vet care and food with a proposal on how you will earn the money to care for the cat."

narcissisticparents,ff911ye,t3_es5t6t,1579702155.0,"Many narcissistic parents are the worst when it comes to their children and their health issues. I was born with severe breathing problems and both of my parents continued to smoke.  When I would have a bad asthma attack the only sympathy I got from mother was that she too suffers from asthma so I just needed to buck up, apparently, she was too cool not to smoke.  My father never mentioned anything to me at all. As I grew up I suffered from a series of health issues and my mother and father couldn't be bothered to ask about them.  If my mother did it was only to use as a segway to talk endlessly about her health issues. My father would just say something short about it and then act as if nothing was wrong. I guess fortunately neither one gave me a guilt trip about it

So I totally understand your frustration with your father.  They just do not care that their children suffer and can offer no sympathy to them because doing so may take away the attention from them.

I ask because this is how people who grew up in an emotionally neglectful home feel this way about themselves.  You think well my childhood wasn't that bad, I had food, clothes a place to live and when I was sick I saw a doctor.  But having a home where there was no love, acceptance or support can have grave consequences on your life.  Maybe your parents were verbally or physically abusive during your childhood and still are, emotional neglect lies at the crux of it. I know because I was raised in such a home and I have felt the same way as you. 

If you think this may be what you grew up with I urge you to start researching emotional neglect.  Jonice Webb has a couple of really good books that I found to be very helpful.  For me once I started learning about emotional neglect it started me on the way toward healing how I felt about myself.

helpmecope,ff2ubzd,t3_ercilq,1579524479.0,"I have a few suggestions that may help reduce your stress.  It takes some effort on your part but if you do them it will definately help.

1) Even though you know you didn't do anything wrong, stop arguing with your parents and siblings.  If you're asked to do something then do it without being reminded.  If you mess up then apologize. You will never win an argument so it will help reduce the yelling, hopefully. 

2) Make sure you get enough sleep.  Stop your screen time two hours before you go to bed.  The blue light messes up our sleep patterns.  

3) Get outside and do some form of exercise for at least 30 minutes a day for at least 5 days a week.   Fresh air and nature are incredibly good for our sleep and mood.

4) Keep a stress diary.  Record the date, who you were with, what happened, how you felt about the incident and what you did to help with it. Just writing it down lets us release the stress and helps us to see what triggers us and what we can do that would help.

5) Meditate at least five days a week.  Even five minutes has an amazing effect on our bodies.  There are guided meditations on youtube to get you started. 

6) Eat healthy, junk food is okay as a treat but not a steady diet. 

7) If you can talk to your parents about the stress level of the house and how it's affecting you.  You never know they may listen to you. 

I know it may seem overwhelming but pick one and work on that until you've incorporated it into your day and then pick the next one.  I think even if you do three things on this list you will feel much better."

I don't think you're being too sensitive, I think she is not being sensitive enough to your feelings.  I totally understand why you are insecure about your relationship with her, even though she tells you she loves you, her actions seem to prove otherwise. I guess you have to decide if this is the type of relationship you want to have because she will probably never change.

kratom,ff1y3g9,t1_ff1xt8g,1579488827.0,I use powder and I mix either with a juice or just water. I put the liquid in a small jar with the powder and then shake it up really well.

emotionalneglect,ff125b4,t3_er2thg,1579474458.0,Have you thought about volunteering somewhere?  Volunteering gives you the opportunity to practice and develop your social skills since you are meeting regularly with a group of people with common interests.  Committing to this shared activity is also a great way to make friends.

Twenty years ago, my son and nephew when they were 7 had a similar experience.  We were on a long walk on a boardwalk and they were dawdling behind so I kept calling them to hurry up and catch up to the rest of us.  When they finally did they were all flushed with excitement. They both said that they saw their grandpa, who had died three years before, sitting on a bench and he said hello to them and what fine gentlemen they were becoming.  They were both insistent about what they saw, their story never changed, and they will still talk about it to this day.  So you never know I guess maybe my Dad did come for a visit."

dogs,ff0m1bd,t3_er09c4,1579470174.0,"I would give him some time to settle into your home and don't judge too quickly.  He is a dog, who with lots of love and training should fit into your home.  I found that when I bring a new dog into my home I take long walks with both dogs at a heel.  I am always amazed at how quickly my dogs have bonded and learned to accept each other this way.  I have always been strict with feeding.  I never feed them too closely until I know they will be okay. I make them sit and wait until I tell them it's okay to eat.  It seems like they figure out that you are the boss this way.  I also never leave toys and chews around since that seems to start a fight if there is going to be one.  

Thank you so much for giving this guy a chance and I hope it works out well for the both of you."

emotionalneglect,fezye00,t3_er0j41,1579463234.0,"I can understand why you're feeling so down. I have often felt the same way when I think about how much time it took me to finally see and understand how my family treated me. But then I remember how far I have come in the last six years and I'm in a much better place now.  I think you should remember how far you have come and despite everything your mother did to you, you have risen above it and have been able to create a new life for yourself.  You have a wife and other family members who love and care about you. That is something to be really proud of.  

Have you thought about lessening the amount of time you spend with your mother?  You really don't owe her anything and the position she is in is because of her actions.  I was able to heal when I stopped talking to my family and I don't feel bad about it at all.  I owe it to myself and my family to be happy.  

Wishing you all the best."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fezv0ri,t3_eqymuf,1579462017.0,"What kind of household was she raised in?  Even if her parents weren't narcissists they could have been emotionally neglectful and if you're raised in that way then you have no sense of self.  I know because my mother was a narcissist and emotionally absent and my dad was also emotionally neglectful.  Because of that I grew up really not knowing who I was or what I liked.  I still have a very hard time with that today. She just sounds like that she really has no idea how to be herself so she is copying someone she really admires.

But I am trying to always trust my intuition because it never works out well for me when I don't. So if something is nagging at you pay attention to it."

I would love to not have to use it because it's really hard to go through a day having to think about when I have to dose again. 

I'm so glad that you were able to do it without any withdrawal.  Maybe someday I can do that too."
JustNoSO,fez4nu1,t1_fez3dkb,1579453815.0,What a wonderful feeling. It makes me happy that you knew enough to get out.  I see so many stay and try to fix things and we both know there is no fixing.

That to me is a red flag if he doesn't have your back now how will he be down the road.  These are the things you need to be considering as you try and find a lifelong partner.  Believe me, these kinds of things do not go away unless you address them now.  They will just escalate.   A partner needs to listen to your concerns and take them seriously."
JustNoSO,fez0k3v,t1_fez01xl,1579452771.0,"Have you heard of ""emotional labor"" in a marriage?  I would look it up because he is a classic example of a partner dropping the ball and letting his partner do everything.  He is certainly capable of learning what needs to be done.  I think that the blame for this kind of behavior also lies with the mother who never taught their son daily activities of living and did everything for them.  Those kinds of mothers are not doing their son's any favors."

AgingParents,feysg35,t3_eqx7hm,1579450047.0,"I'm sorry it sounds like you have a heavy load to carry with your dad. It sounds like it's time for someone to come in and help him with his hygiene.  Someone posted that [Agingcare.com](https://Agingcare.com) has resources to help people find home care for their aging parents.  There is also [https://www.n4a.org/](https://www.n4a.org/) which is another resource for you to contact.  Possibly they could recommend a care manager to come in and help assess what he needs. I believe they are privately contracted so you would have to pay a fee but having someone understand the ropes would be very helpful.

I'm sure how hard it would be to find him another doctor. One who will pay attention to the sudden changes he is going through and helpt to make sure his meds are balanced and correct.  Being dizzy and confused is not a good state to be in at his age.

I know that with my 93 year old MIL we had to be very insistent with her doctor to go beyond his usual ""see you in six months"".  Eventually, we had to find another doctor who paid attention to what she needed.

I wish you all the best with your dad."
