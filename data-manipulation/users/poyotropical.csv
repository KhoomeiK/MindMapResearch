AmItheAsshole,ffo7t8d,t3_eudc4t,1580074943.0,"YTA. One, he can live where he wants. It’s not a village or a small place. Two, it’s a great opportunity for him. Three, you contacted him out of the blue and you were making the situation about yourself. Selfish."
AmItheAsshole,ffkk6ua,t1_ffkjyzf,1580024129.0,"Well then, I guess it would be best to stay out of it for now. Good luck :)"
AmItheAsshole,ffkjpwp,t1_ffkjck5,1580023901.0,"It’s not your fault. You’re merely being a friend. Just try to reason with her and if she fails to cooperate, just let her battle her insecurities on her own. She shouldn’t be upset and not want to see her bf over something like this."
AmItheAsshole,ffkipbc,t3_eu3p02,1580023413.0,NTA. She’s overreacting. You had no further intention other than to do your friend a favor and you weren’t aware of her planning to bring the cat food. She probably wanted to seem like a hero and bring the food later while the cat was starving.
AmItheAsshole,ff0ukch,t1_ff0tdbh,1579472411.0,"She’s a math coach at an elementary school and starts and leaves the same time I go to school. Me and my brother do clean the kitchen, take out the garbage, and clean the floor. She sometimes cleans the kitchen but she mainly folds the clothes. We do the chores, because our parents say it shows how it was for them and how good we have it, and it shows active responsibility and maturity. I believe them in this claim. So it’s kinda 50/50."
