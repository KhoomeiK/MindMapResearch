therewasanattempt,fft907g,t1_fft0hrp,1580212788.0,"The irony of filling the comments with pointless whining, which is guaranteed to be of no value, about reposts which are valuable to anyone who hasn't seen them before.

Repost whining will always be more annoying than reposts. It's like going to a movie theater and shouting ""seen it!"" through the entire movie. Nobody cares, just leave."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fe6af0m,t1_fe662y6,1578885418.0,"> The growth/distribution/sale of what you are using quietly in your house can very well have involved actions (like forced labor, violence or threat of violence, etc) that directly infringed on the rights of innocent people, and thus the victimless act in your house is still tied to actual victims elsewhere.

All of the things you listed are the result of prohibition. If I grow a plant and burn it in my home, what indirect harm have I done?

Can we also discuss the indirect harm enforcing these unjust laws causes in addition to the indirect harm prohibition causes to begin with? Because I feel like you've almost gotten to the wisdom of the situation, you just need to take it a step further."

AskReddit,fdpiyz1,t1_fdpifnt,1578629895.0,"He has a point. Most of the people claiming that they get some profound respect for life out of that sub are the same ones commenting with dumb jokes and disrespectful puns after watching a video of someone dying. I'm sure some people gained a respect for life watching those videos, but most of reddit is teenagers who are happy to laugh at the misfortune of others and never give it another thought."
Showerthoughts,fdpih9s,t1_fdphxh9,1578629518.0,"No. They use base 10. That's why when a clock said ""12"" it means 12. If it were base 2 then the clock would count 1, 10, 11, 100, and so on. If they were base 3 they would be numbered 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 20, etc.

The fact that clocks operate in 60 second or 60 minute cycles is completely separate from the fact that they use base 10 (because humans use base 10 and it just makes sense)."
