startrek,ffy79r4,t1_ffy6ixt,1580339933.0,"Oh, well, I guess I haven't watched enough VOY yet to be disappointed in that aspect of it.

But maybe I wasn't clear about this: I was trying to say I think there's something to the idea that the realtionship *might* be an issue, but that I pesonally don't find it to be a problem either, all things considered. If the doctor came off like more of a creep or if she had been doing her ""social lessons"" with a human ships counsellor that would have been very iffy, but as written it seems fine."
startrek,ffy59ps,t1_ffxksi6,1580338807.0,"Incest is also wrong for several reasons besides what you said. Principly, because it builds a romantic relationship (in which trust should be built up between peers) on top of a familial one, where trust is granted to an adult (or older child) by a child in their care, in the context of a great imbalance of power and sophistication.

The real issue here is the second reason: an argument could be made that the Doctor and Seven have a parent-child like relationship in that she is naïve in a way a normal adult is not and he is guiding her through her development.

I tend to not to agree with that, myself, since the doctor is really just a couple of years ahead of Seven in his exploration of his humanity. It feels less like a parental relationship and more like your friend's big brother... it seems like a more accurate analogy might be an 18 year old woman dating a dude in their mid twenties. There's potential to question his motives, but it could be perfectly healthy. It's not like anyone is being molested.

(Notably, a serious power imbalance and relationship of care exists between a first officer and every other person aboard a ship, making *any* relationship involving Chakotay problematic at best)

But y'know? One of the things I love about Seven/Doctor is that they have such a well developed platonic mentorship relationship. Women characters on TV so rarely get to build well fleshed out relationships with men where attaction isn't an issue."

In fact, taking and ransoming prisioners is a pretty common feature of (human) cultures that most resemble  the Klingons in their regard for martial virtues. If you respect the other side there's no real reason to kill them just because you've gotten the upper hand, and if you live to serve your lord it is selfish to rob him of a skilled warrior in the future for the sake of your own glory in death.

I think the whole death before surrender schtick is more about mediocre warriors seeing their one chance at distinction in death, while fearing that they might never really accomplish anything of note in their life other than giving up this one time. Those who are more confident they have more victories ahead of them if they live to fight another day don't seem to be stressed out about it."

Honestly, VOY could have done most of what they did with a premise of ""here we are on a 7 year deep space mission into a part of the galaxy no one has ever explored"" just as easily as with the lost in space conceit.

That's a good premise but it's not really what the pilot aet up. Did switching gears ultimately make for a better or worse show? That's a question for another day.

My way around this is to assume that while that description of how the transporter works is true, its only part of the story. Really, objects being transported are being ""rotated"" out of phase with our universe, but remain coherent somewhere else. It's only from our three dimensional perspective that the molocules seem to have been exploded apart. This explains why Barclay can see those worms swimming around in the transporter beam-- he's still Barclay, not a just cloud of water vapour and amino acids. 

It also removes the need to assume that building anything imaginable at a molecular resolutution is a solved problem so we can buy that the transport accidents we see are unresproducable, that transport patterns degrade quickly (its not just a very big file, its an attempt to track the state of the object held out of phase) and spinal cords are still tricky to clone."

In the TOS era, Klingons are scary to people. They are a frightening, agressive superpower, sneaky by their very nature, statist, prepared to wipe out the federation's freedom-loving way of life.

So they dressed them in blackface (not blackface like a black guy! That would be racist. More tan. Like what my gramma calls a ""Mongoloid"") and gave them Fu Manchu mustaches and sort of vaguely orientalized clothes. To a viewer in the '60s this yellow peril look was tapping in to their anxieties.

But by the '80s, it's starting to look a little silly, so we get the rubber forhead pointed teeth Klingons who look bestial and frightening, and dress like bikers from Mad Max, or maybe heavy metal guys.

Well before the end of the 90s we've all gotten used to those Klingons and recontextualized that look so it no longer says ""crazy junkie werewolf"" and instead makes us think ""Space Samurai.""

DaystromInstitute,ffidbsf,t3_etseu9,1579971160.0,"Who are those two people who live with Picard? They seem to be domestic servants. In a world where economic inequality doesn't exist, can everyone afford two servants? (I notice they seem be Romulans -- racialized refugees that is).

Even in the TNG era I've always thought Picard's speeches about how economic inequality has been conquered sounded a bit like the naïvity of someone speaking from a place of privilige. We see items of significant value being passed down through families (vineyards, chateaus, restaurants). We have a Starfleet where admission is incredibly competitive and supposedly based wholy on merit, but half the people in it seem to be either second or third generation Starfleet officers or the children of ambassadors. All this points to an entrenched class system that the people benefitting from it don't want to acknowlege exists.

That doesn't mean that poverty *per se* exists. There's probably a basic minimium income that is sufficient to meet everyone's daily needs. In the age of replicators no one needs to go without food or clothing. Fully socializing healthcare and education is something any nation with the political will to do it can accomplish even today. Ensuring everyone is housed adequently would be more challenging, but it's not exactly Dunkirk. I bet its a lot more equal than what we have today.

Still, not everyone can live in a brownstone in Grenich Village, or at a certain point its not Grenich Village anymore. And not everyone gets to go to Harvard.

And in the era of Picard it looks like the cracks are showing more than they did. Those shutters are down because people are worried about theft or vandalism. Even before the attack on Mars workers there were having serious difficult balancing work and family relationships ( which we think of as normal in the 21st Century, but its a sign of economic inequality and a culture that values productivity over humanity).

You built it all on the foundation of a political community that has provided you with health care, an education, safety from violence, roads, safe food and water, and recourse to courts, to say nothing of public spaces to relax in.

1. *Misery* - this is just flat out one of his best, scariest novels, and it does it without a hint of the supernatural. King's themes of addiction, vulnerability, psychopathy and his own literary anxiety are on full display.

2. *Different Seasons* - four dramatic novellas, none of which have any fantasy elements, only one of them really even a suspense/ horror story. Shows that King has the tools in his toolbox to be a non-genre literary writer.

3. *It* - A perfect fusion of the classic King small town horror novel and the sprawling fantasy epic. All his influences, all his themes, all his strengths as a writer marshalled together. Even the bits that some folks hate are there for a reason and you'll learn a lot if you take the time to think about why they are there. It is long though."

startrek,ff0lf36,t1_ff019ie,1579469962.0,"Spock is an anomaly. He is a human vulcan hybrid. 

What we do see evidence of in TOS is that starship crews are largely segregated by species, which makes sense when you consider that in AmokTme we see enviromental conditons on Vulcan that are just at the edge of human tolerance. So the Intrepid is an all-Vulcan ship and Enterprise is all human. Those humans are not that used to working side by side with aliens. Spock, as a hybrid, could manage a posting to either a human or Vulcan ship. 

McCoy struggles with Vulcan physiology because he's a doctor, dammit, not an exobiologist. Doctors know about one thing: the human body. But then again, the CMO on the Intrepid would probably be just as puzzled with Spock's half-human biology.

Of course they gradually start to retcon most of that stuff , starting with TAS, with more alien crew members being seen as time goes on. It can easily be read as cross posting getting more common as they improve their ability to make accommedations. By the 24th Century psyicians don't seem to consider other species outside their scope of practice at all.

Basically, the gold eyes and white skin  are there to cue people in that they are talking to an android, so their intuition isn't constantly going off and warning them that this affectless weirdo is probably a murderer. Lore's facial tic might have been an attempt at this, too, replaced by Data's contraction issues when it came across as creepy instead of charming.
