economy,ffo4svl,t1_ffjz8sj,1580074172.0,Putin stopped permitting American adoptions of Russian children after the Magnitsky act was passed.  That is why the meeting at Trump Tower in 2016 was about “adoption” when it was more likely about trying to get the Magnitsky act repealed.

pics,fegukfx,t3_ep0g2m,1579102863.0,"I am so sorry for what you are going through.  When I lost my boyfriend of 6 years/fiancé I was 23.  It is hard to be so young and lose the person you were going to spend your life with.  It is difficult for people at that age to relate to loss of a spouse.  Go easy on yourself.  As someone said above, don’t be afraid or to feel guilty if you laugh.  Grief will come at you at odd times.  You might feel like you’re dealing and the next second something seemingly insignificant will set you off.  Grief does come in waves.  Sometimes you just need someone to be there but not talk.  Don’t be afraid to ask for help.  Mourn.  Though it hurts to unimaginable depths you can’t begin to heal if you push it all deep down inside you.  C.S. Lewis put it best when he said it is like losing a limb.  You don’t “get over it” you learn to live with it.  It gets tough a month or two down the road when everyone goes back to their lives and you are trying to figure out how to live again.  If you need someone to talk to, you can pm me.
Giving you and your pup big hugs."

school,fe8w0e6,t1_fdiu09x,1578931623.0,"It is and it isn’t.  Everyone is different.  It also depends upon the job, the boss.  I hated every second of school but did well.  I loved learning but disliked the “I need to feel superior so I’ll teach kids” feeling some teachers gave me.  I lacked discipline in school but was a hard worker at work."
school,fe8u9g5,t3_eljwa9,1578930981.0,"Doesn’t sound legal.  Maybe since you are underage your parents will have to request your transcript.  If you were transferring to another school, they would have to send your transcript.  I don’t see how this differs."

school,fe8tcye,t3_elpnpx,1578930644.0,"Speak to your teacher and try to figure out what you can do to turn it into a positive - see what is available as far as help goes to deal with the problem.  Can you take the class elsewhere during the next semester?  Can you convince the school to let you take it concurrently with the next semester’s class while getting tutoring? When speaking to them make sure you act in a way that shows that you are taking responsibility for your failure.  Show them you’ve learned from it and want to do what you have to do to succeed in school.  Never say to them, “if you don’t...then I can’t.”  Talk to them before your mom goes to your school.  Also, I assume this is your senior year of HS?  I also assume that the course was a prerequisite for the next course?  You may have to take it in summer school. Are you in the US?  While high schools do call parents in, you are 18 and therefore an adult.  They can ask but I’m not sure of your/their rights in this situation."

ChildofHoarder,fdydeq0,t3_emz15d,1578778573.0,"According to “Stuff Compulsive Hoarding and the Meaning of Things,” it is related to anxiety and depression and often has a link to a bad relationship with one’s father (paraphrasing -probably badly).  I would imagine if it does run in one’s family it would be related to our tendency to date/marry someone like one’s father.  This may end up continuing a cycle which makes it appear inherited."

politics,fd5mb1w,t1_fcybk5u,1578179015.0,"It takes a ton of courage to rebel against what the authority of the church teaches.  It’s really difficult to risk being shunned by fellow “Christians” for being a rebel and recognizing that a Christian is supposed to love the Lord thy God with all your heart, soul, and mind and love thy neighbor as thyself.  This means loving those who don’t look like you, those of other faiths, those who are LGBTQ, Democrats, Independents, and generally everyone.  Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.  So many love the title of “Christian” but use it to judge, manipulate, and condemn those who challenge their fragile faith rather than love and stand up for those who can’t stand up for  themselves.  PS - I don’t think Jesus would approve of separating children from their parents and putting them all in cages."

There were some really outlandish names and I think the government finally got involved and put limits on what one could name their child.  “Bus stop number nine” or something like that was one name.
