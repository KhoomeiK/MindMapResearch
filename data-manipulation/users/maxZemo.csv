As a high schooler I was part of the drama club and the director would constantly verbally and emotionally abuse us until the director got their way. A group of us were going to be going on a theater trip to a different country that cost thousands of dollars per person. This trip was not through the school but through the club itself which I found weird (side note the director refused to associate the club with the school for some odd reason) after a while a couple friends began venting to me about how they were being treated and the things that were said to them so I decided to ask other members about their negative experiences with this director. After about a week or so of asking we collectively decided that it would be best to have a petition signed by all the members and given to the school in efforts of trying to either get rid of her or have another adult join as director so things would be fair again. One day she pulled me aside and confronted me saying they knew all about this petition and that she had cut the check my parents had written to go towards this trip and that I was no longer going. I went to the assistant principal after I was kicked and told him everything, about the petition and the director cutting my check without any notice, he said that he knew about it all and that I would have to talk to the athletic director who was also in charge of clubs. I told him that I knew if I talked to this guy nothing would change and he would brush it off because him and the director were all buddy buddy and he wouldn’t believe me either way. After a couple days I was called down to the office where I met with the assistant principal and the athletic director, in the meeting I made my case as to what was happening to the club members and parents of club member, and as expected I was disregarded by him. At one point he acknowledged my check and how he had cut it and this is where things became clear, after he had said his peace he got up and left the room leaving me and the assistant principal who talked to me about what he himself would try to do because he believed me, once we were done he stood up and pointed at the athletic directors desk where there was the letter I had written explaining everything and he had written all over it, highlighting sentences and names, crossing stuff out, stuff was erased. The assistant principal moved the paper to the side and showed me the check my parents had written underneath. He pocketed it and told me that he’d have it put in an envelope and given to me later in the day which it was. This just made me take a step back and realize that they were going to cash my check and use the money for something else, later in the year a rumor started going around that the school was running out of money which turned out to be true."
