Of course there is going to be a backlash against any movement to limit sex work. That one itself doesn't mean the Scandinavian model has been a failure.

Sure, edge cases might not be relevant to your personal protocol. But I'm sure you can appreciate why a legal framework *needs* to take edge cases into account.

Bad laws exist everywhere. You, on some intuitive level, must understand this, because you're arguing now for an amendment to the law. You clearly don't see the law as an inherent virtue or authority, you understand that laws can be good or bad. And a very significant part of what makes a law good or bad is *the precedent it sets*.

>Keep it to sex, where if you are not bio, then there is a need to inform. 

This is called ""special pleading"", and it's a logical fallacy. It also just isn't how laws work. There is an underlying framework of logic to the legal system that has to be considered and then tested in court. ""If you are not bio, then there is a need to inform"" *necessarily and inevitably* opens the door to all of the following:

""If you are an immigrant, there is a need to inform""

""If you are disabled, there is a need to inform""

""If you are polyamorous, there is a need to inform""

""If you are an ethnic minority, there is a need to inform""

""If you are below the poverty line, there is a need to inform""

Not really tbh. I can conceive of criteria that matter to you in a partner but that are immaterial to me.

You simply can't believe that *any* form of misrepresentation in the dating field qualifies as rape, if one's partner has sufficient objection to it. And even if you do somehow believe that, you cannot *possibly* believe that we as a society should actually be prosecuting these infractions.

I mean, people in this sub also tell each other off all the time for shaming women's looks."

That is the traditional definition. The definition in social justice discourse is slightly narrower."
fatlogic,fclc1ub,t1_fcl9d9u,1577744352.0,"Fun fact: there's actually nothing modern or incorrect about the figurative ""literally""! It's just a peculiar type of word called a [contranym,](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contronym) which is a word that means it's own opposite. Quite a lot of common English words are contranyms (fast, dust, bolt, buckle, rent, overlook). The second, contradictory definition of ""literally"" was added to the dictionary over a century ago; and the word has been used as an intensifier since at least the eighteenth century. Some of English's most celebrated old-timey writers (Dickens, Austen, Twain, Fitzgerald) used ""literally"" as an intensifier. 

**tl;dr** contrary to popular opinion, the figurative ""literally"" is literally fine."

No, but the fact that it's earned means it isn't a privilege. A privilege is by definition an unearned advantage."
