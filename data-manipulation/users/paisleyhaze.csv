socialanxiety,fglynpn,t1_fgls1x0,1580914139.0,"I apologize, I don't have much experience with depersonalization, so I can't say much. When you say you imagine having spoken to someone, does it happen instantly, or do you mean minutes or hours later that you're not sure if you talked to them?"
socialanxiety,fglyez2,t1_fglrr3s,1580913976.0,"What are your two programmed responses?

Subquestions is a term I made up. By that, I mean questions that are based on what the person just said, questions that delve deeper into a topic. For example, if someone says they like to cook, rather than saying ""Oh, cool!"" and ending the conversation there, ask them, Why do you like to cook? What are your favorite dishes to cook? What are your least favorite dishes to cook? How does cooking affect your emotions? What got you into cooking? As they answer each question, ask more and more specific questions based on what they just said. Respond and contribute your thoughts, opinions, and experiences periodically so it doesn't appear that you're just asking questions and not saying anything else."

Anxiety,fgj89v1,t3_eytwkk,1580838928.0,"Journaling. Open your mind, and write as many of your thoughts down in a stream-of-consciousness manner so they're out of your head. It doesn't matter if it's illegible or incoherent. You can even throw it away afterward if you want to."
socialanxiety,fgj62uf,t3_eyt1h1,1580837668.0,"I would suggest staying a half step ahead of the conversation mentally so that you have the next question or the next response in mind. Don't overthink it, and go with the flow. It takes tons of practice, but you'll get the hang of it in time. Questions are indispensable when it comes to carrying and maintaining a conversation. Remember to follow up with subquestions, if that makes sense."
introvert,fgj27qb,t1_fgj0rq1,1580835584.0,"I try at times, but I can't seem to overcome it. What's weird is that I drift in and out of stages where I want to be close to people and where I prefer to be alone. Sometimes people will talk as though they want to hang out, but then they move on because I tend to drag my feet and don't let them get to close. When I realize how much I took them for granted and wish they were here, they're gone."

CasualConversation,fgg81uf,t3_eybi7e,1580756251.0,"I agree. I try to put in the effort to engage with other people and show that I care, but I've realized that many people don't care to reciprocate and don't appreciate the effort that I put in. Sometimes I ask myself why I even try."

nba,ffwz375,t3_evoqpe,1580314236.0,"It's not like the Premier League. The NBA plays 82 games in the regular season. The top sixteen teams (eight from the Eastern Conference and eight from the Western Conference) then advance to the playoffs, which is tournament format, until a winner is crowned. Each round of the playoffs is a series of games, not just a one-and-done thing. There is no promotion or relegation, although I've always liked that about football. 

Look up videos on YouTube. The history of the game and the NBA is extremely fascinating and engaging. There are loads of players and teams you should look up. Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Bill Russell, Magic Johnson, Dr J., Larry Bird, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Tim Duncan, David Robinson, Allen Iverson, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan (widely regarded as the best ever), and of course Kobe Bryant. The most historic rivalry is probably between the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers.

Edit: In basketball, a win is a win, and a loss is a loss. That is, a win isn't worth three points. Standings are strictly based on a win-loss record. Go to nba.com and look around. Look at teams, rosters, standings, players, articles, etc. Watch as many games as you can. You'll get a feel for which teams and which players you like."
