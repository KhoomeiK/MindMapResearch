playblackdesert,fffog6x,t1_fffmwzd,1579888333.0,But warrior is the most fps locked class in the game.  Viable? Sure but there are combos and movement you will never do
PS4,fffo72t,t1_ffajn4v,1579888181.0,That's an FPS as your example. Reread my post.
GameStop,fffnwb4,t1_ffauvwy,1579888000.0,So is that $275 for a PS4 pro right now in trade credit? Do you foresee it ever being higher?
greentext,ffc9sh0,t1_ffan34b,1579794785.0,This was too well done. Almost didn't recognize it as satire
PS4,ffafu19,t3_esjavq,1579734755.0,"Neither HZD or Death Stranding will benefit from anything near 144FPS or mouse and keyboard.. Neither are action games or FPS that require high fps or precision. 

This post just seems like a humble brag that Sony exclusives are coming to PC"
PS4,ffaf8u0,t3_esjbto,1579734344.0,Bring in your original to show them that it's not that one.  Logically it wouldn't make sense that you have 2
playblackdesert,ff5i3xa,t1_ff311q5,1579593900.0,If you're NA this is a super exaggeration.
playblackdesert,ff5hzcb,t3_eritv2,1579593730.0,Totally worth. It doesn't run as well as the PC version but playing on a PS4 with controller is worth it.  No need to upgrade PC every year!
playblackdesert,ff5hrou,t3_errg6c,1579593452.0,"If you are building a PC anyways, go that route. It looks and runs much better.  New Xbox will be out this year also and I believe BDO will be on the new consoles."
playblackdesert,fezhzkt,t1_fez62te,1579457562.0,"Stop being triggered about shit like this, you little sensitive snowflake.  It's wrong and I dont condone it, but they are words on a screen that you can hide or scroll past."
playblackdesert,fenrx2l,t3_eq4fzm,1579289902.0,Wiz is the class to play on console by a Longshot.  The enemy can't see your skills and wizard excels at most endgame aspects
playblackdesert,feky31e,t1_fekmna3,1579209989.0,I'm talking about the PS4 pro with SSD vs Xbox one X. Not much difference
playblackdesert,fekgntg,t1_fegt28p,1579199654.0,It's not much better.
playblackdesert,fejanrc,t3_epg27h,1579164412.0,Go warrior if you just want to 1v1/open world pvp but ninja is better at those things anyway.
leaves,fehuvk3,t3_ep7wkj,1579124335.0,Just tell them the truth and stand up for what you believe in. Lead the way and others will follow. There will be resistance at first when you're on this path.
playblackdesert,feh9epy,t1_fc7s800,1579111884.0,I'm late but Musa is VERY popular on PS4
playblackdesert,fefl42y,t3_eoupv4,1579058633.0,SSD and pro doesn't change much!? You are very wrong.  Doesn't make the game smooth as silk but runs much better.
