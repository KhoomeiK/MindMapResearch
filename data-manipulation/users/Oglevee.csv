It's not really a racket. And it is not affective in making cars safer. They have a state set price ($21  in ny) so the mechanics don't really see a lot of money unless they scrape off your sticker and say you need repairs to get a new one. It is a weird system where it feels you need to come do a ceremony and pay a small fee to be able to drive in ny.
