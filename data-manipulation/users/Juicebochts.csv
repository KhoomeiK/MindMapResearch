Last election cycle you constantly heard bitching about hillary and correct the record/shareblue trying to put Republican propaganda into actual context, like the famous Nancy Pelosi line, ""you'll have to pass it to find out what's in it,"" in reference to the american care act.(which was effing Romney care.)  Because the actual line was, ""we've given Republicans over ""x amount of months"" to actually read this and they keep saying, ""who knows what's in this bill."" That operation had a budget to the tune of 7million. 

Which I can admit, astroturfing is fucking stupid,because I'm not a one sided piece of no thought garbage.

 Well the Republican branch of that was called cambridge analytica, they were fuxking raided and shut down due to illegal operations, and more than a couple of their leadership/members being imprisoned.  Their budget..

Over $70million.

He absolutely can, and hes displayed it in grand rapids already. His biggest problem seems to be how long it takes him to adjust to new situations, which wont be a huge problem in the red wings system because he wont be rushed, but it takes him a while to feel comfortable in any league.  (~2 years in the qmjhl) and it seems like it's going to follow him to the ahl, and then again for the show.  Hopefully.
