trashy,ff887sh,t1_ff873k5,1579668825.0,"Sorry, but this makes no sense.  If the car is from 2005, presumably it's paid off entirely.  Why would anyone blow $300-$450 (per month) for a newer car --for essentially nothing other than superficial reasons-- when they have a working vehicle that is paid off. 

And you ask why an employer shouldn't probe further?  Because where does it end?  For all we know, he has a 2005 car (depreciating asset) but invested the money he saved into purchasing a home which is increasing in value each year.  Should the employer not be checking all the people with newer cars to ensure they own their own homes instead of rent, since they're ""so"" concerned about the financial well-being of their staff.

No because that would be ridiculous. This HR person should be let go for this nonsense."

If anything, I think Nurse is screwing him by leaving him on the floor so long when he clearly can't handle it.

Slightly less shocking, however, is how observant and situationally aware Cigarette Guy was.  My friends who grew up in projects are the same way, I guess because unfortunately they had no choice but to stay alert at all times for safety purposes. And that resulted in them becoming hyper-sensitive to situations that seem ""off"".  Also not to blow up his spot, but if he was out by himself smoking a cigarette presumably at a crazy late hour, perhaps he had a ""profession"" that resulted in him knowing many people in that neighborhood and what was normal/abnormal to see in that building, which was why he was so quick to deduce that your situation was majorly wrong.
