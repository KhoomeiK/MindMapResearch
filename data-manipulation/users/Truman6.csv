BetterEveryLoop,fcpay32,t1_fcp5rfi,1577856628.0,I was wondering. I think you nailed it.
maybemaybemaybe,fcpaiep,t3_eidnri,1577856191.0,"I’m watching dick Clark’s New Year’s Eve bash when a young man is introduced on stage. He’s slightly pudgy with a noticeable hunch. He’s on stage in a pink sequined suit that doesn’t fit well and is lip syncing to ai generated, auto tuned, “audio entertainment” for mass production. He’d obviously fallen asleep drunk in the dorm room the night before. His “friends” doodled all over his face ;-). Apparently this guy is the most talented the us has to offer?  I don’t understand. He doesn’t dance well. If he was able to sing well, why the auto tune?  He’s not in good shape. When seacrest asked him a question, he said he didn’t have much to say...what is going on?  I think I’m out of touch."
