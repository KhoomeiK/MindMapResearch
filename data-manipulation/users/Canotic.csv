If your next argument is ""but I get matched with predators and that sucks!"" then congrats you proved the point. Nobody likes being matched with people far above their skill level. For the majority of people, SBMM works wonders because we don't have to compete with tryhards.

Where SBMM falls down is where the number of players at that skill level is too few to match efficiently, so they get matched with people below them (because these are the top players and there is nobody above them). This sucks for the one percenters who are closer to the 0.1 percenters. But it sucks for them in the same way it sucks for everyone else if the one percenters joined their matches! This way it only happens to a smaller part of the player base, rather than everyone.

I second the recommendation to go to r/justnomil, they have lots of stories and strategies about this sort of thing.

You can expect family to think you are the asshole, because they are used to your mother, and are used to just let her get her way to avoid drama. Thus, when someone does *not* let her get her way, they get stressed, and lash out at you because now there is drama. With luck, this will pass, and with time you might find out that other people see your point of view, especially if you explain it to them and don't let your mothers version be the only one they hear (and that version is clearly going to be that you are horrible to her for no good reason and it is all your wifes fault)."

AmItheAsshole,fdu6qu2,t1_fds8w2c,1578728561.0,"Well, first of all, I didn't use the word 'accuse', I said it didn't mean that he thought she was cheating. I think there might be a slight difference between the two, but English is my second language.

The easiest way to do it is through analogy.

If I get into your car and put on a seat belt, it does not mean that I think it is likely that you will crash.

If I buy home insurance, it does not mean that I think it is likely that the house will burn down.

If I get a rabies shot, it does not mean that I think it is likely that I'll be bitten by a rabid dog.

There are many situations that are unlikely, but have really big effects if they do occur. So even though we don't think them likely, we still take precautions just in case they are.

Parenthood is pretty much the biggest single change you will go through in your life. Verifying that you are indeed the father doesn't mean that you think it is likely that she cheated, it's taking reasonable precautions in case you are wrong.

Or let's take an example from my personal life. Me and my wife are married (obviously). We have a prenup that states that our personal finances are separate and that everything we buy jointly for the household is not. We have two separate savings accounts for our daughter, because it was impossible to have joint ownership of that sort of account.

This is not because either of us think it's likely that we will divorce, or that if we do divorce, we won't be able to sort things out amicably. No, it is because we want to protect our daughter and each other from economic problems in case we \*do\* divorce, and one of us \*does\* turn into a shithead. Likelihood doesn't enter into it, and it's not a judgement of the other person. It's just a precaution in case it turns out we are mistaken."
AmItheAsshole,fds5m1m,t3_emr755,1578694880.0,"YTA. Not for being pissed, and not for having an abortion, but for completely blowing up without trying to at least talk after you had both cooled down.

He fucked up by asking for the paternity test right away, but it appears from the Op that he realised this and tried to explain and rephrase and deescalate. You got angry, but then refused to see his side of the story (just as he fucked up by not seeing your side of the story) but instead of talking it through, you escalate and refuse to talk at all. You were both under a lot of stress, but you are using that to justify your own reaction, and not his.

  


And a slight thing about asking for a paternity test: doing that does not mean you think your partner has cheated. It doesn't even mean that you think your partner would ever cheat, or be the sort of person who cheats.

It means acknowledging that your partner might theoretically have cheated. Which has nothing to do with you thinking that they actually did. But given the really significant life change that parenthood is, even given a really low likelihood of cheating it can be best to be sure. Being a father isn't just a legal responsibility, it's a moral one as well, and you will want to be sure about everything.

It's like how some people become offended if you put on a seat belt when they drive. Putting on a seat belt does not mean I think you are a bad driver and will crash. It means that I know that crashes happen, and if they do I might die. So I wear one even though I don't think the driver is a bad driver."
AmItheAsshole,fds3czw,t1_fdr6co7,1578693694.0,"They are both allowed to fuck up due to emotional stress. But his fuckup, which *he acknowledged and backtracked from in the discussion itself,* is not the same as her fuckup, which she continued with after the discussion was over and continues to this day. 

It's fine that he asked for a paternity test. It is also fine that she got really pissed about it. He panicked and wanted to verify if he was the father (which is *not* the same as saying he thinks she cheated), and did not consider her feelings when he asked for it. She felt accused of cheating, got angry and threw him out then and there. Those are both understandable reactions given the emotional situation and shock, for both of them.

What is *not* fine, is that she then dumped him, blocked him, and refused to talk to him at all, for ever after. He realized his fuckup immediately and tried to rephrase and deescalate the situation. She did not.  

We are making allowances for part of both their reactions. Her reaction is much larger and longer lasting than his, however. I mean, hell, does he even know that she had an abortion at this stage? Is he wondering if he is unknowingly a dad?"

insanepeoplefacebook,fci1x88,t1_fchl33p,1577656760.0,"For me, with my daughter, it's basically accepting that you can't control everything, so it is pointless to try. I think some parents can't accept this, so they over compensate and become very sheltering. (My sister in law did not let her kids run barefoot, because they could theoretically step on a bee)

So you need to mentally and emotionally understand that you can do your best, but at the end of the day, you can't prevent everything. But the thing is, neither can everyone else, and their kids survive just fine. Most kids are perfectly healthy. Your kid will be fine if you let them ride bikes and let other people handle them and you take them to the beach early. They will not break their neck, get diseases or get eaten by seagulls if you do. Kids are resilient. You can make mistakes, and it will not kill them. 

Understanding this is hard, but necessary I think. It's kind of like getting on an airplane. You need to accept that you have absolutely no control over the fact that you are thousands of feet into the air and have placed your life into the hands of a couple of bored strangers in the cockpit.
