politics,ff5ftg9,t1_ff4l7bb,1579591001.0,"I think disinterest and ignorance regarding politics has been a contributing factor. At least in my surroundings people are generally clueless regarding what politicians actually do when they get to power, so they vote for the ones that promise the largest tax reductions and easy solutions to difficult problems."
technology,femah1p,t1_fem2wy7,1579245969.0,"I assume KaliReborn refers so something that is taught in every machine learning course: Remove the human experts on the subject and treat the problem as pure statistics and you will get better results.

What this means in the case of Twitter bots is that you take *all* the information you have on a set of users (maybe 100000 or so, but it's up to the designers). I.e. their complete post history, timestamps, ip addresses, user profile info, browser thumbprints, cookies, etc. If you also have some users that you have previously identified as bot accounts you can feed all this data into an ML algorithm, which will calculate some parameters that will allow you to identify other accounts that have similarities with the ones you said were bots before. It won't be perfect, but I'd be willing to bet that it would outperform any algorithm to find bots designed with the help of psychologists and sociologists.

But you are of course right, using ML to solve problems can be misleading. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to stop governments and tech giants from doing it. However in the case of Twitter this will probably be solved by allowing you to send them a copy of your drivers licence to prove your human identity, in case you are mislabeled as a bot."

I actually had Haribo gummy candy at home already (pacifiers, not bears though)"
todayilearned,feh07oa,t1_feg921l,1579106400.0,"Contrary to what it may sound like, I don't give a rats ass about gummy bears. The thing that annoys me, and inspired me to write a long rant early in the morning, is companies constantly trying to mislead consumers and the notion that they could get in trouble for it.

Haribo aren't really bad the guys here either because it's just a tiny section on their web page, but there are other companies that inflate the amount of protein in their products by adding mostly useless ingredients like gelatin and BCAA. In their marketing they push their candy, soda, ice cream, etc. as a healthy choice with high protein while in reality you're paying a premium price for something that will have as much impact on your training results as a diet Coke."
todayilearned,fegeipk,t1_feg2cx3,1579089982.0,"Oops. It was early in the morning, I kept writing ""gummy beards"" but I think I managed to catch those"
todayilearned,feg1s78,t1_fefwolu,1579073220.0,"For writing something incorrect in an FAQ on a web page? I doubt it

Besides that, I think companies are more likely to intentionally mislead people than outright lie. Based on the post title and many comments here I think OP and most posters here interpreted the FAQ like Haribou wanted, i.e. that gummy bears are much healthier than they thought, because they have so many nutrients. Obviously people understand that they also have a lot of sugar, which might be less healthy.

Though if you read the FAQ carefully you see that Haribou never claimed any of the things people think they did. They said never said that gummy bears have 9/10 essential amino acids, they said that *gelatin* does. The amino acid profile of gelatin depends on what it's made from and the manufacturing process.

Then there's that thing about sustaining human life. It's correct that we need essential amino acids to survive, and that you might find 9/10 of them in gelatin, but it doesn't say anything about how much of each. The FAQ even ends with saying that gelatin is has a lot of non-essential amino acids (i.e. not the ""10 needed to sustain human life"") and is lacking certain essential amino acids. Wikipedia says ""It contains no tryptophan and is deficient in isoleucine, threonine, and methionine."" so it sounds more like gelatin has no significant amounts of 4 of the essentials. It also says that 50% of the gelatin consists of common non-essential amino acids.

I'll end with a quote from someone who's less likely to be biased regarding gelatin (also known as hydrolyzed collagen btw). It sounds a bit different than when Haribou is describing gelatin, doesn't it?

> Collagen has a low content of essential amino acids, and excessive amounts in foods reduce their nutritive value.

StallmanWasRight,fdujcap,t3_emxeh2,1578733961.0,"Wrong subreddit? I'm pretty sure Stallman would think Honey is malware too, and doesn't give two shits about what Amazon and Paypal do to each other.

But if you want to discuss this here I think The Verge's defense of Honey doesn't hold.. They quote the privacy policy:

> it states that Honey doesn’t sell personal information, nor does it track search engine history, emails, or browsing data on any non-retail site.

Now that PP owns the company it's irrelevant if Honey sells personal information, since they can just give it to Paypal who are then free to merge it with the rest of the information they've gathered on people.

The second part of the sentence implies that they are free to track search engine history, emails, or browsing data on retail sites. So the privacy policy is only saying ""we won't track *everything* you do online"".

Then they go on to quote a Honey spokesperson who say they're acting in the users' best interest, but that's what Google, Facebook and everybody else is saying too. They have to track our browsing across sites, build extensive profiles  and generally invade our privacy to provide the services we want, show us relevant ads and make us buy things etc."

Finland, like many other countries, has a lumber industry that grows trees for harvesting. If they plant 150 million trees per year they also likely cut down around 150 million other trees.

Some things I've picked up from watching him (because I also died a lot when switching to build 41 beta):

* Sneak/crouch when there are zombies nearby
* Never fight more than 1 zombie at a time if possible
* If you have to fight 2 run around a car until they split up and you can deal with them 1 at a time
* Kill a small group of zombies by slowly walking towards them until you get the attention of one of them, back off, kill it and repeat
* If you get unwanted attention, run behind a building to break line of sight. Then hide somewhere before they show up.
* Plan engagements ahead and have an escape plan. If you get heavily exhausted while being chased you're pretty much dead.
