> Thats ridiculous on its face. 

Says the guy calling Fascism, the ur-example of extreme right, a left-wing ideology

> Its about as bullshit as it gets. And very obviously comes from a biased perspective. Theres no hierarchy in leftist nations ha! 

I'm not talking about how things shake out, I'm talking about what the ideology espouses and claims to be working towards. If you were to point out that life under leftist and rightist autocracies wasn't much different, you wouldn't be the first. This is why boiling everything down to a one-dimensional spectrum is reductive. It can be helpful to imagine a second axis, Libertarian vs Authoritarian, to give a 2D plane on which to plot the various governments and ideologies, but of course that has its limits as well. The website [The Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org/) claims to have pioneered that approach, even though their methodology is murky.

In any case - if a movement claims to be all about creating an egalitarian society, then it's a Lefty movement. Even if it spectacularly fails to do so. If it's about making sure things stay just as they were in the Good Old Days, then it's probably on the Right. Although I'll admit I'm not quite sure how to classify a movement that claims to want things like they were in the Good Old Days When We Were Communist, like a Putin or similar. Probably Right, because of the ultra-nationalism, but a strong argument could be made the other way too. 

> The fact is there's more egalitarianism in right wing capitalist liberal democracies than has EVER been found in leftist totalitarian regimes. And its funny to me that anyone would suggest otherwise.

Wait, so the Left is only totalitarian regimes now? I feel like your definition is different than it was a few comments ago. Of course people are better off in democracies than dictatorships, it doesn't matter whether they're Left or Right. The most actually-egalitarian societies I've spent time in have been the Nordic countries. Going by [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality) instead of by anecdote, though, the USA consistently ranks as less egalitarian than the socialist hellholes of modern Europe. And you'll note that there are some horrible dictatorships that score pretty high for income equality (ironically, some of them right wing dictatorships).

> There is not a single example of this leftist egalitarian Utopia you speak of.

So what? Once again, classifications of ideology have to be about the contents of the ideology, not the outcomes. I guess we could also have a ""usefulness"" metric, but that's a different metric than left-right."
worldnews,ffjmxvj,t1_ffjl9w8,1580001969.0,"> Its especially silly that youre saying this at the same time as saying the right preserves the status quo. Newsflash. The status quo is different today.

Right, but ""preserve the status quo"" is Right then and is Right now. That the status quo is different (and thus the policies of the parties seeking to preserve it) doesn't change things.

> Your definition is basically just left=love and compassion and spice and everything nice while the right=all the bad things

Absolutely not - communist dictatorships were certainly left-wing because they painted themselves as egalitarian and their stated ideology (however inconsistently followed) was all about bringing about an egalitarian utopia. There's nothing egalitarian about the stated ideology of Fascist movements, being as it was all about racial hierarchies and suchlike. There are autocracies on the Left and also on the Right, and it's by their stated ideologies that we classify them. No amount of ""I love Marx and my movement is totally socialist you guys"" will cancel out the ""and also we are a master race and the natural order of things is that the other races are below us"". Let's not forget that nobody would have classified the German Democratic Republic or Democratic People's Republic of Korea as democracies.

The basic ""Egalitarian"" vs ""Hierarchy"" is about as widely accepted as things get, with some variation on the specifics. Your definition is fringe at best. I'm sure there's a subreddit somewhere that is full of people who agree with you, but it's very distant from the mainstream."

Never mind that the terms ""Left"" and ""Right"" have been used in politics since about 20-30 years before Marx was even born. And yes, generally, they *do* mean the same things as back then - ""left"" means wanting egalitarianism, ""right"" means supporting stricter social hierarchies and generally protecting the status quo (or restoring it to an imagined former state).

English is a Germanic language, so they're pretty close together to start with, but German has fewer special cases and generally follows its rules better.
