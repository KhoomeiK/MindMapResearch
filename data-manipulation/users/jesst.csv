JustNoTruth,fg046ua,t1_fg029i2,1580399835.0,I had a friend who was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was really young. she went through chemo and everything. It came back like 5 years later. Between the first diagnosis and it returning they discovered the gene for it and she was tested when it came back. She has the gene so they recommended a double mastectomy and hysterectomy. She refused because she wanted kids. She then refused all fucking treatment and went full mercola. She ended up dying. It was so fucking upsetting. If she had just had treatment she could have been here today. She had plenty of friends who would have jumped to be her surrogate if it was needed. Fuck I'm like the shittiest pregnant person alive and I would have done it. It was devastating.

JustNoTruth,ffj7ogk,t1_ffj2yeu,1579992445.0,"Infertility is a medical problem so using cutesy terms makes people not understand the severity of it. When you're going through infertility it's a really difficult thing. It's doctors appointments every other day, its months of testing, medical procedures, its expensive, and its absolutely fucking soul crushing.

It's also important to recognise where the term ""snowflake adoption"" comes from and why it's origin is so degrading. Embryo adoption started because many religious groups are against IVF. First off (like the OP in the linked post) they consider it to be unnatural and immoral. I know of women on reddit who have received death threats for having IVF from christian groups. There is an entire religious based trying subreddit that exists to degrade women going through infertility treatments. These same people are also generally pro-lifers and ""embryos are people too!"" bull shit. So a while back some christian organisations bought up abandoned embryos to put up for ""adoption"". They called them ""snowflake babies"" because they were ""babies"" that women had frozen. So in terms of the grossness that is all that kind of religious pro-life bull shit the term is uncomfortable.

I don't even like the term embryo adoption. I don't like calling it an adoption. You're not adopting anything. For legal purposes it's a property transfer not an adoption. If someone else gets pregnant with my embryo and carries a baby to term that's not my baby, it's theirs. They haven't adopted it."

We gave them access to her medical records. So they can check on her development. They may also ask us back for additional scans. 

They were researching if there are any brain differences that can be detected at birth for children across for developmental issues (so mostly autism). So in 15 years or so they can compare if there is a way to detect the early stages of autism. As our daughter appears to be neurotypical (she turns 2 in a few weeks so I guess it could change) she will likely be part of the control group.

ShitMomGroupsSay,ffdo0l0,t1_ffcjkwd,1579824954.0,"So on a Thursday I pick my 4 year old daughter up from nursery at 3. We go 2 buildings over to a coffee shop for half an hour and then we go back to where her nursery is for a drama lesson. Her friend was desperate to go to the drama lesson but his mum couldn't make it work and I offered to pick him up from nursery and he can hang out with us then I drop him off at drama. At that point I am free for an hour. I usually hang out there and get some work done. She turns up like 15 minutes after drama class starts and I am back down to being responsible for one kid. (I have two kids. My husband works from home on a Thursday so I don’t have to do this with both my kids). 

She pays me. Every week she puts £10 in her sons school bag. I use it to buy the kids a cookie at the coffee shop. She refuses to take the change back. Our kids have known each other for years and are friends, it's actually less work for me to have him around because they entertain each other. 

I don’t understand the disconnect that some people have about not paying people who are looking after your kid. I understand some people can't afford a super expensive daycare or whatever. I know some people can't afford huge amounts for day care and that's fine. If someone helps you out though, look after them. Offer to watch their kids sometimes, make them some fucking cookies.
