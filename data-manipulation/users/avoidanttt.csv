depression,ffhsow5,t3_etow1n,1579951907.0,"> But I've never really complained to anyone apart from here on reddit where no one even reads my posts.

Well, maybe, it's high time to start? Maybe you'll connect to more people around you. 

> I wish these people knew what it was actually like. 

Tell them? It's not common knowledge or common sense. Most people are mentally healthy after all. 

> I left and **called them attention seekers** and they said I don't understand what it's like to cut.

What did you expect? Being rude to somebody would never change their mind. 

> The same group will constantly talk of how they wish they were anorexic so they weren't so fat. 

This kind of thinking is how the illness often starts. Except normally it's in online spaces that you don't see on daily basis (I hope). Anorexia is a part of certain aesthetic. 

> I just don't understand how they self diagnose and want these illnesses but see I who is struggling and apparently I'm the attention seeker.

Self-diagnosis is how you know something's wrong. It's how people know when it's time to seek help and research how to cope. 

It's pretty harmless for them even if they self diagnose wrong. CBT/mindfulness techniques you could find online are harmless for a healthy person. As for medications, they are all hated behind prescriptions. You are very unlikely to fool a licensed professional. 

Also, how are you attention seeking if you say you don't share your issues? 

> I just wish people were more understanding and knew that sometimes a joke to them is a reality to others.

It's a coping mechanism for a lot of people, you don't necessarily have to sulk 24/7. Laughing at your own issues makes them feel less catastrophic. I certainly recommend you try it yourself. 

The whole thing is a side effect of mental health being more accepted as a reality. It will benefit you further down the line and you'll be better off than generations before you. 

Remember how homosexuality was a trend in 80-90s? How many celebrities pretended to be a gay or a lesbian as a part of their image? Trends come and go, but there are lasting effects to things they illustrate. Maybe one day the stigma behind therapy and medication will disappear just like gay marriage was legalized."

2meirl4meirl,ffhpf4p,t1_ffh7f12,1579946856.0,"Not other races, but other ethnicities. I'm Eastern European and it's abso-fucking-lutely unacceptable to force your kids to pay rent here. They might ask you to help with a bill or two here and there, but nowhere near the price of rent. Whenever I tell someone here that Americans do that, all I hear is calling them insane or lacking empathy. 

In fact, here your parents are legally bound to support you financially if you're a full time student younger than 23. You could even sue them for alimony if they don't do that, but it usually never comes to that. There are similar laws for supporting elderly parents here, but that's besides the point."

AmItheAsshole,fff0ttg,t1_ferid8t,1579872549.0,"It's still a variation of the norm here in Eastern Europe. I've lived with a girl who specifically woke up in the asscrack of dawn just so her bf won't see her without makeup. She was around my age, and I'm in my early 20s."

depression,ffexxvu,t1_ffeqt5o,1579869883.0,"Wouldn't say shallow, just honest. It's a well researched topic, and a pretty depressing one if you're below average where you are. The average earnings, the halo effect... 

We can only wish people we meet are empathetic or self-aware enough to acknowledge and look further than that."
depression,ffewxjn,t1_fferj1x,1579868864.0,"You don't have to be his punching bag. You deserve better even if you think you don't. 

What are you getting out of this? He might just toss you aside once he's got everything he wanted out of you. He could even sabotage you for his own gain. You do you, of course, but I wouldn't keep a snake like this around. I hope you find kind and supportive people soon."
depression,ffew3ct,t1_ffeno85,1579867977.0,"I think, it's often about establishing a pecking order. Or something like ""I see familiarity in this person's issues, am uncomfortable, and must attack them to prove to myself that I'm different""."
2meirl4meirl,ffceoq5,t1_ffc1i0p,1579797847.0,"Like hell, they do! Probably because they never experienced being fuckzoned by a creep or someone they just aren't into."

Piracy,ff9r7q0,t1_ff539hj,1579719299.0,"Adding 4pda to the list for all sorts of apps for Android and iOS, often with cracks and mods as options. Also on Russian, but you'll only need to know about 10 words to navigate it. It also has an android app.

Also, there's nnm-club, also a decent tracker with moderation. I prefer it over Rutracker because I've never once downloaded something infected there."
Piracy,ff9qbqt,t1_ff5qbxx,1579718613.0,"It's all over the place here in eastern Europe. Most large cities have 3G/4G, but there are always districts where it suddenly switches to 2G/no signal. Certain towns only have 2G, I mostly notice that when travelling on a train, when it switches from the usual no signal to edge. 

Sometimes there are ""holes"" in the coverage. E.g., the place right on top of my desk. Even having multiple SIM cards won't save you. Oddly enough, I've never once lost signal in the subway."
awfuleverything,ff9nztq,t1_ff8qkxe,1579716985.0,"Ikr. Sometimes you're forced into it if you want to watch, listen or play something. 

Online services like Netflix and Spotify have never made it into my country and you can't pay for them or use them even with vpn. They see it on your card info where you're from and deny you access. And this is all despite people begging for them to open here on the forums since the beginning. Before that, your options would be dodgy rentals (with unmarked DVDs) or piracy. 

I refuse to be a good customer to someone who doesn't consider me a customer. So, piracy it is."
depression,fexeiuk,t1_fex7ilh,1579429699.0,"Can't relate at all. I struggle with lack of movement and my muscles often hurt after working on computer for a long time. I'm on a lower end of normal BMI. The rest of my family is the same way.

Running and swimming seem to make the most difference, but like many other things, I feel better only during it. I just get the bonus of no muscle pain."
depression,fewoziv,t1_fevqgfc,1579417304.0,"I think, it helps you if you neglected yourself badly by not moving too much. If you get neck/back pains from constant sitting or lying down or if your muscles protest too much if you move. Would help you mitigate a consequence of your depression, make you maybe 5%, maybe 20% less miserable, but definitely won't cure you."
OCD,feulo80,t3_eqm12v,1579387690.0,I have a similar thing with numbers. The number of repetitions must be a multiple of 5. I take exactly two sips of my drink before eating.
2meirl4meirl,feu3lyb,t1_feppr9q,1579382782.0,You need a doc's examination. A friend of mine had CFS-like symptoms for a very trivial reason — chronic sinus issues and polyps in his nose. I had this (in a worse form than now) because of iron deficiency anemia. Might just be a mental illness alone.
wowthanksimcured,fetpvup,t1_fetn3ry,1579378166.0,"> From what I understand, mental health treatment in RU is mostly limited to Alzheimer's treatment.

Not really, no.

> so treatment for depression? whats that?

We get the same prescriptions as you yanks, but more often generics. The pills made abroad that are cleaner (better cleaned from the byproducts of reactions that cause side effects) are extremely expensive.

There are good psychiatrists, especially, in bigger cities. But some would just recommend you to pray your illness away or give you something like dimedrol to knock you out if you're in inpatient care, or even overdose you.

But yeah, Russians are terribly ignorant about anything mental health. In early USSR, a lot of psychiatry seemed punitive, some of it still appears this way, hahaha. Visit psy web on VK (Russian Facebook) if you can read Russian and want to know more."
wowthanksimcured,fetfwjd,t1_fetf252,1579375077.0,I genuinely feel better after scrolling the posts for a bit. What makes me feel worse is sorting the comments by controversial. Good to know you know me better than myself. Have a nice day.
wowthanksimcured,fetdh4e,t1_fetbv5f,1579374222.0,"> clearly absolutely nothing EVER will!!!

Never seen this last part ever expressed on this sub, and I visit it regularly. 

You're not qualified to give advice if you're not a medical professional and the most intuitive advice is often damaging and stupid, and people have a valid reason to criticize it. E.g., if someone told you to argue with your inappropriate invasive thoughts with OCD or visualizing your negative thoughts shrinking and disappearing, which later becomes yet another pattern to torment you."
