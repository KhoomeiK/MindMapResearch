I've literally never seen his name mentioned without it immediately being reminded that hey, he's a fucking creep who got with a 13 year old girl and like yeah, it's messed up, but it's just really annoying seeing it every time so I guess some people just pretend to not know what really happened just to troll."

bestof,fgi412m,t1_fghy6kz,1580804495.0,Why do you have to be either left or right or one party or another? You can agree with certain things Republicans and Democrats believe in without having to be demonized. This kind of thinking is what pushes people further into the extremes of either side.

Its personally my favorite European league, even being a Bayern fan. Although the constant dominance of Juve gets boring the way they play can be beautiful and I love the players that are in the league. I feel like alot of them have very original styles of play you don't see in many leagues. Anyway Scudetto is just the league title but you should watch it to learn more"
soccer,ffw9nir,t1_fftu6fv,1580291202.0,I thought your original comment was stupid but this takes the cake
soccer,ffw9ll0,t1_fftu54q,1580291119.0,Dude it's a haircut who says they think they're dope mfers yall give so much more thought to these players haircuts then even they do and they actually enjoy it
soccer,ffw9k8w,t1_fftt5re,1580291063.0,Fucking hell honestly how can people here say with a straight face that a haircut and hanging with friends can distract you from a match. If they were at home drinking with their mates none would bat an eye but as soon as hair is involved apparently it can ruin a players game
soccer,ffw9h4j,t1_ffu5z42,1580290929.0,Don't worry man these guys are crazy. Saying you don't understand how serious a haircut is and not even being self aware enough to realize how crazy that sounds. It's just a weird obsession people have with how players do their hair.
soccer,ffw9dg9,t1_ffw93dt,1580290775.0,But they arent wasting it they can afford to spend more and it probably is proportional to what a working class person spends. If they were really wasting it theyd be broke quickly. If anything it's better for the economy for them to put money back into other peoples pockets then just hoarding it
soccer,ffw9bc4,t1_ffw93dt,1580290683.0,Did you change your comment I thought you originally said I didnt Read your comment right?
soccer,ffw98uz,t1_ffw93dt,1580290576.0,I was mainly responding to your first 2 parts of the comment I completely agree with the unfairness of how scrutinized players are but I just don't see the problem with rich people spending insane amounts of money like they have the money is it better to just hoard it all? But w/ sportsmen I just feel like they really earned their pay and should get to spend it in any way they want
soccer,ffw928b,t1_ffv1tw2,1580290300.0,So what they can only spend money in the way a working class person can. Football players are rich they live different lives. Just because they can spend more doesnt make them different people they still love the same sport we do
soccer,ffw7wrl,t1_ffw7d21,1580288589.0,Lol so you're one of those guys. It's their own hair it's just like someone liking nice clothes they can do what they want it's like saying someone with a hobby is obsessed. It's just because you don't like it that suddenly it's an obsession. Like how often do you think they do this it's just a nice way to enjoy themselves and feel good about the way they look. Would you prefer he goes out partying and getting into fights like the old school guys?
nba,ffvt9n7,t1_ffvi15r,1580272606.0,"Fr they're taking so much meaning from some innocent comment then acting like they're getting attacked about nothing, shits weird"
nba,ffvprxz,t1_ffvmq6q,1580269907.0,Idk why everyone thinks every response is an attack or mean or aggressive. Like when did i ever say anything to make it seen like im attacking you or anything I'm just trying to defend the guy who everyone has decided was a dick for such a simple comment. Not once did I say anything even slightly aggressive.
nba,ffvmswc,t1_ffvcxtt,1580267825.0,I like how I had so many upvotes until all these fans started crying about making fun of a Knicks fan when it's literally what everyone here jokes about
nba,ffvmptb,t1_ffvjc56,1580267767.0,The reason Kobe has those fans in the first place is because he never left the team like why do you assume how someone would act when you have no idea about our team or its history
nba,ffvmnmi,t1_ffvjdlc,1580267725.0,Why all I did was call him out for multiple times telling someone else how they're supposed to feel if Kobe leaves our team and all I did was make the joke everyone else does that Knicks have no success
nba,ffvjdqr,t1_ffvj4va,1580265503.0,So was consistently arguing how a Lakers fan was supposed to feel about Kobe leaving but that guy wouldn't stop doing it what's so bad about saying facts that Knicks don't win anything
nba,ffvj1qf,t1_ffvi1d3,1580265274.0,Did you not read my comment? Maybe they posted it to add more meaning to it?
nba,ffvhdkd,t1_ffvgrqr,1580264149.0,It's a reddit thread nothing here is really a big deal it's all a bunch of fucking around but this all started cause you gave a snarky reply to a well meaning comment acting like he was all pissed off. And all your replies just prove what I'm saying when you don't have any good replies all you say is why you mad or chill out it's just lazy. But yeah no worries you don't have to reply or even explain why you arent. You don't owe me or anyone else here anything it was just a simple argument/discussion have a good one.
nba,ffvgvvm,t1_ffvgljw,1580263827.0,"Why look at it so. negatively if anything its saying no they're not S and N, two legendary character known for their brotherhood. They're even bigger than that, Shaq and Kobe. We should all stop being so negative and try to see that hey maybe this guy didnt mean it in a negative way especially when most people here are just trying to honor Kobe. Like your comment is inferring so much negativity that I just don't see.

 Aslo condescending and offensive? Come on man that's just too much it was a simple reply please stop being so easily offended it's just gonna make life harder. Try to look at this like Kobe would, you really think he would think that's in any way offensive or condescending?"
nba,ffvggow,t1_ffvg50q,1580263548.0,"Come on man yall need to not take stuff so personally. If anything he was just adding to the comment by saying they're more than just naruto and sasuke, they're Kobe and Shaq legends even bigger than some hugely popular characters which says alot about their brotherhood and legacy. People here are all trying to honor him in their way. no need to make this something it's not or to assume people mean something hurtful when they don't. And if the guy thought it was mean let him reply, don't get up in arms over something that had nothing to do with you the guy who made the OC of naruto and sasuke probably didn't even think it was a mean reply so just chill dog. Like belittling really?"
nba,ffvfwsm,t1_ffvfarb,1580263180.0,How was his comment not nice?
nba,ffvfgx2,t1_ffvdpcx,1580262883.0,Oh yeah I'm definitely kinda mad but the guy above you was completely chill. And also what narrative I just described your reply in detail. And that's what I'm saying the whole relax thing is so lazy like actually try to reply or what's the point of commenting
nba,ffvdj9t,t1_ffukr4i,1580261584.0,Really what did she say?
nba,ffvdfa6,t1_ffvcee8,1580261507.0,"Bro where did it seem in his comment that you ""rustled his jimmies"" it was the most laid back response ever. People here must have horrible social skills when all I ever see is people replying to mundane comments with ""dont be so angry"" or ""take it easy, chill out"". like come on yall just assume you're so good at riling people up and getting reactions from people when really nobody thinks twice about what yall said let alone got mad over it. 

TLDR: nobody but you had their jimmies rustled. People need to stop replying to any argument they get with ""why you mad?"""
nba,ffvcxtt,t1_ffvayav,1580261180.0,Yeah tell a Lakers fan how he would be okay if Kobe left for the Clippers. Maybe its cause you're a Knicks fans and haven't had any success in your life so you wouldnt know what it's like to lose that in the first place
nba,ffvctld,t1_ffvblr2,1580261101.0,Lol we're entitled because we wouldnt want our franchise player and legend to leave? Wow I guess everyone is entitled then. This is a Lakers town if any of our stars moved straight to the Clippers thered be jerseys burning and everything.
nba,ffvc64q,t1_fftefx1,1580260665.0,Lol calling him lazy when you dont even try to use basic reasoning to understand his comment

soccer,ffu0km2,t3_ev7h9n,1580231884.0,Weird football fans obsessed with players and their hair what else is new? Idk what's up with this generation getting shit on for their hair. I've seen it so much in the last 5 years. Like people get genuinely mad at players for having anything that's not the most basic haircut ever.
soccer,fftzea5,t1_fftutie,1580231062.0,The replay thing you guys do is ridiculous. Like how badly does your FA want you to play even more games
soccer,fftz6jh,t1_ffto86w,1580230917.0,I doubt half the people here even watched football back then or were even old enough to watch them. You gotta realize how young this sub is and Peps Barca was already 10 years ago. Most of these guys were probably 5 to 8 year olds back then which is crazy to think about
zelda,fft2yc5,t1_ffsz8h3,1580204261.0,Its a hugely popular show most of the fans are probably casual viewers who take no part in the actual fandom. Its not some hidden gem show that only nerds know about

lakers,ffssv66,t1_ffrgkeb,1580191223.0,Just let them grieve maybe that's all he wants to say he doesnt owe us his feelings that stuff can stay in private which I'm sure a lot of these things are. I get wanting to share in the grief but at some point it's too much like people are hungry for others sadness. They dont all have to be page long obituaries.
