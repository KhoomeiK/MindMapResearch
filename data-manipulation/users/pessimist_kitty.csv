AskReddit,ffhollv,t1_ffhhb1v,1579945588.0,"Exactly. I'm fat and I don't subscribe to the HAES mentality at all. Most sensible people who are in the body positive movement just want fat people to be treated with respect like anyone else. Especially when the disrespect is coming from people in the medical field. It's not something that can be fixed overnight, so just treat people better."
