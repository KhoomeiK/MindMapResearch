If you want to help her make her understand that you are there to help.  People with depression find difficult to talk about their problems, after all, the least we want is to worry our loved ones or make people feel bad for us.  

The moment she opens her heart to you, listen to her and be understanding.  Its not that we like to make ourselves ""the victims"".

And maybe the most important thing, make sure that she wants to talk about it. Maybe she wants to fight for herself, maybe if you get involved that would make her feel guilty or unconfortable, in that case it is better to let her be and wait until she brings the topic to you. Don't force her.

Sorry if it is hard to understand, english isn't my native language."

Ofc, food"
