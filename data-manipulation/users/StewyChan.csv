socialskills,ffegj69,t3_et1d4f,1579847134.0,"Ok sorry for the long ass post but this is something I'm really passionate about. Also, I just power typed this out so apologies for any grammar errors. When I graduated from high school, I would be paralysed trying to talk to anyone. I mean, if I'm at a restaurant and needed to order, fail. When the checkout person at a supermarket said hello, fail. It was ridiculous, so I definitely get the pain.

In hindsight, I'm grateful that it was so bad I struggled to talk to anyone that I couldn't hide. It wasn't an option of just getting by, it was literally going to be a life ender because just a basic ""Hi, can I get a Big Mac meal, large"", was too much for me. I'd get to the front of the line and chicken out. Guess I'll go hungry for now...

Thinking back, it probably took me a good 5 years of focusing on it almost full time, which was so helpful, but really the basics were down pat within 6 months or maybe less. At least I was functional after 6 months! Eventually, I was lucky enough to craft a career as a national top 10 sales person, got a few promotions and ran a team of 100+ nationally as a sales manager. If you'd told me I'd be doing that 15 years prior, I'd have laughed in your face, if it wasn't for the fact that I would have somehow stuttered the laugh instead.

All of the above is to say that I realise now that it's completely possible to make the turnaround and actually become relatively decent at communication. I see people that struggle to speak now and my heart breaks because I know *almost exactly* what they are going through.

A few suggestions that helped me, and might help others:

* Cliche, but practice makes perfect. I remember doing the whole mirror thing, which is good but only gets you so far. But every opportunity, is an opportunity. Practising in the mirror was great for me to get thoughts out in one go. It's important I feel to get it out in one go, not do the ol' stop halfway, correct yourself and pick up from the last sentence or something. Whatever you're aiming to orate, if you stuff it up, start from the very beginning. Also, create a realistic mental environment. If your scenario requires you to walk, then actually walk. If it requires you to present something, then go through it. The more realistic, the better.
* There are whole service environments that allow us to practice, at little social cost. If you were like me, then you had to basically start with making an effort to order that burger well. Some days were better than others. Then it might graduate to asking how their day is. It's about pushing that comfort barrier little by little, and nailing the next level before moving on. Eventually, you can do things like talk to people at info booths and try to hold a conversation. Museums, galleries, city info. There are literally armies of people who's job it is to talk. I used it to practice, and actually learnt a thing or 2 in the process.
* I also enrolled in units that forced me to do group presentations, group work or solo presentations. That was sweaty palm bonanza, but there was lots of real pressure to make sure you perform. And the tutors were surprisingly lenient and helpful when they saw what a mess you were but you're still giving it your best.
* Finally, I amassed enough small wins to get a job in sales. That was always the goal and was the best thing ever. I started in retail and moved on to professional sales consulting. Every step of the way was full of discomfort and failure, but every time I looked back a year and saw how far I came just from taking action, it kept pushing me forward.

There's 1000 tips and tricks that even this long post doesn't have room for. I was mainly trying to point out that there's lots of ways to practice in environments that, realistically, don't count, and that it's suppose to feel like you're drowning a little when you start, but there is no other way.

At some point along the line, you start to realise that most people are too busy worrying about what they are going to say to really pay that much attention anyway on what you're saying, which in a weird way, is really empowering. But I think you have to go through the steps to really get to that realisation.

Now my friends think I'm really confident because I can pretty much talk to whoever I feel like. My oldest friends though, have a laugh with me about the transformation. We know that I was a completely different person, once upon a time.

I hope this helped in even a small way. It makes me shudder a bit to think what life may have been like if I hadn't gone through the change, and I really hope everyone can overcome that fear of speaking if they have it, so the world can see what they have to contribute.

Best of luck!"
IWantToLearn,ffeer8g,t3_et3388,1579845261.0,"Firstly, ask yourself why you want to win arguments? There's a chapter in the book How to Win Friends and Influence People that is called ""You can't win an argument"". It talks about the fact that both parties in arguments are losers because there is nothing gained from arguing.

Having your own opinion though, that's a different story. We all have an opinion, even you. Having no opinion on politics, for example, might mean that your opinion is that it's of no interest to you, right now. If you'd like to develop deeper insights though, then maybe start asking yourself the question why? *Why* do I not think having an opinion on politics?

Keep asking why until you can't ask anymore. This is the nature of first principles, and of personal philosophies. Asking yourself (and others, for that matter) the question why can shed a lot of light about our position on things.

Hope this helps!"
DeepThoughts,ffeebsw,t3_et0j9t,1579844836.0,"Deep is subjective; it's deep if you think it is.

It's interesting that there is pain on either side of the habits. Good habits typically have pain upfront (exercise, boredom etc) but will typically lead to gratification in 5 years if they are repeated.

Bad habits have instant gratification, but can lead to pain in 5 years.

We all have the choice to choose our pain, because it's really within every decision we make. It's just either now, or later. 

So the question I often ask myself is; ""which pain do I prefer?""."

Take anyone that blows up. One day they are getting x amount of attention. The next day (literally) they are getting 1000x attention. Interestingly, all their previous content starts getting attention, and likes. Same person.

socialskills,ff7o259,t3_erv67w,1579654177.0,"This is a tipping point. I genuinely think you can put a positive spin or negative spin on this, depending on *what you want for your future!* Because that realisation in itself is powerful.

Social interactions build, like a snowball. If that's the most meaningful interaction you've had in over 6 months, then *great*! It's the new baseline to build from. And there's nothing *wrong* with that.

Focusing on having more positive interactions, rather than the number you've had in the past, is the surefire way to build more in the future. And like anything we practice, they will become better and better. In this case, more and more meaningful. Taking that approach, you can end up having constant, meaningful interactions in as little as 2 years, with the thought that it will continuously get better from now until then.

Again, it all starts from deciphering information in a positive manner. To even identify that call as a meaningful social interaction, is leaps and bounds ahead of saying ""I never have any meaningful interactions"". Build from that!"

Just like anything else in life that you are skilful at, practice makes perfect. There's no cheat or hack. You can utilise tools like actively listening to the other party, making eye contact, smiling, reframing what the other party has said to make sure you understand before responding, taking your time to collect your thoughts before you respond etc, however practice is the only thing that keeps it together.

Take any opportunity to practice if you'd like to work on it. The beauty is, people are everywhere! If you really want to practice, you can.

Start with people that serve you at shops etc, move on to people at work (the dreaded small talk is a great way to practice) and work your way up to strangers. You can walk around your city all day approaching info booths if you want. Go to the gallery and talk to staff.

It's the sort of knowledge that sitting around thinking begets, and it's uncommon in this world of distraction. You've cracked the code on identifying happiness. Some people will die never getting to the answer. You're halfway there brother. A few thoughts:

* Focus on what is important. We've all virgins, until we aren't. Forget that rubbish. It's not unimportant, but won't change by focusing on it. It's also not *that* important. You want to build healthy relationships so just focus on ""how"" to do that, rather than the unnecessary noise.
* Stay positive. I know it's hard, but it's a mindset. We get to choose how we think, it's literally the difference between humans, and not humans. Went on *only* 5 dates last year? Someone else when on only 4. Live in the suburbs where there isn't much to do? Some people wake up with bullets flying around because they lost the birth lottery. How attracted are you to a negative person? That will be around about how attractive you are to someone else. Good news is, you can change that. Start by smiling like an idiot all day.
* Find a new therapist. It's great that you've taken action; if you don't find them helpful though, find one that is. It's no reflection on them, but chemistry is needed also in therapy. You may need to try 10. You'll feel it in the first session or 2 so no need to give them 4 months.
* Do shit that makes you meet people. Volunteer. That's a great way to spend time if you have plenty of time. Find something you care about and volunteer. Do you try starting convos at the gym? Gymmers are typically quite social and friendly. A colleague of mine told me there's a local walking group that she joined that's basically a social club for people that like to walk. WT..? There's heaps of things man, just find them, seriously.
* Want to go on 50 dates this year? Just do whatever you did to get 5 dates, 10 times more. Fo realz.

Your post kinda breaks my heart. Like you, I'd hate to see you waste your 40s. 30 is nothing man. It's young! Look toward the future and seize it. Just take a small action per day. If you get a chance, maybe the book ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" might be a good read for you.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to change yourself, that is a critical step in self development. You should want to do it to become the person *you* want to be though, not the person you *think* someone else wants you to be. 

The reality is that for every person that likes something about you, there is someone else that doesn't. Think about that. You can't please everyone, so start by pleasing yourself and you'll find that you attract people like you.

The real question is how do you change your environment to find more like minded people, people that will naturally be attracted to you and your thoughts? Forums like this are a great place to start, maybe look at volunteering, social sports etc.

Some things that have helped me is:

1. Morning routine. Whatever it is, if it's positive and mindful, it's a great way to start the day, and energising too.
2. Plan your day. Map out your day and make sure you dedicate a solid chunk of time to doing the most important thing (Gary Keller's book The 1 Thing is a great reading tool for this). It sounds simple but spending 15 min sorting out my day in the morning somehow makes the day so much more productive for me.
3. Small meals during the day to get me through. I gorge at dinner but keep it lean throughout the day; it seems to help with mental clarity.
4. Give yourself time on social and clocking out activities but limit them as per your schedule. I personally give myself 1 hour in the morning and 30 min at night on socials, but my feed is only positive constructive things. Plus a meme page (hey, they're funny!).
5. Phone blockout before 9am and after 9pm, except for productive uses eg getting my news and articles in the morning, and listening to podcasts at night.
6. Steer away from unnatural light at night. This was a game changer actually, because I heard about it but was always dubious. But hands down, my sleep improved immensely, and the cycle was way easier to achieve the next day.

It lies in the choices we make about what to think. I believe that there isn't such thing as human garbage, we're all valuable in our own way and have the capacity to change. Based off what I believe, you aren't human garbage; it simply doesn't exist.

Don't forget that 'society' is made up of smaller communities. There is nothing wrong with knowing yourself well enough that you don't want to dedicate your energy to an organisation that's overly political. Seek out an alternative. 

E.g. personally I have no problem with political environments, however made the decision recently that I would like an alternative better. When applying for jobs, I received offers, but ultimately turned them down and cold called a startup company that I knew I would want to work for and basically said ""I'll do anything, for anything"". I got the job (that didn't exist), will be getting paid 3x less than the offer I received but ultimately know that I will be happier. Not to make it about me, but just trying to provide an example.

I think you are way further down the path of progress than you currently realise. Self awareness and a real desire to change are already the hardest parts, and you've done them. It won't be easy and may be uncomfortable, but if you now segment and start taking action, I believe you'll look back in 3 years and be blown away by your results, as well as your overall contentment.

The irony is that if we ever got there, we would not be fulfilled. Fulfilment comes from the journey, rather than the destination. 

We all have a version of who we want to be so there's no magic pill. The clearer a picture you have though (and be true to yourself, e.g. why do you want to be the person that makes people laugh? Not everyone can do it; it doesn't make them any less valuable though), the more content you are as you take steps towards becoming that person.

Break it down into small, achievable steps and just take action. Sometimes we falter but that's ok. Just take action.

&#x200B;

1. Don't need gym. As someone that's been active and gymming his whole life and always conscious of diet (I diet after I put on 2kg because that just works well for me), I can hand on heart say that gym is just for people that love it, or want to build lot's of muscle. Ramp up exercise (if you do nothing, start walking, if you walk now, start jogging etc) and focus on diet. You can start by just cutting lunch in half, nothing drastic. Then cut breakfast in half too. Keep dinner the same. Cut sugar if you can. Go from there.
2. Can't help here, sorry, but maybe an alternative is to volunteer somewhere local for a cause you believe in. Not therapy but I'm sure you'll meet lots of great people; some of them may really be able to provide perspective as well.
3. This is probably a bias because I live here but Oz is awesome. People are awesome, culture is awesome, work is awesome, economy is awesome, and it's safe as feck.
4. We tend to focus on building relationships with people in proximity because we feel that is the only option, without sometimes remembering that there are 8 billion people on the planet. If you're looking for positive people, maybe identify people around you that you know that don't complain, and make a real effort to go hang around them more. Typically, people that don't complain like to be surrounded by others that don't complain. So if you don't complain, they probably won't reject you. :)
5. For sure negativity is a powerful force so best stay away. I think number 4 helps the most. Also, what we think when we are alone helps too. Find podcasts, FB groups, thought leaders to follow on social etc and your world will change. Hide posts from negative people and surround yourself in the right environment. Personally, I spend LITERALLY every evening of the week either playing a social sport, catching up with good, positive friends or walking for 2-3 hours in my neighbourhood listening to podcasts. And when I feel a bit down from time to time, I remember that there are over 7 billion people in the world that wish they had my problems. Literally would be so incredibly grateful to swap places.

Definitely don't quit if you like your job in every other way. It's just a misunderstanding. Like all misunderstandings, the good news is you can do something about it.

If you can find the courage to just talk to 1 person that was in that group about it (I know it'll be hard but it'll be totally worth it), they can really help spread the message for you.

Ask if you can have 5 min for a chat. Expect that they may be standoffish, it's normal. Go through everything that you posted. You could probably even say ""I'm not sure how to say it out loud so I wrote it down"" and show them this post.

Their heart will melt. We're all human, sometimes it just takes a bit of effort to help others realise this.

Best of luck."
socialskills,feluv8u,t3_eptht5,1579231513.0,"It's always difficult when you feel foolish about something but remember, the world favours those who try, not those who hide. Truth is, it only looks dumb to you. Most other people are too focused on not looking dumb to notice.

What we do and the environment we are in builds the people in our lives. Realistically, the people that run away from you because they think you look dumb, are exactly the type of people you want to run away. Genuinely happy people that can be a positive influence will never think you look dumb. They would probably look up to you  as they respect you trying something that you can't do.

Especially the gym. There's a myth that gym junkies are aggressive or mean. Of course there are some, but I've made the best friends at the gym because everyone is actually really focused, respects dedication and are just positive people. You'll find that the more you look ""dumb"" trying a piece of equipment, the more people will come to help and support you.

Go be you, and the masses will come."

Think about people taking advantage of your niceness. Do you think emotionally stable people that are happy would do that? They would likely be attracted to you. Being nice eventually attracts happier people in your life, and to me, that's priceless.

Have you heard of Adam Grant? He wrote a great book called Give and Take that might be useful. It literally breaks down that nice guys don't always lose, they just lose 50% of the time. The other 50%, they win, big time.

Don't stop being nice just because the people within the closest proximity to you can't appreciate it. The world is a big place. Find one person that does appreciate it, and more will follow."

Be yourself, focus on getting the story out, teas and all. Not on trying to contain tears. It's powerful to tell your story and people want to listen; that's all that matters. If tears are a part of that, so be it."

It's difficult to make sense of it all sometimes however in this world, I really think there's a lot of positivity and am optimistic. 

Remember, being lonely is only being surrounded by people that aren't the best fit for you. But the world has almost 8B people in it. You won't be lonely long if you just find people that want to be around you (and they definitely exist, it's just statistics).

Love that your name is CardioPen too haha, very clever."

If you put in your best effort with something regardless of  result, you'll never disappoint anyone as the only reason anyone can achieve anything worthy is because they failed 100 times before, and likely had someone to help them up. 

And I doubt they really are the opposite of you, it may just be a current perception.  I feel that soon, you'll be inspiring many others. For example, you have the most upvotes on this post...

I reckon there are people without arms that can do a better breaststroke than me (the swimming stroke, not the intimate action). I'm still happy as feck.

By this definition, we are all mediocre. Remember that there is only 1 person in the world that's the best in anything. The rest of us are mediocre, if we are comparing.

The reality is, if we are all mediocre, then we are also all special! Don't suppress your feeling of pride because someone is better at something than you are. You are much more capable at something else than they are. So should you both be proud, or both be depressed?

You're 17. Go do you. Travel, work, study, laugh, break hearts, have your heart broken. Be better than you were yesterday. Form good relationships that are supportive of you, and also be supportive of them.

Even if you're the 7.5 billionth worst at something, you can still be the happiest person in the world. Does your breaststroke matter at this point?"
socialskills,feirfzk,t1_fehgpgi,1579145332.0,"It's perfectly normal to care; in many cases it's probably stimulating to care. It's hard, but rather than pretending we don't care (we will never fool ourselves after all), we can just find the right type of people to care about. 

Caring about the opinion of someone that isn't getting the outcome that you aspire to will lead to angst. 

Caring about the opinion of someone that is living the way we'd like to live, is motivational and inspiring. You'll likely find that their feedback is completely constructive as well. It's powerful stuff!"
socialskills,feiqd87,t3_ep5sor,1579144587.0,"Nice quote. A great rule of thumb is people think as much about us, as we do about them.

Simultaneously, it's difficult to not care about what people think about us; evolution has inbuilt it into us over 200k years after all. 

Maybe it's more pertinent to think ""For everyone that disagrees, there is someone else that agrees"". Rather than trying to please those that are simply close to us via proximity, why not just be ourselves and let people that resonate come to us?

For those that drop off as acquaintances, then so be it. After all, it's much easier to be dropped than *to* drop!"
