It's tough to compare records between teams from different divisions though, because the schedules can vary significantly. You play mostly the same teams as the other teams in your division, while teams in the other divisions play a completely different schedule. A subpar record could be a sign of a weaker team, or a sign of a more difficult record, or both. Likewise, a good record could be a sign of a strong team, or a sign of an easy schedule, or both. A 12-4 team in one division might not necessarily be better than a 9-7 team in another division. Only against teams in the same division can you say, based on record, which was necessarily the better team.

To fix this, you could balance out the schedule, so that everyone plays everyone else (in the conference, at least), but you would either need to expand the season, or eliminate almost all non conference games, then you could take the six best records in the conference for the playoffs. You could still have the same issue across conferences though, where teams from one conference miss out with better records than teams from the other conference who make it.

AskReddit,fcvdsua,t1_fcu4q6l,1578000000.0,"> Itâ€™s all black screens of code, polygons, and being criticized for your work.

This wasn't the problem for me. I wanted to work on games when I was younger, but didn't go that route. Still ended up writing software, just not games. It was this...

> Whatâ€™s worse, if you make games you probably never have the time to play them anymore. The gaming industry is notorious for implementing 60-80 hour work weeks. 

...and this...

> EVEN WORSE depending on what company you work for, you may never have stable work. You finish a project and then the company tells you â€œwe donâ€™t have another project for your particular skill set.â€ Then you gotta look for more work. 

...that make me glad I didn't end up working as a game developer. I write software that's boring to use during the day, and play with software that's fun to use when I get home at night. I think I am probably better off for that!"

Showerthoughts,fcosewv,t1_fcodczp,1577840287.0,"> The challenge that argument #1 faces is that it seems to overlook the skewed representation of the population in competitive chess.

How is that overlooking the skewed representation? The skewed representation is a part of the argument itself.

>So the skewing of competitive chess players towards men is already a sign (but not conclusive proof) that men are -- at least for now -- better in general at chess than women are

This is making assumptions that haven't been warranted about the reasons fewer women play. Like for example...

>fewer of the men having quit the game out of not being good enough at it.

assuming an equal number of men and women pick up the game in the first place."
Showerthoughts,fcntjw4,t1_fcnrz1d,1577818137.0,">Someone else had posted that the first female â€œgrandmasterâ€ was 75 spots down the list of a ranked system.  I think that is surprising, if true.  No matter how many women play competitive chess, if they were if any equal footing with men , you would expect them to be represented much higher up on a scaled ranking system. 

What is the male to female ratio of competitive chess players? It may or may not be that surprising a number."
secretsanta,fcnrtuj,t1_fcmltdb,1577817223.0,"> I got a gift after being successfully rematched last year (my original Santa pulled my information then didnâ€™t bother) 

Yeah same. Still sucks having to wait longer. Also, can still be upset over those who take advantage of the system to get a nice gift, without giving one themselves, and on behalf of the rematchers who pick up their slack. I know they volunteer to do it, but it still seems unfair that it even needs to be a thing.

>but that was only after I hit the â€˜report no giftâ€™ option,  which I canâ€™t seem to do this time, perhaps because my gift is marked as shipped?

I think it's disabled until a certain date, so things have time to move through the mail probably."
Showerthoughts,fcnqbbs,t1_fcnogge,1577816421.0,"Not really relevant to the point the other user was making. Sure, any individual's ranking is independent of how many other players are from one or another group. When way there's more of one group though, it's likely that more members of that group will occupy the rankings at the top. There's way more men than women in not just the top rankings, but the middle and lower rankings too. There's simply more men than women across the whole spectrum of rankings, period."
secretsanta,fclq2sb,t3_ehp42m,1577753714.0,"Similar boat. Got notification of shipment well before the deadline, and started to get excited, then nothing. Tracking number at least appears to be a valid, but it never updated beyond ' The shipment information has been received by Carrier'. Haven't given up yet, but starting to get worried. Would be my 2nd year in a row without a gift from my original match."
gamecollecting,fc9pqah,t1_fc4pqg5,1577556329.0,"Same. I know the system has got a lot of love in the past few years, but there honestly hasn't been much on it outside the Nintendo IPs that have really appealed to me. At least those Nintendo IPs are more than enough to carry the console imo, so I don't regret buying it"
