Gothenburg,ffm7wnu,t3_eu79dz,1580050095.0,"Hi! Happy you're considering Gothenburg, as it is a beautiful city to explore with lots of historical locations to visit, as well as heaps of nice restaurants and pubs worth trying out. In terms of living/housing, I would recommend staying away from Högsbo, Angered, Hjällbo, Biskopsgården and Hisingen, as they are a bit of rough areas with tendensies of attracting violence and crime. I would rather recommend Mölndal (Kvarnbyn with surroundings) and maybe the inner parts of Gothenburg itself. If you're planning on renting, I would recommend that you contact private landlords as they are commonly easier to get quicker access from to any type of housing with (check out blocket.se). Also, if buying, I would recommend Jonsered or Kungsbacka, as they are pretty ok places to live in terms of commuting to Gothenburg via both bus and train, and there should be some alternatives in terms of housing. If you want to make new friends, there are a tonne of different communities in Gothenburg based on several different interests. I would suggest you make a post on this subreddit based on whatever hobbies or activites you and your SO are interested in, and maybe ask for specific groups you can get in contact with. As you said, Swedes can be a real challenge to get close too, but Gothenburg have quite a large community of international students and workers, so we are all in favour of meeting new interesting people. Best of luck to you and your SO!"

Gothenburg,ff8es31,t3_es2gvl,1579675392.0,"I'm a bit sad that no one from your current location have informed you about the housing situation in Gothenburg (or Sweden in general for that matter for the bigger cities). You'll have a tough time finding anything at all if you're going to be even the slightest picky about where you want to live. Finding an apartment for an afforable monthly rent in the inner city is basically impossible. If you're going for a private land lord in order to rent in the inner city, you're going to have to sacrifice both your arms and legs. And if you're trying to find a student apartment, then get in line, because there's quite a shortage of those. If you're willing to live in the outskirts of the city, you might have a small chance to find something, but as I mentioned, the housing/living situation sucks. I would recommend you get in contact with your University directely, and explain your situation. Since you're going to study your PhD, you might get some help from your facualty, seeing how they want you here for the position. I wish you all the best, and luck with finding somewhere to live, and even more, best of luck with your PhD!"

The first one is finding a schampo+conditioner that helps with hair growth. There are some you should be able to buy in your local pharmacy that are actually helpful (important to know also, which you probably have heard a million times by now, is not to wash your hair more than maybe 1-2 times a week). Also; *Rogaine*. I know it's targeted towards men only, but I've used it, and several other women as well, and it does work. The only con with it is that the result will take a while to be seen (about 3-6 months) and you have to use it every day, and you can't stop using it even after seeing results. So it's a oife treatment, just as with levo. But it does work. Also, there are some prescription-free meds you can buy at your local pharmacy specifically to help with hair loss, and re-growth. My best advice though is to talk to your GP and explain your problems. If she/he does not listen; then talk to another one. You *should* get the help you need. You deserve not to feel bad about yourself. Please don't give up. Best of wishes to you!"
