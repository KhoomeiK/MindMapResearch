He is purely in it because its what he believes in. Find a pastor like that."

My answer is that I only know one thing about Heaven: God is there. I also only know one thing about hell: God isn’t there. If you don’t want to see Him, you won’t. Forever.

You could say that everything is God’s fault. Every decision you make is ultimately His fault because He made you. But there comes a point when we have to accept some responsibility for our own decisions. And the decision that most if humanity has made, consciously through the generations, is to turn their back on God. Everyone knew of Him at some point in history. We made the decision to go our own way.

Thats what I think hell is. Eternity of going our own way without God in the picture. Some would say that thats a copout because hell doesn’t sound quite as bad with that definition. I could not disagree stronger."

There isn’t necessarily proof for these claims, but there is plenty of evidence if you look for it.

I’ve looked for it. By putting the teachings of the Bible into practice, I have found plenty of evidence."
