dogs,fgx6s0c,t1_fgx5wpe,1581169705.0,"Yeah, you could be right. I just think it's really rude to be so inconsiderate. Like I said, I'd get it if OP's dogs were the only issue (I still think it'd be rude to fuck with them like this, though at least he'd have plausible deniability and could say his own dogs behave, so that's why he expect others in his house to behave, but that is definitely *not* the case), but he's taking it too far, imo. OP also said in another comment that he listens to her husband and will agree with him if the husband brings up these issues, but argues with her all day if she mentions them, so I feel there's something deeper there, but...meh.

At the very least, she said they're leaving soon, so hopefully things get better for everyone involved."
dogs,fgx4q7x,t1_fgv3fxo,1581169056.0,"This would make sense if it was *only* OP's dog who is having issues, but the roommate's dog is doing the same stuff...so this also benefits him, when OP is making these workarounds to fix (or at the very least, make them easier to handle until there's a better way) issues that his dog is contributing to. The post says right there that he expects all dogs to behave, but his own dog isn't, so he complains about that, too. His dog had several issues before OP moved in (running through multiple glass windows, jumping the fence until OP's husband fixed it, etc.), so it's not like OP and her husband are the ones who caused all these problems. Plus, he's literally going into OP's space and opening the inside side door where she's keeping *her* dogs out of the way, then lets them back outside so they're all screaming and hollering at the fence with the neighbors' dogs.

How can they be trained if the roommate is constantly setting all the dogs -- including his own -- up for failure all the time, then wants to complain about it?"
dogs,fgx33wh,t3_f0law8,1581168523.0,"Haha I love this post, because it's reminded me a lot of myself! I cannot begin to tell you how many dogs have been foster failed between my parents, then later my boyfriend and I! Growing up, I lived on a large acre farm (though all our dogs were indoor), so my mum and dad were always fostering, because we also lived out in the country, and the rescues needed it. That's basically how we ended up with 12 dogs at one point ;p Several times, my parents helped the rescues in a bind and agreed to take in a nursing mum and her litter, so us kids got to help with the puppies. It was a blast to have so many dogs at a time. It was never really a spoken thing when a certain dog came into our lives, and we just knew we had to keep them. Every dog that was adopted out eventually found a place in our hearts, so it was always really tough to let them go, but then there would be one or two dogs (bonded pairs were our weakness, because we couldn't stand the thought of separating them) that needed to find a home for a while before being placed with another family, and my parents would basically call the rescue and be like, ""Nope. We're keeping our latest foster(s). Call us when you need another temporary home."" And then that would be that. The house was never quiet and I loved it. 

As soon as I met my boyfriend, I made it *very* clear that I would always have dogs, and that I wanted to follow my parents' footsteps and also foster. Now that I live with him, we've foster failed 2 dogs, and have 5 right now. One foster passed away due to old age (rip, Marley) a couple years ago...that was especially tough, because it was around the time we had to put down my service dog, but then we got another foster, who helped heal that hole a little. We didn't keep her, and she found an amazing home with another couple, but she made it a bit easier to breathe after so much heartache. Now we're fostering another, a puppy this time (who, by the way, looks a suspiciously high amount like my service dog we put down...he's like my SD in puppy form, so my boyfriend and I have to keep stopping ourselves from calling him by my old dog's name. We probably aren't going to foster fail this one; we don't want to put those expectations on him), and I couldn't be happier. It's funny, because my boyfriend and I don't have my parents' intuition about this sort of thing. We're both usually caught by surprise when we suddenly look at each other, then one of us says, ""We need to keep this one,"" unlike my parents, who always seemed to just *know.*

Anyway, rambles aside...foster failing can be great, and I've never regretted it! I really hope you can several years with your new pup <3"
