I've often wondered if a subreddit where guys post pictures and get compliments would do any good. Like the opposite of /r/RoastMe. A lot of women don't compliment men because we don't want them to think we're trying to get into their pants, but I'd be happy to do it through the safety of the internet."
AskReddit,ffgzfcm,t1_ffgv1b3,1579919022.0,Perhaps men complimenting one another more would help with this? I think part of the problem is that compliments to or from men are interpreted as sexual. Maybe if men started regularly complimenting one another it would break that assumption.
AskReddit,ffgz6ne,t1_ffgx549,1579918842.0,"It does seem like something that won't really happen if that's how it shakes out, though. Men want those compliments because they want to feel like women are attracted to them and women aren't giving those compliments to men, for the most part, because they don't want to make men think they're interested in them. Though perhaps women could compliment men who they're in relationships with more."

AskReddit,fechner,t1_fecgm67,1578974144.0,"That's true, but you don't necessarily know what boundaries someone has. It raises the question of which things you're obligated to disclose to all people and why. There are things like sexual history, sexuality, political beliefs, etc that might impact whether someone would want to have sex with you or not that most people wouldn't think anyone is obligated to disclose."

politics,fec85fw,t1_febjsvy,1578968317.0,"It's the opposite. Chances are there are many things he's done that he was never caught for, and then in these few cases he was caught the punishment was incredibly light. He's learnt that he can get away with it. He won't stop."
politics,fec77k4,t1_febo4zb,1578967836.0,It's sad to me how often when we catch people doing horrific things it turns out they had a criminal history full of serious crimes they got light or no punishments for. Especially when it comes to sex crimes. Add to that how often people don't get caught at all for these sorts of things and you can see why they thought it was worth the risk to escalate.

Steam,fe5phwf,t1_fe5obvr,1578872589.0,"But we all know that in reality people will purchase a crate that isn't worth the money just so that they can get access to one that might be. If that wasn't the case, they'd let you access a different one without first buying the first one they showed you. Obviously they won't ever do that, because the system breaks down if people can choose to only buy good crates without restriction."
Steam,fe5nzox,t1_fe5ly9v,1578871994.0,The laws could change to make that illegal as well. I mean it doesn't really change anything for people who buy large numbers of crates. They're just gambling on the next one being a good one.

If it really is that much more common there and there are statistics to confirm it, it's probably not racist. 

If they have a greater problem than other places, but it's still only among a small minority of their population, then it's still racist. Then it would be like saying the same things about men because they have a statistically greater chance of viewing child porn than women, even though the vast majority of them don't."
