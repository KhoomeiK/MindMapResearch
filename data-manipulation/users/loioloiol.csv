CryptoCurrency,ffp9nic,t3_eu8egx,1580089624.0,what about cardless business stores? i hope those don’t get banned otherwise i’ll have to start paying taxes :(
teslamotors,ffp95z6,t1_ffongly,1580089295.0,what’s NOT ridiculous about that statement?
prius,ffp8swn,t1_ffnvt3d,1580089048.0,yea but telling people to put the car in neutral when they’re trying to learn to pulse and glide probably isn’t the way. now they would think they have to keep putting the car in neutral ever 15 seconds
prius,ffp8pe4,t1_ffnvt3d,1580088985.0,that’s a very specific set of conditions. definitely not a pulse and glide. more like cruising on neutral
prius,ffnhb40,t1_ffnf3d4,1580065971.0,lmao flip to neutral?? or how about lightly tap the gas like everyone else does?

LoveDeathAndRobots,ffbgl0d,t1_ffaxyut,1579764360.0,greta taking care of the lost souls that wander beyond the aquila rift is a major theme of the story. if all the sudden she was evil that would be the equivalent of like the harry potter movie changing the story and turning voldemort into a good guy in the end.

LoveDeathAndRobots,ffaw7ii,t3_esa2tx,1579745917.0,"So the short story says that the other crew members spray painted their pods causing the oxygen sensor to malfunction or leak or something, which was fine in short travels but was deadly in long slumber and that’s how everyone died except for thom. if you think the animated short follows after the book (which i think it does very closely) then yeah suzy is dead."
