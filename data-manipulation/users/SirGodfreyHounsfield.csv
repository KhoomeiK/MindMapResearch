nihilism,fdgybxe,t1_fdgw90z,1578411314.0,"And it is important to know that illnesses (mental, physical), certain mindsets etc. destroy your freedom. Freedom is not something that everyone has to the same extent. If you don't care about being free, you won't make any efforts to become free. That's the reason why so many people are just miserable slaves of society or religion.

This is nihilism. Nihilists know that their life has no purpose. So they can do whatever they want whithout thinking about restrictions made by society.

And the murder=jail=not free argument is also bullshit because this has nothing to do with freedom but with morality. OF COURSE you can kill anybody for no reason!! But why the frick would you do that unless you are an immoral piece of garbage. Someone who wants to be free would not think about taking other people's freedom away."
nihilism,fdgxcou,t1_fdgw90z,1578410647.0,"Because this is how physics work. Physics is not a living thing than can decide how levitation works. Freedom is a concept that only works with living animals that have consciousness (sry for my bad english). That’s just comparing apples and oranges because what you are talking about has nothing to do with human beings.

What are you talking about flying? You cannot fly because you are not a bird. Hello, this is real life speaking! Humens cannot fly, and not being able to fly has nothing to do with freedom because humans are not meant to be able to fly (again, sorry for my bad english lol).

You are not understanding the concept of freedom for example because you wrote that we are not free from cultural conditioning which is just wrong!! Of course you are. If you choose to follow that cultural shit of your country even though your culture pisses you off, you are just stupid. 

Of course if you define freedom as being able to fly or being able to change your skin colour to green there is no freedom because that’s just made up bullshit."
nihilism,fdgvwok,t1_fdgsxxj,1578409643.0,"this line of argumentation is so stupid lol

&#x200B;

why would you ever choose to be free from gravity? that’s like saying ""i didnt make the choice to have eyes, so freedom is a concept of bullshit"""
nihilism,fdgsxaf,t1_fdgr06q,1578407498.0,exactly. freedom is a choice and not a gift.
dankmemes,fdgpn9p,t1_fdgpc3n,1578404985.0,"That’s okay, night mode is something else, but there are people who brag about their phone’s awesome display resolution and processing capabilities.

I know a guy who imported a phone from korea because of the better processor (or something) built in, paying like a hundred euros extra, only to throttle it even when he plays games on his phone and lowering the resolution to 1080p because the power consumption is too high. how stupid is this?

I am very sorry for my bad english."
