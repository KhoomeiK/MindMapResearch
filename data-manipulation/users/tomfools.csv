OpenDogTraining,fh4plvo,t3_f1ebfd,1581280959.0,"I had a REALLY bad experience with my Garmin (I don't remember the exact model and I believe its since been discontinued).

It was decent for awhile where the working levels for my dogs could barely felt, and then one day those same levels were genuinely painful...but it was inconsistent. Sometimes would be exactly the level of stim I expected and the next it would be 1000xs higher. 


I really love my dogtra that I got to replace it."
k9sports,fh4jhi3,t1_fh4e0xw,1581279308.0,"Thats really not how your questions came off, at all. Sorry to have misunderstood. 

I think a lot of the time with R+ only, you leave the dog guessing to try and figure out what you want. When you're shaping (which I love!!) It makes a lot of sense, or just teaching a new behavior in general. But it's a pretty big ask to try and improve latency by getting your dog to guess--you've named a command, they performed the command, and they didn't get rewarded, but they don't know why. With a dog that knows how to shape, instead of just speeding up the behavior, they might try to offer something else, which is exactly what I don't want. I increase speed when the dog is performing the behavior the way I want, every time, unlured. 


When i add the ecollar, i start luring again, briefly, to show them what i want as far as how to speed up the behavior/how to turn off the stim in this situation. 

I teach my dogs how to turn off the ecollar before ever adding it to obedience, generally a pressure on/pressure off exercise with sending them to their bed. So it's a quick study when I add it to something else.

An ecollar (or a prong, or a slip lead, etc) adds clarity to your communication with the dog. I prefer it over having them confused and offering behaviors or adding other bad habits to a command that I already like except for the speed."

k9sports,fh3uo88,t1_fh3gvx5,1581272436.0,"I didn't use it at all in this video. But in general I use it to speed up behaviors he already knows or enforce other behaviors he knows--like a sit or down stay. He knows the way to turn off a stim is by completing the behavior I'm asking, and so a low level stim when asking for a down for example, adds in urgency and improves latency. 

In general, I have an ecollar on him if he's off leash to assist with recall as well."

OpenDogTraining,fh24c32,t1_fh24acu,1581234603.0,Exactly this--i know a lot of people (myself included!!) Think we are supervising better than we actually are. We don't realize the signs we were missing until we tether the puppy to ourselves..
OpenDogTraining,fh244av,t3_f14u6o,1581234323.0,"The best thing you can do with housebreaking is remember that any accidents are your fault--it is absolutely not fair to blame the puppy. Blaming blaming dog tends to result in unfair corrections and misplaced frustration. The puppy can be looking you dead in the eyes and peeing after having just come inside, and it's still not the dogs fault. Your puppy genuinely does not understand what is it's your job to teach it.

Have you taught your dog a method of indicating it needs to go out? We use a potty bell screwed into the wall.

How much freedom does your dog have? If you're having accidents still, your dog should be supervised 100% of the time it's not crated (are you crate training? It is an essential and effective tool for housebreaking). If you think your dog is supervised when loose in the house but it is still having accidents, you're not supervising well enough. Block off areas of the house with baby gates to limit the places your dog can run off to. Leash your dog to you so you are forced to monitor and watch for signs of needing to go. I can almost guarantee your dog is signaling, you just are missing it.

Since you are having such a hard time, you need to reduce your expectations and start from square 1. Outside for potty every 20 minutes while awake, in addition:  before kenneling, after kenneling, right after meals, right after drinking water, right as soon as there is a lull in playtime, right after a nap, and anytime there is a change in activity.

Reward every time your dog signals to go out (scratching/whining/barking at the door, ringing bells, etc) and had a successful potty trip. If you catch your dog mid-elimination, interrupt it and rush the dog outside--reward for every potty outside. 

Above all, be patient. Potty training takes time, and regression as your dog goes through adolescence is common.


ETA: it sounds like your Mal was two months older when you got it than when you got your husky--Mal came home at 4 months old, puppy at 8 weeks. That is absolutely not a fair comparison--a fair comparison would be your puppy being fully potty trained in another month! Its super common for dogs to not be potty trained completely until 6-8 months old."

But I really love the picture of it--if he would slam into me on a recall in an IGP trial or like in this video in rally I would HAPPILY take that point deduction. But I'd be really shocked if he actually came up that close in a trial.

I think you should do whatever picture you want--if its technically perfect/not faulty or something more like I have going on with my dog, do what makes you happy and what you want.

dogs,fgqnt74,t1_fgqnlv5,1581027780.0,"Yup. My 2 year old, 70lbs, lab had TPLO done 9/30/19, and he started agility training in January. Really can't go wrong with it so long as you give them a chance to heal properly."
dogs,fgqmfql,t3_ezwzqp,1581027002.0,"A non surgery treatment plan is going to depend heavily on your dogs level of activity and size...rehab based only works some of the time in inactive dogs under 20-30lbs. Lateral suture works some of the time in inactive dogs between 30-50lbs. TPLO, once healed, wont fail and your dog can return to pre-injury quality of life. 


You can always play the wait and see game, but your dog is in pain, and quality of life will be limited. It's also likely that your dogs other CCL will go out as well. If they don't have a good leg to limp on, now you're looking at euthanasia.

Your dog is 2. If she's more than a little active (zoomies and hard play indicate she is) and more than 20lbs, you really should just start planning for surgery."
puppy101,fgn6ttr,t3_ezfe4n,1580938801.0,"Several things:

You sound like you are out of your element and you really should hire a trainer to help you get Max under control. Do not let him off leash in anywhere that is not completely enclosed. Even then, with this possible aggression or inappropriate play behavior he should not be off leash. When you let him off leash you are reinforcing the undesired behavior. Hire a trainer. And actually do the homework they give you.

You need to put the work in to teach your dog how to walk on a leash, have reliable recall, play appropriately with other dogs, and otherwise just have good manners. Every time Max gets to exercise these bad behaviors, he is going to reinforce those habits and your quest to get a well mannered dog is going to be that much harder. 

Second, unless you are planning to get Max titled in either confirmation or hunt tests/field trials, preferably both, and spend the thousands of dollars on xrays, genetics testing, and all of the other recommended health testing for labradors, you should not breed your dog. 99% of pets should not be bred. End of. To do so would be very irresponsible and unethical."
k9sports,fggq5q9,t3_ey6uug,1580767114.0,"Jake started his private agility lessons this week, and he loves it just as much as I thought he would! Super excited to be laying that foundation. I don't have much in the way of competition goals with him, just trying to have fun.

He's also been working in public lately, we are working towards his CGC and as a part of that managing his anxiety. He's a lot better when its just me working him in public, but is struggling with whining and other anxious behaviors when we are working in a group (with human friends of mine and doggie friends of his). Its really good practice honestly because his anxiety stems from being over socialized...he's anxious because he wants to say hi and greet everyone and everything but isn't allowed to. 

At our CGC class this week we played engagement games, and jake really was showing off for me! The trainer let her dogs loose, the other students in class were available to distract, trainer was throwing food on the floor and being obnoxious in playing with her dogs. Jake was consistently offering me really great engagement and happy to work for me with all the distractions. I'm super proud of him. 

Finn....Finn gave me a run for my money this week. Started off on monday with an emergency vet visit, thought he may have had an obstruction. He ended up being fine, but took a few days to get back to normal. This puppy is crazy when working for just his kibble so it was super distressing to have him not have any appetite or want to engage. He also started eating my car when he is in it during the day unsupervised on Saturdays (ub training days) or when waiting his turn when we are working in public. Car is too small to fit a crate, can't usually crate him wherever we are at, not in the cards to buy another vehicle right now. Ordered a barrier from Amazon so hopefully that will do the trick. This week we were working on change of positions using german commands. He had them while on the training table but as soon as I moved him to the floor they were gone. He finally started putting it together this weekend. Also working on straightening out our fronts and our hold. Both of those are coming along really nicely. Super excited for this pup. We have our first rally trial on the 22nd! My goal is to put a rally novice on him by his first birthday in April."
puppy101,fggojyw,t3_eyb11s,1580766164.0,"Give it some time...and I would get a second opinion on the timeline for neuter as well. 

My lab puppy had a retained testicle as of his last puppy visit at about the same age. Vet said if it didnt drop, he would need to be neutered, but we could wait until around 12-18months old so he got the benefits of being unaltered while still growing.

His poops are better and what he does eat he is keeping down no problem. He was a little better this morning, so I think he's on the mend. Thankfully he's insured and we have a sizable care credit amount available so if anything worse is wrong we don't have to worry about paying for it.

And he is getting all the cuddles! Being sick means he's actually got some chill so he gets to sleep in the big bed and hang out in the couch more than normal."
dogs,ffx8afr,t3_evncwa,1580319832.0,"My puppy Finn has not been feeling well. He's usually super fun and happy and food motivated--everything you'd expect from a working lab puppy. On Monday he puked up about 4"" of bully stick, had diarrhea, and then couldn't keep food down. Vet didnt see further obstruction on the radiographs, and no real cause for concern, just kind of a wait and see type deal.

This puppy LOVES to work, even just for his kibble, and he has ate very little since monday and is generally lethargic (for him, not like laying in his kennel and won't move lethargic) and not feeling like himself. I'm worried about him. Will probably take a fecal to the vet to make sure he doesn't have a parasite or something in addition, but regardless it's super distressing to see my happy crazy puppy so mellow and miserable."

I know hands down he can do the obedience portion, we will see how he takes to tracking once the snow melts. And we are just barely introducing protection and encouraging his prey drive. 

Neither of those clubs it the one I'm working with lol.

 The club I am in is super welcoming and are the ones that persuaded me to give it a go with Finn. He's actually got pretty decent prey drive but if he never gets to compete in the protection aspect i won't be disappointed.

OpenDogTraining,ffjtbpy,t1_ffj1wq3,1580006380.0,"Yes! I am 100% just a hobby trainer.  I work an 8-5 and then just love my dogs the rest of the time. This puppy was super stubborn and willful when we brought him home so I actually signed up for a puppy class with him (I didnt with my other dog). The trainer was great abd got me hooked so now I'm super into training for dog sports and will get Finn in competitions this year.

I think there are a lot of factors at play--breed and genetics for sure. Finn came from a pretty good breeder with proven/titled hunting dogs so he's got the genetic component of having drive and being biddable. Another aspect of it is training methods--finn has been trained with primarily +R and limited corrections (he's wearing an ecollar in this video, he used to work on a prong, etc). Being super heavy handed can lead to dogs who don't like to work, they'll have good obedience, but you don't get the clearly happy behavior out of them that you see with Finn. It's important to me that training is fun for my dog and me both. Corrections are a part of that, but so is reinforcing good behavior. 

As far as treats...finn is working for his kibble in this video.


 He works for all of his meals--he hasn't been fed out of a bowl since the first week he came home. He does get fed with a puzzle feeder occasionally (when I'm too sick to train), but otherwise he has to work for his kibble through a training session.

 The hand feeding is the single best advice I've gotten when it comes to dog training. 

It forces you to train twice a day, it teaches your dog a work ethic, it develops a relationship with your dog, encourages engagement, etc. And when you think about it--hand feeding means Finn has trained twice a day, every day, for the last 7 months. That dedication and willingness to work on my part is why he's such a focused puppy.

My other dog was 2 when we brought the puppy home and when I started hand feeding the puppy, I started doing the same with the 2 year old...so don't worry so much about the age of your dog! Jake didnt eat for a couple days but then he started figuring it out. You start slow, first just getting them to even eat out if your hand. Then require eye contact, then move onto command he knows, and then eventually you can use kibble to train new behaviors. Jake went from having pretty minimal food drive to working for his kibble with the same enthusiasm he works for hot dogs with.

Then lure it from the heel position. Then lose the lure. He pivots really nicely now lol I've got a few videos in my post history. I also taught my puppy to target his back paws to the bowl.


For backup: I started with a rubbermaid tote lid on the ground in a corner so the dog would be backing next to a wall. For my puppy I also needed to use a playpen to form a chute, but my older dog didn't require it. I started them both in front of me, maybe six inches away from the lid. And from then it was just typical shaping--first even shifting his weight backwards got marked and rewarded, then I required a paw to move/touch the lid. Then two paws, then I'd take a step back and repeat until I could have him backing down a hallway without the lid to target. Once I had him backing in the hallway I would randomly reward--sometimes one step, sometimes six, sometimes the whole hallway so he couldn't anticipate when he was done which allows me to get the distance out of him."

Show up, without your dog, to a training day to observe. See if you like how they handle their dogs. Often there will be a mix of training styles in the group. In my club there's one old dude that is old guard of bird dog training so his methods are pretty harsh. Everyone else is primarily reward based with aversives to increase speed/drive. Clubs are frequently standoffish because they get burnt out on people who don't want to put in the work--

I wish you the best of luck finding a club! I think you may find it challenging to find a protection sport club that is force free. 


With a working dog, they just love to work, they won't care if its agility or dock diving or rally obedience. And you'll have a much easier time finding positive only people in some of those less harsh sports. Any of those could be a lot of fun if you're open to it."

Depending on the club they may want you to pay dues to be around even if you're not working a dog. 

I found the people in my club a little standoffish (except the person that originally invited me) and didnt really take me seriously at first bc I have an off breed (a lab) that I'm working. I observed for several weeks before ever bringing my puppy to have a turn. It really should be a great place for you to be able to learn and ask questions and meet a bunch of working dogs to see if its something you really like.

Monitor for abnormal behavior. So long as eating/drinking/peeing/pooping/playing normally, you shouldn't have much to worry about. If any of those things become abnormal, then it's time to see a vet. Frequently when a dog eats something it shouldn't, it will either vomit it up or pass it without issue. If that's the case then no special vet visit needed. 

I'm not a vet, just an experienced owner. So take my advice with a grain of salt. I usually call my vet to verify my plan of wait-and-see is appropriate so I have that verification. When my dogs have eaten something questionable, it's always been that way, never an immediate vet visit."

dogs,fekqre2,t1_fekmy05,1579205666.0,"Yes absolutely. Many dogs can straight up bite onto toys or pick stuff up off the ground while in a normal bakersville muzzle. It's because the bakersville are rubber and have some give to them. I can't find a YouTube video but I have seen videos in muzzle dogs Facebook groups of people with dogs who are able to play tug of war etc etc while wearing a rubber muzzle. 

A bakersville is fine for mildly reactive dogs or dogs that are just getting muzzle trained as a just in case training practice. But for a true bite risk dog they are not adequate."
dogs,fekkt25,t1_fekh3wv,1579202123.0,"Just as a note to anyone reading this, a bakersville ultra (most common type I see) are NOT SUITABLE for dogs that are actually a bite risk. A determined dog can and will be able to get a bite off through them. Something like a Jafco muzzle or a wire basket muzzle is actually bite proof and more appropriate for a dog with bite history."
AmItheAsshole,fek6xxv,t1_fejh88y,1579193886.0,"What? 14 is plenty old to be watching babies, depending on the kid. I started babysitting infants at 11 years old. It's not a big deal if you can trust the babysitter. It's a few hours, not over night or multiple days."
OpenDogTraining,fei4o0k,t1_fehy095,1579130201.0,Awesome thanks for explaining! I'm super novice and the club I train with doesn't have much exposure to training off breeds for IGP. My puppy doesn't have much possession so walking off the floor with his toy ends with him dropping it premature. I'm thinking adding more frustration is going to be the way to go.
OpenDogTraining,fehx0iz,t1_fedjhv8,1579125546.0,"Can you expand a bit on building prey drive for protection?

I'm going to compete in IGP with my lab and we are trying to increase his prey drive. 

I've always been told to end a flirt pole session on a high note, with the dog getting the prey item and being able to walk off with it. Sounds like you're saying rather than that to let him get it but end with him frustrated (not on a 'win')?"
OpenDogTraining,fehwpoa,t3_ep8f5t,1579125375.0,"In the immediate future, muzzle train your dog and use a muzzle on all walks. You need to manage the behavior in the near term before you end up with an obstruction surgery on your hands (also buy pet insurance now before you need it, esp with a trash eater).

There are many guides out there on how to acclimate your dog to a muzzle. Take your time to train it properly. Also make sure to fit it properly. Inside a basket muzzle your dog should be able to open its mouth into a full pant--most pictures you see (especially product pictures) show dogs in a too small muzzle, so a properly fit one looks absolutely ridiculous. 


Do that to manage the behavior while you train an actual leave it/out command. Use a prong or ecollar as needed. The idea is though to do this in a controlled environment, so that your dog takes the bait when you are expecting it and can issue an appropriate correction because you arent caught off guard. 

If you honestly can't train a leave it, just continue using a muzzle to manage the behavior."
puppy101,feh66t1,t1_fegz6bz,1579109974.0,"It's your call, but I would honestly buy a small bag of the old kibble so you can mix it over a few days."
puppy101,feg2hmp,t3_eoys36,1579074055.0,"It sounds like you made a sudden kibble switch? You should be making a gradual change, generally over a two week period, by mixing old and new food, increasing the ratio of new to old every few days. Not doing so means that it's a shock to their system and often results in loose stools. 

If after a gradual change the loose stools persists, it could be that the food doesn't agree with them or they picked up a bug like giardia."
dogs,feg1t87,t3_eov5o7,1579073251.0,"As others have said, it sounds like you are not using the prong collar correctly. I would discontinue use until you can work with a balanced trainer who can show you how to utilize the tool properly."
k9sports,fe90sjz,t1_fe8tc4z,1578932937.0,Dude he is SUCH a fun puppy. His rear end awareness is out of this world. I can't wait to get him started in protection to see if he can do it.
k9sports,fe8pwrr,t1_fe8dvyp,1578929136.0,"I don't have a super recent video. This one is from two weeks ago when he was just barely starting to throw his feet for me. It's gotten a lot cleaner since. He's not as forgey now and his positioning stays pretty consistent.

k9sports,fe8cc9e,t3_eo3vxv,1578924734.0,"I'm planning to do IGP with my lab puppy. We have been hammering basic position hard the last week or so. Static and with a little movement. Two weeks ago it was super rare for my puppy to throw his feet and give me fancy feet/that pretty prance that a lot of IGP dogs do. He's at the point now where in the first pace we take he is throwing his feet super high and far out, and generally keeps a nice rhythm for me, with the exception of some crazy puppy bounces. 

Anyway I just LOVE this puppy and can't wait to see him grow."
OpenDogTraining,fds42vl,t1_fdrud6c,1578693939.0,"Yes, I really love clickers but I mainly use vocal markers. 

For my dogs:
Yes means ""that was correct, come get your reward""

Good means ""that is correct, but keep doing it. I may or may not bring you a reward""

Clicker means the same as good in my world, except they always get a reward. I expect them to hold the command until formally released. 

Ah-ah (negative markers are also important!!!) means ""that was wrong, try again"".

Like I said though, the puppy subreddit has a really great wiki that can help bring you up to speed on puppy training. It will give you a really good starting point to ask more specific questions, which means you'll get much better answers."
