Around 1/11 men have some degree of colourblindness with red/green being the most common, so I guarantee that in a room of 120 people you were not the only one struggling (unless it was like 95% women). You’re clearly the only one who had the guts to be honest about it. Your teacher won’t lose his job over this, but he will get a very stern reminder of his responsibilities from his bosses."

therewasanattempt,ffcxnmb,t1_ffcx7bz,1579809410.0,"One hospital that clearly knows what day it is! At every hospital I’ve worked at, the women have been officially called sisters and the men have officially been called charge nurse. It is on their uniforms and their badges. I have also met a male matron, which seemed utterly ridiculous because his managers clearly hadn’t been able to think of a non-gendered job title for him."
therewasanattempt,ffcwe5b,t1_ffcskob,1579808662.0,"No, that’s a secretary or a ward clerk. A medical assistant is likely to refer to a physician assistant (or associate), which is absolutely not a nurse."
therewasanattempt,ffcwaki,t1_ffcul2p,1579808601.0,"No, I mean sister and matron. Because both words are used as job titles and are embroidered into staff uniforms at the NHS hospital that I work at as a doctor.

Edit: 
I’m assuming you made your comment based on your experience at your own local hospital, who clearly live in the 21st century. However, every hospital I have worked at (and that’s a fair few) has used sister and matron as official job titles. I even worked at one where the nurses uniforms were various shades of purple. The male nurses wore white with little purple stripes on their shoulders which made them look like they belonged to a completely different profession to the women. Everyone seemed baffled when I pointed out how utterly ridiculous and outdated this was."

lifehacks,fey25fs,t1_fextv5x,1579439710.0,Why is it immoral for it to be illegal to make copies of someone else’s work without paying them for it?
lifehacks,fex8ys2,t1_fevzlg3,1579427033.0,"The law isn’t unjust though.

Wellthatsucks,feurdkw,t1_fetpdks,1579389236.0,"Well technically the English dictionary is descriptive rather than prescriptive. Meaning that if a term is used often enough, it becomes correct as it will then be included in the dictionary - like WiFi, YOLO etc. This is unlike French which is the other way round, in that the writers of the dictionary dictate to the public what is considered to be correct. So technically, there’s no such thing as an incorrect word in English - there’s just some that haven’t reached common usage yet."

As you say though, if you have stayed of the property for a certain amount of time then you can effectively make it your own.

To do so would merely be speculation. However, if as you suspect this nurse believes that a label of autism means an individual lacks capacity, then she is not fit to be a nurse."
unitedkingdom,fdjwkeu,t3_elnyaa,1578489814.0,"Question - what happens to a property once the lease expires? If I am the property owner, is that it, am I evicted? How does this tally up with squatters rights laws I.e the one where if I occupy a piece of land for a certain amount of time with nobody formally objecting to this then I am deemed to reasonably be the owner? It won’t be long before somebody challenges this and term limits on a lease will be deemed to be unenforceable, and therefore illegal. 

I completely understand the need for leases in flats - there are common areas which need upkeep and would be owned by someone who does not own the dwelling itself. It’s the term limits which, to me, seem unenforceable."
unitedkingdom,fdjw2sk,t1_fdh4miz,1578489386.0,"It’s almost as if some medical treatments have greater potential to do harm than others, thus requiring a higher level of mental capacity than others. Just because an individual is deemed to have capacity to request the oral contraceptive pill, a relatively low risk medication with no permanent side effects, does not necessarily mean that same individual is able to consent to a course of treatment which radically and permanently alters their body in an unpredictable manner."
unitedkingdom,fdjvp3r,t1_fdhitin,1578489043.0,"Wrong. The issue regarding autism is one of their capacity to consent for potentially irreversible/harmful treatment. Autism is a spectrum, with some individuals affected so severely that they fail to develop any form of language skills. I’ve met adults who’s autism has rendered them incontinent, and unable to eat, drink or dress themselves independently. Autism by no means invalidates anyone’s rights, but it raises the question as to whether they are able to fully understand the implications of the decision they are making."
