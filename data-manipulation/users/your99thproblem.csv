AskRedditAfterDark,ff5sh37,t3_erq7n3,1579608534.0,"Mine was about 2 of years of waiting. We reconnected several years after HS. We were barely friends then & he was a total nerd but he grew to be a fine young man when another classmate reintroduced us. We were both in relationships but it was hard to stay away from each other. Found out he was great kisser & we were highly sexually compatible. Plenty of phone sex & mutual masturbation in cars after meeting for lunch. We shared a loft of intimate details about each other. 

When we finally were single we decided to met in a hotel it went to shit. He was very nervous & came super fast. Like 45 seconds fast. I was completely empathetic but his embarrassment kept is apart after that."
