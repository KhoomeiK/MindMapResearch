askgaybros,ff9bhu1,t3_esclhf,1579709177.0,"Yep, I have.   
I'm currently in the process of losing weight and I'm currently 40lbs of my planned 80lb. I initially did it because I caved into the notion that I have to looks a certain way in order to increase the chances of attracting someone.   


Don't let anyone else in here make you feel like you're stupid for feeling this way. We've been putting this pressure on ourselves for decades if not longer and it's not letting up anytime soon. But if you're seriously invested in all of those changes, at least make sure you're doing it for your own self worth as well."
Makeup,ff8hx9j,t1_ff79npd,1579679265.0,"Nope, that's pretty standard for retail. I worked at Mac and our policy was pretty similar to this. Don't embarrass them and make a new tester."
Makeup,ff8htfy,t1_ff7p9xn,1579679127.0,"Don't expect this to get you very far though. Most stores have a budget for testers and can only allocate their stock for so many of them. It's worth it to ask if it matters that much to you, as long as you don't catch an attitude if they say no."
Makeup,ff8hpmo,t1_ff6mjfy,1579678993.0,Your absolutely right. Sephora as a brand was literally  built around the concept of letting customers physically interact with the product. The company wouldn't exist without testers.

AskGaybrosOver30,ff5isso,t3_efohp3,1579594822.0,"Coming to this thread late to the game, really late so my apologies.   
First and foremost, The only innocent party here is Gina and quite frankly, she deserves and apology. Regardless of whether you hear back from her, at the very least for the sake of acknowledging what you put her through, apologize.   


2nd, if I'm understanding what you wrote correctly, Ben knew that you were in a relationship with Gina. If this is indeed the case then under no circumstances should you ever contact that man ever again. He knew that you were in the closet, and more than likely knew all of the risks that are associated with dating a closeted person. If he did indeed know that you were dating Gina, then he knew what he signed up for and did an incredibly dangerous, and selfish act that could've put you in serious danger. Regardless of how egregiously you fucked up (and you really, really, really did) there is never any justification for outing someone unless they are actively  endangering the well-being of other Queer People.   


Leave both of those people alone and become re-acquainted with yourself and your new reality as an out gay person. Welcome to the party. Don't get involved with anyone till  your ready."
CelebrityPenis,ff5hczj,t1_ff4xbb8,1579592924.0,"Did he ever actually do porn? I recognize him from my Tumblr days but all I ever saw of him was doing DJ sets with his dick out and the occasional drag look.   


He's Russian I think so I believe he turned down the gayness after they started rounding up and murdering gay people over there."
MensLib,ff3sk6u,t1_ff2rsa8,1579547932.0,"THIS!!! I always hate the quote ""Homophobia is men fearing that they'll be treated like women!""   
It almost exclusively shifts victim status of homphobia to cishet women and ignores the homophobic reality that Queer Men and Women have to deal with."
BeautyGuruChatter,ferqw78,t1_feqd3gg,1579357313.0,"For me personally, it feels more like Colourpop opened the market up to overconsumption rather than changing the market for singles. There are plenty of companies whose singles are waaaaaaaay more expensive and are still a big part of their branding, Inglot's eyeshadows are $8, Sugarpill's Shadows are $13 and MUFE's shadows are $17 (granted you get more product but you catch my drift).   
I've never pulled the plug on their pressed shadows because that price point always makes me suspicious as to why they can offer it for that cheap."
BeautyGuruChatter,fepzgbs,t1_feoed8k,1579335242.0,"Her single matte shadows are literally only a dollar more than colourpop's, and is still somewhat consistent with her original price point.  I don't get why people are talking as if she's suddenly pricing herself as a luxury brand or something.  
Her products are still easily affordable."
BeautyGuruChatter,fepyzdz,t1_feow2fw,1579335002.0,Her single shadows are literally only a dollar more than colourpop's singles. The reason why the build your own palette is so expensive is because it's included the price of the actual palette case herself. Just buy one or two single shadows in neutrals shades that you're likely to use and give them a spin.
BeautyGuruChatter,feo9co3,t1_feo2ui1,1579296856.0,"Or, you could be mindful of the fact that your essentially speaking about someone while their right in front of you and can potentially hear everything you're saying and be mindful of that fact.

She didn't say anything had about them, she didn't chide them or denigrate them, she simply said ""if y'all do this, I'm blocking you."" 

I personally think it's a pretty valid response."

BeautyGuruChatter,feo7dot,t1_feniawb,1579296138.0,"I mean, they made public comments with their public profiles on a public page. If they were that concerned about discretion they could've easily done what Alissa suggested and dm'd each other."
BeautyGuruChatter,feo6ofq,t1_fenawn1,1579295870.0,$15 for a quad isn't bad a especially considering that MUG built their brand in their shadows. There are a lot of cute quads in there that I'm legit interested in picking up (the stormy mini palette is calling my name)
TheValleyFolk,feny5df,t1_fengoc2,1579292568.0,"It also means that it could in fact very well that she wasn't properly warned and that the guys are in denial about how they've handled the situation. We have to remember that the party that's divulged the most information in this entire situation has been the guys. 

By clearly discussing the situation with outside parties clearly before the issue came to ahead and afterwards (even with the claims of red tape), they had a pretty steady flow of information coming out regarding the narrative of this situation. It was all coming from parties that had personal relationships with the guys themselves as opposed to Lee.

This isn't my fight, I know none of the parties involved, I'm just saying that regardless of whether it had to happen or not, the way it was executed, and the resulting behavior afterwards left a pretty bad taste in my mouth."
TheValleyFolk,femoo9s,t1_femno7d,1579264923.0,"Listening to Lee in the podcast, she's maintained her story in that whatever the reasoning was, that she didn't see it coming and that she was blindsided. She didn't divulge into any further details other than she was proud of herself for following through with her first departure video because she wanted to be open and honest with her truth at the moment. 

Even those third parties have partial information because I doubt they have Lee's perspective on the situation. And it still sounds like whatever the issue, they were clearly taking about it behind her back.

From what it sounds like, if I remember correctly, whatever the issue was, it was something that was brewing for a long time that supposedly could've (and from the boys, had account been) been addressed earlier but for whatever reason they decided to withhold the decision to cut ties until the absolute worst time possible."
BeautyGuruChatter,fem4xv5,t1_fekstjp,1579239906.0,"Ordinary is the makeup artists bread and butter, and surprisingly it's what pays the most.   
I bought a bunch of her books when I first started and they're absolutely fantastic for learning the fundamentals, but she's not the one you go to for ""showstopping"" looks."
Keto_Food,fe8n0os,t3_enotiq,1578928123.0,"Good luck finding the bread. I've tried figuring out which stores in my area carry it and it's been such a pain in the butt.

I tried calling ahead but Aldi keeps all of their store phone numbers private. So I have to physically go from location to location to hunt for it and even though plenty of them say they *had* it, they don't currently have it in stock."
askgaybros,fe2bc63,t1_fe291v7,1578836484.0,"Oh, it was a student group. That explains it.   
You're dealing with a particular group of the queer community who are the most often victimized so they tend to be a pretty insular. There's a lot of history to take into account and from looking a your comments it likely won't be a productive conversation, but I will say this (and I don't say this to dismiss your feelings) but you'll seriously be fine once your socializing options expand a bit.   
Outside of the these particular kinds of spaces, you'll be absolutely fine. Seriously, white masculine gays are very much at the top of the social totem pole within the community and I doubt that'll change anytime soon."
askgaybros,fe28r4z,t1_fe1sz6o,1578835694.0,Has this occurred more than once with several spaces/organizations or was it just this particular instance?
askgaybros,fe28fk8,t1_fe1lyxt,1578835560.0,"Wait, wait, wait, wait wait.   
You said you were in a gay (or queer space) and that you were asked to leave because you presented as masculine? What queer spaces are these?  


Was it club, bar, social gathering, legit asking for more clarification because I find this puzzling.   


What kind of gay spaces are we talking about because I've worked with a lot of queer organizations over the years and I've yet to encounter any that ask people to leave for simple gender presentation."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdrnc1r,t1_fdqs0i9,1578686898.0,"I wouldn't disagree with you that a lack of client photos implies either a lack of clientele or proficiency. But that wasn't my point, my point is that is not unheard of. 

The current trends on social media uplift IG Makeup Artists who are only really capable of doing looks on themselves. My ig page is a mix of my professional work and my own looks, and while my professional looks quite frankly are some of the best in my area (depending on what kind it aesthetic you value), it's not uncommon for my selfies to get more traction and attention.

With that being the case, I'm not surprised that an artist would rather just slap a look on themselves on themselves if they are seeing that IG Selfie Enthusiasts can get away with doing the same, even if they should be holding themselves to a more professional standard."
AskReddit,fdpqwu0,t1_fdpkta4,1578637104.0,"Literally what they said.   
After they won Bring The Funny, Joe, Elliot and Steve fired Lee. Like, within a couple days of them winning.   
They both posted videos talking about the split but the tones of the videos were RADICALLY different.   
Joe, Elliot and Steve posted a light-hearted video about Lee ""going off in her own creative direction"" and Lee straight up said ""They fired me after the biggest night of my life""  
After she was fired there was a bunch of speculation about what happened but neither parties have gone into any detail because of ""legal red tape"". Friends of the remaining members have claimed that Lee was difficult to work with.   


People were not happy about Lee's firing and they lost a fuckton of subs and fuckton of patreon suscribers, and apparently they haven't really recovered yet the fallout from firing her."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdpcekv,t1_fdmreve,1578625110.0,"I'm very much aware of how portfolios work. 

However portfolios and Social Media are not the same thing. 

I'm not going to be naming anyone because I won't publicly blast another artist like that over their own business practices (especially since it only hurts themselves). It's still a practice that happens and while I don't approve of it, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen (IG is proof enough) 

Bridal artists are at the whim of whether or not the photographer will give them images because the photographers hold all the rights to the images.
 
Editorial/Magazine Shoots are typically embargoed (meaning that no images, including BTS shots, are allowed to be posted) until the magazine in question had published the images in question. So it could literally be months before you get approval to post said images. Not only that but youh have to build up a reputation as an artist before any magazine worth the effort will even look your way. 

A professional website is an absolute necessity but the thing with test shoots is that there's always a turn-around time between when you dealing with professional photographers (paid work always comes first) and so you could be waiting weeks to months before you get your images. 

Not only that but before you do all of this you have 
1) vet the photographer to make sure they're capable of producing quality content and not a creep
2) find a suitable model whose appropriate for the shoot in question, AND capable of producing quality work (which means often working through an agency which is a whole different can of worms) 
3) source other creatives to contribute to the shoot (a fashion stylist, a hairstylist, and a nail tech if you want all sources to be covered) 
4) source a location that is either free or affordable
5) coordinate everyone's schedule to work on the same day and pray that everyone arrives and put's for their best effort. 

Putting together a quality portfolio of work absolutely is a huge effort and anyone who has a portfolio worth while will tell you so.

So I'm not surprised when in a completely over-saturated market where few people actually understand the logistics and etiquette of said market resort to following a basic-ass formula that seemingly works for others on the same platform."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdm1nz3,t1_fdkn0rs,1578537687.0,"Because you can dislike something and still feel the need to do it. He's a youtube makeup artist so of course he's going to post looks that features eye shadow. That doesn't mean he has to like doing it.   
Are we really doing this already? The guy hasn't even had a chance to fuck up yet."
BeautyGuruChatter,fdm16ci,t1_fdk7j3n,1578537356.0,"Because instagram and IG has completely changed how makeup artists market themselves. It's a lot easier to toss on a quick beat and snap a couple of pics in front of a blank wall then set up an entire photoshoot to get professional pictures. And not only that but  a lot of time you get a lot more traction on IG posting your own makeup than posting client pics.   


I know plenty of artists who do this and I personally find it infuriating, but it's honestly none of my business. It's not a good idea to have zero images of your work on your IG but it's definitely not unheard of."
