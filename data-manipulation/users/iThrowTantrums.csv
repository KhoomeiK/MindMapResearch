AustralianPolitics,ff3uxfn,t1_ff2wqi3,1579549396.0,That sounds insane because it's another completely made up interpretation. Why don't you read what I wrote again?
AustralianPolitics,fer1u46,t1_fequqls,1579348606.0,Lol that's not what I said at all mister strawman!
AustralianPolitics,feo3d86,t1_femx5jb,1579294598.0,"A vote for a political party, obviously, doesn't mean that person supports every single one of their policies. It follows then that political parties can't use winning an election to claim a mandate for every single one of their policies (despite them doing this all the time)."
AustralianPolitics,fenvkdf,t1_femf3m9,1579291570.0,I'm glad you agree with the majority of research conducted by qualified climate scientists then!

science,fejh5f6,t1_fejbnwc,1579174019.0,"No, those numbers are fine, I just take issue with idiots who are parroting the 180 arsonists lie and the other lie that these bushfires have nothing to do with climate change and everything to do with arsonists. It's simply not true."
science,fej3y62,t1_fej2h6j,1579155993.0,"Nice try at deflecting, but returning to your lie:

> He’s correct, most of the fires are arson related.

Only 24 people arrested for arson, and not a shred of evidence supporting your claim. Regardless of the cause of the fires (arson being but one cause every fire season), the intensity of the fires is related to climate change, as all the experts confirm. Stop parroting Murdoch lies."
science,fej21wy,t1_fej0vls,1579154035.0,That's a lie pushed by Murdoch newspapers. 24 people have been arrested for arson. https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/news_article?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGZWJpenByZC5wb2xpY2UubnN3Lmdvdi5hdSUyRm1lZGlhJTJGODIyNjQuaHRtbCZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D

AustralianPolitics,fei93td,t1_fei51j6,1579133035.0,You just have to read the cesspool that is the comments section on any article in the Australian relating to energy or climate to see a lot of these people ARE buying their bullshit though...

facepalm,fehmrjk,t1_fehm0et,1579119700.0,Oh no. A random shill account was mean to me. How will I cope.

Go away, bot."
facepalm,fehdpxx,t1_fegwe9v,1579114436.0,Why would your lie about the bushfires like that?

AustralianPolitics,fcshz3f,t3_eikkzg,1577916865.0,"Great news, a far better solution than calls for cancelling the event when the budget was mostly already spent. Hopefully the money raised will go to where it's needed most."
AustralianPolitics,fcsh967,t1_fcrzg1c,1577916523.0,Are you implying there shouldn't have been a fund raiser? Or that the fireworks should have been cancelled despite most of the budget already spent? Or are you just quoting stats for fun?
