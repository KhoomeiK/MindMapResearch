selfharm,ffkl9hd,t3_eu0lbo,1580024628.0,I usually make myself feel better by asking myself “if I saw this on another person would I think there’s a lot of cuts?” and the answer is always yes so that’s how I know if I have a lot or if they’re deep
selfharm,ffkl393,t3_etyjeg,1580024546.0,"I do the exact same thing. I know exactly where I was for all my cut sessions and what happened. For example I know which ones are from the first time I cut, fist time I used a blade, first styro, first deeper styro. The list just goes on, and idk if I just have a good memory or I’m attached to cutting or something"
selfharm,fem1z7k,t3_epuctm,1579237133.0,You need stitches if you can’t close the cut if you squeeze it together. Also if you hit fat you should. Most styro cuts don’t need stitches depending where it is on your body.

depression,fe6d0x5,t3_enx6ff,1578887348.0,"I’m 15 and since I was 12 I would binge shows. I just realized a couple months ago it was to escape reality. It’s almost like an addiction for me cuz I don’t wanna stop living in the fictional world of tv and movies, so I keep watching even if I have to do other things. It interferes with a lot of things in my life where it makes me unsuccessful, But it makes the depressing thoughts go away for a bit"

You should play it because it won’t be hard to understand since you already play a string instrument. The only thing you would have to get used to is the posture!

depression,fd7xocz,t3_eka4sx,1578211566.0,"Don’t make cutting a habit. I cut and it’s the worst thing I’ve ever done. It’s exhausting hiding scars, and having family find out was my worst nightmare, and still is. It’s very addictive because of the chemicals your body releases when it feels pain, and I became addicted. It’s so much worse than other people put it, and I regret starting to cut so much. I really wish I could go back. What I wrote doesn’t even represent that half of how bad it is. I’m not even talking about how it could get infected, even though that is a problem. Infections aren’t a problem for me, but everything she’s about it is so bad except for the relief it gives me for like an hour"

selfharm,fcpj71w,t1_fcping4,1577865590.0,"What I also don’t understand is that my therapist already told my mom I cut like 3 months ago. I don’t get why she seemed to surprised to see I actually did, and she thought I did it with my nails when they were pretty deep cuts. She probably just doesn’t get that I’m actually cutting with blades and not just saying I self harm with a couple scratches from my nails"

My sister didn’t say anything, but she texted me a little bit ago saying that she’s here for me. I would never actually talk to my sister though. My mom kept on telling me that she doesn’t want me doing that, and was yelling at me, I really hated that cuz loud noises give me anxiety so I can’t really respect her for using that tone of voice with me which is why I can’t really face her without crying. I’m really embarrassed to face my sister also"

selfharm,fcphpad,t3_eiey4x,1577864580.0,"I just had the worst experience ever with cutting. My family saw and it was really bad, extremely damaged from it. I wish I could go back and never start cutting cuz I also started cuz I was curious. I don’t see any health problems unless you go too deep or don’t take care of it, but don’t start, it’s the worst thing that I have ever done and I can’t stop doing it now. Trying to hide that cuts all the time is exhausting, it becomes literally all you think about, wether its when you’re going to cut next or trying to hide them. It could also be the burning sensation after you do it that lasts for a minimum of 3 days. Please don’t make it a regular thing cuz I don’t want anyone to go through the same emotional pain I’ve gone through because of cutting. My mom forced me to show her the cuts after I told her no about 50 times. I can’t get over what happened to me from the effects of cutting, and I want to stop so bad but I’ve never felt stronger urges to shred open my whole wrist. Even if it starts really small, you’re going to want to go deeper and cut more. It’s an addiction because of the chemicals the pain makes your brain release, and once you do it enough, you will become addicted"
