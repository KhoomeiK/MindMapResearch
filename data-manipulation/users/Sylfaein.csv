A nurse giving me a flu shot taught me this. When you’re about to get a shot, ask for a spare alcohol pad (the kind they’re rubbing your arm with). As they’re about to give you the shot, you (looking away from the injection, of course) sniff that alcohol pad. The premise is that the harsh smell of the alcohol is distracting enough to take your attention off the needle.

Again, German Shepherds were repurposed for military and law enforcement use, not designed for it. And they were chose for it not because of aggression, but because they’re strong, loyal, and highly intelligent and trainable. They’re driven by a deep desire for praise, which makes them the dog of choice for many skilled applications where utmost accuracy is essential.

Also, no one’s said that pit bulls were bred to kill people, they just happen to do it more than any other breed. Once the switch flips, they don’t care much what they happen to be mauling. People like to say that they were bred to be dog aggressive, not human aggressive, but you can’t fine-time DNA quite THAT precisely—they’re just aggressive. In fact, one of the prominent creators and promoters of the breed in the early 1900’s lost his own young nephew to one of his pit bulls.

It is absolutely cruel that they were ever created. On that, we can agree. They were designed for sick bloodsports by people with no ethics. It’s not their fault they’re like this, and the ethical thing to do would be to spay/neuter them all, and let the breed go peacefully and humanely."
unpopularopinion,ff31tpl,t1_ff2w8io,1579531448.0,"...Do you know anything about the origins of dog breeds, at all?

German Shepherds weren’t bred for war. Look at their name. SHEPHERD. They were bred to protect livestock. They are, however, routinely selected for combat and law enforcement use because of their strength and intelligence. You can train a German Shepherd to be basically bomb-proof; the breed is so eager to please, that they can be trained to the level of precision needed for such jobs. It’s not what they were originally designed for, but it’s a niche they would later be found to fit well. (Now, if you want to see a breed designed for war, look up the molossus. It’s an extinct breed, but if memory serves, it’s an ancestor of the pit bull.)

Pit bulls weren’t chosen on a whim to be fighting dogs, they were DESIGNED TO BE FIGHTING DOGS. It’s even in their name! “Pit” = the fighting pits, or “pit fighter”. 

And no, I don’t expect a rescued pit bull to act like a Labrador. Quite the contrary. But while pit advocates will scream all day long “iT’s HoW tHeY’rE rAiSeD!”, they’ll turn right around and expect people to adopt pit bulls rescued straight from fighting rings, which is downright dangerous, and should get them sued out of existence when those animals inevitably snap and kill."

They were first developed for bear and bull baiting. If you’re not familiar with what that is (because it’s been illegal for a VERY long time now), the basic gist is a bear or bull would be tethered, and then vicious dogs set upon it to tear it up for the amusement of the crowd. Barbaric bloodsport.

Once that was made illegal, the pit bull was moved to dog fighting.

They were absolutely not bred for defense, or like the other breeds you mentioned. For example, where any of those dogs will warn before attacking (growling, showing teeth, body language), the majority of pit bull attacks happen without warning—this is by design, because breeders wanted dogs that wouldn’t broadcast their intent to opponents in the pit."
unpopularopinion,ff2zany,t1_ff2qn43,1579529372.0,"YOU get it right. Pit bulls were originally bred for bull and bear baiting, and when that was outlawed, they were moved to dog fighting. They weren’t called “nanny dogs” until 1971, when an unscrupulous breeder said that in an interview to try and rebrand them to sell more puppies.

Look at any animal, and you can see signs of what it does in how it’s built. It’s high school level biology. Play with a Labrador’s feet, and you’ll find webbing between their toes. Why? Because they were designed to retrieve water fowl shot by hunters, and are expected to swim.

A large number of pit victims are children. It’s not a violent situation, until the pit snaps.

And the variety of reasons advocates for the breed give to justify the killings is incredible. “The child was holding a stuffed animal/moved too fast/was too loud/touched the dog.” And then there’s the cases where pits have mauled their epileptic owners because they had a seizure, and advocates jump on the seizure as an excuse (“It scared the dog!”)."

My brother and I haven’t spoken to him in years, so that’s to be expected, and that woman’s children are failures, so they definitely need the money more than we do. I detest everything about that man, and legitimately want nothing from him. He was always trying to buy my brother and I off when we were kids, and would stick $100 cash in a card and drop it off in the mailbox on Christmas (which was sometimes all we heard from him in a year)—last time, I just gave it to my brother, I was so disgusted with the idea. If I WERE to be left an inheritance by him, I certainly wouldn’t want to use the money myself, and feel like I owed him anything. I think I’d use it to spite him, as one final “*^%# you” by doing something good for others with it, that he wouldn’t agree with—like donate it to an LGBTQ charity, or better yet, give it to my friends who are trans to put towards their operations. “Suck it, you bigot.”

In my mother’s case, once again, there’s likely to not be much—in her case, it’s because she’s never managed to be successful because she spent all mine and my brother’s childhood hoping a man would come along and let her be a stay at home mom, so she put nothing into building a career or increasing her worth. I’d expect to have been removed from the will, and everything left to my brother—he’s always been her favorite, and would have gotten the lion’s share, anyway. If she sticks with the guy she’s dating this time (they rotate, from time to time), I imagine my brother will have a fight on his hands. Her current boyfriend is around fifty, and never settled into a career, he just lives off of whatever he wants to do at the time; he was the used car salesman we bought my first car from, and now he cleans out foreclosed houses, or something. I’d be shocked if he had any kind of retirement savings, and am fairly certain he’s looking at her as his retirement plan. About all she has is a house she’s allowed to run down around her, and I’d bet anything my brother will have to fight that man and his son in court to get it if it’s left to him, and evict one or both of them. That said, I absolutely wouldn’t want that house; just setting foot on that property before I went no contact with her set every anxiety alarm in my brain off, and I never want to look at it again. If I got it, I’d probably burn it dow and sell the lot. It was my prison and my hell, and the scene in “Forest Gump” where Jenny throws rocks at her childhood home speaks to my soul."

Telling kid now that it’s from her could ruin Santa for him, entirely.

Plus, the real fun in it is seeing how excited the kids get, not in making sure they know who it came from. Little ones believing in Santa, and being able to get them the gifts that facilitate that is the funnest part of Christmas. That she, knowing it was meant to be a Santa gift, later INSISTED kid know it was actually from her is incredibly narcissistic. Her need for kid to know grandma bought the big toy is more important to her than letting kid believe in Santa. That’s a pathetic “adult”."
BanPitBulls,feds5hm,t3_eodgf2,1579018731.0,"Mine is a little roundabout. When I was a child, my brother and I did get a pair of mutt puppies from a cousin, who I strongly suspect were pit mixes when I look back at photos. All our animals were outdoors (rural area, 1990’s, etc), and we’d had dogs with cats and livestock all before and after these, with no problems. Even a full-blooded chow had no problems. Those dogs I think were under a year old, when they had to go. First, they tried to maul a kitten; the kitten fortunately escaped, but my mother is an idiot, and didn’t get rid of them then. The last incident was when they ripped a hole in the side of a goat so bad, the poor thing had to be put down. My mother, again an idiot, got rid of all three dogs, including the non-pit who likely had nothing to do with the attack.

Overall, my stance on pit bulls comes from the fact that I approach most everything in life from a stance of logic, over emotion. I research, and place a high value on data and stats. It’s no wonder I’ve done very well for myself in insurance.

The fact of the matter is that when you weigh risk vs reward on pit bulls, it makes no sense to own such an animal. Just looking at them with even a high school biology background is enough for you to see just what they’re for. We bred labs to have webbed feet so they could swim better to retrieve water fowl for hunters. Dachshunds were bred to be long-bodied with short legs to get into badger dens. The form of greyhounds is obviously made for running. If you really and truly look at pit bulls without the “aLl DoGs ArE gOoD bOiS” mentality, what you’ll see is an animal that was designed for carnage. Everything about them was designed to take and inflict as much damage as possible. They were never meant to be pets. 

Then there’s a couple of other incidents, later in life. My idiot mother, true to form, has gone pit nutter because her current boyfriend is one. He had a pit that disappeared (he lets them run around—no fences, no collars), and got another one which he had to shoot because when he let it out to go potty one day, it ran into a neighbor’s pasture, and latched onto a grazing cow’s throat.

Then just last week, my neighbor’s pit bull (who for the last almost two years has barked and throw itself at the fence so violently that I can’t even enjoy my back yard) managed to break through our less than two year old sturdy wooden fence, to get to one of our dogs. Thankfully, she wasn’t hurt, and idiot neighbor repaired the fence, but now I’m looking at taking the whole thing down to replace with masonry so that next time the murder mutt tries to break my fence, it breaks its stupid skull open, instead.

I. Hate. Pit bulls."
