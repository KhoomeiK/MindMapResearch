vanderpumprules,fehq4yi,t1_fehpvb6,1579121647.0,"excellent point, and really kinda accurate in regards to Jax. lol

i actually feel for Kristen which has never happened before. Carter is an emotionally manipulating jackass, so is Jax. i feel that's at the core of him being right."
vanderpumprules,feh6b09,t1_feh61p3,1579110045.0,yes. i do think Jax is trying to not be as trashbag too. and i do think he cares about Kristen.
