It might be an interpretation the word of God, and it does lay down the main ideas behind Christianity. But every chapter and every verse of it was written by real people; each with their own human biases, agendas, and prejudices.

Following the Bible literally word for word is a dangerous plan if left unchecked. But that doesn't make it a bad book to learn from. Just don't focus on the details too much, and learn to recognize when these biases come up in the text. 

In fact, do this with everything you read. You never know what you might find."

TheExpanse,fe8ztgk,t3_eo390d,1578932711.0,"I've got two theories as to why they did this. As we saw in the final scene of season 4, the asteroids were actually set to run multiple gravity assists past the planets rather than just going for a direct hohmann transfer. Not only would this make the asteroid harder to track than a direct path, but each gravity assist could actually speed up the rock by several kilometers per second (we already do this today with space probes in order to save energy on fuel)

The problem is, even though more speed means more kinetic energy on impact, you have to remember that asteroids are still just rocks. If it hits the atmosphere hard enough at the wrong angle, aerodynamic forces will disintegrate and vaporize it explosively as an airburst. Although the shock wave would still be huge, none of the asteroid would be able to make it to the ground. So, there is an upper limit to how fast it can realistically go and still hit the Earth."
