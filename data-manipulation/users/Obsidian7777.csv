Titanfall_2_,fg0fdrm,t1_fg09vbi,1580406642.0,Then just keep going. You're gonna have that one that you just feel it. You got this.

Titanfall_2_,fg09825,t1_fg04umx,1580402934.0,"It's just gonna take repeated practice. The timer starts when you get through the archway, so take a step back and get a running start. Well placed grenades are gonna be your best friend."
Titanfall_2_,fg04rji,t1_ffzsmto,1580400192.0,"Use a shotgun, stay off the floor unless you're sliding. Know exactly where the enemies are and try it repeatedly. The only way you get faster is repetition and familiarity."

camping,ffqbacz,t3_euh4ku,1580129073.0,I have a question. What are the forks on the end of the spit for? Do you bring those in to hold the meat in place?

facepalm,ffqa8nd,t1_ffq8i92,1580127944.0,You're absolutely right. I'm a bad judge of weight and I probably should have looked it up first.
facepalm,ffqa15e,t1_ffq75tw,1580127708.0,"Spent a month in the hospital. Hyper extended left ankle, damaged the connective tissues in my left elbow and left knee. Cracked my skull on the left side right into my ear canal. Even when I came out of my coma I was a wobbly fucker. Walked with a snazzy cane for a bit, then when I was able, I got another bicycle to get over me fear of riding around cars. Mind you, this was like fifteen years ago, but those injuries are coming back in the last year or so to bite me."
Baking,ffq9o28,t3_euh5vw,1580127289.0,"This is beautiful and looks delicious. You did an amazing thing, so don't be your worst critic. We all do that."
facepalm,ffq70fe,t1_ffq532j,1580123878.0,"I dunno, dude. Aside from having my left knee and left elbow basically disintegrating and having an amazing myriad of back problems, not much."
facepalm,ffq4e0a,t1_ffq3xrm,1580119824.0,"Had she gotten in the way of the car, getting bumped under and run over by the tires might have been likely. There are quite a few ways a 1400 pound car can hurt you.
Source: I was hit by a car."
comicbooks,ffm4pjy,t3_eu0h8g,1580048498.0,This reminds me of the artwork for The Sixth Gun.

RealGirls,fewnfi0,t3_eqnl5y,1579415706.0,Because it's like ten fucking degrees outside...

AskReddit,fecywqj,t1_fecb353,1578990406.0,"I don't know if they still have them around, as I've only stayed in a casino hotel once, but have never gambled, but there are kiosks that will literally let you pull a mortgage on your house with no questions asked, inside of a casino. It's one of the most evil ideas I've ever seen enacted."

witcher,fe7mdhz,t1_fe6tcah,1578916436.0,Your depiction of Geralt reminds me of Alucard from Symphony of the Night.
witcher,fe7m6zf,t1_fe7jqkc,1578916341.0,The actress that played the part of Triss did a great job. Just because she isn't how she's described doesn't mean crap. Fack off.
Warframe,fe61ojj,t1_fe5yoq5,1578879794.0,That would honestly be an amazing novel completely siding with non humans.
horror,fe5j7yg,t1_fe4l5gy,1578870131.0,"I know you're getting downvoted, and I'm not gonna lash out at you, but I have to ask what turned you off about the series? In my opinion it's a masterfully constructed game of cat and mouse, a deep look into a symbiotic relationship, and the only possible way I wouldn't look as Sir Anthony Hopkins as being the only Hannibal out there. Mads Mikkelson played that role to perfection, and the shared relationship with Will Graham kept me coming back for more."
Warframe,fe4xgzk,t3_enrlqu,1578863741.0,This looks like Isaac Clarke got dropped into WF.
