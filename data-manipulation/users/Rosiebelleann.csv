CanadaPublicServants,fe1qygu,t1_fe1ob7m,1578829823.0,"I think OP is voicing their concern because they are having some mental health issues. Sometimes this can make you a little more introspective than a situation requires. Overthinking is the enemy. 
I would recommend taking an advocate with you either a friend, a colleague, or a family member if your boss is okay with that. I don't think you should take union representation unless you truly feel that your boss will try to bully you into returning to the office to work. (Which they can try but they should not) I would certainly make the union aware of your situation so that if something does go awry, you are already on their radar. 
Go to the meeting with the premise that everyone wants to do the best right thing, including your boss. Good luck feel better."

AskOldPeople,fd58xjd,t3_ejsvhz,1578175297.0,"61 year old. I would not be too sure about having less days to live than you have already lived. If you are worried about illness and disability in old age I suggest you get to the gym, to the park, strap on some runners, get in the pool, get some good friends do the crossword, .....you get the idea. If it is solely the worry of your own mortality, I hope that you will not waste too much time on it because you can't do a single blessed thing about it. I believe that people who worry a lot about dying have unsettled business. Settle it and go enjoy the rest of your life."
