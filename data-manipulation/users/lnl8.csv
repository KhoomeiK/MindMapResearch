getdisciplined,fekdfte,t1_fdemsb9,1579197728.0,"I think it’s a great app! Two minor suggestions: give an option on which day to start. Like a couple of items I started Wednesday. And then on Friday I thought of something else and added it.  But now all my days are off and seem out of sync. Like on flossing it is Wednesday in the first circle. But on running I have Friday as the first circle. A little prettier if I could have them all have Monday as the first circle. 
And then if it would be possible to move the habits around it would be helpful. Like I want stretch and running to be next to eachother. But I have floss in between them and can’t move it. 
Regardless of these it’s a great tracker, just wanted to give a little feedback. Thanks!"
