relationship_advice,ffd2n2q,t1_ffc420g,1579812206.0,"This is in line with what I thought. But the person she married has always been here and is still here. I have grown and changed a lot over time but so has she. We both have completely different physical appearances, different personalities, etc than when we married. Looking back at wedding pictures, we look like different people. 

In relation to the trans thing, all I have done is told her, went to support group meetings, and my hair is slightly longer. I am not on hormones and I haven't changed gender appearances in any other way. I probably shouldn't have told her b/c if I don't transition, and I'm probably not going to, why even mention it? My problem is I keep nothing from her and when I realized I was trans I was so interested and whatnot I just told her. If the situation were reversed it really wouldn't be a big deal to me but everyone is different."
relationship_advice,ffcob0i,t1_ffcd4n4,1579803713.0,I am scheduling some meetings now. If she refuses to show up well then that's that I guess. I want to work on things but I can't work on things alone.
relationship_advice,ffco79h,t1_ffcgtti,1579803648.0,"I am going to set up a meeting or 2 with a few councilors. If she refuses to show up, or even reschedule at specific times and attend, I am going to have to face this reality I fear. 

Friendship is going to be a tough pill to take b/c the ending of the marriage would be difficult. There's a house, kids, debt, money, all the things in a normal relationship that people fight over in the end. just so happens in my state 50/50 custody is awarded easily if kids are kept in the same school district but that'd be far off in the future."
relationship_advice,ffcbj4s,t1_ffc808s,1579795880.0,"I am surprised because in 2018 I would have said you would be crazy that in a year or so I'd be thinking about ending our relationship. 2019 happened and my mind has changed. I'm surprised at how quickly the tides have changed. 

She met up with some high school friends a few weeks back. One of the things she said she was so surprised and disappointed by was the fact that they hadn't changed since high school. I

She has changed 180 since we married as well so pointing the finger at me, well that's just half the situation. She's changed, I've changed and over the past year, we both seem to be heading in different directions. 

yeah, counseling... I will set it up today. I really don't want to give up on us but I don't want to be in a loveless relationship either."

Pee,fdts1jm,t1_fdtd1rl,1578721310.0,"Well, usually my hand is in them, usually I'm rubbing, and I pee soaking myself. Someone has to lick my fingers... I'm dirty and it makes me so hot to talk about it"
SuicideWatch,fdik5yz,t1_fdgyhs4,1578444722.0,I agree. She wasn't the right person. The pieces will fall in place eventually.
SuicideWatch,fdik3wh,t1_fdggo9d,1578444686.0,"Lol, thanks. But I'd rather just be normal. And she's not a bad person, she just doesn't think she can help. My bad for going to the wrong place. I should have listened to my support group and seen one of their recommendations. 

I also got ""nope"" letters from 2 marriage councilors. So 0 for 3 thus far."
SuicideWatch,fdgt8xs,t1_fdg8eqv,1578407737.0,"I think she was right to push me off.  If she can't help me then trying is going to be bad for me. I'm sure she wouldn't want that kind of burden. And she did mention that she had a bad experience in the past with a trans person and wasn't able to help them. So, moving on."
SuicideWatch,fdfsgvl,t3_el5p5r,1578369083.0,"And she wanted to let me me that I'm tall, even for a man so it's going to be hard. G thanks. Being MTF, she's telling me I'll never pass."
SuicideWatch,fdao17n,t3_ekgjlh,1578248249.0,"I suggest therapy. But reaching out for help is a great first step. Your life has value and you are a beautiful human. Even if things aren't great, they can be. Small steps are possible and I believe in you."
relationship_advice,fda4l4i,t1_fd7qwal,1578241570.0,"This is not what I expected, not what I thought would happen. I thought we'd be together forever, thought we'd be happy and love each other. I never thought I'd hear her say the thought of sex with me is disgusting, which to me equates to I'm disgusting. Frankly I'm still expecting her to wake up. When I asked her if she thought we need counciling she said no. That too is a big flag to me. This isn't normal and I'm not going to be a roommate that pays her bills. That isn't a marriage. Sorry for the rant, I'm just so sad about this. 

I keep thinking about how this is going to be in a few years. Living in a different place, joint custody, kids in therapy. Then trying to find someone who loves me. I just don't want to do all that"
relationship_advice,fd7piqf,t1_fd7mlk3,1578208079.0,"I want to try therapy first. Make sure I give it everything I got. I don't think I can do months without sex, let alone the rest of my life"
relationship_advice,fd7llnr,t1_fd6skd8,1578206368.0,"That I could accept. People change and being ace, well that's a thing. But like the trans thing she didn't sign up for, I didn't sign up for ace."
relationship_advice,fd7l5fd,t1_fd6qpte,1578206181.0,"True, but I haven't transitioned. She knows but she doesn't see. If just me telling her is enough, well that's disappointing."
relationship_advice,fd5j0bi,t1_fd5fq49,1578178116.0,"I don't think so. She is straight as far as I know. I don't think she is cheating either. I've asked, she seemed surprised."
relationship_advice,fd5cely,t1_fd58s11,1578176225.0,I've considered this too. Manipulation is not my game. I don't even know how to play. I'm wondering if she is manipulating me to get as much as she can from me before ______. Whatever blank is. It's part of the reason I want a non bias 3rd party interpretation.
relationship_advice,fd551gm,t1_fd53bxp,1578174216.0,"Thanks. We're in the same boat. I'm wanting to try everything first. I couldn't accept just giving up without trying, but I can't do this forever. We'll see how it goes..."
relationship_advice,fd545se,t1_fd51qby,1578174046.0,"Thanks. I'm going to try counciling. I didn't think this is normal, didn't think me asking her to go to counseling was over the line, I'm glad I'm not being ridiculous."
relationship_advice,fd53rmp,t1_fd4zl9b,1578173929.0,"That's my concern. I want to work on us, I want to try. I read her not wanting to try as a sign."
relationship_advice,fd53ltz,t1_fd4z3ld,1578173878.0,"She had an issue some time ago. This could be related but I can't ask her to just ignore her past and let's bang. I think I'll ask her to try counciling. 

We used to be very intimate, it was such an emotional connection. Last year it has been cold, mechanical. Like a chore more than anything. 

I will ask her to seek counciling. I'm not ready to give up, but I can't be in a relationship where were roommates."
relationship_advice,fd51r46,t1_fd4ygdc,1578173381.0,"I can speculate, but she said it's not me. I don't know for sure, that's one reason I want to do therapy."
relationship_advice,fd51gwn,t1_fd4ykvp,1578173281.0,Thanks for this. I hadn't considered this for sure. She's on some stuff for an auto immune thing. I don't know the side effects. I can ask her if it's related.

SuicideWatch,fd1qitm,t1_fd1n985,1578135225.0,"Thanks. That helps. I appreciate the note. I just don't want to be transgeder, and the only way I know how to do that is to not be here."
SuicideWatch,fd1mwpb,t1_fd1l4vd,1578133561.0,"I'm transgeder. And that means a good chunk of the world agrees with me on being worthless. It also means my family hates me, and it means I'll never get to be normal. I'll always be a freak. I can't even accept myself how could the world. I've lost my faith in God and humanity. And I'm stupid stuck where I am because I have 5 kids. I kept searching for a reason to being depressed and I thought a family was the answer. They're great and all but now they're also a boat anchor. Who's stupid ass idea was it to create transgeder people anyways? Talk about cruel."
SuicideWatch,fd1klk2,t3_ejuwkx,1578132548.0,I hate me and I'm ruining my life. It's been a good try. I've made it further than I ever thought possible. But I'm still me and that person is worthless.
