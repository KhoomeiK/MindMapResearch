Dynavap,ff33gr9,t1_ff2xi8z,1579532704.0,Yes! Thank you. I’m planning to build one soon.
Dynavap,ff2xea8,t1_ff2vfp5,1579527660.0,How big was your torch? Can I use the one I use normally for vaping?
Dynavap,ff2v7lz,t3_ercgro,1579525449.0,Looks awesome! What was your method?
CBD,ff10r1x,t1_ff0ymci,1579474079.0,"Yikes, you’re probably right. My tolerance is fairly high so I probably assumed incorrectly. Not even in my wildest dreams would I feel 5-10 mg hahaha"
CBD,ff0uwkg,t1_ff0jb2y,1579472494.0,Yeah 3-4% THC wouldn’t even register for most people. That’s like half a cup of coffee worth of effects. It’s synthetic cannabinoids for sure

CBD,ferkezn,t3_eqfzc0,1579355032.0,Do you ever have sex without first consuming either THC or CBD? It could just be regular erectile dysfunction and THC might help counteract it.
ArtOfRolling,fen54ee,t1_fen3z2v,1579277174.0,Agreed
Tourettes,fen30az,t3_epynkt,1579275840.0,"So I’ve done a lot of personal research on this subject (just smoked a lot lol) and I’ve found that some strains will literally make me so twitchy I can’t stand it, while others calm me down immensely. Leave the sativa/Indica buzzwords at the door they mean nothing. Research terpenes and cannabinoids and figure out which ones are anti-convulsants, muscle relaxants, anti stress and anxiety and the corresponding strains, and you’ll find great relief with marijuana. Leafly is a helpful resource. Having said that, everyone is different and some people will get relief while others won’t at all. Also, stable,  medically grown weed will also be more medicinal than street weed which is usually not very carefully grown. My personal recommendation is Sour Diesel. It’s a muscle relaxant and anti depressant, and helps immensely with chronic pain which I know a lot of us deal with. And, despite high THC content, doesn’t make me very twitchy. Hope this helps and if someone already said all this I apologize!"

hempflowers,felgh1g,t1_felcuf1,1579221609.0,"Limonene is primary for me. Sour Diesel for example is the type of effect I’m looking for except in hemp form. Fuck it maybe I’ll just switch back to smoking Sour D all the time. Really appreciate the suggestion though, I’ll pick up that strain next time I buy hemp."
hempflowers,felgdiq,t1_felfprj,1579221544.0,Yeah.... not gonna do that.
