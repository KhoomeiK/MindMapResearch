EntitledBitch,fff2fsf,t1_fff2c1q,1579873878.0,Hopefully they will. It’s amazing how many people just don’t spay/neuter their animals then let them run loose. It’s horribly irresponsible and cruel
antinatalism,fff11ej,t1_ffenc7f,1579872727.0,Ugh. This thread just convinced me I don’t have to watch the Witcher... thank you. I wouldn’t have been able to take it seriously
EntitledBitch,ffezyar,t1_ffemso0,1579871779.0,So sorry about your doggo... maybe if you contact your local shelter and see if they do any trap neuter release you can cut down that population a little.

toastme,ffc5qwi,t3_esu96l,1579792163.0,"Love your hair and beard, you look like you maintain those very well! My advice to you would be to find things to do that make YOU happy. A hobby, sport, volunteer work... something that makes you feel good and takes you out of that “stuck “ feeling. This can be a way to make friends and meet people, because when others see you passionate and happy, they’ll notice. It’s incredibly genuine."
rant,ffc2cee,t3_eso302,1579789788.0,"I’ve never quite experienced this before, but that’s probably because I’ve never ever used a mic in a multiplayer video game. I wish it could be different and everyone could just keep their nastiness to themselves so everybody can enjoy."
JusticeServed,ffc1hx5,t1_ffby54g,1579789154.0,"This could have ended way worse, too. Sure the cat chased her off but cats are fully capable of completely mauling something double the kid’s size... I was expecting a full on assault but the fall was a bit better of an outcome."

rit,fenuisk,t1_fenu3hp,1579290985.0,"Where do you suggest we take them? Already through our TNR program over the last 5 years we’ve reduced the population of strays and ferals around RIT from over 100 to the mid-20s. Without these shelters, we wouldn’t have been able to make unfixed strays feel comfortable enough for them to be captured, and find any resulting kittens new homes. Unchecked and neglected feral colonies are what kills wildlife on dangerous levels."

They bought him from a zoo because he wouldn’t have gotten along with the other pumas due to his many health issues which contribute to his small size. I agree with you, no one should own wild cats, but I give this one a pass because Messi is a special case"

IncelTears,fd982qc,t1_fd97e0v,1578229706.0,"I totally get it. I’m really androgynous, and I’ve always been upset that I’ve neither been curvy enough to be a woman or strong/tall enough to be a man. Focusing on learning to love yourself is the absolute best way to allow others to love you as well. I took up kickboxing and weight lifting, that’s been going pretty well. Therapy also helps if that’s right for you. 

You’re on the right track, and I wholeheartedly believe in you"

I’m just hung up on the fact that they’d never let you bring a long-term partner around. What happens if/when you do get one, you just disappear off the face of the planet?? You have to exclude your partner from holiday visits? That and everything else just makes me hella uncomfortable."
IncelTears,fd94yew,t1_fd8zek5,1578228492.0,"Then you’re on the right track bud! I wouldn’t consider you an incel at all, just a normal dude looking to self-improve. Keep up the good work!"

PublicFreakout,fcqnz7r,t1_fcpkxbt,1577889334.0,"I agree wholeheartedly. This is the issue with places with rampant stray/feral cats. The poor things live their lives outside to be abused, traumatized, get diseases, starved... and people just write it off as “an asshole cat.” This cat in particular obviously lives it’s life in constant fear. It needs to be taken somewhere where it can feel safer, and maybe socialized. Or, unfortunately, put down."
PublicFreakout,fcqkg2v,t1_fcq1byz,1577887574.0,"Try and associate strangers/you with good things, like food or playtime, helps if your kitty is food motivated. Like, hang around the cat when they’re eating/ give them a part of their meal out of your hand. Have visitors give her treats and play with her using toys. Also, a good cat tree in the main living space is a way to help her feel more confident and like she belongs in the space where all the humans hang out."
