All those millionaires and billionaires would have to do is stop hiring fancy accountants to game the system or buying legislators to change the rules in their favor to begin paying what they actually owe in taxes

And how likely is that?(hint it hasn't happened yet and I doubt it ever will)"
AskReddit,ffeq221,t3_esy81b,1579859788.0,"When I was a kid I was the designated fireworks guy...I bought them by mail from another state(back then practically all fireworks in my state were illegal)

BTW We invited all our neighbors over for beer and steaks to watch our fireworks show on Fourth of July(one year when a family pulled in we were told that about 100 yards away a cop car was sitting off the side of the road watching our display(while illegal unless someone complained they wouldn't interfere and since all our neighbors were watching the show themselves who was going to complain?))...this was 50 years ago and you cannot believe how much or how big your fireworks can get when you spend over $500 each year

And I practiced shooting them off in entertaining ways

I had some very large bottle rockets(with the stick they were around two feet long) that I would light and hold them until they were just about to take off then fling them in the air

Our farm was located just to the side of a T intersection and since the fields around the house were planted with corn which were over six feet high you couldn't see any traffic until it was passing in front of the house

So one day I threw the rocket a fraction of a second too early and it didn't fire til it was on the way back down...not straight down either but at an angle which as it happened to intersect with a passing car driven by an elderly neighbor lady...with her driver's side window completely open

It bounced around in her car then exploded...at least I assume that's what happened because by then I was in the house with my back to the door hyperventilating

About ten seconds later there was a pounding on the door and some of most creative profanity I had ever heard in my young innocent ears by the sweet old lady

I apologized with all my heart but she still finked me out to my parents

Unsurprisingly my parents were less than impressed with my explanation...all involved knew this was a one in a million accident and couldn't be replicated in my lifetime but just to drive the point home I was banned from 'practicing' in any way with fireworks for the rest of the year"

You yourself are an example of what I originally said(if you are telling the truth about being banned) and you say you need further proof?

I never said MLK was alt-right... I said were he alive today the far Left would claim he was(or just not black enough)

You need proof of that?  Shapiro is called a Nazi(despite being Jewish)...Milo is a racist homophobe(despite being a gay man married to a black guy) and countless others

BTW I never voted for Trump last time...I freely admit I will in the next election though

In the beginning he was labeled the Antichrist, the cause of a future WWIII(against Russia no less), and a publicly concerted effort to impeach him(before he had been president for less than a month)

The Left on one day would call him anti-semitic and the next day he was a pawn of Israel(neat trick I have to admit)

He has been ridiculed in some of the most childish of ways daily(I'm looking at you the guys who decided to make an inflatable baby Trump in a diaper and haul it around the world) and as a result of all that your only takeaway is HE is immature in his response to this nonsense?

When millions of voters who previously had voted for Obama(a black man) magically became racists with the pull of a level choosing Trump over the most evil and corrupt female politician the country has ever produced(and the one person he could beat in an election) is it any wonder that few people buy into the latest reason he ought to be impeached?

The Left(and by extension the national media) have completely lost all credibility...at this point Trump could kill on live TV a bus full of Nuns and a huge percentage of Americans would simple think somehow it was yet another false news story concocted by the far Left to discredit Trump

I said early on in his presidency the the Left's strategy of throwing mud willy nilly at him and hoping some of it stuck was a major tactical error and look where we are now...the Dems have been reduced to making up a lame reason to impeach Trump(and there could be some element of truth to their complaint but it no longer matters because of all their previous accusations have been proven false no one believes anything they claim now)
