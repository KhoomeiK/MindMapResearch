childfree,fdcvgau,t3_ekn52h,1578285458.0,"Mental illness is strongly genetic. Even if your sister doesn't have mental health issues, her child could. My best friend's family members have all had serious mental illnesses. She doesn't have any... but it appears both her kids do. I've had severe depression and wouldn't ever want to pass that down."
childfree,fdcv08h,t3_ekjekh,1578285089.0,"I'm glad someone respected and appreciated you as a person when you were a kid. 

I also like older kids better because by then they have formed their own thoughts, opinions, and personality. Little kids and babies hold no appeal to me."
childfree,fdcu6qh,t3_ekb6cq,1578284421.0,Thank you. We do not need to add to the suffering.
childfree,fdcts55,t3_ekm08k,1578284093.0,"Damn, that really sucks. The ""nothing will change"" lie is so prevalent. People who think they won't change are probably not informed enough about parenthood to become parents. And if they need your rent money to support a baby (and can't afford a sitter to go to a party), they can't afford a baby. Anyway, I feel for you. You are right to get out of there. It is a lonely situation, though. I hope you can make friends at school or work."

funny,fdcnslw,t3_eklrp3,1578279516.0,You do not BABYSIT your own child. You parent. Your kid is fully HALF your responsibility.
GenderCritical,fdcfcpw,t3_ekh8zq,1578273519.0,"I'm currently in a university and trust me, this stuff is shoved down every student's throat. Most go along with it because that's what it means to be ""woke"". We have to introduce ourselves at the start of EVERY class--and pretty much at any other gathering at the university--with our pronouns. We're pressured to put them in our email signature. We have gender neutral restrooms. Our assignments include us working with--and affirming--TIMs and their rights to female spaces. It's just everywhere. I used to be very pro-trans and now I'm gender critical. Your daughter may one day peak trans like the rest of us. It's kind of a cult and it's hard to leave a cult, but most do eventually. Just give her time, don't take it personally, and try to have a healthy identity away from her."

Who knows, maybe you'd love her more with kids compared to without, but you might not LIKE each other as much. You definitely wouldn't have as much quality time or sleep or money, and you'd probably get sick more often and be a lot more grumpy and stressed... Sounds like a bad deal to me."

When we were about the same age as you, my sibling and I convinced a family friend to buy mice and a cage for us from a pet store. We brought them home and presented them and our mom was furious! She didn't want to let us keep them but didn't know what to do with them so she was resigned to it.  We bred them which initially made her mad but eventually she let us buy and trade more and we kept breeding them for years. To this day she's still a little still mad at the family friend for buying them without her permission, though, lol."
