Even though opinion polling shows that overall, on specific social issues the majority of people take the progressive position long before the left gets its way? (eg gay marriage, universal healthcare, drug law reform, etc)

Even though the only genuine direct and empowered democracy available to everyday people, unionism, almost always produces organisations that are blatantly left-wing?

I can't disagree with you more about this.

Social change has never been easy - there is always a huge number of loud voices who disagree. We shouldn't let those voices win. We've only made progress where we have stalwartly refused to concede to them.

Climate change is the biggest risk facing humanity, probably ever. We should be extremely honest with people about the risk. We shouldn't shy away from that.

More importantly though, we need to be really clear with people about power. We won't get significant change without everyday people exercising some real, practical power. That means activism, civil disobedience, union action - some proper campaigning.

It's hard to get people moving on social issues, especially in a context where a bunch of clueless dunces want to tell us that it's wrong to force the issue.  Knowing that the entire world is at incredible, immediate risk is a good motivator."

relationship_advice,fgl57ip,t3_ez4jcc,1580882412.0,">Then when I approached her after class she says she is going out with 2 of her friends. I said that's not fair.

Sure it is - she doesn't have any obligation to you.  You've talked to her once.  There's something wrong with your attitude to women and relationships if you think she's acting unfairly here.

>I make her really uncomfortable which was strange since she didn't show any signs of me creeping her out.

Okay but it's really important to understand that she isn't obligated to act a particular way either.  It doesn't sound like she was leading you on.  Some people just don't show discomfort outwardly for a whole range of reasons.  And some men react badly when women are uncomfortable around them - it's fine for women to avoid facing that.

I don't think she was playing mind games - it sounds like she didn't really know how to respond.  That's probably why she said she would decide later - so she could think about what she wants, or think about how to say no without embarrassing herself or hurting your feelings.  Some people are so afraid of saying no to other people that they agree to things they hate just to avoid disappointing anyone.  Maybe she was just trying to get in the right headspace to say what she really meant.

>I do have a reputation for being a total jerk.

How did you get that reputation?

>And maybe suggestions for the future would be appreciated to avoid making girls unconfortable.

I think the most important thing is to be really easygoing about it.  If she's not interested, it's important that she feels that it's 100% up to her and 100% safe and easy to say no without being questioned.  I think telling her that it's unfair to hang out with her friends instead was a mistake.  Even if you were right about it (and I'm certain you were not) she will feel like you don't respect her decisions and won't give her freedom.  Women will (and should) avoid men that make them feel that way.

I also think it's worth rethinking and changing your perspective on what things mean, too.  You'll never know exactly what she was thinking, so why agonise over it?  It seems that you're coming up with some unlikely motivations she might have had, rather than just thinking, ""Well, she wasn't interested in hanging out, and that's what really matters.  I'll honour her request and if she sees me around and sees that I'm a decent bloke maybe she'll change her mind.""

Don't dwell on it, because it will all seem so unimportant in six months anyway.  There's plenty of other women to chat with, and you're clearly a decent enough person to want feedback and have more enjoyable conversations with women.

Just be you, be fun, don't push it, and don't assume there's some magic plan or phrase or approach that will attract women, because there isn't."
