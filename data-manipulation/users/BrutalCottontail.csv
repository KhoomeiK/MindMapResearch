aww,fdgsq4a,t1_fdgqtw1,1578407352.0,Pets arent objects that you go into walmart and pick up. Every person who pays for a dog that looks exactly like someone elses on social media is damning a perfectly good mixed breed dog to die.
aww,fdgqn92,t1_fdgqjah,1578405777.0,Its always easier to come up with a reason to take the lazy route. Growing up is about doing the right thing even if you have to stay out of your bed for 20 minutes

aww,fdglhso,t1_fdgl6xq,1578401338.0,"people who care about animals work to get them spayed and neutered, because they have a problem with thousands of animals needlessly suffering and dying. People who want to exploit animals for money breed them and sell them, adding to the massively oversized dog population."
aww,fdgl0m6,t1_fdgkuk7,1578400876.0,"Intentionally bringing more dogs into a world so overpopulated with dogs that they are mass culled every day is wrong.

Stop using living beings as photo props."
