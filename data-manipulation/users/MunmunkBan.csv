Documentaries,ff75857,t1_ff4g5qv,1579641367.0,Fat doctor - in UK talks about the part removal of intestine changes the leptin/ghrelin hormones and why it can result in lasting weight loss. Surprised that diet and exercise did not experience a remission.  Anecdotally I've known people to say they went into remission after losing a lot of weight.

facepalm,fev02zt,t1_feo3ywu,1579391644.0,So true. Banks will do anything to protect themselves. Nothing to do with protecting the worker. They could at least be honest but since when has that happened at a bank.
LeopardsAteMyFace,feul1sq,t1_fese4zq,1579387563.0,"Wow. I respect your point but probably best to leave off the insults if someone differs. Using that sort of language to argue why your point is correct is not convincing but only to people lacking in self confidence which in turn can make them just follow and not think for themselves.  All you are telling an outsider is that socialism is about bullying people into submission and not to think for themselves. 

My point is based on dominance theory in the animal kingdom in general which is not driven by propoganda.  I do understand theists have a differing opinion as well and don't see humans as part of the animal kingdom and I respect their right to believe that without using slurs. 

I truly hope one day humans can succeed the need to accrue personal wealth more than their neighbour but at this point in human progression it does not appear to be the case. 

Take care."

MGTOW,fegb4sz,t1_feeruai,1579085826.0,"It's some real crazy shit that's for sure. I read it too.  They talk illogically.  They talk about undependence on one hand and then how if a man doesn't buy you dinner on the other hand then he is a loser. 

They talk if hvm and lvm. I.e high and low value male.  They say all women deserve and should hold out for a high value male and they set some lofty definitions of one that would be a minority of males. They don't seem to know that sexes are split like 50/50.  It's an impossible equation they are trying to solve.

cursedcomments,fecyfv2,t1_fecxvr7,1578989802.0,Because it's subjective.  Only each user can judge which one is superior.

WinStupidPrizes,fds18ht,t1_fdrydkc,1578692749.0,30mi is tough for a work commute and if the infrastructure isn't there with wide shoulders it can be unenjoyable if there are cars moving at speed.

WinStupidPrizes,fdrx8gm,t1_fdrukhd,1578691103.0,"I have two cars (one small city) and a large off roader for camping.  The costs are not insignificant. However I choose to ride probably 90% of the time and I take off road bikes camping as well. I also pay third party insurance on my bike.  

 Been riding city roads since I was in 6th grade when my parents let me.

I could video traffic signals during peak hours and the vast majority of cyclists stop. There are people that walk across roads against no walk signals too but the vast majority don't.

When I hear someone bring up bikes running reds I ask them whether they cross against signals. It seems one is more acceptable than the other. 

The thing is, I get the feeling it's more a hatred that bikes in a busy city easily get from a to b a lot faster and don't have to wait and wait and wait burning fuel for nothing. Ebikes are making it even easier for those not as fit to cut through."
WinStupidPrizes,fdpze67,t1_fdoh7yi,1578647236.0,Must admit I rarely see car driver stop at one either.  There is one near my house that is very busy that would definitely make a bucketload for police. People slow right down but only 1 in 50 would come to a dead stop.  The other direction is not that busy. It's just there is a school there.
WinStupidPrizes,fdpz9dt,t1_fdp4erf,1578647054.0,Wow.  Did not know that.  Well the majority of the country can't.  I am very NSW/Vic centric obviously.  They are talking about changing the rules in Vic but only increasing the age from 12. NSW is 16.  Footpaths are probably only ok at walking speed. People back out of driveways not expecting someone doing 30kmh.  People do get booked crossing at a ped crossing down here.  I've known people to get done.

Fraser Island in Australia is an amazing place with the most pure indigenous dingo population.  Tourists think it's cute to feed them but they are wild dogs despite the warnings everywhere.  They have been know to seriously attack or kill young children.

Dingoes that show they are not afraid of humans on the island are then on a watch and it they keep doing it they get euthenized. So feeding the cute doggies could just spell their death.  After the death of a 9yo they did a cull.  All because tourists couldn't help themselves."
