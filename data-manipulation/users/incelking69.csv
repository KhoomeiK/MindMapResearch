KendrickLamar,fezx3en,t1_fezwwim,1579462804.0,"what did drake do that‚Äôs so bad
texting millie bobby brown and having a normal conversation doesn‚Äôt make him a pedophile, shes a celebrity like him and they have things to talk about. not every conversation  between a guy and girl means they wanna fuck
