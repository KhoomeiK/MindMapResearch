videos,fgiqatj,t1_fgijduo,1580828478.0,"My point was that the original comment said that they found it hard to support woman after listening to this audio. There are shitty people everywhere, you shouldn't stop supporting women's rights just because Amber Heard is a crazy person."
videos,fgij6yj,t1_fgihz0j,1580823229.0,Lol do u find it harder to support men when u read of rape and shit done to women? Both genders have shitty people in them. Support both dumbass.

Loooooooool wtf is this"
soccer,fgh1urz,t1_fggsfy9,1580774698.0,"It's the truth. Imagine if he stayed in la Liga or was in the PL. It would have cemented his legacy. Now, if he doesn't win a CL or doesn't get close to the finals it's always gonna be a slight question about his skill."
mildlyinteresting,fggbmdt,t1_fgg8dzy,1580758429.0,"What are they wasting haha. A plate? That’s nothing, not even worth worrying about one bit."
college,fgg7y2s,t3_exdpjb,1580756187.0,"Use that hurt bro. That's what helped me, I felt like shit so it was my motivation the next semester."
AmItheAsshole,fgfyfu6,t1_fgerreu,1580750333.0,"There's a decent chance that in a few years she will realize that what you did was for the best, and that you were only trying to help."
hiphopheads,fgfeio5,t1_fgebmmw,1580736360.0,"Man the problem with the length is that if you're not a Wayne superfine, i'm not about to sit through a huge album to find the songs that I like haha, especially if there are songs I really dont enjoy. It just becomes a chore to listen to."
hiphopheads,fgfe88r,t1_fgeworf,1580736098.0,"I can never hate on not afraid. That song helped me in school when I was getting shit haha, it's always got a place in my heart."
soccer,fgaupyk,t1_fgaki7y,1580655584.0,"Na he's prob the best in the world rn. On current form, he's even better than Messi."
college,fg8358i,t1_fg7yhx2,1580608269.0,Eh there’s a difference between revising a concept that you had previously learned and learning it from scratch. The second is actually harder
college,fg7pdh9,t1_fg7h2in,1580598128.0,"With all respect mate, I think you might not be getting the point of these basic classes. It's to expose you to that kind of thinking, because in your field I bet at some point you will need to do something with physics. When you do, your first thought should be 'yeah I kinda remember this', not 'what the fuck is this' haha."
AskReddit,fg7p1cb,t1_fg7ak1c,1580597890.0,"Haha man I wish I could go back and kick myself for all the shit I put my mom through. But honestly, you should know that around 18-20, the kids usually realize this and then the relationship with their parents becomes even better."
AmItheAsshole,fg6mzi6,t3_ewzu5b,1580572161.0,"Stories like these are so weird, bc realistically both parties should be happy that someone got an upgrade. I wouldn't be pissed if my SO got to fly first class, it is only a couple of hours away from one another anyways it's not the end of the world. 

NTA"
science,fg5wsul,t1_fg5cnng,1580542222.0,"It’s not a mystery in reality, they lay it out pretty clearly why you should know it. Honestly I don’t know how much more clear can they get, and the idea is that when you get to a point where you can understand why it’s important you shouldn’t have to learn the basics of a quadratic formula"
science,fg5bo88,t1_fg56syp,1580523261.0,"Well yeah they will be a mystery unless you pursue a job where they get used. But the pint is that the first time you see them shouldn’t be in college, it should be in high school."
AskReddit,fg4e32e,t1_fg483pz,1580501768.0,"Really, there? Nothing else out of the seven previous movies strained your credibility, but the lasers arching did? What about the noise the ships made in space? The fact that they accelerate at quick speeds. Faster than light travel. Lightsabers. 

But na, lasers arching is where you draw the line lmao"
college,fg3ng8m,t3_evnqrg,1580485601.0,Break it downing smaller parts! I've found that getting started is always the hardest part.
science,fg3na49,t1_fg2rbv2,1580485495.0,Yup. It's used in every single STEM field I can think of.
science,fg3n4z9,t1_fg2mtnj,1580485406.0,"Mate if you dont remember the quadratic formula then that's bc you dont use it in every day life. The point is to expose kids to different types of knowledge and if in college and beyond they need to use it, it's not too unfamiliar. 

Also come on man, you can't remember what it was used for? That's on you bro"
college,fg3bwbe,t3_eu9gt8,1580477372.0,"Mate most probably you are the problem. In the nicest way possible, bc once you realize that you can change!"
gameofthrones,fg3azp9,t3_ewieh0,1580476608.0,"Eh, i don't know. It's not like death is the only way to end a character car, there are other ways."
AskReddit,fg1qpef,t1_fg1msge,1580431820.0,I thought it was funny
AmItheAsshole,fg1j9v5,t3_ew9u6k,1580428114.0,"Hearing people's opinions seem kinda crazy to me. Everywhere I've worked, people with kids *have* been given special privileges, and it's never been a big deal because everybody understands that yeah having a kid can be stressful. It's not the same as having a dog lol. People like Anna ruin a policy designed to help parents. 

NTA"
AmItheAsshole,fg1j0vo,t1_fg17vbu,1580427984.0,"Dude no one is entitled, but it's common decency to allow people with kids to have special exceptions."

But bro be careful about who you reveal this too. Don't let anyone else know."

This is what living with people entails lol. Sometimes people have to get up earlier, it sucks but hey."
AmItheAsshole,fg1ea0s,t1_fg1cts2,1580425556.0,"No, the friend is a moron for even comparing the loss of a child to the death of a dog. It's weird to even bring it up, but seriously OP isn't in the wrong."
AmItheAsshole,fg1e2hj,t1_fg036cn,1580425450.0,"It's not the same mate. Losing a pet shouldn't stick with a person as much as losing a child should, because like everyone else is saying you assume your pet is going to die one day."
soccer,fg1dilm,t1_fg123dg,1580425193.0,"Ehh, I think it's become kinda clear that to contain him you need 2-3 players to swarm him as soon as he touches the ball. It's worked for teams recently bc the rest of Barca for some reason didn't exploit this as much as they used to, and as a result the whole team was playing bad. 

In this case it's probably the defenders who are tired and just want the game to end, so they really are not putting much effort."
teenagers,ffyge32,t1_ffxzfpe,1580345790.0,"Hey I just wanna add, I hated chem in high school but it’s awesome in college. Just food for thought, sometimes it just ‘clicks’ idk"
apple,ffxz3qi,t1_ffx9ar0,1580335269.0,Also why not? Why not push for faster speeds?
soccer,ffwgzub,t1_ffwel72,1580300687.0,"Bro I was playing Fifa yesterday and some motherfucker was passing the ball around in the back for the last 30 minutes of the game. And every time he scored, he  would go to the half line and let the full celebration and replay happen. 

I bet it was Messi."
Music,ffukig3,t1_ffu68kk,1580243879.0,"Haha man I love both, and I definitely don’t care who gets this record. It was just an observation"
Music,ffu12z0,t1_fftvhmw,1580232207.0,"Lol so they don't have the record then? Not hating on them, but if Yellow Submarine was #2 then the record was unbroken."
apple,fftm22a,t1_fftfb56,1580224006.0,Only good looking people have a use for it I guess then
Android,ffpoj2j,t1_ffpk5q1,1580100395.0,"I’m not Reddit mate. 

I’m pretty high rn but I’m sure of this."
Android,ffp7uam,t1_ffou42s,1580088404.0,Bc it's ugly and not nice to use. It felt cheap compared to today's phones

Even these songs, Darkness isn't about him."

hiphopheads,ffinwfs,t1_ffhx4we,1579978387.0,"To add onto what other's are saying, i honestly think he doesn't have much else to say rn. He's literally explored every portion of his life in his music, what's left to say?"
asoiaf,ffilvye,t1_ffhx6ny,1579977003.0,"That’s not a good idea at all haha. I can’t imagine any popular show staying popular if the actors are changed. People tune in to watch characters interact on screen, that requires them to stay consistent look wise."
asoiaf,ffig07o,t1_ffgffvc,1579972978.0,Thank you. People here have weird ideas on how TV shows should be fun haha.
hiphopheads,ffg3jvb,t1_fffxfk5,1579897691.0,Haha I like it if it's kept to one or two songs max on an album-its kinda fun to hear him flex.

Also funnily enough this is the plot for an episode of Modern Family."
college,fffbsas,t1_ffdtrmw,1579880487.0,Haha yeah 100 percent its gonna affect you. I doubt anyone would be cool with a roommate that sleeps though alarms.

Seriously, it's defeniatly not a thing."
college,ffc70w3,t3_entcf9,1579793011.0,"haha mate I'm gonna be honest not having a dryer in your apartment when you're used to having one can be annoying. 

Tbh they dont sound spoiled"
movies,ffc119j,t1_ffbwiip,1579788803.0,"Haha I love both but 2049 for me spoke to me on a deep level. After finishing it I was shook, that had never before happened to me with a movie."
Barca,ffakhnj,t1_ffajzqr,1579737995.0,Fair

Anything to hate season 8 really"
asoiaf,ffa73kv,t3_esh9pa,1579729161.0,I think the idea is that she never really meant to ‘break the wheel’. It’s was always evident that Dant was more of the same:someone who thought they had a birthright to rule over people.
soccer,ffa161z,t1_ff9zmau,1579725802.0,Haha there unfortunately were. In this subreddit in fact. It was weird
soccer,ffa10cr,t1_ff9xfo8,1579725708.0,"You know that it could have easily been 2-0 in the first half? Barca was not in control in the first half, it was only when subs were made that the game settled down. Even then, a last minute winner."
Barca,ffa0rw3,t1_ffa0c4z,1579725570.0,"It's bad overall though, bc then it seems like it's up to the ref's interpretation of what deserves a yellow."
