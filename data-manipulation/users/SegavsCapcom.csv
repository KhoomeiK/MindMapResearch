**This is the continent of Wrydan.** Long before any Midian, Sylvan, or Bespian walked these lands, innumerable and powerful dragons made their homes here. These majestic beasts possessed godlike powers and intellect, but even they fell victim to envy, greed, and lust for power. Thus, a cataclysmic war broke out, killing all but one of the dragons. The last dragon, Brimhir the Wise, used his last breaths to create his successors: the human-like Midians, the elf-like Sylvans, and the animal-like Bespians. These three races settled the ravaged continent, building their own cities, tribes, and cultures.

The dragons may be gone, but their spirits still remain. Along the continent, their lifeforce lingers, and those who can tap into it can use it to produce magic. For Midians, this magic form the backbone of their religions. Sylvans, who by their nature are attuned to these forces, use them to perfect magic arts to the point they are more like utilities and not awe-inspiring powers. Bespians, who are attuned to natural forces, reject all forms of magic as unnatural and perverse.


**A Quick Summary of Nations**

*Arwen* is a republic formed from three kingdoms. The home of the Northern Reformationist Church, they govern themselves via a Grand Council, derived from the ancient practice of townhalls and war councils. Densely populated and ethnically diverse, this land  is viewed as odd and contentious by outsiders.


*Bhella* is a feudal alliance of thanedoms who swear allegiance to a king in Ragnar. They are known traders and sailors, with infamy as raiders. Cold and rocky, villages of the realm are governed by a town council, where all must participate. Cities make more of an effort to appeal to visitors, creating two disparate realms within one country.


*Tordonne* is the oldest power of the continent. A vast empire, it is home to the Imperial Orthodox Church, a flexible army, and many types of peoples. One's worth is measured by their status as a citizen; native Tortors are automatically considered full citizens, with all other groups able to earn honorary citizenship via service and acts.


*Gildra* is a loose alliance of mercantile city-states who banded together as one trading bloc. The lives of a Gildran revolves around their trade and guild, create a strict caste system and huge wealth disparities. The ruling families of each city meet regularly to hammer out laws, trade issues, and foreign policy.


*Thellan* is a feudal kingdom, with various princes/princesses declaring fealty for the Grand Duke of Thell. A cultural powerhouse, each noble jockeys for the Duke's favor via court culture and hiring artists. In theory, their allegiance to the Duke prevents internal struggles, but in practice, it is home to various petty squabbles. It is home to the Southern Amalgamate Church, where pagan practices are mixed with Orthodox structures. 


*The Isles of Helvig* are former Gildran/Thellanese colonies who have won their independence. Prized for their metalworking and mercenaries, they are a highly martial population, and highly suspicious of all outsiders.


*Rodann* is a alliance of two kingdoms: the fertile Corwus and the martial Didas. Didas supplies the military to defend their borders, while Corwus provides the necessary food to help feed the populace. Isolationist and brutal, little is known about the interior, though that does not stop merchant from spreading fantastical and bizarre stories about its' peoples."

**This is the continent of Wrydan.** Long before any Midian, Sylvan, or Bespian walked these lands, innumerable and powerful dragons made their homes here. These majestic beasts possessed godlike powers and intellect, but even they fell victim to envy, greed, and lust for power. Thus, a cataclysmic war broke out, killing all but one of the dragons. The last dragon, Brimhir the Wise, used his last breaths to create his successors: the human-like Midians, the elf-like Sylvans, and the animal-like Bespians. These three races settled the ravaged continent, building their own cities, tribes, and cultures.

The dragons may be gone, but their spirits still remain. Along the continent, their lifeforce lingers, and those who can tap into it can use it to produce magic. For Midians, this magic form the backbone of their religions. Sylvans, who by their nature are attuned to these forces, use them to perfect magic arts to the point they are more like utilities and not awe-inspiring powers. Bespians, who are attuned to natural forces, reject all forms of magic as unnatural and perverse.


**A Quick Summary of Nations**

*Arwen* is a republic formed from three kingdoms. The home of the Northern Reformationist Church, they govern themselves via a Grand Council, derived from the ancient practice of townhalls and war councils. Densely populated and ethnically diverse, this land  is viewed as odd and contentious by outsiders.


*Bhella* is a feudal alliance of thanedoms who swear allegiance to a king in Ragnar. They are known traders and sailors, with infamy as raiders. Cold and rocky, villages of the realm are governed by a town council, where all must participate. Cities make more of an effort to appeal to visitors, creating two disparate realms within one country.


*Tordonne* is the oldest power of the continent. A vast empire, it is home to the Imperial Orthodox Church, a flexible army, and many types of peoples. One's worth is measured by their status as a citizen; native Tortors are automatically considered full citizens, with all other groups able to earn honorary citizenship via service and acts.


*Gildra* is a loose alliance of mercantile city-states who banded together as one trading bloc. The lives of a Gildran revolves around their trade and guild, create a strict caste system and huge wealth disparities. The ruling families of each city meet regularly to hammer out laws, trade issues, and foreign policy.


*Thellan* is a feudal kingdom, with various princes/princesses declaring fealty for the Grand Duke of Thell. A cultural powerhouse, each noble jockeys for the Duke's favor via court culture and hiring artists. In theory, their allegiance to the Duke prevents internal struggles, but in practice, it is home to various petty squabbles. It is home to the Southern Amalgamate Church, where pagan practices are mixed with Orthodox structures. 


*The Isles of Helvig* are former Gildran/Thellanese colonies who have won their independence. Prized for their metalworking and mercenaries, they are a highly martial population, and highly suspicious of all outsiders.


*Rodann* is a alliance of two kingdoms: the fertile Corwus and the martial Didas. Didas supplies the military to defend their borders, while Corwus provides the necessary food to help feed the populace. Isolationist and brutal, little is known about the interior, though that does not stop merchant from spreading fantastical and bizarre stories about its' peoples."
