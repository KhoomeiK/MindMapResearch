I remember how confusing it all was, but I also remember that there was an undercurrent of ""well, the US kind of deserved it for everything they've done around the world"". 

Apart from that, very little was different about our day. I just remember my history teacher 2 days later trying to defend his contrarian theory that it wasn't Muslims, but Serbian nationalists acting in retaliation for Kosovo. The next week, he had already abandoned that theory. One thing that became clear very quickly was that the US government was gonna spin a war out of the event, but I don't think people really anticipated how long the shadow of 9/11 would be, considering we're still living right dab in the middle of it. You can see it when you watch 90s TV, there was a certain easygoing attitude that died when the towers fell."

dndmemes,ffdrzq1,t1_ffdr5sm,1579827473.0,"I like that video for the table, but I think it forgets one important part of alignment in DnD: its ties to the cosmology. Alignment determines where your soul goes when you die, it interacts with spells (less so in 5e) and it's the reason for a bunch of interplanar wars. Mortals are confusing and confused about their alignments and how to live their lives, but outside the material plane, alignment is strict and objective, and it ends up playing a great role in mortal lives (or deaths). When a player tries to justify something as being one alignment because of motivation, I like to think of what a panel of outsiders (one angel, one devil, one demon, one fae, or whatever) might think. And let's not forget, they probably don't care about intentions."

todayilearned,ff4lnrs,t1_ff4ifrr,1579566615.0,"Yeah, I didn't mean to say that Gretzky was bad, he might have been the most insane era-adjusted athlete in the world. I think that one aspect that's changed is that the average performance of the players is now much higher and the spread around that average is much thinner. A player like Crosby, Ovechkin, Kane or McDavid are way better than their peers, but they're not ""40% more points"" better, and similarly, modern 4th liners are still capable hockey players. Goalies were technically inferior in the 80s but their stats are not that terrible compared to each other, because the average forward wasn't that great. Most teams had one good scoring line, another so-so one, and then the other two lines were basically goons or players meant to give the stars a break. 

The 80s were also affected by the expansion of the league in the late 70s, which went from 16 teams in 74 to 21 in 79, adding over 100 players to the league. A lot of those would have been WHA imports, like Gretzky himself, but considering how poorly the WHA teams did in their first years, their player base was probably weaker than the NHL. It's proven that league expansion in all sports leads to a watering down of the talent, as you have to get players who wouldn't have found spots before, and that has the greatest effect on the elite players. That's almost a third of the league being composed of players that wouldn't have found spots 5 years prior. Now maybe some of them were young and would have replaced an inferior player with 16 teams, but now with 21, that inferior player also gets a roster spot. A supremely gifted player like Gretzky playing against a lot of iffy players would do really well, which isn't a knock on him. And finally, the simultaneous start of the dead puck era with the adoption of the butterfly by goalies probably isn't very coincidential."
todayilearned,ff4i6ib,t1_ff4fp46,1579564204.0,"I agree but it also shows how comparatively bad the goalies were, which was a product of the technique of the time. So many replays of goalies falling over trying to make a save."
todayilearned,ff4dgr1,t1_ff4cls6,1579561013.0,"Yeah, everything is better really. Modern defensemen are goal preventing machines, to counter every forward being able to shoot. I remember an 80s player say that at the time, you had maybe 2-3 players on the team who had good shots. Nowadays, you can't shoot, you don't get a spot. Same thing with skating. You get young players stepping into the league with elite level skating. When you see the way modern players use their edges and the way they maneuver, you can really see how it allows for these defensive schemes to come together, and also what they're built to deal with."
todayilearned,ff4b639,t1_ff489qv,1579559527.0,"When you see some of Gretzky's goals, that's really evident. So many videos of him scoring goals by taking a really slow wrister that goes in because the goalie barely reacts and then falls over. That shot would barely qualify as an attempt to get a rebound in today's league. You can also see it with 70s hockey, where you had players like Lafleur carrying the puck 100 feet with barely any defensive coverage and scoring by taking a low snapshot that goes in because the goalie barely moves."
CriticalTheory,ff26eu7,t1_ff12rja,1579495117.0,"I know what you mean. I don't know about religion but I know about martial arts. The thing I'll say is that there are people who know full well how attractive the idea of something authentic that finds its roots far in the past is, and that's what they'll sell you, even if it's not necessarily for money. Even in Asia, modern traditions are often just variants that have come about in the last century or two. I'd just stick with the advice to stay thoughtful, stay critical and to remember that good intentions, yours or someone else's, aren't always a guarantee that you're on the right path. Thanks for the discussion!"
CriticalTheory,ff0i0pg,t1_ff05ew8,1579469066.0,"Honestly, I liked your general attitude towards asking yourself questions on this stuff, but in this case, this one sentence ""I’m not interested in sterilized “western Buddhism” I’m looking for legitimate lineages"" is easily the most Western Buddhist thing someone can say. I think it reveals quite a lot of what could possibly be just under the surface of your relationship to Zen Buddhism. Westerners love the idea of legitimate traditions, which of course leads to arguing about what's legitimate and what isn't and whose tradition is better and more authentic. That goes hand in hand with something you mentioned in your post, a willingness to find a master. It makes you feel like you're part of something important and real, and that you're leaving the West and its traditions behind by going all-out in an Eastern religion, but that itself is a very common mindset for Western converts. That to me signals that at the bottom, it's not just a need for something for personal introspection, but also a need for being part of something that feels authentic, and have others, especially the master, recognize that you're different from other Westerners who just don't get it. The belonging becomes the attraction, over the specific practice."
CriticalTheory,ff00qe0,t1_feyzzld,1579463953.0,"Yes, but there's a strong non-random element to a Westerner finding Zen Buddhism, as opposed to say Sufism. Those Zen temples weren't built at random. The trend of rejecting Christianity and turning to Buddhism specifically is over a century-old in North America, reinforced by immigration patterns from Asia. It also has to be mentioned that interest in Buddhist thought was parallel to a repression of Buddhist immigrant populations in the US, at least until the 60s. And so, Buddhism started getting accepted more thoroughly in part because cool white people were taking part in it. When it was just Asians being Buddhist, the tolerance for it in the US was much more restrained. It also has to be mentioned that the Buddhism that Americans or Europeans express interest for is usually a very specific kind of Buddhism, usually concentrating on the parts that deal with the self, as opposed to the very important social component that Buddhism has for ""native Buddhists"". Getting to pick which parts of a culture or a tradition that you want to interact with is part of the decontextualization that appropriation often comes with.

And so, when I mentioned privilege, it's not just the general privilege of owning a house and having food, but the privilege of choosing a spiritual path that used to come with a great cost to people not too long ago. I think that's part of the responsibility, recognizing that what looks like personal choice is actually structured by historical factors. Just like you didn't choose to be born a Christian, a large part of the ""choice"" of Zen is historically marked. Again, it's not a question of abandoning the practice, that in many ways is just a refusal to deal with the difficulty, it's a question of being conscious of the interwoven character of what you're doing and your perspective on it.

As a last note, I can't find anything on this with a quick search, but it seems convenient to me that the influx of Japanese Buddhist teachers came to the US a decade after WW2. Emphasizing the pacifism of Zen and the spirituality of the Japanese people just 10 years after the brutal fighting across the Pacific seems a bit like cultural rehabilitation, a bit like how Germany had the Goethe Institute to highlight their culture and try to counter-balance the perception of Germans that the war had left. It might not be a planned effort, but it seems convenient."
CriticalTheory,feys90j,t3_eqw1ln,1579449970.0,"I think there's two points to be made:

1. The idea of a Western tradition of anything is itself an appropriating construction. If we talk philosophy, we usually assume that the Greeks created the Western philosophical tradition, but how is it that Western philosophy naturally assumes that the Greeks belong to it? Greek philosophy was appropriated by the Romans, whose empire created the political landscape that led to the modern West. Same with religion. Christianity was founded by a Greek-speaking Jewish follower of a Judean prophet. There is no direct intellectual link to the modern West, except a constant re-appropriation of those traditions and the constant re-assertion that these things are inherently Western.
2. For your specific issue, I think it's important that you don't immediately jump to trying to discredit your friend's opinion. Self-critique is an important part of a spiritual path, and there are surely questions that you have to ask yourself. Why did you feel that you had to go ""elsewhere"" for these ideas? Why zen buddhism in particular, over other traditions? Is the prestige normally associated with Japanese traditions playing into your choice? If you're not orientalizing, are you being influenced by orientalizing perspectives that have shaped the way we see zen in the West? In the end though, those questions have to be answered by and for yourself, and not for your friend. He doesn't get to judge the authenticity of your choices, you do, but that only comes from complete honesty to yourself. That of course includes being conscious of cultural appropriation and the damages it does, as well as the privilege that you have of being able to choose your own path. Having privilege doesn't mean that you can't do something, it just gives you a responsibility of not using privilege for selfish or damaging purposes."
Showerthoughts,fervqs9,t1_fepsr5y,1579358858.0,"I think the question for that is whether history is what the common person knows, or what the historians know."
Showerthoughts,fervarj,t1_fepqf7g,1579358677.0,"If anything, that strengthens the argument. Ancient history was told a certain way for centuries and that changed when we started doing archeology, finding more writings but also more physical evidence. One very big bias when reading ancient accounts is that we're reading things written by educated, and therefore high class, people. If everyone in Rome wrote a book, we'd have a very different understanding of Roman history. In modern history, it's hard to impose a single narrative on any event because we have so much writing. Writing doesn't have to be done by capital-W writers. We just have to look at recent American events like the Vietnam war to see that having compelling propaganda only works for a few years. The evidence is so fresh, the material for a counter-narrative is just right there."

MagicArena,feiurhr,t1_feiqohk,1579147761.0,"Yeah, definitely. Also specifically for FFXIV, the positivity and shallowness of the main subreddit led to the creation of r/FFXIVDiscussion which is supposedly a place to discuss problems with the game, but which is often a place for toxic hardcore players to shit on the rest of the playerbase. Anyway, the lesson really is that a subreddit is generally a poor reflection of how a playerbase feels, either because it's only a portion of it, or because the ""atmosphere"" of the subreddit repels people who feel differently."
MagicArena,fehijy8,t1_fehgu1l,1579117259.0,"It's more about the state of the subreddit than the actual content. When BLU came out, every second post was some angry rant about it. In all cases, it's always player expectations not being met. The problem is that those expectations are often built from things like subreddits which act as echo chambers. People get excited about a new class and then they get a limited class that they can't use for the content that they wanted to use it for. But SE never promised a fully-fleshed out blue mage, people built that expectation up and their criticism that it wasn't what they wanted was based on expectations. 

It's the same with MTGA criticism. People think they can expect a certain amount of content for free or for a certain price, and they get mad when they don't get it. They get answers from people with really low expectations who call them entitled, and they themselves get called fanboys or apologists. 

But in either case, there is no set standard for how much you should be getting out of the game for the money or time you put in. Some people compare it to F2P games like League or Warframe and feel cheated. Others compare it to the paper CCG, which is an expensive hobby, and feel like MTGA is a good way to play Magic without having to drop a few hundred dollars. Expectations are about perspective.

todayilearned,fdk1rm7,t1_fdjfo6v,1578493917.0,"Off the bat, I'm not going to add any credibility to an idea just because it's a community wiki/blog, whatever its project or theme.

For the first point, none of the articles linked make predictions. 2 present the model, one refutes a criticism and the other is an Amazon link to buy the book. As for the blog posts, they're all written by the wiki's creator and a lot of those are mostly about evolution itself. As for the ancestral environment, the vagueness isn't the concept, it's the actual environment. We don't know as much about social structures and psychological habits of early Homo Sapiens, because those leave no trace. We just muster up an idea of tribes, working with basic tools, with a clear sexual division of labour, but those are guesses from observing modern tribal people. And finally, falsification is the capacity for a scientific theory to be proven wrong. Its elements have to be available for testing. So for example, Russell had the thought experiment of the teapot orbiting the Sun. Stating that there's such a thing isn't a scientific theory, because it's based on nothing, but it is falsifiable, because if you had a perfect 360 degree telescope, you could determine if it's there or not. But stating that the brain is like a computer because of the environment in which our ancestors lived is not falsifiable, because we can't test the hypothesis.

As for the second, my issue with the justifying of the status quo isn't the status quo, it's that this theory goes back from this status quo to try to make hypotheses about how it came to be, by references to the life environment of early human beings. This has two effects. First, it tries to make everything that exists grounded in naturalness, and second, it makes everything that can't fit (the Lesswrong story touches on condoms) something of a problem. How could a brain that evolved naturally create something that goes against its own instincts? Or how could it create something that it itself has trouble understanding, like the example of computer programming? Those might seem like hard questions, but only from a certain point of view. If you accept that the brain, or the body, might be optimized for a certain environment, that doesn't preclude that it can also do well in other environments and that the human brain's great strength isn't computational power, but its capacity to change the environment it lives in. The brain itself is the reason that we don't live in the ancestral environment, it's our capacity to plan and project into the future that lets us build things, code software, make factories to make condoms. If the brain was bad at those things, because they weren't needed in the past, then we have to explain why we do them all the time.

That's not what I meant, I meant that Homo Sapiens complex brain, as a condition for having a psychology to evolve, is something that evolved from previous brains in previous species. By the time Homo Sapiens is sentient, its brain structure is already set. If we're trying to determine why the brain works the way it does, it can't be psychologically, and so through evolutionary psychology for example, because the way it works was worked out pre-psychological beings."
todayilearned,fdhq28q,t1_fdhn6wf,1578427913.0,"Well, first off, it makes no predictions, it just confirms existing phenomena by an appeal to an ancestral environment that remains pretty vague. Second, it's often used to state that the status quo is natural or something that we struggle against because it's become denaturalized, like on the whole ""man and woman in a bar"" in the page you linked.
