Meditation,ff409ua,t1_feetddd,1579552732.0,"Nice to hear.

But, have you considered that aging and acquiring experience with life, over the time when you meditated, could also be responsible for you getting better?

That maybe just the belief that meditation would help you, like a placebo, helped you?

That the initial action of fixing your thoughts, is all that was needed?

Just the action of deciding to get better, can make you better - did you know this?

I'm tired of people putting meditation on a pedestal. Like it is the solution.

The solution is fixing ones life at the fundamentals, thus not requiring meditation.

I'm all for it, but the way the West uses it, it's just a band-aid. If we fixed our lives at the fundamental levels.

Realizations do not come to you, they are already there, only uncovered as you clean up the mess that is your mind. Things do not come to you, they are not created out of non-thought.

Meditation is like a workshop, a platform, where you can use tools to change your mind, cept' the tools are NOT meditation, they are conditioning, reinforcement, hypnosis, analysis, the blunt tools we use everyday to work and lve.

Programming a computer becomes hella easy with an IDE.

Meditation is an IDE.

The language that is thought and how it's used is what changes you, and if you use the IDE, you can get somewhere, with other tools.

Meditation does not have a different meaning for all of us. Every word that has been spoke or uttered has been defined and has A fixed meaning. But you go on ahead and all pretend you are philosophers, where meaning is meaningless, and where reality is just a thought.

Are you offended? Ask yourself why.

In 2020, people, when they don't agree with something, they suddenly pretend to be philosophers so they can play the ""it has different meaning for everyone"" card. This is pure and utter BS. We are in society. We defined things a long time ago. Science went beyond hypothesis a long time ago. This is not closed mindedness. It's just that certain words or meanings took their place and you want those words and meanings to occupy the same places instead of agreeing or disagreeing with them."

Practice creating positive thoughts for yourself as regularly as you have negative ones.

If you only practice the negative, the negative is what you will get.

If you consciously choose to have positive thoughts, and repeat that, and form a habit, like meditation, a positive reinforcement of thoughts will happen.

Don't just bask in unchecked negative thoughts, replace them.

Maybe it's more chronic that I believe, but, non the less, do the practice, don't just let it happen.

Everyone is social, people who exhibit anti social behaviors just choose to be unkind and hurtful to others.

The problem isn't that they are being nice or social to you, it's you, that is being a dick and hurtful by pushing them back.

The question is, what's up your butt that you have to hate others being social with you?

Haven't you accepted your own definition of what you are yet?

If you we're okay, then, you would just be quiet most of the time, and interact accordingly when others interact with you, instead, you literally have to be hurtful and hostile with others.

And you ask why do others do such and such? Well it's because being social is a function of life. If you choose to fuckin hate it, then your choosing to be miserable. Sounds okay to you?"

Anti social is a set of behaviors.

We are members of society. If you don't choose to participate with its hella easy way of living, then, you're just wanting to be miserable.
