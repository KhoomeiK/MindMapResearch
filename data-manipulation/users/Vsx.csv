worldnews,fffgoon,t1_fff4jvd,1579883567.0,It's only surprising if you haven't been paying attention for the last 30 years.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffc73xg,t1_ffc3o5o,1579793066.0,"The entire world economy is based on loaning out borrowed money.  There is actually no such thing as ""real"" money.  All money is debt."
SSBM,ffb3i5v,t1_ffayomo,1579750845.0,Real world doesn't work like this.  More money and better lawyers means you can destroy the little guy.  They can dmca every piece of smash content and 1% of creators would have the resources to even try to fight it.
assholedesign,ffa5yud,t1_ff9qgrh,1579728539.0,"I got a gym membership for me and added my wife to it.  I was paying for it with my money from my accounts.  They wouldn't let me cancel her ""portion of the membership"" and I had to have her drive down and sign a thing.  They don't care if they piss you off because they know at that point you're never coming back anyway.  They later sent me to collections for $19 that they never billed me for to begin with."

politics,ff9pljv,t1_ff9k3y9,1579718104.0,Yep.  Cold reality.  Biden polls better because people in those states are simply not progressive.  They don't want free college or single payer healthcare.  They just want a different old white guy than the one that is currently embarrassing us and for everything else to stay mostly the same.
churning,ff9ovze,t1_ff9ojrn,1579717584.0,"It's so common I can't really give a specific example but here's the FCC page explaining: https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/sports-blackouts

It was extremely common when I was a kid to have baseball games blacked out on TV because they didn't sell enough tickets.  I completely stopped watching baseball because of it."
churning,ff9oajb,t1_ff9llif,1579717169.0,"Yep and then they black out local broadcasts of games that don't sell enough tickets and wonder why overall interest in their team is waning.  ""People don't care enough to come to games so lets make sure they can't even watch it on TV and we lose them as a customer entirely.""  What a thought process."

ChoosingBeggars,ff3pt2e,t1_ff3phe6,1579546245.0,"No I'm saying I personally wouldn't be offended.  The words that I'm saying are the words that I wrote.  I am not saying other words that I didn't write.  Hope that clears things up.  I am sorry if me not being easily offended offends you.

I would also not be offended if someone offered to send me a picture of their dick for an iPhone but I would definitely stop associating with that person for reasons previously stated.

Offering to send a pic is not the same thing as sending it unsolicited either btw."
ChoosingBeggars,ff3mprz,t1_ff3m9f7,1579544348.0,I wouldn't be offended but I'm definitely not trying to be friends with someone who would send nudes for a phone.  The amount of drama that person is going to bring to your life is not worth it.
AskReddit,ff3dvjr,t1_ff37gbr,1579539114.0,Realistically people will just have to be productive members of society longer.  The classic retirement age had the average person dying within 2-7 years.  It wasn't like the average person was living 20 years on their social security and/or pension.  If people are living to their late 70s average then we're just going to have to work into our early to mid 70s.
WTF,feyakra,t1_fey5q3r,1579443030.0,Crazy lady university didn't add incoherent swearing to the psycho religious retail worker abuse program until 2018.  I don't think mother fucker is in the service worker abuse curriculum even now.  They really need to modernize.
todayilearned,femvjrq,t1_femuojs,1579270739.0,"Linguistic forensics was actually used to convict the man.  They had hundreds of points of comparison between the Unabomber letters and writings found in Kaczynski's place after they arrested him.  Fitzgerald has repeatedly stated that the analysis of the letters to determine geographic origin, age, etc of their suspect was a major factor in catching and convicting the Unabomber.  I guess you can doubt the man but I can't really fault the producers of the series for building a story that matches first hand accounts of what happened."
todayilearned,femuk0l,t1_femu9rd,1579269990.0,Zodiac is a really good movie with a similar vibe if you haven't already seen it.  It's also on Netflix right now.  I have heard good things about The Alienist as well but I haven't seen it yet myself.
todayilearned,femu77g,t1_femtw15,1579269709.0,"Yeah that's literally what happens in the series too.  They identify all the parts of his writing that are idiosyncratic or region specific and publish all that information asking for people to identify him.  They didn't know who he was but they figured out elements of his personality, some places he attended school and generally where he was from."
todayilearned,femtjco,t1_fems06y,1579269186.0,Manhunt: Unabomber on Netflix is a very good series.  It's right up there with The People vs OJ Simpson IMO.  They go fairly deep into all the new forensics used to ultimately catch Kaczzinski.
leagueoflegends,feabir5,t1_fe94b1c,1578946650.0,I knew I saw this happen to Faker last week already.  He restarted his entire PC which took a couple minutes.  You could see the entire process because he streams from a second PC.
leagueoflegends,fe95nv1,t1_fe958t9,1578934505.0,"I don't understand what you're trying to say here.  You are just describing another example of the problem.  What we're suggesting is that the MMR system shouldn't ""slowly trickle upward"" in the case where someone is on a massive win streak.  It should increase at a much faster rate for these obvious smurfs so they hit their target MMR much faster."
leagueoflegends,fe8tz1f,t1_fe8nfsf,1578930799.0,"The prevailing mindset among streamers and generally people with multiple accounts is that if you ""figure something out"" and all the sudden massively improve you are better off just running a new account than trying to fix your MMR.  That should never be the case."
leagueoflegends,fe8tc6j,t1_fe8ktgo,1578930634.0,If your MMR increased like crazy on 10+ streaks you wouldn't win 21 games in a row because you'd be playing much much better players.  That's the whole point here.  These guys who win 60 in a row should not be playing against silver players.
news,fe4r8vi,t1_fe4clcd,1578862030.0,"""There could be additional attacks against embassies"" is an absolute worthless statement that anyone with a brain has to agree with.  Of course there could be.  It's a region full of terrorist groups.

There could be a bad penalty call in the Superbowl."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdqqedi,t1_fdqk1k3,1578672644.0,"Tons of prominent people supported Hitler including many relatives of world leaders.  George Bush Sr.'s dad (W's grandpa) was a banker that directly worked to finance the Nazis and continued to work financing businesses supporting the Nazi war effort even after the US had entered the war.  That's basically how the Bush family got rich.

Also rich people will no doubt have pictures with other rich people.  Doesn't make them best friends.  Most of the world was cool with Hitler until he started invading other countries including the allied countries that would eventually win WWII."
personalfinance,fdqpe7q,t1_fdqot7r,1578672011.0,"> It's not so simple to say it's always a waste of money

Sure it is.  I'll say it right here.  Your Mustang is a waste of money.  You could buy 50 cars that do the same thing cheaper and that are more reliable.  Props to you for qualifying for a 0% APR loan.  At least you're not paying interest.  If you want to buy yourself a luxury item that's cool.  I have no issue with that.  What I have issue with is people like Killersalad acting like you gotta buy an expensive car saying things like ""With the prices of vehicles these days can the majority of Americans afford to purchase the average price of a vehicle outright?""  Nobody needs a new Mustang.  It literally has nothing you actually need that you couldn't get in a much cheaper car.  

So, in summary, I think it's fine if you want to spend your money on luxuries.  I also waste money on luxury items sometimes.  Pretty much everyone does.  Just don't go around complaining that you're broke and your car is overpriced afterward.  Doesn't seem like you'll do that so obviously I got no problem with you."
personalfinance,fdqn9l6,t1_fdqmmb2,1578670678.0,My point was that you should buy what you can afford not that you should live like you're dirt poor.  I said if you need to get a car loan you should get basically the same car for 20% less money and you extrapolate that to only shopping for literally everything second hand and only purchasing things you need to live.  We're talking about loans.  If you're taking out loans to buy your clothes you should absolutely stop doing that.  It's absolutely fine to have luxuries but you should avoid stealing from your future self to attain them.
personalfinance,fdqmw3j,t1_fdqlrvz,1578670437.0,"Yeah I don't disagree or have issue with any of that.  Doesn't change the fact that you are paying extra for those luxuries and a lot of people are taking out huge loans that do impact their finances.  Part of the reason most people can never afford to buy a vehicle outright is that they are spending unnecessary extra money to have brand new top of the line everything all the time.  That's how you stay broke.  $100 extra on the car, $200-300 on restaurants and takeout, $100 extra monthly for the new iPhone, $100 monthly for Starbucks everyday, etc.  Shit adds up when you live in the mindset that you deserve and need all of these things."
personalfinance,fdqk6c1,t1_fdqizw0,1578668645.0,Also as you have more kids you pay for less things because of state assistance programs and whatnot.  My brother in law has a pretty good job but since he has four kids he pays a fraction of his daycare costs and very low taxes.  If you have a wife and four kids you can make 45k a year and still qualify for food stamps.
personalfinance,fdqjtpp,t1_fdqeqhi,1578668409.0,If you get a dog you should definitely expect problems.  They will be old in 10 years and probably dead in 15.  In those last 5 years they will almost certainly have some problems that if you care to fix them will costs you thousands of dollars total.
personalfinance,fdqjigx,t1_fdqi79r,1578668199.0,The average person overspends massively on their vehicle.  It's a depreciating asset so realistically you should always buy the cheapest one that meets your transportation needs.  Almost no one does that.  Buying a brand new car is literally always a waste of money because you can nearly always buy the same car or a similar car with a few thousand miles for at least 20% less.

news,fdo7fwg,t1_fdo4izr,1578600203.0,The state doesn't care about people.  Abortion is legal so that unwanted babies aren't a drain on the state.  Babies who are born are the responsibility of both parents because that makes them less of a drain on state resources.  None of these laws exist to help the individual.
AskReddit,fdny9xi,t1_fdn2e7m,1578595298.0,The thing is the real world is like this too.  When you work somewhere and you are competent you will be assigned everything difficult while other people skate by doing basically nothing because they suck.  Once it has been established that you aren't a dummy there is no going back no matter how hard you try to seem substandard.
sysadmin,fdgsfze,t1_fdgsail,1578407148.0,This is why satire doesn't work anymore.  The world is already dumb enough to have implemented the stupidest things I can think of.
