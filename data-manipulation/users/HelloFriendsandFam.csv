dogs,fffs0aw,t3_etbs3d,1579890531.0,"My rescue dog was $300, adopted through a registered charity, which isn't unusual where I live.  

Based on her medical needs and the fact that she was already spayed, microchipped, and received all mandatory and recommended vaccines that they couldn't possibly have made a cent of profit off that $300."

antiMLM,ffawxcb,t1_ff9f7um,1579746395.0,I couldn't agree with you more! A household finance course that goes over topics such as creating a budget and filing your taxes would go a long way to setting children up for a successful adulthood.

Also, if you use the Reddit search feature, I believe there's already several examples of wisdom panel vs embark results if you'd like to take a look."

dogs,ff2pfws,t3_eqr9sk,1579517851.0,">EDIT: Spoke to the shelter I adopted him from—they will euthanize him if I return him. The rescues I've looked into don't take aggressive dogs. I don't know what to do but I can't keep him. Please help.  

If you do end up having to return him and the shelter euthanizes him, **you can't let yourself take that personally**. It's very likely the result would have been the same no matter who adopted him, because most people are not equipped to deal with aggression. I'm sorry you're going through this, but you wouldn't be a bad person if you return him.  

The only thing I can think of is looking for trainers in your area who specialize in aggression, explain the situation and ask if they will adopt the dog, but that is a long shot.  

I know of a trainer in my area who took in several dogs from people because the only other option was euthanization. Her house is quite full now."

dogs,fey7pt9,t1_fetjaxd,1579441877.0,You can't wait and see. This is a situation where your dog needs to see a vet **IMMEDIATELY**. I've seen in the comments you stated your dog vomited about 300 ml of blood. Your dog could easily be dead before Monday.
dogs,fey7fo7,t3_eqjtld,1579441755.0,What did you expect people to tell you here? Go back to the vet. Keep going back as many times as it takes until your dog is no longer vomiting blood or you have a diagnosis and a treatment plan and have been told what to expect.
dogs,fey56ol,t3_eqr9sk,1579440937.0,"I think you should consider returning this dog. You need to make the right choice for your mental health and the safety of others around you. Be 100% honest with the shelter about why you are returning him.  

My first dog was also a reactive rescue (although not aggressive, just leash reactive). She would have been a handful for even an experienced dog owner, so she was very overwhelming for me.  

I had to spend thousands on professional board & train to get her reactivity somewhat under control. I would never ever judge someone for returning a reactive or aggressive dog after personally experiencing the financial and emotional impact they can have on your life. Don't let other people guilt-trip you about this. At the end of the day, it's your life, not theirs."
gifs,fey2nvk,t1_fey1dn9,1579439945.0,"They are very beautiful dogs, but not necessarily the best choice for everyone.  

They need very physically active and confident owners who have a lot of time to dedicate toward training them. Here's a good [honest review](https://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/novascotiaducktollingretrievers.html) of the breed."

Edit: also, labrador retrievers are named after Newfoundland and labrador. We just have a lot of cool breeds here."

Please use this experience and apply it to other things that you may still be judging others for. Try to put yourself in their shoes, even when you personally haven't been in their situation."
