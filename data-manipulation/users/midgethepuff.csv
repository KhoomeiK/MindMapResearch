AmItheAsshole,fffticg,t3_etda8m,1579891461.0,"YTA. You’re treating your wife and unborn child way way way too delicately. Your wife is still a human being with hobbies and interests and passions, those things don’t stop once you get pregnant. You had a good idea in baby proofing the house and clearing out the nursery, but don’t you think your wife would have wanted to be a part of picking out the nursery furniture and arranging it how you both want? 

On a different note, why the hell didn’t you discuss getting rid of your wife’s bees? It’s not even that dangerous of a hobby. If it’s honeybees, they are not aggressive. They are calm bees who don’t normally sting. Truthfully you need to go to therapy and figure out why you would do some of these things without talking to your wife first. I can’t imagine she wants to have a child with you after the stunts you’ve pulled. Grow up."

aww,ff6u92a,t1_ff6sw2m,1579634999.0,"There are. For example I have a dwarf puffer fish which primarily eats live snails. I can’t speak for other species, but the issue with pea puffer is they hunt for fun when they’re not hungry. So you could have 100 snails in there, and they’d kill/eat them within a couple days. So you have to keep a separate tank/bowl for breeding snails, and only put a couple snails in the pea puffer tank at a time. The other issue is some fish aren’t good at eating the entire snail and will leave some of it in the shell, which causes issues if it isn’t cleaned up and starts to decay. 
I cant say that I know of any fish that eat snail egg clutches in particular, but I’m sure they do exist. I just know many people tend to not go that route, as it’s common to introduce snails to the tank after you already have your fish picked out. You then also run into issues of can the fish you want fit in your tank, is it compatible with the environment you’re creating, will it be friendly with the other fish, etc."
aww,ff6rodo,t1_ff6q59s,1579633464.0,"You can, but it’s almost impossible to see all the babies once they hatch. They lay clutches of eggs that can have anywhere between (in my experience) 10-20 snails each. When they hatch they’re minuscule and you won’t be able to see them. You can get an assassin snail, which is basically a snail that eats other snails, but besides that you’ll have a hard time getting them all out by hand."
