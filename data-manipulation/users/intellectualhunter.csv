The position they were offering me was less than what I wanted (or deserved) but I ended up taking it anyway bc I felt that I had to. Hindsight is 20/20."
offmychest,ff7rsgo,t3_eru1na,1579656795.0,I wonder how many people who are dealing with this are POC like me? I'm trying to figure out if it's worse for POC or if it's about the same. Also wondering about the age of the people who posted. I'm 36/F.

Plus, you'd have access to the train which can get you to Boston (beaches), Vermont (hiking), Philly (art, music, etc), and D.C. Granted, no diving but you'd have your days filled in NYC alone. Good luck!"
offmychest,ff6opb2,t1_ff6k2pp,1579631690.0,"I actually talked to my therapist last night and she made some great suggestions but I woke up feeling so blue and not sure how to proceed. He and I have great communication and any time I have brought something up, he has been extremely receptive. I know part of it is the fact that I fear dishonesty/being in a relationship that is not genuine/being with someone who isn't in it unconditionally."
offmychest,ff6jzwz,t3_er8boj,1579628832.0,"I need this so badly. I'm in a great relationship, especially after my last one, which sounds like what you had, but sometimes it's hard to see that because some shit that went down during our first 6 months related to his ex. Despite that, he's worked hard to do things to change for himself and he makes sure he tells me that he loves me and is proud of me. Reading your post has been an affirmation. Thanks!"
offmychest,ff6jpmd,t3_erwn98,1579628657.0,"I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles. Finding a job is so fucking hard and going out for something you want so badly is harder still. Until you hear from them, try not to assume they are or aren't going to say no. I once had an interview where I ended up yelling at the HR person and got hired anyway. Were either of our actions our best? No. We definitely both fucked up a bit. But we fucking felt that way so I think it's completely valid. Best of luck to you!"
offmychest,ff6goks,t1_ff6c1gi,1579626806.0,"100% agree. Last fall, my boss told me that she and some other co-workers thought I was being ""aloof"" but it was not related to the quality of my work. I had to step back and think about why and realized that it's because I started increasing work-life boundaries and had taken 4 weeks of vacation over a period of 3 months. It felt like such a stab in the back because she had always been supportive of me, making sure I was taking care of myself. She even had the audacity to say that she was concerned because, ""you know, we're a family here."" Such a crock of shit. I've learned my lesson."
