skyrimmods,fdzgi6e,t3_enexvu,1578789982.0,"My last two playthroughs were vagrants and vagabonds. It is difficult with vanilla, simply because you have no living expenses. Some kind of needs mod is in order so that you feel the desperation to steal. But it sounds like that's not what you're really after.

Beyond that, Unbound and Reputation help you to feel a little less special. The timeline is way too fast to become harbinger/thane/archmage, but there are a number of mods to address this. Or you can avoid these quests altogether and play to your character.

I'm not sure what mod would make you happy, since most of the mods that make a good playthrough for an outcast, you call ""unnecessary hassles."" That is what poverty and oppression is all about."

No matter how you supply the energy, there has to be a lot of it to make a car go any appreciable distance, so any car will become a danger if it is catastrophically damaged. My advice is to avoid getting into bad crashes, and if your car catches fire, don't stand next to it."

ChemicalEngineering,fcll281,t3_ehtu0q,1577750282.0,"Companies tend to have a list of schools they will actively recruit from. It's a lot easier to get a job with a company that is recruiting from your school. So, you'll want to go to a school that has a lot of recruiters from the industry you are interested in.

The top ten or fifteen schools, like MIT and Georgia Tech, show up on a lot of lists. Beyond that, ranking is less important than things like location, specialization, and past hires. Boston and UC schools tend to be good for pharma and biochem, Texas is great for oil and gas, et cetera.

Poke around each candidate school's website and try to dig up a list of companies that attend their career or co-op fair, this is the best way to find out what your first job prospects will be like."
