news,ffl5ae6,t1_ffjg0qc,1580035051.0,The only way justice is served is when those cops and supervisors are dead with all their assets transferred to the victims.
news,ffja966,t3_ettpsp,1579994074.0,People are fucking stupid. Sadly this is the only way lazy idiots learn valuable lessons.
news,ffj98pe,t3_etq7yr,1579993434.0,She probably did the world a favor. All cops are scum no sympathy for state gang bangers.
news,ffj8w5i,t3_ettpbx,1579993219.0,That pig just had to chase a black guy all over and finally got him in his sights he was not trying to let him survive and be given jail time. It was a fucking knife they have guns and he’s sitting in a car. The fact people think it’s okay to just unload on a dude without even trying to de-escalate the situation is part of the problem in pre nazi america. The same mental gymnastics those pigs use when shooting children in homes or killing unarmed citizens for being “suspicious”. If it was a white dude with a knife there’d be a standoff and he’d have to run at the cops full tilt to be shot.
politics,ffj6sul,t3_ettzn0,1579991835.0,Sorry let me stop working for the regime to steal over 1/4 of what I make so I can sit in front of a tv to watch a fat orange fuck be called out for all the shit he’s been known to do. I say we kill him and all the other corrupt fucks. Common fucking sense. Let the citizens be the jury on this shit and then I’ll actually expect a just outcome.
worldnews,ffi65mr,t3_eth30g,1579966123.0,Purging our regime with public executions is the only way to come out of this shitty regime with some shred of dignity as a country.

towerclimbers,ffftmk5,t1_fff8um6,1579891533.0,"Duluth alaskan hard gear thermal top with thumb holes, face mask and hood. I use this because it’s all in one and doesn’t bother my beard much."
towerclimbers,ffftb84,t1_ffekm7e,1579891339.0,It is not. The latch also likes to get stuck.
politics,ffbuej8,t3_esjteo,1579783092.0,The American people allowed this to happen. The answer to this is terminating those people’s jobs and taking ALL of their assets and putting it back into the government. They can be homeless and start over. The people have the ability to cut out the cancer in our government that’s why we have guns.
politics,ff71pdk,t3_ervr53,1579639372.0,Better yet. Buy an island. Make sure there is BARE necessities there. Ship off those chomos and thieves to live off that island until death. Or even better kill all of them move all assets to the government and stop taxing the poor so much. Simple problems have the simplest solutions. No one on the planet would miss those people.
