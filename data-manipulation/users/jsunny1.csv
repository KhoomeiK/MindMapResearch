Harley,ffgjl6n,t3_ete68l,1579907723.0,Beautiful! Also I really like those saddlebags. Any chance they're new? Where might I find some like them?
Harley,ff2mjag,t1_felvrgl,1579513368.0,Cool! Thank you.
relationships,ff2lncn,t1_ff25z4r,1579511999.0,"So agree!! In fact I think you should actually tell him these things, then ask him how that would make him feel.

Also, did you tell him those comments hurt you badly? That that was a really douche move?"

dating,feislqp,t1_fegui3v,1579146147.0,"Good points; I would also add (like someone below did) that you'll need to take some time to get to know a new person. I'm thinking that in that very short period of time, it only *seemed like* he was perfect for you. 

I fully believe that if he really was perfect for you, it would have worked out. 

Know. Your. Worth. Don't believe for a second that it had anything to do with who you are as a person, because there wasn't time for him to really know you either. So no blaming yourself. 

u/harryhoudini66 had some really thoughtful, well-written, caring, and important advice. Take it to heart, be patient and loving with yourself, and learn to give space and be a bit ambiguous yourself. It may feel as if you're playing games, but it really isn't. People have different styles of dating, getting to know someone, and of loving other people. 

Be encouraged, and get back out there soon. ;-)"

For a day, 3 days, a week. Stop doing all the things you do to maintain the house and the car. Let him notice what happens when it goes all to hell. I'm guessing based on what you've said, it won't take him long to notice. You'll obviously have to live with a mess which may also drive you nuts, but it should definitely spark some conversation."
