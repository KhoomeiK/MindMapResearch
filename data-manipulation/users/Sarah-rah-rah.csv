It's no coincidence that people get the flu after flying. Several hours in a metal tube with recycled air, aerosolized particles you exhale or cough out carry your virus throughout the plane. 

This sounds dire, but coronaviruses are only fatal to the old and the immunocompromised. The WHO estimates that the case fatality ratio of SARS ranges from 0% to 50% depending on the age group affected: less than 1% in persons aged 24 years or younger; 6% in persons aged 25 to 44 years; 15% in persons aged 45 to 64 years; and greater than 50% in persons aged 65 years and older.

Wearing a mask outdoors does nothing. Masks only protect you against aerosolized particles in closed quarters. 

I'm sorry for sounding alarmist, but please try to quarantine yourself and your team for the next 2-14 days after you shot this.

I see the point the story is trying to make, but the reality is, poverty does not make people happy. No fisherman spends 4 hours catching fish and is free to enjoy the rest of his day. People who live in poverty are one unexpected expense from destitution.Their kids often have no choice to work from an early age and have no prospects to attend college. Another thing no one mentions is how boring poverty can be... you either do repetitive work all day, or you're unemployed and do nothing. No wonder the protagonist gets drunk every night. Even those who live paycheck to paycheck are one unexpected expense from not being able to pay bills. Hand to mouth is a terrible and stressful way to live. 

The moral of the story here is ""upward mobility is bad, simple life is good"", when real life is more ""both poverty and unchecked ambition are bad"".
