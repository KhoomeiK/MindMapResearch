nottheonion,ffesk27,t1_ffequaf,1579863488.0,People always bring this up in posts about conservatives whining about socialism because so many people have no clue what socialism is. They just go with the vague explanation that some jerk on Fox News did during their own ELI5 broadcasting.
mildlyinteresting,fferszm,t1_ffelay6,1579862398.0,Buying avocados anywhere north of the mason dixon line in the winter is depressing.
aww,ffeqjdv,t1_ffekdpa,1579860515.0,The guy on the right is holding a bull whip that they use to beat the animals with. And he feeds the elephant twice.

pics,feggpkf,t1_fegfp09,1579092188.0,I don't think I would personally do it but I could see how someone might find it cathartic to spread her memory.

funny,fe33uzc,t1_fe2zui5,1578845646.0,"I actually don't mind the JJ Abrams movies, but I couldn't get into Discovery. A part of that is because The Orville started around the same time, and was clearly a better Star Trek from the start."
SuperMorbidlyObese,fe2vfll,t3_enfqyk,1578843323.0,"I've lost 190lbs and that's been the secret for me. I've had days and even weeks when I ate like crap, but I never let that be an excuse to give up. Keep tracking your food no matter what you've eaten (and be honest) so you don't lose sight of the fact that you have to step down the junk food. Keep weighing yourself once a week or month so you can see if you're doing well or need to change something. And *never* beat yourself up. That will just drive you back to food."
SuperMorbidlyObese,fe2m4wm,t3_emfeaw,1578840371.0,"I am 20lbs away from being at a normal BMI, but I know I'll need to keep losing beyond that going by the current state of my body. I arbitrary picked a goal weight about 18 lbs lower than the highest BMI that is considered healthy at my height, but I don't know if that's actually a good weight for me. I've never been this skinny as an adult. I guess I'll find out when I get there."
