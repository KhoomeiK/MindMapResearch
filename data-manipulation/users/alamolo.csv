It feels like my chest is lagging, no other picture available."

I change my calories if my weight trend is wrong after 2 weeks. 
If your strength has not increased in months - you are stalling and time to reflect."
wholesomememes,fcwvecz,t1_fcwo39u,1578039216.0,"Good for you. Hope you didnt lose your mind. I went for 2.5lbs/week for a month and felt miserable.

This obviously depends on your bodyfat, weight etc how. Obese people can lose weight super fast."
wholesomememes,fcw7uyo,t1_fcw6zxr,1578019152.0,"You are totally right.

It should be more like one big SMART which contains many smaller SMARTS. 

Divide your first goal into so small pieces you possibly can, and then study if you can make even smaller tasks.

This is one of the first things that is taught in engineering and comp sci / programming. It can and should be used in everyday life too."
wholesomememes,fcw3jez,t1_fcw1ks4,1578016319.0,"10 lbs at the end of March.

That is 12 weeks.

Need to lose average 0.88 something lbs/week

This requires about 400 - 500 kcal deficit day (?)

S: eat at 500 kcal deficit every day
M: Measure your calories
A: Stndard calorie deficit, possible
R: you can do it
T: Continue until the end of march.

For many thia might be too specific, but ""I need to lose 10lbs by this time"" does not go well when asked how. Usually the answer is ""I just eat healthier and exercise""."
