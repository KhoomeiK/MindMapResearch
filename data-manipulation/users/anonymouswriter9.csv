Her and her brother also weren't allowed to mention their dad to her boyfriend. Coming from a relatively normal family, hearing about her childhood is really jarring"

Well into the night we were all pretty plastered and decided it was a good idea to go play at the park around the corner from my house. We then saw the see-saw. I get on one side (I'm a pretty small woman) and my friend (this big ass buff dude) hops on the other side and proceeds to launch me upward. I panicked and locked my legs around the seat so instead of being thrown off, I fall forward at full speed breaking my nose and giving me two black eyes."
