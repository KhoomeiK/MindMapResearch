offmychest,fefz7tt,t1_fefxvxu,1579070290.0,"Thank you for the kind words. But it’s so frustrating when it happens repeatedly. And it doesn’t help that I receive contradictory pieces of advice towards building relationships. Some say to hold back my feelings and create space for interest; other say to be true to myself and do whatever that feels right to me. I acknowledge that in theory, the former works like a charm, but I’m just unable to adopt it. The latter also works in theory, but i haven’t heard any success story yet."
