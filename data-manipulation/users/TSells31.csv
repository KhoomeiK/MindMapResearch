In case the midsummer sweat bath sex with the belly farts isn’t self explanatory enough, one must begin the sex in midsummer. A hot environment is a must. One must begin to perspire heavily, particularly in the belly region. As must ones partner. One must then proceed to do the sex belly to belly. Random, LOUD armpit farts shall hopefully begin to regularly permeate from the Region of the Joint Bellies. Plus sized ta-tas may complicate your efforts."

If the author comes across as a dumb fuck in sentence 1, you’ve got a visual buffer before you lay eyes upon that which is sentence 2. 

Anything to save a few brain cells I guess."
DoesAnybodyElse,fdk8u0u,t3_elgkmg,1578498696.0,"Improper paragraphing isn’t typically enough to turn me away on its own, but the many other writing habits that are much more prevalent amongst block-writers can quickly add up enough lol. 

I definitely agree with your sentiment though, it is a headache to read. Like, I don’t even care if people ACTUALLY know how to form a proper paragraph. If these block-writers just went thru their block of text and indented every 5ish sentences, even without regard for context or grouping, itd be infinitely better. A little jarring, maybe, but beats the hell out of the alternative. 

Best option, however? Opening statement. A few supporting sentences. Closing sentence, reiterating the opening statement. It’s really quite simple (although not always very applicable in short-form social media contexts)."
