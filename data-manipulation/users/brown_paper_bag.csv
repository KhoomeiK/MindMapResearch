Fun fact: the only mandatory fields for a listing were address, legal description, sellers names, sale price, contract dates, agent info, and the very basic freehold vs condo, building type (detached, townhouse, apartment), and utility/services/structural/health (gas vs electric, forced air vs baseboard heaters, UFFI, elevator, basement).

facepalm,ffmnj9z,t1_ffmjh6g,1580056958.0,"I think Americans believe our gun laws are worse than they are. I was talking to my 2nd amendment concealed carry colleague in the US about his thoughts on setting up a standard education and licensing program that would teach would-be gun owners proper firearm safety, maintenance, and storage followed by a test to confirm understanding of the material over a weekend along with a standard background check.  He said that sounded really reasonable and he would support legislation around it provided there were a few more fleshed out details. I told him that's pretty much what's required for a license in Canada and he was surprised. 

Yes, we have strict laws about safe firearm storage and transportation in that we expect firearms to be properly stored away from ammunition in a locked case or cabinet when not in use and when transporting restricted firearms specifically, that you have the proper legal paperwork in place. There's also only a couple of private citizens in Canada allowed to conceal carry so that's probably the most restrictive gun law we have: there has to be a very good reason you need to carry a concealed firearm with you in public on the daily. 

I think we can do more to make our gun laws make sense for gun owners - there's lots of stupidity that gets tossed around when gun violence happens but at the end of the day, maybe 1 gun out of 100 used in committing a crime was legally registered and it's stolen anyway. Until people move away from emotionally reacting to what is sadly mostly gang-related gun violence with demands for gun reforms (because our laws are pretty darn reasonable and could be even more reasonable for gun owners) and focus on actually improving our communities so that these gangs have no where to thrive, we'll probably keep having this back and forth.

canada,ffmiqtn,t1_ffmfscf,1580055318.0,"The professional that is responsible for the misrepresentation - the listing agent - was held accountable by the licensing board. I can't speak to best practices in BC but in Ontario, buyers agents aren't going to and don't pull municipal property records for homes their clients are putting in offers for as a standard practice. I don't see how her agent failed to represent her in a standard manner as the article only says this woman thinks her agent should have done something. Speaking of hiring a lawyer, hers should have caught this as well but I'm guessing she didn't consult a lawyer before entering a binding, non-conditional legal agreement to purchase a property worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

You are giving realtors way too much credit and prestige. They are self-organized and governed and created their own designation to add credibility to what they do. It's like setting up a professional board to license and govern dog walkers that's created and managed by dog walkers. Seriously. There are no special skills or knowledge required to be an agent. Maybe 10% of the profession is actually worth working with because they actually add value. The remaining 90% may as well be MLM #bossbabes because that's literally the level of skill required. They are an unnecessary middleman that we've been deluded into thinking we still need with the advent of the internet.

No property is worth accepting something that looks pretty on the outside without understanding what the guts look like. Period.

UpliftingNews,ffm7her,t1_ffkkoah,1580049743.0,"The pro-life and pro-choice crowds aren't ever arguing the same fundamental point and it's why it's a pointless debate. Pro-choice is purposefully ignorant to circumstances, whether or not one considers a fetus to be a clump of cells or an instant human upon conception. That's a good thing because at the end of the day, their stance is simply about affording women the choice to determine what happens with their body and their life.

The pro-life crowd are arguing purely from the standpoint that life begins at conception and anything other than trying to carry to fetus to term is murder. Period. There's no room for nuance or circumstances like you can get with vegetarianism or veganism (eg ethical vs dietary). The global medical community can't declare anything beyond the earliest possible gestation period which must occur before our medical technologies can intervene as to what truly constitutes the definition of when a fetus becomes a human. 

And that really is the argument that the pro-life crowd is making: it doesn't matter that a fetus can't survive on its own before a certain point or that it's just a clump of cells because once conceived, it's a human person. Until we can convince them otherwise, the pro-life/pro-choice debate will rage on."

She also claims she paid commission but that comes from the sellers and is her assumed calculation based on the price she purchased the home and whatever the seller and sellers agent agreed to. 

This article also neglects to mention how this woman found out the age of her home and the foundation problem. I'm surprised she's not going after her lawyer unless that's who found the discrepancy Between the listing information and the official records.

Some of the issues in these communities across Canada is that some of the women and girls are known to 'take off'. There is a different culture on reserves and in those towns where teens leave on Friday and show up back home Monday after school having spent the weekend hanging out with friends and possibly traveling to the city. When these girls become adults, it's not unusual for them to travel - via hitchhiking, bus, whatever - back and forth between home and post-secondary or a job in the city. 

Sometimes women and girls who do not fall under these behaviours get lumped in by authorities instead of understanding that when these women and girls are being reported missing it's because it's unusual or out of character by the time the police hear about it.

The easiest place to start cleaning out may be the fridge/freezer/pantry as there is likely little emotional ties to food items and you really don't want to leave that stuff sitting. Good, unopened non-perishables can be donated or brought home. Dump the rest. Yes, even the spices. (I made the mistake of holding on to those.) Next, go through the alcohol if there is any. Dump open bottles and decanters and either open and dump or rehome unopened bottles. 

Next up is bathroom cupboards and cabinets. Check with your local agencies to see how to properly dispose of prescriptions (do not flush or pour anything down the drains). Go through all bathroom consumables (shampoo, soaps, toothpaste) and set aside good, unopened prodicts for donation or home and toss the rest. Do not include linens, fragrances, makeup or jewelry in this part unless you feel up to it; your goal is to get rid of perishable items.

Moving forward, everything should go into piles/groups: keep per the directions of the will, keep to bring home/distribute to their friends who may like a small special item of sentimental value, donate, and toss. You can add more but these categories helped me. 

From there, you can go a few ways: rip that bandaid off and jump into the hard parts, typically clothing, jewelry, photos, and long time/favourite hobby/collectible items; slowly wade in and go through cookware or the exercise equipment or the boxes of old electronics (check if your area has a recycling program for them) or something mundane and boring that lacks emotional attachment but requires little mental computing (aka leave the paperwork - your brain has and is dealing with tons of other details and you don't need to spend energy reading through 50 years of phone bills; or you could make up your own way - I'm just sharing what I wish I'd done or did do and found helpful.

I had a public health nurse jab me with a vaccination needle very roughly and left it hanging there in my arm a few seconds while she got the bandage ready. I was 10, it was in our public school gym, and several other kids in my class got the same treatment so I know I wasn't making it up.

CasualConversation,feevjcb,t3_eory00,1579042126.0,"I've found myself being more vulnerable in some ways. I think you're right that part of it is age. I think part of it is experience. In my case, when my father died things changed. I viewed the world differently. Things that I thought mattered didn't and I spent a few years discombobulated from all that. 

But now I've let that emotional guard down. The scariest is still being vulnerable with myself but I've been working on being kinder, in my words, thoughts, and actions, myself included, and I think that self-compassion I started giving myself allowed me to quiet some of those negatives thoughts that would have stopped me from exposing those parts. If that makes any sense."
