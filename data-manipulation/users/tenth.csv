TheFirstLaw,ffc6371,t1_ffauobi,1579792395.0,"Yeh, OP's post is a lot like like saying ""Damn, the first 100 pages of this book at tough, so I'm just gonna have you start in the middle of the book instead because it's more fun there."""
StrangerThings,ffagybl,t1_ffactkb,1579735498.0,It was free. And was just meant to be a fun promotion. Stfu.
Parahumans,ff55pqd,t1_fewkkr2,1579580974.0,It seemed to imply he sent the message to get around/work to defeat Contessa in the previous interlude chapter.
Parahumans,ff55o45,t1_ff1s5x7,1579580938.0,This makes the most sense. She is an extreme blind spot for Contessa too.
AskReddit,ff4tlwf,t1_ff3tmmh,1579572143.0,I am envious of your pay.
AskReddit,ff4t7dl,t3_eretfd,1579571867.0,Smoke. Get fat. Drink too often. Work a 9-5. Rarely use my creativity.
AskReddit,ff4t3wc,t1_ff4s9xl,1579571799.0,Any one night stand is.
AskReddit,ff4serb,t1_ff40zio,1579571316.0,That is absolutely not what makes most people rich.

Louisville,ff3vd1v,t1_ff3rlgp,1579549667.0,"A great shrug to admitting you're a bootlicker and support the oppressor. Shitty, Nicole."
Louisville,ff3u9bj,t3_epmmsd,1579548980.0,"Honestly, Germantown and the Highlands is where most people in the surrounding areas go to eat and drink. 

So, pretty well anywhere in the area."
Louisville,ff3tvlz,t3_epsv8j,1579548743.0,It is literally just plain chicken. It's nice that it's cooked in a special way but it is REGULAR ASS CHICKEN.
Louisville,ff3ruvs,t1_ff340yq,1579547499.0,Someone didn't go to college.
Louisville,ff3rkvk,t1_ff3ol5a,1579547330.0,"Jeeeezus, that is some genuine ""support the oppressor"" bullshit."
Louisville,ff3rgbe,t1_ff3pmg8,1579547252.0,It'd be best not to have all your internet handles be the same. I feel a little embarrassed knowing you now that I know you support excessive police force.
books,ff3pleo,t1_ff359ps,1579546116.0,Agreed. I think all book series and film series should be done in chronological order.
movies,ff31coq,t1_ff22egr,1579531068.0,That's correct. And a small version of the monster shows up at the end.
TrueReddit,ff317yd,t1_ff22ju5,1579530964.0,That's not what trolling means. I just didn't like how you are trying to control discussion. People are free to read content and draw their own conclusions without your insistence of repeatedly steering them to your conclusions.
TinyTits,ff21j4c,t3_er22ug,1579491295.0,I don't see how that would make a difference in the amount of fun you're able to have. But wtfever.
TrueReddit,ff21du9,t1_ff1xt4x,1579491185.0,I didn't read the article and didn't claim to. I'm just in the comments watching you repeatedly lose your shit about anyone tying this to patriarchy in their individual comments and discussion.
movies,ff2151i,t1_ff1yn01,1579491007.0,I don't think you watched the whole film.
TrueReddit,ff1wxa5,t1_ff1ua6c,1579488055.0,You only want people to have discussions about this article in the framework that you think best: got it.
todayilearned,feiq3zw,t1_feil5xi,1579144411.0,I would never tell your father either.
stopdrinking,feig5w1,t3_ep71sh,1579137759.0,"Another one of these unoriginal, really spiteful and negative posts. Dope."
Parahumans,fegnd3z,t1_fefz5dw,1579097918.0,I hope so. I wanna see everyone's shard tbh.
Parahumans,feft8co,t3_eox8eg,1579064488.0,It just clicked for me that the reason it's a different room-guardian is because it's a different person's night.
Parahumans,fefknrn,t1_fdlswdc,1579058349.0,"Yeh, I'd be curious to hear that too."
AnimalsBeingBros,feeq57o,t1_feceqd7,1579038860.0,I'm sure a lot of really shitty pet owners feel the same way.
AskReddit,feeq3nr,t1_fec35wv,1579038834.0,"Well, I feel you've at least gotten the most important part right. I disagree with you about the rest, but honestly just being polite and kind to others is the only real litmus test of not being an asshole."
science,feeprn8,t1_feepij3,1579038644.0,"Anecdotally I can guarantee it. I've seen too many people, including myself, try something new bcs they're already drunk and uninhibited."
AskReddit,fec28bp,t1_febzw5h,1578965586.0,They are existing in a world that has already established a lot of values for each gender. So they are still responding to that already-in-place system. If the system goes out the window then no one would need any of the labels anymore.
AskReddit,fec21qf,t1_febzvk7,1578965499.0,"I stopped listening to you when you said their birth sex is their ""correct"" sex."
AskReddit,fec1qop,t1_fec06mz,1578965384.0,"I have totally seen people flip shit for being identified as a different religion, political party, etc.

It is pretty ignorant to make the base of your argument ""people don't care about labels"". They clearly do. It's clearly a (largely made up) social currency."
AnimalsBeingBros,fec0x6t,t1_feafa3a,1578965016.0,They require a lot of special care.
SweatyGirls,fe6nlt9,t3_elzbrd,1578897174.0,I NEED some high quality stills from her post sex with Geralt. I noticed she has drops of sweat all over her lovely face as they spoke.

todayilearned,fdnyigk,t1_fdnool7,1578595436.0,"MOST cults follow some leader who has passed. Sometimes their kids take up the lead, sometimes those close to them."
todayilearned,fdnyfv3,t1_fdnool7,1578595395.0,"Religions and cults both have leaders who are dead. I'm not sure which way the user meant it, but it's incorrect."
todayilearned,fdnmnjx,t1_fdnkp24,1578588973.0,I disagree.
AskReddit,fdm966p,t1_fdlm4lj,1578542925.0,I recite this every year for friends on. 4/20. Have it memorized at this point.
