SuicideWatch,fcx362n,t3_ejazvg,1578049188.0,I think there is no one on this subreddit that could say no to this and actually mean it. You perfectly summarised one of my many issues.
SuicideWatch,fcny32w,t3_ei4k2u,1577820681.0,"Things that would be left unfinished, that it would look like I gave up. There are some people who would use it to feel better about themselves, which is unacceptable."
SuicideWatch,fcnwwq4,t3_ei137q,1577820069.0,Because people love to talk even if the don't know anything about what they are saying. Anyone who says that people under 18 can't be depressed is simply wrong. I was actually tought about this topic.
