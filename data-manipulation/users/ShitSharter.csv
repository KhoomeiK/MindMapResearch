todayilearned,ffkx0eg,t1_ffkkyut,1580030523.0,Idk. Never heard of this bum fight guy before. But looks like he finds broke people and uses them and doctor Phil find mentally ill broken people and uses them. Same shit different trap is the way I see as someone who doesn't watch any of this shit. I think both could use a good old fashion tar and feathering.
HumansBeingBros,ffks83v,t1_ffk90ya,1580027959.0,Those are just the ones you haven't gotten around to sending down south.

politics,ffkpti4,t1_ffjtgiu,1580026786.0,Ok? I was just pointing out the part of the industry that is the hardest to automate and brings in the most workers. Raising the prices off the raw materials only serves to hurt that part of the industry. Welding and industrial engineering is my background.
politics,ffjlfhz,t1_ffjk1td,1580000942.0,Well good faith means in voting how my preacher tells me after he read me some of them Bible sentences that the white Jesus put on this here earth to worship the Lord.
politics,ffjl2me,t1_ffjga7t,1580000696.0,"Yeah he'd hire a handful of employees to make the raw materials while manufactures lay off thousands cause of the prices. When it comes to steel, fabrication is where the jobs are at with it. You can't automate that stuff as much as people like to think you can."
politics,ffjkfoz,t1_ffjit7a,1580000259.0,Well these same people think virgins pop kids out and you can come back from the dead. Also that there's some magical place where everything is perfect once your dead but are still scared of dying.
foodscam,ffiv554,t1_ffiszkv,1579983480.0,Most the places around me have sealed bags. They show the driver the order then seal it up. Don't accept broken seal and report it.
ABoringDystopia,ffhrjkj,t1_ffhi009,1579950153.0,One start would be to do healthy version of junk food and then have microwaves accessible to the students for them to bring their own choice lunches. You can make some amazing pastas and pizzas from healthy ingredients for cheap as hell. I do it weekly myself for food prep. The microwave part would help alot to with kids being able to bring left overs or stuff they like or make. I got lucky in highschool with getting yelled at for using the teacher lounge microwave right as they were walking some corporate donors around. The next week the students had 12 microwaves on a rack available to use. I ate healthier with larger portions for cheaper. Actually lost 20lbs the first semester of that.
AskMen,fff2wwz,t1_ffevblt,1579874255.0,They get told not to do this exact thing nearly every fucking day in the military from day one. Then they fucking go and do it. Boots are gonna do dumb boot shit and I'm not gonna feel sorry about them doing it either.
