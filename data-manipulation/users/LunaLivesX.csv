yoga,ff2pkox,t1_ff2duqf,1579518053.0,"Yes, try washing the mat, it's a cheap way to make your mat less slippery. I wash my mat every 1-2 months but if you use it more or sweat more you might need to wash it more often. I just use a cloth with water and a little bit of dish soap.  

With more yoga experience you become better at using your core to stay in a pose instead of the grip of your mat, so you'll find that you'll slip less when you've practiced more too. 

I have two mats, one of €10 and one of €20 and they both do well, the €10 one just starts to fall apart after some time and that's annoying."
SampleSize,fexk497,t3_eqld0k,1579432293.0,"The last question is unclear to me: do you want to use my answers or my gender/age info? There's a double negative in there (except and not) and I just don't get it. 

Also, you ask a lot of open questions. If I take the time to write a long, thought-out answer, the questionnaire easily takes a lot more than 5 minutes. And what are you going to do with all these different answers? It is a lot more difficult or takes a lot more time to do statistics on them than when you use multiple choice questions."

AskReddit,feryomw,t1_fepn3xt,1579359700.0,"I can imagine that that can be really scary sometimes.

I was in a mental health ward for two months last summer (depression) and another patient had something similar to you. It was a bit like really high-functioning sleepwalking except that she wasn't asleep. When she was stressed she would go and clean up places, do the dishes, fold her laundry, and she didn't remember that she had done it afterwards. It was really confusing for her and everyone around her. Some people accused her of lying, because you cannot really prove that someone forgot something, but why would she have wanted to forget that she unloaded the dishwasher? That doesn't make sense. I think she really disassociated."
AskReddit,ferxkau,t1_feppevf,1579359364.0,"My boyfriend has something like this, but he only sweats from one of his wrists. That is the kind of excessive sweating that's funny. Yours isn't and I hope people don't judge you for it."
AskReddit,feruc6y,t1_fep5l8c,1579358441.0,"The whole idea of the blood pressure measurement thing is that it squeezes your arm very, very hard. It needs to squeeze your arm so hard that there is no blood flow through your upper arm anymore. 

I tend to have a quite low blood pressure (just high enough that they don't worry about it, but they did need to check if my blood pressure restores fast enough when I stand up, because I can get really dizzy). I still don't like the blood pressure measurement. 

Could you try to tell the doctor that the measurement is painful and ask if they please only do it at the end of the appointment?"
yoga,fen3r10,t3_eq0pqu,1579276312.0,"For me it helps to regularly clean my mat (just with water and a drop of dish soap). After cleaning the mat is a lot less slippy. I have experience with two different mats, both quite cheap (like €10 and €20), and this trick works for both. It's a good idea to clean your mat anyway.

Also, your technique during downdog really influences how much your hands will slip. Someone else already commented that you should press down, lift your hips up and engage your core. I've found that when my core became stronger, my hands tended to slip less."

YouShouldKnow,fdgv5tr,t1_fdgj9i0,1578409112.0,"Really? I always learned to pinch not at the flexible part of the nose but higher, like across the bridge of the nose. You should pinch the nose at a place where there are bones so that you have something to use force against. The goal is not to close off your nose but to restrict blood flow to it. When you pinch a higher part of the nose, the blood can still flow out of your nose but there will be less of it.

Not funny side effect of pinching your nose in a way that closes it off: one time I actually cried blood because the blood could not go out through my nose. It's really scary."
YouShouldKnow,fdgusyk,t1_fdgjmde,1578408863.0,"There's also nose ointment. If you often have nosebleeds you probably have scabs inside your nose. If they break or fall off too early, you get a nosebleed again. The ointment softens the scabs so that they don't break so easily."
YouShouldKnow,fdguiro,t1_fdghmv8,1578408659.0,"From my experience icing the nose works pretty good as well. I put a washcloth with cold water on it and that helps already. 

When you have a bloody nose you can pinch it at the place where you feel the bone of your face, and that also decreases the blood flow to the nose. It only works for nosebleeds down low in your nose, so if they are higher up icing works better because you can ice the space at the very top of your nose close to your eyes."

AskReddit,fd4prrd,t1_fd4j7o1,1578169875.0,"There's an Dutch 60s song about the fuchsia (the plant) called ""Wil u een stekkie"" (do you want a cutting). Here we pronounce fuchsia like fuck-see-ya, and there has been a lot of debate as to if the songwriter knew that fuck was a rude word in English. The tv show for which the song was written was a comedy, so she might have known. It still is funny :D"

yoga,fcyodk9,t3_ejjcg9,1578083834.0,"I don't have much advice, but just wanted to give you praise for not getting discouraged. That's admirable. 

Not being able to (fully) do certain poses is very common. For example, I injured my ankle a year ago and for a long time I was not able to do poses where I had to bend it a lot like lunge, warrior, child's pose and pigeon. I used a lot of pillows to try to make things possible and sometimes just didn't go as far into a pose as the other people in the class did. Another example: my partner has really tight hips and cannot sit on the floor without props. They always use a yoga block or cushion to sit on. Everybody's bodies are different and have different limitations. It's okay."

raisedbynarcissists,fcxo1ia,t1_fcgj1iw,1578067490.0,"I actually am quite a shit violin player. My parents pushed me to practice for at least half an hour each day starting at age 6. I play violin like a robot, there's no joy or any other emotion in it. I always asked my teacher for etudes because my parents didn't like it when I only played ""fun"" pieces. I always messed up during auditions and they told me I had not practiced enough, while actually a bit more confidence and a bit more joy would have helped more. They also always told me that the violin was very expensive and that I owed it to them to practice more and become good at playing it. 

Maybe some day I'll be able to express emotion through violin music, but for now I stay away from the violin because there are so many bad memories."
raisedbynarcissists,fcxku0f,t1_fci1twy,1578065375.0,"I talked about this with a friend yesterday. He says he has a bad memory because he never trains it, just asks about the things he forgot again and again. I always remember the smallest things because it's bad, ""stupid"", to ask something when it has been told to you already."
flexibility,fcg6945,t1_fcg55qh,1577636893.0,"I don't think that it's bad, as long as you make sure to warm up before going into deep poses. That's what sun salutations are for: wake up your body with gentle movement before you go into longer stretches. I usually do 3-5 times sun salutation A and then 2-3 times sun salutation B. Sometimes I modify the sun salutations with for example squats or an extra chaturanga to warm up my body even more. It depends on how I feel when I wake up. 

I'd say the best time is the time when you can do yoga with full attention. For me, mornings are good for that, because my mind is not as full of experiences and I am used to have yoga as a part of my morning routine so I don't have to decide if I am going to do yoga or not."

Journaling,fc3fsk2,t3_efx1qb,1577388838.0,"In times that I thought about sex a lot, I also wrote about it a lot. I have no intention of letting anyone ever read my journal, so I also have no intention of keeping it suitable for a reader of a certain age. Even if my journals did not contain thoughts about sex, they would contain other things I would not want a younger person to read (mental health things). 

I think that writing about sex can be fun. Sometimes I look back at the fantasies I wrote about and find out that they have come true without me having to actually do a lot to get there. I have let my partner read parts of them sometimes, which also was really interesting and enjoyable. But my partner knows that they can only read the parts that I show them and the rest of the journal is mine. That's okay. 

Would it be nice to not feel guilty for writing about sex? Sex is part of life like all kinds of body things and mind things. There's such a lot to discover. I felt really awkward writing about how other things in my body (like my period or my digestion) but with practice it became easier and more normal, which I like."
yoga,fc3ddnk,t1_fc2uc9p,1577387314.0,"I think it depends on the kind of yoga you do. Only hatha yoga or yin yoga probably does not do much for your back. Strengthening yoga like vinyasa yoga, power yoga, or ashtanga yoga will certainly help develop back muscles. These kinds of yoga really have a lot of focus on having a strong core, which includes abs, back muscles and hip muscles."

I have been approaching therapy still as if something is wrong with me and I should fix it as soon as I can. It's not like that: I need to do therapy because I am not feeling good and I deserve to feel better. 

The way I was taught that I was broken was quite clever, because it was mostly about how the things I was good at were not important and not worth much, and the things that I was not good at were essential."
