personalfinance,ffg3nkw,t3_etf3pi,1579897753.0,"Depending on this biz this just.... happens. I had like $45 outstanding from some old-ass gas bill that got charged off, I called the gas company and they were like ""oh.... well yeah that account got charged off but just pay us and you'll be squared up"" and it dropped off my credit report pretty quickly. They get paid, so why do they care? And this WAS just some call center agent, not even a supervisor. I really think it depends who the organization is. 

A story comes to mind, not really the same, but, I think the situation is wild, and it has to do with (definitely uncommon) collection practices. 

I'm sure this is rare... but.... Verizon has literally dropped balances with me *multiple* times on *multiple* accounts all under my same damn name. I don't pretend this was a responsible thing to do, but a while back before I got clean  (booze is bad, kids), I switched off 'em to another provider without settling my account. They came after me for a long time for 2 unpaid months, sent letters threatening collections, called multiple times per week..... then vanished. Like a fart in the wind.  NOTHING. It's not on my credit report. They don't call anymore. I can't log into that old account on their site. It's just.... nixed. And at this point this is like 5 years ago.  


And then..... I had signed up with them again at a new address a couple years later. When I signed up, they didn't say a single damn word about my previous business with them. And I was even prepared to be like ""yep I think I owe you guys around $220, I can pay that first."" But nope. You'd think it'd come up when they run my SSN or something, idk?

But, then, switched to Comcast again after having some service disruption issues. Never got around to sending back my internet modem. They sent me the box to return it. Letter after letter. Started getting calls. Threats that it'd get sent to collections. Then...... wash, rinse, repeat. NOTHING. I never got a ""final bill"" for the hardware (which was mentioned in pretty much every letter), there is STILL nothing from Verizon on my credit report, I can't access the old login associated with that service anymore....... and..... the device is still gathering dust in my closet. There's one damn Verizon store within like 40 miles of me, I just...... didn't get around to it on one of my Saturdays >\_>

At least in my case, TWICE, Verizon has just said ""fuck it"" about debts of a few hundred dollars. They must be doin' aight.

personalfinance,fffwkv5,t1_fffw268,1579893380.0,"My other thought, though, is.... if I've paid $2k in interest, which I have, then.... is that reduction actually the same as the value they gave me in the car? That's their profit money, that's not the money they gave the car dealer to buy the thing. In THAT way, they didn't give me free value, they just agreed not to keep profiting off my borrow.

It still seems like if it's the private entity's choice to forfeit the interest revenue and just recoup the loss, then, that argument doesn't hold water, because the interest they'd be paid isn't value they gave me in the loan. It's the reward they get back for giving it to me.

That doesn't mean we can't call it ""objectively wrong"" though, lol. The cost to the IRS of dealing with changing financial reports does NOT come close to hundreds of dollars in taxes. If both me and a private party agree to change the terms of a contract WE signed, the government can F off as far as I'm concerned. To a consumer, this is the government saying ""PSH you weren't planning on having that extra disposable income, so, give it to us instead. Nevermind that you already paid taxes on it when you earned it.

Retail manager on a Saturday, and it was one of those used media/collectibles shop where we bought shit from people. So weekends were a mess of ""trades"" (read: mostly people begging me to buy their worthless junk) and just busyness with the store.

We had this dude who'd come in once every couple weeks who lived in an assisted care facility. Middle-aged, nice as can be, but missing just a few too many marbles to be able to live on his own. But NOT so many that he had to have a caretaker when he went out on the town by himself.

Dude would come into the store with a huge handwritten list of EVERY audio CD release since his last visit. Including the barcode numbers to make sure he found EXACTLY the right versions. He would come up to the counter and ask about 3 or 4 of them at a time, grab one of my associates to go find them, and he'd just..... check 'em out. Look them over, talk about them for a few minutes, then on to the next one. I swear in the months he  was coming in, he never bought a single item.

One particular day I was up to my elbows in shit-covered DVD cases and dude marches up to the counter for maybe his fifth or sixth time on that particular visit. It was late in the afternoon - break was long in the rear view mirror, but the end of the day wasn't even on the horizon.

The only time in my customer service career I've ever lost my cool on a customer. Dude came up and asked me if I had a sec, and I just froze, glared right into his eyes, and in my strongest, sternest voice, shouted ""WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THIS TIME""

As a result, I truly don't think we'll ever see the end of historical preservation. It's *always* going to fascinate those in our society who seek to connect with human history. And it's a noble pursuit, to be sure. 

I think there's a lot to be gained from technology in this respect. Imagine a quadriplegic who, through the magic of VR, can now experience hiking the Appalachian or ""climbing the Rocky steps.""

How much history am I *really* getting if I visit the Leaning Tower and, beyond the structure itself, I'm surrounded by....... souvenir carts, tour groups, people taking that same cheesy photo by the dozens, turnstiles, signposts, etc..... in many cases, tourism itself is what cheapens the experience of seeing a destination in person, even if the destination itself is otherwise pretty neat. 

So as a young person hoping to travel more in the future, I'm looking to find more ""off the beaten path"" destinations where the experience still feels authentic. For example, I recently did some reading on Riga, Latvia, and it's a friggin beautiful place. It's now on my list."

Hooray for healthy livers!"

I guess coming off the booze is so profound that my brain wants to have insane dreams, anyways, lol"

For me, I got to days 3-5 soooooooo many times before finally getting through 2 consecutive weekends. And I'm FINALLY starting to feel good. After lots of on-again-off-again, 3 days here, 5 days there. It's different for all of us."
AskReddit,fenl4k8,t1_feneelb,1579287013.0,"Well, yeah, to be honest, the appeal of a lot of these types of sites is ""seeing something significant that you wouldn't normally see""

Up until the internet age, that *meant* something. But you know what, I completely get not being impressed by Stonehenge. We've heard the mysterious stories about it, we've seen countless pictures, I can't imagine that seeing it with my own two eyeballs is going to be SUCH a uniquely different experience from studying and looking at pictures that... I'm going to be moved to the point that it's worth a $1k plane ticket to go see. 

I think this is largely why the younger generations are much more into events & experiences. For example, barbaric as it is, the Running of the Bulls is something you just don't get the full effect of from watching a video. Being at the event is an immersive experience you can't replicate with storytelling. Stuff like that, or visiting Japan for the Cherry Blossom Festival, celebrating New Years in China, etc...... that's much more special than just ""seeing a sight"" in the 21st century, and I understand it. 

I also could see, literally less than 10 years from now, these experiences being readily available in virtual reality, thus rendering THOSE experiences vastly cheapened as well."

TwoXChromosomes,fen9clm,t1_fen8rcl,1579279801.0,"This is just the thing, abortion isn't something explicitly defined in the Constitution. As such, all of our decisions about it being a Constitutional right stem from court interpretations. Court decisions are bound and shaped by legislation. If people don't like a court decision, they can legislate over it. 

As a result, the decision only truly reflects a Constitutional ""right"" that can't simply be determined by a populist majority if it can be passed as a true amendment to the Constitution.

Otherwise, quite literally, every new state legislature can enact, then repeal, then enact, then repeal, the same law over and over again."
