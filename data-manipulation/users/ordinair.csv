It might be helpfull for your client tot let him write a 'letter from the future' (Yvan Dolan came up with this).
It goes like this:


'Designed as a follow-up to the Miracle Question or “problem is gone” question, this 
letter is to be written and not mailed. Although originally designed to be written, it also 
can be spoken aloud or represented visually through artwork, computer images, collages, 
etc. if that is preferable to the client. 


Pick a time in the future, a few weeks from now or even a number of years or any shorter or longer time length that is meaningful to you. 
Date the top of the letter with the imaginary future date after your solution-focused 
Miracle has happened. Imagine that the intervening years have passed and you are writing to a friend (pick someone you know and like). Use the friends name in the salutation, as in, “Dear (friend's name).” Or if you 
prefer, pick some other supportive person to whom you can comfortably imagine writing.
The purpose of dating the letter and writing it to someone you actually know is to strengthen the psychological realism of the letter for you on 
both an unconscious and conscious level. 
Go into as much detail as possible in your description of how your life is different now that your Miracle has happened. (You do not need to specifically refer to Miracle, but instead describe its effects and how these differences show up to other people in your life and of course your self. Imagine that at the time of the letter writing, you are living a wonderful healthy, satisfying life, exactly the sort of life you would wish to live. Describe how you are spending your time, where you are living, your relationships, beliefs, and reflections on the past and future. Include as many details as possible and do not 
worry about the practicality or “reality” of the various ideas or thoughts that emerge as you describe this preferred “miraculous” future.


Counselor Follow-up: Once the Miracle Letter has been completed, offer scaling 
questions to help identify the parts of the “miracle” that are already present in the 
person’s life (“exceptions”) and help identify the smallest next behavior steps that will 
signify continued positive movement. Scale confidence and motivation and explore ways 
to increase these and other effective components as needed by utilizing SF ex'

Most of the time I let cliënten write to there current self. Ik suggest them to include some advise to themselves, nu letting them include the thngs that proved helpfull for there future self tovreachvthis situation.

A variations is to suggest thema to make a walk as they onder and wiser version off themselves, while talking to their current self. A simular instruction van be used (though there is a specific instruction as well.

These are just 2 techniques, while a big part of my interventions are future oriented of focused on edtablishing a existential connection with the person (man/woman, partner, professional...)  they would liked to be remembered / that fits with the way  they want to live their life on it's best."
