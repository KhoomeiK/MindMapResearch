“Okay you’re in? Cool. I can see you. It was nice of you to test this game but just so you know there are a lot of bugs , like”

*player opens pause menu*

“Ah. There. You already found one. Well, anyway, there’s a flag at the end of all of these rooms and if you get to it without clipping through the floors then well that’s close enough for me.”

And they basically just get way more pissed off every time you “cheat.”
