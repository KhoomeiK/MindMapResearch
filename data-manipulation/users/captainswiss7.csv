Some might not have ps4 so they'll miss out on part 1, some wont be able to afford ps5 right away, so they might miss out on the other episodes. It's just bad timing to release something that's going to take multiple installments across multiple console generations. I'm sure it will effect sales, people will be discouraged to buy part 2 if they didnt play 1, and I'm sure they'll rerelease 1 on ps5 so most people will buy it twice. It's all speculation though. 

I watched the demo though and it does look good, so I'm not too worried about quality. I'll probably scoop up part1, but wait to see if they end up on pc eventually so I can have the whole thing in 1 place. I still wish they remade 6 instead of 7 tho."

Just clean your stuff. No clutter collecting chairs or tables. Like when you come home dont just throw your stuff around. Take the time to put things in their proper places all the time.

If you clean regularly, every time you clean its quick and easy. Like if you clean a little every day, your homes never dirty.

Work out. Dont need to really go to the gym. Just do some pushups, jog, sit ups, etc. This will get you in shape, plus it will release them feel good hormones in your brain. This will help boost your confidence and might even encourage you to get a gym membership.

Hygiene. Brush your teeth, clean breath alone can take you a long way. Groom yourself, comb your hair, shave,  clean clothes, etc. Your body's a temple, treat it as such. When you look good, you feel good about yourself.

Eat good. Dont go talk to a girl after eating a block of cheese or asparagus. You'll smell like it. Just eat healthy, it will help you feel good. No girls gonna be interested if you're all greasy from eating KFC. 

Read some books. Yeah girls like tuff guys, but girls like smart guys too. Read something, it will give you something to talk about and maybe teach you something new. 

Along with reading, expand your horizons. Try out new movies, music, tv shows. Gives you stuff to talk about and expands the possibility of finding a shared interest with someone.

Clean your home, car etc. Kind of like your clothes and hygiene, a messy home means a messy mind. You might be self conscious to bring a girl to a messy home, so clean it up and you wont be worried about it.

Yes if you want to get technical all matter is natural, but what we do with it is not natural order. That's the key, natural order. Tigers dont build nuclear bombs, dumb dumb humans do."
worldnews,fdi6hk2,t1_fdi1mbb,1578436591.0,"I see what you're trying to say, however this world has never seen anything like humans. You can say humans are a product of evolution and thus a product of nature, but our machinations are all things that do not coincide with natural order. If you really want to be specific all things are natural. Coal, oil, concrete, glass, etc.  are all things derived from nature. We twist and shape it into unnatural things. Coal is naturally in the ground and would not burn like it does, oil would not be burning and its byproducts of plastic and gasoline would not naturally be, nuclear waste would not exist. You cant create something from nothing, so technically all things are natural in that regard. 

Humans might be products of nature, but all things in nature live as one with nature. We dont. We corrupt and destroy nature because we try to live outside of nature as humanity believes they have conquered nature and stand above it. We dont acknowledge that our actions have consequences. Animals do not do what we do, and the reason most today are going extinct is due to humanity, not natural selection, unless you want to view humanity as reapers of natural selection.

If humans are anything in the natural order, its entropy given biological form. We are random and we destroy. We create, but by our creations, we destroy what's around us. If we destroy the ocean with pollution, we destroy marine life, and ourselves. If we destroy all trees, we dont breathe. Yes I see what you're saying, but if humanity didnt exist, the current environmental crisis we experience also would not. 

The idea is to change. Humanity can strive, but we need to change our cultures. We need to stop dumping waste in the ocean, we need to use alternative sources of fuel, and we need to just flat out change. Defeatist and denial wont lead to change. That's self destructive. Any little action can make big waves. Imagine if every human agreed to stop polluting. That 1 thing can make a huge difference. The oceans would not be acidifying, our communities would be clean and our environment would be clean. Switching from coal to wind and solar would make a massive difference. We just need to start doing.  And to coincide with your point those things are also natural, but dont have a negative impact.

Millions of vehicles pumping exhaust into the air is not natural, a continent sized mass of plastic in the ocean is not natural, power plants burning tons of coal is not natural, modern warfare is not natural, dumping toxic chemicals and waste is not natural.
