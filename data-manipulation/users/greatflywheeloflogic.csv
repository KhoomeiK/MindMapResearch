nfl,feb61gl,t1_fe73884,1578955776.0,I thought it was really only that last drive before the half and the first drive to start the game that they let Henry really get loose. They stopped the titans from getting into field goal range or making any big pass plays the rest of the first half
nfl,feb5ack,t1_fe8t48p,1578955561.0,Sure let me rephrase. A point in time where the game was almost not winnable for the pats. They were at their one yard line with no timeouts and around 30 second left on the clock. They needed two big pass plays back to back and at least one of them needed to be near the sideline to kill the clock
nfl,fe6wrao,t1_fe3gsks,1578906860.0,Elite defense and a short week for them
nfl,fe6wmcm,t1_fe5t7wj,1578906660.0,"Nah, me made it through close to three several healthy seasons at the start of his career. Those teams had terrible o-lines and he took a beating in his first 3 years."
nfl,fe6ue3e,t1_fe31gpo,1578905431.0,"They would have terrible leverage as a blocker, so half of their positions role wouldn’t be there"
nfl,fe6tpwz,t1_fe5x2l6,1578905032.0,"Blow him?

I’m sure you meant blow him up, but that’s the opposite of how teams are taught to play the option. One guy (Thomas in this play) is supposed to sag out to cover the pitch to the RB. Then the inside player is supposed to cover the QB but not move up field until the RB pitch is covered. 

They didn’t do a terrible job at covering this. They just did a bad job tackling and tannehill did a great job fighting through the defenders"
nfl,fe6tof1,t1_fe3kkbt,1578904985.0,"Tannehill is definitely not scrawny. Also, recruited to A&M as a WR so he’s got athletic ability"
nfl,fe6tjqs,t1_fe3c59b,1578904804.0,Yeah that seems to be the tiara a philosophy. They played a lot of soft zone which was easy to pick a apart slowly up until the redzone. It also allowed all of the db’s to keep their eyes on Jackson when he started scrambling
nfl,fe6td7s,t1_fe3h7j1,1578904533.0,"Yeah I don’t think anyone whose been paying attention is surprised by this. Most of this years playoff teams were run heavy. Several teams including the 49ers and pats have been using FB’s frequently. The ravens have several multiple back formations that are used frequently plus they often use two TE’s. The Seahawks often use and extra lineman. The Vikings have been a run heavy team this year, and even the packers have been leaving on their rb’s more. 

I think Carroll actually is one step ahead of this. The hawks have been running base defense more than any team this year. They just drafted Barton and they brought in two other good linebackers to rotate in. I expect to see more teams shift this way in the future"
nfl,fe6t03c,t1_fe5rzy9,1578904006.0,And brown hadn’t really taken off yet
nfl,fe6sy1m,t1_fe6cz89,1578903926.0,"Yeah, your coach isn’t exactly known for having unprepared teams in the playoffs. 

BB purposefully schemed to stop the titans play action on early downs at the expense of giving Henry more room. It’s a gamble that’s won him a super bowl before and honestly it was close to working last week. They were only down by one point until the garbage time interception"
nfl,fe6stac,t1_fe6a2yk,1578903738.0,"I feel like he was supposed to be a decoy. If you freeze Frame the video right before Henry pulls up to throw you can see that ET is sagging back and watching mariota. Then mariota starts waving his hands around and ET takes a few steps back towards him. 

If Henry throws a lob to mariota ET has a good chance to get their and break it up. I think the whole thing was designed to pull the safety away from the middle of the field"
nfl,fe6spdj,t1_fe68lsb,1578903588.0,I’m not surprised. As great as the titans have looked the chiefs did just put up 51 points and hold the Texans to 7 points in the second half. Plus they’re at home
nfl,fe6smsz,t1_fe6a9bs,1578903492.0,Yeah but the pats still have a great defense and Henry ran all over them.

nfl,fe6qzjr,t1_fe6dsia,1578901277.0,"Russ has quality players around him now (when healthy): locket, Metcalf, Carson, penny, Britt, brown are all good and dissly looks promising. 

The issue is 1. Half those guys were out for this game, 2. Pete’s philosophy doesn’t work when the running game and defense are bad, and 3. The defense isn’t very good right now"
nfl,fe6qqq0,t1_fe6lm6u,1578900963.0,"Yeah, you’re right. These guys don’t know what they’re talking about. Apparently if they aren’t rookie of the year they’re a bust. I guess they don’t realize that it can be a bit harder to rebuild when the team is still competitive and thus getting low draft picks"
nfl,fe6qod8,t1_fe6m5vj,1578900880.0,"He was drafted too high for sure, but he’s not a bust. He was starting to get comfortable with the nfl a few weeks before his injury. He might still turn out to be a great back"
nfl,fe6qlrm,t1_fe6e9t8,1578900788.0,"They’ve hit on a few other guys I think. Flowers is improving a lot (have to remember he played safety in college and has been learning as he plays), and Barton looked promising this year.

I agree that they drafted penny too high but he seems to finally be catching up to the nfl"
nfl,fe6qhj2,t1_fe6po4u,1578900637.0,"You know that the running backs will heal right? They’re aren’t deAd...

And they do have other young players they drafted that are getting better: flowers, penny, Barton, and griffin have all been good and will get better. 

Then they brought in fluker, Diggs, and clowney

You can expect them to turnover the roster into LOB level in two years especially when they are still winning and therefore getting low draft picks"
nfl,fe6pz7l,t1_fe49jxd,1578899992.0,It’s 5. This game set the record
nfl,fe6px41,t1_fe51r3q,1578899917.0,5 is the record. They only said 1970 because it’s the year of the merger and the common reference point for stats
nfl,fe6pvzi,t1_fe4hm2n,1578899877.0,This is the record. 1970 was the year of the merger and so is the common reference point for nfl statistics.
nfl,fe6pqvd,t3_enoknn,1578899694.0,"This is stupid. Earl Thomas was hanging back to cover mariota and is only moving toward the other receiver in this image because Henry had already released the ball.

If you pause it right before Henry releases you can see Thomas is focused on mariota not the other receiver. Pretty sure mariota was meant to be a decoy on this play; that’s why he stops and waves his hand around"
nfl,fe6ph8h,t1_fe6afjp,1578899371.0,"Isn’t this the marker that doesn’t have the chains? Making it also not the official line to gain. I don’t know why we didn’t get an camera view from the other side where the chains are at. Just shitty fox things I guess.

That said it probably was a first down and even if it wasn’t it was going to be too close to ever overturn"
nfl,fe6pcq9,t1_fe69zut,1578899218.0,Yeah it was a terrible decision to not go for it. If the didn’t get it you can still hold the packers to a field goal and the packers likely would have called similar plays to try and drain the clock. Better off giving yourself two opportunities especially with how the defense not being able to get pressure on Rodgers or cover Adams all night
nfl,fe6p7i1,t1_fe6fri6,1578899040.0,"I agree that it was most likely a first down. However, the pylon cAmera everyone keeps referencing is on the opposite side of the official chains, so it is also an estimation just like the yellow line. I’m not sure why they didn’t have a camera angle from the other side of the field where the actual first down marker was"

Bradford and bridgewater have almost the exact same career up to this point. Two high draft picks that looked average but showed promise early on. Then both had major potentially career ending injuries. Then both ended up as backups. Bradford eventually bounced around the league as a fill in starter and I’m betting Bridgewater does the same thing.

The ravens look like the best team right now. So did the pats (even better than the ravens) when they marched into the Super Bowl with 0 losses. They then lost to a giants team than just squeezed into the playoffs. Anything can happen

Also, it’s pretty ignorant to say the titans looked bad last week. They played a top 3 defense in that teams stadium and won. That impressive. Again, Tannehill wasn’t exposed; Bb game planned specifically to stop Tannehill and not Henry. BB dropped two safeties deep on early downs to take away the play action that the titans feed off (they are one of the most successful play action teams this year). He was betting that Henry alone couldn’t beat them, and it came very close to paying off. 

Again, this is one for those time where you might listen to someone whose watched more than you. See BB famously did this in the superbowl in the 90’s when he was the defensive coordinator of the giants. The bills had the best offense that year; BB let Thomas run wild and focused on stopping Kelly and the passing game. It worked and he’s used this strategy multiple time since then"

CFB,fdh2kf0,t1_fcssqrv,1578414008.0,You always don’t see many redshirt sophomores with two full years of starting experience. Based on Lincoln’s last few qb’s the odds are good  that Rattler will be projected a top 5 pick after his second season starting.
nfl,fdh2cks,t1_fct3qt4,1578413874.0,Agreed. I could see Tua becoming a slightly less Athletic Wilson. He’s good passing on the move and always keeps his eyes downfield to pass instead of run. He’s very precise with his throws (especially the deep ball).

Something isn’t adding up here"
unpopularopinion,fdh1tx4,t1_fd3gztm,1578413547.0,"Ambulances aren’t necessary for most people though. I’m not sure where you’re from but many states have detox centers run by the state that don’t cost much.

Someone can always go to a private detox center and pay tons of cash though. And if you’re in a state that denied the Medicare extension it’s probably going to be expensive:"
