todayilearned,feg10d5,t1_fedqqdw,1579072320.0,"Yeah. Star Wars could have flopped and he'd be thinking today that it was the easiest money he ever made. Obi-wan himself demanded royalties because he thought it would flop. He's earned much more since then and is widely loved, and respected for his physical acting worldwide. I wouldn't say he got shortchanged, especially since we are just talking about the ""pilot"" of a series, so to speak. 

  His voice is one of our favorite things about Darth Vader, but Jones was voice acting. He killed the small part he had and had a healthy career for decades. I'm sure he's as flawed as us all, but he's as close to one of those national treasure types that I can honestly say i can't remember hearing someone utter a bad word about him. I highly doubt that he feels an ounce of resentment about this topic"

If they are already committed in a relationship, he'll have less to worry about, socially. It's embarrassing, sure, because people are laughing at his expense, but he got tricked into thinking he was about to die. When you take that into consideration, it's kind of adorable. 

  TL;DR Laughing it off is the best move"

  Chemo for leukemia basically bleaches out your bone marrow. This leads to anemia and neutropenia(extremely low white blood cell count). I got sick every time when my immune system was compromised, and needed blood and platelet infusions all the time. I probably got 40+ units of platelets and 30+ of blood. I spent 12 weeks total as in inpatient over a 5 month span.
