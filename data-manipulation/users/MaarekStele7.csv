The majority of gamers are console gamers.  Console gamers cannot create their own servers, on PC players can do that which is what many older versions of PC games still connect to.

Today you can still find CoD2 servers and battlefield servers.  Most console servers are shut down at the point of the console's end of life while PC servers are player owned and maintained by the players who still enjoy the game without the worry of Micro-transactions.

Unfortunately, even PC versions of games are changed and controlled the same way as consoles over time.  This there are no player controller servers."

CryingSuns,fen33zr,t3_entb89,1579275905.0,"I'm playing on normal, making sure I have a diverse crew and receiving many positive outcomes.

I'm still in chapter 1 3/3.  And yet I thought the demo was hard.

I could say that I'm lucky, but the brunt of my losses have been in soldiers.  I would then pick a path in the new system and see that I can restock.  I've already maxed out my squad bays (4/4) and currently have 3 guns.  Next, I'm going to change out some crew members since they're just a duplicate of another.

NEO, I'm finding on planets and helping stranded ships.  One thing that the demo didn't have were the options to use crew for medical, piloting, and other jobs.  All have been positive outcomes.

After the 2/3 boss fight, I unlocked the last squadron.

Frankly, I always look for planetary expeditions and try to check each planet.  Sometimes I've netted 3~5 NEO from other ships.

On Steam, the DEV has a game going often in the stream.  Watch some of it for tactics and exploration ideas.  I've done this.

Tips:  

* Hit up the station last at a star.  You want to maximize scrap and items you find to sell.
* You should never backtrack to a previous location at a star, which is why the station should be your last stop.
* Send weakened squadrons back to the battleship instead of letting them die.  Their repair will be quicker over time.
* Spending time at a planet doesn't waste fuel, extend the of questioning what is going on to net a positive outcome for scrap and fuel.
* If you have a chance to use a crew member for a task, use it instead of the alternative, it's most likely a positive outcome.  The crew mostly perish during planetary runs.
* 50/50 outcomes are 50/50 but do come with hints from the crew on whether to proceed or not.
* Read the stats on the squadrons you acquire and see if you'll use them.

I'm on a lucky run where I've had fewer battles and squadron losses.  I did come across the pirate that said: ""That's it, I'm out.""  And received 58 scraps from the easy encounter.

I'm in chapter 1 still, so I'll see how far this run gets me.  I know I should read up on more advanced items.  But again. Rogue-like games are partially based on luck from your decisions.  That's the challenge and enjoy.

I'm glad I picked up this game."
