fitbit,fffwfvp,t1_ffeydl5,1579893293.0,I must just be super lucky then
fitbit,ffewkly,t3_et6rgj,1579868494.0,"I’m someone who barely ever has red during my sleep. I think I’m just naturally a good sleeper though (I know, I’m super lucky for that)

The only thing I do is my phone sets automatically to night mode at 7pm so the screen is basically yellow after that time. I don’t know how much of an effect this really has or if it even really helps but it might make an improvement? :)"
AmItheAsshole,ffdufe0,t3_eszvls,1579829192.0,"YTA, don’t tell someone there will be food there for them to eat and then serve them just a larger portion of a side salad. Most people would be starving going home just eating a few salad leaves. Total dick move, it would’ve been really hard watching everyone eat an actual meal and wishing you’d just brought your own food"
fatlogic,ffdry8y,t3_eszxrf,1579827446.0,Wow this post has really made me want a hot cross bun
CleaningTips,ffaclzt,t3_esem0q,1579732379.0,I absolutely love my roomba and I’m always shocked when emptying it how much dust and crap it’s picked up. I’d definitely recommend it as you can run it multiple times a day and it’ll pick up excess dust from the floor.
EDAnonymous,ff8wnbh,t1_ff8wjf8,1579698527.0,"Also when I was recovering from bulimia (which was very binge heavy) I would make GIANT low calorie meals that I could pick at for a long time. Plates full of green beans, baked potatoes, grapes, etc. anything I could eat for a long time but not feel guilty about was ideal."
EDAnonymous,ff8wjf8,t3_es0k3g,1579698429.0,"Don’t try and restrict after a binge, it makes it much worse. The worst thing you can do as a binge eater is let yourself be hungry. Have you tried eating a lot of tiny portions throughout the day? 

Also, I know this can be a super hard thing to do, but when you feel the urge to binge, take a second and think to yourself ‘why do I have this urge’? It doesn’t always help, but knowing why you’re doing it means you’re closer to finding a way to nip the cause of the problem in the bud."
TrueCrime,ff5pa9f,t3_ers5uv,1579604454.0,I usually put on something funny or lighthearted to get murder out of my brain so it doesn’t get into my dreams that night lol

WeightLossAdvice,ff0wtp3,t3_er14co,1579473034.0,Because of your past with an eating disorder and your age it might be better to consult a doctor or dietitian for advice on how much you should be eating
beauty,ff0uv78,t3_er2wc8,1579472481.0,Yeah but definitely only use light or light/medium tans or you will look super unnatural
modafinil,fexun81,t3_eqv41p,1579436540.0,"I’ve found it helps with the tiredness that often comes with a hangover, but for the headaches you just need to rehydrate and do the usual hangover stuff"
AmItheAsshole,fep6qbo,t3_eq2sz1,1579313379.0,"ESH 
Jenny has made it pretty clear that she doesn’t like kids and doesn’t want to spend her time babysitting/entertaining a kid. That’s probably why she brings it up so often, she’s trying to set some boundaries and establish autonomy over her life. Telling her she has to help makes you TA.



Her saying in front of the child that she hates kids and not showing any common courtesy makes her TA. She doesn’t have to babysit, but she could be a bit more polite, even if the person she’s being polite to is a young child."
