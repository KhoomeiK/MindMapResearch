facebookwins,fclp8rc,t1_fclb2h1,1577753136.0,"$220/hour is the artists flat rate. They don’t charge a tray fee, set-up time, consultation fee, drawing time. $170-200/hour is pretty standard at the shop my Wife works at. Bigger, multi session tattoos are usually quoted a price and if it takes longer than the artist thought, well, anything over is on the artist. I’ve often seen artists adjust their quote in favour of the client if the sessions went faster or they like and have built a rapport with the client. 

That said, I see clients tip very well at the shop. As high as 50% on occasion.  

Good tattoo artists are usually backlogged and really don’t need to seek out clients. 2 artists at my wife’s shop have their books closed and don’t expect them to be open until the end of 2020. One of the artists took on a new client only because he offered to pay $3000 for a $1000 tattoo. My point is, a good tattoo artist that can demand $220/hour usually hates and has no time for smaller tattoos and is in such high demand that they can afford to be dicks to people that are being dicks to them...and if being a bit prickish ensures  never to be contacted by someone who just wants to waste their time?
