worldnews,ffrzm2p,t3_eurfj4,1580169550.0,"On Assange, I'm actually mixed on how it was handled. I say this as a Canadian: I think if it can be proven that Assange was working with Russians to interfere in the American election, I can really understand the claims against him.

AskAChristian,ffrtnzn,t3_euurr2,1580165583.0,"The answer is actually pretty simple: look at the wider context. 

Matt. 10:34 is best read in context to the verses around it. So what's the context of Matt. 10? 10:1 is the start of an obvious section of Matthew's Gospel. First, the Twelve are named and commissioned and an important part of their commission to is to ""Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, drive out demons. Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give"" (v. 8; New American Bible Revised Edition). Furthermore, if they are rejected they are to leave without objection -- leave and shake the dust of that town off of them. 

Then there's a bit of a turn in Matthew's narrative: persecutions against Christians are promised. Jesus says ""I am sending you like sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and simple as doves"" (v. 16), the warning is made more explicit: beware of people. Leaders of synagogues will conspire to bring you to judgement and you will be judged by political authorities and by Gentiles (critical scholarship would likely contend that this represents Matthew projecting his context into the Jesus narrative -- this is the sort of issue that sounds more like the situation after Jesus' death; others would assume that Jesus is prophesying what will come to pass -- this isn't the treatment the Twelve get during Jesus' lifetime, but it's the treatment that they will get after the Resurrection). Jesus then offers encouragement so that they might remain courageous before saying that He has come to bring the sword. 

The next verses make it pretty clear that the ""sword"" is probably metaphorical because what follows are some verses commonly called the hard sayings of Jesus. 

> Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. (vv. 37-39)

These are called the hard sayings because Jesus is demanding, well, hard things. A devaluing of familial love and responsibility is immediately obvious. I also say this section makes it clear that the ""sword"" is a metaphor here because the call is to ""take up his cross and follow after me."" Think: take up your noose and die with me.

This is followed up by a promise of rewards.

So how does this gel with Matt. 5:9? Well, Matt. 5-7 are an extended sermon, of which 5:9 is part of the introduction. A major focus on this Sermon, the Sermon on the Mount, is how Jesus expects His followers to conduct themselves -- there is a very clear ethical imperative to those chapters. The introduction, the blessings or the beatitudes, are pithy summary statements. You can compare them to Luke's blessings and woes found in Luke 6:20-26. These aren't *exactly* comparable (the woes act to contrast the blessings; there's fewer blessings) but I think the parts that are relevant to this discussion are vv. 22 & 26:

> Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.... Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you, for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.

Which helps illuminate the tradition that Jesus has in mind when division is spoken about in Matt. 10: the division comes from a rejection of truth. Division is not the purpose, but it is an expected reaction to truth. In the Bible, the clearest example of this in the Prophets is Jeremiah (famously rejected; most, if not all, the narratives that come out of Jeremiah focus on his rejection). God's intent in Jeremiah is not to divide, per se (though this is a curse upon the people), but to repent. But the call to repent causes division in most people, only a few repent. The Gospels portray Jesus as part of the prophetic tradition that comes, preaching truth, and is reject by the people. The division is not the intent, but it happens and it becomes a form of punishment for those that reject the truth. 

But, again, when we look at how Jesus instructed the Twelve to act, what are they called to do? Preach, heal, exorcise demons and to do so while expecting nothing in return; even you're rejected, you are to leave without complaint. *That's* the conduct that will cause division. In the narrative Jesus, being part of the prophetic tradition, recognizes that this will cause division. The sword that Jesus brings is, if you look back, healing and, if you look forward, persecution to Jesus' followers. Matt. 5:9 calls on Jesus' followers to be peacemakers but it does not mean that people will accept the peace offered. When the peace is offered and rejected, it becomes a sword in that it causes division and strife. But the cause of division is healing and those that are called to suffer the strife are His own followers."

news,ff9zmmo,t1_ff9rrda,1579724899.0,"The grammar is ambiguous. What's the part of the sentence that the ""also"" is interacting with? Likely -- it seems clear that it's not referring back to the previous sentence. 

But the also could mean that Stein, like the other candidate, is a Russian asset. It could mean that Stein is a favourite among the Russians and is also a Russia asset (redundant, sure, but redundancy is also a form of emphasis). 

And the next sentence is also ambiguous. Is the ""she"" referring to Stein or the Democrat running in the primary (and my understanding on the interview is that this is in response to a question about Gabbard so the initial ""she"" in the quote is about Gabbard). 

If you read the grammar logically, the pronoun would obviously refer to Stein -- she is the last named subject. But, of course, language isn't always so easy to diagram and we often speak ambiguously because the context is usually enough to clear up any linguistic ambiguity.

Which isn't to say that I don't think she was referring to Gabbard as an asset. But I think there's a case to make about the grammar being very ambiguous. I also think the case could be made about whether or not Gabbard is an asset in the sense that she's actively colluding with Russians or if she's an asset in the sense that Russia thinks that by boosting her it creates rifts in the Democratic Party that can be exploited. Those are two very different claims. 

I think a good case could be made that Clinton meant this: Gabbard is being boosted by the Russians for their own ends; Stein benefited from that same sort of treatment and also actively an asset; both are, in effect, assets."

You're offended when she uses the gendered stuff that she didn't want (and, she's right, it doesn't matter if he wears girls clothes -- especially at that age, he'll probably barely wear it before he outgrows it!).

Why?

It reads like a Digimon-esque understanding of evolution rather than a naturalistic understanding. Devolve, as a concept, makes sense if you assume evolution has a direction or sense of progress (which implies a sort of intentionality) that can be turned back, rather than evolution being the eventual result of random mutations that are passed on -- progress is, strictly speaking, something we read into the process. In the understanding where devolution would make sense as a concept, it would imply that evolution is progressing to something and devolution moves a species away from that something. I have an inkling that devolution, as a concept, has some connection to social Darwinism and eugenics more than it does to modern biology. At the very least, it seems to me to be an idea that is less concerned with evolution as it happens and evolution as we think it should happen.

If a community isn't vigilant it's easy to have a religious leader who demands people think the same things (at least publicly) as they profess and then if they pivot to saying that a certain political leader is God-sent to fix their woes, you can start to get this sort of fascination. 

I think something to point out is that people might say Trump is a flawed individual like a Biblical king, but here's the thing: that God uses flawed people in the Bible *never* means they aren't expected to live by God's rule and they are ultimately judged for their failings. And, in the Biblical worldview, it seems like a leader is a mirror of their people -- the sins of a leader reflects upon their people. If someone like Trump's moral character is dismal and the people select him to rule (I know, I know, electoral college), then it reflects upon the nation that selects him and it's not just the leader that will get judged, but the nation.

This is something we see in the Davidic line (why does Israel's united monarchy only last for three reigns?) and something we see in oracles against the nations in the Prophetic texts (Assyria is picked by God to cast judgement upon Israel, so why is Assyria itself judged for its conduct in carrying out this judgement?).

I'd personally argue since all the surviving extra-biblical gospels we have seem to come from a much later period (even ones like the Gospel of Thomas, which is merely a saying Gospel, can convincingly be argued to come from a later date), they don't necessarily hold much relevance in this particular discussion.

That being said, I think you're right insofar as you say He was living there at the time. /u/flowers_grow mentions Capernaum as a sort of home base and that's the explanation I'm familiar with -- Luke also mentions Jesus having relationships that seem akin to patronage so it's not even inconceivable that a follower might have offered up their home to Jesus with enough regularly for it to have been seen as Jesus' home (or simply that a network of followers regularly hosted Jesus  there, so it was seen as His home in a broader sense)."

How would your own country's leadership act if a foreign power unilaterally backed out of an anti-nuclear agreement, spread disinformation about your nation's adherence to this agreement, instituted sanctions to try to create the right conditions for a regime change, and did that while backing your various regional rivals? America has overthrown Latin American governments for less than that. Bush's war in Iraq was started over less than this.

Trump seems to have wanted a war because he thought it would help him get reelection, Iran's response to American military action ended resulting in the deaths of Iranians, Iraqis, Ukrainians, Canadians, Swedes, Afghans, Germans, and Brits. If anything it shows how these regimes undervalue people. Trump does not seem to care about any of this because no Americans were killed and Iran acted like it would have never shot down this plane because there were Iranians on-board -- that there were civilian foreign nationals on board didn't seem to be a big deal.

theology,fdolmpz,t1_fdol1ol,1578607643.0,"Strictly speaking, if the claims of divinity or messiahship hold water, no.

The messiah having the right to overthrow Roman rule doesn’t strike me as particularly controversial claims. Just war theories come about as a theological reflection on New Testament writings and considering what that meant when Christians held power.

Just war theory would look very different if Jesus had been militaristic (and successfully so). To ask if Jesus would have been bound by the restrictions of human made ethics that came as a result of theological reflection of what His ministry meant is always going to result in a “no.”

And of course the answer is of course God isn’t bound by human ethics, not is Jesus, because there’s a multitudes of human ethics to choose from."
theology,fdoifyr,t3_emfdt1,1578605795.0,"Technically speaking, I think the answer (regardless of one’s stance in violence) is technically yes because if the Christian claim about Jesus’ divinity is true, then just war is not a constraint. Ethics is a constraint on human behaviour, but need not be a constraint in God if God chooses for it to be. The peaceable nature of Jesus is not a demonstration of how God *must* act but a demonstration of how God *opted* to act."
theology,fdof48q,t1_fdnhnqz,1578603924.0,"> it safeguards the divinity of Christ. I say this because the ark of the covenant in the old testament was so holy that you could not even approach it unless you were specially prepared. Mary carried God in her very womb, so similarly her womb was incredibly holy, like the ark of the covenant. If you believe that Mary's womb contained the very presence of God and was so holy that she remained a virgin for life, then you can't go on to deny the divinity of Christ, which is what I mean by ""It safeguards the divinity of Christ.""

I don't think the argument made here holds up.

First, from the standpoint of orthodoxy, Jesus is fully human so there's a good case to be made that Mary's womb does not necessarily become inherently special.

Secondly, from the standpoint of Scripture, we know individuals get close to Jesus and even touch Jesus without taking such preparations to no ill-effect so it's not clear why Mary's womb would act that way. The descriptions we have of those coming into contact with Jesus is similar to those coming into contact with Peter post-Pentecost. 

Thirdly, an important aspect to the New Testament is the fundamental different nature holiness takes. The Spirit is giving freely, Jesus is flesh and the old rules of holiness are questioned (Jesus' depiction of holiness is of intermingling with the unclean, not of sanctioning it off away from uncleanliness). 

That being said, as I searched this thread to see if people actually had answers similar to how I understand the issue, this is one that absolutely lines up with my own reading on the topic.

Maybe I'm being uncharacteristically forgiving to Trump, but I'm not the most comfortable with assigning much blame to him on this specific case just because it can read like I'm downplaying the sense of agency within the Iranian military.
