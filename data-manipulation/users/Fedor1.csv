If it’s something like being opposed to a two party system, wouldn’t it make more sense to write in a message that was coordinated with others supporting the cause? If you try to get your message across by not voting, no one will ever know how many people actually support your cause."

Reds,ffjjges,t3_etvp2g,1579999602.0,"I’m hoping Castillo takes the next step and turns into another Cueto. If memory serves, earlier in his career, Cueto racked up the strikeouts and always had a high pitch count early in the game, just like Castillo. Then one year, it seemed like he went 7+ every time he was on the mound. Hopefully Castillo can take some notes."
MMA,ffilj2r,t1_ffih65e,1579976753.0,"Yeah, if Dana actually books the Conor Khabib rematch next, it'll be a slap in the face to a lot of fans and fighters. That said, this sport is hard to always have consistency based on rankings because there's so many things that change in between fights. There's definitely a balance between picking the ""right"" fight, and also making exciting fights that the fans want to see. Up to this point, I don't think there has been too many egregiously undeserved fights, but Conor getting a rematch would certainly be the worst."
MMA,ffil84a,t1_ffies6a,1579976542.0,"Who deserved the shot at the time that Conor got it? The only other person who might have deserved it at the time was Edgar, who had already lost to Aldo."

MMA,ffie84c,t1_ffidb5k,1579971760.0,"Well I know he didn't officially get the shot until after the Siver fight, but here is something I found that says it was a stay busy fight:

https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2014/10/conor-mcgregor-vs-dennis-siver-official-as-ufc-fight-night-59-headliner

> Although McGregor is in Brazil and was expected to fight the winner of Saturday’s UFC 179 headliner between featherweight champion Jose Aldo and Chad Mendes, he’ll instead stay busy with a fight against Siver, who recently picked up a decision victory over Charles Rosa at UFC Fight Night 53. It halted a two-fight winless streak that included a TKO loss to contender Cub Swanson and a no-contest with Manny Gamburyan (Siver’s decision win was overturned when he failed a post-fight drug test due to human chorionic gonadotropin).

I also don't think you can call the Mendes fight a stay busy fight since it was for the interim belt."
NYGiants,ffibymw,t1_ffhykt8,1579970236.0,"I loved Manninghams response. Idk word for word but it was basically, “it was an easy catch because it was a perfect throw”. Yes Manningham played a part by keeping his feet in, but I’d say 95% of WRs are making that catch, because the throw was just so perfect."
MMA,ffibmch,t1_ffia67v,1579970000.0,"Ah ok, yeah idk then. He is a good poker player, so maybe he’s just used to always looking like he doesn’t give a shit lol."
MMA,ffiau5y,t1_ffi9567,1579969460.0,"Wasn't the Siver fight more of stay busy fight, and he had really earned a shot after beating Porier, but wanted to fight again instead of waiting around for Aldo?

I agree with you about Cerrone, and I don't think many rational people here will argue that he deserves a 155 title shot after beating Cerrone, but I don't think him getting the FW shot was that crazy."
MMA,ffia2g0,t1_ffi7wh7,1579968928.0,"Usually we only get to see him when a fight is over, like in this pic, at which time he's trying to get all the info he needs to announce the decision. I think he is just focused on preparing what he needs."
