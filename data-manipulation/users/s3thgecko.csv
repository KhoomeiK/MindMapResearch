I mean, the early Hindus (or aryans) were ancient Europeans, could they've brought some of their beliefs with them? In Europe (and Egypt) the different gods from different mythologies are more or less interchangeable, which would indicate a lot of trading of traditions with each other. Am I completely wrong?"
MadeMeSmile,ffih9be,t1_ffi86cz,1579973831.0,"I think one of the reasons a lot of nazis are stealing norse symbols is that at least swedes have, since a few hundred years back, been taught that vikings were pure Scandinavians and were really heroic and whatnot. This became even a bigger thing during the 19th century with the birth of romantic nationalism. Suddenly vikings were even more subjugated to myths about heroism and deeds and stuff. I really don't get. I wear some norse symbols as necklaces, a raven skull with the aegishjalmur, the vegvisur and a symbol for fenrir. The reason is because of my ancestors who lived in Sweden long before Christianity came here, and before it was called Sweden (I've done my genealogy). Ironically my name is Christian."

interestingasfuck,ffi6l9f,t1_ffi50i8,1579966447.0,"Ohh. Good question. To be fair I can't get my high-school students to read most of any classic literature, but anyways.

I think one of the most well known Swedish authors is August Strindberg, he wrote a lot of stuff and was quite the prolific playwright too. His all-time classic would be Röda Rummet or The Red Room in English. It's a satire of those days society in Stockholm. I'm not super fond of him. I prefer Hjalmar Söderberg, a contemporary of him. His two novels Den Allvarsamma Leken (The Serious Game) and Doktor Glas (Doctor Glas) could have been written nowadays and are almost philosophical in what they're about. The Serious Game is about two people trying to be together but a lot of stuff keep getting in their way. Doctor Glas is about a much beloved doctor who falls for a young woman visiting his practice, but she's already taken, by a priest nonetheless. The conundrum is that he mistreat her, according to her, so the Doctor has to figure out what he can do... It's a tale of morality, one might say.
Karin Boye is another classic author. She was mostly a poet, but wrote a couple of novels. Her most famous novel is called Kallocain. It's a dystopian novel about a very controlled society where people have trouble expressing emotion. She was a closeted homosexual who eventually killed herself because she wasn't allowed to live out her sexuality.
Bare in mind, these are just 20th century authors (Strindberg wrote most of his stuff in the 19th century, though). There are of course swedish authors from earlier years, but their type of writing is (mostly) extremely dated and their language doesn't really work anymore."

MadeMeSmile,ffd05uz,t1_ffcyi9i,1579810822.0,"It's what I hope I can one day do. I lost my little brother in 2013 and the memory of him started to become more happy thoughts, even though I miss him and always will, but then my mom got sick and then she passed and the loss of both my mom and my brother is just too much to bear sometimes. 

I had a son in May of 2018 and that whole experience left me an emotional wreck, as it should, imo, so in May 2018 that happened and in December that year my mom got her cancer diagnosis. Back then it looked hopeful, but just the fact that my mom had gotten that dreaded disease, which everyone fears and hopes never gonna happen to them or their loved ones, made me even more emotional, and then last year, she was near dying a couple of times during chemo until they decided to stop with the treatment because it was doing more harm than good. Then in June her colon burst and she had to have an emergency operation and nearly died again. After that operation the doctors told us she didn't have a chance to survive and it was only a matter of time. And a week before her passing her liver was showing really bad test results, so she got morphine and whatever pain relief she wanted and it effected her really much. She was happy, but I could barely have a conversation with her, which made me really upset. I've never seen my mom drunk or out of herself. She's always been real easy to talk to and so seeing her out of it really did my head in. So, the last week, when I realized it was only a matter of days or even hours I was so upset. I found myself at one point banging my head and crying after my mom. My wife had to calm me down. On wednesday, her last week, I called her, and my stepdad answered and said that she was too tired and out of it to talk, which made me really sad and upset. In the evening she called me up and we talked for a little bit and I said that I just wanted to say that I love her and that she's been the best mom anyone could ask for. She just replied: ""Well, I know that, silly, you don't have to tell me."" The day before her passing I was there and she could barely speak, just look at me and sort of smile. I was really upset and started crying, which I knew she didn't need at that point, but before I left I told her that she didn't have to worry about me or my son or anything else, because we would take care of everything. 

I think about her all the time. I just wanna call her and talk to her. I just hurts so much."

Around midsummer last year her colon broke and they had to do an emergency operation to remove the tumor in the colon, the tumor in her liver they couldn't do anything about. At that time they told us that it was a real possibility she wouldn't make the operation because of the state she was in, dehydrated, in pain, etc. I set my mind to her not making it so I wouldn't be crushed. She did make it however, but after that the doctors told us that it was just a matter of time, but she was feeling quite good, so, I just sort of didn't wanna hear it. And in the beginning of October her liver readings were coming back really bad and a week later she feel asleep and didn't wake up. No pain."

In comparison all other European languages are related and have some connections, but Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian are totally isolated. They're not related to Slavic languages either. However, on the Finnish western coast there is a lot of people speaking Swedish, since Finland was under Swedish rule for a really long time. However, in the rest of Finland, swedish isn't really appreciated."

MadeMeSmile,feobzk0,t3_eq3vnx,1579297952.0,"I'm a teacher. In Sweden, so the pay is quite good and my students wouldn't have to raise money to buy me something really expensive. However, I can be real sensitive, despite looking like a member of Hells Angels (several students have told me this). So, back in 2013, when my first class graduated the equivalent of junior high, I balled my eyes out. I had written a speech beforehand and I think I got thru two sentences before I started crying and the students all started crying too. Even the ""tough"" kids. I mean, for them it was emotional because they were leaving for another school and some of them had gone together for 9 or 10 years and now they wouldn't, but I didn't help things. This happened the following years too, me crying at every graduation ä, but then it stopped. Until last year, ugly crying with the students who were also ugly crying and wouldn't leave the school grounds. Bittersweet."

Runt midsommar sprack hennes tjocktarm, där tumören satt, så de opererade bort tumören och satte in stomi, men tumören hade spridit sig till levern och ökat i storlek, men sen var det ganska lugnt ett par tre månader och sen hade tumören växt igen och sen tog det en vecka från besked att det inte var långt kvar. Jag är fortfarande chockad av den där veckan, eftersom jag trodde på mer tid, men det tror/hoppas man nog alltid på. Så, det är mitt råd till dig, op, ta vara på precis all tid, men det vet du ju redan. Berätta hur mycket du älskar din pappa, även om det blir tjatigt eller din pappa tycker du är fånig. Under den sista veckan för min mamma var hon väldigt trött och ville inte ha besök eller telefonsamtal av nån, men jag ringde ändå och på kvällen ringde hon upp och mellan mina tårar lyckades jag få fram att hon var världens bästa mamma och att jag älskade henne mer än nånting annat. Hon sa bara: Det vet jag väl. Sån var hon. Jag saknar henne så fruktansvärt mycket. Nu blev det tårar här."

Det jobbiga är i situationer där jag känner att jag ska ringa mamma, men så kommer jag direkt på att det inte går. Det är som att jag glömmer bort i en halv sekund att hon är borta. Sånt blir ju lättare med tiden, vilket känns sorgligt det också. 

Jag drömde om mamma veckan efter hon dog. Jag skulle jobba i samma enorma kontorsbyggnad som hon, men vi träffades aldrig, utan pratade bara i telefon. Jag letade efter henne i huset, men hade henne bara i telefon. Kändes lite symptomatiskt för tillståndet i verkligheten."

Up here in the Nordic countries, Christianity didn't gain that many followers until the 12th century and it was a peaceful conversion. The Christian churches were mainly built on the old norse places of worship and sacrificing. Seems a bit disrespectful, but most people didn't seem to mind, besides it was done so it would be easier to go to church. (besides trying to remove the old heathen gods)"
