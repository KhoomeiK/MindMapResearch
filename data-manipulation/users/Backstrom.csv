However, now I've almost sized myself out of the stores around me. The large and up sections are soooo big at the few stores that I shop. The medium (and soon small!!!!) sections are about 1/4 the size. I'm not even small. I'm still overweight."
fatlogic,fffhjwv,t1_fffe4nm,1579884105.0,Im right with you. I bought a whole new wardrobe last year and I'm about to do it again this year. But I guess it's a good problem to have.
fatlogic,fffgbl4,t3_et9m7n,1579883340.0,This is refreshing. Most posts here are more or less saying the same few points. I like when someone mixes it up with a new kind of stupid.

I might have Flartzen's Syndrome. I've never heard of it because as far as I know, it doesn't exist. But if it did, I wouldn't know about it. But my doctor might catch it if I give them all my symptoms."
science,ff7dhh8,t1_ff6knc2,1579647027.0,"It would be tough to prove causally, yes. And such a study may not be able to be performed on humans. But you can statistically control for them very easily. 


The fact is that people carry fat in different ways. If people's underlying health indicators (BP, blood sugar, BMI, etc) are relatively equal, this may indicate that the person that stores fat primarily in their stomach is more at risk.


If a strong, unexplained correlation exists between belly fat and heart attacks, more study may need to be done to determine the mechanism that is causing that."
science,ff6fxqh,t1_ff6eu6i,1579626342.0,"That's actually not what they're saying. They're saying that even if you control for all of those negative factors that we know of, more belly fat STILL means more negative outcomes. 


This suggests that there's something there that we are not capturing yet. It very well may be that the fat itself has some kind of interaction that we haven't studied yet"

fatlogic,feobu6w,t3_eq1ksj,1579297866.0,"I hate that crazy ""fat activists"" and radical HAES have tainted what I believe to be an important and worthwhile cause. 


I have been fat my whole life. I know what it's like. Despite what some people around here may proclaim, I think there is a need for the original Fat Acceptance movement. 


People definitely ARE discriminated against based on weight and appearance, and not only in arenas in which fitness or appearance are relevant. I think we should fight to treat everyone with respect and to have everyone love themselves wherever they are. I don't think that fatness or thinness should be conflated with personality traits. And we could all probably be more empathetic towards those that suffer the difficulties of living life while very fat. I think this is where the movement started: a quest towards universal self love and acceptance. And this in itself can lead to positive changes and growth. 


However, now it's warped and twisted to a point where it's not even recognizable anymore. Promoting obesity, ignoring science, learned helplessness, judgment of dissenting opinions, and all the other negative garbage you see on here. It's gotten so far from a fight for tolerance and acceptance and love. Now, it's almost impossible to argue a stance of acceptance without condoning or promoting it. You get yelled at from one side for not being radical (or crazy) enough and the other side for being associated with those ignorant fucks."

nfl,fdpahe3,t1_fdp99a3,1578623797.0,"I mean, he took a huge gamble and completely redid the team to fit his players. Mid-season last year, he realized that he had a superweapon that couldn't be used optimally in the system we had. So last year, and even more so in this off-season, he changed the plan to best utilize the talents of his team. And he used a plan that very few teams have used recently. If that's not being a good coach, I don't know what is."

I see Judon as one of those classic Ravens system guys who do really well with us and then get overpaid with someone else. That's not to say I don't like him. He's been great this year. But the Ravens have a history of having players have transcendent years in the framework of a good defense and are then not able to replicate that in another environment. I hope we can keep him, but I wouldn't predict him putting up the same stats with someone else."

If you are required to be there for 15 minutes early and 5 minutes late, you need to be paid for that time. However, as you have worded it, it sounds like your boss deducted time for not doing that extra time. Which is also illegal."
