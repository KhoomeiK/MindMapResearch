It's not whatsoever. In other subjects, I've had lecturers stop and ask if the student understood the way they were explaining it and if they wanted them to try to explain it in a different way.

I don't know where you're from, but it's obviously not the UK. In the UK, you can study a degree at university that you have never studied before. That is why university courses here assume zero knowledge and start from the basics.

A specific example I remember was during a networking module, my friend was struggling with the concept of ACLs and the lecturer was trying to explain them in a ridiculous overly-complicated way that obviously wasn't helping my friend understand at all. I told them that they're just like bouncers in a nightclub and they got it straight away. It's easy to explain things when you're able to interact with other people in a normal way."

Every subject on Earth has different levels of complexity. That's not unique to programming.

>And I'm sure where you get the idea from that programmers claim that you need to be a genius to do what they do.

I never said that. I said that the general public think that you have to be a genius to be a programmer because programmers are so bad at explaining programming.

>hen explaining something specific you shouldn't take 2 hours to explain it.

You should if it needs two hours to explain it. That's what every other subject on Earth does."
AskReddit,ffwi2j9,t1_ffwf7yq,1580301739.0,"> They seem cryptic because it is explained under the assumption that the person getting the explanation already knows the basics

Again, another problem that only affects the nerd dominated subjects. Most other people know to explain new concepts from nothing.

Programming is no more difficult then any other subject, in fact, the basic skills of problem-solving are used in almost every walk of life. Yet somehow nerds routinely fail at getting this point across and lead the general public to think programming is something you need to be a genius to do, when it isn't."
