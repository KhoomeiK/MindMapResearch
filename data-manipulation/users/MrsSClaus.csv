Keto_Food,fh6j3us,t1_fh4tigq,1581299824.0,Cheese would be awesome.
YouShouldKnow,fgrezaw,t1_fgrdesq,1581045181.0,Harris was the best. Seriously that character was one of my favs. And Hooks probably lol.
YouShouldKnow,fgr3pox,t1_fgr0f5m,1581037442.0,80’s slap stick comedy movies. Raunchy. Funny. Ridiculous. Absolutely fabulous.
YouShouldKnow,fgr3mdh,t1_fgqymre,1581037384.0,Omg that would be so cool. Any ideas for casting?!
namenerds,fgr0xul,t3_ezx50o,1581035718.0,Lucian or Lucien is a very southern name in my opinion. One of my favs actually.
GastricBypass,fgoz7cz,t3_ezkga0,1580992575.0,Almost a year out and I’ve experienced dumping syndrome once due to excessive sugar which is 100% my own fault. I wouldn’t change my decision to have surgery at all. Down 108 pounds and to say it’s life changing is such an understatement. Yes the benefits completely outweigh the negatives. Good luck and don’t let little nagging what if thoughts deter you from being the best you. It’s not worth it.
slowcooking,fgeaemy,t1_fgcxn5a,1580695047.0,Damn that sounds/looks amazing.
IsItBullshit,fg9vd68,t1_fg8m27o,1580643598.0,Meh it’s not as hard as you think in a target at least. At restaurant maybe but target mainly sells snacky food. Difficult to f that up too much.
IsItBullshit,fg9v5fp,t1_fg8oanp,1580643501.0,I’m guessing you’ve never been in a target. Target is a big store that sells prepackaged food. Amounts other things. Most targets have a little cafe as well where some people walk by and buy snacks. But when we baked fresh cookies and popped fresh popcorn the yummy smells would draw people in the buy the fresh items. Does that make better sense now?
GastricBypass,fg8097e,t3_exd7q9,1580606069.0,I brought a stuffed animal. Less lonely in the night.
namenerds,fg7npdp,t1_fg7lwuf,1580596958.0,Very cool middle name.
namenerds,fg7niw8,t1_fg7nae8,1580596830.0,"Lol feel free. I think you’re taking this exchange a tiny bit too serious. I just disagree with you plain and simple. That’s all. But feel free to do/say whatever you need to in order to feel superior. Also, you’re super welcome."
