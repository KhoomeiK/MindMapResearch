What we don’t know is how the number is taken apart and processed to create various ship bits. I suspect that the ship decompiler inside every space station gives us a clue when we see the exploded view, but that is a hunch on my part.

Unfortunately, the ship construction table is a complete mystery and I’m not a C# person, so I can’t tear apart the code and reconstruct one.

My theory goes like this: the number is a 64-bit unsigned hex integer which is converted to a string. Then parts of that string are taken out, converted back to an unsigned int and compared either to a table or a series of switch statements to arrive at a graphic element id, which is then composed back into a ship.
