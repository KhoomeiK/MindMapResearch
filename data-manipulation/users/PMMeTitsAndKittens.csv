You're trying to somehow make it seem like I'm marginalizing, when really I'm not at all and you appear to want to have someone to debate with about this. If you want to find someone who doesn't think this law is ridiculous and completely open to being abused in multiple ways because of vagueness and difficultly in proper enforcement you're going to have to look somewhere else.

Also, don't try to read into my personality from a throwaway comment about how no one on reddit actually reads linked articles. It just makes you look ornery."

worldnews,ffaleb6,t1_ffaks4n,1579738664.0,"Well I think the ""intended"" intentions are probably for cases where the parents have already consented to the marriage and the ""couple"" consummate before then, so that they don't face legal repercussions.

I suppose it's one of those cases where the practice became less common, but the term stayed the same because people are so used to it.

Genuinely curious though, in your first language (assuming it isn't English), would there be a distinction in terms between an arranged marriage that was still ultimately up to the couple to consent to and one where the family forced them into it?"
worldnews,ffagkjd,t1_ffaetiw,1579735249.0,"Dude stop adding to your comments after I reply to them, that's just ridiculous. 

Also, you're being extremely obtuse in not recognizing the huge grey area here, wherein one's morality can affect one's support for or against legislation.

 At what point does a law against euthanasia become a religious law? Do we ask everyone who voted why they feel that way, or if it was influenced by a book? If we find that the majority of people who voted against euthanasia did so because they have an innate belief in the value of life, but a minority did so because religion tells them suicide is wrong, is it only a partially religious law?"
worldnews,ffafnb0,t1_ffaetiw,1579734629.0,"That's a huge can of worms to open and that calls into question the secularism of pretty much any country that professes to be so because of the huge role that religions have played in the development of what we consider to be morality and justice.

But beyond that, literally all I was saying is Erdogan and the people in power in Turkey currently want to turn the country into an Islamic state, which it isn't. To do that they would have to fundamentally alter the Turkish constitution, which isn't going to happen any time soon.

This isn't even a religious law, if anything it's a cultural one. It is in line with pretty much all of the Abrahamic religions, though, which all support child marriage if the parents consented to it.

This headline is just like the headlines you see about some nobody trying to pass a ridiculous law in the US. Great way to get views, but is it gonna pass? Did this law pass last time it was tried a few years ago? Not at all.

If you really wanted to be 'not so intelligent' like me, maybe you would do some research and see that people are registered as Muslim for the purposes of census and statistics gathering in Turkey by default, and a huge part of the population, especially the younger generations, are really only Muslim in name."
worldnews,ffaelk7,t1_ffaeapv,1579733842.0,"You can have a secular country where a group of people want laws based on their religious beliefs. Turkey is by definition and by law secular, just like the United States is secular. 

Not really sure how to preserve democracy in that case without tipping the scales towards religious discrimination."
worldnews,ffae6l5,t1_ffadw66,1579733512.0,"Well if we're using his definition, that's the person's own fault for choosing to rush into marriage. If it's their choice, then why rush into things?"
worldnews,ffae0e6,t1_ffadt97,1579733375.0,"So you're agreeing with what I said, it's arranged dating. What part about arranged marriage is arranged if it's all on the people who are going to get married to choose if and who to they get married?"
worldnews,ffadmre,t1_ffabg6c,1579733087.0,"Yeah hilarious, but that doesn't change the laws on the books, or the constitution of Turkey, which is more important than your perception of how the country operates."
worldnews,ffadblv,t1_ffacqj7,1579732865.0,"Having a personal spirituality is neutral. Gold the metal is neutral.

When a bunch of people get together and organize a whole system based on using spirituality, that's an organized religion. When a bunch of people get together and organize a whole system based on using gold, that's money.

Money, like organized religion can be used for a lot of good things, and a lot of bad things.

When gold is co-opted into a currency, it can do good or bad things. When spirituality is co-opted into an organized religion, it can do good or bad things.

Personal spirituality can also be good or bad, but when it's kept to that level it's generally neutral. As alluded to in the post you're commenting on and your own comment, what makes the difference is a question of scale.

No one can really argue that the element gold is inherently good or bad, but plenty of people can and do argue that organized religion or money is the root of all evil.

worldnews,ffac6cq,t1_ffabvz0,1579732080.0,"Well your definition of arranged marriage is pretty useless in the real world, just wanted to point that out.

Also, just FYI the first paragraph of the article mentions that the law is only in regards to statutory rape, so if the parents were already planning on marrying off the child it would be the same as an arranged marriage with an underaged party, the only difference being they wouldn't have to wait to consummate to avoid legal repercussions."
worldnews,ffabmz3,t1_ffaalbb,1579731737.0,"Well then they really shouldn't call them arranged marriages should they?

If you have that amount of time in FO4 you'll probably be able to see the difference in quest and dialogue quality pretty quickly, it's night and day.
