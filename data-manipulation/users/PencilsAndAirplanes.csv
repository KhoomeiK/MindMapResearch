Professors,ffr7w5y,t3_eu8buq,1580152377.0,"Agree that the department admins are the glue that holds everything else together.  I've never understood why some academics don't understand how critical it is to foster good relationships with administrative staff. After all, y'all know how to make things happen, you have our backs when we need it, and you know where ALL the bodies are buried."
GradSchool,ffpqxtz,t3_euffri,1580102577.0,"Everyone who teaches eventually runs into a situation where we're covering new material and it feels like we're making shit up as we go along. It's nerve-wracking, but it's unavoidable if you do the job long enough. You just got your trial-by-fire early. 

Borrow a course outline, come up with a syllabus based on that, and then study your ever-loving ass off. If the students are talented, flip the classroom and put them in charge of their learning. Make them present the material and/or lead discussions for at least part of the time. It's NEVER your job to spoon-feed the material to your students, anyway... you're just the guide and evaluator. You just need a means of evaluating them, and if you've got teaching experience this part should be pretty straightforward. 

Just do it. You'll all survive... I promise."

CalPolyPomona,ff992nk,t1_ff6n4dj,1579707656.0,I’d make sure your professor is okay with this before trying it. There’s a fine line between persistent and pushy.
CalPolyPomona,ff97lqy,t3_es3pv7,1579706711.0,"On chilly days you may be stuck with the food court across the quad. Once the weather improves, head out behind building 1 and you'll find a lawn with a couple tables and deer that sometimes wander down the hill—it’s one of my favorite paper-grading spots. Someone else mentioned building 94; the interior courtyard has quite a bit of outdoor seating."
CalPolyPomona,ff96974,t3_es9yk8,1579705829.0,Definitely email your professors. If the class has a waiting list I have to drop no-shows.
AskProfessors,ff8e504,t3_epx7rw,1579674669.0,"I was the nerdy kid who got beat up all the time in school. As an undergraduate, I failed my public speaking class *twice.* Eventually, I found a friend who was a theater major and also taught speech as an adjunct. He helped me get over the initial panic, and in my upper-division work, I started getting “put up” to making small-group presentations. A lot. 

Fast-forward twenty years. Subject matter competence is important, but students want to know I’m human and I’m trying to connect with what they need. I try not to drone on (it’s exhausting for me AND them), and I use my pratfalls to demonstrate how it’s okay to not be perfect as long as you’re genuine. Be THAT and people will listen. Especially if you have stories of your own. 

Oh... first days and random days can still be unexpectedly difficult. Just remind yourself that they can’t attack you and do your best."

flying,ff5ubub,t1_ff5hyqa,1579610522.0,"Ah, okay—it appears I’ve commented on two of your threads. As it turns out, this is not the first time I’ve heard of that same objection. The first was from someone in one of the FAA district offices down here, who was refusing to grant provider approvals at the same time I was attempting to get my new flight school set up. It made for a slow and maddening process for us, and to the extent that it's having a discriminatory effect on you, I’m sorry—that sucks. 

That being said, the reluctance of your CFI to become a provider may simply be more of a business decision. In the TSA system, providers who operate under part 61 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (this is the type of training you most likely want to use) get set up either as an independent CFI, or as a school headed up by a primary CFI. My school is a business entity with my business partner functioning as our “chief” instructor, so we applied that way and I submit my students under that account. Flying clubs are usually far more loosely organized, so each CFI would probably apply on their own. Like I mentioned before, the setup process was kind of a pain, and although I haven’t experienced exactly the same issues your instructor friend is concerned about, I guess I can also see where an independent CFI might not want to bother—especially if that CFI is already as busy as they want to be.

So, for you, the process of finding a school needs to begin with the question of whether the operation is set up to train foreign students. In the Bay Area it doesn’t seem like that should be hard to find. People in the other thread recommended Aerodynamic Aviation, and having flown with them a time or two I'd do the same. The instructors I met were excellent, they offer training you won’t find everywhere (tailwheel, aerobatic), and they have a cool fleet. Totally worth the phone call. 

Good luck and hope to see you in the air soon."
flying,ff5hw55,t1_ff5gxmu,1579593615.0,"No, and I don’t know anyone else who has. Not sure why this would be such a concern."
flying,ff5h71l,t3_eqxr90,1579592711.0,"If you need TSA approval, you MUST get it from the school or CFI you train with. There are no exceptions to that rule. The approval is tied to a provider and is not transferable. 

If you like this club and their costs are reasonable, ask them to get set up with TSA. It’s really not all that big a deal. 

If they refuse, you pretty much have to go elsewhere—sorry."
flying,ff5fr7i,t1_ff51hk1,1579590923.0,"Our TSA auditor said we can do a discovery flight, but we should not allow the student to log that flight as dual instruction."
flying,ff5fo8o,t3_erj1iu,1579590819.0,"I’m in Southern California, so being able to submit students for TSA approval goes with the territory. You are already giving your primary students an endorsement of U.S. citizenship. Once you’re set up in the system as a training provider, the rest of the process isn’t all that difficult; the student creates an account, makes a training request, then you log in and validate the request. At some point they pay the fee and submit fingerprints. Once they're approved, you take and upload a photo, and they're good to go. 

Tips for audits: Keep copies of citizenship documents for citizens, and documents and approvals for foreign students. Remember to do the annual security training TSA already expects of all your staff, and keep copies of those certificates. That's all we do, and our audit consisted of five minutes of paperwork, and 20 minutes of BSing about vintage ragwings."

flying,fepfi04,t3_eq07l3,1579319203.0,"I got my AGI about a year before my CFI, and I taught two classroom-based ground school courses before I flew my checkride. I cannot recommend a better way to prepare for the CFI oral. Two recommendations: First, enlist the aid of a CFI friend who wants to score a few new students, and ask them to pitch in and help the first time through. Second, be sure you consult 61.105(b) as you develop your syllabus to make sure you don’t miss anything. 

Oh, and don’t be afraid to tell people you don’t know the answer to something, but you’ll find out and get back to them. It helps your students trust you. Good luck!"
catsinpants,feolnv9,t3_eq4vv1,1579301927.0,Can confirm. It’s like growing a furry appendage.
trains,feolhzi,t3_epzgmb,1579301852.0,You should be proud of this picture. Thank you for sharing it.
flying,fej7p9j,t3_eox3wh,1579160404.0,"I’m an experienced pilot, a CFI, and also a college professor (in a different field), so it’s probably safe to say I’m a serial educator. I'm also one of the owners at our part 61 school, and I teach our classroom-based ground school classes. 

CFI pay is laughable given the responsibility. The hours depend on the environment, but as the managing partner of our company mine are similarly ridiculous. The job, however, is the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done. I teach people how to defy gravity. I help them make their dreams come true. I pass on the legacy that was entrusted to me when I got hooked on aviation as a kid at this very same airport. And when I have a few spare moments, I get to wrench on our airplanes (under supervision), share aviation with kids in the community, and work on ways to get more women into the field. Oh, and I also own some cool airplanes. 

So... if you’re actually excited at the prospect of being a CFI, welcome. Stick around and keep learning, and you'll be right up there with the best."

flying,fdswz34,t3_emzn2o,1578709023.0,"Congrats on passing your oral. My first bust was on my CFI oral (totally shot myself in the foot), but I didn't fly worth a damn on my commercial ride and I was shocked when I passed. 

Checkride busts happen. Lick your wounds for tonight, go fly for fun in the next day or so, and then get the first possible appointment for your re-take. They're usually straightforward, and if you pursue a CFI, this will make you a better one."
