facepalm,ffhzwwv,t3_etql6y,1579960754.0,"A long time ago I was in school and a fellow student proposed this. It was explained that airplanes wouldn’t work because the jet engines required oxygen. 

They then said they thought the airplanes were running on steam engines because of the trails in the sky. 

Steam airplanes to Mars was a theme that year. (1986)

Thanks for the memories."

When my wife leaves on business, I become the typical male and eat large amounts of bad food, drink beer, and watch violent movies.  I will occasionally go shoot pool and try to act like I know what I am doing but am just having an off day.
