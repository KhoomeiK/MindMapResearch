worldnews,ff59ao0,t1_ff58fq3,1579584105.0,"Some of the media stuff isn't really unprecedented, but:

C-SPAN won't control cameras in the chamber; we expect a tight shot on whoever is speaking at the podium. 

That converges with no electronics in the gallery, which means no other images will be taken (other member reactions, interactions, etc). Also means no live tweet coverage going on. 

Importantly, media will not be allowed to interact with outside of Chambers in the halls. They're relegated to a roped off area adjacent; senators will have to approach them to take questions. 

They've also limited arguments to 24 hours for each side, but split over just two days for each (so, 12 hours of arguments in one day on the floor). 

This will be followed by 16 hours of questions from senators. Then 4 hours of discussion. 

Only then will the Senate address the question of whether or not there may be witnesses or testimony for this trial."

TwoXChromosomes,ff4i437,t1_ff4enoz,1579564159.0,"Yep. It's health INSURANCE, not a health care plan. It is way more expensive than most of us feel it should be, but it does insure against catastrophe for most cases."
TwoXChromosomes,ff4hs62,t1_ff44b36,1579563934.0,"The issue is per capita spending is now over $10,000 annual, which means that if we didn't have deductibles and didn't charge people more based on age/health, a family of four would need to pay over $3,000 a month in premiums/taxes to cover the beast.

If we say charging the elderly 3x as much as everyone else is fair, since their healthcare costs are so high, then their costs would be like $1,700 / mo and the family of four would only need to contribute like $2,300 /mo to keep no deductible insurance solvent.

This, of course, assumes no one would consume more health services than they do under the current system. If they do, then we'd need more put in per person than we do with our current system that has many avoid seeing the doctor. (not accounting for potential savings in getting health care sooner before a condition progresses)

Unfortunately, high deductibles and copays are the only way to push premiums downward (aside from overhauling health care itself)."

True, but total deaths include civilian population, and I'm not sure its totally fair to compare civilian deaths in a country a war took place in with civilian deaths in a country 8,000 km away.
