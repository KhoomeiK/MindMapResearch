fatlogic,fejbq1s,t3_epekuo,1579165980.0,"I understand that there are big people who struggle with restrictive eating. But the fact of the matter is, to be medically diagnosed with anorexia, you have to have a BMI that puts you in the underweight category... so I’m curious as to how this person came to be diagnosed with a restrictive ED?"
fatlogic,fej4l9j,t1_feidkeo,1579156682.0,Same here.
fatlogic,fec17pi,t1_fealmeu,1578965154.0,"This. So many FAs seem to believe there’s no in-between. Sometimes (in my case, anyway) it’s literally been a matter of gaining 5kgs. 5kgs, not 50kgs..."
progresspics,fdjaiqc,t1_fdhqwyq,1578463297.0,"Yep, and I still do!"
Art,fdc32l8,t1_fdbxpag,1578266118.0,"Even by our standards, these fires are out of control."
Art,fdc2zyo,t1_fdbztlp,1578266078.0,They’re not dumb as bricks. They’re incredibly intelligent creatures. Humans have just fucked up their habitat so rapidly and so consistently that they haven’t been able to adapt quickly enough to protect themselves.
Art,fdbw22g,t1_fdbtrd1,1578262774.0,"Yes, but the scale of these fires is unprecedented. It’s hard to focus on the long term environmental benefits when we’ve lost more than 1.1 million hectares since September, and when dozens of our native species, many of which are already endangered, have lost more than 95% of their habitat."
Art,fdbstft,t1_fdbdkir,1578261488.0,"No. Fire as a concept may have its natural benefits, but just no. This fire season is not ‘good’ for Australia, not in any way, shape, or form."
Art,fdbsnrs,t1_fdbkjt9,1578261390.0,She’s... she’s a eucalyptus tree? That’s what a gum tree looks like...?
Art,fdbsjhp,t1_fdbpsrk,1578261315.0,"No. It’s not going to be like the Amazon fires. My home is literally turning to ash. Thousands of people have lost their homes, their livelihood, their history. The death toll is rising every day, and I can’t remember what it feels like to wake up and not smell smoke. Trust me, what you’re seeing on social media doesn’t even scratch the surface."
Art,fdbsb64,t1_fdbny0o,1578261165.0,"I don’t know, most people in Australia are on the brink of tears right about now."
Art,fdbrs1n,t1_fdbmg2o,1578261034.0,"We have a fire season that’s pretty rough compared to most other countries almost every year. This artwork was originally done last year, but I saw that the artist has reposted it on her social media because, well... it’s almost more relevant now than when she originally drew it."
Art,fdbrgyq,t1_fdbpt0t,1578260852.0,"But... she’s a eucalyptus tree. Her colouring isn’t meant to be interpreted as representing a white Australian or an Indigenous Australian, it’s meant to represent the colour and texture of a gum tree. If she were made to look like an Indigenous Australian, she wouldn’t look like a gum tree...?"
Art,fdbr7gb,t1_fdbf0gc,1578260670.0,"As an Australian, I totally agree. They understand the Australian land so much better than the rest of us could ever hope to."
Art,fdbqzzi,t1_fdbmqdz,1578260527.0,What?
Art,fdbqwze,t1_fdbjsph,1578260468.0,"You’re not wrong, but these fires have revealed how fragile the future of the species actually is, and has been for some time now. A lot of us over here are genuinely concerned that the little guys may never recover from this."
progresspics,fcv9nv9,t1_fctew5r,1577997544.0,Thank you for your concern! I have no intention to lose anymore weight... I’m focusing now on building muscle!
