Want to get away from poor mental health, so I try hard to get better, even done things I never did before, but end up getting hurt again.."
depression,ff5qpx5,t3_ermt16,1579606423.0,"Yes, feel bad. But I think is better than keep things inside... I don't know... 

I accidentally been vulnerable to my crush last year, he found me annoying and blocked me on everything... I feel deeply regret and depressed. 

Maybe the person we talk to really matter. But sometimes, there isn't anyone can really be our side or caring us... Life tough."

depression,fc4ysnc,t3_efyc5z,1577434378.0,"I stil have obsession even after rejection.Thinking we can also be friend. 

Few days ago, after seeing his Facebook photos, I got many jealous, upset, and sad feeling, then I texted my feeling to him. He possibly got angry, and he blocked me on Facebook and WhatsApp. 

I am depply regret now, maybe I should just stop thinking about him or talk to him... But, for me, isn't that easy to meet someone I like. My mental health is kinnda worst before and I am not very good at social, so I never really have kind of long term relationship... 

This kind of desire make me become obsess, and I don't think the healthy person can understand it."
