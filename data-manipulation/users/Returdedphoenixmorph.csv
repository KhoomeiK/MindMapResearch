Sardonicast,ffqc7ln,t3_euajhd,1580130014.0,"Unfortunately I think it's almost inevitable for a podcast branded around cynicism (Even if it's mostly hyperbolic and played for laughs) to have large amounts of toxicity in it's fanbase. It's even more amplified with the combination of three seperate fanbases for three youtubers who are (unfortunately) often only seen as ""cynical"" and ""edgy"", and have a lot of younger people in their fanbases. Lots of youtuber fanbases suffer from this (The Red Letter Media fanbase is insufferable in my opinion) and I think a lot of it is just circlejerking without thought. It's a shame, because for a podcast where the hosts talk about films in passionate and insightful manner, there's not a lot of those types of discussions on this sub :/"

SiegeAcademy,ffq0cyp,t3_eui1pq,1580113542.0,"Echo gives in my opinion, far better intel, as your teammates can move around your cameras and use them effectively even if you're dead or just not on them. The high angle and their cloaking also naturally aids his intel capabilities, whereas Maestro's camera is only moveable by him, and has a much smaller view. However it can see through smoke, and is harder to destroy in some cases. 

They both have strong primary weapons, and strong secondaries. They both have barbed wire which suits them well, but Echo has a deployable shield and Maestro has an impact grenade. Maestro already has soft destruction with his shotgun revolver, so taking the impacts on him is generally not needed in my opinion so that's another bonus. 

Maestro can destroy gadgets and damager attackers, but Echo disorientates them and denies planting. Echo can also only fire two shots from each drone until they have to recharge which means you have to use them well. Maestro can fire for much longer, but his cameras are vulnerable while shooting, so you need to be careful with them. 

They're both incredibly strong operators, and in my opinion Echo is a bit more flexible, as he can place his drones in new locations quickly, whereas Maestro can't adapt in the middle of the round like that. So if you're familiar with a Maestro set up on a site than he's much stronger in general, whereas Echo can adapt to most sites in general."

movies,fecrown,t1_fecrfz6,1578982067.0,"I don't know the name, but it sounds like what a lot of transgender films are like. My main issue with most movies about transgender people is that they're predominantly not made for and by trans people, and often just lead into misery porn.

 There was a movie called Girl which was largely criticised for being gratuitous misery porn, but it was based around the life of a transgender woman who said that the film was accurate to her feelings and experiences. So there is generally truth to how hard transitioning is, but it's often handled in the wrong tone and it's frustrating that basically the only well known or prominent depictions of transgender people in media is either negative or pitying."

And you should always keep in mind that it's just a game. As long as you're not letting it negatively impact other aspects of your life, then you should be fine, just try not to get too hung up on it."
SiegeAcademy,fdcho5a,t3_ekmi70,1578275144.0,"He's probably one of the strongest defenders at the moment, he's just not used effectively enough. I feel that people would be calling him overpowered more frequently if the average player who had him used him well, sort of like Maverick on launch from what I've heard. 

Like Smoke, he can block off entry into site from a certain angle. This is incredibly useful in bomb, especially when the attackers are making a last minute push. Unlike Smoke though, he doesn't have to stay alive to use them, he can just place them down any time, even at the start of the round, and then he's done his job. His teammates can use them just as well as he can, which means he has flexibility in what you do with him afterwards. 

The fact that he also has three deployable shields is crazy, and if you let your team know that, then they can pick other secondary gadgets more freely. 

He also has two of the best defending guns at the moment, the vector and the tcsg. The vector has an incredibly high fire rate, and the tcsg has an acog. 

Overall he's good because he's got strong entry denial, team utility, strong weapons, he's a two speed and he's relatively new, so most players don't know how to or will think of countering him. I suspect he will get a nerf sometime in the near future, but at the moment, he's probably one of the strongest defenders you could have."
