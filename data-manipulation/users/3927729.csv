news,ffq46zl,t1_ffoyg9q,1580119517.0,And there are more car deaths because people ignore the safety rules (speeding and seatbelts)
news,ffq45hd,t1_ffnpy8r,1580119447.0,And that’s including the fact that nobody wears seat belts. Car crashes really aren’t that bad if you do things the way they should be done. You’ll most likely survive.
news,ffq44h3,t1_ffnpbmo,1580119405.0,Not if you wear your seat belt. Don’t underestimate how few people actually wear seat belts. Seatbelts save lives. The statistics are terrible because people can’t be fucking bothered to put their seat belts on. People literally refuse when I tell them to.

news,ffq3ha3,t1_ffnzcoz,1580118362.0,Why don’t people think a bit more when they say this? Car death statistics include the fact that most people don’t wear seatbelts and lots of people drive unsafely. If you just don’t act like an idiot your chances of dying in a car are much lower than a helicopter.
news,ffq36xw,t1_ffoca90,1580117898.0,And what if you account for actually wearing your seatbelt? The driving statistics include the fact that 90% of car crash victims aren’t buckled up.

news,ffpnmwr,t1_ffoq3fj,1580099653.0,Cars have bad statistics because most people don’t wear seat belts. And lots of people drive dangerously or intoxicated. If you drive like you’re supposed to your chance of death is a hundred times lower than the statistics.

gifs,ffpe5yv,t1_ffolggj,1580092802.0,"That was more than a few months ago but I thought of that too. Regardless of what people say, I don’t deem helicopters safe in the slightest. You can’t compare the stats to car deaths either. Because if you take out people who drive drunk and people who don’t wear seat belts, the number of car deaths would go down literally a hundred fold. So just wear your seat belt and don’t drive drunk. Much safer than helicopter."
