KOTORmemes,fgn85rk,t1_fgmo9hh,1580939505.0,"If youd played the game (and downvoting the other dude for disagreeing is not what downvotes were made for. Hes not being an ass. That's what downvotes are for.) Then youd know he was enslaved but he controlled the emperor while enslaved. 300 years of mind fuck torture and he manipulates the one torturing him? That's pretty accurate to the character imo. And yes in the main game hes a side boss. Then they made an expansion where he was the focus. A good 10 hours where you're working your way to bring him down. Once there shit happens and it's pretty true to character again. I agree it's not perfect. I would much rather KotOR 3. But it's not as awful as you make it out to be. If you have no interest in playing it ( and it's free. Personally id say it's worth playing) at least youtube a play through. But keep in mind that doesnt show you all the in game building of him. Theres several characters who talk about him.

ThatsInsane,fdp8r6w,t1_fdp5phw,1578622651.0,"Hits where? The vital areas yes. People have been shot in the head and still lived for a few minutes. There was a man in the 1800's who had a giant stake go through his skull, climbed down the mountain they were mining, make his way to town, though up  which cause brains to leak out his skull, and he lived another 20 or 30 years. Go read some accounts of battle. People loose arms and survive for a remarkable amount of time without medical attention. In martial arts (historically speaking not referring to kung-fu) they teach you to finish the opponent in battle. As in oh I stabbed his stomach that's fatal. They don't stop there. They follow up with an immediately fatal blow if possible. Just because they are dying doesnt mean they can't kill you. 

Also, as I stated. Edge alignment isnt easy. It's a sword not a club. A hit does not mean a cut if you dont know what you're doing. If the edge isnt aligned correctly, you'll just end up with a baby cut and a gnarly bruise. Theres a reason historically untrained soldiers were given spears, clubs, axes, or other such weapons over swords. Much less skill is required to be deadly (I specifically am saying deadly rather over efficient)"

However, swords are hard. Edge alignment isnt easy. And as I understand it, katana are harder to handle then swords due to the motion you're supposed to do during the swing. I'm not expert, you can do some youtubing on the matter to either verify me or disprove me, but I think you're supposed to pull the sword towards you as you slice so as to increase the ... cuttingness?
