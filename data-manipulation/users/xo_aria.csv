This has been me all week. Just my brain constantly shouting “kill yourself, cut yourself, you’re worthless”. Just know you aren’t alone and we can get through this"
bipolar,fdiw021,t1_fdivxgu,1578452296.0,"Thank you, I appreciate your advice. Let’s hope no rash occurs at all!"
bipolar,fdivp4u,t1_fdiv9pa,1578452097.0,"She is part of a reputable practice, but she is not a psychiatrist technically she is some sort of psychiatric nurse practitioner. She always seems to push newer medications that don’t have generics, so I was really happy she prescribed Lamictal since it’s what I read as being one of the most successful. If I get the rash at all, do I go straight to the ER or call her first?"
bipolar,fdiv2jx,t1_fdiufo1,1578451691.0,Yeah it definitely made me nervous that she didn’t tell me about the side effects. She just said “worst side effect is a rash” and left it at that.
