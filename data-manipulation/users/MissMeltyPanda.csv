BeAmazed,ffcl1sg,t1_ffcczvi,1579801724.0,Idk I feel like it's the dog owners fault not the dog's. While this dog was a mix of aggressive breeds. The owners should have understood that when raising it. It's just a manner of bad training and handling. No one should let a known aggressive/territorial breed of dog just walk the neighborhood. There are no bad dogs just bad dog owners. Sad part is that the dog was just a puppy when it was put down too.

This is strange advice, but try applying for citizenship to another country. Maybe one you have heritage from. I happen to have Finnish heritage, and got a citizenship there.

He has a good life where he can fly around in a safe environment. He gets lots of good food. He has deep connections with me and a couple other people. Parrots are more than just being able to fly outside where they are susceptible to predators. They're very intelligent animals who play, love, investigate, discover, and terrorize. You would know that if you spent any time with parrots."

He has tons of fresh fruits and veggies that I give him that he chooses to eat. He has the ability to fly wherever he wants in his house. He gets to make all the decisions he wants in a safe space. Parrots who get lost outside where I live die. Honestly if that is your question then you also have to analyze the boundaries that humans put on each other and how that affects our autonomy.

vegan,fdrkqxj,t1_fdqt65z,1578685855.0,At the cal-academy of sciences they dont have a single vegan option in their cafe. Then you go to the rainforest exhibit and it says to lower your meat consumption for the environment. The problem is a lot of these places dont practice what they preach.
diet,fdokz6p,t3_embbll,1578607253.0,"I am vegan and eat a whole plant based diet. It works really well for me. I think as long as you get all of your nutrients in the form of whole foods you're doing good.  

There is a lot of evidence that a plant based diet can reverse most chronic diseases, that's why I am a strong believer in it. My dad recently had a heart attack, and he ate a carnivore diet before it was cool. I deeply worry about people on the carnivore diet. Read the harvard article below if you want to know why. I'm no expert but I try to listen to true science.  

As much as I want everyone to go vegan for the environment, the animals, and their health. It is not the only diet that works. Whole foods mostly plants is the way to go. Deeply recommend reading How Not to Diet by Dr. Michael Gregor.
