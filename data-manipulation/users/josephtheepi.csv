AskReddit,ffggub9,t3_etcyd6,1579905926.0,"There was a comedian, I forget who. He did a bit about the voice in the back of many men’s minds whenever they consider saying/doing/buying anything that doesn’t conform to traditionally masculine stereotypes: “F@G!” His point was that toxic masculinity was so bad that if a man so much as considered buying a tropical cocktail, for example, that he’d hear that voice and feel judged, stigmatized.

So yeah, if we could do away stereotypes that certain behaviors aren’t manly, that’d be a start."
