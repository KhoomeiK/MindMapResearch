GenderCritical,fdjkvl8,t3_elfg5y,1578475687.0,"That's because everyone's been told that it's racist to say someone tried to rape them, if the people are ""foreigners.""

The UK is toast. Then again they've allowed this to happen to their own society, all in the name of ""tolerance.""

The Light has become corrupt. And now the Darkness swallows it."
offmychest,fdjkok5,t3_elpssc,1578475407.0,"Not one at all.

That's completely normal at 19 actually.

It feels ""wrong"" because it's not someone in your age bracket, and likely you've subconciously been conditioned (or conditioned yourself) to think it's normal only to like those women.

A physically matured older woman like that has a different lure. A confidence too. Experience gives them a lot of edges.

It's actually no different than a young girl looking at an older man.

Don't feel like you have to approach her or get involved. Just talk to her, enjoy her company and appreciate her.

And don't feel ashamed of what you like. Unless you're an older man or woman who is into children.

But that's a conversation for another day."
offmychest,fdjkgmf,t3_elkpl0,1578475085.0,"Yes. Because now you have the opportunity to build something new in a clean space, with nothing holding you back.

Or you can feel it's not worth it. And go down that path. But I wouldn't recommend it. It involves a lot of tequila, misery, and sometimes ends in early death.

As long as you live, you can build more. Once you die, well. 

Let's just not go there."
offmychest,fdjkc9a,t3_elo3ar,1578474909.0,"I mean. You're not wrong. He's damned hot, and I'm a hetero man. Geralt has a glorious butt among other assets of that physique. And a fun personality to boot. ""I uhh claim the law of surprise!"" ""My love, are you pregnant?"" ""Fuck.""

Best scene ever."
offmychest,fdjjy8x,t3_elpcs0,1578474346.0,"That is a good thing that you feel that way, about the more you know, the less you understand.

Because it means you realize how little you truly know about the world, and therefore that there is always more to learn.

This is a good thing!

The reason you feel as you do about free college though and world peace, is because those things aren't a real, obtainable goal.

Human nature and free will make those things impossible. It's better to realize that earlier in life than later. Nothing in life is free. Nothing in life is peaceful.

And it's never going to change, unless you take away everyone's free will or force them all to take in the same ideals. And even then infighting will still occur.

Keep your chin up, work for your goals, learn to manage your resources and set aside resources to advance yourself. That's just how life works.

As for world peace, forget it. Civilization is merely a veneer to cover the rending and tearing of claw and fang in life. It's simply a structure, and outside that structure that same chaos rages on, unhidden.

Welcome to being human. And welcome to the real world. Learning to adapt to the chaos and uncertainty in life is a required life skill. It is why our species wasn't wiped out the day it came into being (be it via Creation OR Evolution).

This is how the Earth has been since the dawn of time, even before mankind. This is nature and reality's true face.

The only one who can build a life of prosperity for you, is you. Your own two hands.

The pipe dream our generation was sold has come to a waking of reality instead.  The utopian ideal we were sold was a lie. Our activist professors lied. Our ""free stuff"" politicians lied. Our ""tolerant and diverse society"" lied. Because they instead became the very thing they hate, only with different colors to hate and different ideas to hate.

Our light, once meant to guide others to a better world, was false. A twisted mockery of the true thing. And because of it, the true darkness grew quietly, and tired of its' prison, tired of the abuse at the hands of the false light, finally broke free and took over our society.

And now we wake up to ruins of reality. A reality we neglected because we were too busy believing an idealistic, bright eyed lie.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Only by accepting the truth of reality can the proper light be restored, and the genuine darkness banished.

The only question is. Now that we are out of our dream... can we adapt, and make it happen?"
offmychest,fdjjg80,t3_eljpa4,1578473643.0,"Good on ya. Whatever you do, never forget. Each paycheck, set something aside. That is. Pay yourself first!

Life is so busy paying everyone else, all the bills, we forget to pay ourselves.

Have this money be something you set aside to a goal that will help you progress, earn more. Either investing, buy a business, or for higher education/trade school!

Sounds like you're doing great though. Keep it up!

If you get the chance, check out the book ""Richest Man in Babylon"" (I think it's called). That book has the best lessons about money management. Once you master your money, the rest is easier."
offmychest,fdjizcs,t1_fdipknn,1578473000.0,"It's one thing to bring up your significant other, as they are a person. But straights don't walk around going ""I'm straight and proud."" unless it's because we're tired of hearing the ""gay and proud."" We don't mind people having something that's a part of them, and expecting to be accepted the same as others, but at the same time having it directly flung in our face gets kind of old. There's letting something be a part of you, and then there's letting it take you over.

It's like that annoying character in a game that goes ""I'm a mage!"" every two seconds. Yes. You throw fire. We get it. You're a mage.

Or that poorly written erotica that just keeps mashing in whatever kink and mentioning it in every paragraph instead of just telling the story.

Like all things, it's presentation.

Versus say, being a real life Mary Sue. (And while yes, rejection sucks, don't try to force people to accept you either. Just smile and let them have their own space. You're more likely to be someone to respect then, in their eyes, instead of a nuisance).

Because that's what constantly throwing a single personality aspect in someone's face is.

A nuisance. It screams ""look at me!"" instead of simply existing. Except the ""look at me"" is being shoved in their face. That only breeds annoyance and resentment."
offmychest,fdjhyes,t3_ekpn2j,1578471627.0,"You know, as someone who has felt erratic, neurotic, lonely, and anxious as I try to feel connected to others, I appreciate this post. Thank you for putting it up here. I came across it completely by accident while searching for negative things in Google... and just stumbled across this. And you know what? You made me feel better... calmer...

Thank you for this. And it was enough to make me finally actually create a reddit account. All just to say thank you to you."
