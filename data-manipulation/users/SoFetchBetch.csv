Edit:

It’s not MY fetish. It’s a fetishization of the female form and some women are into it too. I myself am a woman who is not into it. But I find all corners of the strange internet interesting. Don’t shoot the messenger!"

I’m in my late 20’s and my (ex) friend who is in her late 30’s told me I should start getting Botox now because she started getting it when she was my age.

She doesn’t look young for her age. The opposite in fact. All the smoking and drinking can’t help with that... 

I think I’m gonna just follow my instincts and continue taking care of my skin and body through diet, exercise, and highly attentive skincare routines.

I have smile lines but you know what? I’m glad that the fine lines on my face show a life of laughter and joy, despite all the difficulties this life has thrown at me. I’m proud of it."

I looked around online and couldn’t find it :("
AnimalsBeingBros,ffc1l7l,t1_ffbznvi,1579789224.0,It’s so dumb too because horse tastes just like beef. Most people would never be able to tell a difference. And shipping that meat overseas is such a huge waste of energy and carbon emissions. They should just sell it to Ikea for their meatballs. And I say this as a Swede living in America.
unpopularopinion,ffc0ifo,t3_cy40x8,1579788402.0,"I don’t think you understand the extent to which race and institutionalized racism (as well as plain old regular racism) is still a problem in the United States. People are dying over this every single day. People are suffering and losing their family members over senseless hatred.

Nazi’s and white supremacists are considered dangerous and enemies of the general public because they want harm to befall those of a different skin color. It’s pretty cut and dry. People who identify as neo-nazi or white supremacist will tell you plainly that they wish ill on those who aren’t like themselves.

Also with how much you defend Nazi’s it’s pretty sus tbh..."

Not saying it’s an excuse, just that it’s not an action of malicious intent.

We need better laws and regulations on companies so that the products we have access to are more ethical."

interestingasfuck,ff6644s,t1_ff601vr,1579620040.0,"Actually, bats are number one on that list because the incidence of homosexual activities in many species of bats is the highest among all animals, even higher than humans. 

Then bonobos: Studies suggest 75 percent of bonobo sex is nonreproductive and that nearly all bonobos are bisexual.

Then the Bottlenose dolphin, which are probably known as the most hypersexual creatures among all animals. They’re not only attracted to other dolphins but other sea creatures like sea turtles and even humans. Male dolphin calves often form temporary sexual partnerships, which scientists believe help to establish lifelong bonds. Such sexual behavior has been documented only relatively recently. It’s been said, nearly, if not all adult male dolphins are bisexual. The gay activities of these mammals include oral sex during which time one dolphin stimulates the other with its snout.

Then giraffes. Homosexual activity among giraffes is, in many cases, much more common than heterosexual activity. A male will neck with another before mounting him, this affectionate play can last longer than one hour.

Then black swans. Almost a quarter of black swan families are parented by homosexual couples. This accounts up to 20% of male pairings annually. Male couples sometimes mate with a female just to have a baby. Once she lays the egg, they chase her away, hatch the egg, and raise a family on their own. Other times, male couples drive away heterosexual couples from their nests and adopt their egg.

Then the Japanese macaque. Same-sex relations are frequent among this species. Females will form consortships characterized by affectionate social and sexual activities. In some troops up to one quarter of the females form such bonds, which vary in duration from a few days to a few weeks. Often, strong and lasting friendships result from such pairings. Males also have same-sex relations, typically with multiple partners of the same age.

In American Bison, courtship, mounting, and full anal penetration between bulls has been noted to occur. It’s more common for homosexual mounting than heterosexual mounting, up to 55%. The main cause for male pairings is because most females only mate with the males once a year; this leads to males engaging in same sex activities several times a day.

Then the walrus. Until male walruses reach sexual maturity at age four, they are most likely exclusively involved in same sex relationships. Adult male walruses are bisexual, mating with females during breeding season and copulating with other males the rest of the year.

Then the Mallard duck. Mallards have rates of male-male sexual activity that are unusually high for birds, in some cases, as high as 19% of all pairs in a population.

King penguin. Research shows around a fifth of all king penguin couples kept in captivity are gay.

Then Guianan-C o c k-of-the-Rocks. 40% of males engage in some form of homosexuality sexual activity.


Then Western Gulls. Studies have shown that 10 to 15 percent of female western gulls in some populations in the wild exhibit homosexual behavior.


Dragonfly: Male homosexuality has been inferred in several species of dragonflies.

Next the Uganda Cobb. The males are 100% straight but around 10% of the females are homosexual. The female kobs perform oral sex on each other and even stroke each other's vulvas with their forelegs, a couple of times an hour during mating season.


Grey Whales: In slip-and-slide orgies, groups of male grey whales, one of the oldest species of mammals, roll in the ocean rubbing their bellies against each other so that their genitals are touching.

Those are the top 15 most homosexual animals. Thanks for subscribing to big gay facts."

onejoke,ff33ldn,t1_fdjwhte,1579532803.0,"Even some lgbt folks think this way. Look at Blair White. As a cis presenting but non-binary identifying person she made me feel really invalidated and even more afraid to come out, seek lgbt spaces, and contribute to the community. I always feel like I’m not “gay enough” because I’m pansexual and non-binary but I look cis on a work day. I realize that my experiences are different but they’re still valid."
