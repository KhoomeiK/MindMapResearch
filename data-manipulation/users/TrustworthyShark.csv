gamedev,ff8qjmm,t1_ff8lnwt,1579691919.0,"I guess the difference is that most other businesses require a lot of up-front investment. It's easier to have more and more money and time drain into an indie game venture, not giving up because of the gambler's fallacy. 

Most non-tech businesses you'd start, everyone expects you to have some form of business plan as well, while indie devs making a GDD or other planning seems to be the exception rather than the norm."

gamedev,ff5jkdm,t1_ff5hrel,1579595893.0,"This is pretty much the advice I give everyone with that question. 

Don't make a game engine if you want to make a game. Make a game engine to learn more about game engines, then do a couple of game jams with it, but use an off-the-shelf engine for serious projects. 

I once wrote an interpreter and compiler for a custom programming language. Do I use my shitty language for anything? Hell no! Did I learn a lot about how all the systems work and do I now understand what's going on behind vague syntax errors? Totally. A learning experience like that is definitely worth it (+it looks good on your GitHub profile when looking for a job)."
gamedev,ff5jcfd,t1_ff5isuk,1579595582.0,"Because game engines take a lot of time to design and make. It will take a fraction of that time to learn enough of an existing engine to be productive. 

The only case where this may not be true is if you're making a super simple 2D game where you can get away with a framework, but even then it's hard to argue against the rapid prototyping capabilities you gain from an engine like Unity or Godot."
