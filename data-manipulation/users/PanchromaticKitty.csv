bipolar,fexq0ym,t1_fexcfdg,1579434632.0,The semicolon represents a moment where the author could have ended the sentence but chose not to. This is an analogy to suicide and a subtle way to remember that you don't have to end your life yet.
bipolar,fexn11e,t1_fev56he,1579433501.0,Thank you so much I will definitely try that!

Quaternions shouldn't be manipulated any other way if you don't know the mathematics behind, this just allows you to rotate one axis without touching the others :) 
Euler angles are the ones we use daily so it is easier to manipulate"
Unity3D,fdib8q0,t1_fdib437,1578439085.0,Great! There is localRotation in transform.

public static Player instance;

Once you've done that you can access your player's public function from any script by calling

Player.instance.MyFunction(bla, bla, bla) ;

Another way is to get the player from the projectile if it contains the player that launched it

Hope this helps!
