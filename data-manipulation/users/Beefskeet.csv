The 15,000 I save by choosing a usalabs rotovap over a buchi or Pope (more like 50k there) is enough to pay someone to regrind and still have 14,500 leftover.  Usalabs is the best chinese glass I've found with good support, but their joints rarely hold deep vacuum without grinding. Most people return a part or two from turnkey kits before it quits sucking in atmosphere. IMO 500 bucks is better than a month wait and the question of if it will even work. 

As for the pumps, I have tried more than 5 vendors and see similar results. Better off buying used and rebuilding myself, it saves a few thousand bucks for an hour of work to make a usey more functional than brand mew. There are no american manufacturers, just resellers.

CANNABISfuturus,fezwrc5,t1_feys324,1579462670.0,"Generally you get degraded effects, like using marinol to replace cbd. Marinol imitates CBD isolate, the least effective (if at all effective) form of the substance. So you're better off just eating a raw plant for that 20% content because of the additive affects of the whole plant spectrum. 

Some chemicals can be isomerize from cannabis derived products as well. Terpenes, cannabinoids are pretty easy to convert into other like substances but have a huge potential for byproducts. Converting CBD to THC is cheap but acidifies the product and creates stuff like formaldehyde and heavy terpinoids.

You could hang it sideways for vertical strips and a $5 warranty. But if you can get a 1kw ballast and hood with a metal halide you'll be able to put that between a few stacks and theyll all grow well. 50 bucks or so on craigslist with a larger utility spending. Also a 650w LED grow light for 300 is cheaper to run 6 months than a halide.

That's killer that you're having good luck with the taste and reusing the runoff. If you wanted to try something new, mykos and azos are pretty cheap and should self multiply in the right conditions. I personally use more fungus than nutrient, since my tomatoes can grow on 0.5 nitrogen sub with a regular dosage of humic and probiotic tea (home made from manure). The result is more efficient feeding in low availability environments, which makes a nice habitat for both root and fungus. 

I cant control my phos or pot because my birds like to sleep on the warm soil. But that's just how you know its alive, it steams in winter after a feed. The tea is made in hydro tubs and generally is the main difference between a 3 lb hemp plant and a 10 lb hemp plant. Not the feed so much. This summer I'd mail you a few tomatoes to try out. Mine stack so much pollen they turn your hands shiny gold leaf color when you pick. The taste speaks for itself. Also on a dry farm they rest on the dry mulch (silica and limestone sand in my case) without going bad which is nice. The warmth helps them mature evenly.

Birds and tomatoes dont mix though. I have to keep them out of the greens and fruit. Birds and tall crops kill it."

I've had to kill a few skunks and rattlesnakes though. Door chimes work very well to scare nocturnal predators away. And motion sensor Halloween decorations like the spooky skeleton dancing. Redneck security. Synthetic cat piss is barely a repellent. Electric wire works well too. I'm big on protecting my birds.

I got about 500 downvotes for my post of afroduck (poofy head, guess he has a racist name), so I no longer post to reddit. This winter the quail I ran in my greenhouse to eat cover crop are going to be with my hemp full time, I saw incredible results. They eat earwigs and pill bugs which are 80% of my pests. Also mow down vetch which grows wild here.

What do you normally feed them? They get a cover crop of beans/sunflower and a compost pile full of veggies until the hemp is tall enough for them to take shelter under the canopy at my place. Once they get under the hemp in about may, they stay there and dont get fed to encourage foraging. There is plenty of food there for them. They keep the pests and weeds down. My last spray of neem was in 2017 thanks to this."
Futurology,fe6hl3f,t1_fe6bhjh,1578891133.0,"Like I said, normal farming has space between plants. If you farm a canopy it does not. I'll look to see if any studies agree, but I grow 15 foot plants in the field. How vertical can that go? I get greens underneath them. The total harvest is pretty amazing. With quail for my enployees.

Edit: I stand corrected. If you're vertical garden is more than maybe 60 feet tall you run an advantage. But for actual farms outside of the city it doesn't make sense. My plants are already 12 feet tall come harvest. When you need to switch to a cash crop on a vertical garden, good luck. The hemp revolution going on in america right now is displacing a ton of food.

Before this I just did hens, quail can pick aphids off my plants and roam the canopy without damage. 

My opinion on chickens is go with vetch or beans and then they can eat their bedding. Only a small area makes feet of growth every week. 

If you cant eat gluten then you cant eat proto rye though. It will change the face of agriculture yields but not your diet.

I did the cricket cabbage and red light setup for a while for an ex who had a tegu. It's fun for sure. I think the birds are more suited to eating stuff like beans and sunflowers. Too many pests make them gamey for hens and ducks. But sunflowers are pretty."

For now biological processes like hummingbirds and bees will be the best pollinators for us. Maybe one day that will be the job of machines. It's a little reassuring and bleak at the same time. High powered fans are good pollinators. Loads of waste heat from a city. The way I see it we are still missing a piece of the sustainable puzzle which is methanotrophs to eat the byproducts of even renewable farms. But a hydroponic solution is the most suited to farm those bacteria. Even then methane and water dont mix so they need to live in the air vents in some filter.

It's not like supermarket food is raised in natural soil most of the time. Who am I kidding, this skyscraper food wont be very subpar from what is already picked early and treated with chemical castrators to stop ripening. Ethylene glycol makes crops go round.

I'm snooty about grow practices on ag land, but in the city there are so many pollutants this is the only reasonable way. Nobody wants to eat out of that ground. In the past in san fran my best friend has partaken in a above concrete gardening program where they grow over tarps. The side of a building would have been easy for them to figure.

Futurology,fe5x57w,t1_fe5wca3,1578876918.0,"Yes true however I'm saying that vertical doesnt help space requirements unless your crop isnt full sun, and even still you can tier your canopy to allow low light greens between rows. Most regular farms leave 50% of the field open for tractors, or they're growing wheat/corn. 

Acre for acre, vertical gardens do not produce more if you're on flat land. You either harness the full canopy allotted or you dont. If sun hits the ground and plants are still growing there, you didnt get full yield from a vertical garden. Most that I have seen cast shadow on their own plants or require artificial lighting, or a greenhouse to disperse light. There goes 20% of your UV and a huge amount of space. They work well if you need to fill a greenhouse though to make it produce.

There can be places they work well like mt side and northern region where the sun is low. But not like the bread basket plains. But your yield per plant will be much lower without the microbes associated with the ground. Considering only 8% or so are identified they cannot be supplemented. I'm talking night and day yield difference. Sure you get more plants. We refer to those veggies as heavy in ""water weight"" when grown in hydro or potting soil because they are also less tasteful and nutritious."
Futurology,fe5ws4z,t1_fe5nfc3,1578876685.0,"Cereal crops are turning perennial these days which is going to cause another small food revolution. Once proto rye competes with wheat (and has a harvest every 2 months with no planting schedule year to year) we will need much less space for cereal crops and little tractor work. 

My farm raises poultry from pests instead of spraying. So the crops sustain a few hundred quail per acre which produce eggs and meat with no grain to feed, just a crop patch and the bugs. 

I wish I could get into aquaponics stuff because I really enjoyed farming my refugeum bacteria to feed the biome in my old tank. Ducks make quick work of a clean body of water though, I let them take care of the magic plant tea. 

Wish I could start more renewable farms but the reason why we cannot compete is that growing food doesnt make money. All the decent farmers I know are subsidized to fill food pantries. They make 20k a year to feed thousands for free.

I have finished products but only cash crops really help my bottom line. So most of this waste goes into compost and the food is ultimately sold as potting soil."
Futurology,fe5u70s,t1_fe4dij6,1578875033.0,"Personally of the belief that there are super sustainable ways to farm. Hydro is not one of them, however hugelmounds are a great way to turn this waste into trapped nutrients instead of methane. Hugelmounds also cause water consumption to plummet, in most cases you do not require water for the entire year if maintained proper with plant debris and tilling. Rain from November to february is enough to pull a crop in september.

There are probably 20 iterations of dry farm which are wholly self contained in that omniverous predators, pests, and plant yield higher calories in harvest than the previous season with no external fertilizer.

The visible result is a piling of the organic layer, topsoil raises up by the inch and your entire acreage gains literal tones of mass in nutrient and live culture.

Also f**k vertical gardening. Tiered canopy is the most efficient way. If you have no sun hitting the ground, you are farming your energy source as efficiently as possible already. You dont do vertical solar panels, trapping calories is the main focus. I can guarantee better gains from an unirrigated field than from the same space of vertical garden or hydro (if lighting was the same)"

The registration fee I got back by business car insurance rates alone, saves me 300 yearly. Plus it allows me to stock shelves instead if selling it bulk to a company to do the same. 5x profit.

You could do the same if you liked ducks, sell some eggs and write off the feed. Now I can write off the tools I used to buy with my savings."

This was originally given to help her eat while sick, and it happened to make her arthritis and shakiness go away too.
