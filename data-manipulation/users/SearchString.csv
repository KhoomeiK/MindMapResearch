It was various shades of purple, absolutely gorgeous, and only $30. I didn't get it because I was recently divorced and was uncertain about the future. I so wish I'd gotten it. Haven't found anything remotely like it :(."

selfimprovement,ff3bxvc,t3_erfaax,1579538142.0,"I remember reading a few years ago that psychologists considered adding spoiling your child as a form of child abuse. There was a lot of backlash and they dropped it, but I could see why they considered it. Giving a child everything doesn't give them the opportunity to develop self sufficiency. You can't change their behavior, but you can work on changing yours. I have two suggestions you may find useful: 1. Gratitude meditation (and meditation in general). You already have self awareness. Develop your capacity to turn that self awareness into change. 2. Volunteer to help others. It will likely help you to develop more appreciation for what you have, but it will also help you shift your focus outside of yourself and help you build confidence and capacity to use your privilege for good. Good luck! The first steps for change is recognizing the need to change and wanting it! Now you're ready for the next steps :). Don't expect to change all at once and be kind to yourself when you have bad days. It's a process and can take some time."

selfimprovement,fdfz2f8,t3_el5wli,1578374296.0,"I did this, but it wasn't easy. Figure out how much you eat on average and then cut back by a percentage each week until you get to the level you want. First thing I did was no sugary drinks. Water or plain tea. That eliminates a lot of sugar and sugary drinks aren't as good to me as desserts. Now I only have the occasional sweet treat and don't crave it much. Wasn't easy at all though!!!"
Meditation,fdfxhxj,t3_el667l,1578372929.0,I think that's just a part of being a social animal. I feel the most alone when I am with someone and that person is not a good fit. Be patient and someone will come along. In the meantime enjoy your alone time and the pleasantness of not being in an unhappy relationship. Maybe think about volunteering at an animal shelter. The company of animals is so peaceful :).

changemyview,fcvdnak,t1_fcvcvm6,1577999909.0,"Yes, it is irrational :). Human brains are wired for fairness, not rationality. Sweden has an organized system of public health care and a smaller population. They are likely able to get a much higher compliance rate than the US for treatment. Which again will feed fears (what if they miss a dose). Sweden also has a different culture. I don't know what would change people's minds about pedophiles. Mandatory physical castration of convicted pedophiles doesn't alleviate fears of those who go undetected. And there's also the worry of permanently mutilating an innocent man. And what do we do with female pedophiles? It's a complex problem."
povertyfinance,fcvcwpm,t3_ej4bjj,1577999466.0,"If you have a dental school in your area you can apply for services. If they are able to match you with a student, you can get a pretty significant discount. Also if you have a public health clinic, check if they have dental options."
changemyview,fcvck4m,t1_fcv9qlo,1577999255.0,"Research has found it's more complicated than just reducing testosterone. The testes are not the only source of testosterone. Reduces recidivism, but doesn't eliminate. This contributes to the public fear of pedophiles. Your argument is about public perception. The psychology behind what people believe is very complex."

changemyview,fcv4nk7,t1_fcv2e7c,1577994564.0,That doesn't actually work (there's research on chemical castration). I get the impression you're not actually interested in others' perspectives or having your view changed. Peace and Happy New Year.
changemyview,fcux854,t1_fcuwmvw,1577990348.0,"Abusive parents, murders, and robbers can be rehabilitated. Pedophiles can't. By the way, I'd rat have everything be stolen than be raped. For most women, sexual assault is the worst thing that can happen. Some men, too."
ZeroWaste,fcuvxqw,t1_fcuqv2g,1577989632.0,I like the insulation idea. I've been thinking about making some outdoor shelters for opossums and feral cats. Seems like these could be used in between two plastic containers for insulation.

changemyview,fcuvgg3,t3_ej194u,1577989363.0,"Not only do pedophiles prey on our most precious people (children represent the future of a culture and will be the caretakers of the adult when they grow up), but pedophiles are difficult to identify and nearly impossible to rehabilitate. Most crimes are committed by young males from impoverished circumstances. Change their circumstances, you might be able to change them and they are likely to change anyway as they get older. Sexual preference stays stable throughout life so someone who is a pedophile has that potential all their life no matter what society does. They are reviled in proportion to their threat. That is, their victims are highly valued and they are a danger throughout their lives no matter what society does."

selfimprovement,fcqswp7,t3_eij8b9,1577891708.0,Remind yourself each time it happens not to take it personally. These reactions are about them and their inner demons. Don't take their baggage on yourself. You might check out forgiveness meditation. I think that can be really helpful. Forgiving them for their behavior and also forgiving yourself for letting it get to you might help you let it go.

personalfinance,fckgp90,t1_fckg2uk,1577724935.0,"Late payments can definitely affect your credit score, especially more than one. If you don't already, try a reputable free budgeting app like Mint or Personal Capital to track your expenses but also they will send you offers that apply to your situation. They might suggest something useful."
Teachers,fckgah4,t3_ehnrv3,1577724673.0,Plenty of private schools. You might also look at military schools and foreign teaching as behavior is less of an issue there as well. Once you're sure where you want to teach (and what you want to teach) talk to the principals and teachers about the best educational path to get there.
Stoicism,fckfqtj,t3_ehnsvf,1577724325.0,"We let go of the past by forgiving, not only others but ourselves. Do better going forward. There is no way 'to make up' for past wrongs. There is only doing better now."
personalfinance,fckf8d1,t1_fckeuj9,1577723999.0,"Sorry, I misread that. No, don't withdraw from your IRA. Try to see if you can get a card with temporary 0% interest on transfer balances. The interest payments are going to make it hard to pay down the balance and get ahead. Especially if your rent is going up. What about getting a roommate to help split costs?"
personalfinance,fckeg6y,t3_ehnzht,1577723498.0,"Don't have much advice for many of these but I can help with two things:

1. Eating out is so much more expensive than cooking at home. Since you travel a lot, you'll need to plan meals to avoid wasting perishable foods. Look for recipes that don't need a lot of perishables and shop for only what you need for a short period. Websites like Budget Bytes will be helpful. 

2. You mentioned you have savings. Use it to pay off your credit card debt. It's unlikely you're getting enough interest on your savings to make up for the high interest on the credit cards. Pay them off so you can start building savings again. 

A second source of income like Uber or Lyft may help in the short term, but your time may be better used focusing on building your business or developing new marketable skills.

Hope any of this is helpful for you!"
declutter,fckavw8,t3_ehnlj0,1577721156.0,"Don't be too hard on yourself. Messiness is not a mark of childhood and being an adult does not require you keep everything perfectly clean.

TwoXChromosomes,fcjca9y,t3_ehha8g,1577682811.0,There are comfortable sports bras and the like that should be sufficient even when dressing 'professional.' I'm about a D and can't wear things with wires or certain elastic (skin problems) so I wear a variety of comfortable sports bras made with soft materials and I've never had anyone mention I was inappropriate. Research some of the more comfortable options and see if you can come up with a compromise?

Which is likely to give me the largest number of opportunities to grow. For example, choosing to stay in a current job or take a different one I look at which one will give me more opportunities to learn new things and meet new people. I don't know what will make me happiest or how to measure that so I look at what's important to me that I can measure. :)"
TwoXChromosomes,fc9955m,t1_fc98kbi,1577549025.0,"Hopefully her grandparents and uncle can get her (and support her) going to therapy. She's not likely to get much out of it if she's not comfortable so if people are acting like it's a huge burden taking her, that won't be helpful. Maybe something like martial arts or tai chi or yoga that can help her develop some mental discipline and calmness? Just throwing out ideas. Really she needs some people who support and accept her with all her flaws and help her figure out what's going on in her brain."
aww,fc971iv,t1_fc95tt0,1577548053.0,"All dogs have two glands inside their anus. They are little pockets of skin that fill with a strong smelling fluid. When they poop, the pressure usually empties the fluid in their glands. For wild animals, this helps mark their territory. In little dogs, sometimes their poop doesn't empty the glands and the fluid stays their and can get infected. This can happen in big dogs too, but is more common in little dogs. One of my little dog doesn't have a problem as long as I feed him dry food. The other had a problem with the gland opening being turned in so I had to drain them. It's a little gross, but I got used to it and she was very patient. Hope this helps!"
TwoXChromosomes,fc96bqm,t3_egs017,1577547726.0,"Thank you for caring. I agree that someone who lies about something like that must be in emotional/mental distress. Or has some serious mental problems that need addressing. Are there options for therapy for her? Professional help would be best. If not, maybe something like the Big Sister's organization? Is there something she likes and is good at that she can get involved with to help get some validation and positive attention she isn't getting from her family?"

Buddhism,fc94dt1,t1_fc92rft,1577546846.0,Maybe it's letting go of the attachment to the outcome that will be of help. List the pros and cons of moving and try to make the decision without emotions. And then commit to your choice. You don't know that your life would have been like without your ex having been in it so try to let that go. I found peace when I finally let go of the pain caused by my 'bad' decisions. I no longer look at them as 'bad'. Just decisions I made that took me on a path that led to experiences. It's all the judgement that causes more pain about things that are over or haven't happened yet. I hope this helps.
aww,fc93c1o,t3_egri3h,1577546353.0,"If he scoots his tush on the floor he needs to have his glands drained. Small dogs are prone to this. Groomer or vet can do. I asked the vet to show me and now I can do it since one of mine needed it about once a week. Keep an eye on his teeth. Small dogs live longer and tend not to chew as much so they can get dental issues. He's beautiful! I was always a big dog person until I rescued small dogs. It's so convenient to be able to pick them up, lol :D."
Buddhism,fc91tb3,t3_egrli5,1577545659.0,"I struggle with this as well. The most helpful advice I've gotten about decision making doesn't necessarily relate to Buddhism (but it doesn't not relate either). A friend once pointed out that there is no way to know if a decision was right or wrong. You will never live the decisions you didn't make to see how things would have turned out. So, make your decision with the knowledge you have and commit to whatever life lessons it brings you. Be at peace."
