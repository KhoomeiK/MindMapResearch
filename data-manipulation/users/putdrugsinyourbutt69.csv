I'm sure it's taken down now but at the time it didnt even cross our minds this was illegal

and maybe she didnt post it for attention  but she was in no way ashamed of it and her overall attitude led me to  believe it was a case of doing something to be rebellious and ""cool"" without thinking of the consequences"
