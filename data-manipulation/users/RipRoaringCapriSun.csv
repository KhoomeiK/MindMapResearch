investing,ffimtxl,t1_ffihhe2,1579977655.0,"I would also like to follow this up with a little calculation following a few assumptions for investing in CRE (because I think math is fun).   

Let's assume you've just bought a property with $1,000,000, at 30% down. So your property is worth about 3.3 million dollars, and you have a 2.3 million dollar loan that has a 4% interest rate.   

You get a pretty crappy return at 6%, but hey, you chose a lower return because the local area was looking to grow quite a bit. And you have an interest only loan where you just make the base payments.  

You pay about 1% of the property value every year in taxes, and another percent for property repairs. You also pay a management company 10% of your revenue to handle the day to day stuff.   

6% return is $198,000, minus 2% of the property value from taxes and repairs becomes $132,000. Minus 10% of your revenue becomes $112,200, and minus 4% of the loan equals $19,800. Take off a 15% tax on income and you'll end up with about $16,000 (rounding down because I like simple numbers).  

$16,000 from $1,000,000 is a 1.6% return. Which is a really shitty return for the risk you've taken. But here is the thing, you took a 6% return because you thought the property would appreciate nicely, and it does fine for itself. 5% annually (national U.S. average over the last few decades I believe), and because your return is fixed at 6% of your property value, that does better as well.   

Now, I won't go into the exact calculations because the Reddit platform isn't super supportive of math notation. But suffice it to say, that because your loan stays at 2.3 million dollars, and your income plus other costs are fixed to the value of the property, the growth is quite nice.  When you add every year of profit together for the next 20 years, subtract the full loan payment, and add the value of the property over 20 years, you walk away with 8.2 million dollars (according to my calculations, feel free to check me, if you have high enough math skills it shouldn't be hard to reconstruct my equation).   

That's annualized at an 11% return, which is certainly nothing to sniff at. Better yet, that is without investing any of the money you made from your income. If you just then throw your money in the S&P500 for a 10% return before inflation, then you will have 13.5 million dollars, and annualized return of almost 13.8%, which is a return I would be very comfortable having.  

Now as always, real estate investing involves a solid bit of risk. This isn't a guaranteed return and it certainly isn't the way that everyone should go. It is just a calculation to show that real estate is not automatically worse than other forms of investing. If you were to get really good at real estate, and got a return higher than the lowly 6% (CRE gets 6%-12% so you could definitely do better), as well as chose excellent locations that did better than the national average, and invested your income into more real estate, your returns would be astronomical."
investing,ffihhe2,t3_etrhh6,1579973984.0,"Commercial real estate, or CRE has a lot of advantages that most investing types don't have.   Advantages that, when fully taken advantage of, can make CRE better than most standard types of investing.  

1. Positive cash flow is way better for CRE than stocks or bonds. Dividends from stocks could get you about 2%, bonds could get you about 4% and you could go higher if you don't mind the riskier companies. But well managed CRE can bring you in 6%-8% conservatively and higher returns are not at all uncommon.   

2. 1031 exchanges on investment property sales allow you to deffer capital gains taxes for decades. If you want to get out of one stock and into another, without some kind of tax shelter like an IRA you'll have to pay just for switching.   

3. Depreciation on real estate is great for reducing your income tax burden.   

4. Leverage can very noticably increase your cash-on-cash return. Real estate loans are usually significantly better than most other types of loans. They have smaller interest rates, longer time horizons, etc.  

5. The real estate market is much less efficient than the stock market. If you want to buy a stock, you can't just go and bargain it down with the seller until you're happy (not until you get into very, very large transactions). In the real estate market, the property is valued at whatever you and the seller/buyer agree on. That means that due diligence and experience can increase your returns drastically, and you don't have to compete with a multi billion dollar investment firm if you don't want to.   

6. You have far more say over your investment. If you owned Boeing stock, would you have liked to know what was happening with the 737 MAX so you could exit, or even have the power to seriously influence the decision making process which led to those mistakes? In real estate you can, and many times the improvements don't require a genius. Simple concepts like changing management for poorly managed properties, or getting rid of poor tenants in favour of better ones later on can seriously improve your investment.  

7. If you want to retire without having to concern yourself with how many years of retirement you'll have, then you want CRE. If you buy into the S&P500 all your life, and then retire, you'll probably have to sell stock slowly to maintain your lifestyle, as you sell stock, your returns will be smaller every year, and if you retire too early or live longer than expected you are screwed. In CRE you just need to build an income that will sustain your lifestyle (which is far more attainable with the high cash flows available). Unlike bonds which give you a fixed return every year that is subject to inflation, your CRE income will be a percentage of the property value, and as your property keeps up with inflation so does your income.   

Now at the end of all this, you're probably thinking, ""sure, but in order to take advantage of all this you'll need a great deal of experience, and most of these high power earners don't have that."" And sure, you are absolutely right, but I'm not saying that CRE is a good investment for everyone, I am just explaining why it can still be very desirable to own real estate over other investment types."

Showerthoughts,ff76azw,t1_ff670od,1579641971.0,"For Rockefeller, he started at $16 a month at 16 years old in 1855. That's equivalent to $472 in today's money, then after his 3 months of apprenticeship were up he made $31 a month, or $915. After his first year he made $50 a month, or  $1,476 a month.    

The average day laborer was making [10-15$](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=miun.ajb5449.0001.001&view=1up&seq=164) a month with board. By his 4th month working Rockefeller was making double what the higher paid laborers were making.

By 1859 Rockefeller had $800 saved up in order to join with Maurice Clark in starting a business. That's roughly 35% of his income from 1855 to 1859. 

Their first year in business Rockefeller and Clark made $4,400, or around $136,000. By their second year they made $17,000 (half a million dollars).   

Don't get me wrong, what Rockefeller did was impressive. But 16$ was good money for the times, especially considering he wasn't doing hard manual labor, and it was only for 3 months before his pay almost doubled into a tidy salary. By his second year he was making more than what a highly paid mechanic would make."

Most stocks took a hit to their price, so any company that could maintain it's dividend got an artificially high dividend yield. Therefore, by picking high dividend yield stocks during the great recession, you ended up with good companies at cheap prices.  

This is unlikely to work now because in a regular market, high dividend yield stocks are companies with poor management desperate to raise stock prices.

Anyway, REITs are great, but being on the stock market leaves them with some of the same issues, namely market efficiency. Now I'm sure that's up for debate on whether markets are actually efficient. But I think we can at least agree that there are degrees of efficiency, and the real estate market is far less efficient than the stock market.  

In just straight real estate I can go find someone who's just selling off the property of a late loved one, and really just wants to see it gone. Or go find a property that has bad management, buy it at a reasonable multiple of what it is currently making, and then raise rates to what the average is for the area (you can lose some people at first, but most are reticent to leave their home).  

That all being said, you hit the nail on the head in terms of risk. I don't think anyone else has actually mentioned that as a serious problem yet.  I work in a sector of the real estate market, and so my connections and experience give me a much better advantage than some random Joe, and without a solid grounding in CRE the risk is very high.

If they put in their due diligence and get a 10% return, the net gain is 80-85k. And that isn't even including the appreciation in their real estate.
