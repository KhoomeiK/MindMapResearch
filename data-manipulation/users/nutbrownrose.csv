bestoflegaladvice,ffefxie,t1_ffef04z,1579846485.0,"Also: a quick look through the pet-rehoming pages of the majority of the shelters in Western WA nearish the main airport (since I live here and so do most of the washingtonians in the state, I went with Western WA), shows that all require a minimum of picture ID and proof of ownership or a signed note from the owner. Most have waiting periods, require vet papers and more.

bestoflegaladvice,ffef04z,t1_ffearu2,1579845516.0,"When we got our golden from a reputable breeder, she asked us to wait to spay her until after 6 months because our girl was option B for showing (turns out you can't show a spayed/neutered dog). She was shown once, did not do well, and the breeder gave us the all-clear to spay her. LAOP may have been in a similar position (although I feel like this would be a thing to mention in the post, because a shown dog is more likely to be bred). Also, the more I think about this post, the more troll-y it feels. Reputable shelters don't spay within 48 hrs of getting a dog regardless if they know there's an owner wanting her back or not."

Megabus once cancelled a trip I was taking to an airport 4 hours away, but didn't tell us it was cancelled until after wehad arrived in Seattle, where my plane was headed.

I am an anxious adult, and I was an anxious child terrified of house fires as a kid. I made myself a list of what I would grab in the event, and my parents went over the evacuation procedure from the house (if the doorknob is cold, go out your door. If the doorknob is hot, climb on the dresser, open the window, push out the screen and climb carefully to the roof. Then yell as loud as you can for help).

I have what I call ""internal subtitles"" where I can sort of half-see words while people talk, and on screen subtitles interfere with my internal ones. Like, they go at a different pace, and also distract me because I read them in my own voice. I absolutely cannot read and listen at the same time. My brain does one or the other, never both. I can listen and do non-thinky things, like dishes or cross stitch, as long as I stop listening when I need to count intently (in cross stitch), but sometimes even laundry needs too much brain to listen while doing. It also slows me way down."
