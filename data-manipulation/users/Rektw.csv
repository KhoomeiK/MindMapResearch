They'll more than likely have their notes typed up after a minute.

However, always take the survey and give them the highest points possible because thats the only one that'll count. So if they ask you on a scale of 1 - 10 usually only a 9 or 10 would be counted for points, any other number (example: 7) will be counted as a big fat 0.
