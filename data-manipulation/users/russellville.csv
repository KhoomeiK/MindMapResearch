moog,ff99wvu,t3_es8zp7,1579708184.0,"I did something different.  I also have a mother 32 and logic and focusrite. 

What I did was, I connected my drum machine to my computer via USB, told the drum machine to slave to logic. the i took a midi out from the drum machine to the midi in on the M32.  Sync'd it that way. No audio out on the drum machine, so it's silent."

fender,fefgq7f,t1_fef9rl2,1579055968.0,">It played like a stiff Tele and a thin, souless acoustic. I mean there was something novel to it being a two in one deal and it was a little fun to tinker around with. 

Well said.  That's kind of what i would expect."

Music,fdsqjyy,t3_emx58c,1578706655.0,"Living on a lighted stage  
Approaches the unreal  
For those who think and feel  
In touch with some reality  
Beyond the gilded cage

Cast in this unlikely role  
Well equipped to act  
With insufficient tact  
One must put up barriers  
To keep oneself intact

Living in the limelight  
The universal dream  
For those who wish to seem  
Those who wish to be  
Must put aside the alienation  
Get on with the fascination  
The real relation  
The underlying theme

Living in a fisheye lens  
Caught in the camera eye  
I have no heart to lie  
I can't pretend a stranger  
Is a long awaited friend

All the world's indeed a stage  
And we are merely players  
Performers and portrayers  
Each another's audience  
Outside the gilded cage"

synology,fd9nvyi,t1_fd9gujy,1578235863.0,"hm, that's sounds like a good option to try. because that description is pretty much what i am referring to. your ""tunnel"" is your VPN connection and it sounds like all other connections are being blocked.  

it shouldn't be less secure because all of your outbound traffic should be going through that VPN still.  Your local traffic will not go through that ""tunnel"". Is it less ""secure"" - yea, but do you have virus infected and hackers inside your network? probably not."

Some people become anxious to see what's under the hood and what's coming. When I got the email from Synology about DSM 7 for a moment I thought about when I wanted to upgrade. 

And the fact that it is ""released"" (no matter the state or classification) some people think that it is ""good enough"" for them."
