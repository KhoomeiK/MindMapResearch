Advice,ffphu9z,t3_euhoq3,1580095408.0,"The best things you can do to prevent infection by any type of illness is to A) Wash your hands after you've been in contact with things other people have been touching and B) Keep your hands away from your face, especially your eyes - this is the most common way viruses find their way into your body.

Advice,ff991l3,t3_esc3m3,1579707637.0,"Former chef here -- as in I actually went to culinary school, did an apprenticeship with a crazy executive chef/owner, worked in a couple of countries and peaked out as an executive chef at a snobby resort.

I'm afraid I'm going to have to temper the ""Just go for it!"" comments in here. Food service is not an easy profession. The money isn't there until you've managed to work your way up the ladder and get into salaried positions. 

The hours can be a bit much. My very first salaried position as a sous chef required at least 50 hours a week. My last position as an executive chef required 60+ hours during the busy season. Most places don't offer benefits, and many are strictly seasonal.

A lot of your co-workers will have serious issues that they bring to work with them. The trope of the alcoholic chef, junkie dishwasher, or coked-out waitstaff is 100% rooted in reality.

It's really difficult on families and relationships in general. Chefs work every weekend, every holiday, just any time when the rest of everyone is getting together and having fun.

Somewhat similar to your current profession, it is very hard on one's body. The chef I apprenticed under had a larger pair of shoes he wore in the busy season because he was on his feet 12 hours a day in a hot kitchen and his feet swelled up.

I could go on and on.

So my most sincere advice is to stick to what you're doing, and explore breadmaking and other baking in your off-time. If you can learn to make a variety of baked goods, go introduce yourself to your local restaurants and try to become their source of baked goods (cakes, pies, etc.). Skilled and artistic bakers are difficult to come by, and most places don't have their own on staff. I have known a number of people who have taken that route and have very successful side businesses or turned them into their full time jobs."
Advice,ff7v1kq,t3_es4rhx,1579659032.0,"Xanax and Percocet? Fucking avoid. Xanax is a benzo, the only other addictive substance aside from alcohol where withdrawal can flat out kill you. And Percocet is an opioid. You know the opioid crisis going on? So yeah, these two can and will and are currently ruining lives all over.

LSD is (in my opinion) fine, but only assuming you have no latent mental health issues, and you do it in a good environment. Be aware though, a trip is a considerable time commitment, usually 8-12 hours, and a couple of days to feel totally normal again.

Weed and alcohol are (again in my opinion) fine in moderation. You're young and your brain is still developing and they can have a negative impact on that, so don't make them a habit."

TheoryOfReddit,feii4zk,t3_epb1r0,1579139069.0,"I've been on the Internet now for 26 years. So I have very much seen the culture of the 'net change. Things were actually pretty stable from the 90s to about 2009, just with more and more to do as time went on. In the last 10 years though, the culture has really changed.

Social media (especially Facebook) caused people to surround themselves with who and what they already knew. It turned from the Internet of discovery to the Internet of familiarity. The serendipitous nature of finding new things and interacting with people who were actually very different from yourself was part of the charm. It seems all too easy to settle into echo chambers now.

Another reason is an aspect of the Internet becoming ""for everybody"". That being it doesn't feel like a club anymore. You used to be able to find a group of people on a site or in a game and get to know each other, and as long as you weren't an asshole, you could find a real community there. The only reason you've ever made friends on-line or in real life is due to repeated proximity. With the sheer number of other users around, unless you settle into a very niche space, everyone is just a faceless mass of ""others"".

Another change has been the widespread adoption of smartphones and the rise of the ultra-casual user. Before this, being on the Internet generally meant you were sitting down somewhere and giving it your full attention. Now, a lot of the 'net is tuned for the user who pulls their phone out of their pocket and is ""eyeballs on"" for 60 seconds while they're waiting in line somewhere.

And finally, I think we're all just used to it. We've grown accustomed to everything that the Internet is, when it used to be interesting just to get on and ""surf the net"". I think a lot of us used to put ourselves out there a lot more and be more open."

Since you asked him and he's not admitting any wrong doing, I'd suggest counting out your pills after a refill (though the odds of the pharmacy mis-counting are almost zero), writing it down on a piece of paper you keep with the bottle, and marking off each time you take one.

Your eyes are going to be a big problem. Your tears will boil off since the boiling point of water in vacuum is less than -67C (-89F). Plus, this escape of water vapor will result in rapid cooling. Once your eyes are boiled dry and frozen, I don't think you'd be navigating by sight anymore.

The surface temperature of the moon can reach 127C (260F) so it's not just the sun, you have to consider radiant IR from the surface as well. It's not ""instantly crispy"" temperatures, but footwear is a factor, and it sure would limit your ability to stay out there.

Beyond that, I think all the capillaries in your skin would rupture. Normally not an issue (bruising and hickeys are a good example) but it could be a big problem at that scale. Blood near the surface would also be experiencing very low pressures, so like your eyes, it's well above the boiling point, resulting in bubbles in your bloodstream. This is the super bends.
