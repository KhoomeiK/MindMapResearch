If not, they will get the $25 immediately. Then the rest when I have it.  It would be so nice to get the water back on! My 72yr old grandfather in law and my 10yr old kiddo would be so happy.  I've tried to get loans but I dont meet the borrow criteria."

Advice,femdawo,t3_epxn39,1579249636.0,"Best friends are tricky... I lost mine due to telling her I couldn't stand seeing her go through what I did.  I couldn't stand seeing a man treat her poorly, and cheating on her daily. I went through it and I didnt want her to have a broken heart like I did.  So I told her how it was. From that day forward our relationship was drained out.  She couldn't talk to me openly and I missed her.  We decided to meet up and hash it out.  That ended with her telling me she loves me but she doesnt want to be friends. She said maybe one day our kids can meet and we can sit down and have a coffee or something but we needed to go our seperate ways. 
This is the same girl I was there for when we found her dad dead. The same girl who was here when my brother was dying in the hospital. The same girl who knew my darkest deepest secrets.  I still miss her to this day and will forever. I make posts about her periodically and publicly so she can see them if by chance she cared to look. She removed me from her life fully. Made her family do the same. We have one good friend in common and I harass her for updates.  She doesnt know. But atleast I know she is happy and enjoying her life.  

I guess what I'm saying is, if you hurt your best friend it takes time to heal and sometimes that healing never comes. I miss my best friend so flippin much, but I also know I hurt her so much too.  We cant fix what we already did, but we can cow to never do it again. Show your best friend you care. That you are really sorry.  Do random acts of kindness for her.  Help whatever you messed up. Dont give up if you love her! (:"
Advice,femcsbv,t1_felsank,1579248942.0,"I have informed them and provided proof to them, which got me an extension.  I was told they do not turn off water Friday- sunday so I will be okay for the weekend.  They told me I could get another extension if it gets approved. I'm going to do my best to find odd jobs around my city. Im only $45 short now. Which is good compared to what I was!  When I get the kiddo up for school I'm going to drive up there and pay what I have and ask they move the balance till next month.  Which was suggested to me on a facebook group! (: 

Thank you for the advice!"

selfimprovement,fekjlc2,t3_epng86,1579201402.0,"Find your hobbies OP! I love readying, but that puts you sitting down somewhere. I specifically like reading outside. 

What do you like? Writing, skating, swinging, biking, walking, arts and crafts, playing with friends, creating things, learn a new language, take your pet for a walk, do a side gig and soooooo many more things.   

Find something that makes you happy and go with it!"

Parenting,fcyhdfd,t3_ej75k0,1578080167.0,"For the moms who dont clean up after your family, you obviously have the ""perfect"" household.  I have a 10yr old boy, a 30yr old man and a 72yr old man all in my household. I clean everyday so it feels. 
I'm exhausted.  Yes I make them help me when they are around, but it can literally be 2min before the 30yr old throws his laundry on the floor and leaves his bag from work with absolutely nothing from or for work In it all over.... it also takes 2min for my 10yr old to play with legos and clean up almost all of them, leaving a handful of small ones behind along with his dirty socks and 4 books.  Then the 72yr old who doesnt remember where the sink is anymore... leaves dishes in livingroom and sometimes throws his forks and shoes down the hall that he doesnt even use cause he lives on the opposite side of the house.. 
Dont let me lie, there is so much more mess to mention, but you get the point. 

We also have 2 dogs, 1 cat and 2 fish.. that I care for as well. Kiddo helps walk 1 dog 1x a day.  

I dont throw out items as the one parent said, I dont even think they really are a parent, because one we live minimal as is. If I were to throw away one toy it would be missed as we dont have 100's just a handful that are played with. Also, if i threw out grandad or my husbands stuff well I'd be dead...  not sure how you can just throw the toys away for laying around when you are the one to pay to replace items in the home! 

It's a never ending dirty death trap, that's marriage/kids."
