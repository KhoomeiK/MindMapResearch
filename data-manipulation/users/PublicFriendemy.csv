PC strips FJMs music away from the personal, self-inspecting nature of ILYHB that makes it arguably one of the top albums of the decade. Instead, it decides to stretch “Holy Shit/Bored in the USA” into an hour long album with long, repetitive piano accompaniments.

Junior year is likely the worst year of your life. Seriously. Everyone thinks they’re hot shit (I did) but in reality they’re kinda fuckin morons (I was).

First time I ever failed a class was junior year, and I failed two. Didn’t even start one (online, self paced). I thought “wow I’m actually a fuck up”. 

I’ve suffered from depression most of my life and just spiraled.

Best tip lesson I learned to get through was to keep looking forward. Told myself everyday that I was a little closer to college, to freedom, to feeling fulfillment in life. Obviously, easier said than done. Take it from me, *it gets a lot fucking better after High School.*

Staying busy also helped me a lot. I worked a lot, but that didn’t really give me fulfillment or purpose (fuckin retail smh). I started camping/hiking a lot because nature calms me a lot. I found things that made me proud to accomplish, like reading more or backwood camping.

If you like reading, find some really good authors out of your comfort zone. I began reading a lot of Hemingway and Thoreau, I took a lot of their writings to heart.

Life is fuckin hard, and when we have to deal with depression on top of it, it all just feels unfair. You feel out of place, inadequate, sad. You begin to resent yourself.

Then you learn most people feel that way, their just better at hiding it. It’s human to feel this way. You’re a normal human being if you feel this way.
