One time I borrowed my wife's '55 Chevy Nomad to get it detailed after she revealed she had scratched the gorgeous cherry red paint job and covered it with fucking lipstick. Unfortunately while I was at work I had accidentally parked it under a crane and while showing the guys on the job site how to operate the crane my nincompoop sidekick distracted me and the 3 ton beam I was hoisting fell right on the damn car.

I mean look what happened when they let Grima live. He ran off back to Isengard and alerted Sauruman to their plans which caused more bloodshed.
