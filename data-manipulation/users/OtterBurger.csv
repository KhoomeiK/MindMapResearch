tfc,fcp5gcj,t3_eicp4m,1577851072.0,"Alright, Ryan, I'll bite. I mostly agree with you, but there's a lot of recency bias at play here--obviously a large part of that is that TFC have only been good up until recently, but:

GK: Frei's not your keeper of the decade? The only reason we got rid of him is because TFC for a very long time had a problem of constant turnover in this position, axing the starting GK once he earned around 100K to make the backup the starter because of perceived value under the salary cap. We got rid of Frei for cap room, for Kocic I think. Your own argument for Bono being on the bench is ""What's he done lately"", well what has Frei done lately? Won two MLS Cups. Westberg is good but letting Frei go was a mistake. At the very least, Frei should be on your bench instead of Bono.

CB: Gonzalez? Nah. Can Gonzalez make Zavaleta look good next to him? No. Can Moor? Yes. The Irwin/Moor trade was absolutely influential to finally having a decent MLS level defence. Moor was a massive leader that boosted everyone next to him. Every single time Moor missed a game, the effect was immediate and noticeable. He was a leader at the back we'd missed since Caldwell, who also deserves a shout out.

Feels like you're cheating having both Vazquez and Poz considering they're the same position

The rest of it, I pretty much agree with you, especially the fullbacks. But, here's a way more challenging thought experiment: what's the TFC \*worst\* XI of the past decade? Because it's easy to say the last 3 years of players are the best we've ever had, but there's like 100 real stinkers who've came and gone before them.

Cheers, bud, happy new year!"
