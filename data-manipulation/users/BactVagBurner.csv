AskReddit,ffiyqc8,t3_ett7fr,1579986011.0,"I helped my family too much. Like I sacrificed for them at a point when I should've been focused on my own career. If I had left them living in a weekly motel when my sister was still at home and my Dad had cancer, I would always feel guilty. Especially about my sister, because I wanted her to be in a better environment and be around people who made better choices. But they've never even thanked me for all the times I came up with rental deposits etc for them. I had a cancer scare from May-December of 2019 and no one even called to check on me after either biopsy. 

I mean, it's a very mixed bag. I think I did the right thing, but it didn't really work in the long run. I now have an incredibly anemic retirement account and I'll probably never own a home where I live (LA County). My sister turned out to be more like my parents than I had hoped for. And now I have this sense of betrayal etc. Like sometimes I feel like no one really loves anyone else, and I was a chump for loving them and doing all that family-loyalty stuff. I just don't know at this point."

Don't let your parents de-rail you. When I was a kid, mine hated me for doing well in school, being an athlete etc. They would try and shame me about being good at math. My mom bullied me into attempting their tax return when I was 7 (dad was away for work) and she likely bullied my brother into dropping out of high school. She tried that with me, said I ""thought I was better than"" him and tried to talk me into dropping out, too.

AskReddit,ffgl7pn,t3_etcyd6,1579908806.0,"A lot of this is that men have to be willing to change. When people talk about the patriarchy etc, it hurts everyone. It doesn't just slot women and children into impossible roles, it creates all this shit for men, too. People get mad about the conversation around toxic masculinity, but men have to be willing to let their friends & family know when they're vulnerable. When my Dad had cancer, I would drive him to chemo and he'd gripe about ""why should I take help from a girl!?"" etc the whole time. It was so alienating. I did that because it was the right thing to do, but he actually alienated my Mom and sister enough that they wouldn't do it. I moved back to the area to do it.

He didn't tell me when he got diagnosed with cancer, either, but left me on some contact list. So someone called me to tell me about his surgery but I had no idea he was even sick. I literally almost fell over. He thought he was being tough and shielding me, but in fact it was more like he was afraid to be vulnerable, even with his family. I told him, what if I had cancer and didn't tell you? And he got mad. But even though I know he was scared, it really shocked me that he tried to hide it from me.

I do think it's changing and some very masculine men are starting to share about difficult life events that happened to them. Like if you're a hockey fan, listen to the Ray & Dregs podcast from a couple weeks ago. When they had Olcyk on he talks about his cancer diagnosis, calling his old teammate Ray and telling him, and then at the end if I'm not mistaken he tells Ray he loves him when he's saying goodbye. Like it was nice to see two masculine, retired former athletes exhibiting these healthy friendship behaviors after so many decades. Instead of guys like my Dad who were maybe 10-15 years older and would just sort of try to not have feelings."

So you had people who could barely count in charge of counting all the drawers, getting change etc. At the same time, you were taking them away from the thing they were actually good at: interacting with people. 

Finally, they had a crazy policy of basically giving customers any discount they asked for. Empowering cashiers to do that for like a dinged up book makes sense in a way. But in some markets? Like people would ask for 1/2 off just to ask for 1/2 off. One day a middle-aged woman said, ""Watch this,"" to her friend, like excited to show her the scam. She asked me for half off on a boxed set, and I said, ""No, I can't give you half off just because. There's no problem with that boxed set. This is a business."" She left in a huff (but didn't ask for a manager, because WTF we can't just give the store away and she knew it). 

The other cashier was like, ""Oh my god! You shouldn't have done that! You'll get fired!"" I quit soon afterwards because it was just clearly just not a working business model. When they went out of business years later, the other cashier messaged me on facebook and admitted I was right."

Also: huge institutions move sloooooowwwwly. Understanding that will help keep you from getting frustrated. I think Meghan Markle's tenure as a royal is kind of a good illustration of this. The RF has been around for hundreds of years, it was unrealistic for her to think that as a newcomer to that world, she was going to make big changes in 2-3 years. 2-3 decades? Yes, of course. But expecting that extremely old-school, conservative ""firm"" to adapt to *her* was a very naive expectation, especially for a woman in her late 30s. If she'd kept her head down and just held on for a few years, death would've done a lot of the work for her. Princess Michael of Kent, Prince Charles, the Duke of Edinburgh - all of these people are 70+, they're in God's waiting room as it is. If something is important to you, if you want to make a change, sometimes you will have to keep your head down, observe, have a duck's back and hold on/wait it out. Your time will come.

They're trying to unilaterally tell the RF that they're keeping the house that was on loan, and the title that's really the Queen's to dole out. They're like spoiled, stupid teenagers. Their poor baby, like Christ I wouldn't let these two watch a dog. 

I don't think it will take a conspiracy to kill Harry & Meghan. I think their selfishness, bad decision making and sordid friends (The Mulroneys!? How are you claiming woke points when you're friends with the famously evil, Canadian Conservative dynasty the *Mulroneys*?) will do that for them."

Also, she has a nice impulse but she'll be out of business in no time if she operates in the way you describe. What will happen to those EU nationals then?"

AskMen,fdigbla,t3_elacu8,1578442261.0,"I think it's less lying than guesstimating. A lot of men aren't finished growing until they're out of their teens, and it's not like they're getting measured at the doctor's office that often. I mean, I went four years between physicals once, and if it isn't a new doctor they're probably not even going to measure you. So I just suspect there's a lot of guesstimating going on in line at the DMV."

todayilearned,fdi8o5h,t3_elf4n0,1578437725.0,"I have a cousin who worked for the CIA. Her parents are ultra-Catholic and she can't think for herself. So complex issues like abortion = killing babies, period. *But what if you got raped, Jill? Would you want to bring the rapist's child into the world?* Oh that would never happen to **me**! Children should obey their parents and take care of them in old age, period. *But what about people who were abused as kids, Jill? Or people who grew up in foster care with no single parental figures?* Oh, CITY PEOPLE (code for black & brown people) are different. We're not talking about CITY PEOPLE! 

Anyway, she is a terrifyingly efficient person with no moral compass of her own, she just accepts the information she receives without question and never thinks critically. So yes, the CIA is terrifying to me, because I know the type of brainwashed creep they recruit. A lot of ultra-Catholic or Duggary types in that organization."
