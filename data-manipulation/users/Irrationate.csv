LifeProTips,fgwo5ze,t3_f0q5vi,1581163857.0,One time my boss’s boss told her to blow up on me in front of other people to assert that she is in charge.

They promoted her over me when everyone else in the company knows it should have been me. Naturally I take lead on a lot of things because I’m more experienced but I never make decisions without her approval first.
