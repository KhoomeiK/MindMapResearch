Make your own hope. I could give you all the reasons I want but you would just find ways to shoot them down. I used to be the same way and honestly the only way I got out of it was by sheer willpower because literally nothing in the world is designed to make a depressed person less depressed. I don't think there's anything I can do to convince you because you've already convinced yourself. I try to think of coping as similar to palliative care. I'm not saying you can fix everything, but you can suffer less.

I survive out of spite because sometimes it feels like the universe is trying to kill me and i can't let it get that satisfaction.

EDIT: oh idk if this helps but here's a safety plan I made for my own use when feeling suicidal; when i started working in suicide prevention organizations they dug it so i made it available publicly for free. it has my name on it so i'm effectively doxxing myself but it can be helpful to others, so: [https://www.sfsuicide.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIY-safety-plan.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2\_3STuF3ynRA32q3vtr6HnoZSJEWtDRMlOFQUcbUQSQ7TYDHwYDesHmMc](https://www.sfsuicide.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/DIY-safety-plan.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2_3STuF3ynRA32q3vtr6HnoZSJEWtDRMlOFQUcbUQSQ7TYDHwYDesHmMc)

hang in there commenter! except don't hang yourself. hold on with your hands."
CasualConversation,fdqnhws,t1_fdqeahd,1578670823.0,"comparing trauma doesn't make sense, everyone's traumatized in their own way. take me for example: not at all the same situation as you. however: two time suicide survivor, has about four or five different mental illnesses, abused my whole childhood (and homeschooled until HS, so i had no connection with kids my own age and had no idea this wasn't normal and just took the abuse), transgender, in a big heaping hole of debt and currently unemployed and running low on food stamps. we all have our own struggles. i'm surprisingly pretty happy though. i have made friends by being vulnerable and listening to people at their lowest, so they in turn are vulnerable with me. i have cut off toxic family members. i've learned fun recipes for rice and beans and chicken so food stamps aren't as depressing. i take hot baths when my body aches (i have joint issues that flare up when it gets cold or rainy out). i journal and try to figure out why i feel the things i do.

one thing that's helped me is [radical acceptance.](https://psychcentral.com/blog/what-it-really-means-to-practice-radical-acceptance/) doesn't work for everyone but helps for me. also: prioritizing self-care. if you're already poor and dying (and let's be real, we're all dying, some just faster than others), why not make the ride into the ground as comfortable as possible? before you say you're too poor for self-care, i don't mean necessarily getting a pedicure every day or treating yourself to a fancy meal. self-care can be meditation, playing with your kids, taking some time to read a book or watch tv by yourself instead of dealing with your responsibilities, whatever helps you.

this isn't advice of course. once again, i keep repeating this disclaimer over and over because people don't always understand it, everyone is different. one size does not fit all. just trying to explain how i cope.

life is miserable but i don't have to keep fighting how unfair my lot is. i'm not saying you have to ""think positive"" but there comes a time when i had to tell myself, look, this is the way things are right now and it sucks, there is literally nothing else to do but proceed from here since i can't change the past. how to proceed from here in the most painless and helpful way?

p.s. even if you're not suicidal, suicide hotlines or warmlines offer free and anonymous counseling so even if you can't afford therapy, might be worth calling one sometimes. they might triage you if they have a more suicidal person on the line, but you can always call back later. still better than paying hundreds for therapy you can't afford. i worked at san francisco's suicide hotlines and we got calls from all over the country because the hotline is 24/7 and is well-staffed enough to take non-emergency calls."
