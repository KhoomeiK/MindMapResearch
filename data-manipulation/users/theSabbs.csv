MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fgmlfcg,t1_fggx7vs,1580926964.0,"It's so helpful reading these stories of people who genuinely like working at small family owned places. My experience working at a small 11-person family owned company was not positive, because my personality didn't mesh with those in the family very well. Therefore, I don't have a ton of job loyalty other than wanting to stay at a company long enough so it looks good on my resume. Also, my current employer requires 3 years before you're fully vested in the 401k, so that's my minimum for staying here."
AskWomenOver30,fgiki66,t1_fghpmov,1580824282.0,"I think I'm in this boat too. It matters a lot more what weight I'm at. I've been both in a healthy range and in a very overweight range. I definitely get more looks and treated nicer by strangers at the lower weight, but my friends and family treat me the same."
personalfinance,fghftmm,t1_fghb4k8,1580783864.0,"Yes, but this is multiple screens later, after making it seem like it's the same $40 initially"
personalfinance,fghfqc3,t3_ey8l7i,1580783805.0,I noticed this a few days ago when submitting my taxes too and was pissed! I thought it was the same $40 they'd charged previously too. Glad it wasn't just me.
relationships,fgh08yq,t1_fgggco6,1580773614.0,"Agree so hard with this comment. Document everything. For me, this was important to validate what I was feeling and experiencing, because otherwise I would constantly think ""oh I must've overreacted, it must've not been that bad"". 

I had a manager once who I should've known not to work for. Even in the interview panel, I thought everyone liked me but when I got done with her interview I thought to myself I wasn't going to get the job because she seemed to hate me. 

Over the course of my first few months she would constantly say rude things and overreact emotionally. Insinuating that my direct reports didn't respect me (I was a first time supervisor and she was the manager above me), undermining me in front of my team, not allowing me to do things which I felt would be a benefit to my development (which I was able to do after she left and was a huge help indeed), being way too harsh about minor infractions. I became scared of doing my job because she was always in the background waiting to criticize, control or scold me. 

Her job was phased out and she was in the process of applying for a lateral role. As a miraculous coincidence, we had another one of our disagreements where she thought something I said would be held against her by her manager, so she told me that she was going to ""throw me under the bus"" to show that I was wrong and she was right. I ended up getting so frustrated that I spoke with HR who suggested I speak with her manager, so I did. I told my side of the story and the manager reassured me that I wasn't the first person to go to HR about her. She did not get the job she was interviewing for and left the company. Life got so so much better at that job."
aww,fgguwu0,t1_fggowmp,1580770113.0,I must have a particularly persistent kitten then...
AskWomenOver30,fgguqc5,t1_fggtarh,1580769996.0,Thank you for the kind words. I've had a rough few years so I'm hopeful that this year is the start of my good life as well.

konmari,fggopy8,t3_ey9hiq,1580766264.0,"Okay, I'll rephrase. It matters less who would be getting rid of the shirts (him vs her) and more that she commented on how many t shirts he has... konmari is not about how much of something someone has. You can have 100 t shirts and still be following konmari principles."
aww,fggnh34,t1_fggkf1l,1580765520.0,When does this end? Cause I have a 6 month old kitten and she has consistently been in this phase
konmari,fgglhct,t1_fggcubs,1580764346.0,"I, much like the commenter above, get the sense that OP wishes she could get rid of some of the t shirts. A lot of people on the sub have been confusing konmari with minimalism which is why I think the comment is helpful."
AskWomenOver30,fggc19v,t1_fgfe41e,1580758681.0,"As a 27 year old on a similar journey, this brings me hope. I am fighting my way out of being in poverty and just this year have started taking myself to good doctors who care about my issues (teeth, acne, facial hair) and am working on resolving them. Coupled with being able to afford better clothes and developing a good skincare routine, I think I'm only going up from here"
minimalism,fg105ud,t1_fg0dmei,1580418383.0,"I have begun keeping a ""donation bag"" in my closet this year and it has been a life saver! I toss everything similar to what the other poster said in the bag and then drop off to the Goodwill when it gets full, a few times a year."
AskReddit,ffynyaj,t3_evqtcc,1580350930.0,So I have CPTSD and just realized a lot of the symptoms of it are similar to generally healthy ppl feeling unhappy. Yay for realizations /s.
AskWomenOver30,ffmied0,t1_ffm0ocw,1580055155.0,I think that at least cooking and novels are actually very healthy
CPTSD,ffm2a8u,t3_eu51bu,1580047349.0,"I don't do some of those same things, but I definitely get the strong desire to be taken care of when I am experiencing a tough time. My partner and I don't live together yet, and last week when I was really anxious about work, I unilaterally decided I was going to move into his place this weekend instead of in 3 months like we planned, after my lease expires. I came to my senses when I was feeling better, but this wasn't the first time my coping mechanism was ""I'll just move in with him and he'll take care of me and fix everything"""
AskWomenOver30,ffiz45x,t1_ffit8qc,1579986292.0,"Silbersprigs is right. Once you figure out what causing your insecurity and stop feeling threatened by other women, you will likely also stop worrying about threatening others"
AskWomenOver30,ffgd70v,t3_er57qb,1579903625.0,"His laid back attitude, sense of humor, the way he listens to me and takes care of me, and he's tall, cute, and and has nice arms/shoulders. Drool."
AskWomenOver30,ffgck0y,t3_erdjg7,1579903228.0,"Work. Being a new manager at a new company and one of thr youngest, if not the youngest here. It's been almost 6 months and I struggle with feeling like I made the right choice sometimes"
AskWomenOver30,ffgag8c,t3_ers6rg,1579901943.0,"I'll tell you my experience with that. I went to college, my boyfriend at the time didn't. I made new friends and learned and grew. He didn't. We ended up drifting apart and breaking up. 

My friends story is different though. She met her bf in high school. They both went to different colleges, but he came to visit often. They stayed together and got married last year after 7 years of dating. 

So either thing could happen. Easier said than done, but live your life focusing on your needs. If things are meant to be with this guy, then it will work out. But don't hold yourself back for anybody"
AskWomenOver30,fffkiru,t1_ff7ts3s,1579885941.0,Realizing you're an introvert is huge. I'm going through the same realization this past year and learning to accept it more
AskWomenOver30,fffb31o,t3_esfp4b,1579880036.0,"Can't give a good answer but in chiming in to say I'm in a similar place. At 27 and in my first time management role, I struggle hard with people liking me and my work. It's the first time I've been challenged like this so it's something I'm working thru with my therapist."

AskWomenOver30,ffdsq4o,t3_et112k,1579827971.0,"I thought I was going to have good advice for you as I kind of was in a similar situation before. Choosing between a guy who was reliable, had no ulterior motives and was truly my best friend (the ""boring"" one) versus one who was exciting and creative and ultimately too unstable (the ""passion""). I obvs chose the more stabe route but am very happy with my choice, a year later, and excited for a future. 

If you really had to stick with these two, I'd choose the boring option for you too. But honestly I think you should dump em both and move on to someone new, after some therapy and time alone. I've done the therapy and time alone route and it was so helpful!"
HumansBeingBros,ffdk458,t1_ffd7fbj,1579822571.0,"I think the assumption comes from a place of experience. I also thought the same thing, because I was always the ""considerate"" child and it was because of having to grow up way too fast myself."

AskReddit,ffc3ta8,t3_esps5n,1579790850.0,Failing and being ridiculed for it
CPTSD,ffa2zij,t3_es9yg6,1579726853.0,"Yes, my boyfriend and I just had a long talk that included this. There was a lot of background info, but the takeaway was that he cares about me and gets worried that I am reconsidering our relationship because of how strongly I react (overreact) to things that he does that bother me.... 

That's another, unrelated, issue due to my past. When something triggers a deep insecurity of mine, rather than communicating that it bothers me, I shut down. Completely. Like not talking and sitting in a dark room and not responding to ""what's wrong?"". While it doesn't happen often, it has happened a 2-3 times this year. Not my best habit."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,ff53mte,t3_ernv9x,1579579318.0,"This calculator says I'm in the top 10% of my country based on household income. That is very weird to think of, since I just started making my salary 6 months ago, it's nowhere near 6 figure range, and I grew up severely poor.

Edit to add that I just ran the numbers based on my family of origin's info. We were 5 people and my parents together made less than 60k (i used that just to make it easy) and apparently we were right at the 40% mark. It's crazy to think we were wealthier than 40% of households because we were struggling"
