Ive learned recently that if I listen to what my anxiety is trying to tell me, I can do something about it. In my situation, I was worried about not measuring up to other people's expectations of me. I must please everyone all the time, and if I dont, no one will like me. This is a kind of extreme dialectic. My fears are certainly valid. Fitting into society keeps us safe, whether it be from ice age predators or public ridicule. But this thought patterns causes much suffering, because realistically, people come in all different makes and models: extroverted, introverted, book smart, street smart, compassionate, apathetic etc. It is impossible to please everyone.

PhonesAreBad,feamq8p,t1_fe845yx,1578950365.0,"Kind of. The line of thought being, if young people under 21 aren't allowed to buy firearms because of safety issues, neither should they be allowed cellphones. Senator Rodgers himself said he wouldn't vote for the bill to pass, but to start the conversation regarding removing rights from innocent people. 

I live in Vermont, so I understand why people want to keep their firearms. Many people use them to stock their freezers with game for the winter, but many people have them for self defense. In rural VT, it can take a long time for police to respond, and so many Vermonters feel safer having the option to protect themselves in the event of a break in, or violent crime. 

To be honest, I feel like it's a far reach trying to make the connection between gun rights, and adolescent cell phone use. I'm not totally sure why he went about it this way."

What you say about avoiding discussing expectations before a relationship may apply to dating, but not marriage. Adults discuss what they want from a relationship when they are serious enough, so I would expect that people should talk about whether or not they want children, or be in an open relationship. These are pretty important issues and life goals to not talk about before getting married. If anything, people are way more open to talking about being in open relationships, so these are definitely things that should be addressed. Not everyone will, and unfortunately, this is the result. It sucks for everyone."

Marriage,fdnekye,t1_fdnb8io,1578584141.0,"That's fine if monogamy doesn't work for them. But that should be something discussed before committing to what is assumed to be a monogamous relationship.

CATHELP,fdn1y6f,t3_elzh56,1578574825.0,"Stress can cause upper respiratory symptoms in cats. Many cats have herpes virus, which is a chronic upper respiratory condition which can flare up in times of stress. If your kitty is acting sick, starts to get excessive discharge from the eyes or nose, has a decreased appetite, or his eyes become red or inflamed, call your vet, and get him in to be seen. Secondary bacterial infections are common with herpes, and can be treated if necessary. 

I would call your vet anyway and schedule an appointment just to establish care, and make sure everything checks out ok. A lot of rescues run on donations only, and getting everyone up to date on vaccines, tested for FeLV/FIV, dewormed appropriately, etc. is not financially possible. Until Mr. Handsome is seen by your vet, I would keep him separated from the other cats in the house, just to make sure he doesn't have something catchy.

It causes neurologic effects, hyperexcitability, dysphoria and urinary incontinence. The picture here looks like this dog already got a dose of apomorphine, to induce vomiting (that's why she looks stoned- apo is an opiate) 

CBD isn't even prescribed or recommended. We have a ""suggested"" CBD dose, but since CBD use is so new, there are not enough clinical trials to be able to formally prescribe it. We use that suggested dose, based on preliminary trials, and it's more an effort to prevent overdose, since clients will use it regardless of whether the vet prescribed it.

TrueOffMyChest,fda7hg9,t3_ekad1u,1578242664.0,"Just spent an hour reading about Iran's history on Wikipedia. It's only one source, and I feel there is a lot left out. In the US, the Middle East is portrayed as a lawless, radicalized area, but reading about Iran's revolutions, and your most current constitution has me confused as to how this skewed image has come to be. My intuition tells me there is a lot more at play here, particularly regarding the demand for fossil fuels, and international relations between the US, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. I'm sure I'm missing more.

Can you expand upon this, so I can better understand what is going on here? I know I'm pretty ignorant on the topic of this conflict, but at my core, I fear war. I also feel like many of my countrymen, particularly me and the younger generations come from a more empathetic and compassionate place, and truly mourn the loss of life, the pain and suffering a war will cause. I don't know you, but I know you are a person, just like me who worries about their family and their future.

I (I'm a woman, for context) had my first crush in the 3rd grade, on a boy named Mike. One of my gay friends, Let's call him Tim, had his first crush on a boy, Sam, in the 3rd grade too. Both of us are instinctually attracted to that gender, me to Mike cuz I'm straight, and Tim to Sam because he is gay. 

I never had an ""I'm straight!"" moment, so I've never had to explain myself or my preferences. People in the LGBTQ community don't have that luxury. Attraction can be immediately interpreted as something of a strictly sexual nature, when in fact I think it really comes down to, bisexuals have crushes on both guys and gals.

It sounds silly, and simplified but I think if your sister is bisexual, she probably didn't share any of her girl crushes with your parents, given the social stigma of homosexuality. She is now a teenager, and since your parents missed the ""puppy love"" stages of your sister's development, it makes sense that they make the immediate connection of her bisexuality to actual sexuality, rather than her orientation. 

I'm proud of you for supporting your sister. Maybe you can try to shift your parent's perspective by bringing the conversation about what bisexuality really is. She crushes on both boys and girls."

It causes neurologic effects, hyperexcitability, dysphoria and urinary incontinence. The picture here looks like this dog already got a dose of apomorphine, to induce vomiting (that's why she looks stoned- apo is an opiate) 

CBD isn't even prescribed or recommended. We have a ""suggested"" CBD dose, but since CBD use is so new, there are not enough clinical trials to be able to formally prescribe it. We use that suggested dose, based on preliminary trials, and it's more an effort to prevent overdose, since clients will use it regardless of whether the vet prescribed it.

rareinsults,fdjzog9,t1_fdjj022,1578492360.0,"I always thought I was weird in that I tasted vomit in certain chocolate. I grew up in America, eating Hershey's and thought I really didn't like chocolate because of this. Then I tried European chocolate, and have never looked back. 

I recently learned that Hershey's chocolate has butyric acid in it, which gives it that weird vomit taste (also found in parmesan cheese, and rancid butter- Yum!)"

TrueOffMyChest,fda7hg9,t3_ekad1u,1578242664.0,"Just spent an hour reading about Iran's history on Wikipedia. It's only one source, and I feel there is a lot left out. In the US, the Middle East is portrayed as a lawless, radicalized area, but reading about Iran's revolutions, and your most current constitution has me confused as to how this skewed image has come to be. My intuition tells me there is a lot more at play here, particularly regarding the demand for fossil fuels, and international relations between the US, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. I'm sure I'm missing more.

Can you expand upon this, so I can better understand what is going on here? I know I'm pretty ignorant on the topic of this conflict, but at my core, I fear war. I also feel like many of my countrymen, particularly me and the younger generations come from a more empathetic and compassionate place, and truly mourn the loss of life, the pain and suffering a war will cause. I don't know you, but I know you are a person, just like me who worries about their family and their future. I commend you for putting this post out there, so that we may open a conversation about how we can all be better."

insaneparents,fcqjpkv,t3_eiep1e,1577887212.0,"What if you try explaining it in terms of who your sister ""likes"". 

I (I'm a woman, for context) had my first crush in the 3rd grade, on a boy named Mike. One of my gay friends, Let's call him Tim, had his first crush on a boy, Sam, in the 3rd grade too. Both of us are instinctually attracted to that gender, me to Mike cuz I'm straight, and Tim to Sam because he is gay. 

I never had an ""I'm straight!"" moment, so I've never had to explain myself or my preferences. People in the LGBTQ community don't have that luxury. Attraction can be immediately interpreted as something of a strictly sexual nature, when in fact I think it really comes down to, bisexuals have crushes on both guys and gals.

It sounds silly, and simplified but I think if your sister is bisexual, she probably didn't share any of her girl crushes with your parents, given the social stigma of homosexuality. She is now a teenager, and since your parents missed the ""puppy love"" stages of your sister's development, it makes sense that they make the immediate connection of her bisexuality to actual sexuality, rather than her orientation. 

I'm proud of you for supporting your sister. Maybe you can try to shift your parent's perspective by bringing the conversation about what bisexuality really is. She crushes on both boys and girls."
