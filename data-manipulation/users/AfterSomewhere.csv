As most children of nps, I often assume everything is my fault, or that I've done something terribly wrong.  2. When I start questioning my worth, I remind myself of my attributes, or something good I've done. It works! I may have lived in fear of being abandoned by my parents, but I will no longer abandon myself.  A friend once told me I had no armour. I had no idea what that was, but dammit, I've decided to build my own suit of armour, and wear it proudly. You can too."
