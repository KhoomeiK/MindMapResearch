BipolarReddit,ff9w1tq,t1_ff8rffx,1579722755.0,Thank you! I'm all checked in for my surgery at the hospital.
BipolarReddit,ff7zbhv,t1_ff7um8w,1579661963.0,"My GP said he doesn't want anything to do with my psych meds anymore unfortunately, my ""case is too complex"" (his words) so yeah. 

But that is such a good idea about hospital psychiatrists. I will keep that thought in my back pocket. 

That's really good advice, thank you."
BipolarReddit,ff7szfk,t1_ff6s39h,1579657620.0,"Thank you so much. I scheduled on-the-phone therapy and social worker appointments, for the day after surgery, to give me support. I hope it's enough.

My caregiver also said she will stay with me at least until my surgery is over so yay for that. :D I'll get to wake up to a familiar face in the recovery room. It's super nice of her.

Thanks for your kind words."
BipolarReddit,ff7sstx,t1_ff6zfdd,1579657494.0,"I do have an emergency night time med. (High dose seroquel) 

Maybe I'll take that...although I have to wake up super early for the surgery, someone is going to drive me hours away, and I have to get me and my toddler ready so I really can't afford to be ""hung over.""

Unfortunately my pdoc switched practices and gave me lots of refills while I wait for her new practice to take my insurance.

I have a therapy appointment and a social worker appointment scheduled both over the phone for the day after my surgery while I'm still in the hospital. I hope it helps me."
bipolar2,ff3kg40,t3_ere5te,1579542949.0,"I'm still more tired than I used to be, but for the most part the tiredness goes away. Make sure to take it with 350 calories, it can help the side-effects. 

To me, it is worth it instead of being manic."
bipolar2,few5oqn,t3_eqoxj8,1579405765.0,"I am so happy for you! No I mean it, I feel good feelings inside after reading this. :D"
cursedimages,fevaj40,t1_fev013c,1579395130.0,And Prednisone.
bipolar,feueexk,t3_eqmtoi,1579385734.0,Wow awesome! You are truly skilled.
bipolar2,feudp1i,t3_eqk35y,1579385590.0,Thinking of one thing coming up that I can look forward to.
bipolar,feuddsh,t3_eqgb0i,1579385491.0,"Thank you, I needed this.

I need to be patient with myself.

I still get mood swings, although less severe, on meds. I probably need them adjusted but I'm stuck for now as my pdoc just switched to another place. 

I need to be patient."
millionairemakers,fep3w10,t3_eq81a8,1579311557.0,Yay!
