politics,ffaf1lo,t1_ffachpu,1579734194.0,"For some topics, sure. But when politics effects the work you do, such as trade policies effecting the bill of materials cost of the products you design/build but people still don't want to discuss the policies and their implications since their ""political"", it's a big problem."
politics,ffabxyc,t1_ff9me34,1579731926.0,I think that is a big part of the problem. Being able to debate openly helps people find common ground. The fact that political discussion in person is shunned but we are bombarded with ads and the opinions of pundits just makes people even more engrained in whatever belief they had.

leanfire,feiq3b2,t3_epa6jz,1579144398.0,I've got a 95 BMW R850R with over 105k miles on it. Wouldn't hesitate to ride it across the country too during summer. Another bonus is the the insurance cost is so low that the percentage they reduce my other cars' policy rates by totals more than what I pay to have the motorcycle insured.

todayilearned,fci4qh8,t1_fchxmwe,1577657767.0,I think Bozeman's income gets dragged down a bit by students at MSU. It is crazy how much growth we've seen here in the last 20 years. If it's not better planned for we're going to be in a lot of trouble.
todayilearned,fchv7vp,t1_fchupdm,1577654540.0,"Nope, Bozeman area, but the stats are really similar between here and Whitefish. Good guess!"
todayilearned,fchnhf4,t1_fchhsmr,1577652048.0,Unless you live where I do in MT. Median house price where I live is $460k and median houshold income is <50k. But at least there are some good jobs here.
