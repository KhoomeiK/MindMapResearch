AskReddit,fepln8v,t3_eq9k9o,1579323753.0,"I saw Counting Crows at a big, multi-band charity thing and the lead singer was so drunk he forgot the words to their own songs, tripped over the amp, spilled his drink on himself, and at one point tripped over the amp. They were on stage for maybe 4 or 5 songs and you could tell the rest of the band had all but given up on him.

Barenaked Ladies was also there though and they more than made up for Counting Crows' shitty performance. One of the best sets I've seen, hands-down."

AskReddit,fen6fkx,t1_femucis,1579278001.0,"You are so right. Obviously I need to brush up on my HP lol. 

My point still stands though I think. The balls it took to argue with the Sorting Hat (as a baby first-year no less) are exactly why the hat put Neville in Gryffindor in the first place. He had it in him even if he himself didn't see it yet."
AskReddit,femsrll,t1_femryx8,1579268561.0,"My personal headcanon is that a lot of the main characters should have been in other houses, but because they had the guts to ask to be in Gryffindor for various reasons, the hat took that bravery as a sign they belonged there. Harry ""could have been great"" as a Slytherin, we all know Hermione would have fucking killed it in Ravenclaw, and Ron was the epitome of a loyal/fair play Hufflepuff. But Ron's whole family was in Gryffindor, so he asked to be too (didn't want to be the family disappointment), Hermione had done a ton of research on Hogwarts and come to her own conclusion that Gryffindor was best, and because Ron made such an impression on Harry (and so did Malfoy) Harry had no desire to go to Slytherin.

I think Neville was the same way. His parents were in Gryffindor with the Marauders, they showed great bravery in the first war against Voldemort, and he felt the need to live up to that. ~~So even though he would have been perfectly comfortable in Hufflepuff, he asked to be in Gryffindor.~~

*Edit: I had it wrong, the Hat initially suggested Neville be in Gryffindor but Neville had the audacity to argue with it, saying he'd be better in Hufflepuff because he didn't believe in himself yet. But that audacity is exactly the reason the Hat placed him in Gryffindor in the first place, so I think my point still stands."

Back then I didn't know ASL, so I just made up some that felt like they made sense, but you could absolutely teach a dog a pretty extensive vocab of easy hand signs no matter the breed. :)"

kansascity,fdkvc2u,t3_elwvgk,1578511913.0,"The Parkville Coffee House is great, they have an excellent cafe and plenty of tables upstairs & on the cafe floor to spread out on. 

Once the weather is a bit better I like Headrush in Briarcliff as well, they have a big outdoor area with a firepit and plugs for your laptop. (Also great coffee & tea, they roast their own beans.)"

AdviceAnimals,fcxmndo,t1_fcwym1q,1578066587.0,"When I taught driving lessons, highway driving was a big concern for a lot of my students because to them, fast = scary. But once we were up there, I'd talk about how on the highway, going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast, and I'd even tell the good ones that sometimes the speed limit doesn't count on a jam-packed highway. If the flow of traffic is 85 mph and it's busy, you don't want to be the guy trying to do the speed limit at 65. 

A lot of students get stressed when merging (which is understandable, it can be scary!) but as a teacher my job was to tell them, ""you need to be going faster, faster, highway speeds by the top of the ramp"" and make them practice until they got it. If you're learning from a parent (or even a bad/lazy driving teacher) that kind of pressure doesn't always get applied and then you end up with super hesitant drivers."
AskReddit,fcuj3v7,t1_fcu4kdu,1577982158.0,"When I had one we put it in the garage. Too noisy to have inside, plus the chance of it spilling while I was filling/emptying/checking it compulsively was high so concrete floors were the best option lol."

My bf grew up rural and almost never wore his seatbelt when I met him. I told him that for every time he put it on before the car or I reminded him to, he'd get a kiss. Guess what he does now, the second he gets in the car?"

Which is not to say that the espresso machines at Starbucks aren't super cool, because they are! You push a button to tell the machine how many shots of espresso you want and it just... does it all. No manual grinding or tamping, just, * boop * espresso! And steaming milk is like a fun mini-game, to get a good froth you have to be paying attention, keeping the level juuust right, and then stopping at the right temperature."
