mbti,ffi0q8w,t1_fby42y4,1579961547.0,What if one of your functions is unhealthy or undeveloped? It's not so easy
mbti,ffhyyx2,t1_ffhyadc,1579959796.0,">But... The way that you perceive things IS how you perceive life

Depends on what exactly do we mean by perceiving life. I understood OP statement in a way where perceiving life equals seeing the meaning of life in a way. Which is not what mbti is about.

Perceiving things however in my view is about actually taking in external imput, so that's what I meant by it."
mbti,ffhu6rq,t1_ffhh64y,1579954087.0,">Dominant Ni stares at people while speaking or listening. 

You sure? If someone has anxiety it may not be the case. I remember never being able to look people in the eyes."
mbti,ffhu5cu,t1_ffhi3sj,1579954029.0,"That seems good. Here, have some bacon."
mbti,ffhu27p,t3_etoy7m,1579953904.0,"Functions don't really show you what is your perception of life. It shows you what are you using to function in life. Shows how you perceive things, not how you perceive life."
mbti,ffhtzkk,t1_ffhom5g,1579953802.0,"Disagree. You can force yourself to change your perception but it's not gonna be natural for you. For example, using Se is always hard thing that takes lots of energy, there's no option that it would ever be my dominant functions. It goes against everything else."
estp,ffhtr4e,t3_etnmnz,1579953466.0,Ni is not responsible for his behaviour at all. He literally uses Ti-Se. Or Ti-Ne. I can see both but it's hard to say which one is prevalent
mbti,ffhtm31,t1_ffescn5,1579953266.0,I got Intj in this one
TrueENTPs,ffesdxk,t3_esxldr,1579863248.0,"Fuck you too!! 

(Hopefully someone noticed allusion to Coming To America)"
mbti,ffesc1p,t3_eswa7e,1579863174.0,Fiiiinally someone did this
mbti,ffesano,t3_et3wng,1579863118.0,"INTP and INFP are not so easy to confuse when you have the vibe of each type. INFPs are pretty rational and not much like the stereotype, but INTPs have very specific aura about them.  

(Also they usually have this face expression like someone just slapped them with a hammer and they just noticed it. Sorry not sorry it's true. INFPs are thinking and lost in their thoughts but they don't have the same expression.)"
mbti,ffes5mh,t3_et8qyv,1579862917.0,Which test you've taken? Do you have link?
infj,ffen8eb,t3_et1ml7,1579855531.0,"I do like praise but feel very uncomfortable with it at the same time, because it should be a standard in my mind. Like, it should not be considered special achievement, it should be normal level of quality for everyone."

I don't know what you did, nor what you went through (other than what you described in post.) But I know there's nothing else you can do, than to keep trying and move onwards. It's the only progress you can make. And since you're reading this, you've obviously been strong enough to march on. The part with ""there ain't no other step than one foot right in front of the other"" makes me really love this song, cause it's simplifies everything to one simple step. Oh yeah, putting one foot in front of the other is not gonna be easy, it's gonna be messy, and painful, but also freeing in a way. 


There are things you are, and then things you're not. And it's gotta be enough. You've made mistakes, you might have suffered with no fault on your own, doesn't matter cause life's not fair.
And all you can do is make the best out of what you have.


At the end we all keep marching on, and I couldn't be more proud out of every single one of you who keep pushing on even though it's hard, and seems impossible at times.


It all comes down to one thing - one foot in front of the other."
