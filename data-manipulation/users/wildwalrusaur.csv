This is just the opening salvo.  Both of them are going to get swiftboated like noone has ever seen before from now until Innauguration day.

For the first time in my lifetime,  corporate america sees a politician who can't be bought or diverted  with a real shot at winning the white house.   They're going to fight like a cornered animal to pit us against each other"

They're terrified of what either one of them winning represents for the future.  Once all the ""centrists"" are gone, what they do to Sanders/Warren is going to make the smear campaign against Hillary look quaint."
