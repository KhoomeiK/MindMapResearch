There would be massive piles of sand or rocks, and we just used to fuck around there for fun. To think we were all lucky to never have any serious injuries happen. So so naive of the dangers, makes me cringe a little."

PublicFreakout,fchvy3h,t1_fchowdv,1577654771.0,"I genuinely appreciate you getting back to me for a discussion and am not trying to troll you or “win an argument”. I don’t even care about this particular case, just want to know for similar situations in the future.

I think there are sources in this comment section which show/clarify that the first drink the girl was drinking(and which was on display) was a non alcoholic drink.

In such a case, would the police have the right to search further? Like they have been shown that the drink is not alcoholic. 

Also for this particular case I would like to clarify that I think the girl did handle it poorly, but also that the officers could have definitely handled it better. Both parties were in the wrong but the officers were definitely out of line for being extremely aggressive and also if they muddled the probability for a search to continued to search or to “get something” on the girl after the initial drink on display was confirmed to be non alcoholic and the breathalyser showing negative for alcohol consumption."
