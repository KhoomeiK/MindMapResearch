I was indoctrinated at the age of five. During that time, I was told to give a speech on how I will try to live according to the bible, despite not knowing what it entails.
After this ordeal, many questions brought on by genuine scientific curiosity were shot down with ""because god made it that way"". 
For a time, I actually believed in a thought police so to speak, and when it came time for them to take away some games I adored (several installments of spyro the dragon), i was convinced for about three years or so that liking dragons made one satanic and I dare not even think of them. Additionally, I was so scared of every mistake, thinking the smallest misstep would send me straight to a fiery eternity.
The presence of Christianity in my life had also exposed me to backward, scientifically inaccurate ways of thinking, and I was conditioned like an animal to respond to certain topics in a specific manner (and never given an outside perspective on anything.). Because of this conditioning, in high school I was extremely homophobic, and I didn't believe the existence of climate change and evolution.
To top it all off, my attempt to prove I was not gay ended up with me becoming infatuated and then trapped in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship that my parents turned a blind eye to, despite my rising suicidal thoughts. 
I'm lucky to be alive, but they still have the audacity to tell me to forgive my abuser.
So yeah. There you have it. I could give you a version where no gritty details are spared, but I have to sleep.
TL;DR: Growing up in a Christian household stifled my scientific curiosity, is comorbid with acceptance of conservative and bigoted beliefs, and only proved to worsen the anxiety I was born with."
