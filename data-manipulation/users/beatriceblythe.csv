Served my mission with honor (and a minor nervous breakdown) , etc, but found out later that I had an undiagnosed anxiety disorder with severe perfectionist tendencies and depression. The church checklist, while important, was wearing me out. It wasn't that I didn't have a testimony, but I needed other help with my mental health. That was more than 20 years ago and my pursuit of balance and self- care continues. I'm still active in the church, but sometimes I still have to take a step back and stop trying so hard. Sometimes it's ok to just be. You, a child of God, imperfect, and doing what you can, imperfectly. I hope you find some peace."

I don't think it's worth what I paid, honestly, but it's doing the job so I kept it.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJP5NQW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_DZHeEbQPHFQNR


The bottom compartment isn't great for pens, but I've found it works great for washi tape, so that's what I'm storing there now. 


I've decided in my favorite pens, after trying quite a few. For everyday: pentel RSVP Super RT Fine (the clicky one, not the capped one). It doesn't ghost, it's smooth, and super precise and fine. Love it. I also love the capped version, but clicky is just easier. They both come in at least 8 colors. 

For lots of great colors and a bright, clear line, I love the Papermate InkJoy 100 1.0. (Far right compartment). This could be an everyday pen, too, though it's not quite as smooth as the pentel.

For fine felt tip and MORE COLORS (for headings, drawing, borders, whatever) I use the PaperMate Flair! Medium tip. (Second to left compartment.) These ghost a bit but not bad at all. I love the colors I have in these. 

I'm practicing brush lettering (I'm still very bad at it) and I was using fancy tombow pens, but some bujo article I read mentioned these Crayola Super Tips markers for basic lettering. They are great for brush lettering and also don't bleed or ghost much. The pack I got for $5.99 has some great muted light colors that work great as highlighters. (Far left compartment.)

In the cup are my zebra highlighters. I love the colors, but they ghost a LOT, so I'm really careful with them. 

I have a few fancy tombow and Pitt artist pens, but they ghost like crazy, so I find that I don't use them in my journal. I've used them in my lettering practice though and they're fabulous, of course."

The relief i felt was unbelievable, so I took a break from the long list of things i thought i had to sp to be obedient. Served my mission with honor (and a minor nervous breakdown) , etc, but found out later that I had an undiagnosed anxiety disorder with severe perfectionist tendencies and depression. The church checklist, while important, was wearing me out. It wasn't that I didn't have a testimony, but I needed other help with my mental health. That was more than 20 years ago and my pursuit of balance and self- care continues. I'm still active in the church, but sometimes I still have to take a step back and stop trying so hard. Sometimes it's ok to just be. You, a child of God, imperfect, and doing what you can, imperfectly. I hope you find some peace."

I don't think it's worth what I paid, honestly, but it's doing the job so I kept it.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJP5NQW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_DZHeEbQPHFQNR


The bottom compartment isn't great for pens, but I've found it works great for washi tape, so that's what I'm storing there now. 


I've decided in my favorite pens, after trying quite a few. For everyday: pentel RSVP Super RT Fine (the clicky one, not the capped one). It doesn't ghost, it's smooth, and super precise and fine. Love it. I also love the capped version, but clicky is just easier. They both come in at least 8 colors. 

For lots of great colors and a bright, clear line, I love the Papermate InkJoy 100 1.0. (Far right compartment). This could be an everyday pen, too, though it's not quite as smooth as the pentel.

For fine felt tip and MORE COLORS (for headings, drawing, borders, whatever) I use the PaperMate Flair! Medium tip. (Second to left compartment.) These ghost a bit but not bad at all. I love the colors I have in these. 

I'm practicing brush lettering (I'm still very bad at it) and I was using fancy tombow pens, but some bujo article I read mentioned these Crayola Super Tips markers for basic lettering. They are great for brush lettering and also don't bleed or ghost much. The pack I got for $5.99 has some great muted light colors that work great as highlighters. (Far left compartment.)

In the cup are my zebra highlighters. I love the colors, but they ghost a LOT, so I'm really careful with them. 

I have a few fancy tombow and Pitt artist pens, but they ghost like crazy, so I find that I don't use them in my journal. I've used them in my lettering practice though and they're fabulous, of course."
