Sometimes you have to suck it up and be a grown-up. I got laid off once years ago because of the company got bought out. Although I was very upset I didn't let it show.  I was nice to everyone on my last day.
 I ran into my old manager last year, he's at a new company now and told me to give him a call if I wanted to come to work at his new place. 

Sometimes people get let go because business is slowing down and when things pick up they get offered their jobs back.

This guy didn't wait to find out if he was being let go for job performance or because things were slow so he guaranteed that he wouldn't be brought back.
