morbidquestions,ffhgj7q,t3_etgsjm,1579934274.0,"I don't have much of an argument if they are the same age, but a parent with an (adult now) child can't be ok. Someone who is an adult raising a child and then dating them sounds like it would likely involve grooming. Though I guess that may be a false assumption. It's not like there is much research done on these kinds of things. 

It would also put a strain on familial relations you couldn't get back if the relationship didn't work out. Which was what was argued in the cmv I read, but that would moreso make it not advisable rather than morally wrong. In the same way dating a close friend could harm your relationship with them, but to a more extreme extent. 

Overall, I'd say the situation and mindset people are in to feel the need to date someone in their family is questionable. And it isn't really advisable. But there isn't anything wrong with it by itself."
