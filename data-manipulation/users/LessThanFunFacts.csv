gaming,ff9r8ui,t1_ff9n8qb,1579719324.0,"Doubtful. More likely if the ESRB starts rating games with loot boxes appropriately, loot boxes will go away from most games, and then publishers will eventually come up with something else.

But if the government has to step in to regulate gambling in video games (because the ESRB refuses to), it will have a really broad impact because a lot of gambling-for-kids has flown under the radar for a long time. Trading card game booster packs, vending machines that give you a random sticker out of a set, ""collectible toy"" franchises that sell you an opaque box containing a mystery toy, those boxes of pre-painted pathfinder miniatures that contain a random assortment of minis, etc--all that stuff is the same as a loot box, and you wouldn't be allowed to market or sell that stuff to kids. 

Personally, I'm on the fence about whether that would be a good thing. I think it's pretty nasty to exploit the fact that children are children to get their parents' money, so I wouldn't feel even a little bit bad for companies that fail because that's all they do. But we already have really, really weird laws about gambling in general, so it's *possible* that stuff like trading card booster packs could end up banned for everyone and not just kids. I don't like gambling, but I don't think it's the government's place to ban adults from gambling (it is, of course, the government's *obligation* to inform people about the potential for addiction and what resources are available to help people addicted to gambling (and to provide such resources))."

Your gumball analogy doesn't really apply since (1) gumballs are all identical and (2) even if they vary in color, literally nobody has ever put a second quarter in a gumball machine just to get a different color of gum.

So it's a lot more like playing slots. You want a particular arrangement of symbols, but it's random each time, so you have to keep playing to (try to) eventually get the arrangement you want.
