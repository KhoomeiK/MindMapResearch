PoliticalHumor,fcuzkix,t1_fcuxc1j,1577991646.0,"The richest people are paying personal income tax on the profits they reap from their business, just as you reap the profits from what your hardware store makes.  

>  Pretty sure I lost some money in the 1990's too maybe I should hire an accountant to tell that to the IRS so they stop taking money from me twice a month.

Well, it's too late to do that now, for losses in the 1990's, but you absolutely can do that if you lost money last year, for example.  Did you invest in something that lost value?  Sell the asset that lost value and you can deduct that loss from your income, and thus pay a reduced or no tax this year.  Absolutely talk to your accountant about that.  

Whether it's Amazon, or your hardware store, the concept is exactly the same.  You can reinvest the profits in your business vs. paying yourself, and you and your business save money on taxes.  You can not expand and let your business show profits, which the business will pay taxes on. 

Or, you can not expand, show a profit, the business pays tax on the profit, and then when it distributes those profits to you the owner, or you the stockholder, you pay tax on the profit you receive that the government has already taxed once already.  

Ex.:  Your hardware store generates $ 100 in profit.  The store pays $ 15 of federal income tax on that $ 100.  It then distributes the remaining $ 85 of profit to you, the owner or shareholder.  You pay tax on the $ 85.  Let's say your tax rate, just for grins, is 20%.  You pay $ 17 in tax on your $ 85.  So Uncle Sam has collected 32% on the $ 100 the hardware store actually earned.  Not bad, huh?  

And here's the thing.....growing businesses, even those that don't show a profit due to expansion, STILL generate more taxes in total than a business that just takes the profit, like our example above.  

I know it sounds good to say, ""that big business didn't pay any income tax.""  It resulted in a shitload of income taxes and property taxes being paid anyway.  It's like a leaky Coke can with multiple holes, with a pan underneath to catch the liquid that escapes.  That pan is the federal, state, and local government.  It doesn't matter which hole leaks the most Coke, the government eventually gets it all."
PoliticalHumor,fcuvls7,t1_fcuuedi,1577989450.0,"If you run a business, and reinvest all your profits in expanding your business, then you don't show a profit and thus, pay no federal income tax.    You do, however, pay more money in property tax, as your business acquires more land, more  buildings, more equipment, etc.  Did you add employees in your expansion?  Those employees all pay federal income tax on their income.  

Whether a business shows any profit or not, it's still paying local property tax to pay for schools, roads, fire and police, libraries, roads, bridges, courts, etc.  It's still paying employees that pay all manner of federal, state, and local taxes.  

So here's the deal.....do you want a business to NOT expand, and thus not pay more local property tax, in favor of paying federal income tax on more profit, or would you prefer more expansion of the business, and more local tax dollars vs. federal dollars?  

Does any business have the right to make that decision for themselves?  Let's say you own a hardware store.  You can either pay income tax on the profits, or you can invest that money and build an addition to expand your store's square footage and inventory, which will generate more taxes that will be used specifically for YOUR community.  Should you be able to make that decision yourself, or should government decide for you?"
