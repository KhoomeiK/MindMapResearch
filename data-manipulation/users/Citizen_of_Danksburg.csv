I knew there was a leak a while ago long before the movie’s release that was like, supposed to be literally 100% accurate or something, but I haven’t heard that reddit collectively wrote TROS"

AskReddit,ffdrikr,t1_ffc0vjm,1579827153.0,Bro. I got a crazy undergrad degree in math and this was me too. Correcting the procrastination part now but I still love math. In a stats grad program though so fuck. That’s what insecurity will get you.
worldnews,ffcmo1i,t1_ffbvzw7,1579802704.0,Amazing how simple it can be to just take advantage of people’s stupidity. Sad really.
interestingasfuck,ffam56r,t1_ff9u51y,1579739181.0,"Yeah. Ha, the colors seem like they’re the exact colors of the infinity stones from the MCU. It’s as if each section of the rock contains an infinity stone that is the color of that section. Looks like at the very tippy top or on the back is a red part?"

Edit: Jesus. Downvoted for asking an innocent question. Nice, reddit. Instead of downvoting me why don’t you be helpful and  actually provide an answer so others like myself can be informed. Why punish people for asking an innocent question? I shouldn’t even have to fucking mention that I believe in climate change like any sensible human but I guess I do. Of fucking course I believe that climate change is happening and I think it’s great Greta is doing what she is doing. I just haven’t heard of this happening. I’d think the scientific community would welcome someone like her—in fact they probably do and if this is actually happening that it’s only a few randos out there. Wasn’t she on the cover of Times magazine for her efforts?"
CatsOnKeyboards,ff3to18,t3_eo1h6p,1579548613.0,"It’s funny how little baby mammals do that. At home I have two adorable little puppies Barley and Leo (well, they’re a little over 2 now so not quite puppies but in my heart they still are). We got Barley just about 2 months after we got Leo, and so by the time we brought our little Barley home, Leo had already established a liking to being on top of a particular couch cushion. So once Barley saw Leo doing this she too decided she would join in on the cause and jump up on top of the couch cushion. So now we have two dogs that like to be on top of the couch cushion all because Barley saw Leo do it once and decided “hey, I want to do that too!”"
