A lot of Gandalf's power is implied in the movies (Maiar, his upgrade to White, etc), he really only has one huge on-screen feat and that's having a slugfest with the Balrog, who itself is just a big scary brawler in the movie.

So if we go off feats, Yennefer can do a lot more than movie Gandalf can. She's got a lot more offensive and ranged capability, she takes it pretty easily."
