TrueOffMyChest,fff3m1h,t1_ffeyu2e,1579874801.0,Lol right. Better luck next time!
TrueOffMyChest,ffeyrnz,t1_ffen6oo,1579870687.0,"Well considering this was so bad you deleted the post and your comments, I figure by now it's pretty obvious how well you succeeded in your own, lol."
TrueOffMyChest,ffen3zo,t1_ffemqoy,1579855352.0,"Wasn't trying to provoke. Again, delusional. Doesn't change my original statement. It's sad you're so angry that you lash out at e everyone. Not ALL first world people feel or act that way, but clearly by your post and continued skewed retorts, you're just here to stomp your feet and pick fights. 

Newsflash: Posting an assumption of an entire race of people are going to be oh so mad about your post is attempting to provoke. Your continual lashing out shows your fragile ego. Good luck bro. Seriously though, this much hate isn't good. Get help."
TrueOffMyChest,ffemp2c,t1_ffelrd6,1579854756.0,"You need help bro. It's not healthy to be so angry and delusional. Imagine being this crazy over someone pointing out where you could have improved your case, lol."
TrueOffMyChest,ffelokp,t3_et542f,1579853370.0,You had me until you started crying about how this was going to offend white people. If you're going to bitch about ignorance you probably should leave your own out of the opening statement. You just sound like a hypocritical crybaby.
TrueOffMyChest,ffel0wl,t3_et5nm4,1579852508.0,"Next month will be 3 years for me. You get ""used"" to it I guess but it doesn't get better, imo. I feel like a lot of it is having to suddenly and forcefully redirect my thoughts before crying at anything and everything. I dont even remember the first year. -hug- Its never how you assume it will be. You cant really prepare for it until it happens no matter how you try. 

I used to think the world would end for me but I'm still here. Its ... different. You'll be on autopilot a lot. But it's okay. Be kind to yourself and know it will take a long time and that's okay too. <3"

No thanks. I'd rather be able to rest peacefully."
wow,ff68uer,t3_erwa3f,1579621853.0,"Look, I'm the first person to scrutinize Blizz...but this is reaching."

NoahGetTheBoat,ff1lz8x,t1_ff12nq4,1579481372.0,Came here for this
wow,fex7aim,t1_fex5ovo,1579425878.0,"Yeah, this is pretty much exactly what I said. So...."
wow,fevupps,t1_fevjtt7,1579401755.0,THANK YOU. I have no idea why this is so hard for some people to understand other than resorting to assuming they are diehard fanboys who have never worked a real job in their lives (for any significant time) to support Blizzard on this.... it's not hard to understand or fathom that Blizzard actually might be a shit company sonetimes.
wow,fev669x,t3_eqoqo7,1579393508.0,"It does suck and it is infuriating, but people are assholes, they dont care about you and it's not going to change. You're just a pixel on a screen and another tick on a quest or achieve, you arent a real person and people dont care when it doesn't effect them. You'll just have to turn off WM like a lot of other people lately. It's a basic rule of the internet, people are mostly assholes when they have a screen between them and anyone else without having to worry about basic common decency or courtesy."
wow,feuyzjb,t1_feux7oz,1579391347.0,"Except no. That's not how it works all the time, sometimes that's not even an answer you get and I'm pretty sure some random stranger isn't about to tell me what I do and dont need, lol. Imagine being so pompous and full of yourself that you tell strangers what they need and dont need and assume any reason they would want to talk to a higher level of support is just to get your way."
wow,feunfub,t1_feumzlv,1579388233.0,Not true from my experience or other people I know. Wanting a legit explanation or asking questions isn't arguing either.
NoahGetTheBoat,feumuh3,t1_feuj7sw,1579388009.0,But.... it's pretty common knowledge that they can climb. Even living in the desert you hear how they climb trees and telephone poles and shit...
NoahGetTheBoat,feuj4t2,t3_eqna5u,1579386993.0,Yes a scared bear trying to get off the road is totally worthy of this sub....
wow,feuit0m,t3_eqneq1,1579386886.0,"I like how Blizzards response is usually to threaten people after fucking them over. ""Shut the fuck up before we ban you for questioning why the shit you pay for is constantly broken."""
wow,feue9ed,t3_eqn2ab,1579385682.0,"Because a lot of times they have been carried successfully and are clueless to what's really going on or that they are the problem. And if they fail? So what, it wasn't important to them or wasn't their key. Just like people that join bgs with no intent or idea on what the objective is. It's part of the casual player condition and having 0 self awareness or taking self responsibility. These are the same people that have no idea there is literally an in game guide with all the fights and info for the bare basics."
wow,feu1aan,t3_eqij57,1579382134.0,"Awe, it looks like you have a cute little quail feather on your head <3"
wow,feu0ulq,t1_fepuqzb,1579382029.0,Thanks for posting that! How long does the overall bodypaint usually last? Are there ways to get them to last longer? Or certain types? I don't cosplay but I've always wondered.
