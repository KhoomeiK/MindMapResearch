insaneparents,ffuna73,t1_fft0hmm,1580245549.0,Religion. Religion is how people like this exist.
insaneparents,ffun8w0,t3_ev2s0a,1580245528.0,"Pretty standard, actually. Education leads to atheism. Religious people often frown on it and avoid it. Not only in their women, but in their men as well."
IdiotsInCars,ffumut6,t1_ffumoyz,1580245301.0,"Eh, I wouldn’t attack someone for slagging off though, free speech and all that. He didn’t get physical until they nearly hit him, and now that you tell me that I wonder if they weren’t aiming for him the first time as well as the second. So yeah, definitely idiots all around in this situation."
IdiotsInCars,ffulff4,t1_fful760,1580244434.0,"That is true. I wouldn’t have reversed and gone back for more after I was free and clear, I’d have just gotten out of there. Also, watching the video again, I don’t think the guy was with the lady like I originally thought he was. It looks like he was just a bystander until, when the driver tried to shake off the lady, he jumped the curb and almost hit that guy - after which that guy jumped in and started trying to stop them/pull them out of the car. 

So I actually recant my previous statement, the driver definitely did several idiotic things here."
AskReddit,ffukpz7,t3_ev5zdg,1580244006.0,"2007, after losing two close friends to an IED. 

Yes, that long. Since then I’ve been divorced, lost family members, even lost more war buddies to things like suicide. Nothing. I haven’t cried in 13 years. I’m not sure I can still feel anything deeply enough to bring me to tears."
IdiotsInCars,ffujj3v,t1_ffuhv37,1580243287.0,"Probably because if someone assaulted me or smashed up my property, I would deliberately cause them great damage. So I sort of sympathize with the guy. If people started bashing on my car and trying to open the doors while I was in it, I can’t say I wouldn’t have done exactly the same thing. 

I could assume the guy in the car must have done something to provoke them, of course, but the video doesn’t show that part, so all I know for certain is that the lady was trying to smash the windshield and the big dude was trying to get into the car, presumably with equally violent intentions, and the driver shook them off and ran the guy down. Seems like self defense to me."

So I think most men will likely find it attractive - though if course they might be overly cautious if you look young enough to be underage. Still, that should only be temporary., and if this trend continues then you’ll look in your 20’s when you’re in your 30’s and so forth. So overall I think it’s probably going to be a good thing."

I would assume then that any artist who portrays her would style her according to what the artist would consider to be a stunningly beautiful woman. 

I wonder if Gentileschi portrayed her as such, and that’s a reflection of what she would consider stunningly beautiful? Or if she intentionally portrayed her as being more plain/common to make a statement about the superficiality of beauty?

BeAmazed,ffntkl3,t1_ffnsr0o,1580070626.0,"I’ve personally never trained a diabetic service dog, I train service dogs for disabled veterans with PTSD like myself. My dogs do things like what you see in the video here, as well as wake their handler from nightmares, post behind their handler to keep people from approaching from behind or from other blindspots within an arms distance to avoid startling them, and also snap their handlers out of flashbacks by doing things to regain their attention when they “space out,” from simply licking or nipping their hand to, if necessary, barking and standing up right in their face (if they’re big enough). 

That said, from what I understand, what you do is get a swab of the inside of your cheek with a bit of cotton while your blood sugar is high or low, and then you can use that to train them to respond to the scent."
MurderedByWords,ffnsw2y,t3_eu8h5b,1580070352.0,"Also, the proverb he tried to use at the end, in its original form is “You can’t see the forest *FOR* the trees.” The word “for” here meaning “because of.” 

It’s not just the wording he got wrong either, it’s the intent. “You can’t see the forest for the trees” means you’re too close to something to see the bigger picture. You can’t see the totality because you’re too focused on trivial details. It has absolutely nothing to do with the context he’s using - in fact, since he’s arguing pedantic grammatical trivialities when the greater purpose of language is simply to convey thoughts and ideas in a way that will be understood, it’s actually him that could be said to be failing to see the forest for the trees."

And of course it goes without saying that they need to get cranking on Horizon: Zero Dawn 2. We all know it’s coming, and PS5 is the ideal platform. It ought to be a launch title, IMO, but if they’re not already nearly done with it then it’s probably too late to make it in time."

BeAmazed,ffm0t97,t1_ffksfs3,1580046746.0,"It’s not as complicated as you think. When most people think about getting a service dog, they think about service dog training organizations, which can be very expensive. 

However, the ADA purposefully does not require service dogs to be certified, registered, or accredited in any specific way. They don’t need to come from or go through any particular program, and they don’t need to pass any particular test. The ADA defines service dogs by what they’re trained to do, NOT by who trained them or how they were trained. 

This means that *literally any dog trainer* can train a service dog. In fact, you can even train your own service dog. A service dog must:

1) Be trained to perform at least one task that specifically assists with or mitigates a disability. ESA’s are not service dogs because emotional support is not a trained task, it’s something the animal provides by just being there and being an animal - but what the dog is doing in this video is above and beyond emotional support. It’s literally intervening and preventing her from harming/striking herself. That would be accepted under the ADA as a service dog task. 

2) Be well behaved and non-disruptive in public. If it misbehaves in public and you fail to immediately get it under control, The business may lawfully ask you to remove the animal from the premises. It’s legally protected status under the ADA will be forfeit. [Train it to meet these standards.](https://www.iaadp.org/iaadp-minimum-training-standards-for-public-access.html) As I said, the ADA does not require the animal to pass any tests to qualify, however, since the ADA allows businesses to deny access to animals that display disruptive behaviors, I use these guidelines as a benchmark the animal should be able to meet to avoid that outcome. 

So long as the dog meets these two requirements, the law doesn’t care who trained them to do so or how. If they meet these requirements then they are considered a service dog by law and have legally protected public access under the ADA. So if you’re worried about costs and think you can’t afford a service dog, don’t despair. Professional organizations can be pricey, and though their dogs are very impressively trained, service dogs don’t *have* to come from those places. You can train your own if you know how, or ordinary dog trainers could help you for probably much less than service dog organizations charge, and as long as the dog meets those two requirements when it’s training is finished, it’s legally, officially, legitimately a service dog."
BeAmazed,ffjzq4m,t3_etzi8z,1580011427.0,"This is a good example of a genuine service dog as opposed to an emotional support animal. That’s a conditioned response, something the dog is trained to do to help with her panic attacks, whereas an ESA just provides comfort by being there and being a dog. ESA’s do not qualify as service animals under the ADA, but what you’re seeing in this video is above and beyond mere emotional support. That’s a service dog task."
BeAmazed,ffjzf09,t1_ffjqu2f,1580011183.0,"I train service dogs. 

They can literally smell any change in your body, even emotional ones, because those changes always inevitably involve various chemical changes happening in your body. Dogs can smell the change, in your breath and in your skin. It’s how diabetic service dogs know when someone’s blood sugar is too high or too low, and it’s how anxiety service dogs can know when a panic attack is building. Its a simple matter of training the dog to respond to the scent. 

That said, this poor lady gives some very obvious physical signs as well, so you can also just train the dog to respond to those and it will learn the scent itself over time as it gains experience reacting to the real thing. Most dogs will then naturally begin to respond when they smell it, even if the physical signs have yet to begin."

Just because you have the clearance doesn’t mean you can access the info. You have to be “read in” and you’ll only be read in if you have need to know. So it’s not like having a TS/SCI clearance just gives you all all-access pass to all the really juicy national secrets. I only know a few cool top secret things, everything else is publicly available."
