australia,ffe3w8x,t3_et3p0c,1579836027.0,"Lucky bay in Esperance, WA I disagree with it being a nice beach. It was covered with weed when I was there, definitely a instagram vs reality thing going on there. Twilight Beach in Esperance was way better. 

Cable Beach in Broome, WA I also disagree with. Littered with people, cars and smells of camel. Another Instagram vs reality thing going on there. 

The beaches in Exmouth, WA particularly within Cape Range National Park are pristine, with excellent snorkelling. 

There are beaches within Innes National Park on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia, these are also pristine, some with rock pools you can swim in which is just lush. 

Plenty of beaches in Tasmania, too many to name. Wineglass bay, Swansea, Bicheno, Bay of Fires - to name a few. The East Coast of Tasmania in particular, pick a spot, any spot! 

In the Denmark, Margaret River, Dunsborough and Yallingup area of Western Australia - beautiful pristine coastline full of beaches and turquoise waters."

offmychest,ff2vatg,t3_ercjnm,1579525546.0,"Hey! 
It’s hard. It’s really hard, but you need to put yourself first! 
Having children really shows you who really is there for you, and sometimes it can be the most loneliest time when you realise that all you have is yourself! Sometimes you need to cut these people loose, and that’s the hard part, but the most important part to seeing your value and getting what you deserve. 

I’ve got two kids. I have no friends, because I made the realisation that the friendships were all one way with me putting in the effort and them just taking with no return. I feel sad about it sometimes, but then I realise the bullshit I had to deal with with those ‘friends’ and I know I’m better off without the heartache and pain. 

As for the dad of your baby, same as above, know your worth! You’ve said it yourself, you’re doing it on your own, so give him the flick and show him that you don’t need him. 

A quote I quite like that seems fitting - “I know what I bring to the table so trust me when I say I’m not afraid to eat alone.”"

With my second pregnancy I was accused of starving myself because I wasn’t putting on sufficient weight, yet I was eating more than my husband! I’m just a small, petite woman that grows small, petite babies."
facepalm,fduqyj1,t1_fdsjdfw,1578737613.0,"Some women just don’t get that instinct. I mean I did for one of my pregnancies, I just knew. But with my very first pregnancy I thought my period was coming, but then it didn’t come. And then there’s me and hubby both taking pee tests (coz he thought he’d be funny and take the stress out of it) and his test came up positive and mine negative - we’d got the tests mixed up - but there we were reading about how a positive pregnancy test in a male could be testicular cancer. Turns out no cancer for him but I was pregnant! 

But I did know a girl who found out at 8 months and looking at her you’d never know. We were pregnant together and chatted extensively once she found out. She just had absolutely no reason to believe she was pregnant, she didn’t look pregnant, but there she was - pregnant!"
facepalm,fduqdus,t1_fdsjwpg,1578737335.0,It’s not about stupidity. Some women don’t get morning sickness. Some women still bleed during pregnancy (thus believing it’s their period). Some babies sit in weird positions in the womb which basically means they go undetected. The placenta can cushion baby’s movements meaning mum can’t feel it moving. Some women’s periods are irregular so they don’t think anything of their lack of period.
facepalm,fduq04w,t1_fdsnrp6,1578737093.0,Not really. Plenty of skinny women have had unnoticed pregnancies. I didnt start showing until I was well into my third trimester with my first baby.
facepalm,fdupvjb,t1_fdsnyqr,1578737013.0,"Some women get bleeding through pregnancy, and if you didnt know you were pregnant you would assume it was your period. 
Some women have irregular cycles, so it wouldn’t really be unusual to skip a few periods. 
Some women are on medication that affect their cycles, so again it might not be unusual to not get a period for them."
