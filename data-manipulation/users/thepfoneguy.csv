You're not going to change your mind obviously and that's okay, but you can't seriously claim that transphobia is a made up word and transgenderism isn't real haha.

 It took a few weeks of pulling my head our of my ass to realize I was blaming a group of people that was so small it was insignificant. You're obviously not going to change your mind, LGBTQ discourse is something very hard to talk people out of, but I truly hope you let go of your rage towards these people and focus on healing yourself and making your life better."
