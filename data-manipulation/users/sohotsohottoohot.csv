But in a more dramatized alternate universe, I would've given him a call, telling him about how his whole house is surrounded, and show him how our snipers are already locking his family members' heads as target. He'll be forced to go through with his holiday meal, feeling every second as torturous yet as priceless as it could be as it might as well be his last time with his innocent family.

The ending scenario is optional; we arrest him for the rest of his life once the meal is over outside of his home, or shoot him dead once the meal is over right there in front of granny Smith, mom Wendy and little brother Donald.

Merry Christmas, sucka"

The time I put on it. The sleepless night is all worth it when I get to publish the epilogue on the internet for my fellow fanfic readers. It has been more than half a decade ago since then, I still look back and feel proud of my creation. Flaws and all.

Edit: I would've bragged about it to my friends irl, if only it is not too cheesy, is not a LOTR fanfiction regarding a certain elf, and contains a lot of cheesy pop culture reference. 

Still proud as hell about it online tho
