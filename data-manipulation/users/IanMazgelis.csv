In all seriousness this is a surprise to me. I was under the impression that bats had been identified as the vector and bat soup as the most likely delivery method. Was that simply incorrect speculation, or could there be more than one vector or intermediate species for this virus?

Regardless, this is concerning because even if somehow every single person in China is cured, if the virus finds a comfortable intermediate it could return on a regular basis when that intermediate transmits it to humans in the area. My memory of ecology is shoddy, but I believe this is termed as a *natural reservoir,* and there's very few realistic ways to handle it besides inoculating everyone, which I feel would be the ideal solution given a proper vaccine, or killing all of the members of that reservoir species- which may not even work if there's more than one.

It's a shame that news about the virus simply hasn't gotten any better over time, but at the very least we're learning more about it which is extremely important if we want to handle it in an effective way. That's why, more than anything, I'm extremely frustrated with China's secrecy over something that could very well be a global concern. It is profoundly irresponsible and harmful of them to conduct themselves in this way."

There are obviously exceptions to this and not everything is up for debate, climate change being my go to example of when people treat facts as a matter of opinion.

But not everything is based around fact or even heavily influenced by it. Brexit was a question of whether or not the United Kingdom should be in the European Union, and I don't think that's as clear cut as you're making out to be. There are issues involved in that question where one could be 'wrong' as this post described, for instance- and I myself may be misinformed on this matter- I believe one of the key arguments was that the European Union controlled the United Kingdom's immigration policies when in reality this was not true and the United Kingdom controlled them the entire time.

But a lot of it does just come down to personal feelings. For some they might say it's simply wrong that people who don't live in the United Kingdom affect policy in that country, and you really can't tell someone they're incorrect to feel that way even if you don't agree with them, just the same as they couldn't really tell you you're incorrect for feeling it makes sense for European Union policy to apply to the United Kingdom.

Most genetic disorders that are more prevalent in men often occur because of the lack of a second X chromosome to correct for the mistakes of the other.

For instance, let's say the X chromosome makes a protein that tells your appendages to grow fingernails (It doesn't, roll with me on this.) Let's say one mother's egg mutates on its X chromosome, and that protein is no longer being produced by the mutated X chromosome. If that mutated egg gets impregnated by a sperm cell with an X chromosome and produces a girl, odds are, her fingernails would be fine or close to it since girls have two X chromosomes, and dad's X chromosome is gonna be telling the appendages to make those fingernails. But if that egg gets impregnated by a sperm cell with a Y chromosome and produces a boy, well there's no second X chromosome to pick up the slack of mom's X Chromosome not producing fingernails, so let's hope the boy never gets a thing for nail polish because he'd be right and proper fucked."

There was one mildly playful scene with the leaf, but other than that they really didn't get along at all. The only really friendly moment between Luke and Rey was in Rise of Skywalker where he apologized for his existence in the last movie. I don't think that's enough to justify her name change."

pokemon,ff91ug6,t1_ff8s1fq,1579702752.0,"The theme of the movie was ""Never be afraid of who you are."" But then Rey completely ignores that and pretends she's somebody else. Yes, I get it, it's a very nice message for adopted kids, one we've seen in hundreds of other movies, but it's also contradictory for the movie's alleged theme for anyone that actually watched it. We end up with a character in denial about her lineage who feels more comfortable taking the name of two people she seems to have only spent a number of weeks with.

It was just laziness and a lack of forethought. I do not understand why someone would defend this scene, it's just terrible. I like this movie more than most people I see online, but God damn was this scene stupid as hell.

Edit: And God damn the Skywalkers did not adopt Rey. That is so God damn stupid that I'm angry at myself for even suggesting it's an acceptable excuse. If we're going by that metric she should have said ""Rey Chewbacca"" since she spent more time with him than Luke, Han, or Leia put together."

I almost respect Lucas even more for trying to keep that twist going for an entire movie, but it just didn't come together in the end unfortunately.

I would honestly be completely shocked if George Lucas came out and said Jar Jar wasn't planned to be a force user. The one that gives it away in my mind, and unfortunately I don't have a video but anyone with access to the movie can check, is when Qui Gon Jinn doesn't want to take Padme into the town on Tatooine, and around 30:35, Jar Jar mouths the exact words from the security guard that convince Qui Gon to take her. He does this once or twice more. He's a computer animated character and this would have taken time, it had to be a specific instruction.

He's also aware of the force which goes back and forth between being common in Star Wars. The exact line is ""Maxi big da force."" Take of that what you will. Qui Gon also mentions sensing a disturbance in the force before Darth Maul even begins going to Tatooine. It just all adds up so fast that it almost feels obvious even though it's completely ridiculous when you first hear it. And really, isn't that a great method to make an amazing twist?"

StarWars,fepytou,t1_fepw4t3,1579334897.0,"If we look at it in a pure vacuum, with only Empire and Hope existing, I could see myself, if I were alive at the time, interpreting that ""other"" hope being Anakin redeeming himself and killing the emperor.

>Luke. You can destroy The Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny. Join me, and together we can rule the Galaxy as father and son.

The character of Darth Vader in Empire was definitely written to be one that would betray The Emperor, and God knows what he would do then. But I could imagine that Yoda might have sensed that hatred for the Emperor within Vader and seen a conflict within Anakin, being that 'other' hope he had described.

As for the mention of Leia turning to the dark side setting off Luke, I agree that they did at least bring up the big reveal at another point in the movie, but I really think there are dozens of better ways they could have handled the emotional potence of the throne room confrontation in general. It always bothered me that Luke quickly regained his composure after trying to kill The Emperor when the duel began."
StarWars,fepvuvv,t1_fepntcj,1579333162.0,"That movie came out fourteen years before I was born and in 2020 I still think them being twins is a stupid and lazy twist they used to wrap up the romantic conflict between Luke, Leia, and Han. I do not see what it adds to the story of the movie itself without considering a bunch of expanded universe and sequel stuff.

I would really, honestly like someone to explain to me what the movie gains from them being related at all. The father son twist in Empire Strikes Back was the backbone of the entire film- Darth Vader is on a mad dash to find his son at any cost, even trashing Star Destroyers, murdering his own men, and going rogue with bounty hunters to reach that end. Obi-Wan and Yoda are scared to hell and back that Luke is going to turn out just like his father but can't tell him that out of fear of accelerating their worst fear. It all ties together neatly into one line that pulled an already fun movie into a masterpiece: ""No, I am your father.""

What the hell did Leia being Luke's sister add to the narrative of Return? It was an ""Oh, by the way"" footnote that produced more questions than answers and, in my opinion, made Vader's desperation to reconnect with his son less important. I did not like the affect it had on the movie whatsoever, and they did not make an effort to convince me of its validity. Granted, in the context of the overall series, I do think it works well, but in terms of 1983, I think it was a bad creative decision that was handled poorly and without thought of consequence."

I'm not very familiar with the series but even I could list a few characters I'd be more interested in appearing Smash than Byleth.

Personally I'm of the opinion that I don't really care about characters I'm not interested in being added to the game. I don't have to play as them, they probably weren't gonna add my choices anyway, but hey- whatever. But I do think it's very, very obnoxious to actively enjoy other people being frustrated by something even if you find the issue overall insignificant. I'd rather just be apathetic than reveling, after all there are a lot of things I get upset about that many people would find insignificant and pointless.
