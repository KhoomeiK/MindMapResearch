AskReddit,fghxv6y,t3_eyhon0,1580797348.0,"Any time you play a 6* the next person has to either play another 6* (can’t play a different card of the same color) or say “I’m too six-y for my shirt” and draw 6 times the rating you’d give them on a 1-10 hotness scale. Basically they’re almost always drawing 60 cards bc strategy. If they fail to say “I’m too six-y for my shirt,” they draw 6 to the power of the 1-10 rating instead. You’re gonna need a bigger deck for that one."
