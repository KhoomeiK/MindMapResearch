BravoRealHousewives,ffgpud4,t1_fdm7mnd,1579912011.0,"There is so many instances where Terry’s quite unethical as a doctor, using his “expertise” to comment on things. He did the same with Alexis’s nose job, he didn’t know the situation and no one asked him. 

It also annoys me how Heather thinks she knows all about medicine and especially mental health because her husband is a doctor. You don’t work together, you are not a doctor just because your husband is one!"
BravoRealHousewives,ffgpchc,t3_em0iqd,1579911662.0,This is what made me turn against Heather. Her gaslighting of Shannon and Kelly was the worst two. Once you start to see the pattern it’s eye opening watching the series over again. I can never see her the same again
BravoRealHousewives,ffgp1fd,t3_ekk5th,1579911445.0,"Season 11. 
I loved her season 9 and 10 and in season 9 I felt really sympathetic with her getting painted as crazy by Heather.
I changed my mind massively in season 11 when she tried to get Kelly drunk in Ireland.
I also didn’t like her constant hate agains Vicky. I know what Vicky did was really wrong, but Shannon took it upon herself to paint her out even worse and did everything she could to ruin her relationship with the other ladies especially Tamra. I guess she came of really self righteous to me about the whole thing.
Now I don’t like her because she seems so desperate for Tamras friendship she is like her litttle puppet."
BravoRealHousewives,ffgob46,t3_ese8mw,1579910929.0,"Until that cancer scam I always liked Vicky, she always seemed quite reasonable. Even after the cancer scam I liked her and felt oddly sympathetic towards her. Hated her in season 10 though but that was the only season.

I loved Heather until season 9, but like you said her gaslighting of Shannon was insane and I could never see her the same way after that. I’m not a big Kelly Dodd fan but I thought Heather treated her awful too. It’s like she will find someone vonurable and pick on them. I think her behaviour when Shannon came to her house says all there is to know about her, and that was such a good opportunity for her to show her compassionate side.

Tamra I haven’t liked for the longest time, she seems like a bully to me, trying to make herself look like an angel"
relationships,ffgnbcb,t3_ethy1p,1579910234.0,"I am seeing that most of these comments says you HAVE to tell him. I don’t agree that you have to.
You didn’t cheat on him, this was before you met and you have a right to keep some things to yourself, this wasn’t something you did to him or your relationship.
I would however say that since it’s on your mind now that this is a secret that weighs heavy on you and that’s a heavy burden to have in a relationship and that it’s easier to be able to to be completely open and honest and therefore you should consider telling him. 
Again this wasn’t something that you did to him, if he loves you he might be able to “forgive” it and move on and then you can have better relationship going forward. But that is a gamble that only you can know if you can roll the dice on. Whatever you decide don’t be so hard on yourself. Christianity is as much about forgiveness as it is about living “sin free”"
relationships,ffghl5c,t3_ethwlw,1579906405.0,"This happens to everyone at one point and I am sure that most of your bfs friends have been there. 
I think the sooner you meet them again the sooner you will feel better. I would just face it head on, don’t dance around it or ignore it just be like “ok guys obviously I got way to drunk last time, I’m really sorry”. If you feel up for it you could make a joke of it and say you where nervous to meet them and what they would think of you and actually drank to make a great first impression.

One think that has helped me at times when I feel I have made a fool out of my self is the saying “you are not as important as you think you are” 

the world doesn’t revolve around you and that’s a great thing, everyone is far to self involved to care for a long time. Just think that in the meantime a million things have happened in their lives that has taken their attention, I bet your night was the focus of their mind for a day before they went back to worrying about their own life.
Don’t be so hard on your self!"

I think the only good thing about depression is that it creates some dept in a person and often makes you more empathetic to others having been low yourself when you get out of it.

You are 19, you have the whole world at your feet, whatever your biggest dreams are go for it now, you have time to try and fail and get where you want in life!"
