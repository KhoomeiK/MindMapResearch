I’ve played a very long time on and off. And I consider my top 3 my mai. Toons. 2 I’ve played since Vanilla and a 3rd is usually a hero class. Was a DK in wotlk. A monk for a while and now I love my DH. I play all 3 sand I play them well. 

Anything outside of those are second tier. And like many of you I have a lot of those.

And with all these dailies and cloak quests etc it’s too much for alts. Honestly I got my cloaks to 5 and stopped. I do assaults and lessers and just stash the vessels .  I like mythic+ dungeons and pvp. Smaller scale with equal rewards. Also, I will Never raid unless they need me for something.  So I don’t need a lvl 15 cloak at all for any reason. I’ll ‘maybe’ get one to 10 if I even give a shit enough on one.
