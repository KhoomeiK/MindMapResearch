Frugal,fflu7o6,t1_ffiyblq,1580044261.0,I feel guilty going to Ace to buy screws.  I will waste 5 minutes of an employee’s time for forty cents in screws.  They are definitely less than a dollar...way less.
Games,fezd92n,t3_eqlxyg,1579456135.0,"Great.  So educate parents so they know how their kids might be wasting money.  Meanwhile, if adults want to piss their money away on loot boxes that’s their prerogative."
DippingTobacco,fesckz8,t3_eqhizn,1579363865.0,"I’m not judging here, but personally, without nicotine I don’t really see the point."

AskReddit,fercuab,t1_fer4x16,1579352410.0,"The only song of his I can recall from that era is “I Can’t Drive 55”.  Although I recall rather liking it in my rebellious youth, it wasn’t exactly awesome."
AskReddit,fdnrz8u,t1_fdnamo5,1578591639.0,Quora is actually the more likely candidate for a replacement of yahoo answers.  They at least moderate things enough that the comments section doesn’t become a complete shitstorm on controversial topics.
AskReddit,fdnrpvp,t1_fdnd0cv,1578591497.0,"I’m guessing you didn’t get the memo.  Criticizing any Trump critic in any way will get you downvotes.  Thankfully, you at least clarified that you weren’t a Trump supporter, otherwise you would have drowned in the deluge of downvotes."
todayilearned,fdel2zm,t3_ektwhg,1578341307.0,The nagging wears you down over the years...
IAmA,fdb2rcm,t1_fdb12xp,1578253116.0,Which does not give YOU cause to definitively determine guilt.
IAmA,fdazyf7,t1_fday4uh,1578252216.0,The logical assumption here is that HE BELIEVES the murderer beat the charges.
IAmA,fdazt18,t1_fdaycxx,1578252161.0,So you come to definitive conclusions about someone’s guilt based on context clues?
IAmA,fdazl20,t1_fdaxbni,1578252079.0,Do you often cone to definitive conclusions about someone being a murderer based on a single person’s opinion?
IAmA,fdaw0o3,t1_fdaf1d5,1578250981.0,"Given that the alleged murderer was not convicted in a court of law AND you do not have personal knowledge of the case (and yeah, I am making an assumption here, but it’s a pretty safe assumption), I am not sure how you can definitively conclude that the “murderer beat the charges”."
todayilearned,fd3ihl3,t3_ejwxed,1578158630.0,This research was conducted with fathers that live with their children.  I am curious how the comparative stats look when you include ALL fathers.  Divorced parents are far more of a thing in modern times.
AskReddit,fcvdx7f,t1_fcv8wom,1578000072.0,"Do they still have the bars with the signs that say (in Korean) “no foreigners allowed”?  When I lived there in the 90’s you would occasionally encounter them.  I remember being somewhat shocked at being turned away at the door, it was certainly a unique experience."
todayilearned,fctb9sc,t1_fcsig2j,1577937935.0,Politics leaks into the strangest places these days...
MagicArena,fcsp0ue,t1_fcsoecy,1577921491.0,"Meh...my irritation at seeing missed loot outweighed my enjoyment of the game.  It was that simple.  No hard feelings, there’s a shitload of other games out there."
MagicArena,fcsn4kb,t1_fcsmfin,1577920143.0,"Yeah, I didn’t earn enough gems to do that.  I never did much more than dailies, so all I earned was gold.  It did occur to me that perhaps the game was not designed around players like me.  That was fine."
MagicArena,fcsm13u,t1_fcsku0y,1577919400.0,"Perhaps.  But these things are not immediately obvious.  And complaining on reddit does nothing.  Even quitting has minimal impact unless you are a paying customer.  The biggest thing they look at is:  does revenue rise or fall after this change.  

To be fully transparent here, I stopped playing after they added that feature where you either paid gems or miss out on added loot from dailies.  I wasn’t mad at them.  I get what they were trying to do.  I just didn’t feel like giving them more money, but I found it frustrating to see all the loot I was missing out on.  So I left..."
MagicArena,fcsjuud,t1_fcs2yew,1577918016.0,"Well, I mean, most companies do exist to make money.  Is there something about that you find surprising?"
fo4,fcsj6ax,t3_eilhl2,1577917581.0,"Ya know, I’ve heard so many people fucking complain about settlements and Fallout 4 and I’ve never understood it.  Things like this are the reason I love settlements in Fallout 4.  It adds an entirely separate minigame where your creativity can run wild, and if you don’t like them, just ignore them and kill things instead."
OldSchoolCool,fcrtkvc,t1_fcrqjkt,1577906440.0,Thank you!  I’m so fucking sick of the urban legend that makes it sound like he was just some random carpenter working on the set that suddenly discovered he could act.
classicwow,fclehr9,t1_fcl5zwg,1577745932.0,"I used to love the banish maneuver when people were being asshats farming demons in Azshara back in vanilla.  It’s the ultimate grief because if they just ignore it and move on, they run the risk of getting overwhelmed when banish finishes, but it lasts for several seconds (wasn’t it like 30?) so it’s annoying as hell to wait to finish."
AskReddit,fckxbgf,t1_fckd130,1577735195.0,Your momma’s so dumb she thinks a light saber has fewer calories.
todayilearned,fckpwhd,t1_fcj96h6,1577730633.0,"Nah, by the mid-to-late 80’s she had already become an iconic celebrity on Wheel of Fortune (for a while, she seemed to be on every magazine cover).  Had they even hinted that they were getting rid of her there would have been a tidal wave of fan outrage."
fo76,fckp4p6,t1_fckgs6x,1577730159.0,My thoughts exactly.  Why bother with content that actually involves coding when you can sell a new power armor color for $18?
funny,fcka5ok,t1_fck0wbz,1577720649.0,I still remember that tv commercial jingle: “Yar’s Revenge is new from Atari.  Have you played Atari today?”
funny,fck9yq4,t1_fck4ias,1577720515.0,"A terrible invention.  The nonporous vinyl would make your ass sweat, and when you finally tried to stand that vinyl would stick to your ass."
Diablo,fcizu1p,t1_fcik6u8,1577673779.0,"I don’t agree with removing them, however, I do see their point.  Once you have companions that are anything more than weak tokens, the game has to be balanced around the assumption that everyone has a companion.  At that point, you will be playing at a disadvantage without one."
OldSchoolCool,fcfzwrt,t1_fcft46m,1577635212.0,"Funny though, flying Korean Airlines is a delightful experience where you encounter polite, friendly service from employees that actually seem to care about your traveling experience.  Contrast that with the experience with attendants on most US carriers in which it is very common to encounter surly hags that seem to be mostly concerned with arriving at the next destination so as to finally be free of these annoyances also known as customers.  On my occasional visits to South Korea I actually pay extra just to ensure that I fly Korean Airlines."

todayilearned,fc8pt54,t1_fc87o4f,1577539782.0,"I still remember watching a Candid Camera skit where the gag was that they were in a hotel and as the person was settling into their room they were informed that the room does not have a working TV (something a lot less relatable nowadays because now everyone has a phone to ease hours of potential boredom).  Of course you have numerous takes of outraged customers.  Then, unexpectedly Fred Rogers is the one settling in to his hotel room.  Upon being informed that the room has no TV, without missing a beat and completely unperturbed he says “that’s OK, I don’t watch TV anyways”.  Mr. Rogers had an almost supernatural calm as well as the self discipline to not watch TV in an era where nearly everybody watched TV."
AskReddit,fc5gkz3,t3_eg6y5d,1577456998.0,"It’s a funny thing, how our society normalizes alcohol.  I’ve been binge-watching the TV show Lucifer during the holiday season.  He’s the devil, so naturally, he drinks and smokes.  But you never actually see him puff a cigarette, it’s always implied, he’ll either have the cig in hand or have it sitting in an ashtray (and even these scenes are extremely uncommon).  But drinking, well, you see him drinking incessantly.  Literally, almost every scene in the show that includes Lucifer has him drinking.  And that doesn’t even include the numerous scenes of other characters in the show drinking and/or inebriated (Lucifer never gets drunk himself).  The takeaway for children watching:  chronic alcoholism is better than taking even a single puff on a cigarette."
