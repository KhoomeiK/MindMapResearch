todayilearned,ffrhx7u,t1_ffr46p2,1580158349.0,"No, there are several. What’s especially strange is this tv interview"
todayilearned,ffrhkto,t1_ffqisx9,1580158169.0,"I thought that was very interesting too. It’s a very sexist take on who can or cannot be victims of certain crimes. I realize this was in the 80s but surely then people realized that men can also be raped and women can also be robbed. It suggests someone who has very rigid views on men and women and who views women as weak and vulnerable. Regardless of knowing while watching this that he was a murderer, the comment would have stuck out to me. It’s very inappropriate."
todayilearned,ffrgbgf,t1_ffr1ano,1580157500.0,Wow that is really scary. I’m so glad you got to grow up with your mom.
relationships,ffejkg4,t1_ffegd4v,1579850658.0,Also we really don’t know that nothing was going on between them.
relationships,ffejg7u,t3_et15a1,1579850514.0,"I don’t think it’s irrational for you to not want your husband spending this much time with a young woman. I certainly wouldn’t be comfortable with that. He made an oath to you, not her. If you have voiced repeatedly that you feel uncomfortable with their relationship then he needs to honor that. Being married isn’t about telling your spouse who they can or cannot hang out with but it is about working with your partner and being respectful. He lied to you about something to do with his time with her. That’s enough right there. Of course he was worried about how you would react to them going to a museum, he knows that makes you uncomfortable but he did it anyway then lied about it. He’s the one who put you in the position of being at your absolute wits end. It was not your responsibility to be polite to someone who your husband forced you into a bad relationship with. You don’t need to grin and bare it to someone you don’t know that well when you are clearly being walked all over. So she doesn’t like you, so what. Thats on your husband for being so shady. Now she knows to stay away and that’s not a bad thing even if she is completely blameless. Your husband on the other hand has put both you and this girl in an extremely uncomfortable position, that’s not on you, that’s on him."

FloridaMan,ff8jnt6,t3_es76pq,1579681617.0,What a punchable looking face. It’s not surprising he even looks like a douche bag.

likeus,fevdefb,t3_eqmt8l,1579396097.0,Give the poor little guy some space. That’s a wild animal with restricted mobility. That “smile” is just how their faces are. The poor thing is probably scared out of its mind.
relationships,fe04vs5,t1_fdzc8vf,1578803140.0,This is was my first concern too. I strongly suspect he knew he was being dishonest. This is incredibly shady and manipulative.

Futurology,fdmh6yf,t3_elu352,1578549781.0,Inaccurate title. Consensus is that decline in smoking is the leading cause of the decline.
