The attention to detail on this one and the use of the actual theme (which is so beautiful and I love it) - just wow.  Thank you for sharing this with us."
TheMagnusArchives,ffdmpb7,t3_esud40,1579824157.0,Poor Julia.  If only she didn’t have to open the shed door.  Really like your drawing. Thank you for sharing your work with us.
TheMagnusArchives,ffdmm32,t1_ffcovv3,1579824104.0,That would be awesome.  Lol
TheMagnusArchives,ffaj5hl,t3_esgs8g,1579737016.0,This is really good.  I liked the music but can’t help but wonder how the regular theme would sound with those visuals.  Will have to figure out how to try that.  Thanks for sharing this.
TheMagnusArchives,ff7xw7o,t3_es1sfx,1579660969.0,This is terrific.  Thank you for sharing your work with us.
TheMagnusArchives,ff4zp8m,t1_ff4we1j,1579576364.0,Thank Cheesus rumpled and just woke up is chic.  I’ve been fashionable all this time and I didn’t know it.  :-D
TheMagnusArchives,ff4qyno,t3_erjlfi,1579570323.0,Bahahahahaha!!!!!!   He certainly would be all eyes.  :-D Thank you for sharing this with us.
TheMagnusArchives,ff4qv2x,t3_ermzfq,1579570256.0,"This is beautiful in a completely creepy and horrifying way.  And I agree with the other commenter, you are amazing.  Thank you for sharing your incredible work with us."
tippytaps,fewt2zs,t1_fewsn1m,1579419080.0,Thank you kind internet stranger.  Me too.  She was a great dog and I miss her every day.
tippytaps,fewiocb,t1_fewiftr,1579411323.0,"I’d mix it in with her food.  From what I read/researched, the straight oil tastes kinda nasty so by mixing it with her food, she’d take it without being grossed out.  

And thank you for your kindness.  She’s been gone a few years now but I’ll always be grateful for the comfort and the extra time the cbd oil gave her."
tippytaps,fewgsj5,t1_fewfhc9,1579410334.0,"Wow sorry about the fumble fingers.  She lived to 18 not 28.  She started having trouble jumping on the bed right before she turned 16.  We gave her cbd and she was running around and jumping like she was a puppy again.  It was amazing.  I’m sure it’s different for each dog just as any medicine can act differently for each person but my goodness, it was like a miracle for my Tofu."
tippytaps,fevog60,t1_fevm8um,1579399700.0,"Same here.  My dog lived an extra few years (to 18) thanks to CBD.  She had bad arthritis and anxiety but the CBD relieved both and kept her happy.

Edited to reflect dog’s actual age.  Sheesh - sorry about that.  18 not 28.  I blame my phone.  :-)"
TheMagnusArchives,fevnf0t,t1_fevlvgn,1579399324.0,And you should blame Jonny.  Personally I can’t fault him for inspiring so much amazing art (you’ve also got a new follower on Tumblr now).   :-D
TheMagnusArchives,fevn65a,t1_fevmi99,1579399226.0,There will be dogs AND cats.  I figured the cats were a given.  And of course they’d be adopted from a shelter.  Both Martin and John know to adopt and not shop.  They’re monsters with good hearts.
TheMagnusArchives,fevl956,t1_fevl53l,1579398751.0,Sweet!  Your tired hands did a wonderful job.  Thank you for sharing your work with us.  :-)
TheMagnusArchives,fevkyyk,t3_eqoia8,1579398655.0,Where do the drawing come from?  Love it!
TheMagnusArchives,fevkuxj,t1_fevjxil,1579398608.0,And he & Jon become dairy farmers in the Scottish highlands complete with a good dog to herd the good cows.
KitchenConfidential,fevk97z,t1_fetw861,1579398372.0,Especially in So Cal.  Dude is a gender neutral term.
TheMagnusArchives,fevjrm6,t1_fesne24,1579398188.0,"Fourthing, Stellar Firma is very funny.  The first couple episodes were a little clunkier as the Brothers Meredith find their vibe but once they get going, wow.  Hilarity ensues.  I am now of the opinion that Tim is as gifted an improv comic as Jonny is a horror writer.  To wit - CARDINAL FANG!  :-D"
limetown,feqejav,t1_fcw36e6,1579340909.0,"It’s way creepy. It has all kinds of horror in it between all of the episodes.  There are content warnings in each episode description though so I’d say give it a try if you like horror at all.  Truly, the writing alone is worth a listen."
SubredditAdoption,fef4yb9,t1_fee6cls,1579048285.0,Me too!
SubredditAdoption,fef4woc,t1_fedd71l,1579048254.0,Not a teacher but an office worker.  Also a spreadsheet nerd.  There are so many useful spreadsheets out there in the world about all kinds of things.  I’m hoping this sub could maybe be more than just teaching spreadsheets (although those are way important and great resources).  Kind of like r/coolguides but with spreadsheets!
TheMagnusArchives,fef4fia,t1_fef3ioz,1579047935.0,"No worries, it’s just so confusing trying to keep the Michaels straight."
TheMagnusArchives,fef352t,t1_fec148c,1579047066.0,"This is incorrect.  Michael Crew, with the Lichtenberg scar, is of The Vast.  Michael Shelley was an archival assistant who became Michael the Distortion, is of The Spiral.  Please see the wiki for confirmation."
TheMagnusArchives,fef2xqu,t3_eosogd,1579046930.0,Holy cheesus.  These are totally pictures taken from that pottery class he was in.  I mean there’s even a freaking spiral one!  Scary how accurately this fits into MAG.
TheMagnusArchives,fecymti,t3_eoeebl,1578990045.0,This is so cool.  The reflection in the window glass - terrific.  Thank you for sharing your work with us.  :-)
TheMagnusArchives,fec1bbk,t3_eodq1e,1578965198.0,"They’re not the same avatar.  I’m not sure where you are listening-wise so I’m going to be purposely vague to avoid spoilers.   Michael Crew is an avatar of the Vast and is the one with the Lichtenberg scar.  He’s referenced in several episodes throughout the series.  

Michael, he of the bony hands, is of The Spiral.  He’s got a long and varied history with The Archives but, again, don’t want to spoil anyone.   Feel free to message me if you want more details or check out the Magnus Archives wiki.  It’s a terrific resource."
TheMagnusArchives,fe5tthp,t3_emxqq5,1578874789.0,I so love your vision of Martin.  Thank you for sharing your work with us.  :-)
TheMagnusArchives,fe5tp36,t3_enuhnb,1578874713.0,Okay that’s right creepy.  Love it!  Thank you for sharing your work with us.  :-)
TheMagnusArchives,fe57v8v,t3_enthko,1578866381.0,Thank you for posting this!  So exciting that u/therustyquill won so many awards!!!
TheMagnusArchives,fe4fbbk,t1_fe3yjrm,1578858693.0,That’s frightening considering what damage Michael could do with his sharp and pointy fingers.  :-D
TheMagnusArchives,fe3r89h,t1_fe35s8f,1578852071.0,"Yep Sasha was his then girlfriend, now wife and Martin & Tim were his housemates.  He’s mentioned that naming his characters was something he struggled with so he’d just use names of people he knew.  At which point Alex pointed out there’s never been a character named Alex.  Lol."
TheMagnusArchives,fe3pojg,t3_end351,1578851713.0,Beautifully and aptly done. Thank you for sharing your work with us.  :-)
TheMagnusArchives,fe3pklp,t1_fdymff6,1578851676.0,"That is probably one of the biggest questions ever in MAG.  There hasn’t been confirmation so far from Jonny, at least that I’m aware of so if anyone knows of any Word of God information from him, please share."
TheMagnusArchives,fdx3med,t1_fdorc86,1578764966.0,"Then you would probably like Rusty Quill Gaming - Lydia Nicholas, who plays Melanie, is in that one and she’s awesome.  Trust me in that even if you’re not a gamer you’ll still enjoy the podcast (says she who isn’t a gamer and still loves that podcast)."
TheMagnusArchives,fdx30ej,t1_fdvilir,1578764749.0,I agree.  If they were Michael’s they’d be sharp and pointy.
TheMagnusArchives,fdx28jf,t3_emzplm,1578764573.0,"I like the bullseye for his face.  It fits with the Michael Shelley being a target for the Spiral, made so by Gertrude.  Thank you for sharing your work with us!  :-)"
TheMagnusArchives,fdmf9wt,t3_elvrzp,1578547968.0,The colors are lovely!  Thank you for sharing your work with us.  :-)
