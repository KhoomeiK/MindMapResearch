Here's one, that was just on my second page of history so it was easy:

> the far left- both woke and commie- are more religious systems than anything else. They get off on being persecuted, they get off on adhering to their strict morality even if it makes them unhappy/""losing"". No different from Jehovah's Witnesses taking a perverse pride in not celebrating holidays or all kinds of Abrahamic fundies eschewing pre-marital sex. They know other people are having ""fun"", but their morality places them above it.

and this one was a few pages further, but more about wokies:

> - It's more a moral system than based upon any type of rational set of policies or platforms

> - you can't break from the orthodoxy for any reason, lest you're ""canceled""

> - It's dependent upon continuously apologizing for your privilege (atoning for original sin) vis a vis anyone who may be more ""oppressed"" than you by way of their demographic identity

> - Anyone who disagrees with it is considered to have some type of moral failing at best or evil at worst

> It's basically 1950s Christianity at this point.

I'm not gonna keep digging, but communism is very much based upon the promise of ""Salvation"".  They ""know"" that eventually capitalism will fall and communism will rule the land, just like fundie Christians ""know"" Jesus will return and bring the Kingdom of Heaven.  Their good books tell them so, they just need to keep the faith during these very difficult times.

In a situation like that I would say that one should lie, and maybe even use force against anyone around you who is about to tell the truth. There are nuances to the reality of these considerations and simplistic answers do not cover the real ground. Also, if you lie to the Nazis about where the Jews are hiding at least you know that you are lying, whereas the sort of social activism that I am referring to tends to be driven by people who are compelled by a sort of religious fervor rather than by more pragmatic and context-sensitive moral considerations. By reducing these issues to dogmatic ideology, some social activists open themselves to charges of hypocrisy from their (often equally dogmatic) opponents.
