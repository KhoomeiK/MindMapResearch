Zero? A worthless personal anecdote maybe? More likely you're just parroting the same tired, deceitful, corporate funded, [anti-union rhetoric](https://www.counterpunch.org/2008/03/14/common-myths-about-labor-unions/) you heard from someone else; a favorite circlejerk in conservative media and in MAGA echo chambers."
