AskReddit,ff8epfa,t3_es4c8q,1579675309.0,"It’s a very ridiculous cycle that no one really benefits from, in general, and I think every system needs an overhaul in this aspect.

For example, what if people being punished for breaking rules are breaking rules that were created as extra rules/restrictions due to previous rule breakage?

Why not, instead of punishing people for breaking rules, we actually try as a society/country try to teach how *to* act/do/say instead of just outlining how *NOT* to act/do/say? 

And why not help those who break rules instead of just punishing them (with exceptions for things like breaking major laws or actions/words that cause harm or damage)?

When a child or pet does something wrong, simply hitting it and saying what it did wrong resolves nothing... so why do we treat anyone else any different? If more effort went into the front-loading of knowledge/examples/instructions, we wouldn’t waste so much time, energy, and resources on punishment that attacks the symptom, not the the source, of the issue."

Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. 

But as far as everyone else goes, it doesn't exist, okay?"
