fatlogic,ff453wk,t1_ff44jlr,1579555737.0,"Definitely, but it's explicitly based around communities so people think their ideas represent the majority less. It still is a problem though and I wanted to put it in my original comment but somehow forgot about it."

fatlogic,ff3k2tz,t1_ff3ffdw,1579542726.0,"Because twitter works by cattering similar minded people to each other. In theory, it's helpful to connect and potentially make friends, but in practice just produces echo chambers for extreme ideas like white supremacy, woke bullshit, extreme weebs, HAAS activists that normalise unhealthy eating, even paedophilia..."

Cringetopia,fesr9ml,t1_fes41jc,1579368174.0,"Yeah, if she was genuinely rude about it and condemned people for donating to fire relief, that's dumb, but her point was probably that you could help animals more by becoming vegan and that it takes some amount of cognitive dissonance to donate money for an animal welfare cause (for people that donated with the intent of helpting them) and still care contribute to an industry that hurts other animals on a bigger scale. You can advocate for one cause only, but if you truely care about general animal welfare, it's better to choose veganism. Imo, both are important, it's just a question of scale."
Cringetopia,ferz1mo,t1_fervwet,1579359830.0,"Where's the lie though? Look up how factory farms treat animals (most meat comes from factory farms) and you'll probably change your opinion on the matter, or at least have a more nuanced approach"

ShitPostCrusaders,fcxwhmf,t1_fcx61vc,1578071453.0,"Your age doesn't really matter, yes, you're super tall for your age (6'3""-6'4"" I assume?), but being a tall guy is almost universally seen as a good thing by society. Yes, you may have to lower your head to pass through doors, you'll be cramped in airplanes and public transport but unless you're extremely thin (which you can choose to change by going to the gym and eating more), no one will have any reason to laugh at you, as it's a commonly wanted trait. Being tall for a girl (I'd say more than 5'11""-6') sucks if you're not attractive as having a girl taller than the guy in a couple isn't seen well by society generally."
