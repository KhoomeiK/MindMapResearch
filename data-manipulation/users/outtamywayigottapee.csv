NoStupidQuestions,fferhsb,t3_et6mos,1579861933.0,"You’re using too many commas.

There’s actual grammatical rules, but the easiest way that will generally steer you quite well is to read the sentence aloud, pausing when you get to a comma, and if it sounds weird then you need to review it."

TalesFromTheCustomer,ff5u2g5,t1_ff4y1cw,1579610256.0,"I had a similar experience too.  I was shopping around online and one of the companies who are always advertising that they’ll save you money wanted a phone number so they could ask more questions to give me the best quote.  I was wary, because once they get your number they never give up, but it was the only way to get a quote.

Man rang me promptly, asked me some questions and then clicked some buttons to generate my quote.  With an actual air of satisfaction, he announced that he could offer me the cover I wanted for ...$800.  I could tell from the tone of his voice that he was expecting me to be stoked, and he was stunned when I laughed out loud and replied that my current insurer was offering the same cover for $550.

After clarifying that they really were offering the same cover, he just said ‘well, that’s a great deal, I’d advise you to take it because can’t match it’, thanked me for allowing them to offer a quote, and said goodbye.

It’s been two years and they haven’t contacted me to review my car insurance, offer me home insurance, or try to sell me life insurance or funeral cover.  This is absolutely unprecedented!"
