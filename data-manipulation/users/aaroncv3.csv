bipolar,fdinslg,t3_elkvip,1578447038.0,"Yes.  And you hit the nail on the head. After I learned to (and do the action of) practicing better management of bipolar symptoms, I have been able to amend for my damages, and repair broken friendships.  Some.  Not all. For the ones that cannot be mended, it has to be good enough to know for myself that, if I could amend, I honestly would.  If I can do that, then peace may enter.  Even if a person will not accept my amends, I can at least have the peace of knowing that I did my best.

Good luck."
