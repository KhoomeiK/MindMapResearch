It also feels kind of unfair that the people who never ask for difficulties just end up having them. But that can go for literally all difficulties and literally all people.

Also since I still live with my parents and they don’t understand too well, it just gets really frustrating sometimes. All I know is that it doesn’t exactly feel like something to be proud of when society instead shames you for not being like them. But thank you for your support and I’ll keep that in mind. :)"
