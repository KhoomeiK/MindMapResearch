thisismylifenow,ff2om4s,t1_ff2fuuy,1579516588.0,"Years ago I was snowboarding and went off the main trail inadvertently (was early morning so was carving fresh tracks and visibility wasn’t great so I couldn’t tell) and next thing I know I suddenly go from floating gracefully on top to buried to my chest similar to this guy. 

I realized immediately how fucked I was. I was alone, in an area that nobody else was likely to pass, and my efforts of climbing out were having exactly 0 effect. 

After probably 20 minutes of flailing around and trying to dig myself out I was exhausted and realized I needed to rethink it or I’d exert all my energy and end up freezing to death. 

I eventually got my board off and to the surface and shifted enough snow around to leverage my way out somehow but I was there for probably 45 minutes before getting myself out and was freezing and completely drained. 

I avoided the area for the rest of the day lol. 

This is also common around tree wells which is why you wanna avoid riding/skiing too close to them as well."

But seriously DCA manageable chunks monthly over the next 4-5 years and you are virtually guaranteed to have significantly more than what you’d have leaving it in CDs. 

Put aside 5m in bonds/cash/gold for the truly black swan event if you’re that paranoid."

Should I also read the Absent Superpower and the Accidental Superpower, or is there a lot of redundancy/overlap across these?

Would love to hear Peter’s/others’ thoughts"

Sounds a bit like your family and lawyer are trying to run your life. You have a kid with this women, she and your son are now a part of their family whether they like it or not. 

I understand the desire to protect your family’s wealth but giving her peanuts for raising your child and enabling you to work is a joke and a great way to have your kid resent you when he’s older."

And yet we should be “civil”?"
