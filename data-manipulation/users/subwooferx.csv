videos,ffkwezl,t1_ffkusvs,1580030231.0,i‘ve been arguing with several people here and no one‘s been able to provide real evidence for other racist tweets. all the other examples were even less convincing of her supposed racism than this one - which at least can definitely be legitimately be interpreted as racist if just going by what she wrote and ignoring what she claims she knew and thought when she wrote it.

So if one were to believe her, one has no basis to be offended and no remorse, change or redemption needed. and i know you don't believe her, but why wouldn't you given her decades long career of inclusion of all sorts of minorities including especially african american and the fact that the politician in question would easily be regarded white in most countries in the world that dont subscribe to the US' mind boggling one drop rule."

also, „public intellectual“ is just a statement of fact, why would there be any irony needed? it doesn‘t mean you consider yourself super smart. if you‘re screamed at by batman on tv for your intellectual stances that you‘ve described in your numerous books, you are objectively a public intellectual."

If it's really a power supply issue, I don't understand how that's not on top of every review - isn't high speed drive access one of the main selling points of getting an expensive active dock to avoid the throttling you get with cheap dongles?

I hope there's a solution there... I haven't heard of another dock yet, to which I can connect both my macbook pro or an ipad pro."

I have tried various drives and cables and it's so far no word from caldigit support. Anyone heard of this problem?
