These ID laws are usually joined by the closing of facilities in predominately black neighborhoods, making it harder to get an ID. On top of that they will do things like looking at what the most common form of ID is in black communities and not add them to the list of acceptable identification. 

These politicians don’t make it impossible for black people to vote. They just make it a lot more difficult so that enough of them are discouraged from voting. In fact the Supreme Court shut down North Carolina’s voter ID laws after finding that the state was targeting minorities “with almost surgical precision”. Their words, not mine.

We’re southern abolitionists wrong to speak out against slavery while living in a society that reaps the economic benefits of having slaves? If I use a device that’s all but necessary in the modern world for say, my job, I can’t advocate for improving the system that makes the device? That’s fucking childish view on ethics."

television,fcp606z,t1_fcp3goq,1577851599.0,Not gonna lie. Part of me is a bit envious with the way the last decade went...
worldnews,fcoo2en,t1_fcn9l8j,1577837081.0,"Nah, I’ll criticize the U.S. government and violent terrorists attacking civilians. Cause you know what? I can do both! But I don’t think you went far enough with your straw man. Why not say that everyone who criticizes the U.S. actually loves the terrorists? Or even better, they *are* terrorists. Right?"
videos,fcomye2,t1_fcob1im,1577836273.0,"So you don’t think the argument that we should be taxing the rich in order to fund the fight against climate change holds any water? If I’m a socialist I just shouldn’t give my view on the topic? And yeah, you can say that climate change is the reason for the brush fires and the blame for climate change largely rests at the feet of the wealthy. Is it really that hard to grasp?"
AskReddit,fcohx3x,t1_fcnoo7c,1577832637.0,My favorite part is the one sided phone call between the two leaders.
pics,fcbskrr,t1_fcbjmxo,1577590503.0,"Why don’t we just compare the death count between right vs left wing terror in the last decade? It’s much higher on one side and I’ll let you take a guess at which side that is. The shooting at the baseball game was the one left leaning guy involved in a mass shooting that I mentioned before sarcastically saying that it outweighs all the mass shooting perpetrated by right wingers. Oh and yeah, I forgot to mention the guy who tried to burn an empty bus to prevent ICE agents from kidnapping children. My bad. But again, let’s look at the death toll in the last decade if you really want to compare the two sides.

Edit: Also it’s a little funny that you’re able to lump all leftists in the same group to make a point, but naming the alt-right doesn’t count because they’re just a small portion. You truly are a free thinker aren’t ya."

pics,fcbgukm,t1_fcb9uce,1577586696.0,"Yeah the left is violently opposing political rivals. One of them ran a young girl over with his car... wait no. He identified as alt-**right**. Well... one of them committed a shooting once, which totally outweighs the fact that the vast majority of politically motivated shootings are perpetrated by right-wing terrorists. Oh and the fact that self-identified members of the alt-**right** share Nazi rhetoric is totally just a goof, right? And remember how the left was chanting “lock her up” in reference to a right wing candidate that they disagreed with. That was pretty fascy of them. Oh wait! That was the right as well... weird.

But please tell me more about how those who want to get rid of literal concentration camps are like the nazis."

OldSchoolCool,fcakk4o,t1_fc9ylc8,1577571019.0,If you want to be a nonconformist you have to dress like we do and listen to the same music as us.
worldnews,fcabpk1,t1_fca6i0j,1577566292.0,Yeah. People in news subreddits give gold to news articles that they think are important... that’s kind of a weird thing to mock. And that’s why people thought you were being dismissive. Not everyone who misunderstands you is an idiot.
worldnews,fca5rzl,t1_fca2hq7,1577563470.0,"Buddy, maybe it wasn’t your intent, but your comment absolutely sounded dismissive of the article. It’s actually hard to read it any other way and considering the replies and downvotes, I’m not the only one that thinks so. People can’t see past your comment to understand your intent, so all we can do is look at the way it’s phrased. And it was phrased poorly."
