Dual citizenship would be a useful thing to have.  Easier to travel the EU, buy property, conduct business, etc. 

If Someone wanted to buy a 2nd home or retire there it would be useful to have...lol it’s just a funny thought not like she’d ever actually do it."

Edit-tell your parents to find Giuseppe(lol I could pm you his last name) and tell him that someone was taking to his wife’s cousin in America on reddit..."

It’s something my grandmother or mom would be interested in if they were still alive with my gram being a first generation immigrant so I thought I’d look into a bit while I do some other American things on New Year’s Day.  Pork and sauerkraut anyone? 

I wouldn’t call a passing interest in the exact area my ancestors are from and still inhabit is an obsession.  Seems like a pretty normal thing to be curious about. 

I’ve never understood the thinly and not so thinly veiled superiority complex a lot of Europeans have towards Americans..."

I could see one of them saying that to her in person 10000% if she was draping her cleavage over a pizza. 

“OMG Karen did your tits eat that pizza” “those tits look full better not feed em” “you could lose a slice in that cleavage” “Jesus Christ put your tits away”

I could see them saying all those things.  “Gotta feed the boobies” would have been tame"
AmItheAsshole,fclq2r0,t3_ehv0gg,1577753714.0,"My ex wife had a cousin with fake tits and she was always wearing deep cleavage stuff and looking for attention.  It was well known and a running joke in her family that her tits were her best feature. She loved those things, I think OPs cousin sounds similar. 

At a family event I attended I heard at least 20 different jokes or comments about them.  Jokes from cousins, aunts, uncles, her dad.  My point is I don’t think it’s totally uncommon for family members to think smart ass comments about someone’s boob job are out of line. 

Some of the girls were kinda catty about it but everything was in good fun.  

I’m going with NAH. That comment seemed pretty innocent. 

If the caption had been something about wanting to eat the pizza off her chest or motor-boating then you’d be the ah."

Your gf should just stop doing things for her and don’t throw away your money.  If it was a gift it’s a gift and no repayment of money or obligation for deeds is required. 

If you feel like paying her back and there is NO reason to.  Tally up how many hours she’s worked under her thumb and deduct that from the balance.  I think $20hr sounds fair? Maybe more?

Founders dying isn’t irrelevant I think it’s incredibly relevant.  If they don’t get the cure they are taking us out. If they do get it they are curing themselves AND taking us out...you think the Founders are going to live Up to “demands”??? Once they are in power every human they can find dies without question.
