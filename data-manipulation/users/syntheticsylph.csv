AnimalCrossing,ffm9fwh,t3_eu1x29,1580050931.0,"My husband bought me a Switch but I haven’t played it because there aren’t a lot of good games and I’m just waiting for AC. 

Funny enough, he’s playing Stardew and loves it. But when NH comes, I’m going to be like that to him haha. 

I also told him he’d probably like the AC series because it’s like Stardew but there’s no battles or time constraints to worry about."
CocoPPaDolls,ff9xezp,t1_ff9tc0s,1579723593.0,"Thanks. I always try to use the lightbulb icon (I forgot the name) before I start so it auto equips what’s in my inventory first. 

I was wondering if I had to buy/make what the suggested outfit was and I’m hesitant to do so because it seems hard to make a lot of gold in this game. All the crafting and buying starts to add up. 

I’ll look into following their guide for my next battle. Thanks for your help. :)"
ac_newhorizons,ff9gig0,t3_es64ul,1579712521.0,I love how the new renders make them kinda look like stuffed animals. That ups the cute factor for me. :)
imaginarycosmere,ff6jjfe,t1_ff4gv7n,1579628554.0,Yes I always pictured him a little disheveled hehe but I think Vin notes he looks more kingly after he comes into his own.
imaginarycosmere,ff3w0o3,t1_ff395wx,1579550077.0,"I always imagined her still wiry as she got older. Kinda like Aelita if you’ve seen that film.

Also I like how Elend is depicted. It’s closer in my head than the book cover version."
imaginarycosmere,ff3vyd3,t3_er60zq,1579550037.0,"We get it Vin, you vape."
gaming,fepf4es,t1_fep6rk2,1579318940.0,I don’t want to go sledding.
AnimalCrossing,fepf0f3,t1_fep403a,1579318860.0,You can never have too many AC subs.
ac_newhorizons,fepeyod,t1_fep0f7u,1579318826.0,"Hmm so like the older designs. That makes me feel better hehe. I’d like to play with my kids and I think they’d like to have their own house too. 

And they wouldn’t mess mine up lol."
TrueChristian,feorhz7,t1_feo2vrd,1579304436.0,Thanks. I haven’t heard of this one before. I’ll check it out.
thisisus,fenotbr,t1_fenoe22,1579288751.0,"Ah sorry I meant about Kate’s boyfriend and not the current situation in his house. 

I don’t think TIU will go there since that would be pretty dark if he killed himself on screen. That and their characters so far haven’t shown signs of additional trauma like that. Maybe he killer himself later and Randall still felt regret for it."
Stormlight_Archive,fenojxs,t1_feniddj,1579288616.0,"Same, but I think it does look similar. I’ll have to go back and check. I love “weapons” like this type and I’m all about more jewelry. :)"
TrueChristian,fenmlgo,t1_fen4o9q,1579287915.0,Do you know the cult’s name?
thisisus,fenm7yu,t1_fenk8qt,1579287684.0,What about the suicide talk before? In the first season he talked a guy down and it sounded like he did that before but we never saw anything like that again.
fatlogic,fenlkic,t1_femxruy,1579287284.0,Thanks. I’ve read to measure below the ribs too. I’ll try above my belly button or slightly above like you mentioned.
ac_newhorizons,fenl1v4,t1_fen0ii0,1579286967.0,"If up to 4 players can play at once on the same island, does that mean they each get their own house or are they just able to play on the island without a house? Hmmm."
fatlogic,femxfzo,t1_femwpc2,1579272128.0,"That helps. I currently don’t have a defined waist and it’s kind of frustrating trying to find it when I find diagrams that don’t make sense.

Like what am I measuring exactly? Haha 

I think if we actually measured the waist a lot of women would be surprised. Just like with bras and other measurements that have arbitrary sizes."
terracehouse,fekvsst,t1_fec0w60,1579208630.0,"I loved Hana and her friends. She was more relaxed and confident and cute around them. She gets too overwhelmed with love and I think she needs to relax, but this is an opportunity for her to grow since she’s young and move on from Ryo. She’ll find someone who will want to protect her. :)"
anime,fefn8b5,t1_fe55wi8,1579060008.0,"I was reminded of that too as well as Bakuman, because I love shows about behind the scenes."
anime,fefn657,t1_feadbnf,1579059968.0,"Same. I was always curious how they did that but I didn’t know the name. That video was cool to watch, thanks!"
terracehouse,fefm5h0,t1_fef82wp,1579059297.0,Oh right. I forgot a bit about that whole part hehe. He was pretty patient.
anime,fecmatj,t1_fec2nqm,1578977439.0,I’ll add it to my list. Thanks. :)
anime,febs6om,t1_fea382s,1578962078.0,Thanks!
anime,febs63a,t1_fea36ia,1578962071.0,Thanks. I’ll check it out. I liked the other examples provided and that caught my eye.
anime,fe98f1s,t1_fe8hu53,1578935323.0,So is all streetwear like this or how can I find more about this look? I like the aesthetic. :)
anime_irl,fdsjehl,t1_fdsev0j,1578703886.0,"That’s pretty sad, I didn’t know. I’m sure they could get a new director if they wanted to make more of the series. 

I really enjoy the story and I hope the creator is doing better because I’d like to see more but I understand it’s hard to be a mangaka in Japan."
anime_irl,fdsczqw,t1_fdsc4fo,1578699812.0,Why’s that? My husband and I really enjoyed the anime.
AnimalCrossing,fdqz3lv,t3_emrgmv,1578677151.0,That stand is super cute. I didn’t know they made them until now hehe.
terracehouse,fdqnq08,t1_fdq66k1,1578670964.0,"Yeah, I just realized her hair isn’t a wig haha. I miss the pink."
terracehouse,fdqnjki,t1_fdqhth9,1578670853.0,Those arms haha. I want her tone.
sailormoon,fdqmv9s,t1_fdqh0f3,1578670422.0,"It depends on the artist. Originally in the anime they were close if not the same. But as it went on, I think Moon got darker hair in Eternal but I’d have to check. It’s been years haha. But I notice it in the manga as well. 

It’s not official but I like to think of them as different kinds of blondes. :)"
