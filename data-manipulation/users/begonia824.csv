schizophrenia,ffi3mis,t1_ffi0kn7,1579964119.0,"I think for my son it would give him some answers about his childhood, and how he always felt like the outsider, and always the one who didn’t get the joke.  It might also open up another avenue of therapy that might be helpful for him. But beyond that, there is no cure for either condition, so the benefit would be limited."
schizophrenia,ffhzgjr,t1_ffh9zz0,1579960298.0,"I’m sorry you had that experience. For a long time I just thought my son was a lazy ass and unmotivated. Obviously now I know better, but I feel terrible about thinking that and for the things I said to him. Not my best parenting."
stopdrinking,ffgu1rj,t3_etgj0v,1579915058.0,It’s ok! Just learn what you can from why you drank? And keep on trying! This is not a success only journey. There are ups and downs and highs and lows. Keep trying.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffgtoau,t3_ethaky,1579914784.0,"Starbucks bathrooms are all unisex, who cares? Urinals are disgusting, and shouldn’t exist anyway. How many young boys have been targeted by predators in men’s rooms? My husband caught a guy trying to use the urinal next to my very young son, and he clearly had shady intentions. The dude left when he saw my husband staring him down. My husband is 6’3” and over 200lb."
