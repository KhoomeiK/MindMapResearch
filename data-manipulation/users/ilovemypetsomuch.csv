AskReddit,ffpy3um,t1_ffpxvit,1580110476.0,I got realllyyy light headed from nicotine and was passing out in my backyard. My dogs dug holes and i was stumbling around trying to reach a couch. I also have a bloodphobia so its hard for me to deal with injuries.
AskReddit,ffpy07o,t1_ffpxskw,1580110345.0,Oh no D: Im glad someone was around and you werent hurt! I hope its been easier for you. I passed out at a roller skating place and didnt realize it either until I recovered. It was so embarrassing because I woke up with my eyes wide open just staring at the people above me. There was a huge pile of pink goo next to me because I threw up my strawberry wafers. :(

AskReddit,feo9rxr,t3_eptxb3,1579297103.0,"I found out my step dad had hidden cameras. There was multiple cameras in my bathroom and bedroom. Turns out he was in love with me and had a 2tb hard drive with 20,000 photos and videos of me, friends, exs, photos from my laptop I took throughout my life. He had been in my life since I was about age 6 and killed himself when I was 23. When I reached out to his previous wives and other kids, I learned that he was also abusive to them and lied a lot about his life and where they stood."
