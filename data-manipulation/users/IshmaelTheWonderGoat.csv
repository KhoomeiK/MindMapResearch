newfoundland,ff1ki64,t1_ff1gswe,1579480654.0,Maybe it was a kitten stuck in a tree. There was also an avalanche they responded to. I hope it wasn't a kitten stuck in a tree. There was a fire at Boston Pizza. It'd be so cold. And a roof was blown off a business on Blackmarsh. The poor baby. I hope they managed to rescue it.

Eu-  good, from ancient greek, eu

dusky

adjective, dusk·i·er, dusk·i·est.

somewhat dark; having little light; dim; shadowy.

This explains why gingers are considered to have no souls, it is not, as many think, a recent meme, but something that has been around since (at least) the time of the ancient greeks. This may have come about because Ares, the greek god of war, was also regarded as the patron of Thrace. He was even known as Thrax, the quintessential Thracian. Around 500BC Xenophanes described how both the Thracian people, and hence their gods, tended towards red hair (and blue eyes).

Ares was despised by gods and mortals alike. Despite being the god of war, he represented only the unpleasant aspects of battle (Athena represented things such as military strategy), and he was generally considered a coward."
