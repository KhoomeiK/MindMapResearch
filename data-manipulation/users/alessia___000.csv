depression,ff8k4nm,t3_es88w8,1579682284.0,I'm so happy for you!!! Wish you all the best :)
CasualConversation,ff5jeob,t1_ff5jbct,1579595669.0,"Exactly... Like for example knitting or playing cards (not gambling tho), if I say I like those things out of my friend group (I have two or three friends who, thank God, have the same hobbies as me so they understand) people will look at me like I'm crazy. I get the ""ahah are you 80?"" ""You're old inside"" etc jokes all the time"
CasualConversation,ff5iyc3,t3_errlp3,1579595035.0,"Same here. I feel the same. Except that I'm sarcastic 99% of the time and people just laugh their asses off every time I casually say anything and I like??? I'm not trying to be funny why are you laughing??? But at the same time I'm such a boring person, I act like I'm a lot older than I am (that's why I'm boring, I have ""boring hobbies"" and act older but not in a bad way, like it's not like I have a old mindset, I just live like an old person)"
depression,ff5hfz6,t1_ff5hbmp,1579593029.0,"I'm glad I was able to think through it and rationalize it, it's not as bad now so I'm still in time to help myself and avoid all that"
depression,ff5h6mf,t1_ff5h5r7,1579592696.0,I will be saying this to them. It will be difficult but it's what I have to do
UnsentLetters,ff5gvp3,t3_erquhc,1579592316.0,This hurts damn
depression,ff5gmyr,t3_errbev,1579592009.0,"(sorry for the poor grammar, English isn't my first language and I wrote the post really quickly, I didn't pay attention to grammar and stuff)"
depression,ff3aofe,t3_erf7n7,1579537509.0,"I wish I could help you, I really really wish I could but I honestly don't know what to say... I understand what you say, and I relate to it in a way, because I, too, have just been trying to run away from my ""problems"", my depression, my traumas, my anxiety and I'm failing. All I can say is help yourself?? If that make sense?? I know it sounds crazy but I guess it's the only way, Therapy helps, support helps, but in the end I guess you're the only one that can really take you and say ""we got this"". It sounds so impossible and it takes so much to kinda ""step back"" from yourself and watch it from a different perspective but if it helps, it's worth it. I don't know you personally, but I feel like you're a wonderful person that cares about others, I hope you'll be able to get out of this abyss and live happily and freely but other than say all this (that sound like nonsense) there's not much I can do, and I'm really sorry for that. Sometimes the biggest obstacle we have to face is ourselves,I hope you can overcome it, really. Wish you all the best"
depression,ff36sae,t3_ererwo,1579535041.0,"I know that feeling... Every day is the same and I can't seem to be able to change that. Sorry you have to go through this, I hope you can break the chain of ""one day after another"" and be able to enjoy every day"
depression,ff36nzn,t3_eres53,1579534961.0,"I'm glad I'm not the only one that feels like this!! Lately I've been feeling like I'm not in control of what I do and sometimes I like ""wake up"" and realize I wasn't conscious of what I was doing and I always feel like I'm not living thing in first person but from an exterior perspective if that makes sense. I feel like I'm watching myself just like I'm in a movie. Sometimes it gets so bad I don't even hear sounds because I'm so lost in thought... It's scary"
amiugly,ff2ql7j,t3_er3106,1579519555.0,You're gorgeous :)

Crushes,ff2eodw,t1_ff0yi1x,1579503015.0,All my friends told me that... But I don't know cause you know he can choose whether he wants to have anything to do with me or no so I feel like there's nobody to blame here. I understand your point of you tho
Crushes,ff03265,t1_fezpggy,1579464670.0,It's ok... Thank you for worrying tho :)
Crushes,ff0307a,t1_fezrjdo,1579464647.0,"It wasn't really a confession... I texted something like ""hey, you saw the new star wars movie?"" Cause we both like star wars and he didn't even read the message. Once he answered a text I sent him after 6 months..."

AskReddit,fey39xd,t3_eqw49b,1579440211.0,"I don't currently have depression but I was depressed for some years so... A thing not many people notice is not taking care of themselves... Like not showering, not brushing you teeth or taking care of your hair. I know it sounds disgusting but it happens. Lack of interest in things you loved before (for example I loved and still love music, but when I was depressed I totally gave up on it), failing at school (you see not future so you don't really care about things like that)"
Crushes,fex5etv,t3_eqqctg,1579424725.0,All the time... It sucks cause I can't go back

Crushes,fesk1en,t3_eqiix5,1579366030.0,I think the best thing to do would be talking to her and hopefully talk things out

Crushes,fes7puc,t1_fes2bzr,1579362236.0,"We didn't end on bad terms we... Didn't end at all, we just gradually stopped talking and I know from him that he doesn't hate me, and that he actually finds me nice but I can't help but think I can bother him"

Crushes,fenr2o3,t3_eq477n,1579289615.0,"It was awkward for the first like 10 minutes, then I didn't really pay attention to it"
Crushes,fenqyh7,t3_eq4rbi,1579289562.0,I think it's normal to talk less for some time even as best friends so my advice is don't worry too much and if it continues politely ask her if everything is ok between you two
Crushes,fenqp82,t1_fenqey5,1579289420.0,"I hope for you she does, good luck"
Crushes,fenqmcz,t3_eq4y5j,1579289373.0,my advice is go for it. It may not turn out exactly how you wanted but at least you won't regret not having confessed. I'm saying this because I've liked a friend of mine for the past 6 years and I really don't have the courage to confess and I regret not telling him. Better to be just friends than regret it and end up not talking etc

That's good to know tho, thanks for the clarification"
AskReddit,fem94a5,t3_epwuyb,1579244322.0,"I was told throughout all my childhood that if I ate too many almonds (for too many I mean around 10 or something) I would get fever and I really believed it so. I tried to get fever when I didn't want to go to school by eating a shit ton of almonds. My parents never told me it was just a trick to make me stop eat almonds (I ate a lot of almonds) so about a year ago I asked about this thing and my mom went ""That? Oh, that was just to get you to stop eating almonds"". I felt really dumb."
Crushes,fekt9rk,t3_epld4u,1579207139.0,I just keep dreaming that we meet at like parties and stuff and all we do is sit down and talk for a long period of time. It's sad cause we used to talk everyday and know we don't talk anymore

AskReddit,fe8zs3x,t3_eo6ak5,1578932695.0,Romanticising mental illness... I think we should spread awareness about mental health and try to provide free help to whoever needs it but I don't get why lately so many people want (at all costs) to be mentally ill... it's not a personality trait. People will not take it seriously if they see it as a trend

unpopularopinion,fdu1619,t3_cr8zci,1578725676.0,"A close friend of mine has been pretending to have depression and anxiety for a while so, since I had depression myself and still struggle with anxiety, I pushed for her to reach out for help and go to a therapist. It took about 3 months to convince her and when she went there, it turned out she didn't have depression nor anxiety. Yet she wanted to have it so bad... I had my suspicions, I thought she was faking it but I couldn't risk to leave her without help in case she was actually ill. Well, to this day she continues pretending to be ill and honestly is she trying to be quirky or something? I don't get it"
toxicparents,fdrpu2a,t1_fdreqjn,1578687913.0,"I looked it up and in my country you should technically report in the 6 months after the fact or the case will probably go cold or something and you can't report to the police without a guardian or your parents before the age of 14... So yeah, not good. I'm still a minor even tho I'm almost adult and I don't really have the freedom to go and report without my parents noticing it because it would be weird for me to go out to the police station and it would stand out I guess. At this point I doubt I will get justice so I'll invest my time in trying to prevent this from happening to other kids, that's the least I can do"
toxicparents,fdrojl6,t1_fdrnnto,1578687380.0,"I'm not sure you can report after so many years but if it's possible then I'll do it... It may depend on the country, I'll search it up. Thanks for your kindness by the way"
toxicparents,fdreqjn,t3_emd309,1578683536.0,"I'm really sorry to hear this. A very similar thing happened to me and after a while at about 13/14 I managed to get the courage to tell my mom my older cousin abused me from when I was about 3/4 till I was about 6/7 and started avoiding him at family reunions. I only told my mom and when I told her, she told me not to tell anyone else, especially my father and my aunt (his mother) because my father would get angry and my aunt would be destroyed, then she told me it was just ""teenage curiousity"" and that he wanted to ""see what a girl's body looked like"". I was just a child. This event, caused me so much pain... I developed anxiety, I was depressed and still now I struggle to trust almost every male person I encounter. I'm also very scared of intimacy and I can't bring myself to be close (as in a romantic relationship)  to people, so I never had any kind of physical contact with the opposite sex. I guess my mother wanted to protect the perfect image of the perfect family she had in her head. I decided to wait until I'm ready and report him to the police on my own. I'm sorry I can't help you much but I really, deeply hope you can solve your problems and live a wonderful life."
