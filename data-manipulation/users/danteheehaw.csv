PS4,ffik1n3,t1_ffifbxi,1579975728.0,"Programing for the CPU wasn't hard. It wasn't impossible, nor next to it. Sony banked on devs dumping extra load into the CPU that is normally ran by the GPU. DICE is a team that did it well. BF3 dumped a lot of the lighting onto the CPU, allowing BF3 to output better everything on the PS3. Otherwise it was like programing for anything else. Sony designed the API to be dev friendly. That's why we saw a surge of Indy games going from PC to PS3 and 360. Even though these Indy teams were small as hell.

People who say the PS3 was hard to program for were trying to say Sony made a poor choice for expecting devs to fully use the cell style CPU. If you didn't specifically program for it, it would work like a normal CPU that was still a lot faster than the 360. But if a team took their time to use all 6 threads it was leagues ahead and could take on task usually dedicated to the GPU.

Basically, anyone could program a game for either console just as easily. The 360 would perform better with the same amount of effort. Devs that dedicated extra resources to the PS3 would often see better performance. However, most studios didn't care to put in the extra effort."

MS is caring less about pushing the xbox over the PC, just so long as you are using windows they get a bit of the cut.

gaming,ff87duy,t1_ff860sr,1579668110.0,"They killed off a lot of things I liked about the previous games in exchange for being more appealing to more casual gamers. I don't fault Bethesda for that, it's a good move for business, but taking out half the spells and a lot of customization options kinda killed it for me. Also, it was a big let down in technical advancement. The game engine still has the clunkiness of Morrowind. If they had updated the engine to be smoother, less buggy etc etc I could look past the dumbed downed changes.

Moreover, Bethesda no longer has an excuse to be releasing such buggy games. I understood for Morrowind. I was able to look past Oblivion due to them clearly becoming more console friendly. I do not understand how one of the top grossing game companies gets a free pass on releasing a hot mess of a game. Complete with game breaking bugs that the community needed to fix on the PC"

US does this now too, but post/bases used to be a bit more remote. So it was hard not to hit the civilians.
