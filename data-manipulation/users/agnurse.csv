Following a crash, he would get up and say with great dignity, ""I meant to do that"". Jasper looks to be kind of doing the same thing."

JUSTNOMIL,ffr3j1w,t3_euok0e,1580149669.0,"I agree with PPs - this is not an emergency on your part. She had YEARS to get to this point. Really, what you and she need to do is sit down with a financial planner. She may need to cancel the vacation, sell the RV, sell the vehicle and either buy a used one she can pay cash for up front, or else consider giving up driving. The dog may also have to go. BIL may be entitled to benefits that a social worker or financial planner could advise him about.

She needs to differentiate between ""wants"" and ""needs"". She NEEDS a roof over her head, balanced meals, clothing, and utilities. She WANTS an RV, a timeshare, a European vacation, a dog, and an expensive vehicle. Those aren't necessities, and they especially aren't necessities when you're broke."

JUSTNOMIL,ffr05wm,t3_euhwzv,1580147554.0,"Keep in mind that your children are not your MIL's emotional support animals. She needs to find something else to be her reason to live. My suggestions:

1. Practice situational awareness when you're out in public. Ensure your children know to stay close to you.
2. Advise the school that ONLY your or your DH is to pick up your children.
3. Advise the children to ONLY go somewhere with you or DH.
4. Keep an eye on your children when they're playing in the yard, and maybe consider having them play in the backyard only.
5. Consider installing security cameras.
6. Lock your doors when you're home. If she has a key, change the locks."

(The dog appeared not to know quite what to make of him.) Then again, Biggie was not the brightest crayon in the box. He had almost no hunting instinct. I suspect that if we had shown him a hamster he would have snuggled it."

JUSTNOMIL,ffpn6zz,t1_ffpjhqn,1580099296.0,"Catholics are not permitted to use artificial birth control for the purpose of contraception. However, there is NOT an expectation that they reproduce irresponsibly. A couple with a grave reason for avoiding pregnancy (e.g. recent childbirth, finances, illness, etc.; the grave reason is determined by the couple considering the welfare of themselves, the children they have, and any subsequent children) may use natural family planning methods to avoid pregnancy. Modern methods, such as Creighton, Billings, Serena, and Marquette have similar efficacy to the Pill and have been scientifically studied and backed by evidence. They can be used at any time in a woman's reproductive life, regardless of cycle regularity, as they rely on physical signs and symptoms. It is permissible to use birth control pills to treat a medical condition such as endometriosis.

I'd suggest that anyone who wants to know what the Catholic Church really teaches about birth control read Humanae Vitae (On Human Life) and Evangelium Vitae (The Gospel of Life). There are many misconceptions."

ChoosingBeggars,ffpmn7k,t3_eud67c,1580098858.0,"Sweetie, if your depression is really that bad, I'm sure that they have a counselling office on campus. I've attended a college and two universities, and taught at another college, and EVERY SINGLE ONE had on-campus counseling, at no additional cost to the student. You could also speak to your academic advisor about a medical withdrawal if it's that serious.

ETA: I am not being facetious. I recognize that depression is a serious mental illness. My point being that it is not an excuse to commit academic misconduct. If her depression is serious enough that she can't function, then she needs to get help for it, or maybe college is not the place for her to be right now. It would be no different if she had a physical illness."
