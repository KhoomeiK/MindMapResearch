socialanxiety,ffgzvvs,t3_etjuyw,1579919369.0,"Having to deal with a face completely covered in acne from age 8 to age 16 completely destroyed any confidence I had. 

Even though my face much clearer now, (only after using 2 rounds of the strongest acne drug on the market) I still have a ton of scarring left on my face that makes me look ugly, so I still lack confidence. 
So I get what you mean."

LongDistance,ff74dee,t3_eryhhw,1579640879.0,"I had this sort of problem when I first opened up to people about my relationship. I got a lot of comments like ""You met a guy online? That's dangerous! What if he's a pedophile?"" Eventhough I had evidence that proved he wasn't a pedophile or dangerous person, I still got comments like this. 
However the problem subsided once I got pictures of us together in person."

LongDistance,fdwfbfr,t1_fduxx2r,1578758143.0,Dang. That's a lot of driving to do every two weeks. The distance I have with my love is only a little bit shorter than yours. It's approximately 764.5 km. We can only see eachother about three times a year because we only get to see eachother on my school breaks. Plus plane tickets are expensive. We can't drive because he doesn't drive and I don't think my parents would not let me drive that long of distance all on my own.
