- Bank account bonuses do not compete with your stock market portfolio ""at scale"". Bank account bonuses are worthwhile if you consider the time and effort to accomplish the bonus to be worth the return. The answer to this depends on what you make per hour of work, and whether you can simply add more time to your job to make more money. It has nothing to do with the stock market. The only competition there is AVERAGE returns, and bank account bonuses give far higher average returns.

I usually beat them unless they completely outclass me. The way to beat melees as a witch is to always stay at range and always strafe away from them, and save dodges for when they come in close, to create distance.

Once you see them go into an attack animation when they aren't too close, start mashing fireball or thunderbolt. If it lands, and they get staggered or KD'd, follow up with more fireball/thunderbolt. Use meteor on cooldown whenever they aren't pressing you. Meteor is not easy to dodge reliably and if it clips them even once, it gives you a good advantage. 

You can use frigid fog if they're close but facing away, but not when they're pressing you, such as when you've just dodged to the side. Never try to face tank them or use skills when they can stand in your face during your animation, because they're either going to grab you and rape you, or just mash their highest damage skills and out-dps you. Sometimes I'll risk it with meteor because if they go face in response to it, they'll have to accept taking the hit, and meteor will out-damage and KD them. 

Lightning storm is a viable skill if they're pressing you and you're out of dodges, since it gives you super armor and most of the time they'll flee the aoe. 

Magical embrace is too small of an aoe and too situational and too long of an animation. Unless they're KD'd right in front of you, I wouldn't bother. 

Arcane bolts are mostly a waste since in arena, taking away enemy character control is king. You need to focus on skills that stun, KD, or knockback. 

Remember that when the timer runs out, the player who dealt the most damage wins. Healing doesn't appear to matter. So I've had matches where I was at full life and my opponent was at half, but they won because I'd healed their damage. So if your opponent isn't going to play aggressive, all you can do is try to clip them with a stun/kd skill and whale on them in the opening, and then resume the dance and try again."

- it is unfair and fucked up for high level highly experienced players to purposely remove their gear to get matchmade against much newer players. if you're so good, why can't you fight your own kind? you just want to rack up easy wins by exploiting the matchmaker. well, it's a zero sum game, and for you to get your rocks off and have ""fun"", someone else has to suffer being forced into bullshit rigged, unfair matches against you.

- I actually enjoy fighting players at my own natural cp and skill level. I actually started to like arena until tonight. Tonight was a total shitshow of whales sitting at like 2300cp when I'm at 2800 and 1-shotting me. One guy killed me like 7 times in a row. I did outplay him some of the time. I landed more hits than he did some of the time. It did not matter, because his damage was 3-5x mine. So I would have had to have played 3-5x better than him to have a chance at winning. How am I supposed to be 3-5x better than someone who is far more experienced at this game, been playing a lot longer, and who is much higher level?

- Nah, some top players have simply figured out how to game the system, and how to reduce their visible cp while having far, far more power than their visible cp suggests. That guy at 2300 did more damage and took less damage than my character sitting at 2800. I suspect this is because there are a lot of sources of cp that aren't really helpful in winning in the arena, so these players can make sure they zero out the dead weight cp and optimize their useful cp, which probably means stripping everything but attack/defense and some skills. Then the game thinks they are dominating people far higher cp than them, and gives them lots of high end chests. It's called exploiting the game.

Yes, In knew that already. I know how paralysis works.

>That means that when you try to breathe, you literally can't.

Except you can't really ""try"" any more than someone paralyzed in a wheelchair can ""try"" to move their legs. You are imagining a struggle in vain. Nope. No struggle, only peaceful acceptance.

>Fear of choking to death is hardwired into our brain, it goes into full panic mode when CO2 level hits dangerous level

First of all, don't try to talk like you're an expert on a topic you're obviously just speculating out of your ass on. Nobody is choking in this scenario. You have experienced a form of paralysis: your limbs falling asleep. Now imagine that happens to your whole body.

You can't go into ""full panic mode"" because your brain's link to your body is blocked by the tetrodotoxin. There is no way for you to induce a panic response or to feel panic. 

>You spend a couple of minutes in primal abject fear before everything goes dark. No one sees your agony because you can't move. 

- you are not going to feel ""primal abject fear"" or really feel anything at all. 

- you would be physiologically incapable of feeling ""agony"", my whole point. 

dying sucks as a rule, obviously, but when you think about the broad range of ways to die, something like a blue ring octopus bite is on the very low end of how bad it could be. it doesn't take particularly long, and is relatively painless."
todayilearned,fejm399,t1_fejk637,1579179497.0,"> In real life, someone suffocating to death in front of you is pretty horrific.

Suffocation from paralysis isn't inherently ""horrific"". Horror is ""[painful and intense fear, dread, or dismay](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/horror)"". Watching someone get torn apart by wild animals and eaten alive as they scream and thrash around the whole time, that's pretty horrific. Watching someone lie down and just go to sleep then stop breathing isn't horrific at all, it's peaceful."
todayilearned,fejcuxw,t1_fej7vh1,1579167701.0,">It'd be pretty horrific up until you lost consciousness. Then it would just be horrific for the people watching.

bruh ""horrific"" is an inappropriately strong word here. you think a movie where someone calmly and peacefully falls asleep then doesn't wake up is the epitome of horror? get real.

edit: you morons down voting me are sheltered coddled little idiots."
