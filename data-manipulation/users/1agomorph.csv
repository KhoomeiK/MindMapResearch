I know this is probably not what you want to hear, but cutting some length off may help. I recently had quite long hair and took some inches off, and it really put some bounce into my hair again. I didn't realize how weighed-down it was. All the waves I had before on wash day are now curls, I'm even getting some ringlets forming. They go flatter after a few days, but nothing like when I had longer hair. Re-wetting with plain water will always make them perk up again."

When I started working regularly, it really helped though it took a few years for me to find my footing.

Are you working in Japan? If not, how do you spend your days? Do you have sufficient social interaction outside the home?

Have you thought about seeking help? For example, speaking to a therapist so that you don't have to deal with this alone. Are there services like that offered through the military community? Your husband shouldn't be your only support. You could do a Skype therapy session with someone based in France so you can speak your native language.

It sounds very much like you need to connect with other French people, you should make this a priority and see if it calms you. If all else fails, I think you should go back to France, at least for a short time or plan in more return trips, more often. Also, not everyone is cut out to live long-term in Japan, so it's important to consider that this may not be a good match for you."

No, companies like Blackstone buy up rentals originally paid for with state taxes, renovate them superficially (new kitchen and floors, but ignoring actual problems in the building), and then increase rents far above the costs of renovation. Residents often must move out because they can't afford the new rent prices. The company makes huge profits. If they aren't able to remove tenants, they let the buildings fall into disrepair so that people must move. Then they renovate and raise rents.

Awwducational,feevw9v,t3_eoqulm,1579042347.0,"I always found this super interesting in biology. One of the neatest aspects of calicos is their mosaic expression. All female mammals contain cells that have two X chromosomes. In each cell, one of these chromosomes is inactivated while the other is expressed. This occurs at random. It is not visible in humans, but in cats, this can be seen in their patchy fur, where each color originates from a collection of cells which has had one chromosome inactivated. When the cat was just a little clump of cells, those cells divided and so those patches expanded. If the chromosome in the cell carried the allele for black fur, it became a black patch of fur, if orange, it became an orange patch. The orange and black combo is called tortoiseshell, and calico is known as piebalding, which is a lack of pigment that creates white patches. That is controlled by a different locus than the black and orange colors.
