aspergirls,ffgf10y,t3_etfz6z,1579904773.0,Mindfulness practice has helped me be more conscious. There are a heap of apps that train you to do it quite easily
neurodiversity,ffgek9u,t1_ffcqu8r,1579904480.0,"He is probably great for those people but he has just proven he is not great for this concern. You can trust yourself on that. Perhaps he doesn’t understand how this could be related to your current mental health challenges and he would improve with an explanation? Since switching therapists isn’t an option a bit of convincing might get him understanding. It’s not ideal but could be worth trying in your situation.
For me I think I’ve since decided I’ll contact a practice that specialises in ASD and see if they have a therapist I like. I have been seeing my current one for two years and she has been fantastic but this issue is just not within her expertise it seems"
neurodiversity,ffaoqu2,t3_esghef,1579740941.0,Literals had a similar discussion with my psych yesterday and was coming on for a reddit vent. Thanks for articulating my everything.
AutismTranslated,ffaoger,t3_esichc,1579740745.0,"When I was younger I bypassed this vagueness by knowing what the best mask was and answering the questions based on that mask. Simply I would respond as what I thought society wanted me to be, probably I constructed this from an personality of a friend or admired person. Now I put excessive thought into sorting through the mask answers to try to get to what my truth is. Irl I just have no idea who I am so how can I answer those tests accurately?"
WTFwish,ff2h3lu,t3_er1ukf,1579505862.0,Seems abrasive
aspiememes,feww46t,t1_fewplda,1579420405.0,"Bc you don’t have to put energy into the facial expressions. Just your brain and your typing fingers

Edit: omg also eye contact the number one awkward maker"
aspergirls,fefa1mo,t1_feehp0w,1579051714.0,"Oooh yeah I use something like this when I’m working 9-5. I often find it so hard to get back in the zone the next day, so before I go home while I’m still buzzing I write a list of priority items for tomorrow- pretty specific that I know I will get. The next day when I come in bleary eyed and confused I look at my list and do those specific things. I can trust it because I know the zoned in me was giving the instructions. Seriously this saves at least an hour of confusion every morning. By the time I’ve done a bit of work on the list I’m right back in the zone. Seriously this is the first time Ive realised this is an aspie thing!"

cfs,fdmqrx0,t1_fdmqhmp,1578561174.0,"For me more adrenaline makes me feel better in the moment, but I pay for it later in a big way. It seems that healing comes from more rest, even though more rest can make me feel worse in the immediate. Eventually it starts to make me feel better. When I overdo it I get sucked back into the cycle of needing adrenaline to feel ok. Does that make sense?"
cfs,fdmjqur,t3_em55ss,1578552452.0,Yeah I experience this sometimes. I’m not really sure for you but have concluded that for me having less sleep makes me more adrenalised. I feel better than those days where I’ve had more sleep and tend to be less adrenalised. I got to this conclusion from tracking my heart rate across different days and the PEM that comes a few days later.
AusFinance,fdmjdr2,t1_fdmhyzl,1578552052.0,"What kind of consequences would QE have, say if I’m looking to start investing in an EFT this year?"

Anticonsumption,fdm838s,t1_fdm1ftx,1578542127.0,Not really. I have ad blockers and a lot of ads still get through. Especially on my phone. Any suggestions?
Anticonsumption,fdlnjxd,t3_elyu4k,1578528071.0,Would be super nifty to have tips on how to do this across various websites. I’m sure there is an internet wiz that could help us out!

socialanxiety,fcvvqjw,t1_fcvt86x,1578011185.0,"A lot of people on the spectrum have severe social anxiety from countless social errors and rejections. I am sure there are many on this subreddit. Just saying a bit more social leeway for those experiencing social anxiety would be nice amongst employers- an open mind to what different types of people can bring - rather than demanding polished normal mcnormals only. You can't just banish social anxiety from your life overnight, its a process, for some a long one. We can't just be unemployed until then, we need some understanding in the workplace."
