todayilearned,feylyak,t1_feyeinc,1579447380.0,"I have fond memories of a places called “Movie Mall” that got put out of business by blockbuster in my town as a kid, that place has a large room filled with rentals, then two other glass-front spaces in the back, one with a retro looking soda, hotdog, and milkshake counter, the other with a small arcade with tickets and prizes. My mom and dad would let us kids roam free and play games while they browsed for their own movie and chatted, and shared a milkshake."
