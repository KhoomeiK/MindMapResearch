They also acted like I was a bitch when I didn't want to answer or told them it's inappropriate. I know a personal trainer who had the same experience, but with fitness plans. 

Some people are entitled so I don't doubt dietitians have to deal with this too. Maybe not *write me a diet plan* but for sure something along the lines of *omg you're a dietitian is x did healthy, should I take vitamin y* etc."
