facepalm,fdmqyl9,t1_fdlajhg,1578561431.0,"For the most part I agree with you, and i have significantly cut down on animal products in the last 18months. Where wool is concerned its basically waste product and its natural, biodegradable.

we also have to consider the impact of going 100% plant. By that i mean where everything is grown, how it impacts locals. Palm oil for example.

We've done a lot a shitty stuff over the coarse of our existence and that won't ever change, but we can't hold todays people accountable for actions that were made as far back as 10,000 years ago. Everyone should be free to make a choice, but those choices should also be based facts. Not shock media or fake news, which is what my issue is."

On the same lines how do you know the interests of the factory workers that made the device you're using are not violated? How do you know children weren't exploited in making it?

""Fresh water consumption ranged from 204.3 ± 59.1 in the NSW HRZ RAF to 393.8 ± 123.8 L/kg greasy wool in the WA WSZ RAF (Table 8). Fresh water consumption was dominated by losses from the farm water supply system across all regions (77–85%), followed by livestock drinking water (13–22%). Evaporative losses from farm dams were the largest contributor to farm water supply losses. Stress weighted water use was significantly lower than fresh water consumption for all regions, ranging from 6.2 ± 3.0 (NSW HRZ CSF) to 74.6 ± 119.5 L H2O-e/kg greasy wool in the NSW HRZ RAF."""

facepalm,fdh0rvg,t1_fdgzy9i,1578412877.0,"I said on the whole they are treated well. Im under no illusions there are some arseholes. The shearer gets paid per sheep, the farmer needs to recover this cost, sheep aren't like chickens you can't cram them. Even if they rub together for minutes the fleece matts and become virtually worthless so you are losing money on the shearing. Its not like where a chicken is a chicken and it will get you X amount per gram whether its good quality or not. The sliding scale of wool prices makes a huge difference. If you're losing money on the shearing no point keeping the animal.

I do agree with the examples you gave it does seem PR'y but it wasn't intended like that."
facepalm,fdgzzsz,t1_fdgxrnw,1578412382.0,"I don't want to get into an argument about sheep dying. I don't like any animals dying for whatever reason. However they are not anymore bred to have an unnatural amount of wool. There is little selective breeding now apart from colour of the fleece. Some people breed to have the finest wool i get that, but its not harmful to that sheep.

If PETA did their research they would know to target the live sheep that get shipped to the middle east, many of which die enroute, which I have not seen them mentioned for a while. This I do not agree with and will never defend. Thousands of sheep do die during the transit. This needs to stop."
facepalm,fdgye19,t1_fdguore,1578411353.0,"Its not. I worked with a lot of farmers in many, many countries. Some see them as more pets. Most sheep run free in fields and mountains. Theres actually a lot of UK farms that are now using Alpaca to protect the sheep from foxes because they are territorial and aggressive so protect the sheep. It costs a lot of money to get a sheep sheared so they need to recoup that.

Sheep aren't kept like chickens.

I'm not in the industry anymore I have no reason to spout shit."
facepalm,fdgxq0h,t1_fdgxbnx,1578410901.0,Yes litres
facepalm,fdgxoou,t1_fdgx2q2,1578410876.0,"There was a sheep that was in the wild for 6 years and its fleece did continue to grow, however it was a Merino sheep that was mainly bred for Meat. In some breeds the wool does keep growing like that, but they were bred long ago. Like I said its in the farmers interest to keep healthy sheep, shearing is part of this.

Some sheep naturally shed their wool."
facepalm,fdgx76m,t1_fdgv794,1578410541.0,I would say that was semantics. If it was an unnatural amount they would suffer. It wasn't in the breeders (100s of years ago) heads to have them suffer because it yellows the Wool.
facepalm,fdgpl3g,t3_el9n2r,1578404937.0,"This will get buried, I used to be in the Wool Industry, sheep VERY rarely die from heat exhaustion. Wool has a very high specific thermal resistance which means sheep can survive in quite high temperatures. Its true you should shear them once per year, in spring, however they could probably survive 3 - 4 years without shearing. 

Also saying they are now bred for producing an unnatural amount of wool is quite far from the mark. For it to be saleable it needs to be strong and as white as possible, if there is too much wool on the sheep it becomes brittle and weak. In poorer countries the Sheep arent actually bred for the wool, more the milk. Romania  for example.

The amount of research PETA has done into this is laughable. Also on other points from them, the better the Sheep is treat, the more money the farmer will get. So they are actually very well looked after on the whole.

Of course there are cases of cruelty, but these are certainly not the norm, as with anything you get some people who dont have a moral compass, but this will never change, they should be focusing their efforts specifically on these people and not the whole industry. 

Wool itself if natural and biodegradable, we have to shear the sheep, so why not use it? It certainly has a much lower environmental impact than cotton and man made fibres. Cotton uses so much water its mad 8-10,000l per kg."
