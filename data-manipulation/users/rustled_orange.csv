worldnews,ff7bez0,t1_ff75abi,1579645485.0,It's more than sitting at home on Reddit. And that's a fact. Leaving out of your front door to do something is more than not leaving. Sorry mate.
AskReddit,ff0fbpy,t3_equ4vm,1579468313.0,"We both think the mating ritual of the Albatross is hilarious, they clack their beaks together then look up at the sky ridiculously.

Sometimes we rub our noses side to side together like we're clacking beaks and go 'ooooOOOOOoo' like the bird."
gifs,fex788a,t1_feu2lkx,1579425830.0,"Uh... yeah. Horny fans made it the most popular. I don't think you can hear me from your high horse, though. Lemme know when you get down."

felinebehavior,fem6i7a,t1_fekz4vx,1579241486.0,I second this. A tired pet is a good pet.

LifeProTips,fctzm2l,t1_fctybno,1577967243.0,"You can absolutely distract a peer with respect. If they're having a hard time but don't want/need to talk about it, getting their mind off of it is the next best thing."

This looks the closest so far, but not quite. There wasn't as much going on, like the terrain was more plain than that and there were less enemies."
tipofmyjoystick,fco28j6,t1_fcn7m1x,1577822731.0,"I looked and that's not it, it's not a DOS-like game but later than that. Seemed like really early third person flyer."

Maybe just don't call someone you don't know anything. And if someone really has the impulse control of a 4 year old and does it anyway, they *are* the asshole. They have every right to do it, of course. But they're an asshole."
