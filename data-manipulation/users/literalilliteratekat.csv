HuntShowdown,ffgdby3,t3_etauhk,1579903711.0,One time I literally blew myself up by placing an alert mine right underneath myself next to an explosive barrel (trying to get the perfect angle)
slaythespire,ffgbpcg,t1_ffc8rzy,1579902710.0,I had a game where I had ~3-4 biased cognitions in my deck along with a few other focus cards. Since I had power synergies and running lightning I usually spam out all my focus cards and just wait for the enemy to die. Worked pretty well and the chances of you taking ~15 turns to kill them is pretty slim.

HuntShowdown,fffm82h,t3_et7wxg,1579886980.0,"If you think they're so strong run them every game so I can loot it off your body. I like collecting Avtos, currently holding stolen Avtos on 5 of 8 of my hunters."
HuntShowdown,ffflgm0,t3_eta3kf,1579886519.0,Why are people always complaining about Avtos? I have ~300 hours and see 1 maybe every 20-30 games at that. Firing it also more or less draws every hunter in the vicinity to try and kill you.
HuntShowdown,fffl3gq,t1_ffevckz,1579886293.0,Imo Obrez is pretty garbo at longer ranges. My preferred secondary is Uppercut with fanning.
HuntShowdown,ffdiudn,t1_ffd7sl1,1579821788.0,Bullet velocity makes a huge difference considering everyone is playing peek-a-boo in gun fights. It could be the difference between you doming them or them ducking back behind cover. Faster bullet velocity is never a negative imo. Fire and bleed do less than 10 per tick and the sparks literally leaves them at 1 hp.
HuntShowdown,ffd0k3x,t1_ffb66nn,1579811042.0,The only thing Martini has on Sparks is reload speed which is typically pointless with the types of fights you have with these loadouts. Usually it's shoot => pull out sidearm and finish them off. In these cases I will take damage/bullet velocity (significantly higher) any day over a slightly faster reload. The Sparks is just flat out better at longer ranges and its damage makes it so they will die from literally any other source of damage meaning you have a higher chance of straight up 1 shotting them if they took some fall damage or took 1 tick of damage from poison/burn/bleed.

HuntShowdown,ff9nug4,t1_ff7hulv,1579716898.0,If anything inside a building is your best bet to revive people. Assuming you at least run things like fanning for a close option you have chance. Good luck reviving your buddy in the open with 2 enemies hiding in the treeline with rifles.

HuntShowdown,fdih5z2,t3_elaegm,1578442815.0,"I want to but honestly its not very good. Statwise worse than the Caldwell, only benefit having larger clip. Terrible accuracy in fanning and the shotgun is super situational. If they lowered the cost I would consider it but at its current price you might as well run literally anything else."
HuntShowdown,fdigzr3,t3_elerug,1578442700.0,"If you throw 2 lanterns on him it usually takes ~3-4 shots after to kill him. 1 Lantern + 2 full rounds of Nagant will probably do the trick. To passively get clue either have your partner lead him away, kill all his leeches then take clue while he is refilling, or just eat a shot and grab it. He reacts the most when a leech alerts him so sometimes if you just walk up and grab it right in front of him with no leeches around you don't even get hit sometimes."
HuntShowdown,fdigkfc,t3_el946f,1578442422.0,"Regardless you want to ambush players because that is the easiest way to get kills. One of the things people do wrong in the game is not pushing enemies when they have a distinct advantage. Other team has a partner down? Push him as 2. You see them splitting up? Single one out and focus him down. You and last guy left and you land a heavy shot on him? Dont let him retreat and heal, run up and shoot him in the face. Other than that going loud for a while helps gets you into fights and helps you practice not panicking when you are inevitably ambushed. Run through sound traps, shoot hives, etc. This also helps you learn AI detection ranges, behavior, ect. all of which helps you in gunfights."
HuntShowdown,fdig0z7,t3_el6pbk,1578442071.0,"That would be an interesting change in pace for bosses, instead of 1 lumbering big boss have a bunch of smaller fast bosses. I want to fight a bunch of those little Pygmy things from Mummy 2."
HuntShowdown,fdifsyp,t1_fdhq92o,1578441928.0,I dont know why I just suck with it. I land like 80% of my Uppercut/Caldwell Conversion shots but often miss with Dolch point blank...
HuntShowdown,fdifmrr,t1_fdhhrsp,1578441815.0,Imo the Avto is harder to play around. Still doable since they get shit on at range but if you are fighting inside a compound good luck. It is pretty expensive to run though so I dont see many of them. I have 5 or 6 hunters in reserve holding looted Avtos :)
HuntShowdown,fdifb9h,t1_fdi6u15,1578441609.0,If you have a shotgun just hold straight in middle and wait for him to cross it himself. With fanning I typically wait until they're a few steps from melee range then just unload all my bullets at once. If you are out of bullets or have really slow firing guns round a corner and try to counter melee with a knife when he follows. You can also try and run circles around him and hope he misses. Key to all this and really any fight though is to not panic.
HuntShowdown,fdhe95n,t1_fde05r1,1578420799.0,"People bitch about the Dolch way too much. I am pretty sure I have literally looted about 10 times more Dolchs than I have been killed by them. Shit I can afford to buy it but I choose not to because I don't even like using it. It's sights aren't that good and its accuracy is garbage at longer ranges, give me a long rifle any day. Indoors it gets absolutely destroyed by Shotguns, try rounding a corner on a Romero user using Dolch, you literally cannot even get 2 shots in. Its fire rate is significantly slow vs 1 shot type weapons. At the end of the day the most effective loadout with a Dolch is Dolch+Long rifle meaning that your loadout will cost something like 700 to run. Dolch are OP but only in a very specific mid-range environment."
