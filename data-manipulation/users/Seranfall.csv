Yet anyone who is renting will still be paying the same rent as no property owner in their right mind is going to lower rent when they no longer have to pay property tax. With high demand for housing there is simply no reason a property owner would lower rent without a regulation forcing them to do so. Property owners get richer while those who don't own property get shafted.

If you rent you are fucking yourself with what you are proposing."
Boise,ffskdfo,t1_ffs8a6a,1580183861.0,"How does a sales tax help my rent go down? 

The simple fact is my rent will not change if you take away property taxes. I will be paying way more taxes than a property owner would be. I will continue to pay $100+ of my rent towards property taxes that would then not exist and just go into the pocket of the property owner. In addition, I also pay a higher sales tax and you are saying I'm the one being greedy? Are you fucking insane?

Increasing the sales tax to improve schools is fine. Increasing sales tax to make up for the loss of property tax is fucking crazy, unless you force rents to go down by the amount of property tax that is going away which isn't going to happen."

The money that currently comes from property taxes, which I already pay as a renter as part of my rent, will come from sales tax. This is not increasing the amount of funds available for roads.

My rent will remain the same and the landowner will pocket the money they are saving on taxes, while my sales taxes make up the difference. I and other renters end up being the ones paying for your lack of property taxes."
Boise,ffs5tq8,t1_ffs360p,1580173868.0,"Come on you know that is not what is being discussed. We are specifically talking about the tax breaks associate with property ownership. 

I'm not saying property tax is a great thing. This proposal is absolute shit as non-home owners will see little to no benefit while property owners/landlords will pocket the money they are saving on property tax. If you want to get rid of property tax than the benefit of doing so needs to impact those that are ones actually paying the taxes, ie. renters and homeowner/occupiers.

There is no assurance at all nor can their legally be unless new regulations are passed that a renter will see a decrease in rent when the landowner stops paying property taxes.

You cannot raise the sales the tax to make up for property taxes without some regulation forcing owners to pass that onto renter. Otherwise renters get unfairly fucked."

All of which are tax breaks the renter does not get. 

You cannot get rid of property tax by increasing sales tax and it not disproportionately affecting the poor, which is what the original article is saying they want to do. 

There may be plenty of very valid reasons to get rid of property taxes. I'm not arguing against that at all. I'm arguing that by getting the missing money from sales taxes you are hurting the poor and helping the rich. Removing property taxes will not cause rents to go down. Anyone who isn't a property owner will not benefit anywhere near as much as property owners will. Adding additional sales tax to make up for removing property tax just shifts the burden.

Boise,ffr8o10,t1_ffqvvj6,1580152862.0,"> You never answered the question--- How much a year do you pay in sales tax?

I pay probably about $900 or more a year in sales tax. Adding 5% sales tax to the current burden would add another $700 a year in taxes I pay almost doubling my sales tax burden. 

In the meantime my rent would not decrease at all. It may slightly increase less the next year, but due to market pressure I would not see much if any benefit. I would just end up paying way more in sales tax every year. Just like thousands of other people just like me."

Boise,ffqq8yl,t1_ffqq0yj,1580141114.0,"Not at all. I think the property owner will continue to raise rent because demand is high and supply is low.

Boise,ffqpnky,t1_ffqo66m,1580140715.0,"If you are a property owner who rents out the property versus an occupier you also get to deduct a huge amount of things from your taxes like HOA fees, insurance, property management fees etc. Yet you don't see owners passing on those savings to renters do you? 

You seem to forget we live in a capitalistic society. A property owner is going to charge their renters what the market will bare. My rent is going to go up more this year than last year because a new apartment complex went in next door and they charge more. So I'm expecting a $100 increase this year. It has nothing to do with property taxes or cost of maintenance or anything like that. It has everything to do with that fact housing prices are going up and they can make more money by charging more because demand is high. 

If all of the sudden this law went into affect my rent would not decrease. It would continue to go up because housing demand is high in my area. 

The amount of money I spend on day to day items is a much higher percentage of my income than someone who is much richer than I am. Hence the tax would affect me more so. 

Sales taxes in general are considered regressive because they always affect the poor more than any other class.

Without getting some of the GOP to actually look and care about what is going on with our President he will still be in power at the end of this impeachment. I don't have much hope that anyone in the GOP is going to actually do their job. At least up until this point, they have made it clear they refuse to work for the people's best interests."

IdiotsInCars,fe45bb4,t1_fe3xe2d,1578855941.0,I worked with this super religious guy many years back. His wife was just a fucking beast. One day she came and yelled at him in the parking lot in front of the whole company. It was just fucking brutal. He just took and it and then walked inside. It was just so sad. His church has him convinced that he can't leave her and she is just this insane abusive bitch.
