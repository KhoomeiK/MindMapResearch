Liberal,ffxc935,t1_ffe3ctg,1580322188.0,"I think illegal immigration is hard. Not because people want to complicate it, no. I know the law is the law. 

But because there are already tons of undocumented immigrants that have been here for years, and have families (Trump calls ""anchor babies"") that rely on them. 

No one side is completely flawless, but at least if we can come to a compromise I will be happy."

FORTnITE,ffx3yue,t1_ffwkvht,1580317247.0,"Actually I would argue more info is better for builds. Yeah the toxicity sucks from the community part, but in a purely mechanical aspect, it could allow more trap precision, or just remind you of your perks, etc."
FORTnITE,ffx3myv,t1_ffwla8w,1580317046.0,"My issue would be that the ""inspect"" button would probably interfere with other combat/build mechanics. 

Let's say I'm switching traps during a coop build and instead I accidentally switch to an inspect pop up screen. I could see that being annoying. 

Or reloading/crafting/checking map(objectives, backback, or map) during defense. Same issue.

Otherwise not a bad idea."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffvnays,t1_ffvaot1,1580268167.0,"The 'cop' is the independant variable here.

A McDonald's employee can steal food and it will affect nothing. 
A dentist can be bad and pull your tooth out, he will definitely be prosecuted. 
Even a TSA member can be sinister and steal one of your belongings or even delay your flight. Not as bad as death or 20 years in jail.

But a police officer? This is one of the few professions that have an astonishing amount of power and credibility involved so closely to the public every day.  

The vague lines between a justified and unjustified kill is astonishing

The amount of credibility an officer has over you in court is intimidating

Our society's acceptance of the cold, machine-like, according-to-policy treatment of mentally ill, unstable, and otherwise unwell 'suspects' is scary and frankly NPC-like. 
Add to that the cops that have bad intent. 

A ""hive-mind"" is the unity of one belief, and that belief is that we should respect, trust, and blindly cooperate with whatever the officer says. The people of this subreddit question this system on different levels, not always agreeing with each other. That's what makes blue liners the NPCs."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffvjbvy,t1_ffv9x2x,1580265468.0,"Yes cops aren't gassing jews but it's the same genre different day bro. This goes for all military, gov. Officials, and cops. 

When you realize the bigger concept/picture, then you see that the two are paralleles even though one group did different specific actions than the other. 

The argument could be made that under the same police system, step up the cruelty by 10 and you would have Nazi Germany all over again. 

And that's the underlying point to this subreddit. That when you are a cop following orders without any humanity, you inevitably create a system of cruelty and dehumanization where one is a ""follower of orders"" and the other is the victim. 

This is my opinion though"
