mylittlepony,fdpu0qx,t1_fdptlao,1578640446.0,"Well, That is, somewhat, what happened with the Rainbow Power. The problem with that is that it is an example of the lore in the cartoon being a plot-serving mess. And then the cartoon couldn't make it's mind about which was it later.

I like the Elements as magic jewelry, as long it is because they are connected to the girls and work because of their friendship. It's like... When they put those jewels, things get serious. Then you could have Rainbow Power, Elements, and even the Pillars as a past generation.

Suppose the cartoon could have afforded to protect the Elements a bit from this sort of development that passed through the Tree and focused on the fact that they are like a 'badge of office', a symbol of what those ponies represented and what amazing power was their friendship."

It's sad, but particularly in the comics, they became a big stick anyone could grab and beat another over the head with.

I think that their origin bastardized a little the concept. It's like the new characters stole the Mane 6's thunder."
mylittlepony,fdpqhxy,t1_fdpm8oj,1578636671.0,"I have the impression that the guards would require a bit more than a few cameos here and there so that we can see that they are competent. Allow me a comparison. 

While Celestia's job of raising the sun (during season 1 and the first half of season 2) lent a good deal of 'character' to her importance because of several things related to the external coherence of a monarch (or diarch) with the power to control the day and the night for upwards of a millennium. It is easier to make assumptions about her, with what we saw in the cartoon. Not to mention that the cartoon kept Twilight and Celestia at a good distance until it decided that Twilight was going to be a princess too, and Celestia's equal. Before, Celestia was doing something that not-princess Twilight wasn't doing, therefore, both were important in their own areas. Even when Celestia didn't show up, you could say that she was busy doing 'busy princess stuff'.

Doing this with the Royal Guard would be a lot more difficult because there are two things that you can do with them: protect the princesses or protect the citizens/the nation. In the first option, any plot thread that required the Princesses to defend themselves, and thus require the Royal Guards, would end with their failure because the princesses always fail so that the plot can proceed.

In the second option, the cartoon would be forced to deal with the prospect of application of force on behalf of the law or national interests. That could be done in the same way that I mentioned the cartoon did with Celestia, but it would be harder because the situations would require more exposition to be reasonable. For example: Equestria doesn't seem to have a police force. Or a military force to speak of (though the Wonderbolts did show up to protect Ponyville from Spike, they failed). 

Actually, it's funny because the cartoon does show the guards in a military context in the defense of Canterlot, twice, and in that alternate timeline war against King Sombra. But they couldn't ever win because the cartoon was making a point about how powerful the threat was. It's the Worf Effect all over.

If the cartoon had a higher age rating, I could picture, for example, a Royal Guard squad helping the M6 slay a dangerous monster or mess up a few changelings. But, at the same time, I could imagine an entire battalion of them engaging in a battle down a valley while the Princess Tetrarchy fly overhead and ROLFstomp an army.

They are like the Prateorian Guard... All they do is sit pretty in a corner until they need to crack skulls in the name of the Princess because she can't be bothered with it or is in need of protection. Heck, Twilight doesn't even have her own guard and Luna's is even more pointless than Celestia's.

Does that make sense to you? To be honest I feel like I could be doing a better job at expressing this.

EDIT: You know, I don't know about the US military, but Brazil's military has the obligation of providing relief in emergency situations, as well as guaranteeing the maintenance of law and order. For example: when the drainage dam from a mine broke, the army was present within hours with field hospitals and providing supplies and security while the air force provided theater-wide information about the situation and logistics support, in addition to local emergency services that were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the catastrophe. This is 100% something that the Royal Guard could have done, after the fact, in situations like Tirek messing up the town or whatever random disaster occurred. The princesses could be present, not just doing the typical handwaving where they do something so that the plot can focus on Twilight and the others. Instead they could do their damn job as rulers and take command of damage contention along with their soldiers.

mylittlepony,fdpljod,t1_fdpkwy9,1578632004.0,"With that I disagree. The problem with Celestia is more on front that she had a job but she never got to show off being good at it (unlike Luna).

{Piece of Parchment} is a story meant as an introduction to an AU where my intention is to add a feeling of mythology within the universe and a creation myth that has impact in development of the story. It is an alternate universe because it actually started way back in season 2 and I've added elements that I liked of later seasons, and also because I felt the need to change certain rules and details about how things happened to fit a few details of the expanded lore. Most important, it lets me play with any character. For example, Star Swirl will be present in future stories about the past, but he and his friends are not alive in the present, and Equestria is a confederation of all nations in the world.... It will make sense... I promise.

I feel that this sort of stories have a tendency of being long winded and serious, so, I also intended to make it a light-hearted T rated story. Thanks to Chrysalis and her misguided attempts at redemption, it has a bit of dark humor and it revolves around Twilight and Cadance, with their friends figuring out that the past is not exactly what they've been told, but neither is the present.

It has elements of magical technology, a bunch of stupid references that I can't help but like and I also attempt to make a rigid structure of how magic works (mostly because it is important to the story). It has a human-turned-pony male alicorn love interest OC, though, and I know a lot of people don't like those. So, I thought I should mention that but he is intended as an important part of the story to serve as a connection between some ideas from the story and correlations to the real world... It makes sense too, I promise.

Some more context: these two dogs are what is referred to in my state legislation as ""community keeping"". So, technically, they aren't ours. They're ""owned"" (you don't really own an animal, you safeguard it) by the community. Even though they're  vaccinated, given all the appropriate preventive medication for skin and intestine parasites, have their ID chips and registration, they're supposed to be let free, so that they can roam around the neighborhood, unless there is a good reason to keep them inside. Because of that, they just don't accept a leash and people would be a pain if we forced them.

First two walked on a leash because they were insane and the other two roamed around freely because they didn't go very well with the leashes and behaved themselves with other people and animals. What usually happened is that my parents would walk out with the two small dogs and the big ones would follow all the way in the woods and then go back to their doggie houses in the front yard when they came back.

That day, some drughead decided he would mug two elderly and their son with their small dogs using a pointy piece of metal. Guy stabbed me from behind and before I even noticed what had happened, and then the two dogs came out of nowhere and the guy was on the ground screaming like a child with two beasts on top of him.

Holy shit man. There was no screaming, no shouting, no threats. They just saw something wasn't right.
