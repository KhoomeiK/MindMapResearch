Sander's and Bloomberg's political dogmas don't overlap - true - which may make for one really well rounded out administration.

Kennedy and Johnson's political stances didn't overlap much either, but those two started hammering out progress towards the end of segregation and a new era of civil rights.

There's no ""terraforming"" Mars. There's no making it habitable. And the big money (mining) says Mars is a poor bet for income whereas the inner planets have a lot more wealth in store. If a planet could be ""terraformed"" don't you think we should start with Earth before we've completely fucked the planet into a coma? (thank you Deadpool)

The moon first. An underground colony to use as jumping off point. ""Lunar Base"". Whatever. Cheap lifts. Strong solar wind. And an ""expendable"" target to throw payloads at from mining operations in the asteroid belt, the moons of the at least one gas giant, and those heavy mineral concentrations in Venus and Mercury.
