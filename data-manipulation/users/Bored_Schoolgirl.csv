Subliminal,ff3ebmy,t3_eqni00,1579539341.0,"It's not exactly a booster but at the same time it is? The best one that I'm still using to this day is ""exhaulter"" it's the only one in youtube. Just search ""exhaulter subliminal"" or simply exhaulter (by kaguya subliminals) and click on the first result"
AccidentalRenaissance,ff1t8fk,t3_er1uxd,1579485656.0,"I like how the lady at the far left just makes a grand gesture. It's as if she's motioning, ""you seeing this shit? Yeah this is the shit"" while the man at the back in the center of the photo has an expression of ""not this shit again just another day in the office"""

therewasanattempt,fet1ps4,t1_fes0wl0,1579370995.0,"Reminds me of the Time when Twitter blew up with screams of ""appropriating Japanese culture"" when a famous model wore beautiful Japanese kimono for a vogue photoshoot and the Japanese Twittersphere was like ""they're only saying That because they don't want to see Japanese culture in western media. That's white supremacism"""
TrueOffMyChest,femxwx1,t3_epw0va,1579272459.0,"Happened to us but they were subtle about it.

My older sister and her partner fought but this time it lasted way too long and it escalated real bad. Everyone in the house kept to themselves. Mum held my oldest niece and went into her room with her. An old family friend went outside the house with my youngest niece out of fear and the rest of us barricaded in our respective rooms. Eventually my older sister told us to call 911. One of my sisters was outside the room when she made the request so my older sister asked my sister to do it because her partner took her phone. When my sister finally called 911 for my older sister, she could barely speak. She was trembling and when asked by the operator what the emergency was, she said domestic abuse and they have been fighting for about an hour meekly. The operator said OK and we expected someone to come. After another thirty minutes, no one came. Another thirty minutes, still no police officer. Wow. What a let down. They could've just said ""fuck off"" instead of letting us down."

feemagers,fejar9f,t3_ep64qr,1579164556.0,This gave me immense nostalgia. You don't know how much it means to me to see two of the cactuses of my childhood. Thank you for the photo. You brought me back to a trip to memory lane and invoked nostalgia and melancholy.

feemagers,fegt684,t1_fegqk8l,1579101962.0,"I don't really see it as transphobia either and I don't even think it qualifies as dark enough to be called dark humor but I did see this as something humorous until I saw OP down voted the post. I was confused by people calling it transphobia because I don't see it that way. I see this as more of a capitalistic way of milking people for money because gender and political stuff are a hot topic but they 'failed' to deliver by imposing only two genders in their sizes thus the funny face in the meme. Oh well, to each their own."
RBI,fegmhpg,t1_fegb13e,1579097244.0,My thoughts exactly. Always change default passwords. I read somewhere it's ridiculously easy to get into a baby monitor because there are too many people who never change default passwords.
