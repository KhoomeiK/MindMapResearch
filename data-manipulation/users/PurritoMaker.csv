Wanted to make sure I could log food diligently before throwing in new habits. But it is getting to be the walking time.

relationships,fe8jr6m,t1_fe8irst,1578926913.0,"Talking to her fiance is only upsetting the life E is trying to build with him. It'll do nothing but possibly make E single and more available to H if it does split them up. If it doesn't split them, you just gave E and H so much more to talk about when you and H are fighting. Do NOT load that cannon."

This doesn't seem like E is taking over your life and trying to be you. It seems like your husband is trying to dive into E's world and that's the real issue here. Talk to him about his behavior."
relationships,fe8geys,t3_eo4niz,1578925860.0, If you're sharing your feelings and he's STILL around her that's disrespectful. He needs to know what this is doing to you if he doesn't already. I would never subject my husband to feeling the way that you are. This is inappropriate.
