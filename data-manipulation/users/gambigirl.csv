For example, I just purchased a midcentury chandelier from Italy in its original condition and I would not change a thing! The crystals are mismatched and there is even a greenish color to the metal. I left it just as is and have it hanging proudly in my living room. 

I would suggest you browse around on Chairish.com to see if there are any similar pieces and the pricing. I think it’s a really cool piece!

Edit: To me this piece looks French but I’m not an expert."

fragrance,fe5ym3z,t3_ensj1b,1578877847.0,"Yes! I used to wear this and completely forgot about it until your post. I also wore Bijan (and still love it) for what it’s worth.

I haven’t been able to think of a dupe for Victoria, but I recall it was a balsamic rose with sandalwood in the background. 

I just tried an experiment since I have Bijan at hand and love to layer. I layered a touch of Bijan with Intimissimi Romantica (a rose white floral perfume) and it gives me a definite Victoria vibe! I might try it again with a bit of rose oil instead of the perfume to just get the linear rose with the Bijan. 

If I were you, I would experiment with the Bijan base. Maybe try a fruity rose spray over it. Thanks for the trip down memory lane!

Edit: just adding a disclaimer because it’s been a long time since I’ve worn Victoria! I don’t want to lead you down the wrong path, but it has been fun to experiment."

fragrance,fcamy86,t3_egtd8g,1577572448.0,"My obsession (journey) began with 80’s grand dames such as Caroline Herrera in the polka dot box and Red, which was marketed by supermodel Cindy Crawford. My collection soon grew to include Lancome Magie Noire, Bijan, Jovan Musk in the late 80’s/early 90’s, and Lagerfeld Classic for men in the mid-90’s. Once I discovered classic Lagerfeld, I knew I had found my favorite genre. So complex and under appreciated this one is! I highly recommend it for both men and women.

Later, I added Pheromone (created by Marilyn Miglin of the Versace murder connection), YSL Paris, and the original Banana Republic W (so crisp and clean)!

Today I own fragrances expensive and inexpensive, vintage and new, and green and gourmand. My collection includes Hypnotic Poison, Bottega Knot, PH Juniper Sling, Kai, Yves Rocher Comme Une Evidence, vintage Frances Denney Interlude, Hermes Jour, Faubourg, and Monsieur Li, Tommy Girl, and vintage Joy. 

I am continually searching for lost treasures and new concoctions. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with aromatic, unisex fresh scents layered with musk. I haven’t found my signature nor do I wish to ever do so!
