And I know plenty of chubby people who eat well and exercise. For you the problem is just self image but again its a matter of preference. You don't find it attractive and that's all that matters because its you're body."
relationship_advice,fffqrdr,t3_etdye6,1579889763.0,Shes just cranky that's all. Being a mom to an infant takes a toll on both parents but more so on the mom especially with all the stupid hormones. Your not doing anything wrong g shes just stressed and you're unfortunately the target. Just try to calm and respectfully explain to her that it's important to you and that she should take the time to enjoy herself as well.

Cringetopia,ffe6pjl,t3_et142v,1579838155.0," I'm getting tired of people saying things like this. Let's just agree that being fat is gross. Being chubby is ok but theres a certain size you just shouldn't exceed because it's just plainly unhealthy. And before anyone comes at me for saying it I'm fat af myself. It's not easy losing weight but I'm not gonna sit here and defend fat people. All this body positivity is fine for those that are a little thicker but it's really detrimental to those of us who are fat af or obese. Stop making it seem like it's ok because it's not. It's a problem. Now I'm not saying it's ok to be hurtful and bully people for there size but to encourage them to love their bodies is just enabling them to continue with an unhealthy lifestyle. I've been fat my entire life because my mom was fat and my grandmother was fat and I grew up with their lifestyle, now I have to reverse years worth of damage and change habits that were taught to me at a young age. Allowing people to accept obesity will only continue the cycle for future generations because most of the time fat parents raise fat kids. Again it's not easy to lose weight or adapt to a new healthier lifestyle, I still haven't done it successfully so I dont condone fat shaming, but I also dont condone the glorification of obesity."

depression,ffdxib5,t3_eszgz9,1579831380.0,Even if there was nothing wrong that would never happen. Doctors always want to prescribe you something. If you tell them your thumb hurts they'll right a prescription for ibuprofen even thou you could get it yourself at Walgreens. I went to urgent care once to get a doctor's note so o could stay home. Told them I had diareah and just needed a note for work. They did a 30 minute exam and gave me three prescriptions that I never picked up. And chances are if you feel something is wrong or out of place mentally there probably is.

I was self conscious about my looks my entire life, being an overweight minority female is just about the  worst thing you can be but I found  someone who I thought truly loved me, But I realized anyone can find someone, its keeping them that's the hard part.  You're looks at the end of the day don't matter, who you are is really what matters. Because I know from experience that you can find someone unattractive at first but after you get to know them and actually like them as a person you're perception of them changes. So I know theirs just something wrong with who I am that makes everyone run away.

I don't actually know when my dad met her but my earliest memories include her. with that being said my dad's relationship with my stepmom has always been what I saw as ""relationship goals"" while my mom has been basically single until recently. I aspired to have what my dad has and dreaded being my mother. She was a single mother and alone until she was in her  50's. Just the thought of ending up that way terrifies me. Growing up I witnessed the love and comfort and happiness between my dad and my stepmom and i always wanted that. They had their issues but nearly  28 years later and they're still happy together. I, on the other hand, am lonely and severely depressed.

AskReddit,ff04vbt,t3_eqz65r,1579465265.0,I know some may disagree with my point of view but it's just how I see the world. While I dont believe everyone is evil I also dont believe anyone is good. Most hover in a neutral grey area while some are just plainly evil. In reality we are all extremely selfish. Even when we do things for others we are essentially still doing it for ourselves. I wont say there haven't been those who've committed selfless acts but more often then not the intention of a good deed is self gratification and the need to feel like a good person or a hero. For example environmentalists may seem as though they care about the earth when in fact it's their home they are concerned with. If climate change had no effect on humans or human lifestyles how many people would really care. Think of a time when you did something nice for another person what was your motivation? To make the other person happy? When we see someone happy because of our actions we feel a sense of pride and joy. That's the true motivation our own emotions and egos. But again I wont deny the existence of a truly selfless act.
