TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdbbcyw,t3_ekhu49,1578255697.0,"I deleted my Facebook account months ago and it was one of my best decisions - I don't compare my life to other people's anymore and I'm so much happier :) I sometimes miss seeing posts from family members but I make sure to text them more and I'm so much happier chatting to people who matter rather than just seeing their Facebook posts :) 
It was tough but honestly I didn't need it - perhaps if you're a regular poster you could slowly ween yourself away from it. Rather than sharing posts just share pictures to friends/family who matter and get a lovely one-on-one chat :)"
