We text every day and stay in contact in general, he is just laying low and staying quiet as he figures out how he feels in order to not offend or put his feelings on her in a negative way. But is 100% supportive, just not a big talker.  I wouldn't worry to much about it, but make a point of trying to keep him involved."

Turns out he (perp) had been getting aggressively worse and worse.  I put him in jail for breaking probation. But years later he was charged with home invasion and assault. On a woman my age.

Here's my advice, if you aren't sexually attracted to her, then maybe your relationship needs to be re evaluated. Maybe you would be better off as roommates and friends. 

Maybe it's time to see a doctor and have some blood work done. You sound younger to me, and a low libido or sex drive could be medical. Being very low in B12 for example is killer on your sex drive. 

Have you both considered your sexuality? Are there big conversations that need to be had?

Mostly, just be honest with yourself and with her. Some things may be easier than they seem. 

Really hope it works out for you. Good luck."
