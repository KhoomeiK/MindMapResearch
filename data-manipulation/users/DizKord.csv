radiohead,ffihibg,t3_etrqvr,1579974002.0,"Saw a video-ad for some news website and the title said something along the lines of: ""Dave Chappelle Sings at Party"" and it sounded like something I wanted to see so I clicked on it and he was singing Creep. My first thought was ""Wow he's essentially just doing karaoke yet this song still sounds badass"" So I looked up the original on YouTube and really liked it, but didn't listen to any of their other songs. A few weeks later on Reddit I saw a post that said something like ""Radiohead releases new song Spectre"" and I was like ""Oh hey those are the Creep guys"" so I listened to it and realized that I needed to listen to every song they've ever made."

OutOfTheLoop,ffi1sn4,t1_ffhwfsv,1579962537.0,"What a surprise, a dismissal of my comment.

""You're not interested in actually discussing these studies. You just want to dismiss my comments. The person I responded to posted 5 different sources. If I were to respond with substance to 1, people would dismiss it and say there are still 4 more I need to address. If I were to respond to all 5 with substance, then the content of my criticisms would be dismissed. Nobody is ever going to say ""Wow, you're right [u/DizKord](https://www.reddit.com/u/DizKord/), I was wrong and I withdraw from this argument."" This game never ends once you start playing and so I'm not playing at all. Think whatever you want. I've read a lot on this topic and my beliefs are solid.""

I'm the new Nostradamus.

But to be fair, I didn't predict you being so much of a loser as to scroll through this thread replying essays to comments that weren't even responding to you.

You are NEVER going to accept the idea that MTF shouldn't compete with cis women in sports, regardless of whether I write a book explaining why you're wrong or if I just say that you're an idiot and leave.

>Your judgment is clouded by prejudice. 

I couldn't have said it better myself. You're clearly obsessed with this topic, emotionally invested, no logic in sight unless it's copy and pasted. You will continue to dogmatically fight for your side because you want to gain points for your virtuous transgender-supporting liberal community. But let's share a moment of honesty; you chose to fight for 'transgender rights' before you saw a single piece of data. From the start, you've only been trying to corroborate your beliefs, which were inherited from other people who are equally irrational. You aren't interested in truth or science, you're interested in social justice.

I'm not like that. I don't have a team. I just look at evidence from both sides and try to form a conclusion. In this case, I happen to believe that the other side is correct. The overarching logic is strongly against the idea of allowing MTF to compete in cisgender female divisions. Regardless of how effective or ineffective HRT can be in terms of making someone weaker, the idea of sanctioned drug-induced physical weakening of athletes is insane, overly simplified and shouldn't be allowed in sports. My stance is perfectly valid and you can fuck off now."
OutOfTheLoop,ffhd6cy,t1_ffh83no,1579930534.0,"Okay. Fine. I'll dip my toe into the pool if that'll get you to shut up.

The fourth source they listed, which references ""50 individuals who made the transition from MTF with SRS"", is completely worthless in terms of supporting the argument that MTF individuals should be able to compete in cisgender female sports.

**Flawed**: 

* ""Research into the advantage that transgender women possess in athletics is sparse.""
* ""Unfortunately, none of these studies assess performance, and therefore this important assumption could not be verified directly.""
* ""The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) also conceded recently that athletic performance is more complex than a focus on testosterone allows.""

They reference just one insignificant study that actually observes performance in athletes, with eight non-elite participants and no significant results.

The person who linked it probably didn't read any of it.

**Vague**:

* ""loss of muscle mass""
* ""increase in fat mass""
* ""decrease in bone mineral density""

Arbitrary criteria with no specific reference points; completely worthless in terms of practical application in sports, yet the journal immediately puts forth the next quote stated.

**Dishonest**: 

* ""Such findings provide some support for the recent recommendations by the IOC to allow transgender women to compete assuming that “normalizing” the levels of these hormones removes the vast majority of the advantage of having been male.""

Absolute nonsense. The physical differences between males and females are very complex and they should not suggest that even ""some"" support is being provided toward the idea of having MTF compete with cisgender females.

The whole journal is like this.

Flawed, vague and dishonest.

I've looked at each of the references and they range from worthless to obvious.

That's as much as I'm ever going to try on Reddit.

Good enough for you?"
OutOfTheLoop,ffh6rcv,t1_ffh5pmf,1579924677.0,"Firstly, muscle mass and bone density are just two factors out of many. Secondly, you can declare your sources correct if you want, but the reality of the situation is that you just copy and pasted some links that I've already seen before and I happen to think they're complete shit. Thirdly, you've been dancing around my point about the insanity of athletes taking drugs to weaken themselves for the past few comments most likely because you realize how empty your underlying logic is."

OutOfTheLoop,ffh4sgr,t1_ffh3qdo,1579923112.0,"Incredible. You've set up your own mini goal-posts in the middle of the stadium and you're playing your own game separately from what everyone else is playing. A lot of things can make someone weaker. But it's insane to suggest that we should be allowing drug-induced strategic-weakening in sports. How about we inject Jon Jones with poison until he has roughly the same strength as the average 155 pound UFC fighter, so he can fight Khabib Nurmagomedov for the lightweight belt? That's brilliant."
OutOfTheLoop,ffh3h6g,t1_ffh23ap,1579922089.0,"I can't believe there wasn't a pinch of substance in that entire monologue. Because, I'll be honest, it looked intimidating at a glance."

OutOfTheLoop,ffh33la,t1_ffh2exm,1579921799.0,"I've played ""link battles"" a million times in my life and I'm not doing it anymore. How about you rationally explain, in your own words, why taking drugs until you're roughly as weak as you should be to compete fairly should be allowed in sports. Because I feel like that point transcends the rest of this discussion."
OutOfTheLoop,ffh0lns,t1_ffgz7g3,1579919907.0,"Scientists disagree with each other all the time. Studies are frequently invalidated. Just because you google ""tell me why I'm right"" and copy-paste a few links doesn't mean shit. I've looked at those sources and I'm not convinced of anything in particular. Stealing this next sentence from the Transgender hormone therapy (male-to-female) wikipedia page because it's already worded perfectly: **""HRT does not reverse bone changes that have already been established by puberty. Consequently, it does not affect height; the length of the arms, legs, hands, and feet; or the width of the shoulders and rib cage.""** \- These are the things people are concerned about when it comes to MTF individuals competing it sports. And aside from all of that... Taking drugs that weaken you until you're roughly at the strength level you should be at for the division you're competing in, sounds fucking crazy regardless of how effective or ineffective it is."
OutOfTheLoop,ffgxsr8,t1_ffgwbvc,1579917808.0,"I knew someone would likely respond to my comment with the same few links I've seen every time this discussion arises. Which is why I made sure to include the word ""comprehensive"" in there. Didn't seem to work."

OutOfTheLoop,ffglvyl,t1_ffgkri2,1579909262.0,"That would definitely be interesting to see, but I've only heard of one transgender MMA fighter. And hormones aren't magic, there are a lot of physical factors that aren't going to change. At the risk of being offensive to prove a point, there are a lot of transgender women with defined jawlines that reveal their transgender status regardless of how much it's hidden otherwise."
OutOfTheLoop,ffgk6ri,t1_ffgiq7d,1579908116.0,"The physical advantage that a male athlete has over a female athlete of the same weight is tremendous. As a big MMA fan, it's not even funny to think about how horribly the average 125 pound female fighter would lose to the average male 125 pound fighter. The male would probably win 995/1000 times. The gap between two men, at least in the sport of MMA, never reaches that level."
OutOfTheLoop,ffgifi7,t1_ffghnu7,1579906957.0,"Hormones are only one factor. There's also bone density, muscle mass, size of hands and several other things that won't change and play a huge role in sports, specifically MMA where the cost of a fight being unfair is somebody getting beaten up."
JoeRogan,fffmkr2,t1_fffdyao,1579887196.0,"These are short term, small scale battles. The right has grown stronger and stronger in recent years in response to the enthusiastic censorship from the left.

MMA,fffl53i,t1_fff5sr9,1579886321.0,"Remove the word ""just"" and that's a perfectly accurate prediction. McGregor came out on fire in the first round and tried to immediately decapitate Cerrone with a left hand."
MMA,ffdosaa,t1_ffcmifd,1579825426.0,"Definitely awkward but come on, he boxed with McGregor the entire third round of their fight and it was fairly even. Conor was the superior striker but if Khabib can go back and forth with him, he can do it with anyone at 155. How can you call it ""shit"" at that point?"
MMA,ffchpcn,t1_ffc15be,1579799697.0,">Why people care enough to argue this I'll never understand.

I care because there are very few undefeated fighters at the highest level of MMA. I don't give a fuck about Jones personally, but his only loss is complete bullshit and it's a stain on the sport to say that he's been defeated."

There has to be a better way to say what you're trying to say. This type of language may succeed in catching people's attention, but ultimately I think it's language we should avoid. Feels like you're an inch away from directly insulting 99% of the people on this sub."
