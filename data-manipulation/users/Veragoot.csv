But are you really so interested to hear what he has to say that you're willing to support someone like that? Would you watch YouTube videos of Alex Jones if he was the only one making these points?


 I understand that his videos aren't about racism, but if you are racist that personality is going to show in everything in some way. On top of that, by supporting openly racist people, it's basically saying that it's okay to be racist as long as you give us something good to offset it. Do you see the issue there? Ignoring it isn't good enough if we actually want to change our culture to one where racism is stamped out. Racism thrives on ignorance after all. You vote with your views on YouTube, and by watching a racist you are supporting a racist and giving that racist a bigger platform to spread his ideals, either subtly through attitude or explicitly through action. Don't support racists."

YouShouldKnow,fftkne1,t3_ev2bgs,1580223015.0,"Just had to cut out a friend last year that I've had since 2008 because I realized how emotionally abusive our friendship had become. Its been about 7 months since then and I'm already improved. My confidence is growing, and my stress is drastically reduced. I have a void still where the person she used to be, used to fill, but that void is closing little by little. I expect it will be akin to a limit, in that the hole will never truly be refilled, but I am better for having ripped out the cancer that was gestating inside the good memories of her.

OP is doing some good work."
