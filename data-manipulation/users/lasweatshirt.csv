Parenting,fds80ya,t3_emw0ih,1578696447.0,"Don’t blame the baby for things. It will make the 3 year old resent them. Don’t say, be quiet the baby is sleeping. Instead focus on your three your olds actions. Say it is quiet time right now. Dont say, dont hit the baby, say hitting is not nice, use gentle hands. 

Let your 3 year old help even if he does things wrong or ineffeciently. 

I used screen time and special toys and snacks when I needed to forcus on the baby. We all three cuddled on the couch to watch Curious George while baby nursed."

I have no experience with boys, but I’ve heard good things about the boys body book."
Libertarian,fdmk7ko,t1_fdm1sa2,1578552971.0,"This doesn’t make sense. It is more akin to the organ already being transplanted then you killing the person because to take it back. The fetus  is already there and living of the mother. There is not a choice to make whether or not to give your “organ” to support it, the only choice now is to kill it to take your organ back or not."

Libertarian,fdmjbct,t1_fdlzhty,1578551981.0,This makes no sense as you can just take the baby out alive. You have to take it out either way. Killing it first wouldn’t put the mother at less risk.

AskReddit,fddl507,t1_fdcyu1k,1578316450.0,It sucks that Usborne decided to go with this business model since there books are truly great. Even multiple homeschool curriculums and schools use their books (not purchased through “consultants”). They have no need to dupe SAHMs into sales people.

AskReddit,fd02jc7,t1_fcz04h9,1578112689.0,Some people have deeper nerves in their gums than the average person and need the shot in a harder to get to place. This often results in them not being able to get proper anesthetics if the dentist doesn’t know what they are doing.

Parenting,fcxeqs0,t3_ej75k0,1578060994.0,"Every 2-3 hours during the day I make my kids stop what they are doing and bring any thing that is theirs into their rooms. Any thing left out during this time has the potential to get hidden away or thrown away (I have definitely thrown stiff away before, it is not an idle threat.) During that time they also need to put away cereal boxes and other things like that they may have left out. Then 2-3 time a week they have to clean their room before they are allowed to play. This helps out house stay relatively clean. For you kids age I would also give the chores, maybe only on the weekends depending on homework and sports load during the week."
Parenting,fcxe6dx,t3_ejaveh,1578060549.0,"I think it pretty normal for kids to stay home rent free during college. It is even normal for parents to pay for their kids dorm rooms if they aren’t living at home. I would say give them a year after graduation, that way they have time to find a job and maybe save up a few paychecks to have a cushion. Definitely talk to them about how much rent and bills normally are (and average salaries for there desired job) so they are prepared for what they will be paying once  they move out."

I just ask them to take a break from singing because my ears are tired, or if they want to continue they can go play in there room with the door closed. Sometimes I will just turn music on instead and then they sing along with real (whole) songs instead of their own one liner."
Parenting,fcv3p3d,t1_fcu8tum,1577993998.0,Vasectomies can fail. I think they have a 1% failure rate within 5 years. You can do everything right to prevent pregnancy and still get pregnant.

If I use conditioner now it doesn’t make my hair softer or easier to brush, it just makes it look greasy. I’m not sure why exactly. I just ran out of conditioner and washed my hair a couple time without it and it was better/back to how it was before the IUD."

It was nice because we still got our bedtime together, but he was still able to sleep through the night and not be woken up by a baby (and he would take care of the toddler if she happened to wake up. )"
