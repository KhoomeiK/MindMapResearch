AskWomen,ff56wi9,t1_ff5606p,1579581964.0,"I was hoping someone would have advice as well. There were no bugs that I could see, and it was near a other plants that were fine. It had 5 or 6 trunks, one at a time they died off. I thought it was a very healthy happy plant. The leaves from one trunk would go from fine one day to drooping and dropping the next. At first I thought maybe it was normal and natural. But once all the leaves on the trunk had dropped I noticed the trunk itself felt dead. I moved it to get more direct sun, hoping that was the issue, but it happened to each of the other trunks one at a time. 
I have no idea how I could have saved it, or what I did wrong. It was one of my favorites ever, I was hoping to have it for a long time."
