depression,fea982c,t3_eo1usb,1578945860.0,"You are not alone, at least you have a job, my doctors refuse to allow me to work.  You are lucky to have a job, I want to work so bad.  I am on total disability, and I have outrageous medical Bill's that I could never afford, I am talking over $250,000 a year.  Be thankful you have a job, think of how much better you have it, there are always more people who have it much worse than you.  GOD BLESS YOU."
