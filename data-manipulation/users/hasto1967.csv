LOL, oh well :-)"

I just go to Kobo and purchase there. Then load via sync. 

I'm about to google libgen cos I don't know what that is."
kobo,ffe6hs7,t1_ffe5ax8,1579837992.0,"Really, mine wouldn't sync so I went onto da intawebs and the device ID said not supported. Maybe I read it wrong. Anyway, I have a faster biggerer one nopw. :-)"
kobo,ffduwz7,t1_ffdtvsq,1579829538.0,"I'll still keep it. 

But I have bought the upgrade. 

Just saw that you get Kobo on tablet/phone too. 

Hmmm, wonder what the better experience will be. 

I didn't even think of a Kobo app for devices.

Oh well, no remorse :-)"

police,ff5a908,t1_ff4tit8,1579585000.0,"Wow, cool. I didn't even think of LA as a county.
So LA county's other cities like Pasadena, Santa Clarita and Palmdale to name just three would be policed by LAPD and their own city police?
I'm just looking at the example of LA and I have LA County on maps  for better reference.
It's becoming somewhat clearer and I appreciate all the responses.
Thanks."
police,ff4hto4,t3_erksmh,1579563961.0,"""In my state the Sheriffs Departments are mostly relegated to courtroom security and prisoner transport for the county.""

Our Corrections Services will escort prisoners. And I'm pretty sure we don't have armed personnel in our courts, nothing ever happens anyway. I stand to be corrected though.."
police,ff4hfta,t3_erksmh,1579563694.0,"""But you could drive through a single county and cross over a half dozen police departments with different regulations, marked vehicles, report templates, scheduling, etc.""

That's what blows my mind. So many departments, and I assume it would be worse/crowded in the big smoke?
It must get confusing somewhat for the people trying to keep up with differing rules and regs."
