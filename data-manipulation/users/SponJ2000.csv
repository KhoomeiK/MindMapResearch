The film functions as a more realistic take on the origin of Santa Klaus, but the Christmas elements are more secondary to the main story. In a lot of Christmas kid movies you have a theme of ""you just need to _believe_ in Christmas!"" but that's not the case here.

Story-wise, it's about an outsider coming to a town and fixing it while also fixing himself. It's a story you've probably seen before (_The Music Man,_ for example), but it's elevated by a unique premise (that I won't spoil), good characters end writing, and absolutely _gorgeous_ animation.

Definitely worth a watch."

If they had re-written this scenes with Ejiofor in mind, his performance would've been a lot better, imo. For example, a lot of the Timon and Pumbao dialogue was altered and I think that's the best part of the movie (low bar notwithstanding)."

facepalm,fekt92f,t1_fekkj0f,1579207128.0,"I disagree that it makes _more_ sense.

It certainly tells you what the water will do, but nobody cares about the _exact_ freezing point of water in their everyday life. 

Fahrenheit is useful because it's a 0-100 scale of (roughly) ""too cold to go outside"" to ""too hot to go outside."" Right in the middle (50) is where I tell myself to put on a jacket.

And the whole ""isn't 212 F an easy number to remember?"" thing is pointless because, again, for most people the exact boiling point of water is just trivia. If I want boiling water, I'll throw a pot on the stove.

As a STEM graduate, I'm a fan of the metric system and I think that the US should switch. However, I think Celsius is pretty overrated since Kelvin is so much more useful for science and Fahrenheit is better for determining comfort."

Yes, metric, by virtue of the fact that everything is base 10, is an easier to understand system.

However, it's not perfect. By virtue of being a base 10 system, it's great when you need to divide by 2, 5, or 10. And, because we use a decimal system, it's probably the most convenient way to represent measurements. But other systems have their own strengths.

A base 12 system handles dividing things into thirds infinitely better.

A base 16 system is useful when things are mainly divided by 2, which is why it's used in computers."
facepalm,fekqmol,t1_fekdflh,1579205588.0,"Not necessarily.

Fahrenheit is a terrible unit of measurement for science, because it's not based on science. However, it is a pretty useful as a measurement for Human comfort because it basically functions as a 0-100 scale of ""how hot/cold am I?"" 50F also functions as a convenient ""I should wear a jacket"" mark.

You'll rarely use numbers outside of 0-100 because it stops being habitable for humans.

Celsius, while based on physical constants, is less useful as a measure of human comfort because the cutoffs seem more arbitrary. The 0-100 Fahrenheit range is roughly -20-+40 in Centigrade.

And with the prevalence of Kelvin making Celsius fairly useless from a scientific standpoint, Celsius is the 1 part of the metric system that I don't think the US needs to adopt."
