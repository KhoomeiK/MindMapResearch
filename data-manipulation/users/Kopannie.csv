LifeAfterNarcissism,fekzz75,t1_fekfxr8,1579211123.0,"I should mention I have mental health issues that require medication.

In my case(s), I have been fortunate enough to be led to programs like this but always because my mental health became obviously in question.

And sometimes, you have to let the guards fall down, stop being strong, and show you need help.

If there is a psychiatric inpatient facility nearby, they may be able to help guide you to a different level of care."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fejhr8o,t1_feiqumy,1579174810.0,"I've been through a metric butt ton in treatment. I understand intellectually that I'm not at fault, I was a child. I understand this is who my father is. But I have never really addressed this issue directly. My program starts in two hours and I'm already anxious about what I'll have to feel to get through this."

Thanks for caring enough to respond. I have a great support network but still feel very alone today"
bipolar,fdqfezi,t1_fdqdt0k,1578665281.0,"My narcissistic father and I went non contact when he didn't show at my wedding. I was very close to him.

I was managing and then found out that my dog (my heart) is in degenerative heart valve something and is on limited time. After a couple weeks I got ""ok"" with that too.

I had an appointment with my pdoc Wednesday, was going to ask for a med change. But I guess he's in critical condition in the hospital and I don't know when I'll be able to see him. Things are just SO DARK which is not normal for me.

I called the largest provider in the area and I can't get in until April.  I cracked. 

Thankfully there is an actually helpful walk in psychiatric Assesment center here. I went yesterday and they recommended a PHP.  I guess I haven't dealt with things as well as I thought. I prefer to avoid inpatient and PHPs have been very helpful to me before.

I'm also lucky that my bosses love me and once o figure out the paperwork, my job will be safe.

But yeah. Defeated, embarrassed, angry. It just sucks."

Trump may have literally launched the missile here but he will not stop, even if cornered internationally, if the polls show his base agrees with him/his actions.  

He may be a coward but HIS biggest fear is not the loss of American/allies lives - his fear is losing his base and the 2020 elections.

edit to add: I also live within 25 miles of DC. I do not find my concerns meritless, nor do most people I know here."

careerguidance,fd9nr72,t3_ek79ys,1578235793.0,"Went to my university's job fair, literally stumbled into a Manager in Trajning program that prepared me to either do sales of operations in one of their distribution centers.  We had to give final presentations at the end of the program to earn our placements.  Out of left field, I got placed in the home office, accounting department, doing special projects for the credit department.

11 years later, I'm a credit analyst for a government contractor. Not what I planned for my career, but I don't hate it and it pays the Bill's nicely.

Yeah it seems stupid but if you have to scan an ID to deliver something, then that's what you have to do to keep your job.

I worked at a convenience store 15 years ago when I was 18. My high school classmates (who I knew were 18 too) would try to buy cigarettes without ID. I shut them down everytime because it was my job to card everyone under 40. Period."
