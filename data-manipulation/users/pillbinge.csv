If pay increased because of someone else’s salary or due to personal negotiations then all things being equal we wouldn’t need unions in the first place. Teachers with equal experience could shift to new districts and start nearly at the top of the pay scale.

If I claim that I love immigrants, then you might take that at face value and not care. It's the same as the previous claim but you haven't taken issue.

A least-restrictive environment goes from being a classroom to a substantially separate classroom to having a 1-to-1 to being back in a substantially separated classroom with a 1-to-1.

Sometimes it's more than they might get back home. If students present more typically then it's tough.

As for behaviors, our educational civil rights laws were written at a time when people could presume everyone was going to be similar and we'd be able to just expel students like crazy. Behaviors were just ""acting up"". I honestly don't know what to do because these students need more than the school can provide yet the school gets focused on even harder.

I can't speak too much on students in special ed. afterwards because I mainly dealt with students with multiple and severe disabilities. These were students who were far more likely to remain at home or attend day programs. They did very well at these.

But I don't have other answers. It's something I reflect on. We need to give parents more resources and make communities more inclusive regardless. Things can be so bad sometimes that anything, even indirectly, has huge benefits. What we have to ask is what are our schools for? School is more intense these days and kids hate it more and more. I honestly think we need to make high school last a bit longer, maybe by 2 years, but have a ton of other programs alongside everything they do. Vocations, home economics, and so on.

In that vein, we need more people to research and speak up *against* all the hardcore testing we do. It's bad for kids, they hate it, and it's just another way of trying to look like we're failing.

My age group is prone to more suicide than ever before and people are overdosing on drugs daily - many of whom die (though I think the numbers are down).

I could go on.

>But America is a diverse place, and some change is inevitable.

It's become that way through policy, not through natural action. We're often told most things in life are inevitable but they really aren't, especially when we look back and see what was also primed to have been. I'm not wishing we stuck in the 1960s, but that we viewed progress a bit differently and more intently. Otherwise it's just a blanket term used to define nothing in particular.

>Don't be surprised when you feel increasingly out of touch with people and things your read about online or policies being made.

Out of touch means I don't understand or get it. I totally get why people often believe the things they do. I also get why they're massively confused when they can't really build something they want or they keep feeding old ideas that don't work. Someone just asked why I would want more mass murders if diversity could reduce an echo chamber. I mean, genuinely. But that's not how it works either."
Foodforthought,ff486yh,t1_ff3laou,1579557652.0,">Since political leanings are being brought up I am a centrist typically with a leftist utilitarian lean.

Then I'd be far more leftist than you in most ways then, if we have to go with models. I don't care to extrapolate further using titles or terms though since they don't take precedence over actual opinion.

>If it is this easy to prevent yet dangerous and prolific enough to spawn mass shooters why wouldn't you care? 

I've lived in places far less diverse than the aggregate of America and they don't have mass shooters. I've lived in places in Scandinavia that have a higher percentage of people who are native-born than just White people in the US, and barely have minority students. The idea that only diversity will end these things when right now, it's mainly done by White supremacists, doesn't make any sense. Maybe farther in the future but then again we'd just be catching up.

>A bit loaded but I'll summarize.

History and examples are the good kind of loaded. Evidence is typically loaded as well. Throughout your post you make clear stands about religion in school and so on - a lot of things that primarily fit the Western models we've had for a while and are decidedly more identified with the West. You're not really budging on many issues like religion in school or corporeal punishment. That's my point. Talking about echo chambers is vapid because you're just saying things I believe anyway but disagreeing with another conclusion I have. You'd be hard-pressed to really say ""Echo chambers are anti-intellectual"" then read my own beliefs back to me; there's no diversity in that.

The examples of academia are stretching it; Greek and Arabic cultures have had huge sways over culture whether they wanted to or not, and a lot of it was taken fairly recently depending. In fact, these ideas traveled - the people needn't have at the time, and didn't. In this example, it's like saying we can't learn on a global scale despite having the best technology yet for that. Arabic gave us numerals without having to emigrate. We have plenty of inventions that have been traded over hundreds if not thousands of years. None of these prove we therefore need to radically change societies. I don't think Thailand needs to be a bit Whiter just because it'll improve them - if anything that's imperialist mindsets I've tried to avoid myself and contain otherwise.

And I would even support cultures like Japan using their own numbering without letting it die out. We should embrace that type of diversity for sure when we have it.

Point 3 you evaded, but that's fine - these are turning into novels now. No one's addressed my concern there because they're likely not able to.

Point 4 - I'm a teacher. I have two master's degrees in education and I've worked in special education for 17 years. The US has the best trove of educational research in the world by far. Other countries like in Nordic regions have taken some models from us over the past hundred or so years - particularly in special education, where I've worked.

The issue is funding it ourselves and changing how we perceive education. I won't talk about my own views of education but they fit with what most people think: we should teach more functional skills, lower high-stakes testing, and so on. Education needs to be life-long and we should drop the whole ""you need to do this by this date"" model too.

>And while I do agree that religion should not be enforced by schools

Seems like a very solid, narrow, way to approach things that you're not open to changing. That doesn't sound like a diverse opinion. I definitely don't believe in this either.

>This is another very harmful take on diversity. and frankly anti-intellectual and offensive. 

You should ask to sit in on some of my peer's meetings then, or be a mandated reporter, or talk to staff who try to explain cultural differences like these between parents and staff. Never mind that I believe I was clear how White families who haven't immigrated do this too.

I don't know the stats in Europe so feel free to provide them but in the US, drug use is pretty stable across cultures. White, suburban people use them just as much as anyone else, if not more, but it's other people who get the blame. Crime rates are also lower and that's true for Europe as well, typically.

Responses thus far have been on Catholicism, with one user calling it indoctrination. Catholic schools vary. I went to a Catholic school early on and they read us Harry Potter to improve our literacy skills. We celebrated Halloween throughout the whole school and did trick-or-treating. The Catholic school down the street banned Harry Potter and Halloween celebrations, and encouraged parents not to participate. Not all Catholic schools are the same, so hearing about what your kids will get out is meaningless. I would also guess that most of us who graduated from said Catholic school aren't actually practicing Catholics anymore. If anything, the old joke remains true.

""You went to Catholic school, right? Why aren't you a practicing Catholic?""

""Because I went to Catholic school.""

Trust me, that's a banger among those of us who went.

But onto the actual science of the matter:

>From the age of 2 through pre-school, we had him in a daycare that was very well renowned. It had a solid curriculum and taught the kids excellent social and emotional skills.

They taught obedience, most likely, and all of it fleeting. You know what teaches the best social and emotional skills? Just letting your kid out to play with other kids where they have to make up their own rules and deal with it. Genuinely. Teaching *skills* can work, like methods to visualize coping, or talking to adults here and there, but socialization skills come with being a functional human. You can't stop it. Even kids with autism will learn social skills - just not how we think they should, or what we think they should. But they will absolutely learn regardless. They need intervention, but if your kids are typical this is meaningless worrying.

And statistically, none of this matters. The biggest difference is kids' home life. When parents care and provide outside school, kids do well. Maybe school would suck more often but the long-term difference is made at home.

>Although we are in a very modest house and are middle of the road middle class, the majority of the school is lower class.

Your son could likely be the difference for a lot of kids and end up learning more by being an example than not. He can also approach his teachers for work or find ways to access more material if that's important. You could also speak with teachers about your concerns.

I would drop the whole ""we don't want to associate with the lower class and even though I live in the same district, I want to identify with the one next to me"" approach. It doesn't go well coupled with ""we're a Christian family and we talk about Jesus, but we leave out the part about helping or associating with the poor if we can help it.""

Foodforthought,ff31vnx,t1_ff2e05u,1579531492.0,"I'll use the numbered bulletins to address each point. Makes it easier.

1. Echo chambers don't really matter to me. There's this general sense that we have to avoid them but it's about what's being echoed. This isn't salient until you define something but in the end, it's not that big a deal. The US itself is really good at assimilating people to the point that we end up the same anyway.
   1. More specifically, what is it that the West in general needs to hear? Are you open to ideas about diversity itself? What about women's rights? Rights for non-heterosexual people and relationships? Child rearing, education (not the delivery but existence), value of democracy over anything else, and so on? Can you honestly say that after encountering so many people of various backgrounds, you've changed your ideas so drastically? Even in a big category, like maybe converting to a new religion, does that religion offer a different hierarchy? I'll presume you've met Indian people before. Are you open to a caste system or adopting any ideas that are distinctly Indian? Their struggle with recent Modi-Hindu nationalism seems familiar too. Are you open to that? The bottom line is that for the most part, and I do mean most, there's no real issue here.
2. Cultural and personal are subjective. I sort of touched on that. I'm not denying the economic benefits - what I'm asking is, what's the point of better and better economies then? The US is producing more than it ever has. Most countries are. We're better off in some ways, worse off in others. It's somewhat of a stalemate. I don't see any way that improving top companies' performance by having a diverse field means anything to most people who won't be working in those fields or benefiting from their performance in some ultra, taxed beyond 100% at this point way.
3. Education is better than it's ever been, but it still comes down to management. It's more expensive to hire 12 translators for a school than 6, or none. No school would tolerate students spewing hate speech but there's general approval of religious tones that are meaningless to most. Basically like my first point, as long as you don't rock the boat. The DoE is a travesty and has been for some time; funding needs to quadruple, almost. But again, if we're so productive, why isn't that happening?
4. *If so, I agree that any actions taken to harm students, be it mentally, physically or emotionally should not be allowed and preventative measures should be taken.* I'm saying that we've had students come from families, both native and white, or immigrant and non-white, who are fine smacking their kids. Do we allow this? You say we don't, but that's not very inclusive of other view points. Some cultures are fine with it. Some of the kids are fine with it. They'll go on to hit their kids. Many won't. You need to connect this point with my first since you're demonstrating how we're absolutely not open to the idea of corporeal punishment, and that's pretty Western as a whole too. At least for now.

The last two points would beget a whole, different discussion at this point, and I'm already writing a lot.

The same results were found in Britain and this is likely the case in more places. There are actually more women who want 5+ kids (though statistically just five) than women who want 0 kids. That poll includes 5 and 6 or more, and 5 and 6 or more is about double the amount who want no kids. That's more than enough to have people who don't even want kids and still grow.

It's getting there though. No developed nation has a rate about 2.1. We don't know how to get it up there even.
