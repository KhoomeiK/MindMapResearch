Fuck you!!‚Äù

The only other game that made me rage that much for messing up ‚Äúturns‚Äù was Fzero on Gamecube.

Anyway... the difficulty of Battletoads is not comparable to Witcher 3. Battletoads was deliberately made to border on impossible, so that the only way to beat it was to memorize it. That‚Äôs not the case with Witcher 3 or really most of these action hack n slash RPGs. I‚Äôve seen brand new players beat difficult bosses in Dark Souls just because they watched a strategy video on it.

Try ‚Äústrategy watching‚Äù for Battletoads or Ninja Gaiden and you‚Äôll still lose."
