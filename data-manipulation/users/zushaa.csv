Pathfinder_RPG,fenfmhv,t3_eoq6k7,1579283649.0,"I know everyone hates on swashbucklers a lot but I feel like a well built one has good survivability, good damage, decent face capability and overall very good chances for success as a solo. Feel like a caster reasonably should never get out of level 1 without some hired henchmen/other help."
Pathfinder_RPG,fen75ff,t1_femzkbg,1579278448.0,"The fireball travels along a path, its not determined by its relative distance to you but only the distance its traveled. Unseen servant does not however have any path, its something you summon and is then either within range (sphere of 25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) of you or not, unless of course your range sphere somehow extends through the portal.. A cone? A new sphere centered around the ring? With this interpretation the item becomes all kinds of game breaking and should cost 400 000 instead of 40k. These kind of liberal magic interpretations that are not actually spelled out anywhere but only surmised on the fact that the opposite is not cleared up in RAW is the reason magic is so broken in this game."
Pathfinder_RPG,felwdk1,t1_fel3k34,1579232594.0,Yes of course any spell directed through the portal would just be traveling the short distance between you and one of the rings and then from the other ring to the target. The unseen servant however would not be cast through the ring in this manner and would just count as being way out of range unless you plan to be really close by.

Pathfinder_RPG,fefa3s6,t3_eosvty,1579051753.0,"> The group's main complaints with 5e are lack of combat depth (seriously, we lost a player to this) and player options within classes, lacklustre selection of magic items without major home-brewing, poor support for high level play for most of the edition and a general lack of mechanical depth. 

Your group would love the depth of PF1! It's amazing how much you can do with different builds, character options and items etc.. Personally I find PF2 to be kind of lackluster in much the same ways as 5e, there's really not that much you can do wrong(or right) with character building and it takes a lot of the strategy out of it imo"
Futurology,fef6p7p,t3_eouddv,1579049468.0,What in the world does this have to do with r/futurology
geopolitics,fedmma7,t1_fedgijg,1579015227.0,"Hm, feels like we're talking about different things a little bit. Yes the US, if we ignore Trump, has done no real separation from Europe and vice versa. Ever since the second world war Europe and the US has been each others biggest allies and have been enjoying the mutual benefaction from these ties for a long time.

I feel Marshall Plan was more about hindering spread of communism and benefiting from trade than it was about European Integration but fair enough. Should be noted that I was mostly referring to the last years, when Trump has been very vocal about a potential separation from Europe and also being a proponent of things that make Europe as a whole weaker.. Setting a somewhat anti-EU tone on his foreign policy.

Personally I believe Europe should come together more, scrapping some of the overbearing bureaucracy, pooling our resources where possible and working together towards more sustainable living in Europe. While also maintaining good relations with our other allies of course.."

geopolitics,fea9n0k,t1_fe9sazq,1578946001.0,"That's kind of the complete opposite of reality however. Just a quick search through Trumps twitter will result in tons of results mocking European immigration, eagerly encouraging Brexit, shaming NATO members that they should pay up in NATO before establishing a European force and not a single one in support of European integration. 
What exactly are you referring to? And in what way was European integration kick-started by US financing?"
geopolitics,fe5k0tw,t1_fe4vo60,1578870434.0,Not really an argument just presenting that as you say it's just a matter of perspective and confirmation bias!
geopolitics,fe3qv5j,t1_fe1gbdy,1578852004.0,I'm European and would like to see it. Actually most people that are violently opposed to it that  I see are Americans or other non-Europeans. A united Europe would swoop right into a very dominant world power and would thus be a bad thing for everyone except for us.
