Archery tag, food, travelling, etc. It’s like they have a threshold of activities they can accommodate in their entire lives, and they have already reached it while being under 30."

About index score example of 25% most likely to watch a given program. Does this mean the TA is 25% more likely to watch the program than all other audience of the program?"

advertising,ff7mgjh,t1_ff7h589,1579653062.0,"THIS. Thank you for an elaborate and eloquent answer. I worked in a small agency for a while but they didn’t teach anything nor expected anyone to know anything beyond CPM, CPC, click through rate and CPA. I will start looking into the things you mentioned and some stuff I found online (some practice math too). I like that you mentioned looking at avg. metrics by channel. Haven’t considered it before."

learnfrench,fdpgv6w,t1_fdml6x6,1578628285.0,Never thought about it this way. Thanks for this insight! I will be on the lookout to do some listening comprehension.

AskReddit,fdkttc0,t3_elssvy,1578511017.0,"I thought humans had variable number of fingers. I counted 20 on me, and then the same number on a cousin who was my age. It was quite the revelation."
Tinder,fd0g9df,t1_fczp6wv,1578118353.0,"I make an effort, and can talk to reasonable extent while juggling many conversations. After a while it gets too difficult to remember what’s what, plus honestly I don’t have endless time. But by that time I have a fair idea about which conversations are worth continuing."
relationship_advice,fcvp673,t3_eixbx3,1578006964.0,"Both of you are terrible people. It’s surprising that you are cool with abusing a cat- only your way is more acceptable than that of your boyfriend. Please let the cat go to a better home, and keep your pillows and overreactions to yourselves."

AskWomen,fcsxsbf,t3_eiggc2,1577927795.0,"Giving clear instructions. Whether an address, or an activity, or something at work. I don’t like making assumptions what the person might or might not know. I break everything down in logical, easy to follow steps."
aww,fcsvx1j,t1_fcsuai8,1577926463.0,"I agree with you about what it teaches. My point is Muslims are well aware that it teaches kindness towards all creature. But some like to do an a la carte with which teachings they agree with, and want to practice. Some of them pray 5 times, while they lie and cheat and accept bribes. Those are choices they knowingly make despite Islam not preaching those. This unkindness towards dogs is also a choice they make. And those who do not, grab a chair to help an animal in distress."
aww,fcsrhpk,t1_fcsndxy,1577923257.0,A lot of us do.  I almost got kicked out of my apartment because I wouldn’t stop feeding a stray dog with a broken leg and helped keep him inside the building premises. I have friends who would have done the same in a heartbeat.                                Islam has nothing to do with it. It didn’t teach me to be kind. People who are generally kind will do what should be done. Unkind people just use Islam to justify being so.

The set doesnt have to be the same one he had as a child. I would love to figure any sites that sell 90s soviet train toys in general."
