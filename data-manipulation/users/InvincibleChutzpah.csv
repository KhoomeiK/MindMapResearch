puppy101,ffj017j,t1_ffif5a2,1579986960.0,Fluff is going to cover the ribs. You need to feel for them. You should be able to feel the first few. A trim waist is totally normal. Do a quick google search for a healthy dog body shape and you will see that a trim waist is ideal. Like others have said. Most people over feed. We’re used to seeing overweight dogs.
dogs,ffgtv9k,t3_etef21,1579914925.0,"Nah, one night will be fine. I had to let my pup sleep in bed with me on New Years because she was freaking out so badly she was hurting herself in her crate. She went back into her crate just fine the next night. Dogs are creatures of habit. One time won’t derail training."
dogs,ffgt2sf,t1_ffgrn7t,1579914349.0,"Wow. It wasn’t backhanded. I’m being very literal. You asked what you needed to do. Everyone told you you needed to get to a vet now because your dog is very sick. That’s the truth. No one is lying and I’m not trying to guilt trip you.

If you can’t take your dog to the vet tonight, that’s unfortunate because there is literally nothing you can do at home to fix what is happening. If you wait till morning, your dog may not be ok. Do what you want with that information. I understand that not everyone has reliable transportation or enough money for an emergency vet. It sucks, but sometimes that means pets won’t get treatment in time.

I know you want reassurance and an at home fix, but this is serious. You have two options
1) go to the vet
2) hope for the best (ie pray)

I hope to God I’m wrong and your dog is ok. Please give it lots of hugs."
dogs,ffgq11h,t1_ffgpeob,1579912141.0,"Dogs, like people can have allergies to things. Some vaccines contain allergens (eggs in the flu vaccine, for example). In people or animals that don’t know they have an allergy, this can cause a serious reaction. 

Your dog is having a very serious, very dangerous, potentially deadly, and in no way normal reaction to its vaccine. By not bringing it to the vet now, you are absolutely risking it’s well being. It seems like you are ok with that possibility, though. 

I hope the dog gets better. Good luck."
dogs,ffgp96r,t3_etiapz,1579911597.0,"Nope. Just you, Bud."
dogs,ffgp668,t1_ffgnfg3,1579911538.0,There’s not much you can do then. Reddit isn’t the place for medical advice. You need to actually go to a medical professional. I guess you could pray?
dogs,ffc1rl9,t1_ffbut8k,1579789356.0,It takes time to get a stray to trust you. You can’t just tackle it and drag it to the doctor right away. OP only just got close enough to pet it for the first time and it sounds like they are planning on taking it to the vet soon.

AmItheAsshole,ff4fh2b,t1_ff3nc5u,1579562350.0,No... saying “fuck you” when she asks him to please give her a heads up before he uses her card to buy something is a bit much.
AmItheAsshole,ff45a3k,t1_ff44lkc,1579555844.0,"What about making fun of OP for going to see a movie alone and calling her a weirdo? He’s an asshole for that. If he didn’t want to go see Frozen 2 with her, maybe he shouldn’t have been a dick about her wanting to go without him."

As a former AirBnb host, this guy needs to be reported. MOST hosts take their duties seriously. We keep things clean, respect our guests privacy, and do everything we can to make sure our customers are comfortable. This guy makes the rest of us look bad.

OP needs to stop making excuses for him."
Americana,ff0l4jh,t1_ff0jguc,1579469857.0,"It was awful, but he passed very quickly. It was mid song. He paused after the chorus, said “Sorry”, then closed his eyes and that was it. It took a moment for everyone to realize it wasn’t just a dramatic pause. He died doing what he loved, but my heart breaks for his wife. I can’t imagine losing a loved one in a public setting like that."

AmItheAsshole,fedfq62,t1_fecd3op,1579010289.0,"Not really. I have an annual work physical that requires x-rays. I work in construction and they check for silicosis of the lungs.

As others have said, get counseling. 
I will add this though...

If you have ANY suspicion that your wife will love an adopted child less that her bio child, do not, under any circumstances, adopt. I’m adopted as is my sister. We were loved and cared for as if we were blood relations. I have several adopted friends who weren’t so lucky. I know you want to adopt and I’m sorry if that doesn’t work out for you, but please don’t put an innocent child in that position unless both you and your wife are 200% onboard."

puppy101,fdfkz96,t1_fdf4dfm,1578364132.0,"Don’t worry too much. Our pup did the same thing the first time we gave her a bully stick. It’s definitely shocking to hear such a mean growl come out of a tiny adorable puppy. 

We were able to easily train it out of her. She’s more than happy to share now. Sometimes, she even gives me her bones to throw for her.

There’s a lot of good advice here and in the FAQ. With a little work you’ll get through it."

dogs,fcnjogq,t1_fcmgb1a,1577812955.0,"Yes I understand that. I’m disagreeing. The ability to share with a partner would be a selling point for me. It should be in the tag line. Also, it’s kinda the whole shtick. It’s a Tinder style dog search. If both you and your partner swipe right in the same dog it’s a “match”. Without that function, it’s just Petfinder. The tag line should highlight how this app is different from every other pet search, the ability to connect with a partners account IS how it’s different."
dogs,fclyeqi,t1_fclos83,1577759521.0,I like the ability to share with a partner. A lot of our puppy search was done while bored at work. My partner and I would text links to puppies we liked. This app would have given us the ability to search separately and share the same app account with all the pups in one centralized place.

I was  playing sports. I was strong, healthy, and my curves were kickin’."
