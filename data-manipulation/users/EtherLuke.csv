AskReddit,ff4g6l9,t3_erhu3x,1579562831.0,"This reminds of the time something very similar happened to me but I got monkey's pawed hard:

So I was quite young, and was having a dream about walking through a woods with a girl. She wasn't someone I knew in real life or anything, but she was pretty and dream-me had a crush on her. We were just walking, and talking, and then she turned to me and we kissed. And then I woke up.


It wasn't actually morning though and I so badly wanted to go back to that same dream with the girl and the woods so I tried to go back to sleep. I fell asleep again. I had the same dream, I was in the woods. But the girl wasn't there this time. And I just carried on walking through the woods alone this time."
