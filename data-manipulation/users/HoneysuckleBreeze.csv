todayilearned,fcykizt,t1_fcm7vad,1578081674.0,"Sorry, I’m stating that the post specifically seems to be referring to target shooting. The terms accuracy and precision in that context are correct, as per OP’s title and image. I was contrasting that concept from what you are speaking of, the more scientific context. Both are true, but the terms are used differently between these two contexts. Maybe this makes more sense"

entertainment,fc6ilqh,t1_fc6gatj,1577481448.0,"It was never intended to feel like the original trilogy or the prequels, it was pretty evident they were intentionally using a more “western” approach to the story, while tastefully expanding Star Wars Canon. As I say about all movies, sequel, prequel, or no, *look upon it as its own entity, not as a twin of its counterparts*. 

It was a different approach, and you may have not liked it, but you just can’t say it sucks and not provide productive criticism. “iT dIdNt FeEl LiKe Da StAh WaHz” is the issue with criticism these days.

“I enjoyed the last star wars for the production value and acting, but the writing and pacing was horrendous” is a lot better than “it sucks bro”"
