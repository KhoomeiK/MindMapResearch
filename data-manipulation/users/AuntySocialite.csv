The Nourrinou-bibi is a new feeding bottle concept, made of 100% medical silicone.

Designed for weaning kittens and puppies, there are 5 models (small, medium, large, L and XL).
It allows, among other things, to relieve and help the mother in case of long litters and to save a lot of time compared to the use of a conventional baby bottle.

Nourrinou-bibi replaces the classic baby feeding bottle and keeps babies in a natural feeding position and limit false milk roads.”
