Combining atoms makes them more stable and the difference is released as fusion energy (our sun fuses hydrogen, the lightest element).

But there is a countervailing force that makes ever-larger atoms ever-less stable. Fusion stops yielding energy roughly at Iron.

Above Iron fusion costs more energy than it releases so if you split (fission) heavy elements then you get that energy back. That's why we fission super heavy elements like uranium, plutonium, and thorium.

Energetically, matter wants to be Iron. If it's lighter, fuse it to release energy. If it's heavier, fission it to release energy.
