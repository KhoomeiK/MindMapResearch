AskReddit,ffb9opi,t3_esi1iu,1579756408.0,"Circuit City car audio installer. Two management douchebags showed up and tried to pal around with us in the shop. As soon as they left we all put our tools in our cars and helped ourselves to some choose consumables and PPE. We had an all staff meeting next. Everyone found out we were being let go. Not sure about consumer electronics, but the shop was busy and profitable 7 days a week. We had cars in and out from open to close. From cheap stereo installs to expensive alarms and remote starts. Some techs were hacks but 75% of us were doing quality work that we stood behind. I liked it but never got back into it after they went under."

Some guy was commuting on it and wanted to upgrade bikes. I’ve had it up over 14,000 feet and ridden it hard but it just doesn’t die. I just get lucky sometimes.
