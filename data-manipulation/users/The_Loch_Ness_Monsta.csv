I also recently purchased a platform bed frame from HomeDepot.com and was pretty satisfied with the delivery of those pieces too. And then topped it with a futon mattress I bought off of Amazon. For a desk I'd recommend some of the Goodwill's or the other thrift stores, you could easily find a decent desk for cheap that way."

guitarpedals,fffid6f,t1_fffgdst,1579884607.0,"I even opened up the Ammoon ""Silicon Fuzz"" fuzz face clone to see what sort of chips and shit are inside the box and it's all super micro surface mount components, definitely not serviceable by an amateur like myself with no super magnifying lenses to assist me with soldering or whatever, but honestly when I plug the pedals in they still sound pretty good depending on how I stack them together and combine them and such. At this point I'm kinda convinced that pedals are pedals. Whoever makes it the most affordable usually gets my recommendation. However, sometimes people want to have those extra features like tap tempo or like their phaser is capable of weird tuning things with all of these dip switches on the board etc. and that's cool but I don't usually wanna drop 300 bucks on something if I can get the basic effect for cheap."
guitarpedals,fffgghu,t1_fffbex6,1579883424.0,"If I were teaching the kid I would very soon show him how to stack delays and get a sort of ping-pong thing happening with the first one in the chain set to the dotted eighth and the next delay set to about double the timing, also feedback/oscillation on the delays, the gateways to more ambient guitar styles. Using a volume pedal to swell into those echoes, etc."
guitarpedals,fffg028,t1_ffexdbv,1579883144.0,"I've got the Noise Killer gate and the Pearl Tremor phaser and FWIW I actually enjoy using those, they sound perfectly normal compared to my other bigger box pedals that have more recognizable names. I am slowing acquiring enough of these micro-sized pedals that I will eventually be able to assemble a board full of them. I sometimes ponder the weirdness of not being able to put a battery in them but otherwise yeah they're pretty normal pedals."
guitarpedals,ffffa0d,t1_fff1ep0,1579882697.0,I remember my first stratocaster and my dad teaching me how to solder a new output jack in there and helping me quite literally taking the entire guitar apart to learn how all of the pieces fit together. For me it was like taking apart a ballpoint pen and you've got the springs and all of the other pieces that can be combined to make this awesome thing. Taking a stratocaster apart and reassembling it with different pickups was probably the most inspirational and educational thing I did at that age.
guitarpedals,fffez2d,t1_ffeqoy8,1579882506.0,"Speaking of which, anybody who has used the X-Series ""Distortion Factory"" does it actually do a good job of cloning a RAT or a DS-1 etc.?

zoommultistomp,ffagqmj,t3_es6y58,1579735360.0,"Quite likely there is a way of doing that. I have a H1n and an R16 and when I plug the USB cable in I am offered an option to use the device as an audio interface and I just click enter and then it's the input/output for my DAW program (I use Ableton Live and/or Reaper). 

EDIT:Actually reading at the bottom of that link you shared on your text, where it says 'SPECS"" and ""USB"" it says that USB is only able to be used for firmware update? If there's nothing in the manual about using it as an interface then maybe the device is incapable of doing that?"

EatCheapAndHealthy,fek0vg4,t3_ep91of,1579190212.0,"I like to use my rice cooker to start off and I put in regular white rice and season it with chicken soup powder, turmeric (for that restaurant style cheap yellow color), and some garlic powder, something like that. Then after it's ready and I've got yellow colored steamed rice I put it in the freezer while I heat up the wok and get my mise en place ready, I mash some fresh garlic cloves and some ginger and get those minced into a paste, I chop onions, both yellow onion and some green onion and I sometimes add some bean sprouts if I've got those in the fridge. I fry the scrambled eggs with just a dash of soy sauce and sesame oil to flavor them, and the protein that gets put into the mix can be anything, I like ham or some kind of chicken pieces are usually the cheapest options that seem to work easily in the recipe. Remember the rice was in the freezer for just a few minutes, it should be cooled off perfectly now. Ready for a quick toss in a hot wok with some hot oil. And when it's time to put it all together and do the last stirring, then I might add more soy sauce and perhaps a very small dash of roasted sesame oil again. But usually in the restaurants I've noticed my favorite fried rice is usually just onions and meats and perhaps some bean sprouts if they're really trying to make it look legit."
