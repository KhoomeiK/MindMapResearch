ShovelKnight,ffrk6aj,t3_eun50r,1580159697.0,"I don’t think that black knight is Luan. Yes, black knight knew Donovan, but that doesn’t necessarily make him Luan, it just means that specter knight knew him before. Black knight is also much shorter than Luan and we see that Luan never used a shovel blade and was much more acrobatic than black knight. Plus, as others have said, black knight was old friends with shovel knight and shield knight, unlike Luan. Plus, specter knight seems to recognize black knight, but when he promises to protect Reize, he speaks like Luan is dead.

If you ask me, Black Knight is just a knight who was friends with Shovel/Shield Knight and Donovan. He wasn’t there when Donovan tried to take the amulet. Luan fell to his death, same as Donovan. The only difference is that Luan was never asked to serve the enchantress"

AskReddit,fffxoui,t3_etek5d,1579894072.0,"For me, it was that you can’t force your mind to do what you want. You can’t just shove thoughts out of your head and expect them to go away. You need to be gentle with yourself. Shame has a purpose, it’s meant to help us avoid repeating our mistakes, but if you just wallow in it and let it be a constant, then it actually makes it harder to make the changes you want/need. A lot of people seem to just hate on themselves and then wonder why they’re unable to stop doing the things they hate, without realizing that they’re basically trying to train for a marathon by breaking their knees with a lead pipe every day. 

Be gentle with yourself"
AskReddit,ffdqzbl,t3_essttp,1579826809.0,"My first concert. It was my favorite band at the time (Mumford and Sons). My mom has given me the tickets for Christmas, and I went to see them with my parents and one of my brothers. You could feel the energy when you walked in there, which was overwhelming and caught me completely off guard. You could just feel that there were thousands of people there, all of them excited for the exact same thing as you, like their energy was overflowing and washing over you. It was clear that the band could feel it too, that this wasn’t something that you got used to or that you ever stopped loving, that they felt just as overwhelmed by it as I did. 

I remember one song in particular, I Will Wait, it was one of the last ones they played, and I was absolutely fucking loving it. Everyone was stomping their feet and clapping along to the music, and I remember I was positively bouncing with excitement. Like, I went from stomping my feet, to literally jumping up and down to the beat as I clapped to the beat and shouted along with them. 

I don’t remember it as well as I wish I could, but it was an amazing experience that I seriously loved. 


Also, before the band even came out, everyone was laughing and cheering for [this one guy](https://imgur.com/a/nrdc9zv), and the lead singer actually mentioned it during the show."

Basically, the positive things I tried to force myself to hear ended up just becoming like the intrusive thoughts I was trying to get rid of (like, the words were different but they felt the exact same).

There is something that I think is more important than using reasonable sentences though, which is that you have to be gentle with how you treat yourself. It doesn’t matter what you’re telling yourself, if you’re using it to try and push something out of your head, it won’t work. You have to let it be more of a gentle thing, without being forceful or aggressive about it at all."

pics,fei8qfu,t1_fehtr2y,1579132792.0,"Yep it is. I’m a Christian, and I can honestly tell you that a lot of the Bible is really about love and forgiveness. At one point in the New Testament, Jesus was asked what the most important commandments were. He said that number 1 was to love God, but that the second most important rule to live by was to love ones neighbor as oneself. 

As other people have also pointed out, Jesus also spent a lot of time with sinners. There’s a story in the Bible about how he chose to spend the night in the home of a tax collector (back then, tax collectors were pretty much thieves who took a lot off the top), and he simply ate with the man and spent time with him. 

Another time, he and his disciples found a crowd of people who were about to stone a prostitute to death, since prostitution would be considered a sin. He immediately stepped through to the center of the crowd and told them “let he who is without sin cast the first stone,” refusing to allow them to kill her. 

There’s also the Good Samaritan, of course, which is about the value of compassion, and talks about how love is more important than any societal issue. 

The Bible is very explicit that you should try to be kind, accepting, loving, and forgiving. Jesus spent his whole life going around and talking to people who were considered sinners and outcasts, yet he always treated them with respect and forgiveness. Christians are supposed to strive to do the same"

AskReddit,fdeb122,t3_ekw3he,1578335102.0,"I used to struggle a lot with them, like really struggle. I even went to therapy because of them. 

The trick is, just to let them be. Don’t try to get rid of them, don’t focus on them, and definitely don’t try to fight them. They don’t really mean anything, no matter what they are. No matter how random, or strange, or violent, or disturbing, they literally mean absolutely nothing. They’re basically like your brain making a sentence by spamming the same button on autocorrect. The only reason they keep popping up/bothering you, is because if you get freaked out or hyper focused on them, you’re basically making the thought seem like it’s important in some way, which tells your brain to remember it and repeat it. 

It’s even worse if you try to actively fight against the thought or force it out of your head. You’re still just marking the thought as urgent, but you’re also trying to fight your own mind, which just sucks. I did this all the time, and it made the intrusive thoughts feel so much worse; I literally needed therapy because of it.

The trick is, just let the thought pass by. Don’t try to fight it, don’t focus on it, just let it pass. Don’t focus on it, but *don’t* try to force yourself not to focus on it. What you want to do, is to stop making your brain think that the thought is super important, so that you’ll stop being constantly reminded of it. It will start to come back less and less often over time. You might still have it every once in a while, but it will be a lot easier to deal with if you see it as just a random unimportant thing. 

If you struggle to do this, don’t worry, I did too. The main thing to remember is that when you try this, it shouldn’t feel like something that takes a lot of mental effort, and it shouldn’t ever feel like you’re trying to force yourself to do something. This should be very relaxed, without any self judgement. 

You might also want to try a meditation app like headspace, it will help you get the idea of how to let thoughts drift by without judging yourself, and was something I practiced with my therapist when I was learning to deal with them."

WritingPrompts,fcwefy1,t3_eizqpn,1578023543.0,"It had been an accident the first time I did it. I had tried meditation out of curiosity and found that I loved the feeling. Few months later, I was in my dorm, sitting on my bed and practicing, it felt deeper than it ever had, when I was suddenly able to see the room around me. At first, I thought that I had accidentally opened my eyes, but then I turned around and saw my body sitting behind me. The shock nearly pulled me back; I saw the room fade to black around me, and felt the weight of gravity slowly returning, but I managed to stay out there. It felt amazing, I was able to float around effortlessly, and there was this overwhelming calmness. When I was out of my body, I was able to move around and see, but felt like I was still meditating. 

The next day, I tried to do it again, I tried every chance I got. I was worried that I’d never reach that state again, but after a week or so, I could leave my body consistently. 

I couldn’t move more than a few feet away at first, it was like I was chained to it, and I would always get pulled back after a few minutes. Now, I can go anywhere, cross the oceans in a second, be on the other side of the world, and I can stay there for as long as I want. 

I was in the desert, looking down over the dunes from above the clouds, diving down to just over the sand, sticking out my spectral hand and feeling the coarse grains brushing it as I drifted by. I explored here for a long time, and soon the sun was beginning to set. 

I watched the sky change color, floating just over the ground. 

“You shouldn’t be here.” 

The voice came from behind, startling me. I turned around and saw an old man standing there, looking straight at me. He had a long grayish white beard, and medium blue eyes that stood out brilliantly against the dessert.

“You can see me?” I asked, half expecting the surprise to yank me back to my body. 

“Yes I can see you. Anyone whose left their body before can see other people’s spirits. I shouldn’t be seeing you here though, because you shouldn’t be here.”

The old man’s voice was somewhat strict, with the tone of authority, but it wasn’t angry, not at me. 

“You mean, there are others who can leave their bodies? I always assumed that I was the only one.” 

“Bah! People have been doing this since before history. There have been thousands who discovered what you have, who elated in the feeling of an unbound spirit. I learned how when I was a young man, not much older than you,” his tone softened slightly as he added on, “before I knew what I was really risking.”

“Wait, what you were risking? But there’s no way anything can hurt me like this, after all, my body isn’t here, just my soul.” 

“Your body not being here is exactly why you shouldn’t be. Are you even on the same continent as it?”

“No, I’m not.”

“That’s what i thought,” the old man reached a hand through the air in front of me, and suddenly there was a thin trail of light floating through the air and connecting to the center of my back. It looked kinda like the northern lights, but was slightly thinner than my pinkie. 

“Do you remember,” the old man asked, “when you first left your body, how you could barely move a foot? Your soul is bound to your body by a thick chain, one that’s only supposed to be cut by the reaper’s scythe. But, the problem is, that chain can strain, it can warp and stretch, weakening until it snaps.” 

He gestured at the trail, “I think you can see how thin your link has gotten. I’ve seen it before, in this same desert. My brother and I came here to see the dunes. We didn’t know about the chain. Do you know what happens if it’s broken? Your body never wakes up, it withers and dies.” 


“W-what happens, to me.. to my soul?

“Your soul is left to wander, just like you do now. Except you won’t be able to snap back to your body. You’re left unable to be seen by almost everyone, unable to affect the world around you. You wander year after year, decade after decade, century after century.” 

The air behind the old man began to shimmer. It formed into a spectral mass that looked like the aurora borealis, and I noticed that it was around the size of a person. The old man’s voice began to catch, and a tear formed in his eye. “I watched as my brother’s soul was worn down... as he forgot himself. You shouldn’t be here. Go, now.” 

I wasn’t sure, but I thought that I saw a faint smile on his lips, as I pulled myself back."
