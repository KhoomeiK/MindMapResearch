Work the balm between your hands until it's warm (ideally just after showering) then follow with the oil. Keeps it moist and healthy, helps with shaping. I often get compliments on how my beard looks."

malegrooming,ffniuoc,t3_euar1p,1580066482.0,"I think it looked nicer in the previous post, but if this is your first time growing a beard, I encourage you to keep growing it out and see what happens. There's no reason not to experiment. You look pretty young, so I assume you still have a lot of time for coverage to come in; if your cheeks were a little more covered you'd have a great beard already."

You can find people who do therapeutic applications of both without interference from the government. MAPS also takes signups for psychedelic intervention, but it's a crapshoot as to who can get in.

I went to college with Zazie (she was a year above me) and was good friends with her best friend and roommate, so we know each other reasonably well. She makes, hands down, the best eye contact of anyone I have ever met. I've never seen her speak to a person without giving them 110% of her attention; it'd be unnerving on someone less pleasant, but instead it's just a nice change of pace from people who wait for their turn to talk. She's a lovely individual, definitely deserves her success."

I've done two courses of ECT in the last five years and it has changed my entire life. I went from deeply, deeply depressed all the time (I'm Bipolar II) to depression-free. There are so many options beyond SSRIs and lifestyle changes (including newer-generation MAOIs like moclobemide, which you can get from a place like northwest pharmacy in Canada and have fewer side effects than older generations) that the idea that depression is a lifetime illness simply isn't true for more individuals than ever before in history. Happy to answer any questions about ECT anybody has; it's a very misunderstood therapy."
malefashionadvice,ffj75j5,t3_ettb6m,1579992079.0,"Hey folks,

I've been lurking here on and off for a while, and have decided after some recent life events that I want to start taking more active care of my appearance. I tried the everyday uniform silicon valley thing for a while, but I'm craving more variety. Most interested in workwear and the sort of ""rugged ivy"" tweed blazer kind of thing.

Starter question: what type of jean is best for a tucked in button down? The ones I wear (and a lot of the ones I find online) are somewhat low-rise, which Put This On says is not ideal. Currently I only own black jeans and am interested in trying out selvedge, since all my footwear are boots. Can anyone recommend a (potentially selvedge) black jean that works with a button down tucked in? Would wear with a blazer.

Similarly, I am a bit overweight (have lost a lot of weight over the past few years, but have about 40 pounds to go to my goal weight). What sort of fit should I be looking for in a dress shirt in order not to accentuate my size?

Thanks in advance."

malefashionadvice,ffcgft0,t3_esoqem,1579798918.0,"I took a kintsugi class a couple years ago; if you're in NYC, a guy named Gen offers them out of his studio. If I remember correct, the layer of gold in kintsugi is laid down on top of a unique reddish lacquer called Urushi. It's weird stuff. You have to wear gloves as a novice, because in its raw state it will give you a rash, but veterans lacquermakers build up an immunity. It doesn't actually ""dry"" into solidity; you place it in a sealed box or bin with wet towels, and the moisture hardens the lacquer; no idea why.

Kintsugi's pretty easy to do, if you're patient — it takes several weeks to go through the whole process for one piece — and you end up with a neat, beautiful (although I think not necessarily food-safe) result. I recommend anyone near a studio that offers classes try it out."

movies,feerbst,t1_fea0wi6,1579039551.0,"Every time somebody mentions Jennifer Lawrence, I think of the same quote by James Baldwin, in his speech The Artist’s Struggle for Integrity (I’m on mobile, but you can find both the full speech and a phenomenal excerpt on YouTube, and if you’re creative I highly recommend that you do). I’m paraphrasing, but it goes something like:

“People ask you what you do, and you say, a little sheepishly, ‘Well, I write.’ And they say, ‘But what do you DO?’ And then time goes on, you have a little success, and people stop asking you, ‘what do you do?’ And they start asking, ‘Won’t you do this?’ And you have to decide whether you want to be famous, or whether you want to write.”

You see this all the time. Incredibly talented actors like Lawrence, who definitely earned the spotlight in Winter’s Bone, or Leo, who was great early but hasn’t been anything other than recognizable and enthusiastic since What’s Eating Gilbert Grape, have some deserved initial success and immediately get swept up into the Hollywood machine where they never do anything interesting again. They’ll do “prestige” pictures like American Hustle (which is a movie that not once justifies its existence) or The Revenant, but everything they do is focus grouped to death and fits into their “star” niche. Even Helen Mirren turns down roles that are “too provocative,” e.g. about race and gender. 

I honestly can’t say I blame them. Who hasn’t fantasized about being a movie star? And I bet, when the spotlight is on you, it’s very hard to notice that it’s happening. To be lucky enough to make a living as an actor, let alone an actor who wins an academy award before she’s thirty, must come with such a fucking head rush of gratitude and fear that I think it’s probably impossible to come out of it well-adjusted. The “I’ll never work again” anxiety is probably very real for every actor, regardless of stature, especially for women. But when people wonder “so-and-so (almost always a woman) is such a star, but she does nothing for me. What’s the big deal?” It’s usually a case of a person who has tremendous acting ability, showed it early, and then got sucked into being famous."

Instead of focusing on how you judge yourself to be bad at hugging, direct your focus to your care for the person in front of you.
