And my brother always called me ""dumbass"", and treated me as such. So a sense of self-esteem is not innate in me.

At times I have imposter syndrome, and wonder if today is the day the life I built up will fall apart. In a lot of ways I've learned to just go through the motions. I graduated high school and college with decent grades. I'm good enough at my job to feel that I meaningfully contribute.

I can't picture a skinny me because I've never seen it. But I know I can go through the motions of the Snake Diet because I've been successful in other areas of my life where succeeding meant just sticking with a routine or agenda for a long enough amount of time.

I know that eating the way that got me fat and unhealthy isn't good for me. It doesn't make me meaningfully happy, and it will hurt me and my family dearly in the long run if I don't change. I know that fasting is healthy and critical to fixing my prediabetes and hypertension. So whether I get skinny or not - I should stick with the Snake Diet because logically it makes sense; in ways it gets easier the more I do it; and if I stick with it long enough I'll have a body I can be proud of (just like sticking with college long enough to earn a degree).

Fasting is different because when you stop eating entirely, insulin goes down as low as it can go. Fat is allowed to come out of fat cells, and the body senses high energy-availability - which means that it can maintain or even increase metabolism."

Water weight is the weight you lose when you've depleted your glycogen stores. Each molecule of glucose is bound to 4 molecules of water in the body. On numerous occasions I have gotten that water ""whoosh"" effect from depleting my glycogen.

On some of my dry fasting days I am already glycogen-depleted. And even then, I lose weight two to three times faster than water fasting. The common theory is that you burn fat faster during dry fasting because your body needs the ""water"" from fat more than it needs the calories from fat.

There are some common symptoms of dehydration - dark yellow pee, skin elasticity goes down, headache, etc - most of the times I don't have these issues when dry fasting (if I've taken sufficient electrolytes in the days leading up to a fast) - so I don't believe that I'm dehydrated in any conventional sense.

Fat is long chains of carbon combined with hydrogen. Water is oxygen bonded with hydrogen. The air we breath has abundant oxygen.

When we ""burn"" fat, the long chains of carbon in fat are broken down, and the molecules of hydrogen in that fat are combined with oxygen instead. The oxygen comes from the air we breath. This process creates water inside our cells, which is used to hydrate us.

It's lighter to carry fat for water than to carry water for water. As long as you don't lose water faster than your body can create it, and as long as you have enough fat, you can go a while without water.

People do ""dry fasting"" where they don't eat or drink for a period of time. A number of people have made it to 7 days without eating or drinking and have reported that they've lost much more weight/fat than from the same period of ""water fasting"" (where they drink but don't eat).

Two co-workers and I did this last year, and we won from $500-$1500 because we all made weight.


Cole recently says to eat until you're full on your refers days because that's better for your hormones. No calorie limit, but don't go too bonkers if you're trying to lose a lot of weight.

Edit: when I was losing my weight I was walking up to 13 miles a day, though I started with 2-3 miles a day. And some days I was so worn out from the previous day's walk that I skipped it. So listen to your body - push yourself gently but don't break yourself. On the scale, I found being in a sauna for an hour was the same amount of weight loss as walking 10 miles - but walking 10 miles was easier and more enjoyable."

carnivore,ff8roz8,t3_es5vpw,1579693411.0,"There's a theory that the high amount of poly-unsaturated fat in our diet is a leading cause of chronic inflammation in our bodies. Mammals don't make PUFA themselves, but get it from their diet.

Pigs and chickens are generally fed a diet high in PUFA from the plant foods they eat - which are frequently the leftover by-products of making things like ""vegetable"" oils.

Cows eat mostly grass for most of their life, and spend the last few months of their lives in a feedlot eating grains and maybe some vegetable oil by-products. So cows have a much lower ratio of PUFA than pigs and chickens.
