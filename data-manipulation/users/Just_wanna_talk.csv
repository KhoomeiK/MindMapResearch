That is 100% the fault of the nurse and she would probably be the one to get into trouble by reporting it, as she would bring to their attention that she got undressed in a public space while working which is no bueno."

I know it's super cute but it can be very damaging towards the wildlife as well as not be very safe for your child.

Baby deer and especially concerning, because they can imprint easily on humans and lose their fear quickly as a fawn. This means when they grow up they will be in people's gardens eating flowers and shrubs, approaching people for food and potentially getting aggressive when not given food. Although cute now this deer will grow up to be a potentially very dangerous animal.

Not only that, but deer are tick vectors and can be riddled with ticks, do not expose your child to potential Lyme disease."

aww,fdhs2m4,t1_fdhkyl7,1578429083.0,"I haven't personally looked into the actual costs of tagging and tracking the animals, in sure it has gotten much cheaper over the years. It's simply hard enough to get the funding needed just to rehab the animals to the point of release let alone any extra expenses to monitor them afterwards. 

Some animals are housed in our hospital for >6 months at a time depending on their injuries and the time of year they come in. The feed and the medications usually take up a lot of the funding."
aww,fdhrq7t,t1_fdhixpa,1578428884.0,"When you are looking at the majority of your animals being less than 100g (bats, nestling songbirds, snakes, etc) and factor in that we can take in around 300-500 animals per year who each take an average of $50-$100 to rehab, another $20+ per animal with already limited funding available is quite prohibitive. Personally I haven't looked into the actual costs of tagging and tracking the animals  but any extra expense is already hard enough."

aww,fdh64dc,t1_fdh549s,1578416192.0,"Survival rates can vary widely depending on the species released and method of tracking. My wildlife rehabilitation don't do much tracking because the most affordable way to track is tags, but then it is extremely rare to get a report back on the animal because it would have to die, be found with tag intact, someone would have to know and care enough to report it, etc.

Also tags can interfere with wildlife and only be appropriate for certain animals. Can't easily tag a snake, or a humming bird where the tag will weigh a quarter of its body weight. 

GPS tracking would be the most accurate but it's prohibitively expensive and you often don't get the equipment back if you, say, chip of collar something and it gets eaten by another animal or dies in a lake or ocean. 


Most of the time it's just experience and skill in knowing the health of an animal is as good as it's going to get and keeping them cooped up in a hospital would do more harm than good that you release them, and you never know for sure if they survive 1 month or 10 years."
