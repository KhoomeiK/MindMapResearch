suggestmeabook,ff5euxa,t3_ergpuo,1579589858.0,The Stormcaller series by Tom Lloyd as long as you're cool with a good dragon.
suggestmeabook,ff5dp3a,t3_erokai,1579588553.0,Look up the sagas. The myths and stories of the Vikings written by a viking and the tail end of the viking age. They were penned by Snorri Sturlson I think.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ff2fogz,t1_ff1xss2,1579504156.0,I gave him the benefit of the doubt and kept telling myself it was an Adicts tattoo but deep down I knew the truth.
justneckbeardthings,ff1ldyi,t3_eo3tok,1579481070.0,That's how I feel about the water brands in the video. Fuck Nestle.
SuddenlyGay,fess7az,t3_eqf9x0,1579368473.0,From my point of view a dick is just a big clit so chicks suckin' dick is lesbian. Checkmate women.
Bossfight,fesorcv,t3_eqd5xv,1579367502.0,"Completely staged, no lube for the dildos and butt plugs."
curlyhair,fej764v,t3_epbcr4,1579159733.0,You're not a waste of a good breath. You're a good breath well spent and don't you ever forget it.
shittymoviedetails,feibwu6,t1_fei5169,1579134900.0,Cross post it. It's yours to keep.

MonsterHunterWorld,fe0krln,t1_fdzvia3,1578815154.0,Whenever I do cool stuff like that everyone is carting or just not looking.
dndmemes,fe0kai9,t3_eney9v,1578814875.0,I have nothing against a rogue stealing from the party early on but there needs to be a character arch. Today's scumbag is tomorrow's hero.
Gamingcirclejerk,fdx3acz,t3_en5lii,1578764850.0,"Ironically, she has already attracted a mate. This guy on the other hand..."
AskReddit,fdmj1fn,t3_elztep,1578551688.0,Probably a bottle of Bulleit bourbon.
tifu,fdjfsvf,t1_fdh6suw,1578468948.0,"Strut behind her to the front like Bender. ""We love you anon"" they'll yell. ""Shut up baby I know it"" you'll reply."
tifu,fdjfi95,t1_fdhlwa1,1578468602.0,I had an opposite experience. I was looking for some help and the woman was not willing to talk about that kind of stuff. If you're not comfortable there work somewhere else.
LARP,fdiwy5q,t1_fdikkd8,1578452921.0,That's good. He'll have an arming cap to go with it so that should help a lot.
LARP,fdhef5a,t1_fdhe28a,1578420895.0,"Probably faux historical, like History channel's Vikings. I know it's fake and he knows it's fake but it looks cool and a stray headshot won't cave his head in."
LARP,fdhdrs5,t1_fdhc4or,1578420555.0,Viking but black. The black chainmail was cheaper then the unfinished mild steel chainmail on Kult of Athena years back and now he's stuck with it.
LARP,fdh9fvy,t1_fdguxb1,1578418250.0,In Dagorhir head shots are illegal except for ranged attacks but you still catch a hit to the head every now and again. Most Dag fighters use leather which may have to be my second choice. We can't use foam armor. Leather or metal only.
LARP,fdg6s1h,t3_ehyiaf,1578382333.0,"Hey bud, I'm an old Dag fighter currently still active in Indiana. If you're interested I could get you in touch with someone from about anywhere in the state. Dagorhir may not be your choice but we have a good bit of crossover and intermingling so if you're interested I could get in touch with the Indianapolis or Fort Wayne chapters and they could probably help you find who you need. And if your in my area and you're interested in dag, I feel bad for you. We had to disband."
LARP,fdg6k1s,t3_eikvta,1578382070.0,Pretty much any shoes can be comfortable if you get some good hiking socks and some insoles. Break the insoles in around the house and practices before heading to an event but new socks are best.
skyrim,fd0l1a1,t3_ejn94x,1578120351.0,"You think that's great, try giving a follower a pickaxe and commanding them to do it for you."
suggestmeabook,fcy4uv6,t3_ejfcji,1578074816.0,"The Stormcaller series is really unique but with all the current hype, The Witcher books are pretty good."
suggestmeabook,fcy4axy,t1_fcxdkzn,1578074524.0,Seconded
suggestmeabook,fcy48qr,t1_fcxgbmv,1578074491.0,It's my favorite.
suggestmeabook,fcy46e2,t3_ejf87c,1578074455.0,"You can get the complete fiction of H.P. Lovecraft at just about any Barnes and Noble. As for which story, Call of Cthulhu or Dagon are the best introductions to his style and themes."
happy,fc808ht,t1_fc7zvfl,1577523388.0,"Of coarse they are. You see more negativity because people in a bad place need to strike out, people who are doing well are busy enjoying what they have. The world is full of good, it's just quietly enjoying all it has and misery needs company."
happy,fc7znfl,t1_fc7wsxl,1577522928.0,"I browsed a bit, it's pretty good but it's to sunny for me but I'm glad you found a place that you enjoy and feel appreciated, both online here and offline with friends."
happy,fc7yvq6,t3_egm21r,1577522325.0,That's good on you. It took me a lot longer to start working on myself. You've got a bright future youngster.
happy,fc7vqr6,t1_fc7vhqr,1577519905.0,Everything is on the front page if you scroll far enough but it's high enough for me to find it. I'm sure as hell not browsing the happy sub.
happy,fc7s91o,t3_egbfps,1577517323.0,"It's a tough time of year for many people, it's good that you found a place to feel welcome. And you made it to the front page of reddit."
AskOuija,fc3a4to,t1_fc2a5w1,1577385161.0,"Nice, roll for initiative."
