actuallesbians,ffis6hk,t1_ffirjlv,1579981374.0,it’s called ‘Alanis' Interlude’ from her new album Manic!
actuallesbians,ffiaryd,t1_ffhwvom,1579969417.0,I can here to also note the halsey reference! i love that song <3
ShinyPokemon,ff1k2fu,t1_ff1hnxg,1579480441.0,"unfortunately i don’t think it does. a few places have reported that it’s bugged so after 500 encounters only 3% of the time you even have the good odds, and the rest is full odds (or shiny charm odds i guess). sadly nintendo/gamefreak hasn’t commented on the issue or patched it.... i definitely got lucky because some people have been hunting longer than me hours-wise and haven’t been so fortunate. i hope you find your shiny soon!!"
ShinyPokemon,fez1luk,t1_feysv8j,1579453076.0,"I got the two forgeries around 400 and 700, and the final authentic one was well over the 999 max counter on the Pokedex. I think the KO method is currently bugged and only works 3% of the time after 500 encounters, or so I’ve heard."
GatekeepingYuri,ferbdts,t1_feqqvf6,1579351999.0,"usually people upload images to imgur (it’s free!) and then link them in their posts. if you’re on mobile you can create a link by clicking the chain symbol on the bottom left when you create a new comment/reply to someone, not sure about PC since i don’t use reddit on there but i’m sure it’s the same symbol at least!

also this is super cute <3 i love the colors and your art style"
tarot,feooi7c,t1_fenua5p,1579303076.0,"wait so are these eventually going to be available for sale? i LOVE these designs. so so much, it’s incredible :’)"
wholesome,feogb9o,t1_feof395,1579299731.0,"wow that’s a great achievement, you got this!! i’ve been there and i know that there’s plenty of ups and downs but you can do it :’) every step counts!"
wholesome,feoebrd,t3_eq3b54,1579298994.0,"you are so pretty!! i’m so proud of you, i hope things keep getting better <3"
ShinyPokemon,fehuqzw,t3_ep75d9,1579124263.0,"i also caught my g-max gengar in a premier ball, the white matches so well with the g-max shiny tbh. congrats on your catch!!"
bisexual,feh0x9h,t1_fegsqrk,1579106830.0,"not OP, but for anyone else who’s wondering I have the same exact one and I got it on Aliexpress for around $3! some places sell them for like $15 or higher, the one I have is great quality and a lot cheaper :)"
ShinyPokemon,feh07o4,t3_ep10t5,1579106400.0,intelleon looks so done in this shot lol
ShinyPokemon,feh00ri,t3_ep34jr,1579106285.0,"I didn’t play let’s go eevee/pikachu, is that a shiny wild Charizard?"
pokemon,fegzevw,t3_ep29vv,1579105914.0,i love the delcatty!! great choice
torties,feewjzz,t3_eol4et,1579042759.0,r/twofacedcats would love her!! she’s so beautiful
bisexual,feetfev,t3_eoj0w9,1579040829.0,is this your art? if so it’s super cute!
ShinyPokemon,fe83d7m,t1_fe7wc34,1578922041.0,"they said in their other post it was traded to them, so the item was hacked in by someone else other than OP"
ShinyPokemon,fe82952,t3_eo3lvf,1578921633.0,"eggs cannot hold items unless they are hacked in. still pretty cool though, and a masterball is a masterball :)"
ShinyPokemon,fdxtdko,t1_fdxt0s8,1578772715.0,"completely valid! i love hearing why people prefer one or the other, or both. thank you for sharing, good luck with your hunt :)"
ShinyPokemon,fdxqxe4,t3_enbzib,1578772015.0,is there a reason you prefer encounters over eggs? just curious :’)
ShinyPokemon,fds19s9,t3_emuicb,1578692772.0,"not sure if this will be helpful or not, but i suggest you look into trading discords/forums/the subreddit if you’re looking for anything specific rather than trading with random people who end up using your code (if that’s what’s happening). i imagine a lot of the time it’s children who you might be interacting with so they might just be trolling you or not understand what’s happening, or people who just go on trades to flex their shinies and disconnect. sounds like a lot of trouble tbh"
ShinyPokemon,fdqijby,t1_fdqgm8w,1578667525.0,hey could you provide a source / link? i tried to look it up without any luck. ty!! :)
ShinyPokemon,fdqi68z,t3_emmi73,1578667275.0,"i didn’t even know you could get formed-rotom in raids, that’s so cool :o"
ShinyPokemon,fdplf1w,t1_fdpl5ur,1578631894.0,"no problem, glad to help! i wish you luck in your endeavors :’)"
ShinyPokemon,fdpkrpn,t1_fdpelb5,1578631350.0,"i just checked online for similar stories as i could not remember if mine had ribbons or not, and [apparently](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeMoonSun/comments/9pd0v0/i_got_a_lvl_100_mew_in_wonder_trade_and_i_have_a/)  they can be traded with an exploit that requires custom firmware (hacking) to carry out. other people reported similar things across different forums i looked at. legitimately received events cannot be traded via wondertrade or GTS no matter what, but it appears these edits can be regardless of the ribbon. really strange tbh"
ShinyPokemon,fdpe1pc,t1_fdpdlen,1578626249.0,"not that this helps much, but i examined the OT in comparison to [past events](https://serebii.net/events/dex/385.shtml) and none match that, so it looks fully hacked. in my honest opinion, even if it’s hacked it’s still a great pokemon to have! i used to be against hacking the mythicals but many are impossible to get legitimately anymore unless you trade for them, and people with legit events are usually on the hunt for other events that like 3 people have, or ridiculous shinies (rightfully so!). i got wonder traded a bunch of hacked mythicals when i used to mass trade breedjects and i honestly love them. as long as you don’t pass it off as legit to someone else, no harm done in my opinion :)"
ShinyPokemon,fdpc8jz,t3_emkov9,1578624995.0,"Honestly I don’t think it is, because mythical Pokemon from events usually have a special ribbon that prevents them from being GTS/wonder traded. Also, the OT is not one from the few events that I know of where Jirachi could be shiny, but I need someone to double check that for me."
ShinyPokemon,fdklq66,t1_fdklcmf,1578506159.0,"oh i see! i never considered it might be four systems, thank you for the insight :)"
ShinyPokemon,fdk8chw,t3_elsdpm,1578498386.0,"i appreciate the idea, but there is 0 ways to enforce this. people set codes so people from the shiny raids discord can join, or for their friends or viewers if they stream. making it a subreddit rule would be useless as a lot of people post about other raids they join or ones they find that are already over. i wish that the y-comm didn’t show locked raids at all unless you were friends with the person (i don’t use online - is that how it works?) because it would probably save people a lot of heartache seeing a stamp they can’t get access to."
ShinyPokemon,fdk7uwt,t1_fdjybtv,1578498075.0,"congrats on your shiny!! i love seeing ones from previous gens on here :)

just a quick question, if you don’t mind me asking why do you always do the 4 picture layout? it is pretty pleasing but i’ve been wondering for a while if there’s a reason aside from aesthetics or just uploading a side-by-side comparison. i hope that doesn’t come across as rude or anything because that’s not my intention, i’m just curious!"
ShinyPokemon,fdikg3b,t3_elju49,1578444897.0,"i love shellos, it’s a great shiny! congrats :)"
ShinyPokemon,fdietsd,t1_fdien74,1578441295.0,thank you!! good luck with your hatching <3
