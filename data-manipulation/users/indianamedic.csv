AskReddit,ffh0jd2,t3_etai1s,1579919858.0,"The city of Chicago is full of underground neighborhoods. I'm talking houses, roads, streets lights signs, you name it. The city literally built up over these entire city blocks. My cousin was working at an Ace Hardware store someplace on the south side. He was in the basement stocking and noticed a steel door in the floor. He opened it and shined a flashlight down it and saw a house. He asked the owner about it and was told the city built pillars above the older neighborhood  but didnt know why. The owner said only a handful of people know about and its because the homeless would move into the abandoned subterranean neighborhood. Crazy shit. I have not talked to my cousin in a while and I always forget to ask if he went down to explore it."

Or if it was political in ""getting lost"" which would not surprise me, due to Trumps hatred of anyone who is not a white rich man. (I'm white upper middle class guy, I hate Trump, I hate racism. I grew up very poor, I come from a large family. In my family I have, gays, druggies, Mexicans, Africans and asians. All blood related.) I have done search and rescue on many national disasters including hurricanes. A lot of times the influx of supplies is tremendous. So supplies are stored in many different locations and several different government agencies ask for the same supplies. It's all about communication. Agencies do not communicate with each other. There is no ""one system"" to request and store supplies. In disasters its always screwed up despite our best efforts. It's sad"

AskReddit,feej39c,t1_fedjbkk,1579034776.0,With aging and dying off of the veterans the family are dying off too. So the stuff just gets boxed up for donations because literally the entire family died off. I've seen that happen a lot. Some vets didn't have kids or just one kid and that kid didn't have children. Its becoming more common these days. Unfortunately. One thing someone can do is contact a veterans organization and most times they will take them in honor of the the vet. Or the organization will contact someone in the government and the medal will be redrsibututed if it's a common medal. The older non common medals get sent to museums or locked away.

Theres lots of course I think all of them are college accreditation. The topics ran from radiological emergencies, emergencies management, horticulture, and veterinary science. If you get a federal government job that deals with the above careers you might need some of the courses as a job requirement.

AskReddit,fe9j0ki,t1_fe8enkd,1578937931.0,"Microsoft Azor is basically the same thing. I did the AWS course last year. It's a lot of material. I constantly have to go back and re read or re watch things. You don't have to go to college to get this cert. Save yourself a lot of money. These courses by Microsoft , Google and Amazon are all online most are accredited and the certs are industry standard across the board. The good thing is the course are free. You just pay for the testing, they are learn at your own pace and they keep tract of your progress. The bad thing is its learn at your own pace lol. So it's easy to get sidetracked. That's why I go back and be watch this stuff. I got the Google certs through Coursea. They advertise on tv. They have bundle course for dirt cheap. I have yet to find employment with these certs. BUT I have a good paying full time job already. Its more of a hobby backup type of thing for me. Theres tons of apps on your phone to learn coding of every type too. This shit is the way of the future. You really do learn a lot out of these course. I tinkered around with computers etc and after taking several different courses and getting into it. I can do a lot. I've rebuilt several laptops I acquired and I've fix my coworkers computers all the time. I like doing a research and found a lot of information on the history of computers.

religion,fdztrwy,t3_en7wys,1578795605.0,Does your church belong to an organization of other churches as well. Why doesn't someone do some investigating. Your church is very accountable for his actions. That's one thing you have to remember. The guy was representing your church. Would it be a scandal. Yeah more than likely. Do you want others to get hurt. Nope not at all. But you need to think about potential victims. No organization should ever cover up anything. Hence the catholic church. The brushing it under the rug went on for wayyy to long. It's not fair to the victims that are traumatized and generally confused about life after they have been victimized. You have to be their voice as painful as it may be.
religion,fdzsyz0,t1_fdxz8ui,1578795075.0,"You know its really sad too. I was born and raised catholic (Allah forgive me) now I'm an atheist. I'm at the point where I feel like a radical atheist actually. I just have to tone myself down on that shit. I just dont like any religion whatsoever. This whole thing with this pastor doing this is just more icing on the cake. In actuality he's no different from the catholic church or any other religion that takes advantage of people that want to help. I grew up poor, we didn't have a whole lot. I watched my mom literally give her last dollar to the church basket more times then I can remember. I mean we destitute quite a few times but yet my mom would throw some money in that basket when were getting getting government cheese and powder fucking milk. It pisses me off even to this day. Greed !!!! Its all about greed. It's not just the church. Its politicians, its cops, bankers, moms and dads etc. The list goes on and on. I just want to know where the accountability is with this shit. I don't know the whole circumstances. I just ask why wasn't a board of trustees set up for this? In reality no single person can be trusted. There should be an accounting system and a board to oversee the money."
