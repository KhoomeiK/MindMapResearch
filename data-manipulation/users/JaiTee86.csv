Jokes,ffer4rz,t1_ffep1eh,1579861392.0,"There is legit reasons, he may have just sold something like a car for cash and couldn't make it to the bank yet (sold it after they shut or on a weekend), I know here in Australia if you're on Centrelink (basically welfare) you need to give them bank statements every so often to show you don't have a ton of savings, so if you want to save you need to either have an account in someone else's name or keep it all as cash. There is also people who don't trust banks as well."
australia,ffbbvti,t1_ffb7c8v,1579758957.0,"Reasonable overtime is paid, unreasonable is expecting your staff to work for free.

If his employer wants him to do extra work for free they need to earn that and treat him incredibly well, but I bet he's on or barely above the minimum wage and from the sound of it is a casual when they are probably giving him more than enough hours to be permanent."
australia,ffbaow6,t1_ffb9yko,1579757685.0,"There is a link on that page for protections at work, you might not be safe from unfair dismissal but you are protected from your employer taking an adverse action against you for reporting a breach of workplace law. If you report them for a breach it suddenly becomes a lot harder for them to dismiss you or even reduce your hours, since if they do anything like that they need to be 100% sure they show that they would have done the same even if you hadn't reported them. My suggestion would be to bring this up with your boss that it's illegal for them to force you to do anything before a shift starts and they can either pay you from 10 minutes before your start time (i.e change your start time) or you will start at that start time, I would do this in writing because I can almost certainly guarantee that the first thing they'll do is start cutting your shifts, at this point email your companies HR department showing that you raised a concern about being required to do unpaid work and you got your hours cut. If it's a small business and has no HR department then your options change and you'd be better joining a union and having them assist."
australia,ffb813j,t1_ffb6j4b,1579754515.0,"The American Red Cross is a completely different organisation than the Australian Red Cross, although they're both members of the international red cross organisation (I can't recall it's exact name) they are both their own boss so to speak. As far as I know the Australian Red Cross is considered to be a pretty good charity that doesn't take excessive amounts for administrative reasons and is very transparent with what they do with any funds they get."
Defenders,ff8pd7r,t1_ff83jbc,1579690240.0,"Some super strength is linked to telepathy, just since the person isn't aware of it or is unable to control it for whatever reason it doesn't quite come out right and manifests more like super strength. I personally love this explanation of super strength since it helps cover up a few of the plot holes that super muscles have, the first being catching people or objects that are moving very fast without causing damage to the item, if a superhero standing on the ground catches you falling from a great height it isn't going to be much different than landing on two steel bars, you would be destroyed! Telepathy though gives the excuse that they are subconsciously slowing you down before they even get their hands on you. Another one that happens less is when they can push downward with extreme force, the most you can push down is based upon your weight (more if you're holding something of course) but you'll often see someone with superstrength pushing downward with enough force to crack the group or crush incredibly solid objects but instead of them being pushed up into the air the item gets crushed! From memory this is where Superman's strength comes from at least in some books and it's also what makes him bulletproof, he has a telepathic forcefield over his entire body, this is why in many of his stories his costume never gets damaged."
Ubiquiti,ff7wj7e,t1_ff2yevc,1579660043.0,"Have you tried mounting it a bit away from your camera? I don't know much about CCTV stuff but I do dabble in photography and if your flash is right next to your camera it's a lot easier to wash out people's facial features, if you move it a bit away or bounce it off a reflective surface (a proper reflector or even just a light coloured roof or wall) you can see people's facial features a lot better in your shots since you get shadows from their nose and cheeks and whatnot whereas straight on you don't."
Ubiquiti,ff7vnj7,t1_ff5zitj,1579659443.0,"Where I put mine they face doors, or windows an intruder could use to break in and get some nice shit, there is a lot of internal dead spots but the chance of someone taking things of value and not passing in front of a camera are very slim, unless they already know the internal layout. I also have a nest cam facing my network gear incase someone tries to steal or destroy the recordings, down the track I'd love to have them all record to the cloud but my internet isn't good enough to do that plus let me use my Plex server without causing problems."

TitansTV,ff44gst,t1_ff41q1a,1579555332.0,"I agree with you completely. There was a lot of good writing in there, it was just disjointed and lacked direction, it feels like they had two seasons worth of main plots that each could have even been multi season arcs (Deathstroke and Cadmus stuff) along with a couple of extra seasons worth of side plots. They took all that threw it into a blender and poured out a single season."
Games,ff2i0wl,t1_ff1zsi0,1579507013.0,"Back when they were text based 4chan abused this in order to automate voting in some internet poll. They all answered with the same word on a bunch of the pictures the algorithm wasn't sure on and eventually this caused the system to think the answer was this word for a ton of different captchas, they had enough people that they eventually got the system to the point that they could just answer both parts of the captcha with this word and more often than not they would pass. They could then set up a bot on their PC that would just keep voting over and over for them."

Games,feilwi3,t1_feikj3r,1579141595.0,I have a vague memory of some game having a timer that was linked to the frame rate so if you used some hack that uncapped the frame rate you also needed to disable it for a certain mission otherwise you would fail due to the timer counting down a lot faster than it otherwise would.

boardgames,feeqj82,t1_feekjyf,1579039084.0,"They are seperate things, so you can have a spectrum of how authoritarian you are and a spectrum of how fascist you are but putting them both on the same spectrum doesn't make sense since it's not a case of you level up your authoritarianism into fascism. Saying that, authoritarianism is a big part of fascism so while they're different they are related, and how authoritarian you are is a part of how fascist you are but you also need to be other things, kinda like to bake bread you need flour, eggs, yeast, etc fascism is the bread and authoritarianism is the flour and no matter how much flour you add without having the other ingredients you'll never have bread (fascism).

I hope that made sense!"
OutOfTheLoop,fdill8o,t1_fdijajm,1578445626.0,The anecdote isn't they fuck up a backburn it's that they do them purely to burn evidence they started the whole fire to begin with.
OutOfTheLoop,fdihyyd,t1_fdi0w6a,1578443332.0,"One of my co-workers was saying his dad says the same thing, the volunteers go and start a fire then the professionals like him have to go in and save everyone, apparently when the RFS does a backburn it's not an attempt to try stop the fire, it's to destroy all evidence that the RFS guys started it."
explainlikeimfive,fdgb8sa,t1_fdfyefe,1578388260.0,"In theory I think it would work, but you could just aim your bomb or missile next to it, on a softer target that'll probably be enough to destroy it and on an armoured target it'll likely cover it in dust and dirt, covering up the non reflective surface letting the second one come in, I don't know how hard paints like vantablack are to clean but my understanding of how they work (they're essentially light trapping tunnels pointing outwards from the object) makes it sound like they would be clogged with dust easily and quite fragile making them very poorly suited for military use.

There is also newer missiles that ride the laser's beam down and don't rely on a laser reflection."
marvelchampionslcg,fdf4egb,t1_fdebfh8,1578353049.0,"Make his form based on the resource of the last card you drew, physical would turn you into hulk, energy would turn you into Banner, mental would let you choose which form you are (energy and mental could be swapped but I like this way) and wild would put you into the opposite of your current form. Make Banner all about assisting allies and Hulk could have some ability where he draws a card anytime he deals damage or defends and gets progressive damage and armour boosts along with some decent base armour, making him very hard to deal damage too, but if he switches back to Banner during combat (from the forced card draw after attacking or any other effect) he takes serious damage based upon how hulked out he is and how many enemies he's fighting.

It would be high risk, high rewards gameplay where you need to push your luck in order to be effective but push it too far and you can easily knock yourself out."

3Dprinting,fd5tczu,t1_fd4sgrw,1578181284.0,"Cheers, any tips on things like strength or reducing filament usage? I used to do designs (I've mostly been designing things for organising board games) with 3mm thick dividers and walls but this just means I print two 1.2mm walks with some infill, cutting them down to less than 2mm really reduces print time and filament usage."

explainlikeimfive,fcpmrte,t1_fcnt80y,1577867679.0,I've always wondered if someone has ever died from pouring water they didn't realise was supercooled down their throat and choking to death on a newly formed throat filling ice cube.
askscience,fcoa80a,t1_fcnoxv5,1577827308.0,"""Steeled arrow heads"" are known to exist at the time from armory records, the problem is that nobody is sure what ""steeled"" meant, not a single steel arrow head has ever been found from that period the leading theory is they are case hardened arrow heads and the outer layer of case hardened steel corrodes off very quickly because it is quite thin, they did test case hardened arrow heads and the final shot at the 29:30 mark is a modern case hardened steel arrowhead fired from way closer and it left a decent dent but still bounced off.  


Arrows likely still penetrated plate armour just most of the time they bounced off, the sides and the arms and legs are thinner and will probably get penetrated (I believe that Tod wants to test this next) It is also quite possible that since not all armoursmiths are equal that some had weak points in their armour."

australia,fbx6h5v,t1_fbx1yeq,1577171446.0,"There probably was more than a few things written about him in his day it's just none of it has survived this long. One of the written sources of Jesus is a book that has a quote from a book that's been lost that is itself referencing another lost book, just to give you an idea of how much has been lost.

Sucks that people have used his teachings against you, always remember that they aren't real followers of Jesus or his teachings, he actually brought with him a pretty good message about not being a shit cunt to others and he was likely influenced in a lot of that by my personal religion, Buddhism."
