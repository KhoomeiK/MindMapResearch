Also a tip: try and be fully out of a place days before your move out date then ask for a pre move our walk to discuss the condition of the apartment. Get it recorded so you can fix anything they point out and make sure that you have video proof of the condition of the rented place.

They might not alway do the walk but you can always do a very through digital walk that might help with disputing charges later. Also you should always check everything on move in and note it no matter how small. This includes pulling up the carpet if it looks new to insure that it wasnt just clean well before hand."
