cats,fexcpit,t3_eqte99,1579428750.0,She seems more calico. Beautiful nonetheless
mildlyinteresting,fespd0h,t3_eqfie4,1579367600.0,I actually frequently see this around France. [Lyon takes it to the next level](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_Lmx3nflALw/WgLMk30BxMI/AAAAAAABUSA/-F5xwdfbm8M1ut3wRS1o503wW1GobFm9QCHMYCw/lyon-murals-810?imgmax=1600)

TrueCrime,fdzk7zf,t3_enf7pd,1578790986.0,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I read Jackie Hanse’s book about the incident this summer after I watched the documentary. I was super intrigued by the story at first simply due to the unimaginable loss the parents faced and how weird it all seemed. However, it just doesn’t really get much deeper than what you see in the documentary. At first it seems like a mystery - perhaps a medical emergency but after several tests were done confirming she was under the influence, it’s pretty cut and dry. 

Diane got inebriated and for whatever reason drove on the wrong side of the highway intentionally. 

I kind of suspected that maybe Diane got in a huge fight with her husband. One that was so bad she decided to end her life and the kids lives out of spite or hopelessness. This could explain why the husband is so adamant on her not doing it on purpose, so he wouldn’t have to live with the guilt. Maybe it is just for insurance reasons. Or maybe the husband really is just in denial. 

It’s just really hard to understand the thought process Diane had to take in order to actualize the events of that day. That is the real mystery I think. More so why than how, it’s really evident HOW she did it considering  the fact there’s serval tests confirming she was inebriated, but there’s no sane reason to justify getting drunk and intentionally killing your kids, yourself, your nieces and other innocent people on the road. 

I forget if the documentary mentions this, but in the book Jackie has the same wavelength about the situation. She realizes that Diane is responsible and it was due to intoxication and in fact finds it disrespectful that her former brother in law is in denial of this. As far as I remember, the Hance family severed ties with Dianes husband after the incident due to his constant denial as well as the fact he brought HBO into it. 

Overall, just a really sad situation. Kind of shows that you never really know a person. I hope everyone involved finds the peace they need."

travel,fdy3ipx,t1_fdvx99r,1578775685.0,Sorry I might have been unclear in my original question. I did read through these articles and there are some cool spots forsure but I posted this here to see if anyone knew of anything that was a bit more off the beaten path and wouldn’t be highly visited/commercialized because that really takes away from the nature. It’s hard to find this info on websites that pop up on google so that’s why I posted on an Internet forum for travellers! I didn’t mean to come across as ignorant in my post
