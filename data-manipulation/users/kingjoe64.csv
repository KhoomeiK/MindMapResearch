In ESO there's a DLC dungeon called [Moongrave Fane](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Moongrave_Fane) where we meet *The* Chevalier Renald ([yes, that one!](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Remanada)) and his friend Grundwulf. It's heavily implied that they were members of the original legion of Akaviri raiders who arrived in Tamriel 800 years before ESO in order to exterminate dragons and find a Dragonborn to serve i.e. Reman—becoming the original Dragonguard and predecessors to The Blades—and that they have survived all these years through vampirism.

Renald is very much a Blade—his mission in life is to serve the (Dragonborn) Emperor—and now he must try to find a new one for the throne after Reman's bloodline was assassinated by the Morag Tong, but Grundwulf isn't about that... No, *they* want to make the Empire whole again. ""How?"" you ask? By allying themselves with the [Hallowfang Clan](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Hollowfang_Clan), a group of Vampires that have downed a [Dragon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Sahrotnax) in their lair, and plan to feed on it before they die underneath all the rubble, and Grundwulf assumes that this will make himself Dragonborn so that *he* can be the Emperor.  

And it doesn't really pan out in their favor.

[Dragon Blood is *hot* and overflowing with magicka](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Nisaazda%27s_Journal)—during the final fight, Grundwulf feeds on Sahrotnax, but you can tell from their interactions that the experience is tortuous despite the power boost it seems to give:

> **Sahrotnax**: *""Feel my blood within you, leech.""*  
> **Grundwulf**: *""Breathe your last you damn beast!""*  
> **Grundwulf**: *""Put out the fire in my veins!""*  
> **Sahrotnax**: *""Let the wretch burn! I want to see him suffer.""*  
> **Grundwulf**: *""Quench this fire!""*  
> **Sahrotnax**: *""Everywhere you turn, the flames will be waiting!""*

Grundwulf didn't invoke the same rituals to *the Blood-Cat* Sangiin that the Hallowfang Clanmother did—we kill her before she can feed on Sahrotnax—but I'm not so sure that it would have worked in the first place tbh. 

tl;dr - as far as we know... vampires *can* drink dragon blood for a huge boon, but they'll end up feeling like they're burning up inside afterward and if that doesn't kill them they'll certainly *want* to die from the pain."

I agree with that. Idk, I've probably bought the 15 pack for most crown crates (some I had *zero* interest in) and I've been sitting on around 1000 gems for over a year. Sometimes it goes down when there's a boring crate out and I only want a couple of things from it, but the numbers mostly build. 

I bought the Dro-m'Athra mount that way for 100 gems. Yeah, it still probably cost me 40 bucks in the long run, but I got a bunch of other things in those crates, too instead of just spending 40 bucks on one mount."

> *""Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more than Torygg. And so he came before my husband and he... he shouted. With that terrible voice. Like something out of a legend... Or a nightmare. When Ulfric unleashed such fury, my husband he... he simply ceased to be. That is all I will say, for it grieves me to speak of it.""* â€” Elisif the Fair

-
>*""By Nord custom, once the challenge was issued in court, Torygg had no choice but to accept. Had he not, Ulfric would have had cause to call a new moot and a new vote for High King. Torygg had some martial training, of course, but it mattered little that day. When Ulfric's lips parted, when he unleashed the power of the Thu'um... That Shout, that ancient and terrible tongue... ripped Torygg asunder.""* â€” Sybille Stentor

Sybille drops this line, too, proving many people saw what happened:

>""The whole court was in attendance. I've seen much in my time, but that was a gruesome day.""

-
Even Torygg himself seems to corroborate the story when you meet his spirit in the afterlife:

>*""When Ulfric Stormcloak, with savage Shout, sent me here, my sole regret was fair Elisif, left forlorn and weeping. I faced him fearlessly - my fate inescapable, yet my honor is unstained - can Ulfric say the same?""*

-
tl;dr - Ulfric Stormcloak is a charismatic liar like many authoritarians vying for power:

>*""My shouting Torygg to the ground proved he had neither. However, it was my sword piercing his heart that killed him.""*

edit: Of course, Torygg's whole court could be lying... but that's *a lot* of lies vs Ulfric Stormcloak & Friends."
