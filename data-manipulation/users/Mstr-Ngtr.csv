wholesomememes,fem95ia,t3_epvw4b,1579244361.0,"I think I'm losing myself by trying to always be tough. My dad is the tough as nails, make it happen type and I don't want him to think I can't handle things so talking to him is super hard. I have many many flaws and worry that if I'm having such a hard time now will any woman love me if I can't just deal with things? My relationship with my mother is deteriorating as she is constantly upset with me in that I ""am becoming an emotionless machine"". I'm just tired of lying that I'm handling things ok when I'm not. Even now I'm conflicted as to whether I should say this because I know should just be a man and take things one day at a time but it's all difficult. Generally I'm disappointed in myself because everyone tells me I'm going to do big things some day -which is really what I do want for myself self and I'm working my hardest at it- but I haven't made any real progress. I'll be ok I know but it's just hard right now and I needed to say it somewhere."
