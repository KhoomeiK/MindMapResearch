aws,fc94qbz,t1_fc8s5e2,1577547005.0,"Ya makes sense, I think because it’s considered a resource by your template, cf keeps it around. For example if you deleted the custom resource in your template, cf would invoke your lambda with a delete action. In your case that’s not very useful but if your lambda provisioned some resources that needed to be torn down, that’s when you’d want it to stay there"
