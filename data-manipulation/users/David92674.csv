depression,fcwyclm,t3_ejamne,1578042913.0,I'm far more interested in why you need a good cry. Care to share your real feelings?
depression,fcwxinn,t1_fcw4le7,1578041854.0,"When (honestly) is the last time you volunteered at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter? Sitting alone watching Anime is easy and fun. But it's not rewarding and why you're feeling sad. You won't feel sad if you get out there and give your time to those without a TV or option to watch Anime at all. Not dissing you, legit suggestion that ""may"" help your mental heath. Dunno unless you try..."
depression,fcwxb9p,t3_ej7wb5,1578041600.0,"1) Good on you for learning your craft and stocks. 2) That feeling comes from not applying what you have to help others. If you're broke go volunteer at a soup kitchen / homeless shelter. If you succeed in the stock market spend some time teaching others how. That ""empty"" feeling is YOU telling YOU that you are capable of giving and are not. Give your time. Teach."
depression,fcwwr8b,t3_ej9tbf,1578040906.0,"I think you nailed it in your first sentence. We are ""all"" depressed. I don't think ""you"" are the problem here. I don't believe ""you"" are the cause of ""all"" our depression. This system is utterly unfair because they have the money and they make the rules. There are a half million subs here. Let's all put in $1/mo toward making a difference for those of us that FEEL things and CARE! I'll setup the non-profit, I'll setup the website, I'll invest the money into 3% dividend stocks and I'll give that 3% to actually SOLVE some problems for ""humans"". Good idea or am I a fool for wanting to try?"
depression,fcwwd0k,t1_fcwt0ah,1578040403.0,"I have NEVER shit upon anyone's post before but you force me sir. First of all you suggest 3 steps and offer 2. Second, your offerings are weak. Go for a run, meet a girl in the park and live happily ever after? It's not that easy mate."
depression,fcww0c2,t1_fcwvd51,1578039966.0,"Sorry, I meant year*"
depression,fcwvd51,t3_ej9tbf,1578039175.0,"Been reading a lot of posts like these recently. Unfortunately those that had money before us have set up a system of perpetual debt so they can be ""happy"". So, here's what I suggest. We are over a half million strong just in this Reddit. What if everyone here donates ONE dollar per month on an ongoing basis to solve some financial problems MANY here are suffering? I'll setup a non-profit, I'll setup the website, I'll do what I can to organize it all, I'll invest every dollar into stocks with a 3% dividend and I'll give that 3% to people like the OP to clear his debt and mind. Half a million people here = six million dollars per month if we choose to practice what we preach and commit to ONE DOLLAR per month to better the human experience. Am I a fool or am I scraping the surface on a great idea here?"
depression,fcws974,t3_ej4ay4,1578035542.0,"While your post was short, yours was the most pain I've ever read. It's ""unnatural"" for a parent to lose a child and nothing we've ever been prepared for. I'm thankful you have a partner to lean on through this and that he has you to lean on. All I can say is that I'm sorry and I thank you for coming here to talk... You have seen something no one ever should and I'm sorry..."
depression,fcwrovp,t3_ej91r7,1578034918.0,"To the OP. I respect your feelings. I humbly suggest you volunteer at a homeless shelter on an ongoing and regular basis. Lead by example and when others look upon you, they won't be forced to feel that ""people suck"" as you have been forced to feel. Just try it, what do you have to lose but a few hours? I guarantee you won't regret it."
depression,fcwquoh,t1_fcwjdlf,1578034022.0,They're human and that's enough...
depression,fcwq9cf,t3_ej2765,1578033410.0,"What a wonderful post. Akin to a light at the end of the tunnel for all of us. We know depression doesn't leave, but you showing progress helps us all realize it's possible. Thank you for your gift."
depression,fcwnvsb,t3_ej1l29,1578031067.0,"What ""I"" take from this very well written post is that the OP cares very deeply. No one that ""doesn't give a shit"" about hurting others joins a depression message board and writes pages of regrets and admissions about their actions. OP, stay strong and focus on your morals. You are more than simply your current actions. We're all flawed."
depression,fcwktcc,t1_fcv1eyv,1578028387.0,"I feel like depression festers when we try to eat an elephant and forget about one bite at a time. When we can't see the options or the first step we feel hopeless. Worrying about a 30 year mortgage is a lot of pressure at 21. How about this for an option... You save up the down payment on a decent 4 bedroom house and you rent out the other 3 rooms? Your bills go down to almost nothing instantly, you make 3 new friends you're around all the time and in 10 years you refinance so the three rents are paying for the entire home for you. Huge win."
