They said charcoal gray sedan and at one point they said Nissan but then they retracted that. It looks like cop tried to talk to them right by university on 6th, the car immediately pulls out, hits a pedestrian on the turn from 6th to university and makes it to the freeway before the cop can catch up. Fucked up and the perpetrator might just get away with it. Seems hard to believe there aren’t cameras that caught that anywhere near that intersection."

It’s amazing how many people are telling me she doesn’t mean it, I should believer when she says she didn’t mean to say it, but how can I ignore that? The hard part now is that everytime she threatens divorce or splitting, I take it more and more seriously. A few weeks ago a looked at apartments for rent for the first time. Also it just makes my guard come up, which in turn makes me a little more distant or a little less connected which makes things worse. It’s hard to get told you need to leave and the next minute ask why I’m not being more affectionate."

If I was interested in someone, I just needed a moment of eye contact. If it was a match, you could see it in her eyes, if she wasn’t interested, well you wouldn’t get that moment of eye contact. I just needed to see her look at me to know she was interested and all I needed to do was look back. Maybe I didn’t get quantity of women, but I felt like I got quality connections."

Filmmakers,fdy4uy5,t1_fdwxli0,1578776172.0,"I’m going to meditate on this. In my mid-thirties now, graduated with film degree ten years ago.  9 years ago I went in debt making my short. We went all out, great locations, art dept, DP, trailers for cast, we went all out for it. In post-production due to a couple bad performances and a script that didn’t hold its own, i shelved the whole project before showing it anywhere. I’m still haunted by this failure. And I think the only thing that will bring me relief is to do another short, the right way. But I can’t think of a story that I genuinely like or can care about.  I still work in production, mostly a lot of corporate work but also some short doc style jobs, but it’s all just a job at this point. I need to find a story I care about. Maybe your comment will open some things up in my head."

offmychest,fc4p0xb,t3_ededf7,1577423361.0,"I know I’m late to the party but I stumbled on this post and felt I needed to jump in because I know this story so well. I too have wealthy in-laws, and actually wealthy, definitely in the economic upper class, not the top but very well off. My mom and her husband are on the bottom rung economically. Her husband is on disability and my mom had to keep working late into her 60’s. They actually had to move out of their house a year ago and moved into a RV Park. It seems so absurd that one family is living it up, going on cruises and more, just on a perpetual expensive vacation. Trying to share my feelings with my partner doesnt go well either. There is something about wealth that can really make people defensive, or guarding of their economic prowess. I was always reminded how much their family halos people, but never have they actually offered my family help. It’s lame and it is a little wedge in my relationship with my spouse. I don’t even see that resolving, not with them, not with my spouse. But I have at least come up with a strategy to do something. The truth is my spouse and our kids do get help from the in-laws in our own lives. This support is allowing me to lift myself out of debt and ultimately I’ll be able to help my own mother financially because of that support. There’s been a little push back from the spouse but that’s pretty absurd and I’m determined to do why I’m going to do. So maybe there’s a way you can make this work out, but that bitterness may not be resolved by any action on their part, but if you can find a way to help, you’ll feel somewhat better about the whole situation. Good luck out there and mind your relationship and keep the resentment in check if you want to maintain your marriage because resentment is the true killer of relationship."
