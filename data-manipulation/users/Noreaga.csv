ukpolitics,fg65n0e,t1_fg65a8w,1580554886.0,"Looking at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_general_election, it appears the Conservative Party has a high majority among the two main parties. 42.4% vs 40%. Also Googled the referendum and it looks like it was 53.4% (15,188,406 voters) in favor and 46.6% (13,266,996 voters) against, with a vote difference of 1,921,410 people. That seems to me like a HUGE majority that was for Brexit.  
  
Aside from the Conservatives winning pretty big a little while back, what do several polls that you claim showed majority wanted to remain have anything to do with the Brexit referendum landslide? Didn't realize a few random polls of couple hundred or thousand people changes the results of 28,455,372 people voting."
