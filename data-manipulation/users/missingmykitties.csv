cats,ffsva2r,t3_euv8wv,1580193855.0,"I'm so sorry, for both Mi and or you. It must have been a great comfort for him to be in your arms and feel the love you have for him as he passed. You can see in your picture that he clearly adored you. What a handsome boy he was, too, and very gentle and loving to only gently gnaw at your wrist when he had his fill of belly rubs. He'll live forever in your heart, and now he's in ours as well. Sending you hugs."
cats,ffst4au,t1_ffsktke,1580191483.0,Are you going to adopt him? Sounds like you've bonded with him. :)
relationship_advice,ffpm5zc,t1_ffnrwud,1580098491.0,"There is no way at 15/16 I would have let myself be alone in a car with a 32-year-old adult male, even a co-worker that I knew. No way, no how. Totally creepy and disgusting."
relationship_advice,ffplsc2,t1_ffphd4r,1580098219.0,"You want to go to be there, to be seen with him, to make it clear he is taken. Won't necessarily stop anything on his or her part, but not going, being quiet about it all, making it so neither he or she has to deal with or think about you, is not going to help you. Don't make this easy on either one of them by...making it easier for them."
relationship_advice,ffplfbx,t1_ffpgx8u,1580097947.0,"No more creepy than him going, age-wise. And if you feel creepy around 21-year-olds, doesn't that say that he should be feeling similarly? Besides, you're his wife. You should be going with him, as his *wife* and partner. Yeah, he's being shady. Sorry."
Botchedsurgeries,ff4vdnv,t3_ern6ap,1579573348.0,What did she have done? Just fillers and Botox? She was so beautiful before.
cats,fdg2ju9,t1_fdfzl4h,1578377647.0,She found her people :)
cats,fdg28zf,t1_fdfqzqy,1578377334.0,"> *we now have a sticker at his level on the glass slider so that doesn’t happen again.

So considerate of you! Good cat parent. :)"
relationship_advice,fcu86ms,t1_fcu15ij,1577974853.0,Agree with everything but the tandem breastfeeding part. That's normal and commonplace.
IllegallySmolCats,fcig94d,t1_fc7d0de,1577662072.0,"I had a cat with scarring from a corneal ulcer, too! His was caused by a virus as well, and he lost about half his vision in that eye. His scarring was in several places across his cornea, but he did fine with it. Later on, when he lost his good eye, the corneal scarring caused trouble seeing in low or no light. He'd get lost in the bathroom when he went to his litter box if it was at night and the lights were off, and couldn't find his way out of the room again. We ended up keeping on an overhead light in the bathroom all night for him. That helped. Hopefully, your little lady will never lose any more vision and won't have any trouble. 

She's so cute! Makes me want a kitten again."
