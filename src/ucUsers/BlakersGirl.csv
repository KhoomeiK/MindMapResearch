I used to work for Daily Bruin (won’t say which department) but it is far from a single cohesive unit people think it is. Various departments run different things and there is often no interaction between them. The people endorsing these candidates could very well be a small department within DB and does not represent the suitability of any candidate any more than if any other club leadership chose candidates. What I mean is there will be biases based on friendships and club politics.

This is not to say that they’re choices are inherently wrong just because DB choses them, just take whatever endorsements they have with a grain of salt. (Remember when they endorsed Warren?)"

ucla,fp3godz,t3_gb1jw2,1588278983.0,"To be honest, no one outside of the frat community will know or care (not a dig at feats and sorority, I know a lot of people in the system) what ranks frats have. UCLA is not a school like Dartmouth where frats are more significant and rankings matter more. Just choose the community that you vibe with the most, you’ll most likely be happier that way."
ucla,forymfw,t3_g8vkm4,1588020795.0,"I did the myth cluster and I actually liked it/don’t regret taking it. I do agree with others in that you have to be interested in the cluster material to do well in it, I was already interested in mythology and was a huge fantasy fan so it was quite enjoyable. I know others in my class didn’t feel the same way because it is a lot (especially during fall quarter)"

ucla,fo56agn,t1_fo4sdd5,1587518435.0,"Can’t confirm how I know, but yes, the UCLA Store is doing quite badly for all the reasons OP said. 

Little known fact, the store merch designs for clothes are also designed by one person, which is why the UCLA designs have largely remained stale and uninspired despite increases in price. No one buys these because they usually look bad- I remember when Pull and Bear came out and they were sold out so fast because they were (a) trendy and stylish (b) cheaper than actual UCLA Store merch, proving that there is a market for students and UCLA merch but UCLA Store fails to tap into it.

A large part of why the UCLA store is also failing because a part of sales is also derived from sales at sporting events, which should speak for itself (they have been falling steadily year by year).

Lastly, the only part of the store which is steadily busy is the Market or food area. I have never seen the makeup section or skate section or book section busy and I would argue for those parts to be removed entirely because they aren’t profitable at all due to the popularization or Amazon."

ucla,fnggkze,t3_g1m2oo,1586931573.0,"The problem with USAC is that they refuse to see their own weaknesses. I’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they’re funds aren’t appropriated, but I am still incredibly disappointed in their behavior.

In the UCLA Secrets post Robert Watson says that now is time to be an ally and donate 15 dollars. I really don’t understand how if you don’t want to pay a fee you are not an ally, I was not aware that being an ally meant you should be happy about a largely unannounced change in fees. Furthermore, this is really not the time- many many people are feeling financial stress and the lack of understanding by our president clearly shows that his view of merely 15 dollars is that of someone privileged.

And when I say unannounced I mean that it is literally not easy to find information on the fee. I can’t believe that members of USAC think that they are doing a good job educating and being transparent when most people had NO idea where the fee money was going and relied on a fucking UCLA post to educate people. I don’t see it readily announced on their website a couple days ago or anything."

Tried with instant coffee, worked a lot better.

Both times we used a hand mixer too, not sure what the chemistry of instant coffee vs other powders that makes it unique..."

I also never attended any online discussions unless I had to and I did fine, it’s definitely doable."
