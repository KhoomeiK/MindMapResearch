I'm thinking of just looking through management electives and see what I can get or even study abroad if I can get the chance to. If there are any classes that teaches stuff used everyday in workplaces, I would definitely sign up for that class since I have nothing better to do."

UCI,fpmcsai,t3_geaxcq,1588730269.0,"I can't answer your second question, but business admin is a very difficult major to get into. They accept I believe 10 transfers every year."
UCI,fpmb9ue,t3_ge6r9h,1588729366.0,"I'm not a CS major, bit I'm a freshman in business admin, who's trying to graduate within 3 years as well. I'm fully able to graduate by next summer, but decided against it due to various reasons. I've been taking 20 units for 2 quarters now. It's pretty difficult as it becomes gradually harder to catch up to everything especially if things are online. However, if you can pick yourself up during these times, then I think you should be good.

Can you do this if you're taking 20 units for every quarter? If you have enough AP credits then you can. If you don't have enough AP credits, you can take 20 units every quarter for 3 years and it won't be enough. It also really helps if you can get language out of the way as well through AP or a SAT subject test.

Now although I'm in a different major from you, I have friends in CS and I've seen a lot of reddit comments. From what I can gather, the courses in CS are exponentially harder than classes in business admin so it'll be difficult to not burn out by your second year. When your upper divs come, it'll probably be an even worse hell. You'll also need job/research experience as well and good luck with that if you're taking 20 units every single quarter. One of the reason I decided to take a third year is because I needed the summer for an internship if I can get one and I wanted to go to the career center during the school year to get help with my resume/interviews and get a job for more experience if I could. Basically I'm going to school part-time for my entire third year.

Overall, it all depends on your AP credits and how much you can handle in terms of schoolwork."
UCI,fpm8x7n,t3_ge8kk6,1588727973.0,"Honestly, I'm sure it'll be a bit chaotic, but I feel like it all depends on the experiences that you had before. For example, I'm taking 20 units this summer so 3 classes for each session (although 2 of them are the two unit university life helping classes).

I know I can do this because I've been taking 20 units for the past 2 quarters. 20 units for 10 weeks and 10 units for 5 weeks seem to be a similar amount of workload. I also got the easiest GE's I could possibly find with the easiest teachers that I can find on RMP.

Even if exams are on the same day, I've dealt with that before. I've had 3 midterms in 1 day last quarter. I've survived that so I think I can easily survive 2 tests in 1 day.

So what I'm trying to say is that if you've had experience with taking a lot of units in 1 quarter, I'll say just do everything in SS1. You'll get a nice 5 week break afterwards. However, if you don't really have this experience or the classes you have to take are difficult, then do it in SS1 and SS2. Now if you don't have experience, even if the classes you have to take are easy, don't take it all in one go. Two easy classes on a tight schedule is probably harder than 1 difficult class as you have to deal with 2 different sets of homework, exams, and etc. instead of 1 making it a lot harder for you to study and stay on track. Hope this helps."

Also, let me say that your aggressive warding tactics only make things worse. This kind of statement aggravates people even more and say even more shit to you. There's a saying ""no one will slap a smiling face"" or something along those lines. What you're doing is like pushing a person down and say that they better help you. Just try to explain yourself as best as you could like your first statement and perhaps people won't be as harsh in their criticism. Of course, you'll still see those harsh comments, but it'll be much less than when you say ""Let's cut the BS, you know what I mean by attractive""

While she is indeed attractive, I've seen girls that are much more attractive in my eyes although they definitely do not fit in the golden ratio. I'm sure you also find some girls you met more attractive than Colgate. 

Onto your other points, you don't need to be in the same major as a girl to approach her. I mean there are clubs, frats, and etc. for a reason. Sure, it'll be more inconvenient to be in different majors due to having different requirements and etc., but there are other ways to meet girls.

Also, if you don't want others to misunderstand you, then don't ask a question like a domineering fuck boy that only came to college to get laid. The question itself was pretty bad, but your word choice and tone such as ""Lets cut the BS, you know what I mean by attractive""  just took it to the next level. Also, you miss out details like the ""its not always easy while your in college to go seek out people to date, instead of cold approaching its easier and more successful to warm approach girls that are in your mutual circle or that you have a familiar acquaintance"" or ""purely out of curiosity and wasnt something i was going to use"" portion.

It's always good to have a balance, but if you're choosing your major based on the amount of cute girls, all I can say is that it's laughable.

I even asked all the counselors to make a business calculus class because if you have one for bio, why not for business because I'm sure that Paul Merage has some money to spare for this. However, they said that math 2a and 2b were required and there was no way to get out of it. 

So my best advice is if you're not strong in math, just aim for a C to a C+ and focus on other classes because math isn't really worth it. I'm taking my final lower div business classes and the most advanced mathematical concept we used was summation for business stats. Everything else from accounting and etc were basically at most simply algebraic math. Maybe upper div accounting, financing, or info management will use more calc concepts, but yeah from what I can see so far, calc is not worth much of your attention. Good luck."

I'm sure that if they hung out IRL, they would still do it for content and eventually reveal it to the audience.

Yeah, it's really shitty that she didn't tell him and it was a mutual that told him. I feel like if she told him personally, then the friendship could've remained even if Fed would be pissed off/confused for a while. Admitting your wrong first can go much farther than being forced to tell the truth.

By hiding stuff from him, Fed feels betrayed as he felt that the two really connected with each other as friends.

If Yuna felt that she had some kind of friendship with Fed, she would've told him herself instead of a ""mutual telling him"". That's in the best case scenario. If what her ""boyfriend"" said was correct, she's a manipulator that used Fed for clout. However, in the case of the former, by hiding stuff from him, Fed feels betrayed because the friendship that he felt that the two had was built upon lies. Now who knows what else she could've been lying about. For all we know, she was using him for clout like the boyfriend said she was. Fed explained why he thought this all felt really bad. You might not completely understand as it might just look like he hired an egirl, but to Fed, it's a completely different story because he also talked about the OTV house and etc so it's just not about him anymore.  I won't try to speculate beyond this, but what I'll say is that Fed is not a simpleton for this even if he thought this was all real. If they talked for hours for a week and Yuna stopped taking payments from him, then it's very natural for someone to think the relationship evolved to friendship because it's not a transactional relationship anymore."

Only League was fake. She probably was like Silver or Gold or something, but wanted to make some quick bucks and since she felt that the GM she knew was not ""sellable"" due to whatever reason, she used herself as the bait."

It's just League and some money that she refunded. However, I thought of it from his point of view. She lied to him and I guess tried to hide it. My guess is that she got scared that this situation would happen, but that's just my guess and me being a bit optimistic because I honestly felt that their relationship was genuine (except that part). If it was just some random egirl that scammed him of his money, Fed would've just gotten a bit pissed and ask for a refund or something, but this is someone that he felt really close with (someone that at the very least, he felt a really close connection to and even perhaps had a romantic feeling towards who knows.) When your friend, someone who you let your guard down towards, lies to you, it just really hurts."
