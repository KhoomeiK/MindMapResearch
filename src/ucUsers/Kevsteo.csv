Drugs,fpb5i6a,t1_fpa3y8x,1588462534.0,"Dang, I‚Äôm on adderall right now. When I first took adderall it was just for fun, but now I take it because I kinda have to. I sustained a traumatic brain injury over 2 years ago that left my concentration and memory impaired, and I ended up getting a script that has helped greatly with that. I‚Äôm just worried that in the future I won‚Äôt have the motivation to do anything sober."
