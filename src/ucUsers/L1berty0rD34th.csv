Competitiveoverwatch,fp91fn2,t3_gc3c23,1588410636.0,Damn ZP mentioning WAY old Overwatch and Debett was such a throwback. Was a surprise to hear that he still plays casually and talks to old OW people like ZP

Competitiveoverwatch,fp8bc0i,t1_fp81y4e,1588388093.0,"Eh. I'm only diamond, and I've only played in lower ranks (silver-low plat) a few times, but I have to admit its really cathartic to completely dominate a team while barely trying. Does it ruin the experience for others? Yes definitely, but people are selfish so using that argument is counterproductive."
berkeley,fp8a0fc,t1_fp83eg8,1588387203.0,"I followed your suggestion and have concluded that this is not entrapment in the slightest. The professor did not coerce/induce anyone to do anything. 

> An entrapment defense arises when ~~government agents~~ professors resort to repugnant behavior such as the use of threats, harassment, fraud, or even flattery to induce defendants to ~~commit crimes~~ cheat."

ApplyingToCollege,fp5dx37,t1_fp22dyr,1588325746.0,"Yes. You can switch to any major whenever as long as you meet the declaration requirements and show you can graduate reasonably on time, You have until end of sophomore year to declare. There are some gen eds (~13 classes, but many can be waived with AP), and every major has their own prereqs to declare. Double majoring is fairly common"

BlackPeopleTwitter,fp1dsia,t1_fp156y4,1588232179.0,"AP classes are a set of classes with a nationally standardized curriculum and end of year exam. They're usually more difficult than an individual high school's offering on that subject, and many colleges accept AP exam scores to place out of some classes (dependent highly on the college). E.g, getting a 5/5 on the AP Calc exam might count for Calc 1 and 2 credit at your university."
NoStupidQuestions,fp116dn,t1_fp10q9s,1588221688.0,"That's definitely false. There might be some confusion because a limiting factor is not just how many FPS are being produced by the computer, but also how many frames per second the screen can physically display (its refresh rate, in hertz). Most consumer devices have 60Hz displays so you wouldn't see any difference past 60FPS on that particular screen. There's also some misinformation in the gaming community steming from ignorance, mostly. 

But, some phones now have 90Hz displays, and some gaming monitors have 144Hz or higher. If you put then side by side with 60Hz, you'll definitely notice a difference."

berkeley,fo8tak9,t3_g6d1z7,1587603392.0,"Ask your leaser if they have added or can add any COVID provisions, some of the rent offers I've been seeing recently have new addendums like ""You sign the lease, but you can delay move-in until UC Berkeley resumes in-person instruction, and we will only charge $1/month for rent until that happens."" Your landlord is also being hurt by COVID and they will be more willing to work out a mutually beneficial agreement."

NoStupidQuestions,fo4ucjz,t3_g5q2yt,1587511377.0,"A lot of commercial cigarette brands have chemicals to aid combustability. Pure tobacco is harder to burn. That said, a blunt shouldn't need to be continuously relit unless you're smoking it *very* slowly or have rolled it wrong."
berkeley,fo1g299,t1_fo11wtn,1587432515.0,"Bins are curves in disguise. If the class is doing poorly, then they move the bins to create a better distribution. If the class is doing too well, then they make the exams absurdly difficult (and the shift the bins later to make up for it). Because CS classes are so big, the grade distributions fall into a predictable enough distribution that they can use binning because they predict the percentage of students that will fall into each bin."

Typefaces have to be specifically picked or developed to ensure readability and standardized for consistency. The scale of standardization usually just depends on the competency and teamwork of regional and federal transportation authorities."

NoStupidQuestions,fngb9xz,t3_g1l6q5,1586927110.0,"This is what the variance and standard deviation measurements are for. In regular* terms, they tell you ""In general how far away is a data point from the average?"" A centrist data set would have a very low variation/std, while a very extreme data would have a much higher value. There are also other measurments like inner-quartile range
