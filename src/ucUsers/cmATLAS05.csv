Op's mom is upset that her kid would rather be away from her family for the entire school year AND summer. Wouldn't your mom be upset too?? Even if op's mom said ok you do your thing she would still be sad. This would be the case for ANY parent who wants be close to their kid. 

Also we don't know about how op's family culture is ie east asian families are very close knit generally and want to keep family close. This could also be a factor."
relationship_advice,fodg06m,t1_fodd9li,1587684221.0,"I wouldn't tack ""emotionally manipulating"" so easily. Op is still her kid and she probably considers op as such. Who wouldn't cry knowing their kid would rather be elsewhere than with them, esp during a pandemic? Like i understand op doesnt want to come home bc its freeing, but at the same time how long are they gonna stay away for? If there's isnt anything between op and their mom other than being overprotective, then it think its understandable for the mom to be sad"

relationship_advice,fnywfvn,t3_g4q6ur,1587378225.0,"Love, you're simply attached to the idea of him. You know he's not worth your time and you deserve better!! But you're scared you won't find someone who you could be happy with or that you would miss him, and this is what is holding you back. At some point even if you look back him and believe you miss him,  you don't. It's not him. So you were happy with him at some point - at what cost? Would you be willing to compromise everything for that tiny bit of happiness that is in the past? Of course not!!! 

I was in the same exact position as you, more hung up on the fact I lost a relationship rather than not being with him. But I thought about it and realized what a waste of myself to believe that I could attach the thought of my only happiness to someone who didnt deserve it!!!
You will find someone else, otherwise you will become happy with yourself. That boy you know damn well aint shit - and he isn't your happiness.

Delete the chat history, put the gifts in a box somewhere, store any pictures and digital memories away on a storage account and delete them on your phone or whatever. Focus on yourself or on other things. Bake something!! Find some new music!!! Do something that'll make you happy, and you'll realize you have so much more in life that will make you happy, and whatever attachment you have to your past with him will fade. 

:)"
relationship_advice,fny4xs0,t3_g4ldbm,1587353508.0,"You could ask, but i would do so after some time apart so you can learn and grow by yourself. You guys can stay friends and continue talking until then so you can keep your bond close! It seems like he still loves you and broke up with you bc of the relationship and actions rather than falling out of love, so he may be willing to. 
Its good that you realized your mistakes and have chosen to make movement towards self growth and fixing it!! Hope the best for you :)"
college,fnkk03b,t3_g2bam6,1587029982.0,"What applies to you doesn't apply to everyone. Classes for other people could be harder than yours.

Some people are struggling because the learning environment isn't ideal and they aren't taking in the information as well as they did before. Some people are under high stress from a variety of different reasons. Some professors have made their classes harder to compensate for the fact everything is online now or they're not running their course efficiently (ie making zoom lectures longer than the actual course time slot or posting 2hr long videos when class is only 1hr). Your professors are posting videos, but other professors aren't. Some people have moved and are in different time zones so exams, due dates, lectures are difficult to manage.

There are a variety of different reasons for their classes being harder. Good for you that your professors are providing an easier course, but that's not the case for everybody."
relationship_advice,fngwh8f,t3_g1ozu9,1586947537.0,"Honestly i don't understand why everyone in the comments are saying you're in the wrong? I grew up with strict parents and although I did make a fuss about it being restricting, i was better off listening to them.

The main thing is that she's still a minor, under your roof, and honestly,, still immature. She's 17. She's going through a rebellious stage, but if anything you should reach out to her and talk to her to try and understand how she's feeling. What she did wrong was go again your trust in her. She shouldn't have lied or acted up.

I would recommend trying to talk to her, but not repriming her or yelling at her or trying to ""convince her to not throw away her life"". Talk to her and explain that you have a role in her life as a parent and that you have your own worries. Talk about how you care for her and how you care about her actions and consequences that could possibly come out of it. Do it calmly. Allow her to talk to you as well. Let her fight and argue with her own opinion as you explain your own actions. No matter what, she needs to understand your authority and your right to care about what she does as a parent. 

Once you get that done, ask her about what she's thinking and why she chose to lie to you. Again don't get upset about what she tells you. Its going to be valid to her and therefore something you will need to try to understand. Ask about her relationship with the guy, what her plans are, what he's like etc. You don't know anything - maybe he's a better guy than you think, maybe he's not. But you need to see it from her perspective. Ask her about anything on her mind and reassure her its okay to open up. 

Talk about the future - dating, sex, grades, drugs and alcohol. Shes old enough to talk about it. Talk about the consequences of drinking and how she should drink safely. About dating and then sex, safe sex, what happens if she were to get pregnant. About expectations to keep her grades up for the future. EVERYTHING. Have your wife talk to her about this stuff if it makes your daughter more comfortable. Talk about your own rebellious stage when you were younger and the dumb teenager shit you experienced. 

The last thing is talking about the future. As parents you should set boundries or curfews, which is a conpletely normal thing (my curfew was 10pm, rarely later if i asked beforehand). Establish what she should and shouldnt do if she wants to go out (ie notifying you properly). Make a rule that if she wants to go out with her friends for fun or hang out with her boy then she has to make sure her grades are up. She might get annoyed bc its something you implemented so late in her teenage years, but its something completely valid as she broke your trust as parents.

I went through the exact same thing as your daughter at age 18, the only time i was ever rebellious and it made a big rift in my family. I lied to my parents, dated a guy my parents where hugely against (and their reasons ended up being right!!), fought with them, etc. But constant communication with my ma made me understand why she did what she did and i explained to her my actions. Its a learning process and its completely normal that she had this phase. It stressed everyone out, but I'm really glad for it because it honestly helped me growing up and this revellious phase allowed me to get closer with my family with more open communication.

Also don't worry if everything doesn't get solved in one sitting. It'll take a couple sitting and maybe longer for your daughter to open up. Reassure her that you are there for her. It took me almost a year before things got settled with my family. Hope things get better with your daughter!"
relationship_advice,fnetmri,t3_g1cxzp,1586895641.0,"It sounds like he's keeping YOU as a safety plan to have constantly while he goes out and does sus shit. He doesn't want to appear taken on social media so he can keep hitting up other women. Even if its the gratification of having other people and he hasn't physically cheated, you deserve to have someone who is loyal and proud to have you. 

Id honestly look at your relationship and really see if its worth staying, or are you better off finding someone who treats you right. It's going to stress you out in the future and if his actions shows he hasn't changed, i wouldnt bother waiting.

Also you don't have to wait for him to physically cheat or for others to label his behavior cheating. You know his behavior is wrong and you can't put up with it? Drop him !!!"
college,fnddprr,t3_g0qbye,1586867391.0,"I would dorm for the first year and then live with your family the next three. You could see if you get financial aid if you're worried about the $10k. I was on quarter system so i paid $15k for 3 three quarters :'). Honestly I think the dorm experience is pretty special and memorable, so I would recommend doing it! 

Some comments were recommending it later in your college career, but I think your first 1-2 years is best. You'll be surrounded by your college peers who are going through the same thing and learning the whole college experience. It takes away that new factor if you've gone through most of college already. Also some schools only allow dorming for your first 1‚Äê2 year."
relationship_advice,fndbzx9,t3_g147m3,1586866003.0,"Honestly, I would try to have a talk with her and explaining everything you just told us in this post. I know you don't want to in fear but you won't get anywhere tiptoeing around this. You're allowed to have your own wants and needs in your relationship. it shows you do care for your girl since you're mindful of her mental/emotional state, but if she cares for you and you feel its important to you, she will understand. This will open up your relationship to more communication and you will become more comfortable with talking to her without feeling restricted. Good luck !!"
relationship_advice,fn6hmfd,t3_fzwruh,1586699523.0,"GIRL DROP HIM he obviously does not care for your feelings and your boundries. You have established that it makes you uncomfrotable and he chooses to allow this other girl into his life. Its one thing to be friends with her, but for him to enable her actions is NOT something you should put up with. 

He's allowing her to act like his girlfriend but YOU are his girlfriend. And honestly,,, even if you two were on break with plans to get back together, why would he do something that would obviously make you hurt you?? A break is something short term, and whatever you do during a break will evidently effect a long term relationship. Even if its a ""you can do whatever you want its a break"" that's honestly a load of shit.

He has lied to you and slept with her which continues to enable her actions and feelings. He wants her in his life even if it makes you uncomfortable so it shows she's obviously more important to him than you are. 

He called you immature and a bitch - don't tolerate this kind of behavior!! You deserve better !!! You already know he's stringing you along. Even if he ""promises changes"" or some shit he's not going to get rid of her. Save yourself boo and find someone who values you !!"
