UCSD,fn1bnou,t3_fyqohq,1586558697.0,"i have professor stallings. heâ€™s a gem. heâ€™s so funny and is always cracking jokes, the sapling hw is short (11-15 problems for each of the first three assignments so far and they are relatively easy questions). on top of sapling, we have weekly assignments on canvas that are timed 25 min to do in one sitting. go to lecture, you can attend either the 9:30 or the 11am, he lets you pick regardless of which session youâ€™re enrolled in (go to the 11am, itâ€™s better obv) i recommend him so far!"
