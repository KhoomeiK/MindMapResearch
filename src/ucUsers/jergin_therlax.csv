news,fp00o3l,t1_foy1m8u,1588200283.0,"As a Jewish person myself, I have realized that the insular Hasidic communities are far different than ordinary Orthodox Jews. Watching the Netflix documentary “one of us” was incredibly eye-opening. I went into it skeptical, thinking it would be anti-Semitic propaganda, but it seriously blew my mind. It focused entirely on the ultra insular Hasidic communities which shun the outside world, one of the biggest ones being in Brooklyn. They have their own set of rules and laws. They have their own schools, where people don’t learn enough mathematics or basic skills to survive on the outside (in fact, community members are told that anyone who leaves the Hasidim ends up either dead, in jail, or back in the community).

The women’s faces in children’s books are blacked out with sharpies; women are groomed to marry at 18 and bear a certain amount of children by a certain age. If there is a divorce initiated by one parent who leaves the community, no matter how much abuse and neglect is occurring by the other parent and how much the children make clear they do not want to stay with the abuser, the abuser who stays in the Hasidim 99% of the times ends up keeping the children because of one law (can’t remember the name) which applies in religious divorce cases only (actually just read that the woman from the documentary who had this happen got full custody last year on an appeal. Yay!). They also hire the best lawyers, because the entire community chips in to “save the children from evil” (seriously, even read about this in an article written by a Hasidic person who was critical of the film). 

One person in the film talks about being raped by a teacher at a Hasidic summer camp, and when he reported it was told it was because he was a trouble maker. He said that person is very likely still working there. 

Any community that adamantly tries to be as insular as possible ends up being more like a cult. It seems very likely that insular Hasidic communities fall under this category."

You’re right about that for sure, that’s a mistake on my part. 

Yes general relativity and QM disagree with each other, but they do a very good job at describing the universe at their respective scales. So, until something better comes around, scientists are continuing to use these theories as the framework for doing research in each respective field (cosmology & particle physics).

Until something better comes around, most scientists are accepting the conclusion that humans are accelerating climate change, and until a different consensus is reached, we should operate under the assumption that that one is correct.


**Disclaimer:** I know for a fact that quantum mechanics is used as the framework for almost all research in particle/CM physics, but I am not familiar enough with cosmology to know for sure if relatively is widely used. I’d do a bit of digging around if it wasn’t 5 am currently. I know there are still many unknowns with regards to dark matter, and that there are disagreements within the scientific community about how to describe it."

It was pitch black. Nothing could be seen except the blades of grass in front of us. Nothing could be heard except the chirping of crickets and the hum of the human death machines on the nearby freeway. We traveled close to human dwellings to avoid any late-night predators that could make easy work of our pack.

Emerging through an underbrush, we were met with a vast, open landscape. Darkness enveloped the path ahead. There was nothing to protect us, no landmarks to guide us to safety. We were frozen.

Suddenly, a sound. A pattering of steps in the grass accompanied by a repetitive metallic clanking. Something began to take shape in the darkness. It was massive, hundreds of times bigger than us, approaching quickly and unrelenting. Before we could move, it was right in front of us! A large, round, black object appeared inches from my face, with air coming in and out so forcefully I became uneasy on my paws. It pulled back to reveal the rest of a mammoth 4-legged creature, covered in fur and with a tail flailing wildly in the night air. 

I knew this was the end. We played dead and hoped the beast would lose interest. I felt the wet nose of the creature against my fur, and braced for my demise, but instead of a bite, I felt a nudge. 

Now on my feet, I looked around to see the creature doing the same for all my brothers and sisters. Suddenly, we were all moving, scurrying underneath the enormous creature. The beast which could devour our pack with ease was guiding us through the opaque landscape, still nothing more than a mammoth silhouette towering over us as we proceeded through the darkness. 

Before I knew it, we were safe on the other side of the plains. I turned to see the creature darting away, the metallic clanking growing fainter and fainter as the beast disappeared into the night.
