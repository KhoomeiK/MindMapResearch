AbruptChaos,fpkwx8v,t1_fpk4bb3,1588702457.0,"Nothing, that's exactly what was supposed to happen. This is a Russian special ops anti terror group practicing. I think it's basically a very large flashbang, low speed explosive. It'll stun you and hurt you, but it won't turn your insides into mush. Gives them a few seconds to run into the vehicle and kill the bad guys with relatively few hostage deaths. In the full video the bus gets stormed right after. Everyone inside the bus and the guy that set off the charge are fine."
worldnews,fp44v4f,t1_fp3zt20,1588291725.0,"I don't think their economy will do well for a decade. A lot of countries are going to have some serious conversations about bringing critical manufacturing infrastructure home. They're in for a hurt. Worse than the rest of the world, because for once they have more to loose."
UCSantaBarbara,fnt888l,t1_fnt4bza,1587236506.0,yes. the alternative is more of your classmates and their parents dead in a matter of weeks. get a grip.
UCSantaBarbara,fnsptv0,t3_g3hq3n,1587226494.0,"Everyone hates this. Nobody asked for this. Get off your high horse. If no one has told you this before, you're not special. We're all in this together. Please try harder.

Professors hate this. TA's hate this. Staff hates this. Students hate this. People that have nothing to do with this hate all this.

We're in the middle of a pandemic the world hasn't seen in over a 100 years. I know that's more difficult to comprehend when you haven't spent decades on this floating rock, but the world is not against you. This is just the world.

You got this. We got this. Please try your best. We all depend on it."

PHP,fnpkcsq,t1_fnpdsa4,1587147021.0,This is mostly true no matter how you parallelize.

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fnn2wcm,t1_fnmwz23,1587083258.0,"Thanks for doing the work, but a better driver would have slowed down on a blind turn across from a bus-load of tinies unmounting in a curve in a mountainous region.. Still he was clearly paying attention, and that undoubtedly saved the day."
politics,fnn240h,t3_g2m4br,1587082781.0,"328,239,523 million people live here (2019 estimate).  https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219

2-3% is 6,564,790 to 9,847,186

There's things I want to say about people carelessly saying things like that."
aww,fnme52j,t3_g2eteq,1587069797.0,"The kids on the right are well within air droplet range. It's cute, but it's also dangerous. Back up or wear a mask. All of you."
technology,fnll1gv,t1_fnlfzd6,1587055356.0,"It's news. With enormous technological implications. It is not literally about technology, but it will likely have more implications for technology than most things on here.

If you don't want to have a political discussion about it, then you know you have the option not too.

This will be awesome for green tech, and will likely establish South Korea as a major player in that technology market. End it there, and it's just tech news.

If you don't think it's appropriate for the subreddit, downvote it. That's how it was supposed to work.

Wag more. Bark less. Have a nice day."
CatastrophicFailure,fnld965,t1_fnkexgz,1587051505.0,"> A guy (probably from Dutch gei, ""brail"") is a line (rope) attached to and intended to control the end of a spar on a sailboat. On a modern sloop-rigged sailboat with a symmetric spinnaker, the spinnaker pole is the spar most commonly controlled by one or more guys.

I know some of these words. This sounds like describing a turbo encabulator to me.

MadeMeCry,fn4z0pn,t3_fz1den,1586652098.0,I love how gently they put the fish back in the water. They were fully aware that there was another (hover small) soul involved. This person will go on to do great things.

Veryfuckingstupid,fmrenz8,t3_fwsgwa,1586321021.0,"Jfc. In case some else doesn't know, gas stations have spill kits. Run inside and ask where it is if you don't see it. Also get the duck away from that gas puddle that's an explosion waiting to happen and you don't want to be inside that car when it goes."
UCSantaBarbara,fmgs8hz,t1_fmga2q3,1586056451.0,"So as one of those jerks making bank while this is happening let me tell you, my work load has easily doubled as faculty is transitioning to online work, I've had to send student workers into harms way to help with the hand-on stuff that needs to get done, and meanwhile my wife can't work because she's home with my baby. I still have a job unlike 10 million of others, but I'm already being told i'll get a pay cut if not loose my job by July. Yeah I'm really enjoying this vacation. F off."
