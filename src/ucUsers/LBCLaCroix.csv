ucla,fpi4tzq,t1_fpi4kxq,1588633681.0,Im with ya! Navigating the website can be really frustrating at times.
ucla,fpi4gxk,t3_gdm8if,1588633476.0,This is really unnecessary and inappropriate.
ucla,fpi2zqb,t3_gdlp6z,1588632651.0,"I have no knowledge of this but I do remember someone in this sub saying they had worked on the website when it was revamped. Hopefully they‚Äôre still around, or maybe you can find related posts through the search function."
ucla,fpi2p84,t1_fphuu5u,1588632487.0,I‚Äôm on an iPhone 8 using safari browsers. ios13.3.1. It happened with all the candidates. Thank you :)
ucla,fphu7gr,t3_gdkfxq,1588627884.0,Seems like something that should be reported to the elections board.
ucla,fphu2o5,t3_gdkkcd,1588627816.0,"Yes, I took be quite a few tries every time I tried to mark my vote."
ucla,fphfb9s,t3_gdgr4a,1588620268.0,These seems like a very professional post
ucla,fpfckv3,t1_fpfc5os,1588567361.0,Honestly after reflecting on it you're completely right. I was being blinded by my biases against the candidate. Sorry OP.
ucla,fpfayyi,t3_gd4owa,1588566128.0,"I really hope this is supposed to be ironic, haha.

If not though, I'd like to point out that time and time again that the individuals in USAC, especially those working with ""For the People"" use burner accounts to hide behind their incredibly silly posts. 

These people DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU, or else they'd attempt to have charitable conversations about their positions."
ucla,fpf9ldj,t3_gd4hhm,1588565124.0,"As a transfer myself I‚Äôm against anyone who would choose to support the referendums. 

In any case there is already a transfer rep position on the council.

EDIT: I see how I'm wrong now, ignore everything I said please. haha."
ucla,fpdrs8f,t1_fpdihwj,1588532922.0,That‚Äôs one way to lose my vote.

ucla,fpbm5qy,t1_fpbj95j,1588473223.0,The 15% refers to voter turnout. They still need a majority of yes votes to have the. referendum passed.
ucla,fpblq7k,t3_gci947,1588472935.0," People are allowed to go out for exercise, like walks. You don‚Äôt actually know whether the people in groups are family or maybe roommates that already interact with each other anyway."

ucla,fp3pnu0,t3_gb4brd,1588283536.0,Look at the posters history. Not sure if I believe this.
ucla,fp19t15,t3_gaqf30,1588228596.0,Orion is my president
ucla,fp15jmm,t3_gapr22,1588225004.0,Orion for President
ucla,fodlnfd,t3_g6xqhm,1587686227.0,No.
ucla,fo5ksuu,t3_g5u7eq,1587528106.0,It‚Äôs over
ucla,fo4314k,t1_fo412tw,1587497340.0,Why would they need to tagged if this isn‚Äôt someone who‚Äôs running for office? Seems like you‚Äôre mad that ASUCLA and CUB are being exposed.
Frat,fo40fyx,t3_g5jsrs,1587496065.0,It‚Äôs week 4 and I haven‚Äôt opened a book.
ucla,fo3vpar,t3_g5ihjv,1587493737.0,Very interesting thread. Shadier than I had initially believed.
ucla,fo3um5l,t1_fo3twfn,1587493217.0,"A black students center tells me that it will serve the needs of black students. A transfer center tells me it will serve the needs of transfer students. An lgbt center tells me it will serve the needs of lgbt student. A ‚Äúmeditation center‚Äù doesn‚Äôt tell me who‚Äôs needs it will meet, and CUB consistently avoids telling us that it is a specific religious group that wants this space."
ucla,fo3tiha,t1_fo3su2z,1587492690.0,"That doesn‚Äôt answer my question. Sure, we have halal and kosher food, that‚Äôs great! Obviously that was implemented with the Jewish and Muslim community in mind, and no one denied that. But when one specific religious group is asking for spaces to worship and expecting the entire student body to pay for it, why don‚Äôt they make it clear that this is who the space is principally being built in mind with? They‚Äôre purposefully making it sound like this is a broadly supported and needed space when it is only one religious group with the need."
ucla,fo3pvc9,t1_fo3mfql,1587490992.0,But is there actually a significant group of people outside of that religious demographic asking for this? I‚Äôm just curious to know why they‚Äôre avoiding mentioning that this is specifically being built with the concern of Muslim students in mind but making it sound like it‚Äôs something that many more people are asking for.
ucla,fo2z762,t3_g5bcsd,1587477405.0,"Another clarification. So when CUB and other candidates endorsing the referendum tell us that the money WILL secure 6 floors of space for students in this new building they‚Äôre lying? 

Because they‚Äôve all claimed explicitly that this was happening, not that it was a possibility. Would our money get students those 6 floors or simply be used to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù the administration to give us that space? Who‚Äôs to say that would happen?"
ucla,fo2y63r,t3_g5bcsd,1587476793.0,"Im curious to know why this reference to a ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù center keeps being made if this is being built principally to serve the needs one specific religious group? Thus far most of the literature provided by CUB has carefully avoided this fact. 

Why should my student fees at a public secular university be going towards providing spaces for religious services?"
trashy,fo0xyx7,t3_g52po9,1587421891.0,How do you know that they aren‚Äôt roommates?
ucla,fo00pui,t1_fnzwusc,1587404044.0,"By who? Trolls on zoom? 

To imply that students like me who simply oppose another increase to fees during a global pandemic are on the same level as the incredibly racist and disgusting rhetoric of that paper is beyond insulting. Not wanting USAC in my wallet does NOT make me a white supremacist.  Not wanting USAC in my wallet does NOT put me on the same level as the people who literally shot students because of their race. 

The people in charge of CUB and anyone defending this should be ashamed of themselves. Using black students as a shield to any criticism of increases is a goddamn shame."
ucla,fnyi4uy,t1_fnybsot,1587363801.0,"Yes, definitely! Completing the honors program makes eligible for the Transfer Alliance Program and TAG. With these programs you'd be eligible for guaranteed admission to some of the other UCs like UCSC, UCM, UCR, and more. They also enable you to pick a second major option at UCLA and CAL, so if you're not admitted for your primary choices your application is reviewed again and you have a possibility of earning admission to your second choice.

At my community college close 90% of the students who applied to UCLA or CAL through TAP earned admission, whereas non-honors students had a much lower admissions rate (which I don't remember off the top of my head)."

LosAngeles,fnt4fn3,t3_g3rgq3,1587234416.0,This is an incredibly irresponsible article title. Since when are the suspicions of uninformed people the basis of news?
trashy,fnq6xxu,t1_fnq694d,1587158855.0,The electoral college didn‚Äôt choose Biden as the dem nominee.
ucla,fnouevq,t3_g2vark,1587133793.0,Your CC‚Äôs honors program determines that. UCLA‚Äôs honors program would be completely separate from that if you do receive admission.
ucla,fnioxzd,t1_fniopkj,1586983786.0,"True, but I just feel like an organized page where they can get all the info would be helpful. In the end I don‚Äôt think it would hurt lol"

ucla,fn5kjrs,t3_fzpo51,1586667386.0,"Sounds like USAC is running a disinformation campaign to paint sensible opposition as racist and xenophobic.

As a transfer student who also happens to be gay and hispanic, not that those things should really matter, #AbolishUSAC."
