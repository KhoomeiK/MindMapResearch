Sincerely respect all the efforts you and your family have put in as Chinese American immigrants, but have you ever thought about this: these Chinese international students also struggle to adapt being away from their home, learning the hardcore knowledge in their second language? Yet MOST of them still get pretty high GPAs, MOST of them work really hard, cuz MOST of them don't want to waste the tuition money their parents spend days and nights earning. Everyone has their own struggles, and there's no free lunch ever. Money does not come from nowhere. There are certainly some Chinese international students who do not work hard as you do, but hey, don't generalize this whole group just by your personal observations on a few. Maybe you just focus too much on those you dislike? There are a large number of Chinese International students serving as TAs, tutors, why don't you try to make friends with them and tell them your story directly? I am sure they will appreciate your kindness and pay their full respect to you as well.

All the best."
