ucla,foxsxfw,t1_foxsw65,1588155172.0,"CUB Referendum ≠ Unity

CUB stands for Cultivating Unity for Bruins. 

However, CUB ≠ Unity. 

CUB supports only three communities: Black, Muslim, Transfer(kinda)

Where is the support for all other communities? This is division. 

Further, some of these communities don’t echo unity. 

The Muslim Student Association still practices gender inequality. They have separate groupchats, meetings, and events for female and male members.

This is not unity.

The transfer community does not prioritize non traditional students. This is not unity.

The afrikan student union does not support indigenous black students. This is not unity
