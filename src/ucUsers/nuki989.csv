* Fun people :)
* Professors can be really really good
* Academically driven students
* Really cool location, lots of great food and easy access to major landmarks
* Super safe area
* Good programming/clubs
* Fun EC opportunities and cutting edge research
* Megadonors for our hospital and engineering college mean that both of them are really high quality.
*  good/great amenities (pool, athletic fields, gym, library, application licences, laptop rentals, etc)
* Good rating system for professors will let you know if a professor is garbage before you enroll in the class
* Quarter System: If you are good at keeping up with a fast learning pace, you might enjoy the quarter system over semester because you will have many opportunities to pivot your interests and get through different classes. (\*see Worst)

Worst: 

* Lower division classes are a slog of work and are very professor dependent (not unique to UCLA but still gross)
* Professors can be GARBAGE
* Many people means it's harder to get resources (you have to be diligent and keep a calendar of deadlines / plan ahead)
* Bureaucracy is the bane of public education 
* Everybody is a friggin premed so those resources and clubs are the most flooded
* Quarter System: If you are not used to a fast pace of learning or have trouble with high-speed curriculum, you might hate the quarter system because it will literally wash over you like a tsunami if you fall behind or are otherwise incapacitated.

 In terms of career I think the key is mostly about building a resume and getting internships to prove that you know what you're doing and aren't just a CS wannabe.
