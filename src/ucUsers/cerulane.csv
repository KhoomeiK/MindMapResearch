berkeley,fokr7b5,t1_fokqyyf,1587847389.0,You do have experience with the course so maybe they’ll make an exception? Best of luck on your app tho :)
berkeley,fokcbdc,t1_fokc26k,1587839408.0,"CCC classes count too! I don’t know if you have access to your Calcentral dashboard yet, but if you do you should be able to check under the academics tab and on the left hand side next to “Level”"
berkeley,fokc1pd,t1_fohzj98,1587839264.0,I’m studying MCB and DS! If you want to talk to me more about what you’re interested in and the ds major/minor pathways feel free to dm
berkeley,fokbtr6,t1_fojxdds,1587839144.0,"It means you have enough units (from AP exams or other college courses) to be considered a junior or senior. If you have too many units (like 90 I think) and have not declared your major yet, you will get a hold on class enrollment but other than that it doesn’t affect too much"
berkeley,fo60gal,t1_fo5juil,1587541903.0,Worth noting that a decent chunk of classes will be online because it’s logistically easier to do one or the other instead of a hybrid :(
berkeley,fcyq8y5,t3_eji01m,1578084862.0,"I applied last year and got two emails, one titled “Resident Assistant Application Update”, and one titled “Resident Assistant Interview Sign-Up”. The first one contains the actual “we are pleased to offer you...” for the interviews. Perhaps they forgot to send out the first email? I’d suggest emailing back to make sure there wasn’t a technical error on their part."
