- ECs: Commercial pilot, treasurer for a non-profit organization, worked part-time throughout CC.

- No TAG

- Also got into UCSB, UCSD, UCSC, UCR."
UCDavis,fpin2bj,t3_gdn3qj,1588644342.0,"FWIW I've read a lot on various subreddits that UCs prioritize CC transfers before inter-UC transfers. IMO if your heart is set on UCLA, save the money and go to CC. If you come here with the expectation of getting out in 2 years you may find yourself disappointed if things don't work out (which is likely). Don't come here if you don't think you're gonna like it."
UCDavis,folq3t0,t1_fol7fin,1587867836.0,"FWIW I lived in the transfer apartments this year (also a transfer) and they were pretty clean overall, at the end of the day it'll depend on who you live with. Not sure what you guys had at UCR amenities-wise but my complex (Primero Grove) is a 5 minute walk away from the gym, but there's not much else. I've seen the other transfer apartment complexes tho and some come with pools/hot tubs and their own workout areas. 

My advice would be to do it for your first year and then make some friends before looking into off-campus housing for your second year. Most of the good off-campus housing options in Davis are gone at this point because everyone figures out where they wanna live in Feb/March."
UCDavis,foh22h2,t3_g74tbl,1587759642.0,"Yes, I some times wonder how different things might have been if I went to UCSB but at the end of the day I love Davis and I miss it even more every day I'm away from it because of this virus. I think the majority of the people here have their heads screwed on the right way and know when to party and when to study. 

I was really scared when I transferred because college life as a transfer student is notoriously difficult in terms of adjusting academically and socially, but people here are really friendly and they're always happy to help. I'm not just talking about fellow students either - I've been really impressed with the faculty (at least in my major), TAs and the number of resources available to students. Could some things be better? Yeah sure but nowhere's perfect and the grass is always greener on the other side. Ultimately, I think the school was a great fit for me."
ABCDesis,fodw4kh,t1_fodvuv3,1587691248.0,Yeah my parents weren't happy about it either but it's not like it was something they could undo so they just grumbled about it and eventually got used to it haha. I don't plan on asking for permission when I get a tattoo either.
ABCDesis,fodqopa,t3_g6vyun,1587688310.0,Currently majoring in Economics and deciding between minoring in Philosophy (Logic) or English. Ideally I'd like to go to law school after graduation.
ABCDesis,fodpdge,t3_g6xxpq,1587687592.0,"Got my ears pierced a few months ago, would like to add some tattoos as well. Probably gonna have to wait until I have some more money tho."
ABCDesis,fodp4gy,t1_fodh0j7,1587687457.0,"Might just be me but this seems to be a general trend overall that isn't necessarily Desi-specific. Most of my friends who aren't Desi are in one of STEM/Pre-Law/Finance, only one of them is pursuing an art degree (music). 

Then again I go to a big public university that has a heavy STEM emphasis, things may be different at a smaller liberal arts college."
ABCDesis,fo5pd3o,t1_fo50q5p,1587531645.0,Ask them how they expect you to take care of them when they haven't allowed you to learn how to take care of yourself (their own words).
flying,fo1y1qj,t3_g57xqx,1587444266.0,"I think you can make a lot of good connections going to a school that has a flying program, but fwiw a lot of my friends who are graduating from UND/ERAU this year and next year are very worried with how things are looking in the industry right now. A couple of them will likely have to move back in with their parents while they instruct to pay back their loans.

I think this episode was a good reminder for the newest generation of pilots that the aviation industry is incredibly fickle. People my age haven't experienced anything like this and despite being warned by a lot of older guys who were a part of the Lost Generation my friends assumed that things would be good for the foreseeable future. It took two months for the industry to go from highs it hadn't seen in decades to the shits. It'll inevitably bounce back, but nobody knows when; and who knows when things will fall apart again?

Moral of the story is don't put all your eggs in one basket. Here's another thing: this is the one time in your life that you will get to truly challenge yourself and broaden your horizons. Flying's great, but do you want it to be the only thing you are knowledgeable about? You can major in literally anything and get hired by an airline. Do yourself a favor and go to the more prestigious college (doesn't really matter when looking for a job, but it'll be a much better experience) and major in literally anything other than flying that may interest you. I've gotten all my ratings while majoring in something unrelated to flying in university and I've turned out okay. It's absolutely doable."
flying,fnph5nj,t1_fnp0e28,1587145423.0,Gonna get my CFI then go to grad school. Might as well take my time and improve on my education if this is gonna be the way of things for the foreseeable future.
UCDavis,fnpgl1s,t1_fno2k6n,1587145140.0,"A lot of people will say that things get more difficult when you transfer but in my experience the econ classes I've had here weren't any more difficult than those I had in CC. I think the biggest challenge is networking and making connections. People who have been here for two extra years will already have relationships with their peers, TAs and professors which get them research and internship opportunities. This is really important to have if you plan on going to grad school and its importance isn't really stressed on in CC. 

I'm not really sure what goes on at Berkeley's orientation, but at Davis they normally have transfer orientation in August IIRC. Other than that the best way to get a feel for the school would have been Picnic Day but that's obviously cancelled this year."
UCDavis,fno1p61,t1_fnnw1ys,1587108870.0,"- Don't be sad for the first couple of weeks when you hear parties around town but don't know anyone. Making friends/connections takes time.

- Use Google calendar and **stay on top of your shit**. Going from semester to quarter is tough, start with 12 units your first quarter to adjust. Things will happen way faster - at CC I would ditch class a lot but that shit WILL hurt you here.

- If you're from NorCal, it'll be super tempting to go home in the first few weeks. DON'T do this, try and make friends among your transfer bretheren (finding housing through SHA will help with this), go to a bar if you're 21, go to the gym, whatever. Just make sure you're in Davis for the first month at least. That's assuming the quarter won't be online of course.

- There's an event at the beginning of the year where a bunch of clubs/orgs will showcase themselves. Go to this and get info on any org you think might interest you. Maybe rush a frat even if you think that's not your scene. Or check out a sports club - I joined men's crew and it was the best thing I could've done. Made most of my friends there.

Any other questions feel free to PM."
UCDavis,fnnmzlv,t3_g2s896,1587096249.0,"Depends on the yield rate, I was on the waitlist 2 years ago and didn't get off."
UCDavis,fnmzt0b,t3_g2prte,1587081423.0,Congratulations! After 2 quarters (lol) I couldn't imagine transferring anywhere else personally.
ABCDesis,fnjs525,t3_g2010b,1587005728.0,"In addition to the cereal, a lot of candy we get here isn't available in India. Anything Wonka-related, Pop-Tarts, etc. Honestly whatever you can buy at a convenience store likely won't be available in India (other than Snickers) lol."
ABCDesis,fnjrwjv,t1_fnirid0,1587005572.0,Oreo officially launched in India a few years ago IIRC so it's way easier to get.
UCDavis,fniy8v4,t1_fnezv5h,1586988504.0,"I had a couple professors who would write their notes out as part of their lecture. I found that to be way more preferable because the pacing was suited towards note-taking, as opposed to PowerPoints where the professor spends 20 seconds talking about a slide with a bunch of information on it and moves forward before you can finish taking your notes. I also thought it was a great way to keep me engaged instead of listening to someone read off a screen for an hour and a half."
UCDavis,fnildk9,t3_g1pibb,1586982009.0,"Sucks so much as someone who transferred last fall. I seriously hope things begin to open up at least towards the end of fall quarter so I can enjoy what precious little of the college experience I have left. 

I was just beginning to enjoy my time here too ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜­"
ABCDesis,fnfwrwy,t1_fnfu1ib,1586917129.0,*Insert angry response feat. the OkCupid statistic which reaffirms my belief that my struggles in the dating scene are based on my skin so that I don't have to actually confront the fact that I haven't taken the necessary effort one has to put in to have success with women*
ABCDesis,fnfg32z,t1_fnepi8t,1586907378.0,"I'm genuinely curious does Bangladesh have a lot of cultural diversity? Not trying to come off the wrong way, I think I'm just surprised because it's a small country that's mostly inhabited by a large ethnic group who follow the same religion."
UCDavis,fn8zeum,t3_g0bjz0,1586754536.0,"You're not entitled to anything. Not just from UCD, but from life in general. All you can do is work harder next time.

I hope you get something out of community college and go to a good school at some point but being salty isn't a good look."
Games,fn7glg5,t1_fn6sp9t,1586719919.0,80 on Metacritic is considered mixed now?
UCDavis,fn1esdc,t3_fyr14p,1586560507.0,I know quite a few people who have transferred despite missing a class or two but it really depends on how important the class is for the major and a variety of other things. Been a while since I've gone through the process but is there any way to update your grades after the TAU deadline passes?
ABCDesis,fn194wq,t1_fn13x3o,1586557262.0,"If I'm going to date someone I sure as hell hope that their reasons for dating me go beyond ""I like Indian dudes"" because otherwise that's just a recipe for a disaster. Having a type is okay, but something as frivolous as race shouldn't have any bearing on who you date and if it really matters so much to someone then I just assume they're superficial.

Last time this happened to me I was six months into a relationship when my ex told me that she has only dated Indian guys in her life and that she wants to marry an Indian dude because ""they're just really hot"" to her. Having someone say that to you feels fucking weird man, it's like who you are as a person doesn't matter and that the only reason they dated you is to satisfy this weird sexual urge they have to pursue men of a single race. I don't see them as any better than people who avoid other backgrounds. It's still shallow, just in a different way. 

And please, I don't buy into the whole woe-is-me disadvantaged Desi guy thing, and I say that as a dude. There are plenty of Desi guys out there with game."
ABCDesis,fn0p7a6,t1_fn0k31c,1586546121.0,"Media isn't representative of real life. There absolutely is a fetishization of Indian men in the dating world just as there is for every other race. While it may not be as common as other races, it absolutely does exist. Any Indian guy active in the dating scene can attest to having met girls who exclusively date Indian men ""because they like their skin tone""."
ABCDesis,fmz25a1,t3_fy5j3s,1586503540.0,"I'm proud of my Indian heritage, sure. At the end of the day though, I will always identify as an American.

I'm genuinely curious how you identify as a Pakistani without having lived there ever? You might speak Urdu and marry a Pakistani girl and all that but I can assure you that nothing about your upbringing is going to be similar to someone who spent their whole life in Pakistan. If you were to go up to someone who was born and raised in Pakistan and told them you were Pakistani I can assure you that you'd get called a foreigner (don't know what the Urdu equivalent of *firangi* is). 

Just imagine if a person of Irish or Italian descent in the United States went to one of those countries and did the same thing, kind of obnoxious isn't it?"
ABCDesis,fmynf3o,t3_fy1x7h,1586490474.0,"Yeah seems like this author is just talking shit to get clicks, nothing in the article seemed remotely racist or weird. He's a good looking dude and people found him attractive without mentioning his race. I would've assumed that this is what every non-white person in a Western country should hope for. 

I think it's especially unfortunate that she latched onto this non-issue when there's definitely a debate that can be had on the fetishization of Indian men. It definitely isn't the case here though."
ABCDesis,fmwstiv,t3_fxlukg,1586452408.0,I couldn't quite catch the spot where you stopped wearing earrings lol. Or did they just become less visible?
Gamingcirclejerk,fmptyr7,t3_fwf9yj,1586287290.0,"Recently I started got in contact with an old friend from my community college after he followed me back on IG. Five minutes into our conversation he starts talking about ""building a personal brand"" and networking and stuff. Now I had no idea wtf a personal brand is but after doing some research and talking to the guy I honestly thought I was losing my mind. 

Every single thing he posts on his social media is thoughtfully and carefully curated. The ""candid"" pictures, the caption, the hashtags - and the only end goal for him is to ""expand his network"". I only realized how deep the rabbit hole went when I stumbled upon some stuff on r/Entrepreneur and discovered that people will literally date the people they date for the sake of that sweet, dank corporate clout. When they volunteer it's not because they want to do their part, it's to look good for some company. Their ""friends"" are all chosen with the sole purpose of being a part of some network.

It all made me kind of depressed honestly. Are we really living in some American Psycho-esque capitalistic hellscape where humans have dissociated from their own emotions and feelings just to have a chance at getting a job?"
flying,fmfthje,t1_fmfs0ag,1586034508.0,IIRC the controller who was responsible for this was murdered by a father who lost his wife and kids in the crash and he was later applauded by the Russian public for doing so. The whole thing is really sad.
