Short answer, checks don't clear immediately.  However, there's a law that says the bank has to make some portion of the funds available to you immediately.  They will no doubt ""send"" you too much money and ask you to cash the check and send some of it back as opposed to voiding the check and sending you another one which is what a sane/non scammer person would actually do.

Eventually the check will bounce/be fake/not clear and you'll be out the money the bank advanced you.

Also real jobs won't:

Not have you fill out tax forms.  
Pay you huge sums of money to do super simple tasks.  
Immediately send you money to order supplies as opposed to ordering the supplies for you.  
Not perform in person interviews.
