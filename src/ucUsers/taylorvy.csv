BreakUps,fp8x9mq,t3_gbslec,1588406224.0,"I definitely know how you feel. I’m struggling to be ok with how I reacted as well. What I learned is though, you need to forgive yourself for acting that way in order to really move on. Sure, you messed up. Sure, you could’ve acted a lot better, but you know what? You acted that way because you were scared to lose the love of your life. It’s hard to remain calm & act in the best light when something as scary as that is happening right before you eyes, so it’s human nature to act like that. Forgive yourself for being human :)"

relationships,fnyhymp,t3_g4n79x,1587363650.0,"If you want to hear about their day, see them smile, or really just to see them grow into a better person, it's love. If you just want to do physical things with them, it's lust. It's cheesy, but so true; when you love someone, you'll know. You won't have to wonder.

When you love someone, you can love them from afar. It doesn't matter if you're together or not, you still love and care about them. Lust is more possessive, it's ""I have to have this person"". Just an FYI, it's def. hard to differentiate the two in a relationship because you can love them, but also never want to let them go, so *in a sense,* it's kind of possessive. You know what I mean though."

Really listen to what he keeps bringing up about work or his errands, & then do them for him. If he's been stressed out at work, make him a care package that not only includes his favorite snacks, but also, helpful things such as: stress gummies, a journal to vent in, a cute/motivational note, etc. If he's really busy, but needs to run errands, do them for him such as: wash his car or help him do his laundry. When it comes down to it, it's the little things that people notice!"
