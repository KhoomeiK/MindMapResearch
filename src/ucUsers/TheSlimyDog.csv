pokemon,fpciply,t1_fpcbkbc,1588502008.0,ORAS was a really solid game in my opinion even though it doesn't hold a candle to HGSS. The series really peaked between Platinum to BW2.
csMajors,fp5in4q,t3_gbev3f,1588330744.0,"No. If they worked last year, they'll work now. The only issue is if the projects are too old, then it might be hard to answer questions during interviews."

madlads,fp1ayo0,t1_fp199bt,1588229613.0,What's the default though? I think you're giving teachers too much credit for how much they care about the zoom settings.
cscareerquestions,fp19bso,t1_fp032p4,1588228178.0,I don't know an awful lot about the dot com bubble but isn't this pretty bad too? Companies have billion dollar valuations before they even have a path to profitability. This is coming from someone working at one of those companies.
madlads,fp18vzp,t1_fp17iyt,1588227793.0,Really? By default a random person becomes host when the host leaves. What do you use?
Android,fp02ld9,t1_foylt1k,1588201304.0,I wonder if Google has technical reasons that they can't move fast or if they just make brain dead decisions like this because they think it's smart. Every product and new feature doesn't need a 3 week rollout.
LivestreamFail,foxmviz,t1_foxhtut,1588149101.0,A competent engineer should be making between 70k and 200k depending on where you live. And having enough money to live while also having time to spend on side projects and gaming is pretty amazing.
cscareerquestions,fowelax,t3_g9y1ap,1588118262.0,"Those are two very different jobs and very different situations. It comes down to your preferences. Staying with family will save money and be more convenient but it might get tiring if you want independence. Also, the technologies that you're working with are different too. Which ones do you prefer?"
ucla,fowcea9,t3_g9ig3u,1588117070.0,"The worst part of 35L never was the projects or classes in my opinion. I did learn at least something from that. It's the fact that Eggert can't make a class without an exam that's needlessly hard. And unlike his other classes where at least he's lecturing so you can apply material you learn to the exam, here, the lectures teach you nothing but you're still expected to take an exam as if you've mastered the content."
cscareerquestions,fov3s09,t3_g9rb23,1588094908.0,Thanks for creating this. I'll try making interview problems that don't conform to this framework in the future.
RocketLeague,foq2s5q,t1_footzkl,1587980897.0,You mean they only did this commentary for the final? Not for any of the playoff matches beforehand? That makes no sense...
cscareerquestions,foq1wqg,t1_fopyead,1587979982.0,The hunters that I know always cook and eat what they kill. I don't know if many people just throw away the dead bodies to decompose after killing them.
Cubers,fopzw94,t1_fopgt3z,1587977894.0,"Your justification probably makes sense to yourself but you have to understand that if it's something that people won't get unless you explain it to them, then it's probably not a good justification. I think it would have been better to just keep the x-axis scale uniform and cut out anyone who doesn't fit in the range."
cscareerquestions,fopw31k,t1_foprmmm,1587974070.0,"Deers aren't exactly endangered and the permits for hunting help in other ways. If you eat meat the  you've indirectly murdered tons of animals. Hunting just takes out the middleman. I don't think it's the best hobby in the world and I don't partake in it, but you could be more open minded."
LivestreamFail,fopvlvx,t1_fopsvwq,1587973611.0,"Google the lyrics. It takes 10 seconds and will save you a ton of time in the future as well. The song title is literally the donation message.

csMajors,fod65ex,t3_g6vbtx,1587680555.0,"Given the current situation it probably won't look that bad. If you're applying to grad school then it will matter more. The industry doesn't care enough to look at your actual transcript. If they ever ask, it's just to confirm that you attended the college and didn't lie about GPA."

LivestreamFail,fnwg7qb,t1_fnt3q64,1587317783.0,I've only seen clips of her like this so I feel like it has to be an act. No one can be this insane.
Android,fnqfu1t,t1_fnpwbqi,1587163771.0,More like maybe one day all the cars will have seat belts like Apple. Until then I'll just duct tape myself to a chair.

AskReddit,fno99fe,t1_fno6ao3,1587116940.0,"I'm not saying that kids are a huge challenge but unless your 1 year old is doing the dishes and cooking for you then you would probably have more work with kids. The way you made it sound, you were super busy before having kids but then you had kids and then had a ton of free time. Maternity leave?"
AskReddit,fno5yqb,t1_fnnyldz,1587113325.0,I watched some of his newer short videos. They're genuinely good content. Not super interesting but also not the trashy daily vlogger type stuff that other people put out. It seems like he's stopped chasing money and clout like he did before. If he's starting to run low on cash he just sets up another boxing match instead.
AskReddit,fno5t0p,t1_fno2ezh,1587113153.0,You're the first person I heard say they had *more* free time after having a kid. How did that end up happening?
cscareerquestions,fnnrfm0,t3_g2rbnz,1587099563.0,"What did you try doing before giving up?

I find it hard to believe you learned all those algorithms but then fail to Google how basic IO works in Java? That's the first thing that most CS classes start off with. I'm not saying you should know it off the top of your head but it's something that you should be able to implement after looking at the syntax once.

The only thing I can imagine is you're overly reliant on solving problems that you've already seen before and you're memorizing algorithms. I hope this isn't the case, but if it is then you really have to fix it. Even in the comment, you just asked people how they would solve the problem without even explaining what you tried."
AskReddit,fniha5s,t1_fnhc9x6,1586979976.0,"Do you understand how insurance, liability, and negligence work? I don't fully understand it either but I at least know that any logical business owner cares about their employees wellbeing enough to not get them killed (doesn't mean they'll pay them well). Knowing this, why would you still stick with your original opinion?"
ucla,fnigrq8,t1_fng0274,1586979724.0,Sounds like extra hoops for students to jump through under the guise of security. I've seen other zoom meetings that were set up to lock out users without a ucla email. Not sure why they couldn't do that.

Android,fnhqe7h,t1_fnex8b5,1586967033.0,Google's way better than that. The have 2 paid interns and an L4 mentor working on it.

blackmagicfuckery,fn1trk8,t1_fn1mzcb,1586569913.0,But how is that a balk. I don't see how that tricked anyone...
ucla,fn0yflb,t1_fmyktmg,1586551194.0,"Club funding is cool but it's a real pain to get and having seen how it's done at other schools UCLA should be ashamed to say they support clubs. A lot of the funding we had came from our own money.

Free printing is ok but that's a stupid defense. We give you $240 and you give us $10 of printing credit.

Are you telling me those lounges and study spaces would crumble if it weren't for USAC? 

I attended Bruin Bash twice in my four years and neither time was particularly fun. Ever see how many people leave early? If I could have my $240 back I would much rather prefer to go to a proper concert.

Please do go on because so far your top reasons have yet to convince me that USAC has done anything that warrants the amount of funding they get.

I think the only decent thing they have done is create jobs but there are much better ways to do that."
CrazyIdeas,fmwuwzl,t3_fxt7uf,1586453470.0,There are separate places where conservation and breeding efforts take place. Zoos are meant to fund those efforts. If they closed zoos for a month that would be 1/12 less funding they have which means you'd probably end up worse off.
cscareerquestions,fmkbds0,t1_fmi4q3d,1586149596.0,I feel like it's both. CTO of a 4 person company is very different from CTO of a 40 or 400 person company.
