UCSantaBarbara,fpat6fv,t1_fpasyu7,1588455191.0,"If there’s an actual name for the phenomenon idk what it is lol. I said that the aqueous and organic layers didn’t cleanly separate, it’s bad, and you can wait, swirl, or add salt to fix it"

UCSantaBarbara,fpaiprb,t3_gcbv4g,1588448996.0,Idk I don’t really mind that the quizzes are so hard because we’re all graded on a curve so it doesn’t matter if I get fucked by a quiz. If the quizzes were easier it would be really disheartening bc if the average was like an 85 I’d feel like there’s not much room to beat the curve. This is coming from someone who has gotten absolutely ruined by every single quiz lol

UCSantaBarbara,fp7j2iy,t1_fp767cr,1588371560.0,"There are a few houses that host local bands, there’s usually something every weekend. If you follow the bands on insta they’ll post where/when they’re performing. Dudeo Perez, Sitting on Stacy, Careless Cub, Pancho and the Wizards, Playyard, and Strange Case are a few to start with"
UCSantaBarbara,fp7goo2,t3_gbomqn,1588370283.0,Does anyone know how they’re planning on housing all the freshmen then? Unless they have a ton of extra housing a good amount of freshmen won’t be able to get a spot because usually most freshmen normally live in triples right?
UCSantaBarbara,fp01st3,t1_fozyzhv,1588200883.0,"Finding someone you can live with is way more important than finding someone you want to be friends with. A lot of people choose their roommates that way and are super hyped about getting to live with them but end up hating them once they have to be around them constantly. When I was a freshman people were constantly moving around because they couldn’t get along with their roommates. 

It’s obviously ideal to get someone that has similar living habits as you that you also really like, but don’t get too caught up on finding someone like that. Try to focus on people’s sleeping times, how often they want guests in the room, and whether or not they’re alc/420 friendly. Also try to pick someone that will be willing to compromise, some people will still act like the room is only theirs even though it’s shared.

I’m not trying to say that there’s no chance you’ll find a good roommate who can also become a close friend though. I’m super close with my roommate and we’ve lived together since freshman year, and I know a lot of other people who are still friends with their first year roommates. You just gotta focus on the important stuff first."
UCSantaBarbara,fowc49q,t1_fow8h5o,1588116921.0,"If you don’t sign up for orientation you’ll choose your classes after everyone else but you’ll still be able to get your major classes because they reserve spots for people who don’t go. You’ll probably have about the same luck with getting into GEs you like as if you signed up during orientation. My roommate did that her freshman year and she was able to get everything she needed. 

The orientation staff actually is pretty helpful because they’ll explain what classes you should sign up for, how to sign up for them etc. If you talk to someone who went to orientation or a current UCSB student you can get the same info though."
UCSantaBarbara,fosvkmb,t1_fospuki,1588038945.0,If you google “ucsb academic unit profile” and your department you should be able to find the info
UCSantaBarbara,fosui9y,t1_fosu2ra,1588038316.0,"I’m pretty sure you can take chem pass no pass even if you’re in the bio department. The email said “if another stem department such as Physics is allowing some S20 prep courses to be taken either for a letter grade or P, and you opt to take it P, the biology program will honor that P as applicable.”"
