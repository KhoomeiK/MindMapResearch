calculus,fphcn2c,t3_gdfs1r,1588618899.0,"the first calculation seems to assume that if you cut the cone frustum along x = 0.5, both halves are the same volume. that's not the case when integrating via the disc method. as your radius goes up linearly, each disc area scales up quadratically so a midpoint average will be off, but by a very small margin in your case; because your limit of integration is small compared to what you're actually integrating, the nature of the integral will almost be linear, rendering the average radius calculation to be really close but not totally correct. your integral calculation should be correct, though."

calculus,foyyz7y,t3_ga35l8,1588181780.0,"So as you stack on more and more Taylor series terms, the resulting polynomial will become closer to the actual function cos(sqrt(x)) (provided you are in the radius of convergence, which I would assume yes). Then it follows that if you integrate the Taylor polynomial w.r.t. x, the result would be the (almost the) same as integrating the original function. Once you've gotten some polynomial P(x) as your integral, then it boils down to simply taking P(1) - P(0), but you will only need the first few terms for an accurate estimate as the other ones quickly become negligible thanks to the 1/n! factor."
