navy,fplgrn4,t1_fpjp4qv,1588712424.0,"Like most stories about tacticool origins of Navy uniform items, it's not true. [The crow was not changed ""to face the enemy"".](https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/u/uniforms-usnavy/petty-officer-rating-badge-locations-and-eagle-designs.html) (see: 13 buttons for 13 colonies, ignoring that for the vast majority of US Navy history, it was either 15 or 7, and not 13)

If it was ""to face the enemy"", why did left arm rates have a left-facing crow? 

>

>The uniform regulations of 31 May 1941 specified that the eagle was to face to the left in the rates comprising the Seaman Branch: Boatswain Mate, Turret Captain, Signalman, Gunner's Mate, Fire Controlman, Quartermaster, Mineman and Torpedoman's Mate. All other rating badges were to have an eagle facing to the right.



I would think that a GM or a TM, of all ratings, would be the ones to face the enemy in WWII. Left-facing during WWII literally only meant that you were a GM, BM, TC, SM, FC, QM, MN, or TM. If it was right-facing, you were one of the other ratings. That's it.

>Right arm rates were disestablished 2 April 1949, after having been eliminated by Change #1, dated 24 February 1948, to the 1947 uniform regulations. All rating badges were to be worn on the left sleeve with the eagle facing to the right.

Note that the entire Navy shifted to right-facing in 1949, which is years after the war was already over."

Prior to the Bush/Gore election, it wasn't uncommon for *Republicans* to be blue because, you know, the Union soldiers wore blue in the Civil War, and the Republicans were kind of riding high on that whole ""we won the Civil War"" thing. Until the 1980s or so, Democrats were often portrayed as red. Red has a strong association with left-wing politics worldwide, partially due to Socialist and Communist movements adopting red. After that, it was just kind of a crapshoot. Red could be the incumbent, or they could be blue, or whatever. Some networks showed Ross Perot votes in yellow. It was just to show a difference in the vote, not necessarily to represent a particular party. Many networks alternated red-blue every four years to avoid incumbent favoritism. 

In 2000, the contentious election caused people to coalesce more firmly behind color banners, and the current ""red=Republican"" color scheme came around. Many networks coincidentally used blue for the incumbent party as they had for many years, and since Bush was not the incumbent party, there were a bunch of networks that showed D=Blue. Following the 2000 election, the current red/blue assignments became set in stone."

AskReddit,fp2x2zn,t1_fp24jjt,1588269332.0,"That's not what the advice means. Basically, it's saying that you have to learn to code switch.

If you're hearing a phrase in Russian, translating it to English, formulating a response in English, then translating back into Russian, you're doing too many steps. You just need practice.

 The point isn't to tell new students that they have to somehow remember the new language they're learning without memorizing. It's to encourage fluent code switching. You still have to learn the words and grammar, but the point is to encourage you to not actively think about them. Rather, you should be trying to speak the new language the same way you speak your native language.

For the first six months of learning Russian, I did Russian to English to Russian until one day I noticed that I was no longer going into English at all. My inner monologue changed from English to Russian, and I started hearing and speaking Russian, but I had to translate from Russian to English if I wanted to say something in English.
