I would like to take this opportunity to say I'm intrigued to see how far 24 gets, considering that it had literally almost nothing to do with sports.

It's always made me laugh that he made that for SB (**SPORTS** BLOG) Nation, but I definitely enjoyed it (that is, I shall refrain from casting my vote against it for the time being).

Some quick researching told me that this was done so the Union Jack didn't take precedence over the two other flags (those of Afrikaner proto-states; the Afrikaner-led government of 1928 and Afrikaners in general were deeply resentful of the British and the inclusion of the Union Jack in their flag). But I can't help but think how utterly ridiculous the flag looks with the Union Jack faced the wrong way. I know most folks wouldn't take a second glace at it or notice it, but to me, as a fan of flags, it is very annoying.

But all I hope is that the powers that be (which in this case, I believe, are the Regents) understand that the continuation of online distance learning could be quite harmful for many parties involved (facility staff, professors, TAs, and students both graduate and undergrad). 

This shift has taken a great toll on all of us. Socially, mentally, academically, emotionally, in every way. I think the course we are on now is unsustainable, possibly even for another quarter. People may be accepting of these changes now, but that's because we were told they'd be there for only a very short period.  

I think if we continue on the current course of reduced rates of new cases (and if future predictions about conditions allowing for a gradual reopening of society to occur remain true), the Regents ought to strike a middle ground between life as it was before (which is dangerous) and life as it is now (which is also dangerous, but in another way). Khosla said there are ""multiple models"" (whatever they are, I'd love to know). Maybe one of those other models are the way to go.

I suppose this answers another question that I had about why, in light of limited free speech and expression, why didn't South Africans (the ones who could vote) utilize the franchise to 'kick the bastards out', so to say. I suppose they had no reason to abandon the Nats in their view.

> As Afrikaans speakers, (and many other languages) we were kept relatively unaware of the worst excesses of Apartheid. 

I figured that's why there was very low intensity and scattered opposition to Apartheid until the situation began to really destabilize in the late Eighties. As an interesting side note, I was watching some Apartheid-era SABC news (there's a good bit floating around YouTube) and even though large parts of it was in Afrikaans (a language I admittedly don't understand beyond 'Ja', 'kak', 'Suid-Afrika', and 'jou ma...'), you certainly didn't get the sense that it was news from a country where Blacks **VASTLY** outnumbered Whites or was as far removed from European/White civilization as can be. You don't exactly get the sense that this is news from a country in the depths of Africa and is ever steadily approaching a racial civil war. The Nats' attempts to keep its voter base (or Whites in general) in the dark seemed to have been incredibly successful (at least until the late '80s)

This is a wonderful answer. Really helps with my understanding of the mentality of the average White Saffa from that era. Thank you very much."

We're all suffering from the pandemic and the quarantine.

> Do foreigners know nothing about South Africa except apartheid and racism? 

The tragedy here is that the answer there is probably ""Yes."" Whenever SA is presented in foreign media, it is almost always in the context of apartheid and Mandela, where the whites are almost always the villains. Of course, the truth couldn't be more different, but foreign media (which is how most of us are introduced to SA) sadly doesn't care about the plight of SA after 1994 (although there was a brief moment of renewed interest when you guys had the FIFA World Cup 10 years ago). That's why I roam this sub even though I'm about as far removed from South Africa in terms of where I am and my cultural background. I quite enjoy the jokes about the horrid incompetence and corruption of your political system (the ANC especially) and Eskom's never-ending failure to deliver and all of the little insights to your culture (like braai, for instance) because I think that represents what SA's all about.

This is a very interesting answer.

>They also are doing a significantly more number of cash grabs from the viewing audience than the American one did. 

I think that's just because (if I remember correctly) ITV doesn't really put much money into the prize fund. The vast majority of British *Millionaire*'s prize fund comes from people calling the premium-rate line to try to be on the show. I think 100% of ABC *Millionaire*'s prize fund came from ABC, which in turn comes from advertisers. Plus ABC makes hundreds of millions of dollars, so giving away $30 million or so over 3 years is no big deal to them, I'd imagine.
