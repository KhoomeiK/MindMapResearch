BlackPeopleTwitter,fn5vj5x,t1_fn5s6yq,1586677377.0,Didn't realize we should let artist abuse people multiple times before we see them for who they really are
BlackPeopleTwitter,fn5v55l,t1_fn5py9h,1586676983.0,How can you seperate an artist who sings about love but then goes and beats women??
wholesomememes,fmz9eh5,t1_fmz84wk,1586511621.0,"You sound pretentious. Yeah maybe it was a very detailed and angry response, but I do think they are allowed we're on reddit a place where people can rant. Not only that what they said is very true and a good ancedotal as to why what the og comment or had say was wrong. Just because you have found your peace with your past doesn't mean you can shit on people who haven't. Like they said your comment isn't gonna help their mental state so all you're doing is being a pretentious ass who thinks they're better."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fmz2cdf,t1_fmxvbax,1586503746.0,What don't you understand? How many times do we have to repeat we don't mean them being naked. We are talking about comfortable home clothes that is often sexualized by creeps. Like shorts and yoga pants.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fmz1xbw,t1_fmxqcg5,1586503312.0,"They pointed out a pattern and you went and said single mothers don't care, presumably meaning all single mothers. You'd get crucified as a misogynist everywhere bc thats just not logical, there are so many good single mothers. But like every group of people there are bad apples."
UCSantaBarbara,fmy2q68,t1_fmxjxdl,1586476862.0,"Hey first off everyone was ripped from the atmosphere that allowed for that education. Their support, place of education or study are closed. Many like myself are forced to move back home where I can barely have 2 minutes of peace and quiet to study. On top of that profs are doing tests and readjusting every week or not and saying suck it up. To top it off were getting lesser version of education at the same price. Let people rant and realize that you're probably on the lucky end of the spectrum."
GusAndEddy,fmpr57r,t3_fwoghg,1586285823.0,That's not a boys support boys move and I'm dissapointed
UCSantaBarbara,fmizjgl,t1_fmiwfnq,1586120048.0,Just look at Snapchat of people in IV I've def seen it. People just aren't on the streets but in their backyards
