I imagine you could probably get an analyst job with just the DS 100 stuff, but honestly I can't say for sure.

I would say CS 189 is probably more theory than we looked for.  If you're able answer questions about how to implement the algorithm from scratch, that's a good start.

I recommend this post which is a review of some of the science related to the manifesto:

https://heterodoxacademy.org/the-google-memo-what-does-the-research-say-about-gender-differences/

The takeaway at the bottom is ability gaps are small to nonexistent, but

>Gender differences in *interest and enjoyment* of math, coding, and highly “systemizing” activities are large. The difference on traits related to preferences for “people vs. things” is found consistently and is very large, with some effect sizes exceeding 1.0. (See especially the meta-analyses by Su and her colleagues, and also see this review paper by Ceci & Williams, 2015).

I don't see any reason why we should treat these meta-analyses as being any different than other psychology meta-analyses.  You could argue that the entire field of psychology is pseudoscience, but that seems like a rather extreme & unsupported claim.

You could also say that all the meta-analyses which support your position are quality science, and all the meta-analyses which disagrees with your position are pseudoscience, but that seems more than a little intellectually dishonest.

Anyway, differences in interest & enjoyment are what Damore emphasizes in his memo.

In my opinion that memo is really overblown.  /u/CuckooHash implies that Damore's manifesto says women have brains that make them less-suited to be engineers than men, but neither the word ""brain"" nor the word ""suited"" appear anywhere in the manifesto, which you can easily [verify for yourself](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf) with a quick control-f.  I'm not sure which passage /u/CuckooHash has in mind for their claim.

BTW, Damore also talks about how he thinks diversity & inclusion are valuable and he wants women to feel more welcome in STEM, and gives some ideas for that... but the internet outrage machine and its 10-second attention span just don't care."
berkeley,fp7lng5,t3_gbpw4i,1588372971.0,"I used to interview people for analytics positions and data 100 skills are extremely relevant.

One caveat: I took an early version of data 100 at Cal a few years ago, and for the version of the class I took, they didn't really actually teach you pandas or SQL.  You just got a lot of homework problems which required pandas or SQL and you sort of had to sink or swim figuring out how to answer those problems using Google etc.  Most students were able to do that without a ton of difficulty, including me... *however*, in retrospect, I really wish I had put the time in to actually developing strong mental models of what was going on with pandas.  Think that could have really helped with my interview skills.  As always, getting an A in the class (as I did) is not necessarily an indicator of deep understanding.  Pandas is 100% something you are liable to be asked about in analytics / data science interviews, and there is a big difference between the level of Pandas that lets you fumble through homework problems vs having truly mastered that fucker.  It doesn't even take that much extra effort--just step back and reflect once your code is working to make sure you understand what it's doing, create a cheat sheet for yourself (or even find a cheat sheet online) that you can review right before an interview, etc.  And whenever Pandas does something you find counterintuitive, understand why and make a note of that so it won't trick you again."

I did flirt with some women in the CS department, but only if I felt like they started flirting with me first (though I'm not necessarily the best judge of these things).  (I actually had a female project partner for one of my projects that I met while I was out drinking on a Saturday night... we had a semi-flirty working relationship which did not prevent us from getting top marks on our projects.

However, if I'm following this correctly, RNA-rich foods lead to high levels of adenine & guanosine because those are non-uridine components of RNA?  So supplementation of pure uridine would not do this?

I searched for keywords related to uric acid and uridine and found some interesting stuff:

>Plasma uridine was significantly higher in patients with gout than in normal subjects. It was also significantly higher in patients with gout of the overexeretion (of uric acid) type than in those with gout of the underexcretion type.

So if successful people tend to have gout ""of the overexeretion type"" (as opposed to the underexcretion type), perhaps gout's effect on success is mediated via plasma uridine?  (Did I use ""is mediated via"" correctly)

[Another study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470512)

Another weird puzzle piece is that uridine is allegedly destroyed by the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and yet there are studies which show it works for things (and I found the Mr Happy stack worked super well for me--kinda doubtful it's placebo, because I tried a lot of other supplements which didn't have the same effect, and the Mr Happy stack has been fairly reliable whenever I use it)."

It's interesting how Klein silently assumes that a call to build means the government specifically should be doing the building.  And not even the government but the federal government specifically.  I think John Arnold makes a great argument that infra should be handled at the local level:

https://twitter.com/JohnArnoldFndtn/status/1123555510727389186

I'm less interested in hearing about federal government dysfunction and more interested in learning why infra seems to cost so much in the US compared to other countries.

Also, if the country is polarized, I feel like that is actually kind of a decent argument for government inaction.  If we can't agree on what to do, why should the government do anything?  Why not let private actors act?  As Klein puts it:

>But legislators on both sides prefer the status quo because it gives them power when they’re in the minority, and because they’re more afraid of what their opponents might do than committed to what they’ve promised to do. The allure of what they could build isn’t as powerful as the fear of what the other side may build.

I don't understand why devolving control to local governments or private action by individuals/corporations is considered a bad solution to that problem.

Why not more companies like Uber or Airbnb that just flout the regulations until they become established?

Why not just get a bunch of used shipping containers and build a new city in the middle of nowhere using robots?  I'm sure there are states like Texas and New Hampshire that would let you get away with it.

Now is a great time to build the city of the future, actually.  Build a new city that is specifically designed to be COVID-resistant.  Build using robots so your workers don't infect one another.  Restrict immigration heavily and test everyone who wants to come live there, use [far-ultraviolet light](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pgSKdPwDbG5EppRFC/ubiquitous-far-ultraviolet-light-could-control-the-spread-of) everywhere, etc. etc.  Make the city entirely self-sufficient, with hydroponic gardens so it doesn't require imports from regions which could be affected by the pandemic.  (Did you know that the Netherlands is the #2 global food exporter due to their advanced agriculture tech?)

Build the city around self-driving cars.  Electric self-driving cars, of course.  Max 5 gas stations in the entire city.  When you arrive, you put your gas car in the garage and switch to self-driving services for the duration of your visit.  The self-driving cars get cleaned out using far-ultraviolet light between uses..."

>The CARES Act signed into law by President Trump on March 27, 2020, gives states the option of extending unemployment compensation to independent contractors and other workers who are ordinarily ineligible for unemployment benefits.

From https://www.dol.gov/coronavirus/unemployment-insurance

>You are eligible for a PPP loan if: (i) you were in operation on February 15, 2020; (ii) you are an individual with self-employment income (such as an independent contractor or a sole proprietor); (iii) your principal place of residence is in the United States; and (iv) you filed or will file a Form 1040 Schedule C for 2019

>In addition, you should be aware that participation in the PPP may affect your eligibility for state administered unemployment compensation or unemployment assistance programs,
including the programs authorized by Title II, Subtitle A of the CARES Act, or CARES Act Employee Retention Credits.

Look at the amazing success the CCP has had lifting a billion people out of poverty.  Look how they've handled corona way better than the US.  Is it possible that we are the ones blinding ourselves in this case, thinking that more citizen participation in government is always a positive even if it works out less well for citizens?

I'm an EA, and above all I'm a pragmatic welfarist.  I think democracies usually work better than dictatorships.  I think whether a country is a democracy vs a dictatorship probably explains some nontrivial amount of the variation in citizen welfare.  But I don't know if all the data agrees with those intuitions:
