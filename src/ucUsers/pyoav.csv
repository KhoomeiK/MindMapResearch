LSAT,fpkneea,t3_gdzmd6,1588697746.0,"what I don't get is why this matters to you? what's the difference if someone scores a 170 with literally zero prep or a 170 after one week of looking over some examples? you take it as fact that the test is so inherently niche/convoluted, but you never consider that some people may just find it not that convoluted and can score well cold. that doesn't mean they have a formal background or have studied extensively, it's just subjective"

changemyview,fo5khom,t1_fo5i87o,1587527878.0,"relax. I'm not attacking anyone so there's no need to defend. I'm not invalidating a distaste - by all means you have every right to dislike and like whichever politicians you want! I'm just saying that if you truly believe trump and Biden are equally bad for the environment, voting rights, immigrant rights, women's rights, healthcare reform, -insert many other issues here- then you have a fundamental misunderstanding of where they each stand on the issues. you can dislike them both without them having to be equally bad. I dislike mint ice cream and I also dislike vanilla ice cream. mint is not the same as vanilla."

JoeBiden,fnqlcum,t3_g38ul1,1587166927.0,I think Warren is a fantastic pick but I don't think Biden will choose her unfortunately because he's made it clear that's its important that pres and vp be ideologically close. she may be able to deliver that key demo of suburban white women that don't always turn out but did in 2018 midterms and brought us the house.
