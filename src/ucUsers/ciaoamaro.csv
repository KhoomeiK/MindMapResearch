AmItheAsshole,fpn0tk7,t3_ge7xqy,1588746873.0,"YTA. You literally got the mother of the daughter you say you care so much about as far away from you as possible all bc you were thought you would only see your daughter 1-2 times per year. You do realize that it's more likely Maggie wouldn't be able to move that far bc of custody laws, and the nothing you could do to stop her was probably her heat of the moment bluff. Your daughter will not be able to see her mother anymore (unless you take her to that country), so your 1-2 yearly visits pales in comparison. This was such an extreme and cruel option there's no way you can do this out of love for your daughter."
AmItheAsshole,fpjc8sr,t3_gdpeba,1588663310.0,"ESH. Grandma shouldn't abruptly decide to not cook dinner if there is no alternative plan for the 5 year old to eat. Once gf found out about her mother, she should have thought of what to do for her daughter. Grandpa seems like one of those useless types. You, however, are not exempt from this. On what planet is it okay to let a 5 year old that you know and care for starve??? It seems like you're frustrated with the arrangement/involvement for your bf's kid, and I get that, but not letting her eat your food (and thus no food) was a shitty way to deal with that. If you're that upset, go talk to your gf. Letting the kid starve won't resolve anything, especially as it seems the mother doesn't care too much about her kid to begin with. Omg she's 5, and you've become a parental/family figure to her, so yes she's gonna want your food and only your food. That's how little kids are. How hung up are you about the proportions of your food that sparing half for a kid is unjustifiable??? You could easily have made yourself something else after if you were still hungry."
AmItheAsshole,fpilcj4,t3_gdihtr,1588643304.0,"This is probably unpopular, but I'm going with ESH. I don't think I need to go on about how your daughter was wrong for stealing and lying. But your wife is right that y'all have some partial responsibility over what happened if you two never really taught her internet privacy/protection. A lot of people are saying that school does teach these things, but at least from my experience (I moved schools a few times in elementary and hs, different districts too) the different topics and extent of each of those topics varies on the school when its non academic subjects, so it's possible that her school never covered enough on sketchy websites or that even her own friends shouldn't know her parents credit card number wasn't a lesson. And given that she was asking her friends how to use the credit card, I think she genuinely didn't know about the risks with what she was doing. Yes, she should be punished for the lying and stealing, but banning her from the internet doesn't teach her how to be responsible and smart on the internet. A better option would be restricting her internet for a few/several weeks, but also allotting some time each week to show her how to purchase things on the internet, how to tell when a website is sketchy and to be avoided, what private details to not share with strangers and even her own friends, etc. This has to be a learning experience too and not just punishing her for the sake of punishing her. And you can't make the punishment too hard either, bc all she'll learn is that she just needs to be more sneaky. And do compromise with your wife on this, bc y'all have to be a united front otherwise she won't take this seriously."
AmItheAsshole,fpijx57,t1_fpihcsc,1588642447.0,"But what about the day she gets her own credit card or her parents stop be there when she uses theirs to buy something? She still needs to know about proper internet and financial safety. I don't disagree that stealing was wrong, but she still needs to be taught internet safety, and saying that had she not stolen the credit card doesn't mean that this issue would never happen in another form."
UCSC,fpihyyw,t3_gdc8lq,1588641289.0,"I'm positive it will be online. If there is any form of social distancing, lectures halls won't be able to hold classes. Some classes, such as intros for popular majors, need hundreds of seats, so those would be online. Only small classes would be able to be in person with that, but people will complain that they will need to be here in person when other people don't have to, and if they only need to be back in Santa Cruz for one class, that will cause a lot of anger (justifiably). Hybrid would allow the UC to make money, but people would rather LOA or defer than be back for one class. And then you add housing into the mix. Admin already announced it might not honor housing guarantees- letting people know last minute (bc this situation is still unpredictable) that they can or need to come back will be more frustration and lessens the possibility for them to come back. And if social distancing is still present, all campus rooms will remain as singles, so it's not like the school can accommodate potentially all the people who would/need to come. And of course, if covid is still present in fall, does the school really want people from all over the state, country, and even world, mixing and potentially causing an outbreak on campus? There's no way the healthcare in this city could accommodate that."
AmItheAsshole,fpbmx5k,t3_gcbwaw,1588473735.0,"NTA. Sexism isn't just calling women stupid and weak, it's also not allowing or embracing people to do things in stereotyped gender roles, i.e. girls working on cars. Him hiding from others for \~years\~ your hobbies and passions, as well as something that really bonded you two, is a huge asshole thing to do. Him not letting his coworkers think that your brother was into ""geeky"" stuff instead of typical ""manly"" stuff is also hurtful to your brother. Yeah, your dad wasn't trying to be sexist, but it's still what he did. It's not okay for him to basically hide who you two were for the sake of maintaining an image or to save him from humiliation. As a parent, it's his job to support you two."
ResidentAssistant,fpbhlg3,t3_gchlwc,1588470192.0,"Definitely the usual why do you want this job, what past experiences you have had that make you qualified, what are your strengths and weaknesses. Depending on your school they might ask a question about social justice/working with diverse groups. My school would also ask how to do we plan to build community, and something related to our time management skills. 

Things to flex: being an RA is being a mentor/advisor so talk about your experience on campus with resource offices, student orgs, etc to show you're knowledgeable on  resources that can help students. When talking strengths, that's a good place to discuss relevant experience you've had and transferable skills. There isn't a one response that they're looking for with most of the questions, so try to be creative."

Also, just bc OP is a SAHM doesn't mean she can't or shouldn't run, everyone needs exercise. And likely prepandemic, she could run while her kid was at school. But oh look, schools are closed now, so she has dad look at kid for a bit so she can tend to herself bc she needs someone to cover."

AmItheAsshole,foxnjtx,t1_foxi7ql,1588149762.0,"It's not so much the rules themselves but the fact that the mom's bf came in and decided those were the rules on his own. OP's mom parented differently and okay her bf wants to be involved as a parent, but he has to acknowledge that he would be (bc he hasn't married the mom yet) at most a stepfather to a near adult. And he has to work up to that level, he can't impose himself like that. When parenting they have to be a united front, which they're not and probably why it's not effective. Again, with OP being nearly an adult I'm not surprised she still wouldn't want to adhere to new rules, and that's valid. It also says a lot if bf's own kids don't want to see him though."

And I'm doing this with a class the department has recognized as suitable for other majors within it, including the one that is really similar in terms of degree requirements. And given that other people have tried to do this, it's not uncommon and seems that others feel as though the department should make a change to the degree requirements for MCDB."
AmItheAsshole,fotoekx,t3_g9g0or,1588060433.0,"NTA. You were super pregnant and acted like a super pregnant woman did. And not to say that everything a person does bc they're pregnant excuses them from AH-ness, but you were provoked. And even if you weren't pregnant, the comeback for being made fun of for something physical you can't control is typically with something physical they can't control. Your body does some pretty ""gross"" things when you're pregnant, and that makes a lot of people insecure. But the father of the child you are pregnant with shouldn't be arranging for your public humiliation on those things. Feel bad for your SIL bc that was a little harsh."

I don't know why you wouldn't put your AirPods in the case or by your phone or something better than sweatpants on the floor, but your gf even asked you before if she washed the pants if she could wash them. That's your moment to grab your AirPods. And you made an honest to god mistake to forget them, but so did she when didn't check your pockets. I get your pissed, but bro this is  more your fault than it is hers (wouldn't be if she grabbed your pants w/o your permission). Now you're screaming at her to immediately hand over $250? If she doesn't have the money, she doesn't have the money. That is a legitimate excuse. Screaming at her more and louder still doesn't make her suddenly have the money. She didn't even object to repaying you in full. At most, she could pay you half, but even that's a stretch considering this is mostly your fault for being so irresponsible with such an expensive item. Lastly, if you really wanna compare your gf to a some laundromat service, just stop being in a relationship and find someone you could pay to talk to you."

AmItheAsshole,fookw9j,t3_g8f8ph,1587941006.0,"This was hard, but I'm going to go with ESH. Kate was being a huge AH for all the arguments when this was something out of your control. But the reason you look bad to everyone about the promotion was bc you did lie to your SO- about finances. It seems that even before the promotion you already knew that you no longer wanted to be in a relationship with her. And that's valid (finances are the number now reason for divorce anyway), however, the whole ""I'm going to wait to tell her to see if she will be supportive"" is you essentially testing her. Once, you're in mature adult relationships, the whole testing/proving of your SO's loyalty, trust, etc. has got to go. You did lie to her at the end, and people will call you an AH for that."

And bc bio already requires so many classes, you'll likely have to do a summer or 2 if you want to graduate within 4 years.

That must be absolutely devastating and I can't imagine him reacting any other way than locking himself in. I'm glad that he's the guy who wants to be there for the birth. Nonetheless, it is your medical procedure, and if him being there will stress you more, even for a bit, it's okay to not want him there. You need to be doing what is best for your and your babies' health. But please be sure to talk it out with him, and reassure him that he is still the father, this doesn't affect him being there for his kids in the future, and he isn't any less of a parent for not seeing that. I know you're going through a lot, but this is a lot for him too, and communication is really important to getting through this."
AmItheAsshole,fnymzw6,t1_fnwy37o,1587368310.0,"YTA bc you don't know what's good for your daughter. Ex1: this comment \^. You literally respond to someone's mention of a fact about teenagers with a comparison of your current (aka adult) self. Your daughter is 13/14, she does need good sleep as she is still developing. You are an adult, so you can still function on those hours and that sleep schedule. Also, just bc you are doing that doesn't mean its best thing for your health either. And Ex2 is your original post. It's one thing to want her to challenge herself and have her options open, but you are not doing anything of that sort. She doesn't want to go to college? Ask her why. Believe it or not, not wanting to do to university is valid (and I'm a college student before you call me a bum). You didn't use this opportunity to discuss with her realistic goals and plans for her future, and are giving her an all or nothing for something you want (I saw your comment about not going to sign her classes paper). And if you didn't discuss her future with her in a mature way bc you don't think she's capable of that discussion, then I don't know why you want her to go to college that bad.

I'm sure your daughter was less upset about your sister being invited bc she had an addiction, and more so that she got into a PHYSICAL alteration with her husband. Hell, I'd be concerned if someone who had a physical alteration was at my wedding. Others have pointed out that $10k for a wedding is cheap, and its true, but whatever price you chose to pay doesn't grant you authority to her wedding. As for the bridezilla comment, this is what truly makes you an AH. Of course your daughter is furious you said that, bc even tho you only ""told one person"", they likely told other people. This type of comment coming from the bride's MOTHER makes people think its true (assumption is that as the mother you are more involved in the wedding planning than them so you see more and your comments are ""more true""). I don't know if you said it before the wedding or after, but either way people now think she was less of the beautiful bride than she actually was. Oh and yes, just bc your sister wasn't there, doesn't mean that inviting her was not an issue. Your sister wasn't there for the reason why your daughter probably didn't want her at the wedding in the first place. Your sister could not have been arrested the weekend before, and at the wedding instead. Just think of how your daughter would have felt if that happened. And you still called her bridezilla smh."
