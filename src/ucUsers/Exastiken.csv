> 
> Orange County leaders are pushing back against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s decision Thursday to temporarily close all beaches in the county in response to the crowds that gathered along the shore last weekend.
> 
> Photos of crowded Orange County beaches went viral over the weekend, prompting Newsom to note that beachgoers who ignored the state’s restrictions could prolong the spread of the coronavirus in California and put the well-being of others at risk.
> 
> During his daily COVID-19 briefing in Sacramento on Thursday, Newsom commended other counties, including Los Angeles and San Diego counties, for their leadership in keeping people off their beaches during last weekend’s heat wave. However, he said the images circulating of Orange County beaches were “disturbing.”
> 
> “I just think we could tighten that up a little bit, and so we’re going to have a temporary pause on the beaches down there, state, local beaches,” Newsom said. “We want to work very closely with local elected officials, and we’re committed to doing that and if we can get some framework and guidelines to get this right, we can reopen very, very quickly. But we’ve got to, we’ve got to make sure we get this right.”
> 
> A memo sent Wednesday evening to California police chiefs indicated that the governor had planned to go further, closing all state and local beaches and parks. In response to that memo, Orange County Supervisor Don Wagner released a statement hammering the plan and saying the idea of closing the beaches was unwise.
> 
> “Medical professionals tell us the importance of fresh air and sunlight in fighting infectious diseases, including mental health benefits,” he said. “Orange County citizens have been cooperative with California state and county restrictions thus far. I fear that this overreaction from the state will undermine that cooperative attitude and our collective efforts to fight the disease, based on the best available medical information.”
> 
> Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Michelle Steel called the governor’s decision an overreaction and an abuse of power. She said she would be “looking into an appropriate response” to the situation.
> 
> “I trust our Orange County residents to make good choices — wearing face masks, staying six feet apart and staying home when they don’t feel well,” she said in a statement. “We have here an opportunity to embrace personal responsibility while also taking care of our neighbors. Governor Newsom clearly doesn’t share that faith...”
> 
> Some Orange County officials said images circulated last weekend painted a distorted picture of what conditions were actually like at the beaches. Huntington Beach police spokeswoman Angela Bennett said officers did not issue any citations last weekend.
> 
> Authorities were on the beach patrolling and educating visitors all weekend and found that the majority of people were staying in their own groups, officials said.
> 
> “The vast majority of people were social distancing at our beaches,” Bennett said.
> 
> In neighboring Newport Beach, Police Chief Jon Lewis and Fire Chief Jeff Boyles said in a joint statement Thursday that there were some clusters of people who were crowded too closely together but that “it was our personal observation, and that of our officers, that the overwhelming majority of Newport Beach residents and visitors were families or practicing social distancing.”
> 
> The agencies also shared aerial photos captured Saturday afternoon that showed sparse crowds on the city’s sandy stretches.
> 
> Newport Beach City Councilwoman Diane Dixon called the beach closures “a clear abuse” of the governor’s power. She added that the decisions made by cities across Southern California were “prudent, carefully thought out and in the public interest.”
> 
> Newport Beach officials had put in place plans to increase public safety staffing and enforce social distancing and other public health measures in an effort to allow people to enjoy the beach while still stemming the spread of the virus.
> 
> “The governor reportedly was angered by misleading telephoto pictures in the news, and reacted hastily without consulting local officials on the ground,” Dixon said. “It is painfully clear that the governor is making decisions based on politics and personal pique instead of fact. The state’s role should now be coordinating the process rather than dictating it.”
> 
> San Clemente Mayor Pro Tem Laura Ferguson contacted the city manager and city attorney Wednesday night after she heard about Newsom’s proposed directive to suggest that they review what legal authority the governor has to close city beaches.
> 
> “I’m hoping the governor can cite some valid reason under case law to be doing this to cities because, in my opinion, it appears to be government overreach. Local beaches are under the control of the cities, not the state,” she said.
> 
> After a roughly two-week closure, San Clemente reopened its beaches last weekend with the stipulation that visitors would be permitted only to run, walk, swim, surf or partake in other activities along the coast. Sunbathing or sitting on the sand was not permitted. City leaders are expected to take up reopening the beaches entirely in the next few weeks.
> 
> In nearby Laguna Beach, officials on Tuesday moved to reopen their coastline for limited hours during weekdays, beginning Monday. Now it appears this will not come to pass, officials say.
> 
> Laguna Beach City Councilman Peter Blake said that, while he understands Newsom’s action, the move “comes at a point when it seemed like we were on a trajectory to move forward and this now moves us back.”
> 
> Blake said he was supportive of closing the beaches when COVID-19 was beginning to take hold in California. However, he said, the latest effort by the governor appears to be a power move more than a reasonable step toward reopening the state and restarting the economy.
> 
> “There are people that, rightfully so, feel Newsom has gone beyond the scope of his authority and has taken on power that is not outlined in the [California] Constitution,” he said.
> 
> Laguna Beach Mayor Pro Tem Steve Dicterow supports reopening beaches on a limited basis. But he said that crowds like the ones seen in neighboring cities last weekend were exactly what prompted the city to shutter its beaches roughly six weeks ago.
> 
> “This is not a time for politicizing things. This is not a time for divisiveness,” Dicterow said. “If the governor believes this is the best thing to do for the state of California, then we need to follow that.”

worldnews,foknl7r,t1_foknby4,1587845437.0,"> TAIPEI, Taiwan — The part-owner of a Hong Kong bookstore specializing in texts critical of China’s leaders reopened his shop in Taiwan on Saturday after fleeing Hong Kong due to legal troubles, saying he was grateful for the chance to make China's Communist rulers “less than happy.""
> 
> The opening and accompanying news conference came days after Lam Wing-kee was splattered with red paint by a masked man while sitting alone at a coffee shop in Taiwan. Lam suffered no serious physical injuries and showed little sign of the attack other than a red tint to his hair.
> 
> China’s leaders don’t want to allow a bookstore selling tomes that would “make them uncomfortable or impact on their political power,” Lam, who moved to Taiwan a year ago, told journalists.
> 
> He thanked supporters in both Taiwan and Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, for the opportunity to start over. “This makes (China’s leaders) less than happy,” said Lam, who raised nearly $200,000 through online fundraising to finance his new venture.
> 
> Commenting on Tuesday's assault, Lam said the Communist Party appeared to think it could stifle the shop’s business in both Hong Kong and Taiwan by using “underhanded methods of all sorts.”
> 
> However, on a slightly pessimistic note, he added that China’s policies had left little room for idealistic young Hong Kongers other than ”into the big sea.”
> 
> Lam was one of five shareholders and staff at the Causeway Bay Book shop in Hong Kong, which sold books and magazines purporting to reveal secrets about the inside lives of Chinese leaders and the scandals surrounding them.
> 
> Along with others, he was taken across the border and put into Chinese custody in 2015, but was released on bail and allowed to return to Hong Kong in June 2016 in order to recover information about his customers stored on a computer.
> 
> After refusing to return to China, he went public with accusations that he had been kidnapped and brought to the mainland, where he says he was interrogated under duress about his business. Following the detentions, the shop was forced to close while edgy political texts have largely disappeared from mainstream book retailers under pressure from Beijing.
> 
> Lam moved to Taiwan last year amid fears over proposed legislation that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to China, likely face torture and unfair trials. Concerns over the legislation, which was later withdrawn, sparked months of sometimes violent protests in Hong Kong, a former British colony that has retained its own legal, political and economic system after being handed over to the mainland in 1997.
> 
> Hong Kong police last week arrested 15 prominent lawyers and opposition figures over their alleged involvement in the protests, prompting further concerns that the city's civil liberties are being eroded by China’s increasingly stringent political controls.
> 
> Although claimed by Beijing as its own territory, self-governing Taiwan, with its flourishing democracy and robust defense of civil rights, has become a safe haven for critics of the Chinese government.
> 
> Two high school students who turned out for Saturday's event at the minuscule shop on the 10th floor of a business building in Taipei’s Zhongshan District said they saw its reopening as a sign of both hope and defiance.
> 
> “It offers Hong Kong people a safe place to develop,” said one of the students, Hsu Shih-hsun.
> 
> Taiwan's own experience with dictatorship and martial law under Nationalist Party leader Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to the island with his government ahead of the Communist takeover of the mainland in 1949, adds special resonance to the values the bookstore represents, said the other student, Wang Tsung-fan.
> 
> “I think that this bookstore coming to Taiwan makes us Taiwanese extremely proud. We can give Hong Kong a helping hand,“ Wang said. “After all, our own freedoms were not easily won.”"
