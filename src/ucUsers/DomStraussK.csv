So, you've gotta remember that in med school admissions, you're not just being compared against your classmates, but against the \*national\* applicant pool. And there are many, many more applicants from other schools than your school. Like, the Yale applicants aren't primarily being compared against other Yale applicants, but rather against Yale AND ASU/Penn State/Indiana/UCLA/whatever. So like, insofar as say Yale has better resources for its undergrads than those other schools, you'd rather be there. I think medical school admissions rates from various undergrads will bear this out: Harvard performs better than \[state school\]; even though XYZ Harvard applicant may be ""average"" for Harvard, that student is ""excellent"" compared to everyone else who's applying to say, UCLA Med.

So, no, it's not disadvantageous to go to a ""better"" school; putting aside the brand, the school probably has more research opportunities, etc for students. The one exception, I think, is perhaps ""prestigious"" schools with relatively large student bodies and tons of grade deflation---think some of the ""public ivies."" But I don't see that as an issue at Penn/Stanford/Rice.

Maybe your question is more ""would Rice be 'easier' than Stanford,"" and like I really don't think so? As I said before, ASU would probably be easier--the average GPA/SAT score/etc of an ASU student is substantially below that of the average Stanford student. Very different class profile.

But this is Rice. It's a really good school known for its pre-med program. I know you got an award and everything, which is awesome, but like, in terms of ""class competition"" is there a difference between a Rice pre-med student and a Stanford pre-med student, in terms of how hard they'll study for their chem classes, how smart they are, etc? I don't think so. There are tons of valedictorians, god knows how many kids got 800s on SAT Math + subject matters, etc."

   3. Actually, a Stanford student with an otherwise identical GPA/resume/whatever would be looked at, realistically, slightly-more favorably because Stanford is a more selective institution, and MBA admissions officers care about that at the margins. They're prestige whores too.
3. If you apply to Haas for an MBA (or for law school), you'll get a bump as a Berkeley undergrad.

So this is a hard question that frankly, I don't feel particularly well-equipped to answer. I just don't know a ton about their non-engineering STEM undergraduate programs. Intuitively, I'd say that Harvard's is more well-regarded, because its graduate Physics program is one of the best in the country.

But I'm not sure if that matters much?

High school seniors (in this subreddit, for example) talk a lot about a school having ""a great XYZ program,"" but they're really referring to the *graduate* school. Which like, is not usually super relevant for undergraduates. For example, Berkeley has a fantastic graduate Economics Department, Physics Department, etc--as good or better than the top Ivy Plus schools. There are grad students who would choose to do a PhD in Econ or Physics at Berkeley over a Harvard or Stanford. And that would make sense.

But like, that doesn't mean you should choose to do an *undergrad* in Economics at Berkeley over an undergraduate in Economics at Harvard. For undergraduates, what matters isn't the reputation of the specific major, but the *undergraduate school as a whole*. And obviously Harvard's undergraduate school has a better reputation than Berkeley's. Berkeley is great, but it's not Harvard. No one would dispute that.

To give a concrete example: Prior to law school, I worked at an investment bank, and we analysts would handle the summer internship recruiting. So we'd get all these resumes, and we'd be reviewing, deciding who to interview, and school prestige absolutely mattered. If you went to Harvard or Stanford or whatever, you would have a *much* better chance of getting an interview than say, Boston College. Major prestige wasn't a factor--like I have no idea if Boston College's Poli Sci program is fantastic. I just know Harvard is a lot more selective than BC, and so the students are on average sharper/harder-working/whatever, and so we'd rather interview a Harvard student.

Now, I'm not sure what your career goals are, so I'll caveat this by saying:

* Engineering is slightly different, i.e. some schools have undergraduate programs that are better-regarded than their non-engineering, and people who hire engineers know about those programs (Again, Berkeley is a good example; if you're an undergrad studying computer science and want a job at Google, Berkeley's brand is right up there with Stanford and MIT's)
* I know nothing about PhD admissions, and maybe there the specific undergraduate major reputation matters a lot. (It doesn't for business/law school, though.)"

* I wouldn't make ""prestige"" really a factor -- this is HYS. They're the best. There are no doors that Harvard would unlock, because it's prestigious, that Yale or Stanford wouldn't, because they're not.
   * Cornell and Brown are second tier Ivies; if you were completely indifferent between Harvard and one of those, you should take Harvard--perhaps there are opportunities that the average Harvard undergrad gets that the average Brown undergrad wouldn't
   * That said... it doesn't apply here, because Harvard-Yale-Stanford are three of the four best schools in the country. I am (a) under 30, (b) worked on Wall Street before moving on to a top law school, so (c) am very aware of the undergrad prestige-whore pecking order, and (d) never heard the ""Yale is less prestigious than HS"" thing after I was 18. Yes school prestige matters in the ""real world,"" but Yale is right there with HSP at the top. (Their alumni will be happy to remind you of that :))

* If you want to do computer science/something in Silicon Valley, or live in California after graduation, take Stanford and don't think twice. It's the gold standard. If you don't, would focus on the other two--you'll see a lot fewer Stanford alumni on the East coast.
   * Regarding sibling admissions: Perception has always been that Stanford is just as ""good"", if not more so, than any of the Ivies. Wouldn't worry about it.
* The real Harvard/Yale dynamic I would focus on is culture: The (very superficial, but seemingly accurate) bit has always been that Yale is more relaxed, undergraduate-focused, and Harvard is more internally competitive, graduate-school focused. (Culturally, Stanford is probably the most ""fun"" of the three.)
   * If you can, I'd visit Harvard-Yale again to get a better sense of the campus environment. Ask students what they do on weekends, what their classmates do on weekends, etc
* Boston is fun and New Haven sucks, but in some ways that's a good thing for Yale, because it keeps the Yale students together. Can't over-emphasize this: You \*want\* to get to know your classmates. 
   * Take Columbia for example--yes being ""in New York"" is cool, but it also means that the undergraduate community is not as tight-knit. People go off to do stuff on evenings and weekends.
   * Dartmouth is probably the most extreme version, at the other end: No one leaves campus because there's nothing to do...but that's kind of nice, creates a really intimate campus environment."

Same was true for my athletic male Asian friends -- they got dates with everyone. Conversely, there are tons of white guys who look like shit and never got anywhere.

**So, if you're a guy, of any race, who wants to date better, it can't hurt to start a quarantine workout :)**"

Columbia will be good; you can get there from all of the T14, so the ""best"" school in your situation will turn on the financial aid packages and relative rankings of the schools you are admitted to.

For example, UChicago has better placement in Chicago, but if you were admitted to Harvard, maybe you'd say ""it's ok, this is Harvard, it's my dream, the cost of attendance is similar, and plenty of Harvard students to go Chicago firms every year."""

And look, I did non-NY COA, am (mostly) happy with it, but if a 3L today asked me for advice, I'd tell her that SDNY/EDNY is much more useful. And if this hypothetical 3L didn't want to leave the the NY area to clerk, I'd advise her to wait.

You shouldn't spend a year in a place you don't want to live for the like, intangible credentialism benefits you get from having done a COA clerkship. If you can get the clerkship, you don't really need a credential boost -- you were likely near the top of your class at a good school. Just wait a year; it'll strengthen your application, and you can clerk for a good judge without upending your life.

More people than you might expect end up regretting clerking (even for ""good"" judges), and geography is a part of it. (The other is the judge his/herself -- separate issue.) You commit way in advance, then subsequently like, life intervenes: Family member gets sick, you get in a new relationship, you realize you could have got a clerkship closer to home, etc."
LawSchool,fnhtscy,t1_fnhlwdw,1586968713.0,"I mean, yes you named two conservative feeders, but I think most CLS/NYU students would rather start at their firm and try to do a NY-area district/COA two years later than clerk for almost any CA5/6/7/8/10/11 judge, or any of their associated district courts.

LawSchool,fnf5g0x,t1_fndbbj8,1586901743.0,"If your firm will commit to hiring you as an associate, this could be a really great deal.

But I would not jump into this part-time law school thing without making sure that the degree will get you a job as a lawyer. Some/many of these programs are, frankly, scams; they'll take all your money and then no law firm is actually hiring from them.

I think a lot of people who are looking at part-time JD programs look at them like part-time MBAs, but that's a bit misleading. Those programs aren't as fancy as full-time MBAs, but they're ok because they serve a different purpose: People go evenings/weekends (frequently with their employer paying) to learn something new, network, and secure a promotion. You miss out on some of the recruiting at the full-time programs, but that's OK, because maybe you're not really looking to switch jobs.

A part-time JD mostly isn't like that. You want the same thing as the full-time students: A job practicing law, which you currently don't have. So if the part-time JD programs you're looking at don't get their employees jobs as lawyers after graduation (check the employment statistics on the school's website), make sure that the firm you're at will commit to bringing you on as a lawyer. 

Otherwise you might be sinking a ton of money in for a very expensive piece of a paper."

But you're not; UCLA/UCI will look at you as they would any traditional applicant.

Anecdotally, a CLS/NYU student is pretty unlikely to apply to district courts outside of SDNY/EDNY. They'll look at it is ""look I'm not leaving NY, I have a firm job here, I can just reapply to SDNY/EDNY in a year if I get dinged, with a stronger application."" Other T14 students, who are gonna have to move anyway from say, Cambridge or Charlottesville or Ann Arbor or w/e, don't view moving to another weird location for a year as much of a problem, which creates more of a ""apply everywhere"" mentality.

Like, Yale has the largest clerkship/""true"" PI contingent in the country, and the average is still $120K a year.

If you're at $75K average, it's because your students aren't getting BigLaw, not because your school is even more PI/clerkship-focused than Yale."
LawSchool,fncc0cc,t1_fmsy7a7,1586833140.0,"Under no circumstances should you sacrifice your GPA to study for the LSAT, or like anything, really, if you want to go to law school. You can study for the LSAT after college, and you can retake. Your GPA is set in stone once you graduate. The difference between a 3.6 and a 3.8 is tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars in financial aid/admission to a T14 and a mediocre school.

My advice:

1. If you can take community college classes over the summer that count towards your UCSD/LSAC GPA (verify with LSAC that they'll count for law school admission, but I think they do), I would abuse that, liberally, until you graduate. Like, take a number of them. Doesn't matter what the class is, really, as long as you get an A.
2. If you can't do the above, take easy UCSD summer classes. Psych 1, Soc 1, whatever. Doesn't matter if it's relevant to your major, schools don't care. Again, make sure you get an A.
3. If staying an extra year at UCSD is financially doable and your GPA isn't where you want it to be when you graduate, double-major and do it. 
4. Find an LSAT study plan. I'm sure various Reddits have them.
5. Follow it, and grind -- BUT NOT DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR.

If you have to take a gap year after graduation doing some BS job and studying for the LSAT before law school, that's fine, plenty of people do that. Your work experience doesn't really matter for admissions, and again, the difference between a 160 and a 170 is worth a \*shitload\* of money.

My s/o got 1 A-, total, in 4 years at her Ivy. Got her a free ride to every non-Harvard/Yale/Stanford law school. And she had plenty of fun in college. Focus on the GPA. You have plenty of time for the LSAT."
LawSchool,fnca6br,t1_fmxkz9i,1586831969.0,"It's pretty good but if you want BigLaw in LA, you're better off at most of the T14. There's a sizable minority of UCLA students that want BigLaw and don't get it. That's why they take firm jobs that don't pay market.

If you're at, say, NYU, and want to practice in BigLaw in CA, you have a better chance of doing it from NYU than you do at UCLA. Because say, 30-40% of the class at UCLA is in danger of getting disqualified from BigLaw entirely because of their grades, while very few NYU students are.

It's unfair, but firms have much lower GPA cutoffs for top law schools. At an NYU, all you really have to do is (a) not fail and (b) be semi-normal in the interviews, and you'll get a BigLaw job. And if you're deliberate about seeking out CA law firms, you should be fine for the West coast market."
