Yes, it is different from others since we don't just memorize stuff in ppt slides to ace the test. But he does provide lots of resources like recording OH, reading guide, etc... If we dont have time to attend OH/discussion, then we still can post our questions in the discussion board. It is kinda confusing b/c of reading many opinions from classmates and Sato doesnt always give a straightforward answer, but I think it helps us thinking rather than knowing. It is true we dont have the answer key for post quiz or practice exam, but it is still possible to look for them through discussion board (there's always someone posting their answers and we can check with them). The only thing I dont like is that there is no recording for discussion. 

I know this is a difficult time for everyone, but we can't just expect it to be an easy class."
