UCSantaBarbara,fpmf75k,t3_ge6px1,1588731754.0,how do people that have their housing contracts already signed feel? Like are y’all stressed? Will you stay for fall if it’s online?
gardening,fpmehae,t1_fplehxr,1588731310.0,The Netherlands?! How wonderful! What’s the weather like where you live? It’s good for gardening  I take it
UCSantaBarbara,fpm6vs5,t3_gdqjdv,1588726777.0,"I’m not saying how or when they should speak out. I was saying that if all these people knew, like the IVP , that these allegations were present why were they never brought to the police or the school board(or whoever handles it I’m not sure) attention? A student running for office, and actually already held office, that has these allegation and it took for AFTER the election for them to be relevant? I’m not mad that they’re being brought up or anything but it’s more like the way it’s being handled is more focused on “why hasn’t he made a statement “ or some like that instead of WHY ISNT THERE AN INVESTIGATION?! Why is nobody calling for an investigation? And why in his statement did he say that “the false allegations” had been resolved or some already? I’m not saying he couldn’t be lying but that was some I wondered like okay then what happened with this situation that we don’t know about? Anyways, my point is that they(IVP) need to be more focused on calling an investigation instead of what they’re doing by calling for another election or whatever they’re even doing which doesn’t seem like much. FYI, I heard about these accusations back in I think January or February from a friend and still nobody figured it should be brought to anybody’s attention ?  Idk . I didn’t vote for the guy anyway."
California_Politics,fpkukk2,t3_gdz6pk,1588701289.0,"this is so stressful being a student. I understand this is an unprecedented situation and what not but some of us have classes that need to be taken IN PERSON. This whole mess is making people fall behind not being able to take those courses, and then on top of that some of us have housing leases in our college town where if it’s online will practically be a waste of money if there isn’t in person classes...I mean if I only have one in person class and am still having to pay the same amount for tuition that seems extreme..."
UCSantaBarbara,fpkj7z4,t3_gdqjdv,1588695661.0,"I was wondering the same thing. This a pretty serious situation and deserves an investigation which they aren’t even calling for. They’re like oh why hasn’t he addressed these allegations and blah blah blah...it’s like he won’t be able to win whatever he does. Supposedly he already resolved these false allegations  or something so it’s like idk what these people want . It’s just so annoying they’re always like believe survivors believe survivors, which I agree with and if the survivors felt so strongly about it why didn’t they take it to school officials that a student officer had assaulted /harassed them?! I just don’t understand, especially since that supposedly IVP KNEW about these allegations BEFORE the election even started and didn’t let him run in ivp so it’s like where were they then? Why didn’t anybody say anything before the election?! And now there’s a whole new Instagram called ucsb transparency made a couple of days ago like give us a break"
foodstamps,fpc44fl,t3_gch6fm,1588486972.0,"hold on now, what exactly are you saying? you received your Calfresh benefits on 4/28 and then it got refilled on may first? I recently got mine and they’re doing an additional ~$338 for the month of April (and then may will come may 10th I believe) so if you have additional money it could be because of the pandemic bill that passed which added additional benefits"
UCSantaBarbara,fp713xq,t3_gbnfaw,1588362140.0,"I really do need to take my chem labs so I’m not behind but at the same time , I’m going to be returning to school and be spending thousands of dollars on housing just to have that one lab?! I understand it’s a difficult situation but the UC may be needs to consider other options of letting students take labs at MAYBE a CC or something for just this once, I know that probably isn’t possible but I don’t know what to say like learning stem classes online is hard enough , I already got my chem 1A lab cancelled for the quarter which is going to be weird for when I take 1B I don’t even know if I’ll be able to take 1BL if 1AL is a prerequisite which again SUCKS because the labs probably help solidify the fucking concepts! Sorry I’m ranting all over the place but I took the worst time ever to take chemistry..."
UCSantaBarbara,fp363sh,t1_fp32var,1588273740.0,"I agree, not that I support cheating but it seems like a punishment to others who may have tried to solve it, especially if it seemed like a reasonable question I don’t think anybody would ever except that a professor would knowingly put a question there that was unsolvable.... so students might think they have to be able to solve it ...idk"
UCSantaBarbara,fp1a2oo,t1_fp191ow,1588228832.0,Oh I see. Is this misleading then? Should I remove my post

UCSantaBarbara,fot332m,t1_fosvv04,1588043557.0,"honestly I’m not really sure, I don’t think so because he hasn’t said we’re getting a week for the midterm. But do you mind if I ask what “hints” your TAs have been giving you? If they’re helpful at all."
UCSantaBarbara,fossbx7,t1_fosqvr9,1588037031.0,I’m not entirely sure what you mean. Could you clarify?
UCSantaBarbara,fosgmxr,t3_g9byem,1588030325.0,I’ve also been looking up practice midterms but I feel like I’m not sure if they’re all that conceptual which the exam might be?
UCSantaBarbara,fom03dh,t3_g860ey,1587874718.0,"hello! I reapplied when moving back cause mine was cancelled unrelated to the virus but they said since I was under 22 and living with my parents I had to provide my parents information too, so you might have to do that if you choose to update. Keep in mind they’ll want your parents pay stubs and if they make over the threshold your Calfresh will be cancelled, I think for a Fam of three that threshold is around 3200$ total income"

UCSantaBarbara,fn7zah1,t1_fn7lt66,1586730657.0,"If you did mean geography, I think there’s a big difference ... however I haven’t researched Geography at all"
UCSantaBarbara,fn7ys7o,t3_fzs9zh,1586730361.0,"Geography? Or did you mean geology? I’m gonna assume you meant geology but the difference is that geology can be your declared emphasis or you can go into other earth sciences like climate-environmental emphasis, or there’s also even geophysics which if you enjoy physics and the environment, that might be the perfect choice."
UCSantaBarbara,fn6vq4v,t3_fzs9zh,1586708287.0,"I was in environmental studies but found that there was too many courses required. I found out that Earth science was a more practical and applicable major that focuses more on the sciences than environmental studies without the overwhelming class load. So I would suggest switching to earth science! It’s basically the same as environmental studies and you’ll be focusing on the environment too , plus the department is wonderful(and small/unimpacted) and we have wonderful teachers"
UCSantaBarbara,fn2bhzg,t1_fn2b5ef,1586583445.0,"No worries! It’s really nice what you did dude , I just wanted to warn that I think professors are finding out about these chats from maybe TAs on Reddit or maybe just snitches in the chat, that’s what’s happened to one of mine. Just warn your friends to be careful"
UCSantaBarbara,fn2aw01,t1_fn1xed5,1586582903.0,"hey you should delete this before a TA or professor sees it, be wary of any “cheating “ people have been snitching in group chats"
UCSantaBarbara,fn1lzpq,t3_fyphc6,1586564875.0,I was wondering why they thought to talk about the quiz on there like just message someone privately if you have to...with that many people of course someone had to snitch lmfao. You’re right though we mostly used it for the simplest thing! I don’t get why someone felt the need to tell freund like? What do you gain? they’re “pick me” students

news,fmqh1kn,t3_fwqqqn,1586299457.0,Does anybody wonder if this was all for show? Or this is just a way to not take any responsibility for not helping the USS Theodore Roosevelt in any way really? Or maybe this allows for more time to not let trump have to have someone confirmed???
