ucla,fpj2ksw,t1_fpj27k5,1588654833.0,Do you not believe that educational disparities are the cause of those socioeconomic disparities? Why do you believe there are socioeconomic disparities across race? I’m not grasping what you think the “root cause” of underrepresentation is.
ucla,fpimeky,t1_fpiju4k,1588643940.0,Why do you think its an abhorrent way? Because it could potentially lead to explicit discrimination against minorities in the future?
ucla,fpi8ltw,t3_gd65cr,1588635841.0,Why is it hard to understand that people want to improve representation of minority students on college campuses?
ucla,fpi7c07,t1_fphutar,1588635115.0,whats wrong with For the People?
premed,fpbros5,t1_fpbpsfz,1588477035.0,"1) Maybe midlevels should serve more of a triaging role, seems like a pretty good use of their training especially considering there are arguments out there than mid-levels should just have full autonomy themselves. Claiming that using midlevels to triage patients would certainly lead to worse patient outcomes should definitely have some sources included with it.

2) It is possible that there could be an increase in bureaucracy, but there is a ton of bureaucracy as is. Navigating the current insurance/payment structure is already a headache and is the cause of a ridiculous amount of excess spending. A single payer system could conceivably be easier to navigate if you only have one payer to deal with and can see anyone/refer to anyone without having to jump through hoops to figure out who can see who and how it will be paid for.

&#x200B;

3) Also possible (maybe even probably), but this isn't inherently a part of a single payer system. But there would also be a lot of saved healthcare expenditures compared to our current system that could be potential put towards maintaining physician challenges. That said, I think high cost procedures probably should be disincentivized though in favor of higher-value preventative care. I would encourage you to be proactive and advocate for physician-friendly changes if that is what you want to see."
premed,fpbp3nl,t1_fpbo67q,1588475218.0,"Definitely agree with your first point about the OP. I was more just addressing the general point about how rights are decided. 

I also agree that no philosophical argument can be objectively true, which was my point. In a similar vein, there is certainly no way to prove that liberalism and natural right theory are the ONLY system that deals with uncertainty appropriately. Even then, natural rights theory is frequently criticized and is in no way agreed upon nowadays."
premed,fpbn6e7,t1_fpbk4nb,1588473910.0,"The philosophical arguments used to decide what we currently define as rights are not objectively true. Arguments claiming healthcare as a right can also be based on reason and philosophy, and warrant fair consideration."
premed,forpags,t1_forhqyw,1588016118.0,"This guy is being ridiculous, lol. He goes so far as to say that listing hospital volunteering as a clinical volunteer activity on a medical school application is a “red flag.” I’ve never seen anything like this, lol."
premed,fogulkw,t1_fog1mk5,1587757150.0,"Thats awesome! I would still consider the value of your support system in Davis, but without cost being a factor anymore, I would totally say go to Dartmouth if that's what your gut and heart say. A big change like that could be a big opportunity for growth and perspective. Plus, being as excited as you are for Dartmouth could be big for morale/motivation going into your first year. 

The only other thing I would consider at this point since you didn't mention it before would be grading systems (P/F, rankings, etc) and curriculum (mandatory lecture vs non mandatory, how much PBL they have, etc.)."
premed,fofzie6,t1_foaxebe,1587745534.0,"UC Davis and Dartmouth are both great schools and I don’t really think there is a significant prestige difference here. However UC Davis definitely is more primary care focused, and this also explains their lower step 1 scores since people going into primary care probably aren’t as motivated to score amazingly well. 

You are probably right about the difference in research opportunities between the two schools, but I kind of feel like that’s not toooo important. If you could find a solid opportunity at Davis with a a solid network of people to work with you would totally be fine, but yeah your point is still valid.


70-90k, while definitely significant, still seems like the kind of cost difference where you could go either way. I don’t think you would be wrong if you did end up choosing Dartmouth, but I would think carefully about whether it is worth it to give up the cheaper cost of attendance and local support network - it may just seem like Davis is old an boring and Dartmouth is new and shiny right now, but once you get in the swing of things I imagine those will matter less."
premed,fo97f1c,t1_fo7uu3k,1587612288.0,"Definitely UTSW! Free vs 360k + interest is an enormous difference. Having no debt will free you up to pursue any career path you want without having to really worry about financial security. For what its worth, I'm from California and think that UTSW has an excellent national reputation."
premed,fo5bgh5,t1_fo56ftx,1587521699.0,"Thats a good point, it really would be cool to live close to NYC.

I think the non-recorded lectures thing really comes down to how you personally operate. I considered schools with mandatory lecture but in hindsight I am really glad I didn't choose one. I would be miserable sitting in class and not absorbing anything for 4+ hours per day. But if you are a lecture goer or at least lecture amenable then definitely not a big deal. 

For the matching point, I've never really felt that where you got to medical school necessarily bars you from matching back to CA or anything like that. If you look at cincinnati's match list from last year, i think like almost 20% or so matched back to CA, so there is probably a lot of self selecting going on for that kind of stuff. Of course it matters to some extent, its just really hard to say how much. 

But yeah, if your gut says go Hofstra and you're feeling ready to lay down some new roots in NY I say go for it!"
premed,fo4xces,t1_fo45rxr,1587513069.0,"Did you not like Cincinnati when you visited for your interview? I’m also from California but have actually heard good things about Cincinnati and of course U Cincinnati is a good medical school. I only ask since you said you don’t think you would like living in the Midwest, which is totally an important and valid factor.

It’s a tough decision for sure. Given the change of step 1 to pass fail and your interest in competitive specialties, it might be worthwhile to consider prestige/research opportunities/etc. I don’t think the cost differences between Hofstra, UA, and UC are so significant that it should be a deciding factor or anything. 

Unless you hated Cincinnati, I personally say go with UC tentatively and consider BU if/when you get off the waitlist, though I seem to remember that they accept very few people off the wait list in past years at least"
premed,fmyras6,t1_fmx3jeg,1586493449.0,"I don’t think this is true... if I remember correctly, when you have an acceptance it is reported through AMCAS, and then you are required to state that you have received an acceptance on any subsequent application. I don’t think there’s any standardized reporting of interview invites or anything. Of course, the school that gave you the II would know and would likely not invite you back, but I don’t believe other schools would know"
premed,fmvi9wu,t3_fxirnq,1586417959.0,Definitely put it! I wish I could take your class!
medicalschool,fm5r0xi,t1_fm5plpx,1585778240.0,">That being said, I'm floating the idea of using the data from this pandemic (as many states have given midlevels full practice authority including CRNAs, etc) as a QI project for residency to compare various outcomes. Many of my future coresidents are on board with this project as well, so we'll see if we're actually allowed to do it LOL

I'd definitely love to see that, though I'm not sure that the results would tell you too much about mid-level outcomes in normal circumstances. But yeah, it could certainly strengthen the a case against full autonomy if outcomes are very bad"
