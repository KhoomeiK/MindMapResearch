SrGrafo,fpdvv8u,t1_fpdtvt1,1588535276.0,if you have enough arrows you can do it with even having to get closer enough to get hurt. was def a let down after the other blights were so much better
Rubiks_Cubes,fpaszzw,t1_fpassn2,1588455085.0,that‚Äôs true. if you were to take that into account you would multiply again by (4!)^6 for placing the centers of each color. jesus that‚Äôs a big number
Rubiks_Cubes,fpa9zmh,t1_fp9mkjt,1588443830.0,"The question asks breaking it down into 24 quadrants, which would be a like 2x2. I was operating under the assumption that each quadrant was the same color and because you can‚Äôt change the corner prices color then it simplify exactly into a 2x2. cause if you broke it up into quadrants but those didn‚Äôt have to be the same color then how would it be any different from combinations of a 4x4?"
Rubiks_Cubes,fp8xq49,t1_fp8ncmh,1588406698.0,"not quite. the best way to think about this is by position, then color and then dealing with an issue. in this set up there‚Äôs effectively 8 mini cubes so if we starting putting them in place, there‚Äôs 8 spots for the first, 7 for the second and so on. that‚Äôs going to be 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1=8!. Next each piece can be rotated in three ways so we multiply that by three to get 3^7 x8!. It is to the seven and not to the eight because in order for the cube to be solveable the last corner is determined by the rest. then to get rid of overlap by overall cube orientation we divide by 6 for each face then by 4 for each rotation of that face. this gives a total of (3^7 x8!)/(6x4)=3,674,160 possible arrangements."

Cubers,fmmey9p,t1_fmlsq78,1586204047.0,can confirm that was the thought process
Cubers,fmmewoj,t1_fmlng4m,1586204025.0,you can cheat the gears but what i did was i would turn the five sided faces till all but a few were done and then just fucked around with it for a bit (5 hours) until i got it
