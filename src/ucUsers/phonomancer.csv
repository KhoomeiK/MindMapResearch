Basically, ""Biden had previously been somewhat lackluster in these 5 areas, he's been moving in a progressive fashion in these 3, and seems to be taking #4 seriously...  We'll have to wait and see for #5.""  

What we mostly get instead is ""BIDEN HAS DONE NOTHING TO FIX ISSUE #5!"""

I was showing people how the price for Shin Ramyun Black (""high-end"" ramen, essentially) went from ~$35 for a 24 pack, to ~$96 for a 24 pack.  These weren't price increases from the vendor - this was third-party resellers gouging because they'd bought up all the packs that were available."

SantaBarbara,fmyb2ju,t1_fmr52u0,1586482052.0,"Staying ""locked up"" doesn't prevent the spread - it *slows* it.  People still have to leave their homes (or allow others to come to their homes) for supplies.  The whole idea for social distancing is about slowing the spread of Covid-19, not stopping it.  We aren't realistically stopping the spread until there is a vaccine available, which is most likely several months away.

That said, I agree that this is a temporary ""solution"" and is in no way sustainable for more than a few months."

worldnews,fmtefrl,t1_fmt52nt,1586371333.0,"DNC likes to keep Americans from being exploited by American companies, and wants to allow immigrants seeking to enter the country so long as they can contribute to American society. Only one party has actively worked against consumer/worker rights. I know it's easy to feel like no one is fighting for you (especially if your local representative doesn't seem to be there for you), but there are good people in congress.  

To be perfectly fair, the RNC could argue that they're fighting for the same thing - if we press harder on American companies to provide better wages in the USA, they may instead entirely relocate their corporate bases to countries that are ""more friendly"" to cost-cutting, which would cost what few jobs they still provide to Americans.  I'd argue that what they're doing here is the absolute minimum they could do, is short-sighted and will inevitably have to evolve into something else...  I also think it's probably in bad-faith: simply so there is less meaningful debate on what should actually be done long-term - but I'm not in politics, so I could be (and likely am) missing some details."

SantaBarbara,fmn8bym,t1_fmmuzv5,1586220344.0,"Agreed.  One day of lower growth numbers is not a good metric,  *especially* when it was over the weekend.  If we see two weeks worth of slowing growth, then we can probably start patting ourselves on the back a little... But only so far as knowing that what we're doing is working.

Edit: Well, that didn't last long.  18 new cases today."
UCSantaBarbara,fmn7jh2,t1_fmki4mx,1586219865.0,"*Herd immunity.  Also, completely beside the point.  The problem isn't that we won't develop herd immunity, the problem is that the average infection lasts roughly two weeks, and around 10-20% of them require hospitalization (around 5-10% require intensive care). 

We don't have enough hospital beds (let alone staff, ventilators etc) to handle that many people at once.  Herd immunity will come into play eventually, but the whole ""flatten the curve"" idea is to prevent the overwhelming of our medical system by making sure that instead of getting 40 million cases requiring hospitalization at once, they're spread out over several weeks (or more likely, months) so they can actually get necessary life-saving care."
