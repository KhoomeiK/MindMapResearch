Nobody would speak this way after a year at UCSB, you wouldn’t survive. Facts or get f’ed.  Whoever is voting me down for agreeing with the intelligent majority is pissing me off and is probably the same person I saw sampling raspberries out of containers at Costco today."
UCSantaBarbara,fp7b93i,t3_ga4h8l,1588367381.0,Tripping. Repeatedly. Fuck the sidewalks on campus.
UCSantaBarbara,fp7a3ea,t1_foz21v0,1588366783.0,"That is weird, did you drop classes? Even then it’s odd.  I would email FA and ask.  Or the Cashier."
UCSantaBarbara,fp79xti,t1_fozdctl,1588366702.0,"No, this is from Feds.  Your school STILL owes you your fees.  I’m concerned the UC system will use this confusion to diffuse our frustration.  This is the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT helping us with the CV impact."
UCSantaBarbara,fp7820u,t3_gad7tb,1588365740.0,"Absolutely not! I’m 48 and just graduating.  That said, you will need to be able to get across campus.  I didn’t read the comments but the campus is spread out.  As someone with a slight nerve problem, getting between classes within the 15 minute window was difficult at times.  It got easier as I figured out shorter paths, but there is a particular hall that is in IV, and not the main campus, and it was almost impossible for me to walk it in the 15 minutes.  However, overweight doesn’t mean not fit.  So, I just wanted to let you know about this part of the campus culture.  Biking is HUGE, and skateboarding.   If you are VERY comfortable on a bike you will be fine, but the bikes can be dangerous and not a week goes by that I didn’t witness a crash.  But, positive body image support, supportive student body, supportive staff, and a great community of mixed cultures and ethnicities is what makes UCSB really special."
UCSantaBarbara,fp75vat,t1_fp722sr,1588364615.0,"My understanding is yes, otherwise you need to file for it / I can’t find the link, but UCSB did send a link to students when they alerted us to the disbursements."
UCSantaBarbara,fp75hs5,t1_fp756ut,1588364417.0,"My understanding is that UC/CARES will range from 600-1700.  But, that’s what I read online, lol!"
UCSantaBarbara,fp751qu,t3_gbcxpr,1588364182.0,"I got 1700, head of houshold.  1 dependent, both in college.  Income less than 30,000. UC/CARES We all should include number of units, as this may have impacted. And if you moved due to CV? 1. Full time 2. Moved out of family housing"
UCSantaBarbara,fp72f7b,t1_fp6wc8a,1588362812.0,"This is such a legitimate complaint I can’t even imagine why you guys aren’t forming a petition now - such BS. All or nothing.  My child takes online chem classes, they send him the equipment.  I realize it’s not the same, but nurses can graduate with ONLY vr training.  Studies have shown no difference among these graduates and those that had in class training.  Come on UCSB - fix this."
UCSantaBarbara,fnftjfa,t3_fyps2g,1586915156.0,Is there any chance the student has a learning disability? I would email the Professor.  Or TA if I’m following this discussion correctly.  If there are two people on camera something is off.  The prof should know if the student is dsp.  I feel for the student- they deserve to be on campus away from that controlling parent.
UCSantaBarbara,fnfsi83,t1_fn5t5v4,1586914537.0,"I agree.  Poor form.  Keep it at least, in case you think the prof will be biased toward you in the future."
UCSantaBarbara,fnfr1ds,t3_g0zbp1,1586913672.0,"This is my senior year, last quarter English Major.  I have been beyond frustrated with the class delivery.  I dropped to 8 units and included a note from doctor that my ADHD and other learning needs requirements were not being met.  I got confirmation within a couple hours (I also filed the tuition reimbursement simultaneously) which came in a few hours later.  I can still graduate but I have to say; looking over the GRE right now - I feel like I didn’t learn anything necessary for Grad school admissions."
UCSantaBarbara,fma2umz,t1_fm9m9sw,1585882448.0,"Ok, so according to you, a physics prof ignored a “shelter at home” request while suffering potential Covid-19 symptoms and exposing his colleagues at a university that employs hundreds of STILL REQUIRED TO SHOW UP FOR MINIMUM WAGE workers, that often have no health benefits? 

My uncle is currently on life support with Covid-19-pneumonia.  What sacrifice is this professor making again? 

Wow.  The shortsightedness of your reasoning is confounding, if these are in fact true facts.  

It would be easy to find this out, as I have close personal friends in public health that would be interested to know that a school teacher continued to go to work symptomatic.  And tests, while they may take awhile to get back, have been available.  I had one.  On the 13th.  At the urgent care.  With significantly less resources than a university Professor."
