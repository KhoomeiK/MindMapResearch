ac_newhorizons,fpgqbd6,t3_gdb2c7,1588607573.0,"When sending a gift to a friend via Nook Shopping you're presented with a pre-filled message that you can delete and customize, but it's SO long and takes forever to delete by holding 'B'. Is there a way to clear the entire pre-written message about the gift you're sending without holding B for 45 seconds?"

funny,folgv2a,t1_fokzjsf,1587861949.0,"I rode an electric scooter completely blasted. I rode straight into a curb at full speed, mind you this was at night. I have a distinct memory of flying through the air and then waking up on the sidewalk. I got up and rode back home. Next day I woke up with both my wrists broken. 

I learned a valuable lesson that day. Iâ€™m an idiot and it was so stupid of me to risk my life and the lives of others. Iâ€™ve been sober for 7 months now :)"

SpoiledDragRace,fmnawbd,t1_fmn7h2u,1586221937.0,At least with the makeover episodes they clearly have screens on it back stage for the guests to watch so perhaps youâ€™re right.
