I have yet to play Odyssey so I don’t know how they treated the two character options, but I feel like they could write a fully fleshed out character for Eivor that could work either way because gender doesn’t change their character much. But I agree that it would be better to just create a female character because there are already enough games where you feel like the male protagonist was the default and everything was just copy-pasted last minute to create a second option. I liked mass effect because you could tell the female character was who they originally intended to be the protagonist and gets the better voice acting, haha."

dragonage,fpiig3h,t1_fpifonz,1588641573.0,"It's true––characters like Ezio have their own story, and it's fun to see how it plays out. It's not a game where you make choices, and that's part of the story. I just personally dislike Ezio's romance scenes and feel like they take me out of the story because I can tell they're cliche fan service not written for me. I guess that's what I mean to say by ""forced."" I don't need to agree with everything the character does, but it should fit the story rather than just making every character a womanizing male fantasy. 

I wouldn't say having more control over the character creates a self-insert unless that's what a player wants. I have fun making my own protagonists that are enough alike me to be relatable but also completely different. I can't speak to other AC games because I haven't played yet, but I think games that have a fully formed pc that still give you choices like in the Witcher 3 have handled it well."

dragonage,fph5f5e,t3_gd9rw5,1588615279.0,"I haven't beat the game yet but my Warden Surana is kind of the opposite. She never found a home in the Circle and was excited to get away from the control of the Templars, but she was hesitant about the Wardens because they seemed to only recruit criminals like her who had no choice but to join to escape execution. This is kind of confirmed with the joining, when she sees why no one would join the Grey Wardens of their free will. She really never forgets that trick that was played on her, because it's just another decision forced upon her at knifepoint after a whole life of being controlled. She just wants some freedom over her own life but now with the taint she's really committed to the Warden Order for life. She doesn't hold it against Alistair or Duncan, but she vows that she'll never keep any secrets from new recruits. She kind of gets this victim complex for most of the game because she was taken from her family as a child, forced into the role of Grey Warden, and not allowed to pursue a relationship with Alistair, and she just wants everyone to stop telling her what to do. She kind of matures and gets over it after a huge fight with Wynne, who always tells her to quit whining, but it wakes her up that she needs to focus on the present, and she really commits to the Order as a way for her to finally stop taking orders and prove her worth. Alistair is a little more sympathetic because he accepts that all new recruits will have some hard feelings for a time before they see the good of the cause, but she never had any of the good times and was left all alone with this heavy burden. He kind of doubts her loyalty but he just trusts her to get the job done regardless of how she feels. She's not a proud Warden like him because she feels she could do so much more than kill darkspawn if she were allowed to practice magic however she wanted, but she realizes she needs to do some PR work for the Grey Wardens before she's done with them if she wants them to stop their practice of lying to recruits. So she puts on the act of a model Warden."

I think most people's idea of an incel is what they saw on the banned sub, just a breeding ground for hate populated by some of the most self-centered and entitled people. They don't see anything positive coming from basing your identity around being an incel, and so the term has been tainted with toxicity, even if it started out as a neutral term. I think virgin should definitely be a neutral term.
