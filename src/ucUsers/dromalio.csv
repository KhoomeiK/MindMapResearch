UCSantaBarbara,fod4qos,t1_fod3d6t,1587679853.0,"No... two guys I know did. I watched them design and make them. Check the signature in the corner. Felix, and one of his friends made these. If Buddha bowls sells them then Felix and his friend worked with Buddha bowls to let them sell these."

explainlikeimfive,fnl3c3l,t1_fnl2y0h,1587046146.0,More likely because you have to read every word in the sentence unlike a native speaker who tends to skim in order to save time
explainlikeimfive,fnl1tpu,t1_fnkwfvk,1587045243.0,Lol what. OP wrote “the” twice in the title and is pointing out that you probably only read the first one. Nothing to do with phonetics man

running,fnab4lp,t1_fna9l5n,1586794371.0,"Hmm, I skimmed over that part. Agreed. I think OP just has to be incredibly cautious and listen to their body, as it seems like they really want to continue. First sign of any discomfort just stop and rest"
running,fna6gkn,t1_fna615m,1586791931.0,"But ultra runners do. Look up Cam Hanes! I believe he followed the 10% per week rule to get where he is (about a marathon per day, but I believe he splits it up into a few runs). As long as you ramped up mileage slowly you should be okay. If not you should probably cut your mileage and do it the right way"

running,fmwjw14,t3_fxluie,1586447896.0,"I quit vaping a few weeks ago for running. Every few days I’ll still sneak a toke from my Gfs vape, but it’s still better than chain vaping all day. I’ll still have a drink after dinner, usually just a glass of wine and then I’ll try and stop. 

Good luck!"
