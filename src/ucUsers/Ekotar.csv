Physics,fpkt8ky,t1_fphufrv,1588700633.0,"The EMDrive, when tested in aggregate, does not produce thrust in excess of experimental margin of error. If you view the ""NASA study"" against the cohort of other experimental results, it becomes a feature of statistical noise. If you are relying on EMDrive as a primary argument for QI, I don't think you'll win my vote.

Also, it's still not clear to me -- how does QI explain lensing. Please feel free to be as technical as you'd like, I've taken graduate courses in QFT."

The admissions rate was about 9.5% for physics. Our math department is similarly ranked (both are inarguably top 5 in their discipline). The students who get in generally had 90%ile subject test scores on the GRE, and he said a physics GPA below 3.85 getting in was ""highly unusual""."

berkeley,fombp0z,t1_fokqabn,1587884371.0,">  but for PhD programs, there is bias against Berkeley undergrads. They want you to leave campus and go somewhere else. 

The Physics department admissions committee chair has told me to my face that he has no idea where this comes from. They would love to keep their own students, if they're as qualified as students from other institutions.

The conventional wisdom remains that going to another school is better for broadening your academic network, but I know no shortage of Berkeley Physics Grad students who also came here for undergrad."

berkeley,fogef8z,t1_fogcjw8,1587751524.0,"Welcome to Reddit!

In the desktop version of Reddit, within the Berkeley subreddit, you can see a sidebar on the right side of the page. You should see a drop-down menu labeled ""community options"" underneath the large blue ""create post"" button. If you click on that, you should see a ""user flair preview"", and there should be an option to edit your flair (the edit option looks like a pencil).

Your flair is just a string of text that'll show up next to your username when you post or comment on /r/Berkeley. The typical choice for students is a class year and major, but I might recommend identifying yourself with your job title, so when you comment, people understand who it's coming from. There are a few faculty members who are active on the subreddit (notably Nick Weaver from CS, who is often very helpful in answering questions, and also jokes around with the rest of us). I believe his flair says ""CS faculty"".

On other subreddits, people flair themselves different ways. For example, on /r/AskScience (a forum for laypeople to ask experts science questions) you have to prove submit your degree to the moderation team to be flaired, so no one can pose as an expert when they aren't. A typical flair there might look like ""biochemistry PhD - protein structure"" or ""Physics PhD - Dark Matter Detection"". On the /r/physics subreddit, people usually just tag themselves as a undergrad/grad or with a specialty."

Apply to readmit to Cal with 61 series done, 16A done, all lower divs and breadths done. Pay two years of tuition at Cal.
