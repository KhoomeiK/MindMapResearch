UCSantaBarbara,fpj1w4x,t3_gdr4l3,1588654301.0,"Not related to the history aspect of your post, but just a heads up I’m 99% sure we don’t have a business minor."
UCSantaBarbara,fphyisc,t3_gdl8lk,1588630180.0,Nope it’s not.
UCSantaBarbara,fpbukw0,t1_fpbuj17,1588479110.0,I went around 7:10ish so might be a similar batch. I’ll try them and let ya know haha
UCSantaBarbara,fpbug48,t1_fpbqump,1588479012.0,I got two orders of the cheese enchiladas and put them in my fridge... now I’m scared to eat them lol
UCSantaBarbara,fpbbv7x,t1_fpbb3qm,1588466493.0,"Yeah, I think the drop date passed"
UCSantaBarbara,fp1kk7x,t3_gaq4y7,1588238699.0,You can also email the advisor and they can add you.
UCSantaBarbara,fp0jzfd,t3_gamau7,1588210791.0,"Environmental Studies is also very easy to get into; all ES departmental classes are now major only though for Pass 1 so if you want to take one I would declare ASAP. Otherwise, you could also just work on the chem requirements, etc as many of those are common between ES and bio.

Edit: also I’d definitely recommend ES over eco/evo for environmental policy"
UCSantaBarbara,foxhhhu,t1_foxagg7,1588144139.0,"Yep, it’s super accessible: https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/catalog/Current/UndergraduateEducation/APCreditandChart.aspx"
UCSantaBarbara,forp8rj,t3_g97c4b,1588016094.0,"Yes, Session A is online."
UCSantaBarbara,fo149nf,t1_fo147n2,1587425440.0,Np! Also wouldn’t hurt to send the professor (if there is one) an email :)
UCSantaBarbara,fo13d4c,t3_g519gp,1587424927.0,"History of Art and Architecture

Update: HAA just announced it is opting in!!"
UCSantaBarbara,fo0ewi5,t3_g4xmni,1587411870.0,"They might be saving those spots for FSSP if it’s a session B class. Otherwise, those spots may open up in pass 3 or at a later time."
UCSantaBarbara,fnugedq,t1_fnudc9y,1587261480.0,Awesome thank you! :)
UCSantaBarbara,fnuc50y,t3_g3yr7c,1587258892.0,The donation bin outside the IV Parks and Rec office is currently closed to prevent spread of COVID-19. I don’t know about any others.
nintendo,fntvem5,t3_g3ptch,1587249333.0,"I wrote a poem after not writing poetry for years, it felt so refreshing :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fnrio7s,t1_fnrimxw,1587190150.0,"Ah I see, good luck!! I think it’s a good choice, the department’s amazing :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fnriktu,t3_g3iki6,1587190067.0,"They opted in, but if you’re not in the major, I’m not sure how that would affect you (unless it’s for a friend, etc). If you’re taking an ES class for a different major, it would only matter if your major opted in I believe."
UCSantaBarbara,fnqav5x,t3_g39pk9,1587161041.0,Art History is still not pass/no pass so far
UCSantaBarbara,fnpnc3j,t1_fnog6b9,1587148529.0,Yeah essentially a tldr of my post lol
UCSantaBarbara,fnnl799,t1_fnmym3w,1587094995.0,Same
UCSantaBarbara,fnnks6j,t3_g2tu4r,1587094706.0,"I would say that physics is better here overall, but it also depends on your learning style and preferred environment. SB is super close to the beach but SLO also isn’t too far, and I would say that downtown SLO has more stuff to do than downtown SB overall (but Isla Vista would generally be considered an advantage for SB: easy to get food, etc). Learning style at SLO is “learn by doing” and I’ve heard is generally a more hands on approach and you really get to focus on your major early on, while SB has a lot more flexibility (especially if you want to change majors, which is super hard at SLO) and research opportunities. PM me if you have any more questions about the differences between the campuses (although I probably can’t answer more questions about physics specifically)."
UCSantaBarbara,fnmeyxo,t3_g2m23u,1587070220.0,History of Art and Architecture is also letter grade only so far (could change though)
UCSantaBarbara,fnkmsi0,t3_g2bis6,1587033059.0,I think if it’s just an elective category (not a specifically required course) then yes you could take any other course that counts for that category in its place instead of retaking.
UCSantaBarbara,fnccrfh,t1_fncc8q2,1586833636.0,"For certain scholarships, it’s a total of 12 over the course of all the sessions (for example, 4 units in A and 8 in B). Not sure about financial aid specifically though, could definitely be just 8 total for that."
UCSantaBarbara,fnccm5v,t1_fnbmhds,1586833539.0,"The official general email regarding pass/no pass says: “This pre-approval applies to all courses the department offers, whether they are currently optional grading (letter or P/NP) or letter grade only.” So, if writing opted in, their letter grade only classes could be taken as pass/no pass."
UCSantaBarbara,fnavay2,t3_g0omfr,1586804446.0,Not sure about that but San Cat post office is definitely still receiving packages
UCSantaBarbara,fn64mls,t3_fzs9zh,1586687238.0,"You could also do a minor in either of those two fields for your outside concentration, or even double major if you still would like to have the ES background as well. If you’re completely wanting to eschew ES then yeah I’d say Stats is more marketable without graduate school, but there are definitely tons of funding programs available for grad school since money appears to be the issue :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fn5u0wv,t1_fn5ai27,1586675860.0,"Some come with 3 desks and an additional 2-drawer system detached from the closets! But yes, others come with just two desks and just the two 3-drawer dresser systems that come with the two closets. The rooms are super spacious (probably 3 times the size of a regular single)."
UCSantaBarbara,fmpvxg2,t3_fwqxh6,1586288317.0,"3 classes + working should keep you busy in session B, I would say 4 is too much unless you’re planning on devoting all of your time to work and classes."
