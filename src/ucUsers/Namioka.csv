UCDavis,fp6vc44,t1_fp5y392,1588359217.0,"Yeah, I signed one because our unit needed four signatures to renew the lease because our complex has people currently living there renew leases before adding new leases. We were just going to have me sign and have someone take it afterward. It’s something we’d done in the past with people graduating, but some people staying. 

Turns out this thing called a pandemic is putting a huge change to everything."
UCDavis,fp4aae2,t1_fp4a4zc,1588294832.0,"The only hope for us I guess is that they go back to in person during winter, and people know they’ll need a place by then."
UCDavis,fp49n2i,t1_fp49jax,1588294462.0,"I figured that’s the case, trying to prepare for it. I just imagine there’s lots of people in a lease dilemma."
UCDavis,fp49ae1,t3_gao09r,1588294262.0,"I wouldn’t recommend doing it right away. First of all, I don’t know the logistics behind exactly how it’s done, but it could come back to bite you in the ass three years later. First year isn’t really that difficult in the grand scheme of things."

ChineseLanguage,fniatuu,t1_fngfnxx,1586976879.0,"When I first started learning Chinese, a fellow white classmate got the name 王朋 from our teacher, and none of us knew (because baby Chinese students back then) how hilarious it was that that was his name."
UCDavis,fnbuxmk,t1_fnb8dec,1586822821.0,"Don’t be the guy who’s dismissive of other peoples’ concerns. OP worded it badly and it came out unnecessarily pointed, but still."
