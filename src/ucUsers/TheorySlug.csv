UCSC,fpi2ptt,t3_gdkqgo,1588632496.0,"> Vote. Stop USAC candidates from carrying out bullshit agendas that don't meet your needs. This happens because we're apathetic and the 15% of voters coming from North Campus get to dictate which student issues get attention. 

This is basically why the whole \[redacted\] thing happened in the fall/winter. The graduate student association elections were swarmed by the soapboxers, but only because less than a third of graduate students cared enough to vote in last year's elections. Then the new GSA failed to appoint anyone to most of the advocacy/advisory roles that work with the faculty and admin, instead using their platform to promote a political agenda. They also didn't accept any help from the previous GSA who offered to organize a transition/training for the roles.

It should be a parliamentary system with staggered terms for different academic divisions, and the executive board of any student government on our campus should be dissolved."

UCSC,fpi0qju,t1_fpgpdxz,1588631396.0,"I don't know why this and the other comments in the thread are being downvoted. If you're willing to take out a loan for an education you think is too expensive, what's another $30 a month for decent internet? As one person mentioned, there are financial aid options for exactly this..."
UCSC,fpfw2yr,t3_gd2dlk,1588585703.0,"I'm certainly no professor, but as a grad student I do hear what the faculty in my department are thinking fairly often. I'll press my advisor to get more specific information this week, but at the moment it looks like the plan is for physics lectures to all be online in the fall. There is no plan to switch back being circulated, and given the possibility of another case surge in the fall/winter of 2020, I think we are going to air on the side of caution. Until there's ample testing and contact tracing in place, we owe it to our students to consider their health as important as we consider their academic progress. The two cannot be separated."

UCSC,fp08w55,t1_foyhx7x,1588204679.0,"> he is in his last year 

Do you say this because he's a 4th year? PhDs in physics take an average of 5-6 years these days. (I know Zip and I'm fairly confident he'll be here to keep teaching y'all for another 2 years or so.)"
UCSC,fp07sef,t1_foxkgj7,1588204081.0,"In physics there's one GSI every quarter, basically. Usually more senior students, who mastered the material they'd be teaching more than 6 years ago."
