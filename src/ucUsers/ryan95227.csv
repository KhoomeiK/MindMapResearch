simpleliving,fplxikz,t3_gdyb74,1588721382.0,"Can I offer another perspective? I know that there are lot of exciting things in this world but nothing can really satisfy our desires. You thought being a barista would give you a much needed freedom but now you are dissatisfied. You think pursuing a better career with meaningful projects and good work/life balance will give you that happiness you need. Nope, that will also be dissapointing. What I'm trying to say is that complete satisfaction only comes from within. It never comes from outside. You need to observe why you are dissatisfied with it constantly. Hit me up with questions if there is any"

UCSantaBarbara,fp7j95o,t3_gac2xd,1588371658.0,"I suck at interviews so I failed all my interviews with big 4. I got some temp job after college and then some clerk job. I'm now Staff accountant. To be fair, it will be hard to get a staff accountant job but if you keep trying you'll get it. I got really desperate for job so i settled for a temp job which led to a temp job then to staff accountant job."
NoFap,fp7gtq3,t3_gbhxsk,1588370358.0,Congrats! Imagine how proud your baby would be if he/she knew you didn't fap ever since he/she was born. Would've loved my parents to warn me of the dangers of porn and fapping
TheMindIlluminated,fp6iuhw,t1_fnywcfo,1588353089.0,look into mahasi sayadaw
TheMindIlluminated,fp6e12e,t1_fo12btr,1588350727.0,"I absolutely agree with you TD-0. There's a reason why monks such as Mahasi Sayadaw went great lengths to emphasize the importance of maintaining the precepts and thereby purifying the conduct. He even goes to say that a monk breaking a precept could be enough for the monk to completely drop out of the spiritual path if the monk does not take immediate action. 

Also, if you keep justifying that it's ""ok"" to break the precept and lie a little here or drink a little alcohol here are you truly maintaining the 5 precepts?"

antinatalism,foztlb3,t1_foztiqn,1588196631.0,The experience of suffering will still be there
TrueAntinatalists,foztfyv,t1_fozs5zp,1588196556.0,I see your point
TrueAntinatalists,fozqjeu,t1_fozn5o0,1588195117.0,That would be the case but what happens if there's a birth after?
antinatalism,fozgzgn,t1_fozggvn,1588190499.0,There's no difference. What is important here is that you will experience suffering yet again because you were born. You will go through the same cycle of suffering. You die and get born as a deer and most likely die of a painful death to a pack of hyenas or african wild dogs. They will rip you apart and sometimes your fetus inside your belly. You then get born as a human on india as a female and get blamed for being raped. See the point? The suffering will constantly be there. You go through eons of births until you decide it's enough.
antinatalism,fozg39s,t1_fozfdct,1588190068.0,"We don't know except some notable monks who can access that via deep meditation. Buddha himself saw eons of rebirths and saw the horrifying cycle of rebirth and death during his journey to nibanna.

Here's my reasoning: The fact that YOU were born somehow and began to be aware of your surroundings is enough proof that you can be born again. There are trillions and trillions of sentient beings being born everywhere in the universe. Who's to say you might not be one of them? Who's to say you may not wake up one day and suddenly realize that you are watching your elephant mom without knowing your past life of being a human being?"
antinatalism,fozf70m,t1_foze4mu,1588189641.0,How can you be so sure that there's no afterlife? Just try to think about it.
antinatalism,fozeueg,t1_foxnua6,1588189474.0,"I agree. I believe that there's three tiers of intelligence. Being an engineer, professor, or etc doesn't really show that you are smart. 

1st tier - normal people who think having kid is good because life is wonderful

2nd tier - antinatalists who assign negative value to birth because life is hopeless

3rd tier- Enlightened folks such as Buddha, Mahasi Sayadaw who saw the ultimate nature of reality leading to complete detachment to life and attaining the ultimate bliss."
antinatalism,fozcmoh,t1_fot52d2,1588188419.0,"The idea that life is either worth living or not worth living is both false. You need to see the emptiness that lies everywhere in life and become detached to all that you think will give you happiness. Absolutely void, deathless state is happiness"

PhilosophyMemes,fothie6,t1_fo8ezoe,1588054096.0,"we chase for that happiness that we never actually get. True happiness is coming to a terms with impermanence of life and not seeking anything because everything is empty of true value. From there, you also realize that your thoughts are not ""you"" and those are also impermanent. You stop attaching to these thoughts. You no longer attach to anything. Boredom, hatred, and greedy stop and you're content with absolutely nothing. Congrats! you reached nibanna!"

DACA,fohj1sb,t1_fohhblw,1587766785.0,"Yeah I know what the economy is like in Korea. Here's the thing.. America is just as messed up. You can't even save money here (insurance,rent, and loan pretty much eat up your income) and you might even go bankrupt if you ever get sick. Btw several of my friends received bachelor from good college from USA and are doing just fine in korea. If there was a pathway to permanent residency in the US I would love to stay here but the uncertainty constantly hovers over my head. I can't even buy a house or invest in a market for the fear of being deported. You also need to realize that situation in korea is getting better. People are realizing that patriarchal society is cancerous. There are laws preventing korean companies to take their employees out to a drink. Now that Korea has elected a liberal party expect more liberal laws catered towards young people. America is declining. People are literally stupid here. It becoming less and less traditional there. ever since that choi son shil fiasco"
unpopularopinion,foh1era,t1_fogzhgw,1587759420.0,"That's still your opinion though. What I'm trying to say is that your child may believe that life isn't worth it. You may think life is inherently good but your child may think otherwise. That's what is morally wrong because you decided to have the child by taking the risk. Listen, if you truly were selfless you would have adopted. What is the reason why you want your OWN kid rather than adopt?"
DACA,fogq0qh,t1_foggyc4,1587755652.0,I would say I'm more korean than American. I mean I consume korean entertainment 99% of the time and speak korean fluently. 2 years of military service sucks though. That definitely is a factor
antinatalism,fogpqsm,t1_fogn1co,1587755558.0,It's not asceticism at all though. Buddha practiced that before realizing that that's also another fetter.
antinatalism,fogekic,t1_foge4tn,1587751575.0,"I think the philosophy of Buddhism answers that question. Siddhartha preached that by knowing the truth of the universe which is impermanence, one starts to detach from  self and this materialistic world because one sees how pointless and meaningless it is to suffer over a pile of shit that everyone wants. We can see few accounts of very notable monks living in caves for years without anything to rely on."
antinatalism,fogbafa,t1_fo4ystk,1587750372.0,What you sayin over there. Universe itself is utterly indifferent but there are many chaotic factors that can cause sentient beings lot of suffering. The entire system of existence overall is painful. The void is the greatest we can achieve
unpopularopinion,fogabsm,t1_foep8ly,1587750017.0,"What about the potential suffering he/she might face? What about the rape, murder, disease, and separation he might face his life? It's not about OH he will have fantastic childhood. You can't guarantee that for your child nor can you prevent that child from facing the horrors of life as well. You took a gamble despite knowing the horrors he may face."
MechanicalKeyboards,fo7dsw5,t1_fo74aau,1587576627.0,I'm laughing so much at this. My own stupidity! thank you for your assurance. I was just worried. I never spent this much $ on an equipment before.
antinatalism,fo4v3ap,t3_g532m1,1587511802.0,"Some people here have also seen a fraction of universe's law of nature : impermenance. Everything is subject to dissociation, degredation, and etc. Exposure to this truth may lead someone to come to a conclusion that life is meaningless but then he/she is still suffering because he/she is working for something that is utterly pointless. Working 9-5 job to get some some money to enjoy something. However, in the midst of all this, they realize that they are suffering in order to gain/gain access to pointless things. I get how antinatalism will resonate with them greatly. There are not many people who can be exposed to this kind of truth to the point that it will make them miserable. However if you keep digging into it and keep understanding this impermanence there lies the unexplainable, greatest, deathless nibanna that awaits us all."
antinatalism,fo4uhv9,t1_fo4cayh,1587511464.0,"Boy you haven't gotten to the end stage of life yet. There are 3 pillars of suffering: death, sickness, and aging.

You should be looking for a company that has a good accounting software that's high in demand. Your goal is to grow so looking for a manager that will foster that will be important.

4. Repeat and rinse for all chapters.
5. Take notes on MCQs (key extracts, concepts, tricks, BS memorization)
