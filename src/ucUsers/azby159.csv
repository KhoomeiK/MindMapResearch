UCSantaBarbara,fpiyffu,t3_gd7rsg,1588651733.0,"I personally did not have big issues with Meridian. We got about 75% of our deposit back.

They were generally quick to fix issues that needed fixing. The only repair we got charged for was the screen door breaking, because it was super jenky when we moved in and it broke soon after but they blamed us. Which was unfortunate.

But overall, we made sure to keep it clean, not damage anything (especially blinds; replacing those is pretty expensive through Meridian), and they didn't try to screw us out of TOO much money.

Most companies will be pretty harsh with security deposits. We just got lucky.

But for the most part we never had to talk with them, and we didn't have any flagrant issues with them while or after living there."

I know literally nothing about medical school decisions. Thanks for the info!

Who knows the ways of the inner-workings of the chem dept...

 I don't necessarily agree with the methods used, I'm just trying to give what information I know and what assumptions I've drawn from it."
UCSantaBarbara,fp44m1s,t3_gb67da,1588291582.0,"I haven't gotten mine yet either -\_-

Submitted it mid-late March."
UCSantaBarbara,fp444wx,t1_fp40xbw,1588291311.0,"I feel you. One of the hardest parts that we're having is the fact that every class, and especially every lab, is run by different professors with extremely different requirements and different willingness to fully transition to online methods. So it's extraordinarily difficult to coordinate them to make things run smoothly.

Especially with lab courses, they're required for many things, and getting them online with such short notice was a massive headache. Lots of things can be improved upon but it's hard to fix them to the level that's necessary at this point in the quarter.

My *assumption* on the P/NP debacle is for down-the-line med school/grad school apps. For things like med school (which is a large reason such a huge percentage of students take chemistry), they base large swaths of their decisions on chemistry course grades, where an A- vs an A can make all the difference. It's super hard to know how med schools and other similar places will view P/NP vs grades (even given the circumstances), so they may just be ""playing it safe"".

I'm not trying to defend the department or go against the department, I'm just saying what my assumptions on some of their reasonings are based on profs I've talked to and my experiences as a TA this quarter.

Everything is terrible."
UCSantaBarbara,fp3k149,t1_fp3iybf,1588280659.0,"Your TA hasn't graded *any* of them?? That's ridiculous.

I knew many TA's were grading slower but I didn't realize it was *that* slow..."
UCSantaBarbara,fp3gbrw,t3_gb34s8,1588278809.0,"Gen chem lab TA here.

I'm sorry you're dealing with this :(

I completely understand why you're frustrated with this. I can't offer a solution, but I  want you to know that you're not alone in this frustration. 

There are many issues going on with the labs, and they are, frankly, not easy to fix. TA's are often required to teach due to funding and due to the department needing TA's. With that being said, while they have been told deadlines for grading turnaround and how to take off points, etc...if they don't follow those guidelines, they can't really have action taken against them because the department needs them. Add to that the added shittiness of online labs, and it's a perfect shitstorm.

For my classes, I'll be strict on the first lab report and write a lot of comments,, but then if I haven't given it back before others were turned in, I'll be much more lenient on those because I know that the students didn't have the benefit of the feedback from the first. It's a difficult balance to strike, and it's definitely frustrating for the students. 

Have you tried discussing this with your TA? Hopefully they are one who is open to constructive criticism and suggestions, as we are all learning how to do these online classes together, students and teachers alike."
UCSantaBarbara,fozeqyx,t1_foyo9aq,1588189430.0,I've done that a few times. Fucking horrifying.
UCSantaBarbara,fow32px,t3_g96dgd,1588112104.0,"Yeah the grading of the lab reports varies TA to TA. It can definitely be pretty rough. The quizzes are all written by Dr. VanKoppen, but as someone mentioned, each section is curved separately, so if the TA sucks at grading or is an extremely hard grader, then the grades will all balance out.

For sources of error, typically saying if the reagents were measured slightly inaccurately (too much or too little) is fine, as long as you explain how that got the given error... i.e. if too little of one reactant was measured out by accident, would that affect the results in the direction seen? Things like that. Or when something was weighed out after synthesizing, maybe it didn't fully dry so the mass was too high? Or maybe when the crystals were rinsed with water or ethanol, a bit dissolved, so the mass was too low? Was the solution mixed adequately enough...so if it wasn't, then maybe not everything reacted, and so on.  Just little things that all could affect the error.

It's definitely more difficult to figure this out when you didn't do the experiment yourself. But pretty much the main errors come when anything is measured, and possible flaws in that process.

Granted, that's how I grade the sources of error sections. As long a few possible options are put down with some sort of general justification, should be ok. But again, depends on the TA."
UCSantaBarbara,folqhnq,t1_fol9i5k,1587868096.0,"I’m sorry about that :(
I know some of the professors, and some of them get hundreds of emails a day, which makes it hard to respond to everyone easily. All I could really say is keep trying, maybe even ask in an email to meet for office hours or separately to discuss things. Can’t guarantee that would work but it can’t hurt to keep at it.

It’s really shitty of the one to send out the email attacking y’all... that’s a very not-cash-money thing to do.

And yeah the department itself is super overwhelmed with figuring all this out and has been fairly rough at individual emails and concerns. I suspect many of the larger departments are in similar boats. 
I’m not condoning it, just giving the little info I know. 

I’m just a TA but I am in pretty close communication with several of the professors for gen chem/ochem. If there’s anything I might be able to try to help with, let me know."
UCSantaBarbara,foksner,t3_g7zc51,1587848183.0,"I'm sorry you're struggling with all of this. 

If you haven't already, try contacting your professors with your concerns. Many profs are sincerely trying their best to make adjustments as they go to make everything as smooth as possible, and are very open to feedback and constructive criticism. But there's also of course plenty who think that they can assign a normal or higher amount of work because ""the students have more free time to work now"", which I think is absurd.

&#x200B;

As a Chem TA, I'm trying to make things as manageable as possible for my students, but it's very hard to judge how much work certain things will be, with the added difficulty of students' various home distractions. Some of my students have communicated to me about some of their concerns with workloads, and I take that into account when writing quizzes, figuring out assignments, lab reports, etc...

&#x200B;

You'll get through this. We all will. And even if you feel you can't take time off, it can be more helpful than you think sometimes to take a day to relax, even if it puts a little bit of work off."
