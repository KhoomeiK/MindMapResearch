DragaliaLost,fo0qhrn,t1_fo0pzm4,1587417891.0,"true but it shows the power of skills, some of which I still think the subreddit sleeps on. One of the things I think is consistently undervalued is TA especially in the context of ""you have 4 units to play with and aren't operating in a 1 vs everyone vacuum""

it's easy to point to a clear raw stat jump as the problem but I think that's overly simplistic and doesn't really hit at the problem.

Also TA is good."
