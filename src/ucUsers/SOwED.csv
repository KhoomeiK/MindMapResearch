That's him creating humans, knowing they will sin.

That's fine, but the Bible relies on symbolism and metaphor too much. Even Jesus relied on parables rather than ""here's literally how it is, because this information is too important to convey it in a way that could be misinterpreted."" Not to mention most of the New Testament is Paul's ideas, not Jesus's.

Am I holy? Are you following the noble eightfold path? Holy doesn't mean anything to those of us outside religion beyond sarcastic quips like ""holier than thou.""

Am I perfect? I guess by the morality of the Bible, no, but that's irrelevant, because I reject that morality.  I'm saying that even if you accept the biblical morality, humans being morally corrupt by default doesn't make sense without the mythology of the Bible, the fall, etc.

If a god exists then no human knows what happens behind the scenes, but that won't stop them from forming religions and writing books so they can claim they do know what happens behind the scenes.

>This is just your opinion, and I don't see why anybody should accept this view.

Saving 100% of humans would constitute being 100% effective at saving them.  He isn't 100% effective, not even very close to 100% effective.  Not a matter of opinion if your idea of being saved is dying a Christian.  It's a matter of fact that the majority of human beings who ever existed were not Christians, not to get into the matter of sects, which further reduces who was ""right"" and actually got saved.

>Humans are morally corrupt and spiritually blind and in need of forgiveness for sins.

My existence is not a moral corruption, and sins range from logical things that tend to be illegal, like murder, to things that are outrageous, like saying ""Oh my god!""

Shocker, he made up the law, how convenient that his human sacrifice satisfied the debt he imposed on us for existence, which he chose for us.

He's not particularly effective at saving them because the majority of humans who have ever existed have not followed him, thus he has failed to save as many as he could have saved.  The fact that he hasn't made it clear enough both that he exists and that Christianity is the correct way to follow him shows that he is ineffective.
