UCSC,fopdhua,t3_g8ok3g,1587958760.0,"I remember she gave us a packet that I think included vocabulary, questions about the videos she showed us during class and questions about readings / videos we needed to watch for homework.  I remember there being a short written part at the end, but I can’t remember exactly what it’s on. I had her almost two years ago, but overall the exams weren’t that difficult. Good luck! :)"

UCSC,fn9g787,t3_fym2dy,1586771745.0,"I’m going to list a couple:

Cindy Cruz for educ 60: my first and one of my favorite professors till this day! She made me appreciate teachers so much.

Baldo (20C and inverts 122): this man is a walking encyclopedia for biology, specifically invertebrates. HOLY FUCK. I appreciate his dad jokes and movie impressions too :’)

Kate Cary (BIOE 20B): she is an amazing lecturer and I never got bored. She was always happy when lecturing and made me appreciate biology so much

Draper stats7: if it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have passed stats. He was so accommodating to his students and really showed he cared. Protect him at all costs

Alan Christy and Alice Yang 80Y(?):loved the combination of the professors for this class and they’re both very kind people :)"
UCSC,fn9fte9,t1_fn1ar35,1586771318.0,I currently have him for my first time and he’s really interactive with the students and I appreciate that a lot :)
UCSC,fn9eks4,t3_g0d8v1,1586769944.0,I do! I lived there during my second year :) (2018-2019)
InlandEmpire,fmlbvmt,t3_fvrd7g,1586183255.0,Animal Crossing and lots of Netflix
InlandEmpire,flhq6cg,t1_flhp8hd,1585167438.0,"A lot of the staff/teachers are incredible. I appreciate the variety of AP classes they offer, and I enjoyed my experience there for the most part! I was also in colorguard during my freshman and sophomore year. During my senior year they implemented the program link crew which is meant for upper class men to help out freshman transition into hs. I graduated in 2017, so I’m not sure what else has changed :)"
