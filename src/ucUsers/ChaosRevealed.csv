I responded to this above, here is my comment:

There's more to an UFC event than just 2 guys in a cage.

You got: - referees and cutmen - security - fighter's corners - medical staff - cameramen - broadcast talent and team - event coordinators - event crew for setup and takedown - misc UFC staff - sports commission staff - hotel staff

I'm sure I could double the size of my list if I spent more than a minute on it.

That's multiple dozens if not hundreds of people, most of which will be flying in from multiple stated and then flying out again.

Hosting a sports event isn't just about the fighters and players. The people required to host the event and keep it running smoothly outnumber the sports players. There isn't much of an increase in # people required for a a team sport vs an individual 1v1 sport. 

>The two more weeks crowd is starting to get stale when the 2 more weeks see extensions every time 

Sure it gets stale. I'm bored out of my fucking mind. But if the pandemic necessitates further extensions, then so be it.

>and the economy crushes people.

And guess what? The virus kills people.

If the UFC staff or fighters participating in the event (and only those participating, since no one else is getting paid) are struggling for pay, then this is a valid argument. But you'd have to qualify that.

If you do qualify this claim, then a better solution without endangering the health of UFC staff, its contractors and public health would be for the UFC to offer living stipends for its employees, especially those that were originally working a cancelled event. This would benefit far more than the couple dozen people involved in 249 which is really just a tiny drop in the ocean. 

If you really cared about the economic well being of the MMA staff who lost income due to the virus, then you'd no doubt support this method over risking people's health unnecessarily over one single paycheck to a couple dozen people.

>People online with WFH jobs and capacity to last financially might not like it but it's the truth.

The same Abdulmanap that has trained Khabib in wrestling, Judo and Combat Sambo since he was eight, and also trained strong MMA wrestlers Umar, Islam, and Abubakar?

That Khabib fought a bunch of Russian cans before he entered the UFC doesn't refute the fact that Khabib's entire grappling-based game is developed from the strong grappling base his father coached into him from a young age and continues to coach into him today.

Hell, even DC should be credited more to Khabib's wrestling than Coach Jav. He's Khabib's wrestling coach at AKA and Khabib gives DC a ton of credit for further improving his game.

Javier and AKA are excellent at taking young, raw talent (often from a grappling background), giving them striking skills and adapting them to an MMA meta. But Javier is not a wrestling, or a BJJ, or a grappling coach at all. He's the head coach and a striking coach.

Weed has medicinal values and many people use it in lieu of painkillers. The government would do well not to cut off the medical supply chain.

There's levels to this shit. Stop acting dumb. If I wear a mask, I drop my change of infection. If I wear an N95 mask, goggles, and gloves, I further drop my chance of infection. If I don't talk to or have any physical contact with anyone when I go outside, I further drop my chance of infection.

Come on. It's not rocket science. Testing is done because a 90% accurate test is better than nothing.

But 90% accurate is not good enough to start nonessential work and endanger the hundreds or thousands of people the UFC 249 participants will interact with within 2 weeks after the event. 

People practicing social distancing still need to go outside and purchase supplies. Or their families do. Or their roommates do. Every single time someone goes in public, there is an available vector for infection. To themselves, and to others.

It's not like you could be asymptomatic and unknowongly infect everyone you come in contact with, right? Who cares if those infected live with the elderly? Who cares if those infected are frontline hospital workers?

Come on bruh. Social distancing isn't to protect your ass. It's to protect everyone else you come in contact with. I don't care if individuals want to risk their own health, that's their call. But in a pandemic, one more confirmed case is one more person who infected multiple others unknowingly during the incubation period.

If every single person involved with UFC 249 can prove they practiced social distancing for the previous 14 days prior to the event, and can guarantee they will continue social distancing for the following 14 days, then there's no risk to themselves nor anyone they come I  contact with.

Tests aren't 100% accurate. There is an up to 14 day incubation period. Fighters and their camps, as well as UFC event and media staff, have to travel and be exposed to other people, potential carriers, en route. If anyone is are infected within a few days of the event, they are most likely asymptomatic and easily could test negative. Even if they display symptoms, the tests have a relatively high false negative rate.

Again, you can guarantee that not a single person physically involved in UFC 249 is and won't be infected within this week?

>And again this virus has a low death rate. 

A quick look at stats around the world says 3-15% case fatality rate. I don't know your definition of low, but that ain't mine.

>Keep the olds at home and don’t visit them after these fighters willingly fight at this event. 

Do all fighters live alone? What about their family? Does no one in their household go out to buy groceries and supplies?

Hosting this event now, even with maximal precautions, is a danger to public health. And public health isn't Dana's call to make. Nor the UFC's. This is just Dana trying to capitalize on bored sports fans. The UFC's reason for risking people's lives is purely economic.

They literally just need wait a couple weeks until the transmission numbers die down, by which time more accurate tests may be available, and better precautions can be implemented. The chance that the fighters and staff will be infected during travel and during the event will too be lowered due to low % infected in the population."
MMA,fpizacz,t1_fpixt9a,1588652366.0,">Testing is all we have. This is the only option the current situation at hand. 

Are you talking about the UFC 249 situation? Because testing is not the only option. There's also the  non-Dana's-a-greedy-ratfuck option of not hosting the event and in doing so endangering hundreds or thousands of people that UFC 249 staff and participants will interact with in the 14 days after the event. But we all know Dana is a greedy ratfuck.

>You can’t expect people to sit home for the next year until a cure or vaccine is in place. They’re taking every measure possible. What more do you want?

I'm not. I'm expecting people to stay home until the r0 is under control, after which gloves and masks are still worn in public until a population-wide measure like said cure or vaccines is available."

The US has 1 million infected and 58k deaths. It is the most severely impacted country in the world, and the response has been proportional, if late. What works in countries with 1/50 (or less) the infected count and 1/30 (or less) the death count does not work in the center of the pandemic.

The depression is going to happen whether you like it or not. The UFC hosting 249 isn't going to change anything for the economy on macro level. The UFC hosting 100 events in a row won't impact the economy.

Nah. The brand cares about ESPN/legal platform views, because those are the only numbers it can collect. That's how they calculate ad reach. I've paid for PPVs before. I'm not paying for this bullshit card because Dana is a public-endangering greedy tomato fuck, and ESPN/UFC won't make a cent from either PPV money or ad views off me

>>Doesn't mean Dana isn't a piece of shit for endangering his ""contractors"" and UFC employees, as well as the hundreds or thousands of people that his contractors and employees will contact for 14 days after the event by exposing them to a higher risk of infection.

Read before you continue to misrepresent my argument.

>Just lol. Bye selfish hypocrite. Don't let the door hit you on the way out. 

There you go again with ""selfish"". You're advocating for a few dozen people to get paid 5-6 figures, and in the process endangering the health of hundreds or thousands of people, and I'm the selfish one?

Another garbage filled comment lacking in substance.

You keep going on and on about your precious economy. Tell me then. How much is UFC249 going to boost the economy? What, a half dozen fighters and event staff get paid? That's your idea of a recovered economy? We're heading into the worst recession since 1919, and UFC paying a dozen fighters and a few dozen event staff is single handedly going to repair the economy? 

The salaries of a dozen fighters and event staff is not sufficient reason to endanger hundreds or thousands of people. Matters of public health is not Dana's or the UFC's call to make, and whatever income UFC generates for itself and the few workers and fighters involved is not worth the risk to the general public."

Entertainment sports and especially contact sports like MMQ, however, is *not* essential by any reasonable argument whatsoever.

MMA fighters don't get to skip ahead of every other professional sportsman and say they're essential because their economics are strained. *Everyone's* economics are strained. Doesn't mean you risk the health of your fighters, your fighters team, and every single person these people will have physical contact over the 14 days following the event. If Dana actually wanted to support his fighters through this time, pay them living stipends. 

Dana is an irresponsible and greedy piece of shit trying to meet the ESPN event requirement to make money at a time where none of this is at all important. If even one single person gets infected because of this event, directly to the fighters and their camps or indirectly to the hundreds or thousands of people the participants will contact within two weeks after the event, then it won't be worth it. If someone, god forbid, dies from this event, it's on Dana's head (though by the looks of it, fans wouldn't even hold him responsible lmfao.) Risking public health for private moneymaking isn't a call a private citizen should make.

I'm still going to ~~watch the event~~ sail the high seas because I'm bored out of my mind and need entertainment. But that's because I'm an MMA fan. I could easily work, study, watch Netflix, work out, play boardgames with the fortunate people I'm on quarantine with; there's dozens of ways to entertain myself without risking public health.

ucla,fpfeee7,t3_gd4owa,1588568816.0,"Okay, so I don’t usually post or even lurk on here (at least not anymore), but I have been checking in the last couple of weeks to monitor activity on this sub related to USAC and the current election. And I must say that I’m sick and tired of seeing this subreddit constantly insult and talk down on USAC. I’m involved in USAC and me and those in my office were talking last night about how toxic this place can be. If you don’t and can’t appreciate what USAC does for you, then it’s obvious you’re ignorant and uninformed with regards to what we actually do. 

We spend hours each week advocating for your needs. It’s hard work. And for posters on here to insinuate that our stipends and expenditures are somehow “stealing” from the student body is beyond reprehensible and ridiculous; it’s simply an absurd notion that holds not even a shred of truth. It's deplorable, indefensible, and outrageous. It’s nothing but hyperbole meant to stir the pot -- a ploy to spread lies about us.

The truth is that this school needs USAC and always has. Those of you who don’t share this view are simply ill-informed and incognizant of all that we accomplish. Continuing to belittle USAC only makes you look petulant, uncivil and churlish. I know this may sound harsh, but I had to tell you all straight up how this board, its members, and all students who propagate the idea that USAC should be disbanded in general for that matter are coming off: as spoiled, whiny ingrates.

The idea that USAC will be disbanded anytime soon is comical at best, absurd at worst, and a total farce overall. If you think voting for someone who says they will disband this organization will actually result in our dissolving, then I seriously question your intelligence. So, think again and think hard about what really needs to be done and what can actually be done.

You ignoramuses need to wise up a bit and support rather than bash an organization that does so much for you. And when I say ignoramuses I don't mean those with valid, constructive criticism. I'm talking about the credulous nimrods who spread and believe anything negative they hear or read about USAC.

As for those people, I’ve honestly never seen a bigger group of whiners than on [r/UCLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCLA). You can bash USAC all you want but the truth is that, regardless of whether you like us or not, we will still continue to support you in every which way. USAC is by the people, for the people, and of the people; pretending that it isn’t is laughable. And I’m laughing at all these silly posts and the lame ducks who continue to co-sign them. 

Is USAC perfect? Not by any means. But I know for a fact it’s a lot better than you cynics claim it is. To quote another USAC affiliated member who defended us in another post, here's a bit of what we actually do:

USAC also works each year to get students scholarships, loanable items (like chargers etc.), and has started incredible initiatives like community gardens and food closets (for students who can’t afford meals). USAC also lobbies for students and the UC system in Washington. I’ve barely scratched the surface here, but USAC members actually do a lot of work to help the campus.

If you can't appreciate that, then there's something wrong with you and your attitude, not us. If you can't realize and acknowledge the countless ways we support this campus and the student body, you're myopic and an enemy of progress at UCLA. 

Joking about and bashing us in the derisive way you've done the last couple days is simply sad. It's honestly pathetic. And I'm not sensitive in the slightest bit or one to get angry over criticism because I actually appreciate a funny joke about USAC and student government in general every now and then, but the stuff on here? Pure crap. All of you who continue to take a hard stance against USAC can take a hike. 

I’m honestly embarrassed that this subreddit let this happen. The moderators on here should be ashamed of themselves for not controlling the content and letting this propaganda against USAC continue, and for letting current students poison the well for incoming students who now probably hold a jaded view of USAC. Shame on you. It seems like the moderators on here are as incompetent as the anti-USAC trolls claim we are. I remember when this sub was a decent place to post back in the day. Sure, it wasn't very active but at least the moderators weren't total dullards and the posters total buffoons. Now it's a total madhouse.

I had to make a throwaway account to post this, but I did it because I’m so tired of the anti-USAC crap on this board. It's irritating having to sit here and read all of these lies about us. And I know this won't be received well, but it absolutely needed to be said. I really hope you guys can get your act together because, honestly, it’s embarrassing. You’re not only embarrassing yourselves, you’re making UCLA look bad. I’ve never been more ashamed to be a Bruin.

Signing off from this toxic place for the last time,

Bye.
