berkeley,fpehuys,t1_fpehotp,1588547851.0,Thanks for the input. How would you rate his exams and/or curve?
berkeley,fpehqhl,t1_fpeh0ro,1588547784.0,ahh well that's a bummer. At least the material in CS70 seems to be pretty consistent between iterations so in the worst case I suppose we can just look at other professor's webcasts on the material. Thanks for the input!
berkeley,fpehmcx,t1_fpehevz,1588547722.0,"rip :( your feedback about OH and exams is reassuring though. Thanks for the input, I really appreciate it!"

Bingo."
berkeley,fp8bw21,t3_gbxozx,1588388470.0,"couple factors at play here:   
1. CS classes @ Cal are larger than almost every other undergrad CS program (often n times bigger, in fact). Higher sample size will obviously lead to higher number of cheaters.  
2. Berkeley arguably cracks down cheating more aggressively than most universities (using programs like MOSS, making large Piazza posts asking students to confess, etc.), which inflates the perception of the problem and makes it seem like there are more cheaters than are actually there. Course staff telling the entire class that they are suspecting kids of cheating != a significant amount of the class being cheaters."
berkeley,fp4pnze,t3_gb6n4v,1588304346.0,"Berkeley easy. If you have even the slightest interest of doing anything datascience/CS or quant related with your stats degree then Berkeley is a no-brainer. Though, you can't go wrong with either, and many could argue that the student life at UCLA is better. I'd say go to whichever one you vibe with more. There are 0 opportunities that UCLA would close compared to your alternate reality self that went to Berkeley instead."
berkeley,fp4p7m1,t3_gb749w,1588304052.0,"in the unfortunate case that you actually do end up getting fucked over and can't attend Cal anymore due to costs, consider attending Berkeley for a semester, dropping out to reserve your spot in the future, doing classes at CC, then enrolling back in once you've saved money by doing as many classes as you can at CC. Your spot at Cal will be kept and you won't have to go through the process of applying to Berkeley all over again like a normal CC transfer student.  See here:  https://redd.it/frvz4e"
fragrance,fp0vqvk,t1_fp0uv7d,1588218015.0,"1. high quality ingredients not typically found in designer (oud, leather, japanese plum, truffle, tobacco, neroli, just to name a few).  
2. Scents are very focused to absolutely shine in a specific situation or vibe. Almost none of TF private blends could be considered a grab-n-go ultra versatile fragrance like Sauvage or BdC.  
3. Niche pricing  

This is just my opinion, and I know there are plenty who wouldn't consider the private blend to be niche."

berkeley,folu68b,t3_g807er,1587870561.0,"1. Use the search bar on this subreddit (and other places). If you're serious about being a CS major, learning how to properly utilize search to find answers to already asked questions is crucial.  

2. You're a junior. These questions are largely irrelevant for now and you're likely setting yourself up for heartbreak if you get rejected by trying to form an attachment to Berkeley this early on. Focus on what's relevant now, try your hardest, and once you get accepted, you should start asking these questions."

berkeley,fo92ao0,t1_fo8w2ur,1587608934.0,Try posting on the EECS 101 piazza or on overheard at UC Berkeley FB. Make a post on here too. It would definitely get a lot of traction.
berkeley,fo91xfn,t3_g6e1a2,1587608697.0,"I don't have the knowledge to help you out on this situation, but about this:
>""Raj properties has said that they have a waitlist, so it seems as if it is completely not in their interest to help us out.""  

I'd take this with a grain of salt. This could simply be scare tactic by the landlord to pressure you into paying rent. Raj properties (along with Everest) is known for having a scummy reputation. Right now, demand for housing for the next school year is pretty much at an all-time low for this time of year due to the pandemic fueling rumors about an online fall 2020. I'd be very skeptical of this so called waitlist. I think you shouldn't be too worried about getting blacklisted (assuming that would even happen) by Raj. There are tons of landlords out there, and i really doubt you'd have a problem finding a place."

Do you think I have a decent chance of being able to work this into my lease deal? We haven't signed the lease yet. How much leverage do you think students really have here?

berkeley,fo8h6oj,t3_g6achn,1587596476.0,"Considering that course staff explicitly said   

""Do NOT under any circumstance submit to the form if you did not look at past official solutions or copy off someone/let someone copy off you.""  

I would say yeah, you did. Try to contact course staff asap and explain the situation. Maybe you can still be saved."
berkeley,fo5qqrf,t1_fo56qll,1587532795.0,oh wow i didn't know that. I really hope Sahai isn't teaching CS70 again. I know he's set to teach 189 in the fall which mostly eliminates any chance of him teaching 70 but I'm still super scared he will

berkeley,fnmzqyi,t3_g2oh0a,1587081389.0,"I'd do Hug 61B. 61B is arguably the most important CS course you'll take during your Cal career, and serves as the foundation for every software engineering interview. You'll probably want the extra time to really process and digest what you're learning, and like you said, having an amazing prof like Hug will certainly make things better for you.  

Unless you're in a rush to learn DS&A for the upcoming recruiting season, I don't think there's any reason to speed through 61B over the summer. If anything, just take breadth classes or another class that counts towards the CS degree.  I.e: Data 100, EE16AB, or any Math/stats class would all be a fine alternative."

berkeley,fnb85qt,t1_fnb7pbm,1586810901.0,Nah I took it Fall 2018 with Holston. Sad to see that the class hasn't gotten any better over the semesters and that different professors haven't changed it's enjoyment factor.
berkeley,fnb7lo2,t3_g0qees,1586810618.0,"Most favorite: Stat 134 or CS61B or Music 27 (this last one was amazing, try to take it for one of your breadths!)

Least favorite: EE16A or Anthro3AC,"
berkeley,fnb7jz7,t1_fnb3lb7,1586810594.0,completely agree on Anthro3AC being the least favorite. Idc how lenient the grading is. Having a class as boring and unenjoyable as that one is absolutely soul-crushing.
berkeley,fn96pwr,t1_fn8ahd0,1586761354.0,"Real shit? Idk about you but that combo sounds absolutely brutal lmfao. 61C is already the hardest of the 61 series, and 170 is deemed by many to be on the same level of difficulty as 70, if not harder. Many people on EECS 101 already consider just these two together to be very hard. Add in another heavy pset class like 110 and it gets even worse.   

Maybe OP is in the upper-echelon of Cal CS/Math students, but for the *vast* majority of people, that schedule is gonna be soul-crushing IMO lol."
Monitors,fn8sbb3,t3_g07prj,1586748967.0,"In the same boat. Really hoping the 24G2 gets restocked quick. It checked all the boxes: 

- Under $200
- IPS
- 144hz
- tilt/swivel/vertical adjustment"
berkeley,fn8o9wr,t1_fn8nvxg,1586746192.0,"not at all. I know plenty of CS/EECS majors that took Math1A their freshman fall and Math1B that following spring. One could argue that you'll be more prepared for Math1B (and math coures at Cal in general) by taking the time to take Math1A at Cal.  


The only downside is you'd be relatively behind compared to a lot of your peers who've tested out of 1A and/or 1B. Which probably means you'll prolong EE16A/B. But honestly that shouldn't matter and you'll still be ontrack to finish your degree on time.   

P.S: Most wouldn't call 1A (or any lower division math) an ""easy"" class. The rigor and curve of math at Berkeley is completely different and unlike anything you've probably ever been exposed to in high school. This isn't to scare you though -- all it means is that you'll be forced to adapt (in which case you'll be fine)."
