ucla,fpco9sy,t1_fpcg383,1588507779.0,I only have space to take it in winter though...
ucla,fpc7l7g,t3_gck03j,1588490315.0,"Departments like mine wont even let us pnp major requirement classes. Because of this, I'm taking everything as a letter grade. This has been seriously affecting my mental health terribly."
ucla,fpc7a2d,t1_fpatlm0,1588490009.0,Can I take ftv 33 before ftv 4? Trice seems to teach in the spring it seems. I know that 4 isnt required to take 33 but I just want to make sure they wont assume we know stuff haha.
ucla,foteees,t3_g8vkm4,1588051527.0,Cluster 60a is super easy and interesting! PM me if you have any more questions
ucla,fote585,t3_g9cfrw,1588051322.0,I totally feel you. The physics department also said the same exact thing. It's very annoying that they're also being very inflexible with their requirements. I'm taking all my classes as letter grade because I am not allowed to take pre manor reqs as P/NP. Its putting a huge stress on my mental health and anxiety.
ucla,foo8i1l,t3_g85r0h,1587934562.0,Physics 1a and 1b. Kms
ucla,foirtxw,t1_foiree5,1587794973.0,I wasnt in Global Health unfortunately. I was in the Tech and Innovation LLC. I did make a great friend there and we're pretty close now! We had an event where we went to JPL and did a tour there. It was super fun!!
ucla,foiqw9x,t1_foiezub,1587794140.0,"That's good! All of the intro CS classes are taught in C++. I used free resources like codeacademy.com and such to help me gain an understand of CPP and coding in general. If any CS majors can elaborate, please do!"
ucla,foiqo1x,t1_foio7bi,1587793943.0,"VERY likely. So likely in fact that I didnt even know that saying that you were interested in an LLC basically forced you into one. I had two planned roommates but they fucked me over and put me into an LLC with two random roommates (who turned out to be horrible btw) because I just clicked that I might be interested and forgot to change it when I got roommates. 

Rant over. Sorry lol"
ucla,fobzx3s,t1_fo9ebcr,1587665555.0,"Hey! I'm an astrophysics major! Ngl the stress will be there, but that's for any major. I've had a lot of stress but thats all a part of the game. You'll have to go through some stress, but make the right friends and study buddies and you'll be able to get through."
depression,fo5x1xx,t1_fo5x04h,1587538519.0,Then why am I a single and lonely fuck lol
depression,fo5uu1p,t3_exo6f1,1587536413.0,I'm worthless. I am useless. No one would care if I killed myself.
ucla,fo4tz5j,t1_fo1k8s9,1587511164.0,"You wont, dont worry. Plans change"
ucla,fnxxuq2,t3_g3hvk5,1587348712.0,"I have a 2 in 1 laptop/tablet and it saves my fucking life. I dont need a binder to carry my shit around, just my laptop. Its super organized and environmentally friendly!"
ucla,fnxxpxk,t1_fnxozyg,1587348625.0,"The lab reports are pretty terrible and I did them with my group last quarter. Once I found out I needed to do them by myself, I yeeted out of 4BL this quarter lol."
ucla,fnxt5em,t1_fnxk63f,1587345797.0,"Hi! I'm a first year physics major and I have a PC. It honestly doesnt matter what type of computer you have, but Windows might be easier in the sense that all the profs and teachers know how to work with those. But again, I would put whatever you're comfortable with as a first priority."
ucla,fnpx77m,t1_fnppeum,1587153633.0,"It does seem like you're a tiny piece of the puzzle when you come to UCLA, its true. However, you can find smaller groups of friends within your dorm or clubs you join. It will be hard in the beginning, but try everything you can to expose yourself to new people and you'll definitely find people you click with. I'm personally not into Greek life (I would say that a majority of people are not into it) and I've never been to a sports game before. I found many people that are the same major or take the same classes as me that I connect with. You dont have to be into parties or sports to come to UCLA haha. Many of my friends arent sports people, but we have fun together in our dorms and eating dinner. You can go all 4 years without going to a party and you'll find a lot of people who dont want to do that either."
ucla,fnnw4wp,t3_g2uva9,1587103583.0,Physics dept is being a bitch too
ucla,fnaisfm,t1_fn8fr8g,1586798236.0,"In terms of your last 2 questions, college will be stressful no matter where you end up going. It's a balance and it will take a while to find the balance between academics and social life, but I assure you that you will find it. Also, I wouldnt say getting classes is hard, it might be hard getting the times you want. I have certain tricks and know how to play the game so I end up getting my ideal schedule in the end haha."
ucla,fnaho9m,t1_fn9f9a1,1586797684.0,I did random and I hated my roommates lmao. The two girls were very disrespectful and didn't acknowledge me as a person. Make sure you lay ground rules with whoever you live with. I wasnt adamant about what I wanted so I ended up letting them walk all over me.
ucla,fn4p78i,t1_fn0vs89,1586646002.0,100% agree. Sometimes I like getting dolled up for class and other times I just throw on a hoodie and flip flops and brush my teeth. No one cares how people really look.
ucla,fmx5dvh,t1_fmx544l,1586458761.0,"No, you are open to pretty much every option except the deluxes. Im not sure about university apartments though."
ucla,fmwi2an,t1_fmwdtsx,1586446966.0,Not really sry. All the rising sophomores have most likely taken the deluxes. Classics are still an option though.
ucla,fmp6bb6,t1_fmm9dr9,1586275242.0,"Hey! I'm an astrophysics major. Honestly, if you just email all the profs doing research you're interested in, you're bound to get at least one that's willing to accept you. Dont worry about that until your second year though, physics profs usually only want undergrads that have done their lower divs or at least finished the 1 series."
ucla,fmibfi0,t1_fmib9a7,1586106225.0,I usually leave at 4:20 or 5:20.
