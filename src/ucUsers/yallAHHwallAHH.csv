For ex: when i see the ted bundy tapes and the level of manipulation that guy used, and how doing everything he did was a means of pleasure to him, I should actually be compassionate, like i wish i could talk to him to make him see the wrong of his doing, while he plans how to chop me up/have sex with my corpse.

I think a lot of humans just feel “compassion” because they have a mini messiah complex.

If instead the initial comment had used “empathy” i would have agreed. The exchange students don’t us to be compassionate. They need us to be able to *empathize*, because that is the only way to tackle xenophobia, at least the only non-violent way."
