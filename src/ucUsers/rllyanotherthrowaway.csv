rutgers,fp42gxs,t1_fp42569,1588290380.0,imaging using this time of international crisis and apocalyptic plague to take advantage of the limited proctoring to cheat on an exam while students with integrity actually stress and work hard for their scores.

berkeley,fmv7pr0,t3_fxm34k,1586408333.0,"Firstly, nothing I recommend here is NECESSARY to declare the 3.3 major even if you don’t have coding experience. 

Study CS61A the summer before coming to Cal. I recommend doing all the HWs up to the first project and then completing the first project. Once you get your Berkeley email you should be able to access all the lectures as well. This is all available in cs61A.org

Then every semester sign up for CSM, and to be part of small group CS tutoring. This all available to you for free and honestly helps a lot in reinforcing the material."
berkeley,fmv3ft8,t1_fmv21mh,1586405112.0,It really do
berkeley,fmrdagq,t3_fwxe9k,1586319937.0,"I got into both and chose Berkeley. I visited Cornell twice actually since I seriously considered ED there and then again once later. Both times I absolutely hated it. I actually realized then on my visits that I really wanted to go to a “city school” and Cornell is actually in nowhere. Also I’m OOS so the cost was the same for me. 

As for declaring. I was able to declare pretty easily but I had a ton of programming and math experience. I have the opinion that if you believe you can do well in Cornell, then they certainly have a comparable program and the 3.3 GPA should not be an issue for you."
