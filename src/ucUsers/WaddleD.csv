breakingbad,fpmglu7,t3_gea4py,1588732633.0,That’s the impression I got. Maybe Hank finding out about Heisenberg from a book was like an extension of this.

Considering all the effort with the set design, I kinda hope the same tunnel shows up sometime so they wouldn’t have spent all that effort for one scene..."

It’s relatively close to the beginning, so after very memorable moment is over the rest of the movie is kind of a blur. Now, I don’t know if it’s the fault of the original comic or the film adaptation."
betterCallSaul,fpdzig3,t1_fpdqul9,1588537356.0,He seemed liked he was close to Juan Bolsa in one of the flashbacks. Turns out Bolsa has been in many more episodes of BCS than BB.
betterCallSaul,fpdhga2,t3_gcufkm,1588527061.0,"Context: Jesse is feeling guilty about the deaths of Mike and Drew Sharp, so he goes to Saul with $5 million in two duffle bags (callback to Bagman?) in an attempt to get some of his own money to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp. Saul tries to talk him out of it, but Jesse threatens to ""do it himself,"" leading Saul to make a half-hearted to promise that he'll fulfill Jesse's wishes. However, immediately afterwards Saul calls Walt warning him about the matter, which prompts Walt to visit Jesse and talk him out of it with his usual manipulative pathos. Jesse is still feeling guilty about himself, and ends up throwing his money around in public until he's picked up by the cops."

betterCallSaul,fpca6h7,t3_gckn25,1588492952.0,that entire scene had a weird blue filter and was pretty unsettling. Usually that filter tends to be reserved for flashback scenes.

betterCallSaul,fpbz9ri,t1_fpbyw1r,1588482750.0,The insider podcast. However one part that I can't believe is practical effects is the one wide shot showing Lalo on the front lawn in front of the wall at night after he came out of the escape tunnel. That looked like total TWD-style CGI.
betterCallSaul,fpbksqq,t1_fpa3f1k,1588472303.0,Thought it was a little naive of her to ask “something’s up with you” when she should very much know that’s he’s a veteran of a notoriously (at least in-universe) corrupt police force.
betterCallSaul,fpbkm3k,t3_gc7pbs,1588472180.0,"They said the wall was entirely practical effects, and it looked pretty convincing at the time, but I have to say after inspecting a freeze frame more closely, it looks very obviously plaster or something like that."
betterCallSaul,fpbkd99,t1_fpad3uc,1588472017.0,You’re being downvoted but I think you’re right in the sense that if they hadn’t gotten the casting right the character very much could’ve fallen flat.
