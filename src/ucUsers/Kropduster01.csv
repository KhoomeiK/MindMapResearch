options,fp4gkqt,t1_fp3k78h,1588298590.0,"If May 15 comes and your option is still in the money, your broker should automatically exercise the option for you and you get the intrinsic value of the option"
options,fp4gbxb,t1_fp3k78h,1588298438.0,"If you have an American call option that‚Äôs ITM and you haven‚Äôt reached May 15 yet, you never want to exercise because then you only get the intrinsic value of the option, and ignore any time value. As for when you should exercise, it is completely up to you and if you believe the stock price will go up further. If the stock goes down, your call may later become OTM and have a lower premium if you decide to sell it."
