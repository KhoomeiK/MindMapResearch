VoluntaristMemes,fpe2uz4,t1_fpdzxx2,1588539254.0,"Do you somehow stop working the second you become rich? I don’t understand. Jeff Bezos makes 80k a year. His net worth is what other people think his assets are worth. If you don’t think his assets are worth anything, you don’t have to buy Amazon stock or do business with them. If enough people agree with you, his net worth goes down. But they don’t. So to answer your question, yes, he did achieve it and, on average, people think he deserves that evaluation."
VoluntaristMemes,fpdzjiq,t1_fpdvj7m,1588537373.0,"Who are the people who aren’t workers? Isn’t everyone a worker? The money isn’t supposed to go anywhere other than the business/property/etc it was invested in. I’m not sure what you’re even talking about. If a VC gives you money, your business can now grow larger and employ more people. If I buy a yacht, that keeps whichever company that built or sold the yacht in business, keeping its employees and potentially growing."
VoluntaristMemes,fpdtpxa,t1_fpdtd0b,1588534040.0,How do you hog money? Most people who have money invest it because otherwise you lose money by “hogging.”
VoluntaristMemes,fpdnqbl,t1_fpdao5v,1588530617.0,What resources?
UCSC,fp846fo,t1_fp74mrc,1588382986.0,Large companies already do that voluntarily with their employees.
UCSC,fp7jtie,t1_fp67qzp,1588371966.0,My CS classes are always full of nerds who watch Chinese cartoons all day tbh. Like if we’re in a big lecture hall they’d yell out dumb shit during lecture. It’s hella annoying. When they’re alone outside their friend group they’re super quiet though.
armenia,fp545om,t1_fp4qtr1,1588315713.0,Gotta stay away from those mormon mercenaries.

armenia,fohibev,t3_g7aap5,1587766460.0,Are they referring to the Armenian highlands as the Kurdish mountains? Wtf?
RoastMe,fofefvb,t1_foes0aa,1587734034.0,Don’t disrespect our grandmas like that
armenia,fo7yhk2,t1_fo7qeti,1587586724.0,That’s all up to you and no one judges you for it. I just thought this was the best comment regardless of your situation or who it applies to and yet it’s being downvoted.
armenia,fo7lsmm,t1_fo7c7h3,1587580515.0,Idk why the best comment in the thread is downvoted.
quityourbullshit,fo6dqaf,t1_fo5o8dj,1587555778.0,Who says they’re not?

cringe,fnyp7nd,t1_fnymyys,1587370525.0,You don’t believe that I’m not ok with being sexually harassed?
cringe,fnygynv,t1_fny7xp9,1587362780.0,"How about just don’t touch me if I don’t know you like that, regardless of your gender or orientation. Just because people don’t say anything at the moment doesn’t mean they don’t care. A lot of people are non confrontational and don’t want to draw attention to something that will cause even more awkwardness and make them even more uncomfortable. Or they don’t want the people doing it to get in trouble despite how uncomfortable they feel. It’s happened to me plenty of times. I’m a straight man and I definitely do give a fuck no matter what your gender is."
AppleWhatShouldIBuy,fnxf8py,t1_fnwzx0b,1587337409.0,"I'm planning on maybe fixing the screen first then selling it on letgo. Do you think this is the move or just selling it straight up? Also, isn't the screen the same ppi just smaller? I kind of liked my 6s, so I prefer the size if that's the only downgrade. Otherwise, it seems like the only other possible downgrade is battery."
applehelp,fnunpjc,t1_fnumke0,1587266494.0,I got the 128. I'll probably try selling. I'm assuming it would probably go for at least $200+ if I fix it. Everything in the box it came in is untouched.
applehelp,fnuiyun,t1_fnuivf4,1587263209.0,Ah okay. I understand now. Thank you.
applehelp,fnuiofp,t1_fnuijnh,1587263012.0,"Yeah, sorry. Here it is. [https://imgur.com/hMaapqo](https://imgur.com/hMaapqo)

I had it for a while and despite the size it's really annoying me."
applehelp,fnui41b,t1_fnuhloq,1587262626.0,"So is the apple website's estimate of $120 trade in value not accurate? For the trade in questions I just said it has a scratch on the touchscreen and everything else is scratch free and in good shape, which is all true."
AppleWhatShouldIBuy,fnuf7j1,t1_fnueez8,1587260700.0,"I see. From the research I've done, I understand the SE has the A13 and 3GB of ram. I honestly don't care about Touch ID or Face ID or the bezels. Apple website says I could get $120 in trade in value but that's just based on me answering some questions."
AppleWhatShouldIBuy,fnudtew,t1_fnudi8k,1587259871.0,Wouldn't that be an entire process and hella expensive?
cringepics,fnqinh8,t1_fnqh0dn,1587165370.0,"If she wasn’t a bad parent, I don’t see why you wouldn’t want to maintain a relationship with your own mother regardless of how annoying you think her personality is. What makes you think you’re not an annoying millennial who finishes sentences with unnecessary question marks to her? Did she not raise you properly despite your flaws?"

armenia,fnh2cq1,t1_fnh259z,1586952970.0,"Giving the state more power by allowing it to violate the most fundamental human right isn’t the solution, whether or not that’s true, which it isn’t."
armenia,fnh20vc,t1_fnh1sck,1586952703.0,"Violating a right isn’t protection. If the state can do this, then it can do other things too under the guise of protecting certain groups and having good intentions."
armenia,fngz5zg,t1_fngy6ej,1586950184.0,It's limitation on speech.
UCSC,fnf3o5s,t1_fnf3b0j,1586900819.0,I applied for both but put jk over the other apartments. I’m affiliated but not guaranteed. Would you say there’s a good chance I get it?
UCSC,fnf0tsi,t3_g0u2xc,1586899343.0,What’s the difference between the j and k and other apartments in Kresge?

mildlyinteresting,fmxfcdj,t1_fmvqeql,1586463938.0,"I lived in Yerevan in the 90s and 00s and if you google Ararat, the clear pictures you see of the mountain over the city is literally the view I had from my balcony. There has never been any pollution interfering with the view. It’s literally the clearest thing you see if you’re in Yerevan."
todayilearned,fmvbh6z,t1_fmhwy1r,1586411460.0,Refer to the comment you replied to.
armenia,fmm9e9x,t1_fmlej2v,1586201220.0,lol they really created a website called Armenia.az that’s hilarious.
