surfing,fox4s3i,t1_fov584j,1588134059.0,literally every session for me. surfing central coast CA with nothing but a 3/2 on year-round
UCSantaBarbara,fowfg0r,t1_fow917c,1588118732.0,"My confusion is the cost comparison between in-person orientation and online orientation. I definitely support the salaries of the students and staff working on the orientation, however I am curious as to the actual cost of the online platforms vs the cost of running the orientation at UCSB. I'm planning on reaching out to [sa-orientation.ucsb.edu](https://sa-orientation.ucsb.edu) to see if they can provide a price breakdown. Additionally, freshman who don't pay for it are stuck with a worse pass time--yes, there is the option of not paying for orientation, however you get penalized with a worse pass time."
UCSantaBarbara,fowbkt1,t1_fow8krg,1588116627.0,yeah but if we don't pay for it we get a worse pass time :/ it kinda feels like class priority is being held ransom
UCSantaBarbara,fow8h5o,t3_g9xia3,1588114958.0,"If we don't sign up for orientation, will we get worse pass times? It seems like the advising and introducing new students to the university could be done outside of orientation by assigning current student volunteers to incoming students; my only concern would be not getting in the classes I want. Can anyone provide insight as to if the freshman who sign up for an orientation have better pass times than the freshman who don't?"
APStudents,fo1eceq,t3_g54ljq,1587431450.0,"For me, finding other people in my classes to set up zoom study sessions with has been super helpful. It makes me start studying at a certain time and prevents procrastination, as well as letting me get to see my classmates."
UCSantaBarbara,fnnphk8,t1_fnll49g,1587098074.0,"I'm wondering if ft would be harder to store a board at than chi-5 though since it's so many more stories, seems like it would be easier to get a board down from the second floor than the 10th. Do the dorm rooms typically have room for a few boards, as far as you know?"
UCSantaBarbara,fnnpbzx,t1_fnjtimr,1587097956.0,Do you think a 7'2 would fit in the rooms?
UCSantaBarbara,fnjs7gp,t3_g1hcdk,1587005771.0,incoming freshman here... what does ivp stand for? and cu?
UCSantaBarbara,fnjrrfa,t3_g1ktg8,1587005478.0,I feel like the lagoon is pretty iconic as a UCSB location
surfing,fnexz6f,t1_fndrjbb,1586897913.0,How does liter convey more than length? haven't really grasped how liters impact surfing as much as length of board impacts it
APStudents,fn1btc1,t3_fyoy6k,1586558786.0,I don't understand how it could be significantly harder than the FRQs of the past without it being unfair. The practice and videos they've released all seem to reflect the same level of difficulty as past exams so either it's going to be super doable or they're going to completely screw us over.
APStudents,fn1biik,t3_fyq3tr,1586558615.0,i honestly can't see how there won't be technical difficulties. it seems inevitable
APStudents,fn1bf5n,t1_fn095h4,1586558561.0,Wait for real? They have college students take the test?
Spanish,fn19qwf,t3_fycifz,1586557613.0,¿Cómo descubriste tu nivel usando esa escala? Me gustaría descrubrir el mio pero no sé donde puedo tomar el examen para descubrirlo.
UCSantaBarbara,fn18b6f,t1_fn11uby,1586556789.0,Is it an invasive species?
berkeley,fmyv11p,t3_fqdm9d,1586496615.0,How is the outdoors scene on campus? Is it easy to access trails on a school day and find people to hike with?
ucla,fmyuo8s,t3_fnc65u,1586496299.0,"Any environmental science or Spanish majors I could chat with about the departments? Currently deciding between UCSB and UCLA, curious to hear what your experiences have been like with either of the departments."
TheFrights,fmmzeso,t3_fv4xke,1586215021.0,THANK YOU they haven't posted it yet on igtv and i kept checking but now i found it here! so glad i'm getting to watch it :)
UCSantaBarbara,fmm10w3,t1_flzc5r4,1586196797.0,"If you're comfortable answering, what were your stats GPA/SAT/AP credit wise? I was denied from the honors program and am trying to figure out why,"
surfing,fmkcxks,t3_fvsjxu,1586150905.0,"SLO/Central Coast area definitely isn't SoCal, but most beaches here are open. Surfing is explicitly allowed, just the parking lots are closed:

[http://www.morro-bay.ca.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2361](http://www.morro-bay.ca.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2361)

But I've also seen posts saying that Huntington Beach is still open, not positive if that's accurate though.

Edit: Huntington is definitely open, just saw a vid from yesterday of people surfing."
