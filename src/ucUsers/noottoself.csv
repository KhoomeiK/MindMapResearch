ucla,fpmmjs6,t1_fplwyfy,1588736412.0,imagine flaming usac for making accounts to downvote anti-cub and then doing the same thing to spew orion propaganda
ucla,fplj4iq,t1_fplgcul,1588713635.0,"Thank you for saying this
the amount of accounts that were created exclusively to support orion or to support USAC around the time that the CUB drama was crazy and i’m surprised people haven’t picked up on it or have willingly ignored this from one side. 

like i remember a comment on one of orion’s posts saying “i didn’t read this cause but whoever denies that this guy is smart is crazy” and i was surprised to see that it had so many upvotes despite how much of a bad example it puts. they may or may not be real but it shows how people are avoiding actually learning about candidates"
ucla,fpi8ieq,t1_fpi4vmx,1588635787.0,"i really think you hit the mark on how polarizing this usac election has been. while i think usac has definitely not been receptive to student needs in the past, i definitely think that this referendum is a step in the right direction and would be something to show for all of these student fees. i do think that people are fair to be wary of usac though, especially considering how they look at a lot of the student body. 

you are right about the labeling though, as i think that is USAC’s biggest failure in this election. they have alienated a huge amount of students by calling anti-CUB students racist. 

i really appreciate this detailed response, because i was very anti-CUB at first (check my post history if you don’t believe me) and have turned around by doing some of my own research on it, and i myself have already spoken on how high student fees are already. however, lowering fees themselves is a different topic. 

it appears a majority of people on both sides of the argument take any opppsing stance as an offense to their own morals, and it doesn’t appear to be getting any better. any pro-CUB or FTP speak gets downvoted here, while any pro-Orion or CCI gets silenced elsewhere."
ucla,fpi6r27,t1_fpi4fid,1588634780.0,"i definitely did make an overgeneralization when it came to financial aid and those who don’t receive it and i apologize for that. i wish that i took that into consideration before i had voted. 

however, i think it isn’t too much of a stretch that it will be back to normal by fall. based on how california is opening up (which i personally disagree with), i think there will be some type of reopening of UCLA by october."
ucla,fpi1rea,t1_fpi0xii,1588631963.0,"yeah that’s a fair point. i am pretty lucky to be able to afford it admittedly and i know my case isn’t the majority. i still think that it’s a good idea to vote yes, even if you think you may not be able to afford to, since CUB has measures in place to counteract that. 

CUB says that students who do receive financial aid effectively pay $0 due to 25% of the fees being returned to students (source: CUB facebook page) who receive financial aid. is it fair to assume that students who are financially burdened by it take financial aid from the university?

the referendum also won’t take effect until fall 2020, which i hope is enough time for things to return to normalcy, but if it isn’t i hope usac does push it back more."
ucla,fphxdhh,t3_gd6c0j,1588629563.0,"im not part of usac or associated w usac in any way but i would just like to say, maybe consider voting for the cub referendum, if you can spare the extra 45 dollars a year. if you can’t, then you have a good reason not to. 

while it’s obvious the way that usac dealt with everything involving the referendum was absolutely trash, the referendum itself is a pretty good thing. if you look at the fb page for it, it says what it will go to, so all of the unaccounted money that people are asking about (i.e. not going to the BRC, is going to offices for transfer student orgs and minority student orgs). The reason the BRC is so important is that black students have the lowest 4 year graduation rates at about 54%, compared to white and asian students at about ~75%, when you look at this [survey from 2013](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/ug-outcomes).

maybe you may see it differently, but i think it’s clear that the current resources for black students aren’t enough. personally, i’m fine with giving up 15 dollars a quarter to help them succeed. if you aren’t fine with it but have the money to do so, i suggest you read [this article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/i-dont-know-how-to-explain-to-you-that-you-should_b_59519811e4b0f078efd98440). i realize it’s huffpost so i know it’s not the epitome of journalism, but this article resonated with me. 

if you have the spare money to afford the referendum, but are still voting against it, i’m curious as to what it is. i won’t judge i promise. and sorry for the wall of text"
ucla,fp4v0ju,t3_gaqf30,1588308104.0,"Although I do agree that there needs to be change to how USAC works, I don’t think that this is the way to go about it. This would most likely only work in a completely homogeneous society, but UCLA is a diverse campus. 
To use your soup example, even if you do have a well-mixed soup, if you want a bite of carrot or something, you’re not likely to have a bite if you only have a small amount of carrots. 
I might not be well-versed in stats or anything (I have yet to take the series) but humans aren’t something you can expect to behave in logical ways. In matters that affect them, like school politics, they aren’t going to always think about what benefits the majority. What will affect them, their friends, the people they care about?
The failings come when you choose a randomly selected group like this: 3% of the UCLA undergraduates are black or african american. that’s 1 person out of an assumed 30 people council. Their needs will immediately be silenced, although they may need them more. 
While the math works, I don’t think it’s a very equitable way to do it. Some voices need more support in order to be heard. I’d like to hear what you have to say about this, and I’m open for my mind to be changed."

ask away!"
ucla,fnk2sfk,t1_fnjv4de,1587013304.0,"Yeah, I took a look at the FB. There are some specifics but there isn't a timeline or even where it's gonna be built. Is it gonna replace an existing room in Kerckhoff? idk tbh

I agree, like I think it's definitely a good referendum, but there's so much anger on both sides, and refusal to hear anyone out that it's crazy. Maybe both sides are focusing on a very small and vocal minority but what can you do?

I hope this whole thing blows over soon cause I don't think UCLA can function without USAC, but the way that USAC is running is unacceptable.

I do hope that the CUB referendum passes too, but maybe at a later time? Maybe using opt-in student fees and leftover fees from what isn't used for coivd relief? Marginalized students do need this space, and now more than ever."
ucla,fnjrgid,t1_fnjeli5,1587005281.0,"Definitely, even with the current support, it’s still super difficult for marginalized students to succeed at UCLA, based on how I’ve talked with them. 

I just don’t really see the point in increasing tuition with excess funds since we already pay ~$200 per year/quarter, not sure on that amount. I know a lot of people who would benefit from not paying that. 

When it comes to the referendum, it’s pretty vague. While I have no doubt about the well-meaning intentions, I think it’s still pretty vague on what the plan is for construction and what purpose it serves? If we were told specifically what it’s for, I think it would be better. Although I am part of a group that would benefit from the referendum, I still have no idea what I’m getting from it. For example, while they do talk about the meditation spaces, what other spaces will they build? what resources will they provide? I feel I have a right to know details :/

To give USAC some credit though, it’s still a lil sus that when it’s going to marginalized communities, people get upset. It might just be unfortunate timing with the pandemic tho."
ucla,fnjci7v,t1_fnj4grs,1586996209.0,"I think a lot of the outrage is not at the CUB referendum itself, but the fact that it is asked at a time like the current pandemic going on, where it’s expected for USAC and affiliated bodies to have excess funds since there is no events going on campus. 

USAC’s response has also been condescending towards students who are dissenting, which doesn’t help the already negative perspective that most students outside of USAC have."
