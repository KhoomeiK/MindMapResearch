UCSD,fmdld3w,t3_fumfiy,1585970818.0,"I just finished this class last quarter and I know it seems overwhelming in the beginning but by the end it does turn out okay. Having multiple drafts and due dates help for those assignments to keep you accountable and on top of things because you’re not waiting until the last minute to complete the proposal, annotated bibliography, and essay. Also, Liz is great because she is super helpful and tries make the strict rules of the MCWP bearable. I struggled and got an F on my proposal, a B- on my annotated bibliography, and I’m not sure about my essay grade, but I think I did well, because I pulled off a C+ for my overall grade (not the greatest but I’m just glad I passed lmao). So don’t worry too much and good luck!!"
