datingoverthirty,fp1c083,t3_galgt4,1588230544.0,"Very mature of him to communicate what he feels and very mature of you of breaking up and stand up for what you want. 

We tend to idealize a relationship and this behavior and lack of honesty leads to toxic relationships full of lies. 

Truth is, it’s really hard to find a life companion. This implies someone that expects the same from life as one for the extension of their life.

To “settle down” sometimes means “let’s build a family”. That is the only way I see someone would settle down, by having strong human connections.

Otherwise I would just move to a new place whenever the chance comes. A new place means new adventures, new experiences, new people. 

I found my life partner and have been living together for 8 years in total. We married last to years because we were confident we are together for the long run. 

We didn’t want kids because we didn’t feel ready. However, I had grandiose career ambitions that led us to move to states every 2-3 years. 

At the end, she wanted to stay close to her family and aging parents. I wanted to continuing pursuing my career goals. 

That’s why we broke up. Not because we stopped loving each other or because we didn’t get along. It was because I didn’t want to settle down with her. 

Life is hard on its own. Having a partner can make it half as hard or twice as hard, and we don’t know unless we walk the path.
