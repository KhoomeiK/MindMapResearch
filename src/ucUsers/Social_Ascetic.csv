AskMen,fp934x3,t1_fp91g68,1588412496.0,"Hard to say because I don't know what your comparing and everyone bases their comparison on different factors. 

Gas is cheaper, insurance for me is cheaper but that's also dependent on the type of bike I have as well as my driving experience. Maintenance is a bit more expensive but that's cause I neither have the tools or the time to do it myself. Gear is expensive up front but if you get decent gear it'll last you years. I ride way more than I drove my car so that adds up. Parking is significantly cheaper. I buy tires more often on my bike than my car. Registration is more expensive than my car was. Up front purchasing my car was more expensive. This is only a comparison on my 2019 Yamaha R3 vs. my old 2002 Toyota Celica. 

If all factors were equal, I'd definitely say a bike is cheaper. But they aren't and they vary too much from a case to case basis. My previous point about costs was that not all bikes are going to be cheaper than owning a car and people make that assumption too much."
AskMen,fp92kb3,t1_fp91fcu,1588411859.0,"That's understandable. A motorcycle is great but it's not for everyone and considering where you live and your circumstances, it doesn't fit your lifestyle.

AskMen,fp8vra4,t1_fp8v2io,1588404676.0,"People really underestimate how much goes into getting a motorcycle. I'm glad you're saving up because gear, insurance, and maintenance all cost a pretty penny. Don't know much about the Buell XB12 but I test rode the Sportster 1200.

AskMen,fp8qh8l,t1_fp8q9a6,1588399686.0,I get that. A lot of my family and friends were against it but i couldn't pass up the deal. It's considerably changed my life for the better. Nothing better than taking a ride up and down the coast.

The bus was around 1 hour and 15 minutes. I'm surprised you found downtown more affordable. I would've figured that it would be similar if not more than UTC prices. The commute from there to campus will be rough when classes go back to in-person instruction. Also, parking is just horrendous."
UCSD,fp3fq89,t1_fp3ey9q,1588278514.0,No argument there. I was looking at the summer session fees and what ticked me off was that they're expecting people to pay over $200 in facility and student activity fees for an online summer course. It's absurd.

UCSD,fp1gfv7,t1_fp1g7xh,1588234673.0,I've read that as well and have gone through the process of establishing residency as an out-of-state student. They were very picky on the timeline of events to establish residency.
UCSD,fp1ftgy,t1_fp1dvaq,1588234076.0,I do not think that your workaround will actually work in terms of the time limit. Financial independence has to be established two years prior to enrollment. I don't believe that they'll take it if you just add a legal dependant on this year's taxes.

UCSD,fp0ojfc,t1_foz9t6i,1588213492.0,"So, first of all intercollege transfers are fairly uncommon. There is a set of criteria that you have to fulfill before being considered.

1. As a transfer, you cannot apply for an inter college transfer until your second quarter at UCSD. You also must be under 150 units. 

2. You must have cleared ELWR and have completed the appropriate writing or core course(s), which includes ESL and ELWR if required.

3. You have to have completed HUM 1 and HUM 2 or equivalent courses prior to your transfer.

4. You must have a cumulative UCSD GPA of 2.50 or higher.

5. You must have a quarter GPA of 2.0 or higher.

6. You must be able to demonstrate that you can graduate two or more quarters sooner by transferring colleges. You will be required to complete and attach two quarter-by-quarter plans for graduation: one for your current college and one for the proposed new college. (This is by far the most important one and why it's so difficult to transfer colleges). 

If you're approved for ICT, you will not have to complete MMW 121 & 122. This is why they make you complete your original writing sequence at your college prior to filling out the application for inter college transfer.

Edit: a word."

Wondercon tickets aren't too expensive but SDCC will cost you. It's also a lottery system which kind of sucks. I was lucky enough to get a 4 day vendor pass because I was friends with the booth owner my first time. Second time was when a family member had a panel and got me in for another 4 days. 

Yeah, that seems like the general consensus on how long this lockdown is going. Mid year 2021. This seems like obvious advice but please don't move somewhere before getting a job there. Too many people are overly optimistic about their job prospects and end up homeless cause they jumped the gun a little too quickly.

It really depends on what you're into and which part of the cons you enjoy the most. I lost interest in SDCC since they've shrunk artist's alley and the traditional comic book booths. It has become a bit too commercialized for my taste. It's also ridiculously packed and you have little time to chat and get to know people. Feels like you go in to either browse or buy stuff. I've enjoyed panels but some of them will waste your entire day away.

Wondercon is great in that it's one of the smaller cons so you get to meet people and actually have time to get to know them. I've really enjoyed the artists there. Made a lot of friends and acquaintances. That's also why I liked SWC as well cause you get to know so many people who are into things that you're into. 

I've also enjoyed designer con and pin and patch con but those are also smaller ones. Designer con especially because there are so many interesting things there.

I've heard good and bad things about expo but haven't been. Don't have a dedicated friend group in that community and I don't like where it's located. 

Also heard decent things about morphicon but haven't been. Not a bad location in Pasadena but I'm not big into that community. 

Sorry for the long response."
