UCDavis,folc5ny,t3_g7yzmr,1587859104.0,"in general, the parking garage is nearly impossible after around 10am. Unless you wanna valet and do the stack parking. I usually just started parking in the Hutchinson garage but even that one is getting pretty full too and some busy days they do stack parking there. I just got use to parking kinda far away from my classes and biking a farther distance then usual just so I can guarantee myself a parking space"
