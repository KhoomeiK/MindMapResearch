NeverHaveIEverShow,fp2xkis,t3_gaeq43,1588269565.0,"Early 20s here, abd something i like besides from the diverse casting and the fact that its a story about the relationship between immigrsnt parents and american born children is that their culture isnt the main focus of the character but isnt ignored either. I find that a lot of portrayals of asian americans in shows often either ignore their culture entirely or make the plot too focused on their culture/heritage. I think this show is a good balance, as from the pov of a child w immigrant parents, my culture is definitely part of what defines me but imo theres other interesting things about me too, lol.

But diversity/culture aside, something i really like is the realistic portrayal of the main high school characters. They are not portrayed to be likeable, but realistic. A lot of teen shows show the main, unpopular girl's main flaw as being ""too shy,"" which is just unrealistic and puts unrealistic expectations on high schoolers, bc to be honest high schoolers are generally NOT likeable, not bc theyre terrible people, but bc high school is hard and teens are young and dont quite know how to deal w all that pressure. Like devi's comment about wishing nazis would kill ben was definitely not written to make her likeable, but i still laughed not bc im murderous or whatever, but bc thats a realistic thought from a high schooler (i definitely wished some people at my high school would disappear, lol). But yeah, i really appreciate devi's character being realistic and not just likeable. Hopefully they do the same w paxton in the next season so he doesnt just play the stereotypical popular/jock kid."
NeverHaveIEverShow,fp2sc51,t3_gax1ni,1588267075.0,"This is one of the few things that bothered me about this show. All the other characters are played by appropriately aged actors, making paxton seem even older in comparison"
NeverHaveIEverShow,fp2p4s7,t1_fp2kgc5,1588265540.0,"Yes!! Im asian american (though not Desi) and agree w everything you said. Additionally to what you said, devi is an extremely complex character. Her character isnt just defined by her desire to get a bf/have sex. Its portrayed very clearly that she also has academic goals (princeton!) and other things that define her. It bothers me when mindy is criticizes for making her characters date white men/sexually active because shes just trying to normalize this type of portrayal for asian american women. and like i said, its not like her characters are defined by the guys they date. Plus, as others have atated, a lot of other female characters DO date men who are poc, and they are very attractive and well rounded characters."
NeverHaveIEverShow,foxjqgs,t1_fov89yw,1588146161.0,"Agreed, i really loved the andy samberg ep. I am hoping they make a paxton-focused ep next season to maybe understand his character more"
NeverHaveIEverShow,foxjh5v,t1_fotlas5,1588145924.0,Same!
NeverHaveIEverShow,foxjdto,t3_g9ew8d,1588145839.0,agree!!! I love this show abe love the representation/diversity.
NeverHaveIEverShow,foxiix2,t3_g9rfoz,1588145062.0,"I see where youre coming from, but i actually think this show does a pretty good job of diversity. Paxtons group of friends is diverse. The ep where they go to Indians acknowledges there are a lot of other Indians in the area. Additionally, Sherman oaks isnt as diverse as other la neighborhoods so i actually think they did a good job of representation/diversity in this show."
csMajors,foquawb,t1_foplzpc,1588000956.0,A couple of schools in ca are considering
UCI,fokufvk,t1_fojv63t,1587849161.0,Im in both their classes too and definitely agree! They really try to help as much as possible
UCI,fokudq0,t1_foiv2bw,1587849128.0,"Same, im dying in that class but gotta say its organized and she really tries to help out as much as she can. (Those late passes are also lifesavers lol)"
casualiama,fogcqcy,t3_g73g07,1587750899.0,"Dang did i write this im behind in all my classes and have no motivation or focus to do anything. hope you know youre not alone in this, OP. I know its easier said than done, but its a weird time for everyone so dont be too hard on yourself! I know a lot if schools are doing credit no credit too, to help with this difficult time."
thevoice,fo9n0uk,t3_g6fqma,1587624410.0,"I really like her!! Imo she definitely deserved to win her battle/knockout because her technique is amazing, as is expected from someone classically trained like her. shes also versatie and can sing any genre"
UCI,fo46gxi,t1_fo3fcz8,1587499010.0,literally same lmao so many regrets
acne,fnv7n2v,t3_g3y500,1587283059.0,same :(
KimsConvenience,fnjvlnm,t3_g1xnej,1587008036.0,"not every immigrant can take english lessons. And, some languages are completely different than english whether it be sentence structure, grammar, tense, etc. Unlike spanish which also has latin roots like english and thus has similarities, korean is probably completely different. Im dont speak korean but i also speak Chinese and in chinese, there is no past/present/future tense in the same way as english (changing suffixes) or plural forms of verbs or nouns (i.e. there is no 'are' or 'is' - it's the same). So its definitely harder to learn english coming from a non-latin based language, and the grammar mistakes are completely normal."
