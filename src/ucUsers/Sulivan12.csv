One of my classes is making the midterm worth 50% of grade so yeah there’s that :(. Also I think he’s making it theory based so that people wouldn’t just plug the questions into a calculator."

UCSD,fp8zi12,t3_gc20ql,1588408564.0,"He did this last quarter as well, he chooses random people, but mostly people who did well on the exam. I think he just wants you to tell him the steps you used and formulas etc so he knows that you didn’t cheat."

UCSD,fowi3p8,t1_fow9ije,1588120212.0,Oh shit same
UCSD,fow0c21,t3_g9v9x6,1588110689.0,"They should notify you like a week before you get your refund to tell you if you owe anything or not, then a few days later they will send another email saying they sent the refund and that takes 3 business days for direct deposit. I was notified last week and just got my refund today :)"
UCSD,fov2e31,t1_fout5np,1588094270.0,"Wait really I thought there were 3, looking at webreg, who’s your prof"
UCSD,fotk9a0,t3_g9gvdy,1588056531.0,Which section tho
UCSD,fotjyl1,t1_fotjocq,1588056259.0,He was cool until he pulled out that 20e final last quarter
UCSD,fopwwe4,t1_fopwbf8,1587974873.0,"Damn, alright man thanks, would you say to book an appt with the office if the sanctions end up being pretty bad"
UCSD,fopvb4u,t3_g8vujq,1587973325.0,I mean I go over the notes like the day before so I know where everything is so that I’m not lost during the test
UCSD,fopv8pl,t1_fopucjv,1587973260.0,"This is my first one, but I mean I am guilty and the only thing I think that I can do is apologize for doing what I did"
UCSD,foovvl3,t1_foov85x,1587947567.0,"I don’t think so, cause part of the letter says also that if I don’t respond within a few days they are gonna assume I accept responsibility"
UCSD,foovgqb,t3_g8kuob,1587947313.0,"Yeah the workload is a lot, I also feel like he makes the written hw more complicated than it should be, comparing it to the online hw"
UCSD,foig0wt,t1_foiedd1,1587785777.0,"No they haven’t yet, they just gave me those two options, I think that’s what they mean by the sanctioning process. Also I really don’t have anything to say other than accepting responsibility."
UCSD,fod0ouw,t1_focrrjn,1587678392.0,"It depends I think, cause they took out the ucsd grant, and if you went over the amount of dining dollars that you had to spend this quarter they will charge you for that. Also depends what type of room/dining plan you have"
UCSD,fo8qnwn,t1_fo8hu98,1587601858.0,Thanks man
UCSD,fni3fr7,t1_fngya2l,1586973317.0,"I mean in person classes you could only be late/ miss class twice the entire quarter, so it shouldn’t be any different for online class"
UCSD,fngqqzo,t3_g1frsd,1586941464.0,"I’m pretty sure almost every professor that thinks that you’re not going to go to lecture tells you that you are taking up space that others can be using. Also I feel like mcwp TAs are used to having students right in front of them so that they can talk to them whenever, so I think they are trying to create that same scenario over zoom. And cmon, everyone else that took the class before had to deal with attendance/participation and maybe a shit TA, so you can too"
UCSD,fn9dbp8,t3_g07f2k,1586768540.0,"Wait so I had the 1700 dining plan and I ran out by the end of winter quarter, so I was adding money every week. Does that mean I’m gonna get charged for using my spring allowance"

UCSD,fmh24fb,t1_fmh06h3,1586064320.0,"I mean, yeah my topic was about Latin art stuff, but still nobody wants to dedicate so much time and effort on just 1 topic, you’ll get used to it throughout the quarter. Just gotta stretch out your arguments to make it easier. Trust you’ll do fine"
