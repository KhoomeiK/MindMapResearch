piercing,fmh4j3a,t1_fmh3sab,1586066503.0,So the jewelry is titanium at least that’s what I was told by the shop who did when I asked. I have been cleaning it with saline spray again starting about a week ago I had kind of stopped for a little while because I was under the impression that wasn’t necessary after the first few months but I bought a new can and I’ve been trying to treat the piercing as if it’s brand new again. And okay I should buy some mouthwash :). Please don’t think I’m gross for not having some already lol I try to live a low plastic lifestyle
