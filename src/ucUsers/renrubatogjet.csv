Also it's easier if you're interested in the classes you're taking. Something that doesn't get talked about is how no one really has their life in order so most people are behind on lectures/readings once its the middle of the semester. If you learn how to adult and stay on top of stuff, you'll be fine."

Since they're cosigners on the loan, they should technically have the right to decide what to do with the money. However, it seems like you're right about this and that they're not seriously considering your argument (as parents tend to do). Since you're the one with the power to transfer it, I would make them sit down with you and break down all of the financials so that you all have a clear picture of what the potential scenarios are. You'll still probably disagree after that, and in that case I'd say pay off your loans but make a plan with your parents in case the worst case scenario in their mind happens."

As a result, it makes no sense for the individual to do it because they're inconveniencing themselves without slowing climate change. Why would I go out of my way to make my life less convenient when I know that I can't control everyone else, so my actions are ultimately going to be in vain? These people you're talking about might actually change their lives if there were some sort of social agreement or law so that everyone did it, not just them."
unpopularopinion,fp8zfef,t3_gc2wwz,1588408488.0,"I feel like we think people are softer than they are and consequently we behave towards them in a way that reinforces it. The problem is people fear things ending badly or think that the person's not going to be able to handle it, so they're nice/fake unless the situation is drastic. Then the person reciprocates the niceness because it's weird/awkward to call someone out when they're always nice. This cycle keeps going and then when it's eventually time to confront the person about something, it feels like a bigger deal than it is."

If you think about it, you still had to do most of the homeworks and learn most of the material. That's a lot of learning + assignments over a course of 4 years. What made it seem easy was that they gave you a strict schedule to follow with teachers in each subject to guide you. Basically what you're going to realize in the near future is that it's not about your intelligence or what your potential is, the challenging part about life is consistently trying every day and taking easy steps to accomplish something ""hard"". I could even draw up a day-to-day plan that looks easy but would get you into a Harvard-type school, it's just that there's going to be days for most people when you don't try or are focused on something else.

unpopularopinion,fp8vgb4,t3_gc1xde,1588404358.0,"I agree but let me give you a potentially scary scenario. We know companies access our microphones and use that data to tailor ads. The government could just as easily access our cameras/pics + phone recordings + search history to clone us. They already know our interests, can figure out many of our opinions, and can roughly figure out our cognitive abilities. They can use social media to figure out who we interact with, and how deeply. Although the clones won't think exactly like us, they could come pretty close. Once they have a clone of you who's to say that they won't kill you and replace you with the government-controlled clone? The benefits to them are obvious, but the power in the US government is distributed too widely to actually carry out this unethical operation. But consider about another country where the power is more concentrated. The technology may or may not exist to be able to do this currently, but what about in 20 years' time when technology will have advanced and 20 more years worth of data will have been collected?"

If it's some messed up shit that other people need to hear about and take action on, then the therapist should have to convince the kid to report it.

AmItheAsshole,fp7atwd,t3_gbpr6h,1588367162.0,"Either NTA and ESH. I think a good test would be to see how long he takes on his own instead of doing it yourself after 30 mins. With gamers, one game could last like 20-30 minutes so you can't expect him to drop everything within 5 minutes and finish a chore. So if he had done it by himself after like an hour, then no harm no foul bc postponing cleaning by an hour is not a big deal. If throughout the day he didn't do it all, then you have a strong example to show him why you should be frustrated. He's TA for saying one minute when he didn't plan on doing it in one minute, but that's kind of a gut reaction when someone asks you to do something while you're completely focused on a videogame."

NoStupidQuestions,fp1jkhg,t3_garxdk,1588237711.0,"It's a concept called schadenfreude and there's basically 3 different reasons. One is based on group identity and is the idea that your group's status is validated because the other group messed up. The second is that your self-worth and confidence increase because the other person messed up. The third is that you feel pleasure because a ""bad"" person is being punished and getting what they deserve. Also, this feeling is intensified by a lack of self-esteem apparently.

berkeley,fotrrxh,t3_g9ie6a,1588063807.0,"I used to make a 4 year plan of what classes I'd take before every semester for my first 3 semesters here but I've stopped doing it since. I also decided on a major in my third semester so none of my plans resembled what I actually did lol. Especially with multiple paths, the key is to figure out what courses you'll end up taking no matter what and what courses are necessary to ""unlock"" many future courses that you might want to take. Even if you don't like them, take these general/basic courses first so that you'll have more room to take specific major-related courses later on when you have a better idea of what you want to do. You have to take at least one major specific course tho bc this'll help you decide on a path. Then narrow down the options for a particular semester by professor for all the classes where it matters. In terms of looking for classes, I use the course catalog because it gives descriptions/prereqs of all the classes in a department.

Also, front-load your schedule (not 1st semester freshman yr tho... that was a mistake) because you have more motivation and time for classes as a freshman/sophomore."

While there were definitely some things that annoyed me and some things that annoyed him, it was overall a pretty good experience.

TooAfraidToAsk,foq2vzs,t3_g8w3tx,1587981007.0,"My theory:

The world's population is obviously increasing pretty quickly. Due to increased media such as the internet, people are more aware of opportunities and the benefits of money are obvious. So even though the amount of work needed as a whole is decreasing, the competition to get jobs is increasing. As an employer, you're always going to hire the better candidate for the same pay even if both candidates surpass what is needed. This competition drives up people's hours and ultimately makes employees (and prospective employees) work much harder than what is healthy - because it's more likely now that other candidates are willing to work an unhealthy schedule for the same wage. As a result, they are more beneficial to an employer unless you're willing to do the same.

Also, this is the result of unnecessary consumerism. For example, do we really need 5 different coffee shops and 10 fast food chains in a 1 mile radius? People from 100 years ago would say no but we want more and more options nowadays, so as a result people have to work more."
TooAfraidToAsk,foq13ir,t3_g8ssrk,1587979132.0,"So I used to smoke weed basically every night. One of the side effects is that you sleep easier and stop dreaming (or at least you don't remember the dreams). The first few weeks after I stopped really fucked me up because I either stayed up all night staring at a wall, thinking about how exactly I'd respond to tough/confrontational questions by those close to me, or I had vivid dreams involving people that I hadn't thought about in years. Obviously you get over it in a matter of hours, but it's pretty crazy how much we block out of our memory.

Idk if anyone else does this, but the tough/confrontational questions scenarios especially fuck me up because I search for examples in order to give a complete explanation to the figment of my imagination, and this always unearths new memories"
berkeley,foq03my,t3_g8bxqj,1587978105.0,"Personally, discovering myself was really hard as I came in as one major (A) but had always considered two other majors (B and C). Over three semesters, I kind of just realized that I didn't like A classes as much as B or C. Additionally, I did a lot better in my C classes than in my B classes, plus C made more sense in terms of career options so I ended up choosing C. Throughout this process I talked to a good amount of my friends/classmates about their future plans, and that definitely helped me figure out what the potential career paths would be. At the time, I kind of knew what the logical choice was but didn't feel confident because I didn't want to limit myself by committing to one path. It took maybe 9 months for that confidence to come. Also I still take B classes just to make my education interesting, but I take them all pass/fail because I know that they're mostly irrelevant to employers/grad school admissions ppl.

So basically, you probably have an idea of the 3-4 subjects that you're interested in. My advice is to take classes from all of these and try to envision which subjects you'd want to take like 7 more classes in. This probably narrows your choices down to 2-3. From there, think about the different career paths that each choice offers and choose the set of paths that you'd prefer. Don't worry if you don't feel secure about your choice, my choice was obvious af in hindsight and I still took forever to make the decision and even longer to feel confident about it. Just be informed about your choices and trust your gut at that point."
berkeley,fopw9ry,t3_g8ndkd,1587974252.0,"Ik this is supposed to be a joke but on some level it seems like you believe it.

berkeley,fookxon,t1_foncyza,1587941031.0,"Ik this is harsh but keep in mind this stuff applies to me too. I always think of it this way. It takes a special kind of drive to get into a top academic program. For the people who aren't geniuses (like actually) and aren't perfect in terms of time management, they had to lead an unbalanced life in order to achieve what they did to get here. Whether or not they're aware of it, they sacrificed a significant aspect of their life. If they made this sacrifice, then they either sacrificed their physical health which in turn fucked up their mental health, or they had less of a social life. If they had less of a social life, it's either because they didn't have the option or because they chose to prioritize academics over friends. If they chose, then they're less inclined to be social than the average person. So overall, it makes sense that many Berkeley EECS kids are socially inadept. 

To be fair though, all throughout school I rarely did homework with or studied with my closest friends so that's probably why I consider academics and socializing as taking different time slots. Some people are socially fulfilled by taking classes with and studying with their friend group though, which makes it less of a sacrifice but also makes them less well-rounded because their lives are centered around school."

berkeley,fngqil1,t3_g1ll19,1586941219.0,"Imo guys have a higher threshold for making themselves presentable than girls. What I mean for a guy being presentable is shaving, wearing nice clothes, fixing his hair, etc. A lot of guys don't do these things to go to class (especially as the semester goes on and all the cute girls stop showing up), but would for a date/party. And like shaving especially can make a dude look completely different. Idk much abt girls makeup but I get the vibe that there's a basic version which a lot of girls do every day and a more extra version which they do for actual events. But regardless, I rarely see girls with their hair in absolute disarray or girls with horrible (objectively) fashion when they're going to class. 

TLDR: Girls are naturally hotter, and this is exacerbated by the contrast in self-care routines for an event (school mid-semester and onwards in this case) where you're not trying to impress anyone."
