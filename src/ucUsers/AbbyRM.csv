curlyhair,fp6xbjn,t1_fp6e1e0,1588360218.0,I started CGM with Cantu curling cream and actually ended up switching to EcoStyler gel because Cantu left my hair pretty oily (even when using a small amount) and it made me feel like I had to wash my hair every day. I do feel like it tamed my frizz a lot better and gave me more defined curls but I sacrificed that because I couldn't deal with the oily-ness.

plantclinic,foo2qht,t1_fonw3a6,1587931351.0,I don’t think any of those things happened but who knows. My other maidenhair that was pretty close to it is doing great which is why this is so odd
plantclinic,foo2miz,t1_foo02x5,1587931288.0,Thanks!
plantclinic,fonrlzj,t1_fonqnm0,1587925104.0,Interesting. My other maidenhair had died completely after I first got it (prior to me figuring out how to take care of them) and cut off all the brown leaves and it has regrown for the most part. My dilemma with this one is that it hasn’t turned brown like my other one did when it was dying so I’m not sure if the leaves can be recovered
plantclinic,fonmzfi,t3_g8iiph,1587922590.0,"Its been getting quite hot here (95F yesterday) but she lives in the bathroom where it’s nice and humid. I watered here less than a week ago, but I went to shower this morning and saw her like this. She wasn’t even completely dried out. 
My other maidenhair that is right next to it was not affected or changed at all. Still looking great. I’m not sure what the problem/fix is for this one?
I showered her with some cold water and let her drain then put her back on her shelf but I’m wondering if there is anything else I should do to get her back to healthy."

If you want to get into a class you’re waitlisted for, as your prof who in the department you should email to inquire about when/if more spaces might be open."
houseplants,fnj054u,t3_g1vuag,1586989486.0,My maidenhair is a bitch too. She’s living in the shower right now because she didn’t like the window or anywhere else in the apartment. Trying something new and hoping it works.

UCSD,fmqbi56,t3_fwpf9m,1586296505.0,I'm enrolled in this class also and it is sooooo interesting! My mom has been watching the podcasts that he's been uploading of lecture just so she can better understand COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 and she thinks his lectures are pretty digestible aside from some molecular biology that might be a bit over some people's heads. I've only had to explain a few things to her.
