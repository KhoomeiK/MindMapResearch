Many people have bad environments back home where they are not safe/welcome. It’s not fair to assume that it’s easier for everyone or even most people to move back home. Believe it or not, IV is a lot of people’s only home :)"

doordash,fp3pbcy,t1_foy2z1o,1588283360.0,Oof I probably wouldn’t take those orders either. I guess I’m lucky bc my Walmart has been taking around 10mins max to bring out my orders. The fact that they’re even allowing anyone to freely go in & out of that nursing home right now is scary :/
MakeupAddiction,fp12ev6,t3_gaazwu,1588222573.0,So gorgeous. Btw you look a lot like Lily-Rose Depp. 😍

doordash,foycf1s,t1_foyaogu,1588169940.0,"Hey I get you, relationships are tough. I’m not the perfect girlfriend either by any means and I believe you that it’s way more complicated than just what you posted, I’m not claiming to understand your relationship by any means. My original comment was really just to point out why the other dude said you seemed romantically interested in the customer service girl after you denied it. I have no idea why I’m still responding hahah I’m pretty bored too can’t sleep"
doordash,foybar5,t1_foy8mry,1588169319.0,"So what are you trying to say- she was into you? Lol...I’m not trying to be mean but it’s honestly really weird how you remember every single detail of your call with some random customer service girl. A random girl who was just doing her job and was probably just bored so she kept the convo going and thought nothing of it. It’s almost sad. I guess you’re right that I don’t know if you’re a garbage boyfriend from a single post, but I do know that I would be sad if I knew my boyfriend was seriously attempting to flirt with some random customer service girl while I was in the next room. But I won’t “attack” you all day, this has honestly already been strange enough hahah"
doordash,foya7ur,t1_foy99b9,1588168699.0,If you’re not happy then why not just leave? It’s your relationship obviously and I don’t really care but just a thought I guess. Seems like you’re missing something in your relationship and searching for it elsewhere.
doordash,foy7rag,t1_foy5zas,1588167215.0,"3: you literally said she “sounded cute” and were contemplating asking her for her instagram even though your girlfriend was in the other room lmaooo she wasn’t into you, just good at her job my dude. Garbage boyfriend"
doordash,foxzb61,t3_ga7h3t,1588161163.0,I actually like the Walmart orders :o you just park in an orange spot & a Walmart employee comes out and puts everything in the trunk! Better than getting out for the food orders imo
