holdmyfries,fotxu9g,t1_fotx74f,1588069976.0,"Thats a seriously flawed conclusion you're drawing with the limited information you've heard from me. I never said I would do it, myself. I just empathize with the girl who's watching her man cross a boundary she clearly isn't cool with. We don't know their history. From what I've seen from this short clip, she was clearly upset and pulled his shirt to get his attention and get him away from the random girl. She didn't yell, cause a fit, or even say anything to the random girl. All things considered, her actions were mild even though they weren't ideal for a healthy relationship. But there are clearly underlying issues in the relationship that haven't been addressed well enough."

And now that I know you spent your day drinking and being unproductive, it makes sense. You really do be living a shitty life. ðŸ˜‚"
holdmyfries,fopvoho,t1_fopvj3u,1587973680.0,"And you clearly have a lot of darkness in your heart. I rather be goofy than be nasty like you. 

I'm done responding to you, you sad prick."

holdmyfries,fopucd2,t1_fopu69v,1587972406.0,"I don't care about your nonsense either. Its just sad to see people like you exist and contribute so much negativity to the world. I wish more people gave you love in your developmental years, maybe you'd be less of a scumbag. Goodbye."
holdmyfries,fopttsa,t1_fopswn6,1587971922.0,"Maybe you can get your head out of your ass and see that not everyone sees a relationship like you do. If you and your partner are cool with interactions like that with other people, that's fine. This dudes girl was clearly not. Even if she IS insecure, he's not making it any easier for her. She is HIS woman. Why wouldn't he care about her feelings? If you operate like that, then I'm sorry for you. 

And in response to the comments you made on my post, people like you are so annoying. You hide behind a screen and talk shit to people you don't know. Why would that make you feel good about yourself? You literally made no contribution besides negativity. You sound just as insecure as you're claiming she is."

holdmyfries,fopqqqz,t1_fopqggm,1587969114.0,"Good job ignoring the entirety of my comment. His girlfriend is clearly not okay with it. Generally speaking, people who have no interest in eachother don't typically get THAT close with eachother, except maybe if they're intoxicated. I've NEVER danced that close to any stranger at any event and I'm a very extroverted person who loves to dance with random people. I keep a healthy distance. You're missing the point here, or willingly choosing to ignore it.

Edit: look around the setting, is anyone else dancing like that? Everyone's looking at them, probably just as uncomfortable as his lady is."
holdmyfries,fopiqqi,t1_fonse5w,1587962555.0,"If you're referrering to the girl peeling off her man from that random chick, how is that abusive? The dudes presumed girlfriend handled it pretty well actually, she calmly pulled him aside, didn't cause a scene, didn't even address the random girl. She was clearly hurt that HER man is dancing THAT close with another woman. That is super disrespectful to his lady. If anything, he may play it off like nothing happened and that is more ""abusive"" to her since her feelings are going to be invalidated. I'm just drawing conclusions here though, none of us know the full story. In any case, she did the right thing instead of being passive aggressive about it later. Imagine how insulted she must feel that her man in publicly messing around with another woman. It's not even casual distanced dancing, they were dancing like they are flirting and super comfortable with each other. Where are the boundaries? Not cool."
IdiotsInCars,fopdou9,t1_fop5ekl,1587958891.0,Are you talking out of experience? Haha
holdmyfries,fopd9ma,t3_g8gvqx,1587958603.0,Lol give me a break. Most of you who are calling out the lady would probably be just as annoyed if you saw your man dancing *that* close to another woman. Thats disrespectful to his girlfriend.
