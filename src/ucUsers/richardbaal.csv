pics,fpmunzc,t1_fpi1l5z,1588742205.0,"Replacing F's with P's  just one of the many things they do that makes me believe they have some sort of ulterior, anti-west, liberal agenda:

There are far too many kids in these clubs that trash on Catholicism despite the Philippines being the most Catholic nation in the East, simply because it's a result of Spanish colonization. If they really cared about representing the filipino culture, they would be proud of our Catholic culture instead of ignoring and hating on it.

There are far too many kids in these clubs that trash on the US for its influence and military presence in Asia (largely in the Philippines) despite the fact that they helped us more than harmed. If not for American influence and aid, the PI would be either far more underdeveloped, or a part of Greater Japanese Empire.

I've even had firsthand experience of these kids unnecessarily antagonizing white people. Making serious accusations of racism as if every white person is somehow responsible for colonization, and I'm not just talking about making small jokes here and there. My sister's dance team was being criticized by a white judge and they immediately assumed ""it's because we're brown"" and they were like ""don't listen to the white woman"". lmao give me a break, not everything is associated with race. What surprises me the most is that virtually nobody condemns openly racist comments like this. And blaming white people for our problems does nothing but exacerbate racial tensions (which are arguably nonexistent today).

If they really wanted to appreciate our culture, unnecessary nonsense like re-spelling words that have been in use for hundreds of years isn't the right way to do it (not to mention it was created by the literal national hero of the Philippines, Jos√© Rizal). ""Pinoy/pinay"" is an even better alternative if they wanted something less westernized.

Half these kids don't even speak Tagalog, or haven't even been to the Philippines, and they think they represent our culture and manipulate it. Even wikipedia doesn't recognize ""pilipino"" as a philippine demonym.

I really didn't mean to make this into a rant thread but I couldn't hold it back.

World War I and II were retaliatory in the sense that the enemy attacked Americans first. However, while post-ww2 wars were not threatening to the US proper, the US' de facto role as the global peacekeeper meant that the US had to retaliate against any acts of  aggression between foreign combatants  (like Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in the 90's, or Somali Pirate activity). 

I guess what I'm trying to argue here is that ""retaliatory"" refers to responsive actions against not only the US, but also other countries."

It makes no sense to solely blame the bloodshed on Western interference.
