ucla,fpjl36z,t1_fpjazki,1588672566.0,I'm planning to do an internship in my home country because Corona is getting better here and businesses are reopening this week. People went back to work this week
ucla,fpcrqw2,t3_gck03j,1588510843.0,"For the love of all UCLA students, PLEASE DO UNIVERSAL PASS. I'm about to lose my shit and my midterm is at 4:30am. PLEASE UCLA, HELP A KID OUT

edt: how the hell does zoom proctoring work with 200 students?!!!"
ucla,fpa9isy,t1_fp9dd69,1588443554.0,"oh thanks so much! I read that around 30 people get in... I'm an econ major so would that put me at a disadvantage over poli sci majors who have like a goal of what they want to get out of it (e.g. connections, lobbying etc) I kind of want the experience to be honest and also the internship in a different state since I wanted to go to school on the east coast.  


If you don't mind can you talk me through the application/ interview process? what do they expect to see/ should I prep for? also did you do in your final year/quarter?  


Thanks!"
ucla,foxivsv,t3_ga0r0r,1588145391.0,"gotta love how the most concrete info I got from that email was ""we're not giving you your money back no matter what"" and ""the rest we'll figure out later"""
ucla,fowunho,t3_ga11sn,1588127519.0,you mean non- attendance?
ucla,fouoq4b,t3_g9b5fc,1588087859.0,it took mine around a day and a half (weekday) before it showed
ucla,fotham5,t3_g9hhwu,1588053909.0,"honest opinion for a class rn: glitchy as hell and the answer portion of our exam didn't work so we had to submit it with what it gave us. Also bring an ID because it will ask you for it.  I ended up using my drivers license cuz I couldn't find my UCLA ID. Also I was sneezing and reached over my computer to grab a napkin and it pretty much told me my head was out of the frame and idk if it notified my prof or not, but yeah, not the best experience tbh"
ucla,fotgxbv,t1_forjbym,1588053596.0,"oh that sounds horrible, but hopefully you get better soon! And glad to see your professors are understanding. Take care too! feel better soon!"
ucla,foquhd9,t3_g716w7,1588001046.0,"Hi, I saw your post and I was wondering how your responses were... I've been wary of symptoms and I'm scared I might actually be getting them too since my parents are also going to work, but I'm not blaming them because they have to... what did your professors say? if you don't mind sharing of course :) thanks and good luck!"
ucla,fn2kcmr,t1_fn2eqgo,1586592208.0,"I don't know how it is in the summer, but judging by the quarter load, I wouldn't recommend that class but if its just one class you should be fine"
ucla,fmyl84x,t1_fmykzn2,1586488882.0,hey yeah I just found out today... and unfortunately I already dropped one but that's fine because some of my classes were harder than I thought so I would've one them anyways
ucla,fmshg97,t3_fws8yx,1586355545.0,Geog 5 With Gillespie! What a legend
ucla,fmshe8z,t1_fmqs39i,1586355513.0,is it with Scorza?
ucla,fmrtmlo,t1_fmrbz5g,1586335026.0,oh! I just sent him an email... I saw that there are still around 20+ people on the waitlist so I hope he still takes people off or everyone off since I don't think 20 more would be THAT much given how many sections there are...  I really need this class for my last Art strand GE and had to drop my earlier class since the lectures weren't recorded. I hope he still takes people off...
ucla,fmr7iyd,t3_fwnqh7,1586315721.0,if your writing 2 is AN NEA 15W I don't recommend it because that class has a shit load of work during the quarter let alone 6 weeks.
ucla,fmea89r,t3_fuirdh,1585996030.0,"seriously?! You're complaining? Not being a douche or anything but like Harvard/Cornell gave their students like <5 days to MOVE OUT COMPLETELY and LEAVE Campus - yeah that includes travel arrangements or getting documentation to fly home if you're international. You're still able to be on campus so I don't really see why you're complaining. All you have to do is pack up... and whilst I understand that can be such a pain right now with online classes given everything that's happening it is overwhelming... but this is so much bigger than just you. Don't make it about yourself and how ""you're not okay with it"" like seriously why would you even say that. everyone has to play their part right now and you should do your part. Not saying you're not.   


Honestly, I expected they would do this because Gene Block sent an email out a while back that students on the hill may be moved around and the California Governor said they wanted to use dorms for patients. Here's what happened to me. Since that announcement came up, I packed up ALL my stuff (Dykstra hall too btw) as soon as my Friday final finished until I could make a decision on whether or not to go home and just left essential clothes, toiletries, books for finals out. when it became more likely that the situation wasn't improving I went home but I was prepared for the off-chance that this would happen and honestly, because Dykstra only left 2 bathrooms open in the ENTIRE BUILDING I knew this was gonna happen. So honestly.... I don't know why you're so surprised and acting all about ""how you don't have a choice"" - like seriously like we all have very limited choices right now and if you were on the front lines.... do you have a choice?!!!!!!! All you have to do is MOVE> just do it and stop being over dramatic. It's not like you haven't been warned this could happen too."
