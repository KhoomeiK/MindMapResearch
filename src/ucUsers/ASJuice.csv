which row is the best overall?

CrazyHand,fovz0bo,t3_g9ovbx,1588110018.0,"Try to go for grabs when you’re up close more. Her natural tendency is to throw out ranged pressure and then protect herself from close-range attacks with her shield. She throws out rising nair, neutral b, or fair/bair when she thinks she can punish a whiffed move on her shield. Just chase and grab her.

That last line came out weird."
smashgifs,fovymwv,t3_g9qvyn,1588109831.0,"The year is 30XX. Young link dominates the meta with projectile play, now that falco’s lasers are rendered useless by deku shield. Jigglypuff cannot deal with the optimized projectile play, and fox gets gimped any % offstage by arrows. The young link ditto is solely based off of who gets the percent lead.

Also Axe’s descendant carries on the torch and is the solo god of melee."

MarthMains,foncwl5,t3_g8gdf1,1587917055.0,"Since playing against ranged characters like mega man is his one of his bad matchups, huge stages like town and city where he can’t juggle well or continue tech chases suck for him

We really need to do better as a smash community to be more inviting and welcoming to new excited players coming into the scene, rather than being toxic and hating. I know this isn’t all of the community, but the people that do act like this need to remember that we’re all enjoying playing a video game we all love."

ZeroSuitSamusMains,fnr6t38,t3_g3axz5,1587180716.0,"One piece of advice: you rush in a lot even out of disadvantage (when you’re getting thrown into the air etc). From one ZSS main to another, I recommend “dancing” around your opponents moves more in general, rather than making repeated bold approaches since she’s not exactly the optimal aggro character. Especially in this matchup. Inkling greatly beats her in the rush down aspect, so she wins by baiting more approaches and converting hard off of them. Also, dair out of getting juggled is a good mixup as long as you don’t overuse it."

MarthMains,fno678o,t3_g2xvhg,1587113579.0,Apparently lighter characters like jiggs make it harder to land. I tried it on Wolf and some others and I got it first try every time.

CrazyHand,fnkdyzj,t3_g25xh5,1587023507.0,"Imo lucina isn’t exactly a substitute for Ike, so if you wish to play Ike just play him. He’s so much fun and has some great strong points. If you’re looking for a more reliable character with the same playstyle, I still wouldn’t say Lucina is a replacement for him."

ZeroSuitSamusMains,fngq329,t1_fnfpjim,1586940767.0,"But when you bring up matchups, she generally has a tougher time on battlefield, since there are no platforms to escape to.

ZeroSuitSamusMains,fn47904,t1_fn46lma,1586635481.0,"I wouldn’t recommend dair spiking for confirms to seal off stocks. Dair spiking is not that worth if they’re already at high percent and ready to be killed, which is probably what he’s asking for."
ZeroSuitSamusMains,fn472h2,t3_fzgdvc,1586635375.0,"Your real confirms at higher percents are just setups into up B. Like down smash ledge trapping, down smash reads, lucky grounding from flip kick, etc. Most of the time you’ll land a stray bair or side B to catch their movement option and it’ll get the job done. Remember ZSS’s strength lies in her mobility and dodging, so while you’re staying alive and avoiding combos or death, you have the time to condition your opponent and find a kill eventually without needing confirms."

CrazyHand,fmuk0r2,t3_fken63,1586392928.0,"As someone who’s played melee most of my time playing smash, I’d recommend not to use gsp as a reflection of your skill and experience.
1. This game is crazy different and much more unpredictable
2. Gsp and online smash are very poor indicators of skill level most of the time. They only show your ability to adapt to random players and random online scenarios (lag, 3 minute games, etc)
3. A lot of the skills from smash 64, melee, etc don’t transfer over, so your skill level (disregarding gsp) is highly dependent on how comfortable you’ve adjusted and familiarized yourself with this game (and your new main)"
CrazyHand,fmujk5q,t3_fow22h,1586392667.0,"Too many dash attacks, try mixing up your approaches with your spacing tools like the volleyball. Also, you have a pretty nice grab! Try to use it more"

CrazyHand,fmuj3hq,t3_fnlokv,1586392406.0,"It’s so unbelievably intimidating seeing the level of skill of the top players of your local PR when you start competitive smash. Even on my good days I still feel as if it’s hopeless to reach that point sometimes. But I keep playing the game because my stupid brain keeps getting motivated by things like landing sick combos or etc. After watching this video, I think I need to start thanking that part of me, for not letting me quit no matter how painful it can be sometimes."
CrazyHand,fmui5fz,t3_fi7ig7,1586391875.0,"I think you could apply more pressure in this matchup especially. Maybe throw in a couple of grabs as a mixup to get advantage state (even if greninja’s grab isn’t the best). Also, your recovery seems to be mostly side B’s initially, which can be read over time and punished."
