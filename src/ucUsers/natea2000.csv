technicalminecraft,fozrj5r,t3_gafz5y,1588195609.0,How do you stop the afk player from eating the golden apple if they get hungry (or am I just forgetting how eating golden apples or hunger works)?
SmileBASIC,foxdp7k,t1_foev0e4,1588140889.0,This really helped me out. For like the past hour I've been trying to get my sprites to work properly and I was finally able to do it. My problem was that I wasn't using page 4 for my LOADG command but instead just sort of went with 0 and I had no idea what was going wrong.
Parakeets,foulcz0,t1_foukxgl,1588086162.0,"Alright, thank you. Just wanted to make sure."
Parakeets,foulb59,t1_fotg2db,1588086136.0,"Thank you, I've been a bit anxious so I was sort of overanalyzing her to look out for anything wrong and I guess I had never noticed that sort of movement before."

Xenoblade_Chronicles,fo7xiwk,t1_fo757q4,1587586246.0,"I remember doing the same with Animal Crossing as well as Smash Ultimate. I knew that it wouldn't do anything, but I still did it because what if it actually worked this time?"
cursed_chemistry,fnpljo6,t1_fnnub10,1587147622.0,I somehow completely missed the sodium anion until reading your comment.
UCSantaBarbara,fn4lpit,t1_fn4lk1a,1586643967.0,"Thanks, that makes sense. I wish you luck with 6AL."
UCSantaBarbara,fn4l1d7,t1_fn4d7ji,1586643560.0,"This is a bit off topic, but I'm wondering how 6AL is being done online. I remember that there was a lecture part of it but how are you able to do the lab portion?"
learnmath,fkm1cil,t1_fklqkb0,1584319054.0,"Follow up question, are there different fields for specific types of non-linear transformations (such as the squaring all components of the vector)?"
