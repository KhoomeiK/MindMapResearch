AskReddit,fnii8pr,t3_g1mova,1586980449.0,I was adopted at the age of 8 by two lovely parents. I know they haven't regretted it one day of their life. They have friends who have in turn adopted multiple children because of the example my parents set. I feel like I won the lottery!

Also, a non-CS based question, how is the housing in that area, pricing wise?"
UCDavis,fnhdopm,t1_fngppr6,1586960414.0,"Any tips on specific languages to be fluent in before attending? Also, did you find yourself having to do a lot of outside work to hone your skills, or did your classes cover everything you needed to know. 
I've read that Davis's CS takes a much more theoretical approach, would you say this helped prepare you more or less for a career?"
