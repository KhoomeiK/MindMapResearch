Madden,fo5bxkc,t1_fo57jqt,1587522008.0,"That's exactly what I do. But like I stated, every time I turn my game off and go back on later, it keeps not saving it and going back to the original depth chart range. The rosters are def updated, but the custom depth chart will never save, that's what i'm trying to figure out how to do"

stimuluscheck,fnn53t8,t1_fnn4wj9,1587084600.0,Yup it's a cluster fuck. I'm hoping at worst I does at least get mailed. Gonna take a month - 2 months most likely
stimuluscheck,fnmxrz9,t3_g2kbto,1587080242.0,"I keep getting locked out because none of my AGI seem to match anything. According to Credit Karma which I used to file my tax returns, my AGI (line 8b) is -2890, it also says that when I log back into the IRS to recover my old tax documents. But it won't let me put a negative value on the page that your referring to, it's only letting me put a positve. So I saw another line on my old ta documents that also says AGI per computer is 1,110 tried that too and it doesn't work, so it locked me out today and yesterday. My tax payment that I had to make was $83, so i keep putting that down for my taxes. Any idea on how to say we made negative for our AGI?"
