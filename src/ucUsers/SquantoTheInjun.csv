Psoriasis,fpfiyq9,t1_fpfhbgm,1588572680.0,"It is up to you and me, as sufferers of the disease, to evaluate whether or not what the scientists says are true. How do you know gravity works and has a rate of acceleration of 9.8 m/s/s? Go drop a ball outside with a stop watch. How do we know that salty water from the ocean and places like the Dead Sea help? This is my testimony to you"
Psoriasis,fpfiq57,t1_fpfhbgm,1588572468.0,"My friend, I live 5 min walking distance from the Pacific ocean. I swim and surf in the ocean and know the power of salty brine and our true God, the Sun. I also undergo UVB treatment 3x a week.   


I have been to many a foreign beach. I understand what you're saying. And you are correct in some aspects.  


Obviously new chemicals produce new diseases. They didn't have this shit as much before because there was less exposure and far fewer chemicals."
Psoriasis,fpfi2wf,t1_fpfh4q4,1588571898.0,"I agree with the point on pharmaceutical marketing, now that is truly an epidemic and needs a cure  (IMO, de-privatization of medicine).

However, don't mix faith, which is essentially hope, with logic, reasoning, and methodical testing to ensure safety and repeated results, because that's all science is, really.

Faith is optimism. And optimism on its own is nothing without understanding the reality of the situation.

I have been in your shoes. But one thing you are clearly wrong about is stress being as debilitating as you think it is. It is more debilitating than you can imagine.

The thing we call stress controls the release of cortisol hormones, a neuro-transmitter, within our brains. Cortisol levels have been proven to affect various parts of our bodies, including but not limited to the pancreas, liver, kidneys,  blood sugar levels, regulate metabolism, help reduce inflammation, and assist with memory formulation. It has a controlling effect on salt and water balance and helps control blood pressure.

Stress has proven consequences for so many conditions, and I highly recommend finding ways to regulate your cortisol levels, as one human to another. Stress may not be revealing itself in ways you know - sexual tension/frustration, satisfaction from food, endorphins and exercise amount, and even socializing with others plays a part in this too..

Imagine going on vacation, all stress melts away, and then boom - in the blink of an eye, you're back to your old routine, with the same old stress triggers once again. Not really hard to see why the flare ups are a thing.

I have been struggling with my problems for a decade now, and am only beginning to touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of lifestyle and how it can combat certain things deemed ""uncurable"".

Concentrated sunlight which helps psoriasis are UVB rays. Unless you are determined to be outside for a certain amount of time, it isn't surprising that certain people haven't truly realized the power of the sun."
Psoriasis,fpff5z3,t1_fpfc4vf,1588569445.0,"Your belief is scientifically unsound and unfounded. I have read my fair share of scientific reviews to understand that psoriasis is a) a genetically passed auto-immune (more specifically inflammatory) disorder which, in many many cases, reveals itself by pustules or scaly patches, bumps, lesions, or raised skin, and b) can also be indicative of psoriatic arthritis, which commonly runs in families (hereditary). My father's father had a bad case, his psoriasis ate away at his legs arms and toenails and ravaged his body. It thankfully skipped my father, but it has now cursed me.   


Any doctor who says you cannot do anything about it is not a doctor. There are so many ways to combat this response by our immune systems.  


Meditation, exercise, nothing hotter than a warm shower to clean yourself, coconut oil, descaling techniques, an UVB radiation all have such great effects. Please, do not discredit science, or those who work in the name of science"
