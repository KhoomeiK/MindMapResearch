Unrelated, but I assume a lot of those differences in sentencing come on unconscious racial biases or untrue stereotypes, since very few people I’ve ever encountered legitimately like other people less or exhibit hatred based on race and other forms of identity.  At least things keep improving I guess?  Seems better now than 10 or 20 years ago anyway in terms of unequal law enforcing and sentencing, or maybe now there’s more attention given to the issue."
