Couple things:

The grass is too tiled in its placement and could be much denser.

The lighting just doesn't work for me. Everything is either too washed out or too dark.

Strange blur on the whole image that doesn't sit right for me.

Generally, I think the scene looked better before the 2:45 mark although the lighting is still strange."

unrealengine,fp3xhjp,t1_fp3wp5i,1588287641.0,"This is not an easy problem to solve. Think about a box that encompasses the character, that is the collision box for the character. Even if you do a mesh-based, complex collision or line traces, what should you do if the player is hanging a leg off the edge? This is honestly a gameplay decision. Some games may rotate the player to show them as hugging the edge, while some might do nothing and act like they are balancing on one foot. Some might just throw you off.

To fix the easy situation where both feet are clearly off, you should be able to modify the collider (assuming there is one) or the bluprint/c++ that controls the character. However, I presume you may run into some weird clipping edge cases if you get it too close."
UCSC,fp1fyca,t1_fp1flis,1588234207.0,"I think it was very clear what I meant. Sure maybe not legacy. But long maintained code. 

Just because Java is updating doesn't mean it is being used to create new stuff. Honestly in the software world right now, Java just isn't being used as much as it used to. There are better replacements for Java like Kotlin. The reality is, Java has nothing more than any, more modern, language like Kotlin has. Not to mention the licensing costs, large binary size, and languages like c# and .net core. Python is clearly the better choice here."

UCSC,fp13gqz,t1_fp13efx,1588223365.0,I would argue that Java is in decline. The main reason you would use Java in my experience is if you are working with some legacy codebase that requires it. This doesn't apply to you.

unrealengine,foh0mek,t1_fog0w6y,1587759162.0,Any idea on how it would work for proper two-handed weapon IK? Like where the gun is in front of the player and the hands grab onto the gun in the right places. UE IK just can't handle this right it seems. I can only get it to work if the right hand is animated in place and the left hand gets IK'd relative to the right.

"" API macros only make sense for modules that are statically imported from another module. The Core module is a great example -- almost every other module in UE4 specifies Core as a import dependency in their \*.Build.cs file.

Many modules never need to be statically imported (e.g. SceneOutliner module.) We refer to those modules as dynamically loaded modules. Dynamically loaded modules are awesome because they can be discovered at startup (kind of like a plugin), and often can be reloaded on the fly.

The API macros are mostly used on older code to allow newer modules to access it from their DLL. In newer bits of code, the API macros are used far less, instead setting up nice interface layers to expose functionality across DLL boundaries."""
