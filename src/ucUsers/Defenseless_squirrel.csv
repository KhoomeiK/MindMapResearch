Chapter 5 named after the title of the book was the most memorable one I can remember to this day and the last time I read this book was years ago. But like you said it's all subjective. It likely had that effect on me because of where I was in life at the time.

Definitely recommend everyone to read this though üëç"

missouri,fomef6k,t3_g88xbi,1587887041.0,"Hmm. It looks like an older type of English that might still be in use by residents local to the area. It reads like how we pronounce English words currently but with some variation. For instance, you can clearly make out ham at the bottom but the weird z that's written in the letter between the consonants affects vowels too. So with that in mind, if you tilt your phone 90 degrees sideways it should be easier to read and you can shove it up your butt."
malefashionadvice,fok5325,t1_fok3o5d,1587835557.0,We have rains like that here in the Midwest. An umbrella helps but only a little. Especially when the wind is blowing sideways and overways.

Thanks for the review! Cheers!"
UCDavis,fnhovf3,t1_fnho7oq,1586966279.0,I lived in Davis for years as a student. I wanna keep tabs on what keeps the students miserable and live my college years again vicariously through that
UCDavis,floo8ez,t3_fq0xew,1585342148.0,I could never finish watching this episode without fast forwarding some parts like this one. I was today years old when I found out that's what he actually said in this scene.
