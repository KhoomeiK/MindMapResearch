UCI,fn4nwg3,t3_fzdpx5,1586645242.0,My heart breaks to think of what situation leads to a person breaking into a food pantry.  This is a scenario in which I think there should be no harsh punishment; just a connection to food or other resources.
RFID,ehz80pr,t3_ax8lfu,1551940170.0,"Update: I tried a piece of aluminum foil folded several times and placed in between the two cards in the center of the wallet. It works great. Each card scans correctly from its respective side of the wallet.   
I also learned there's a word for this: ""card clash"".  If you search that term you find lots of people discussing this problem, especially people in England who use Oyster cards and contactless debit cards.   
Anyway, thanks for everyone's help here.  Aluminum foil wins the day."
