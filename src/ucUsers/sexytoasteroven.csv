Please someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that info is just so they can track where UCSD students get in and where they end up working at as a sort of performance metric. They asked me a bunch of questions about where I'll be working when I chose the industry option."

UCSD,flwd47g,t3_fr648r,1585546591.0,"I asked them about this on the VAC, and I got this response:

""Revelle College is still in the discussion phases of the GE requirements and if there will be any exceptions made to the grading option requirements. We are encouraging students to follow the current policy (only a letter grade for Humanities) until further notice. Below, you can see that the changing a grading option deadline has been moved to Week 10 so you have more time to change the grading option if the policy changes."""
