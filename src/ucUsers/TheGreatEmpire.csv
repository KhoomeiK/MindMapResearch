FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There   are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or  neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

• Rudeness towards other Redditors,

• Spreading incorrect information,

• Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No   - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the  future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote,  which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure,   mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I  undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a  private  message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to  Reddit PMs  within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of  downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept  the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior   will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes   until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a  right."

AskReddit,fnyaxth,t3_g4dyam,1587357888.0,If you are religious don’t you already personally believe we are in living in a simulation of sense? That our souls are all put on Earth as a test and when we come back we will be weighed for our actions and how we treated others. It seems you already have your answer: the creation of religion.
California,fntgcif,t1_fntftjf,1587241090.0,"When I say windy I mean like if you look at any city, take NYC or DC for example, you’ll see their streets are built in a grid like pattern. This maximizes walkability. Suburbs have this sprawling layout that’s apparent in pictures from above. The typical suburban street network spurned a Grid layout in favor of wide roads with sweeping curves."
California,fntfo96,t1_fntdd7h,1587240707.0,Cars were a mistake and so were the suburbs. They were built with the car in mind and they’re naturally windy stricture and lower population densities makes public transit impossible to implement and horrid to ride.
