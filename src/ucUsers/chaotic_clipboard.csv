Generally speaking, these will be people 2-6 years ahead of you - people 2+ years ahead in undergrad, people in grad school/industry, and people past grad school. They will give you an incredibly accurate depiction of what the field actually looks like, and inevitably the mistakes they made and the solutions they wish they did (and which you can do).

This is how you discover the depth of a specific major/field, and can paint a better picture as to ""if I do this, where could it likely go"". 

You gain breadth by deliberately talking to people outside of your comfort zone - people in other majors. If you just go to uni and do w/e, you will never interact with these people normally, you'd only end up talking to people in CNR (and CS, which is a dominant cultural force on this campus). You need to reach out, send emails, find professors and GSI's, and talk to them to understand their experience.

Recognize that everyone has some implicit bias in experience - shitty classes/internships/peers, huge lucky breaks they don't acknowledge, etc. Mitigate this by talking to a huge number of people, and then average out and **think critically** about the results that you hear."
berkeley,foo4elu,t3_g8jx0d,1587932283.0,">Traditional contact tracing is not sufficient on a college campus, where students may not know who they sat next to in a lecture or attended a party with. Digital technology can help. Several states are working to adapt mobile apps created by private companies to trace the spread of disease, and colleges and universities can play a role by collaborating with their state health departments and rolling out tracing technology on their campuses.

Translation: school-wide tracking of students. Keep an eye on this regarding privacy. Trading freedom (of privacy) for security is how the 9/11 PATRIOT Act ballooned into the mass surveillance we see today, with no path for reversal.

Unless you are comfortable with this loss of personal privacy to the school, permanently (as such policies tend to overstay their necessity into the infinite future), then contact tracing, as stated, would be almost impossible. And the other solution presented is testing, of which would be a question of test kit production volume.

berkeley,foo2qka,t1_fontw9n,1587931352.0,"In fact, I would go as far as to say it *guarantees* toxicity. Boiling down self-worth to pure career metrics, or how productive you are, leaves no room for emotional growth in understanding how to value yourself otherwise. And it leads to that comparative mindset and imposter syndrome that beats people down.

That's why, 1-2 years after having graduated and landed that big tech company job, a lot of people I know ""suddenly"" realize they aren't happy when it turns out that's not all there is to it."
berkeley,fockrwt,t1_foc5oso,1587672497.0,"One large reason that ""the situation remains fluid"" is because, as essentially a running business, they need to balance trade-offs. How much money will they lose by cutting tuition, vs. how much money do they lose by retaining tuition but losing students? (profit margins vs. revenue volume)

One reason I can think of with retaining tuition is that they get to keep the money-making whale in the room - international students. 

Out of state is ~$43,000, and in-state is ~$14,000, effectively making international students **x3 times more financially valuable**. They also have been making up larger and larger portions of campus population over the past few years. Most importantly, international students will likely be much more accepting of remote education because of travel restrictions, family obligations, as well as personal identification of where their home is (for example, the common theme of ""I'm going to America to get a degree, then coming back to my home country to work"")

But your logic still stands. This email, as well as watching the enrollment numbers, is a way for them to begin to test the waters and see how many people get spooked, and if they lose too much money, they will try something else. Because if they close campus or lose too many students, they stand to lose [hundreds](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-16/uc-reeling-under-staggering-coronavirus-costs-the-worst-impacts-all-at-once) of [millions](https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/fwrwjo/uc_berkeley_expects_100_million_loss_by_end_of_may/) of dollars."
berkeley,focj5ce,t1_fo836jz,1587671936.0,"Never assume you can't do anything. Anything worth doing will become hard, just maybe earlier, so don't let difficulty be ANY deterrent to choosing something to do. 

Because even if you *start* out with something that's easier for you, it will get harder *anyway* once you progress further. Like a video game, if the enemies are getting harder, then you are going in the right direction.

I'm super serious about this man, temper your expectations. Self-limitation is how career growth (and more importantly, human growth) dies in the cradle. I've seen it so many times in friends and it makes me sad because I factually know that these friends are brilliant and capable, but the challenge scares them before they take the first step towards something greater.

That aside - environmental studies seems pretty legit. What do you need to know in order to find out how to get into that field? Where can you get this information?

Once you know more about the possibilities in that field that seem like a good direction for you, what skills and knowledge do those people need? Do they need degrees? Certain classes? Do they need to network with certain people or professors?

Explore outwards first, then work backwards to goal-set to the present. This is how people end up justifying struggling through extremely difficult classes that they may not be good at in the beginning - because they know it directly connects to their future goal and it needs to be learned."
berkeley,focgztz,t3_g6qfs5,1587671227.0,"You can analogously consider E7 (and Matlab) the ""Microsoft Excel"" of the engineering world. In many courses, professors will toss labs and homework assignments at you that require you to basically type out a simple script to do a buncha data processing. 

ME132, however, goes ham on this because the control systems are implemented in Simulink, which connects to Matlab (both are Mathworks products) and frequently need to be used together (where you draw block diagrams in Simulink but use Matlab for almost everything else). It would be maybe similar to doing, say, physics courses with minimal calculus background, or writing a book with grade school level English. Could you teach yourself both the tools and the work you need to use the tools on? Yes, you could, but it would likely be difficult."
berkeley,fo5wnen,t3_g5usku,1587538132.0,"Key information missing here - what do you *want*? Additional emphasis - what do **you** want?

Having a larger overarching goal set slightly past college can help. When we talk about ""means to an end"", education (and a minor) should be the means, and some goal or desired outcome should be the end (aka journey, not the destination).

Otherwise, most of everyone here is gonna tell you to do a STEM minor, and that's because that's what *they* want, not what you want."
