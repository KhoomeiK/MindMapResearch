Anyways with the serious reason out of the day, I am going to assume you are a troll as I can see you in the replies edging us community members on into a debate which in the end will bring only you satisfaction. Anything we say will go into one ear and out the next for you so it's really not worth any of our times. You know what this subreddit is, if you like Lego so much go back to the Lego subreddit, it's not so hard. Don't intentionally stir up trouble/drama for no reason, it's not cool. Accept people's financial situations/priorities arent the same as yours. If you were here to start a polite, ethical debate, we would be more inclined, but the rude, condescending way you are replying makes you seem most definitely a troll.

&#x200B;

I think myself and everyone else already explained why this subreddit exists and sufficiently answered your question. If you are done here/not a troll, you should kindly leave this thread if not this whole subreddit. Otherwise, I am going to assume you are going to comment on my reply as well as others, which in that case, I would like you to politely \*\*\*\* out of here."

These day's, I just stick to Yugioh simulators like Edopro(ygopro) or Dueling Book where I have access to all the cards, and can spend my time doing some fun anime duels, make wacky decks that I wouldnt be able to buy IRL, playtesting some of my own competitive creations and playing against other players/ai through tournaments or normal duels. I still do the occasional Duel Links but I definitely spend less time on that, more on the original master duel style( 5 monster/5 S/T) of Yugioh.

My personal favorite moment in the article was reading  “I’m a big fan of Yu-Gi-Oh,” says UNCONKABLE . Yugioh is my favorite card game, and hearing someone from the Legends of Runeterra team mentioning is felt amazing. The initial trailer for Runeterra and all the Reddit posts and discussions focused on Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone, I didn't think they were ever being influenced/making something Yugioh inspired. I gave some feedback during an early LOR survey sent to my email about taking influence from Yugioh, and I am so glad they did in a way :)

Edit: Looking forward to more of these articles and other champion's design stories! Keep up the great work guys :D"
