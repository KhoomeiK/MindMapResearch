Fremont,fpaivv7,t3_gbzuxj,1588449097.0,"Being born and raised in Fremont and by the public school system, I know my life would not be the same without some of the amazing teachers I had throughout. 
A lot of my friends are starting to move back home this year and we will be voting in Fremont elections this fall. 
I know I would appreciate a teachers perspective on who the right people to vote for are and how we can start making democratic change.
Raises are not always possible, but one member getting a 10% raise while teachers get less than inflation is not right. 
Please let us know who you think the right people are so we can cast informed votes this fall!"
Fremont,fp8x9uh,t3_gbxst9,1588406230.0,"For those in the Mission Area, Las Palmas Taqueria on Mission Blvd is pretty good and just recently opened back up again on limited hours. Went there quite a bit growing up and was sad to hear they were operating at less than 20% of Business as usual. They have a good protective set up to prevent as much interaction as possible. Went there today, nothing more beyond the handing of a credit card. The cashier didn’t accept my cash tip to avoid touching any bills and stay clean and safe so I feel like sending some business their way is the best way I can return the favors."
