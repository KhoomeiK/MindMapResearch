UCSD,fogme8e,t3_g74t2u,1587754432.0,Heck no.
simcity4,fnpjndi,t1_fnoltsa,1587146660.0,Thanks for replying! I find those red building w/ green rooftops beautiful. What mod are you using for those?
UCSD,fnpjd65,t1_fnp2vx5,1587146515.0,Nope. Still have 2 more years to go
UCSD,fno5ojr,t3_g2vw1q,1587113022.0,I am still in SD but planning to go home by July (if I can actually get a ticket). But I don't think reentering US should be that much of an issue by the time we come back. tbh fall quarter is probably going to be online anyway...
UCSD,fno56hr,t1_fnnfkh2,1587112485.0,">Southwestern just stated they will be online for fall. UCSD is the size of a city so my guess is yes. They wont want bad press/be liable if there is a huge outbreak and without a vaccine there probably would be

Oh no ;("
simcity4,fno525o,t3_g2pxyx,1587112356.0,damn the city looks good. Mind if I ask what mods do you use?
UCSD,fne4ci9,t3_g16pu8,1586882833.0,I feel so attacked
UCSD,fnbpjf0,t1_fn9jckk,1586819798.0,"Hey, I read through it all (it’s long!). And thanks for replying - I am glad to hear some genuine voice from the other side of discussion. 

Yes, there are some people riding race cars/ wearing weird street brand jackets around. 

Still, xenophobic opinions against Chinese should NOT be justified because of those behaviors. 

And please understand that many Americans don’t personally know Chinese international students. So, promoting a stereotypical image of International students can be very MISLEADING to most Americans, especially in this unusual time of “China virus”. Doing so can only hurt those genuine, kind ones, who are majority of international students."
UCSD,fn8s7a7,t1_fn8qsq9,1586748886.0,"I understand that the “social boundary” between Chinese students and other students could be annoying. But hey, I believe most of us are not trying to be an jerk. We either just too shy to reach out/ not confident at our English. 

As for academic dishonesty, there is only a tiny fraction of international students who engaged in this kinda behavior. Among international student community, we despise academic dishonesty. Trust me, Most of us honor academic integrity just like you do. 

We shouldn’t generalize a population based on a small fraction’s wrongdoing. and it REALLY HURTS hearing those xenophobic talks."
UCSD,fn8qjgt,t3_fy0ggh,1586747678.0,Nice stuff
UCSD,fn8nbb3,t3_g03j9x,1586745603.0,"Chinese international student here. SO PROUD.
And why are there so many hate talks against us even when we are just trying to do something good?"
UCSD,fn8n5gx,t1_fn1b32e,1586745504.0,"Work hard and pick the right professor, then you will be fine. If you took physics + chemistry for high school, you can definitely make it through gen chem and intro phys."
UCSD,fmz4vtz,t3_fyaboo,1586506495.0,"I was on the exact same path as yours. (chemistry at first year, switched to Chem E at 2nd year)
And No it is not hard to switch to Chem E. As long as you finish the screening courses and get a gpa of 3.0 for them, you will have a good chance of getting in. One of the department advisor actually told me that they are trying to accept more students into the major, and they won’t give you a hard time if you meet the requirement!"
