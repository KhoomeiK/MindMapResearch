ApplyingToCollege,fpjg3s8,t3_gdta1g,1588667205.0,I got a 34 SAT and 3.8 GPA and got into Berkeley and UIUC and Purdue and waitlisted by umich.

ApplyingToCollege,fphc04g,t3_gdgtj4,1588618577.0,Please keep in mind the stress of declaring CS at Berkeley. If you wanna avoid that and also have access to varied resources go to CMU. Berkeley CS although top notch is just overcrowded.
ApplyingToCollege,fphbjfh,t1_fph80it,1588618344.0,Wait they extended it to May 8th? I don‚Äôt think so lol.

Applied to UCB, UCLA, UCI, UCSD, UCSB"
ApplyingToCollege,fpexak8,t3_gd20pq,1588556956.0,"Stick with UCB. It‚Äôs literally the one of the best in the country and if you put in the effort a 3.3 GPA in CS 61ab and CS 70 is achievable. U need a B+ or higher in each of these classes. Also UCB‚Äôs name goes a long way in helping you achieve connections to jobs. There is a lot of people who enter in with minimal coding experience. And in L&S, there is basically no engineeering classes but rather liberal arts classes to fulfill the req."

cscareerquestions,fp8sum8,t3_gbvs04,1588401855.0,"Both are reputed in CS although UIUC Is slightly better in CS, but UCSD has the location advantage. I would say if you are instate or closer to Cali go with UCSD. U can‚Äôt go wrong with either choice. Since u said u would choose UCSD for more personal reasons, I would say go for it and stick with your instincts because at the end of the day you can‚Äôt go wrong with each other choice. Both are highly reputed in CS."

ApplyingToCollege,fp0rigu,t3_gani0g,1588215318.0,No your def not a clown for this at all. At this point what ever choice you make is just plainly awesome . I would say at this point to choose a school you vibe more with and a place you can see yourself happy at and also achieve your educational endeavors as well. Cornell and CMU are both really prestigious in CS.
ApplyingToCollege,fp0iit0,t3_gai6bg,1588209957.0,Are u OOS for umich?
ApplyingToCollege,foz0g80,t1_foydcub,1588182534.0,"Yea all my friends are going to umich and instate tuition is essentially really good as well. But if u are OOS for both, cal is essentially the better school in terms of academic opportunities although both are really prestigious."
ApplyingToCollege,fox4tf4,t3_ga2luo,1588134085.0,This makes me feel really grateful to get into UC Berkeley but I feel your pain man I somehow managed to get into UC Berkeley OOS but get waitlisted umich in-state. I would def go to umich if I got off the waitlist. I wish you good luck bro and if I get off the umich waitlist I would withdraw from UC Berkeley for ya.
ApplyingToCollege,fox23nq,t3_g9tl4b,1588132253.0, Berkeley gave me a 20k merit scholarship as OOS student with mediocre stats. I am middle class.

ApplyingToCollege,fovtvma,t1_fovryr0,1588107437.0,"He never said he was oos for nyu . He only said oos for umich so it‚Äôs probably umich that is more expensive for OP. Although he said not to include cost as a factor, it‚Äôs still important to inform him of the possible reasonable option for his decisions."
ApplyingToCollege,fovqh4b,t3_g9ua4p,1588105762.0,"If you are OOS for umich, lsa Econ is def not worth it IMO cause NYU Econ and umich Econ are literally have the same prospects and I would definitely not go into so much debt for Econ degree at umich when you NYU Econ in your backyard."
