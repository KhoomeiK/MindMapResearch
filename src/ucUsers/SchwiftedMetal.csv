I’m sort of in a career transition, but I have to have a CS background to make it happen so I enrolled last yr. During my time learning these concepts, I’ve met a fair share of asshole gatekeepers. 

OP, stay strong and forget those guys. Smarts don’t mean a lick of shit when it comes to humanity or emotional intelligence. You gotta know you’re on a good path, and if in the end you learn everything on your own, you’ll be better off them most of the CS guys I know. Most of them cheat off chegg and shit."

I don’t yet know how those could be applied or the hurdles involved though. That’s why i wanted to do the math degree bc then I’ll better understand what a model aims to do, where its weak and strong, where its succeeded before, and where to pay attention in computational advancements."

I'm not defending this guy, but I'm also not going to condemn him for making amends nor make him the scapegoat for an entire massive industry. Is this an invasion of privacy? Maybe. Again, depends on how they use it. 

However, if he was using/accessing the info like Cambridge Analytica or he wasn't really sincere about his turn around, then I'd of course be singing a diff tune. And if that's the case, I would wholesale throw him under the bus."
