UCSC,fmxwzch,t3_flb0n2,1586473526.0,"Looking for 4 housemates for next year in a house about a 3-min walk to the base of campus, close to 5 bus stops. The 3bdrm 2.5br house is fully furnished and comes with a 1-car garage, all kitchen appliances, in-house washer and dryer, and access to a community pool. The first available room is a master bedroom (can fit 2) with a large walk-in closet and itâ€™s own bathroom. The other is a small double. Rent for the whole house is $4850 total, but we use splitwise to calculate the rent based on common spaces and the room sizes. The lease starts in June (first and last month is prorated by the landlord). DM me if you're interested."
GeneratorReviews,etckirm,t1_etcjrp1,1562686841.0,"Not considering a budget atm. Just looking for a good line of choices that could power most (if not all) of the house. 

I did a bit more research and it would probably have to be one that is about 70-100kw. There will be quite a few things that need to be powered, but some of them can be sacrificed during an outage."
