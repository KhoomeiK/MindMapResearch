ucla,fo8zsdz,t1_fo8zit5,1587607339.0,"bro i’ve been attending the calls, you aren’t going to convince me that Orion is any of the things you and the rest of USAC claim. I want someone that’s not afraid to call them out and sit there silently while they bash him over and over without a shred of professionalism."
ucla,fo8yr4z,t1_fo8yap3,1587606695.0,"Stealing money, huh? I consider it stealing to take the stipend and then request more fees because “trust us” while we launch personal attacks on a fellow representative. The rest of em are bullies, and purely on that I will vote for their enemy."

ucla,fo5vb4u,t3_g5uw64,1587536857.0,The fact that you are working to write a program parsing their convoluted data because they have no incentive to do it themselves directly contradicts their accusations
ucla,fo5v50c,t3_g5uw64,1587536696.0,"I was on the call when they suggested you don’t represent anyone. Fuck em, I’ll cast my first ever student vote for you.  I want a black student center too, but do we need fee increases during possibly the most economically insecure times of our lives WITHOUT A COMMUNICABLE BUDGET? The lack of professionalism in favor of personal attacks on you just makes me want to vote for you, and I hope they know that."
