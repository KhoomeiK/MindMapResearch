First, it’s based on Medicare alone and says, very basically, that it is because of the extra demand placed on the hospitals and doctors. It makes sure to point out that people across social media have taken this to mean that the number of cases have been falsified for financial gain when there is no evidence of that whatsoever. 

On a similar note, it also references how some cities/states are paid more than others just for being those cities/states. By this logic, are you also going to claim that these cities/states would make or falsely report its citizens being sick for the hospitals’ financial gain?

I think Elon Musk posted that knowing that most people wouldn’t read more than the headline, which only says what claim they are fact-checking, not what they found to be true.

nintendo,foklcam,t3_g7vuf0,1587844211.0,I typically don’t go outside much (introverted w/ some mental health problems) but for once in my life I am looking forward to just seeing people. Doesn’t even matter if they’re my friends or just strangers. I’d just like to say hi to someone new. This virus has really given me a new outlook on a lot of things

Didn’t even make it two months in before I completely ruined it (all I did was miss a monthly log page I believe) so now I can’t bring myself to use it again because it’s all messed up!

ucla,fo2pi12,t3_g5bcsd,1587470606.0,"My three biggest concerns are:
1. You clearly understand that many students are currently facing financial issues due to the pandemic, but still plan to ~attempt to~ charge us an extra $45 per year. Telling me “Hey, well it could’ve been an extra $81 per year!” doesn’t do me any good, now does it?
2. Why does 25% of my money benefit those receiving financial aid when I don’t receive any myself? I need that money to pay off my own student loans. And why do I have 6 figure student loan debt? Because I am paying for my education by myself and UCLA fails to acknowledge that or help me.
3. You make it seem like taking the $45 per student next year will magically solve all these issues. It likely won’t. It likely will take a long period of time to, yanno, build a building. Or generally transition to some other spot on campus that is available. None of this will benefit me or many of the other students in the coming years. Make that known."
unpopularopinion,fnrc33h,t1_fne0una,1587184621.0,"Bro I understand how you feel. From the looks of these comments, many other people don’t. I can’t say much about the whole religion thing for you, but I grew up in the redneck section of Pennsylvania (which is most of it actually lol) and lots of people ik are very VERY Catholic. Lots of my insecurities about being gay are still around today, even though I go to college in LA, where literally no one gives a fuck if you’re gay/trans/naked running down the street. They accept everything but it’s hard to get rid of those pesky insecurities from my past. So yeah sometimes you just want to wear a fucking rainbow without getting looks or being asked some shit. Doesn’t mean I’m any less proud of myself or the LGBT+ community though!"
mentalillness,fnqltz3,t3_g3ae1w,1587167208.0,"Okay bro, these other comments suck imo. Your life probably seems like dog shit (to you) rn. Yeah, some of it might be. Some of it might not be and may just be your head putting a shitty filter over all the good. Who fucking knows.

But if you were to do something to hurt or kill yourself, you’d be taking away all the good things you probably do like. Think of memes. Video games. Sex (even if not now, in the future). Food. These things are good. I’m sure you like these things a lot. Don’t take them away from yourself. 

Dying won’t make anything better no matter how much it feels like it will. Hey, it might even make someone else feel as shitty as you do rn. Yeah you may say nah it won’t, but parents/siblings/friends/pets yeah it might. Suicide can affect people you don’t even know (I got all suicidal bc of other teens doing it in my town. Did I know them? Nope. Did it affect me? Fuck yeah.)

If (and hopefully when) you get help, you’re going to HATE the people who help you. And imo that hate doesn’t really go away. But you’ll probably be happy you’re alive somewhere down the road. One day you’ll be sitting someplace looking at some super cliche thing like sun shining down through trees and think “hey, I’m glad I didn’t fuck everything up 2/5/15 years ago.”

The only real way to fuck up your life rn is to end it. Grades aren’t shit. They don’t matter for 99% of things. People’s opinions of you don’t mean shit. You won’t see half the people you know now 10 years down the road. You’ll also realize that most of them were jackasses (even some of your “friends”). 

All that really matters now is that you stay alive and keep on doing life and eating food and making memes and playing video games. Just enjoy the dumb things and tell your therapist how you’re feeling. That’s step one. It really can’t be worse than it is rn can it?

I hope you take some of this to heart and get some help no matter how shit it is. Pls stay alive no matter how shit it is. Bc one day it won’t be as shitty. Sending my love and support"

I was trying to mess with the fact that most white people don’t accept people of color and how this is actually kinda true but more on a cultural side of things.

Empaths,fncp7cn,t3_g0xj8j,1586842834.0,"I feel the same way. I find that I care way too much for other people. In high school, I would make or find very personal gifts that I knew my friends would love while they got me something from the dollar store... literally. Now that I’m almost out of college, I’ve finally found much better friends, but still not to the same level as me. It’s stinks. 

I got a 7 on the test and the whole time I was taking it I thought, “wow I’m such a narcissist.” Maybe it’s because my family tells me I am everyday? I take that to heart too much"
asl,fncmili,t3_g0w8ym,1586840626.0,"No!! You’re not appropriating the culture at all by learning it and utilizing it! I have taken ASL for 2 years now because I have a hearing disorder that messes with the connection between my ears and my brain. 

My ears are perfectly fine but they don’t always hear what they should be hearing (I’ll be listening to a fly two rooms away instead of my mom talking directly to me, making me miss everything she’s saying, a classroom of peers turns to a room of noise I can’t sort through, etc.) so it’s basically ADHD for my ears! 

My ASL professor is as Deaf as they come and he always says how he wishes more people would learn the language and use it because then he’d have more people to talk to and even because of how handy it can even be for hearing people! The only way you’d be appropriating it is if you begin to “take on” some of the aspects of it, like giving yourself a name sign which is something only a Deaf person can give to you. 

I suggest you learn more about Deaf culture (if you haven’t already) since you are learning the language, it’s super interesting and I actually prefer most of it to hearing culture! 
Whenever I have kids, I definitely plan on teaching them sign because it’s proven to help with brain growth and earlier communication! Happy signing and good luck! My cousins are autistic so I am so happy you’ve found a way to communicate that works for you!!"

Here’s a good article from a reliable source instead of a YouTube video from some guy in his apartment. You can’t tell what anyone in that video is feeling based off their expressions alone, it’s way too vague. Plus Biden is from a different generation, you have to remember that. You don’t exactly like it when your 70yo great aunt that you barely know kisses you, do you? But you tough it out bc they mean well. Most of these people Biden is being “overly sexual” with are people he knows quite well. And “overly sexual,” or “groping kids” as you put it, does not mean a kiss or having his hands on their shoulders. It means legitimately touching a child inappropriately in inappropriate areas. It means getting on a plane and having sex with minors/watching underage kids perform sex acts, (I.e. what Trump’s best friend Epstein was basically proven of doing, with Trump on the plane, circa 1997).

ucla,fmyxzhj,t1_fmxi57x,1586499337.0,"Bro, not to discount all your other points, but the school won’t give me financial aid bc I’m not poor enough to “need” it. And they say my parents can pay $96,000 per year when they’re not even paying shit towards my education and when that’s about double my moms yearly salary. That amount is like way more than it costs per year anyway (I’m out of state btw) making me go like ?? So I def have a problem with my money going towards other kids’ financial aid. That should be MY money going towards MY aid."
