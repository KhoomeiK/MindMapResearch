TheSilphRoad,fpaogaj,t3_gc855e,1588452384.0,"I mean, they released remote battling with ultra friends a year ago and all was dandy. Then suddenly they throw in a matchmaking system and everything goes wrong? Every update seemingly makes it worse..."

A Ghost Story, 
Good Time, Â The Florida Project, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, and Lady Bird all came out in 2017. Two of these are definitely in my top 5."

ucr,fokczyu,t3_g7oegp,1587839776.0,"I don't think anyone on this subreddit can accurately explain the inner workings of roommate choosing process for glen mor. Perhaps one was processed before the other, and there was no other way to make it work at that stage."
ucr,fokcqkj,t3_g7xkkj,1587839634.0,"I'd recommend Pentland. It can be social, really depends on who you know. They always have events for freshman too, just show up at a couple. Lothian can be a toss up, but a more traditional ""dorm"" experience"
ucr,fokck31,t3_g7yk3k,1587839537.0,What are you looking for? What is important to you? Private bathrooms? Cleanliness? How about age of the building? Food nearby?  Are you social? Etc.

Around campus there's always on campus police and such wandering around. Housing wise, Depends if you're looking for an on campus apartment or off campus, and what you would prioritize. Bannockburn is the closest to campus and pretty cheap. There are off campus options as well."

Letterboxd,fnawo6f,t3_g0a7yk,1586805141.0,"I've got this as well, if I go to my diary for 2020, it just says ""You've logged these entries for films in 2020"", instead of ""You've logged x entries for films in 2020"". Used to be able to find how many I've watched per calendar year, now it seems the only way to get that is to count each individually. Hope this is a temporary bug."

NianticWayfarer,fmln7oo,t3_fw1fgw,1586189659.0,Don't use upgrades. Upgrades make a nomination more likely to be rejected.
