**1) Hurtful Speech**

I’ve seen and heard so many hateful comments thrown around. I was just speechless when I first saw or heard them. Look, we are all UCLA students. We all come from different backgrounds and there is no need to resort to ad hominem attacks.

My approach for refutation comes from evidence-based argumentation. I find it extremely petty for people to argue against a person’s character because it means they have no legitimate opposition to the argument that was brought up. I think it is destructive to discourse and I think it has no place in USAC.

Let me clear, I’m not here to say that we should all hold hands and sing together because the job of USAC is not to agree completely on everything. Debating is what leads to a more productive solution and often one that is more optimized.

Let’s end the hurtful speech and smearing. Let’s be civil.

**2) Political Convenience**

Candidates running for office do not care about organizations that don’t endorse them. It’s likely that there are some that do; I believe that there are good people. But in the conversations that I have had with people from all over, it has become saddeningly clear to me that candidates often refuse to listen to organizations unless they are given an endorsement. I think that is terribly toxic to the community. From a political standpoint, that means that organizations are more inclined to endorse candidates, but those that don’t get involved in politics on a principled level cannot have their voices heard, ever. And so they just have to make do. Usually, the circumstances that they have to deal with are just downright terrible.

As representatives of the UCLA population, there is an inherent civic duty in all members of the council to listen and respect the views of all organizations on campus. They have the ability to bring a unique viewpoint to the table and I think important that even the political inactive organizations are given a shot to speak with USAC about their needs. And equivalently, have USAC listen and respond accordingly to support those communities.

Organizations have been reluctant to reach out since they don’t believe USAC can saliently help them with anything, that also has to change. Inactivity brings no good since it forces people to adapt to situations that are detrimental to their optimum university experience. Coming to the table lays the groundwork for further cooperation and is a good start to help organizations achieve the goals that they have. It should be a two-way street between USAC and the UCLA community.

I will concede that supporting every organization is difficult to do with limited resources, but I would say that the greatest power that members of the council have is the power of the office. Support, if non-exhaustive, but provided in key respects should allow UCLA to become better for all its students.

Note: I cannot determine the objective accuracy of my statements since they are based purely on my experience.

ucla,fpi6zp1,t1_fpfn2px,1588634919.0,"Hey u/NaughtyGiraffe8,

One of the biggest problems I want to tackle has to do with revising the USAC funding rubrics. Currently, those are heavily skewed towards organizations that do things relating to diversity and inclusion, but there is literally no way for student researchers or engineering teams to get that money without tokenizing issues or finding loopholes to try to make their projects seem like they support those principles. Projects that are purely for scientific curiosity have almost no chance.

I want to revise those general funding rubrics and utilize provide access to funds for STEM clubs and create cool things for the sake of science.

A lot of more this is outlined on my website in detail, which I encourage you to check out, but let me go over it briefly.

My BruinCast expansion and improvement plan seeks to get more professors using BruinCast. Professors retain the right to exercise whether or not their class is BruinCasted, but I plan to advocate directly to faculty and explain to them the many benefits of BruinCasting the lectures. For example, the instructors can use the video analytics from the video to better inform their teaching since they know what students are reviewing; it helps TAs to decide what to talk about in discussions as well. 

All in all, instructors teach better with BruinCast and that's what I aim to persuade them on. They will probably get better BruinWalk scores if not better end-of-quarter reviews which inform the administration about promotions and better positions for those lecturers.

This also means improving the actual BruinCast technology itself and investing in good audio and video quality. I want to be able to add a transcript and timestamps for easy review as well as video analytics for the instructors.

I hope this answers your question! Feel free to check out my full platform on my website or keep asking questions."
ucla,fntru9j,t1_fntn4hv,1587247484.0,"Hey u/PsychDeer,

As a clarification, my reason for abstaining would be that I believe that the referenda are justified on principled grounds as I outlined in a previous response. Saying no would have meant that I was against what the referenda were attempting to do, which is not the case. The abstention provides a nuanced response to the heated rhetoric that I'm sure you heard about at the USAC meeting.

Hope this helps!"
ucla,fnthsqx,t1_fnt3xco,1587241929.0,"Hey u/WrongedJello,

I have been debating and doing Model UN for about 8 years now. That gives me considerable experience in negotiation and public speaking. The good thing is that I have a lot of experience defending points on pretty much anything. This means that effectively I can accurately advocate for the students' opinions unflinchingly. I just posted on Facebook about my Model UN and debate career so feel free to take a look at that.

I'll definitely look into power washing the Bruin Statue and trying to get Joe Bruin a little cleaner for all of us.

I hope that answers your question!"
ucla,fnt34x8,t1_fnt22ki,1587233707.0,"Yeah, you are correct. I like to think that they worked really hard on their proposals and so I give them leniency out of niceness. After all, I have to retain my Canadian values."
ucla,fnt1u5a,t1_fnszypy,1587232996.0,"Hey u/FrustratedBruin909,

I would have abstained. Like I said in the previous comment. The referenda in principle are good, it's just that these fee increases have come at a terrible time. I don't think now is the time to be pushing for students to pay more. Instead, if USAC really wants to put these into action for this upcoming year, they can use their surplus to fund the programs for at least this next year and look into fee increases later down the road, if truly required.

I hope this answers your question!"
ucla,fnt1bng,t1_fnsygqw,1587232722.0,"Hey u/westlasav,

On Individual Referenda:

CUB - In principle, legitimately beneficial. Providing marginalized communities with resources is definitely a good idea. The good thing is that the funds here are managed by ASUCLA which means that even if the idea is shaky from a USAC perspective, I do trust ASUCLA to make better use of it.

GCGP - Pretty solid in terms of their goal. They understand their impact and know what they want to do with the money that they are given. 

Both, in theory, are contributing to a better UCLA.

In reality, it's never a good time to raise fees; no one really likes paying more money especially if they're already shelling out thousands of dollars for out-of-state tuition.

And right now, in this time of crisis its definitely not the smartest idea to be raising fees. People are worried about their families and for some people paying more money can be devastating.

It is important to remember that when these referenda were put onto the ballot they didn't expect to be in this situation. And so, I prefer to provide them with some leniency on that matter.

I've read a lot of the budgetary documents for USAC and they highlight clearly a definitive money mismanagement problem. I don't see any problem with reallocating that money towards these referenda; a lot of their expenses are one-time things. For the ongoing expenses, I imagine that reducing the USAC surplus from like the 6 million or so now would be totally fine because USAC has that money.

I hope this answers your question!"
