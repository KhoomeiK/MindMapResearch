FortniteCompetitive,fpj0osc,t1_fpizkoe,1588653411.0,"Assuming you mean for elo outside of the tournament to affect points in tournaments, this is a terrible idea cause it would handicap pros and just give bad players a big boost. Giving more points based on existing point differentials from the tournament is ok, but would still let people with zero points rocket up by starting late since having zero points and killing people with some points would make them gain points even faster. This elo system would be best implemented in Arena."
FortniteCompetitive,fpj08t4,t3_gdj6mh,1588653077.0,"At the very least keep it to the future cash cup format where kills will be 2 points and then double it for this surge times. No one has an issue for the way the current format handles placement, just that kills are worth too much."
FortniteCompetitive,fpizy4u,t3_gdlj1b,1588652854.0,Some people have mentioned that if a controller player uses a mouse to hit the ready up button it will mark them as a kbm player on fortnite tracker. That may have thrown off your stats but idk if you accounted for that.
FortniteCompetitive,fpizbhv,t3_gdmeul,1588652389.0,How about if you don't enter queue in the first thirty minutes and then after that ready up every ten minutes it stops you from being able to queue up again.

FortniteCompetitive,fp8rjnb,t1_fp8r882,1588400639.0,"The problem remains that the aim assist now pulls like it does on console, but on pc there's no input delay, visibility is way better, higher refresh rates, etc which already makes natural aiming way easier. So players on these high frames shouldn't need the same pull as console to aim well, since there aren't nearly as many other hardware issues holding them back."
FortniteCompetitive,fp5e29k,t1_fp4bxk5,1588325902.0,"I like this, they recognized that it’s easier to get elims in team modes as can be seen with elim points in arena, while I think a kill should be like 14 points in duo arena rather than a perfect half, decreasing points per elim in tournaments should definitely happen"
FortniteCompetitive,fp5dtey,t1_fp53pkl,1588325635.0,Storm surge is placed at already worst case scenario points. They could lower points and also lower storm surge player thresholds but that results but then instead of people fighting cause points are OP there will be a lot of desperate people wkeying cause they’re dead if they don’t.
FortniteCompetitive,fp5dano,t1_fp53zi7,1588325079.0,Was this naw? My friend noticed the people who placed first in opens had like a hundred wins in ten thousand games and had never played any comp events before.
ShitFortNiteBRSays,fp5crrf,t1_fp56fc3,1588324513.0,"Mate you have to realize that aim assist ON PC is a problem. Can mouse and keyboard beam? Yes, if they’re both lucky and really good. But the majority of the time, controller is correct. Regardless, while I understand finding it annoying that all these pros call controller, the real point of your title is that you thought competitive ruined the game and that it “doesn’t look fun” to you. Those guys are competitive; they may get frustrated deeply by directions the game chooses to take but deep down they are fundamentally motivated to be the best, and they enjoy trying. Just because what they’re doing doesn’t seem fun to you doesn’t mean they aren’t having fun. Competitive didnt ruin the game, it provided a group of players another way to enjoy the game, and who are you to say your way of enjoying the game is better than theirs? It’s not like there’s some moral highground here. I can also point out the number of times bad players die to someone and immediately call out “fing sweat you’re so trash” when it’s just another player trying their best. Both sides needlessly throw stones and you aren’t helping the situation."

A good compromise would be to make pumps do 75 damage while the tac does 50, which I think was your idea."

FortniteCompetitive,fnl7fny,t1_fnks0wu,1587048442.0,"Like we said in the video, we call out Tfue because at that point our team had been tangling with him at grotto for a while and every time we ran into them, whether we killed them or we didn’t, a massive wave of negativity came directed at our players. Do you want to stream to 100 viewers if 80 of them are telling you that you’re pathetic and a terrible person - just because you played the game as well as you could? We stand with our players when it comes to such mass harassment, no matter who sends it."

FortniteCompetitive,fnl6ffi,t1_fnkoyt1,1587047896.0,Our players shouldn't have to stop streaming just because of an internet bully. That would be letting him win.
FortniteCompetitive,fnl69ge,t1_fnl2tg1,1587047805.0,"We aren’t trying to win any argument here, there will still be people who have it spelled out in front of them and call us stream snipers and clout chasers. We’re here just to clear our name with the people who want to see both sides of the argument, and then we’re going back to doing our business as usual."
FortniteCompetitive,fnl630y,t1_fnkogsx,1587047708.0,They have changed their drop for heats now that they have time to learn a new drop. Changing drop spots to a spot they haven’t practiced mid tournament is just as bad if not worse than sticking to what they know.
FortniteCompetitive,fnl5yag,t1_fnkrlxm,1587047634.0,"There is a massive difference between stream sniping with intention to gain relevant and up to date info and accidentally leaking live information that our coach was under the impression was on a delay but was barely relevant to play. If you listen to the audio, from the position of the players it sounds like he’s saying people are still in grotto, but Thresh died on the mountains outside of grotto, closer to retail. Of course we don’t want it to happen, but it was accidental and wouldn’t warrant the removal of the coach, and especially not of the players, since it wasn’t their fault, but rather our coaches. That’s why we clearly state that we don’t allow any coaches to be in a call with our players while they play a competitive event in the future, to prevent things like this happening again."
FortniteCompetitive,fnklxie,t1_fnklu4a,1587032115.0,"They wait in storm in order to force the other teams to stop camping the vault, in hopes that they can open the vault and get the good loot plus bandage guns for free. That is just a strategy, and is neither good nor bad sportsmanship. They are allowed to use any legal strategy, however unconventional."
FortniteCompetitive,fnkjvih,t1_fnkcfbf,1587029841.0,"They got beat fair and square, but took it in good sportsmanship. We all shared a good laugh over Aiden being pickaxed by Scoped, the clip can be found on scoped’s Instagram."
FortniteCompetitive,fnkjgyp,t1_fnkj1an,1587029389.0,"1. We’re in the process of getting the botted followers removed. If we grow, we do it right; plus why would we risk a ban by breaking TOS?
2. We don’t claim we were in the right in the ghosting allegation, but that it was a mistake that we take responsibility for and have created countermeasures to remove the possibility of future occurrences.
3. Their strategy was to take the keycard and run to avoid early game conflict, come back when grotto is in zone so that zone would force vault campers out, and then get access to the vault where the numerous henchmen chests and the supply vault guaranteed strong loot and bandage guns to get them out of zone safely. This was a perfectly fair strategy, albeit unconventional. It was not designed to make the games worse for any specific players, but to avoid fighting players contesting them while still guaranteeing vault loot. Did it work? No. But we tried.
4. We stayed in Grotto because it’s the only place our players have ever practiced dropping and changing to a brand new drop mid tournament was not a good move either. They had already qualified for heats regardless and this was their first time qualifying for finals, so this was just a trial by fire that went south.
5. The segment about TTV in Turner’s name was not to “respect the hustle” in terms of clout farming, but specifically defending putting TTV in usernames in order to grow channels through placing well on leaderboards. He attacked us for that on numerous occasions, and still calls our players “the TTV kids” when he refers to them."

FortniteCompetitive,fnkajvn,t1_fnka2bq,1587020127.0,"The “literal footage of our players ghosting” was explained, and shown, in the response; the ghosting was not the fault of the players, but a mistake on the part of the coach in the call with them, who we no longer allow to be in a call for them in any competitive events to prevent future incidents like that occurring."
FortniteCompetitive,fnk9gld,t1_fnk8ekb,1587019114.0,"People were accusing us of stream-sniping on all platforms, especially in the streams of our players. So addressing that was definitely necessary. Most of Turner's response was just calling us names so there wasn't much to address on that end. As to his argument that we shouldn't land there if we kept getting killed off spawn, it was Oops and Aiden's first time making it to finals and they were scoping out the competition, having already qualified for heats. But we aren't trying to extend the argument, we just want to end it here and make clear that we stand by our players and their competitive integrity."

FortniteCompetitive,fnbs9a9,t1_fnbmykc,1586821305.0,"I’m in college man. I’m not leaving UCLA to go into industry off the bat. My point was never that I’m more qualified than epic’s devs and engineers, my point was that I’m familiar enough with programming and various aspects of game development to understand how much work different things take. Straight up improving the servers? Very difficult. Creating servers that don’t drop off performance for tournaments? More doable. Disabling mythic weapons and henchmen in tournaments? Insanely easy, changing numbers in a database. Epic can and should, at the very least, do the easy/doable things, but they don’t because they don’t want to. That’s not on the programmers, that’s on marketing. Even if I was the greatest engineer in the world and could straight up improve the servers, epic still wouldn’t let me disable mythics and henchmen because it isn’t my decision."
FortniteCompetitive,fnbea6i,t3_g0nhyq,1586813994.0,"As a final comment on top of everything I’ve already said in this thread, assuming Aiden had just been told that Tfue was no longer in the grotto, why doesn’t he immediately push the vault?

THE GAME IS NOT FIXED BECAUSE THEY DON’T WANT IT TO BE FIXED. The programmers don’t make the decisions, the higher ups do. It’s the higher ups that refuse to separate lootpools, it’s the higher ups that want mythics in comp, it’s the higher ups that don’t make custom servers that don’t deteriorate in processing power as games go on to optimize for tournaments. These are all things that, while I could theoretically do, epics devs could do way easier than I could; but they don’t make the decisions. They’re just told what to do. So again, stop acting uppity."

The programmers don’t make the decisions, they execute on them. Unless Epic decides to hire a college freshmen as a senior game design consultant, I can’t do anything."

FortniteCompetitive,fnb5nld,t1_fnalyim,1586809645.0,"I’m on Starving Hustlers, I’ll speak for him. Listen to the clip; “Thresh pushed into the grotto and died again” which sounds bad yes, but when Aiden is surprised cause it seems like relevant info, Bloom, the other guy in the call, says “Nah, it was a while ago”. It sounds like he was saying that they aren’t still in the vault, but he was trying to say “nah I don’t know what I told you was from a while ago”. And it was, Thresh pushed grotto early game and died and this clip was taken way later. Regardless, a no exceptions future rule of no open streams at all by anyone in the call until Oops and Aiden either die or win, and close them all once the next game starts, no matter how harmless the info given might be thought to be. As a closing note, game one oops and Aiden due to Chap and Av at grotto deep in zone after coming back to reboot and open the vault. They would not have rebooted if they knew Chap was still there (he was literally on his way to wind tunnel when he heard the reboot go off), and Chap was steaming with no stream delay. Obviously not stream sniping."

So yes, I know what I'm talking about. And no, the competitive subreddit didn't ask for more items. The main sub did. We want some changes to the meta occasionally, sure, but the removal of traps and the removal of snipers are two changes that don't break competitive while still shaking up the meta, whereas putting in mythic weapons absolutely breaks the meta."

We ask for good server performance and separate lootpools between competitive and casual modes. While the better performance certainly is a technical undertaking, large strides can already be made by them removing henchmen and minibosses from competitive modes (they were removed from Team Rumble for causing frame lag). The separation of lootpools literally comes down to the push of a hotfix, which is changing a few numbers in a table. I could do it myself in half an hour if given access to game files.
