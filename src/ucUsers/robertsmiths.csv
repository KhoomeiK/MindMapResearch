AskReddit,fpm15sa,t3_ge14vo,1588723447.0,"Be a musical legend, apparently. Sweet!"
AskWomen,fplpwtg,t3_ge1tsm,1588717222.0,"I met a friend-of-a-friend during my last year of college and fell pretty hard for him. He had a girlfriend when we first met, but they broke up soon after. My roommates and I were throwing a party and I had resolved to make a move that night, but literally seconds before I was going to talk to him, one of my roommates started hitting on him. Worst timing ever. They spent the whole night crawling all over each other and were seeing each other for the next few weeks. I hated having to watch her leave to go to his place everyday and not being able to say anything. It didn’t work out between them, but out of respect for my roommate, I never pursued the guy. Luckily we all stayed friends. He and I finally ended up having a drunken conversation about our feelings and almost making out one night, but I turned him down because of my roommate and because at that point it was so late in the year I didn’t want to get into anything. Turns out I dodged a bullet. We’re still friends, but the romantic feelings are gone."

newwave,fpf5u5i,t3_gd1dkr,1588562500.0,So good!
TheKillers,fpa4rtb,t3_gc35zy,1588440798.0,1 pretty much sums up my quarantine so far
UCSantaBarbara,fp8uvz8,t3_gbz3rm,1588403798.0,Just goes on your transcript
UCSantaBarbara,fp8uu3i,t3_gbwoq8,1588403746.0,Ordered! This is so cool.
StudentLoans,fp3aglj,t1_foxer5c,1588275909.0,Thanks! The second option sounds pretty good. I’m going to reach out to the school and confirm.
StudentLoans,fp3aagu,t1_fowit97,1588275822.0,"Thanks, I’m going to ask the school today. I do have a bit of savings that should cover books and some other costs."
femalefashionadvice,fosyvv6,t3_g9blc1,1588040959.0,"I wore uniforms for 2 years (1 in US, 1 in UK) and *hated* them. They were insanely ugly, itchy, and boring. Above all, I hated not being able to choose my own outfits. Compared to the schools I attended that didn’t have uniforms, uniforms didn’t do anything to stop bullying, either. Kids just judged each other based on their general attractiveness or personality instead."
ProlificAc,fosrp49,t1_forplvf,1588036661.0,I think they mean that studies that already received the waiver but are still in development will be published soon.
AskWomen,forwt9g,t3_g92qhz,1588019893.0,Brad Pitt. Everyone says he’s attractive but I just don’t see it. Not even when he was younger.
ProlificAc,forfpzf,t1_forfd1q,1588011454.0,"Sorry, I messed up — it’s *after* the 4th one, not on the 4th one."
ProlificAc,for9zwk,t3_g8zlql,1588008695.0,"Once you unlock instant cash out (after your 3rd cash out), you can cash out once every 24 hours. Otherwise you can’t cash out while a payment is still pending."
AskWomen,foplbpb,t3_g8sajn,1587964569.0,"I try to view it as a learning experience. With every relationship/fling/date that doesn’t work out, I become a little more aware of exactly what I do and don’t want. It’s hard, but hopefully it’s bringing me closer to the right person for me."
LetsTalkMusic,fonreht,t3_g8ehbd,1587924988.0,"There’s a new wave band called Play that only released a few songs back in the 80s. They’re so obscure that there’s hardly any info about them online. It’s pretty sad because they’re actually quite good. I think they had a lot of potential, but sadly they’re kind of lost to history. Here’s their song “[Red Movies](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GMzLW6fCD0w)”."

lawschooladmissions,fohnrkp,t3_g7ggav,1587769141.0,I'm just trying to distract myself as much as possible because it's too sad to think about.
LawSchool,fo9kmkd,t3_g6bfbq,1587622286.0,Thanks so much for this!
OldSchoolCool,fo9k79h,t3_g692b5,1587621924.0,God they’re gorgeous.
womensfashion,fo8suss,t3_g60rvl,1587603129.0,I wouldn’t do it. I think it comes across as trashy and immature.
womensfashion,fnbnf2n,t3_g0nk59,1586818653.0,I’ve found a lot of cute dresses on ASOS! They have a huge selection.
exmormon,fn8jjjb,t3_g03gsg,1586743095.0,Well “McFucking” is my new favorite word now. Hang in there!
femalefashionadvice,fmk6mqs,t3_fvp33d,1586145890.0,"I love your style! I’m kind of still working on mine, but it’s pretty similar. I tend to look for clothes with my preferred color palette — lots of black and grey with some pops of red, yellow, dark green, etc. I also have a lot of clothes that can be worn in different ways, like overall dresses that I can wear different shirts underneath."
