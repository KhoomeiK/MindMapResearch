UCSD,fnc4alv,t1_fnbre61,1586828315.0,"I personally think the number that get the vaccine will be slightly higher than those that get the yearly flu vaccine. So, a population that normally trusts vaccines + a population that is scared and knows that they/their family are at risk and that this is their best option. 

I simply mentioned that the anti-vaccine crowd is *relatively* small."
UCSD,fnbqugk,t1_fnbjnih,1586820516.0,I personally am not putting as much weight into the vaccine as you are. I consider the feat like trying to find one vaccine for the common cold.
UCSD,fnbqjow,t1_fnbfs0u,1586820350.0,Nice thanks!
UCSD,fnb3pgc,t1_fnb14o2,1586808672.0,Fall quarter not next quarter. I'm alright with summer being online. Fall quarter online would be unwarranted.
UCSD,fnavn4o,t3_g0l8gl,1586804618.0,Got it.
UCSD,fnascsj,t1_fnape68,1586802970.0,"Consideration of safety in students should be around mental health. Before all of this students were frequently on here talking about wanting to die and etc and now with all of this that is going on? People will snap for sure and I'm sure it's already happened for many. Then when they need help, they have to visit their therapists through a computer screen. I guarantee there are students out there that are not safe in regards to mental health."
UCSD,fnarxg8,t1_fnaq7j7,1586802753.0,"Sources about the fact that this will greatly affect the mental health of many individuals? Or about our human need for interaction? There's plenty of evidence out there about both, but tell me what you're looking for."
UCSD,fnar6yu,t1_fnaqdz3,1586802386.0,Yeah but I just noticed you'd be like 2nd on the waiting list if you chose Pecore. I'm in Lindenberger but both are really cool - check RMPs.

UCSD,fnaow3f,t1_fnamqbn,1586801234.0,Wait what - where do you park your car? In a random parking lot? Side of the road?
UCSD,fnanjcz,t1_fn97xk0,1586800563.0,"Same. Mental health is important as well - people keep forgetting about this. A third quarter of online will ruin the mental health of *many.* The impact of isolation on the mind could be just as destructive or more as the impact of acquisition of the virus. This is especially so in young people who won't experience this virus critically.

Humans are not meant to be alone, immobile and away from the sun for too long. Mental health has always been placed on the back burner. Smh."
UCSD,fnam9et,t1_fnacvse,1586799940.0,"And MTS is clear on the way home as well? From what I hear, the lines are way too long and people often have to watch it fill and leave a couple times before being able to get on themselves.

I personally live about 15 minutes from the school and would have to take three buses + walk a little between each if I wanted to get to school by bus. So it also depends where OP is planning to live."
UCSD,fn9p6mt,t1_fn7uhqb,1586780848.0,"No, MTS takes people too long because of the line. Regents + shuttle is the best bet as a commuter."
UCSD,fn9knf8,t1_fn9gv3q,1586776594.0,"Yes, we need testing. My quote above from earlier, ""Dr. Fauci was talking about creating serum tests to determine who has immunity and who can go back to work and school"". I never disagreed with this; I wrote this before you commented in here. So what is the point you are trying to make? 

 Why do you believe the casualty rate will increase if there is no immunity to this? 5 months from now without immunity is no different from present day without immunity + a flattening curve.

It is quite uncommon for a virus not to lead to the production of antibodies in the human body. If it mutated quickly enough, then yes, we could be reinfected by the new strain. However, this virus has some proofreading ability and is not mutating as quickly as many other RNA viruses."
UCSD,fn9jovw,t1_fn9gdm5,1586775587.0,"What. No you said ""as long as we contain this one as well"" in future, not past, terms. You argued that this won't come back because SARS-COV-1 did not.  

However, that infected 8 thousand individuals. This SARS-COV-2 has infected around 2 million (numbers are off because of testing). We are way beyond containing it. At any point through this next year, people somewhere will have it."
UCSD,fn9g15s,t1_fn9f9mh,1586771557.0,"To your first comment, look above at what I wrote 3 hours ago. I never said we don't need testing; I actually said it is the one thing that would allow us to live like they are in S. Korea - without a lockdown. You simply digressed from the conversation you began. 

The casualty rate will not go higher if the rate of spread is flattening. Those dying today are those that acquired the illness weeks ago. So no, the rate of death will not increase with a flattening curve."
UCSD,fn9dz4x,t1_fn954qc,1586769266.0,"I'll sleep better yeah thanks. 

Meanwhile, good luck with your useless endeavor to get rid of this donated PPE."
UCSD,fn9dd5n,t1_fn9cuyo,1586768586.0,"What does this have to do with my comment? The curve appears to be flattening regardless of lack of an approved treatment. The goal is to have this somewhat under control because there is no way this will be entirely eradicated anytime soon. If we can make tests widely available, we can keep this under better control. Also, hopefully we will provide better support to our hospitals in the coming months so that they are not overrun. 



Even with a vaccine, it will come back year after year."
UCSD,fn9awl3,t1_fn98h4a,1586765819.0,Experts are looking at the data though and saying the curve is flattening. Also remember that initially we had no tests and suddenly there was an increase in tests provided (though still not enough). This would look like a sudden eruption of cases
UCSD,fn9aq52,t1_fn9a2hu,1586765616.0,SARS-COV-1 only infected 8k people. This has spread much more than that! We cannot contain this like we did that
UCSD,fn97ry4,t1_fn96yqu,1586762437.0,There will probably be a second wave no matter what we do - even if we had a vaccine. Most think this will be a yearly thing now that it has reached all corners of the world.
UCSD,fn96vxt,t3_g0ddl3,1586761523.0,Does the bedroom count?
UCSD,fn96fqn,t1_fn95lr5,1586761065.0,"A couple things: No, the anti-vaccine crowd is too small to have any great affect. People are more afraid of COVID-19 right now than they are of vaccines. Vaccines are not a requirement to have life outside of lockdown. I mentioned the fact that South Korea has not gone into lockdown. And this COVID-19 will come back every year just like the flu. Don't place too much hope into a vaccine. 

Dr. Fauci has been talking about the possibility of us easing back to our daily lives in a couple months. And know that the vaccine will take more than just a couple months."
UCSD,fn95e7k,t3_g0ddny,1586760008.0,"I think it will be.

Dr. Fauci was talking about creating serum tests to determine who has immunity and who can go back to work and school. Also, many scientists, particularly in California, are saying that we're flattening the curve and getting a handle on this. If we can develop far more tests, then we can live like they are in South Korea. South Korea never went into lockdown and managed to get control because of their testing capacity."
UCSD,fn957c0,t1_fn953b2,1586759822.0,"In the English language, we place a period after a complete sentence."
UCSD,fn94uko,t1_fn94p3u,1586759474.0,It seems you have lost the argument.
UCSD,fn94s68,t1_fn94jag,1586759409.0,"""Those that struggle with the language----""? Do you care to finish that sentence? 

You're ignorant if you believe that we have the capacity to provide multiple tests to any one individual."
UCSD,fn94mks,t1_fn949gl,1586759251.0,"Actually *read* the articles that you are posting. 

You have provided little material here in this list. Again, on what are they basing the claim that these masks are inefficient? These sources that you have provided are essentially the same article, rewritten.

Think before you comment. Thanks."
UCSD,fn94btw,t1_fn93ln5,1586758958.0,"It may be unintelligible to those that struggle with the language.

You have provided no proof yourself that these donations will do more harm than good. Surgical masks have no filter. A filter that someone elsewhere has prematurely considered to be insufficient is better than none at all.

""70% accuracy"" was from the physician that provided me the test here at UCSD Health. Do you require a physician name?"
UCSD,fn943nn,t1_fn92rax,1586758746.0,What evidence? What the hell are you on about? You've provided no evidence that these donations are inefficient. Quit throwing insults while you sound like an outright fool.
UCSD,fn93wxi,t1_fn83nn1,1586758568.0,Nice thanks. There have been 6 lectures so far right? Not seeing 6 on canvas.
UCSD,fn91d0m,t1_fn8x6oh,1586756241.0,"How is it crazy? These are *donations*. They are *better than nothing*. What exactly was said about the masks other than they didn't fit well (cloth masks also don't fit snug) and their filter wasn't great? Those few produced in the US also aren't a guarantee filter against viruses..Did they hold a study about the efficiency of these Chinese masks? Or are they merely commenting upon first glance at the mask? Their critiques are not supported.

 The main issue discussed in that article was with testing kits. The US has not produced an accurate testing kit either - many being only 70% accurate.

Having something over your face, over your eyes, over your mouth, over your ordinary clothes is best. Re-using masks is bound to get our physicians sick - the mask becomes moist and attracts a lot of pathogens after prolonged use. The mask + face shield + body suit is actually excellent PPE...far better than the surgical masks!"
UCSD,fn8xlwy,t1_fn8dc37,1586753032.0,Proof of what? That the supplies they are sending are more protective? A garbage bag and layer of cloth is adequately protective against viruses in what world?
UCSD,fn8x829,t1_fn837kv,1586752719.0,Fuck yeah. Tell them you love em.
UCSD,fn84st9,t1_fn82kod,1586733903.0,You mean pads?
UCSD,fn81s98,t1_fn7rcqv,1586732108.0,Faulty? Far better than the trash bags and homemade cloth masks that our health workers have been using here in the US!
UCSD,fn819sq,t3_g02a75,1586731809.0,"I park in the regents lot with a D permit and this usually has spaces. I take the shuttle in.

It definitely works, but you just have to keep in mind that once arriving to the lot, you often have to wait 10 minutes before the shuttle will leave."

UCSD,fn5wlb8,t3_fzqi0x,1586678465.0,"Very few black people here and I sometimes feel like I'm not given a chance. I have to prove myself more than others. It's not something I can't get past though. It's not necessarily that you will be outcast but it depends somewhat on your culture. There's no black culture. If you had a lot of asian and hispanic friends before then you should be able to find friends here. But then overall, know that our school is not known for being social in general. You should share what other school(s) you're considering so I can say if it would be worth skipping those for UCSD."

UCSD,fmuz8y2,t1_fmux41s,1586402253.0,"They shut it down because it was an incoming force. After 6 months, our position will be quite different. Again - a significant number of individuals would have had it already, which decreases rate of spread. Hot summer months will have slowed down it's spread. And by then, our governments will begin to expect that people return to some degree of normalcy. They will not have work and schools on complete lockdown for an entire year. Many students in the nation are in fact homeless at this very moment because they were kicked out. Many of these are without wifi so must quit school until the lockdown is lifted. The longer they sit in this state of homelessness and financial insecurity, the more likely they are to remain in this state long term. Students and professors are struggling with online classes. Some professors are giving up on this online method and aren't uploading lectures or emails as they should be. Students are complaining about coursework and difficulty of staying ahead. 

Once a virus becomes a part of the normal repertoire of illnesses, society chooses to continue on living with it. So again, I believe that certain restrictions will remain in place but that the lockdown will be lifted and that people will be asked to go back to work and school. Not this quarter. Fall quarter.

And lastly, nobody is saying that elderly professors cannot retire."

UCSD,fmu1gmi,t1_fmtldyg,1586382803.0,A vaccine will not be here anytime soon though and even a vaccine wouldn't actually eliminate the virus. Some change will definitely be made by then by the government and/or by the school. I believe that what we our doing right now will not continue into the next spring...It may be that people are asked to return to daily life with certain restrictions in place.

UCSD,fmrvs0m,t3_fwtowd,1586337269.0,"I feel like classes will be in person for fall. I think by then the virus will have come under some control because the peak will have been in spring and a number of people will be immune by fall. The hotter months will cause this to spread less rapidly. Though it could come back in full force when the temperature cools for winter.

Also because professors are so put off by it in person classes might come back around. The university is likely to listen to the unhappy professors."
