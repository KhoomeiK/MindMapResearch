I go to a pretty good college and so many of the best and award-winning TAs I've had told me they wanted to go teach at lesser-known schools after they get their PhD instead of staying at my school. Why? Because they care more about a good learning environment.

So I agree that a lot of priorities are getting mixed up from the college side. But at the same time, I think part of the issue is on the student who goes to college only to learn. College is not somewhere that you learn. It's somewhere that you go to gain experience through personal research, work experience, etc that you would have an extremely hard time finding anywhere else. That's where its speciality is at, especially since you can learn a bunch of stuff now online through YouTube and whatever."

Also if you're near a decent university or have some friends or family that are doctors or scientists, those also can help because they're more credible and possibly more able to be accepted (people don't trust doctors that they don't know, but they tend to trust doctors that they personally know).

Maybe you can also try to understand where your friend's coming from. Learn a thing or two (hopefully that won't make you antivax). You can always reverse roleplay. You're the antivaxxer and your friend is pro-vax.

We're able to take mice and manipulate certain instinctual memories such as fear in certain conditions and craving for a few days later. Yes, this is extremely limited with a small time window, but that's because we've literally only started developing tools that can detect specific neurons just 20 years ago. So there's still a long way to go."
neuroscience,fotkr79,t1_forv9pr,1588056987.0,"More like dendritic connections. Think of it kind of like a wave. The water itself isn't moving much but the interaction changes.

On a micro scale, basically what happens is when multiple inputs go into a neuron at the same time, the neuron through the mechanism I said is able to strengthen these connections. So if the same thing keeps happening (like you keep practicing something) then the connection becomes really strong and it can become what you call a memory. And this is basically refined through any time the same input pattern goes into your brain (being there, doing something, thinking about it). One professor made up this pretty good phrase ""neurons that fire together wire together.""

You would think that not activating these neurons (aka not practicing) would cause you to lose memory the fastest. But it's actually doing something similar but wrong that makes you forget the fastest. What it does is cause adjacent neurons to fire and the target one to deactivate. With these situations basically happening billions and trillions if times over, it would make sense that your ""memories"" would slowly move around the brain because different neurons are being reassigned your memory.

This is why things like lie detectors don't work. It's not so much that they're not accurate enough yet, but because memory is generally unreliable at going into details. You're gonna end up taking bits of a different memory (probably sharing similar neuron clusters) and mashing it with the memory you're trying to recall.

But one last thing. In a petri dish, its been shown that baby neurons can physically move around. https://youtu.be/hb7tjqhfDus. So lots of stuff to still study."

Engrams are essentially stored everywhere in the brain. Don't think of them as localized to a particular region in the brain. Think of them as a cluster of neurons that are in a general vicinity within each other that happen to turn on at the same time and that move around the brain over time as you consolidate your memory.

So far for most engrams besides the ones in the cerebellum, we're only able to see them under really specific circumstances because they keep moving around. However, their properties are usually localized within regions of the brain that you've probably learned of. For example, fear could be thought of as needing a place in the brain to identify the situation when to be fearful. This is in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus). Then there's the place where you remember how to respond to fear, which is in the amygdala.

For what makes an engram, there's the more famous Richard Semon classification of the engram which is ""the enduring though primarily latent modification in the irritable substance produced by a stimulus (from an experience)."" Basically anything that fits the definition of ""you do something and your brain does something to store information for some amount of time that can be retrieved in a specific circumstances."" So any stimulus can form an engram.

But if you're looking at the cellularr properties, recent research into long-term memory engrams have identified this cycling of c-Fos (promoter) and CREB gene transcription. Long story short, calcium causes a phosphorylation chain that basically activates the genes required to build more membrane proteins for calcium (so it can depolarize easier). More specific, look up AMPA and NMDA receptors. They also form dendritic spines that strengthen memory."

NoStupidQuestions,fofs3xl,t3_g7a1xi,1587741843.0,"Right and Conservative, Left and Liberal are synonymous. This dates back to the French revolution I think when the Conservative party was literally on the right side and liberal was on left side of their government building.

Democrat and Republicans are the two biggest political parties in America. Republicans tend to be Conservative, Democrats tend to be liberal both socially and economically relative to each other.

Conservatism and Liberalism are a bit different in every country. But essentially in America, this is usually tied with an Adam Smith view of capitalism, puritan-esqe view of religion, and personal respect for the roots of the country. Basically anything in American history that can be viewed as ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" is most likely Conservative. Liberalism is then generally the opposite.

However partywise, the Republicans and Democrats fall along a spectrum (I think in most countries with dominant political paritis is like that) so you have very liberal democrats versus moderately liberal democrats versus Conservative democrats and then the same for Republicans based on what they're trying to achieve."

PhysicsStudents,fo0ztnh,t3_g52vug,1587422926.0,"rip just saw your question get removed.

But it depends on what you mean.

We already have machines that can predict the future. They're called computers. If you plug in some variables into an equation and work them out, you can predict where a car, projectile, etc will go.

So the real question is ""how detailed can you predict?"" You'd notice that the more specific you get, the bigger system you need to stimulate the resolution what could potentially happen. So by the time you want to predict let's say the Earth down to the molecule, you'll theoretically need a computer that has at least 1 transistor representing 1 molecule on Earth. (And a transistor itself is a molecule, so it won't be of much use since you're literally just building another Earth calculating at the same speed). (One more note for this, if you've done intro to quantum mechanics, you've probably learned that you basically need a supercomputer to stimulate any atomic interaction that's larger than helium. So yeah...)

Moving on to the scale of the universe, I think it won't work out entropically because organizing all the necessary data would take more energy than the energy the universe has (if building this is even possible)."

And finally, lines for most US hospitals is usually at most a week or two for non-emergency cases.
