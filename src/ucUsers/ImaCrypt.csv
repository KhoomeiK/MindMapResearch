UCSD,fpm1p1m,t1_fpj4ytm,1588723758.0,"Yeah I mean, it's not like the faculty is racist. I've dealt with racist faculty before and UCSD itself doesn't seem to have racist faculty as far as I know.

But how would you know if a good amount of students are?"
UCSD,fpm13wv,t1_fplvaye,1588723417.0,"Holy shit. Sorry to hear that. Had no idea UCSD had that side to it. Let me guess, it was a group of kids and you were either alone or they had you out numbered.

As for the international students keeping to themselves, more than racism, I think it's just there's no reason or incentive to get out of their comfort zone if they can do well in school with no problems even with a huge language barrier. How they can get by like that, I have no idea. I wish they would make an effort, but it's just not realistic. So there definitely is a divide between ethnic backgrounds, which can potentially turn into racism or start having racist/generalized thoughts of a certain group. It's unfortunate really.

I don't know if calling you the wrong racial slur or yelling racial slurs to a LATINO student in SAN DIEGO is more surprising... I hope a nice Salvadorian fellow from MS13 over hears it next time. Easy to be yell racist shit in La Jolla, cowards."
UCSD,fpjj43p,t1_fpj4ytm,1588670430.0,Care to elaborate? I've only recently found about this being a legit issue.
UCSD,fpjj0z6,t1_fpivq3s,1588670335.0,"Agree with both of you. To rant and get things off your chest, I totally understand. But it's obvious someone get overly defensive, dismisses another's experience, and then leads to direct attacks at each other instead of addressing issue itself. This goes for both sides. Sometimes your experience in a roll of the dice and personal circumstances that is different from yours, so to dismissing another's opinion because you had a different subjective experience is narrow minded, comes off as overcompensating, and childish."
UCSD,fpj8aey,t1_fpj82k1,1588659615.0,Also the difference in interaction with some professors during lecture and speaking 1on1 during OH or a scheduled time is night and day.

UCSD,fpj82k1,t3_garsoi,1588659419.0,"Just solely according to the comments here, it seems like he has a rigid teach style and is pretty passionate about his field and doesn't show as much compassion to students that don't share the same amount of passion for his field. I guess if you are crazy about Ochem (yes, I've witnessed this rare breed of people exist), he sounds like one of the best professor you can have. Otherwise, probably wouldn't pick him as your favorite professor. Just assuming here, seems like OP had a personal ""beef"" that happens more often than it should? Again, only basing off the comments."
UCSD,fpj7gq6,t1_fpit78u,1588658864.0,"Hmmm, I can't tell if it's my computer or Zoom because the meeting prior, I had no problems. Didn't change a thing and it stopped working the next time. It's very annoying..."
UCSD,fpj7cmc,t1_fpi14nc,1588658764.0,"Tried all of that actually, no avail :( Thanks for the advice though. I think my computer itself is having problems. My Windows reset to factory settings at least 2 times now. I need Windows for specific hardware drivers. Most of my files were still there, but I had to reinstall some programs. Can't find too much info on google, it's kind of urgent too and really annoying!"
UCSD,fpgqu4n,t3_gd5s4k,1588607840.0,"All of them seem more lenient, but I don't think it's easier. It seems like it until you take a quiz or exam, it's harder due to open notes I think? Not being able to go back and double check my answers kinda suck because I'm the type to make stupid mistakes and catch them going back and double checking.   


It's hard to keep up with the schedule because I'm not physically there and not as attentive. The consecutive days in my room with no change doesn't make it easier! AND my computer's clock has been changing to a different time so sometimes I'm so lost lol"
UCSD,fpfqnrh,t3_gd10sz,1588580006.0,"One of my professors gave us a choice to either work alone on the final or work in groups. I'm going to work by myself, as much as I had both good and bad experiences, right now isn't the best time for me to deal with other bullshit that could be avoided. I think giving us an option to do so is the best. For this quarter at least."
UCSD,fpbsfy8,t1_fpbr885,1588477566.0,"That makes sense, I don't know why I thought protests would be a positive thing (for sticking up for change together I guess?) but logically it makes no sense lol. Yeah I remember being surprised at how ghetto it was."
UCSD,fpbrre2,t1_fpbhopf,1588477087.0,"> Greek lifeâ€™s chill and unique 

If you mean because frats/sororities are illegal in La Jolla, sure is unique. Not in a frat but the few I knew were chill."
UCSD,fpbr5h7,t1_fpbjd1m,1588476660.0,Damn sorry to hear that. Had no idea that happens here. What the fuck.
UCSD,fpbqzv3,t1_fpbofqx,1588476548.0,"Personal experience, rather the interpretation and memory of events are subjective so even with the same professor/department/etc., extrapolating one person's experience across the board really doesn't mean anything. As for the opposing view, I agree. The first time before I took a leave, was horrible. After returning, it's not nearly as bad, almost good - in both cases, external factors and extenuating circumstances play(ed) a huge role. This sub is pretty split, many extremists on both sides."
UCSD,fpbpyyd,t1_fpboke0,1588475824.0,Cal is depressing? I only visited once so I wouldn't know but I imagine they would be more involved/active which I automatically correlated with not-depressing. Can you elaborate?
UCSD,fpbpr2v,t1_fpbnvua,1588475671.0,"About the socially dead thing, we're all on the same level now. Unless no mic/no vid/no chat in a 50+ students in a Zoom lecture is ....actually I have no idea!"
UCSD,fpbp4nk,t1_fp3s6bm,1588475238.0,I meant to include if the computer store on campus....forget what it's called.. is open but will keep that in mind next time.
UCSD,fp1naa7,t3_garsoi,1588241458.0,"No idea who this man is, but is he known to be like this or perhaps it's been a bit tough for him?

I especially hate it when professors or anyone who is responsible for teaching professionally take their own problems issues out on their students. It was way more of an impact than many realize.

I don't know how true the OP is because that is only 1/3 of the story but totally believable so thats unfortunate. Sucks you're likely not going to want to learn more ochem for this quarter at least.

But if he seems especially more negative than usual, maybe he's going through a lot. It's still not a valid reason to be shitty but maybe a little compassion might be worth considering!"
UCSD,fp1mbtq,t1_fp13hjz,1588240502.0,"I've never experienced it myself, and only source of info I have is here, but I wonder if anyone truly was falsely accused and wrongly penalized?"
UCSD,fp1m2qe,t3_garycm,1588240246.0,Only with my current major
UCSD,fp1hk0m,t1_foz9wxf,1588235762.0,Have you had a class with dual-cast? You see both professor and the slides in 1 vid. I dont think its common because I only had one prof that did it. Didnt even know it existed till then.
UCSD,fp1gtdf,t1_fp16gwa,1588235041.0,Was about to say that lol
