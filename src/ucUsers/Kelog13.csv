nhl,fop94zo,t1_fonr8er,1587955858.0,"I second everything in this comment :) I’ve always felt like being a Sharks fan is like being part of a big family! I’ve been going to Sharks game since before I was born (when I was a fetus lol) and I can’t even imagine what life would be like without them. I think part of the familial aspect comes from the Sharks being the only major pro sports team we have in San Jose (we also have the Quakes in the MLS, SJ Giants in MiLB, and SJ Barracuda in AHL) so we’re fiercely proud of them. One of the happiest moments of my life was seeing the Sharks FINALLY make it to the Finals in 2016, with the win over Vegas being a close second. Plus, it’s really easy to meet the players, go to any Sharks practice, hang out after, and lots of them will stop to talk and sign autographs. I even got Joel Ward to record a message for my friend once! We’d love to have you as a part of the family if the Oilers don’t get you first lol

On another note, I’m thinking I may do this for the NBA, since I like basketball but don’t know who to root for (I should be a Warriors fan, but I’m not lol) so I may steal your idea."

aspergers,fnhyg7j,t3_g1rch6,1586970947.0,"Yes and no. When I studied abroad in Japan, there were certain things I was very comfortable with some things (like the public transportation and convenience stores) and others felt weird (all their unspoken social rules and the homogeneous society). The things I was uncomfortable with wouldn’t really affect a trip, and they didn’t really affect my study abroad much, but I’d imagine living there they would, you probably can’t use the “I’m a foreigner” excuse if you’ve been there for 10 years.

I also worked in Ecuador for a few months, and while there were probably more things I didn’t like, I felt more comfortable there, probably because the culture is more similar to that in California. Plus, some of the people there look like me, so I’m not as obviously “foreign”. 

I guess I’d look at what I want in a new country to live in and then go from there."
