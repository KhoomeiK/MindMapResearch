ucla,fphpq1f,t1_fphllrl,1588625544.0,"Just submitted one! I also recommend citing Election Code 8.2.6.b.: 

""E-mail:
i. Any e-mail that contains campaign literature or is an endorsement slip 
may only be sent to: 
1. A subscription listserv that the sender is a member of. For the purposes of this code a “subscription listserv” will be defined as a 
list of emails that were voluntarily collected for the purpose of communication within a specific group. It strictly excludes all 
listservs that Association members are required to subscribe to in order to receive an official University service (i.e. the Association 
listserv, or the Office of Residential Life listserv).
2. Individuals whom the sender personally knows."""
ucla,fphkfyo,t1_fphj0xj,1588622848.0,They are probably referring to that one guy saying the n word in the chat during the Zoom meeting. The guy claimed to be a student and supportive of Orion but anyone can enter the meeting so I have suspicions about that. I have not heard of any other instance so it is likely they were using that to dramatize the actual situation.

ucla,fn8d8wg,t1_fn7q5ve,1586739062.0,"oooo great info, thanks!"
ucla,fn8d7q6,t1_fn7ye05,1586739042.0,Phew! Glad it helped LOL
ucla,fn4jtzl,t1_fn2sknb,1586642846.0,"Wow, thank you! Yes, I would love to learn how to articulate my thought process better, and it is one of my main reasons for considering philosophy. I would like to ask another question if that is okay with you: what kind of person do you think should major in philosophy? As in, what kind of interests should you already have that will give one the motivation to study philosophy in order to succeed in the major? I honestly have no idea about any philosophical concepts and am aware a lot of people already have many misconceptions of what the study is. I know it is not just asking big questions, there is a lot of other stuff involved."

ucla,fn1j45a,t1_fn1irtj,1586563095.0,"I am considering English, because that is where I discovered the love of writing and thinking critically, but I am looking for something more oriented towards learning about HOW to argue effectively, not the literary analysis type of stuff that is common in English. Then again, I have never done anything like philosophy and it seems so difficult as it is so abstract."
