> “We are grateful for your work,” she said. “And this isn’t about you. It is about how the management of Amazon and the corporation as a whole treats all of its workers.”

The average compensation package for the 54,000 Amazon employees in her district undoubtedly includes a significant amount of AMZN shares.  Although Amazon is the last FAANG company I’d want to work for, compared to the average corporate employee in America, Amazon corporate employees are compensated and treated well.  I doubt she is going to find a sympathetic audience amongst her constituents."
