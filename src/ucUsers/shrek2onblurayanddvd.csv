Midterms season always makes me feel so defeated and like a loser."
ucla,fpi4nvr,t1_fpi4gxk,1588633586.0,Agreed...this is trashy behavior. It’s really not ok to make fun of people’s physical appearance and on such a public platform
ucla,fpdtf81,t3_gcqnpo,1588533866.0,I’ve seen people hammock in the grassy areas in de neve plaza
ucla,fpbs2th,t1_fpbqqzq,1588477311.0,This
ucla,fp50f0e,t1_fp4p8bv,1588312401.0,"I see, thanks for the response."
ucla,fp4mg22,t1_fp4lugp,1588302265.0,"This, and how you ended up finding out?

We are rooting for you. I hope you get better and I’m sorry this has happened to you."
ucla,fopfcub,t1_foox9on,1587960057.0,"That’s true, the extra month gives me more hope"
ucla,foomu9e,t3_g8oieg,1587942143.0,"My thoughts: I feel like part of it might be online but not the full thing, just looking at what CSUF is doing. They are assuming it will *begin* online but didn’t say necessarily the whole thing will be online.

No one knows until UCLA admin says so though."
ucla,fonyynq,t1_fonlugd,1587929236.0,"Come again???? He’s a freakin angel. if this is the worst class you’ve taken at UCLA, your class schedule every year must be amazing..."
ucla,fomk0fs,t3_g85r0h,1587892910.0,Math 32B. f that class
ucla,foemddl,t3_g6xcai,1587707723.0,All fun and games until the TA pops in to check in on how the conversation is going
ucla,foem87w,t1_foea1it,1587707605.0,I bet. I wish I were there to take a walk around it
ucla,fobv6c9,t3_g6r3pv,1587664017.0,Yes it’s basically a public park
ucla,fo6j0pg,t3_g5wkgc,1587560029.0,"Still think international/out of state tuition needs to be more expensive than in-state because my family’s paid high taxes in this state their whole adult lives basically that go directly to state funding for our state schools.

But I’m not surprised they won’t lower the tuition for everyone because the pandemic has actually caused the UC to incur hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and lowering tuition would just raise that number even more.

Sucks that you have to watch lectures at odd times though, thankfully my professors are reasonable and record them all"
ucla,fo408ly,t3_g5l14r,1587495966.0,Waiting it out for now
memes,fnuolvw,t1_fnuls46,1587267133.0,That's hilarious

ucla,fnmofyv,t3_g2oqru,1587075137.0,That’s what you get for trying to be funny (and being irritating instead).
ucla,fnmo4mc,t3_g2oryl,1587074969.0,I like it but it’s just really fucking hard to focus
ucla,fmuttaf,t1_fmutn5s,1586398732.0,Ohhhh I see. Thank you!
ucla,fmutgnv,t3_fxjtgs,1586398513.0,I’m ashamed to have gotten this far in my UCLA career and still not know a lot about P/NP. Would someone mind explaining the benefits of choosing P/NP over a grade?
ucla,fmtwery,t3_fxcwou,1586380197.0,My roommates and I are deciding to wait. Every 2 weeks seeing what the latest updates are. Do noooot want to sign a lease and then find out school’s gonna be online in the fall
ucla,fmiqcr3,t3_fv7wls,1586114773.0,"I’m lucky to have a stable and loving home to come to amid the pandemic.

But it sucks that my family is religious and doesn’t know that I’m not, so i have to participate in all the traditions and practices with them just to keep the image up and so they keep helping me financially.

I’m surviving by FaceTiming friends and taking walks around my neighborhood at odd times."
