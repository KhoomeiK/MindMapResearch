One time I left my door open, I ended up talking from 1 to 4 am with some hallmates.  I would also get the occasional random invitation to do things together and it's always a lot of fun.  I once went to Albertsons at around midnight cuz my roommate mentioned wanting to eat chips!

I definitely recommend trying new things and being open to interacting with people."
UCI,fngfcom,t3_g150qm,1586930492.0,"I came in at week 0 and participated in the world record balloon tag game with my dormmates, which was fun.  I also spent a significant amount of time trying to find all my classes.  I got pretty lost and kept walking around in circles, quite literally.  You should definitely figure out where your classes are before the first day.  I also went to the Anteater Involvement Fair which is an event where you get to talk to clubs and learn more about them.  I recommend joining a club if you can afford the time, it's a great way to make new friends!

Days were typically relaxing, I'd walk to campus, attend one or two classes, and return to the dorm area to have lunch with my friend at the cafeteria.  I had gaps in my schedule so I'd eventually have to come back to campus for another class, but I found the walks relaxing.  Even when it was a night class, I felt relatively safe on campus.

What I like about UCI is the friendly community when you actually try talking to people.  I feel a lot more free in college to do whatever I want, whenever I want.  Things get pretty spontaneous if you're willing to try (though I say this as someone who lived in a dorm with active hallmates)."
