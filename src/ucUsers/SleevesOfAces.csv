I am a very social person and feed of the energy of my friends to keep me going. I think I should get this game because it will help during this time of isolation and social distancing. It will make me feel like close with my friends even though their not.

What do you get when you when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him trash!

Thank you OP"
