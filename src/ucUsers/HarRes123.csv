berkeley,fpdzq1p,t3_fqdm9d,1588537478.0,"So I just realized that I submitted my housing application twice: once when I first accepted my offer of admission, and again after I found my roommates. Obviously, I only want the latter to be reviewed. What should I do? Is this going to be a problem? Any help is appreciated!!"
berkeley,fpb9npa,t3_gcekaa,1588465098.0,This is so relatable
berkeley,fp6rtud,t3_gbn8ki,1588357506.0,At home
berkeley,foxhj3s,t1_foxhedl,1588144179.0,I was about to say
berkeley,fowi89j,t1_fowhim5,1588120284.0,Do you agree with OP’s overall point?
berkeley,fow9lml,t1_fow0sva,1588115565.0,Yeah perhaps. Ugh.
berkeley,fovwgw1,t1_fovvwpf,1588108727.0,What about institutions like Purdue and UO that have said they plan to hold in-person classes in the fall? Don’t they face the exact same problem?
berkeley,fovw5ur,t1_fovvwpf,1588108574.0,Damn :(
berkeley,fovsw20,t1_fovstuq,1588106950.0,I REALLY hope it isn’t.
berkeley,fovry5p,t1_fovrryq,1588106488.0,"Yeah that’s all true. I just can’t image Berkeley would refrain from offering housing unless mandated to do so—its such a huge financial loss, and they’re already struggling."
ApplyingToCollege,folriwc,t1_folrb8n,1587868783.0,"Yeah that makes sense.

Theres so much a love about Cal, but I don’t wanna fuck myself over by not being able to declare CS—despite my previous experience."
ApplyingToCollege,folpxe6,t1_folnt3w,1587867718.0,"Next semester will also impacted by Covid-19, and it’s very likely that the declaration policy changes could still be in place."
ApplyingToCollege,folp3os,t1_folnt3w,1587867173.0,That's interesting. Thank you.
ApplyingToCollege,folm14u,t1_foll9e2,1587865172.0,"Thanks so much for the thoughtful response! Do you think that they would actually make the pre recs harder for the class of 2024? That wouldn't really be fair to the students who chose to enroll under the assumption that they would only need a 3.3 to declare. For the class of 2025 and beyond, I think that all makes sense, since the prospective students would be aware of the change before choosing to enroll."
ApplyingToCollege,folfnnv,t1_folestr,1587861210.0,That all makes sense. But what about the fact that Cal is right next to SV? Isn't that a huge perk for someone pursuing CS?
ApplyingToCollege,folffae,t1_folej3i,1587861069.0,"I totally get the GPA pre recs for Cal CS and all that. However, and I don't mean to sound like a prick, I think I should be able to meet the requirement fairly easily (I've been doing app development for years \[Swift, Python\] and I do VR development at a very prestigious university \[C# + Unity.\]) I also don't think that freshman can declare CS—I'm pretty sure it takes a minimum of three semesters."
ApplyingToCollege,folejvw,t1_folegct,1587860536.0,In what ways are Cal impersonal compared to Cornell?
ApplyingToCollege,fole81l,t1_fole769,1587860339.0,Why so?
ApplyingToCollege,foijx8l,t1_foifrdx,1587788515.0,What school
berkeley,fo7o3nw,t1_fo60gal,1587581644.0,Yeah. I really just wanna be on campus.
berkeley,fo5ros3,t1_fo5m4j9,1587533593.0,I don’t think this is true.
berkeley,fo5o51m,t1_fo5h6cb,1587530669.0,Maybe I will
berkeley,fo5juil,t1_fo5jm6h,1587527413.0,that’s good news. No one can expect everything to be normal. I just want it to be somewhat normal lol. Thanks for the info
berkeley,fo5fem4,t1_fo5fd54,1587524327.0,18 years is a lot of years
berkeley,fo5cel6,t1_fo5ccll,1587522321.0,They can’t not have them if people are on campus. They won’t be able to house everyone
berkeley,fo57fid,t1_fo56gzx,1587519144.0,f
berkeley,fo56xe7,t1_fo56u5d,1587518831.0,Facts. I’m a pre frosh tho so it’s on campus or nothing :(
berkeley,fo50sqz,t1_fo507v9,1587515078.0,Idk what I’d do with myself
berkeley,fn8nvxg,t1_fn8n5mt,1586745949.0,Is it bad to take it next fall? Is it big problem to do so? There are worse things then taking an “easy” class—I just don’t want it to interfere with anything else.
berkeley,fn8caxt,t1_fn8agog,1586738476.0,Hmmm. Interesting. Thank you
berkeley,fn89cyx,t1_fn88ndt,1586736673.0,Would it be super burdensome to take it first semester? I don’t think I’ll have too much difficultly doing well. Would it interfere with my ability to take higher level math courses?
berkeley,fn8963r,t1_fn895c7,1586736558.0,How would that work?
berkeley,fn88jta,t3_fqa36x,1586736182.0,"Hi everyone. I’m an incoming freshman, and I plan on majoring in CS. I’m coming from a small private school in Brooklyn, and they don’t offer AP class (and consequently, no AP tests). Instead, we have AT (advanced topics) classes, which are of similar difficultly. 

I am taking AT Calc 1&2, which is roughly equivalent to BC. I think it’s wise for me to take calc 2 again, since this semester has been crazy due to the coronavirus. However, I really don’t want to take calc 1 again—I found it very easy and I don’t think I’ll get much out of 1a. 

Am I able to skip math 1a and go right into 1b without the AP credit? Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
berkeley,fmtmjkn,t1_fmtlnig,1586375296.0,But I know Cornell engineering has a “better reputation” than CAS
berkeley,fmtl3eu,t1_fmtjxck,1586374578.0,But isn’t Cornell Engineering much more prestigious?
berkeley,fmth7iv,t3_fwxe9k,1586372662.0,Would you choose a BS in CS from Cornell over a BA from Berkeley?
berkeley,fmrm3x7,t3_fx19d7,1586327490.0,"Python, Java"
ApplyingToCollege,fmmsgnn,t1_fmlhxrl,1586211203.0,EECS and CS L&S at Berkeley are the same. Same department. Same classes
