lgbt,fpghz3a,t1_fpgbd0i,1588603079.0,"I teach middle school, and I swear my students actually do not have the ability to whisper.  I can’t count the number of times I said it was quiet work time where whispering was ok and they could barely speak in hushed voices.  I know I’m a teacher but I didn’t think I’d have to teach students how to have discreet conversation!!  Moral of the story, being mortified is you learning to whisper."
UCSantaBarbara,foyfmjx,t1_fowfg0r,1588171650.0,"I wouldn’t be surprised if they are pretty similar, at least on the level of what they need to get from each person.  In every budget I’ve seen the highest cost by a long shot is the staffing.  If they are keeping the same number of employees, but cutting out the housing and food, that probably only translates to a small amount less per each attendee.  Also I believe parents also needed to pay if they wanted to attend any of the orientation programs, and I bet they are predicting a much lower parent head count this year."

Ultralight,fonukfv,t1_fonpu5n,1587926750.0,"Woa that’s a really cool chart!  If I am understanding it correctly, that is the weight of fuel you should start with for x-axis number of cooked meals.  Does one meal could as one meal per person?  As in would 1 meal for four people count as 4 meals on the graph?"

UCSantaBarbara,fo6yhsa,t1_fo54mrm,1587569065.0,I think it may be due to the eucalyptus lining the road.  They would probably have to cut them all down to avoid the problem in the new surface within a year or two.  Or if they have to dig down at all they might damage the trees’ root systems.
askgaybros,fo6xry7,t1_fo5p6j1,1587568698.0,"I have no foreskin left, and I’ve jerked it without so much as spit my whole life.  Lube was only for special occasions when no one was home because lube can be loud.  I have friends who only do it with lube, but I wack it so much I ain’t got time for that level of cleanup, and it doesn’t hurt for me."
UCSantaBarbara,fnrigud,t1_fnp8u0q,1587189965.0,"Funny, I’m a first year teacher for 6th and 8th grade (not credentialed yet, UCSC program next year), and it’s not really my ideal age group, I’d rather work with high schoolers.  Teaching has gotten soo much easier without the constant classroom management.  I guess some students try to make you feel bad in different ways at different ages!"

3Dprinting,fng30ip,t1_fng2cae,1586921128.0,"For a while I actually found it easier to print with than PLA.  It stuck to my bed really well, and my main issue with PLA was getting it to stick to the bed.  There are quite a few really good guides to printing with it out there.  A heated bed is a requirement, I have one with an ultra base on my Anycubic I3 Mega."
DMAcademy,fnasvcy,t1_fna5bq5,1586803231.0,"Oh wow I really like the idea of limiting rolls from the rest of the party based on proficiency.  I can see some other exceptions for history as well, maybe the elf in the party isn’t a historian but they are exploring an elven ruin so the PC has some advantage when recalling elven lore.  I really just didn’t know there was a term, dogpiling, for the phenomenon, that puts a name to the face of the problem!"

One of the biggest complaints from my players now is setting up accounts on so many platforms, they can be crotchety haha."
DnD,fn7blp8,t3_fzye79,1586717116.0,"Are you developing an editor for editing inside buildings too?  Or is this mostly going to be for village/city scale maps?  How are you going to have it function online, will one host download the program and then have players log in to it?  Looks great so far, and tons of assets!"

UCSC,fmwyk6w,t3_flb0n2,1586455294.0,"Would anyone be able to fill me in on where grad students usually live?  Are there any good areas I should look in?  I’m going to be starting the grad education program in July (well hopefully).  I went to UCSB where everyone basically lives in one of two places, and there are comparatively so many neighborhoods in Santa Cruz!"

dungeondraft,fmmkvpv,t3_ftdfif,1586207132.0,"It looks like there are a lot of hallways and nooks and crannies.  I think this would be a good trap ridden cave the way it is setup right now.  I usually make combat encounters in larger spaces so the PC's have area to move around, but tight spaces like these hallways could be good for some encounters.  That said I would add more variation in room size, so you have a few of those larger spaces where goblins might congregate and these small tight hallways which might hold mysteries or traps."
