I am in a similar situation and I have literally had to just sit in my small backyard and do my homework to get away from the commotion. If you do not have a backyard or somewhere safe to do it alone, then try to get some sleep during the day and do it at night when everyone is sleeping.

It sucks that you have to make decisions like these and I wish families respected privacy more. But at the end of the day, i guess we just have to have our own backs. This will pass and you'll get through this.

My inbox is always open :)"

I work around 40+ hours a week at 25/hour top of being a full time student. I also have other forms of income that I make online.  I save my 80% of my money during the entire year. I don't worry about accommodation or transportation because I have family in multiple countries/continents that I could stay with because I host them in So Cal when they visit. The only thing I really have to pay for besides a flight (which I get heavily discounted) is my food and excursions. 

Even without accommodation, traveling really isn't as expensive as everyone makes it out to be. You just have to know how to search for the right prices :)   Some people buy clothes and nice cars, I just like to buy experiences."

Paranormal,fo4iee1,t1_fo2pekm,1587504981.0,That‚Äôs what I was thinking but I just couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around it. I‚Äôve always been told that dark magic and all of that is fake and made up from one side of my family but the other side are strong believers in it. They say that it is real and it could cause true danger. I‚Äôm not too familiar with it so I think some research is in my future

I would be SOOOO fucking embarrassed if someone I knew decided to act this way on my behalf, especially when it could be easily reported and could potentially risk my job. The language he was using and talking about your sister while stalking your IG is on some weird shit tbh"
ucr,fmvgidz,t1_fmrpr34,1586416172.0,"If you are able to take French at a later time and want a really amazing professor, I suggest Ramos. She is so helpful and kind to her students. Hopefully this is not who your professor is (which I doubt because it does not sound like her) but she is worth a shot! If it is Ramos, I suggest emailing her privately and voicing your concerns. She really wants her students to learn and she would get the picture."
ucr,fmu51uq,t3_fx0ug9,1586384720.0,Sorry for the rant but i feel the pain! I just wish they would allow us to do pass/no pass just once. It's such a weird situation and it's more difficult than actually just going to class.
ucr,fmu4yn7,t3_fx0ug9,1586384673.0,"I'm absolutely overwhelmed. I want to just cry lol

Im really hard on myself when it comes to school to maintain A's. I usually do homework at the library because it's hard for me to focus when even the smallest noise is present.

This quarter, I am at home and it is already a disaster. My wifi is so weak, everyone in my family speaks really loud so I can't focus, and my professors are giving us 100x more the work. I have no idea how I am supposed to do zoom 4x a day when I can barely find a room in my home that is not occupied since the wifi does NOT reach mine!"
ucr,fmu2rfu,t1_fmrpr34,1586383489.0,Omg! Which professor? There is one that is a pain in the ass and another one who I tried everything possible in order to get into her class.

Honestly though, I would recommend it. 

Campus wise, I don't mind it. I am pretty much alone all day (lol) so I just sit back and observe everything outside of class. I think that there are really good opportunities to join clubs, groups, and make friends here if you're into that. Depending on your major, the courses aren't too bad and they're decently structured. The campus itself is pretty clean and easy to get around compared to other schools. There are plenty of opportunities for tutoring and a ton of personal resources available too! If you're a foodie, there are also plenty of places you could go to off campus to eat within ten minutes. There are also nice events always happening such as concerts, game nights, guest speakers, etc. 

I think the biggest concern people have when they make fun of ucr is the area it is in. I grew up in both Riverside and Newport Beach - two completely different worlds lol. I've heard it all. People from OC and LA say that Riverside is ghetto but I don't mind it here at all. I think the area ucr is in is a lil sketchy but the rest of the city is nice. 

We have downtown which is cool for bar hopping/food/entertainment/etc. The riverside plaza area with tons of food/movies/shopping/etc. The Tyler Mall with shopping/food/movies/etc. and The orange groves which are so nice for IG worthy photos and videos during sunset lol 

My favorite thing is that we are less than an hour from the beach, less than an hour from the mountains, and less than an hour from LA. If you have a car, it could definnnnnitely make your experience way better. Best of luck to you! Sorry for the whole essay but I hope you find what you're looking for!"
