SandersForPresident,fpd7f4j,t1_fpcvdo3,1588521386.0,"Yes they did. The media was on Bernie black out for a majority of the primary and only mentioned him negatively until Super Tuesday when they could finish selling the idea that Biden had legitimately taken the lead, which was only because of Pete and Amy’s endorsements"

saplings,foqy253,t3_g923t0,1588002829.0,"For a while, I decided that I would only smoke in the hours between 5 and 7pm. This made it so I’d be sober when I went to bed and so I could be productive most of the day. I still smoked most days, but it did give me a better relationship with weed and reduce brain fog in the mornings"
camping,fokov8a,t1_fokon1g,1587846130.0,I think the dude was joking when they said that. Clearly you don’t drive with that on top lol

AskReddit,fnu129v,t3_g3omlt,1587252478.0,I want to be cremated and have my body placed into a biodegradable urn that has any kind of tree in the top. That way my nutrients can be slowly reincorporated into a tree.
AnimalTracking,fntudco,t1_fnts4f9,1587248776.0,"My bad, I should have taken note of the size of the track. It does look like a canine track, I just assumed it wouldn’t be a dog due to where I found it. Thanks!"

Bonsai,fnk7qeb,t1_fnjs6hq,1587017527.0,"Be sure to leave it in the dark for a day or two once you’ve repotted it. When you pull a plant like this, it rips all the root hairs off and the plant can dehydrate really easily if you leave it in the sun before it’s able to regrow those. It should be okay if you replant it well and give it time to adjust."

marijuanaenthusiasts,fnel6os,t3_g18arq,1586891338.0,"I started the book. It’s not very scientific, I ended up giving up on it halfway through. I prefer books that are more scientifically based and factually oriented"
ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM,fmxnxo6,t1_fmu1ftb,1586468534.0,"Bruh, politics isn’t a binary system. Nobody has to vote for a candidate that they don’t support, that’s not democracy."
