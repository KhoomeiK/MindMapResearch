ucla,fnfutac,t3_g1hryf,1586915926.0,"highly do not recommend this. I know people whose life was very difficult because they came in as PHYSICS and wanted to switch into engineering (although it’s doable if you are determined!). You have to take an engineering course load for two or three whole quarters and get a competitive GPA (above 3.5, higher if a lot of people are trying to switch) which can be difficult in those freshman weeder classes. However, if you are a music student it will be near impossible to even *get in* to those classes, let alone get high enough grades considering you will also probably have to be in music classes. I know people in physics/math who wanted to switch to engineering and barely were able to pull it off because you need to take pre-engineering classes to switch , but engineering students will have priority enrollment for those classes, so it’s hard to even get in. The bottom line is, I don’t recommend applying to some major just as a back door to some other more competitive major you desire. Ucla implements terribly annoying bureaucratic shit to prevent a bunch of people from doing this. If anything, I recommend coming in as some physical science or math major (in the college of letters and sciences). Those majors are not as competitive to get accepted into as engineering is. You can switch between any majors in the college of letters and sciences at orientation.

This post is not meant to tell people that can’t do science and music. Some people can! If you love music and think you would enjoy being a music major too, then all power to you! but I highly HIGHLy recommend against being in a major that you KNOW you don’t want to do just to get in easier.

Also from what I know the jazz program here is fairy competitive too? I’m sure applying to a major in college of letters and sciences will give you a better chance or similar chance of admission anyways."

ucla,fn11gcl,t3_fyjyls,1586552890.0,Love how these are the kind of people who want to become politicians and probably are in clubs that try to “improve democracy” and decrease corruption in the voting system. Yet when they have their own little government world they try to manipulate votes and democracy. The amount of leaders I have seen in USAC who act directly against their proclaimed political values when given their own leadership position is actually disgusting.
ucla,floofsm,t3_fq4hj1,1585342260.0,"I’m out of state. I grew up hearing about Berkeley and not much about UCLA. Quite arbitrarily, senior year of high school berkeley became my dream school. I wanted to get in so badly, and when I did the application I decided to check the boxes to apply to UCLA and UCSD as well, because I wasn’t confident I would get into berkeley. By the time my UCLA acceptance came around, I had already been accepted to other programs in other states I wanted more. I didn’t think too much of my UCLA acceptance, I opened it at mcdonald’s on my phone without much thought. When my berkeley acceptance came I was totally ecstatic. My mind was set on berkeley. I went and visited both Berkeley and UCLA. I didn’t even want to visit UCLA but I was visiting USC, where I thought I might want to go, and decided to just visit UCLA since I was in the city. On bruin day I loved UCLA. I talked to a lot of students who just seemed so happy. Campus was beautiful. One student I talked to started crying because they only had a few months left. People were out having fun. A week later I visited Cal and even though it was Cal day and was supposed to be fun, it felt kinda dead and sad. I couldn’t put my finger on it. People i talked to seemed stressed and not as happy as ucla. It just didn’t feel right in my gut. As i drove back to my hotel after visiting cal, i signed my SIR for UCLA. I couldn’t be happier and I have never regretted the decision.

Of course each campus is better suited for some than others. I’m not saying my opinion is right. It is just my experience. But if the ONE factor that makes you choose berkeley is the “better” academics or prestige, i would recommend you rethink that. As a high schooler, the prestige of the college you attend seems so disproportionately important. You don’t even think about that once you are there. Both schools are ranked about equally and both schools will give you great career prospects. Choose a school where you see yourself the happiest."
