If you are comfortable, I would love for you to share your experiences. I had one incident happen to me with some int. students calling me stupid in a class. Yikes!"

Edit: I was making an educated guess earlier (I have a Masters in Finance) but since this comment is getting traction I looked it up. I was wrong.

This rule is in place to help banks meet their reserve requirement, which is cash the institution must have on hand, usually a percentage of the number of deposit liabilities the commercial bank owes to its customers.

These reserve requirements apply to certain types of deposits and other liabilities that depository institutions have, according to the Federal Register. For instance, savings deposits aren’t subject to reserve requirements. But transaction accounts are subject to reserve requirement ratios.

Regulation D imposes a limit on ""convenient"" transactions on your savings account. (Seems like a roundabout way of applying reserve requirements to savings accounts). Anyways, your bank doesn't want you to make more than six of these ""convenient"" types of outgoing transactions from your savings account each month:

* Overdraft transfers
* Electronic funds transfers (EFTs) 
* Automated clearing house (ACH) transfers 
* Transfers made by phone, fax, computer, or mobile device 
* Wire transfers made by phone, fax, computer, or mobile device 
* Checks written to a third party 
* Debit card transactions

Of course you can usually get around the 6 transaction limit by performing an ""inconvenient transaction"". If you use an ATM or a bank teller to move your money, it's all good. And if you call the bank and ask it to mail you a check from your savings account, that's also fine.

That said, your bank might decide to impose stricter rules and not exempt these transactions. You'll have to read the terms and conditions of your savings account or ask customer service to see what rules apply to your account.

Here is how 3 banks handle these transactions (from Investopedia)

Chase: Even though Regulation D does not limit withdrawals or transfers from a savings account made in person at a branch or at an ATM, Chase charges a $5 Savings Withdrawal Limit fee on all withdrawals or transfers out of savings accounts in excess of six per monthly statement period.

Bank of America: BOA charges $10 for each withdrawal or transfer in excess of six per monthly statement cycle. The bank also caps excess withdrawal or transfer charges to six ($60) per cycle. Customers with a minimum daily balance of at least $20,000 and Preferred Rewards Program members are exempt from these charges.

Wells Fargo: Wells Fargo Charges a $15 excess activity fee with a limit of three ($45) per monthly fee period for transactions that exceed the limit of six imposed by Regulation D.
