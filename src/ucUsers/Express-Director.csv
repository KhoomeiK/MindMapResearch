UCSantaBarbara,fn4lw4n,t1_fn4lu3b,1586644079.0,I call it a bluff unless emails are sent to whoever cheated. We may never know though ðŸ˜•
UCSantaBarbara,fn49p9s,t1_fn49mkt,1586636917.0,"Yeah Iâ€™m in that same Groupme. Nothing remotely close to cheating was sent in there. If anyone was caught cheating, it was probably someone else. Itâ€™s a 600 person class."
UCSantaBarbara,fn3yvuv,t3_fyw1z0,1586630646.0,"Isnâ€™t it possible she could be bluffing? Kellyâ€™s obviously very smart and since the final is on gauchospace she could be scaring kids into not cheating. Iâ€™m in the class and I havenâ€™t heard of anything else, Iâ€™m not even taking the optional final."
malegrooming,fmllmyx,t1_fmlbhwm,1586188810.0,Hahaha thanks for the kind words!
malegrooming,fmijf52,t1_fmijd4m,1586110772.0,Honestly I have no idea. Maybe talk to your barber about it. Thatâ€™s your best bet.
