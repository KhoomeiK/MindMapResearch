AskDocs,fn9btmz,t1_fn91pj2,1586766845.0,"If you get hypothyroidism before puberty starts it will delay puberty or even make it so you can't complete puberty. If you get hypothyroidism during puberty it will stunt growth. In rare cases, it can lead to early puberty as well. If it's treated in time you can catch up to the growth you were supposed to be at."

Hypothyroidism,fn1wrjq,t3_fyh51h,1586571980.0,yes sometimes it can take a while since you had it for symptoms to kick in as your body starts to break down from lack of thyroid hormone as time goes on.
