Hell, down in San Diego I know of at least 3 spots off the top of my head that are literally in the middle of industrial parks with nothing but cement around and yet they have bass in them.

InlandEmpire,foyy169,t3_g9xko6,1588181290.0,"It’s always shitty when your car gets stolen, I feel for you. My girlfriends car has been stolen twice, once from a parking lot in MV when she went to a store in broad daylight for 20 minutes, and another time from in front of our house. The waiting game is the most stressful, because you have no idea where your car is. Most likely, you’ll get a phone call some time in the next 5 days saying they found your car. 

Hopefully they didn’t fuck the electronics up, the second time my girls car got stolen they tore out the ignition switch and a bunch of cables. When the police found the car they had it towed, at our expense mind you, and then AFTER paying to get it out the guy at the tow shop dropped it out front with a forklift. Definitely let the cops know, if you haven’t already told them, that you want them to call you as soon as they find it no matter the condition. At least that way if it needs to be towed, you can tow it to your house instead of paying 300+ bucks to get it out THEN get it towed. (If it needs any repair work I could potentially help out, I’m an engineering student about to graduate and I need money, I’m great with mechanic stuff lol)

Finally, a lot of the time when a car gets stolen, especially without a key, it only drives a few miles before it just stops working. Usually it’s an electrical problem or it just runs out of gas. But also, a good portion of the time the people that steal cars are homeless and they’re gonna park it either In some back corner of a secluded parking lot, or some secluded street that hardy anybody drives down. Especially in the hotter and colder months, they just want shelter. Or to sell for parts, but from all of mine and my friends/family experiences that’s usually not the case. Anyways, I would recommend (if you have access to another vehicle) to drive around your area, check local parking lots like wal marts, especially behind the store and in dark corners. Also check some of the back roads by you. Both times my girlfriends car got stolen it was found within 4 miles of where it was stolen from. On top of this, when they do steal it just for a place to sleep, or when they can’t start it again, they usually only stay for one or two days before abandoning it. 

I know what you’re going through and it sucks, just keep your head up. People are fucking shit, but it’ll turn up again."

bassfishing,foikcoa,t1_fohlo4k,1587788833.0,"Was in Oregon fishing with a cousin back in my childhood. He swung his rod way over his head to do a power cast and as he went forward with it the 1 ounce swim bait, which had swung back like a pendulum, went straight into his calf. Not like the muscled up part of the calf either, but the really soft fatty tissue below the back of his knee. I was pretty young and wasn’t too experienced with fishing yet, and apparently he had never hooked himself with a barbed hook before. He started trying to pull it out the same way it went in, and it just started to bleed more. He ended up getting pissed and yanking it hard as shit, tearing open about a 2 inch wide gash in his leg. Highly recommend not doing that lol. You made the smart move"

philadelphia,fn0i1c4,t1_fn0g0my,1586542315.0,"I was just about to say something similar; what is it with redditors *like you* being so fucking retarded? Either you don’t know what drug addiction is like (I’ve seen it first hand literally countless times throughout my life, ended friendships because *multiple* people I have helped try to get back on their feet have stolen shit from me) or you’re a fucking enabler. If you don’t do drugs, good for you but I don’t give a fuck. If you do drugs, good for you but I don’t give a fuck. Why? Because I don’t know, nor do I give a fuck, about you. The fact that you’re soooooo for the rights of these “people” who don’t do a fucking god damn thing except steal and do their drugs, means you have either never been in contact with an *actual* addict, or you are an enabler. My guess is the latter, but I don’t care regardless. 

You’re gonna die some day, without question. Your life will literally be gone, and every neural pathway in your brain that corresponds to a specific memory will be 100% gone forever. Same with me, and everybody else on the planet. If somebody wants to spend their time on earth doing drugs, fuck em. Let em. I’ve been around this shit so fucking much and I’m tired of it. 99% of these people don’t change. And if they do, nice. Good for them. But I don’t care and don’t want to be in their life anymore.

By the way, I’m not suggesting we go out and kill all severe drug addicts/less intelligent individuals, like a eugenicist would. I’m simply saying if somebody does overdose then it was *THEIR FUCKING CHOICE AND THEIR FUCKING FAULT*. “But my drug dealer put fentanyl in there” really? You’re surprised that your *drug dealer* did something fucked up?"

philadelphia,fn0euj9,t1_fmzqfmx,1586540638.0,"Bull fuckin shit. At the end of the day if you choose to buy some gnarly fucking drug from some sketchy ass dude on the street, then your life is in your own hands. I’m really getting tired of seeing celebrities overdose, because they chose to do either a ton of drugs or really sketchy drugs, and then everybody blames the person selling those drugs. You do realize that the drugs *will* be out there regardless of who sells them and what the punishment is, right? You may as well get mad at the last 10 drug kingpins that have come out of Mexico and Colombia over the last 3 decades, and fuck it while you’re at it just get mad at the rest of those countries citizens. I mean if Felix Gallardo and Pablo Escobar didn’t do it, somebody else would’ve done the same exact thing, which is simply create supply for something in high demand.

To be quite honest, I couldn’t give the slightest fuck about Chynna overdosing, or the life events of any other celebrity for that matter. WE ALL DIE EVENTUALLY. I literally don’t give a fuck how it happens to celebrities, and I DEFINITELY don’t give a fuck if they overdosed on drugs. Drugs that costed the lives of hundreds or thousands of poor people doing what they can to feed their families, PER BATCH. Everybody thinks drugs are so fucking terrible when a celebrity overdoses, but they don’t bat a fucking eye when those same celebrities have single handedly caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people due to cartel/street/gang violence. If they want to overdose let them, but stop treating these people like they’re gods just because they make music or movies that *some* people like"
