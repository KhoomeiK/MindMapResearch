UCSantaBarbara,fntrf2f,t3_g320ef,1587247271.0,"You may also want to check out the CCS Computing major if you think that’s something you’re interested in! It’s very project oriented from what I’ve seen from friends in the major, and the classes are extremely small (10 people) so you get a lot of individual attention. It’s definitely competitive to get in but worth a shot if you’re passionate about CS (plus there’s a lot of other perks that come with CCS in general)"
