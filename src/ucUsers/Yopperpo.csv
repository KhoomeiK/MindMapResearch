UCI,fply9tk,t3_gdtlwc,1588721809.0,"There are lots of resources for learning the Math 13 material..however the \*best\* one in my opinion is Hmmack's Book of Proof which explains all of the material in english whereas the official resources can get lost in the notation. Was a little lost at the beginning of math 13 (especially around induction and relations) until this book saved me. You can download it free here:

UCI,fpbilrc,t3_gc3bs4,1588470854.0,"The Berkeley courseload is real. My Berkeley friends also dreaded the workload but tell me after graduation they were really glad they went through it. The only career path I wouldn't recommend UCB over UCI for is premed due to grade deflation, but for Engineering I would think Berkeley's Engineering department will definitely have better networking opportunities and in the long run pay off more."
UCI,fpbdeok,t3_gcdigz,1588467460.0,"as long as you register right when restrictions lift, you'll probably get in. i got into 33 and 43 fall 2018 back when i was a nonmajor."
UCI,fozsmbx,t3_ga6h3h,1588196147.0,"I did part of my undergrad at Cal Poly Pomona before transferring to UCI.

For pre-med, I would recommend SLO. [Grade deflation at UC's is real](https://i.imgur.com/jVebQGD.png). From my experience at Pomona, professors were more lax in giving out higher grades than professors here.

In particular, our department of physical sciences (chemistry, physics, math) has pretty strict grading distributions with approximately 20 percent As. UCI has a lot of very smart students, and getting within the top 20% of these courses will take a lot of hard work.

You can check out grade distributions for med school prerequisites/the lower div science courses you will take (bio 93-99, chem 1a-c,51a-51c, physics 7a-7c) at zotcurve.github.io. This website is official grade data from the registrar and will give you a better answer than any of us could.

If you could find a similar tool for SLO courses and compare their grades to UCIs that would be ideal."

UCI,foplbdu,t3_g8thqv,1587964562.0,"Looks good. You can also knock out GEs through community college online classes over the summer (i recommend coastline community college, usually pretty chill workloads and good online class selections)"
UCI,fonuldn,t1_foncbog,1587926765.0,"I agree, the friend I'm referencing who had to do QA is actually at Edwards as a full time engineer now. However they were the one who told me traditional engineering degrees + specializing in bme is the safer choice right now."
UCI,folgklb,t3_g83ssh,1587861770.0,"A B.S in EE + electives in bme beat a B.S in BME every time, especially since UCI's  biomedical engineering pre-med track track is not ABET accredited.

I have regents and the scholarship is pretty small tbh. Priority registration is nice; however being able to register for classes first isn't as beneficial as you think because the class sizes are so big you'll often end up with the same professors people with non-priority registration get.

Having done my undergrad at schools of varying prestige (CSU, then CC, then UCI), based on my experience your GPA at UCLA would be **slightly** (around like.1-.2) lower than what it would be here, but shouldn't a big enough difference to take into account your decision making.

I would choose UCLA mainly due to the fact you got in for EE which as any biomedical engineering graduate will tell you will make your job search easier. You could also likely change major at UCLA to bioengineering. As someone who was planning to transfer to UCI for bme and changed his mind, I'm glad I did...My BME major friends from good schools like USC had to do quality assurance roles immediately after undergrad because that's what the degree qualified them for (but were able to land engineering roles after accumulating work experience). Would definitely recommend Electrical or Mechanical engineering with bio electives over a B.S in bme.

My personal opinion as a commuter is that living on campus is worth it. If you were going to UCLA to study a degree that didn't have high earning potential after graduation, I would be more skeptical to recommend going into debt.  Your social life will definitely be better living on campus rather than commuting, holding all other things equal.

Let me know if you have any questions about regents or anything else."

UCI,foeltg5,t1_fo21qgv,1587707263.0,"Haha thanks professor zinger! Unfortunately I never got a chance to take any of your classes as a data science major, but have heard great things about them. Hope all is going well with online courses this quarter."
premed,foel6q7,t1_foekz22,1587706744.0,thanks for the advice! even though my gpa is fine do you think I should do something to compensate for CC prereqs or am I worrying too much about them?
cscareerquestions,fo96r3f,t1_fo91k7f,1587611843.0,"> What, to your mind, is the pedagogical advantage of being told you have an error at compile-time, rather than at the time the error is written? 

How my professor put it was no pain, no gain. Basically the pain of debugging errors that would've not occurred had I been using XCode forced me to remember what not to do while developing programs in C++.

> it doesn't take long before an IDE becomes a useful tool to save a shitload of time when debugging, if nothing else. 

I agree 100%. I use an IDE at my work."
cscareerquestions,fo8w4ld,t3_g6bpts,1587605082.0,"Sounds like my old Data Structures professor who told us that if you code on an IDE, you're not learning. Was a big advocate of using only vim.

Our professors both have a point. If you let your IDE catch errors for you before compiling, that deprives you the experience of debugging why your code doesn't work/compile and therefore in an environment without an IDE you might not know why your code isn't working.

I'm not saying switch to vim...but maybe vscode."
UCI,fo8ajbt,t3_g69y0h,1587592893.0,"Both are good schools. The quality of education among the UCs is pretty much the same all around, and I know people from both UCR and UCSC who work at great places and go to great grad schools after graduation. There is not much of a reputation difference between the two as there is between UCI and UCLA for example.

I would probably choose UCSC because of its closer proximity to the bay area. I've also heard the campus is a very cool and unique experience."
UCI,fo57vlx,t3_g59vvv,1587519423.0,"I'm someone who also chose UCI over Berkeley (Econ Major there vs. Data Science here.) For Data Science, there's definitely a good chance that Berkeley is the better choice. Recruiting is better there since it's a better known school with a location closer to the Valley. Our Data Science curriculum is good but i'm sure theirs is strong as well. Quality of teaching is probably the same a both but they definitely have a higher academic reputation."
UCI,fo0fnjs,t3_g4njb1,1587412271.0,"I get that people are being PC and don't want to name a specific major, however that's because unless you are a robot who has no interests whatsoever it's a bad idea to tell you X major is the best choice for you. 

You'll have an easier time studying a more rigorous major you like than studying a less intense major you don't care about or hate. That being said, some examples of majors that have less intense courses and higher grade distributions:

* Majors that include Asian/African/Urban/X Studies
* Majors within the School of Social Ecology
* Anthropology, Sociology, Communications

You should do your due diligence by listing majors you would enjoy studying, and then choose the ones with the least course requirements/most generous grade distributions by consulting data from https://zotcurve.github.io/."
UCI,fnwk6vo,t3_g41s4j,1587319948.0,"Quant econ takes a different year of intermediate microeconomics/macroeconomics that is more mathematical, they also take a different econometrics series that is more math intensive than the regular econometrics series. You should be able to switch in easily as long as you satisfy the change of major requirements for quant econ (google them). Quant econ also has better job prospects in my opinion."
UCI,fnczuo1,t3_g0a7jd,1586853187.0,"It's pretty difficult but it's rewarding. I like the classes.

It will be difficult to transfer into the data science major; it's in the school of computer science and there's a good chance you won't be able to get into the classes needed to change your major . You should take that into account before attending."
UCI,fnavam0,t3_g04v8b,1586804441.0,"If changing into CS doesn't work out, consider:

1) UCI's Second Bacc in Software Engineering or Data Science

2) UCI's Master of Computer Science (not the M.S in CS)

3) Another online CS degree like Georgia Tech's OMSCS


You should be able to complete ICS 6B, 6D, 32, 33, 45C, and Stats 7/67 by the time you graduate next year. That plus the GRE and letters of rec will satisfy the requirements to apply to a good amount of online CS masters programs or UCI's MCS."
UCI,fmyulc7,t3_fy6ugs,1586496229.0,"unfortunately this is a problem not just at UCI, but most major public research universities. UCI is working on it by separating hiring professors on separate teaching tracks/research tracks"
UCI,fmm2s2o,t3_fw3zop,1586197718.0,Computer Science. I got a good job with a Data Science degree but a B.S in CS will make your job search easier.
UCI,fmgfl7r,t3_fv400y,1586047930.0,"The short answer is that if you don't have a very strong preference between the curriculums of the two majors, a Bachelor's Computer in Science will definitely be the better choice in terms of job prospects (not saying Informatics is a useless degree like you're worrying about, CS just gives you more flexibility). 

Consider switching to CS and adding our [Minor in Health Informatics.](http://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofinformatics/#minorstext) You'll still be able to specialize in healthcare while being a CS major."
