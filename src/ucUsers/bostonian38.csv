1) All of them must be tagged with different album names, Spotify recognizes “Unknown Album” as an actual album

2) The names of the MP3 files can’t have apostrophes

3) The sound format has to be 48kHz stereo

4) You need to quit Spotify and reopen for changes to the cover art to update"

Studies have found that, primarily because of these factors, school shutdowns are one of the least effective ways to “flatten the curve.” In fact, shutting down schools likely puts the elderly and sick at greater risk of death because it delays the herd immunity from healthier people necessary to protect them.

> So reopening Purdue could be a way to make it safer

Just stop lol, reopening a university does not make it safer. And relying on fucking *herd immunity* as a defense is pretty counterproductive, since it requires massive amounts of people getting infected, don’t you think? This article just sounds like the author has a massive hard-on for whoever the president of the university is and is just drawing conjecture under the guise of legit sources. “Brilliant business move” etc"
