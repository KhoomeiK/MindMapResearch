ucr,fp37c60,t1_fp36okc,1588274355.0,"I don't have any family members that I know of. It's been my family and me for the past few years. I lived with my aunt during high school in her apartment, but she passed away and I had to go back to my parents house.

The only friends that I have are letting me, but their parents don't want to because of Covid-19 and thats completely understandable as my friends live with their grandmas and grandpas."
