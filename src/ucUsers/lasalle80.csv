UCI,fp31bu9,t3_gb0z9k,1588271402.0,"Yes, as others have said UCI will be distributing funds from the CARES Act to students. The University through the Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships will be dispersing funds to students through direct deposit. To my understanding, the funds dispersed to each student will be measured by their FAFSA and will hopefully be distributed by the end of the quarter."
UCI,fp0tv1g,t1_fp0qyjr,1588216795.0,"Of course, happy to help!

Yeah, thatâ€™s a really great question! During college decision season, I had the choice between choosing my local state university or UCI. I chose UCI because I wanted a fresh start away from the majority of my peers from high school. Essentially, I wanted a clean slate where I can begin a new chapter of my life without any connection to my high school career. Also, with the University of California system having a stronger focus on STEM and with OC/Irvine being a tech hub, it became an obvious choice for me. Iâ€™m also near my family in case anything happens. Iâ€™m grateful that Iâ€™m not too far away from my hometown, but I also have my independence. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
UCI,fp0own0,t3_galvf4,1588213716.0,"It appears that youâ€™re more inclined to enroll at UCSD. Iâ€™d say do what your heart desires. You can also do a Venn diagram with the pros and cons of each institution. You can also flip a coin and designate heads and tails to be one of the two institutions. When flipping the coin, you will probably be subconsciously thinking of the college you want to attend and thatâ€™s where your heart is. I hope this helps!"
UCI,foyl3wx,t3_gabb10,1588174465.0,I would recommend matriculating at your state school. Itâ€™s not worth the out of state tuition and youâ€™re better off graduating college with as little debt as possible.
UCI,foshe60,t3_g98p1f,1588030750.0,Congratulations! Welcome to UCI ðŸ™‚
UCI,for5ulf,t3_g8slgl,1588006684.0,11/10 would pick UCI again. I am so grateful for the connections and memories throughout my time at UCI. I'm honored and humbled by the experienced that I have attained through the different spaces I have been involved in at UCI. I'm thankful for the expansive tech scene and opportunities for growth and development in my field. I look forward to the next challenge in my tenure here at UCI and to seeing all of my friends again.

The general CS major at UCI is open-ended as to my understanding, you can take a variety of courses in that department. You can always take classes in software engineering and use those skills for your job prospects. I hope that is able to clarify things for you, but if not, I'm sure someone who is a CS major can probably elaborate more on this."

It's difficult for non-senior level students to get into these classes. The machine and welding shops were open 9am-5pm during fall and winter quarter of this year.

So rent costs are contingent upon the housing community (ex. Dartmouth vs Stanford), floor plan, and how your potential roommates divide the costs. Factors include utilities and if certain housemates get a parking spot than the other tenants within the same unit."

UCI,fngro4k,t1_fngchy7,1586942428.0,"ASUCI is a student government which represents and is SUPPOSED to advocate for students. As this email clearly demonstrated how Bryce urged UCI engineering undergraduates to vote YES on the new ASUCI Constitution, it is clear he is advocating for this particular political position which violated OIT guidelines that I linked above. 
Feel free to submit a report to student conduct as ZotMail is a UCI campuswide resource and misuse of these resources can result in punitive measures like sanctions, suspension, and expulsion from the University.
Feel free to submit a complaint to the ASUCI Election Commission as it is clear Bryce abused his power and used his position to campaign for Fund the Clubs, knowingly violating the ASUCI Code of Ethics.
Quite frankly, I don't even think he knows what ethics are at this point."

I do have a couple of follow ups:

1. Can you elaborate more on the dead hour for engineering students, as well as the stimulus check?
   1. Specifically with the stimulus check, how much funds will each RCO receive and what is the criteria to receive said stimulus check?
2. You said that you will work with the incoming Dean to see how ASUCI can support engineering students. How will you ensure constant communication and feedback between yourself and your constituents like myself if elected?
3. Can you elaborate more on your qualifications for engineering senator as well as items that would support engineering students in the Advocacy Agenda?

Thank you again! :)"
UCI,fn5l8dn,t3_fzpzv5,1586667928.0,"Hi Julian,

Appreciate your honesty and willingness to connect with the engineering student body.

Third year mechanical engineering year here. Read your campaign statement on the elections website as well as your supplemental info on your Google Doc.

I have a couple of questions:

1. Can you elaborate on what you would do specifically for engineering students?
   1. Your platform focuses a lot on UCI as a whole as well as RCOs (Registered Campus Organizations)
2. Can you elaborate how you plan on working with the incoming Dean of Engineering as Dean Washington is slated to leave July 1st to become the President of George Mason University?
3. Anteaters United is a slate that fervently opposes the 800K allocated to the School of Engineering. As Engineering Senator, how will you will support engineering projects but remained align with the goals of your slate?
4. Given the recent events regarding ASUCI, how will propagate a positive work environment within ASUCI and serve as a role model to your peers in the School of Engineering?

Feel free to reply with any questions you have about these questions.

Thank you and I look forward to your answers to my questions.

Edit: typos (willing -> willingness) and (role -> role model)"

Noise is okay. Walls are decently insulated so it's unlikely you'll hear noise outside your room unless it's really loud. Footstep sounds from the apartment above you can occur.
Internet is okay, I recommend getting a router.
Parking will be better next year as they will open up the roof."
