news,fpdvkx0,t3_gcrh52,1588535110.0,"Let's just allow all churches to hold gatherings while at the same time have all attendees sign a form that they decline healthcare service for anything related to COVID-19. We could be done with evangelical christian catholic evil hypocrisy in the US. They're so desperate for the apocalypse, let them bring it to themselves and well keep sheltering in place.  Any truly religious person will have absolutely no issue staying at home to protect others. Those pushing for their own personal freedom to put others at risk aren't Christians, they're fakes, and that's most of them."

UpliftingNews,fp3x1sy,t3_gav0qc,1588287405.0,If this program was meant to help anyone it wouldn't disqualify so many. It also would provide student loan forgiveness. Feels like a more or less empty gesture.
pcmasterrace,fp3v5x0,t1_fp3ukll,1588286397.0,"I saw while reading around that the motherboard for the Aurora is a microATX.  Even if this is stated, does that not guarantee that it would fit in a microATX case?"
santacruz,fp09imu,t3_gajxcl,1588205018.0,"New restrictions won't mean anything if the police don't actually enforce them.  Guarantee it won't stop people from congregating on the beach, only news will be a small handful of people relative to the large crowds getting ticketed."

santacruz,fokihpl,t1_fokdgla,1587842686.0,This getting downvoted shows how little people care about others. They'd rather think were living in the time of the secret police rather than trying to keep people from dying.
santacruz,foeac4s,t3_g6xgct,1587699262.0,"New Leaf has been making good attempts at social distancing, but every single time i've been in to stock up, there have been customers ignoring the flow arrows on the ground, standing around socializing, not wearing masks, and making no effort to distance themselves from strangers.

If you're not cutting it for pvp, that's why they have pve and unofficial servers.  Either get better or change your game mode."

It happens enough to you, but then you'll eventually learn how to avoid alphas and start doing it to other beach bobs.  It's how you learn and how you teach.  My biggest issue is people complaining about this yet they refuse to stop building on spawn beaches."

He said hes done with the bidding war and hes essentially going to show the buying power of our nation state, then distribute leftover resources to other states. Fuckin boss move."

States like Washington are then getting a fraction of the supplies requested whereas he then gave Florida all they asked for within 3 days. Hes literally attempting to place priority for supplies on states where his supporters are at greatest risk. He is only thinking of his re election.
