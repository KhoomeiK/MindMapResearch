I recently was going to use my free reward at Chipotle for some chips and guacamole but their scanner was not working, fortunately I was wearing my scrubs and the manager was nice enough to waive the fee since they were unable to scan my code. Definitely made my day. Thank you to all of you that continue to work through these difficult times."
