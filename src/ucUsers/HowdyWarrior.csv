aggies,fpilheu,t1_fpikfce,1588643386.0,You guys really that beta you have to pay women for sexual favors. Degenerates. Strip clubs are disgusting. Men profiting off of women selling their bodies and objectifying themselves. Women loosing self-worth. Guys slaving away to sexual urges. Have you no self control. Have you no decency.

Sorry bro but cool cars, drinking, money, casual sex, cool restaurants & clubs and a beach vacation is not living. Its a distraction from what is good. And if your the latter, dedicating your whole life to science is not fulling either."

berkeley,fp6jokm,t3_g8an1k,1588353493.0,"Most guys in EECS are beta males. There whole lives are spent working on with computers, watching anime, and playing video games. They eat unhealthy. They spend their free time watching pornography. They dont workout. Zero spirituality. No worthwhile purpose in life. Im not being rude (this used to be me) and as much as yall don’t wanna admit it, its the truth. My advice is find a guy you like and want to marry. You should support each other and you shouldn’t really need anyone else. Unless you find another couple and become friends with them. Dont stay single and end up either a) being a sugar mama or b) beint a cat lady. You only have your youth for so long. Get married. Have kids. Build a family. Trust me I know this sounds weird. If someone were to say this to me 7 years ago I would have laughed in their face. (Same advice for you guys also)"

aggies,foermjy,t1_foea889,1587712402.0,"But the thing is we already do put a price on human life.  Let me explain. Using logic if we made the speed limit 20 miles per hour or banned cars all out, we would save  thousands of lives a year from car crashes. We dont do this because we understand the economic benefit of cars is worth more than 40k lives a year. Its sad but true. This is exactly the same situation we are in with corona, but with the stakes higher."

aggies,fo4saq1,t1_fo4761w,1587510249.0,"Why would you pick mechanical over computer science as a major? Im debating between electrical with comp sci minor vs computer engineering vs comp sci with a minor in cyber security, but I had never thought of doing mechanical with comp sci. Is they're a reason you recommend this. Also I'm taking an algorithm and data structures class online at code academy, but its in python. Should I be learning data structures and algorithms in c++ or is python ok cuz it's easy to translate."

aggies,fnlp12r,t3_g2iz90,1587057270.0,"Counselors are lazy or busy / “sorry we are closed”. Email your principal from your mom or dads email. Say its urgent. Works every time. That doesn’t work, email your superintendent, tell them your school is preventing you from registration."
EngineeringStudents,fng7hgi,t3_g1jvw0,1586924212.0,Penn State will be a breeze for you. All engineering schools are ABET accredited that means there all going to be about the same rigor. The only place your going to find hard engineering classes are are top 15 schools. I got into to a top 20 engineering school and the highest math I took in hs was algebra 2. I have been successful maintaining a 3.75 gpa and I have a good 6hrs of free time everyday. If it weren’t for clubs and extracurriculars.
