neoliberal,fpdefg4,t3_gcpxhx,1588525372.0,"Look, I’m going to vote for Biden in the fall. With that said, his Senate records are still under seal, which means some relevant documents either in this case or another might not be found through a search in the National Archives. 

Not that it matters, because it entirely possible that even if this occurred, no records of it were produced. This is a difficult aspect about these allegations, and I don’t think there is a clear cut way of approaching this."

AskAnAmerican,fojwjre,t3_g7rggm,1587830846.0,"I agree with another comment. Ultimately, you define your identity. It is not unusual for there to be distinct ethnicities or even nationalities within the same country. From what I understand, there are different regions within China that have different languages and cultures. To an extent, those regional identities can assume a lot of the characteristics that nationalities have. 
For example, in the UK, you have Scottish, Welsh, Irish, and English people. They all have distinct cultures and technically are distinct nationalities but reside within the same country. 
Alternatively, you can have a situation like in the US and Spain, where there are large segments of the population that have their own distinct culture, language, and geography but do not have legal representation in the form of a semi-autonomous political body. 
What I’m getting at is identity is complicated, but I think that people within a given group should define themselves."
