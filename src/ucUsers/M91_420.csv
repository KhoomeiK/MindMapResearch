UCSC,fouz4xu,t1_fos8q9i,1588092761.0,"I don't think the autoworkers union gives a fuck. There is nothing on their site about the UC cola movement - not a whisper and they have declined to comment in any way after I reached out with questions about their stance in the matter. From what I gather the UC students have some minority representatives within the union, and that's about it as far as allies extend within UAW.  

Had these pseudo-revolutionaries spent the year lobbying and gaining support they would be in a much more secure position to escalate within their union. instead they ostracized themselves, and intentionally. The strategic shortsightedness is laughable IMO.  

As far as ULP is concerned there are some legitimate grievances to be had as BSOE PHD students are paid fulltime(40h) while humanities is paid at (20h) but the way this was explained to me by people within econ/engineering department is opportunity cost: these  say feminist studies phd students have shall-we-say limited alternative prospects while a phd in say Computer engineering could be making 200k in silicon valley so the school needs to up the incentive to retain talent - I haven't verified any of this paragraph, it was told to me directly by UC staff 

..I am curious of your perspective on the last paragraph as you may be uniquely attuned as a BSOE phd . ty"
