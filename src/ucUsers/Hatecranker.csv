The fact the question is impossible to solve normally isn't fair, I think it'll encourage people to look for solutions when they run in circles unable to solve. My preferred method would be to have the question be solvable but difficult, and uniquely worded. The solution you put on Chegg would have to be fundamentally wrong in ways that would be impossible unless you looked it up. When my students cheated they were always so lazy as to copy solutions directly so it wasn't hard catching them."
