Heavymind,fp84zqf,t3_gbrgco,1588383655.0,Reminds me of Klimt
AskReddit,fp0fo3k,t1_fozoa8z,1588208346.0,I always hesitate to tell people how deeply Mirror affected me.
oakland,fox1woc,t1_fowzqb5,1588132126.0,"Yeah, it has always been a hotspot. Good idea parking on the uphill."
oakland,fow9tf3,t3_g9unw7,1588115680.0,"Been happening on Joaquin Miller too, next to the park. I see multiple piles of new glass every day for the last 2 weeks."
bayarea,fotr0vl,t1_fotm3x8,1588063056.0,"Such a weird mix of people. Meth heads, homeless people, pot growers, retired folk, Bay Area tourists, plus all the gay culture in G-ville. West county is one of the strangest mixes of peoples and cultures I have ever experienced."
berkeley,fot2slq,t1_fosgdwy,1588043372.0,"I disagree with the person you are responding to. Almost all of your points are universally true, except for the personal preference ones like correcting in colored pen. Despite what individuals say about “how they learn best”, nearly all humans learn the same way. Most of the points you’ve written are the most efficient way to learn at a collegiate level. Looking back on my Cal career, I learned a great deal but missed out on the majority of what was presented to me because I didn’t follow most of these ideals."
berkeley,fot27gq,t3_g9avi4,1588043000.0,"These are absolutely true. Unfortunately, I didn’t figure out most of these points until after I graduated :("
Shitty_Car_Mods,foponu5,t1_fopomde,1587967320.0,Yeah the foothills are a great place to visit. Not so much to live.
Shitty_Car_Mods,fopmf1a,t3_g8prb9,1587965456.0,Good lord that town is a shithole. They call it “Hang Town” because that’s where all the hangings in the area occurred.
berkeley,foo7o79,t1_foo7fz0,1587934101.0,Fair enough but pay attention to the EE stuff at the end of 61C. If it piques your interest think more about taking an EE elective or 2.
berkeley,fonxtpw,t3_g8an1k,1587928593.0,"I’ve been in industry for years now. CS sucks for women, not much you can do about it. EE is much more accepting. Still not perfect, but light years better than CS. Have you thought about taking more EE classes to see if you like the EE track? Have you taken CS61C yet? I took it with Garcia (his hair wasn’t gray yet!). If they still cover some EE stuff like they did when I took it, see if it interests you then take a look at EE130 and/or EE105."
urbanexploration,fo9frvf,t3_g610u1,1587618302.0,"Gary, IN. What a sad sad slice of America."

berkeley,fnwf3ia,t3_g4aj1n,1587317178.0,Not at all. North side is dope. Who says shit like that?
oakland,fnv14j3,t3_g42grl,1587276875.0,What is the significance of this? Why do I see “100% JUICE” tagged all over the Fruitvale?
skeptic,fnq2jgf,t3_g385yi,1587156461.0,Yes
gamedesign,fnkcvxl,t3_g26ey1,1587022402.0,"Gemcraft, Dungeon Warfare 1 & 2, and Mindustry! Check them out. All a bit different from each other."

jambands,fn7ah25,t3_fzorxd,1586716474.0,Great story! When was this?

berkeley,fmk1wla,t3_fvqm1t,1586142574.0,No it is not as cut throat as people say. I chose it because I’m from Berkeley/Oakland and both my parents went to Cal. I never really imagined myself going anywhere else.
