PoliticalCompassMemes,fpljrt2,t1_fpl8hdr,1588713966.0,But the states he won he won because the liberal vote was divided and he has the most votes. With out the fptp he probably would have done worse.

ApplyingToCollege,fp4mkm7,t1_fp4m0m1,1588302347.0,Interesting. I’ve heard it’s mostly to move into management
ApplyingToCollege,fp4erfd,t1_fp4d1co,1588297484.0,I think it does make a big difference. If you’re goal is MBA getting a good prestigious job in which going to a target school is important. If you want to do any other research based grad program like a PhD you need the resources offered at a top research university. A lot of schools have zero opportunities for undergrad research.
ApplyingToCollege,fp4b7bt,t1_fp3a1d6,1588295374.0,Getting into a tops grab school is incredibly hard and the school you went to undergrad makes a big difference.
berkeley,fp3ipe7,t3_gb3s4w,1588279990.0,I think you should be fine. Did you to to a California community college? I think 5 years is more than enough for legal residency. You can go fill out the form right now if you wanted.
berkeley,fp06lg5,t1_fp05w3o,1588203448.0,"I don’t think environmental Econ or poly Econ limits your outlook much as long as you still take the math courses. Those math courses are the main difference between normal Econ and EEP and the primary difference in job opportunities.

Maybe consider a minor in stats or something similar. Econ majors are valuable in the job market because of the analysis skills. As long as you learn stata and r before you graduate you’ll be in a good spot when it comes to jobs."
berkeley,fp0632d,t1_fp04gax,1588203177.0,"They will look at your actual classes and even the grades you get in those classes. An MBA is kinda weird as most of the time you want to work for a few years before pursuing it. In that time most Econ students pursue roles in analytics and other roles that do require to math chops. These courses will also help if you want to go into finance or any other roles. 

The thing that makes Econ majors so valuable is the math chops even in the world of environmental Econ. 

Maybe if you wanted to do something like accounting or consulting it might matter a little less."
berkeley,foztd42,t3_gaftey,1588196517.0,"First off from what I’ve seen UCB is regarded better when it comes to Econ and that does come through when you’re looking for a job. That being said there are some big differences between Econ and environmental Econ and poly Econ for that matter. The biggest being the amount of math and other quantitative classes you take. Most of the job prospects for Econ majors are mostly due to these classes and they are not a part of environmental Econ. You can patch this by taking those classes anyway and that will really even things out and make you’re degree relatively equivalent to a normal Econ degree.

Both will be good options so I’d probably focus on picking the school not the program."
berkeley,fozrjg8,t1_fozdk2v,1588195613.0,"I really dont think this is true. You need to declare in your first semester and you need to take Econ and stats which are generally reserved for Econ transfers. 

Econ being caped means you can’t declare unless you’re an Econ transfer. You can do poly Econ or sociology but not Econ. Also isn’t admissions to the Econ department more competitive? Like average gpa and what not?

I could be wrong about all this so please correct me if so."
CapitalismVSocialism,fox7xv7,t1_fow6hu8,1588136321.0,Man lot of y’all really missed all of Marxist Leninism. Socialism do want need to be democratic at all and for most of the past 100 years the opposite has been a given.

CapitalismVSocialism,fonwsij,t1_fons7x9,1587928011.0,"Dude. You clearly have no understanding of socialist thought. Marxist-Leninism is the primary from of socialism outside of online leftist circle jerks. 

In ML the means of production are controlled by the dictator ship of the proletariat or in the case of the ussr the communist party. The party represents the interests of the workers but Lenin and Stalin did not vibe with democracy at all. This is the primary and most legitimate form of socialism ever practiced.

Just read literary anything they wrote or even a wiki page. The ussr is considered by all, including themselves to be socialist."
berkeley,fom7ryo,t1_fom46of,1587880823.0,Ok that’s great. Really considering it.
berkeley,fom37rg,t1_fom1u07,1587877074.0,Oh yea I saw that. So you think that applies to transfer students or just people at Berkeley? The cite still says I need to get a 3.0 or better for admissions and that class stresses me out.
berkeley,fom0xa9,t1_fom0jhk,1587875334.0,That’s great to know. Weirdly can’t find that info anywhere.
CapitalismVSocialism,folrgkc,t1_folr5t3,1587868741.0,"Lmao dude just read anything after Marx. ML is very explicitly socialist political ideology. If the ussr and other ml states aren’t socialist what is exactly?

Also I’m gonna define capitalism as a stateless society where no one has any say over how I use my property and there are no taxes. America isn’t capitalist it’s state socialism. See how unhelpful that is?"
CapitalismVSocialism,folqvk7,t1_folqrs1,1587868354.0,"Ok lots of people think they are communist because that word changed meanings.

So they are socialist? That work?"
CapitalismVSocialism,folqf6o,t1_folphav,1587868049.0,"You’re using you’re own very limited definitions here. Different groups have very different ideas about how to get those things. Marxist-Leninism has been the primary from of socialism and the ussr and other ML states are widely considered to be socialist. They call themselves socialist, everyone else calls them socialist. You can call them what ever you want but you’re not going to have any productive conversations if you keep using it the way you currently are. 

This is like when an ancap does not accept that America is nominal capitalist.

Definitions such as these are so theoretical and abstract that they will never have any political power and no real way to critique or talk about them at all. They just aren’t actionable"
berkeley,follj19,t3_g80swn,1587864847.0,Yea I’m super curious. I wrestled in high school and I really miss the mat time. Maybe reach out the the club. I know there is a 10th planet in Berkeley that sounds fun though. Also like the other guy said maybe the judo club. Honestly most gyms are way way to expensive for me so I kinda need it to be with the school.
CapitalismVSocialism,folb7cj,t1_fol9ofz,1587858552.0,"Yea maybe just read more. The super old school definition of communism as the end goal stateless society isn’t very common. But even then socialist states is basically any state that is attempting to achieve that end goal. That includes lot of different ideologies. Including revolutionary mls and old school Social Democrats. But they are all socialists and the ussr working towards that goal is generally considered socialist by themselves and those talking about them. Socialism does not just include modern progressive democratic socialism, in fact this understanding of socialism is historically and globally inconsistent."
CapitalismVSocialism,fol5bl2,t1_fol214j,1587855180.0,"As far as I’m aware hitler never called himself a socialist. The nazi part had socialist in its name because it had a large socialist wing before the night of long knives. 

I think you are going to have a very hard time discussing these topics if you don’t open up a little. I also think I would be worth noting that while the ussr was still kicking ML was basically the mainstream in socialist thought. It was considered to be the only viable method and has occupied the vast majority of the conversation for the last 100 years."
CapitalismVSocialism,fokw5kz,t1_fokvpv4,1587850092.0,I dont know man. They called themselves socialist. Everyone else called them socialist or communist. Also despite how the internet operates now ML was the primary school of though for socialists for a very very long time. Socialism is a big tent and most people would put ML states in that tent in the same way people put America or other counties in the capitalist tent. It would be pretty annoying arguing with one of those “it’s not real capitalism as long as there’s a state” people right?
CapitalismVSocialism,fokt8y9,t1_fokoz1w,1587848509.0,So what do you consider them? If not socialist
CapitalismVSocialism,foko11w,t1_foknh6z,1587845677.0,Then you need to broaden you’re definition. I think it would be hard not to call Marxist Leninist stats not socialist no matter what definition you use.
CapitalismVSocialism,foknrwg,t1_fokn76e,1587845539.0,Yea I completely agree that modern China fits under the definition of state capitalism. That being said state capitalism is a pretty misleading term. Like calling social democrats fascist or something. In reality state capitalism has far more similarities with a Marxist Leninist state than anything else.
CapitalismVSocialism,fokj6tm,t1_fokh6dh,1587843057.0,"Dude you’re just wrong the ussr is explicitly a communist state. Just look at the wiki page for communist state really simple. They also consistently called themselfs communist and socialist.

Communism is a wide umbrella and includes states working towards the end goal of you’re definition of communism. ML states are usually referred to communist state but if you’re insistent on using definitions that were irrelevant 100 years ago then sure.  Communism is the end goal. Then the ussr and China are socialist states. Happy?"

CapitalismVSocialism,fokedh5,t1_fokbe4m,1587840512.0,China has no democracy. Kinda like most other communist states.
CapitalismVSocialism,foke9wg,t1_fokds9d,1587840457.0,China hardly has private property. Is it really private if the state has total control of what you do with it and can take it at anytime for any reason?
CapitalismVSocialism,foke3lo,t1_fokd0tz,1587840366.0,Lol ok. So how is that going to come about? You are not going to have any meaningful conversations with anyone if you don’t broaden you definition to Marxist-Leninism. Which is historical what communism meant for a long long time. These states are very much communist. And if you choose to hold that definition it could you point to a single state that fits you’re definition?
CapitalismVSocialism,fok63lh,t1_fojv4ak,1587836081.0,So no democracy?
CapitalismVSocialism,fok613k,t1_foj4zo1,1587836048.0,"Fascism has no real consistent economic policy’s thought making it very hard to compare.

CapitalismVSocialism,fok5fmh,t1_foj4fzj,1587835734.0,"Op explicitly said China could not be communist because it is auth which is clearly ridiculous and leaves a stupid and unrealistic.

On his broader claim that China is not communist my point is that while China has some elements of capitalism does not make it capitalism in the same way that America having welfare does not make it communist. Clearly there is some wiggle room in our definitions and it’s not as Black and white as cap vs com and more of a sliding scale in which China is still very far form capitalism."

CapitalismVSocialism,foj40jd,t1_foiy4hi,1587807487.0,So communist states can be authoritarian?
CapitalismVSocialism,foj3xwj,t1_foj3pch,1587807407.0,They still have extreme state control and ownership. Also workplace democracy does in no way relate to an actual communist state by the same metric the ussr wouldn’t be communist either. Venezuela also technically has private property. But if the state is telling you exactly how much to grow what you’re going to grow and how much your going to sell for you don’t own that property.
CapitalismVSocialism,foj3pbl,t1_foj38q0,1587807135.0,"Ok but like seriously? Lenin Stalin mao, Castro? Basically every socialist state and the main stream of communist thought has been focused around Marxist-Leninism which is very very auth."

I’m also an Econ transfer and white not stated on the admission letter being admitted as an Econ major is completely different. In order to declare Econ you must be an Econ transfer I’d refer you too the ucb Econ site. In the first semester you must declare as well as pass 100a or 100b and stats with a 2.7 or higher. If you do not meet these requirement you will not be admired into the Econ program and will have to declare a non caped major such as environmental Econ or poly Econ.

Also you get admissions to both of the above classes."

ApplyingToCollege,fo90cwd,t1_fo33zth,1587607706.0,It’s just policy. When you transfer you need the major prerequisites to take upper div classes so they want you to be ready to take those classes as soon as you get there. Maybe you can appeal with corona and take it over the summer.  Else maybe work another year and transfer next year or do a spring transfer.

New companies innovate like sears did with the sears catalog and now 100 years latter we have amazon which can bring a package to you in a day.  

Companies that last such as coke tend to have a very strong consumer base that lives there product and exist in an environment with high barriers to entry.

When looking at monopolies they only really become a problem when they start abusing their monopoly power. If coke started charging too much it wouldn’t be a problem. If the only utility company you could use starts then you have a problem, that’s a real monopoly"

MMA,fo04swy,t1_fnywvvf,1587406082.0,The thing about khabib is that he is a master at controlling your limbs while he’s grinding you. He traps your legs with his legs and then your arms and then starts punching. That’s why no one can submit him. Also his head movement and striking don’t look good but the awkwardness makes it unpredictable and it’s hard to land a clean shot. If Connor and Barboza could finish him with strikes I don’t think tony could in the same way.
MMA,fo04eb7,t1_fnytzka,1587405880.0,You could definitely see the beginnings of some thing in the Connor fight. I think if Connor had been more on his game and had better cardio he could have won in that round but then khabib landed that massive overhand right. I think tony could do the same.
MMA,fnyi8xy,t1_fny96qy,1587363903.0,Honestly khabibs strategy is amazing but it is very cardio intensive and I really think after 3 rounds tony could start putting combos together and getting a tko could work.
