I do not see how you spamming a link on a ‚Äúmegathread‚Äù you made in literally almost every single thread about the CARES act promotes a discussion on what you think you want to discuss. This basically means you just want some internet clout because you are bored. However, your thread was not gaining enough traction, because it got lost in the shuffle of all the other threads posting the email screenshot. Because of this, you decided to spam the link everywhere. Sorry for calling you out like this, but it is what it is. 

Also, I suggest next time you want to make a ‚Äúmegathread,‚Äù you should really understand what that term means. A megathread is created for the sole purpose of conveying massive amounts of information scattered across multiple threads in one neat and organized thread for everyone to view and discuss with no headache. A lot of people are currently confused as to why they received the amount of money that they did, and all the information explaining why is in many different threads. I do not see anything in your thread that attempts to convey this information to people who genuinely want to know and find out why they received the amount of money that they did. 

If you wanted a place to have a big discussion about this in one thread only, I might suggest using ‚Äúmega discussion thread‚Äù instead, that way it will not mislead users into thinking they will get some information out of it. 

Thanks for reading and have a nice day :)"

ucr,fo0ynp3,t3_g4y90i,1587422275.0,"I'm with you, it's been really hard for me to get work done at home with my family. They've been really supportive and accommodating for my schedule/workload and I'm really really grateful and appreciative of that, but I feel like it's not enough. I don't know why but I'm not performing at my best like I used to, I feel anxious and nervous at home and it's been affecting the way I do work and it's piling up now with midterms coming up. I really want to go back to my apartment in Riverside, but my fam says not until the shelter-in-place is lifted. I really hope they don't extend it because I can't get anything done here :("
ucr,fnmah8c,t3_g28xje,1587067929.0,"Honestly, there's no real way of telling at this point. Only time will tell.

California was the first to implement shelter-in-place and our curve has been flattening well before various models have predicted otherwise. However, we also have to consider the rest of the nation (since state-to-state travel is still not restricted/banned), the limited amount of testing that is being performed, and the fear of re-opening the economy too soon which will increase the amount of infections. 

So, (I think) there's three possible outcomes that we can think of:

- If we all do our part and continue to practice social distancing, and there is no vaccine available to the public by then, then yes it's realistic to assume that Fall classes will be in person. At how much capacity though is a different question entirely. It won't be completely back to normal, there is going to be a sense of a ""new normal"" by that time. So required masks, hand sanitizer stations, limited social gatherings with limited amount of people, etc.

- If a public and thoroughly-tested vaccine is available to the public (while also practicing social distancing), then it's also realistic to assume Fall classes will be in-person and life in general can gradually return to the ""normal"" that we all know, with some adjustments of course to prevent another pandemic like this from happening again. 

- If we just say fuck it and don't practice social distancing as much as we are at the moment, and there is no vaccine available to the public by then, then it's realistic to assume that Fall will also be online. A lot of people are on edge rn and find it hard to stay home and/or work from home, especially those who love going out and socializing.

I completely understand where you are coming from though. I'm at home rn with family and it's been really hard for me to stay productive. I'm not performing at my best like previous quarters and it's really discouraging to me. Plus it's not just you and I, a lot of us here are also feeling the same way. The best thing for us to do is to just stay optimistic, practice social distancing, and hope that this will all blow over soon. Also put our trust in our state governments, because our federal government is not handling this the way they should of.

Hope you're doing well OP, good luck with everything and stay safe :)"
