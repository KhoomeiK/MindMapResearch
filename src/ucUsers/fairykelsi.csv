college,fpitill,t1_fpifxk5,1588648368.0,I definetly will try to! Thanks for the advice! I'm glad your experience at UCSD seems to be better than mine :)
college,fphppql,t1_fphoy9q,1588625539.0,"If I need any credits for transferring, yes. As for the major I'm looking into as a transfer for Pratt, it seems they do not require GEs that are not related to art. I'm still researching on what exactly I need."
college,fphnqkh,t1_fphk60f,1588624517.0,"not sure what you mean? i don't go to a community college. 

i'm about to finish two years at UCSD"
UCSD,fos3iti,t1_fos14me,1588023313.0,"There is!! It’s the LGBTQ Living learning community. I’d definitely apply to it if you end up going here! Im trying to get in for this next school year (if we’re even on campus) since it can be hard to find LGBT friends. We do have an LGBT resource center on campus where you can hang out and attend lgbt events, but it can be overwhelming"
UCSD,fo05dty,t3_g4oy3q,1587406374.0,"bro me too :( i have bills to pay (not housing obv but phone, medication, etc) and am on the verge of over drafting my account lol i really need my refund"
UCSD,fnxim9p,t3_g45l73,1587339400.0,"I usually work in Price Center as a busser (aka just cleaning tables and taking out the trash) and we are lucky enough to still be getting paid! We just do our normal hours that we worked and do online training instead. 

I'm a student, so I don't know how it is for the nonstudent workers. Lots of my coworkers are not students and I'm super worried and hope they are getting paid :("
UCSD,fn5pa9e,t3_fzqi0x,1586671372.0,"Our student population here is mainly south asian/east asian, with the second most probably being white. There's not a big amount of black students here, but I know there is an African Black Diaspora Living-Learning Community (ABD LLC), AKA a dorm housing community for black students to feel at home among other black students.

I'm not black (I'm LGBT and attended a general LLC meeting to join the LGBT housing) and I know the ABDLLC doesn't have much applicants so you'd definitely be accepted. I can't speak on the black experience at UCSD but I just wanted to let you know about the housing community since it could definitely make an impact on you feeling at home/in a supportive community! I'm so sorry you had a terrible experience in high school, and I hope you can feel at home at UCSD."
UCSD,fn5m9vc,t1_fn5m68z,1586668788.0,i followed you! my name on there is the same as my user on here :)
UCSD,fn5m4e9,t1_fn5ic89,1586668659.0,well if campus opens up in fall we should totally skate together!! maybe we can get a group of beginner girls together so we can all learn!
UCSD,fn5gytu,t3_fzljj6,1586664598.0,"I was in the process of learning before I had to move out because of the virus :( When you do actually head to campus when all this is over, I'd really recommend riding around during 7-9pm when there's rarely anybody on campus so you can get a feel for good spots and stuff to watch out for. 

Since I moved out, I wasn't at the point of being comfortable riding during the day to classes and such, since it's kinda hard during peak hours with crowds, plus all the hills. The most important thing to learn is to brake! I had just learned how to brake about two weeks into riding with one foot sliding on the ground - it's sooo helpful since it allows you to control your speed!

I'd also recommend finding friends to skate around with! I haven't found any yet (I'd love to skate with you if campus opens back up in the fall haha) but I imagine it'd make learning a lot less scary and more fun. It's really intimidating all alone (esp for me as a girl I feel like everyone's unfairly judging me lmao)"
UCSD,fmm3o7x,t1_fmlxyir,1586198193.0,i still have stuff i need to pay for lmao and food to buy
