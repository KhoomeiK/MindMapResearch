ucla,fn2409i,t1_fmyktmg,1586577249.0,Ummmm Cal’s ASUC’s club budget is <$2million while ours is $60mil. Their clubs are still very accomplished
CollegeVsCollege,fmybvcn,t1_fmyae72,1586482576.0,Yea! Just wanted to point out that you might regret more by going to ucla since if you are unhappy here then you have nothing. If you end up unhappy at berkeley then oh well at least you went to *the* best chemistry school. Also chem in general is really hard imo at every university. Stem is mostly standarized anyways

CollegeVsCollege,fmxliee,t3_fy0g8l,1586467234.0,"I vote Berkeley hands down. Berkeley’s chem program is among the best if not *the* best in the world. They discovered more periodic elements than most first world countries

Also just a heads up for when you think Ucla is more fun. Ucla is also very competitive and cutthroat, probably more or less the same at both schools tbh. Most students are very lax at both Berkeley and Ucla though, so don’t automatically assume Berkeley = sad and Ucla = fun. Ucla is fun and can be fun, but so is Berkeley, and you will run into cutthroat people at both schools at more or less the same rate

I’ve heard from my friends at Berkeley and they have a great social life, and I feel like a lot of my friends aren’t having that much fun but are saying they are if u know what I mean. Honestly speaking I don’t think you should turn down Berkeley chem when given that option especially since both schools’ social lives/cultures are very similar"
