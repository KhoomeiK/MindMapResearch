AskDrugNerds,fpn0g7i,t3_ge7k2s,1588746574.0,"I'm fairly certain in overdose the reason for it's hallucinations is more due to its potential to cause stimulant psychosis.  All stimulants come with the same warning about hallucinations.  Nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, while their activities are related in certain parts of the body and brain, carry somewhat different roles overall.  From what I understand, other nicotinic acetylcholine antagonists generally don't cause delirium.  Instead they frequently cause strong sedation, anxiolysis, and paralysis.  Also it seems muscarinic agonists and antagonists have a much more direct effect on the heart, agonists increasing bp and heart rate, and antagonists doing the very opposite, sometimes to a very dangerous extent which seems to be one of the main dangers with them other than seizure."

Drugs,fpmya5m,t1_fpmns5q,1588744893.0,"You're a truly ridiculous person...  I'M A PROPONENT OF KRATOM TOO!  I SIMPLY SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH KRATOM AND SUBOXONE AND IT SENT YOU INTO A HISSY FIT!

>You replied to zero things in my previous post and just repeated yourself. Taking the max dose of Kratom and comparing your wd to a taper of not the max dose of suboxone is ridiculous. You did not cold turkey subs and therefore you and I both know you have no personal experience with what you claim to talk about. 

I responded well enough to your comment but your clearly struggling with reading.  Probably all that lead in your kratom...  I even gave you my experience quitting another long lasting opioid, but clearly everything I said about that went right over your head.  I know just what it's like.  There is no doubting it's less immediately intense but longer lasting and as a result it does suck more than shorter acting opioids.  But clearly buprenorphine is the only long lasting opioid in your mind.
Now I know for a fact you're completely full of shit because no doctor prescribes more than 16mg of buprenorphine since any sub dose above that doesn't have any effect because buprenorphine saturates opioid receptors at that dose.  32mg is WAY above sub's ceiling dose for any human.  You can cut a 32mg dose to 16mg a day painlessly as result.  I wish I could find the reddit post on either r/suboxone or r/quittingopioids of someone doing just that and saying he felt some mild symptoms like he dropped 1-2mg.  If you were prescribed 32mg and took it for however long you were on Suboxone, you wasted money and got played by your doctor.  And to believe that most people are prescribed 16mg a day is simply not grounded in reality.
Now let's do a little elementary school math here.  1mg of buprenorphine is an equivalent dose to about 60mg of morphine and 40mg of oxycodone, 15-30mg of heroin, 90mg of hydrocodone, 500-700mg of codeine, etc. Heroin always lasted a bit longer for me (usually around 5-7h when I snorted it.  Idk y.  Probably fucky metabolism or it was laced with some rc somehow, but I doubt it), but for most it lasts about 3-4hours.  Dosing 5-6 times a day 15-30mg of heroin is a decent amount, and 1mg of bupe is equivalent to that.  16mg a day is equivalent to much more than a gram of heroin a day which is not necessarily the ""common dose"" you claim it to be lol.  It's no wonder quitting sucked so much for you.  You were doing probably twice the dose you should've or more.  If you don't believe me, try to find how many people in the r/suboxone subreddit say they're prescribed 16mg+, or just do some cursory research on the subject.  And then you talk about how horrible Suboxone is, a medication that has been demonstrated in multiple studies to be incredibly effective at helping people get off opioids when used appropriately.  It's almost like you are accusing me of doing exactly what you did but the other way around...  I shouldn't even have to say any of this.  I've known people in programs who only needed 4mg.  8mg was a ""standard"" dose.  I did personally did 10mg intrabuccal films max.  That was the dose that just got me out of kratom withdrawals.  The first time I dropped my dose, I decided to start with a solid 4mg drop to test the waters.  No, it's not fun.  I'm not calling you a pussy or whatever for thinking suboxone withdrawals are so bad so stop being so hyper defensive.  But it was far better than what I went through with kratom.  I don't think I can stress how much better it was.  I waited a month or so, then dropped 1.5mg, waited a couple weeks then 1mg, etc.  All of it reminded me of quitting Lexapro: pretty painless ime.

>I understand that you found it easier to taper subs then Kratom which was your doc at the time but that DOES NOT MAKE THE WITHDRAWAL EASIER OR MAKE SUBOXONE LESS ADDICTING. 

Well then, you clearly dont get just why kratom was so much more difficult to taper off then, other than how difficult it was to schedule dose.  It was so difficult because if I did a fraction of the dose reduction I did on Suboxone with kratom it was a much more painful hell to experience, and the depression lasted a solid month and made Suboxone wd from the larger dose reduction described above look puny.

>Besides the fact that 99% of Kratom users use less then a qp a day and about half of sub users are on 16-32mg and your post makes less sense because even if it was true for you , for 99% of people it wouldn’t be and going online and claiming it would be would be a danger to public health

What is even the purpose of this? You're simply making your uneducated guess on how much kratom addicted people take to try to show how ridiculous my dosing regime is to you, which is stupid.  Then you go ahead and say I'm calling it a danger to public health when I'm calling it what it is: addictive and dependence forming in a fashion similar to other opioids.  There is simply no doubt about it.  I just gave my experience and it sparked some massive insecurity about your experience quitting a massive dose of Suboxone cold turkey.
I'm seriously done with this discussion.  I have been called out such a ridiculous amount of times for having simply experienced what I experienced with kratom and it's such a stupid thing to have to go through.  I get played into thinking I can use kratom as I have used other opioids and not get such a severe dependence, and then I get called tf out by the same people who got me here.  But I would much rather people understand very real risks with kratom, which like any other drug, is not perfect.  I don't get why advocates don't see that as fair."
Drugs,fpm5p4u,t1_fplyurp,1588726095.0,"Yeah I ultimately tried to taper but failed pretty bad.  It simply wasn't working out because my emotions were out of control and keeping track of my doses was simply something I didn't feel I had time for.  I tried quitting cold turkey as well and failed catastrophically.  Ultimately I found it more difficult to quit than any other opioid I tried quitting including a long lasting one I quit cold turkey (loperamide with Omeprazole) and I tried switching to suboxone which actually worked out perfectly for me.  Tapering off of it resulted in less mood swings, I was more functional, and I only had to dose once a day so I never accidentally dosed extra times.  Apparently a lot of people disagree with me in reddit comments regarding Suboxone, but everyone I spoke to directly either through reddit or in person seemed to be a fan of it when it comes to using it to taper, so I'm very confused about the hate.  Regarding what you were saying about your friends and their withdrawals, I know I had a friend who quit a powerful RC stimulant drug called 4-methylaminorex after pretty persistent abuse and said it sucked, but he claimed it was not nearly as bad as nic.  He smoked a few cigarettes (just a fraction of a pack) a day for a while and he claimed that stimulant wd didn't even come close to his nic wd experience.  He wasn't using small quantities of that drug either.  My experience with these different classes of drugs was the complete opposite, and while I smoked a little less, I also abused ""less recreational"" stimulants (amphetamine and Ritalin mainly).  So not only are some people simply more prone to getting bad wd in general but within various drug classes the relative intensity can vary.  You can imagine with a drug like kratom that behaves in so many different ways and has so many different mechanisms that it's gonna cause a wide range of wd symptoms and severity of symptoms in different people.  I've read of people who considered quitting heroin to be similar to quitting an ssri and not really that bad (idk how true this is because this is just anecdotal evidence from various forums, but it's not something I've heard only once).  All this really makes me wonder why people aren't more open to the possibility that kratom in particular may be capable of causing worse withdrawals in some than in others, especially compared to other opioids.  There is evidence that kratom can cause moderate to severe opioid withdrawals on the COWS scale in 50% of users.  I can't find the paper anymore that found this, but I can find some people referencing the data or similar data:

https://applegaterecovery.com/is-kratom-dangerous/

Some of the info about kratom's ability to cause overdose is a little off (basically what I think they're trying to say is that if you already have opioids in your system and then take more kratom, you can od, which is true but they fail to word it as such) but they have the info from the article I am struggling to find.  There is another article from drugabuse dot com but for some reason I'm not allowed to use the website in this sub.  Go figure.  All of this is also further supported scientifically by the addictive potential of kratom's alkaloid 7-oh-mitragynine which is already present on it's own in relatively high quantities, but is also a metabolite of the alkaloid mitragynine, and is capable of producing an opioid dependence in rats at much lower doses than morphine and even heroin.

I agree that kratom is an amazing plant that is capable of a lot of good, but there is no doubting that it's capable of causing a severe dependence, the keyword being capable.  All kinds of drugs are capable of all kinds of side effects, but the side effects are listed on the side of the bottle and made widely known online.  Especially with a side effect that can affect so many people using it regularly in such a negative fashion, why aren't we being more honest about this???  I understand why some kratom advocates (and sellers) are always concerned about kratom becoming illegal, but at the same time you gotta be honest about kratom and it's side effects as you would with just about any other drug."
Drugs,fpm0qih,t1_fplgefn,1588723203.0,"You understand that I already tried to taper off kratom and that was a million times worse than tapering off sub.  I'm not sure if I mentioned that in my comment to you or the other person's comment.  You ""kratom feinds"" are so quick to find reasons to defend kratom where there simply aren't any and it's simply impossible to cover all the bases to satisfy you actual idiots even with a comment as long as a short highschool essay.  I even mentioned my experience going cold turkey off another long lasting opioid but clearly that means jack shit to you kratom fiends and your sideways ass logic.  You are insane to be defending kratom like this for all the wrong reasons.  And it's not like I was getting high off my ass on kratom by the end.  I have limited money to spend on it and 35-45 gpd was just enough to get withdrawals in between each dose.  I tried upping it all the way up to 60-80gpd and I couldn't afford it for more than a few weeks and went back down to my standard 35-45 which was itself unpleasant but that's another story.  And I was getting as ""high"" off kratom by the time I tried ct as I was on suboxone when I quit.  My Suboxone dose was equivalent to my kratom dose.  The most I could get was the sensation of being content.  Trust me when I say that as I reduced my doses by 25% each dose reduction and there is simply no way that suboxone withdrawals would've remotely come close to my experience with kratom withdrawals in intensity.  In my experience that is bullshit.  Are you some kratom vendor with some agenda to defend it by all means?  Either that or your so thick skulled and smooth brained that you would try to make kratom look like the saint in all of this, even though it was already proven in my experience to be many times worse than BENZOS AND OXY FFS!  A single five gram a day reduction in dose made my sub taper truly look like coffee withdrawals compared to Adderall cold turkey.  It's the plain and simple fact.  Why can't you accept that?  Do you need kratom to be the best drug for every human on this planet or else you're going to try to prove why those people are lying or something?  Fr you're on some shit."
Drugs,fplb4up,t1_fpjgq73,1588709561.0,"You're acting like I took an outlandish dose with that last paragraph when I didn't take much more than you did.  Why do you have to act like such a prick about this lol.  If kratom withdrawals were like bad coffee withdrawals+ everything else you said, whatever tf that real meant, good for you.  I have to disagree personally.  If you check my other comment to this person, I acknowledge that kratom is a weird drug capable of causing little withdrawals in some people and more withdrawals than other opioids in others.  So many factors play into whether or not withdrawals will be mild or severe from the kratom you take and it's alkaloid content to your own metabolism of the drug. I also acknowledge that quitting Suboxone cold turkey is probably hell and gave my experience trying to quit another longer lasting opioid cold turkey, and while it wasn't a drug that lasts quite as long as sub, it still wasn't pleasant to quit off of.  I still wish kratom was nearly as easy however.  Panic attacks my ass.  But if you're smart and actually taper off the drug which  is what Suboxone is actually made for, it's really not that bad.  So just as a sidenote, please don't go around telling people not to use sub or something because you simply used it in the worst way possible.

If you check r/quittingkratom or other forums and sites regarding quitting kratom in general you'll pretty quickly find stories similar to mine as well as people making comparisons to coffee and ssris.  I've had a lot of experience with other drugs so when I say kratom was worse by miles, I'm not bullshitting.  Kratom wd PERSONALLY was undeniably a hell that was worse than that of quitting any other drug I tried, including nic (several cigs a day), amphetamines (snorting 60mg amp or 60-90mg of ritalin a day with occasional breaks to crash for many years), benzos (Ativan and diazepam at a wide range of doses for several months), and opioids (oxy 150mg and at one point 250mg a day, hydro was about 200mg a day, heroin @ .1g maxing out at .2g a day, loperamide @ max 200mg a day with 60mg of Omeprazole).  I've had plenty of people tell me that they switched from kratom to oxy, suboxone or tramadol, and ultimately feeling much better quitting or tapering.  I've also had people like you telling me it's comparable to stopping an ssri or ""coffee"", although I have to admit, people comparing their kratom withdrawals to coffee are probably lying out of fear that any sign of kratom being addictive will result in it's becoming illegal, which is bullshit because there are many more reasons for kratom to stay legal.  Those people saying kratom wasn't that bad to quit we're also mostly hyper defensive assholes defending the drug at all cost making it seem like they're still addicted and never actually quit.

Ik this is long, but I don't know a better way to get my point across so I apologize.  Being an ass to people who didn't have a good experience with kratom to try to defend it as this awesome drug incapable of producing wd as severe as other opioids or whatever your goal is is such a stupid endeavor that only results in more people lying about it's addictive properties and more people who don't actually need it getting addicted.  I wouldn't wish my experience on anyone, but the more I look the more I realize people are going through freakishly similar shit.  I've had friends in real life go through the same thing.  Not only that, it comes with all the psychological problems other opioids can cause.  I lost all motivation to go to work/classes and I could barely motivate myself to get out of bed by the end of my addiction.  I just wanted to get fucked up.  I really hope people start figuring out that while kratom is a plant with a lot of potential for good, it's not perfect and can fuck you up pretty bad."
Drugs,fpjiaqy,t1_fpj38sm,1588669548.0,"Alright I get what you're saying.  Yeah there aren't plenty of peer reviewed papers on this use of psychedelics, but I think this is one of those cases where the anecdotal evidence and it's past usage as a drug for addiction treatment before the Nixon era really speaks to it's efficacy in this respect.  It also was used in a clinical setting back then.  Personally tripping on opioids is what led me to quitting lol.  But hey, to each their own.  With psychedelics, ymmv in just about every respect.  I imagine this is probably gonna be the biggest hindrance to coming to any conclusion about it's potential to treat any mental disorder because in the end everyone is different.  Either way, there is no doubt that these are fascinating drugs with massive potential, whether or not be in treating addiction.  It definitely can help in treating certain disorders of perspective like depression in certain cases.  I'm guessing that's where we're going to learn it works it's magic best."
Drugs,fpjhrso,t1_fpj9zc2,1588668978.0,"Well I ultimately tried to get off at 35-45gpd and the main kratom I was using was this ultra potent green Malay, but I would occasionally mix in some white strains.  I wouldn't say it's the worst withdrawals because some people get little to no withdrawals and others experience hell on Earth.  It's definitely got something to do with the the person taking the drug and the alkaloids and how they interact with one another because kratom acts as a stimulant, antidepressant, antipsychotic, and mild sedative as well as an opioid, creating a high slightly different from opioids and as a result different withdrawals.  But the alkaloid 7-oh-mitragynine has been shown to be many times more powerful than morphine and even heroin and capable of producing a hell of a dependence itself.  It's present in the plant on it's own and is also a metabolite of mitragynine.  I tried a taper multiple times with kratom, but the fact that you have to dose many times a day (I was dosing at one point 6-8 times a day adding massive dose upon massive dose every few hours) and the constant emotional seasaw lead to confusion, relapse, and generally made it unbearable.  And then I tried cold turkey which as I already said went horribly wrong.  Before kratom, I was on oxy, hydro, and heroin (and loperamide w/ Omeprazole) for a year and a half and I quit successfully CT and made it six months sober before going on kratom for another year and a half.  Don't get me wrong, quitting opioids was hell and I was shitting, puking, crying, aching etc..  But there were genuine moments of human joy in all that craziness.  There was no return of the ability to feel joy during kratom withdrawals.  There was also this fatigue that left me unable to get out of bed the first few days and literally stiff as a board, catatonic and in pain.  It was only hell and rapid fire thoughts about suicide and all the things that make the world what I perceived as hell at the time.  There was also physical pain that outdid the pain of traditional opioid wd: drops of water in a shower felt like a rough massage of pellets and small stones and my knees ached at every small movement.  I'm pretty sure I had a small psychotic break while quitting.  The thing with a is that it's withdrawals do drag out and quitting it cold turkey is genuinely stupid and probably hellish.  When trying to quit opioids one of my attempts was off loperamide, a longer lasting opioid, although not as long lasting as sub, and I had two weeks of wd, after which I ultimately relapsed.  I totally get how that can be horrible.  But the whole point is that by making it last so long it makes a taper so much more gentle and easier to plan out.  I don't see what people hate so much about it cause I hear so many people complaining about what hell tapering off of it is and if you just keep a steady pace, it's a hell of a lot more manageable than withdrawals from just about any other opioid, at least ime.  I've tapered off relatively quickly and while it admittedly wasn't fun, I'm clean and feeling pretty good with no PAWS so far."
Psychosis,fpj1r6a,t3_gdmm8y,1588654198.0,"If you have the thoughts but still easily distinguish them from reality, I would usually doubt it's an actual psychosis.  While I'm not saying this is necessarily you, some people are self centered or narcissistic and they literally think everything is about them when it really isn't, but it doesn't mean they are psychotic, especially if these are just fleeting thoughts.  But the connections you claim to have drawn are truly very strange and it sounds like you recognize strange ""synchronicities"" that aren't really there.  It really sounds like something straight out of an acid trip which is never a good sign lol.  I would say go to a doctor and quit the cannabis asap.  Cannabis has been demonstrated to increase the density of the 5ht2a serotonin receptors in the brain while enhancing their activity.  These receptors are involved in both depression and potentially schizophrenia's symptoms and interestingly enough is the target of classic psychedelics.  By stopping cannabis, it's possible you will feel better.  Try to ween off amphetamines as quickly you can (I wouldn't quit cold turkey).  They increase dopamine levels greatly which certainly can play a role in schizophrenia which is characterized by an overactive dopamine system.  Don't be scared of taking antipsychotics or antidepressants.  While I've never needed to take antipsychotics, I hear they are particularly unpleasant to some, but they can be the difference between a healthy and fractured mind.  Your mind and your subjective experience is really all you have so don't take this lightly.  Antidepressants also can come with some unpleasant symptoms the first few weeks, some of which I've experienced, but they work quite well for most people.  I really hope this helps.  I wish you the best of luck.  But seriously, get sober.  Your going down a fucked up path in ways you can't imagine without being already having been addicted.  I've become all too familiar with drug addiction in many forms and it's about as hellish an experience as you can imagine."

I don't say this to diminish your accomplishment.  I personally wish I could've quit opiates as quickly as I knocked benzos.  I guess I'm just special though cause all I hear is people talking about how much worse benzo withdrawals are than opioid withdrawals and in my case they neither resulted in a significant high or a significant consequent low.  They're manic, disorienting and anxiety and craving ridden, and your constantly spasming in your legs among other weird places, but to be frank I don't understand the hype.  Maybe if you get stuck on them for years or more seizure prone it can result in much more hellish or truly lethal symptoms.  

Keep going bro.  It may not look like it, but what you simply can't realize in an addicted state is how much better being sober is on your psyche.  It also sounds like you may benefit significantly from sobriety considering your physical condition.  The drugs you're taking can't be helping you.  I personally wouldn't get on kratom.  I know a lot of people who have had withdrawals from kratom that were on par with other opioid withdrawals, people who've had little to no withdrawals, and people like me who had hellish withdrawals that well outdid withdrawals from any other opioid.  Personally they made oxy/heroin/hydro, suboxone, nicotine, amphetamine, and lorazepam/diazepam withdrawals all look like a walk in the a park.  It was such an intense and non-stop broderline psychotic hell.  Im not ashamed to say I ultimately used suboxone to taper off kratom and that it was truly painless, much like getting off an ssri, especially after the hell I experienced with kratom.  It can really swing both ways.  Now that you're off opioids and you're doing fine, just stick to what you have.  I'd say keep going.  It takes a lot of hard work, but it will pay off."

The very reason they ever were used in a clinical setting for addiction and all sorts of other psychological ailments is because people learned outside of a clinical setting that they can be used to help people with addictive tendencies among many other negative personality traits.  Also there is no reason to deny people who say psychedelics helped them with addiction of their experience, claiming psychedelics couldn't have actually done such a thing.  All it can take is setting the intention of finding the root of your addictive personality and eliminating it.  It can really make a difference.  I don't think psychedelics reliably help people, especially when used in a fashion not conducive to personal growth, but you don't necessarily need a trained psychologist nearby to gain any benefits.

True stimulant withdrawals from many months to years of abuse are a psychological torment paired with an anhedonic depression that you simply can't imagine at the moment.  You gotta be especially careful with meth which causes permanent damage to the dopamine and serotonin releasing neurons in your reward system and many other parts of the brain required for normal function.  With prolonged use, this will result in more permanent consequences than with any other stimulant.  

Switch to energy drinks as you quit.  It sounds stupid, and while caffeine, even when mixed with taurine and the stimulant Ginseng, feels nothing like illegal stimulants, it has gotten me through amphetamine/dexamphetamine and Ritalin withdrawals, which won't even remotely touch true meth withdrawals if you get to that point. They kept me at the very least somewhat functional for the next month instead of leaving me in a hypotensive and catatonic depressive state, sleeping 16h a day.  I even tried snorting caffeine powder in the form of guarana extract, 80mg a bunp, which while I can't say I would recommend to anyone due to cardiac side effects, kept me awake when I needed to be.

Nootropics,fph4291,t1_fpguvma,1588614596.0,"Yeah, I'm not denying that kratom can be an incredibly useful plant if used in the right ways and won't kill you.  That's where it outdoes heroin by miles lol.  It's alkaloids should have replaced traditional opium alkaloids in pharmaceuticals a long time ago.  If it were to be made illegal like how other opioids should be (at least for the moment as there aren't easily available and effective treatments for addiction) we would halt necessary research into how to treat and handle the opioid epidemic.  But where a lot of people are very wrong in a very problematic way about kratom is in it's potential to cause dependence, because that has been proven scientifically time and time again and it's also been shown in plenty of anecdotal evidence and surveys of regular kratom users.  By lying about it, people are getting more and more people hooked on it and counterintuitively making worse of an image for it when it comes to real data on the plant."
Nootropics,fpf7v7a,t1_fpf4do3,1588563910.0,"Well I went ~1.5 years using kratom at about 35-45 gpd which I guess would equate to abuse of other opioids.  That wasn't fun to come off of.  If you keep your use scattered as you seem to have been doing, you will be ok.  Even binges can be fine as long as you stop soon after.  A lot of people however will think that if you use it more frequently, it should be ok, but that's a risky game to play.  Tianeptine is a weaker opioid, but an opioid nonetheless.  It's also a serotonin reuptake enhancer, making it a pretty interesting compound.  When it's abused, it's said to result in a fairly unpleasant withdrawal syndrome as well."

AskDrugNerds,fpefk61,t3_gcsvay,1588546583.0,"Well the thing is that psychedelics can cause all of the things you said are associated only with schizophrenia, but psychedelics and schizophrenia are still probably not exactly the same experience.  You never seen someone who took too much LSD and thought they were god or plagued with similarly grandiose thoughts?  And also, people definitely see evil spirits on psychedelics and psychedelic are very well known to cause paranoia in some.  Maybe you haven't experienced these symptoms, but they occur fairly frequently under the influence of these compounds.  While it's hard for scientists to elucidate the relationship between serotonin in certain parts of the brain (most likely prefrontal cortex in the pyramidal neurons) and schizophrenia, it has been demonstrated that 5ht2a antagonists, especially when paired with D2 antagonists treat schizophrenia symptoms better than D2 antagonist alone, indicative that there is a correlation between the serotonergic system and schizophrenia.  It could also be more directly correlated to the mGlu2 receptor which is involved in the hallucinogenic and psychotomimetic effects of psychedelics and even to an extent dissociatives in an indirect fashion.  Certain agonists of this receptor have been shown to have a fairly powerful antipsychotic effect that may exceed the effect of classic antipsychotics and may become mainstream at one point.  There may also be a relationship with dynorphins (endogenous kappa opioid receptor agonists) which actually  have been shown to be potentially strongly related to schizophrenia's symptoms and onset (schizophrenia usually starts at a stressful life event and dynorphins play a key role in the stress response, especially in social defeat).  

This is a lot of information thrown at you in a very disorganized fashion, but I hope you find it somewhat interesting."
Nootropics,fpeb5zc,t1_fpealee,1588544013.0,"Welp I had withdrawals from kratom worse than heroin, oxy, hydro, loperamide, and Suboxone and I know a lot of people who said they had withdrawals on par or worse as well as people who said they had less severe wd.  You could say that it won't cause nearly the same financial problems and it's legal, but in terms of it's potential to cause dependence, it's practically the same as any other opioid, especially if you use it in the same fashion as other opioids (everyday, multiple times a day, upping the dose, etc).  I'm guessing you at least agree about phenibut, f-phenibit, and tianeptine cause they don't share the status of kratom."
Nootropics,fpeapfp,t1_fpdmsjv,1588543748.0,"Lol this.  If you think it's a crappy high, cool.  Good for you buddy.  But for me, honestly, compared to opioids, other stimulants, cannabis, and a whole bunch of other drugs, I can agree that it's generally gentle unless you smoke too much, but it is such a nice sensation of peace and clean calm euphoria that no other drug seems capable of.  It's just raw dopamine paired with some cognitive stimulation.  If only the cognitive aspect was present, I would agree with others and say it could be used as a nootropic.  I've used it in the past in the same fashion that OP described (a cig a day with a few puffs at random moments in the day, usually a couple puffs around noon and some at night), and what I will say is that it certainly is a risky game to play.  I stuck to 1 cig a day for the longest time, but soon I went on to ~1.5 cigs, then to ~2 cigs.  I eventually went up to about 3-5 cigs a day and realized the pattern that was all too familiar to me from experience with other drugs and I decided to stop.  It was pretty much painless at this point when I quit although I was a bit antsy and had cravings from time to time.  It was on par with some caffeine withdrawals at this point, but with any more cigs, I can imagine how it can get fairly unpleasant.  My advice to OP is stop while you still can.  It will be hard, but if you've had experience with other addictions, you will know how quickly everything can go to shit with drug addiction and how the more you postpone quitting, the worse it gets.  Stop while you're still at just 1 cig.  If you don't heed this warning, prepare for addiction"

quittingkratom,fpdw9ii,t1_fp4cpnf,1588535503.0,"I didn't interpret you as knocking me.  But I still do believe looking for excuses as to why kratom must have caused me worse withdrawals and why it generally shouldn't cause such severe withdrawals is a pointless discussion and shouldn't be used as a defense for it, which is what I thought you were trying to do.  We should just be open to other people's experiences with the drug instead of ignoring potential severe side effects for fear of it becoming illegal.  Counter-intuitively, this will result in more people becoming addicted and hence more backlash on the kratom community.  Not only that, but you're hurting real people when you start spreading false information regarding kratom's addictive potential which should be obviously problematic and just plain wrong.  I too used to do this and I feel guilty for it to be honest.  I paid dearly for it when I ultimately quit.

Regardless I hope you start feeling better.  I know that feeling your talking about at work.  About a week into going CT I had to simply talk to a college counselor and it literally took all my strength to not break down in front of her.  I was still having physical symptoms and the whole time my stomach was aching and I had chills and hot-flashes running up and down my spine and sweat and goosebumps completely covering my body and I had to tell her I was really under the weather.  She suggested that I go home but I couldn't meet her any later.  I unfortunately couldn't tell her she didn't have to worry about getting sick lol.  

Either way I wish you the best of luck.  You might wanna try some comfort meds or supplements at the very least for sleep."
quittingkratom,fp3vmvj,t1_fp3pi8v,1588286646.0,"I just want to also mention again that I don't believe kratom should be made illegal for it's addictive potential.  I think it should have replaced all opioids implemented in a pharmaceutical environment a long time ago and that making it illegal will not only halt much needed research on it, but will also drive a large group of people to use opioids that are truly much more dangerous than any of kratom's alkaloids.  The day we make kratom federally illegal is the day we give up on the opioid epidemic because it seems to be the next best thing we have atm.  But in the meantime, we should acknowledge all of its side effects and be objective about it's benefits and when it is appropriate to use (eg. unless you are prescribed codeine syrup for a flu, don't use kratom cause it has been demonstrated to be beneficial for quelling flu symptoms).  We also need to be more honest about how to use it appropriately to reap certain benefits.  For example, if you try to take kratom for depression and you use it daily, you'll quickly stop experiencing any beneficial effects as dependence sets in, whether it be mild or severe.  When I used kratom sparingly (first month of usage, I used once every other day to once every four days), it definitely worked wonders for depression and ADHD.  But as I began using it multiple times a day and upping the dose, I quickly began losing the benefits.  But if you're using kratom for pain, you will need to use it daily.  I hope you understand more my perspective on kratom because it's not like I hate the plant itself or think that it can't be beneficial in any shape or form.  I also think there is a culture around it that can be harmful and hypes up its potential benefits (sometimes people even advocate its usage for conditions kratom hasn't been demonstrated to be capable of treating) while denying definite harms (other than addiction, there are hormonal changes that come with opioids, it's a stimulant so it can be harmful to those with heart conditions, it can cause hair loss and dry mouth leading to dental damage in the long run.  Lots of kratom strains have been demonstrated to contain heavy metals which isn't an issue inherent to kratom, but worth noting nonetheless) in a way that can lead to people getting unwillingly dependent and ultimately hurt."
quittingkratom,fp3sftb,t1_fp3pi8v,1588284964.0,"I get what you're saying, but while there was a fear from a legal standpoint that did contribute to my drive to get off illicit opiates, I would say kratom ruined most aspects of my life just as bad as they did, if not worse (EXCEPT from a financial standpoint).   This was by far the biggest driving factor for me through wd.  I wanted to get off kratom just as badly, if not more because the amotivational aspect wasn't nearly as bad on other opioids where by the time I was quitting I was at least able to do things I needed to do.  Coming off kratom, I stopped feeling the need to socialize, my grades plummetted, I didn't have the motivation to do anything from going to classes to taking care of basic personal hygiene, etc.  All that stimulation it provided me got flipped on me and I was left worse than before.  It happened to me with Ritalin and amphetamine abuse in an all too familiar fashion so I'm not surprised it happened with kratom as well to be honest.  I struggle to believe it's anything other than just kratom and I really don't understand why everyone has to combat my very own experience with some random assumptions about what I did or my situation.  Maybe you were taking less kratom or ""lower quality"" kratom.  Maybe your ability to metabolize mitragynine into the more potently addictive 7-oh-mitragynine was impaired, leaving you with more stimulation and less of the classic opioid sedation.  There are just as many factors that can lead someone to having more severe withdrawals as there are that can lead to less severe ones.  It doesn't change the fact that kratom, when referring to it's addictive properties, shouldn't be regarded any different to any other opioid, cause I wouldn't wish anyone to go through something remotely similar to what I went through.  The only way to prevent that is by making it known that kratom can do that instead of treating kratom addiction as taboo or something that doesn't really happen or only happens to people who've never tried opioids.  If you know it can happen, it's your choice on how to use it.  If I knew what would've happened, I would've either never touched it or at least use it in great moderation.  As for Suboxone, getting off long lasting opioids cold turkey or any long lasting drug in general is hell on Earth.  I got off it with a many month long taper, and the withdrawals were minor to say the least.  They lasted a fair bit and would come in waves of anxiety, but they weren't anything I couldn't handle."

quittingkratom,fow9fpt,t3_g9r5gs,1588115476.0,"Quitting kratom can be anything from painless to hell on Earth for people using at just about any dose.  How severe your withdrawals are gonna be depends on the kratom you take and yourself.  Some kratom strains have very little antidepressant, antipsychotic, sedative and most importantly opioid and stimulant effect per gram in the first place that can lead to dependence, or they cause negative effects like spins at low doses simply because all strains and even individual kratom plants vary.  If you've ever gotten a bad kratom batch, you know this all too well.  Some people don't get very severe opiate or stimulant withdrawals by nature and metabolism of mitragynine to 7-oh-mitragynine will also determine kratom's addictive potential at a specific doses considering 7-oh-mitragynine is the component of kratom most responsible for it's addictive potential and is many times more potent than morphine and heroin so very little is required for drastic effects.  But whatever boat you're in with kratom, quitting after prolonged heavy usage can still be one of the most rewarding things ever.  I know I've been to hell and back with it and suffered more while quitting kratom than opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin, loperamide w/ Omeprazole, and Suboxone, but when I quit I gained back my human emotions that I have been craving desperately ever since I realized how numbed they have been.  Kratom is said to have antidepressant effects, which may be true for the first few weeks and quickly disappears as dependence sets in for obvious reasons.  The best thing for my depression was quitting kratom and never touching it ever again. I hope if you're out there dependent on kratom and suffering and you read all the way through this, you consider quitting.  It will be hell for a long while, there's no denying it.  But you will be capable of experiencing the same euphoria kratom provides without having to take a dose at 4 hour intervals"

Drugs,fos7vzx,t3_g8yvst,1588025574.0,"I've been through something somewhat similar, except instead of failing academically, I have been ostracized my whole life by peers, and instead of heroin, I used Ritalin and Adderall.  I also have tried alcohol at this point, but not much.  I had a Ritalin scrip and I decided to crush the pill and snort it.  It was an amazing feeling.  However, I wasn't as tech savvy as you and I had no idea how on Earth to use the dark web.  I eventually bought Adderall from a friend with a massive scrip and was weening off and that stuff was incredible, but it came with a hell of a crash and somehow I felt Ritalin was cleaner in it's stimulation in that it was pure joy without very much noradrenaline rush.  I graduated soon to benzos because they destroyed crashes and I generally really liked their euphoria.  I tried Xanax and liked it but it was too impairing and drowsy of a high and actually found Ativan to be immensely anxiolytic and as a result euphoric and not impairing until I go into higher doses than the ones which were recreational.  I went on to oxy pills and I believed this was the best thing I've ever discovered.  While the euphoria wasn't quite Adderall euphoria or even Ritalin euphoria, it was the perfect combination of anxiety relief and somehow stimulated joy.  Little did I know this perfect high was gonna come bite me in the ass later on.  At the beginning, I was fine using it every other day or so, but that quickly changed to dosing once a day.  Pretty soon, I was popping pills three times a day and went through a massive oxy script like it was nothing.  After just three weeks of using daily, I was a shakey anxious mess and I told the few friends I had that I thought I was coming down with the flu.  That's when something very unfortunate happened.  I had a friend outside of my school who cracked a joke about me lookin like I was in heroin withdrawals, and I was honest and said, ""yes that's actually exactly what's going on.  I recently went on a bender"".  He knew someone who knew a plug who got cheap pharmaceutical pills and from then on, shit went downhill fast.  Really fast.  This all happened during my senior year of high school.  My grades plummetted.  I started trading Ritalin pills and personal belongings for the drugs and I would just tell my parents I kept losing things (which did happen on occasion and would piss me off).  I traded out a few pieces of my mom's jewelry which scored me more oxy/hydro, but it was never enough.  I was also using loperamide w/ Omeprazole when I couldn't afford the pills, which is a horrible idea for your heart but it was all I haf.  I eventually realized this was financially unsustainable and decided to just give heroin a shot.  I bought a whole gram, and I snorted just a little Smidgeon at first that I eyeballed.  The light brownish powdery substance had a faint smell of vinegar until it was up in your nose and it burnt like hell, but then the calm began to wash over me gently.  I was surprised how little I actually needed instead of the five Percocet 10s I would usually have taken.  Then I remembered I had a pretty accurate scale I used for a science fair a long time ago.  I replaced the batteries and tried it out.  I had to weigh out a slightly higher dose than what I wanted and then cut it up into fractions.  Frankly, I was terrified every time I did this because I knew that I was still basically eyeballing my doses and that the density of the powder itself could vary in spots.  It could also be unevenly laced with fentanyl or some other designer drug that has never been researched in humans.  I didn't like doing heroin often for this reason.  God I'm so glad I'm past that point.  If you get sober, life really does get better.  You get back those human emotions you've been so deprived of, which sounds horrible but is so much more of a gift than you can imagine.  I wish you the best of luck bro."

You have been misinformed by addicted and fanatical kratom advocates and vendors that have a financial incentive to spread non-scientific bullshit about kratom that gets people hooked on it.  There are plenty of articles that have demonstrated kratom contains alkaloids many times more potent an opioid and addictive than drugs like morphine and heroin (namely 7-oh-mitragynine, which is definitely present in quantities high enough to cause addiction and is also a metabolite of mitragynine itself) and in conjunction with other alkaloids that provide stimulant, sedative, antidepressant (which really gets nullified after you become dependent) and antipsychotic effects, it can create a wide variety of wd symptoms based on the user and the type of kratom your using.  So instead of trying to get more people who never abused opiates in their life hooked on kratom because your scared the government will make it illegal if there is any sign of addictive potential (there is already plenty) stop buying into and spreading potentially harmful bullshit.

Nootropics,fopgz91,t3_g8fany,1587961240.0,"Honestly, low doses of cannabis, especially when paired with Mg glycinate (400mg of Mg per dose), have worked miracles for me in all sorts of ways.  It has provided me with all the benefits of pharmaceutical grade stimulants but without the negative anxiety that could become debilitating at times on the comedown of the Ritalin I used to be prescribed, and fascinatingly enough, I never really formed a dependence on it; If I quit cold turkey, I have to admit it's not fun and there were definite withdrawal symptoms, but if I tapered over the course of a few days to week, I had very literally 0 withdrawals which is not something you can say about many other recreational drugs at all.  At low doses, I had no withdrawals.  If I used it heavily and at higher doses, there is definitely an amotivational aspect that becomes almost dysphoria during the high after a while, but at lower doses, I got almost the exact opposite effect.  I could mindlessly work on simple tasks without the nagging thought that I would rather do something else and I could fly through harder tasks effortlessly.  Emotions were definitely enhanced, but I could more easily observe them and not react to them which was far better than simply being numbed by the Lexapro I used to be prescribed which frankly, along with all other ssris and SNRIs, was the worst antidepressant ever.  At lower doses, my focus was greatly enhanced which may simply be the motivational effect it had and it also helped with creative problem solving by very clearly enhancing my creativity and ability to explore all options that could be a solution to a problem.  The anxiety relief is there and not like anxiety relief from any other drug.  It leaves room for some ability for anxiety to be present, but as I stated earlier, it allows me better to observe it without really responding to it.  I added magnesium because it seems to allow me to get away with higher doses while avoiding many of the negatives like paranoia, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and general anxiety, but it doesn't help with focus which may still suffer at higher doses."

But it's still capable of producing pretty much the same dependence as other opiates so you do have to be careful."
Drugs,fopcc2s,t1_fop8fvd,1587957970.0,Yup.  That's why I mentioned the B12.  Nitrous can cause a B12 deficiency which can result in nerve damage as well as a myriad of other horrible things if used heavily as you described.

Drugs,fop51xi,t3_g8n13u,1587953242.0,"Huffing butane and hydrocarbon solvents in general also a great way to die from sudden cardiac death from lethal arrhythmias.  Hydrocarbons for some reason (some say it's hypoxia but this is mainly an issue with hydrocarbons and brominated/chlorinated/fluorinated hydrocarbons.  These include butane, chloroform, duster, etc) sensitize the heart to norepinephrine so a sudden fright or excitement of pretty much any kind can spontaneously kill you.  Other than that, hydrocarbons are fairly neurotoxic beyond their ability to cause hypoxia and they can cause cognitive changes and nerve damage.

So... If you're gonna even think of doing an inhalant, either just stick to regular drugs, or do diethyl ether or nitrous oxide (you MUST take B-12 with nitrous especially if you use it regularly to not literally become a paraplegic in constant pain) which are nowhere near as dangerous and have as potent, if not much more potent of an effect."

He said that after about ten months did the bouts of cravings really become a manageable.  A friend of mine in Canada who convinced me this stuff is ok was taking 20-25gpd and had a similar experience.  About a year later he still snapped me talking about his sudden bouts of anxiety and anhedonia for several days.  I was using 60-80gpd at my peak usage and cut down to 35-45 and simply couldn't go through with either CT or tapering.  I was having wd far far worse than the ones I had from oxy, hydro, and heroin, and I decided to switch to Suboxone which frankly saved me.

The M4 receptor also inhibits certain actions of the D1 receptor.

Psychosis,fokyl1h,t3_g7vgno,1587851415.0,"A potential family conflict really shouldn't stop you from telling her what happened to you and what could be happening to her.  As you yourself probably know all too well, your subjective perception of reality is all you have and it's invaluable.  Schizophrenia is something that runs in families, so it's not entirely unreasonable for her to be going through the same thing as you or something similar.  Looking for patterns that either are really not there or simply just that, patterns, and assigning unwarranted value to them is classic psychotic behavior.  Think of those stupid conspiracy jokes that always go something like ""soccer starts with s.  Satan starts with s.  therefore soccer is a satanic sport"" but taking it 100% literally.  To the healthy mind, the correlation is absolutely ridiculous, but to some with psychosis, such a connection may be of great value.  It's delusion.  If she does have something going wrong with her, you would be saving her from being trapped in mental hell.  Catching schizophrenia in it's development and treating it with antipsychotics and therapy can halt it's progression, and at some point, you may even be able to ween off the medication.  But that's only if you catch it soon.

The only case I wouldn't be as worried is if this is some horoscope type of bs that is actually believed but not taken too seriously by a larger group of people.  The reason I say this is because you claim she found a legitimate article about it.  Although it sounds really concerning considering how she related patterns of numbers to the spirituality, it may be more acceptable if she's always been a spiritual/superstitious person interested in these things without actually assigning too much value to them.  If this is something widely believed by a group of superstition people (which I REALLY DOUBT), then I would approach this situation a little more carefully.  

Regardless I would tell her about your experience with numbers/patterns and ask if she's doing ok and tell her how horrible it was when you started to lose control of your own mind.  Explain this is a condition that easily runs though families.  Make sure she understands your doing this in good faith and that if she goes to get help, you will be there for her every step of the way.  Tell her that what you see looks very bad and don't try to convey that you think that what she's saying is somehow ridiculous or stupid or attack her in any way.  But try to explain to her that she may need help that will really benefit her.

The thing is that I really doubt it's the second scenario I presented, considering she was ""noticing patterns"" a little while beforehand, even if there was an article there to support her suspicions.  Regardless you need to reach out to her.  If it gets worse, she may even hurt herself or others which is obviously bad news for her.  I wish you and your sister the best of luck.  This is a complicated situation and I totally understand your hesitance.  But you need to do this because it's very possible for her to have developed schizophrenia as well."

AskDrugNerds,fokfci4,t3_g7d1a4,1587841027.0,"Haloperidol causing some form of sensitization is most likely possible, being an antipsychotic and possibly upregulating dopamine receptors and alpha adrenergic receptors (it also blocks some adrenergic activity to an extent).  However it has no effect on TAAR1 receptor as an inverse agonist.  It's precise mechanism of action is not entirely known, although is seems to block postsynaptic D2 receptors and increase dopamine turnover, basically meaning it somehow increases the rate at which dopamine is taken out of the synaptic cleft.  Not many, if any actual TAAR1 inverse agonists or antagonists actually exist or are used.  There isn't a mechanism unrelated to TAAR1 agonism I know of by which low doses of amphetamine can certainly cause sensitization because it doesn't have many other mechanisms by which it could decrease dopamine release at low doses.  It's activities are TAAR1 agonism, VMAT2 competitive inhibition, and Dopamine and norepinephrine transporter competitive inhibition.  But, amphetamine does decrease the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons by binding to TAAR1 which blocks certain potassium channels and consequently reducing dopamine release, and if that is an effect that can take place at low doses and not change much in intensity at higher doses, this effect may be by some mechanism or another regulated and reduced and this won't be an impediment to amphetamine's effects at higher doses.  This is a hell of a stretch of a theory however, and I think it's highly unlikely to actually be significant.  I don't think the people who are claiming this happens are schizophrenic, unless they are talking about haloperidol causing amphetamine sensitization in which case they're probably bipolar/schizo and prescribed it lol.  However, I think for the people claiming sensitization occurs, it's just a whole bunch of placebo.  They probably started by taking low doses and when they upped the dose, they fell victim to the steep response curve that amphetamines have in which at one dose your chill and motivated and ready to go, and then at just a slightly higher dose, your an uncomfortable anxious mess.  They then probably attributed the effect to them getting sensitized to it."

Psychosis,foemmmw,t1_fodsaml,1587707937.0,">honestly it’s not impossible that the BF is just playing a role because he can get away with it by blaming it on the psychosis

I guess he can, but what incentive would the bf have to do this?  If he doesn't really love her, then he should have no incentive to stay with her.  Expressing his love would just trap him in an unhealthy relationship.  It doesn't make sense.  This whole scenario your proposing is extremely unlikely and it makes no sense to assume this is the case as you have done until now.

>when I say I hope she doesn’t do it to anyone else I mean that I hope that she doesn’t later on in life put someone else through the same roller coaster ride, because people also do this as well, they say in their hearts “ I’ve been hurt, so I don’t care if someone else gets hurt” and in there actions they express this feeling of disconnecting, my own mother dislikes me so much, through me out at twelve, want to know what she said to me through the window? She said “ you look like your dad, now get away from here” now how her issues became that type of problem for me is beyond my understanding, but it happens and people will carry things from relationship to relationship and in a sense sabotaging their own success, so a person must consciously choose to do right by others even tho they themselves have been hurt, I see it all the time, hurt people hurting people, and with this no one ever heals properly, 

I'm sorry you feel that way about social relations.  Nobody should have to go through what you went through.  But it doesn't seem like the OP indicated she tried to hurt her BF because he hurt the OP.  If anything she just sounds concerned and severely hurt herself.  It seems like you immediately assumed she decided to hurt him because he was being hurtful and there's simply no indication that that's what happened.  You have no reason to throw around a statement like, ""I hope she doesn't get with anyone else"".  And, with all due respect, although it would be nice for no one to hurt anyone else and for the world to be a perfect place, if you say something hurtful, you should be expected retaliation.  It's part of why you don't spread negativity in the first place.  I don't think she should never be in a relationship because relationships have arguments.  If a relationships is gonna be such an emotional rollercoaster, unless it's a physically or psychologically abusive one or one where there is no love, it's gonna be because of what you do for those you love.

>hate is a consuming poison that affects those closest to it, when you bump into someone rude and nasty at the store, guess where that nastiness is in full force? At home with those closest to it

This would be the case with most people with no psychotic disorder, but in people with psychosis, it being a condition in which you are detached from your reality, you can express such behavior in unwarranted situations.  Unwarranted emotional reactions are trademark characteristics of psychotic disorders.  It's not because the bf grew up in a hateful household or he's stuck with the OP who is a hateful person.  With all due respect, although I believe your story entirely, it's not something that happens with every healthy relationships where two people love eachother and clearly want to make it work.  Your proposed side to things is very unlikely to be the case with normally functioning people like we presume the OP is.  Presume as in make some within reason assumptions about their situation.

>Neither one of us knows the OP personally and we both chimed in based off of what we’ve heard

>...also we must not look at things with closed eyes or with limited view

Ok, but at the same time it doesn't make sense to assume the worst most unlikely case first.  It's not particularly common for people to get into relationships to inevitably deeply hurt people like you somewhat seem to believe is the case with the OP.  Also we read the same thing.  There is is nothing in the whole of the OP's post indicative of any of the potential animosity you perceive.  In fact, I just see concern

>so this person has a choice to make, one that they might not because choices lead to different possibilities, which ultimately means we leave our comfort zone, complacency must be overcome

I'm sorry but I don't see the correlation to people who hurt eachother...  Of course there is a choice we make at every moment to do one thing or another.  What is your point"

During cannabis withdrawals, I found that caffeine, especially with L-theanine or taurine (or both) worked wonders to get back motivation which can be destroyed.  For sleep, exercise and kava kava helped immensely.  I was really hyperactive during wd and I needed to exercise at least a bit if I wanted any sleep.  

Btw, I too hate it when people say that it has no withdrawals and is not addictive, especially when their excuse for saying that is that people who claim they get addicted to it are gonna make it illegal forever.  It definitely is addictive, even if it's addictive properties and withdrawals aren't like those of heroin or amphetamine.  It should be treated as a side effect to the drug and people should be honest about it.  They're definitely more mild than/on par with nicotine withdrawals.  But, they also last a fair bit which is probably due to thc's longer half life.  Something I noticed is that they can change in severity based on what you're doing.  The emotional intensity of withdrawals seems extremely variable based on your situation unlike with other drugs in which you're gonna go through absolute hell whether you like it or not and it's important to use this fact to your advantage.
