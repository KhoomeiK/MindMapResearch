UCSD,fphl5yb,t1_fpgkwib,1588623212.0,"> We recognize that some students may not be able to safely travel to campus for fall quarter. We plan to continue to offer remote instruction as part of our approach for fall 2020 in a way that ensures students who cannot be present are still able to have a rich and high-quality educational experience.

Such a vague statement. Does this mean that online will only be offered to those that can’t travel to UCSD? Or will it be an option for everyone?"
UCSD,fp3foe7,t1_fp3avo9,1588278489.0,"I guess “mitigating stress and anxiety among students” and “flexibility to students” is very low on the AS bucket list of priorities, even in the midst of a global pandemic."
UCSD,fp2zo7q,t3_garycm,1588270591.0,"Yeah. School is ranked well and in close proximity to my home, a rare, unique combo that allows me to graduate from a respectable university with no student loan debt.

I’d pick Computer Science over Chem as my major though. That was definitely the worst mistake of my life. Never major in something that doesn’t have solid job prospects with just a BS. Expect jobs that filter by MS / PhD to highly prioritize your graduate institution over what you actually accomplished in grad school."

OMSCS,fo61jka,t3_f3ihka,1587543046.0,"I see that attending a selective undergrad is a key factor for admission, but does anybody have a good gauge of exactly how selective it needs to be in order to see any benefits from it?

I'm a CS Minor (will have 34 credit hours of CS w/ 3.0+ minor GPA by the time I apply), Chemistry major so I'm already at a pretty big disadvantage, and it seems like I'm going to get a B- in Data Structures which is a critical class. BUT, I attend UCSD, so maybe that could help compensate a bit for my shortfalls? Or does that ""key factor"" only apply to people that attended Ivy League schools?"
UCSD,fnax9yq,t3_g0ddny,1586805446.0,"Only way I could see that happening is if new rules are adopted for Fall quarter, like no mandatory attendance. It would be a PR nightmare for the university if someone got sick because they were forced to come to lecture."
UCSD,fmn7iio,t3_fw7kav,1586219849.0,Yeah but most of my classes have eliminated midterms and/or significantly reduced the weight of the final. It’s less stressful imo.
UCSD,fmab64b,t3_ftza7m,1585888691.0,"Absolutely. As a commuter, I can confidently say that the quality of my learning experience has improved tremendously. I really don’t miss a lot of the bullshit I used to deal with. I feel SOO much more free now."
