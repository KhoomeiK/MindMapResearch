The Emerus is good but I wouldn't call it the best. On average, in a race, I find the approximate lowest and highest speeds you reach are going to be 45 and 90. I've recorded this by going thru races in singleplayer in cars with very high acceleration and plotted it in charts, just trust me.



The car with the best 45-90 acceleration without using rockets is the cyclone. The Emerus is more than a second slower (3.5s vs 2.3s). The cyclone also has absurdly good traction. It's not the best but it both handles and accelerates better than the Emerus.


The Emerus has a decent top speed. Just a hair (.1 mph) above the Krieger (125.04 vs 124.987). But it's actual top speed doesn't come close to a glitching 811 or Pariah, both of which glitch in normal racing conditions at 30 fps. Only the 811 will glitch at 60 fps tho. The 811 and Pariah glitch to insane speeds (close to 200, the fastest rocket only gets to 146, for reference) so they're kinda absurd.

The deveste has better top speed (127.593) and acceleration (3.437) than the Emerus and is probably the most balanced, though as I don't own it I can't speak to it's handling.

Use the 811 for tracks with long straights. Use the cyclone for tracks with lots of turns and off-road bits. If you're budgeting or want an all rounder, the deveste eight is better than the Emerus in basically every way, even if only by a little bit.


Personally I like the cyclone best. For an electric it has a high top speed (~115). It can off-road better than any super, and it's super forgiving for crashes with it's absurd acceleration. It also drifts fucking great, tho so does the 811. But that's me though.



Tl;Dr: Deveste 8>Emerus in every way, but it's better to pick your car based on the track. Cyclone is for high turn density tracks, 811 for ones with straights."
GTAV,fo4rfef,t1_fo4mhq3,1587509769.0,"Dominator still has highest topspeed.



Hustler has the best mid-range (45-90) acceleration but doesn't handle very well. It also makes the best quarter mile. However the Duke o death does a better 1/8 mile and the dominator does the best 4km. Note that there's apparently a so called burnout glitch which makes other cars (e.g. Yosemite) actually faster for these as well."

So while these makes totally match up between GTA and IRL a lot of the cars for each make might not neccesarily match in game."
