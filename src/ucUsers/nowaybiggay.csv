btd6,fopxtnp,t3_g8wcc7,1587975789.0,"Honestly if by round 63 all u have is dart monkeys that might be ur problem. I would try to get a sun avatar and an alchemist for that round. You should have around just enough money to afford that combination and it’ll easily get you to round 80. Beyond that you’ll wanna get towers that slow bloons down or make them easier to destroy, like glue gunners with Moab glue or glue storm. You could even get an engineer with over cloak for your sun god."
btd6,fop6crp,t1_fop685l,1587954067.0,"Pat for sure. Extra pierce for any monkey surrounding him for his ability, plus he stubs all bloons except the bad when he levels up. He levels up fast. Only thing is he has a small attacking radius, so intersections are the best location for him"
btd6,fop5u1f,t1_fop5kc6,1587953736.0,"Churchill levels too slow, and unless you’re doing a hero only challenge, that causes him to be poor at support. He has incredibly bloom popping potential, but at 2000 on medium, u miss out on a lot of ez levels right at the beginning of the game since u cant buy him. Adora can be good popping power, but her beam of light ability needs a buff. Adora isn’t necessarily bad, she just isn’t as good as those above her."
btd6,fop5fgt,t1_fop58be,1587953479.0,"I knew I forgot one, but on the bright side, he is pretty useless. He’s a downgrade to Churchill in my opinion seeing as how his lvl 10 works on towers that no one is using the ability path for. His popping power is sad and his stun needs a radius buff. Overall 0/8 I do not rate"

I don’t see this as being very fair, and I know that as a result of this stress an exponential number of students will be cheating an absurd amount on this exam. You’ve got two choices: take it up with the department before or after the exam(after works well because u can rally student opinion about ability to complete the exam in the allotted time) or you can cheat ur ass off and hope for the best.

UCSD,fo50vrd,t3_g5r0w9,1587515128.0,"I will let you know that at UCSD, chemistry prerequisites as lower division classes have been the hardest thing for me so far.

UCSD is a fun place to be for sure, but college will be as easy as you make it for yourself."

I saw in another comment u got into UT Dallas and the honors program. Go there, I’m telling you you’ll be better off. UCSD is a good school, but it’s not outstanding in any way that makes it worth that price, out of state is a scam. To get out of college with zero debt is beyond an amazing feeling. An education is an education is an education, more often than not schools try to oversell one department or another to make their school look better, but they all have similar education.
