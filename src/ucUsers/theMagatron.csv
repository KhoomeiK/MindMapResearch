He was also a pretty good prospect coming out of last year‚Äôs draft too, and running backs usually pan out well in the nfl.

I think he didn‚Äôt see the field because of the depth we have at runningback, hopefully he moves up on the chart this season."

Patriots,fovi12g,t3_g9tgf9,1588101659.0,"I thought the draft was pretty great until the TE picks.

Digger was a risk, but he‚Äôs got great potential. Uche and Jennings seemed like great value at a team need.

But then when you get to the trades made for Asiasi and Keene, they seem like reaches (I think they will still shine, but they didnt seem like great value at the time). 

Not sure what to think about everyone else after that."

https://www.google.com/amp/s/medicalxpress.com/news/2020-04-meters-social-distancing-mit-droplets.amp

And this phony 2 meters being promoted by the WHO (which has proven to not be credible at all during this pandemic) isn‚Äôt supposed to protect people in a rally like this. It‚Äôs supposed to protect those doing essential tasks in lower density places, like going to the grocery store.

One of the comments on top suggested that if just someone sneezes, they all get sick. 

And frankly, I don‚Äôt know why you are so upset, these people are spreading the risk of infecting others with coronavirus. I‚Äôm sure that all of the epidemiologists and infectious disease experts in your rhetoric will really appreciate these people protesting so close together."
