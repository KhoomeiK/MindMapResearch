“Part of that approach relies on having access to one of the world’s best-functioning health-care systems. At no stage did Sweden see a real shortage of medical equipment or hospital capacity, and tents set up as emergency care facilities around the country have mostly remained empty.”

Clearly there’s a few big differences between US and Sweden. Millions here are without healthcare before and especially after this virus hit, think about all those people who’s healthcare was tied to the jobs they lost. And in the PPE and medical supply department, our government is doing a terrible job with shortages across the country and the direct seizure and redistribution of supplies from hospitals."
