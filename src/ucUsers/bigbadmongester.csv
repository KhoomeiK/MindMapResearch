ucr,fp85zqo,t1_fp85sfe,1588384400.0,I’m having trouble logging into Rweb again but once I can I’ll post the exact steps to access it on here
ucr,fp85s0p,t1_fp85pwp,1588384243.0,Yeah it said I was getting $250 from it and it had all my aid awards broken down
ucr,fp85og0,t3_gbxabl,1588384171.0,Go to your financial aid section and you’ll be able to see award amounts. Try searching by term
ucr,fp855nw,t1_fp850no,1588383781.0,I also am only getting 250. I hope it’s not fixed for everyone at 250 because while I’m not in too much need of the money I know other people will genuinely be needing it

ucr,fn98qit,t3_g0ast7,1586763452.0,"Hey I’m right in the same boat as you. Never had a large group of friends, haven’t gone to a single party or event, didn’t get a girlfriend on campus, never joined any of the clubs either. I just have kind of floated by and kept to myself. And for the longest time, I felt the same way. That I was missing something that I would never be able to get back.

I can’t remember what caused my shift in attitude, but I just stopped caring about all that and figured that I can party and meet people outside of college. You have plenty of time to get all that sorted out after. 

So enjoy yourself now, enjoy yourself later, in the end as long as you enjoy yourself at some point that’s all that really matters"
MakeMeSuffer,fn0b5qz,t3_fyc0qf,1586538723.0,"Holy fucking shit. There are less than 2 days left until animal crossing comes out on the switch and I can't wait any longer. I need to see Isabelle in 1080P HD 60FPS, and I need to see her NOW. Not only is she the love of my life, but I fucking need more rule 34 of her. There is nothing more fucking hot than Isabelle, and the new game's release will (If my calculations are correct) cause a massive flood of new Isabelle rule 34. I have harassed everyone I've found with an early copy, and I've tried to convince them to give it to me in every way I know. That includes offering my mum's credit card (that's fucking revenge for trying to take away my 3DS you bitch), death threats, begging, and other typically effective means. So if anyone has an early copy, please give it to me. I physically cannot wait any longer for Isabelle.

Please."

toastme,fmv1iwa,t3_fx3y1i,1586403780.0,"I know it might not seem much coming from some random guy on the internet, but you’re beautiful. I know the feeling of thinking poorly about yourself and what it can do to one’s mental health, but please know that how you feel in one moment isn’t indicative of what the rest of your life is gonna be like. You’re a catch and any person would be lucky to date you.

Hope you feel better, stay safe, and keep your chin up, because even when you feel unloved, just remember that someone out there does love you :)"
ucr,fm8pkmn,t3_ftpdoj,1585853653.0,Also make sure your professor hasn’t been posting through canvas. Try logging in and see if you’re enrolled in the class that you’re waiting to hear from
