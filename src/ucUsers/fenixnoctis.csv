instant_regret,fplp4vn,t1_fpl74jn,1588716810.0,"It's the general idea that using a potentially addicting thing as a substitute for something in your life, i.e. as a coping mechanism, instead of as an additive, like a hobby, dramatically increases your chances of getting addicted to said thing. There's a body of research confirming this for classical shit like drugs, and recently addiction research has been moving into more non-classical shit like video games and sugar. You can go out on your own and explore this more, but here are two papers I was easily able to find:

ReinhardtMains,fnm4k0f,t3_g2ckng,1587064976.0,"With rein you should be dancing in and out of cover and playing corners. During the times you are relatively hidden, or most of the enemy team is not in front of you, it's safe to peak back for half a second to check on the status of your team. You'll almost always have an opportunity for this before engages because engages should start when your team has a lot of resources to invest. For you that means high health and high shield and you only obtain that if you've been in cover. 

Also when you go swinging like a madman, say because of nano or zarya bubble, you don't have to fully focus on the hammer, you can swing around in wide arcs (this also hits more people) and pay attention to what's going on in the background too. This will also prep you to start thinking about blocking abilities while you swing, because a swinging rein is a juicy target for an ana nade for example. 

Another thing is make sure to shield cancel your swing ocassionaly because bringing out shield puts you in third person which should give you a wider view and more context on the fight.

I think eventually you also get good at predicting where the enemy and where your team will move in response to your movements. This is of course SR dependent. I think in silver and gold the team pays less attention to the main tank."

OverwatchUniversity,fngeyqk,t1_fnfmm1q,1586930162.0,"The problem is that having heroes that cannot be countered by your role means that there will be huge variance in your games, and your ability to provide value in games with an echo is reduced, regardless of what rank you are in.

The truth is no one fucking knows what causes ADHD but we've found a ton of correlations, physiological, environmental, psychological and so on. We've also found that giving people with ADHD stimulants improves their lives with minimal side effects, but it's still heavily debated why. That's it. 

The idea that it's as simple as ""I'm lacking a chemical and this pill provides that chemical for me"" is dangerously naive"
