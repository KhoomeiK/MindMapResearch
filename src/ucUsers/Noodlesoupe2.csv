asktrp,fpldp5c,t3_ge349g,1588710865.0,Yeah you have to do a push pull in my opinion. I’ve tried seeming laid back and pull attention away completely but if they’re not emotionally invested in the first place they’re not going to bother to chase
asktrp,fplde48,t1_fpl1rk8,1588710708.0,They do it more to them but they do it everyone if they’re comfortable enough

asktrp,fpld5p6,t3_ge1jjc,1588710588.0,men banter so banter back. They’re not insults they’re ribbing
asktrp,fpi3le3,t3_gdiiig,1588632988.0,Telling a girl you love her after one hook up isn’t treating her well it’s creepy. That’s why she didn’t like it. Also sidebar
asktrp,fphsu14,t3_gdicw4,1588627171.0,Open relationship I guess but I don’t see how you can do this unless your smv is much greater than hers or she has low self esteem. Or you’re ok with her getting plowed by another guy

unpopularopinion,fpf30wp,t3_gcxwfi,1588560598.0,Sorry the thought of sex makes you clutch your pearls. A kid isn’t going to be traumatized by watching a music video. Take your Puritanism somewhere else

asktrp,fpbxnqd,t3_gcgxk3,1588481451.0,Because if it was a plate or ONS they wouldn’t care enough to ask.
asktrp,fpbxi00,t3_gck1k0,1588481327.0,Don’t game virgins man it’s not worth it. Best case scenario you have mediocre sex where you have to teach a girl on top of being extra gentle until she finds another man. Worst case scenario she gets attached and you have a clingy bitch harassing you. It’s not as fun as it seems. She seems kind of damaged anyway so I wouldn’t go there.
asktrp,fpbx1qq,t3_gck8g1,1588480980.0,Slowly work your way up until you’re confident gaming hot women. Every guy can bang a hottie it just depends on your frame status and mindset (and a bit of luck). But if you’re a beginner there’s nothing wrong with starting with plain janes
asktrp,fpbwu1s,t3_gcke6n,1588480818.0,She got you hook line and sinker to THINK she’s a unicorn. She probably does this with every other guy on tinder until she finds a guy to buy it. Guarantee she’ll stop acting like that when you promote her.
asktrp,fpbwia1,t3_gcik3r,1588480570.0,She probably stepped in because it’s bad taste to have your married coworkers hitting on each other. It’s not rocket science man

asktrp,fpb7e2c,t1_fpb4ku5,1588463684.0,Cold approaching on a random street is almost a guaranteed rejection. Go out with friends and you’re more likely to get tail.
asktrp,fpb6sa9,t1_fpazanx,1588463311.0,You put bitches above your homies? If you have fun with them who cares if they aren’t at your level. It’s shallow to choose friends based on status. If they hold you back that’s on you.

asktrp,fpb47qi,t1_fpb0mms,1588461761.0,She might have gained weight or her hormones changed it. Women are meant to have babies homes dicks ain’t gonna change it.
asktrp,fpb41hz,t1_fpazgz3,1588461657.0,If you like her and don’t get any bad vibes from her I’d go for it. Part of being RP is trusting on your own judgement. FYI most women don’t have interesting hobbies so I wouldn’t worry about it.
asktrp,fpaxx15,t3_gcee1w,1588458009.0,They’re only act that way toward you initially because they want your money and green card but they’ll turn into complete cunts as soon as they leave their shithole country. Watch 90 day fiancé as proof

asktrp,fpaxkvw,t3_gbzyq6,1588457806.0,I don’t see a problem. I have some female acquaintances but we never hang alone unless we’re fucking.
asktrp,fpaxdml,t3_gceugr,1588457685.0,Fucking doesn’t change how loose a vag is that’s just a myth spread by incels. It’s a genetic thing but if it’s so bad it turns you off don’t fuck her.
asktrp,fpax6x0,t3_gcextf,1588457573.0,No no no do not do this. You shouldn’t care if one girl leaves you on open if you have an abundance mentality. Just move on and if she actually likes you she’ll snap back.
asktrp,fpawyjl,t1_fpa3oyt,1588457435.0,Being red pill doesn’t mean you should abandon your friends for status. Friends aren’t plates so I don’t get what you mean by scarcity mentality
asktrp,fpawrmg,t3_gc985w,1588457321.0,"Unless you’re acting like a self righteous douchebag you shouldn’t be losing friends. Naturally red pilled guys have friends, even blue pulled ones are drawn into his natural charisma. TRP is a toolbox and shouldn’t change your personality to the point where it puts people off."
asktrp,fpaw4pv,t3_gcd5us,1588456944.0,Do you like hanging with her or not? You don’t choose a girl based off a checklist. Unless there’s signs of crazy or daddy issues or something serious like that benign things like liking shopping shouldn’t prevent you from being with a girl you like.
asktrp,fp8drre,t1_fp8bnsp,1588389764.0,It was a valid question.
asktrp,fp8d3ik,t3_gby3m5,1588389303.0,Men and women tend to have different standards of male attractiveness. Many girls find Benedict Cumberbatch or the kylo ren dude attractive but next to no guy would. You might be attractive in an unconventional way I guess?
asktrp,fp8cc8l,t3_gbvxzy,1588388776.0,"Imagine you were worshipped since you hit puberty, given attention by every straight man that comes within your vicinity, have other women hate/mistrust you, and every other part of you ignored for an attribute you didn’t even have to work for and will be gone by the time you are 40. You’d be pretty messed up and insecure too unless you have a very good head on your shoulders (neigh impossible for women) or you were too dumb to know the treatment is temporary. That’s why hotter women (especially the smart ones) tend to be bitchier and crazier than plain janes and also why a smart, nice, and beautiful unicorn is impossible to find. It’s a contradiction. In short, the smart ones do know, the dumb ones just live in a fantasy land where everyone’s nice."
asktrp,fp8bi5p,t3_gbyzm3,1588388208.0,Why do you care? Most of the men here are damaged too otherwise they wouldn’t be coming here asking retarded questions like this lmao
asktrp,fp8b87a,t3_gbrbqo,1588388021.0,Women WANT to be treated like little girls. They want to feel submissive and playful and young and that’s why daddy/little girl fetishes are so popular.
asktrp,fp7dvgd,t3_gbhbxh,1588368782.0,Idk you never check up on friends you’ve haven’t seen in a while? Or relatives you haven’t talked to in a long time?
asktrp,fp7bmnn,t3_gbqd8k,1588367582.0,I wasn’t that different. A lot of the red pill is common sense if you grew up with sisters and a strong father figure. But the Redpill keeps me on my toes and reminds me to chase myself instead of pussy
asktrp,fp7be39,t3_gbpkc4,1588367454.0,Depends how into you she is. If a girl really likes you her hamster will spin anything you do as a positive. This is the mistake betas make because women actually do like beta behavior as long as it comes from an alpha.
AmItheAsshole,fp76nv6,t3_gbl3wk,1588365025.0,NTA He’s not going to learn if he keeps being coddled by his parents and own ego
unpopularopinion,fp74p70,t1_fp707ur,1588364002.0,Plenty of people call black people thugs. I’ve seen white people called thugs too.
unpopularopinion,fp74lut,t3_gbn6xu,1588363955.0,What does this have to do with race tho? Nobody’s calling all white people school shooters unless they dress and act like one and vice versa for blacks. It’s more about the image than race.
unpopularopinion,fp74398,t1_fp6y7ui,1588363683.0,This is probably the most ironic statement ever made. Stay classy reddit
asktrp,fp73i6i,t3_gbjpkw,1588363376.0,"A lot of red-pill amateurs have an all or nothing mindset and it’s honestly really toxic for growth. They take AWALT literally and begin hating women and take the blackpill seriously and think because they can’t be a model or a movie star that means they should give up  I’m not a feminist or anything but a site that preaches how evil women are is bound to cause bitterness and victim mentality, even if that’s not the intent. But those guys would be bitter losers  without the Redpill so it’s not like it really changes much."
asktrp,fp72tsv,t3_gbc4ql,1588363021.0,Yeah the amount of larpers saying they owned a 5 million dollar business by 15 and have an n-count of 1000 and only bang models or whatever is almost comical. Why would you be on reddit all the time if you were that successful?
asktrp,fp720w6,t1_fp5l1q0,1588362611.0,Men will fuck anything tho women are much more picky. They rather have emotional validation than sex
asktrp,fp57nec,t3_gbcwnt,1588319145.0,She’s probably bantering with you and you’re reacting like an autist. Sass back or play it cool
asktrp,fp57idq,t1_fp53wh4,1588319004.0,Truth. Feminism and capitalism is pushing women towards masculine roles while at war with their body pushing them towards femininity. Women now not only have to perfect their feminine role but the masculine role as well.

socialskills,fp4n0cv,t3_gb7c6k,1588302624.0,"Yeah but I had to work at it to make up for lost time. Put myself out there, worked out more, meditated, got more confidence etc."
socialskills,fp4mrv4,t3_gaqww6,1588302472.0,You’re not supposed to think in a conversation you’re supposed to just let whatever you think come out your mouth. If you are trying too hard to think you’re probably insecure. Conversation is supposed to be enjoyable not a test.
socialskills,fp4mg8b,t3_gb33ix,1588302268.0,"Those movies are idealized versions of hs. If they portrayed HS like it normally is there’s be no movie bc it would be too boring. Most people aren’t throwing wild parties, maybe a kickback or two a year. Most high schoolers are awkward and not as attractive as the 25 year old actors playing them. Most actually have to study and attend class which movies never show. If you’re romanticizing HS you probably are lacking something now."
asktrp,fp4ls3f,t3_gb8faz,1588301854.0,You’re lacking abundance. You need to expose yourself to more women.

asktrp,fp4di8u,t3_gb8mc9,1588296730.0,Most sluts are mentally ill. Just like most betas are. They use sex as a way to fill in a void in their lives.
