ucla,fp4zv8j,t3_gbbgnw,1588311942.0,I give the win to Orion for sure
ucla,fp4xyn8,t1_fp4xsmq,1588310384.0,"I need to do my research still. I only watched the last few rounds of the debate. I really liked all the gen reps they are super nice. EVP was super good, have no clue who to vote for there. I don’t know much about the other races but as a person of color I want to support community oriented leaders. I’m a freshman so I wasn’t involved this year but I want to get more involved and hopefully run one day for something like gen rep."
ucla,fp4xdjg,t1_fp4um4e,1588309917.0,"Thanks! I really appreciate it! Right now I’m going to vote for Brandon Broukhim and Josh Feldman. They were the only candidates in the debate that explained what they have accomplished in USAC. 

For Brandon: The Food Fund, Discounts at Westwood businesses, Bylaw Changes (ehh)

For Josh: Blue Books, Laundry Discount
Can you give me some FTP accomplishments?

Totally don’t mean to attack you or FTP, just trying to make myself educated as I decide who I’m going to vote for!"

ucla,fp32cay,t1_fp31ujz,1588271893.0,"This is actually one of the most helpful messages I’ve seen so far, thank you for all the clarifications.  Since you seem to know a lot, do you think the usac and cub Referendum Critism is fair?"
