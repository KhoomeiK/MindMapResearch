berkeley,fp3zp3g,t1_foygbtk,1588288851.0,"Sweden has issued the same directives as other countries, except they are just recommendations and not mandatory.   Many people are following the government recommendations of social distancing, teleworking, and staying at home although some are not, but if even half the people stayed at home transmission would be reduced a lot because public areas would become less crowded. 

Unfortunately if the US downgraded our stay-at-home orders to recommendations, likely most people would ignore them and overzealous managers would make even nonessential office workers return to work without PPE or face termination."
berkeley,fp3y57r,t1_fowwo5y,1588287995.0,"SARS and MERS vaccines lost funding shortly after their development started because the diseases got under control and public interest was lost in their development.  Assuming COVID 19 forces us to all stay home until a vaccine is developed, you bet there'd be tons of money flowing into it until it can be developed."
Coronavirus,fonwvby,t1_fon3iej,1587928055.0,This is not true.  The Bay Area has been handing out $1000 fines for a while now for breaking the stay at home order.
Coronavirus,fnmdiwc,t1_fnjrae5,1587069481.0,"Yes, it's 60 days from when the service is supposed to be provided, not date of purchase.  You can and absolutely should, because if TM gets a lot of chargebacks, their fees for accepting credit cards will go up and it may make them reconsider their terrible refund policy.

Also most banks will still file disputes beyond 60 days even if they aren't required to do so by law for competitive reasons."
Coronavirus,fneijuy,t1_fnc6qlp,1586889999.0,"If you look at the actual flight numbers, routes, and airlines, you'll see a lot of them are cargo flights or repatriation flights; for example 3 flights with NRT-YYZ on Air Canada using abnormal flight numbers, lots of Asian airlines flying cargo flights (trans-pacific cargo flights often stop in Anchorage, passenger flights don't).  Also, domestic airlines have to keep flying to all their destinations to get stimulus money, so many of those flights are probably very empty."
berkeley,fnczxsd,t1_fnbtx4p,1586853283.0,Hasn't been confirmed but rumoured and seems decently likely seeing the current situation around the country/world.  Dorms are like cruise ships for spreading diseases.
berkeley,fnczshl,t3_g11nn8,1586853121.0,I heard they are taking a few weeks to process it so as long as you have a copy of the cancellation form you submitted with some kind of confirmation that it was turned in you should be able to fight it in the unlikely event that you don't get a refund.
Coronavirus,fn3y0ac,t1_fn3ie6i,1586630144.0,What are you talking about?  Many states in America are not on lockdown right now.

Coronavirus,fn18p1k,t1_fmyr0dl,1586557008.0,"I feel like all the die-hard America First people would start buying only gold flag products, which could make a difference to those areas of the country actually."
berkeley,fn17dkt,t3_fy4a1g,1586556256.0,"I once heard a rumor that their purposely assign non-Regents/DSP sophomores and up Unit 3 Triple to try to push them to off-campus housing to make more room for freshmen, which seems plausible considering that there's barely enough space to house the freshmen in the dorms."

If Italy is any indication, short of a China-style militarized lockdown, this isn't going to go away  anytime soon (and there is debate whether corona is really gone from China or if it's going to flare up soon once the government can't hide it anymore) so we will have to continue social distancing, although I certainly hope we aren't under stay-at-home orders until next year.  

What I would hope to see is a soft re-opening of campus, where non-essential buildings like Esh/MLK stay closed, and all classes are still online except for exams, labs, performing arts, PE, and other classes that require being in person etc.  Don't allow student groups to reserve rooms on campus so that exams can be more spaced out in more classrooms.  This would eliminate the huge spreading vector that the massive lecture classes would be, and I could imagine people whose families live in Fremont or something just deciding to stay home if social life was still shut down and they are in a major whose classes don't suffer enormously from being online, reducing crowding in the dorms/apts. And we could re-open the libraries but only allow people in if they undergo a temperature check, wear a mask, and sanitize their hands, but somehow I doubt this university can pull this off."
berkeley,fn15ulq,t1_fmyq8rh,1586555392.0,You should be okay if you're still taking classes though.  The biggest red flags are long gaps of doing nothing after graduating or after your first job.
Coronavirus,fn130um,t1_fn0ge4j,1586553779.0,"Because some of the people in charge of the fired law enforcement officers don't think shooting black people or sexual assault is a big deal so they will re-hire LEOs fired for those kinds of offenses, but almost every major hospital thinks speaking out against cost-cutting admin is a big deal, so they will never hire a doctor/nurse that might threaten the bottom line like that, it's easier to go to the government and whine about a shortage of medical professionals."
