If you take more than one quarter off, you have to apply for readmission."

UCSD,fntkq9h,t3_g3r34v,1587243614.0,"Go to UT hands down. UCSD isn’t worth $125K of debt more. Neither are tier 1 schools, so as long as you do well in undergrad, you’ll do just as well out of college coming from UT, and you’ll be so grateful to be debt-free with $125K put towards your future."

UCSD,fn9aa1k,t3_g0ekdp,1586765124.0,"I would spread it over 3-4 days usually (not working the whole day, obviously). Day 1 I’d collect quotes, get a rough thesis down, and make an outline, as having these three things makes writing the essay itself way easier. Days 2-3 I’d write the essay (or write it in one day if I had procrastinated). Day 4, I’d come back with fresh eyes to revise and make sure all the formatting was correct."
UCSD,fmtk2ld,t1_fmtjse8,1586374071.0,Ah ok. I fixed my other comment

49ers,fmcn0lc,t3_fugput,1585948816.0,"> The 49ers got a bunch of phone calls — when I say a bunch, a couple of teams — on Nick Mullens, the backup quarterback in San Francisco. Nick Mullens. They were asking about him, and they turned down every trade offer for Nick Mullens. They wouldn't trade him.
