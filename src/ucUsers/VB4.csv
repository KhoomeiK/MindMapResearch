MortalKombat,fpmp7dx,t1_fplyckd,1588738177.0,I have a hard time actually getting in on some lui kang players. They just fireball and then go for the parry 50/50 if I start to get in close enough to punish
TheLastAirbender,fpmoybt,t1_fpmnvjh,1588738003.0,We have no time for your proverbs uncle!
MortalKombat,fplevha,t3_gdzrom,1588711464.0,Scorpion and fucking Lui Kang. As a Kotal main this is so frustrating
AmItheAsshole,fpl9pjr,t1_fpkfobf,1588708837.0,"That’s what I was thinking. He’s gotta be a really young guy, and if he is, it’s pretty normal behavior. I remember when I was a freshmen in high school my friends and I had group chats talking about the dumbest clingiest shit you could imagine.

I also think this might be a shitpost. After reading some of his responses I think even a 13 year old wouldn’t be this oblivious"
MortalKombat,fpl1ldm,t3_gdxln3,1588704763.0,Ill upvote since you’re pioneering a meme
UCSantaBarbara,fpbt42z,t3_gcg3ri,1588478042.0,"Everyone on this sub is so self-righteous sometimes. There’s probably plenty of groups of people who only see each other and that’s mostly fine. If two houses are friends and they’ve been hanging out with just themselves since the start of this then who cares.  

I’m not arguing against social distancing, but I am saying that using common sense people can see each other and even party together if they want. 

Plus it’s not exactly like the people who live on DP are at risk groups of people."
UCSantaBarbara,fpa42l8,t3_gbwoq8,1588440394.0,Hell yes! I just got one
suicidebywords,fowkfg1,t3_g9taeb,1588121520.0,Raidens gibberish when he flies in mortal kombat
pics,fotgz14,t3_g95pxk,1588053636.0,This is beyond beautiful... I’m at a loss for words
INJUSTICE,for6j64,t1_foqlfq2,1588007015.0,I remember hearing this too. I think it was on a YouTube video talking about the mortal kombat vs DC game. But I also think it was in the comments...
changemyview,foivfiy,t1_foinbes,1587798330.0,"Also if your neighbor has a bike like mine with a bad carb, then he might NEED to rev it a little to keep it going. I’ve been at stoplights before my bike is fully warmed up and had to rev my engine to keep it from stalling and had people think that I wanted to race them lol"
changemyview,foiux5r,t3_g7glkj,1587797837.0,"I ride motorcycles. My bike isn’t loud and it scares me sometimes that it isn’t. Even if his bike is obnoxiously loud to you, it’s undeniably safer. The more people notice you the less likely you are to get hit by a driver that’s daydreaming or whatever. It’s the same reason most motorcyclist have their brights on during the day. It’s important for us to be seen and noticed. And while it might inconvenience you, it can mean life or death for the rider. 

I will concede that people with extremely loud bikes should be more mindful of their neighbors and others in general."
drunk,fn8wg9m,t1_fn8qmhz,1586752101.0, I quit smoking and am also on day 6! Keep it up man... i think I’m actually gonna follow through this time
UCSantaBarbara,fn0u6t0,t1_fn0tzzq,1586548813.0,"You’re right, this is the attitude I need to adopt."
UCSantaBarbara,fn0ttt9,t1_fn0t3ab,1586548616.0,"You’re right though, there’s probably something I can figure out. I think I’m just pissed off at the situation more than anything. I feel like I’m wasting my money right now"
UCSantaBarbara,fn0tgpk,t1_fn0t3ab,1586548418.0,"Wouldn’t that only work if the reception was decent to be begin with? In my hometown sprint is notoriously spotty and slow, unfortunately."
UCSantaBarbara,fn0sljc,t1_fn0sb4f,1586547950.0,"Thank you so much, I’ll definitely look into this"
UCSantaBarbara,fn0s16c,t1_fn0rf7j,1586547644.0,I have sprint. I can’t even load YouTube at home lol. I’ll give it a try though
MortalKombat,fmre596,t1_fmqngg0,1586320615.0,I miss when kotal was trash and people would be excited to play me :(
MortalKombat,fmre2d4,t1_fmr72pf,1586320552.0,"You didn’t ask me, but 2nd variation all day"
SmashBrosUltimate,flz0bhr,t1_fly34b5,1585612788.0,Same! Deciding who my main is was the hardest thing I’ve done today
