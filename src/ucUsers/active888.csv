Unemployment,fowwd7b,t1_foww3gr,1588128574.0,Your more likely to get it if your below the threshold. But I think if your claiming more than 17k I think you‚Äôll have submit proof of income cause you qualify for a higher weekly benefit below 17 you don‚Äôt have submit proof of income unless they ask you too
Unemployment,fowuvkd,t1_fowuopl,1588127655.0,I forgot what the thresh holds is for but its 17k  and above. I don‚Äôt think it affects it negatively though.

Unemployment,fovj9o9,t1_fovim76,1588102259.0,"You‚Äôre misunderstanding the question. PUA is new. First time in history. So if you filed between that period it would‚Äôve been a w2. I‚Äôm 1099 so no you‚Äôve never filed nor received benefits. 

If you put yes your telling them you filed with w2 and we‚Äôre either denied or approved."
Unemployment,fovhwh0,t1_fovhbcy,1588101597.0,No put no because that last claim you filed doesn't count. They mean like if youve filed a W2 form or have actually collected funds from UI. I put no

Unemployment,fov8kts,t1_fov8g0t,1588097148.0,It depends on tour situation too though maybe your situation is more complicated.
Unemployment,fov8b6k,t1_fov85uf,1588097020.0,If they open that up after July then no because that‚Äôs when the 600 ends unless they back pay you it but idk I applied for PUA because I‚Äôm a 1099 worker and I got approved.

Unemployment,fov26b8,t1_fov1ynt,1588094170.0,I don‚Äôt think you can double dip. You mean like get two separate claims one for UI and one for you PUA. If that what you‚Äôre referring to then no.

Unemployment,fouwag0,t1_fouw19b,1588091453.0,Yeah I think the w2 is more complicated for sure that most likely why. Well at least it didn‚Äôt crash on you
Unemployment,fouvxph,t1_fouqmaw,1588091288.0,No email. I clicked home and it said I had weeks to certify all the way up till February and they will send the emails later just so happens that I saw them before they could send emails about hem.
