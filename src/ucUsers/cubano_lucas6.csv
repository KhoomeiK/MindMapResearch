eu4,fplpdsu,t3_gdv1vm,1588716943.0,This does reveal how messed up the vanilla eu4 borders are
eu4,fp23qq2,t1_fp23hx7,1588254529.0,"Okay, that makes a lot of since then. A bit disappointed because that interrupts how I thought the mod flowed, but thanks for the help!"
eu4,fp22k6n,t1_fp1hh3h,1588253826.0,"That‚Äôs the wiki! And there‚Äôs my point exactly. I think I started around a 700 start date (can‚Äôt remember exactly), but there we go, G√∂kt√ºrks still around. So it‚Äôs a mod installation problem? I‚Äôm surprised because everything else works well and I got it from the steam workshop, but I‚Äôll reinstall"
MathHelp,fn778c5,t1_fn5hc2x,1586714642.0,That does help. I didn‚Äôt realise that those were related. Thanks!
AskARussian,fn3xe3c,t1_fn2j70k,1586629793.0,Yeah. Essentially that‚Äôs it.
berkeley,fn2fn89,t1_fn2fks1,1586587327.0,Ah well thank god you don‚Äôt think that anymore but also good point yeah
AskARussian,fn2fage,t1_fmz9zxy,1586586981.0,"Ah yes, the famous Ukrainian Rus lol. I just wonder how a supposedly 100% Mongolian-Tatar-Finnish nation would speak a Slavic language and have so much Slavic genesüßê"
berkeley,fn2f2xv,t1_fn2f0yl,1586586781.0,"I will be sure to take it.

Thanks for recommendation

Edit: soviet communism fell quickly into a mix of lowkey to sometimes high key Russian nationalism with the classic command ML economy. it is distinct from chinese or cuban communism for that matter. Sure academically speaking they‚Äôre all the same, but the Russians themselves will tell you that soviet communism is not the same from that which is supported by westerners"
berkeley,fn2f117,t1_fn1b790,1586586731.0,"Stalin began it. It continued under Khrushchyov and Brezhnev as Jewish people still were blacklisted for higher positions at universities or influential positions in civil society or government. It was violent under Stalin, and subtle under the latter two. That‚Äôs the only difference. –≠—Ç–æ –∏ 3 –ª–∏–¥–µ—Ä–∞, –∞ –Ω–µ –æ–¥–∏–Ω."

Soviet Communism sure was."

AskARussian,fn2dt04,t1_fmz1sg4,1586585555.0,"Like I mentioned, I‚Äôm a russian learner, and after awhile, russian textbooks and random articles get boring. I also happen to be interested in anthropology and finno-ugric peoples interest me. So a few years of google searches and realisation that despite the blatant Russophobia that Ukrainians do indeed speak Russian still, I‚Äôve become rather bitter towards them. It‚Äôs kind of ironic, since my grandfather is of Volhynian blood. 

But honestly I care more because they flood perfectly calm map pages on places like Instagram, or like say a Slavic appreciation page, with their annoying, false, and racist comments (yes. I would say the way they view Finno-Ugric, Siberian, and tungusic people is racist). Also their stupid maidan shit bugs me. It‚Äôs more just I‚Äôm fed up with Ukrainian keyboard people

Edit: I think I totally responded incorrectly thinking you were another commenter but I‚Äôm leaving this anyways"
AskARussian,fmz0ecd,t1_fmz0504,1586501749.0,"For the sake of not propagating infamous American interventionism, I‚Äôm not going to directly agree with that.

However I will say that there isn‚Äôt a single incorrect statement in what you said and should I not hold American citizenship I would wholly agree 

I agree"
AskARussian,fmyz5yu,t1_fmyx6j7,1586500507.0,Interesting

AskARussian,fmyxzxp,t1_fmyuson,1586499349.0,Probably the best explanation in all honesty
AskARussian,fmysvwq,t1_fmysm92,1586494763.0,"Well of course, I should clarify Ukrainian nationalists."
berkeley,fluhct0,t1_fltnxld,1585502619.0,Perfect. Thank you
