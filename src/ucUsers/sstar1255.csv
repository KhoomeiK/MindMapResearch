UCSD,fpaiksn,t3_gcaa40,1588448915.0,It’s definitely dependent on which class you take. Over all though summer isn’t to bad and most classes range from slightly easier to a little harder. It’s a little more homework all at once though. Some classes will lighten the homework load too.
ESOGuilds,fotmnqq,t3_g92obm,1588058754.0,I’d be definitely interested! I played on Xbox a few years back and am looking to jump back in on PC my discord is sstar07#9895
AmItheAsshole,foof0ip,t3_g8cq3t,1587937781.0,NTA at all. You’re a good girlfriend.
UCSD,folkqb7,t3_g7ro69,1587864340.0,"Thanks for this! 

Had a 90 minute exam where 15 min was spent taking pictures of my work and trying to embed an image in the text boxes"
AmItheAsshole,folck6z,t3_g7u2hu,1587859344.0,NTA but honestly you should break up. If you’re going to go much farther with this guy you’re going to have to become step mom with the kid. Or at least friendly and it sounds like yum you don’t really want that. (No judgement there just an observation).
MB2Bannerlord,foeb1dp,t3_g6kn39,1587699678.0,Take a castle then peace out with them. Then take another and peace out again. Also start recruiting nobles to your kingdom and when you have enough strength go ahead and fight them in a full out war.
UCSD,fnurr95,t3_g3xpkk,1587269379.0,You’re definitely not alone. Honestly I don’t really have any specific advice but definitely know that this whole thing is just temporary and we will all get through this. I’ve tried to find some things in my hobbies where I can feel progression.
sandiego,fn5ef60,t3_fzdf7k,1586662708.0,Thank you for what you’re doing!

lfg,fmo411x,t3_fwcajy,1586244587.0,"Hi I’d be down! I’m PST but that time still should work. 

My name is Logan and I’m 21! My discord is sstar07#9895"
lfg,fmo1d4r,t3_fwaz75,1586241855.0,"I really like that level 0 idea! Mid if I steal it for any future campaigns I run? 

Name: Logan (also I’m 21 and from so cal so time zone for me is PST) 

Simple character idea: I’d like to play a triton (around 27) with a criminal background. Decided to help smuggle/ steak goods at the dock with his unique skills. Definitely not an evil character was just young and dumb when he started his life of crime and now it’s all he knows. 

Class: would like to be a fighter. Ideal weapon would be a spear or short sword. (Eventual goal would be a trident)  light to medium armor. 

Favorite D&D memory: early on in my last campaign we were tasked with taking out a monstrous sized intelligent boar (like 20 feet tall monstrous) my wood elf ranger had shot an arrow that took out the beasts eye. 

Eventually we had the beast subdued and tied down to interrogate. My elf told the boar if he tries anything I’d have his other eye. 

Sure enough the beast breaks free of the ropes while two of our party members were going back to the road to alert the headsman we have the beast down. The beast knocks our bard on the ground and turned to my elf. I rolled a nat 20 and took the beasts other eye killing it. 

Honestly that’s the moment that hooked me in D&D"

3. I’ve played DnD for almost a year now (started last June haven’t played since October)

5. I’d like to be in your game for a few reasons. First I like your approach with combat. I really enjoy tactical and challenging combat. I also like that it has weight to it because anytime you’re fighting something and in danger that should feel like it means something. 

Secondly I am looking for a game with more serious role play. I like to put work into my characters backstory and get inside their head and find out what makes them tick and try to see the world through theirs eyes and I find that it is hard to do that when other players just kinda do what ever with out much thought or consistency within their character. 

Lastly, it sounds like you have a cool setting and put in lots of work with it. 

6. I’d like to play a character who grew up as a very popular and well liked kid in his village. In his mind he was the best thing the village had ever produced and when he was old enough joined the military. Everyone in the village came out to send him off when he left. 

While in the military he was badly wounded on one of his first combat encounters and spent the rest of his time as a soldier in a recovery tent. (Here either his deployment could end or he could be sent home due to his injuries) 

When he returns he finds that everyone has for all intents and purposes moved on and forgot about him. He realized that most of the people in the village had never really cared about him, he left the village in order to prove himself. 


That’s the very rough idea for the backstory. Would probably use the soldier background and would go most likely go with a fighter (would want to specialize more with lighter armor and a more dex based character). For race probably either a human or elf depending more on your setting. 

7. I’m free everyday except for Tuesday’s after 1 PST 



Thanks for the consideration!"
