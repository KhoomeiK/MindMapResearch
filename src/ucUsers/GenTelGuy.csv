UCSD,fplbxye,t1_fpl932z,1588709980.0,"I agree as someone done with the HUM sequence - it's terrible. Grades are a matter of TA generosity luck plus probably bias based on who the TA labels as the smart ones during discussion.

In HUM 1 I put in crazy hours and got Bs, and I am extremely confident that if I had doubled the amount of time I put into those essays I would still have gotten Bs. 

Then in Hum 2 I wrote worse essays but got As. 

Finally in Hum 3 I put in A-level work and got A grades, this was the only time my grade matched my opinion of my effort.

Then I took online community college classes for 4 and 5 and overall I think I learned more from them with maybe a quarter as much stress."
MMA,fpfkd3u,t1_fpfiqz9,1588573935.0,I'd say it's pretty common because tutorials involve a lot of copying and development is the opposite of copying. Not really any videos or sites I can give but I'd recommend taking snippets of the tutorial code you're already familiar with and using them to make something similar but not the same as what you make in the tutorials. That's a bit more like speaking the language than doing repetition exercises.
MMA,fpfi7dk,t1_fpfhgo1,1588572009.0,Sort of - it's good for picking up the basic syntax of a language. Once you're beyond that stage though it's more about practicing and implementing ideas you came up with yourself. Tutorials get you off the ground but won't make you a coder on their own.
InfiniteJest,fpfhai3,t3_gd4335,1588571222.0,"Great thing to bring up, this is a major highlight of the book in terms of writing quality and insight into human experience.

todayilearned,fpeysmp,t1_fpexn0f,1588557882.0,"C++ is definitely a programming language but it's weird if someone has a ""C++ degree"" because the normal thing is for a degree to be in Computer Science, Information Technology, Computer Engineering, and so forth. 

C++ is a complex language but anyone with a Computer Science degree should be able to build useful stuff in C++, Java, Python, etc so it's weird to have a degree specifically designated around C++."
UCSD,fpew94a,t3_gd10sz,1588556308.0,"I'll take the extreme position here - group projects should just stop period. It's ridiculous that people can get carried or dragged down depending on the luck of who they get paired with. 

And no, group projects are not ""preparation for the real world"". I work at a top tech company and while I wouldn't say everyone is perfect, everyone is at minimum capable of contributing usefully. Plus there's a manager who has a serious stake in your productive output.

Contrast that with CSE 110 where I had someone on my team who didn't know how to install Git or Vim. Him not knowing this instantly let me know it would be faster and less frustrating to just do any given work item myself than to hand-hold him through the motions of it. 

The dynamics of group projects aren't healthy at all and typically put extra burden on the most serious/capable students in the group while the students who don't understand the material fall even further behind. Group projects should be mostly if not entirely discontinued."

SmashBrosUltimate,fpcaxfu,t3_gcm85b,1588493725.0,"Watch Sonix vs. Tweek in the recent online tournament. Out of 4 games in the set 3 went to timeout (3 stock 7 min) and in one game both players had two stocks when time expired. 

Not only is it boring camping with the sonic players refusing to engage on anything but the most favorable terms, but it's a low-skill low-interactivity situation where the non-Sonic player is essentially in a battle not with the opposing player but with the range,  targeting, and frame data of Sonic's homing attack. 

No, I can't load up Sonic and instantly get into Elite. Auto-target isn't literally a win button but the fact is it's a matchup uniquely devoid of player-player interaction in a game that derives its fun from exactly that."

 > Pemulis' older brother was raped by his father as a child. So was the comatose sister of one unnamed Boston AA speaker. Avril Incandenza seemingly has John Wayne role-play as Orin while they have sex. 

I remember the ""fook in the boom"" scene but I didn't see any connection to Pemulis, I thought it was completely random and have no idea how they determined it was Pemulis' brother.

* Life experiences - Doing a difficult and rigorous college major, having an intellectually-demanding job with its own brand of annoyances to yammer about at the end of a workday.
