EltonJohn,fpaof5i,t1_fpadzg2,1588452365.0,"I would hope so too, but I suspect that Charlie met with Elton the day before his post. I follow Charlie, and he had two IG stories of him wearing the same outfit (brown tee and white long sleeves) that were uploaded like 15-20 hours before the Elton post. So, I'd say it's too coincidental for him to be wearing the same clothes in his stories and post in less than 24 hours..."

Think of the greater effects -- how that kid will feel, how other kids like them will feel. It could be so much more meaningful and memorable to them than an able-bodied person. Of course, it doesn't mean that people should parade around someone in hopes to get PC points, when that person isn't helped as much as, say, the school's appearance.

Or hey, maybe we able-bodied folks listen to what disabled folks want instead of jumping to conclusions. They know themselves much better than we do."

Fidelity,fogy4lf,t1_fo764j3,1587758317.0,Agreed. Adding more funds often just adds overlap and may actually bring you farther from your actual desired market cap ratios. Diversity in the number of funds doesn't matter as much as the contents of the funds themselves.
UCSD,fofs9ms,t1_foekr9k,1587741923.0,"Ikr? I remember my professor several months ago saying something along the lines about how a record low of people in my major were going to grad school, and how most people were going into the job market because ""the economy is strong."" Well, this sucks for all of us.

Not only am I bummed because of greater competition, but also because of likely smaller financial packages."

socialskills,fo5rlb8,t3_g5v8nm,1587533512.0,"I'm sorry, that's a sucky situation you're in. You should tell him something along the lines of what you wrote here. He probably doesn't mean to hurt you if he considers you his friend; he's just oblivious that you're hurting, so you should communicate that.

Remind him that you care about him and that he's important to you. Explain how his actions make you feel. Most importantly, give him suggestions on what he can do better moving forward. Whether that's bringing his friends up less, paying more attention to how you feel, etc, make sure you are constructive in your response. 

Good luck!"
socialskills,fo4vw6y,t1_fo4qmqm,1587512249.0,"Whatever your actions are, whether in the name of self-care or otherwise, you cannot invalidate that this other person has been hurt because of your actions. 

Apologizing is such an important communication and socialization tool, especially when you're talking to someone who is *important* to you (like OP and their boyfriend). 

You may be ""nurturing your mental state,"" which obviously is good for yourself, but it's important to acknowledge (and apologize) that this is at the expense of someone else's feelings/health.

I'm *not* saying that you should totally disregard your own feelings and actions in favor of another person. I'm saying that you should acknowledge that your actions can have both benefits and consequences, especially when they affect someone else. 

Then, as I wrote, it's just as important that you explain yourself. How can we understand and help each other if we don't have proper communication?"
socialskills,fo4ccmm,t1_fo3zaik,1587501899.0,"Agreed. Some comments on this thread are concerning (""You did nothing wrong""), when we really shouldn't jump to those conclusions with barely any context. 

Anyways, OP should have a clear and fair conversation with their friend. Here's what I suggest:

1) Apologize for making them feel that way. Whether you're in the ""right"" or ""wrong,"" they are still hurt by you.
2) Explain your actions, but don't excuse your actions. 
3) Ask them what you can do better for them. 
4) Suggest to them what they can do better for you.

Hopefully you both get something out of this. It's up to both of you to communicate what's wrong."

Guilty of quarantine therapy shopping, but I'm very happy with the fit and design. I've been wanting a nice brown leather watch that wasn't too feminine and more gender-neutral, and this worked for me because I have very small wrists. I'm hoping to keep this one for a long time :) I do miss the convenience of a digital watch (plus having the date and day of the week, as well as a light up button, on my Casio), but I'll live!
