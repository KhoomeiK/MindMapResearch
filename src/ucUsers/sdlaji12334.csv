UCSD,fowxe36,t3_ga130h,1588129213.0,What's the average grade in that class?
nextfuckinglevel,fooiaa6,t1_fooggkm,1587939501.0,"Not really, random events like these are highly variable"
UCSD,foenpit,t1_foek85d,1587708856.0,Ohh well that changes things! If you're in a lab or have a sort of faculty mentor I'd recommend talking to the faculty about what coursework they like to see completed prior to going into grad school! (E.g. mine having recommends having a solid stats background)
UCSD,foene70,t1_foefa3e,1587708586.0,Haha same. Though I do wish he gave us more coding to do ðŸ˜…
UCSD,foefy48,t3_g70xg4,1587702806.0,"If you can afford staying in college long enough to do that, why not just go for a post-bac and work as an RA instead? I feel like you would get more out of it over taking random GPA boosters and it might look better to grad schools"
UCSD,foef56q,t3_g71g2q,1587702252.0,What do you think of 118c so far??
UCSD,fodcn6s,t3_g6v60s,1587683009.0,Part time student workers are getting 62 hours of admin leave there?? That's triple what I got (working in the library)
UCSD,fnq9dnb,t1_fnnyrej,1587160208.0,"""She hasn't communicated much to us the past three weeks"" 

She's literally communicated to us once, through an announcement about NIA before NIA was able to be downloaded, and that's it"

That goes over how to calculate capacitive currents. I'm also in 107a w/ Boyle right now and I'm pretty sure the only way to survive in this class is to self-study at this point..."
UCSD,fn28is6,t1_fn26vg9,1586580860.0,"Hi, I'm a CogSci major and I would say that, honestly, there's not that many other jobs paths for CogSci besides academia. Aside from that though, if you want to go into design (UX/UI), the design specialization is one of the best places to be in UCSD! Also, you do have the option to do data science however I would highly recommend just switching to data science if so. One reason that people are in CogSci is if they are pre-med/health.  Specifically for Neuro or CBN specialization you end up with a pretty solid GPA padding for med schools but you do have to take all the med school requirements (e.g. ochem). 

One last thing is that CogSci is a very diverse major and there's a lot of paths you can take with it if you are winning to put in the extra work for it! I'm personally hoping to go into academia so if you're ever interested in that I can tell you about that."
