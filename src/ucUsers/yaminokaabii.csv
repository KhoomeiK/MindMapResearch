childfree,fpmschz,t1_fpmqt40,1588740430.0,"> then he freaked out and yelled at me and cried and was all like “is this what you wanted?” 

It sounds like he's afraid. Afraid of what exactly, I can't say; I don't know him, of course. Maybe afraid of losing his partner, or afraid of being alone again, or afraid of not being able to handle work *and* raising his kid. I say all this not to guilt or shame you, but to bring up some possibilities to hopefully understand him better.

> Any time we argue he puts the blame on me like “why do you have to do this?” Or “why do you have to turn this into something?”

I suspect this is from some unhealthy ingrained past ways of communicating. A.k.a.: it's probably *not* 100% his fault that he phrases it that way. But you need to let him know that this is hurting you, for there to be any chance of him changing.

> But yes I would love the name of that book bc idk if I suck at communicating or if he’s just being manipulative. (He’s so good at making it seem like he’s not being manipulative tho, like it’s for the sake of his kid so I should be more accommodating)

The book is called Nonviolent Communication. IMO it's a bad title--what the author defines as ""violent"" communication is any communication that intends to cause negative feelings: blaming, shaming, etc. And using NVC helps you lay out your feelings and your needs so you can get them met. You can [buy the book on Amazon for $16](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Marshall-Rosenberg/dp/1892005034), or you can get the audiobook, or sail the high seas to get it free.

Now, I'll admit that from the second comment, your situation sounds even worse than I thought. What I'm thinking is that *everyone* can stand to communicate better (*very few* people talk with perfect NVC all the time)... but he is still more at fault than you are. Of course, I only have your side of the story, but you're suffering a lot here. Fortunately, NVC can also allow you to ask questions and empathize in a way that encourages *him* to share his feelings and why he acts the way he does, even if he doesn't read the book. I really think this can help.

Good luck, and also feel free to talk to me about it more :)"

> I purposefully don’t date single dads but didn’t want to give something up just bc a kid was involved. He downplayed it like it wouldn’t be that big of a deal.

He downplayed the fact that he had a kid. Would you be okay with him downplaying other things too, like the moving closer to bio-mom or the wanting you to take care of his kid?

> He is determined to move three hours away to be closer to the biological mother for his kids sake, and expects me to move with him without really asking if I wanted to (he brought it up to his kid with me in the car he said “how would you feel about us moving to ___” and his kid said he’d like that.)

Say that, hypothetically, you're okay with this particular move and everything works out great. But what if later the bio-mom wants to move to a new city? Or rural bumfuck nowhere? Or a whole different country? Would you be okay with your partner wanting to follow her again?

> when I got a job interview he verbalized that’s he hoped I didn’t get the job so id have more time to watch after his kid while he worked.

This is the most alarming part of your post for me. YOU want the job. HE wants you to take care of his kid. HE wants you NOT to get the job. There aren't many other ways you can interpret his words other than a blatant disrespect of YOUR WISHES. Would you be okay with him continuing to say things like this?

> when I tried talking to my bf his actions/words he basically told me it will always be this way

""Always""!! He even says it himself!

Now, I am NOT telling you to immediately break up with him. But these are serious issues and I am telling you to sit him down and have a serious conversation with him about all of these. Lay down all your feelings and your needs and see if he's willing to meet you there. I can also recommend you a book on compassionately communicating these ideas."

Regarding *her* not being able to communicate her needs: I remember reading that it's okay because you'll still be able to empathize, ask questions, etc. to help draw that out. (The [box on page 32 of the author speaking to an angry man in a workshop](https://imgur.com/yrDITwm) convinced me of that.) That is, of course, if she is willing to engage. If you give NVC your best shot and still get nothing, small comfort though it may be, you can at least be confident that you really did try.

SeriousConversation,fpi8blb,t1_fphz18q,1588635681.0,"That's not quite what I mean--I'm sure that you've been compassionate. Lemme try to explain. The book I'm referring to is called [Nonviolent Communication](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Marshall-Rosenberg/dp/1892005034). I don't like how the title implies *physical* or threatening violence, like yelling and insults and such, which is why I phrase it as compassionate communication. But what the author means by ""violent"" is any language that would place judgment on other people or otherwise try to force them to feel negative emotions. Here's a quick example:

> You don't text me often enough. I deserve to be treated better than this.

* ""Often enough"" can mean different things to you and her. She might reflexively think, ""I don't feel like texting back that often."" Or, ""Screw that! I'm not obligated to text you at all."" Or, ""I didn't know you were so needy.""   
* Same for ""deserving"" to be treated ""better"". Language like this can put people on the defensive and make them feel anything from shame to anger.  

Instead, nonviolent communication may look like:

> You haven't texted me a single time in the last 3 months. I care about you a lot and I feel sad that we've lost the connection we used to have.

* If she looks back at the text conversations, it's literally impossible to argue the fact that she has spent 3 months not texting you. That is a verifiable fact.  
* Simply stating your feelings is similar: it's just what you felt. It's just putting everything on the table, and leaving it to her to respond.

From an example or two it seems easy, but the exercises in the book show that it's actually *pretty damn hard* to recognize violent communication and use NVC instead. Even something like ""I'm scared that you don't trust me"" is still attributing that judgment to the other person--maybe they completely trust you and other factors caused the behavior. Hence, reading the book.

The book itself is 200 pages, but it's a *tiny* book--each page is about 2.5 paragraphs--and moreover the main process is covered by the first 60 or so pages already. It's $11 on Amazon as I linked above, and it's also on the high seas--you can be reading the ebook in 5 minutes. It's helped me a lot, anyway. Well, it still won't help if she doesn't actually read your messages or if she's somehow committed to never replying again ever, but I still think it's worth a shot. If nothing else, it'll help you in your other relationships as well."

(Is this accurate? If any of this isn't quite right, do let me know; I'd love to hear it.)

But it's also good to consider what OP might be feeling right now. She's already been crying about her own situation before posting it on Reddit, and it took a lot of courage for her to be this vulnerable already. She might not feel comfortable or ready to go *this* much in depth about herself for the purpose of helping your situation--even though you're in pain--everyone's gotta work on themself first, y'know? My guess is that these parts specifically were her trying to gently tell you that she doesn't feel quite ready to respond to your questions:

> But I don't wanna go into details, since it's TMI.

Even the ""smaller"" things on the list are fine, they're *something*. Take those 3-5 activities and write them down on a sheet of paper, leaving some space between em. Do this right now!! Write down the general goals for each of them. Then think of something specific, tangible, and small to accomplish for each of them. ""I want to sing"" becomes ""I want to sing my favorite song on pitch, clearly."" ""I want to whittle"" becomes ""I want to carve a dog."" ""I want to cook/bake"" becomes ""I want to make Indian curry/cherry pie."" Etc. Basically, you want a version of that finished project to work towards. Writing down another, bigger project idea for later is *probably* okay, but be careful to focus on something you can really accomplish. Keep your eyes on the prize, motivation up, and don't get lost in fantasy because it's easier than actually putting jn the work (common problems for me).

Okay, got that list of activities, general goals, and specific goals? Good, now send a scanned image to me, as well as your driver's license, a copy of your birth certificate, your mother's mother's cousin's maiden name, a picture of your gf while she's dancing, and your dental records from ages 5-10.

Kidding, of course. But the next step is the hardest part.

Pick *one* activity from the list, and start it ***right now***.

You're not doing anything else, right? If you're anything like me, you've spent the last 2 hours shitting around on Reddit? The Internet is your friend. The Internet is everyone's friend and tool if they know how to use it. Pick a promising blog, pick a YouTube channel with a pretty face, or just look up the basic-ass WikiHow page—and get going! Find out what materials you need, then find out what (open) stores have em, or order them online. Today. Right now. Figure out what your first step is when you do get them. When you get them, do the first step. It's that simple. It might not be easy, but it's simple. **Do the thing.**

""Oh, I'll get to it in a couple minutes—"" ""I'll just finish up this first—"" ""Oh but I'll look up more stuff first—"" ""But it sounds hard—"" ""But I wanna—"" But—"" No. **Fuck you.** ***Do the thing.*** In kinder and more logical words, everyone's lizard brain/subconscious is stuck to their habits like cheese stretching off a pizza slice. It helps save energy because your conscious brain is literally powering down and not working. Clearly, it's bad news for us folks who actually want to make a change. That's why you need to START. Our unconscious minds take only 5 seconds to make a snap judgment about whether or not we do something, so you need to decide in those 5 seconds to **do the thing.** I learned this from a great bestof post that included a link to a TEDx talk, I'd be happy to find that again if you want. But if so, I want you to jump right off the post into **doing your chosen thing.**

Dude, at this point I'm rooting for you more than for myself! You got this!!

CasualConversation,fopu5ss,t3_g8unk5,1587972235.0,"Similar to you, wanted a summer job... only, I'm a graduating college senior and the programs I wanna get into are quite hard without real work experience. Sighhhh. Hopefully they'll understand that it's this hard everywhere.

Was going to go to 2 concerts back in March. Music is life, &c., but I only really started to go to concerts last October-ish, and raves/EDM festivals in January this year. I really wanted to see Tame Impala, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (psych rock) and Excision (dubstep)... only started listening to them in January as well. Knocked right out. Of course. Online music streams and ""virtual festivals"" are nice, but totally not the same. At least I procrastinated buying tickets so I didn't have to jump through hoops for refunds? 

Similarly, I didn't really research any, but I know I wanted to go to some actual outdoor music festivals in summer. Stuff might pick back up in October... *might*. I'm not so sure. This is gonna sound total depresso, but I believe the virus/shelter-in-place is gonna last through the end of the year. And if not, I'll be *very* happy, and run right back out to the karaoke bar--that I decided against checking out *2 days* before they brought down the lockdown hammer.

So sorry about the Happy Fits concert being taken down too.... Here's hoping."
