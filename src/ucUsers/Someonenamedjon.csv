Not sure if you're already doing it, but I noticed the thing that tripped me up was my back foot (the one that ends up in front after the pivot) was not pointed toward the tail. After I adjusted my back foot to point toward the tail I was able to land them!"

UCSD,fopndtn,t1_fopl47t,1587966246.0,"I'm not tryina seem like an asshat, but it isn't supposed to be a walk in the park. His exams are very reasonable IMHO, they are easier than the homework questions & he even goes over some really, really similar examples in the lecture before the exam. Half the MC are usually quiz questions as well, which you're able to look at since they're part of Canvas. Plus you do get to drop 2 out of 5 of the exams. 

Personally I'm not a fan of the videos so I just take notes on the textbook readings, but like you, I have the advantage of having taken 2 physics classes in high school (which were **not** easy by any means--I had a notoriously difficult teacher--but in retrospect it has made this class a lot easier for me)."

longboarding,fnurpyg,t1_fnuq8r0,1587269355.0,"Couple of weeks, been doing only glove down ones, goal is to be able to do shut down slides so I can bomb bigger hills. 

Running a top 39"" top mount with Caliber 2s, 65mm Hoots, and some Vicious grip so I don't think it's my setup holding me back.

When I do heel sides I find that I'm able to break traction but only for moment; if I try to hold it out longer I end up high siding a lot.

For my toe sides I definitely feel more comfortable since I don't high side on those as easily, but I usually end up just doing tight turns instead of really sliding.

I think me having noodle arms isn't helping either ðŸ˜‚

Needa way to film myself smh"
longboarding,fnuofs3,t1_fnukz7g,1587267012.0,the bushings definitely made carving a ton better but still having trouble with those slides ðŸ˜©
