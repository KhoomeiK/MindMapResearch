Though I suppose it's impossible to actually prove anything given what's essentially magic and alternate dimensions."

German,fp3co75,t3_gas0rm,1588277004.0,"Ich empfehle gern ""Corpus Delicti"" oder ""Unterleuten"" von Juli Zeh!

Beide fand ich fesselnd und sehr modern, fast nichts wie die Klassiker."
UCSantaBarbara,fp396o6,t1_fp35jrx,1588275273.0,"You approach real-world situations with different expectations than you would an academic exam. Of course people are aware and take into consideration that not everything has a perfect resolution in real life. Nobody normally expects to find unsolvable questions in a test, because that's not what they're for.

And as an aside, tough is in no way equivalent to intentionally rigged to fail. Whenever I take tests, I place my trust in the professor and the fact that the questions are within the limits of class material, and in good faith."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fp317sm,t1_fp2vqpj,1588271347.0,"Leider muss ich zustimmen.

I'd even say that there's been a gradual shift away from the more classically Germanic-sounding words towards Latinate alternatives and loanwords. Which really is a shame, because I think it's beautiful once you understand how the prefixes like ver-, ur- be- modify existing words while being logically consistent.

I'd say examples are like 'Fastfood vs Schnellimbiss', 'Wirklichkeit vs Realit√§t'.
 
Whether that's due to the increasing spread of English in general, the Nazi associations, or a mix of both, I can't say."
UCSantaBarbara,fp2xssa,t1_fp2v09y,1588269677.0,"Honestly, I don't accept ""the real world"" as justification at all. While it may be true that the real world is imperfect and unreasonable, there's no excuse to just accept that and go along with it without even trying to take the most sensible route.

I obviously haven't seen this test, but if the time offered was the same as any normal test without any bait, then I'd say that students definitely have been disadvantaged, although that might be equalized with the curve.

The bigger problem for me is that that this tactic will eventually become commonplace (a few comments here say it's happened at multiple places), and then we'd have to start reading the papers looking for loaded questions. That, in my mind, is a fundamental change in the dynamic of exams, and is not something to be done unilaterally. The purpose of the exam was to evaluate understanding of a certain subject, and not to play mind games.

Of course, I don't mean to say cheaters should be given free reign. I believe the best solution is to design the exams to be open-book, open-everything."

UCSantaBarbara,fo12vr7,t3_g5143l,1587424652.0,"Honestly, that's just how it was for both 6AL and 6BL for me. No matter how much I tried to include everything, I'd never get anything more than a 12/15 on lab reports, with points always being taken off for some seemingly arbitrary reason.

I learned to just look at the section average instead of the raw score. As long as you're close to it, it's all good."
AskReddit,fnv805k,t1_fnv52sd,1587283425.0,"If you're playing on PC, there's a mod that doubles the value of all war assets to compensate for the 50% readiness rating.

It's also technically possible to get 3100 effective strength for the best ending without changing the readiness at all, although you'd have to go out of your way and collect all the assets you can."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fmriz5s,t1_fmrhjtw,1586324642.0,"I have to admit that Capitalism and Freedom was quite informative to read, and that I'm glad to have gone through it even if I wasn't really looking to reaffirm or debunk anything.

I guess I just find the economic axis of the compass to be most interesting and try to cover both ends of the spectrum."
