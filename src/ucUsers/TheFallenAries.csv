GirlGamers,fp8vnlx,t1_fp8sruz,1588404571.0,"Thank you so much for all of the recs ♡ I've definutely tried a few of them, like pokemon (my favorites are any of the Sinnoh region games, but mainly Diamond) and fire emblem, so I'm sure I'll adore the rest of the games you've mentioned, as long as I can manage to pick them up ^.^"
GirlGamers,fp8qt8t,t1_fp8qg2n,1588399982.0,"Ooh, thank you! And I'd love any JRPG recommendations, I've been seeing a few float around (things lile Chrono Trigger and Radiant Historia seem to be popular)"
GirlGamers,fp8hhj5,t3_gbm89h,1588392422.0,"I love that someone tested this, and I find myself wanting to share this with literally every gamer I know"
AmItheAsshole,fp5iw7k,t3_gazsjh,1588330998.0,"YTA. If I was dating someone like you, you'd be dropped so fast. Really? You're going to choose your anger over a video game over your girlfriend? And how is learning to play the song on her guitar even a problem? A lot of people are inspired to make music because of video game soundtracks. I mean, the first time I played a song on the piano, and the only song I learned (and consequently forgot, lol) was the Mii music from the Wii. Get over yourself, hopefully she'll drop you and have more time to get back her progress in the game."

UCSantaBarbara,fp0ikwz,t3_gad7tb,1588209990.0,"I've never seen anyone shamed for their appearance on campus, albeit I am only a first year. I find that everyone is extremely welcoming and non-judgemental, and we'd be glad to have you ^.^"
UCSantaBarbara,fotknuu,t1_foo958f,1588056902.0,Why yall gonna dislike this because they did good? Proud of you <3 keep up the good work!
UCSantaBarbara,fotkka1,t3_g8mmns,1588056809.0,"That sounds lit! I'm lowkey dying at home with zero social interaction, and I'm sure many others are too"
UCSantaBarbara,fotkenj,t1_fosu3a4,1588056668.0,"To be honest, I thought working at the dining commons was way better than working out in town. I worked at DLG, which was right next to my dorm, so it was literally two minutes to walk down and get ready for work. I will say that it is extremely easy to pickup shifts if you need extra cash, and if you pay attention and work hard its a relatively easy job. I would honestly highly recommend it, but thats mainly because I enjoyed it so much"
UCSantaBarbara,fotk5ih,t3_g96dgd,1588056437.0,"My TA gives really good feedback on discussions, so I'm feeling pretty lucky with that. Quizzes have been iffy, but I haven't actual gotten any lab report grades in, and that's terrifying."

UCSantaBarbara,fo58evf,t3_g46rhp,1587519760.0,"I'm not coping well lol. Yesterday alone I spent nine hours working and studying. Everyday feels like a grind, albeit I do my best to finish everything before the weekend so I can take a few days to catch my breathe. Classes really aren't playing this quarter, that's for sure. Currently studying for two midterms tomorrow, at 8 am and 9:30 am T.T"

GirlGamers,fny0cbs,t3_g47pmp,1587350371.0,This is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen ♡.♡ i can't get over the giant Tubbs and the Ouija canvas
UCSantaBarbara,fn3teq9,t1_fmz13yp,1586627551.0,"I agree! The lectures are really easy to understand, and its nice that you can pause them and go back and listen to explanations again. The section and labs I find are pretty simple as well, just a worksheet for each!"
AnimalCrossing,fmyi1if,t1_fmxt5hz,1586486664.0,"If you do make a video, please link it! Your town looks super pretty ^.^ did you have a theme when you were making it?"
UCSantaBarbara,fmv342f,t3_fxhz2l,1586404879.0,"Yeah, I'm taking 18 and it definitely feels like a lot. One of my classes has been forty pages of textbook alone each week X.X"
GirlGamers,fmm1nzm,t3_fvj4zd,1586197134.0,"I'll definitely add you on Overwatch ^.^ and honestly, there's no problem with not being the best out there. As long as you're having a good time and you're a good sport, I'm happy ^.^"
AmItheAsshole,fmm0agp,t3_fvjlnt,1586196410.0,"NTA. Lol, stop by to bring him lunch."
AmItheAsshole,fmie8hg,t1_fmi8ikq,1586107829.0,"Im gonna be real for a second. I've been a lot more involved with female gaming communities in the past year, and a lot of the time they don't like to play FPS games because they can get a lot of sexism there. I personally haven't had many issues (Overwatch is good to me), but I have plenty of friends who have. That being said, referring to someone as guy, man, or dude, or anything along those lines, at least in my life, doesn't imply gender that person's gender. It's moreso used as a way to refer to that person rather than using their name, but again, that's just my experience."
