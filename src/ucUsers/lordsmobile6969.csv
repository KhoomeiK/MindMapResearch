I know it must be hard on yourself emotionally and physically but I think I speak for everyone when I say, I want you to stay optimistic.

premed,fof9j5y,t3_g708dl,1587730387.0,"It‚Äôs not that O chem is inherently very difficult.

I think that since we're here to learn the goal of the schools should be to teach us, not try and trip us up"

This is aggravating to the point where it leaves me speechless... and these are the same people that brag about the greatness of America as a country and the sacrifices that their ancestors made to make this country a better place. I mean, can you imagine people asking to be ‚Äúfreed from the lame factory jobs and brutal hours of work‚Äù during WW2? These people boast that they are patriots and ‚Äúfree‚Äù but they can‚Äôt even sacrifice stepping outside for the betterment of their country."
ucla,fnsizsk,t3_g3hvk5,1587222611.0,"I personally prefer the tactility of paper and the ability to do anything you want with it. I have used the iPad with the Apple pencil before but it just doesn't feel like real paper. The pen is too smooth -- frictionless -- on the screen and it can get annoying sometimes, since the pen isn't putting down words exactly as you write them. But, if you are someone who doesn't really have a problem with that, then by all means, go for an I pad. It saves paper, it's compact, and it has many other things you can do with it. But I think you should go try it out before you make a decision"

But Cornell CAN be depressing and difficult, so it's really your choice. Plus, look at the difference in the city: Ithaca vs DC. Campus size, Cornell is much bigger -- which means there are more things to do on campus but GW is in DC, so that's could be a plus too. Look especially at international student programs, in lieu of your interest in international relations -- Cornell is probably better at those. But I've  heard GW sometimes has people from the house and Senate come in and lecture so take that as you may."
