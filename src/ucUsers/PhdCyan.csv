Even if what you say about the 40 people recovering is true (which it most likely is), it still does not lend too much support for the drug as 2 weeks is the normal recovery time for the virus, and having all 40 people to recover from the virus is easy to attain given sampling error.
This is 100% big if true, we just need more data."
