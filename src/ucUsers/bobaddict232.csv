OrganicChemistry,fp0i8v9,t1_fp0crzy,1588209799.0,"We had to identify our starting materials (the aldehyde & amine). The brominated ring had a methyl attached to it & the amine was the amino group & methyl on a ring, so I THINK I got it. Thank you for your concern :) I wish I could send pictures bc I can never be too confident w/ this material ðŸ˜…"
ucr,fp07n6u,t3_gaimy8,1588204006.0,"congrats on your acceptances! I was in the EXACT same boat as you actually, & I obviously decided on UCR just because I decided to put off loans for dental school. As a commuter, I thought it would be pretty hard to make friends, but ended up meeting 3 of my best friends. One of them lives on campus, so she lets me crash when Iâ€™m too tired to commute, which tbh, can get TIRING depending on where youâ€™re coming from. I wish I could tell you to visit both campuses & choose which one just feels better for you, but Ik thatâ€™s impossible w/ the given situation. I would also take into consideration the living costs of San Diego, bc itâ€™s pretty pricey there"
OrganicChemistry,fp06j5k,t1_fp05m5e,1588203416.0,"thank you! I was able to deduce this from your advice on my last post too :) Iâ€™m just not so confident about the Br, but I donâ€™t want too post a bunch of lab questions on here"
OrganicChemistry,foxtqxh,t1_foxsht4,1588155989.0,thank you for your input :) I love the certainty too! Was debating this w/ my friends for almost 3 hours & didnâ€™t have a clear conclusion yet
OrganicChemistry,foxlol9,t1_foxjy0q,1588147964.0,"Unfortunately, it was all they gave us so I canâ€™t zoom in :/ we werenâ€™t provided an IR either which kind of sucks"
ucr,fov06n4,t1_fouxfpl,1588093245.0,omg tysm this is a great start to my day :)
ucr,fouwkah,t1_fouvpkd,1588091578.0,wait no way really??? I was expecting like $50 minimum depending on our taxes
ucr,fn11hwu,t3_fyms9l,1586552915.0,"Thereâ€™s no discussion for it. Just the lab which is linked to it, not its own unit"
ucr,fmoznog,t1_fmorq5s,1586271616.0,Was this for genetics or bio 5b???
ucr,fmnlf1d,t1_fmmzw8n,1586228802.0,"I canâ€™t recall him curving much compared to A & B. was a lot more conceptual for him & when he did have calculations, I usually struggled"
ucr,fmmmbaz,t3_fw5l4o,1586207901.0,"Depends on your professor. From easiest to hardest for me: A,B, C.

I had bartels for 1A & got an A-. Even though ratemyprof says heâ€™s hard, he curved so much (for 1A!!) that you needed ~40% for a C-. He reuses questions on midterm 2 from midterm 1 & actually follows his hw problems...only annoying part was clicker qâ€™s 

I had Quan Cheng for 1B. He does curve & has so many EC opportunities. I got a B+, & I couldâ€™ve done better if I managed my time better between bio, chem, English, & calculus

I had Jiang De en for C & got a B-. I just found his accent a bit heavy & his practice  problems were so different imo"
ucr,fmja8i5,t1_fmj79k3,1586126192.0,The music class seems to be a bit tacky/tedious now that itâ€™s online. We have hw through some online thing & a final paper
