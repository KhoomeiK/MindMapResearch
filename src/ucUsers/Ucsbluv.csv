UCSantaBarbara,fnawh6q,t3_g05cys,1586805043.0,Okay I’m in this class and think you should delete this lol.  Ngl I’m also frustrated by the time limit but I feel like this post is just roasting the professor for no reason when he’s been nothing but nice to us :((
UCSantaBarbara,fn7msz8,t1_fn5sin3,1586723460.0,I just think they should be honest about being able to see who did it in the future. Not going to get anyone in trouble for it tho
UCSantaBarbara,fn6xt9u,t1_fn6pfft,1586709443.0,No he said he saw that I did the survey
UCSantaBarbara,fn5qecq,t1_fn5pj6o,1586672383.0,"Valid concerns about the course but I was so blunt.  I wish I would’ve worded it way nicer lol, I sounded like kind of a bitch"
UCSantaBarbara,fn5onny,t1_fn5ocqn,1586670812.0,Honestly considered it after that hahah I feel so bad
UCSantaBarbara,fn5nx4s,t1_fn5ntej,1586670179.0,"Not going to expose the the professor like that bc I’m sure he had good intentions, but just wanted to warn anyone else from sending super honest feedback if this changes things."
UCSantaBarbara,fn1mzdb,t1_fn1mju5,1586565500.0,Oh no :( wow I suck for just now realizing this
UCSantaBarbara,fmn3ee3,t1_fmn32q3,1586217367.0,"Yeah it sucks. My only hope right now is none of the other UC’s have announced fall is online, so maybe we won’t either?"
UCSantaBarbara,flul3d8,t1_flukqx3,1585504778.0,Ok that a actually makes sense then. Thank you 🙏
