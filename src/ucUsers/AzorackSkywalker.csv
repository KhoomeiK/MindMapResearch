So if we actually full-on shut down, like telling everyone to acquire 2 weeks of food, get to a shelter (use empty dorms/hotels), or quarantine between your place of business and your home if you are seriously essential (nuclear plant techs, medical professionals, that level), then it would be eradicated, and we would open it up after that month.

In the real world, we would wait for a vaccine to open up again, which will take around a year, perhaps not “optimistic” as you said, more like “realistic” and “evidence-based”. And in the meantime we would have various levels of lockdowns and quarantines based on the severity of local outbreaks. So in the real world, it would take perhaps a year or 2 to fully reopen. 

Nobody wants it to stay closed forever, or to have lockdown for long stretches. But we have to be smart now, because it is so incredibly pointless to prolong this pandemic because we got uncomfortable."

The real hard part with naming comes with more complex molecules, and this app probably is going to be more useful for people who are learning naming for the first time than people looking for a database or a way to keep up their knowledge."
