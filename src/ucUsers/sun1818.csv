If a student chooses to take fall semester off will they then lose their housing spot for Spring?  I wonder if that would be a way for them to try to get students to stay online for Fall ie) you can keep your housing spot for spring, but you have to stay enrolled in fall semester classes.  Hope that is not the case though"
umass,fo5g7ly,t3_g5j64v,1587524882.0,Are you a senior in high school?  If so I might have your guidance counselor try intervening in this situation. I know of a situation where a student did not file something correctly during the application process (for another college) and the counselor got involved. I would contact your guidance counselor and ask if he or she think they might be able to be helpful to you in this situation. Hopefully UMass will be understanding of the mistake especially in these times.  Wishing you all the best
