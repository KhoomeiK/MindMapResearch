ucla,fomcbvo,t1_folyuyc,1587884981.0,I heard very good things about transfer experience dorms back in the day. Go for that if possible. You're more inclined to get a fellow transfer roommate that way.
ucla,foiip3b,t1_foihfqq,1587787611.0,"Pick your school based on cultural fit and professional opportunities for what you want to accomplish in your career and life at large rather than school prestige. 

At this point, UCLA and Berkeley are the 1A and 1B of best public schools in the country so you can do no wrong if you're picking solely based on prestige. But again, I think you should place more weight on factors other than brand name."
ucla,foii8mx,t1_foihghu,1587787285.0,"If I had visited UCSD before SIRing, that's the school I would have attended. I think I would have related to UC Socially Dead's culture better. Lol

At the end of the day, UCLA, being in LA, afforded me professional opportunities that I couldn't have pursued otherwise, so I'm happy with how things turned out. No regrets."
ucla,foige12,t1_fohp64j,1587786022.0,"Basically what the other person said. 

Figure out what your career goals are early into your college career and tinker your development to fit said goal. 

Can't stress this enough: internship internship internship. Professional experiences, tangible skills and network matter far more than the school you're attending."

ucla,foig11u,t1_foi5mvx,1587785780.0,"Depends on your major and whether if you've done a quarter system before. Personally, I did not think UCLA's curriculums were any harder than my CC (in fact my UCLA GPA was higher) but ymmv. 

Don't put other non-transfers on a pedestal. You got in because you're good enough."
ucla,fntghl6,t3_g3qwtt,1587241171.0,"Just FYI, the state AG writes the title and summary of ballot initiatives, LAO does its own analysis. Arguments in favor/opposition + rebuttals are written by representatives appointed by the respective campaigns iirc. A reasonable arrangement imo, even though misleading and conflicting ballot measures have appeared in front of voters statewide before. 

I think USAC leadership has historically been incompetent, opaque, lazy, tone-deaf and toothless but I also doubt they have the sophistication to pull off something OP is suggesting. 

However, if you're uncomfortable with how things are run right now, you can always push for reforms (e.g. go from appointing election board leadership to electing them, then put them in charge of summarizing ballots or referenda). Students-initiated ballot measures or even constitutional changes are permitted after all."
KindVoice,fnputpw,t3_g32faf,1587152405.0,"Reminds me of my time as a new hire (well, contractor) fresh out of college. 

Four months into my first real job, I misunderstood my boss's instructions and legit did not start drafting a report until the day it's due. Got reprimanded big time and my boss swore in the email lol. Had to pull a few all nighters over the weekend to fix that mess. 

Years later I'm still working for the same boss. (He's actually pretty chill most of the time.)

I know you're feeling very shitty right now, and maybe a tad bit embarrassed. When I was young, I certainly followed instructions too literally, so you're not alone on that front. 

In time, this will just become another anecdote."

Games as a service is partially about preying on people's FOMO complex. But when nerfing powerful unlocks is an inevitability, what exactly are the inactive players missing out on? Lol"

CFB,fn7x2p2,t3_g02i9u,1586729369.0,"After leading Northwestern or Boston College to multiple championships, I would shun highly-ranked recruits who want to play for me, and instead go out of my way to recruit 3* ATHs who, in spite of being under recruited and their low overall ratings, are obvious diamonds in the rough upon scouting. Found tons of stud receivers, QBs, running backs and safeties that way. 

Also helps with the inner narrative that I'm giving these underdogs a chance when nobody else did. There's just something about pretending as if these kids' only lifeline is my 6* prestige program with A+ facilities and academics, and later on resent our opponents in championship games for not recruiting them. Lololololol."
ucla,fn2nzp9,t3_fylv1a,1586596284.0,"Wondering if anyone here is open to pushing a ballot initiative or even constitutional amendment that demands more transparency - something similar to FOIA or the California Public Records Act. Does USAC even have something like that in place right now?

Annual audits. Copies of receipts. Value of stipends each elected USAC official or eligible committee member received. Ensuring there's no self-dealing. All of these - I believe - are within the realm of possibility. 

It will take a lot of effort - pretty sure you guys have to gather thousands of signatures to make it happen. (Refer to Article XI of the USAC Constitution;   [https://usac.ucla.edu/docs/constitution.pdf#page=11](https://usac.ucla.edu/docs/constitution.pdf#page=11) ) But if it happens, it will be a fundamental change and improvement to how USAC operates."

Certified copies of birth certs can be obtained from the county clerk of the county you were born in; some states also have a separate agency that can help your reproduce a legit copy of your birth cert."
ucla,fmzoevp,t3_fxy4rl,1586525992.0,"$2.7m in unaccounted CPO funds and the best USAC can do is send a couple of sternly worded letters asking for transparency and inviting CPO top brass to attend USAC meetings, which were quickly rebuffed btw. I get that earmarked funds from prior referenda cannot be shuffled around willy-nilly at USAC's pleasure, but can we do something about it before asking for more funds? Can USAC push a referendum or amend bylaws to mandate public disclosure of financial records? (Genuinely wondering. Not familiar with USAC's rulebooks.)

Right now, USAC is toothless at best or outright indifferent at worst. And we are trusting them to oversee even more money? I'm all for programs to help the little guys but come on....."
AsianParentStories,fmucaaj,t3_fxbfti,1586388590.0,"Perfectly understandable to not want to save money for a degree you have no interest in pursuing. Sounds like your mom is micromanaging you big time. Common for kids with APs to have issue setting boundaries.
