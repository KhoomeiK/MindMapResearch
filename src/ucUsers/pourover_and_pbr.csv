MachineLearning,fpa78ra,t1_fp8zs1z,1588442227.0,"If I understand the paper correctly, they pre-train the model using COLMAP and Mask R-CNN to get a semi-dense depth map for any frame. They then improve the depth maps at test time by randomly sampling frames from the video and re-training the model using ""spatial loss"" and ""disparity loss"", which are defined in the article. Mask R-CNN is traditional, supervised learning for object segmentation. COLMAP and this model appear to be unsupervised, since there are no reference depth maps being used for the loss. Instead, the loss for COLMAP and this model appears to be based on whether frames which capture similar regions of the scene have similar depth maps. At least, that's what I understood from the paper – someone smarter than me will hopefully come along and clear things up."

hiphopheads,fonlynq,t1_fone7uf,1587922041.0,"If you go to the YouTube video where the voice sample comes from, they have a description, but basically a neural network learns to generate audio from text by being trained on samples of Jay-Z’s voice (like they’ll give it a sentence and the audio of Jay-Z rapping that sentence) and over time it gets good enough that it can produce audio that sounds like Jay-Z on sentences it hasn’t seen before. The main model behind this application is called [WaveNet](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio) and in the network used here they add a couple layers before WaveNet to extract features from the sentences (basically giving it more to work with) that are used by WaveNet to produce audio."
MachineLearning,follzwv,t1_foljtun,1587865149.0,"Edit: This is wrong, but I’ll leave it up. 

No, they take a reference image as the baseline (I don’t recognize the celebrity but it’s the first new face after Emma Watson) and then as they adjust the sliders the model generates new faces using the baseline on the fly."

MachineLearning,fol4hu6,t1_fol1ucw,1587854720.0,"A variational autoencoder is a pair of networks, an encoder and a generator, one which encodes data into a smaller ""latent"" space, and one which reconstructs the data from the latent space. Basically the goal is to learn a smaller representation of the data which supports reconstruction. 

The generator network can then be trained in an adversarial setting against a discriminator network. The generator attempts to produce real-looking images, and the discriminator attempts to discern fake images from real ones. Over time, this setup allows the generator to produce very realistic images. We can reach this level of detail by upsampling lower-res images into higher-res ones using the same technique.

As /u/Digit117 says, it appears that the specific application here is by using an initial reference image, which then gets tweaked by the input sliders. It would be much more difficult to come up with new faces from scratch. On the last page of the linked paper, you can see some of the reference images they used and some of the rebuilds that the network came up with."
worldnews,fohpgx0,t1_fohm20c,1587770116.0,It’s just such a bad system for a representative democracy.
worldnews,foh26hv,t1_fofgamu,1587759680.0,"Well, in Finland, you have a multi-party system. If one of the parties goes off the rails, the other parties can unite against that party while still providing voters with a choice. So, if some batshit populist party gains a following, the others can be united in their opposition, while still allowing voters to choose between more liberal or conservative offerings. 

But here, where the system is bipartisan, if one party goes off the rails, there’s nothing the other can do – they’re already in direct opposition to each other. Sure, a couple conservative senators might abandon their party – we’ve seen that with Romney, McCain, Amash, etc. – but if you want to oppose one party, you HAVE to support the other. So the parties are free to go as off the rails as they want, since they’ll always have support from people who don’t want the other guys to win. If you believe in lower taxes, or smaller government, you’re never gonna vote Democrat, no matter how batshit the Republicans may be."

Sure, being under debt for a long time hurts your ability to buy a home/start a family/etc., but if your debt never gets the chance to accrue interest because you pay it off, you’re in pretty much the same situation as if you’d never taken on the debt in the first place."
