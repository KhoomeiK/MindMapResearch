I just meant to express my discomfort with the direction that software is moving in but I realize that it may not be a huge deal for many as our computers become more and more powerful.
softwaregore,fp1n17n,t1_fp1mosa,1588241207.0,"Vim has everything you talk about. Not everything's available out of the box but most of it can be installed in a couple of minutes. Look up ctrlp.vim, tagbar.vim (for hierarchy) etc. Vim has an integrated terminal. <C-w> and <C-o> can help with file comparison and navigation. Fugitive makes version control a breeze. You can do all the things you listed in a much smaller footprint but I concede that it's not as much out of the box experience as a standard editor or IDE."

Also for the record VSCode is absolutely not an IDE. An IDE would be something like IntelliJ so yeah... You may need to read up on your programming environments a bit before swearing at people on the internet and acting like you're the shit."
softwaregore,fp1jond,t1_fp1iy0q,1588237822.0,I know right? Idk how people justify that shit. VSCode (another web app) takes up nearly 350 MEGABYTES of RAM to open a 1 kb file with like a 10 second boot up time. Something like Nano can do that in a few milliseconds taking a megabyte of RAM.

formula1,fozpvyq,t1_fozdizg,1588194792.0,I unironically enjoy driving Sochi despite it leading to poor racing. The only bad Tilkedrome really is Abu Dhabi and even that has pretty respectable first two sectors. It's the third sector that kills it and that's mostly because the track organizers wanted the track to pass under their hotel etc.
formula1,fozp3wm,t1_foyw0sv,1588194404.0,Yeah it's remarkable how little Codemasters have changed the internals of the games in all these years. All the Renault game mechanics in F1 2019 are still named as Lotus in the game files just to give you an idea of how little has changed.
AMCsAList,fotrp5d,t1_fot7pix,1588063729.0,That's a bit misleading though.

formula1,fosom4m,t1_fosn0qo,1588034858.0,I disagree. At least in Seb's case he couldn't see Stroll because of the HANS. Grosjean had no way to recover from his spin yet kept the throttle pinned for a few seconds despite it being clear that he was heading for a T-bone out of a blind corner.

formula1,foq2ppc,t1_foq27na,1587980829.0,"""Causing a massive accident"" is rather polite. It was more him getting annoyed because he was having a poor race and deliberately yeeting into another car behind a full safety car almost killing four marshalls next to him that were recovering a vehicle.

I don't think it's the pressure. He's just gotten too impatient since the second half of 2018. He can feel the Ferrari championship hope slipping away especially now that Leclerc is in the team."
formula1,foj3lq2,t1_fogp2b3,1587807022.0,I can't even imagine just how happy I would be if Seb ever wins the championship for Ferrari. 10-12 years of his F1 career with so many ups and downs all leading to this one final prize that he has dreamt about all his life.
