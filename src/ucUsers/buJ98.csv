Coronavirus,fpleaiz,t1_fpld4ah,1588711168.0,"Haha! What a stupid response! 

It says that Texas sees thousands of cases per day ‚ÄúAFTER‚Äù the stay at home orders were lifted.

Do you have any idea what that does to a reader as stupid as yourself psychologically? 

Although the headline, at face value is technically correct chronologically, that is not the point.

The headline is meant to imply silently that lifting stay at home orders is the direct and sole cause of the thousands of new cases. When that in and of itself is NOT factually proven. 

Did you hear me? I said NOT factually proven. 

In fact, it hasn‚Äôt even been 14 days yet since they lifted their restrictions (the magic number people seek to keep touting off), so making any under the table implications is not informing the public: It‚Äôs baiting you to click and illicit a dopamine response in your little simpleton head.

- dining halls may have scheduled eating times or mandatory TOGO meals 
- lectures may still be online and sections may be in person or any combination of the two
- housing will probably have to reduce the number of people on campus, converting triples back to doubles or other combinations (this is probably why housing guarantees will be affected)
