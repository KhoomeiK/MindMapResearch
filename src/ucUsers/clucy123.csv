UCSD,fpn0crz,t3_ge69st,1588746501.0,"I get people tryna open up the school and I‚Äôm also sick of being at home. But I don‚Äôt get what made Ucsd think that this is a good idea. Nothing had changed since we left other than the fact that we are close to flattening the curve. But the thing is there is an extreme lack of testing and the hospitals are only testing ppl with severe symptoms like fever(at least the ones I know of). There are asymptomatic people and also the virus may not show effects up to two weeks. I don‚Äôt see how this can benefit the student population living on campus. The campus will prob not be fully operational and we‚Äôll just be social distancing, which is exactly what we do at home. Maybe they forgot that this is contagious. Testing ppl is good but why put ppl on campus for no reason like lab rats and see how this experiment goes? If this is such a good idea why didn‚Äôt korea or China do this when they definitely have more resources and less cases being reported rn? 

Recently I got an email from the school telling us not to buy masks as there is a shortage so it can be used by healthcare workers. I agree with that. But if the school is planning on having students shouldn‚Äôt they promise to at least provide the bare minimum like face masks and a plan in place to disinfect the facilities after use? How are they gonna find the money to hire more ppl disinfect lecture halls every night? It‚Äôs touched by so many people and I‚Äôve seen plenty of ppl stick their chewed gum on the desk(it stays there for a long time).  Only thing they wrote in the email is how their ‚Äúrigorously mathematical model‚Äù might work and some stats. Idk abt other ppl but reading that made me feel like reading someone‚Äôs proposal for an experiment. It might work but there‚Äôs also a possibility that it doesn‚Äôt. If it doesn‚Äôt, it means potentially hurting the student population. What makes Ucsd think that risking students‚Äô well-being is worth for testing out this model they created? I‚Äôm honestly so fking confused but at this point I‚Äôm not surprised esp after they housed covid-19 patients alongside grad students..."
UCSD,fpikge9,t3_gd5s4k,1588642770.0,They give no fucks sadly and seems like they‚Äôre giving us more work and making tests even harder
UCSD,fozq9pj,t1_fozp08i,1588194983.0,Bruh u obviously have no sympathy or understand that other people might be stressed out from this. Just because you‚Äôre not stressed or affected by this doesn‚Äôt mean other people aren‚Äôt either. If you look for apartments earlier you can find cheaper and better ones. Maybe you have the money to pay or got lucky in August but not all of us r like that.
UCSD,fozbv3s,t3_gaamc9,1588188053.0,I hope UCSD doesn‚Äôt push for in-person classes just because they lost money. I really hope they take everything into consideration and take precautions necessary to make this work.
UCSD,foz96av,t1_foyn7uu,1588186769.0,"Maybe you don‚Äôt have anything to worry about but some of us have to figure out housing/jobs and that‚Äôs stressful. I‚Äôve never lived off campus before so I wanted to look into apartments early but UCSD is being so vague about it. The email didn‚Äôt answer shit so I don‚Äôt know if I should start looking for housing or just wait until they tell us. But by the time they announce it, it might be hard to look for apartments."
UCSD,foz8u7p,t1_foyv90q,1588186609.0,People who tested positive on campus. I heard even the cases they announced were announced a week late. Don‚Äôt you feel like we should know so if we feel like we came in contact with them we can at least take precautions? Other schools are making sure they are being transparent about this meanwhile we don‚Äôt know what kind of shit they‚Äôre doing. Also ucsd housing corona patients who tested positive in grad housing without even letting them know. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs something we should simply overlook.
UCSD,foxi1cl,t1_foxgq15,1588144627.0,Yeppp honestly I lost all hope seeing how shitty Ucsd has been with corona. I personally know a few cases that still hasn‚Äôt been announced and also the article abt Ucsd housing corona patients in grad housing starting March without telling them anything...I hate online school but I don‚Äôt feel safe going back
UCSD,foxfbhn,t3_g9uvxa,1588142252.0,This is so vague and it‚Äôs just adding extra stress to the students right now who are already struggling due to remote learning. I know that things are changing constantly but if they can‚Äôt say for sure they should just announce it as remote instruction to be safe rather than waiting until it‚Äôs safe and telling us abt it with a short notice. Some people need to look for housing and jobs and ucsd dragging it out isn‚Äôt helping. Honestly pisses me off that they take extra money from us and is being so vague when other universities are having their tuition reduced.
