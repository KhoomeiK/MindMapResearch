berkeley,fo9q8na,t3_g6gvpa,1587627400.0,"Congrats! i’m an english minor but i’ve taken the 45 series and a few other classes. the difference between stem and the humanities classes i’ve taken is pretty drastic! overall, in my experience, if you go to lecture like 80% of the time and do ~50% of the readings (and participate in discussion!!!!), you’ll be able to get a b+/a-, which is around the avg for these classes. there’s typically not homework, mainly just readings, so my effort in the classes (not including lectures/discussions) honestly averaged out to about 3 hours a week (oops), more if i had an essay or test. i would put things off to the night before and just cram, and would come out with an a-, but if you have a rough draft ahead of time/ go to office hours you could prob get near 100%. honestly it’s what you put into it, it just depends on how much time you have. the english department here is so great, i’ve loved all my gsis, and almost everybody is genuinely passionate about the material; it’s a very collaborative environment."

berkeley,fb68nad,t3_ebb6sd,1576544136.0,"I took a similar course load my first semester, and I felt the same way. You always feel like you can work more, study more; essentially, BE more. At one point in the semester I could barely get out of bed for classes and would just lay in my bed for the rest of the day, and during that time my mind would just be thinking about all the things I had to know, but couldn't bring myself to study.  My parents were also hesitant about me coming here, and they could tell I was very depressed when I came back for winter break. My family is not one to talk about feelings, but after that semester, I started to confide to my parents about the difficulty of classes, making friends, etc. Your parents seem like they just want you to be ok. Like someone else said, Berk kicks the shit out of many people. You have so much time. We are all so young. Nobody knows what they are doing, and that is ok. You are here, and you will figure it out. Sending the best of vibes to you!"
