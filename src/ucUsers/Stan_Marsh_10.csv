ucla,fpc0djk,t3_gc9dpr,1588483682.0,"I am trying to apply to a Ph.D program and the deadline is Dec 1. 

Do you have any tips on the application process?

Also, all of the programs I’m applying to say that the GRE is optional. So should I not take it? If I don’t take it, will my application still hold weight against other applications that have a good GRE score? The optional thing is so vague lol.

When you applied, how many months/years of research did you have that you stated on your application?

Also, have you heard of any changes going on in grad schools that might heavily impact incoming grad students? Like budget cuts and whatnot."

Coronavirus,fomh59v,t1_fom26rc,1587889832.0,"Hey I'm in  the same boat - except I have family near me but I'm too scared to visit them and getting them sick. I've lost all will to work online and pretty much abandoned it. And I started smoking again, stupid I know but I've lost all interest in my own well being. In my state, even trails and parks are closed so there's nowhere to go. I even tried taking a scenic drive in the morning the other day, and I parked on the side to take in the view, and a cop stopped me and said I couldn't be there lol. Idk if I can give you any real advice but if you can, spend time outside at the trails (if it is safe and social distancing is possible) b/c being indoors is way too suffocating, and getting some walking in is so important, even if it doesn't seem like it's helping. people are being so annoying, setting high expectations like learning a new hobby or becoming like a master chef or something but i figured it's perfectly acceptable to just do whatever you want, even if it's not productive. it helps me to binge watch tv shows that i find interesting or watch stand up comedy on youtube. i just want to pass time and not get stuck in my thoughts. anyways im sorry for this lame reply but PM me if you need anyone to talk, i really hope you find some thing that helps you feel better."

COVID19,fob00by,t1_fo777dl,1587654548.0,Ya it’s just quarantine is such an easy situation to use as an excuse for smoking. My usual relief is going to the gym or being out in nature but neither is possible. This just sucks. But anyways how has your quarantine been?
COVID19,fo6a5rn,t1_fo37dm6,1587552281.0,I want to start so bad. I shouldn’t but the stress and depression is just too much. Idk. I have been good from refraining from smoking since Jan but the quarantine has been difficult. Ive been in isolation by myself since March and haven’t talked to or seen anybody in person since. I have no idea how drug addicts or alcoholics are coping rn.

ucla,fnu0fr3,t1_fnskpq9,1587252118.0,"Can you just postpone your plans until next year and figure out where students needs lie then? It just seems like there is too much uncertainty about whether fall will remain online or not. you said yourself that you’re not even certain how you will serve the students. I think the best way to actually help students is to not charge anymore fees

charging fees to help a vulnerable population during a crisis just isn’t going to sit well to most students. soup kitchens and different nonprofits that serve the homeless community don’t charge the homeless any fees. The funds come from a source that doesn’t require charging the community that you’re trying to help"

ucla,fnrm2ml,t3_g3hvk5,1587193347.0,"I use the iPad air and it's decent enough. It's slightly smaller in size, so if you really need the bigger size than go with the iPad pro but I didn't see it necessary. The other difference is that iPad pro comes with the newer model of apple pencil, which is apparently a little lighter and easier to hold than the apple pencil that comes with the iPad air. But I've been using the older apple pencil and you get really used to it, it seems a tad bit heavy at first but it's really not noticeable after you get used to it.

To take notes, I download the slides as a PDF onto my OneNote app, and save everything on that app. What's convenient is that everything you save onto OneNote automatically gets saved onto your OneDrive storage. OneNote is free. I also heard Noteability is a popular app but you have to pay. 

It's wayyyy more convenient and at this point, I never really see myself going back to pen/paper again. It's convenient to just have your iPad in class instead of carrying a heavier laptop. If you do find yourself needing to type your notes instead of handwriting it, you can always get a keyboard for your iPad on amazon!"

CoronavirusCA,fnntpkz,t1_fnnsozq,1587101432.0,"Exactly. Unfortunately, you can't have school without faculty. And many faculty are high risk and aren't going to want to risk themselves, though I feel like they will end up doing it b/c they are so dedicated to the children. 

And I wasn't really understanding Newsom's idea about switching shifts. I think ultimately, if you want to open schools again, you're going to have to expect that 6ft distancing is not going to be implemented. I don't know how elementary kids are going to be able to keep 6ft apart during recess, lunch, in public bathrooms, etc. 

Also, there's probably a percentage of parents that will absolutely refuse to send their kids as well."
