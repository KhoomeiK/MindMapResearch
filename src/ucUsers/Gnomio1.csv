In Europe, the food hygiene standards in slaughterhouses are sufficient that meat is not contaminated with feces etc during production, and thus a chlorinated bath is not required to produce a sanitary and safe product. 

In the US this is not the case. 

This is not remotely analogous to drinking water or swimming pools. It is possible to produce chicken meat cleanly, the US largely chooses not to.

Those really are termed “election fraud”, it is tampering with the results of the voting. 

The instances of your ballot trying to be thrown out is also “election fraud”, you have legally voted and someone is tampering with that process. 

In your links, “voter fraud”, would be those times where someone was not legally allowed to vote, actually voting. It’s really important to tease out the details here. 

In that big “list of 10” Washington Times article, the vast majority of the list is where someone was “registered to vote illegally” which 1) has no relevance to postal votes or no postal votes; 2) only listed I think 2 instances of several to a few dozen people actually voting illegally. The rest of the points were things like intimidation of poll workers etc.

If every country extracted and tried to sell as much oil as possible the price would collapse and some extraction operations would no longer be economically viable (the Saudis are able to extract oil for less money per barrel than anyone else). So the oil market is essentially run by cartels (OPEC is a cartel) that work to keep the prices acceptable. 

Increasing “proven” or “known” reserves of oil helps to keep production smooth and this keeps the markets smooth. High oil prices (or very low) aren’t necessarily bad for any economy because we can account for them, but volatility is a big issue. So in theory the entire economy could benefit from those Arctic operations. 

But yes, there would be a compounding effect of hundreds of thousands of US oil workers losing their jobs. I don’t know which effect would be larger but given the increasing investment in green tech their jobs are not stable in the long term anyway. We will always need oil for chemical production but that is unlikely to sustain the industry domestically."

Besides, as soon as the domestic market crashes prices will rise again. That’s why this Arctic thing is good for prices, but bad for the domestic sector; increasing supply depresses value making home production unviable. 

Trump can’t have it both (or all 3) ways. If he supports more exploration he’s dooming domestic supply which could temporarily spike local prices when they shut down. If he wants to support the domestic industry he actually needs to support way higher prices. He doesn’t appear to realize this."

The intense sell-off drove the price down. You can’t accept delivery of goods you don’t have the ability to accept, so in a panic to not renege on contracts people were paying others to take the contracts off their hands. Essentially. 

However, drilling for oil in the arctic (ignoring environmental issues) will not be good for domestic US production... so fuck knows why he’s making these statements while also saying he wants to save the domestic producers."

Soap bubbles work slightly different to both of these. Rather than absorbing any of the colors, they just sort of bounce the light off equally in all directions and that just looks like white.

So on March 20th, the same day as Maddow’s scandalous comment, there was no word for when the ships would leave port in Virginia. Then 8 days later the ship left port in Virginia (that’s more than a week), and arrived in NYC 10 days after the comment, on the 30th (also more than a week).

You are a minority being 21 years of age and not needing to check email on the go, be it for work or for job searches if you’re unemployed etc. 

You’re also privileged to live somewhere with adequate public transport, and amenities within foot/bike distances. 

You can spend the equivalent amount in today’s dollars for quality items though. That’s the point you seem to have completely ignored from my message. You want a leather jacket that will last for 50 years? Pay what it cost 50 years ago, but in today’s money. 

It’s great that you completely missed the point. Want good items? Spend more than your current monthly salary on them, that’s how it worked back then. That leather jacket would’ve been a significant outlay. Go and buy a $4,000 leather jacket today from a non-fashion brand, one that is reputed to produce long lasting items. 

You want a washer that will last 10 years? Spend the equivalent money on it that you would have back then, it’s not complicated. A washer/dryer combo for $400 in the 60s, and now you can pay $600 for the same thing? Adjust it for inflation and it’s THOUSANDS today. That was my whole point that you missed. People complain about quality declining but they don’t spend the same money on the same things as a fraction of their income...

These things still exist, there’s just lots more of the cheap shit as well.

Median HOUSEHOLD income in 1960 was ~$5,600, with a drop to <$2,900 for households headed by the over 65s. So that washer/dryer set is getting on for 8-10% of your annual income (not sure what taxes would be on that $5,600). Median HOUSEHOLD income for 2018 was ~$61,000. You’re welcome to go and buy a >$5,000 washer/dryer if you want the same quality.

Cars were easier to repair for sure, but you had large inefficient engines that produced relatively low horsepower for their fuel consumption and displacement. 

But boy do I agree with you that there could be some middle ground between then (expensive as fuck but good repair ability), and now (cheap and impossible for the layperson). 

Part of the issue is the extreme prevalence of proprietary parts where there shouldn’t be. Mobile phone chargers should all be one type. Mobile phone batteries shouldn’t all be different shapes and sizes. The fucking cap on the oil pan for my car should be universal... etc.

Government gave these billions over the years to install fiber across the nation, and they have done nothing with that money. 

I’m not against free markets, I’m against every “free market” that certain people believe is actually “free”. Absolutely no big business or industrial sector in the U.S. is in any way “free. There are ways to regulate industries that are not anti-competitive, that doesn’t happen in the real world."
AskReddit,fo5bcb1,t1_fo5b3uf,1587521621.0,"No, I think both myself and /u/untakenu believed you were suggesting you kept your shoes on. Since the thread is “why do people keep their shoes on” lol."

Just FYI, because those chuds are going to be all over this bad argument."

Air those dogs out! Give them a wash and get on with your evening. Foot health matters."
news,fo54qgm,t1_fo517yc,1587517467.0,Haven’t these free market cunts realized that some stuff is just not amenable to free markets due to either existing monopoly or massive infrastructure investment required to simply double-up on current capability for the sake of competition?

A gradual reopening is still going to see new cases, but in a manageable way. Doctors and nurses need to be able to treat those people without getting sick, and we need testing resources to facilitate contact tracing. 

The federal response seems to have been to tell states to go their own way, and then to divert and confiscate PPE resources."

These have helped foment domestic state-based protests which will help ensure those states get a nice boost in cases over the next few weeks, helping to delay their careful reopening of businesses."
gaming,fnzt4ce,t1_fnzpmrf,1587400291.0,"Yes indeed, they are heavy hitters! My approach has always been to nuke the surrounding area nearby with grenades and a flame belch on the approach and just get in between the melee range and rocket range and Zerg with the plasma rifle. It’s a high risk/reward strat, usually results in armor tokens spamming in from the nearby demons keeping me going. I’m sure it won’t work on the top difficulty."

Just plasma rifle spam the torso and use the fully upgraded burst every time it comes up, that extra damage boost shreds. Usually takes just over 100 ammo with grenades and flame belch."

It’s always helpful when refuting someone else’s numbers to also provide sources for your own. Particularly if you’re going to refer to them as “trash”. 

For example, your “1.3% inside Wuhan” appears to be wrong. 

Here: https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf was published late Feb and indicated ~5% fatality in Wuhan but drastically lower in other provinces as their healthcare systems weren’t overwhelmed."
