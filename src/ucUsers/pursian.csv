BlackPeopleTwitter,fpm3wfr,t1_fplqdwv,1588725041.0,"Also if you can't afford it, you are getting a lot of financial aid"

I know people who had their tuition covered and just took out loans to pay rent"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpm2n0r,t1_fpm1z4b,1588724307.0,"Not true at all. At a university you have professors doing research and studying new stuff all the time. It's pretty easy to get engaged with your major beginning with your 1st year and even 1st semester (even if you're taking gen ed classes). A university offers a lot more resources than a CC, it's just up to you to take advantage of them. For some people, it's not worth it. For some it is. Not to hate on a CC, but even putting yourself in a university with other motivated and talented individuals is a bonus.

For some they would rather save the 10-20k a year. Some would rather pay more for that experience/benefits. Up to you and what you value. 

Even then, with financial aid you can pretty much get your tuition covered. I know friends who went to CC and got paid money back from financial aid and they just put that in their backs since they didn‚Äôt really have any expenses. 

Me personally, I would skip CC."

i'm about the same as you, wash my car every 2 months if not longer. i know it's bad, but with the amount of daily driving i do, and the fact that i park my car outside, my car will only be clean for literally 24 hours before it starts getting dirty again lol."

Powerlock is a great product, but with the amount that I drive, the results are not worth the effort. I find that every 3 months or 5000 miles is when I begin to see the sealant deteriorating.

It‚Äôs just not as much as compared to strength training. Even then, if you‚Äôre working your calves much more running compared to doing calf raises you are probably gonna see more gains 

In fact running HIIT give you good strength gains. So I say if you keep a high intensity while running you can build strength."

Fitness,fo4f2z2,t1_fo4cl3r,1587503265.0,"i feel way more burn in my calves after running than i do after a leg day at the gym. even doing jump a rope works my calves out more than the 4 or 5 sets of calf raises i do at the gym.

 i run just for the cardio benefit, but it is a pretty good leg workout if you are pushing yourself."

It looks like the aspm setting physically shuts off power to the pci port. It sounds like it‚Äôs the equivalent of the computer putting that pci ports to ‚Äúsleep‚Äù momentarily until it‚Äôs needed again. 

I think they all turn off when I put the computer to sleep. Because the lights on my graphics card go off when I put my computer to sleep."
intel,fo43g2a,t1_fo430gu,1587497542.0,"I did some research and it looks like if anything, the graphics card would benefit from this. 

Now I wonder if I am missing out on power savings. Does this setting keep those devices on even if I‚Äôm sleep mode? Does it prevent the graphics card from entering a low power mode if it‚Äôs not being used?"
