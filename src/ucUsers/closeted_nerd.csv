UCSantaBarbara,fpl2ofo,t1_fphypir,1588705299.0,"OO i took COMM 171 with Abra (Legal and Courtroom Communication) and he was handsdown one of my favorite professors too! he was so lenient and easy to understand and super engaging. I think our classes seemed really similar, except it was about the communication patterns that go on in the courtroom/between lawyers/how they can influence jurors. 

Those sounds so interesting though, so I wanna see if I can maybe try enrolling in one of the SOC ones maybe"
UCSantaBarbara,fpl23i9,t3_ge1gux,1588705014.0,oooof ya i know what you mean but some GE's are major classes for other people
UCSantaBarbara,fph9wcu,t1_fph1z3n,1588617522.0,Ahh!! Thank you so much for this! It's been a while since registration so these details are a little fuzzy but this was great! I'll update my post
UCSantaBarbara,fp0y1s8,t3_gajrty,1588219527.0,"i'd say it's not necessary, even though it would help, it would be a waste of time imo 

109 is very straightforward and there is clas that you can enroll to help with"
UCSantaBarbara,foxdpnc,t3_g9xia3,1588140899.0,"omgg that is so unnecessary and I definitely think that orientation online is not worth it for that kind of money. if you decide not to go, feel free to pm me (or anyone else) and I can explain how to log into GOLD/choose classes/GE requirements/other things that they tell you about!"
UCSantaBarbara,fot5wuw,t3_g9fp0n,1588045364.0,been through econ 1 w vespa from last year.. his lecture was useless and most of us just learned from clas and the practice midterms LOL
UCSantaBarbara,fo82v3e,t3_g695az,1587588928.0,i asked them about non-p/np matters and they responded really quickly
UCSantaBarbara,fo4p3fm,t1_fo3vdq7,1587508495.0,"unfortunately, econ 10a has to be taken at ucsb :("
UCSantaBarbara,fnzyr33,t3_g4wf0o,1587403075.0,"honestly I wouldn't be surprised at all given the econ department's track record lol..just because I think that most people can still be on track if they take it fall quarter. 

when I took it, they were held during fifth hour"
UCSantaBarbara,fnx5jm9,t3_g4fe3d,1587331896.0,"hmm i don't think they'll make exceptions, but they were lenient about the honors experience credit so maybe they won't? maybe if it drops below 3.5 after a bad quarter you can try to appeal or smth?"
UCSantaBarbara,fnx4zx6,t3_g4echn,1587331588.0,"last time i went to student health, i was bleeding randomly and the doctor there insisted I was pregnant even though I wasn't sexually active during that time. They ended up making me pay for a pregnancy test (out of pocket because I don't have insurance) even though I told them i could get one at cvs"
xboxone,fnrngnk,t3_g329wd,1587194710.0,omg!!
UCSantaBarbara,fnmx3jb,t3_g2k9mt,1587079855.0,"i also have old test pdfs and the slides from class, pm me and i can email them to u!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnhwbin,t1_fnhrbtz,1586969936.0,"btw for those who are trying to cheat, I think the order of questions will be mixed up which is why we can't go back.. so just a heads up"
UCSantaBarbara,fngm9vd,t3_g1bsz3,1586936893.0,"i thought he was pretty boring as a lecturer and it did not help me much. however, i went to office hours and he's super helpful and also his exams are very straightforward and there are no trick questions. I think the average for our midterm was like around a 78% which is p high for a stats class. also, if you have taken any other stats class before 109 (like ap stats or pstat 5a) you will be well prepared for the class"
UCSantaBarbara,fngm4ad,t3_g1hhwg,1586936740.0,"i would say it wouldn't hurt that much considering job options are gonna be limited due to coronavirus rn.. if you have the resources and money to do so, why not?"
UCSantaBarbara,fnb8p6n,t1_fnahq9q,1586811173.0,"last time I did this, I cancelled the quarter through emailing the registration. I would do this just in case"
UCSantaBarbara,fmsyd2z,t3_fx9ax5,1586363928.0,"probably before...but I know they can take up to 6 weeks to appear on GOLD unfortunately. If you have trouble registering for classes, I would email undergrad advising and ask them to clear you for some classes"
UCSantaBarbara,fmonc71,t1_fmlp87d,1586264071.0,I did fssp my freshman year and loved it! i met my main friend group throughout my floor during fssp and we're still super close. it's also a great time to get to know a lot of people in the building and get units out of the way also familiarize yourself with ucsb and college life so you're not too overwhelmed in the fall:)) hope this helps! and i stayed in san nic for the entire year and mostly everyone does as well
AmItheAsshole,fmolymv,t3_fwjgn0,1586263023.0,"NAH your flatmate prob just wants to make friendly conversation and get to know you, and you don't value this. There's no problem with you or her, but you should just let her know your boundaries so that she can also act accordingly."
AmItheAsshole,fmol0jt,t3_fwj8c9,1586262244.0,"ESH because she should have better integrity than relying on you to pass her classes, but you should have been more straightforward in handling it and telling her straight up that she shouldn't be cheating off you. 

If it mattered that much, you wouldn't have let her cheat off you this entire time, and would've brought it up earlier. It's petty for you to seek revenge and wait till the last exam to address it"
AmItheAsshole,fmok687,t3_fwa7en,1586261541.0,"ESH 

Your instructions were a little confusing, but the driver should not have lectured you and been so rude about them in the first place. However, given the situation right now, Im sure delivering food is the last thing that people want to do right now, and cutting people some slack goes a long way . The 2 star review might have been a little harsh imo"
UCSantaBarbara,fmmefon,t1_fmmazol,1586203783.0,ooh! okay thanks:)
UCSantaBarbara,flim9hw,t3_foomr6,1585185576.0,how seriously have people been taking the social distancing seriously? are people still hanging out w friends?
