UCDavis,foxmwvs,t1_foxkt9l,1588149137.0,"I study statistics in the data science track at Davis, and I transferred. It will be difficult to fit all your courses in on time but doable. Check assist.org to see if any of your coursework transfers to ECS 32A or ECS 36A. Take a summer class in stats (do not take 106 and 108 at the same time over the summer, really fucked me over) and take 2-3 stats courses every quarter and you can get out in 2 years.

If you have more time than 2 years, yeah, it's definitely possible to do well. The stats department assumes you have no programming experience and starts shoving R programming down your throat with stats 13 (check assist.org again to see what the equivalent course is at your CC) and continues with 106 and 108. Then the 141 series is your trial by fire where they teach you a LOT of R programming. You need to do the ECS 32 series to learn python. 32A was a joke, 32B is kicking my ass.
