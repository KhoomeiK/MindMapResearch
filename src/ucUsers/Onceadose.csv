UCSD,folnyu1,t3_g81993,1587866424.0,"I couldn't even finish. Let me now gripe about the absolutely horrendous quiz format on Canvas. I absolutely HATE the 1 question method. I hated it before the transition to online courses and didn't even think about it being used as a format once we transitioned. If it's to deter cheating, I have to say, it is royally **cking up it up for us that don't cheat.

On another note, I don't understand professors that don't give at least 15 minutes extra time after the midterm allotted time to upload our exams. That's some bull."
aww,fnyxdud,t3_g4oi28,1587379228.0,I love how she pets the costume dog afterwards. It's like an instinctual reaction for her lol.
UCSD,fnodpor,t3_g2ocgm,1587121654.0,Some of the soc classes are pretty chill if you're ok with papers.
OurPresident,fnbu9a8,t1_fnazquk,1586822441.0,"For me, at this point, I really don't give a crap about Republican or Democrat or saving the country from Trump. I'm pissed off at the overall, underlying bullshit of the entire political system, which *includes* subverting the will of the people. I can't believe more waves were not made following the Texas polling incident, in which there was a miscount, and which was only found out after the pollworker noticed the discrepancy and filed for a recount. Aside from a few local articles, I couldn't find any news source following this story. 
We can vote all we want, I would rather have people vote than not, but you absolutely cannot dismiss or ignore that voters face deliberate obstacles.
Big media is the biggest perpetrator in all this. Truth is nothing but an ideology to these scared, spineless twats."
AskReddit,fmly4hm,t1_fml8qh9,1586195320.0,This is true. There's a video of some man given a bunch of shirts and he ranks it from least to favorite smell. The attractive factor matched up with his smell ranking. Of course this video alone isn't proof of this phenomenon but it's interesting nonetheless.
