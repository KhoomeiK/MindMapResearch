berkeley,foe8jz7,t3_g6g2qq,1587698223.0,How can we get this man out of the community? We should all write reviews on Google and Yelp to help tarnish his business for starters. Everyone should know before they decide to rent with him imo.
berkeley,fnrfrmo,t3_g3fazj,1587187621.0,"1. Manage your time well and academics will not be overly stressful (imo). Berkeley is an elite university so it will be challenging but not impossible. I study 4-6 hours daily on average, sometimes less sometimes more just depending on the semester.

2. All about time management. My friends & I like to go out to parties/clubs/bars on the weekends so we make sure to complete our stuff beforehand. 

3. I grew up around here so SF isnâ€™t new to me, but I like to go with friends a couple times a month or so. My friends and I prefer going out in sf/oak over berkeley so it kinda depends on your group.

4. If you want to party and have fun its not hard to find. 

5. You will definitely meet some kids at berkeley who are a bit snobby, more specifically, youâ€™ll meet kids who act as if being stressed out is a competition. But most people are really great and helpful, I had no issue finding students to collab & study with!"

dating,fnlumnk,t1_fnjgukc,1587060009.0,"I think the western image of Asian men is improving, so it seems like more asian and non-asian women would be open to dating an asian guy.

Personally most of the asian & half asian girls I know are proud and would never mock asian men because they sexually prefer asian guys overall. But of course that doesnâ€™t mean there arenâ€™t asian & half asian women out there that do put down asian guys."
berkeley,fnglvbz,t3_g1ll19,1586936492.0,"I see pretty girls all the time! The guys here are cute too though ngl. Idk why people dog on berkeley, weâ€™re all cute n smart ðŸ¥º"
dating,fn7zqss,t3_fzwhu8,1586730917.0,"A lot of Asian women, especially here in the bay, seem to have white only preferences. No one wants to talk about it, but white worship is a real thing. The asian women that relentlessly make fun of asian men suffer from internalized racism and self hate. 

Iâ€™m a half asian/half white girl and I see it all the time. Are you active on any of the asian subreddits? They can be really insightful imo. I personally prefer asian men over any other race of men, and many of my half asian & non-asian girlfriends like asian men too. Maybe try branching out to non-asian women!"
