UCSantaBarbara,fpdp19j,t1_fpdomx3,1588531354.0,I would say you're right but I've been holed up w my family only leaving to get groceries and wearing a mask/ wiping down groceries/sanitizing. Just came to see my housemates for a few days. Not all of IV

UCSantaBarbara,fpckeuo,t1_fpcjbas,1588503853.0,"Yeah people aren't completely disregarding it. But also I've been in the Bay Area where there's a lot more cases and at least 80% of people where a mask in any close contact setting. People are really worried and bc there aren't as many cases here ive been hearing lots about ""people in IV have stopped giving a shit"" even from my friends that are staying here. 

I get people are partying less and there's barely any cases here. But I wish people would realize that this is not a joke and that the risks are servere. Personally ill be heading back to the Bay in a few days. 

I don't post much on Reddit and I don't like bad vibes but I have to say that I really hope people will realize the severity once there's a few more cases or even a death here. 

And I wish that IV would realize that all this socializing is not worth even 1 death. That shit is scary and I know for a fact it will be shake our whole community when it's one of us. 

I hate to be a pessimist as I'm a lover of life but with the rate of socializing in IV it's bound to happen."

UCSantaBarbara,fpcj2k8,t3_gcl9zl,1588502405.0,"I get it's a lot less crowded and this is supposed to be a lighthearted post. But also California is on a stay at home order to stop a PANDEMIC. More than 50,000 people have died and even more families affected. I went to the beach today and there were more than 50 people partying in a DP backyard.

Just because it's not a regular party night does not mean IV is being angelic in regards to social distancing. I love IV and the people in it but I have to say that people are being irresponsible for the most part. Socializing is not worth risking lives."
