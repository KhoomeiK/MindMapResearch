UCSD,fpfbcly,t1_fpf49t2,1588566411.0,"I don't mean to come across as rude, but I've seen the work put in by individual team members in a job, and at school, in both scenarios, it's about the same. To get people motivated and work hard is a managers job, while I know you may not want to take on that position as it should not be a required role for everyone, I believe this is actually very similar to how things work in the real world minus the fact that we have like four different classes lol. Anyways, I do understand that students should definitely get a break during this time as it is definitely very difficult for all of us during this COVID-19 shelter in place. Anyways, I wish you the best of luck on your project! And stay safe and healthy! :)"
