UCSantaBarbara,fpe6aep,t1_fpdxeu2,1588541207.0,"Depends on who you send your transcript to for any future applications, and what class it's for (and in relation to your major). Grad/med/law schools will see it, possibly any internships or jobs where you have to send them your transcript, etc. 

If it's for some random GE class that has nothing to do with your major, they *probably* care less than if it was for an important (major) class related to the field you're sending the transcript to (e.g., an Econ class when you're applying for an accounting firm).

However, I would hope that if it IS seen as a negative thing to whoever sees your transcript, you get a chance to explain it so that it's not an end-all? (Think supplementary section for grad applications?) Also, in the context of the entire world experiencing this pandemic and how it's affected everyone, I think there'd be more sympathy. Of course, that's just my hope and again, this is all super subjective. Just some things to think about."
UCSantaBarbara,fp35kbh,t3_gb0uye,1588273467.0,"I tried to give them the benefit of doubt because they support so many different kinds of campus events and orgs but after being a club president last year, it was really hard to feel like they were helpful. Granted, it was for a sport club so we didn't need to interact much with OSL but their lack of communication and organization was incredibly frustrating. 

They changed the requirements for student orgs without telling anyone in the middle of the year and when I tried emailing the person in charge at the time to ask for better communication, they replied once telling me they update their website and Orgsync (who's going to constantly check a static site or one with a terrible platform???) and then ghosted me when I had a bunch of important follow-up questions to keep my club in good standing??

Dealing with OSL's terrible communication is one of the biggest things I don't miss after I stepped down lmao."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fp2yf6x,t1_fp2o2bm,1588269982.0,This is great! Loving all these resources - it's even helping me be a little less stressed haha. Knowledge really is power. Thank you so much!!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fp2y5rx,t1_fp2dd6l,1588269855.0,"The animation is so cute, looks fun to watch with my brother - thank you for sharing!"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fp2woox,t1_fp2foi0,1588269141.0,Ooh I really like the working out analogy! I think I'm going to use that when I get to sit down with him and talk about our immune systems. Thank you so much!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fp2w9gg,t1_fp1u8ad,1588268941.0,Thank you! This helps put his stress in a better perspective about OCD tendencies. I'll definitely make sure to emphasize his agency if we're able to get him a therapist.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fp2suwh,t1_fp1ve1z,1588267322.0,I've been trying to look for informative videos for kids like these but wasn't sure where to start. I'm excited to check out both of them - thank you!
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fp2sl82,t1_fp1n2rr,1588267196.0,"I like this a lot, thank you both so much for all the details! Definitely going to try and have this discussion with him soon."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fp1ibm0,t1_fp1g1d9,1588236500.0,"The thought has definitely crossed my mind. I was kind of hesitant because I'm not sure where my parents stand on therapy and how they'd especially take it for getting my brother help, but I feel a little more reassured to try now. Thank you so much. <3"
AnimalCrossing,fo9ud86,t1_fo9s603,1587631493.0,can I join even though I don't have the game?? I've been living vicariously through AC posts and a queer AC server sounds like just the community I need in these trying times
UCSantaBarbara,fo8bjj6,t3_g66vyf,1587593428.0,"Would they be open to feedback? I've heard some professors not realizing how much work they've assigned until students emailed them to let them know it's too much. (We shouldn't have to, but I guess that's the reality of this situation.) I know other professors are really strict and unsympathetic though so not sure if it's worth trying... :("
StardewValley,fo43j6p,t3_g5kw6o,1587497585.0,This is gorgeous!!
UCSantaBarbara,fnt7doa,t1_fnsz40t,1587236036.0,"I'm glad you're doing so well!

I hope that when this pandemic is over, schools start giving better accommodations (re: more remote learning opportunities for those who need it) when we move back to majority in-person classes. They've certainly proved that it's possible."

TheAdventureZone,fnm9mxw,t1_fnltnjx,1587067498.0,"This seems silly but after catching up with all of TAZ, my main reason for joining the subreddit was to see if anyone else also loved the Graduation theme. It's SO GOOD. Maybe I just have a soft spot for strings but it's easily my favorite piece from TAZ."
self,fner1qf,t3_g11wly,1586894320.0,You deserve attention!! So proud of you <3
UCSantaBarbara,fnapv2e,t3_g0o1qz,1586801716.0,"Only 1 out of my five professors is holding live lectures, but it's only an hour a week (plus section) and he's assured everyone multiple times that if you can't make it, it won't be held against you. It's ""required"" because the class relies heavily on the real-time class discussions, but attendance isn't part of the grade."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fnanko9,t1_fna72nt,1586800581.0,"Came here to say exactly this. We're in the middle of a global pandemic! It's 1000000% okay that you want to chill. People deal with crises differently, don't be ashamed of your way. You do you."
StardewValley,fn1rriw,t1_fn03jjy,1586568589.0,I'm pretty sure I've seen some SDV cookbooks floating around on the internet!
UCSantaBarbara,fmrle22,t1_fmr1l3a,1586326817.0,"This, plus professors can no longer pause and ask if anyone has questions, or see that everyone is still taking notes and wait a little longer before changing to the next slide. Or even going back to the last slide because someone asked them to. 

It's kind of frustrating, especially with lectures where professors take up the whole 75 minutes as if it was in-person so now there's even more content without those irl pauses?? (I mean I get it and I love the learning, but my hand has been cramping for a week lmao pls have mercy)"
UCSantaBarbara,fmpl32l,t3_fwf2vc,1586282745.0,Thanks for this <3 I miss the ocean and the sky in SB :(
UCSantaBarbara,fm3gj2k,t1_fm2qme3,1585722763.0,"Yup, this is all correct! Except that if it's for the major (or even not for the major), the only things you need to ask yourself is:

1) is that RGST class a prerequisite for a class you're taking this spring? and/or 

2) is that RGST class part of a pre-major and you've submitted or are going to submit a change of major to the full major?

(Am an actual advisor :) )"
