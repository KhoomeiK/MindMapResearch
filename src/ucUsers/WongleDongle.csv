Advice,fo9s5dx,t3_g6i1r5,1587629242.0,"Sounds cheesy but picture yourself at each college. Like actually living at that college, if you can‚Äôt go on personal tours look up pictures, go on social media. Obviously try and find a school that will fit your desired field of study the best but ultimately where you see yourself developing as a person the best is where you should be. I know someone who got into Cornell University and rejected from UC Davis. Instead of going to an Ivy League, she appealed her application to UC Davis and did end up getting in after appealing. And she says it was the second best decision she ever made in her life

Whatever will make you enjoy yourself the most is the correct choice‚Ä¶ y‚Äôknow besides hardcore drugs, murder, arson that sorts thing.
Sorry, jokes aside your time on Earth is finite so you have to do what you think is in your best interest. To pick a college I very seriously recommend a tour even though you said that‚Äôs not an option. The tour guides can make or break a campus, I‚Äôm going to my dream university because a tour guide sold the campus so well to me"

Advice,fo9qs4v,t1_fo9othv,1587627917.0,"To a rather somewhat extent yes, by killing spiders that wander into a territory that is not theirs other spiders more or less learn from dead spiders. It won‚Äôt be an immediate change but you eliminate spiders that are easier to spot (they‚Äôre slower, they can‚Äôt blend into the surroundings, they pick bad times of the day to move around) then the rest of the spiders in that general area only have the genes of the superior spiders and eventually you will no longer notice them.

1) that number on the scale doesn‚Äôt define anything about you, it‚Äôs not a personality trait so it shouldn‚Äôt be one of your primary worries
2) it‚Äôs unfair to yourself to compare your body to other people‚Äôs, it‚Äôs probably going to happen no matter what just by nature of the issue but keep reminding yourself that there‚Äôs probably a lot of people who look at you and think ‚ÄúI wish I was as thin as her‚Äù it‚Äôs a rather humbling thought in my eyes"

Advice,fo9pfrc,t3_g6e5kv,1587626624.0,"Sounds to me like A) similar to what other people say it‚Äôs easier to like children to you because you don‚Äôt have an inherent negative opinion of children B) I‚Äôm no expert but it sounds like perhaps an underlying reason is that you don‚Äôt want a child to go through what you went through. Thinking of the psychological effects your upbringing could‚Äôve had on you, it‚Äôs fair to say that your subconscious self tries to befriend children in the event that that child might open up to you and alert you to potential dangers.
