AnalogCommunity,fp34zq4,t1_fp1s9bx,1588273180.0,Wow I love the pics dude. The colors reminds me of portra 400 but slightly more pastel
AnalogCommunity,fp1psyl,t1_fp1pmw5,1588243939.0,O sad reacts. Do you have any photos you've taken with it? I'd love to see the results.
AnalogCommunity,fp1orv6,t1_fp1ojde,1588242938.0,Isn't it originally only sold in Japan? Wasn't sure if it was discontinued or sold only in Japan.
AnalogCommunity,fp1oavp,t3_gassyr,1588242467.0,Whered you get the film from?? I hear it's a good stock.
interestingasfuck,foma1v8,t3_g81yp6,1587882862.0,I'd love to see what Alexander the Great looks like if theres a bust of him. These renders make these powerful men look so ordinary (in today's culture)
photography,fol1pg1,t3_g7yruy,1587853149.0,"How did you pick the place to film? Since there's so much light pollution, what tips would you give to find a good place to do this?"
UCI,fnk9j8k,t3_g26p61,1587019180.0,"Apparently you only have to go once a year for them to charge you the full amount, from what a staff member told me. That's why they promote Late-night at the Arc every year to get students to go lol"
careerguidance,fnguk7c,t3_g1oyh0,1586945504.0,"Same, in the same boat there. Ive been applying for jobs as well. Try going to LightBox Expo in September to network with people in the industry. It also depends if you have a portfolio too and how well polished that is. But I guess the safer route would be to work and try to spend time building your portfolio and if you're confident in it then apply to jobs"
UnsentLetters,fnctx14,t3_g0ybxr,1586847077.0,"I felt that.

I was in the receiving end (same as the person you're addressing to) so it resonated with me so it's nice to see someone from the other side grieving instead of thinking I was the only one grieving. I hope all is well dude."
comicbooks,fncqe2m,t3_g0pyw3,1586843856.0,"I met him once at LACC 2017, he's literally the chillest artist I've met. I asked him why he came (cuz he's from Brazil) and he was like ""idk, they said they'd pay for my ticket so I was like okay."" I just thought that was so funny. And then he gave me an art board that had DC's logo and I was so shook and he was like ""they'll just give me more so don't worry about it."" 

Such a cool dude."
macbookpro,fn1qjln,t3_fyp00r,1586567794.0,You kinda get used to the dongle life after a while. It used to bother me but not anymore.
photomarket,fn1iisc,t1_fn1h3vn,1586562736.0,Oh how does using a d series lens work if the camera body does not have any function to autofocus? Like how pressing on the shutter button on a dslr will trigger it to focus?
photomarket,fn1ici8,t1_fn1i8y5,1586562630.0,Thanks for that!
photomarket,fn1gknb,t1_fn1gefv,1586561567.0,Ooo do sigma lens work or auto focus lens???
photomarket,fn1fvhy,t3_fyqffm,1586561156.0,"Just out of curiosity, what lens should a FM camera use? I have one but I'm not completely sure hahaha still a noob to my camera."
SkipBeat,fn0yi8q,t1_fmzi0jq,1586551235.0,Debatable
SkipBeat,fmzdc98,t3_fy7v0n,1586516250.0,I still can't get over how it took 10 years for Ren to tell Kyoko about his feelings. I recently picked up skip beat again after a busy season in life. üò≠
HongKong,fmnzak2,t3_fwcxky,1586239873.0,You could also tell by her accent that she's not really from Hong Kong. Hong Kong people have a distinct English accent and it's noticable that they have British influences in their accents. Chinese people on the other hand...
photomarket,fmnjjwv,t1_fmn99dn,1586227537.0,dannngggg good deal üëç
UCI,fmn2iwm,t1_fmn2b5k,1586216845.0,"Never had this teacher before. I feel like usually the teachers who teach summer session aren't usually bad teachers. They're a lot better than the ones during the school year, then again I could also be wrong. 

Just don't expect to get much out of soc sci 3a lol. Some people have the option to P/NP it (I had a friend who did)."
UCI,fmkixkk,t3_fvpgzv,1586156526.0,"I believe you only need 3 years but 4 years clears up another general requirement (I forgot which one). Check your degree works. Also check if you have received the right credits for the APs you have passed. UCI didn't count my AP credits on degree works and my transcript, even though they received it... I had to calculate it myself and dispute with the office admin about that. Almost got swindled out of getting credits üôÑ"
