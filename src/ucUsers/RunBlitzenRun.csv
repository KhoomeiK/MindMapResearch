1. Hamstrings: keep legs straight, bend over and touch your toes (or stop right before it starts to hurt)
2. Quads: bend one knee and grab the ankle with your hand (the really simple one everyone does)
3. Calves: lower heel one at a time on curb (or a stair)

summercamp,foog0rc,t3_g86sqb,1587938290.0,"This will likely all be superseded by the upcoming CDC guidance but my thoughts so far:

Health screenings: more intense screenings at the beginning and routine screenings throughout.

Fever response: anyone with covid-like symptoms will have to be presumed positive until tested. The whole camp may have to go into quarantine for up to 2 weeks.

Hygiene: increased mask-wearing and hand-washing

Social distancing: no more indoor activities with a lot of people. Outdoor activities will have to be spread out. Maybe fewer people at camp.

Supply sourcing: PPE (required for site maintenance too) and medical supplies. (Most other industrial supplies will likely still be easy to purchase.)

Surface disinfection: honesty this probably won't change too much. Sunlight inactivates the virus pretty quickly and food contact surfaces already have to be disinfected regularly. There will probably still need to be some additional surface disinfection.

\*\*\*

Some of this can be mitigated by:

* Rapid testing (e.g. the ability to test *everyone* and ensure their test is negative before they come on-site). This type of test theoretically exists but the main barriers for camps are logistics, cost/availability, and efficacy.
* Vaccine/serology (require proof of everyone on-site to have antibodies either through proof of a vaccine or a positive serology test)
* Low transmission rate and rapid/robust contact tracing for *every* covid positive in society. Not as ideal as the other two, but probably more likely in the short-term."

ucla,fmzfunb,t3_fxy4rl,1586518970.0,"There's a lot of nuance to student fees. The idea that the average student doesn't benefit from them just isn't true. Looking just at USAC fees, the vast majority of them go back to student orgs / student-initiated programs. Ever been in a student org meeting on campus? The room it was in was likely paid for by student fees. Ever read the Daily Bruin? Student fees support it. (And Daily Bruin reporting can sometimes bring light to important issues that ultimately improve student life.)

Students also benefit in indirect ways too. For instance, CPO (where that \~$2M went) supports access and retention for people from historically marginalized communities. Diversity on campus is helpful for *everyone*.

Yes, this is a bad time to raise student fees. But the bigger question ‚Äî¬†is what the fees are being spent on valuable to students? Is increasing the cost of attendance an appropriate way to pay for these things? Is it being managed enough? (Or is it being managed too much and limiting the usefulness of the money?)

Or should more clubs require dues, bruin bash charge for attendance, and wooden center charge for memberships? Would those things even survive if they had to charge?

Or is there a middle ground?

[Here are the descriptions of the existing student fees](https://sa.ucla.edu/RO/Fees/Public/public-fees). And here are [USAC's financial documents](https://usac.ucla.edu/funding/sga/) to show where (at least some of) the money is going.

I'm not advocating any particular way, just understand the tradeoffs when you decide your vote."

To be clear, we don't know much for certain since the virus hasn't been around that long. BUT public health authorities are saying that they basically don't have any evidence virus is being passed through food. Some reasons I've heard:

* COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. If you *swallow* the virus, it probably won't do anything. You'll need to breathe it in or absorb it through a mucous membrane (yes, the inside of your mouth is a mucous membrane).
* The virus doesn't reproduce on food (unlike other food-borne pathogens)
* The virus is likely inactivated at normal cooking temperatures
* Food service establishments have to follow strict requirements to prevent *all sorts* of pathogens from spreading. Those precautions likely prevent the coronavirus from spreading too.

So to get infected from the food itself, someone working at the restaurant would have to cough on the food after it's cooked and enough of the virus would have to stay viable until you eat it and it would have to be absorbed by your mouth's mucous membrane (again, in sufficient quantity) before being swallowed."

LosAngeles,fmnby8r,t1_fmmis1r,1586222616.0,"I'm unsure how that's in conflict with the Vox article. The questions I have after watching that:

* How infectious are microdroplets from a person shedding the novel coronavirus? (i.e. how much of that does someone need to breathe in to become infected? how long are the viruses in the droplets viable?)
* To what extent can different types of masks/fabrics prevent the release of microdroplets?
* How does this translate to public health?

A public health policy asking everyone to wear masks has risks. Most notably, [experts are worried](https://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/national/article240780786.html) that the public will wear masks incorrectly and *increase* their risk of getting infected. [We're not even quite sure](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs/v4heg36/coronavirus-is-it-airborne) how the virus spreads through the air yet. And this whole time, US public health agencies (including CDC) have been telling people to wear a mask if they think they're infected.

All that to say, there's not much concrete data (I'm talking peer-reviewed, quality, replicated studies) on any of this and I generally trust local public health officials ([not politicians](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/coronavirus-white-house-face-masks.html) or myself) to interpret what we have and make educated guesses. Policies can and *should* evolve over time. I don't think that makes public health agencies any less trustworthy."
specializedtools,fmhjcr9,t3_fv1wdo,1586082577.0,"My concern with this stuff is always the efficacy...

* What disinfectant is it using? Does the disinfectant inactivate the coronavirus?
* How much contact time does the disinfectant require? How can we be sure that contact time is being met?
* What about dirty carts? Many disinfectants don't work very well when stuff is dirty. And any sort of disinfection without some mechanical removal process first is questionable.

Then the risk is: if it's only marginally effective, does it give customers a false sense of security that causes them to act more recklessly?"
