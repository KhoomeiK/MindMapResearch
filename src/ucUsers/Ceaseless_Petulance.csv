Though, I agree with creating more practical programs to improve student employment opportunities/marketability. Especially with the Corona virus, the job market will be rough for years to come."

I've done a lot of introspection and talked to a lot of people to get some third party insight with what was going on. She was my first relationship ever. Mind you I wasn't looking for a relationship because I knew we were all transitioning from high school to college and that people change in college. I remember the few months we were unofficial I had some pretty lengthy discussions with her about things I found important: How is your relationships with your parents/siblings?, What do you want to do with your life?, What does this relationship mean to you?, What would you do if things didn't work out?, What is your history with relationships? How many have you had? How far has it gone? What have you learn from it?, What do you expect from a relationship?, What are your political opinions?, What is your opinions about alcohol or drugs?, What are you intentions with this relationship?. What do you think is the most important things to maintain in a relationship?, etc. As you can tell, I am straightforward about things and took it very seriously. I knew that high school sweet hearts have a very small chance of working out but after talking to her I felt that if things didn't work out at least we would talk things through. I fell in love with her because I didn't have to be fake, I was just being myself and she found that attractive and in turn I found her attractive. I didn't care about how she looked because appearances can be deceiving. I'm an introverted person but she opened me up to new experiences that were exciting. I was very happy to be with her but then my dad got deported and I couldn't give her as much attention that I was initially giving. I knew I wasn't the best boyfriend but I wasn't the worst. Our relationship wasn't toxic. She felt burnt out. It was just shocking because over the summer I was anticipating to spend more time with her and in general be a better boyfriend. I didn't expect to be shot down so terribly though. I shared my messages with some strangers and told them more of the details and they simply told me that she wasn't worth crying over and to remove her from my life. She texted me in the end that she didn't want to learn from the time we spent together and that she's going to learn at her own pace. I know we aren't an item anymore so I wasn't entitled to any honestly at that point. I apologized a lot and went on my way with no contact. I did a lot of self reflection and tried to piece everything together. The love blindfolds were off and I noticed some pretty drastic red flags. One of the most important one was transparency, my friend from Rhode Island (he goes to Brown University) would send me text messages at midnight asking me if I was a frat party. I would tell him no and he would explain that my girlfriend was. This happened quite a bit, I told her it isn't about what she did it, but that she wouldn't tell me what she was up to. I gave too much benefit of the doubt to her. Another one was that every time we walked down frat row she would recite each house and their activities but she wasn't doing well academically (she was getting C's in GE courses). I can see her prioritizes clearly now. After a few weeks, I hit up an old high school friend of mine who I knew as a person who likes to stalk everyone. I asked him what is my ex doing now and he was honest with me. He told me that she's been casually dating and is getting drunk at frat parties. That's what gave me the courage to finally lose my emotions I had for her. I realized I didn't lose anyone special. It was a mixture of relief and disappointment. I know that there are plenty of other people out there, I am taking to time to get over the past and when it's over I'm certain I can fall in love with someone all over again. My mindset is that I don't need to put any effort to find someone, I'll just meet someone and we will click and it'll feel right."
