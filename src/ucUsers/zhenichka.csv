Then after I did some reading, I found that there is actually a large amount of medical research that says our gut flora has a lot to do with our overall health, moods, and energy levels."
AmItheAsshole,fp9eccf,t1_fp8vult,1588423855.0,"Remember, skin care isnâ€™t gendered, just the stupid branding! Just because youâ€™re a guy doesnâ€™t mean you shouldnâ€™t feel comfortable in your own skin. There are good skin care subreddits that can give you advice and help you learn to take care of it and maybe even help fix your skin natural moisture barrier! Nothing wrong with using a â€˜womenâ€™sâ€™ branded body wash or even using good body lotion after every shower! maybe something like eucerin shower oil will help as well."
AmItheAsshole,fp9dycx,t1_fp8rvnl,1588423532.0,Great advice here.
PanPorn,fp7rtr2,t1_fp77qk5,1588376481.0,"Omg. Dry lizard person, thatâ€™s hilarious.  I have never tried it in my hair actually. Do you like it? Iâ€™ve got curly hair, so Iâ€™m super down to try anything moisturizing."

PanPorn,fp5z9hv,t3_gbis5d,1588343031.0,"This is my second month of tracking my pans. First month I did a massive purge of all the stuff that I had been holding on to that had just a bit left here and there, so that felt really good.  Got pan shy for some reason and never ended up posting it though. 

This months wins and repurchases - Clinique lash power mascara, I bought a 3pack a while back, itâ€™s my daily HG, love how easy the tubing is and how easy it is to take off. The Ordinary hemi-squalane oil is a lovely one as well, I live in a super dry cold climate so I add a few drops most nights to whatever moisturizer I use.  

This was my first bottle of Lumene Glow Boost. I liked it, feels nice on the skin, but I think Iâ€™ll only repurchase if I find it on a decent sale (if I donâ€™t end up trying new heavier vit C formulas before then) 

As for the Babor Ampoules... oi vey. I got a week of the Glow and Moisture series. The Hydra Plus (Intense moisture) made my skin soooo dry and flaky on my cheeks it was honestly insane. After that it was the multi-vitamin which was... fine. And then the Perfect Glow, which I found had like a light... shimmer in it, not sure what causes it, but I just, donâ€™t like the idea of putting anything like that pretending itâ€™s â€˜skincareâ€™. Overall after a week.... the best part was popping open the glass ampoules themselves it was weirdly fun. 

Bonus toss this month is the carbonated bubble clay mask... Iâ€™ve had this sitting in the back for like at least four years and I decided if Iâ€™m going to make a commitment to being better to my skin, it was time to toss this guy (canâ€™t recall if this horrible smell occurred when I first got it, but you ladies taught me it is better to be safe than sorry with my skin)"

My friend is going through the same thing, can barely produce milk and the more people freak out on her over it, the harder itâ€™s become for her. Sheâ€™s had to have her husband pick up all the formula because she kept getting pure evil looks and judgement."

AmItheAsshole,fojwhin,t1_foiu05c,1587830810.0,"Even toddlers are entitled to bodily autonomy. Good luck with your â€˜relationshipâ€™ because the moment sheâ€™s kicked out, she has no need for you in her life. Youâ€™ve given her no reason to respect you, just fear you. Youâ€™re literally the dictator you described."
BritishTV,fo9tixt,t3_g5xk43,1587630631.0,So pleased.
SCAcirclejerk,fo2071v,t1_fo136yn,1587445883.0,"I agree with you on most stuff, but sheâ€™s definitely not with welsh or hyram. Sheâ€™s makes it super clear every time that she is not a derm, and has just been obsessed with the science behind skin for a long time, and always offers lower priced and drugstore options if fancy things have dupes that are more worth it. She definitely has like super reactive expressions when she does those reaction videos but I think itâ€™s mostly just like the genre... you should see her progression, I feel like out of all of them, she had the worsttt skin when she started on YouTube and showed all the nitty gritty bad parts of trying to figure out what worked."

He has respect enough for his mother to not allow people that blatantly disrespected her to freely enjoy the privilege of attending his family gathering. Families stick together, and they cut themselves out when they were so rude."

If for some reason you decide to stay with this asshole, the next time this happens, just assert dominance and piss in his car instead of in the bottle."

Yup, and mine is named Alex as well actually."
