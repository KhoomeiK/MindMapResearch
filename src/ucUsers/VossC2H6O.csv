But back to the point. The process of a  timely and fair grade submit is a student's right. They purposely withheld those grades with known knowledge it would affect undergrad students. TAs also have the right to protest. But they do not have the right to obstruct basic student rights. Many posts have correctly said the high housing costs are due to the NIMBY boomers who refuse housing projects in the town to increase property values and also the astroturf hippies in the past who refuse to build housing on campus."

UCSC,fn4s3zk,t3_fzkcrb,1586647764.0,"In my personal opinion, if you're a STEM major, you will never have to deal with anyone's political views directly if that makes you feel any better. In the humanities however, it is a massive liberal bubble which in my opinion isn't really good.I am a [social capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy) POC if you really want my background. I've seen many people who say they are left leaning attack the College Republican table when they have their tents around the school. When I say attack, I don't mean physically fight with the people but rather take their stuff and throw them around, destroy their posters, and knock their tent down. This isn't good and makes us look bad. 

1) RCC is fine. You will find people who are right leaning everywhere in the world.The university itself is fairly liberal but the town itself is conservative leaning. You will not get the crazy evangelicals here though. About your comments in parenthesis, it is better to just deal with them rather than full avoidance. You learn to avoid creating your own ideology bubble which is crucial in human development as college is meant to break your ideological bubble in the first place. There are plenty of resources there that deal with real bigotry here on campus. 

2) You might get edgy people who use racial jokes but never up to the point where it is a clear hate crime. 

3) Themes in terms of academics only matter for the first quarter English core class. It doesn't really matter for the rest of the time usually. Most people are very tolerate of your sex, sexual preferences, religion, and others. 

4) UCSC is very LGBT friendly. You see ppl of many strides everywhere. I believe Porter is usually the go to for LGBT folks as there is a floor that is completely decided to the community. You would apply on the housing application if you wish to live in that community. 

5)As a freshman since you're away from your parents/guardians who may keep a check on your academics. As a result, procrastination is common with most freshmen students. UCSC is a quarter system and if you don't attend to class for even 2 classes in a row, you are so behind that sometimes you cannot recover for the rest of the quarter. My advice is to find a group of classmates and create study groups. This group will help you stay in check."
