I rarely comment here, but seeing the number of y t a here is making me mad. I'm so sick of the idea that blood relations should be held above all. It's okay to feel upset that your parents showed favoritism, it's okay to feel a bit vindicated when everything that you said would happen did happen. You have no obligation to financially support your sisters kid and your parents. You have your own shit you need to take care of, and you said it to her. 

If you had said that you the child's face it would have been another story, but you didn't."
