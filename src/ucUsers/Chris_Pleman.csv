ucla,fnbwudr,t3_g06mdh,1586823908.0,"I think it’s important for you to get multiple perspectives on the major. I’m currently in 101C and chem 153A and things are tough because I lack motivation. Although the courses are challenging, I think they can be interesting, and at the very least, doable. Although I’m not saying 100% go for it, I’m saying that you shouldn’t put all of your faith into one post good or bad. 
Good luck on all of your endeavors nevertheless!"
