It seems like professors are making things harder to make up for online learning. It doesn’t make sense because online learning is harder. Anyway, stay strong friend! You got this, time will just fly by"

Since professors require you to scan answer sheets now and send it in, having an iPad can save you a lot of time. Also, you’ll be saving a lot of paper and it makes learning fun."
