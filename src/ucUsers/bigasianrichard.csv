This is where ya know, it'd be nice if our federal gov't was helping students out instead of dishing out corporate welfare but what do I know."

UCI,fo14xvo,t3_g4omk8,1587425833.0,"- Do you want to go to school with mostly privileged kids more focused on partying and social events OR

- Go to a CC and pull yourself up by your bootstraps. 

Not saying one is better than the other, but the reality is both are very different experiences. Some transfers like myself acknowledge that you miss out on a very formative part of college life, aka freshman dorming and all that partying, but at the same time are those two years worth $50k to you? Freshman can't drink anyways so who gives AF.

If you do well in CC you can transfer in easily, cut your total education costs in half. If you enter the CS program and don't do well, you can fail out just as easily if you party too hard.

Ask yourself what you want out of school and if living at home for another 2 years is okay with you. Different strokes fo different folks."

You aren't even old enough to drink yet, young zygote.

If you aren't a neckbeard and can do your own research, you'd find that being in the middle of Orange County has tons of benefits. It's not a city where you can walk outside your shitty high-density NYC highrise apt to go down the street to a dive bar, but you can mountain bike and surf, eat lots of good Omomo, and smoke weed in the middle of Aldrich under the great oaks."

Sure, but this shit costs millions of dollars in infrastructure work. Funding would need to be allocated. If you start polling students if they're willing to increase their tuition by x-amount for future students' security, you'll start encountering resistance."
