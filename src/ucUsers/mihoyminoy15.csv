MichaelJackson,fotz6g9,t1_foqhmpx,1588071306.0,"I agree, I sometimes wonder if Prince would have made a better impact in terms of music quality if he was a session musician, considering he wasted musical talent on bad songs as a solo artist. Then again, I wonder if people like Prince because its a giant inside joke to do so. Kinda along the same lines as Rick Atsley. Something is so bad that you start ironically liking it because the poor quality is amusing. Some weird Stockholm syndrome reverse psychosis going on."

spongebob,fmvi1oh,t3_fx5fwo,1586417724.0,"The problem is  they changed the way spongebob‚Äôs character operates (I don‚Äôt want to go quite with the word personality). In S1-3, Spongebob would stumble into a problem in a creative, humorous way, whereas S4 onward he would kind of go on an ‚Äúadventure‚Äù every episode thereafter, relying less on comedy and more on colorful flashiness. Similarly, his naivety got him out of his predicament at the by the end of a S1-3 episode in a quirky way, whereas he kind of ‚Äúsaved the day‚Äù more often S4 onward. It kind of morphed into a cliche plotline in the seasons following Hillenburg stepping down as the showrunner. A good example of this is comparing Club Spongebob to Squidtastic Voyage. In a club Spongebob Squidward‚Äôs stubbornness flings them into a forest, and Spongebob reacts by talking to a Magic 8 ball to survive. Squidtastic Voyage, on the other hand, relies on Spongebob going on an adventure in shrunken submarine inside Squidward and doing a dance move he learned in the beginning of the episode to save Squidward. Creative/Unique vs Predictable/Cliche"
