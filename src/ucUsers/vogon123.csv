berkeley,fpmqx8r,t1_fplg0vq,1588739399.0,I personally know members of Courtney's family. No. They don't want revenge. They want change.
UCSantaBarbara,fplsae6,t1_fpljn47,1588718506.0,What from Ochem carries over to the biochem series?
UCSantaBarbara,fplrilx,t1_fplr4do,1588718087.0,Not too bad. I mean it's not like totally easy or anything-- it's still a class. But it's very reasonable/manageable.
summonerschool,fplmkkk,t1_fplbcez,1588715433.0,That's probably more of a correlation vs causation sorta thing. The adc's who tend to pick up Hammer first are usually lane bullies like Lucian.
UCSantaBarbara,fpksttn,t3_ge1gux,1588700430.0,"Oof that's unfortunate. My GE prof is super reasonable, and the workload is really not too bad. Thtr184AA with Dr.McMahon."

ShitPostCrusaders,fp54i5s,t1_fp4w4gc,1588316032.0,Wait part 8 has an actual villain now?!? I’m a few months behind
UCSantaBarbara,fp0qhhi,t1_fp0k0ca,1588214688.0,"idk I mean I dropped the course— but for reference I’ve had a 4.0 average for the like 7 GE’s I’ve taken and I felt compelled to drop the class because I didn’t think I would do well. Is it impossible to do well in that class? No, but it will likely take a lot of work. Try going to office hours for your TA/Professor as much as you can because the grading for the class is really subjective."
UCSantaBarbara,foza00a,t1_fotl7es,1588187166.0,"They're somewhat challenging classes ... but med school is so much harder that it's not even comparable. If you can't make yourself get through Ochem/Intro Bio, you're likely not going to do ok in med school. This doesn't apply to everyone-- but it's generally applicable."
UCSantaBarbara,foz9nsy,t1_fosvtko,1588187001.0,Yeah that many people do fail pretty much. Or they change majors. But also not everyone in the gen chem series is a bio major.
UCSantaBarbara,foz9jhy,t1_fospuki,1588186945.0,I don't remember where but I remember seeing something like that online. If I remember correctly most were right around 3.1/3.0.
UCSantaBarbara,foz92vn,t3_g9ysmn,1588186724.0,I took it for about a week or two before I dropped. P/NP it if u can that class was not at all reasonable with its workload/grading/everything else.
biology,foutmpt,t1_fousvew,1588090204.0,You know what’s weird? DMSO smells kinda like nacho cheese.
UCSantaBarbara,fosgj6a,t1_fosg9dg,1588030266.0,Ahahaha yeah I got curved down in physics lab. My 90% turned into a B which was really stupid— at least it was only a 1 unit class.
UCSantaBarbara,fosb7v0,t3_g9a181,1588027333.0,"Yeah it's starting to look more and more like Fall will be online ... UCSB is a petri dish for diseases during normal times, now it's 10x worse. I hope they'll do some limited phase in for students who need the in person labs like Chem majors and whatnot-- but I don't see it working because everyone's going to try and come back even if Fall ends up being online."
UCSantaBarbara,fosb0ed,t3_g9b1zy,1588027223.0,Depends on the major. STEM + Econ classes are more or less graded on a bell curve. What major?
YIMO,forjtrb,t3_g955pg,1588013435.0,"What I like to do is rush bloodrazor, then buy T1 boots, get pickaxe+Recurve bow, and then finish T2 boots then finish rageblade. Always Mercs/Tabis."
UCSantaBarbara,fooib44,t3_g8mugb,1587939514.0,I just hope they don’t curve down/fuck us on the next one
UCSantaBarbara,foionsv,t3_g7i46a,1587792227.0,What's the time control?
UCSantaBarbara,fohix1f,t3_g6yf3v,1587766721.0,This ... is satire right?
UCSantaBarbara,foe8clh,t3_g6um9k,1587698102.0,"The average score posted on gauchospace is based on all of the sections. Your individual classes curve is TA based, make sure you get the averages from your TA— in 6CL I was 5% above the posted averages on all the labs and I ended up with a B— don’t be fooled like me.

UCSantaBarbara,fobt9f3,t3_g6q9ki,1587663421.0,"Math 3A/3B at this school isn't too difficult. It's not a weeder class or anything like in some other schools. The best way to succeed in classes like this is to do a lot of practice problems, and understand the material well. What I found success with is finding supplemental material to the lecture, I really liked Professor Leonard's Calculus Series-- and doing tons of practice problems. Try to keep an open mind and not have a mental block."
UCSantaBarbara,fobslam,t3_g6qc1b,1587663220.0,Depends. Give us some more information on your career goals/interests/anything.
UCSantaBarbara,fo15xy2,t3_g3wqu7,1587426417.0,"1B was a decent amount harder than 1A. You have to really understand the material. That comes by doing the textbook problems, practice exam questions, and the lecture examples over again. It's not enough to just know how to do things, but also try and understand the why. If you understand the why behind the calculations you should be set for his conceptual questions. His tests are about the same difficulty as Joseph's, except his final. His final is p hard."

UCSantaBarbara,fnay8p3,t1_fn2ew5y,1586805929.0,Dining halls are pretty solid. Decent food. UCLA allegedly has the best among the UC’s. But from what I hear we’re pretty up there.
UCSantaBarbara,fnay4k5,t1_fn2twas,1586805871.0,"Having 3 people in a dorm wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be initially. A double also isn’t a bad choice but they’re pretty popular so you might not get one. Imo Santa Rosa is the best of the Chi-5, locationwise and otherwise. I personally wouldn’t recommend living in FT because you’d spend like an hour a day just getting to and from the dorm— some of my friends didn’t mind that, but I’d go crazy."
UCSantaBarbara,fnaxujb,t1_fn42bns,1586805732.0,14 or 17 is pretty standard. Unlimited is kind of a waste for the vast majority of people.
YIMO,fmyy9yn,t1_fmywpyj,1586499619.0,Ignite has been meta on Yi for some time now buddy. Gives him better early dueling power and better ganking power. Flash is a very mediocre summ on Yi.
YIMO,fmpewk2,t1_fmofv30,1586279608.0,Yeah but he’s also really strong before this buff. Especially in low elo like silver/bronze. His winrate is nearing oppressive for a low skill floor champ.
