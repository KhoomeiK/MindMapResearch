ADHD,fnf7rbn,t1_fn857l5,1586902967.0,"Here's how.
Dopamine is synthesized thusly.
Protein from food is broken down into its constituent amino acids. 
Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid. 
This is catabolyzed into the amino acid tyrosine.
Tyrosine is then hydroxylated by tyrosine hydroxylase to yield L-DOPA.
L-DOPA is barely present in the body because it is so rapidly converted into dopamine.
Dopamine is then converted to the neurotransmitter norepinephrine
Which is then converted into adrenaline
Which is then converted to an inactive metabolite and removed from the blood by the kidneys.

Only phenylalanine, tyrosine, and L-DOPA can cross the blood brain barrier.
Beware: caution is necessary here. Chronic excess dopaminergic agonism can cause irreversible changes including but not limited to tardive dyskinesia. I now have a permanent tic in my thumb as a result of cautious experimentation here.

I advise against L-DOPA, as it is more dangerous.
I advise one 500mg capsule of tyrosine not more than once per week. Taken on an empty stomach, this will take effect in about five hours and give you a boost of dopamine which has been, in my experience, very useful.
I haven't got a recommendation for phenylalanine. I haven't experimented here enough. I expect it would take longer to hit than tyrosine and l-dopa, and may take a larger dose.

L-DOPA is commonly used to treat Parkinson's. It is the standard treatment. This has become controversial in recent years, as it seems to alleviate symptoms while accelerating the underlying progression of the disease. To that end, certain MAOIs have been developed: rasagiline, and selegiline. Selegiline may be in the patch you're describing, if you're taking Emsam.

One way Parkinson's may work is this. It is a fact that dopamine metabolism is neurotoxic. The metabolites are neurotoxic, and involve the formation of H2O2 in the synaptic cleft, directly adjacent to the mitochondria that populate the synaptic terminal: both MAO-A & B are bound to the mitochondrial membrane.

When healthy folks take MDMA, some neurotoxicity occurs. The going hypothesis is that serotonin is depleted, and the transport protein that normally brings serotonin into the cell mistakenly takes in dopamine, which is at flood-level activity. (DA can also diffuse across the plasma membrane of neurons). When this dopamine is taken in and metabolized in an environment that is only supposed to be handling serotonin, the cell is not prepared to deal with DA's toxic metabolites. ""Pruning"" of the dendritic arbor is seen in microscope views of cells.

Perhaps in Parkinson's, the cells that produce dopamine, i.e., the substantia nigra et al, do not express the enzymes needed to deal with dopamine's toxic metabolites to the degree that they should. Such a phenomenon would indeed be genetic, and would lead to the destruction of the substantia nigra and the loss of the neuromelanin that forms when dopamine in abundance polymerizes.

l-phenylalanine, tyrosine, l-dopa, and for serotonin, l-tryptophan, and 5-HTP are commonly available in the supplement sections of health food shops, vitamin stores, and bodybuilding supplement stores.

Prescriptions for selegiline and rasagiline can be obtained from your psychiatrist, general practitioner, endocrinologist, or neurologist. 

Take it from me: MAOIs may be a better route for you. But everyone works differently. To each their own. 

Note: I am not a medical professional. None of the above is medical advice.

Put money into S&P500 index funds like SPY, SPYD, and SPLG. As soon as your automatic deposit accumulates enough to buy another share, do it. Dollar cost averaging the market as a whole is very effective and limits risk."
