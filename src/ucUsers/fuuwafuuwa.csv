Lineplay,fo48bhu,t3_g5lbad,1587499923.0,"I can give you info on Heart Events cause they‚Äôre super simple. All you really have to do is just read the Heart Event post and follow all their rules but here‚Äôs a more detailed explanation. 

Pros:
‚Ä¢ Fast to join
‚Ä¢ Easy hearts

Cons:
‚Ä¢ Hearts might take a while to be sent to you (up to two weeks) 
‚Ä¢ You have to fill your diary with spam 

Heart events pics usually look like ‚ô•Ô∏é=‚ô•Ô∏é‚ô•Ô∏é‚ô•Ô∏é or something. This is saying that by joining the event and sending one heart to the host you get 3 hearts in return! Some host give out more hearts, obviously those are the most popular ones. 

Very important, make sure you use the correct ‚Äòset‚Äô emoji and that you number yourself correctly when commenting. Refresh the post multiple times to make sure you‚Äôre in the right set/number. Sets go up to 19 most of the time, and the host has a key in their post of which sets are open/closed 

The catch is that the host does expect some easy stuff in return. While most events are similar in requirements still make sure to check the whole post. Always they ask to be Hearted, make sure you heart them the day of join. And they almost always asked to have their heart event post shared. They may also ask for footsteps etc. 

3 hearts from one heart event isn‚Äôt gonna be much. People join and rejoin heart events multiple times to rack up a good amount. But that means a ton of spam from heart event sharing in their diaries lol. 

How to find Heart Events? I usually find one heart event post from a friend or something and click on the Avas who have joined. People usually shared/joined more than one Heart Event and so I find from there lol. 

Heart Trades are a tiny bit more tricky but I‚Äôll also send u the info if u want."

DragonRajaMobile,fnpz775,t3_g35scu,1587154686.0,"I‚Äôm a f2p that loves SEA mobile games. I play a handful of mobile games so I‚Äôm not new to p2w aspects and such. 

First thing first. People have to understand that mobile games are FREE to download for a reason. It‚Äôs not a mistake, it‚Äôs not out of good heart, it‚Äôs not because the devs love what they do. 

Mobile games are free because they make their profit through in-game purchases. With that in mind, please remember that unless you spend 1,000$+ minimum you will not be top in the leaderboards or be able to achieve 100% collection or completion. 

Ok with that out of the way, I think Dragon Raja is a great keep-busy game. You go on quests and do mini-game events to grow your character. You go at your own pace. There‚Äôs tons of different areas to focus on to build power. There‚Äôs also side-quest stuff to do and tons of NPCs to interact with. 

What‚Äôs kept me hooked is the more social aspect of the game. I joined a nice active club and everyday we give each other advice, get hyped for Club wars, and do dungeons together. 

Even if I‚Äôm a f2p, I can still do all dungeons and events. Which is honestly the most important to get gear and other goodies. 

PvP is hell because if you‚Äôre a f2p expect to get stomped by p2w. However you don‚Äôt need to do PvP. It‚Äôs not essential for anything other than a few events, but to get technical you don‚Äôt actually need to fight anyone to complete some PvP events, it‚Äôs more collect/finding items. 

On the note of clubs. I‚Äôm in a f2p club and we have stomped Whale clubs during Club Wars (PvP mode) because we actually strategize and have many people attend. It‚Äôs possible to outskill p2w and has been done. 

What I like most is the Challenge dungeons. You CANNOT auto-play these dungeons. Therefore, you need to figure out the mechanics and be smart about how you play. No paying your way out of this one. 

**TL;DR Dragon Raja has tons of stuff to keep f2p busy. Do expect to get stomped in PvP, but it‚Äôs not necessary to advance. You get the most out of the game if you have an active and involved club.**"

ucr,fn8z9j9,t3_g0ast7,1586754409.0,"ayyy internal issues twins! 

I‚Äôm finishing my second year feeling the exact same way you do. No parties, no huge group of friends, no bf, and generally just stay within UCR. 

I have some friends and we went out to eat lunch a few times but nothing really exciting. I also consider myself pretty easy going and open to talk to people but things never really lead anywhere lol

While it is disheartening at times I guess it‚Äôs important to remember that at least things are going well in other ways. Whether it be academically, health wise, financially etc. 

It‚Äôs not a bad thing to want to live your life to the fullest. Sooo many times I‚Äôve heard older people in my life tell me that ‚Äúyour 20s are the best time of your life!‚Äù 
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs shallow to want more connection and interactions with people your age, that‚Äôs normal. 

Anyways I‚Äôm sure things will come around. We still got years ahead of us!"
