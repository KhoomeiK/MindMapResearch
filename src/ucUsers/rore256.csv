Having trouble with both my box and teambuilding. In particular, not sure which units are good subs and inherits. I'm stuck on some of the end-game stuff.   

* Coming back from a hiatus, I'm a bit behind on what units are good subs and assists and I also have a lot of units to go through so it's pretty hard to tell even looking 1 at a time. 
* Stuck on Ultimate Arena - Three Hands of Fate
* Also stuck on Alt. Ultimate Arena - Alt. Three Hands of Fate
* Would also like to clear Challenge level 10 (For this month), but that one seems super hard. 
* In general, I've been using my old Barbara & Julie Team, but recently I noticed that Alice (From SAO) is a good lead so I've been trying to put together a good team for her (not really sure what subs/latents/assists to use)

I think I have some good leads, although most may be outdated. In terms of subs, I really don't know what makes a units viable, similarly for assists and latents."
