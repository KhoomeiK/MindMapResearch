MtF,fpgyqsd,t1_fpfygfz,1588611896.0,"It’s unfortunate but it definitely exists. At my school people in greek life (mostly men but women too) throw around a lot of sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and even racist language very casually. I’m lucky that many of my brothers are supporting me but I don’t know if that’d be true of other houses at my school."
MtF,fpfikir,t1_fpfheeq,1588572329.0,Exactly!! And it’s so fun
MtF,fpfgotz,t1_fpfg8vf,1588570711.0,For now I’m staying. I stepped down from my position though because I’m gonna be a lot less involved. But there’s a lot of people I love there yknow. 3 years of college together

berkeley,fo4ps9y,t1_fo4pihh,1587508876.0,What do you recommend is more important for Data Science? I'm a rising senior so I have 2 (or 3 if I take summer courses) semesters left. I was thinking about taking EE126 or STAT140 to hone in my probability skills.
MtF,fo3tjzy,t1_fo3l0ke,1587492710.0,Thanks for this :) definitely agree he can’t tell me how to identify for sure. That conversation just set off a line of thinking again that I’ve had on and off over the past few months. This shit is *hard*. Honestly I’m down to abolish gender. Does that make me enby? Lol
MtF,fnylapu,t3_g4nkju,1587366665.0,"For me almost every time I came out to someone - including my parents - it took a lot of thinking and courage building up, as well as the pressure of *if I don’t tell someone I’m gonna explode*. I’m not fully out but I’m out to my parents and a good number of friends. If you’re having trouble saying it to them out loud, maybe write a letter explaining everything and leave it where they will read it. 

Hang in there, you got this💙"
MtF,fny6q7n,t3_g4kqra,1587354770.0,Let us know how it goes!!
Bass,fnwce4n,t1_fnvy41f,1587315689.0,"Recorded video through my iPhone XR and bass through a Scarlett 2i4 into GarageBand (still saving up for Logic!). Edited the audio in GB, video in Adobe Premiere, and I made the YouTube thumbnail in Illustrator. I’m a college student and my school provides adobe creative suite for free which is awesome."

lgbt,fmwqx0i,t3_fxveud,1586451448.0,"We have a beautiful community in r/MtF if you feel like joining. For me, I only realized I was bi then trans at 20 and it’s been a battle with internalized trans and homophobia for about a year now, maybe longer. For some of us, it’s a long road to accepting who you are, and that’s okay. We’re here to support you, whatever your identity is :)"
lgbt,fmwqbfz,t3_fxufyn,1586451144.0,"Took me a while through a lot of journaling and self reflection. I had a lot of internalized trans and homophobia so it took a lot. My first big clues were finding r/egg_irl and reading it nonstop, then scrolling through all the different trans subreddits. I realized I was looking for a sign - which was a sign in itself! And finally I accepted my identity. Now I’m slowly tip toeing out of the closet."
