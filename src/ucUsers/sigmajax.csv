ACTrade,fnu3ltf,t3_g3soe0,1587253873.0,"At first I disliked Egbert, but he is now my favorite character. One time he started going off about how the trees dropping three kinds of wood doesn’t make sense and definitely “broke the fourth wall” and was talking about being trapped in a video game. Poor Egbert...."
ACTrade,fnu3bi7,t3_g3r2mn,1587253720.0,"My IGN is Jackattack and I have been living with my parents. I’ve been staying with them for about a month now despite still paying rent on my apartment :( but it’s super worth it. Last night my mom made a cheese ball but shaped it into a pyramid and added round rits, square saltines, and triangular triscuts. I kept yelling about the Illuminati, and they got a good laugh out of it.

Cheese “ball” for proof

ACTrade,fnu2mzj,t3_g3wp81,1587253354.0,"I absolutely love Egbert. At first I thought he was really lame because he wasn’t as cute or cool as the others. But he is so weird and I adore him for it. My dad was watching me play and made a comment how it didn’t make sense that the tree dropped three different kinds of wood, and then the next day Egbert made the same comment. He’s always commenting about how things don’t make sense in the game. I’m pretty sure he’s on something. And talks to his bugs. Omg. He’s amazing."
ACTrade,fnu28sk,t3_g3h203,1587253137.0,"For a second, I forgot what the flair on this subreddit meant and thought “The Galapagos isn’t in the PST time zone!! What is this person doing announcing the time in PST.” Oof, so embarrassing.... 

Here’s something nice: my mom made a cheese ball, except she molded into a pyramid and served it with round rits, triangular triscuts, and square saltine crackers. I yelled Illuminati confirmed for hours!! It was fun, and my mom appreciated that I am visiting for the rest of quarantine since she would normally be having guests over this weekend and is a little sad she isn’t.

Ps: Are rits named rits because they are round? Also Nabisco stands for national biscuit company. FUN FACT!
