PathOfExileBuilds,fpatnbb,t1_fpalww6,1588455468.0,nope only relevant phasing conditionals are raider and voidwalker as far as I know. wiki is usually good for checking this kind of thing though.
pathofexile,fpa80ts,t3_gc4bza,1588442679.0,I highly recommend using some basic AHK scripts to make your life easier and to protect your wrists. I can't play without mild wrist pain unless I use a flask macro.
PathOfExileBuilds,fp02vrp,t3_gafrg6,1588201462.0,"At a glance, this build doesn't look amazing. I think there are better options than The Covenant, and Vaal BV is probably not worth using. I suggest working from Mathil's FP assassin (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0jWh7cu3RQ) or this reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/9ae6ew/freezing_pulse_assassin_self_cast_uber_elder/) as a base. If you want to spend more money and be stronger, the highest dps version of these would probably be to go low life with Shav's. Both of these builds are a little old (particularly, they don't use cluster jewels, which can almost certainly improve them), so there might be some new things you can do to eke out extra power - for example, Badge of the Brotherhood + frenzy charge on crit influence mod on body armour probably beats out Pandemonius.  

Some additional notes: life and mana leech is tough for selfcast. Atziri's flask helps for life leech but it's got a short duration so I don't like relying on it. For cold hits, imo you have two good options: 1. go life w/ EB, getting 0.2% cold life leech from a ring (and maybe the 2% enchant from boots to help out more) and some ES leech from the tree to sustain mana. 2. just go low life, get ES leech from tree, and probably have to use enduring mana flask to sustain mana for single target, although it's possible you can get enough mana regen to not need it."
pathofexile,foscmda,t3_g9a3fd,1588028097.0,"it's solid, but I think there are better options for damage that are cheaper, since even with ryslathas the phys ranges are not that huge. I don't think many attack builds can find success with EO since that blocks crit and impale, the two best sources for attacks. I personally tried this combo with ground slam permastun build since I wanted to abuse it to get consistent highrolls for stuns, it could clear everything except for delirium orbed t16s (~2.5mil dps with buffs). with medium to high investment, I would expect you could get up to 5-8mil dps with real weapons and not wasting time on stun, but you'd almost definitely get more just by respeccing into crit ele or impale pure phys. basically, not worth it unless you have a special reason to overvalue single large hits"

dps numbers won't be great because different builds might have different amounts of %inc duration. this calculator should work but I haven't tried it myself"

UCSantaBarbara,fmz1dlm,t1_fmyukug,1586502753.0,they wrote it's twice but one of them was wrong so everyone is right I guess
UCSantaBarbara,fmpzofv,t3_fwnzx0,1586290232.0,"I agree with MOTrap's comment. To add on, if you're only taking one class, imo 115A won't be that great - it's designed to familiarize you with the SE and the linear algebra of QM, but the interesting applications don't really come until 115B/C and other things like materials and condensed matter. I have no idea if 110A will be relevant to chemistry but it's definitely very tied in to materials."
pathofexile,flw9y6t,t1_flw83n3,1585543779.0,"correct, and they are additive with each other"
