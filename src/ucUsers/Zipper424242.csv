ShitPostCrusaders,fpilcli,t1_fpiiulq,1588643305.0,This is so batshit insane I have to believe it. Only Araki could think of a plot this crazy.
UCSantaBarbara,fpf1ioa,t3_gcyvek,1588559625.0,My sister is graduating SB this year and did not go to a single party in her time there. It’s there if you want it and not if you don’t.
comicbookmovies,fpf1e81,t3_gcu25a,1588559545.0,"This is honestly one of my favorite MCU movies. The humor is top notch, the humanism of Tony is just so well done, the music is iconic, and the action is some of the best (my all time favorite scenes in the MCU are Tony going “home alone” on AIM and the other scene where he’s tied up and beats the thugs with only one gauntlet). I can get why it’s so divisive, but when you try to avoid making judgements about the movie because of the Mandarin twist, it’s very enjoyable as a superhero film that’s totally removed from the comics story of origin."
AskReddit,fpbagqz,t3_gc8xe2,1588465607.0,"Scrolled down a bit and am a bit surprised that I didn’t Infinity War (maybe I didn’t look far down enough) but for those who weren’t as familiar with the comics the snap was totally unexpected and even people like myself who are bigger comics nerds didn’t expect characters like Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and Star Lord to get snapped."
StarWarsLeaks,fp70tem,t1_fp6zptd,1588361989.0,*sigh*... hate to say it but I’ve gotten that vibe a lot since Disney took over... they’ve done really well with some things but other times it feels like they didn’t know the established lore at all.
NetflixBestOf,fp6r9oo,t1_fp6n66q,1588357228.0,That’s also plausible!
NetflixBestOf,fp6lahw,t1_fp6i09a,1588354287.0,"Fun fact: he liked that part so much when he saw it that he requested them to rewind the film multiple times so that he could see it again and again. 

Also fun fact: In that same scene, Doc asks if Jane Wyman is the First Lady... Reagan divorced her in 1949, and married Nancy in 1952, three years before Marty arrived. I’ve always chalked this up to Doc being a scientist who’s out-of-touch with pop culture, but it’s a funny thing I (who’s a trained expert on Reagan’s life for my work) just noticed on my last rewatch."
StarWarsTheories,fp6k0s2,t3_gb7sfm,1588353660.0,"I mean technically speaking, this is plausible if she goes the same “Vader killed Anakin” route Obi-Wan does in the prequels. The last time she saw Anakin WOULD be when he rushed off to save the Chancellor... she could have seen only Vader on Mustafar."
StarWarsLeaks,fp6jbv1,t3_gbhppc,1588353323.0,"Is anyone else annoyed by Padme being directly in the center, half dark and half light like she’s a morally gray character, or is it just me?"
saltierthancrait,fp6j05o,t3_gbfekh,1588353165.0,"There’s also the fact that the Sith are gone at this point in time and I highly doubt any villain Disney can create will be able to compete. A story is only as good as its villains, as clearly seen in the MCU, after all..."

saltierthancrait,fp6h6zy,t1_fp6h1ps,1588352279.0,"Maybe put the latter half in small letters in the corner? Similarly to “items not sold together” “batteries not included” or something...

StarWarsLeaks,fp6gl9h,t1_fp6g2e6,1588351985.0,Thank you!
saltierthancrait,fp6ghxh,t1_fp6ga20,1588351938.0,"Honestly though! I never thought of it that way but I’m going to consider the DT as just that from now on- three story DLCs that are purely “what if” scenarios, same as the one in The Force Unleashed 2 where you can kill Han, Leia, and Chewie... except that one was actually fun and a decent story.

Edit: Clarified the game and DLC"
saltierthancrait,fp6gamc,t3_gbloni,1588351840.0,And why the heck is Padme in the center like she’s a morally gray character?!?! I’ll tell you the answer: either they’re going to retcon her somehow and ruin any development she got in the prequels or it’s a good question... for another time.
StarWarsLeaks,fp5v9or,t1_fp58o45,1588340674.0,Can you please link it?
StarWarsTheories,fp5ux0n,t1_fp50itl,1588340455.0,Very true!
StarWarsTheories,fp4zoor,t1_fp4z975,1588311793.0,"I suppose it would contradict the stuff done in Clone Wars S7 (I’m a bit behind on my rewatch and haven’t gotten to the Siege of Mandalore) in regards to the lead up to ROTS (although I do think that the bit about Grievous kidnapping the Chancellor in it is plausible with the 2008 series), but I’m not sure about Sifo-Dyas. I haven’t read the book in a while (it’s on my list to reread the entire “Dark Lord” trilogy once my schedule frees up), but I don’t think it does if memory serves right.

I agree with you about the mixed legends/canon. I still can’t understand why Disney decided to make Prequel era (and before) lore Legends, and until High Republic comes out to replace the lore before Episode 1, that’s still canon as far as I’m concerned.

Edit: spelling"
StarWarsTheories,fp4ysyf,t1_fp4nz9c,1588311066.0,"I think that early post-ROTJ stories like Truce at Bakura are canon, same with a lot of the Clone Wars books and media that aren’t contradicted by the show (so a lot of the 2003 show, while a TON of fun, is often not canon to me because it contradicts the 2008 show, but something like Shatterpoint or Labyrinth of Evil is). Honestly, if I like a story and think it fits in with the overarching saga (of the movies, 2008 Clone Wars, Rebels, Mando, etc) then I consider it still canon."
StarWarsTheories,fp2s5ky,t3_gaoxz9,1588266988.0,"I like this explanation a lot. Especially since I consider some stories, almost all of the prequel ones like Darth Plagueis and the Old Republic (but also some
OT stories like Shadows of the Empire and Splinters of the Mind’s Eye), still canon... and there is always some truth in legends.

Edit: missed an apostrophe :)"
NetflixBestOf,fozlmy4,t3_gaecqe,1588192725.0,Seems like you like crime/police shows so I recommend Gotham- it’s not your conventional crime show but I’m currently on Season 3 and a lot of the early seasons plays out like a police procedural instead of the superhero origin that I expected.
DisneyPlus,fouon43,t3_g9hml3,1588087817.0,"I’m still waiting for Enchanted to pop up on D+, and I haven’t seen it on any other streaming services so I don’t understand why it isn’t there yet :("
pokespe,fos299r,t1_fos204x,1588022657.0,"Same here! I loved Spe because of the interactions between regions and dex holders (feels like an MCU if I’m going to be honest), and while I love BW and later arcs, I feel like as a whole Pokémon continuity became more isolated with the advent of Gen 5.

Might have him confused with one of the others but I would assume it was one of his children or maybe his wife.

Edit: after a quick search on the internet, it seems like Payne was an alias that Powell took on after deserting the Confederate Army and moving to Alexandria, but I’m not entirely sure how reliable that is."

PrequelMemes,fo0qs8o,t1_fo0cfuh,1587418041.0,There’s a book (Cloak of Deception) that goes into far more detail and shows exactly how Sheev was pulling the strings. It’s pretty cool honestly.
PrequelMemes,fo0qguj,t3_g4wcyg,1587417879.0,"I’d honestly prefer a show about Anakin and Obi-Wan between Episodes 1 and 2. Focus on Dooku’s fall, Sheev’s ascendancy, and perhaps even Grevious and the Separatists. There was little focus on it in the old canon (The Gathering Storm, Rogue Planet, and Jedi Quest are all that come to mind), and virtually nothing in the new canon. Filoni can continue the magic he did of showing Anakin and Obi-Wan as friends and fleshing out the prequel era."

Perhaps Rian and JJ cared, I’m not saying they didn’t, but to me, what sets the PT apart from the DT is that George knew his characters and kept them consistent across all six movies. It drives me insane how characters like Poe, for example, have a completed arc midway through the DT, and then regress back to who they were before their character arc. And George, because he had vision, knew exactly where to put every character to fit the narrative. I’m not saying that they were all in the right spot all the time, but it’s a heck of a lot better than how Finn and Rose were just totally shafted at some points during the DT."
