Hopefully your professor will give you some extra assignment or whatever. If you are lucky, you can probably get your lowest score midterm to be dropped like some of my professors are doing along with open book allowed during testing."

ucr,fororiv,t1_fornlcp,1588015857.0,"Big oof indeed. Yeah, hopefully he'll let it slide but I kinda doubt it  
Edit: It seem like it was suppose to auto-submit but since I was at the last question, it kinda glitched a bit. So I am suppose to know my score later"
