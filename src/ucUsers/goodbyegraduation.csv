UCSantaBarbara,fo7cs7t,t3_g5whfr,1587576130.0,"I'm definitely going to get a lot of downvotes for saying this but almost every transfer I've met at UCSB regrets transferring here and I feel the same way. It can be a really rough transition especially because a lot of the admin tries to scare you out of pursuing certain majors and whatnot. All around just less opportunities (harder to get into research, clubs, Greek life, majors, honors, etc). It can also be really difficult to meet people depending on your major. It seems like a very different experience if you came in as a freshman, are a part of Greek life, or live with really friendly people but I wish you the best of luck if you do decide to come! Sorry for the negativity lol"
UCSantaBarbara,fo5pg34,t1_fo5063o,1587531713.0,"I *completely* agree with you! I actually complained to the woman from the Eye Clinic that gave Heather my info and she replied saying this was supposedly her taking action to fix the problem. Like... How is having a personalized ""apology"" sent to me specifically helping *everyone* who is making this complaint? It's not. Obviously something more needs to be done then forcing Heather to send me an email lmao. I'll gladly email upper management with you if you'd like!"
UCSantaBarbara,fo3yk9i,t3_g4h334,1587495143.0,"Wait I made a formal complaint after seeing your last post and I was also emailed a personal apology from Heather Nichols which I personally felt was the wrong way to handle the situation. Like how is that going to fix anything? I feel like my privacy has been violated by them giving Heather my name and contact information and don't want to go back to the Eye Clinic now

Edit: I'm barely reading Heather Nichol's email to me and it wasn't even an apology. It was her saying what she does in her appointments, saying sorry that I felt bad (not for the way she acted), then saying that if she acted any certain way, it's because students are rude to her. I was literally her first appointment that day."
UCSantaBarbara,fnganij,t1_fnfz844,1586926617.0,"You're still not getting it dude... Try listening to other people to actually comprehend what they are trying to say rather than listening simply to reply and defend your own point. Obviously I have a point if this many people agree with me and you're the only one that has said otherwise. 

Edit: I had a feeling that you would respond this way, hence why it took me awhile to say anything. Regret wasting my time and trying. I give up lol good luck"
UCSantaBarbara,fnftf21,t1_fn5ln6i,1586915085.0,"First of all, all of the posts about cheating have been about the same departments. The same departments that people have been complaining about being more difficult now that everything is online.  
Second, ""can you read?"" (I'm quoting you by the way). You're missing the entire point. I'm not saying it's okay to cheat and I'm not ""justifying it."" Literally said that in the post.   
Third, this ""mental gymnastics"" you're referring to is simple logic and empathy. You've commented on a few of my other posts saying how this online stuff is super easy, people are making a bigger deal out of it than it is, people need to stop complaining, etc. As happy as I am for you that you're not having a hard time with this, many other people are struggling and for several different reasons. Some people were forced to move out of their homes, some people were forced to move back into abusive households, some people are parents, some don't have wifi, some don't have a place to study, some people don't have laptops, some people can't afford to buy textbooks and relied on checking them out of the library, some just lost their jobs, some people need more instruction and tutoring than what is being offered, etc. Being inside and social distancing could be aggravating some people's mental illness or causing them serious emotional distress, all this extra work could be aggravating certain disabilities that people have (it's worsening my tendonitis, arthritis, and migraines for example), this could be affecting people's families directly, etc.  
Stop being such an angry, judgmental person and try to put yourself in other people's shoes once in awhile. Your privilege and arrogance is showing."
UCSantaBarbara,fncwtsd,t1_fncepy8,1586849966.0,Congrats to *you!* He was a transfer so not sure how much advice he can give you but let me know if you have any questions and I can try asking him! :D
UCSantaBarbara,fnccf7p,t3_g0ptgf,1586833412.0,My boyfriend was able to get an internship at Texas Instruments and Toyon Research Company while he was going to UCSB
UCSantaBarbara,fnbshrj,t1_fn8vpge,1586821439.0,Thank you!!! I appreciate it :)
UCSantaBarbara,fnbsfuw,t1_fn87yvd,1586821409.0,That does make me feel better! Thank you :)
UCSantaBarbara,fn86i5o,t1_fn5uwpk,1586734946.0,"I think it depends because when I asked my advisors to take certain lower divs at SBCC, they wouldn't let me even though it directly transferred. But I think you're right, it's definitely worth asking because if they let you, it's SUCH a better experience! The SBCC profs are amazing and I loved all of them (except one evil German lady lol)"
UCSantaBarbara,fn7892h,t1_fn4d9nl,1586715216.0,I don't like it here lol
UCSantaBarbara,fn786wr,t1_fn5vx02,1586715183.0,"Dude I'm like, embarrassed about some of the answers that I put! I don't even know why I put them, I knew they weren't right. Stupid brain can't handle the pressure lmao I will not be surprised when the grades come out and I got like a 2 HAHA"
UCSantaBarbara,fn5po59,t3_fzejge,1586671720.0,"I felt so rushed and pressured that I just blanked out. Plus when I asked him, he never said we'd be calculating anything so I didn't even have a calculator near me. I wasted so much time going to get mine."
UCSantaBarbara,fn5p7gq,t1_fn5mlwf,1586671303.0,Great advice for graduating high school students but too late for us since we're already at UCSB :/
UCSantaBarbara,fn5kejg,t1_fn596yg,1586667270.0,"I was waiting for someone to say this and tbh am surprised no one has before you. If this were the reason, you'd see cheating across a large variety of departments but nope, we're seeing it in the same few. It being online just makes it easier to do so."
UCSantaBarbara,fn54f0o,t1_fn526kz,1586655666.0,"I'm kind of nervous about the lab reports too actually... It just feels like with everything being online, I'm not really learning or understanding very much. Are the TAs supposed to be explaining the labs to us?   
Edit: Because all mine did was read the procedures to us in less than 10 minutes lol"
UCSantaBarbara,fn4yu7l,t1_fn4y0ml,1586651982.0,I swear the *only* possible way to be prepared for the ochem lecture exams is going to CLAS but that's gone to shit now that it's online lol my tutors literally can't keep up with how fast my classes are going
UCSantaBarbara,fn4y5mt,t1_fn4umtz,1586651551.0,"Yeah honestly! I wish there was *some* sort of guidance. From seeing posts about Gainer's other labs, seems like it's just the way he makes his quizzes which tbh makes no sense to me but what can ya do"
UCSantaBarbara,fn4y1ra,t1_fn4tgnj,1586651484.0,"*OR* let's hope we all did terribly so that after the curve, we all do super well c: I feel like unfortunately that's more realistic at this point lol keepin ma fingers crossed"
UCSantaBarbara,fn4tcnu,t1_fn4s7ll,1586648534.0,"Okay thank God, that gives me some hope because if all the quizzes are going to be like this one, I'm definitely failing all of them lol"
UCSantaBarbara,fn4oeh8,t1_fn4lpit,1586645538.0,Thank you! I am definitely going to need it considering the fact that I failed the quiz today! Sad life. Good luck to you too! :D
UCSantaBarbara,fn4lk1a,t1_fn4l1d7,1586643873.0,They're having us watch a video of someone else performing the lab then we write a lab report based on what we see happening in the video
UCSantaBarbara,fn4derj,t1_fn41r2y,1586639086.0,Thank you <3 I will try!
UCSantaBarbara,fn4d7ji,t1_fn4b980,1586638969.0,"Oh God, I didn't even think about that! You're probably right. Woo, looking forward to CHEM 6BL... That is, if I even pass 6AL"
UCSantaBarbara,fn49f30,t1_fn41ufv,1586636753.0,"Aw I'm sorry to hear that you were laid off, this pandemic is honestly ruining everything, but I appreciate your empathy! You're definitely lucky that you're not still going here. It seems like UCSB (along with some other universities of course) specifically is handling this poorly. I have friends going to other schools and they're not experiencing anything like what we are :/"
UCSantaBarbara,fn418xx,t1_fn404a4,1586632002.0,I'm so sorry to hear that. Both of your guys' situations are complete BS. Unfortunately I'm in the same boat as you... I feel guilty with every single break that I take and it shouldn't be that way at all. I don't understand how these professors can sleep at night knowing they are screwing with their students' mental health and futures. They're also making it harder for themselves. Not understanding their logic at all.
UCSantaBarbara,fn409xn,t1_fn3y2lk,1586631442.0,Why thank you! :D
UCSantaBarbara,fn406gm,t1_fn3ytv1,1586631387.0,"I completely agree with you! Most quarters, I would be mad to hear about cheating but this quarter, I just think it's sad. It's unfair how apathetic some professors are being. They are willingly screwing with their students' futures and I'm *sure* they would feel the same way as we do if they were students again."
UCSantaBarbara,fn1pswf,t3_fyphc6,1586567308.0,"That really sucks but can't you just say this to them instead of posting about it? Posts like this are gonna make professors want to switch back to ProctorU and I would personally be so upset if that were to happen, I can't handle the pressure :("
UCSantaBarbara,fmx15ei,t1_fmttcbg,1586456612.0,"Aw I'm sorry to hear that! I can understand why being on the outside looking in, we may look like a bunch of brats but I think it's more so that everyone is frustrated with how the school is handing the pandemic and this is just one example of that. I do feel for our professors, a lot is being asked of them and this definitely can't be easy for them either, but it affects us more than it affects them. They're already successful people, whereas our performance right now is what will define our future success (well, partially). In the end, a lot of us are getting the short end of the stick which is really unfair."
UCSantaBarbara,fmx0mlm,t1_fmu2349,1586456346.0,It is! I already knew it was going to be ASS taking it online but it's definitely going worse than expected... SO FAR. Hopefully it gets better and quickly! And I believe Bruice recently stopped teaching but we're still using her textbook
UCSantaBarbara,fmx073n,t1_fmuxytp,1586456128.0,Yeah basically everyone that had him before says he's the best! Leads me to believe that I would like him if classes weren't online. And thanks for the tip! He uploaded some old exams so I'll make sure to study those :)
UCSantaBarbara,fmu8rmv,t1_fmtptt0,1586386676.0,Thank you for taking the time to do this! If only there was some nice way I could ask him to use his return key and throw in some periods here and there so I won't have to keep posting on here for help haha don't be surprised if I shoot you a PM in the future!!! :)
UCSantaBarbara,fmu8f5b,t1_fmtkxo4,1586386496.0,I really wish it was hahaha sad life
UCSantaBarbara,fmtai0d,t1_fmt77wc,1586369486.0,THIS
UCSantaBarbara,fmta72i,t1_fmt5k8s,1586369344.0,Thanks! Definitely seems like I'm gonna need it since this is how he types everything
UCSantaBarbara,fmt3d5z,t1_fmst9r3,1586366214.0,I wish so bad that I could request one lol
UCSantaBarbara,fmt3aa9,t1_fmt28t0,1586366177.0,It is Aue ;(
UCSantaBarbara,fmt39il,t1_fmszqo9,1586366167.0,Yeah ;(
UCSantaBarbara,fmsvwgh,t1_fmsvd2i,1586362822.0,Don't worry about it! I appreciate you so much for even trying and you did help quite a bit!! Thank you! :)
UCSantaBarbara,fmssy0r,t1_fmsslzv,1586361506.0,"I get like the general gist of everything he's trying to say but none of the specifics, like at the end I don't understand which mechanisms he is saying to pay attention to and which to skip because of the way that it's phrased. Halp me pls ;c"
UCSantaBarbara,fmsqjiv,t1_fmsqbne,1586360388.0,"English but I don't understand what he's trying to say, especially toward the end"
UCSantaBarbara,fmp9ax8,t1_fmmgl37,1586276793.0,"My bad, interpreted it the wrong way because I'm butthurt about this whole situation. Happy for you dude! I'd say good luck this quarter but it sounds like you don't need it :D~"
UCSantaBarbara,fmonudp,t1_fmn3eed,1586264438.0,Ugh man I envy you can we trade lives for the quarter
UCSantaBarbara,fmmwcp8,t1_fmmhmsu,1586213339.0,YES. Exactly. Like I'm not complaining just to complain... It's not that I don't want to do the work or I'm being disorganized or inefficient. It's that this quarter is WAY more work than it would normally be. Way more than they would've been able to make us do or learn if we were going to an actual class. I'm not understanding their logic in the slightest... And they're not being very empathetic considering the fact that going through a pandemic and a stay-at-home order is emotionally challenging.
UCSantaBarbara,fmmvmko,t1_fmmm2lw,1586212948.0,I'm taking 2 chem classes right now and they're the main reason why I feel this stressed!
UCSantaBarbara,fmmvigw,t1_fmmdi3b,1586212886.0,"I'm sorry that you feel the same way :(   
I agree with you on that second part, it seems like it's the same departments being complained about over and over again... Sigh"
UCSantaBarbara,fmme4yb,t1_fmm6z09,1586203634.0,"Chill dude count your lucky stars and try to be a bit more empathetic because most people wish their quarter wasn't ""like this"""
UCSantaBarbara,fmmb4e1,t1_fmil4dq,1586202102.0,LMAO I fucking WISH
UCSantaBarbara,fmm5lu3,t1_fmm4qeq,1586199215.0,Let's do both! Could you start the google doc and link it?
UCSantaBarbara,fmm514j,t3_fvpj89,1586198916.0,"Supposedly CA is enforcing a $1000 fine and/or misdemeanor for people who violate the stay-at-home order and UCSB recently sent out an email saying that they may punish students in a way that could affect their student status so I'd anonymously complain to the cops and email UCSB faculty/admin if I were you. I just hope someone actually tells your housemates to take this shit seriously. They sound awful and I'm sorry that you have to deal with this.

&#x200B;

Edit: Maybe even email/call the county's public health department."
UCSantaBarbara,fmm3rul,t1_fmm2on5,1586198245.0,Oh yeah that's because it's only open to chem majors right now. I tried asking the summer session people when it'll be open to non-majors and they said they have no idea lol
UCSantaBarbara,fmm2l1l,t3_fw3br8,1586197615.0,Is this a possibility?!?!
UCSantaBarbara,fmm2bzq,t1_fmm0nzq,1586197483.0,"Ugh bro I am happy for you, wish more students (including me) could say the same! Mail your professors some flowers for doing their jobs well!!! :P"
UCSantaBarbara,fmm27a1,t1_fmm05ju,1586197413.0,Biopsychology
UCSantaBarbara,fmlvlud,t1_fmluzcq,1586194038.0,Can we actually please start one? All of the admin departments that I emailed didn't give two shits about what I had to say even though I told them that most students are in the same boat. Maybe they'll actually listen if they can actually *see* how many students feel this way?
UCSantaBarbara,fmijt2w,t1_fmgzbxv,1586110993.0,"I think it depends on which classes you're taking because I'm also a senior and this is hands down my hardest quarter. So hard that I'm scared I won't graduate anymore. I'm definitely managing my time well and I still feel extremely behind because of all the homework assignments, projects, and quizzes. The fact that the majority of my professors aren't doing any Zoom lectures, uploaded video lectures, or even uploading slides makes it infinitely worse."
