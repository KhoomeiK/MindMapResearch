UCSD,fpgx79q,t1_fpg6kt3,1588611120.0,"I think it might be different if you're in one of the fields that UCSD seems to cater towards (be that comp sci, cog sci, bio, etc), but in the humanities/social sciences there seems to be a lack of investment in education itself. It feels like most people here are interested in solely going to classes to advance their future career prospects, they pay no heed to learning about interesting things for their own sake.

I also went to a very rigorous high school surrounded by people who are all now at Ivies/etc and I felt there was a drop in the caliber of students when I started at UCSD. None of my courses are actually that challenging even though they absolutely have the potential to be so. MMW really irks me in this category because, on top of being kind of a joke, it's just plain wrong about a lot of things. Last quarter the professor was discussing Hegel/Marx and some of the stuff he said was just plain incorrect—I went up to him to talk about it and he said ""you expect too much out of MMW"". That's the attitude that really embodies the lack of intellectuality at UCSD: we could go into something more in-depth but no one cares enough to do it so instead we're going to give a superficial explanation and move on with our lives so we can graduate."
UCSD,fpevn2g,t3_gcghg8,1588555926.0,"I was a freshman admit and now I'm a second year who applied to transfer and just got into Cal and Haverford while waiting some others. Coming from the other side of this—insofar as I'm much more interested in the humanities/social sciences—one of the key motivating factors driving me to at least apply to transfer was the sheer lack of intellectuality at this school.

UCSD, and I think this is a general current that runs though the majority of predominantly STEM institutions, seems to be more so a vocational school focused on preparing future workers than a university dedicated to cultivating the 'life of the mind' (as pretentious as that sounds). I asked one of my roommates this year when the last time he read a book for fun was and the answer was ""never"" and I'd wager his experience isn't even abnormal compared to the student body as a whole. Thankfully I was able to find some people with similar interests my freshman year, but two of them transferred out and one is graduating this year leaving me with essentially one guy who's in a similar boat. I don't want to shit on UCSD for this because I don't put any sort of normative value in the more intellectual side of things, but it's slightly estranging when you hear someone genuinely ask ""who the fuck is John Locke""' in an MMW classroom. 

Unlike you I'm not sure if I'm actually going to leave, I moreso just wanted the option to do so. My professors have been phenomenal so far and they're really a saving grace—but at the same time you only get one college experience and I'd rather have it be with people interested in similar things as myself.

The one thing I do disagree with from your post is recommending TheKathPath. I have a couple friends at Stanford and they all hate her, plus I thought her common app essay was actually kind of bad. If anyone is considering transferring I'd be happy to look over their essays instead.

I doubt this comment will be useful to most people, but something along the lines of it would have been a great boon to me in my freshman/early sophomore year—hopefully it reaches someone in a similar position."
UCSD,fpdd31z,t3_gcn063,1588524615.0,"I 100% am in support with the lawsuit, its BS we have to pay fees for things we don't have access to while literally useless administrators who contribute absolutely nothing to this school (and society more generally) rake in six figure salaries as they continue to privatize education.

On the other hand, the last time a lawsuit about student fees went through, bad things happened. A group of students sued the UC system back in like 2003 for unlawfully levying student fees and they actually one. Unfortunately, in order to pay off the lawsuit, the Regents levied another fee on the student body and even AFTER the lawsuit was paid off we still are paying that fee."

GPA: 4.0 at time of application, but went to a 3.97 when I updated them
Major: Sociology"
UCSD,fnk9d5u,t3_g2672z,1587019030.0,"I was going to go through and screenshot the entire thing because there's no way I'm paying 100 bucks. If you're down, we could split up the screenshotting so we each don't have to do it for the full book (which hypothetically wouldn't be that difficult it's just fucking RedShelf takes a goddamn year before it loads a page)."
UCSD,flrj8q2,t3_fqcp7o,1585421335.0,"I'm not majoring in Political Theory, or PoliSci for that matter, but I have two friends doing it and I myself am heavily interested in social/political/literary theory. From what I've heard it's not that the classes are poorly taught or bad in anyway, just that they aren't the most interesting.

Because UCSD is in the anglo-sphere the philosophy here tends to be heavily analytic and this bleeds over into the political theory here as well. For me, the most interesting portions of theory are those that emanate from continental philosophy (think Adorno, Nietzsche, Zizek, Agamben, etc) and deal with much more critical frameworks like Marxism. Unfortunately, these thinkers and their contributions aren't really taught here and most of the political theory is liberalism or democratic theory. The core sequence for political theory majors is POLI 110A-C which is a history of political thought and that isn't bad: you cover antiquity (Plato, Herodotus, Augustine), the usual Enlightenment figures (Locke, Hume, Hobbes, Rousseau), and then dip *very* briefly into stuff like Nietzsche and Marx.

It's not bad by any means, it just heavily focuses on liberalism and I find that boring and uncritical. You can find all of the syllabi online for polisci courses and feel free to hit me up with anymore questions."
