berkeley,fp50ji4,t1_fp50cvy,1588312507.0,I’m actually notifying all my professors now because I have a quiz tomorrow that requires that i take and submit the quiz to gradescope during a 30 minute time interval. There is just no way that’s going to end well if the WiFi is as bad as it is today.
berkeley,fp4zrf4,t1_fp4zl8t,1588311856.0,Haha well finals week will be lots of fun if they don’t get it fixed by then ughh.
berkeley,fp4xdra,t1_fp4t23j,1588309922.0,It is still really bad for both my phone and computer. Unit 2 has a study room still open right? Maybe I’ll go over there to get some work done haha.
berkeley,fojukex,t3_g7ud42,1587829693.0,"Why must we “owe” something to someone in order for us to show them a little bit of kindness? Regardless of whether you have benefitted from an immigrant working in the US or not (which you most likely have), maybe having a little bit of compassion and respect for someone who is working hard to support themselves and/or their family isn’t the worst thing in the world. We may just want to keep in mind that any of us could have been born in another country with leadership that denies us of basic human rights. That shouldn’t make us feel entitled. Instead, it puts us in a position to help those who weren’t so lucky."
berkeley,fo3h88x,t3_g5503i,1587486860.0,"Yep you can take Summer classes :). You just have to sign up! In fact, students who weren’t even admitted to Berkeley can take Summer courses here. I’m not sure if you can participate in the edge summer program (if they even have it this year) which is for incoming students. Basically incoming students sign up for summer classes and are automatically enrolled in the edge program which basically just provides an occasional social event to bring incoming students together....you wouldn’t be missing out on much, but I actually think you still qualify as an incoming student. The only question you need to be concerned about is whether you will be considered as an incoming student for summer session or a visiting student because I think the fees are a little bit higher for students who aren’t Berkeley students or incoming Berkeley students. I’m pretty sure you count as an incoming student though, but you may want to check up on that.

As for talking to an advisor, yep you can speak to one. Generally, Calcentral says that an advisor hasn’t been assigned to you until you declare your major and sometimes even after that Calcentral says that you don’t have an advisor assigned because it’s kind of glitchy. In fact even if you had an advisor assigned to you, you can’t signup for an appointment through Calcentral because there is something wrong with the sign up feature. You can sign up for an appointment by visiting your departments website or your college’s website and look for the advising section of the site. Most departments let incoming students sign up for advising as well. If your department doesn’t then schedule an appointment with one of your college’s advisors, so if you are in L&S go to the L&S advising website and they will let incoming students talk to an advisor. If you are in a different college, you should be able to make an appointment as well just go to your college’s website and for advising.

As for housing, I’m not sure. I think a lot of Spring admits do get housing, but you may want to contact the housing office to get more details. You can also look into Berkeley co-ops which  is on the cheaper side and although they aren’t run by the school, only students (primarily Berkeley students) live there. The prices are pretty cheap as well."
berkeley,fo0wgvf,t1_fo0uc70,1587421065.0,"The 6 units isn’t a major requirement though it is a L&S requirement. So thinking about it as though you are completing major one’s 6 units by completing some of your majors 2s upper divs and vice versa isn’t correct. If the 6 units upper div outside major were considered to be a major requirement then by using 2 of major 1’s courses  to fulfill the 6 unit upper div requirement for major 2 and then 2 courses required for major 2 to fulfill major 1’s 6 units then you would have 4 overlapping courses which wouldn’t work. It is not the case that this is a major requirement. It is a L&S wide policy like 7 course breadth is. You only have to complete it once regardless of how many majors you have. Although students who receive simultaneous degrees have to complete college requirements from both colleges. The question is will they let 6 units of one of your major’s upper divs count toward this requirement since you have two or more majors. Since it seems like my advisor was wrong, I guess they let you do this, but OP should verify with (a few) advisors to make sure."
berkeley,fo0hxft,t1_fnzsckq,1587413453.0,"I was told by an L&S advisor, that the 6 units of upper div had to be outside of both my majors. Granted, this wouldn't be the first time I was misinformed by an advisor."
berkeley,fo0h84s,t1_fnzvboj,1587413089.0,I was told by an advisor that it had to be outside of both major departments. Did you hear otherwise?
berkeley,fnzlusq,t3_g4puqj,1587396539.0,"They will probably make an exception and allow more deferrals next semester. That being said, even if your deferral isn’t accepted, there is a way around it. You can technically sign up for classes and withdraw on the first day of classes and you will still be able to start back up in the Spring even if this Fall is your incoming semester. The nice thing about a withdrawal is that under Fall 2020 on your transcript, they will only show that you withdrew and the date in which you did so. So grad school and internships will know that you withdrew from the semester on the first day of classes, so they won’t think that you withdrew because you were failing a bunch of classes and you withdrew to avoid having poor grades on your transcript. You need to make sure that you withdraw on the 1st day of classes, otherwise you will still be responsible for a portion of your tuition. The longer you wait, the more tuition you will have to pay. If you withdraw the first day you will only be responsible for campus fees which is around $50-100. Also, you can’t withdraw before the start of the semester because you are an incoming student. This is known as a cancellation and it is technically the ideal option since you won’t have to pay any fees and they don’t state that you withdrew at all on your transcript (they just skip that semester on your transcript). That being said, an incoming student can only have their 1st semester cancelled (withdraw before the start of the semester) and return to Berkeley in the Spring is if their deferral petition is approved. Lastly, if you decide to withdraw you need to make sure you submit  the readmission form + $70 fee before your college’s deadline (generally around 8 weeks into the semester).The first 2-3 times you withdraw they automatically accept your readmission in the Spring as long as you submit the form by the deadline. If you submit it after the deadline, you will have to wait till Summer/Fall 2021 to return. If you withdraw 3+ times from the university you may be considered for dismissal, so just keep that in mind going forward. The first few withdrawals aren’t a big deal at all, but eventually they will stop accepting your request to be readmitted after a withdrawal."

berkeley,fnutph2,t1_fntf18w,1587270825.0,"No they won’t. I’ve seen transfer students  fail their GE’s during their semester before transferring and Berkeley let it slide. You would be surprised at how much leniency they give incoming students in regards to this stuff. As long as you notify them and it’s not in a major requirement course, then they will let it slide. The only requirements they may be more strict on are the ones I listed in my previous comment because those are a UC wide condition, so Berkeley may be unable to bend the rules. I think the only GE that they would rescind your offer if you didn’t take it (and said you did) or failed it or whatever are the two English classes. Also, the language requirement isn’t in it of itself an L&S requirement. I don’t think OP will have to take any classes here to make up for the fact that the language requirement wasn’t completed."
berkeley,fnt1li2,t3_g3rolp,1587232867.0,"You won’t get rescinded. You just need to notify them ASAP. This happens all the time and they pretty much never hold it against you. In fact, IGETC isn’t one of the requirements to transfer to Berkeley. The minimum to transfer to any UC is 2 English courses, 1 math course (precalc and up), and 4 courses from 2 of the 3 following subject areas arts/humanities, social/behavioral science, physical/biological science, and lastly your major requirements which varies by school. You still meet the minimum transfer requirement and it’s not like meeting the language requirement was the deciding factor in your acceptance. They really only care about your math courses and you meet the minimum UC transfer requirements, so just let them know and don’t stress! Welcome to Berkeley!"
berkeley,fnnw4up,t1_fnnpbc3,1587103581.0,"Yeah that’s the readmission form I was referring to as well. I’m in L&S too and I talked to an advisor about this 2 semester or so ago (I didn’t end up actually canceling my semester though). They said that cancellation meant that I wouldn’t need to go through the readmission process like you would for a withdrawal which meant to me that I wouldn’t have needed to fill out the form and pay the fee, but this wouldn’t be the first time that an advisor has given me incorrect info. Since you’ve been through the process OP should definitely follow up and determine whether The form needs to be submitted even for a cancellation."
berkeley,fnnoaqq,t1_fnno0hw,1587097199.0,I was told that I wouldn’t have to by an advisor (maybe it depends on the college) or maybe they just meant that the readmission petition would be automatically re-approved for a cancellation regardless of past withdrawals?
berkeley,fnnnli4,t1_fnnjb4r,1587096691.0,"Actually OP won't even need to go through the readmission after withdrawal process. That is for when you drop all of your classes from a semester (a withdrawal), but you are submitting the withdrawal request on or after the 1st day of instruction. If you submit that withdrawal request before the first day of instruction, it is considered to be a cancellation and you won't need to be reconsidered for readmission. A regular withdrawal (submitting form after the start of classes) usually doesn't cause any problems either although you will be responsible for 10% of fees if you wait till the 2nd day of classes to withdraw (and even more if you wait longer).  The only issue is if you've had more than 3 withdrawals, your college may stop automatically approving readmission requests and you may be be considered for dismissal. So its best that you submit the withdrawal request before the start of  classes, so that it will be considered as a cancellation, you won't have to pay any of the fees, and so that your transcripts won't denote that you withdrew and the date you did so. For cancellation, I believe that they remove the semester entirely from the transcript whereas for a withdrawal there will be a note that you withdrew and the date of the withdrawal.

https://registrar.berkeley.edu/registration/cancellation-withdrawal

Edit: You may need to still submit the readmission application (simple form + fee) even for a cancellation. I was told by an advisor that you wouldn’t have to unless you withdrew (dropping all classes after the start of classes), but others who have gone through the process say that the form is still required. Either way, the cancellation option is still the way to go, but you should follow up with an advisor to ensure that you take all the proper steps so you will be able to enroll in the Spring."
berkeley,fnnm2fr,t1_fnnim6e,1587095599.0,"FYI, the only way a student can drop all of their classes, is through a withdrawal request. Also, all of the colleges will accept the readmission request as long as it is submitted before the deadline and the student hasn't withdrawn 3 times already (that's when dismissal might occur). This semester is different though, anyone who withdraws will have their readmission form approved as long as it is turned in on time (otherwise they may have to wait till Spring, but there won't be any dismissals due to too many withdrawals)"
berkeley,fnnlrnn,t3_g2tqyj,1587095389.0,"If you are planning to drop all of your classes, you would actually be withdrawing from the semester. Berkeley is automatically approving withdrawal requests for this semester, so it won't really be an issue if you decide to withdraw from a semester in the future. You just need to make sure you fill out the readmission form before the due date (Around June 1st - varies by college) in order to enroll in Fall classes otherwise they will make you wait till Spring. Note: they usually only let you withdraw 3 times. In most cases after the 3rd time, if you withdraw again they won't approve the readmission form and you will be considered for dismissal. That being said, there is a process of being allowed to return after dismissal, but it requires you taking classes other colleges or Berkeley extension to show that you can successfully complete course. A withdrawal really isn't that big of deal (besides losing money and having to retake classes) the first or second time. No one really cares (including grad schools and internships). Your readmission form will also automatically be approved. In fact, this semester they are approving all readmission forms even if you've had 3 or more withdrawals due to COVID. Also, your transcript will take all of your courses from this semester off and under Spring 2020 it will show the date you withdrew. You can submit the withdraw request through Calcentral and just remember to fill out the readmission form before the due date and you are good to go!

berkeley,fmx6wc5,t1_fmx6i9h,1586459553.0,"Sounds like a plan. Also, the vector calculus book may indirectly help you in 110. 110 focuses on working in an abstract vector space, so working in a vector space with the calculus based concepts that you are more familiar with may help you put an example to the abstract concepts discussed in 110. It helps you see the usefulness of the material as you are being introduced to it."
berkeley,fmx5hre,t3_fxy4iw,1586458816.0,"105 will be a lot like 5A and geometry can play a role. It could really help if you get a better understanding of vector calculus which is really rushed through at the end of math 53. I recommend reading through Vector Calculus by Marsden. You will get a much better idea of what is happening in all of your physics classes, but in particular it really helps in mechanics and electromagnetism. It is a great way to get a more visual understanding of what’s going on. It also relies less on remembering geometric tricks and more on your visual understanding. Geometry is intertwined in the concepts, but you don’t really realize you’re doing it when you take a more vector calculus approach. Since we don’t have a strong vector calculus course at Berkeley, these courses rely more on geometric approaches to avoid a more calculus based approach. I would say stick with the physics path and maybe try a few upper div math classes. I find having a visual intuition is really important for the math major too. The upper div math courses are very different from the lower div."
