beta,fogattz,t3_g69k0e,1587750206.0,Think I solved it - had my iPhone set up to block cookies and changing that allowed me to log in as usual.

grateful_dead,fnr410x,t1_fnljvio,1587178766.0,The Greatest Story Ever Told from Pershing Municipal Auditorium 2/26/73 is my favorite - I agree the version from Ace is good though
AskReddit,fnozb8g,t1_fnox24m,1587136436.0,"Related video - This has likely been posted somewhere in the thread already, but “How to Cook That” (Ann Reardon & her husband) did an interesting expose on 5 minute crafts and their affiliation with Russia that I recommend: https://youtu.be/pvqa8dsBtno"

Boise,fmsocjq,t3_fwtgo2,1586359306.0,One that I know is having trouble is JD's Bodega downtown.  The owner is a family friend of ours; he's really poured everything he has into that business and this virus is really screwing him.  Please support if you can!
Frugal_Jerk,fmpvki5,t3_fwm193,1586288133.0,It also seems to come with a side of blue paint. I was able to lick some blue paint off a road once many years ago and it provides quite a nice buzz! Not as tasty as engine coolant though.

Seattle,fmes1p8,t1_fmefln1,1586012226.0,"The article misses the line of cases to do with First Amendment exceptions for speech likely to incite imminent lawless action/violence. It would really be a stretch for a court to use that line of cases because many of them are old and generally disfavored (e.g. Adams vs US), but I think that’s honestly a better theory of liability here. You’d also have to get a court to view saying the virus is a hoax as closely analogous to threatening violence, which is unlikely to succeed."
