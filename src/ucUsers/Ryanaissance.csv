learnswahili,fp6m57y,t3_gb79cn,1588354708.0,"I don't think learning a language could ever be ""cultural appropriation.""  Learning a language shows an interest in the people who speak it, and most would consider it flattery to spend your limited time learning their language, of all ways you could spend your time.    As another user pointed out, East Africa is where our species evolved from, so in some sense everyone on the planet has a connection to the area, even if distant.  

In college I had studied French and Arabic already, and signed up for Swahili on a whim.  I have no cultural connection to the region (American of mixed European heritage). It turned out to be far more enjoyable than I imagined.  The language is just so fun to speak and its a widely spoken language that's growing.   Its been many years since I first studied it, and now that I've started again I regret ever stopping.

But then I go out in the world find I rather like not having to compete for mobs or nodes.  Unless I'm in Nazjatar...cross realm hell.

Anxiety,fp39j91,t1_fp0njae,1588275447.0,"I had a coworker ranting on me about 5G starting to cause all sorts of vague health problems, and that we'd soon have an outbreak.  That was back in the fall.

Anxiety,fp38sau,t3_gaarcc,1588275071.0,"I once thought maybe it was possible for there to be a brief moment in the day when my all my blood didn't physically burn, and all my nerves and skin where electrically fried out, where my stomach wouldn't hurt, and there wouldn't be 24/7 lightning bolts through my chest.  But this is normal, even while sleeping.  So I guess the strange thing is if there are people who don't feel this.

At least my breathing sometimes isn't labored and my heart rate can go to a normal level...sometimes.  I exercise 3 hours a week, eat lots of fish, salads, and fruit smoothies, so I don't think its my health habits causing it.

I heard people who were autistic as children are prone to this kind of anxiety, but I haven't done much research into it."
languagelearning,fp18687,t3_gamqb2,1588227179.0,"I think Luca Lampariello (Italian native) has made a post or two about accents.  He has a pretty good American accent, that he worked hard for, but its not perfect.  And it also doesn't matter.  As long as you can communicate effectively, most people won't care.  

If you're looking for a flawless accent, then I'm not sure its possible unless you were here as a baby.  I know people who have been here since they were in kindergarten or preschool and they still have a slight accent.  Even with very good, practiced accents, something almost inevitably will seem off to a native.  But I have met that rare individual who it took numerous conversations with to start to suspect they had a different mother tongue.  Maybe its talent, maybe hard work, probably both.  

I know it can be done, but its very rare.  I also don't think its necessary.  

Here's one of his articles.  I'm pretty sure he has more.  And videos on Youtube.  Might be worth it to you.

Personally I'd rather have the XP buff longer.  Or maybe they can remove the questing requirements for allied races.  I have all the rep, just can't get myself to care one bit about doing the questlines for kul tirans or zandalari.

But I guess the little bit of extra gold is nice for the world quests I'm probably going to do anyways.

Hopefully this won't greatly impact the high prices of old world mats that I've seen since the xp buff."

I like the simple idea of ""one letter, one sound"".  Preferably letters without accents.  It'd be nice to have separate letters for the two kinds of ""l"" in little, or one for the kind of ""l"" in volume, for example.  I'd like to see this applied to our vowels and vowel combinations as well, as we definitely have unrepresented vowels sounds here and there, such as the vowel sounds in saying ""eww"" or ""bird""."
