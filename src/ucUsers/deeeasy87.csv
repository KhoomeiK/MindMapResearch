He was my brother's best friend (cliche, I know). We'd danced around each other for 5 years, being together whenever I was in town. If one of us was in a relationship, then it was just as companions, but I knew I always loved him. And I think he understood me better than anyone else I've ever known, cause he had been by either mine or my brother's side through it all. But our lives just didn't line up. He had responsibilities and I had dreams and he was right. They couldn't all fit together. Someone would always be giving up something, and we were young. We didn't want that. Couldn't ask that. I knew letting him go was inevitable, but he made the first move. At the end of it, he told me ""In another life..."" and it just hung in the air. I didn't need him to finish the sentence, cause I knew how it ended. And it was the what ifs and what could have beens that broke my heart. Sorry for the novel."

After years of cigarettes to vaping, back to cigarettes, I just quit smoking about two weeks ago after shelter in place went into effect. I hope we both keep it up!"
