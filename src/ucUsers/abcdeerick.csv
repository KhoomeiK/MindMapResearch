UCSD,fpi5xpq,t3_gdkmcy,1588634313.0,Iâ€™m in upper division classes and the quizzes and exams are open notes. So literally I have 0 motivation to study. Why would I study if I could look up on my notes on what are the answers anyways. I miss stressing out about exams tbh lol

UCSD,fo0bhvv,t3_g4ltaf,1587409699.0,"I also moved out on my on campus housing and moved in with a friend. I do pay rent. Financial aid office asked me for the name of my roommates and the address. They would also want you to provide lease agreement. As a proof that you are paying rent. Your name has to be on the agreement or else it wouldnâ€™t count. Which I call bullshit. Itâ€™s like they expect you to pay money out of pocket and not expect to get your housing money back from the cancelled agreement. So yeah basically Iâ€™m not getting any money from my cancelled agreement. I was better off staying at UCSD, because If I knew cancelling my contract would cost me more money, I would have just stayed and be depressed on my own."

UCSD,fnm2n7e,t3_g2jiuh,1587064024.0,my roommate took Psyc 153 he barely shows up to class and got an A. I was supposed to take Psyc 168 but the online format was super easy but people told me itâ€™s an easy A class if I took it in person. People suggested that I should take harder classes since itâ€™s online(they make it easier).
