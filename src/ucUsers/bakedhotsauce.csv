I don't think I need to play on the TV itself, the dock is the useless thing to me, but I may find that it comes in handy one day. 

Ugh. Choices."

worldnews,fn44rnn,t1_fn44hha,1586634042.0,"Yep, but in all honesty, do the research on it. 5G will be as big of a failure as 3D was on TVs. It will be a quick fad and fade away. It's just not practical. 

It would require an exponentially more amount of towers (although these are smaller than conventional 4G towers) to even get ""basic"" coverage in a city, and then still you'd have to be in absolute direct LOS to these towers. 

Only feasible way id see is if you built them as common as say traffic lights in a major city. On ever corner of every block."
worldnews,fn43uyh,t1_fn38mqu,1586633517.0,"Copying my comment from elsewhere:

Not an anti-5g dumbass but he is right about one thing, 5G isn't very fast unless you build towers like 100x the density that they currently are. 

And then you have to be in direct LOS to the tower to even get reasonable speed. 

5G is pretty shit tech, lmao. It doesn't kill bees like everyone's saying, and doesn't emit radiation harmful to fuck all, but it's shit tech. It's going to be useless. 

Get a 5G router top-of-the-line and put it behind a cement wall, you won't get any service through it. 

Get a low quality 4G router and you will get service through that cement wall. 

5G is dogshit."

worldnews,fmx04bg,t1_fmwzblc,1586456089.0,"No one's ""dooming"" Imao, I'm not OP. 

WHO situation report March 2020 has 80% asymptomatic, 15% serious, 5% life threatening. 

If we are only testing serious cases (15% + 5%) we can safely assume 60-80% of the cases go unreported. 

That's realistic, and if a country isn't testing 50%+ of their actual cases than it's just failing. 

Other countries who are testing at a rate 1000x per 100k people since you asked? Most European countries, SK, Japan, Taiwan."

Don't waste your time with this one."
worldnews,fmwxurf,t1_fmwroso,1586454943.0,"The fact that your post history states that you don't know what Nature Medicine is tells me you haven't taken a single public health course in your life. 

I've taken two, two bio courses too, and an anatomy course. All three classes heavily relied on Nature Med as a source, different schools too."

Because that's not testing."
