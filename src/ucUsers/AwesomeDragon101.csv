I actually don’t wanna have to think about EVs and stats all the time. I like that Pokémon games can be played with any party, so you can pick the dumbest cutest looking mons and take them to champ. Everyone is viable. That makes parties more personal, and people can Pokémon based on what they *like*, not what’s viable.

Also nuzlockes and other challenges are always a thing. And battling against the competitive nuts who breed for perfect EVs and type matchups. 

Casuals exist. Plenty of them. That’s why these games still get sales. Competitive folk have their challenges and battles with other competitive folk. Pokémon is a huge franchise with an even bigger audience. Not everyone is a goddamn tryhard.

gaming,fowewyh,t1_fowaotp,1588118441.0,"I tried playing a MOBA for the first time last month, smite.

I’m a casual player. I’m not the most skilled at games, but I play anyway because winning isn’t the only way for me to have fun. I was playing the arena mode a lot because I know I have zero grasp on lane rules and arena is just a big team deathmatch pit so my lack of strat skills would hurt the least there.

I tend to play guardians a lot, even though it might not 100% match my play style. Why? Because many reptilian gods happen to be guardians for some reason. Jormungandr, Fafnir, Sobek, etc. And there’s just something so much fun about, say, being a big ass world snake spouting toxic bubbles all over your enemies. It’s nice. And to me, being a dragon that takes some adjustment is so much more fun than playing some boring humanoid warrior that might better fit my style. But slowly, as I played, I started getting a few more kills and a TON more assists. I thought I was slowly getting better.

When I started playing with my friends who took the game seriously, apparently there were so many things wrong with how I play. Apparently guardians are supposed to die for the sake of saving the rest of the team? That I should shove myself in more instead of cautiously going in and out. That even though I got 8 kills and zero deaths and we were winning that is somehow really bad because I should be more focused on taking hits for others than attacking. I should either play like a guardian or not play reptile gods at all.

MOBAs scare me because even in a casual match, so much relies on what you do, and so many people take that seriously. One arena match I was being a big snek boi and figured I was in a good position to attack the other team, so I went in and spit some bubbles, then I started getting attacked by like three players so I got scared and backed out when I was at half health. Apparently I should’ve stayed there because me going in made my whole team want to follow, and when I left the opponents went to attacking the rest of my team and many people died. That’s so much goddamn pressure and I was immediately mega criticized. I get I fucked up bad but I’m just a cautious player that wanted to have fun being a reptile god damnit!

Idk, after a week of playing I got too scared to play again. I was having fun playing, and I almost want to jump back in again, but people take the most casual modes so seriously and I feel like my casual unskilled ass is unwelcome. I don’t have the time to grind to get better, and I’m usually exhausted by the time I finish enough of my life tasks to play games. I’m so satisfied with basic gameplay that I don’t want to exhaust the little energy I have to try to be skilled on top of that."

I edited my first couple words to make that clearer! I meant to say they are turtles lmao"
mildlyinteresting,folalat,t1_fokar4e,1587858188.0,"Correct! Box turtles are from the family Emydidae, which are the same family as sliders and pond turtles are in. It’s a mega diverse and huge turtle family so you get a huge diversity of morphologies in it. Tortoises, on the other hand, are in the family Testudinidae. 

They look very similar, but there are a few differences. Firstly, box turtles have a flap in their shell that closes when they hide in it, like shown above! Tortoises don’t have that. 

Second, on average tortoises are a whole lot bigger!!! Many box turtles are no bigger than a dinner plate while many fully grown tortoises can be as big as a medium dog or even a miniature pony! This isn’t always reliable as baby tortoises are small and not all tortoise species are huge, but if it’s massive that’s probably not a box turtle.

Third, and this is a little harder, but the intergular scales on the underside of a tortoise are often elevated and stick out, especially in males of some species so they can [flip each other over](https://youtu.be/jVkWgq4tEIo) when fighting for a female. In box turtles, they’re completely smooth since the shell much perfectly seal shut when the turtle is hiding. [Here are some pics for comparison!](https://imgur.com/a/u5t8E7M)

Tortoises are a kind of turtle though, like a squares-rectangles thing. So it’s definitely safe to say that no matter what you’re looking at, it’s an awesome turtle :D"
coolguides,fol3u4o,t3_g7yxbu,1587854345.0,"When cats lay on their back and expose their belly it actually means they’re showing you that they trust you by exposing their vulnerable belly to you. Some cats bite or scratch when you rub the belly anyway because to them, you betrayed their trust by touching the belly when they trusted you not to. Like taking advantage of their vulnerability.

Edit: The slow blinking is also a sign of trust. When they close their eyes in front of you they’re saying they trust you enough to not attack them when they’re not looking at you. If you slow blink back, you’re telling them that you trust them not to hurt you too. So they sometimes reciprocate."

They also have a cool vascular system in their flippers: their veins are wrapped around their thick arteries. So, warm blood goes through the arteries, cools in the flippers, and as the cool blood goes back through the veins wrapped around the warm arteries, it warms up!

MonitorLizards,fmqtr3p,t3_fwocw2,1586306872.0,"Well, dogs are domesticated while reptiles are not, so all that genetic evolution for living with humans has made dogs dependent on us, which brings a level of intimacy we don’t quite have with reptiles yet. 

Tameness, in the technical sense, is the degree that an undomesticated animal will allow a human to get close to it. And since this little guy is comfortable while perched directly onto you, I’d say he’s as tame as one could possibly get. So you’re already there my dude :D"
MakeMeSuffer,fmqt7jw,t1_fmqjicg,1586306536.0,Yeah mate I regularly frequent cursed subs and this was the first thing in a while that gave me goosebumps. I just grated carrots and cheese yesterday and the thoughts of this happening were still fresh in my mind.

bonecollecting,fm9hpzl,t3_fto9hc,1585868973.0,"Dude, frog skeletons are my absolute favorites, there are so many interesting things about them! Like how their tibia and fibula are fused and how their radius and ulna are fused, or how most frogs except for a couple of ancestral families have lost their ribs, or how they have two occipital condyles instead of one so they can’t move their heads from side to side very well, or how their pelvic girdle is so uniquely long and some frog families (such as fire belly toads) have a widened sacral transverse processes to support more leg muscle. Frogs are freaking awesome, and you’ve got yourself a badass skeleton my dude."
