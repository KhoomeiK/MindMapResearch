LateStageCapitalism,fn8tadi,t3_g07nql,1586749678.0,"This is a fun topic covered by Slavoj Zizek in his Pervert's Guide to Ideology--the idea that corporations increase their profitability by having consumers feel like they have marked an ideological checkbox by buying a particular product. The extension of that is what is covered in this post. Sometimes corporations tell you, ""We'll donate $*x* to *y* cause for each *z* you buy,"" but other times they skip that altogether and simply act as a go-between. Then they are saying, ""Give us $*x*, and we'll give it to *y* cause,"" without ever making it clear that they will take 100% of the credit. You think McDonald's can't fully fund the Ronald McDonald House charity? You think UberEats can't donate food directly to people in need? You think they need your extra money, money beyond what you're already giving them for their product, to be able to help others? Bull fucking shit. Fuck them, fuck their ""optics,"" and fuck the marketing leeches who came up with this fucked up bullshit.

I appreciate you pointing out that his points still tickle the fancies of liberals like those on MSNBC too, which I think really highlights your point about how he avoids any talk of class. Your linking his ""safety third"" to the point of corporations always caring about profit and production really helped solidify where he stands on things.

I came across his new book recently, and after glancing at the cover and reading the blurb, I had this eerie feeling he wasn't who I thought he was.
