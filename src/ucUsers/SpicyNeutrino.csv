mathmemes,fpmboqb,t1_fply5sh,1588729611.0,Someone really took their Nokia 6600 out of their pocket to take a picture of someone else's screen displaying a garbage version of this overused meme.
YubaCity,fpi1lw6,t1_fpfel09,1588631878.0,"That being said, the face mask requirement is a huge step forward. It's odd that they would take that precaution while opening businesses."
UCSantaBarbara,fp372ac,t1_fp16gnw,1588274219.0,Lol these professor emails spread like wildfires on college subreddits. Who knows where this is actually from.
MarioMaker,fp2yvbi,t1_fp1kgee,1588270200.0,Imo it was his fault. He should have hit the switch and jumped to the flag at the same time. I'm all for toying with people and being toxic on vs but you have to take responsibility for when it backfires.
MarioMaker,fp2w8w6,t1_fp2vay5,1588268933.0,"I agree that we shouldn't expect people to wait at the goal. I do like that it is an option, though. Waiting at the goal is a very fun way to be wholesome and cooperative online. It's also a fun way to be toxic and take the goal away from someone trying to wait for you. The ability to exact mercy on your opponents at your own risk is one of the things that makes multiplayer enjoyable for me."
college,fp2u2q9,t1_fp2q8qa,1588267896.0,"I think that would be good. Usually if a professor isn't being responsive, you can talk to the personally in class or office hours but now that isn't an option. That's all good! I mostly meant that at a lot of universities, the professors main job is research rather than teaching so complaints against the latter often don't go far. 

Good luck!"
college,fp2pd9p,t3_gaz8y9,1588265652.0,"What kind of geometry? In most math classes, the most promising study method I've ever used was doing as many practice problems in the book as I can. If a proof is really involved and important, I usually go through it on my own with a pen and paper."
college,fp2oewj,t3_gayxdh,1588265203.0,"Not gonna lie, if you're at a big research university, there's a good chance any complaint would go nowhere unless it's a really big deal. These professors probably get complaints from failing students every term, especially if they grade harshy and don't try too hard to interact with the students.

I think your best chance would be to talk to the university about allowing you to drop or change the grading or something on the grounds that the transition to online was the underlying cause rather than the professor. Most universities have already been implementing policies because the transition to online causes so many problems for students and professors."
math,foxgnam,t1_fowaeqr,1588143410.0,"I think most of those who want to push those boundaries choose to endure the bad part of their work because they find it fulfilling in itself. There are plenty of happy mathematicians out there along with communities that find their abstract work important. 

In my opinion, the loneliness and depression associated with grad students has more to do with the conditions grad students are often put into nowadays than the subjects they study.

I do agree that it's concerning that modern math/physics has become more and more specialized over time though. On the other hand, it's kind of amazing that there are so many distinct and important mathematical topics out there that people are learning more about."
ACTrade,folx2t3,t3_g87emu,1587872565.0,I can get you all the pink roses you need. 150k sound good?
ACTrade,fold464,t1_folcmvi,1587859678.0,"I knew it was too good to be true. I'll probably pass then, thank you though!"
ACTrade,folcks8,t3_g843t0,1587859354.0,10 NMT for 200k? I'm interested!
hiphopheads,fo4uukn,t1_fo4m6ao,1587511664.0,High-key made my day. Thanks for sharing.
hiphopheads,fo4u0uu,t1_fo4qhj4,1587511191.0,"It's definitely cringy when he throws in his hot takes. Some of them were pretty funny in my opinion though. Like his weird monologue about masturbation was so unexpected that I laughed. 

Maybe it was just my really low expectations going in but I thought that this song was a step up for him. It made me cringe but less than half as much as the usual Hopsin track."
hiphopheads,fo4p3e6,t1_fo4lmrj,1587508495.0,The toilet paper line was pretty good though. You can't make a covid song without referencing toilet paper.
MarioMaker,fo1wh85,t1_fo1kgqn,1587443106.0,"I am blown away. If someone would have told me they thought all this stuff would be in an update, I wouldn't have believed them."

ACTrade,fnqvfmq,t1_fnqtjmp,1587173094.0,"If you're still doing it, I'd love to stop by :) I can get you red and yellow rose seeds. Just let me know how many!"
ACTrade,fnppjos,t1_fnpn4s6,1587149647.0,Yeah! Sorry for getting back to you after a while. I'll PM you with the dodo code.

ACTrade,fnnutgd,t3_g2vxpk,1587102396.0,I have a white box corner sofa! What kind of diys do you have?
ACTrade,fnnu80g,t1_fnnswbf,1587101875.0,I have a life ring and a crafting bench if you'd like those in whatever color. I'm pretty early in the game and am in need of new flooring and wallpaper haha. May I come by?
starterpacks,fn51w29,t1_fn4qfgg,1586653961.0,I see. What hoops does the FDA impose that you think they should remove them? I was under the impression they were largely for public safety.
starterpacks,fn4pl8i,t1_fn4n4vr,1586646237.0,Are small drug business viable anywhere? I've never heard of anything like that in Europe.
MarioMaker,fmnv3sx,t1_fmlrg0a,1586236150.0,Great level! I love speedruns like this.
AskReddit,fmjm1wy,t1_fmjdxyq,1586133046.0,That's what JCS stands for? I had no idea lol. I love that channel
