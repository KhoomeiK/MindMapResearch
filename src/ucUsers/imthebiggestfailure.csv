UCSD,fp4m8q0,t3_gb7fkc,1588302136.0,"Depending on what class you want to take during the summer is the college you should pick because not all classes are offered. Once you now what classes you want to take, google “assist” and it will show you the equivalent course other schools have that can be transferred to ucsd. Make sure to look at the summer schedule for the college you plan on registering for to make sure they have the class this summer."

UCSD,flott6g,t3_fq61zt,1585345339.0,I’m taking Math 20B with professor Vlemming next quarter and she posted her syllabus on canvas where she said we will have no traditional midterms and finals. Instead we will have an open book open note quiz every week to make sure we are learning the material.
