ForwardsFromKlandma,fp873ce,t1_fp6rdpa,1588385188.0,I think it’s quite sad. A lot of capitalism and the ideas of conformity ruin it. Europeans have lots of culture but most culture in white america are things that have been marketed. Puritanism doesn’t help either.

ForwardsFromKlandma,fp7oqkr,t1_fp65bfd,1588374697.0,"Yes, I feel like the main problem is the exploitation aspect. Culture is something meant to be shared and introduced to people. Something that is experienced and meant to bring people together and exemplify various identities of people. When people try to take it for their own and exploit it for profit, it steals from the people who live with it. It no longer becomes something sacred and is seen as something that can be bought and sold. Then, these people will try to claim that they invented and thus own the property to something that came from a culture. People lose something that was personal to them and their shared experiences. That’s the difference between what this guy is arguing and actual white culture. Those things were made for a collective push towards technological advancement and are marketed. The hairstyle comes from a shared experience within black people and their communities."

NarcissisticAbuse,fp45oqa,t3_gawbin,1588292196.0,"I really put it simply with this new guy that I’m dating that I got out of a toxic relationship and I’m still working with myself as days go on. He was very understanding about it and hasn’t tried to push my boundaries. I told him about it when I fully felt comfortable with him and like I could trust him. It was a really refreshing experience to hear all the ways he disagreed with many of the behaviors and still continues to. I feel like it has helped him understand some of my behaviors and just me as a person more. I don’t try to let much of how I had to act to survive in the past affect me as much anymore and treat him like a new experience though. Of course, I look out for any red flags I see of problems that could come up later. However, I still tried my best to build this new relationship on a foundation of trust, understanding, and free of co-dependent behaviors. This relationship has to be one of the easiest ones I’ve been in so far other than the fact that we are apart due to this epidemic. That’s all my advice, good luck out there. Don’t let this person take away your capacity to accept love and build trust."

If I’m getting this frustrated then i should really just stop playing because there’s much more fulfilling things I should be doing. No, don’t feel bad.

It’s a weird thing where the ability to change it like that is considered more beautiful than people naturally that way. I’ve had weird experiences with the white people around me trying to tan deeply and then comparing themselves with my skin even though I’m not really brown.

It makes no sense how a GMO could cause any harm to the body unless it’s directly engineered to. Most of the fruits and vegetables we have already are GMOs from selective breeding.
