KnowingBetter,fp0tftr,t1_fozh76o,1588216530.0,"Economic incentive, via government policy, is literally the *only* thing that will save us from global warming. If you don't make emission-free economically viable, it's not going to happen."
KnowingBetter,fp0t5rs,t1_fozkc9l,1588216350.0,"Actually, isn't one thing that might make nuclear more attractive on the business side is, well, cap and trade?"
KnowingBetter,fozuu3f,t1_fozg4fx,1588197258.0,"These are fine, brief points to be skeptical of cap and trade and/or carbon taxes. (Reasons I'd personally disagree with; countries manage high tax rates and big government spending on welfare despite grumblings of the rich; granted it's hard, but many of those in power will grumble at any solution. But I digress). Regardless, it still makes your brief comments in the video about it incorrect and totally misleading to any viewer who doesn't know about cap and trade and hadn't formed an informed opinion. A cap on carbon, operating as it theoretically should, *would* change the net carbon emissions, which you explicitly denied in the video under your theoretical and simple explanation of how it's supposed to work by completely denying that ""cap"" is part of ""cap and trade"".

Edit: and to be primarily against cap and trade because of ""lobbying""?? I mean, I like nuclear, but as your own solution presented in the video, nuclear is also know for having some pretty ardent lobbying against it."
KnowingBetter,fozblbx,t1_foz9ocr,1588187925.0,"There's a literal imposed *cap* on carbon in cap and trade. So no, a company cannot just buy unlimited carbon credits. It's not just ""trade"", it's ""cap and trade"". For one, if a company did try to buy all the carbon credits, it would get prohibitively expensive because, get this, with a cap there's A LIMITED SUPPLY OF CARBON TO BUY. So there *is* a literal change in net carbon emissions. I don't understand why this is so hard to understand, but again, the net emissions necessarily go down because there's a CAP. But yes, it's a market solution. That doesn't make it ineffective, though. It's your bias against market solutions on principle coming out."
KnowingBetter,foz9xr7,t3_gadf9g,1588187136.0,"I couldn't agree more. It was a big disappointment, especially given his terrible description of how it works, totally focusing on the ""trade"" without addressing what the ""cap"" means (or completely misrepresenting what it means). I'm all for nuclear, and like the rest of the video, but that short bit dismissing cap and trade was about enough for me to dislike the video. I don't know if he just didn't do his research, or did improper research by looking into and only buying the biased ""no market solution is ever good"" crowd's argument. It's also one of the more serious and complex issues out there, yet he devoted all but 5 seconds to it, less time than any of the other solution dismissals. Totally disappointing

Edit: Also, given the public's unfortunate distaste of nuclear that I think would be really hard to reverse, his video dismissed the only viable alternative. So, arguably, the video is dangerous in its dismissal of the best weapon we have to fight climate change."
ucla,foz73t8,t1_foz08wk,1588185786.0,"On which side? I can see an argument for either way. One can argue that online versions need to be made simpler in order to be doable remotely; hence easier.  One could also argue that those on campus have easier access to education opportunities and would get a superior education, but isn't that exactly the point? At some point it becomes really hard to argue that *everyone* should have less access to education purely out of solidarity for those few unable to come to campus. If we did that, campus would literally never reopen. In the meantime, the best we can do is make every possible accomodation to make the distance learning portion as good as it can be for those who would be unable to attend in person, without unilaterally saying that *no one* can come to campus unless *everyone* can come. Someone's always, say, in the hospital for some reason or another even in the best of times, after all. 

Of course, I'm not saying we're at a threshold which warrants people to return to campus yet. But there is a threshold pre-vaccine where that threshold can be debated, given enough testing and low-enough infection rates."
ucla,foxmw9w,t1_foxgy67,1588149121.0,"why? while I disagree with much of the email (in its vagueness or its explicit refusal to give a refund for certain earmarked fees), why not give students the option to be on campus in the Fall under certain circumstances? If a student is part of the susceptible community, then make every accommodation needed to make the lectures available online, discussions online, and even alternate lab assignments. But otherwise, welcome those willing and able to attend (under certain public health thresholds), who would greatly prefer to be present in person to enrich their learning experience."
ucla,foxmh3v,t1_foxkutn,1588148722.0,"Yup. I don't think anyone's asking for a full refund. Profs and TA's and staff still need to get paid. But some of the fees are earmarked for specific things that literally can't be used; that's ridiculous and I can't fathom how they can justify, e.g., rec fees when we can't use the gym."
HistoryMemes,fohnc7c,t1_fohjane,1587768898.0,"I mean, having a self proclaimed *emperor* is kinda like having a self proclaimed *empire*. Just saying you have an empire and/or emperor doesn't just make it so, which was largely Voltaire's (somewhat flippant, but still insightful) point."
HistoryMemes,fogxqmg,t1_fogscud,1587758183.0,Neither holy nor Roman nor an empire. Yep.
HistoryMemes,fogor3v,t1_fog6anc,1587755226.0,"I can see an argument for Korea given the principal goal of containment. By that measure, communism was ""contained"" on the peninsula to North Korea. Definitely not nearly a total victory though. But Vietnam?!?"
HistoryMemes,fognq2o,t1_fog3yre,1587754879.0,"Based on a friend of mine who is German (now lives in the US, but born and raised in Germany until moving for college) it sounds like the Holy Roman Empire was definitely romanticized for him. Hell, he views the EU as a reincarnation of the Holy Roman Empire today, and in a positive manner. Has a Holy Roman Empire flag in his office. Tell him the famous Voltaire quote and he gets upset and defensive."

HistoryMemes,fnx4n65,t1_fnx2dng,1587331390.0,"It's also a two-way cultural exchange street. Think about the roots of where the banjo came from. It certainly took inspiration from other plucked string instruments, including European ones as well as African ones."
neoliberal,fnpdwfa,t1_fno9083,1587143798.0,"Could also be Trump taking credit for the individual stimulus checks and signing his name on them? Even though he's not really responsible for that either, he'll take full credit for it anyway."
forwardsfromgrandma,fnpbbky,t1_fnomkex,1587142500.0,"I think the more important thing they don't recognize is that the coronavirus death toll would be, and still has the potential to be, far higher than if we hadn't been taking these social distancing measures (even if much of the country is doing it imperfectly or not at all). It's the classic argument of antivaxxers. ""The total number of people who die from measles nowadays is so small, why do we even need these vaccines anymore?"" Never stopping to think, hey, why *are* the numbers for measles so much lower than they used to be? (Answer: vaccines)

Also, if it hasn't already, the coronavirus death toll will soon and easily pass this season's influenza death toll. Typical flu deaths in the US per year number between about 20 and 60 thousand depending on its severity that year. Coronavirus deaths are at over 30 thousand and climbing for the US. Total deaths from coronavirus this year will likely be at least double that figure. And going back to my previous paragraph, if no action was taken at all, the death toll would likely have been in the millions."
consulting,fnnzyjd,t1_fnnzba8,1587107151.0,"I mean, the US is also using professors/experts? Admittedly, the Trump administration is not adequately listening to them (see Dr. Fauci), but many of the governors are. Basically, I honestly believe that the US's response would have been much stronger were it not for the highly unusual circumstances we find ourselves in in terms of who is in charge of the highest level of govt (i.e. if it weren't for Trump). But many states (see California) are handling the situation better than almost every country in Europe, arguably."
