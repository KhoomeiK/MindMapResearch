ucr,fpk5uqt,t1_fpb9yk7,1588688577.0,thank you! i was wondering how long was your exam? i might have another exam 1.5 hours after that placement test so im lowkey freaking out over it ;n;
ucr,fpk5iqh,t3_gd3xyf,1588688390.0,"i think the worst part about finding living spaces rn (usually the case for me to start house hunting) is the fact that everyone is stuck at home and i no longer feel safe enough to go house tour. i ended up just renewing my lease because i'll be staying in  socal.

i do think you should just wait until we're notified as to when instruction will be in person. a lot of people do last minute moving anyways if u just look into the subleasing/housing facebook  group. you'd find a place so don't worry too much rn. it's okay. 

hM for the furniture part, if you're really on a budget at that point and you can't find a furnished apartment, you can think about buying only the essentials like a mattress, a desk, and a chair. (you can prob bring a chair and the desk from home OR look up used furnitures to save money)"
ucr,fpk47ca,t3_gdko50,1588687651.0,"that's so lame :c wtf why would they act like that toward? like i had profs that go over like a couple minutes, but never 18 min (we have recorded lectures too so honestly u can just leave at the end of lecture if ur busy)"
ucr,fpk3vt6,t1_fpfadoc,1588687464.0,"oh i hate this mindset..... i don't think ""vacation"" limits your activity and make you stressed out about everything :/ i noticed that some of my classes had a lot more reading than normal too so I chose to drop those classes (i couldn't catch up with the readings quick enough xD)"
ucr,fpk3o7f,t3_gdgw22,1588687342.0,lol thanks i didn't even notice it

ucr,fnwxwqf,t3_g3xhq6,1587327616.0,"you would have to complete the requirements for major change by the end of your first year at ucr. after that, you're stuck in chass if you don't complete your requirements and the adviser will just tell you to find another major you're interested in. i don't want to discourage you, but you should be prepared to give it your best. good luck"
ucr,fnj104g,t3_g21vtb,1586989936.0,"eh just to let you know, i think if you're switching from chass into bcoe/cnas, you have to do it within your first year here at ucr. afterwards, they won't let you"
BobsBurgers,fn9kov1,t1_fn99v8i,1586776637.0,"i think it would be fun to see him driven to the corner with the combo of louise and mr. fischoeder. i think if they replace mr. branca with mr. ambrose, it will be interesting to see him and frond together."
BobsBurgers,fn9kf5z,t3_g091yg,1586776362.0,"house 5!

why: 

house 2 - sorry but i really dislike gayle

house 4 - i love mickey but idk how this combo will work esp with mike and tammy (tammy is p annoying too); jimmy pesto just likes to make fun of bob

house 3 - ah...... andy and ollie. idk how getting stuck in the same house with them would feel

house 1 - honestly this combo seems p fun. like u have hugo and gretchen. i don't really feel much for jimmy jr. im tired of teddy appearing so much too. \[this would be my second choice\]"
ucr,fn8zd4q,t3_g0ast7,1586754494.0,"aww you're fine or you're going to be fine. by ""excluded"", did you meant that your friends kind of just exclude you from group activities (and you're feeling hurt by that?) or did you meant that you just didn't experience that typical ""college life""? not everyone is a party person though, like if you're into that, you do you. if you're not, don't feel bad for being yourself and preferring to stay home and chill. 

it's fine to go your own flow. everyone has their own flow. i kind of feel the same way sometimes, like everyone else around me is advancing forward while i feel like i'm some sort of left behind child who is stuck in the same spot. i don't think getting a bf (at least rn) is a good idea because i don't want to think that the solution to my insecurities is to get a bf (someone who will feed me attention). i want to work on myself and build myself up. 

i'm glad you're feeling better now.  good night :-)"
MakeupAddiction,fn70z8j,t3_fzp4nh,1586711179.0,happy birthday! u look beautiful today :-)
ucr,fn6qf0u,t3_fzt6ym,1586705256.0,"you may only switch from chass to cnas/bcoe within your first year. honestly, it depends on what major you're switching into and the amount of requirements you would have to finish. 

generally, i don't suggest ucr \^ if that applies to you, but it's your call. i hope you good luck."
ucr,fmxw9sc,t1_fmxvq3y,1586473127.0,".\_. me too......

i'd just added econ125 and is waiting for my ilearn page to refresh with the course on it so i'd know if i'd miss anything..... i feel so annoyed with stuff like this now because either some profs suck at online teaching or there is too much reading"
ucr,fmxs72q,t3_fy029u,1586470841.0,"ah I have so much trouble understanding what he is saying.... like I want to respect that he don't feel comfortable. However, we're paying normal price for these shitty unorganized zoom classes. I feel like pre-recorded lectures would had been better for everyone. 

His reasoning for keeping lecture this way is so class will be more interactive. However, by turning off chat, I don't see how interactive this can be. He could had done pre-recorded lectures and have several office hours opened for students who did not understand what he is saying during those videos."
