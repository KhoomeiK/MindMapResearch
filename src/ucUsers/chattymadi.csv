UCSantaBarbara,fpfdahc,t1_fpejnn7,1588567924.0,Ok i guess that makes some sense.
UCSantaBarbara,fpe5b5h,t3_gclf9m,1588540638.0,Wouldn’t the school just unenroll them as students then? I could be wrong but isn’t that what happens?
UCSantaBarbara,fpe0pb1,t1_fpduks8,1588538034.0,Calling me out for miscalculating a number is one thing. Questioning my hard work on getting into this school is another low and I will not tolerate it. So fuck you. Go back to calling the cops on people who go to the beach
UCSantaBarbara,fpe0ke3,t1_fpduks8,1588537956.0,Fuck you. How dare you question my ability to get into a college. I got into this school because I worked my ass off to get here. I calculated percents given certain numbers. So fuck off with your 5 year old playground insults and go back to your social distancing
UCSantaBarbara,fpdu8hf,t1_fpdu50o,1588534338.0,Yep that’s me! ;)
UCSantaBarbara,fpdmxyn,t1_fpdmj8g,1588530167.0,"If we won’t know a real death figure until later then why the hell are people bringing it up at all if it’s “inaccurate” and “we won’t know”. If that’s the case, don’t bring up the death rate then. And anyways, a majority of people dying had pre existing conditions or were elderly, given the few special cases that are always blown up on the media to try and tell people it’s worse than it is. Either way, this thing has been blown up no matter what angle you look at it from"
UCSantaBarbara,fpdik56,t1_fpdi46b,1588527682.0,"Using the previous commenters number of 100,000 and the US population of 382.2 million, divide and multiply by 100 that’s what you get. If you’d like I can look up the actual death rate and use that instead of trusting the previous commenter? Actual deaths is about 68000 which brings the death rate even lower to 0.0207%. That number came from the CDC itself"
UCSantaBarbara,fpdcqjd,t1_fpdc6nd,1588524417.0,"The death rate is .026%, which is tiny. The media has blown this up. I’m not anti-science, I’m anti-fear and anti-blowing shit out of proportion. The people who have lost family and friends, that sucks. It really does. But I haven’t lost anyone thank god, and so I can’t mourn for every single person that has died nor can I act like caretaker to everyone still alive and worry about their wellbeing when I have shit to do"
UCSantaBarbara,fpdbtz8,t1_fpdbi53,1588523904.0,"The US is approaching 100k deaths yet it has 300  million people in it. That’s not a lot. Not to mention the numbers are fudged a little, they’re claiming anything as corona these days. And I’m. Actually not part of the problem. I’ve been social distancing, wearing a mask, staying home. I don’t go outside. Don’t say I’m part of the fucking problem when I’m doing what everyone else is doing otherwise I’m gonna go outside and become the problem to be petty. I’m simply expressing my opinion that you can’t control everyone nor do I have the mental capacity to worry about every single person on this earth that isn’t myself and my family. I’d never live my life if I thought that way"
UCSantaBarbara,fpdb7ah,t1_fpcxuxl,1588523546.0,You get it!
UCSantaBarbara,fpdb5u9,t1_fpcnflg,1588523523.0,It’s not a literal saying dude it’s metaphorical ffs
UCSantaBarbara,fpc0orz,t1_fpc0j02,1588483948.0,"Can’t worry about the whole worlds wellbeing. I can’t worry about every single other person besides myself. I do what I feel is safe to do for me and my family, you do what you feel is safe, and let’s not shit on the other person’s decision. Sound good enough to you?"
UCSantaBarbara,fpc0f1b,t1_fpc07de,1588483717.0,Exactly what I was thinking. It just seems entitled and pretentious to call the cops
UCSantaBarbara,fpbzxd8,t1_fpbzl97,1588483301.0,"Ok, understood now. The phrase should be more of a “mind your own business” thing for me and I tend to use it in a joking way. But the thought of tattling on people for being at the beach is absolutely mind-boggling to me"
UCSantaBarbara,fpbztyx,t1_fpbzfth,1588483220.0,"If people are taking precautions already and still getting sick, then what the hell is the point? Maybe you should hit the beach sometime, get some fresh air. I personally am tired of living in fear that I “could” get some sickness. I could get any sickness any day and die from it. This whole living in fear thing doesn’t really sit well for me and quite frankly I’m already upset I’ve wasted a month of my life not doing what I need to do because everyone wants to be afraid of a virus. Yes, it could kill you. So could a car accident. So could choking in your sleep. So could literally anything else. So let people enjoy a day at the beach and get away from the stresses of this shit"
UCSantaBarbara,fpbzcye,t1_fpbz15u,1588482823.0,"It’s closer to a freedom of choice that has slowly been stripped away since this whole thing started. And quite frankly, it’s turning people against each other and causing fear and panic amongst us. Plus, the group of people could very well already live together. It’s nobodies business and you’re not the law! The beaches aren’t closed, so they’re not doing anything illegal"
UCSantaBarbara,fpbz53t,t1_fpbz2ow,1588482643.0,Them going to the beach puts themselves and other people at the beach at risk. YOU are not at risk if YOU are not at the beach. It’s that simple
UCSantaBarbara,fpbyxvs,t1_fpbytm4,1588482478.0,"You’re just as likely to get it from the grocery store, if not more likely, than from isolating with a group of friends at the beach. If you’re not at the beach, you’re not at risk. Leave them alone"
UCSantaBarbara,fpbyfx6,t1_fpbxlkq,1588482073.0,Wanna elaborate?
UCSantaBarbara,fpbyev2,t1_fpby2cw,1588482050.0,It is snitching when it’s none of your business and you’re trying to control how people behave. They’re not doing anything illegal if the beaches are open and they’re choosing to do that to themselves. You just stay home and you’ll be fine so don’t try to dictate how others spend their time. This virus doesn’t thrive in heat anyways
UCSantaBarbara,fpbtcxo,t1_fpbdi07,1588478216.0,Snitches get stitches
UCSantaBarbara,foxfgck,t3_g9xia3,1588142366.0,"If you decide not to do orientation, just make sure you fully research what classes you should take. Don’t worry about the later pass time, they reserve spaces for you. If you are enrolling with a declared major, google UCSB (your major) and it should pull up the department website for your major. You’ll want to find your major check sheet if you don’t have one already, because there could potentially be prerequisites for the major that you need to start on ASAP (I’m a bio major and I messed up not taking Chem right away, so be aware). You can also do this on Gold by going to major and progress checks, and it should give some info on your major requirements. Then, for AP just look up UCSB LASAR and There’s a section which tells you which classes NOT to take because you’ve already received credit for them. It also tells you how many units you’ve already earned. After that, it’s basically a matter of planning a good schedule, choosing about 20 classes you’d be ok taking first quarter, and not being too picky with classes (freshman always get the last choice in classes). I’m finishing up my freshman year now, so orientation is still fresh in my mind. It has benefits sure, but it’s also ok to forego it if you feel you can navigate your way through scheduling by yourself. Good luck with whatever you choose and welcome to UCSB!"
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fol4djx,t1_fol2tei,1587854651.0,That’s what I didn’t get! Why didnt he call 911 and then just alert you guys that he called 911? But hey shock and adrenaline work in weird ways
TalesFromTheFrontDesk,fokzgki,t3_g7r34e,1587851898.0,"I’m shocked the roommate actually waited in line to tell the front desk. Like, idk about anyone else but if my roommate is dead I’m sorry but I’m gonna be panicking and probably frantically asking for help, sorry if I cut in line. Crazy what people do sometimes. Tragic tho"
ThreadGames,fofxum0,t1_fofxr3x,1587744711.0,Thats it! That makes so much sense
ThreadGames,fofxot7,t1_fofxdrb,1587744631.0,You’re the best! Thanks! I think my confusion was that Mark quoted it in a video somewhere but I have definitely seen that. Thank you!
ThreadGames,fofw9bd,t1_foego4p,1587743919.0,This is from something and it’s really bothering me that I can’t quite place where it’s from. I wanna say Markiplier because I can hear him saying that but I’m scared to be wrong
TooAfraidToAsk,fo0wtta,t1_fo07m3i,1587421262.0,"I’m not entirely sure how your response fits my question, but cool story"
TooAfraidToAsk,fo0wp1d,t1_fo0ofwe,1587421189.0,"Thank you for clarifying! I figured it varies by family or whatever, but I wanted something like this. I find it interesting that they sometimes refer to their parents by name tho. I guess if the parent is ok with that then more power to them! But yeah, I figured with the constant breaking down of gender barriers, kids would become more and more adjusted to the whole asking for pronouns thing. Thanks for the info!"
creepypasta,fo0nenx,t1_fo02da8,1587416258.0,"If you went under your blankets to hide from whatever it was, then it wasn’t sleep paralysis. Paralysis means you can’t move at all, so if you get under a blanket, you’re not exactly paralyzed"
TooAfraidToAsk,fo073d9,t1_fo06pr4,1587407229.0,"Yeah I figured with trans people it’s a bit different, as they actually have gendered pronouns like mom and dad, but as far as I’m aware there’s no pronouns for non binary parents, so I figured I’d ask what one does in that scenario. But still I’d imagine any gender change would cause some sort of dissonance for the children no doubt so it’s interesting to read about"
YouShouldKnow,fnwscww,t1_fnv7zeq,1587324497.0,Well MOST of the ones I’ve come across have had them sooo. I literally said in my post that not all of them have them and not to call me out for wording so idk what you’re doing
AskReddit,fn90nyi,t1_fn8rjdi,1586755624.0,"The first time I was informed that the sun can and will die, I was in 2nd or 3rd grade and was informed by a teacher at my school that wasn’t my teacher. I was absolutely GUTTED at the thought and my mom was livid at the teacher, seeing as how a 3rd grader has no business being told that information (at least in my opinion). I think that was the beginning of my somewhat frequent existential crises that I have. I love space, but god, if I think about it too much or too hard I have a full on panic attack. But fuck that teacher man, he was an asshole."
shortscarystories,fn8y60o,t3_g03cz0,1586753487.0,I could totally picture this as a Black Mirror episode. Just fucked up enough to make me love it! Amazing job!
biology,fn8xv06,t1_fn8wkoa,1586753238.0,Honestly fascinating stuff. I would imagine it’s also really hard to study virus evolution too considering. But fascinating regardless
biology,fn8ulmr,t1_fn8tnsu,1586750652.0,"Well viruses can’t reproduce without living things so if I had to take a guess I’d say living things, but I am curious on how viruses came about. Interesting question."
