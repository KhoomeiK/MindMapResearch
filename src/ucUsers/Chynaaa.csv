Georgia,fpb9z8q,t1_fp5i74q,1588465299.0,"Did you try to get the card using the ""Renewal"" section? The ""class ID regular license"" is not it. That is for a non-driver ID. It should offer a ""Class C Regular License"" when you are in the Renewal section. Does the website say you currently have a Class D license?  This is what the website said ""If you are over 18 and have a Learner's Permit (Class CP), the system will also display a Class D License, if eligible. Select Renewal in the top right-hand corner to process your new Class C License."""
Georgia,fp5fr8h,t3_gb447p,1588327729.0,"Was your issue with the website that it wasnâ€™t loading properly, crashing, or just not letting you move forward in the process? If so, this is caused by website being hit with a ton of traffic right now. Just keep trying or try it after midnight. We were finally able to do it at 12:03 am after fighting with the website all day and giving up. It worked flawlessly then. 

You should be able to change it to a class D online. However, if you are over 18, you donâ€™t need the class D. You immediately go to a class C. 

This is the information for how to do it online: https://dds.georgia.gov/covid-19-and-road-test-appointments

If you do decide to go in, this is the information on what you need to bring.

Georgia,fp5ea4t,t1_fp4i08v,1588326136.0,You donâ€™t even go in. You just go to the website and process it like you are renewing your license. Pay $27 and you have a full class C drivers license that doesnâ€™t expire until 2028.
stimuluscheck,fovgoi3,t1_fou8y42,1588101008.0,"Yea, how do you actually reach a person right now? I've tried and it just says they are always closed."
stimuluscheck,fotjvbj,t3_g9fpy6,1588056176.0,"Yea, my return has been processing since 3/25. I understand why things are delayed but it absolutely sucks."
UCI,fot6zym,t1_fosfib5,1588046076.0,"Yea, I was a student at UCI and now live in GA. It's bad. My family is NOT going out. Only me for groceries once every two weeks."
personalfinance,fnfsirm,t1_fnf78co,1586914546.0,Thank you! Iâ€™ve just been more worried about it than usual because our family was claimed as dependents on someone elseâ€™s 2018 return. Those people have not filed for 2019. I hoping it wonâ€™t make a mess of these stimulus payments.
personalfinance,fnfs2i9,t1_fnf9qnh,1586914281.0,"Oh wow, thatâ€™s crazy. I will check them out next time around. I usually go with Turbo Tax but did not want to pay the large amounts they require when you have self employment income. Lesson learned."
personalfinance,fnf4i5u,t1_fnf30mq,1586901252.0,"Well, that's hopefully a positive thing for us but the amount on the dotted line is missing as well. Our other income was self-employment income so it was not included on the same line. The total on that line is the scholarship income."
adhdmeme,ffjyn33,t1_ffithi0,1580010564.0,"Yea, when you hit too many it just puts a smiley face where the count is ðŸ™ƒ"
