Veterans,fpiq2ml,t3_gde55h,1588646204.0,"Can't say for sure so don't quote me on it but from my understanding unless you are 100% P&T all of your conditions are subject to re examinations by law. 

When you file a new claim there is a chance your one of your disabilities might be decreased (this is very rare apparently but it happened to me, I had no re-examination). 

The only veteran that I know personally is a close friend of mine and he has been 80% since we got out in 2015. Your rating is subject to change (it's what the regulation says) unless you are P&T which you can only get if you are 100%. Even though you are subject to the re-examination they don't happen often. 

There is an exception though, if you have the same conditions at the same rating (they could call you back in or not) a certain period of time it won't change. Its either 10 or 20 years I can't remember. You won't be told that your disability is static you get your rating and that's it, even if its obvious like a loss of limb.

I know this because I did research and looked into why one of my disabilities was decreased when I filled for an increase."

I've been seeing people ask this, I never filled a claim for IU or TDIU. I filled a for an increase for my condition (the VSO rep said it would be easier to just file a new claim than to appeal my last claim) 

Will the VA give you IU or TDIU if you never filled a claim for it? I'm guessing no? I'm pretty sure its a different VA form number you use, getting IU/TDIU would really fuck me."

Also the events that happened between Israel and Palestine made him hate the West.

Edit: I know that there is more to this, please feel free to add in the extra details. 

 I just wanted to point out that he turned against the US for other reasons, not just because they stopped giving him money.

 He didn't need the US for money because he was supported by the Saudis. The Saudis were involved with supporting him during the war against the USSR. The US was able to provide military hardware such as the anti-aircraft Stinger missle launcher which helped turned the tide of the war during the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan."
