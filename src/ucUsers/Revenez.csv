The videos look pretty similar to videos I saw from Lust and Tension. He also mentioned ScareLA, which featured The Lust Experience. The second video links directly to The Lust Experience, so I think there's definitely some connection. Either it's a part of The Experiences or it's a seriously big gamejacker."

Pros of Procreate:

* No ads
* Interface is more intuitive, less cluttered
* Huge community creating free and premium brushes
* Touch controls are a bit easier to manage
* Robust brush creation tools
* Fewer canvas size limitations
* Easy to record a high quality video

povertyfinance,foii9m0,t1_fohwp8w,1587787305.0,"I dunno if this is at all helpful, but rice has an indefinite shelf life (aside from brown rice, which is 3-6 month due to some of the oils in it). Unopened cans of beans can last 3 to 5 years. Frozen vegetables can last a year. Shredded cheese only lasts 5 to 7 days, but hard cheese can last up to six weeks if you're willing to grate it. [Here's a microwave-only recipe of beans and rice](https://nerdymamma.com/5-minute-red-beans-rice/), plus some spices for flavor. 

You can buy a big bag of rice for only a couple dollars and a can of beans for less than a dollar. It's a really good option to save even more money, and give you the ability to spice up your meal by adding veggies, more cheese, spices, etc."

It lets you reposition your phone into a top-down position. You'll also want to think about editing software. Shotcut on Windows and iMovie on OSX are free options, there's also Premiere Pro that's available through a Creative Cloud subscription.

If you're interested in investing some money into this:

* A cheap microphone, like the [Blue Snowball](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Condenser-Microphone-Cardioid/dp/B014PYGTUQ/)
* Good lighting, either some [clamp lights](https://www.amazon.com/Unknown-PZ-300-INCH-CLAMP-LIGHT/dp/B000KKLPOU) (budget option) or [softboxes](https://www.amazon.com/MOUNTDOG-Photography-Professional-Continuous-Advertising/dp/B07G32T189) (fancy option)
* A camera that can shoot at least 1080p ([Here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D93Z89W/) is an old but decent one, there are much cheaper options if you dive into the world of ebay and such.)
* A tripod with a boom arm, like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0745BDN91/)

Obviously, you don't need any of the extra stuff just to start out, but it's nice to have a direction in case you want to upgrade at some point."
povertyfinance,fnv04x5,t3_g3xdvk,1587276011.0,"Kinda depends on what you'd consider designer. If you mean, like, a $3,000 brand new Gucci coat, then that is almost certainly from using credit cards.

But there's ways to look stylish. Secondhand stores are really amazing. You can find incredible things by thrifting, but even online, there's sites like [Grailed](https://www.grailed.com/), [Vestiaire Collective](https://us.vestiairecollective.com/), [Depop](https://www.depop.com/), [TheRealReal](https://www.therealreal.com/), and [Poshmark](https://poshmark.com/feed) which all offer deeply discounted designer brands. Then you have discount sites like [Yoox](https://www.yoox.com/us/men), [The Outnet](https://www.theoutnet.com/en-us/), [Nordstrom Rack](https://www.nordstromrack.com/), and [Saks off 5th](https://www.saksoff5th.com/Entry.jsp). And of course, there's discounts from the brands themselves, which is where subreddits like /r/frugalmalefashion and /r/frugalfemalefashion come in handy.

I think the main thing is also realizing you don't need new things to be fashionable. You don't even need designer clothing to look fashionable. It's more about fit and understanding basic principles like silhouette and color. The best thing you can do is take stock of what you already have and see what holes you have in your wardrobe. Start a mood board (Pinterest is very helpful) and look at photos of people you aspire to dress like. Then use that to start hunting on secondhand sites. You will need some money to spend, but it doesn't have to break the bank."

techtheatre,fnqroh8,t3_g36g76,1587170746.0,"I think it's unlikely to happen. Pretty much every summerstock gig I've heard of has been cancelled for the season. I only know of one friend who still hasn't heard anything, and I suspect that she'll eventually get the bad news as well.

It's a really difficult situation, all around. No one knows when we'll open back up again, especially without a vaccine. However it seems highly unlikely we'll have any shows going up until at least September, if not longer. We will almost certainly be the last industry to reopen, because our work doesn't really mesh with socially distant policies.

I know this sucks. I'm worried, every person I know in theatre is worried. We're all trying to adjust to this really dire, unexpected event. But I have faith that we can bounce back, improvise, and weather this storm."
AppleWhatShouldIBuy,fnqpyxm,t3_g3bsnu,1587169681.0,"Although it's not as good as seeing the devices in person, you do own a decent point of reference - the Surface Pro 4. The Pro 4 is 12.3 inches, making it just a bit smaller than the 12.9 iPad Pro. You can also see photos of the size difference [in this article](https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/tablet-pcs/ipad-pro-vs-surface-pro-3625513/). Meanwhile, you can see a photo of the 11 inch and 12.9 inch iPads compared [here](https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/12/09/decision-time-choosing-between-the-11-inch-versus-the-129-inch-ipad-pros).

What I'd say is ask yourself this - how do you feel about the size of your Surface Pro? Is that something you would feel comfortable to use laying in bed? If not, then you might want to go with the 11 inch. And if you think you could deal with a little more real estate, then go for the 12.9. 

I think it's also a question of what's more important to you - portability or usefulness as a second screen? You'll likely have to make a compromise depending on what your primary use is."
UCI,fnoug28,t3_g2ysji,1587133810.0,"The stores have been really stocked up ever since they started instituting purchase limits. I went pretty early on when they'd just instituted purchase limits and they pretty much always had fresh produce - no one was really hoarding it because it spoils quickly. The next time I went, it was much better aside from canned foods and bread. I'm sure it's even better now.

Whatever the case, I would highly encourage you to go get food. You're gonna get sick if you eat only ramen and there will be much healthier food you can buy.

Also, make sure to have a mask or some kind of face covering, they won't let you inside if you don't have that."
UCI,fnn0npo,t1_fnlxqok,1587081920.0,"So, Verano and Palo are graduate only, and I believe Campus Village will be grad only next year. But ACC is a mixed bag. I assume they would prioritize putting grads together, but that might be something to ask the individual housing office.

UCI,fnlnv7c,t3_g2hiq6,1587056709.0,"So you can find a few photos of Verano on their [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/veranoplacehous/boards/). I'm not sure if Palo has anything similar. However, there's a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/270677446855302/) and you could probably reach out to the admins and see if they might be willing to help with photos or further information. From my own experience living in Verano but with friends in Palo, I'd say Palo isn't that dissimilar to Verano, but a bit more updated. Campus Village is on another side of campus, it's by the Science library. It's pretty cheap, but the accommodations seemed a bit more dorm-y to me. 

I don't know a ton about the ACC apartments. I know many (all?) of them are fully furnished, and they tend to be more expensive. They're all farther away from campus, so a bit annoying if you want to walk."

I love horror movies and I thought it could be an interesting one, so I went and saw it when it was still in theaters. Something about the sound design in particular really triggered an anxiety response in me. I actually got about 3/4ths of the way through the movie, got partway through the barn sex scene, and then noped out of the theatre.

I've never left a movie theater before. I usually stick it out, because at least I can munch of popcorn and chill, even if it's bad. But I really don't regret leaving that movie."

ArtistLounge,fmuobkj,t3_fx9m88,1586395397.0,"There are a ton of YouTube videos of people who got accepted into art schools. I would highly advise watching them if you're lacking direction. One thing to note, however, is that different schools have different preferences. So you might want to pick out some schools you prefer and just search ""CalArts Accepted Portfolio"" or something like that. Here's a few to get you started:

* [Meppity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LrHE6zcq7I)
* [Scribble Diary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPNPMv6rSlE)

* [Korunai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjQvoKE87PE)
* [Michelle Tang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMlzZXq3KSc)

General things that are common:

* Life drawing, proving that you have foundational skills
* Character turnarounds
* Character designs and illustrations
* Storyboards
* Basic Animations

My honest advice is to listen to the YouTube videos of people explaining their process. Then, think about your own process and what you want to do with your career. Use that to guide your portfolio.

Also, as a side note, sketchbook pieces generally are not encouraged. Maybe one or two if they're really great, but you really want to have full, standalone renderings. Some programs also require you to submit a sketchbook, which is where you'd show that work."
