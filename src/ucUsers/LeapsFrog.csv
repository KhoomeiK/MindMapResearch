You're invited to my new group 'ECON 134A' on GroupMe. Click here to join: https://groupme.com/join_group/59058621/DEEVKGVF"
UCSantaBarbara,fo4vieu,t3_g5pgbl,1587512035.0,I never thought ECON 134A would make us all landlords. The trickiest part is finding a building with the proper specifications.
UCSantaBarbara,fnm3tkf,t3_g2cmt2,1587064609.0,"I would agree with you, but SCORE is not on the ballot this year. The closet thing is Queer Commission currently.

Honestly, with coronavirus going on student fees for stuff off the ballot should be reevaluated as those organizations will likely be spending less."
UCSantaBarbara,fnjp98i,t3_g25xmg,1587003850.0,"I would run on cutting student fees and getting rid of organizations that only exist to waste student fees and circlejerk each other. Unfortunately, that is not appealing to the AS establishment and is hard to turn into a good campaign message."
UCSantaBarbara,fngik5s,t3_g1mknb,1586933358.0,I believe W 120A is online while 120A isnâ€™t. However that difference does not really matter that much anymore.
UCSantaBarbara,fnc0tx7,t3_g0ujfb,1586826248.0,Have you ever tried changing the system from the inside? Imagine if you won and attempted to fix the cultural problems within AS.

Here you go! Contains statements from each candidate.

You also have a vote on if you want 2 seats in the AS Senate exclusively for international students, and if you want more funding for WORMS."
UCSantaBarbara,fn5sc95,t3_fzr7eb,1586674215.0,This year it is actually the only way they can even contact you. They will probably do it more this year.
