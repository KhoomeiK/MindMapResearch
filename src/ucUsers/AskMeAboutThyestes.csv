UCSantaBarbara,fpg40br,t3_gcyhlo,1588593558.0,I'd go with KAMAP or undergrad uni apartments if you have these options.
UCSantaBarbara,fpg3vnl,t1_fpftu79,1588593444.0,"Yikes, if you have to go through all these precautions might as well not rent from them at all. I had good experiences from KAMAP. Undergrad apartment housing is also reasonable priced (700-800 a month) and come with furnishing which is a big plus."
UCSantaBarbara,fpewn8l,t3_gcyvek,1588556553.0,We should have a wiki in this sub at this point that answers the party school question lol
UCSantaBarbara,fpdf6hm,t3_gclsfh,1588525794.0,You can only retake failed (NP) classes as far as I know.

UCSantaBarbara,fp77t5d,t1_fp74ls2,1588365614.0,"Nah I disagree, there are always plenty of opportunities to make friends with people. It’s college, not high school."
UCSantaBarbara,fp369vb,t3_garvbo,1588273824.0,all for positive energy <3 ty for posting
UCSantaBarbara,foj4zku,t1_foj3g4g,1587808596.0,These copays are very similar if not the same as the prices I paid at student health.
UCSantaBarbara,foj4s4o,t1_fo9jr5f,1587808360.0,Can I ask why Cal wasn’t a good fit for you?
UCSantaBarbara,foj4i40,t1_foicadc,1587808039.0,"I think it’s fine to go to either school with regard to physics, considering how good our physics department is. Look at other factors, LA or Santa Barbara? Urban or beach town? I hope you are considering more aspects than just the major."
UCSantaBarbara,foj4cke,t1_foigsth,1587807865.0,"1. Careers prospects for Econ/accounting, the easiest route, is just getting into a big 4. You are set for 100k within 5 years from there. The caveat with this route it’s extremely competitive. You need a 3.7-3.8 GPA at least, which would make you top 10% within the entire school of Letters and Sciences, and that’s just the GPA aspect. It’s doable and people grind for this route mostly for the stable income/career out of college. 

6. There are quite a few decent Asian places, but none of them are in IV. You’d take bus, drive, or Uber with friends."
UCSantaBarbara,foj3tf5,t1_foiplws,1587807266.0,"Hey there, congrats! Many people go to cal for the name, and I’ve read somewhere that a lot of cal grads expressed the degree has helped advanced their careers in some way, but they didn’t necessarily have an enjoyable undergrad life. UCSB inherently has a laidback culture, and if you trust that your discipline and ambition can get you to where you want to be without the cal degree, then I’d say you’d have a much better time at SB."
UCSantaBarbara,foj1s4x,t1_foj0xj3,1587804962.0,"Im not the one to argue with strangers on the internet anymore, so I’ll give you some genuine talk. I mean I understand there are a lot of peer pressure for guys to “date women, be wanted by women” etc, but that often times result in guys pursuing women too far and not realizing they are making those women uncomfortable. 

I think it’s important to take a step back and look at why “attractive girls” should even be a determining factor for you to go to college. I can for certain tell you it’s not a common reason at all. So did you grow up around a lot of peer pressure? Which led you to think that your experience with the opposite sex is “not enough”? 

I can assure you that if you work on yourself as a capable, respectful, confident person, you will not have trouble finding a partner, or FwB, whatever floats your boat, anywhere.

Also, I might’ve sounded too harsh on a reply to someone else’s comment. You might not have bad intentions and I apologize."
UCSantaBarbara,foj1368,t1_foj09tu,1587804196.0,Glad someone called him out. I cringed the whole way through reading it. If this is not a high effort meme post OP has some serious growing to do. I can’t believe people are giving him serious advice as oppose to calling him out.
UCSantaBarbara,foj0cxu,t3_g7pnt1,1587803410.0,"I really hope this is a meme post. If not, don’t choose SB pls..."
UCSantaBarbara,focjvnp,t1_fo9o888,1587672188.0,"yup, here's a blog post they made https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/05/02/tidy-tuesday-coding-club/"
UCSantaBarbara,fo6183y,t3_g5w2mq,1587542711.0,"Also, there is a coding club on campus, ran by a super nice TA I had. They meet every week and have food there and whatnot. Seems super chill so dm me if you are interested."
UCSantaBarbara,fo614k9,t1_fo60m9f,1587542605.0,"That’s super rough. To be fair UCSB should provide more opportunities for people who want to pick up CS, it shouldn’t be as difficult as it is."
UCSantaBarbara,fo60xnw,t1_fo607rl,1587542403.0,"I just heard that you have to do really well in the pre req classes to have a good chance. They need to be B to B+ minimum, but given how competitive it is, I feel like you need A- to A to have a good shot, just from an outsider perspective."
UCSantaBarbara,fo5z42i,t3_g5whfr,1587540545.0,Good luck!
UCSantaBarbara,fo5vzo7,t3_g5w2mq,1587537500.0,"I’m assuming that you are in Letters of Sciences, and not in engineering, given how you switched from bio. CS is notoriously difficult to get in, because you are essentially trying to get admitted into the engineering school, and it’s fairly popular. Getting into intro CS classes are hard enough, and I’ve heard you have get straight As in them as well as related math classes to be considered. 

Now, these are just my impressions from hearing a lot of things about CS throw around here and there over the years. You should of course get second opinions. But either way I don’t think anyone would tell you it’s easy work to get in the major.

Edit: I don’t want to discourage you from trying out CS, by all means do. Research and learn from online resources. If you really find a passions in it, I’m sure you’ll have a chance in getting into CS."
UCSantaBarbara,fo5063o,t1_fo3yk9i,1587514703.0,"umm I hope that she isn't the only one seeing these complaints. The idea was for there be enough complaints to capture the attention of student health and for them to take action.  Someone commented above with another eye clinic in Goleta that they had good experiences with, and they accept Gaucho insurance, so you can check them out if you don't want to go back to the eye clinic. 

I think I might take one for the team and email an upper management at student health, so that if they weren't seeing the complaints before, they'll look into them now. I didn't plan on going back to the eye clinic anyway. 

And Yeah I got an ""non apology"" from nichols as well, she seems like one of those people that never grew up and matured emotionally."
UCSantaBarbara,fo3zer4,t1_fo2b3zg,1587495558.0,"Thank you for sharing! I think it's important to know that we have other options. The clinic you mentioned does accept Blue Cross Anthem, which is the insurance under Gaucho Insurance, but I'm not sure what the co-pay looks like."
UCSantaBarbara,fo0yy8g,t1_fny2pxc,1587422440.0,"it wasn't a stupid question at all, patients have to right to ask any questions necessary, and it's fucked for her to ridicule you for it."
UCSantaBarbara,fo0ypci,t1_fnyfi3r,1587422301.0,it's so fucked that she repeatedly verbally abused students/patients to tears. I dmed you the complaint link!
UCSantaBarbara,fo0l9b9,t3_g4ztrf,1587415156.0,"Getting a high paying job with any major will always depend on the person. Comm is not a hardcore academic route, so getting a high GPA and pushing yourself hard in classes won't necessarily secure good career prospects. It seems to me like one of those majors where your career will very much depend on the projects you do outside of classes and networking."
todayilearned,fnykneh,t1_fnws24a,1587366060.0,Same here! I’ve watched it 5-6 times and every time I’ve discovered something new.
UCSantaBarbara,fnxmnf9,t1_fnxk025,1587341841.0,"Agreed that someone like her shouldn’t be in health care. I managed to find a complaint link in my email, so anyone who needs it can dm me."
UCSantaBarbara,fnxmk66,t1_fnxk38h,1587341786.0,I’m really sorry about your experience :( good thing so many of us are how filing complaints against her.
UCSantaBarbara,fnx0js2,t3_g4elb0,1587329109.0,"You can pretty much pretend the party rep doesn't exist. Yes, you have the option to party hard if you'd like, and there are plenty of opportunities to do that. There are also tons of things to do in downtown and on campus, none of which has anything to do with party culture. 

I will say tho as someone who also loves cities, SB def doesn't have the metropolis vibe that SF or Tokyo has. But it's still gorgeous and plenty of very nice folks, and I don't at all regret coming here."
UCSantaBarbara,fnwyeav,t3_g4echn,1587327891.0,"I made the eye clinic post, which was auto removed for something minor, but I made another one. Sucks that you had a poor experience at another department. Student health seems to exploit the fact that students have very limited health care at SB, therefore no need to provide good service."
UCSantaBarbara,fnwjzhj,t3_g43hvv,1587319835.0,"my post was automatically removed because the official complaint link was a survey format, and surveys aren't allowed, I will dm everyone the link instead"
UCSantaBarbara,fnwif0x,t1_fnvabxe,1587318971.0,"I’m sorry you had the same experience as well. I managed to find the link to file a complaint and put it in my original post, I encourage you to do so!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnwi5k3,t1_fnv7dk6,1587318828.0,"The complaint link is not available on student health, but I managed to find it in my email. I put it in my original post!"
UCSantaBarbara,fnwi1mw,t1_fnv721n,1587318768.0,"Actually I just looked on the website and couldn’t find a link, but I found one in my email which I just put it in my original post"
UCSantaBarbara,fnv7etq,t1_fnv70vd,1587282827.0,"Very similar situation as yours really, extremely impatient and condescending"
UCSantaBarbara,fnv7dxx,t1_fnv721n,1587282802.0,"You should be able to find it if you poke around their website, I haven’t used it in a while"
UCSantaBarbara,fnv6oax,t1_fnv6knx,1587282089.0,I think you can do it on the student health website. I got so mad after my appointment that I logged a complain right away haha.
UCSantaBarbara,fnv64xw,t1_fnv5y1m,1587281566.0,Yup her! Same crappy attitudes from her as well. Really sucks that people like her are exploiting students b/c most wont complain.
UCSantaBarbara,fnrminq,t3_g3j2xh,1587193775.0,"In my opinion, it's usually not ideal depend huge life decisions on friends -- people change drastically in college and high school friends drifting apart is fairly common. You can of course go to slo for other reasons, but all your friends going there shouldn't be a major one. People make lots of new friends in college, some for a lifetime, keep an open mind!

As for physics department, UCSB kind of keep theirs a secret, in spite of how renowned it actually is. I haven't heard much about slo's physics end, but maybe they are keeping it lowkey too haha."
UCSantaBarbara,fng6hik,t3_g1bsz3,1586923498.0,"I liked his lectures and found him to be a nice person in general. I disagree with the comment about how his online course policies will be unforgiving, he was very accommodating amid COVID 19 and made the final optional. If you need any help lmk, I got an A in the class."
UCSantaBarbara,fl5p39a,t3_fmoqdz,1584842127.0,Didn’t have to appeal but I’m a third year and would love to help :) love seeing someone putting effort to get into a school I appreciate so much. Feel free to dm me.
