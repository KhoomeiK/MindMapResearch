AskReddit,fpiyiii,t3_gdn8w2,1588651794.0,"Them doing everything for me: setting up play-dates, picking clothes, forcing sports or ideas unto them. I hate how much I recede into conformity in their presence, when I've tried so hard to become an independent person"

EscapefromTarkov,foirpgs,t1_fohrepi,1587794862.0,"You'll probably do better than when you first started, but my guy do not expect it to just be easier. Everything is going to be expensive as fuck, and the people who are really good are going to get loaded fast anyway. Just focus on the only factor you can predict, and that is your own skill and knowledge."
dankmemes,fnarvgq,t3_g0gwte,1586802726.0,Yknow if everyone dies then that's pretty bad for the economy
ucr,fn938iw,t3_g0ast7,1586757930.0,"Even before the quarantine, I was pretty much spending everyday in my dorm. I didn't vibe with my roommate, or my building, and I didn't want to join a frat. I've made friends, but no one that I've hung out with on a regular basis. I spent a lot of days alone, been making me miss my hs friends more, makes me doubt if this school has anything for me. I'm not really concerned about parties and drinking as much, I just want a squad I can do whatever with and I haven't found them. In the end I think we just have to keep doin what like doin and staying honest to ourselves, and we'll find the right people with the right experiences, maybe they'll find us. Stay safe during quarantine tho and pick up where you left off once campus opens again."
EscapefromTarkov,fgiyd4r,t1_fghjbw8,1580833476.0,Not much but I'm new and poor so it's pretty frustrating. I'm 400k away from my first junkbox and I probably lost like 200~300k's work of stuff
