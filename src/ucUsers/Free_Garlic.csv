berkeley,fp0xgm4,t3_gam576,1588219131.0,I got a debit card in Bank of the West. They have a store setup next to the bookshop in MLK.
berkeley,fp0i1f9,t3_gakj21,1588209681.0,THANKS REDDIT!
berkeley,fozm25n,t3_ga3wn5,1588192928.0,I got the mean score for the first time in 61A! hahahah I was beyond proud of myself when I saw my score. Baby steps!
berkeley,foxip2l,t3_ga06hh,1588145219.0,"Same! I need it to declare Cog Sci, and it has been the second semester that I can't enroll."
berkeley,foxicsr,t1_fow4ray,1588144911.0,I'm also an international student and I am considering doing the same. Do you know if we will have any problems with the F-1 visa?? Can we simply extend it a semester?
berkeley,foq0n2w,t3_g8pd2u,1587978664.0,"I'm not sure how they did it, but I have a ton of friends who took a gap year before their freshman year. Good luck!"
berkeley,fner24d,t3_g1b704,1586894325.0,"If you want to get access to parties practically every day I would suggest joining greek life. Also if you are looking to surround yourself with like minded individuals try to get a dorm at Clark Kerr. There is also a great bar culture in Berkeley, which include places like Spats, TrippleRock, and Pappys. Between the frats, game days, and bars, I am sure you will be able to party as much as you want to."
berkeley,fnb0jq6,t3_fzqlyv,1586807110.0,"Berkeley is a world class university. It also has a great college culture and party scene. In my opinion there is really no better place to go to college, but Berkeley is not for everyone. There is no hand holding, and it really makes you grow up."
berkeley,fn8vmsa,t1_fn8a4lz,1586751450.0,"All Letters and Science students must complete 7 breath requirements which are 7 classes in different areas. If you are interested in taking even more classes beyond your majors, maybe consider doble majoring in Cognitive Science and Computer Science as they overall better than Psychology and CS."
berkeley,fn89rco,t3_g06i19,1586736916.0,"I honestly don't know much about John Hopkins, but from a biased perspective I just want to address some of your Berkeley cons and encourage you to become a golden bear. Within the college of Letters and Science, there is a real sense of curiosity and exploration. If you stick with one major there is a ton of room to take classes from whichever area your interested in. Berkeley has a great college culture and party scene if you are interested in that too. Lastly adressing the cut through stereotype, people are competitive here in the sense that everybody what's to be the best, but that does not mean that they want to hinder others. Go bears"
berkeley,fn7ufey,t3_fzzj4e,1586727854.0,Maybe consider cognitive science as it overlaps well with Computer Science. Within the cog sci major requirements you could probably take around 4 philosophy classes.
