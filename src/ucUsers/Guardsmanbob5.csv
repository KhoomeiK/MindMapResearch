berkeley,fp4b57o,t3_gb48dk,1588295339.0,They set the denom to 93... that seems way too high.
berkeley,fozonkn,t1_fozmf7r,1588194179.0,"I have never been given a condescending answer... call them out if they do lol. You think they teach 70 because they wanna ridicule us? These are undergraduates just like us, giving them feedback is an amazing way for them to improve their teaching."
berkeley,fozofgj,t1_fozmf7r,1588194069.0,"Look at the piazza post, they cut off like 20 points from the denominator and then curved it to fit the bins. Also, error corrrecting was around 1/3 of the test. Probability and counting made up the other 2/3. With the 20 point cut, seems pretty fair to me. The last question is always gonna be unreasonably hard, but they do the cut off to account for that."
berkeley,fozdjq8,t1_foz54m4,1588188860.0,"Listen, I struggled just as much as you did. Probably grinded 25 hours on some of the psets. The course staffs job is not to give you the answer, often times they did point me in the right direction. As for the midterms, both midterms denominator was cut by a substantial amount. The second midterm was even curved AFTER the cut. Also wth, error correcting was in the scope of the exam???? Besides a few of the first parts of that question was just simple apply crt."
berkeley,foy0hf5,t1_fog5wt3,1588162132.0,"Hi, how would you compare 170/61c to 61b/70 with hilfinger/sahai"
berkeley,foxw829,t1_foxb7r5,1588158400.0,"What would you change about this course. There are no pre reqs because this is like the first step to the discrete realm of math. This is the prereq. That being said, the class offers endless resources to guide you as well as a very dedicated course staff. They will stay after hours and help you if you are confused. This class was touted as one of the hardest. The material isn't for everyone but the tests were very fair and between going to csm, notes, lecture, discussion, office hours, homework with a group, I found the material to eventually all piece together and make sense. This third unit those is really rough, but that may just be to the motivation drain that is quarantine."
berkeley,fovmxak,t1_fnvdu1w,1588104026.0,Where the lectures mandatory? Also how was the workload in the class? Thanks!
berkeley,foplljm,t1_fopeitm,1587964785.0,Did you see the recent Piazza post by 70? The course staff flagged a ton of hws for doing this exact thing and are cracking down hard.
berkeley,fonrghk,t1_fonldur,1587925019.0,"Highly disagree with this one. I came to college to study cs and education and I just cant seem to find the time to put into breadths, when I have hws and projects stacked up. So I default them to pnp/ not trying hard in them. The answer is simple, I will put in effort into classes that I am truly interested/passionate in. 7 breadths is a lot to handle while also juggling a full technical course load."
berkeley,fnwnbda,t1_fnu96d2,1587321670.0,"Trust me, if you are coming for cs, you cannot beat Berkeley. Between the education and location it beats Umich cs in almost every way. It matches up vs almost every other school very well."
berkeley,fnmegwn,t1_fnme1sx,1587069965.0,It is also broken up into 2 parts. Discrete which is like how we can manipulate mathematical problems logically with computation not being the main factor. And probability which still relies heavily on abstract thinking/problem solving but has more of a computation basis.
berkeley,fnme1sx,t1_fnmcv4l,1587069749.0,Think very little computation. More logic/problem solving and applying different techniques to mathematical concepts to formulate cohesive proofs/ways of reaching a mathematical goal.
berkeley,fnkkfds,t1_fmzeikj,1587030449.0,Okay well you can miss a total of roughly 25 for an A and MT1 is by far the easiest. gl
berkeley,fnkcj14,t3_g2a66o,1587022034.0,Seems like you are pretty borderline. 70 is a whole new kind of math so I would play it safe if I were you.
berkeley,fnjgn7d,t3_g24ogf,1586998579.0,Then tell them. Theres nothing to lose
berkeley,fn2nzuv,t1_fmto9uc,1586596290.0,"To be honest, I did most of the past ones and they are on pretty much the same level as this semesters. We have no short answer/true false so there really isnt much difference in difficulty."
berkeley,fn2fzqx,t3_fyy4hf,1586587668.0,Just pray to sahai our lord and savior and all will be well
berkeley,fmz9t4b,t1_fmkhnhm,1586512099.0,Wait have you finished any of the past exams/midterms yet? The class content itself is not extremely challenging but rather the exams are made in a way to really think outside the box.
berkeley,fm7iuln,t3_fte2sd,1585828499.0,F
