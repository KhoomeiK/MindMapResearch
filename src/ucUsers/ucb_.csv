One semester is not worth it. As an older, non traditional student I need the online option, as I'm at higher risk than a typical college student. 

I don't think any of us should have to pay for college, but this is a policy issue, not a UCB issue. If anything, we should be organizing to petition our government to give colleges a bigger bailout so that they can reduce our tuition."

You don't have to get permission to take these; after you've taken them you just submit them to UCB and they should count towards your degree (again, they need to be equivalent)."
berkeley,fp3vn4p,t1_fp3tto0,1588286650.0,"Anyone can enroll in summer classes at Cal, you don't have to be a student there. Since they're being held online this year you won't have to worry about commuting to campus.

berkeley,fp3oahe,t3_gb2dt7,1588282841.0,"Have you looked at the Cognitive Science major at UCB? Very easy to double major with Psych, and you can get a lot of comp sci/coding experience to count towards the major. On top of that, I'm pretty sure there's overlap (could be wrong here) between Cog Sci and the data science major/minor. 

I lived in LA for five years, and have been in the bay area for three, you're welcome to ask me anything as far as what it's like to live in both places. I will say that without a car, you'll be screwed in LA; you'd pretty much just be on campus - which may not be a bad thing. But the opportunities you're talking about - internships, etc - will be difficult to get to if you don't have a car. You won't be able to afford to uber (or maybe you can, but we're talking a lot of money), LA is enormous. I also don't think people realize how much of a time suck traffic is down there."

berkeley,fop9azl,t3_g8p47a,1587955968.0,"I think you're fine; they have record of those classes now, and they passed you through verification. Just be patient with admissions getting back to you - have you e-mailed a bunch of people? I'm sorry you may have mentioned you have; e-mail is the way to get in touch with admissions about this, you'll have everything in writing and I don't think they're using phones much anyway (advising, for example, is all online for current students).  

Do you have a major advisor yet? Asking them would also be a good idea, and they know who to e-mail on your behalf.  Again, ask by e-mail. You can even e-mail the college you were accepted to.  

I'm not sure if you're worried about the 70 credits thing - don't be. I and a few other transfers I know had well over 70 credits when transferring, it's just about which ones they decide to have count towards your degree, it doesn't hurt anything."
berkeley,fooz3za,t1_foowgz4,1587949538.0,"Yes, exactly. This fear tactic of acting like the lockdown will be a forever thing is a myth. By taking necessary action now we avoid this actually becoming a much longer term ordeal."
berkeley,foou8c5,t1_foomx6e,1587946570.0,"This is why we have traffic laws and consequences to protect pedestrians (yes, of course they fail, but they are there). You can see the translation of logic to social distancing, where there are guidelines in place to protect people. 

Widespread testing has been effective in other countries like New Zealand and Australia, ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/world/australia/new-zealand-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/world/australia/new-zealand-coronavirus.html)) who are already ahead of us. You are narrowing this down to it will be this or that, lockdown or no lockdown, vaccine or no vaccine, without acknowledging a larger context: it's our failure on the public health front that is annihilating our economy and quality of life. If we had widespread testing, for example, we could effectively quarantine those who had the virus versus whose who didn't, improving outcomes and making it safe for everyone to reintegrate with society."
berkeley,foot59x,t1_fooor81,1587945913.0,"I don't know, I don't think lives are worth livelihoods, period. Unemployment exists; and after all, this is all temporary. A vaccine will be developed with time, things will eventually change (EDIT: also, this has to do with our failure and accessibility of testing; if testing were truly available to everyone, we would't need to wait for a vaccine). This article is jumping the gun, IMO. I'd rather private institutions go bankrupt than lives be carelessly lost; I'm not asking anyone to agree with me, it comes down to what you value. I don't see how, for example, campus staff being paid to be on campus just to get sick and possibly die later makes sense."
berkeley,fooiyml,t1_fooc9qw,1587939889.0,"I'm really tired of this false equivalency: 

Driving is a personal choice people make at their own risk, and yes, somewhat at the risk of others - but other people who are driving are also making this choice to be at risk of an accident. By not social distancing, you are endangering people who did not make the choice of risking to get sick or not (i.e if a student has parents at home and carries the virus that then infects them)."
berkeley,foo5jm0,t3_g8jx0d,1587932922.0,"Campuses will not crumble if students don't return to class. Higher education will just change for a temporary period of time, which educational institutions are afraid of because it threatens their financial profit.  We *can* send students home if a deadly pandemic is going on - it would be neglect **not to**.

If there aren't enough tests for people in public how will enough tests be available for students? Even after the shelter in place, even today, students are not getting tested.

This article is a joke. It's disgusting the president of Brown University would rather put students at risk for the sake of attempting normalcy in a very not normal time than keep students safe by keeping them at home. EDIT: It also doesn't surprise me that she's a professor of economics, not public health."

berkeley,foglsib,t1_fog72bt,1587754230.0,"It's funny, I'm psych major on the waitlist for a CogSci class. You would think the departments would just split the reserved seating in both dept. courses given the massive overlap. 

Psychology classes usually expand in number slowly, so keep your eye on it, literally every day. Check it morning and night. This just happened with Psych 125, where my friend couldn't even get on the waitlist, and then the next day they opened up more seats. If you can get on the waitlist THEN STAY THERE, because they usually keep expanding the seats until the beginning of the semester, so if you're on the waitlist now you should be good. It just takes a lot of patience, but invest now."

Online format isn't ideal but putting myself at risk when it could be risk free (ie online) is far worse."
