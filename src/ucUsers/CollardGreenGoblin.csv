GrowingMarijuana,fpm5rg1,t1_fpjyc2p,1588726131.0,"Not gonna get anywhere near as much light even if it’s a south facing wall (best case scenario), but it should be doable. The sides of the buds directly against the wall will likely be less developed, may show some yellowing, and will be more susceptible to mold and mildew, and possibly pests, but if there’s a bit of spacing these problems should be minimized.

Your biggest problem is going to be the thieves — they’re not going to forget your spot, and may tell others, so you really need to consider how you’re going to deter them. I’d suggest a very obviously placed camera or two, motion activated lights (careful with placement so they don’t point at the flowers), motion activated sprinkler system,  possibly some kind of trip-wire system that makes a bunch of noise.

You could get a cheap wireless camera that sends you alerts it detects movement. But be careful — these are lawbreakers, may be carrying weapons, and may be pissed enough to screw you over if you thwart their attempts (calling police of you, sabotaging your grow, telling more people, exposing you publicly, etc). 

Might be best to not grow outdoors in the same spot, or set up a less accessible grow area."

vegan,fpm4dil,t3_ge9kva,1588725316.0,"My thoughts on it are that sadly bees get screwed no matter what — and frankly the treatment bees are subjected to to produce products like avocados, almonds, etc seems worse than the treatment related to honey production.

Bee colonies are transported around the country to pollinate crops often also including apples, plums, cherries, alfalfa, blueberries, watermelon, cantaloupe, cucumbers, pumpkin, lettuces, squash and tangerines, and live pretty sad lives.

They are shipped around in trucks, which disrupts their light and feeding schedules, expose them to all kinds of car emissions, and the queens have their wings clipped to prevent them from moving the colony.

This of course doesn’t justify our exploitation of them for honey production, nor does it make honey vegan friendly — but it does mean that you, in all likelihood, are already living off of numerous products of bee exploitation no matter what you’re eating. 

Do with that what you will."

CBDhempBuds,fowyndp,t3_g9x6lq,1588130002.0,"I switched to CBD/hemp at the beginning of the year and have been very happy with the results. I still enjoy smoking, still get a nice feeling (especially after my tolerance dropped after a few weeks off of the normal stuff), but still feel awake, alert, and have a much easier time getting up and doing things — and honestly I feel like my moods are much better regulated than before I stopped smoking normal weed (less irritability, less frustration, less anxiety, less depression).

I had trouble sleeping at first, but once my tolerance went down the hemp helps me sleep just as well as normal weed used to — except I wake up more alert, and have an easier time waking up.

Your dreams will be weird and intense as shit for a month, and irritability and other negative feelings are pretty normal for a month or two from what I’ve heard — but that seems less common if you replace weed with hemp/cbd, as opposed to stopping everything.

Edit: I know someone who used weed for chronic pain, and switched to hemp a few years ago, and is also very happy with it, and still use it a lot to help with pain, to good effect."

Don’t get me wrong — you can get a decent return and quality off that, and it’ll only run you around $20 per month plus initial investment. 

tbh my experience is a little outdated: My 2nd setup used a 200W CFL, but I still wasn’t self sufficient so I ended up jumping to a 500W MH/HPS after only 2 more grows. 14 years ago the market for grow equipment wasn’t so great, so I paid $250 for my CFL setup lol. Being a low budget high schooler I regretted not just spending another grow with my original low power setup then going straight to the MH/HPS setup from there.

Didn’t realize you could cop that same 200W setup for like $80 now tho lol. Shit done changed...

I think grass city has some good saved threads that have good advice for new growers, but honestly a lot of places make it more complicated than it needs to be for your first time.  

There’s a lot of benefits to just doing a casual first grow and experimenting a bit before you invest in a whole system, but it also depends on how much of a rush you’re in to get quality and quantity."

OaklandAthletics,fnydvxk,t3_g4j8bv,1587360239.0,"July 22 2016. It was a summer Friday night game, and to make things even more interesting, it was Bark at the Park (I.e. bring-your-dogs-to-baseball night). Between seeing dogs being held up around the stadium during the Lion King theme song, to hearing the entire stadium ringing with howls during the 7th inning stretch, it was already a night to remember. 

Extra innings are something I’ve always relished, and spending it cuddled with my pooch next to my fiancé made it all the more perfect, but somehow the best was yet to come. 

By the bottom of the 13th inning much of the crowd had already left, but you wouldn’t know it by how loud the stadium was. With Ryon Healy on second, Coco Crisp walked up to the plate... He knocked a grounded single past in between Tampa Bay’s Third and SS, and into left field as Healy took off — anybody who wasn’t already standing jumped to their feet, and watched as Healy made it to home plate — the stadium erupted with cheers!

Coco of course got a pie to the face for the walk off, fans were in the one of the best moods I’ve ever seen, and the few hundred dogs that were still in the stadium were beyond excited for the ride home.

It was almost 4 years ago but it still feels like yesterday. I hope I never forget that night, and never forget that feeling :)"

I already break nugs up into very small pieces, spread them evenly, and remove all stems, and that did help a lot. Going slower also made a big difference, but I was still getting small blowouts most of the time even at less than 2000 lbs per square inch. Thanks for the tips though. 

I wonder if the bigger volumes you’re pressing result in less pressure/square inch, or if you just have higher quality bags than I’m working with."

rosin,fn7s6ol,t1_fn7gbri,1586726554.0,Thanks! And yeah that’s exactly what game me the idea for this
rosin,fn7s3yr,t1_fn7on69,1586726511.0,How so?
rosin,fn7s0kj,t1_fn7ecp3,1586726457.0,"Yeah I was worried about that, but I’ve pulled the bags off of two pucks now and neither had any noticeable rosin trapped on them so somehow it doesn’t seem to have much of an affect of that"
rosin,fn7rrtv,t1_fn7641n,1586726321.0,"That was my biggest hesitation about this method, but I’ve pulled the bags off of two of the pucks and there was essentially nothing left on them — so it doesn’t seem to trap much at all somehow"

rosin,fn7qqri,t1_fn6lvr6,1586725722.0,"Ah, yeah forgot to mention that, I prepress it by hand to pack the material so the bag can fold over, and I recently I’ve been doing a warmup at minimal pressure for about 1 minute."
rosin,fn7qemb,t1_fn6ei3u,1586725526.0,"Thanks, sounds awesome!

Yeah, I figured the problem was either excess pressure or cheap bags — the pucks end up being slightly over 2” in diameter when squished, giving them an area of more than 3 square inches, so at 6,000 lbs pressure, so that’s less than 2,000 lbs/square inch, which I didn’t think was too much. 

For higher quality material I don’t always max out the pressure, and the results look a lot paler and is far more waxy, I’ve just been pressing some older stuff recently.

I’ll have to experiment a bit more with pressure —Thanks for the tips!"
rosin,fn7q4rs,t1_fn6jwjp,1586725370.0,"Nice hope it works well for you!

And lol yea, I’ve been pressuring some old bud recently and it’s the same deal."
