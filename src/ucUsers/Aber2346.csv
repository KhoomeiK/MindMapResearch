UCSD,fpmu54m,t3_ge8wrl,1588741799.0,I've also heard cse 5a is pretty easy
UCSD,fph11qk,t3_gd7ihn,1588613077.0,"Have you considered a program like oMSCS? It's a fully accredited masters in computer science from Georgia tech and it's considerably cheaper than UCSD. That's what I'm in and I did my undergrad at UCSD and I work as an engineer full time. I know people who have done their Ms while working and it's a big time commitment it'll take many years, but if you want to get involved with research to get a feel of a PhD an on campus masters might serve you better."
UCSD,fpeihjd,t1_fpduw48,1588548192.0,"Check assist.org, I think physics 125/126 at Mesa/Miramar should cover physics 1"
UCSD,fom7rno,t1_fom3m6q,1587880816.0,"Okay, if anything else comes up message us and we'll review it."
UCSD,fom1yju,t3_g85j38,1587876109.0,Actually we have a filter on Zoom links to prevent trolls from entering lectures. Can you message us (the moderators) what you're trying to post? We need a little more information about what you're posting before we can allow it to the sub
UCSD,fom098e,t3_g85g79,1587874837.0,Parking is free right now the last I've heard the machines said no permit required. Don't see anything on the website though
UCSD,foh4kxz,t3_g7aou1,1587760467.0,There's no exams just go over lecture notes for the essays which are online. The book also helps
UCSD,fo8p4jt,t3_g6bdyr,1587600983.0,This post has been removed. You are welcome to move this post to the new student megathread!
cscareerquestions,fo7yeey,t3_g66g7g,1587586680.0,I got work as a software engineer with a degree in Math/CS (half math half cs) so it's definitely doable to get into the industry with a minor. In fact someone at my work has a bachelors in business and got hired on as a QA so having projects and interviewing well will be important.
UCSD,fo70fzv,t1_fo4h8fn,1587570055.0,Unfortunately your comment has been removed due to the presence of a zoom link
UCSD,fnzodai,t3_g4n42m,1587397855.0,Please post in the new student megathread pinned to the subreddit
UCSD,fnnaz2w,t3_g2oap0,1587088288.0,"It really depends on ta availability, classes might increase a little since there's no room capacity limits but idk if you'd be saved with 70+ wait-list numbers"
UCSD,fnf8fdx,t3_g182v6,1586903320.0,Well decisions came out for the regular mscs yesterday so I'd imagine decisions are coming out soon. It'll probably be your GPA that's most important but everything matters

UCSD,fn28gm3,t3_fyw5k1,1586580809.0,Did you check Canvas or email the professor?
UCSD,fn0jdsh,t3_fy5s0e,1586543021.0,"Hello there, congrats on your admission to ucsd. Unfortunately this post has been removed as there is a megathread pinned to the front page of the sub. Feel free to repost there"
UCSD,fmx1vjt,t1_fmwui7o,1586456979.0,u/runescapeucsd where are you?
UCSD,fmujp0s,t3_fxfrpn,1586392744.0,Hello there can you move this to the new student megathread? And no you probably will be fine from my understanding of AP tests you just won't get credit for the class
UCSD,fmtfow6,t1_fmt3uyk,1586371927.0,"I was a math-cs major and for the most part my experience was positive however some of the upper division classes can be heavily impacted and it can be hard to enroll in them. You will definitely be able to get your core CS requirements but those upper division AI classes are heavily impacted from what I have seen. Getting done in 4 years is definitely doable as the math cs major is a tad lighter credit wise than the CS major. For grad school you won't be at a major disadvantage since you'd be able to get your core CS requirements in. The big downside for a lot of math cs students is dealing with the upper division math classes, a lot of people I know did not enjoy those, I liked them though. If you decide for a CS degree you'll have a slight advantage if you decide on going into the industry directly instead of grad school, but you can still get in fairly easily with a math cs degree."
UCSD,fmtah70,t3_fxabjb,1586369476.0,Congrats on your admission! Your post has been removed since there is an active megathread for new admits so please repost here: https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/fi9kzn/welcome_new_tritons_please_use_this_megathread_to/
UCSD,fmr7e9k,t3_fwybz5,1586315632.0,Did the answer ask for a decimal? A programmer missed an edge case
UCSD,fmmfwek,t1_fmk6n2z,1586204528.0,I think you probably will be allowed to enroll and take the class but you will not get any credit for the class
UCSD,fmkbukk,t3_fvrv52,1586149982.0,You probably want an iPad with support for an Apple pencil. The app I used for note taking was Microsoft OneNote which was pretty stable for the most part and it's available on iOS
