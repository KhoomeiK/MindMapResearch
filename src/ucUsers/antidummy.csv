UCSD,fpanr3k,t1_fpa9rt9,1588451968.0,"Personally, more theoretical stuff is good for research and grad school, but as I and the other reply said, it’s up to your personal preference what you want to study in undergrad (the more practical applications of coding in Data Science or theoretical math at UCLA) since both schools are great for grad school. Now I can’t speak for UCLA but courses like DSC 40A at UCSD are great theoretical math classes, so you wont be losing out on the theoretical side here"
UCSD,fp99gu4,t1_foz2xl3,1588419352.0,Fellow DSC major!
UCSD,fp999kb,t1_fp1hie6,1588419146.0,"Both options would be good for grad school in my opinion. I just looked at UCLA data theory, and it’s under the Department of Statistics and looks to be purely theoretical math and statistics (I def may be wrong). Data Science here applies a lot more coding for industrial applications and is a good balance between programming and math. It’s purely up to preference which track you would prefer, although I am biased towards UCSD Data Science as UCLA Data Theory is pretty new and anything CS/stem related at UCSD I think is just as good if not better than UCLA."
UCSD,fp98tyo,t1_fp2r970,1588418695.0,"I was in your shoes, UCR for Computer Science BS/MS with Chancellors Scholarship and Honors, and UCSD. I ultimately chose UCSD because I felt the vibes and location there better, and also valued the prestige and the perceived greater educational opportunities which came with it. But in hindsight, UCR would have been a better choice for grad school for the reasons you’ve listed (I didn’t think I wanted to do grad school when I sir’ed here, but I do now at least lol).

The priority registration at UCR would be heavenly plus the lack of any tuition costs would honestly edge it out over UCSD, but I don’t regret my decision to come here honestly cuz I’ve had such a blast. I personally think either choice would give you great benefits, just weigh out your options and priorities regarding grad school. Pm me if u have any questions"
UCSD,fp98932,t1_fp4tb3u,1588418086.0,"as a fellow DSC major, I didn’t giggle but i rather solemnly grieved in your pain. You should talk to DSC advising as well if you haven’t because they’re really nice, and I hope that everything goes well for you. If worst comes to worst and you have to reapply to transfer back in, then you will have to take three courses, Math 20C Math 18 and DSC 10 and you will be admitted if you have a high enough gpa. Pm me if u have any more questions and best of luck"

UCSD,fou1k90,t1_fom7mq1,1588073503.0,"I’m a Data Science major with a minor in Cog Sci so I can attest to this, but those two majors sound quite varied. Cog Sci is pretty neuroscience heavy but the specialization of Machine Learning has some CS/DSC electives that are a part of the major. Stats/Data Science sounds like it’s more purely mathematical statistics and some programming for data analysis. Like the other reply, it really depends on what you’re looking for, and if that’s anything CS/Neuroscience related then I think UCSD has the better program."

UCSD,fnjntd0,t1_fnjlygt,1587002926.0,I’m taking some classes as a Cog Sci minor and UCSD CogSci is the best considering this school started this major as a field of study.

UCSD,fnij7hs,t1_fnierxv,1586980925.0,"yes, it will save you a lot of stress in the long run to not have to go through the screening process which is really hard"
UCSD,fndbhwy,t1_fnd6dn2,1586865580.0,"No problem! 

Although I feel obliged to give more context into this personal anecdote for better detail. My cousin’s parents (who have no premed experience) preferred Berkeley for the reputation and location. 

But my parents who both have medical experience (mom does business and works with medical professionals in healthcare sector while my Dad went to med school at USC with offers to do research in Ivy Leagues such as Yale and Princeton which he turned down for distance reasons) really emphasize the networking UCSD gives since it has its own med school unlike Berkeley. Granted, my dad’s med school experience was a bajillion years ago so things most likely have changed over time. But he says the most important thing that got him into med school was being on good relations with professors. Heck, he told me he met decent candidates with mediocre stats who got in because the faculty liked them that much. 

Now I don’t know how much this applies today, but it just goes to show you that each school has it’s give and take and you should weigh out the pros and cons and see how you feel. Hope this helps and best of luck deciding!"
UCSD,fnctmxc,t1_fn1s5de,1586846815.0,"Not a premed myself but my cousin was in a similar situation as you as a premed. He ended up going to Berkeley because he was from NorCal and it would be closer to his home, but UCSD has a med school while Berkeley apparently doesn’t (I might be wrong) which was an appealing factor for him to come here for the networking opportunities with the faculty at UCSD’s med school to help his future prospects. You may look to see if UCSD’s undergrads get higher chances of being admitted to UCSD’s med school if you would want to attend here for that as well. I feel the quality of education would be the same at both schools. 

Hope someone in the premed area can answer this better than I, but that’s my two cents hope it helps"
UCSD,fncsidj,t1_fnb5rkg,1586845772.0,"finally a question I can answer. I’ve been doing a lot of extensive research myself on this when I first came into UCSD since this major interested me. The curriculum is mostly neuroscience and neuroanatomy with a decent amount of programming classes embedded in as electives of your choice. The whole notion of the major is that by studying how the brain works in terms of consciousness and sending neural signals to control our actions, you can model that within a computer, hence artificial intelligence. It’s neuroscience heavy, but you do learn some programming and you can obtain a CS minor to make you more employable in the tech industry

PM me if u have more questions"
UCSD,fnc8x7b,t1_fn5t8pr,1586831171.0,"Thank you so much! I wasn’t aware that you can take grad courses as an undergrad. And yeah u read me completely, I personally want a more SWE related role which I feel the CSE courses are more meant for. But I heard one of the DSC 190s is about SWE acc to the HDSI website so I’ll look into that as well."
UCSD,fnc8gev,t1_fnc7269,1586830879.0,"Thank you so much for the insight. I’m only a freshman right now so I have time, but those are still a lot of prerequisites for cse100 and beyond especially when I’m already taking classes like DSC 30. I’m also doing a CogSci minor so there’s some overlap but I want to do more CSE courses. I’ll ask advising to see what’s up"

UCSD,fn60thv,t1_flmrtwi,1586683005.0,"Hey! Just saw your post in the thread but I hope im not too late. I'm a data science major and applying to become one requires you to take 3 screening courses (Math 20C, math18, dsc10). If you want more info feel free to shoot me a pm :)) Im also in sixth as well"
UCSD,fn60mzr,t1_flbmvuy,1586682807.0,"So since Data Science is a capped major, you have to complete screening courses (Math 20C, Math 18, DSC 10). Based off your average GPA in those classes, the department will admit you (higher the GPA, the better). AP creds only help for Math 20C since a 4/5 on Calc BC will let you skip 20A/B.

If you have any questions, feel free to pm me :)

UCSD,fn5t6ig,t1_fn3ylv1,1586675020.0,"Seems to be doable depending on your work ethic! Most people would normally ease in with a GE though so that’s something to consider. 

CAT 1 was pretty easy in my opinion, fairly little work compared to writing sequences of my other friends in different colleges. 

I went into my freshman year taking 20C but my best friend took 20B and from helping him it was definitely a hard class, really heavy on trig properties, integration/differentiation, and series, so I would definitely review those over the summer. 

Can’t say for BILD 1 or CHEM 6A but I’ve heard BILD 1 is memorization heavy while Chem 6A is applying formulas to concepts"
UCSD,fn5sl0v,t1_fn5sivc,1586674446.0,Learn for sure. Although I’ve heard that DSC 30 is essentially the same as CSE 12 so it kinda seems pointless taking redundant classes. A’s would be nice tho 👉👈

UCSD,fn2c1wz,t1_fn2b5pm,1586583934.0,"I can’t speak about the design specialization but I’m trying add CogSci Machine Learning as a double major so I can speak about that. This major focuses on how brains and computers are analogous to one another. A computer itself can be thought of as hardware while performing out programs in the form of software. Similarly, brains are a physical component of our body which control our actions and consciousness. Based of this analogy you can see how the two are related and by studying the brain and how it works you can simulate that in a computer, hence artificial intelligence. You can see the course work online but it’s mainly neuroscience and neuroanatomy with some programming and advanced math for the machine learning aspect.

As for CogSci at UCSD the department is thriving and always progressing, and cognitive science as a study first started at UCSD (you can fact check me on Wikipedia) and many of the professors are super great. It’s no where near forgotten at UCSD and one of our best programs here
