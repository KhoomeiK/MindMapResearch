As an alumni, I encourage students to put an end to their unopposed cycle of raising students’ financial burdens through increased fees.

There may be arguments for funding for this or that. But slapping it onto a low turnout election and not telling anyone about hoping it gets through with no consideration from the student body is a bad look, especially right now."

UCLA's brand and reputation is strong worldwide, Cal might have a slight edge, but that wasn't enough to keep me from picking UCLA due to the million other reasons UCLA is a better place to be + the shitty aspects about Cal. 

Also, UCLA is the #1 public school."
