What's the death rate for under 50 year olds with no comobordities?"

People have the right to assembly

Vulnerable populations can self quarantine

Some will die, unavoidable, part of life. If you're not okay with this you should be on the streets rioting for mandatory double helmet wearing, maximum speed limit 4MPH, alcohol ban, and other silliness

IV is not a demographic at risk, probably better COVID-wise for mass infections to happen now in a contained way so that infections get beaten, people are no longer infectious, people get immunity or immunity like effects in order to reduce far more dangerous spreading (in relative, not absolute terms) to at risk and other places in the future when traffic leaving IV shoots up in 6 weeks

Economic damage far far outweighs impact of COVID in terms of disease damage, even in terms of raw deaths

Same as above for liberties

Same as above for psychosocial effects

Artificially demanding people to stay inside inhibits evolutionary effect of less lethal virus being favored for spread, enabling more lethal strains to be relatively more common

And more

Keep in mind that serious social distancing right now only prolongs COVID. It grows exponentially and we're realistically not going to eradicate it. Gotta pay the debt some time."

UCSantaBarbara,fmk6d3e,t1_fmjqehy,1586145690.0,"Not an expert.

Also not talking about flattening the curve.

Did you intentionally dodge the question? Restated here:

Do you think that social distancing will get us back to normal no-social-distancing sooner?

\>  Social distancing is the only proven effective method seen thus far in other nations.

""proven"" how and ""effective"" for what?"
