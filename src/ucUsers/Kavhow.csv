Too many people think the university has one big bank account they can just slosh money around in, but it's more like tons of smaller companies that make up a whole. You're mad at the wrong group here, they have no control over the recreation fees or anything. That should be directed at those departments. Who again, still need to pay employees and still have large portions of their workforces working remotely."
UCSD,fp86xh6,t1_fp82rcs,1588385071.0,"Yeah I agree with this mostly, but the 10 dollar fee for registration seems to be a bit steep but I don't think it's entirely unwarranted.

Did one of the closet doors still really not close right (left as you walk in)? Did one of the toilets still shake kinda (the one to the right as you walk into the bathroom)? Did you guys find the Wii sensor bar with the wire cut off that my suite hid on top of the exit sign by the backdoor lol 

Also Earth Hall is really nice, I ended up on the 3rd floor of Earth Hall South and loved it. Highly recommend, keep in mind the ""ground"" floor is effectively floor two since the entrances are on the side closer to I house.

Edit: more I think about it the more I think it may have been 103 actually. I'm pretty sure it was 103 because there were 2 triples to the left and 2 triples and a single to the right."
UCSD,fp59uea,t1_fp04z05,1588321404.0,"Average grade in those classes is like around a B/B- (check cape.UCSD.edu once you have your accounts set up), or a 2.7. You need an A/A- average for a 3.8 so you need to do significantly above average in those classes to get in on a school that's academically driven. So it's not a cakewalk for sure."

UCSD,fp59dj9,t1_fp551ge,1588320913.0,Depends. But it would be really really really difficult. Like 20 units every quarter and like 8 each summer session. Look at the required courses and four year plans and try to plan it out. More than 16 units is a lot for one normal quarter.

A concert is much better since you don't have that pressure to bring someone, you can just go to enjoy yourself and meet new people. Organizing an event like a dance would be immense given we don't even know how the fall will play out.

But if you really need a car, I think La Jolla Scenic, La Jolla Shores, and Torrey Pines road have some street parking.

UCSD,fnu9si0,t3_g3ygxw,1587257494.0,"Take 20A. 10A and 20A are basically Calc AB (although AB does more integral stuff I think), so unless you want to take a Calc 1 course 3 times definitely don't do 10A. And if your AB score lets you skip 20A, I'd say maybe go right on to 20B even. There's no reason to do 10A at all in your case though.

I mean, go read the description in the course catalog, 10A and 20A are basically the same material (to the point that you get less credit for 20A after 10A), and it's less material than AB: https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html"

I don't like Piazza personally. People will ask questions and delete them after getting the answer, people don't respond, the company is well know to sell student data (although this is questionable for Zoom also). I prefer getting during-lecture clarification.

UCSD,fnq610j,t1_fnq1bv1,1587158351.0,"Podcast rollout would be significantly worse for everyone involved, if there's still a significant portion of people not on campus. Podcast is a specific system that isn't live and is only in lecture halls.

It also would not work at all since podcast is only after the fact, not live, so office hours on it wouldn't work for example. Manually assigning Zoom Pro licenses, the way it used to be, was way too time consuming and made it shittier for everyone, due to massive delays, so a sitewide license really is the only option here that allowed UCSD to get up and running in time for spring. Consider how much time had to go into all of this in the span of a week, sacrifices need to be made. Zoom is the most cost effective option in this market, sadly. UCSD won't spend money it doesn't have to."
UCSD,fnq3yvj,t1_fnpfpsa,1587157230.0,"Yes. Why would the online infrastructure be strong enough during a normal quarter to suddenly pivot entirely online within a span of 2 to 3 weeks? That would be considered a massive waste of money if we were paying millions extra a year to have the capacity to go online at such a quick rate, and in some cases things would be at 10% capacity almost always. As a result, on campus departments are needing to work insane hours to pivot to online and get everything ready. It's a massive undertaking that is costing a lot."
UCSD,fnq3llu,t1_fnpv3ik,1587157031.0,"Yeah, if you look up zoom pricing, zoom pro for Enterprise is 20 bucks a month per person.

And yeah 4 years may be pushing it (almost certainly will be). Start looking into the requirements you need to do this.

Students with the same GPA in the screening courses will be ordered by their overall GPA.

Students will be admitted according to their ranking based on the number of available seats. If there are more students at a given rank than the available seats, random selection will be made from among the students at that rank to fill in the remaining seats""

Are you using the specific Catalina version from Blink? there's two download links, one for pre-Catalina one for post-Catalina. Also, are you using allthruucsd? You need to use two step - allthruucsd for the library"
UCSD,fmy08ai,t1_fmxs47q,1586475390.0,"No one cares what you think politically as long as you're not a dickhead. If you're homophobic or transphobic or anything like that directly to people's faces, hide it or preferably don't come here, as that is a dickhead thing to do. If that doesn't apply to you then you'll be fine. The professors tend to be liberal because academia tends to be at the forefront of progressive movements historically, but this will be true at every university besides like Liberty University. Everyone here is respectful of each other, again provided you're not being a dick about your beliefs. Half my roommates this year were very conservative, and I'm very liberal, and we got along just fine and they never really had any issues will the school's politics."
UCSD,fmubcyp,t1_fmua69q,1586388074.0,"Oh yeah, just double checked the documentation, it actually drops at week 3 not the drop deadline, my mistake. Drops after week 3 are processed whenever Canvas updates, but up until week 3 no Canvas course drops are processed. This was changed like last night, so now it should be processing faster (similar to the way you described, but that's a brand new thing)."
UCSD,fmtu9ae,t1_fmrqllz,1586379111.0,"Actually it's kinda the opposite. Normally it's dropped at the drop deadline, not after a few days. They're actually considering changing it to be sooner though, but they need to make sure they only drop people who dropped through webreg first, not because of fees and stuff."
UCSD,fmt7spk,t1_fmt2wvv,1586368235.0,"Depends on your college. Most colleges have mostly triples for freshman in suites of only other freshman. Seventh College, for example, will be only apartments as it is in the Village, and New Sixth is supposed to have no triples."
UCSD,fmt7hol,t1_fmt5v7o,1586368093.0,"Getting in means you're most likely smart enough. I think as long as your weighted GPA is above a 3 and you get a C in Calc you should be fine. It's tough to stay motivated during times like this, but try your best if possible."
UCSD,fmt6wp1,t3_fx2sg8,1586367830.0,"I'm a second year EE who's taken 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 65, 100, 101, 107, and is currently in 109 and 123. I haven't taken 30 yet and haven't had any issues with any of those courses."
UCSD,fmpu8e0,t1_fmp3ghs,1586287431.0,"Don't know how competitive Summer Engineering Institute is, I think it varies each year. Just put a little bit of effort into the application. The main benefits for when I did it like 2 years ago were it allowed me to get acquainted with the campus and make some friends. I highly recommend it if it's still on campus this summer. If it's not on campus this summer because of covid it really depends on what they do with it but it could still be very helpful."

UCSD,fmm78rx,t1_fmkhptt,1586200076.0,"Also recommend checking whatsmyipaddress.com. Your IPV4 address from the VPN is usually going to start with 137 or 100, but it should be good if it says your location is UCSD."
UCSD,fmkjd3q,t3_fvrv52,1586156950.0,"Not the best choice for most people, but I have a reMarkable and I love it. It's pricey and basically just for notes, but as someone who gets easily distracted having a tablet just for notes, with a nice eink screen, is great for me. They're releasing the second model soon but the first one is still good."
UCSD,fmjyazz,t1_fmjkzz0,1586140213.0,Just flaired u/RainnStorm (added it after his major) and u/MeanTumbleweed6 so they both should be good now!
