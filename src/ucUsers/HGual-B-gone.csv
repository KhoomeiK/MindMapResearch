SDSGrandCross,fpjpgnf,t1_fpjp63i,1588676981.0,"Escanor is okay in crimson at best. In reality he doesn’t beat much of the other damage dealers in crimson and doesn’t provide much except for an okay ignite. 

Don’t think twigo is that much better but r.eli hawk / red nunchuck ban / red demon meli are all much better damage dealers. 

There’s pretty much no reason for escanor to deal more damage than your red demon meli.

Not only does meli have a 30% damage boost + attribute advantage but he also has much better scaling on all of his skills."

So satisfying"
SDSGrandCross,fopf2vc,t1_foooal9,1587959861.0,It's a sad day to see the meta homogenize with each continual release.
awfuleverything,fopcbri,t1_fopc3wk,1587957964.0,"Right but your initial reason for why it's okay is missing some other justification, or otherwise it isn't consistent and that's why I made the comparison.

Regardless, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to change any positions on this, so I'll just keep my opinions to myself and focus my energy into something that can actually help / worthwhile."
awfuleverything,fopbjhg,t1_fopb52b,1587957431.0,"Okay, in that case, why wouldn't we do it to some unknown shmuck that had no family and friends and create a human centipede?"

awfuleverything,fopatfy,t1_fonm52m,1587956950.0,"I mean, if we do believe this is wrong, doesn't mean that there isn't something still wrong just because we don't look at it. I don't think doing that to a beloved house pet for example is really cool, why is this okay to you and not super fucked up? 

Like you repurposed their corpses just to make something that would disgust someone else. I feel like if I had a child that did that, I'd probably freak the fuck out"
