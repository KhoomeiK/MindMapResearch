custommagic,fpds8zd,t1_fpaz1ku,1588533191.0,"Wizards often adds restrictive clauses like this to cards, maybe for newer players so they don’t accidentally get blown out by not understanding more nuanced rules. Don’t really see any benefit to not having the clause."
UCSD,foq1mo4,t3_g8q16g,1587979692.0,"I hate to say it because I enjoy his lectures and i get the sense that he wants to help us as students, but I have to agree on this. The quizzes really push it over the edge for me. Also the way the answers for the multiple choice questions are randomly ordered is completely pointless and makes everything so much more of a pain that it needs to be."
civ5,fo88haq,t3_g6639s,1587591807.0,"As a liberty fan I'm hurt it's in the same tier as piety. Just curious, what's your reasoning for ranking collective rule beneath the right side liberty policies? It's miles better than discipline at least imo."
civ5,fo87q5m,t1_fo7td10,1587591412.0,"I agree, but I think its fair to knock it down a rating or two because of how situational it is"
custommagic,fnszkiz,t1_fnsv59s,1587231786.0,"I don’t think they’re talking about multiplayer format. Unless I’m missing something, In a 1v1 this would pretty safely win the game. +4 bolas, double -3 karn to kill any legendaries, then ultimate bolas for the win?"
civ5,fnjcpc7,t1_fnjbs0p,1586996323.0,"I use enhanced user interface exclusively so I don’t really remember what the original ui looks like, but when you click on demand tribute and hover over it, it shows the amount of points you have towards successfully demanding tribute."
civ5,fnj29ht,t3_g1zj97,1586990612.0,The wording of the ability makes it seem like it doesn’t. I just tested this in game and I saw no bonus towards tributing as mongols.
civ5,fnezurf,t1_fnezc95,1586898858.0,You oughta play some civ iv for some ICS sweetness.
civ5,fneqg9g,t1_fnci73n,1586894016.0,"This! Surprise DOW someone when they spam a bunch of prophets at you. One of the easiest ways to ""generate"" great people to donate."
civ5,fneped3,t1_fneovud,1586893488.0,"My reasoning is that you are basically spamming roads to every city as fast as possible with liberty to get that +1 global happiness for city connections from republic, and in order to maximize number of cities you are getting coliseums and circuses etc. everywhere to eliminate local unhappiness. In general in my liberty games i aim for a city for every 2 global happiness I can secure to stack up on my per city bonuses."
civ5,fneoda6,t1_fneo8xn,1586892954.0,"I'd agree, that's like 5 free expands for a liberty player."
civ5,fneo3e9,t1_fnem2sb,1586892814.0,"yeah its half the building excluding wonders, and the palace is removed, and then they get a free palace in their next biggest city if they have one. Each civ can only have one palace, because the palace determines which city is the capital."
civ5,fneg57i,t1_fned2h0,1586888772.0,"My main concern, especially in 1v1, is that you need to expand out early as tradition, tradition starts of very slow and an early wonder rush slows it down even faster. Sure you can probably secure a Great Library or Artemis with this, but how can that beat a liberty opponent who probably already has a second or even third city out by that point with more on the way? The liberty player will probably have 4 or even 5 cities by the time you plant your first expand.

I can see it on an islands map where expansion is slowed down anyways by needing to get optics, but even then, you are delaying getting food trade routes sent to your capital from a second city."
civ5,fnef520,t3_g0ufqs,1586888262.0,"Pretty cool, I see your reasoning for ivory being as high as it is, although I definitely think salt should be in its own tier. Imo the importance of traits a good lux needs to have should be:

1.Ease of improvement(early tech, no jungle/forest, no fishing)

2.base yields(SALT)

3.consistent bonuses(circus, marble wonder bonus)

4.inconsistent bonuses(religious bonuses)


Speed is king! an early bonus is almost always better than a late bonus. Sure ocean luxuries are great to work once you built boats and lighthouse and everything, but that open hill mining luxury can be improved with almost no diversion from my ideal tech and production paths. Giving me the happiness and production I need to focus growth in my capital or plant some expands earlier, as well as significant gold boosts for trading multiples away. Do the late game tiles warrant the fact that your cities are all behind on growth compared to a faster start? I don't know for sure but I would tend to say no.


You gave the ability to get faith production from beliefs a significant amount of sway on this list. I agree that its powerful if you can get the right beliefs, but there a number of ways you can get screwed over in that regard, even if you rush a shrine. AI runs into a faith CS and happens to have the same lux? AI has high faith flavor? AI has faith UB or UA? AI has a desert? These are bonuses you can't count on, they can be taken before you or converted away in your outer cities. No matter how strong, if you cna't count on something to be good all the time, it deserves to go down a tier or two. Compounding on that, these bonuses don't come until later. For pantheons this is less of an issue, but monasteries come online late late late.

The CS and Indonesia luxes probably shouldn't even be on this list, they just don't work like normal luxuries, and you can't really compare them."
civ5,fneaw39,t3_g18zic,1586886096.0,"Definitely interesting. So to clarify are you taking aristocracy first or right after legalism? If you're taking it first to rush a classical wonder then I would worry about how much that will delay your early expands. And landed elite and monarchy are quite powerful bonuses to facilitate your early growth, taking aristocracy delays getting them. In your experience does the culture boost of the early monument make it so you can get to these policies after aristocracy as fast as you would with the no-monument aristocracy last path?"
civ5,fne83nd,t1_fne4liq,1586884716.0,"But palace's get razed on capture don't they? Unless Peach's castle gets captured, which might be a cool way to balance it."
