I do have some general advice though! Do you think you got rejected by mistake? My counselor said that a top student at my school got rejected from CPP, he made a call and I guess there was some mistake so CPP ended up admitting her. But I know Berkeley is Berkeley, so they might be annoying about it. Any who, it might be useful to talk to a counselor/someone with clout who can attest to your work ethic. 

I think it would be useful to contact the Berkeley Rep assigned to your school! Usually if your school has a transfer center they have the contact info for the rep. Often reps come to visit, since covid some schools are conducting those UC rep appointments through zoom. If you could get on a call with a Cal rep that would be super helpful. 

I’m sure you know most of this but I hope some of it was helpful!

OH and have you considered applying to privates? Most admissions deadlines have passed but I think Columbia GS is still open. If you’re low income I highly recommend bc a) you can get app fee waivers b) you can get a FAT financial aid package. I know Columbia isn’t Berkeley but it’s ranked pretty high and it’s far from SoCal!"
csMajors,fopl28n,t3_g8lnvy,1587964362.0,I know some people who did the Community College to Master’s in CS route. Taking classes at CC might be a good way to preview what you’re getting yourself into before you commit to a Master’s Degree.
TransferStudents,fopkpzo,t3_g8lbn0,1587964097.0,I know there’s a slim chance it’ll make a difference but maybe you can try appealing your Cal decision?
