unpopularopinion,fpl05f4,t1_fpk5p7d,1588704050.0,"Actual feminists acknowledge and work against body-shaming men too.  The prevalence of jokes about men's appearances is closely tied to toxic masculinity and lack of emotional expression. There are a lot of shitty people, including women who call themselves feminists, who see insulting men as some edgy ""girl power"" comeback rather than recognizing their own hypocrisy.  I was like this for a long time and am actively trying to change my own actions and call out others on it. People are working to change this, just try to avoid only bringing it up when body shaming is discussed in regards to women because that is not okay and interrupts other important conversations."

TwoXChromosomes,fpa81fy,t1_fpa7xqc,1588442689.0,Thank you.  Better safe than sorry I guess
TwoXChromosomes,fpa7qwg,t1_fpa7j9s,1588442520.0,Oh yikes idk how people could figure it out but I guess nothing is actually safe
TwoXChromosomes,fpa70iu,t1_fpa5yzf,1588442093.0,Thank you! I appreciate the suggestion
TwoXChromosomes,fpa6yb7,t1_fpa5tgr,1588442058.0,Did you have your face showing? Or did they somehow recognize you without it?
TwoXChromosomes,fpa6vbq,t1_fpa61vq,1588442011.0,"I've been thinking about this actually but I appreciate you bringing it up.  I have definitely thought about my motivation and it seems like kinda a combination of a few things, still trying to nail down what exactly I'm hoping to get.  Right now it's just an urge that I've had for a while but not acted on."
TwoXChromosomes,fpa6m58,t1_fpa69i8,1588441863.0,I only send them to my boyfriend on snapchat so I would get a notification if he saves or screenshots them.  Also I waited until I knew him really well (we had been best friends for a year before we started dating).  Doesn't really change the topic of this post but if it's any reassurance that's good
TwoXChromosomes,fpa5ws0,t1_fpa5ib3,1588441454.0,Yeah this is kind of what I'm afraid of.  I thought that not having my face in them would solve this but I'm not sure. I don't have any tattoos so that definitely couldn't be used but still theres always a chance.
TwoXChromosomes,fpa3uny,t3_gc30sc,1588440263.0,"Go for it! I spent too much time in high school holding myself back to maintain the image I thought others had of me.  If people comment, just be casual and try not to be self-deprecating.  I promise if you hold your head high, it won't be a big deal.  And remember, if you don't like it or don't feel like putting it one some day that's totally okay! This is not an entire new identity so again do what you want rather than what you think will uphold people's expectations.  Enjoy exploring!"

AmItheAsshole,fozdc3y,t3_gafvwi,1588188759.0,YTA I understand that curiosity is powerful and I'm sure many of us would have done the same. But you did break his trust and go against a pretty clear request.
AskReddit,foyu2u2,t3_gac5l1,1588179184.0,'No vanillas only chocolates' (both words pronounced in spanish) telling me I couldn't be near a group during PE in 4th grade.  There were two girls way whiter than me in their group.
AmItheAsshole,foysw39,t3_gac6i6,1588178560.0,"This is abuse and could dangerous to your development.  You are NOT overweight and even if you were, her behavior is unacceptable and that level of caloric restriction might still be dangerous.  You are 18 so if you are willing and able to leave the situation you should.  I know that's easier said than done but she is setting you up for health issues and disordered eating in a very crucial time for your development.  At the very least, find a way to secure your own food source that she does not know about.  Good luck"
NoStupidQuestions,foyp6yl,t3_gac8yk,1588176610.0,"My best guess is that they want surgical masks to be easily removable without touching the body.  Straps behind the head can shift/require adjustment and taking them off requires you to touch your hair.  Behind the ears is usually more comfortable, more stable, and can be removed easily with a tool or without actually touching your face."
AskReddit,foxq81a,t3_ga664u,1588152438.0,"If it makes you feel bad and unappreciated then you should make a change.  Whether that is having a serious conversation with her about the fact that it doesn't feel like a relationship or, if that doesn't work, ending it.  Don't jump to breaking up but also don't spend your time working to maintain a relationship if she isn't doing the same.  It should be mutually beneficial and supportive"
TwoXChromosomes,foxpueq,t3_ga66p2,1588152053.0,It may not need a hospital visit.  Try calling your ob-gyn or general physician and asking if they are accepting appointments or can suggest methods to keep it clean and reduce the inflammation
unpopularopinion,foxomn0,t3_ga5x1x,1588150830.0,"I'm just gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume this comes from a place of misinformation rather than just trying to get people riled up.  Many people either identify with different genders at different times or don't identify with any particularly more than others.  So within the scope of the term ""transgender"" are any genders, including the lack thereof.  A lot of people describe it as a spectrum, so if I identify as a woman I'm all the way at one end, whereas my friend who is genderfluid (he/they) varies from somewhere in the middle to the man side.  Even this is a limited view as many cultures have their own views of gender including non-binary ones.  There are a lot of resources out there if you decide to learn more."
NoStupidQuestions,fov005h,t3_g9nlna,1588093160.0,"I lived in a ""classic triple"" dorm (meaning 3 people in a room with a 5-ft across strip of open floor) for 2 school year (almost bc this year got cut off early).  It really depends on your roommates and what kind of other spaces you have access to, such as lounge areas or floor study rooms.  It can be tough to get alone time I had a pretty shitty roommate situation last year, but if you have good roommates who are willing to communicate and everyone respects everyone else then it isn't too bad.  Feel free to message me if you have a specific question"

makeuptips,fouvph6,t3_g9pinh,1588091185.0,"You already have really nice features so maybe go with a look that minimizes color and just emphasizes your face.  So like warm neutral matte eyeshadows and maybe some soft looking lashes? And then for lips probably a color or even a tint that is one step darker than your lips.  I found this look from Bite beauty that is kinda what I mean

CasualConversation,fnfzask,t3_g1it6k,1586918719.0,"I went under general anaesthesia for the first time a few months ago and I remember nothing.  I was pretty freaked out about complications though, idk if that's what you're concerned about.  It is pretty freaky that you're just unconscious and not forming memories.  I sometimes wonder how we figured out that was possible and how humanity was able to refine the process.  From what I've heard, it's kinda still not fully understood"
mendrawingwomen,fmd1p70,t1_fmcw3b0,1585957387.0,Yah that's true.  Also I'm definitely warring with myself bc it honestly looks super cool and I really like the chunky combat boot that's going on
