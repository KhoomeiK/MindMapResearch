cringe,fp1a0ml,t1_fp19biy,1588228783.0,"i hope u keep in mind although the cows are killed relatively faster (not all the time), they still live a life of depravity, which i would say is objectively worse than what the octopi suffered in this video. Of course, this isnt the suffering olympics, and i think both are fucking horrible but I just think people that are so heated in this comment section should have the same energy when it comes to the regular meat industry"
cringe,fp16me9,t1_fp15eol,1588225873.0,i know... lots of people getting brave as if they dont eat meat or buy from the meat industry. Saying shit like “she should be thrown into a vat of oil!” ok well sharon u had a bacon today so how about u get strung up by your ankles and cut by the throat and drained of your blood
