Taken from Original : Interview with the woman and the full story:
https://youtube.com/watch?v=RsreAFzubXM

Surveillance video shows three armed men breaking into a home.  Two of them were in separate rooms when Chen woke to strange noises inside the house. She grabbed her handgun and went to investigate, after encountering the three thieves she opened fire.

""I didn't have any choice so I had to take out the gun I'd hid there. Then I loaded my pistol and walked out of my bedroom. I shot at the burglars when I saw them. One of them fled quickly, and another one ran away from the front door. Then I shot again, the one inside my home also broke the glass on the back door and ran away,"" said Chen.

The three returned fire and attempted to flee the scene. On their way out, Chen shot one of the burglars and killed him.

Chen was acquitted as her action was justifiable defense, police said.
