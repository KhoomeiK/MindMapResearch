Edit: for anyone that doesn't want to watch through the whole video, this is a written version of what I did. He differs a little bit in the flours he uses but it's the same amounts otherwise.

*Equipment*

- Glass container to ferment in that is big enough to contain it when it rises (1 quart size jars are good). I used a glass tupperware container and removed the gasket from the lid so it wouldn't explode.

- Kitchen scale (this makes life SO much easier as you can get accurate measurements for the water and flour)

- Instant read thermometer, it makes it so you can accurately measure the temperature of the water going in so you don't shock or kill the starter

*Schedule*

Day 1: Weigh your container without the lid and record that in grams. Combine 100g of your flour (he recommends stone-ground dark rye and from watching my housemate's starter I can confirm it makes a massive difference) and 150g of water at ~85 degrees F. Mix together until everything is completely hydrated, cover with a loose lid, and store.

Day 2: Discard all but 70g of yesterday's starter (this is why you weigh the jar, it makes figuring that out much easier). Add 100g of flour and 115g of 85 degrees F water. Stir to combine, cover, and store.

Day 3: Repeat day 2.

Day 4: Same as day 2 and 3, except reduce the water to 100g (so equal to the amount of flour).

Day 5: Repeat day 4.

Day 6: Same as day 4 and 5, except reduce the amount of remaining starter to 50g.

Day 7 onward: Discard all but 20g of the starter. Combine equal parts by weight water and flour, and store. He was able to use his on day 7, I didn't have confidence in mine and let it go an extra few days to make sure it was strong enough. I also usually discard a little less than he recommends and leave behind 30-40g just because.

Once it's past day 7 you can save the discard for making things like crepes, or even give the discard to someone else so they'll have their own starter!"
UCSC,fpe369q,t3_gcxxgk,1588539434.0,"Very happy to have an oven to bake in during this disaster. This is my first time making bread and I'm ecstatic with the results.

I followed Joshua Weissman's guide to [make a starter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTAiDki7AQA) (I used Gold Medal all purpose whole wheat flour instead of stone-ground rye so it wasn't quite as active as his but it still worked fine) and [beginner sourdough guide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eod5cUxAHRM) It took about two weeks altogether; 12 days for the starter to get where I feel like it should be (I started it on April 20th), one day for making and proofing the dough, and one day for baking. It does take a lot of flour unfortunately but last time I was in the Capitola safeway they had restocked, and Food Bin sells EXCELLENT flour for this albeit at a higher price. 

I used [this two-piece cooker](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SQ2QJ1P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for baking which is super convenient for a few reasons. 

1) It stops you from burning your hands when you drop the dough in which can happen in a regular dutch oven.

2) You get a pretty good cast-iron pan and dutch oven in one set that doesn't just have to be used for bread baking (I made vegan schnitzel in the ""lid"" and it worked great).

3) This set comes with some rubber clasps and a hot pad if you don't have a set of oven mitts and a pad already.

Hopefully some other slugs can start baking like this! It's a really therapeutic process and you get something incredible at the end of it."

fantanoforever,fo0utpz,t3_g4v1yq,1587420174.0,"Behemoth - ""O Father, O Satan, O Sun"" is the best closer for a metal album I've ever heard. I don't understand how or why but it actually makes me tear up, something about Nergal's vocal intensity matched with the choir in the background and lyrics makes something incredibly emotional."
