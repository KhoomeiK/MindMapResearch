offmychest,foalk99,t3_g6l79l,1587648698.0,"I hear you. Same here. I’ve always questioned and thought I was gay for a while but I pretty sure I’m bisexual. I have only acted on feelings with people of the opposite gender but people of the same sex do turn me on. I commented in this post my A-ha moment. Maybe the other comments will help you. But anyways yes don’t be afraid of the possibility. I do have an SO and they’ve actually helped me in my sexuality journey and it’s pretty clear I’m bi but doesn’t mean I love my partner any less(opposite gender relationship). Anyways good luck and the end of the day happiness above all.

When their parts have grown completely we cut off the male part and place it over the female plant to fertilize her seeds, we get lots of babies each year. 

The one in your picture is a male."

AskReddit,fo358uc,t3_g50snx,1587480789.0,My boyfriend was always on it and would always talk about things on Reddit. I had no idea what reddit was. When I would tell him about things I saw on the internet or memes my brother showed me from Instagram he would complain that I needed to get reddit and so I did. At first I didn’t see the appeal and now I’m hooked. More than he was. He created a reddit monster!!

AskReddit,fo1vwqk,t3_g561rd,1587442707.0,"I always kidded around about orgys and threesomes with my SO. I thought I was just joking around when I realized maybe I kept bringing it up cuz it wasn’t a joke. It would explain my crushes on some of my friends that were of the same sex and my questioning if the people around me were gay when I was “surely straight”. My SO brought up my orgy idea and suggested maybe it’s time we try it and oh boy was I excited to be able to be with someone of the same sex. Watched some porn and was very turned on. Lots of fantasies as well. After failed planning and much thinking I decided ultimately that we shouldn’t have that orgy and keep the sex between us 2 but I did come to the conclusion that I was in fact bisexual. So long story short, it took a while but yeah here I am:). My SO doesn’t mind it either nor my family surprisingly but I’m pretty sure my fam thought I was joking."

UCI,fnxio76,t1_fnxcuwj,1587339432.0,"Oh same here. Staying on track is very important and get ready for lots of chem and labs. Also I recommend taking Humanities Core and choosing Sharereh Frouzesh as your seminar leader. She’s awesome and HumCore helps you get rid of practically all your GEs and writing classes in one year. It’s a great program and gives you extra room in your schedule in the following years if you need. 

Good luck in general and nothing is more important than your health and happiness!"

UCI,fnx7yyb,t3_g4etca,1587333275.0,"Honestly UCI is alright, what’s your major? I am a first gen and in my experiences the college hasn’t been very helpful or considerate. The way they give classes isn’t that efficient because you end up having to teach yourself everything anyways, but that might be for any college. Just go with your gut and whatever you truly believe will make you happy. 
 I commute and honestly parking is a bitch and permits are expensive. Colleges just wanna drain us students. 
Good luck friend."

I mean we don’t really fight, it’s just bickering. But through communication we figure it out. We forgot why we fell in love in the first place and that’s the troubling part. We never had much in common but how did we make it work so well then? Like even with all the bumps everything has been good. We’ve just hit a weird point in the relationship..."
relationship_advice,fn4d5tw,t1_fmpody3,1586638941.0,"Thats pretty much what my boyfriends family did for me and I honestly admire them and couldn’t be more grateful.

I have insane parents who are very materialistic and while nobody’s parents are perfect I just love the philosophy my bf parents go by. They aren’t materialistic and believe as long as you have love and the people that care about you the most around that’s all you need and they make me feel so loved. My family dynamic is nothing like that and it makes me sad how broken we are. His family is comfortable now but they’ve struggled so much and my parents have had struggles of their own but definitely have been more fortunate financially, which goes to show money isn’t everything.
Me and my bf are currently in a rough patch and it would break my heart to lose not only him but his wonderful family as well."

AskReddit,fmizus0,t3_fvf5s3,1586120217.0,Definitely. Took time to get to that point but it’s really nice to have that comfort with one another. During quarantine we even FaceTime to masterbate to each other sometimes. It was never an agreement just overtime comfort levels increase and one day you’re like “hey do you mind if...” and then it becomes a norm  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ .
