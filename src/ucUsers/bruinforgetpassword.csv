Literally anything that resembles a cohesive argument that contradicts what I argue for makes me happy deep down, I want to go back to school ):"

It's not wrong, it's just covid is a sensitive subject so remaining technical is important, as to avoid letting emotion cloud judgements

Thanks for sharing your points, I didn't consider them. I'm re-evaluating my decisions regarding leasing each day."

For sake of argument though, I've come to find that 'schools' refer to different things within the context of University and K-12, especially to 'schools' Fauci refers to, having his daughter be a school teacher, who had asked him the question.

A relevant quote from the discussion section of this paper (The Impact of School Closure for COVID-19 on the US Healthcare Workforce and the Net Mortality Effects)

>...However, preliminary data on COVID-19 suggests that children are a small fraction of cases and may be less vulnerable than older adults. If these early results hold-up, then the already uncertain transmission reduction benefits from school closures will be reduced relative to influenza..

It seems some other literature investigating school closures and covid also disclude university contexts (School closure and management practices during coronavirus outbreaks including COVID-19: a rapid systematic review) :

&#x200B;

>All articles were triple screened (by SJR, HC, and JP) on title and abstract. We excluded opinion pieces, systematic reviews, studies addressing other viruses, university-specific settings, epidemiological studies not examining intervention effects (eg, of prevalence of infection in schools),

&#x200B;

I guess my point of this comment here is be cautious with what is referred to as 'schools' when probing to see if fall2020 will be happening, as the definition used is entirely different from our interest / hopes to see ucla be open in the fall.

>Apparently UW's Institute of Health Metrics has predicted that the nationwide peak will be reached somewhere between April 10-11

From what I gathered is we're approaching a maximum given the social distancing measures we have in place, if we do this? Given that measures are relaxed after a successful social distancing session, it only pushes back the peak until a vaccine is available ( See Figure 1 in Social distancing strategies for curbing the COVID-19 epidemic), so it would be in our nation's priority to ensure the peak remains flattened, as opposed to lifting measures and getting another flare up.

Yeah, I follow that. I got the definition of an influenza mixed up on the first draft, but I was just mirroring the projected models in treating it as if it were an influenza in modeling. Thanks for bringing it to my attention that I was over-generalizing, although I was cognizant and trying to relate the two, as others have been doing, rather than saying they're equivalent."

In papers regarding the spread of viruses, schools were the first to be recommended to close due to the high spread rate among-st children. Granted schools in the research I looked into for social distancing measures referred to schools as K-12, so university closures weren't a factor \[citation needed, but here's one [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-8-61](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-8-61)\]

>What about how China, SK, etc that have reopened?

This is an interesting question, but the approach the US / UK is adopting in approaching covid19 is a far cry from those two countries stated, and I don't think they should be relevant in an argument regarding our future in covid. To emphasize, the measures taken in those countries aren't comparable to the measures taken in America, and from what I can infer those two stated follow a Suppression Model, while America / UK are following a mitigation model (Imperial College: Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions)."
