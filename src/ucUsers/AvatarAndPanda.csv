ucla,fp8rv3c,t1_fp8rksa,1588400932.0,"Of course! You should be excited! One thing I will tell you and I hope you can follow this advice. Don’t stress over your GPA anymore. You made it here, you are among a lot of smart people. Still try your hardest. But if you end the quarter with a B or something that isn’t an A or A+, don’t waste any time feeling bad for yourself. It’s not worth it. You’re at UCLA! In the long run, you’re going to end up with a job regardless and the GPA won’t matter! Now if you’re thinking about Graduate school or Medical school, maybe put a little more weight on caring, but still. In the end it’s just a number that doesn’t define you."
ucla,fp8rcx5,t3_gc1lwe,1588400468.0,"Engineering is difficult. But that goes for so many things in life. Just because something is difficult doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pursue it, if anything you should want to do it more! Engineering in college is manageable. It is difficult. But you can and will do it as long as you’re committed. Materials Engineering isn’t a big program at UCLA as far as I’m aware, but I do know some people in it. You’ll probably take your first “major course” at the end of your first year - Mat Sci 104. That course usually determines if you really think you’d enjoy your major, from what I’ve been told. Regardless, congrats on your acceptance! You will be okay! I’m a first year Electrical Engineering major, feel free to PM with more questions about anything!"

ucla,fp7noxm,t3_gbs5un,1588374106.0,Are you allowed to be enrolled in UCLA summer sessions if you’re also taking CC classes at the same time? I didn’t think that was okay.
