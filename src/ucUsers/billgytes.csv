worldnews,fp4fyrk,t1_fp3hvwb,1588298213.0,"Huh? We already have high speed internet everywhere. It's 4G. The reason 5G is being pushed is bandwidth. 5G has lower range but higher bandwidth.

The reason companies want 5G is because it lowers their costs. In ""hotspot"" areas where many people use their phones at one time, putting a 5G tower in would be cheaper than the current infrastructure. But we will not be able to coat the entire country in 5G infra, it would be too expensive because of the range. Nor would we want to, it doesn't make sense when we already have 4G coverage in sparsely populated areas.

Why is China leading on 5G? Because their cities are dense and everyone uses mobile phones now.

The amount of conspiracy circling around this thing is absolutely insane. 5G has literally nothing to do with global domination or power and everything to do with companies wanting to make a bit more money by installing cheaper and better-engineered infra. Cellular infra is extremely expensive, that's why there's only a handful of companies able to operate in the space. 

What, exactly, does China have to gain by spying on average US citizens? How does that fit into their evil world plan?"

UCI,fo8ng4r,t1_fo8kvxx,1587600018.0,"Grass is always greener! I'm consistently surprised at how hard exam questions can be. Some profs are sadistic.

My strat is typically to evaluate my performance based on what I think my classmates are capable of. If I'm thinking ""all of my classmates can probably do this problem, I can't because I forgot to study this concept"" then there's a good chance I got it wrong. If I'm thinking ""I felt very confident about my ability and there's no way I could have finished that exam,"" then there's probably a heavy curve.

If you think all (or most) of your classmates can do those 3.5 minute problems in their head in 30 seconds, yeah you may have a problem."
UCI,fo8jz8l,t3_g69d0l,1587598038.0,"I mean, if you had 4 hours and open notes to take an exam written for 1hr/no notes, of course you'll get an A. 

But they write the exam for how it's proctored, so ""open note"" exams are typically longer, trickier, and graded harder. Any exam with a 4 hour time limit is guaranteed awful. The hardest exams I've ever taken were all of them long, open note, calculator allowed, etc."

I, for one, am glad it's DARPA."
surfing,fm2o841,t3_fse00m,1585701633.0,"The reason they don't is pretty simple, and it has nothing to do with risk to surfers.

If they let people surf, there will be pictures posted all over the internet of people surfing. People who are currently stuck in their homes will wonder why can't I go to the beach, or the park, or whatever, if these people can surf?

Because most people don't surf, so they don't really understand the solitary nature of the sport. They do not understand that it's a lot closer to running than it is to gallivanting on the beach. And then they'll break the quarantine, because it's not fair that surfers get to have fun and I don't."
