I believe if you‚Äôve declared your first major, there isn‚Äôt a specific date for when you can declare your second major. Idk if this is for all majors tho so I would recommend emailing the majors department!"
UCSC,fpbd70b,t1_fpa1acc,1588467326.0,I had work study and I was denied :/
UCSC,forjdsj,t1_forj8hu,1588013225.0,Yes it was work study!
UCSC,forjcf5,t1_for5p2i,1588013208.0,Thank you so much!!
UCSC,for4sbn,t1_for4g3n,1588006168.0,"Sorry I‚Äôm pretty unknowledgeable about a lot of this, what does NFP mean? And I‚Äôm trying to look for literally anything because I‚Äôm deadass unemployed not making money but :((("
UCSC,fo0nrf8,t1_fo0n3eh,1587416443.0,"Based on what the article said, yes! Everybody should have an opportunity to receive something bc the universities are required by law to distribute it. I‚Äôm not sure how UCSC is going to do this though,,,, it‚Äôs still in the works. They may ask us to submit applications or they may simply hand it out but who knows ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

My bf goes to CSU Stanislaus and his financial aid department claimed that they‚Äôre still trying to figure out how to handle the situation and they don‚Äôt have a direct timeline for this all so I would assume a lot of universities are also feeling like this as well"
UCSC,fo0fey6,t1_fo0elwk,1587412144.0,This money is basically what the government gave to colleges because they know that majority college students get the stimulus checks because we‚Äôre listed as dependents :/ so the money colleges have to distribute doesn‚Äôt take that into account
UCSC,fnyal6v,t3_g4k3e8,1587357615.0,Genuinely don‚Äôt know why people are coming at you for this lmaoo it was a genuine mistake??
UCSC,fnunkcw,t1_fnumz7l,1587266393.0,I‚Äôm not sure how UCSC is gonna take action yet so look out for updates info sent out by the university!
UCSC,fnufa6m,t1_fnuew8j,1587260748.0,Too bad I guess because it‚Äôs literally implemented into our system???? Sorry that wanting equity gets old??
UCSC,fnuel4r,t1_fnueagc,1587260326.0,Chill lmao I‚Äôm not the one in charge of things. I was simply explaining equality vs equity.
UCSC,fnucmb3,t1_fnuc2a7,1587259172.0,"This could generate an entirely different conversation that I‚Äôm not really trying to get into LMAO but think of it as this: is it truly equal to give, for example, $3,000 to somebody financially well off (let‚Äôs say they have $500,000 saved) the same amount as somebody who isn‚Äôt financially well off (let‚Äôs say they have $1,000 saved)? Like yeah that‚Äôs an equal distribution but it‚Äôs not showing any form of equity because the person who is struggling financially needs that money way more than the person who is well off. Hopefully this makes sense lmao but regardless, I am grateful that we will all be receiving SOME kind of money!"
UCSC,fnu68ui,t1_fnu5zpt,1587255381.0,"You‚Äôre right! But if UCSC decides to distribute based on low-income students as a priority, then they might distribute it unequally giving more money to certain students. But then again, we don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre  distributing yet. Regardless, I understand $500-$1000 isn‚Äôt a crazy amount to give to students but it‚Äôs better to receive something than nothing ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
UCSC,fnu276c,t1_fntz94f,1587253111.0,This was talking about the stimulus checks that the gov was disbursing tho
UCSC,fntwzl6,t1_fntwqo3,1587250205.0,"Genuinely don‚Äôt know, i think UCSC will email us soon-ish letting us know how they‚Äôre going to distribute and handle the situation......hopefully"
UCSC,fnttsa8,t3_g2rdpo,1587248471.0,Hi I‚Äôm taking that class too :-) how do u prefer to work as a study group?
UCSC,fnjbmuk,t1_fnis24t,1586995721.0,Can you post an image of this email??
UCSC,fnbucnm,t1_fnbrw4k,1586822492.0,Hey! I actually got my refund deposited directly into my bank account. They basically sent me back the cost of my single room but minus ~$1200 bc they decided to decrease aid :/ so I was left with a good amount!!

UCSC,fmp5yye,t1_fmp5sng,1586275061.0,Wait what?? Did Traci give all of TF the hours?? We‚Äôve been trying to argue that we need the leave hours but she kept saying that we don‚Äôt qualify :))))
UCSC,fmp5pji,t1_fmp0e7c,1586274921.0,EVA AND NONE OF THE CATERING TEAM IS WANTING TO GIVE US THOSE HOURS AND I DONT FUCKING KNOW WHY??????
UCSC,fmc5cgc,t1_fmc1904,1585939200.0,"I mean ur right, I might as well! One of the reasons she said we don‚Äôt qualify is bc we‚Äôre part of dining which means we‚Äôre ‚Äúessential‚Äù but she knows damn well we aren‚Äôt lmfao. But anyways thank u!"
