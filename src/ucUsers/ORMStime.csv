berkeley,fphx4y3,t3_gdi2nx,1588629436.0,Same situation here. Got a B+ 61a (5pts off from A- ;( )and probabaly B Cs70 now so it’d probabaly be the only chance for A+ in a CS class for me lol. Might as well go for it
berkeley,fpe7ph9,t3_gcwvnt,1588542017.0,Tbh i did better than MT2. I was moving backhome during MT2 and just didnt have time to study ;(

^ the joke was that the class requirement is super vague and highly depends on the professor. Sorry if i came off as mean.

I had prof sahai and people with math54  , or EE16a and EE16b had a big advantage since we had a lot linear algebra and some EE16b concepts heavily emphasized.

But usually other profs dont focus as much on those, so just MATH1A/1B level calc is necessary. But again, sahai took the first 2 lectures telling how if ppl dont have the mathematical maturity to solve questions with no clear answer without pattern matching should not take the class.

I personally just took math1b then CS70 and i probably have a B/B- and i worked super hard. I cried one time bc it seemed hopeless. But if you really want to early declare LnS CS it could be helpful. I definitely love the class bc it expands the mind so much even though its extremely difficult."

berkeley,fo1vga4,t1_fo1l7uy,1587442403.0,"I personally took 61a first sem along w math1b, data8, and R4b and it was intense. However there was a lot of reaources so it was helpful. I dont think being online will decrease the amount of reapurces available. In fact, it migjt be even more helpful bc now you can que up for OH and do other stuff while waiting (instead of going to a crowded room filled with anxious students), ask questions anonymously during class and discussion without fear of being judged, and HW and project parties where a ton of TAs help out kids, and you can just do other work if they’re busy atm!

If you’re really concerned about summer 61a support quality i recommend you make a separate post just about summer 61a and/or search up info on past feeds, message around, etc

Also I think the best thing to do is expect the least bc then any help is wonderful. Its really easy to forget that we’re super privileged to even have a system that helps as many people as possible with this big of a university in such a huge and popular (and usually spooky) major."

berkeley,fnpzqpk,t3_g37mjn,1587154973.0,"10/10 recommend take cs61a for the following reasons

1. cs61a is confusing and challenging but super rewarding and mindblowing

Having a whole summer where you focus on cs61a instead of having to take other challenging tech courses too will allow you to put more time into this class and really explore and do well

2.  you can take cs61b 1st sem freshman year

cs61b basically gets you the basics into what you need to do a CS internship, so this will give you a huge boost over fellow CS ppl to get a freshman summer internship. taking other lowerdiv classes wont help you as much for intenships"
berkeley,fnpxe29,t1_fnpul0a,1587153731.0,"Yes. Honestly I have no idea why the college recommends against taking econ2 and ugba10 first sem. They are super easy and only require 8th grade math. definitely take it early on to see if you like the material. I took math1b, 1st sem, then econ2 rn and math1b was definitely overkill. econ1/2 is just a lot of super-easy pattern matching so you should have no problem."

Coronavirus,fm2uolw,t1_fm2u9ue,1585705832.0,"The problem is many data sources aren’t accurate.

Many countries are under / over reporting data because they’re being super cautious / not cautious enough. That’s the real questions and there’s some good estimates out there but the hard answer is that we aren’t 100% sure.

Even if all countries were honest about the data, the prediction technology may be slightly off as well. This isn’t a satisfactory answer but this is all i know"
