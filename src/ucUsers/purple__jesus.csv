Conservative,fp7755j,t1_fp77230,1588365273.0,OC is Orange County*
Conservative,fp77230,t1_fp75u71,1588365229.0,Not the case! OC is the lone red in a sea of blue. That's a big reason why Newsome targeted OC beaches specifically and let others stay open.
Accounting,fp6fiw3,t1_fp6f6zm,1588351463.0,"Not really sure, prior to the recession they said we weren't going to increase the number of incoming interns/associates bc our group was hitting capacity."
Accounting,fp6eycw,t1_fp6d1h7,1588351183.0,This is the new standard. KPMG is now doing things like this. They offer the sophomore 2 day program and following summer internship at the same time. I'm in an advisory group and they made like 9 offers.  There will probably be an equal amount in the fall for a summer internship tho. So 9 are offered sophomore+summer internship in the spring and probably another 9 are offered a summer internship in the fall. This probably sounds very confusing.

Accounting,fmxg8z9,t1_fmxfand,1586464418.0,"This is working swing shift hours (not ideal) and in the end you work 48 hrs per week, if you're in public acct that's about par for the course. It probably sounds like I'm coming off as a company shill but I think this is saving jobs for lots of employees and helping prevent layoffs or salary reductions."
Accounting,fmxfxt4,t1_fmxfah9,1586464251.0,I've heard the billing rate and it's less than what an associate hourly would cost.  I think the move is purely so people don't get fired.  They are probably doing it at pretty close to at cost when factoring all costs (not just wages).  This is saving a lot of jobs.

Accounting,fmvha6h,t3_fxmn4k,1586416949.0,I knew am associate that transferred to TAS after their first year. Just perform high and network. I really think that's all that matters. She didn't even start her CPA yet. Networking is probably the biggest thing.
