ApplyingToCollege,fpmrq4f,t3_gec3mh,1588739973.0,I appealed Berkeley. Berkeley should release appeal acceptances next Friday and then later release rejections June 1st
ApplyingToCollege,fpmipn2,t1_fpmhu9u,1588733944.0,Which school would that be?
ApplyingToCollege,fpm98mg,t3_geabe0,1588728158.0,"So the average app fee is $75. Now you’re going to apply to 35 schools. So you’re going to spend $2,625 on applying to schools when you’re ultimately going to only pick 1."
ApplyingToCollege,fpkf4sx,t3_gdxq6q,1588693549.0,"Lmao, no don’t say you’re going to get into both. These schools are very unpredictable. I applied to every UC and was ONLY rejected by Berkeley (as a recruited athlete to Berkeley too). I was also wait listed at Cal poly. I’m not saying you won’t get into both, but don’t bet on it."
ApplyingToCollege,fpftm5n,t1_fpft7rq,1588583028.0,"I did. I was recruited to Cal for a sport that they offered no scholarships for. The only benefit was getting an add on to my application. Funny thing is, I didn't get this add on at any other UC, only Berkeley. Yet I was accepted to every other UC (including LA), and only rejected to Cal."
ApplyingToCollege,fpfsfef,t3_gd7r7v,1588581822.0,"It could be worse. You could've been rejected by Cal like me, with a 4.29 and 1480 sat, after being recruited to play a sport there and trying to go there since 3rd grade."
ApplyingToCollege,fpeusco,t3_gd1h9i,1588555387.0,No there isn't.
ApplyingToCollege,fpb8fsd,t1_fpb0yku,1588464334.0,"If that was true then UCI wouldn’t be 60% Asian, or UCLA wouldn’t be 40% Asian. They definitely don’t consider race."
ApplyingToCollege,fp7meow,t1_fp7jrol,1588373388.0,a kid who got into harvard started a website and fired all the people who helped him build it. He also isn't giving credit to those who built the website. Also now this guy is doing shady stuff like threatening to get people rescinded for calling out his website and so on.
ApplyingToCollege,fp6xnrs,t1_fp6vndc,1588360391.0,Thank you so much u/admissionsmom
ApplyingToCollege,fp6oj1n,t1_fp6mb9n,1588355872.0,I want to try and go to community with enough ap credit to transfer in a year. If I have to go for more than a year I don’t want to go.
ArchitecturePorn,fozffla,t3_gag88v,1588189753.0,I took this photo for my AP2D exam. My portfolio was focused around architecture at the tops of buildings.
ApplyingToCollege,foxkyqu,t3_ga5abx,1588147297.0,The only way you could try and make up for it well is by taking a lot of weighted courses (if you’re up to the challenge).
ApplyingToCollege,fox756e,t1_fox5opc,1588135746.0,Basically you would be taking 12 classes at a time to apply in a year. That’s not possible for any human. Also many courses have pre recs.
ApplyingToCollege,fox5mao,t3_ga2ha6,1588134651.0,In order to be able to transfer in one year you would have needed around 25 (semester credit) or more AP credit. I’m sorry but 4 credits will not be enough.
ApplyingToCollege,fox1hvx,t3_ga2691,1588131849.0,UCD med is an insane program
ApplyingToCollege,fovleqm,t1_fovl8e6,1588103296.0,It will only be not as bad if we step up our testing capacity and contact tracing abilities.
ApplyingToCollege,fovlb2o,t1_foviro6,1588103247.0,"Sure it provides a worse education, but what is worse? Losing your 70 year old tenured professor to this pandemic, or putting ur classes online? They understood from the beginning that this virus is lethal and that is why universities shut down weeks before most high schools did."
ApplyingToCollege,fovkz6m,t1_fovjfzh,1588103085.0,I’m gonna go with Dr. Fauci if he says “I am 100% convinced there will be coronavirus in the fall.” He is saying this because pandemics always come in waves.
ApplyingToCollege,fovhafq,t1_fovgboo,1588101303.0,"Not universities. Every university just showed the world that it is entirely possible for their students to be educated via online platform. High school and other lower systems don’t have this luxury because not everyone has internet or a computer.  If universities have this luxury to maintain social distancing measures and not spread the virus, why wouldn’t they use it."
ApplyingToCollege,fovg7to,t3_g9t35a,1588100785.0,If ur going law go to which ever school allows u to get a higher gpa. Law school only cares about GPA and not whatever school u went to.
ApplyingToCollege,fovg2rn,t3_g9t7zf,1588100717.0,I live in Davis and I’ve been walking around UCD as a form of exercise. I bet it’s the same for all UCs. It’s just empty.
ApplyingToCollege,fovfxtq,t3_g9t98f,1588100652.0,"Very low chance we have in person. They can say all they want that they want to have in person, but Fauci just recently said “We are going to have Corona in the fall.” Meaning a second wave in the fall. The first step to mitigating that in the fall is shutting down universities and dormitories."
ApplyingToCollege,fooygnm,t3_g8q0u4,1587949139.0,"Wait if u might have trouble paying for it, go on the transfer route. UCLA and Berkeley are basically equal for ur major, but you could either pay 16k for online courses at Cal (fall is most likely to be online) or 1k for online courses at CC."
berkeley,fokpnke,t1_fokmvz8,1587846557.0,I filed my appeal 2 weeks ago. Hoping for the best!
berkeley,fohug7y,t1_fohtph2,1587772863.0,Thank you so much. I am looking into transfer programs but I do not meet the requirements for TAP
berkeley,fohrwh3,t1_fohrc5t,1587771457.0,Wow! Thank you so much for showing me this! I will definitely look into it.
berkeley,fohnid1,t1_fohkp37,1587768996.0,"I am well aware of the appeal process. In fact, I have already filed my appeal. Unfortunately only 2-3% are approved each year. But who knows, maybe more will be approved this year because of this whole pandemic."
berkeley,fohj166,t1_fohiewo,1587766778.0,"I did get into other UCs that I like, but the only sure way to increase admission rates as a transfer to Cal is to attend CC. My though process is this: if I go to a CC for only one year, I will have spent way less on tuition for online classes but also have increased admission odds."
berkeley,fohhjx2,t1_fohgov1,1587766097.0,"The loss of college experience was the main reason I didn't want to go to CC at first. But from the looks of it, everyone is going to be losing college experience next semester. I luckily have enough AP credit to get me out of a whole year of CC and thus transfer next year; so I guess I will only be missing out on Spring semester, since fall will most likely be online."
ApplyingToCollege,foen0k6,t1_foelhp9,1587708263.0,they took out curve grading this year because it reduces the incentive to cheat.
ApplyingToCollege,fodiwao,t3_g6xguq,1587685253.0,They don’t give need based aid to OOS
ApplyingToCollege,fodispw,t3_g6xguq,1587685218.0,They don’t give need based aid to OOS
ApplyingToCollege,fodca44,t3_g6wydw,1587682878.0,What are u trying to do after college?
ApplyingToCollege,fod9jpj,t3_g6vz57,1587681941.0,"UCI, UCR, and UC Merced have all gone up in rankings significantly in the last few years. Especially UC Merced."
ApplyingToCollege,fod7znp,t3_g6vuzu,1587681416.0,California State Universities are Out of State cheap. Cal Poly Slo and SDSU are both very good CSUs and are around 35k a year I believe for OOS.
ApplyingToCollege,fobcfrj,t3_g6ncty,1587658397.0,I have lived in Davis all my life and am still considering staying here for four more years just because of how great the town is.
ApplyingToCollege,fo95o7h,t3_g6emvp,1587611118.0,It will make it more holistic
ApplyingToCollege,fo8p9tp,t3_g6bv59,1587601068.0,Because they want to prioritize California enrollment. UCs are mainly funded by CA tax dollars and therefore we get the benefit of instate tuition. Basically we get a 70k value education for 30k because we already contributed most of our lives to CA.
ApplyingToCollege,fo8jhut,t1_fo8ih0z,1587597767.0,"I mean.... Berkeley is known for grade deflation. I don’t know much about the other school, so I can’t really comment on your question here."
ApplyingToCollege,fo8idyi,t3_g6bd7q,1587597147.0,"If u want to go to law, Choose the school where u can get a higher GPA. Law school only cares about your gpa and standardized law test scores. They don’t care where you went."
berkeley,fo8bz4k,t3_g6agxp,1587593661.0,Freshman appeals don’t come till mid may (if u don’t hear by then ur basically rejected). Transfer appeals come early June.
ApplyingToCollege,fo8btmk,t3_g69ajx,1587593579.0,Aye bro delete this. Don’t ever post original work online especially this website. People copy work all the time and claim it’s theirs.
ApplyingToCollege,fo7lnxh,t3_g66lcv,1587580451.0,CSU Fullerton announced this about 2 days ago. A few have followed since.
ApplyingToCollege,fo65vro,t1_fo2mzg5,1587547672.0,UCs typically take more appeals when they take more wait lists. UC appeals basically just ask for updates not shared in the original application. So it’s not really a re-evaluation of ur app rather it’s added info that could push u into the admit category.
ApplyingToCollege,fo5ykhl,t3_g5vwk8,1587539993.0,"UCs, CSUs, and Stanford"
ApplyingToCollege,fo5yjak,t3_g5wbny,1587539960.0,"Are you kidding? Berkeley is a great school and all, but a full ride to the school that only trails Berkeley in 1 ranking is a HUGE deal."
berkeley,fo5xokl,t1_fo5lvfz,1587539136.0,CSU Fullerton I think is the only one publicly stating that they're going online this fall. My mother works at CSU Sacramento and they're looking at Hybrid systems or fully online semester.
ApplyingToCollege,fo2kb61,t3_g5cq27,1587465652.0,"I just got rejected as a freshman, but Berkeley remains the dream. Hopefully I’ll also get accepted as a transfer. Go bears!"
ApplyingToCollege,fo25slu,t3_g5a1sh,1587450634.0,"So yes as u mentioned they had zero appeal admits last year. HOWEVER, with all the current events and lost money, UCSD and other UCs are expected to approve a lot of appeals and waitlists this cycle."
ApplyingToCollege,fo1v8xi,t1_fo1rywr,1587442266.0,lmao i was recruited athlete and legacy to UC Berkeley but got rejected to L&S. I had a 4.29 and 1480 SAT. I guess my classmates just had way better stats than me.
ApplyingToCollege,fo0wvbi,t3_g51486,1587421284.0,LMAO USC ABOVE UCLA BERKELEY AND STANFORD
ApplyingToCollege,fnxcp78,t3_g4guo7,1587335978.0,"No, I've seen many people get in where they had many faith based ECs or even essays."
ApplyingToCollege,fnx4txg,t3_g4d75m,1587331497.0,"UCSB is one of the best schools In the world for bio. Not only that, but it is also the 5th ranked public uni in the world. My brothers girlfriend went there with your major and is making 90k a year at her first job."
ApplyingToCollege,fnx4hgr,t3_g4e0qb,1587331301.0,UCD is very good for ur major. I have lived in Davis all my life and love the town and campus.
ApplyingToCollege,fnx3zjm,t3_g4flem,1587331030.0,Looking at past threads on here for my certain schools and sometimes CC
berkeley,fnv5fsj,t1_fnv55iv,1587280866.0,I do not believe his email is public. The best way to get in contact with admissions would probably be through your regional admissions officer.
berkeley,fnv53u2,t3_g436lr,1587280548.0,The director of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is Olufemi Ogundele. His name is signed on your admissions letter
ApplyingToCollege,fnuxvke,t1_fnuqmlt,1587274087.0,Appeals have to be heard back from by June 1st. I know Berkeley does a wave of acceptances mid may then rejects everyone on june 1st. I don't know about UCSD.
ApplyingToCollege,fnuoge5,t3_g400y5,1587267024.0,Appeals will not come back until mid may and at the latest june 1st

ApplyingToCollege,fnuifqx,t3_g3zq32,1587262847.0,UCSB has better quality of life and has a great department for your major.
ApplyingToCollege,fnufllj,t3_g3xvbz,1587260957.0,"UCs can only admit up to a certain limit of OOS kids and international kids. However, that being said, school such as Berkeley that usually try to take more in states than required may pull back a little. Berkeley just announced they lost $200 Million last month. Other UCs that just admit the minimum in states will accept the same amount they have in years prior. Good luck"
ApplyingToCollege,fnqyvkv,t3_g36bi3,1587175281.0,Very surprised that some wait list offers came out this early.

ApplyingToCollege,fnnhh2j,t3_g2rssm,1587092472.0,"dont get your hopes up. For other UCs some hope would be warranted, but UCSD did not accept a single appeal last year and they had some of the most appeals out of other UCs. I don't want to be a dick, but just don't get hopes up in the likely hood things don't go your way. However, I wish you the best of luck!"
ApplyingToCollege,fnmxfza,t1_fnmwewu,1587080052.0,Yes they usually award them after the SIR deadline
ApplyingToCollege,fnmxbxd,t3_g2q9re,1587079988.0,"I only know a lot about UC admissions so heres your answer based on UCs.


1. There is space to add classes taken from local CC in the grade section of the application. Pre college summer programs have their own section to be added in, in the EC section.


2. Write about this in your Personal Insight Questions (PIQs) or Additional comments section. The PIQ prompts have been the same for many years now and are unlikely to change due to COVID so look them up now and decide which ones you wanna answer.


3. Yes Hobbies count as an EC. I personally put down my hobbies of playing Piano, rock climbing, and painting. These all go down as ECs in the EC section


For insight, I had a 4.29 and a 1480 SAT. I got in to UCSB UCD UCSD UCSC and wait listed at UCLA and UCI. Many of my ECs were ""hobbies"" so definitely include them"

ApplyingToCollege,fn7obhm,t3_g0238p,1586724329.0,This sounds like the grounds for one. It also might be smart to do one since the fall semester may be canceled so you wouldn’t waste money on online courses you could easily take at a community college for much cheaper.

ApplyingToCollege,fmo8sqi,t3_fwfk41,1586249720.0,Ur chances are prolly pretty high since UCD takes a lot off the waitlist every year
ApplyingToCollege,fmo8nly,t3_fwh2l5,1586249558.0,"I can only answer your first question. The only downside I see is that you will have a harder time making friends since most friend groups have been set by the time you arrive. Other than that, you’re saving shit loads of money for the same education."
