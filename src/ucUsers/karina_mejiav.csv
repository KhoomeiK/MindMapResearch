EntitledBitch,fpm6h7l,t1_fpjsq0f,1588726544.0,People are definitely crazy. When I was around 5 an upstairs neighbor threw her cigarettes down at me when she was done because she didn’t like hearing me playing ball.
UCSantaBarbara,fp7jw8n,t3_gbrkza,1588372007.0,Can you post what the email says?
UCSantaBarbara,foyzuu3,t3_gad7tb,1588182232.0,"I think the majority of people here just really care about their health (not necessarily looks). I’m just an average body type but sometimes even I can feel out of place. No one has ever said anything negative to me, nor looked at me in the wrong ways. So I definitely think it’s just my own mind that’s telling me I don’t fit in. Everyone is very supportive and- unless you join a sorority- you won’t be judged for how you look. I’ve become so much more outdoorsy here that I lost a little of my extra weight naturally. You won’t be body shamed here. Don’t let your own insecurities stop you from coming to such a beautiful campus. Once you make a few friends here, you’ll forget/not care  that you’re not a supermodel lol I hope to see you around campus!"
UCSantaBarbara,foponec,t3_g8si3a,1587967309.0,I really recommend making a Facebook. A LOT of people post looking for roommates and subleasers (myself included). It’s one of the easiest ways for us to get an idea of who might be living with us.
UCSantaBarbara,fnihbcf,t3_g1xv8a,1586979993.0,Yeah I did!
UCSantaBarbara,fmnefds,t3_fwbp6m,1586224191.0,Habit is open till 8pm
UCSantaBarbara,fl449bp,t1_fl42hma,1584805557.0,"Yes, Ucsb is a party school in that there are students who party. If you have no interest in partying, you could go your whole college experience without being involved in the party scene. All the bigger parties are at the frats/certain streets in Isla Vista. I didn’t really go to parties until the end of my second year. Msg me is you want some opinions from someone who also had to decide between UcI and Ucsb"
