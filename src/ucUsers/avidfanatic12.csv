berkeley,fp4c1xe,t1_fp48oel,1588295869.0,Yes bc it's all discrete math and no probability
berkeley,foyy0m7,t3_g9vxb0,1588181282.0,Hi Nick. Do you advise OOS and International students who pay upwards of 23k each semester to take the Fall semester off? Is it worth postponing graduation?

berkeley,foof7jk,t3_g8ltxi,1587937876.0,[PlexTech](http://plextech.berkeley.edu) will still be recruiting for a remote fall semester I think.
berkeley,folyicj,t1_folr6uq,1587873571.0,You know you're in English major when you use semicolons for purposes other than Java
berkeley,fnlzg3a,t3_g2asxm,1587062424.0,There's a great remote learning job for CS/Math that I can refer you to. It starts pay around 20/hr and you set your own schedule. DM me if you're interested.
csMajors,fn422py,t3_fzdbhj,1586632482.0,I'm a student at Berkeley. I absolutely love it here. We have professors that are known around the world. It's very gratifying to be mentored by a world-class talent.

berkeley,fn20cwe,t1_fn1xuwz,1586574555.0,"Yeah I feel the same way. I'm from Texas and many people think UT Austin would've been the better choice. At the end of the day, it's just a choice of which college fits you best."
berkeley,fn1pk2x,t3_fyol3h,1586567147.0,Oh damn the fact that you're Berkeley Law changes everything
berkeley,fmwwgf1,t3_fxvc95,1586454245.0,Yes its very easy to switch to L&S. Hard the other way around.
csMajors,fmo252s,t3_fwf6oo,1586242627.0,"As a Berkeley student, I would recommend just learning it by yourself through Udemy. 61a teaches you how to think about Computer Science more than just Python itself (which can be learned in just a few days)"
