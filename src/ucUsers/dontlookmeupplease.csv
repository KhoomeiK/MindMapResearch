To everyone’s credit, it is possible to learn and ultimately be a developer or some type of tech job, but it’s going to be a huuuuuuge upward climb. Software development doesn’t require much math (you really aren’t going to be using calculus, linear algebra, etc) but it does require you to problem solve and think programmatically. Problem solving is the foundation of math and the fact that you can’t solve a polynomial linear equation means you are going to struggle significantly.

There are many alternative career paths that aren’t math oriented and will still make you more money than 31k and requires fewer time than what you would need to commit in trying to go into tech. You could be an office administrator/manager, a paralegal, executive assistant, book keeper (contrary to what you might think, there is very little complex math in accounting), etc. Heck even working at a grocery store there are opportunities to advance and make a decent wage (e.g. work hard and be promoted to supervisor and then manager and move up).

I’m just being a realist. OP is 40 and has demonstrated the she doesn’t even comprehend pre-Algebra (that’s 7th grade math). You’re going to have to invest YEARS worth of time before you see any return on investment. Encouraging OP to advance from 7th grade math to taking a boot camp on web development is setting her up for failure, unless you’re willing to see this as a 5+ year plan or longer. Which like I said, given the time commitment is not necessarily worth the ROI. There are other options."

And it really is. I don't know where you go to school, but I enjoyed my college experience because:

1. I was surrounded by really intellectual people who were really passionate about their studies and it was enjoyable to have a discussion about history, poli sci, literature, creative writing, engineering projects with these people.
2. I was surrounded by people my age who generally have the same overall interests and life goals as me. It's really hard to find this environment once you leave college.
3. My friends lived next to me and I could hang out with them whenever, wherever. Now my friends live in different cities and different states. Instead of seeing each other every other day, we now see each other annually or bi-annually.
4. My life is now structured 9 - 6 PM sitting at a desk where my only free time is the limited hours I have on a weeknight and weekend. In college, it felt like I had all the free time in the world. Yes, I had classes and I needed to study, but I could choose my schedule.

I'm just solely against BUYING a plain A24 shirt cause it looks like corporate swag that doesn't represent the actual thing you like and it feels like you are just doing advertisement for a corporate entity.

I'm not saying you can't buy apparel to rep something you like, e.g., a university sweatshirt for your alma mater or your favorite sports team in the context of show your allegiance in the face of competition.

Some Americans who are not educated in geopolitics interpret this as ""All Chinese people = bad, virus people"" and as a result now think its okay to harass anyone who looks Chinese because Chinese people are the reason for this plaque and suffering against them.

You have to realize people aren't calling this the Chinese Government Virus, they're calling it the Chinese People Virus, which is what is inferred by the phrase Chinese Virus.

Your point about Ebola doesn't have the same parallels because Black people don't have the perpetual foreigner stigma as Asians. Blacks have been a part of American history since the beginning of the nation, so as a result, when you see a Black person, you don't automatically assume he/she is a foreigner from Africa.

However, Asians comprise a much smaller percentage of the US, and while there are Asians that have been in the US since the 1800s (e.g., Chinese during California Gold Rush), most Asians didn't come to this country until the middle to late 1900s, and even then, their populations are really only concentrated in a handful of states and cities (e.g., SF, NYC, LA). To this day, I still have people ask me where I'm really from, in spite of the fact that my accent is as American as any native local.

Also to your last point, I agree, the point of branding it this way is not about racism at all. As I pointed out, it was Trump's move to retaliate against China for instigating that the US was the one who brought the virus to Wuhan (a crazy accusation). However, it just so happens that a byproduct of this moniker is people will naturally racialize it make it a medium for justifying actions against Asians, of which Americans of Asian descent are the unfortunate casualty in this standoff. And I say Asian because most people cannot differentiate Asians apart and rather tend to think all Asians are Chinese."

OMSA,fn7fbif,t3_fzys66,1586719200.0,"As the other guy mentioned, it depends on the course. For the 3 intro courses, the exams were like this:

ISYE 6501: Multiple choice, no coding, 1 cheat sheet double sided (2 cheat sheets on Final). Exams are purely conceptual and tests your knowledge of your understanding of analytical models (e.g., If we change the threshold to XYZ, what happens to the accuracy of this model?)

MGT 8803: Multiple choice, no coding, no cheat sheet, a combination of memorization and being able to solve math problems. Half of the class is memorization (e.g., Financial Accounting, Marketing, Strategy) where you need to memorize frameworks and terminology. The math problems are usually Supply Chain and Finance where you need to be able to solve problems involving discounted cash flows and calculate optimal re-ordering periods and batches.

CSE 6040: Pure coding, open internet/open book/open everything except collaboration or posting questions on Stack Overflow/Slack/Reddit. This is very different from the other 2 courses in the sense you either know it or you don't. You are given several coding problems and have a small window (3-4 hours) to do them. If you solve the problem, you get full credit, and if you can't solve it, you get 0 points. There is no partial credit.

Supposedly some classes do group projects in lieu of exams, and I think that might be the case of DVA, but I haven't taken it yet so I can't say. That class is also suppose to be the most difficult or among the most difficult in the program.

Of the 3 intro courses, I personally felt CSE 6040 was the most difficult, followed by ISYE 6501, and lastly MGT 8803."

OMSA,fmo0c1e,t3_fw6fwl,1586240854.0,"I can't say much about Northwestern, but my experience with OMSA is its a technical degree. If you want to learn some technical skills and want a engineering ""lite"" degree, OMSA is what you want. I think OMSA prepares someone who wants a career in being a Supply Chain Analyst/Industrial Engineer, Data Analyst/Senior Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Engineer, or more technical/advanced Analytics Manager. If your goal isn't to be any of those, I'm not sure I would recommend this degree.

Judging from the fact that you have an MBA, it doesn't seem like this is necessarily the route you want to go. Most MBAs want jobs in strategy and don't actually want to ""do"" the operational work. I feel this degree is to help prep you to do the operational work."
