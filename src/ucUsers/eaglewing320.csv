LosAngelesRams,fojv7ax,t3_g7uieo,1587830068.0,"A few years ago, Nike rebranded Cal’s logo and identity and it was a disaster, a lot like this. They tried to make something new and modern and it was just lame. Then underarmour came in and made logos and type and colors that felt classic and unified, not a huge departure from the old, just a few updates, like making the logo flat and without gradients (as this article discusses) and introducing some secondary things that complement the main logo. And cal fans love the new stuff because it feels familiar but still fresh. I don’t know how to explain what the rams head logo looks like to me other than to say it looks dead. It isn’t moving it isn’t doing anything it doesn’t fuckin have eyes. It’s just dead. Idk I’m rambling but it really is such a bummer how bad these logos are."
