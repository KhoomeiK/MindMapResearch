AmItheAsshole,fpf4sfl,t3_gd3o1b,1588561784.0,NTA. Sounds like she isn't a good friend to you anymore. Friendship should benefit both people involved. Free therapy definitely is draining to the one listening.
AmItheAsshole,fpf4ork,t3_gd3p8p,1588561712.0,YTA. Lily is 14 and she is old enough to hang out with friends without adult supervision. It sounds like the stuff Barbara is telling her is giving her independence and making her realize that you see her as someone who's defining feature is their disability and needs to be watched over.

UCDavis,folurzx,t3_g84sxq,1587870971.0,"That was definitely expected, I think that was why they implemented the new pass/no pass policies. A lot of people around me are struggling a lot. I got luckily and aside from forgetting a few assignments, I think I'm less burnt out because of less in person classes, and so I'm doing alright."
