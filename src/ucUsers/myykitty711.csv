WTF?! You’re definitely NTA. Your boyfriend sounds very selfish and ignorant. He ignores you while you’re going through immense pain of mental diseases and then gets mad at you simply for not responding to his messages? How ridiculous.

Mental health problems are real... I’ve been there and understand that it can be really hard to even look at your phone or get out of bed sometimes :( Hope you’re hanging in there fam, don’t be afraid to seek professional help and if you need someone to talk to feel free to HMU any time ♥️"

If so then definitely NTA. Especially, your Mom seems like the biggest AH in this situation for blindly taking your sister's side, and is probably the reason why your sister is misbehaving like that."
AmItheAsshole,fp9crlo,t3_gc5k22,1588422505.0,"NTA, it's completely valid to feel unwanted / used in this kind of situation.

On the other hand, do you think your best friend could be in a toxic relationship where the guy heavily manipulates her into not contacting you?  Just something to look out for cuz the way you described their relationship makes me pretty concerned."
AmItheAsshole,fp9btmc,t3_gc5eo9,1588421646.0,NAH. Sounds like you do care about your sister's birthday and are just worried about you and your family members' health. Make sure to send your sister some sweet wishes - or maybe Facetime in! It's a different time and I think it will be understandable if you don't go. Stay safe <3

Friends and family can just sit there and chill with some food, maybe sharing their favorite memories of me, while I lie there (dead ofc) enjoying the nice tunes. After that, they can hand - write me some notes and place them inside my coffin. It would be like we are going to a concert together for the last time before sending me off.

AskReddit,fnjmgkk,t3_g1q4by,1587002076.0,"By realizing that I can’t really make him happy, and he would therefore be better off with someone else.

I asked my last crush to be my senior year Homecoming date. He treated me in the nicest way possible, but I could tell he wasn’t really enjoying himself because he didn’t have the light that always shined in his eyes when he saw his friends or felt sincerely happy. Figured that if I couldn’t provide him with that level of happiness, then he definitely deserves someone who could give him more happiness than I could.

Remained a good relationship as acquaintances / friends through graduation, then basically out of touch since college. He probably knew that I liked him, and made an effort to come find me to take a picture together at prom. He was honestly the sweetest guy I knew, but to this date, I’m still glad that I didn’t ask him out and just let him go. Hope he has been doing well."

AskReddit,fn8phkc,t3_g0ach0,1586746970.0,"Not a teacher, but I was once a TA for an SAT class during the summer before starting college.

Most of my quizzes consisted of dictation, and it's really obvious when two students sitting next to each other made the exact same spelling mistake on multiple questions. I can usually tell who cheated off from who, as well.

The ""punishment"" that my instructor enforced for having mistakes on dictation is to have the student write down every word they got wrong, along with their definition, for 4 times. When I catch students cheating, I'll make them do double ""punishment"", and also tend to become less lenient when grading their quizzes. As teachers, we'd rather have students make mistakes and correct it, than having them cheat and gloss over their mistakes. Being caught cheating can really ruin a teacher's trust and respect in you.

EDIT: syntax"

I’ve probably got a little phobia, and the struggle to go anywhere near where I spotted a spider yesterday has been VERY, VERY real.

I basically vacuumed the floor again (Literally just vaccumed on Fri) and sprayed vinegar-water solution around the apartment to repel them. So far haven’t seen it again yet.

Now, time to put on my hoodie and stocking and gloves to go down stairs again..."

EDIT: After seeing other comments, I also agree that OP's sister might have an eating disorder. OP should apologize to their sister, and talk to their parents about possible counseling if the sister's overeating becomes concerning."
AmItheAsshole,fms54ds,t3_fx50ia,1586346865.0,"I feel like it will be ESH, more on your co-workers, and a teeny-tiny bit for you.

Not having kids as of right now is your choice. Your co-workers shouldn't be rubbing that in your face, especially when they already know it makes you cringe.

However at the same time, it's better for you to respect their love for their kids and not say things like ""it's a good time to not have kids at home"". Instead, communicate directly with them that you don't appreciate these messages.

Best of luck!"

AmItheAsshole,fms10o8,t3_fx49hu,1586342848.0,"NTA.

There’s definitely nothing wrong with asking her what’s going on, especially when that friendship meant so much to you, and it sounds like you have been respectful to her wishes.

However, if she clearly tells you to stop messaging her, maybe the best move right now is to give her some space. If she feels like talking again, she will reach back out to you.
Situations like this suck, but I wish the best outcome of this friendship; and don’t blame yourself if it doesn’t work out - you’ve done the right things."
