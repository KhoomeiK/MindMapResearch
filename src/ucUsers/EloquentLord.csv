berkeley,fo9crx4,t3_g6cyr6,1587616038.0,"The whole project makes more sense once you first understand how git works, then you start to figure out what classes and instance variables of those classes you need. Personally, the design document didn't help me at all because it was confusing to think about it without coding. Serialization (persistence) is incredibly important for this project so make sure you understand that. Feel free to message me if you need help."
berkeley,fo5mlgu,t3_g5ti0u,1587529457.0,"Tbh this is the first real project. the others provided us 80% of the code already and told us exactly what to do. This is the first one you have to use your brain on and that seems difficult for a lot of people.

Based on the downvotes I guess people don't want to bother doing really projects. Kind of sad for a university supposedly highly ranked for cs?"
