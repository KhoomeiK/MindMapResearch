I must admit I skipped readings/homework and didn't study sufficiently for more than a few midterms, and my grades reflected that very clearly. The only school-related stress that students have is a result of their study habits! I've found lots of support for each and every one of my classes now that I've made the effort to seek it out. In fact, the amount of resources Berkeley puts into academic support is honestly overwhelming. Just don't get discouraged if you get a C!"
