marvelstudios,ffq4wlk,t3_eujxs0,1580120663.0,"OK, so here's what I'd go with:

Shortest Run:  Avengers, Guardians 1, Civil War, Infinity War, Endgame

Stones Run:  Captain America 1, Avengers, Thor 2, Guardians, Civil War, Dr. Strange, Infinity War, Endgame

Character Run:  Iron Man, Thor, Captain America 1, Avengers, Guardians, Civil War, Dr. Strange, Black Panther, Infinity War, Captain Marvel, Endgame

All of the above are severely lacking.  The next is the list I'd suggest if someone didn't want to watch absolutely everything.

Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Avengers, Winter Soldier, Guardians, Age of Ultron, [All of Phase 3]"
