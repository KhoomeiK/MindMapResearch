CompulsiveSkinPicking,focr195,t1_foauymi,1587674713.0,"What happens if you wear a dress/shorts without shaving your legs? For me, the compulsion went away after I stopped shaving entirely, because it was connected with the need to keep up with the stubble. You might be desensitized to seeing your legs with hair on them after a while.
