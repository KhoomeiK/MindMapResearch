HaloStory,fp8cqst,t1_fp7kqk8,1588389057.0,"I think that's the game's fault though? Halo 4 made it seem like a peaceful world where The Forerunners were the leading species because of how advanced they were and The Mantle was 
that they take care of everyone in a parenting sense and not a dictator sense. I think they ""got along"" with the humans until the flood started to spread. Then Halo 5 and it called The Mantle **enforced** peace throughout the galaxy."

halo,fngg4qp,t1_fngarff,1586931175.0,"Halo 4 was **amazing** and that's why I didn't enjoy Halo 5. Halo 5 on it's own wasn't terrible but as a sequel didn't really make sense. Though my biggest beef with Halo 5 was how much harder they made the enemies, nerfed some weapons, and weapons disappearing after a certain amount of time/moving a little forward in the level. That being said, I agree with you and I will always buy the new Halo games.


In addition to Halo 4, the amount of reading materials released since have been top notch!"

This makes so much more sense now and is pretty cool!
DestinyMemes,fngcdkn,t1_fnfs1y8,1586928010.0,Are there levels pertaining to this though? At the start of the season there was the video that the Cabal have sent the almighty towards Earth. Are there story levels adding to this? Or we just know what‚Äôs happening from the videos?

CruciblePlaybook,fn91v03,t1_fn8agse,1586756683.0,I don't mind that. I dislike shooting a guy consecutively in the head multiple times and them still being able to snipe me. I started playing Halo again and descoping really stops people from just sitting and using a sniper while being shot at. A little hard comparing the games but even on the big maps descoping stops snipers for the most part in Halo.
DestinyTheGame,fn84ryo,t1_fn6tne2,1586733889.0,They also need D1 loot system. Rank up? Cool select which type of gear you want as a reward. 600 iron banner tokens the past 4 iron banners and I never get a complete set of ‚Äúdecent‚Äù armor. But a shit ton of useless weapons in which a majority have poop rolls.
DunderMifflin,fn66l8d,t1_fn60an4,1586689450.0,It really is. Just goes to show what a ~~angel~~  kind person Kevin is. He constantly gets pooped on by his coworkers but still values them and wants to share his chili with him. Warms my heart and breaks my heart that it never happened!

HaloStory,fn1dpb3,t1_fn1cg4k,1586559876.0,"I'm actually hopeful for Infinite. They've had over 5 years to develop the game and they spent about 4 years on Halo 4 and Halo 4 was pretty decent overall. 

I liked the Reach level system, the use of credit made people play the game and you get credit from any activity so you weren't really forced to play a certain activity, though I didn't really like the idea of credits. Halo 4's system wasn't terrible either because it was a free progression based one.

Then again those past systems were because that's how online games in general were. It's all lootboxes nowadays so here's hoping the break the norm and bring back old healthy progression systems that actually reward instead of punish."
sushi,fn1chm5,t1_fn0fmsz,1586559169.0,This. He refused to explain what kind of club he meant. The funny thing is how many upvotes his posts get despite it showing off and kind of hinting at a party/social gathering happening right now?
HaloStory,fn1bye1,t1_fn0sw9u,1586558866.0,"I hate the req system. They said that it won't be in Infinite but if they don't go back to the previous Halo customization system, I will be extremely sad.

I find it crazy that people actually think the req system is even ok. Perhaps for warzone reqs but for armor and customization, absolutely not."
halo,fmtz33f,t1_fmselwk,1586381575.0,"Imagine this, the flood we encountered in the original Halo series weren't even close to what the Forerunners did? The scariest part about the flood the Forerunners encountered was that they could grapple hook you and then it'd be over üò±"

The guy on screen throws the grenade that kills the flood but his partner also threw a grenade that hit an edge on the ceiling causing the grenade to drop in front of them. But it lines up perfectly with the first explosion, so it seems like the grenade came from an enemy lol. This was honestly perfect."
