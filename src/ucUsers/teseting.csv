According to https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200317175442.htm if it was genetically engineered it wouldn't be based on a virus that would infect bats and pangolins and instead based on something known to infect humans. It would also use other genes that are known to increase infectivity

humblebundles,fmvn5hz,t1_fmqmfnx,1586423179.0,"The cheapest Ni No Kuni II has been was during the humble bandai namco build your own bundle 7 months ago where you could get it at $7.65 and the prince editon for $10.20 according to my purchases. you had to buy other items like the other dark souls, teken or soul caliber or cheap throwaway items to get 85% off but it was still realy cheap

I hope you can get a deal like that again. I am still waiting for dark souls remastered and Ni no Kuni Wrath of the White Witch Remastered to be cheap but remastered editions never seem to go on sale."
