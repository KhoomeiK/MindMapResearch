berkeley,fphr861,t1_fphmrz6,1588626329.0,"Yep. Worked at a luxury store in union square last yr, theft is common almost weekly. Thieves steal $1000-1800 jackets and flip them for drugs. Manager and police legally cant do anything because the value is under $2000 for an arrest. Manager said since they changed the theft charge limit to $2000 instead of $1000 crime has shot up on union square"

berkeley,fpe2bty,t1_fpe1pg1,1588538956.0,"Yeah politics isn‚Äôt really a big issue, its just the same group of ~100 cal kids holding the protests every week. Rest of people are mildly into politics as a small thought or are more involved in private such as myself. Im into politics but its not my identity/main talk point."
berkeley,fpe11qa,t1_fpe0ril,1588538231.0,"Damn bro, you‚Äôre top tier for getting the full ride. I got a 9/10 ride so i chose here, pretty cool going to a top uni while only paying like $3k a year, can‚Äôt imagine getting a full ride. Honestly its fun being at a lib school because of the weekly protests, keeps the campus from being quiet/uninteresting"

Cant imagine getting joked by my parents for it being a lib school, would be fun to joke but would get old kinda quick"

personalfinance,foxwvwk,t3_g9ukvf,1588159023.0,I‚Äôd look into financial aid. Age does not disqualify you from receiving aid. Apply for calgrant and pellgrant. Check your calcentral for more information under finance tab. Or call the financial aid office
berkeley,fos73o9,t3_g99nx4,1588025161.0,If you really apply yourself to the class and catch up on materials you can definitely pass. I've been in your situation 2 times now. I got a D on the first midterm and pulled back with straight As for a final A grade. Just organize yourself/make a schedule until your next midterm and pace out the material so you don't stress it. You might not get an A if you choose the A-F grades but you will definitely pass in p/np

berkeley,fohtph2,t3_g7ghw3,1587772457.0,I was in the same situation as you in 2018. I saw all my friends go directly to a university and my dream of going to cal was still #1 for me. I worked hard the 2 years and was accepted. I saved enough through working to get my degree with 0 in debt! Apply to every scholarship and look into TAP
berkeley,fo9qe5f,t3_fyz519,1587627549.0,"from the videos I've seen on their facebook it seems like a good deal for a single unit, they usually sellout once the semester starts(what place doesn't tbh)."
college,fo9k1xf,t1_fo9b3gl,1587621797.0,if you are still taking GEs you could enroll in your local CC online courses and get 2 full semesters(15 units) for \~3k. college classes don't have to be expensive
