ucla,fpbfhmz,t3_gc9dpr,1588468801.0,"Hi several questions as a biochem major

1) What're you tips for doing well in Chem 153B? Is it more chemistry heavy or more biology heavy?

2) What math should I review before taking Chem 110A my first quarter? I am currently taking Calculus 3 right now and it's the highest math I've taken. 

3) Most difficult upper division class for Biochemistry major and why?

4) Just general advice on the major itself, what to expect and to look forward to

and thank you so much for doing this!"
