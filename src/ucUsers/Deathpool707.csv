Also, I kinda imagine we’ll get news on whether classes are online or not in next week or two since registration is coming up.

Lastly Grandmarc is expensive. You’re likely to find cheaper or about the same price apartment. Definitely cheaper house if you’re sharing house."
ucr,fp2d84r,t1_fp1h5e3,1588259725.0,Class revolves around “creating” a fictional but plausible product. You’ll understand when you take the course. The presentation was pitching your product.
ucr,fp17edk,t1_fp09koh,1588226521.0,"Only thing that might be hard to do/or get changed would be the presentation. Everything else was pretty much already done online, anyways so should be relatively easy transition for that course. All my assignments were either done by myself, or contributing to a shared google doc with my group. Only thing that really required in person lecture was the presentation. Even the midterm and final were all done remotely, like normally. (Took it last quarter) So yeah, shouldn’t be much of a change to normal course other than lectures being online."

ucr,fodwesz,t3_g6z0cb,1587691407.0,Yes. Not sure why but it is considered violation of academic integrity.

Not sure if the basic DH cards are ever offered by Zephyrs, that might come later, but even then I think it wouldn’t use the initiate set, as that’s meant to be more powerful to make up for lost time"

hearthstone,fm9xe26,t3_ftz8t7,1585878724.0,"Not enough information to see if you lost your turn. You lost after playing temporus, so you would have had to see if you had three turns afterwards. 

After that it becomes a matter of do devs want. all your turns to happen first or does Temporus shove two turns for your opponent immediately.

I do think it’s intended. Wording of the battlecry implies
an immediate taking two turns."
