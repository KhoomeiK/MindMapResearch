UCSantaBarbara,fph8w2p,t3_gdg9ub,1588617022.0,"I got around a 28/61

Honestly this class isn’t that difficult, it’s way easier and slower paced than I thought it would be, but I just can’t study in this condition. The only reason I’m gonna pass my other classes is because it’s mostly based on assignments. But yeah, studying the amount that you need to study for this class isn’t happening for me this quarter. I don’t blame Mike, and clearly the class is going well enough considering the average was a 70%, so I guess it’s going okay for most people. 

Will probably bomb exam 2 then fill out my withdraw paper. I’m kind of done."
UCSantaBarbara,fpficmf,t1_fpfcafz,1588572138.0,"Ochem classes will count towards the 60 unit UD requirement if you take it at UCSB. But if you take it at cc it won’t count as UD. There are a few majors that ochem does count for UD major units even, like chemistry B.A."
UCSantaBarbara,fpex9kb,t1_fpeu3du,1588556940.0,"Ochem is an UD course but it’s a pre-major requirement for biology majors, not an UD major requirement. So OP doesn’t have to make it up with biology classes, but does need to make sure they get 60 overall UD units to graduate."

UCSantaBarbara,fow7lrf,t3_g9wc6e,1588114497.0,It was very difficult. There were so many questions on the most specific details that aren’t really main focus. I didn’t finish either. But at least it’s probably curved and if many people didn’t finish I’m sure he’ll make it shorter or give us more time for the next one. Ideally he gives us a full day and makes it open book or something.
UCSantaBarbara,fokjaxc,t3_g7kq9m,1587843117.0,"The biopsych major limits you to taking biopsych UD classes almost exclusively. But psychology doesn’t limit you to specific classes and you can take social psych classes, developmental psych, biopsych classes, etc. My biopsych classes have been much harder than my non-biopsych psych classes."
UCSantaBarbara,fo5zq5y,t3_g5wo5i,1587541164.0,Sublease it for a significantly reduced price and try to cut my losses
UCSantaBarbara,fo2jriv,t3_g5aqt8,1587465074.0,"I feel like it’s a lot harder than the mastering chemistry problems, especially because every question has 10 answer choices, it’s impossible to narrow it down. 

I know Lewis has a reddit account so hopefully he’ll see this post. Daddy Lewis please just give us all A’s. Ty."

UCSantaBarbara,fnxet8x,t3_g46rhp,1587337161.0,"I have two 90 minute exams for MCDB110. Its one thing to give us an exam and give a 24 hour limit, but making it timed and treating it like a midterm during the regular quarter? I’ve already accepted that I’m gonna fail this class."
