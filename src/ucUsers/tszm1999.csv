It's weird that you have not gotten any grade back yet because I have gotten all of the discussion grades except for the one that we just submitted. I am also extremely worried about the midterm because I didn't attend lectures lately and only skimmed through the readings. But I haven't got the time to look at the midterm yet because I have other midterms going on..."
