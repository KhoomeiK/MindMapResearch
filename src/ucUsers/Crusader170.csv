The guest speaker talked about how bad smoking is and showed a video of past smokers. One of the smokers on the video was an old man with a hole in his neck.
Idk what makes it so damn funny but the way they talked killed me. Then other speakers came on with holes in their neck which did it for me. A girl turns and says it's not funny."

This movie was about a small town that has a mentally disabled kid in. The people were put off by him and a highschool football team ties him up and lock him away. The coach finds him and changes everyone's attitude. The over all story got to me and really recommend people to watch this and other movies during this quarantine."
