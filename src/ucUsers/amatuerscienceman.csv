Also, I was accepted into UCLA and my parents are pushing for me to go there. I can’t see it, but Is there any reason why I wouldn’t choose SB  for physics? 

Thanks :)"
PhysicsStudents,fobhwqt,t3_g6i5nx,1587659975.0,"I was going into my junior year of MechE being ahead in a couple of upper division classes with mostly A’s. I realized that I hated all my courses, especially the ones where I just pulled values from a table or ran analysis software. 

Then I had an internship under a physics professor and decided I never wanted to do anything practical again (haha). 

With physics, I really enjoy learning about why phenomena exists, rather than just their applications."

I spoke to many officers when I wanted to do NUPOC, and they all told me the same thing. Join the military because you want to be in the military. If you join because you want a masters, be an engineer, be a scientist, it’s not gonna happen( for the jobs) and you’re not gonna have a good time"
