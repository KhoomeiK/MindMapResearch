UCSD,fodv26v,t1_fodowkg,1587690669.0,I think it depends on the school you want to go to. If they're not accepting applications atm you should brush up your resume and apply/volunteer for lab positions/internships to strengthen your future application.  At least that's what I plan to do before applying.
UCSD,fod49ox,t3_g6vn8v,1587679672.0,I am going to apply to grad school instead because there's probably not gonna be many jobs.  I would recommend that too if you have the means.
UCSD,fo9j1e2,t1_fo8ueqs,1587620931.0,"That class was a mess, I knew her sending the rubric a few days AFTER the assignment was posted, it was time to nope out of there.  I am just taking it in summer instead now."
UCSD,fm373l1,t3_fsikz7,1585714604.0,"the class will be about MRIs and fMRIs and she wants to have the class attend the zoom meetings at least for now as she sees how it will work out. Seems like we will be collaborating with group work weekly, reading scientific articles weekly, and doing a final proposal project. Grading is:

journal entries: 40%

Quizzes: 10%

peer discussion: 10%

Final project: 40%"
