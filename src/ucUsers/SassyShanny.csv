StudentNurse,fpm5qg7,t1_fpm5416,1588726116.0,Tbh. Never read the books and I just passed my exit HESI. Their vsims are time consuming and the prepu test bank isnt nearly as comprehensive as it should be. Buy a saunders review book and use their online services.
StudentNurse,fpm0j76,t3_ge6nv6,1588723086.0,Lippincott. How I hate you.
StudentNurse,fp8onm2,t3_gbx2lv,1588398120.0,If the program they are using to Proctor it is ProctorU I understand. Some of my classmates wanted the HESI to be taken in person due to the privacy concerns regarding ProctorU.
StudentNurse,fp6kc0e,t3_gb8y63,1588353817.0,I'll gladly take your grades. I'm getting low B's now. I just want to pass.
StudentNurse,fov0ai0,t1_fouzysw,1588093295.0,I can look through my old powerpoints and send what I got your way? My med surg 1 instructor added a lot of information to her powerpoints. Just send me a message on what topics you need and I can send them  :)
StudentNurse,fouzaue,t3_g9oaq1,1588092837.0,Is this a pathophysiology class? I can send you some of my notes that cover the basics of these conditions if you want?

UCSC,fod8t9t,t3_g6pfkq,1587681702.0,I have to take a test using ProctorU. Theres no other option. How do I make my teachers aware of the situation without sounding like a conspiracy theorist?
StudentNurse,focejkv,t1_foce3i4,1587670398.0,I know for sure mine is using elsevier. Did you use the paid service or do you feel like the free version is sufficient?
StudentNurse,focah7g,t3_g6olf7,1587669017.0,I'm taking mine in a couple of weeks. Out of curiosity what study materials did you use?
thesims,fo9l6ot,t3_g6g2zm,1587622769.0,Only for it all to be derailed because a Townie wants to talk and interrupt their date for the fifth time. Looking at you Johnny Zest.
news,fo9dejj,t1_fo7yy8v,1587616500.0,From what I have read it seems like the Spark app is a decent alternative.
StudentNurse,fo7u1kv,t3_g614fl,1587584542.0,New grad programs arent accepting applications in my area.
unpopularopinion,fo72ub7,t3_g5zbdq,1587571262.0,"I completely disagree with you. Improved graphics help the realism of the game. Spoiler for FFVII: remake incoming so I'll try to be vague. When I played FFVII remake I was shocked by what happened to sector 7. I always knew what Shinra did, but the devastation playing out on my screen was incredibly detailed. It showed how heartless Shinra is and helped the player feel the emotions that the characters were experiencing. The game as a whole is impressive but this part of game really stood out for me and made me forget that I'm playing a video game."
StudentNurse,fo4an3o,t3_g5l48b,1587501058.0,I feel attacked. I will look at those pictures... eventually.
nintendo,fnuuo03,t3_g3ptch,1587271546.0,The last Nintendo product I owned was my DSi. I hope I can play animal crossing with my friends soon.
StudentNurse,fnu9mrq,t3_g3x2tn,1587257398.0,My school wants to do clinicals but no hospitals are willing to accept nursing students. I'm thankful for this because the nurses dont need a student following them and causing more stress. Not to mention the majority of my cohort doesnt have insurance and exposure to the virus is likely.

unpopularopinion,fn7j9bg,t1_fn7hfw3,1586721434.0,"If you wanted to genuinely help people and your administration was actively working against that wouldn't you speak out? They are showing that their administration is not protecting its workers. You wouldn't send a soldier out to fight a war without a bulletproof vest would you? So why is it acceptable to knowingly expose nurses and doctors without PPE? What you are seeing portrayed is the collapse of the healthcare system. Healthcare workers are being exposed, medication supply is dwindling, and we are calling nurses and doctors heros because calling them acceptable casualties isnt inspiring or patriotic. But sure let's call their struggles fake and call it a day."
PS4,fmjk421,t3_fvlspr,1586131928.0,Money to get FFVII with. I need it.
