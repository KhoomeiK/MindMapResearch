berkeley,fphzgnc,t1_foxy3bx,1588630700.0,"Cal has a good art department. The Cal name has weight but like anywhere, internships or jobs are highly dependent on how well you do and your experience. I recommend starting with smaller orgs and working your way up. Campus clubs geared toward your interest will also help you to get 'experience.' The jobs you listed are all quite different and would require different majors/experience to get. I suggest you spend more time exploring these options at Cal before making a decision. :)"
berkeley,fphz1vw,t1_fpdzq1p,1588630474.0,Contact the relevant office or staff person (you can usually find this information on the form/submission page or online). This is good practice for attending berkeley-- people can help you but you need to find the help!
berkeley,fphywv3,t1_fphyoap,1588630397.0,Yes. The .6 adds to your number of units-- this is important for when you graduate. There's a max number of units you can take before graduation. Other than that it doesn't impact much in my experience (alum).
relationships,fp4r2dp,t3_gb31c3,1588305290.0,"Your post reminded me of my brother to the extent I thought maybe you were him. I will tell you from my outside perspective on him that I feel his difficulty in flirting or starting a romantic connection sparks perhaps from insecurity or feeling like he’s not good enough to date, or too old to start dating, and these things become a sort of fear or anxiety and lead to a barrier being put up emotionally, which in turn makes it hard to connect with someone romantically. Don’t worry about flirting— that is different to everyone, and ultimately a lot less important than just having a kind, open conversation where you are asking questions and engaging with her fully. You should also allow yourself to be vulnerable and share about yourself. I think there are a lot of women who will respond to honesty and openness more so than someone who’s great at flirting, especially as you get into your 30s and people look for more serious relationships. It might be helpful to go to therapy to work on opening yourself up to that, getting more comfortable in these situations, and seeing yourself as someone interesting and worthy of love."
AmItheAsshole,fp4p5dn,t3_gaxlzx,1588304012.0,"ESH. Your husband should not have agreed not to circumcise your child to begin with if he had an issue with that, and certainly shouldn’t be debating it 5 hours after birth. But in your post you’re admittedly pretty flippant about the Jewish tradition and this is an important part of that tradition. I am not surprised your husband felt he wanted to do this once he had the baby, and you should take more time to learn about Judaism, which is not just a belief in god but also made up of rituals and tradition, teaching, morals, and an ethnic history."

AmItheAsshole,fo98iyy,t1_fo7vs2a,1587613033.0,"I’m also Jewish and have never heard of a ketubah thought of as a prenup— at all. Rather, the signing of the ketubah to me enhance my “this is for life/no divorce” feeling. Not every ketubah has the same text either."
AmItheAsshole,fo97ywy,t3_g65vmd,1587612658.0,"NAH, because you aren’t AH for wanting to ensure fairness in a worst case scenario. But I agree with your gf, prenups leave a bad taste in my mouth. Even in a case where my partner had a lot more assets than me it signifies to me a lack of trust that 1. We’d stay together (which to me, besides cheating or something extreme, is a necessity when you choose marriage), and 2. I’m somehow greedy or after his money. When you’re raised in a certain type of way this is how it feels: not like a practical agreement but like a betrayal and almost, a guarantee that your partner thinks the marriage is going to end. All that being said, if this is non-negotiable then try to speak to her more about how you just want to ensure fairness, I think ultimately if your intentions with this are pure even if her feelings are hurt she might come to see your side."
relationships,fo96isj,t3_g6elib,1587611688.0,"Sometimes we don’t get the closure we need. In those cases, it’s up to us to move on. It may help you to unfriend or block your ex so you’re not tempted to look. Really, after a while you will feel so much better and different about the situation. Another alternative might be talking to your ex— to catch up or try to get closure on any lingering big issues. You sound like you’re idealizing your ex and this relationship in your head, which is easy to do about someone you no longer see or interact with, so maybe talking with them would help you remember why it didn’t work and realize you don’t have current feelings for them now."
relationships,fo96av5,t3_g6entj,1587611542.0,"I’m sorry. While I can understand your friends and colleagues wanting physical space— we all do and should!— emotionally you deserve their support. The reality is this is a stressful time for everyone and they may be caught up in their own stuff, not realizing that you feel hurt. If I were you I would reach out to a few close, trusted friends and set up a time to talk on the phone, just to catch up. That should help!"
AmItheAsshole,fo5lfvi,t3_g5dqd3,1587528578.0,"YTA, to you it’s just a name you like but to your sister that’s her father in law and to her husband that’s his father who passed away. In many traditions it’s common to honor a beloved relative who passed by naming a child after them when one is born. Let them do that and choose a different name. It’s the better thing to do—it means a lot more to them— and you refusing to see or acknowledge that is not cool. Also, if you name your child Henry and they feel they can’t YOUR Henry will always remind them of your selfish choice at this moment as well as their deceased loved on."
AmItheAsshole,fo1s5y1,t3_g51c9m,1587440247.0,"NAH. You should be able to happily share your news with friends, and you did! She’s also allowed to feel upset or have a reaction even if it’s not the ideal way for her to react. It would have been good to just not mention it and let it blow over."
relationships,fo1pa3d,t3_g56p7q,1587438334.0,"She sounds like a bad person with how she treated you. The more you can recognize and focus on that, instead of remembering the good parts of the relationship or wondering where things went wrong, the better it’ll be. Getting over a first heartbreak is really hard— take care of yourself and give yourself leeway. In time, you’ll come to feel better and see her for who she is, and at that point, the growth area for you will be letting yourself let someone in and choosing someone different. Sending good thoughts!"
TooHotToHandle,fnxlfii,t1_fnwacy3,1587341090.0,I heard it the same way! Also lurked her insta and back in 2016 you can see she has big boobs but they look natural. Then suddenly you see implants.
relationships,fnxk23z,t3_g4hvbf,1587340268.0,"I would feel uncomfortable too. Start by directly saying next time it happens “please stop. I do not like that.” And escalate it if needed. If he continues, sit him and your mom down and say “this makes me very uncomfortable as a teenage girl with a developing body. Please stop touching me inappropriately.” If your parents can’t take this seriously, address this with a trusted adult."
relationships,fnxjmx3,t3_g3ywdf,1587340015.0,"Try to address this with him, kindly and leave it open ended, so he can answer about why he’s doing this. Is it that he’s tired after work and needs quiet to recharge while you want social interaction? Is it that he’s not interested in these topics? Neither of these things have to be relationship enders if you both understand each others’ needs. But you have to communicate to find out what is really happening and to share your own needs. When you move in together these differences in lifestyle and needs become really apparent as you’re together all the time— you see your partner not just when they’re “on” but all the time. If you can work through this together your relationship could get to a stronger and deeper place."
relationships,fnxj8u1,t3_g48fr4,1587339779.0,"You’re 18, that’s really young and certainly too young for a religious conversion for someone else. Many relationships people have at 18 end, no matter how in love they are. I can also say for myself being Jewish, where it’s also important for many to marry another Jew, at 18 I didn’t care as much if my boyfriend was but now in my mid twenties it’s become really important to me— and as a result, I have chosen different people to date. My own thoughts on it evolved over time as I’m sure yours and your girlfriend’s will also. 

I would absolutely continue to move forward with the relationship and see where it goes... if you’re still in love and together and serious into your twenties, that would be the time to consider conversion if you’re willing to do it to marry her. By then you will also have a stronger sense of yourself and know better what you can and can’t do."

relationships,fnnent2,t1_fnna1my,1587090624.0,"Thanks for responding. It’s definitely the case that he hoped I’d decide to stay here permanently, and yes— true that I always thought/hoped when the time came he’d move with me. It’s just hard to give up that hope or walk away over this, but I see it might be necessary. Definitely need a solid answer from him."
TwoXChromosomes,fn5gib7,t1_fn4ytws,1586664255.0,"It really does get easier! The first two years of my period it was so heavy I bled through those huge night pads and sheets. Now in my mid 20s it’s super consistent, light, and manageable. OP, getting a heating pad helps for if you ever have cramps. Other than that, just take care of yourself! Finding the right products helps a lot too, when I found the brand of pads and ramping that worked for me things were a lot more comfortable and less gross."
TwoXChromosomes,fn5g5n5,t3_fytyfa,1586663990.0,"You should! I don’t wear makeup to work almost ever and it feels so great to feel free in my natural face. I also have a hard time waking up in the morning and don’t see putting on makeup for the benefit (?) of others as worth it. It can be a tough transition at first but now I feel just as beautiful without. It also makes me feel more special on the date nights, nights out, etc that I do wear it!"

relationships,fmnlt3n,t3_fvrvi5,1586229074.0,"I actually don’t think you made a mistake bringing it up. It’s not abnormal to feel more distanced when in a long distance relationship, especially under stressful circumstances. However, this is where mature adults work to connect better, and she’s pretty clearly not mature from your post. I’m sorry."
berkeley,flwc2tk,t1_flsiybf,1585545644.0,"Yes there are cute boys. Some of them are pretty arrogant because they know they are. But a lot are nice. To find your people, think about joining a club relating to an interest area."
