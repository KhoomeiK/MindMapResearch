berkeley,fpmi6bn,t3_gebhpp,1588733612.0,"I don't think taking Chem 32 would help if you've already taken AP chem, considering AP Chem would be more advanced than Chem 32 (after all doing well enough on AP chem gives you credit for chem 1A). Having taken the harder chem class for chem majors (chem 4a), even that class mostly covered stuff already in AP chem, so the fact that you've already taken that should be quite helpful for Chem 1a. I can't say how difficult it will be for you but I don't think taking Chem 32 would help.

Personally when I did summer bridge I just did breadth classes, getting the AC req out of the way. Being on campus early was kind of nice but I wouldn't really say it is worth it to pay 4k especially if it is online if money is any sort of issue for you."
berkeley,fpfgw2x,t1_fpfgomc,1588570881.0,Yeah.
berkeley,fpfggoj,t1_fpfffpb,1588570521.0,For first semester freshmen there is no phase 1 or phase 2 - you enroll in up to 17.5 units in one phase. Data 8 would probably be more useful.
berkeley,fpfenjz,t3_gd5dnf,1588569024.0,CS 61A has expanded the past few years to let everyone in. I personally enrolled as a freshman CoC student last year and had no problem getting in. Would not recommend taking CS 61B before CS 61A.

Everything is better than a Sahai semester.

berkeley,fp3mqgu,t3_gb4de9,1588282042.0,There are reserved seats in the lower div pre-reqs for undeclared L&S freshmen.
berkeley,fp2ssed,t1_fp2jnnp,1588267289.0,Wouldn't know since I'm talking it rn over the semester and my GSI is so bad that I never go discussion anyways (so I don't know how helpful it would be).
berkeley,fp2jgf4,t1_fp2i358,1588262803.0,Math 54 is largely orthogonal to calculus. Most of it is linear algebra which doesn't depend on calc at all; a few weeks at the end are on differential equations which does relate but you don't really need that strong calculus knowledge for that part I'd say.
berkeley,fp2idoe,t1_fp1ms7k,1588262274.0,FYI while you can't use AP physics for physical science breath CS 61C covers it. You wouldn't necessarily need to take online breaths to finish a CS degree in three years (the major reqs are not that onerous) but they could let you spend your time here taking more CS classes.
berkeley,fov1haa,t3_g9mszr,1588093851.0,"I'd say phase 2 CS 61B, for the past few years it has comfortably expanded to let everyone of the waitlist while data 8 seems to fill up faster and ppl seem to have more issues enrolling in it. (I phase 2ed 61B this sem and despite not being in any of the reserved seats like undeclared L and S easily got in first day of adjustment.)"

berkeley,fnnc2c2,t1_fnnakhz,1587088972.0,"Hmm, not sure. I'd email the CoC advisors on the best sequence to take if you plan on taking ChemE courses. Since you're in the CoE as BioE you might be fine in in enrolling in 4A. Another sequence I suppose you could take is 1A, 4B, 12A."
berkeley,fnnaczg,t3_g2rvq7,1587087900.0,Chem 4A is basically for people in the college of chemistry. I'd recommend 1A because for one Saykally is an awful professor and last year they kicked off people not in the CoC because they had too many people enrolled in 4A.

berkeley,fmtcmg0,t3_fx9ba6,1586370485.0,On the other hand most CS majors I'd say take 16a and 16b so unless you need math 54 for something else 16a will prob prepare you better for 16b so you don't need to learn circuits separately.
berkeley,fm8j5fh,t1_fm8i58p,1585850331.0,"The ""recommended"" route is to do that - 61a and 16a are designed so that they work concurrently. I'd say most eecs majors do that."
