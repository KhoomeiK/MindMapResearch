RocketLeague,fpcs3qq,t1_fpcdd4b,1588511133.0,"Really? I feel like a lot of people look at how old of a gc title you have as a status symbol too. Lots of gc’s I play with wish they had their titles in s3,4,5 because that’s OG. We’ve all been playing since alpha or beta but something about being highly ranked early on and keeping it says a lot imo."

AskReddit,fp3uhel,t1_fp2nb74,1588286034.0,Most of the time the client just doesn’t know how to express what they want. There are definitely other times where their demands are just flat out impossible though.
ProgrammerHumor,fp3qa6n,t1_fp27435,1588283853.0,Yea the dark navy blue ones. Those suck imo
ProgrammerHumor,fp22wfw,t3_gajjlu,1588254034.0,Your eyes don’t dilate in the presence of red light since it’s such low frequency. The inverse is true of blue light. Lots of the nightlight-type apps which use orange light are compromising both of these aspects. Full red would getting rid of the compromise in favor of causing least dilation.
programming,fp0f3io,t1_fozfljb,1588208036.0,Good farming. There was some sort of area reset that was on a timer and I didn’t want to have to go and log back in and reset the macro every hour.

subaru,fmv0ups,t1_fmujqpy,1586403328.0,"Levorg is a thing. Honestly though, in the future I'm probably just going to get an RS6 Avant if I want another fast wagon. My hawkeye wrx wagon has been good to me and gm6 -> rsti swap project is the dynoqueen/track car, so fast audi wagon will cover the trunk space car when that comes to fruition.  Pllus it'll be nice having a car I don't know how to completely take apart and put back together - take away the shame of having someone else maintain it :D"
