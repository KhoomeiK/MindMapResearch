UCSantaBarbara,fowadnz,t3_g9xcf4,1588115982.0,Veteran on Post 9/11 here. I have to keep going to class to pay rent even though I have ADHD (physics and chem online?!?!?) Idk tbh. I think I'm just gonna P/NP all grades and brute force my way through the best I can. No idea if P/NP will hurt me long-term. I hope not.

MedicalPhysics,fnrmmvu,t1_fnrguuw,1587193889.0,"Do you have any extra advice on what would make me more competitive? Some things I plan on doing are:  


\- Shadowing my friend who is a junior health physicist  
\- Trying to get into some kind of internship or assist with research  
\- I've been in the military for 6 years as a 1C6X1 and I'll be commissioning. I've been working on making sure I do something relevant like this:  [https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/physicist-nuclear-engineer](https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/physicist-nuclear-engineer)   
\- Attaining some good letters of rec from both through my job and university  
\- Certifications involving programming (C++, python)?"
MedicalPhysics,fnrlxg4,t1_fnrguuw,1587193211.0,"I'm afraid I won't be competitive because I'm scared of the upper-division coursework. It's going to be extremely difficult. It feels like I can only work so hard, ya know? Medical Physics is the preferred path ultimately. I don't know how different each job is, but I always assumed they were relevant enough and would help broaden my experience, making me more competitive. Plus, it's more attractive to think about taking a break in-between undergrad and grad school I guess.  


Thanks for the info. :)"
UCSantaBarbara,fnmevdf,t3_fzs9zh,1587070170.0,"You can do a lot with a Physics BS/BA, from finance to computer science. It's very versatile. I recommend having a talk with one of the professors, they could give you a better idea.  


I'm personally going Physics BS --> certified radiation therapist --> certified medical dosimetrist --> grad school (optional)  


You could also pursue any of these healthcare options thru physics:  [https://www.arrt.org/earn-arrt-credentials/credential-options](https://www.arrt.org/earn-arrt-credentials/credential-options)"

In my humble opinion... That's a very complicated question to ask. I don't think anyone can give a meaningful answer without more information. Could you please talk more about your desires, plans, and what you seek to get out of the military? Also, talking about your perspectives of both would help.   
(i.e. What do you want to do with your life/and in the military? Are you interested in a career with the military? How do you plan on using your military benefits to your advantage? Are you aware of the distinctions between officer and enlisted as well as the pros and cons?...)  


Some more personal input. STEM majors are highly desired, so busting out a degree you may not really like would make you less competitive which could also leave you with a job you may not like. Further, don't waste your 14mo of college benefits if you're not 100% sure about getting a bachelors. It's a big commitment, and I feel like you'd *possibly* kneecap yourself if you received a degree in a field you don't like (assuming you finish).   


In the end, if you're really not sure, go enlisted. You have plenty of opportunities to switch officer later. You'll get four years to know yourself better, earn more benefits, earn a CCAF degree and lots of highly relevant skills for your resume, as well as many many other pros."
