math,fpax9t2,t3_gcb29g,1588457621.0,"The bible is Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics. You can access an older version of the first volume (there are two) on his website I believe. A walk through Combinatorics by Bona is also really good and a little easier to read, more illustrated than EC.  I like video lectures if they're ever available and Federico Ardila's Enumerative Combinatorics youtube playlist is hands down the best: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-XzhVrXIVeSi7xym1XAfFIxOAaHVhjtP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-XzhVrXIVeSi7xym1XAfFIxOAaHVhjtP)

He was a student of Richard Stanley. Combinatorics is indeed a lot of fun! Go for it!"
math,fpawact,t3_gc4hb6,1588457036.0,"While, rightly so, a lot of your feelings are attributed to imposter syndrome, not all of them are. I definitely recommend therapy like a lot of other people here. I had similar feelings as you these past years as I got a master's at a top program. I was surrounded by PhD students who were top of their classes in undergrad (from top departments), most of whom have NSF grad fellowships. Around  6 out of 9 in this year's cohort were NSF grad winners. I learned my first year I actually really don't know much of anything. My undergrad didn't have the best curriculum. *I felt like I SHOULD know a certain amount of math, but the feeling was self-destructive. It was a blame game I had with myself. After therapy I learned that maybe I'm not the best, and not all degrees are worth the same.* Your PhD might not be worth as much as an MIT PhD. That's logical. What I learned from therapy is that it's up to us to change and become the image of ourselves we expect - with compassion. Be kind to yourself but your mind isn't illogical; you're not that good. **A PhD from your school doesn't come with the expectation that you should be quick like a whip and know more than you do. An MIT, Harvard, etc. PhD probably. The more you hang out with these mathematicians you'll realize they weren't ALL born with the knowledge and test taking abilities. Those are learned skills. There's nothing stopping you from learning those skills either.** Someone else mentioned spaced-repetition learning. That was what helped me pass the prelims here and overall learn better. I had a very well received master's thesis and defense and I attribute it the changes I made. I learned/changed how I studied, I perfected a test taking strategy, I learned how to play the points game, and went to therapy to learn more about myself. Be kind, your feelings are logical. Be okay with what you know or work to be who you want to be. :)"

math,fowcktv,t3_g9px18,1588117168.0,"I think a lot of people have been through this. Like others have said it can happen with enough of anything. More often it happens when you're facing a wall/challenge and it's hard to be motivated for challenge after challenge. Proofs don't tell you how things work though, so I'm assuming you're an undergrad. Proofs are a way to show everyone that ""this statement"" is always true. Why is it always true? If you decide to pursue a graduate education that's what you'll hope to answer. And yes, as a grad student I feel that way too."
frugalmalefashion,fol1jku,t3_g805sj,1587853059.0,these look nice but I wore out the heel in 3 months. It's actually not a very practical shoe. They wore out so fast and they're tight on the toes. Look good but could be constructed better. I would never buy them full price or anything above 70 again
UCSD,fohv0fd,t1_foe0bxt,1587773169.0,"It's easy to feel that way, but you'll be successful. I just defended my thesis actually and can say i'm an ivy league grad. While I felt like you when my friends became doctor's, dentists, programmers etc. I felt like the biggest loser for being so behind them in my career. But I found my own way, on my own timeline and you will too."
UCSD,foc0605,t3_g6m1ej,1587665645.0,"Dude if there's anything I regret from undergrad it's not dropping classes in situations like this. You just saved your gpa and will improve it next time. One thing you'll realize once you graduate is that that the ""race"" ends at undergrad. Once you finish you realize most people go their whole lives not knowing what they want to do. Some never discover it. Most live with regret. So most people post-undergrad you'll find are going back to school or switching fields in their late 20s or 30s. Personally, it took me probably 4 more years to get into the graduate school of my dreams bcs of not dropping classes when I should have in undergrad. You're smart."

It pits ideals against each other and distracts from the problem: both shooting people and setting a fire is bad. How do we stop people from doing those things? People with mental illness shouldn't be able to buy a gun and we make the punishment severe for arson. But the this is worse, or he/she/they are worse, etc. is what regimes/dynasties/etc. have used for ages to control masses."

UCSD,fntmoqm,t3_g3r34v,1587244740.0,"As an alumn I think I think it's worth it, particularly if you want more opportunity. UCSD has a good reputation for CS at the big tech companies. I think you'll have a far better starting opportunities here than in TX. You'll make up the cost in a few years esp at engineer salaries. Since a BS is a terminal degree for most engineers I think UCSD would be the best choice. With a UT D degree you'll prob have to work a few years before you catch up professionally to a UCSD grad. This is just from my experience though. If you think you wanna get a PhD in something at some point then yeah go to UT D and then go somewhere great for your PhD. What really matters is the last institution you got your degree from."

UCSD,fmpi6zh,t3_fwfiwd,1586281281.0,"Well, after years of therapy I can tell you that being stressed out and feeling like you have more work and less time is an emotional closed loop (they feed each other). So 1) Chill out (however you do). 2) Make a plan to get on track. 3) Get to work. Now when you get to work it's important you don't waste time because that feeds the loop. If you're not focused you can drag out a 50 minute podcast into 3 hours and you'll hate life. So google different focus strategies (I use the pomodoro method and the flora app) and stick to them, and try breathing exercises when you're feeling hyperactive. Lastly, take time to take care of yourself. It might feel like you don't have time to workout, or cook a slow meal, but what you lose in time you make up for in efficiency. Good luck!"
math,fmh6f3r,t1_fmgufoh,1586068275.0,I think you've got a good basic understanding of entry level algebraic geometry. A geometric argument in general isn't limited to studying zero sets though. A geometric argument is any argument can be seen from a picture.
