I dont even know the basic needs committee or subscribe to the daily bruin. I just feel that all these sources of information were not visible enough and it would be accessible for a select group of students.  This post makes me so frustrated and sad because if it was related to relief funding it should have been spread everywhere and on every social media platform.
ucla,fpm8xuc,t3_geacy5,1588727983.0,Same here i am so frustrated. Like it was USAC that made this relief initiative and no one knew about it unless you had an instagram. Why didnt they make an announcement through ucla?

premed,fpj9fxk,t1_fpj944m,1588660671.0,"Well for students like me who are waiting to take an mcat exam I was told to add a burner school in so my application can be processed without waiting till july 10 or when scores release. Application processing can more 3-4 weeks and I want to ensure that my application is in the first batch to be read. So, by having a burner school and processing my application all I have to do is add in my mcat score and I wont have to worry about waiting 3 extra weeks for my primary application to be submitted. Sorry if this is a bit wordy or confusing. In summary it just helps to not worry about the extra processing weeks for those taking their mcats in late june."

Right now, it is a national crisis and it is hitting harder for students that are low income. Arent low income students also considered underrepresented? Didnt USAC try passing a a universal p/np to relieve the burden for the less privileged students during the COVID-19 crisis?

You seem to be ignoring that portion of every question posted so far. If your job includes answering questions why not answer that one. 

If the burden is on the CUB referendum campaign why are we not allowed to have a choice in this matter. Why are you all ignoring the majority  that are telling you practically screaming that  we have no extra money to give to this cause AT THE MOMENT OF A CRISIS.

There hasnt been an increase in yrs, then why are you increasing it now let alone during a crisis for a project thats not even meant to be built until 2-3 yrs later. 
Many of us are angry at the fact that its the pandemic and your asking us for this fee and not even considering the time it takes for the economy to recover. If the necessary spaces are needed and its still takes 2-3 yrs then it doesnt hurt to at least wait until the world let alone the student population recovers. You would love for usac to not be attacked then act in ways that earns our respect. The meeting hasnt done anything but leave negative impressions on you guys after attacking a student who had different opinions of the referendum and leaving unanswered questions.

Its great to hear that the council is WOC and POC  and are addressing problems that have existed for decades, but asking for fees to be more transparent and reducing fees that are not necessary anymore have been asked for even longer and during periods of crisis.

Funding for counselors that actually represent the black student population or funding that can just be refunded so that students have the comfort of knowing they have a some sort of income to stay afloat. Underrepresented groups are not just one type. They fit into multiple categories and thats what your failing to notice. Black communities problems cant be solved by one solution and neither does any other underrepresented communities.  You keep this narrative of trying to help underrepresented communities but have you even spoke with then outside of your own friend group or council members? Have you spoken with every organization that involves themselves with helping homeless students, underepresented students, low-income students, LGBTQ students, financial emergency struck students and what they need? I am in several of these groups and felt no help from USAC and neither did the organizations who helped me. If you dont have jurisdiction in other places, at least under figure out what it means to be a underrepresented community and how your supposed to help them. I can say with confidence that every post that was mad at usac are underrepresented groups that come from diverse backgrounds and are angry that it took someone to expose you guys calling us idiots to show some concern for the student body.
You know what the main question you still failed to answer: what the heck the 45$ fee is for during this time where everyone is limited in money. Your literally taking away money from financial aid that many people rely on."
