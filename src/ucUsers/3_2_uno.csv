Switch,fo5iy4v,t1_fo5ikvz,1587526776.0,Yes but I feel like it would be better for carrying around
ucla,fnv7xxw,t1_fnut7z7,1587283363.0,"I just got AC today. I think this game can have a lot of hours be put into it. However, I have been looking for a new switch lite and havent been able to find one online, so you may have to pick up one used. But yes, I think someone can get their money's worth"
ucla,fnqx15n,t3_g3dr1n,1587174097.0,Surface pro 6 is my go to. Theres a newer version the Surface pro X. It's both a laptop and tablet. I highly recommend it.
ucla,fnpg085,t3_g34rzv,1587144848.0,"Yea as others were saying, best bet is to just go to the lecture halls and sit in. Either talk to the professor or dont but no one is scanning your bruin card to get into class."
ucla,fnloi63,t3_g2ivme,1587057015.0,Do you think we will have online classes in the fall?
ucla,fnevlxg,t1_fneveak,1586896688.0,"Sorry, just tryna figure out plans for the fall. Please reach out for help.

ucla,fnevhwn,t1_fnev8bq,1586896617.0,Yea I can see that as a possiblity. Good talk!
ucla,fneuyps,t1_fneuivq,1586896306.0,"Yea I see late june being a reasonable time to be opened again. I highly doubt well be freed next month. With that said, there will definitely be a spike in cases once were all free and moving about. Do you think that it will be under control by the time we have to move in?"
ucla,fneued4,t1_fnetzf0,1586896021.0,"I think were doing a good job of flattening the curve, but once people are allowed outside again, the second wave is bound to happen. So my guess is that its gonna be whenever were allowed to go outside. And if the first time everyone goes back to ""normal"" living is when schools start up, then that's when the second wave will happen."
ucla,fnetrp9,t1_fnetkm3,1586895709.0,"I feel like no matter when we reopen there will be a second wave. Now this can be avoided if there is a vaccine by then, which doesn't seem likely. Because of this, I think itll be online."

SurfaceGaming,fmo1uud,t1_fmml7zy,1586242340.0,"I ended up downloading it and I've been playing it a lot since then. My frame rate is pretty good actually. But since I'm playing survival I dont save as much, so when I go into busy areas when I dont save for a while it'll stop. I found that playing with a fan pointing at the back helps a lot too."

Disneyland,fmlygfn,t3_fw1mh9,1586195489.0,Wait so are they getting extended or not?
fo4,fmflvy8,t3_fuzu25,1586029986.0,Not that I know of. Either keep leveling or go back to an old save. This happened to me on survival. I was level 20 at diamond city with ~14 hrs. In and I decided to reset the entire game because I didnt like how my sniper build was going.
