Coronavirus,fpc1tgd,t1_fpa6dx6,1588484915.0,I felt the same but had to go to an ER today since all urgent cares around me were “temporarily closed for the weekend”. I was the only person in the ER besides staff. Never in my entire life.
UCSC,fpbob4j,t3_gciwsn,1588474671.0,The letter grade will be replaced for the sake of ur gpa but yes they will see you failed a class and retook it. I wouldn’t sweat that though
UCSC,fpal7i6,t1_fpab7z6,1588450457.0,Truly the best podcast out there imo
UCSC,fpa7tzw,t3_gcarl5,1588442569.0,Ologies !!!!
UCSC,fp0joky,t3_galbdn,1588210616.0,"Continuing students maybe won’t have guarantee but they said nothing about freshman. Personally I wouldn’t defer. It’s just a quarter, and even if it’s more who cares? You’ve got 4 years here. Maybe unpopular opinion but I really don’t find online school that bad, and you’ll still get a freshman experience when everyone can come back, maybe even a crazier one since everyone’s been locked up"
UCSC,fortz7d,t1_foq0xio,1588018475.0,There’s a difference between a weeding out class and a prof making a class difficult just for the sake of being difficult. Miglore made his classes more difficult on purpose as a point of pride.
UCSC,foo0y9e,t1_foo0d75,1587930346.0,"In 11a he bragged about how 70% of the class will fail and if u do, consider switching your major. I don’t understand teachers who brag about people failing, that’s a reflection on you, and your ability to teach. He took pride that this class was a “weeding out” class. Weirdest fuckin shit."
UCSC,fomdgtd,t1_fom6i0w,1587886090.0,No I hate the dude and don’t understand why everyone on this site loves him. I genuinely worked my ass off in his class and was in his office everyday making sure I corrected my mistakes and understood everything truly because I’m horrible at test taking and I do my best to correct it by going extreme. At the end of his class I asked him before the final if he thought I was ready and understood the material and he told me “yes I believe in you and your ability to do well in this class and believe in your understanding of this material”. Come back with a 62% on the final and he goes “well I guess you didn’t understand the material at all” and gave me a C- fuck the dude no matter how much I enjoyed our conversations outside of the classroom material. Absolutely lacks empathy

UCSC,fn8xacr,t3_g06dij,1586752771.0,"I switched out of the major but imo it’s one of the best programs on campus. You’ll absolutely adore it. The professors are incredibly. The advisors are extremely helpful. And there’s so many opportunities. Take advantage of all of it !!!! Field quarters, internships, etc. it’s the best"
AnimalCrossing,fn29414,t3_fys2r1,1586581355.0,My first was oHare and he he didn’t leave for 5 fucking days so I was like oh maybe if I talk to him he’ll go away. NO THEY TRICKED ME INTO ASKING HIM TO MOVE IN I’ll never get over this fuck you O’Hare

migraine,fml3b2p,t3_fvrpae,1586177491.0,The side effects of any triptan for me are way worse than the migraine itself. I’ve just stopped taking rescue medications at this point. It’s either worse or they don’t work at all
migraine,fmk8t1e,t3_fvr4vs,1586147549.0,"I’ve had chronic migraines as long as I can remember. I would get super severe debilitating where there was no denying I had a migraine. But the daily low grade migraines and nausea went entirely ignored. And I was accused of making it up to get out of school. It wasn’t until they got so bad that I had debilitating migraines everyday and couldn’t leave my bed. Took 15 years to finally get treatment. My parents still don’t believe I had pain back then, even if my MRI confirms I’ve had chronic pain as a child due to white spots in my brain where nerves didn’t fully develop (I’m blanking if that’s the correct wording but migraine lmao) 

I was super angry at my parents for a long time. But back then nobody knew anything about migraines. Nobody knew what they were dealing with. Or even how to treat it. They just assumed I hate school. Yet here I am almost done w undergrad, planning on going to grad and PhD afterwards. I fuckin love school my body just sucks. We don’t bring up the childhood stuff anymore, better for everyone to not cast blame"
