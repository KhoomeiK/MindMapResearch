StarWarsEmpireAtWar,fplkom5,t3_gdyki6,1588714442.0,"Awakening of the Rebellion has Imperial Army Troopers, which is essentially what these fellas are"
AskReddit,fpl0e1y,t1_fpk86wm,1588704168.0,Robert California?
clonewars,fpi2pez,t1_fpfqkov,1588632490.0,"Well not the entire 332nd, wasn‚Äôt there a sizable force left on mandalore? They deployed from three venators. I hope some of them survived."
clonewars,fphj1ms,t1_fpghz7n,1588622146.0,"I mean discovering a lost Star Destroyer would probably warrant that kind of response, especially if that Star Destroyer was housing two priority targets when it vanished"
clonewars,fph81ia,t3_gdgytj,1588616599.0,"I thought it was especially fitting to show Jesse's Helmet, adorned with the Republic Symbol so prominently in the final scene. Representing the demise of the Galactic Republic, and those who defended it with their lives. I'm almost glad he didn't live to become a Stormtrooper."
clonewars,fpfg325,t1_fpffpr5,1588570207.0,"It‚Äôs probably a few years down the line. They were using imperial shuttles and all new armor, it took the empire a while to phase out the Clone Armor and even longer to phase out all the republic vehicles and starships. Plus, the decay of the Venator makes it seem like quite a while has passed."
legodeal,fpdqmuu,t1_fp1af1g,1588532265.0,"I‚Äôd personally wait until they get marked down. I bought a few for $2.00 at Walmart and sold them for $5.99 on BrickLink, which seems to be about the going rate for that set (without shipping), at $4.97, I‚Äôd pass for investment"
legodeal,fpdq3gz,t1_fpdphfh,1588531958.0,"Typically I‚Äôd echo this sentiment, but this one actually seems legit. They have retail stores."
clonewars,fpc6blo,t3_gce8q4,1588489065.0,"I mean you only really see that in the maul hallway scene, where I guess you can chalk it up to plot. When they attack Ashoka on the bridge they‚Äôre landing body shots, Ashoka is just skilled enough to deflect them, and when the troopers break into the med bay they nearly kill Ashoka, if it wasn‚Äôt for Rex she wouldn‚Äôt have lasted much longer"
clonewars,fpb5y8h,t1_fp8ybtv,1588462805.0,It‚Äôs treason then
clonewars,fp8bns6,t1_fp7t2aw,1588388315.0,I remember reading somewhere (maybe the essential guide to warfare) that there was clone retirement homes lol
clonewars,fp8bd2b,t1_fp8b4to,1588388112.0,I read that in the robot chicken sidious voice lol
clonewars,fp7rx87,t1_fp7rscf,1588376536.0,"It was so spooky, I loved it!"
clonewars,fp7p52m,t1_fp7p361,1588374927.0,Palps woulda been like ‚Äúwhoops wrong number‚Äù
clonewars,fp6qyzb,t3_gbgwon,1588357071.0,"I mean it's possible he survived, a lot of the clones just got slammed about with the force, only the two who got decapitated and the one who got impaled with the door really for sure were killed."
SEARS,fp4mok3,t1_fp4mmbq,1588302415.0,Ah thought you meant Kmart lol

clonewars,fp33xcw,t1_fp329qn,1588272660.0,Good soldiers follow orders...
clonewars,fp0rxg9,t1_fopkdp4,1588215577.0,"Yeah, Wolfee I believe"
legodeal,fozqglp,t1_fozjgrn,1588195077.0,Aww thank you!
legodeal,fox81h8,t1_fox7y1n,1588136395.0,"While I appreciate all the hard work other essential workers like you contribute, this giveaway is only for healthcare workers. I may consider doing one for essential workers soon."
legodeal,fox7tqc,t3_ga31nl,1588136239.0,"EDIT: we're sold out. thanks so much everyone 

No gimmicks, no catch. Healthcare workers in the front lines of the pandemic (US ONLY) get a free creator set with proof of employment, even shipping is on us.

After giving them out all day, we still have one set left unclaimed! I‚Äôm trying to get them all sent out tomorrow, so if any of y‚Äôall are healthcare workers read the instructions and I‚Äôll hook you up. I‚Äôll update the flair once it‚Äôs OOS.

Mods, I guess technically this is self promotion since I‚Äôm giving them out, but it‚Äôs free LEGO for COVID-19 workers. If you guys can‚Äôt make an exception I understand.  


EDIT: a couple of people sent in requests RIGHT as I was updating the flair, to those people check your email, I‚Äôm sending ya a free 11001 Classic Bricks and Ideas set as a consolation prize!"
legodeal,fox7cwb,t3_g9eyua,1588135901.0,"Belk has been in and out of stock at $23.99 before coupons, picked some up for less than $15 after coupons and a discounted gift card"
legodeal,fov4q3y,t1_fouup5a,1588095348.0,"They probably don't, most likely it's phantom stock leftover from Winter clearance"
legodeal,fotbvgb,t1_forbgrh,1588049561.0,Yeah it looks straight out of Star Wars! Cool set
legodeal,fotbsky,t3_g97bsr,1588049500.0,"Kmart used to be my go to for LEGO deals. Their Shop Your Way program was INCREDIBLE, two-three years ago I was getting thousands of dollars in points a year by optimizing purchases and taking advantage of deals. But in the past year they‚Äôve hardly gotten any new LEGO sets, and the deals have dried up. Haven‚Äôt ordered from them in nearly 6 months now."
TheCloneWars,fosj9k6,t1_fos23cj,1588031797.0,"We also see Delta Squad in a quick cameo, so technically we‚Äôve seen Republic Commandos twice"
TheCloneWars,fonodx6,t1_fomfvr4,1587923330.0,"I think it‚Äôs because Maul really didn‚Äôt want to kill her, he kept hoping that she‚Äôd join him and that they could defeat Sidious"
todayilearned,fol797p,t1_fol0nmu,1587856265.0,I was thinking the same thing! It‚Äôs kinda wholesome actually
legodeal,foik3ts,t3_g7nc0z,1587788649.0,Can confirm! Picked up 2 today in LA
TheCloneWars,foevsa8,t3_g740l0,1587716491.0,"The best part was Maul absolutely losing his shit as the Gunships approached, like he knew being captured by what was going to become the new order was a fate worse than death"
StarWars,foeuljx,t3_g74fux,1587715290.0,Anyone else get goosebumps at this scene? Seeing Clone Troopers herd thousands of scared and unwilling citizens is as Imperial as it gets. Love the foreshadowing.

berkeley,fnzu228,t1_fnzhhb4,1587400758.0,Honestly I‚Äôd rather be in moffit than home rn ü§ß
StarWars,fnudm8s,t3_g2wu6h,1587259756.0,I love how competent that tactical droid was. Like it immediately recognized that it was a trap and that they should‚Äôve continued firing lol
TheCloneWars,fnpt24a,t1_fnpsvpy,1587151481.0,"I rewatched it and you can definitely see at least a few others in the background, and bodies scattered about. Like when they‚Äôre retreating off the platform there‚Äôs at least a few dead Mandos on the floor.

But yeah, since the clones are essentially mandos in their own way, I would‚Äôve liked to see it more on equal footing"
TheCloneWars,fnprhhq,t1_fnou16p,1587150654.0,"I mean they killed a fair amount of Mandos during the second half of the episode, but I kinda agree with the tunnel sequence near the end"
TheCloneWars,fnpel2b,t1_fnpdyb6,1587144140.0,"If you have a decent understanding of Star Wars you could probably jump in, but I‚Äôd recommend actually watching all the seasons (maybe skip season 1)"
TheCloneWars,fno6cdg,t1_fno6acn,1587113732.0,"Sorry about that, I added a spoiler flair. Get on watching it! It‚Äôs the best clone wars episode yet IMO!"
TheCloneWars,fno5s80,t1_fno5pyx,1587113129.0,How is it a spoiler? It's literally just a split second of the title sequence and not a part of the story. I'll add the spoiler flair if you wish.
StarWars,fno3sy0,t3_g2wu6h,1587111015.0,"RIP captain Von, I actually paused when he first appeared charging the mandos on the bridge, he looked so badass. Too bad the had to do him dirty like that :("
legodeal,fnlo4kx,t1_fnl8yvw,1587056836.0,"To their credit one of the employees tried to help me, it gave them an isle location but not a back room location so they didn‚Äôt check back there :( might check back in a week or two."
legodeal,fnjto87,t3_g200rc,1587006744.0,My local store showed them in stock for $2.00 (60% off) went to get some other essentials as well. They supposedly had 166 in stock but couldn‚Äôt find them anywhere. Bummer lol

legodeal,fnf0fwv,t1_fneq35a,1586899148.0,Walmart recently changed their limit to 2 per order on all LEGO sets for some reason. Probably to discourage resellers.
Coronavirus,fn1ytpd,t1_fn1buhg,1586573450.0,"Berkeley, Cornell, Princeton, Penn, University of Chicago, and UCLA would like to have a word with you"
Coronavirus,fmugw3a,t1_fmud1gv,1586391171.0,Honestly. It‚Äôs getting kind of tiresome.
Coronavirus,fmnknok,t1_fmm2rvx,1586228287.0,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying but no one cares. If it fits the narrative that ‚ÄúAmerica is bad‚Äù then half this sub will jump on in on the US hate circlejerk.
Coronavirus,fmnkekw,t1_fmlznji,1586228113.0,"There‚Äôs no use trying to point that out honestly. If it fits the ‚ÄúUSA BAD‚Äù narrative, people will pile on."
Coronavirus,fmnjogs,t1_fmmwigg,1586227623.0,Most of those stories have been proven to be false or logistical misunderstandings
