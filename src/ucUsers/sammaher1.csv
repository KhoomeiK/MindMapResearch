This is my first rep so looking for some help.

Wondering if the 3 is higher than the 9 alignment wise, and if there is a SEL gap in the bottom left. It seems more recessed than the other corners. Also I don't really know how to inspect the bracelet, so if anyone sees any flaws with it please let me know. Thank you!"
