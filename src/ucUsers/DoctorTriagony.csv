I don't get ""most"" people and ""most"" people don't get me sometimes. Maybe I'm just a really shitty person?

I'm a junior and I wasted the last two years here just silently seething because apparently my only purpose in life was to work for every waking moment for the rest of my life. The difference today is that I'm an artist now and I just don't give a fuck anymore. If I'm going to live and die having never existed to ""most"" people, then live and let die.

Now that I think about it, I've always been just six feet apart from being clinically depressed. Call it ""diet depression"" because I'm not unhappy - I just really don't want to think about it because it really burns when I do.

""It takes your mind."" / ""Again.""

The bright side of this pandemic is that if I was missing anything from the last two years, this quarantine makes it so that there's nothing I can miss to begin with. You can take relief in the fact that as long as we're in quarantine, there is absolutely nothing you are missing right now.

Independence is a virtue. The way I see it, if people don't give a fuck about me, then I don't need to give a fuck about them. It saves a lot of time and you-know-what.

""I don't care if you don't, I don't care if you don't"" / ""I don't care if you don't care""

You'll be ""fine."" Which definition of ""fine?"" Your choice."
