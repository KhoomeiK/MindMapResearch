programming,fpgwqs7,t1_fpfagv9,1588610886.0,"There is [research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08625.pdf) to use SAT solvers to learn concepts from extremely unbalanced datasets, where traditional ML techniques aren’t as effective. This situation comes up in the EDA industry."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4jqs2,t1_fp4befk,1588300568.0,I think it is pretty rare. I only know one other person that switched into engineering (CS) and they were also uniquely talented.
UCSantaBarbara,fp4ar8k,t1_fp1dp6t,1588295109.0,"I had a friend that switched from physics to ME. 

He managed to get into some of the lower div major classes, excelled while becoming friendly with the professors. One of them wrote a very strong letter of rec and his application was accepted despite a not incredible GPA. Pretty bright guy."
UCSantaBarbara,fp0y7st,t1_fp0sq5w,1588219639.0,"Yeah they definitely seem different by department for sure.

In my department, I had professors that strictly followed a standard bell curve and also ones that seemed to give everyone very high marks."
UCSantaBarbara,foyvfva,t1_foytt1t,1588179907.0,"I don't think they do single rooms for undergrads. Unless you scare your roommates into moving out, then you could have a temporary single."
UCSantaBarbara,fowi9dq,t3_g9xia3,1588120301.0,"I was an orientation leader a few years ago. Besides the pass time discrepancy that others have mentioned, I think orientation (even online) has value. Most of the curriculum is teaching you about your degree requirements and academic resources. Beyond that, you are likely to come out of orientation with a good sense of the programs, resources, and communities that are sprinkled throughout UCSB.

You can find out pretty much all of the information about your degree and things around campus if you look at online resources yourself, but I would speculate most people aren't motivated enough to go this route. Of course, if you forego orientation you can't ask a current member of club ABC what its like and things like that."
UCSantaBarbara,fovq1el,t1_fould77,1588105548.0,"1. I am not a biology major, but my general opinion is that the fear of the bell curve is greatly exaggerated and not something you need to worry about. The other side of the coin you're looking at is the value/reputation of the school (see this [US News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities) rankings), where UCSB is significantly higher ranked.
2. Of course not! If you are not super busy during the day and motivated, you can easily avoid this.
3. They exist at every school. These people won't ""ruin your chances"" of getting into med school... you have much more important things to concern yourself with if you're going that route."
UCSantaBarbara,fovfhl7,t3_g9rw4i,1588100434.0,"Why do you want to join AS? I have friends who did AS and are now in national politics, so it may be a good idea if that trajectory sounds interesting. 

Unless you’re really that bored, it’s probably just a headache waiting to happen IMO (I was briefly in AS). Having said that, there are a lot of different organizations and roles in AS, so I’m sure some are less nauseating than others."
UCSantaBarbara,fntbkxn,t3_g3gp5e,1587238394.0,"1. pretty easy, the lower div tradeoffs are a few more CS classes vs. more math/physics and at the upper div CS 130A and ECE 154 vs. ECE 130 and 137. I had friends who easily switched both ways (typically at the end of 1st - 2nd year), although more commonly from EE to CE. If I were in your position, I would feel it out and then make my decision based on which elective classes seemed more interesting to me.
2. I actually felt that CE majors had better job prospects that EE's, but the grass is always greener. Having said that, if you're motivated to be a great engineer then either route will probably reward you with great career opportunities out of college. The ECE department at UCSB is awesome!
3. I really think that the pedigree of students accepted is equivalent, but students who apply CE are probably more likely to have some SW experience than EE's."
UCSantaBarbara,fno0ap2,t1_fnnow1k,1587107476.0,"Let’s assume the caliber of students is roughly equal. Where do you want to live after graduation? Penn State is 65% in-state according to [this](https://admissions.psu.edu/apply/statistics/) while UCSB is 85% in-state according to [this](http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/campus.profiles.2018.19.pdf), so I would consider that when evaluating potential “network strength”.

I really don’t think grade deflation is significant (if it exists at all) and probably will not be a factor that affects your graduate school admission. 

Sports are not a big part of UCSB compared to other schools IMO, but my experience was awesome and wouldn’t trade my college experience or friends for the world. There’s a lot more to “the college experience” than sports, but either way you should go visit your friends for big football games! Best of luck with your decision."
UCSantaBarbara,fnfwjws,t1_fnfp70b,1586916992.0,"I have a friend who is an actuary and recent grad from UCSB. They majored in actuarial science and participated in clubs like data science club, actuarial assoc., and a professional fraternity."
