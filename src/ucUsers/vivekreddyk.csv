USC,fodjzij,t3_fpi6wi,1587685639.0,"I am international student who would like to get out of college without debt. I got accepted into the MS in CS program, and in one of the seminars they talked about the honors program where in you get a full fee waiver plus a TAship. But you would have to maintain a gpa of 3.9+. Could anyone guide me on how hard/easy is this task given that usc is notorious for accepting students with high gpa's into their masters program?

Thanks a lot, hope to get my question answered."

I guess it would still be a ambitious program for me to get into, as i am from a tier 2 college in India. However, i overestimated my profile and bombed my fall 2020 applications. Applied to the cs program here and got rejected in a mass reject wave."
