What you could do is get out the fastest and then slow it down so they're all behind you, and then pick it up quickly at the last 200m.

I feel like he probably needs to just take some time off from social media for his health and his decision making.

He also publicly challenged JJ to spar then ducked it. Now he wants to end the beef, but probably only because he knew the Poppin Challenge would garner him lots of views lol.

Jallow knew Deji for a while and probably would have filmed the disstrack anyway. He's pretty new to music so it makes sense for him to want to branch out, but it does seem fake because he helped edit and produce the Deji disstrack on JJ.

Crypt dropped a warning track on Randolph, but not JJ, and then JJ dissed him on Ares so Crypt accepted Deji's invitation to hop on the disstrack. Crypt and Randolph then squashed the beef on Youtube Cypher, and since then Crypt has reacted to a lot of JJ's songs even gassing him up.

berkeley,fo1vg7i,t3_g56xi7,1587442402.0,"from the limited evidence and no context provided, yea nicole looks bad, but you can make just about anyone look bad if you take things out of context. i think we should reserve judgment on this case until we actually get the whole picture rather than a few selected screenshots from a throwaway with a biased name, and I'm glad everyone in the comments seems to be doing so"

running,fo0uaoy,t3_g4srav,1587419890.0,"i used to be negative because i was out of shape and got tired easily. I had no idea why or how people could run multiple miles. this was 2-3 years ago and 15-20 lbs heavier lol. now that my fitness level is actually decent instead of below average, running is more fun. so i'm guessing it's just not very enjoyable for them at the moment and they don't understand the fun part of it."

Sprinting,fnycrnl,t3_g4gd22,1587359337.0,"De Grasse is the stronger finisher and he got a good start in the final. Bromell is a slower finisher and didn't get out quick enough I think. From what I remember, Bromell did have a lead but it wasn't very big and De Grasse closed the gap. Also, stats don't mean much if we don't account for wind. A 9.80 with +2.0 is a meh time, but a 9.82 into a headwind is a much better relative time despite being slower, for example."
Sprinting,fnycdjr,t3_g4k3tw,1587359020.0,"1st question depends on level. elites are below 10%. competitive high schoolers around 10-13% but definitely below 15%. as to second question, it also depends on type of workout. like for hill accelerations to practice the start, \~40m should be fine. but for full on hill sprints then at least 60m i think. not sure about the type though. i go to school in the city so most of the ""hills"" are really just sloped sidewalks. i'd assume grass or gravel is the best material."
Sprinting,fnyaypo,t1_fnwtzk4,1587357908.0,"yeah agree with JORE, although in my case I did sprints first so I can't personally say from experience what difference it made in my mid-distance times"
Sprinting,fnwo4vd,t3_g4bu5u,1587322123.0,"I've ran both in races, trained sprints for 3 on-and-off years roughly, and just started training 3 weeks ago for mile and 5k.  
Last August, after my sprint training ended, I ran the 100 at a meet and got a 12 flat. My PR is 11.99 and a hand-timed 25.3 for the 200m  
At the same meet I entered the 1500m for fun and managed 5:02.90. Not sure what my 800m is but it's probably like 2:15 ish? at the moment. My mile PR right now is around 5 minutes, ran in a solo time trial."
amateur_boxing,fno03z4,t3_g2e3po,1587107296.0,"long term it's possible to cut quite a lot imo, but short term is unhealthy. for me I try to walk around at 135 at most, and I cut to below 119 once. it was over a 3 week period or so, starting with cleaning up my diet, then cutting sodium out, then finally a water cut for the last 5 days. only the last week felt hard on the body, the last few pounds from 124 and lower. overall i lost 16-17 pounds from my natural weight. however, if you are already fit and ectomorphic the number could be a bit lower, maybe 13-14. it looks like you can make the cut, but it's definitely better to do it long term. my coach told me that ideally the water cut should only be the last 3-4 pounds."

EDIT: I believe the curve was top 30% get an A, next 40% get some kind of B. But I might not have remembered it correctly."

trackandfield,fnie8dl,t3_g1x6u3,1586978504.0,"All in their primes? Van Niekerk 1st (he holds the WR for 300m and 400m). James, Merrit, Wariner, and Bolt all fight for 2nd and 3rd. Blake is too bulky (in his prime he had great 200m strength but I think he'll fade a bit toward the end and get passed, same with Gatlin.) Bolt's taller and lankier, which is relatively better for 300-400. It depends on if his 100-200m speed is good enough to keep him ahead of the 400m specialists, but it's worth noting that Bolt has the third fastest 300m all time, but it's only 0.2 faster than James and Merritt's, and those were run in a 400m race so they weren't going all out. Wariner's is a bit slower than James and Merritt so let's count him out of the top 3. All in all I have Van Niekerk, followed by Bolt, who almost gets run down by James, and Merritt in fourth, with Wariner 5th. Not sure about the rest."
