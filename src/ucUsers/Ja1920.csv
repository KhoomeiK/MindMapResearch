ucla,fmz0f12,t1_fmz09dq,1586501769.0,Err I think I’ll leave that to you. Seems like you’re the expert...
ucla,fmyztaq,t3_fyaao8,1586501160.0,"Depends on how much you put in it. I’m an alumni scholar but wasn’t really involved. Just did the volunteering requirement to continue the money. But if you apply and get a leadership position, it could be really fun and beneficial for your future! But if it’s the same price as an Ivy League school, I’d definitely go with the latter. Honestly, the administration at Ucla can be pretty unhelpful. Like just today, we found out that the student council (which does absolutely nothing) is raising fees. But the professors here are amazing and there’s a world class hospital nearby.  So really depends on what you want to do in the future."
