aves,fplrjel,t1_fplbjg3,1588718100.0,Makes sense. Seems like the expansion of any kind of harm reduction stuff at all would be a good step..
aves,fplrcrg,t1_fplp01r,1588718000.0,"Wow I love this, thank you for sharing! As someone who's worked with medical teams at various festivals (in the US), I feel like having these services would actually be a great way of preventing so much of the pretty bad cases we see, especially given that people are so much more likely to get help pre-emergency from a space like those you described over a med tent.."
aves,fplqzyz,t1_fplkzl7,1588717808.0,Just read up on it... so extremely frustrating. Seems he's spoken up against the way its been used to halt harm reduction work so maybe that speaks to Some amount of hope for progress..
aves,fpl60pk,t1_fpl41m1,1588706989.0,"Thanks for your reply.

I feel like it says so much about the need for testing when it's used so highly when available.

Curious what you're referring to by better HR at other events if it's not testing?"
aves,fpl29la,t1_fpl1vn0,1588705097.0,So clearly this becomes the harm reduction argument. Same reasoning for why safe injection sites have had a lot more trouble taking off in the US when compared to Canada; we just seem to unfortunately behind in understanding the evidence.. Maybe setting up drug testing (even if it was for-profit) outside of venues at show/festivals could be a solution?
communitycollege,fpkftf6,t3_gdu8yi,1588693909.0,Best thing she can do is call the financial aid office at her future school! They tend to be super helpful. Also ask about the Board of Governors Waiver which has the potential to make her schools near free.
communitycollege,fpidhkm,t1_fphvl1r,1588638659.0,"Hm, not sure if you misunderstood my comment. 

Definitely agree that with regards to transferring you should Absolutely ensure that every class is recognized and works towards your specific major at the university you're interested in transferring to. 

Important to state that if you decide to pursue an associates, it's important to 

1. Plan out the schedule of classes you need for the Uni transfer 
2. See what classes you need to add to that to qualify for the associates (with the knowledge that some of these classes won't contribute towards your eventual major at the university). 
3. Get all the degrees!"
communitycollege,fpid6ju,t3_gdmif3,1588638486.0,"I think with summer sessions it always makes sense to take classes that you know you're going to have to take, but you're least interested in or most worried about. 

Can't really comment on the zoom thing, but I would assume that this is a good time to knock out some GEs that you're just not excited about haha"
communitycollege,fpicfwi,t1_fphen8l,1588638056.0,"I'm really sorry to hear that :( 

If you haven't yet, I very much suggest checking out some clubs or other extracurricular groups. These are definitely the best ways to make friends at CC. Also, never be afraid to ask people to be in a study group with you etc. !"
communitycollege,fpic94n,t1_fph44fl,1588637947.0,"So there are some definite differences between the first two years of your college experience being at a cc vs uni. CC's are mostly made up of commuters and thus you're less likely to have an ingrown community of peers the way you might at a dorm in a university. At the end of the day, it'll largely depend on how willing you are to get involved outside of class in communities where you can make friends! That's how I was able to make many of my friends at cc.

With regards to counselors, in my experience they can be Super variable in quality, but also are one of the most vital aspects of your time at any school. I highly suggest asking around for recommendations (this applies to cc and/or unis) and checking with multiple if you feel like your first isn't being super helpful. One of the best way to ensure good quality counseling is to get it through a specialized program such as an Honor's program, STEM program, culture-specific program, etc."
communitycollege,fpht9ab,t3_gdk91o,1588627391.0,"I was one class short of an associates before transferring to UC. Never made a difference for me and I've never heard of it mattering if you know you're going to get a bachelor's degree; with that said, no harm in getting one if you can get it during your time at cc!"
communitycollege,fpfe5m5,t3_gd4fgu,1588568614.0,I had a great experience at community college and ended up transferring to a UC which I definitely had no chance getting into as a high school senior. I made friends I've kept to this day (I'm now a third year student in med school) by getting quite involve in extracurriculars on campus. Happy to chat more about it! There are definitely pros and cons to attending cc.

neoliberal,folets9,t1_fokrw07,1587860704.0,"I feel bad about all sexual assault and harassment. I feel bad ablut the sexual harassment that's happened to the people in my life. I feel bad about what he's done if he's made other people feel uncomfortable. There is zero question in my mind of who I'm going to vote for. It's a simple dichomotous decisiom that exists alongside all the other things I think and feel and will act towards. I will vote for Bernie in the ny primary, but will vote for whoever is on the democratic ticket in November."
