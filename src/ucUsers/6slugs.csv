UCSC,fp59ro4,t3_gbduxh,1588321325.0,"Id recommend just like, asking your primary care physician, or any past ones. You’d be surprised how often they have the records you need. 

Besides that, the school is actually flexible with this. Like, my friend with an antivax mom still was aloud to show up mostly unvaccinated and get them done over a period of time ag the school. 

There’s two ways you can go about proving youre immunized, also. Either with vax records or by doing an antibody blood test. You can probably knock out several or all of those at once. 

No matter what, definitley just contact the school. They understand this is not the time to be going to the doctors lots without good reason, especially if you tell them the main issue is not a lack of vaccination but lost records. They can and will work something out with you, whether thats testing or vaccinations when you get to school, or waiting until you figure it out. Its not really a hard deadline, especially now. 

Um if youre an international student this all may be more difficult though. If so, sorry in advance. 

Hope this helped! Good luck!

Edit: however if you know you havent got any vaccinations recently, including flu, now is DEFINTELY the time to do that. I mean, i think, cause thats what they were saying. If you dont get the flu, youre more likely to mot get/recover from covid19, and itll cause less confusion with testing, and you wont hurt the more vulnerable around you.

So, if you want to send him a short email that's like ""hey professor I'm uncomfortable with using ProctorU"", here's some points you could include:

* ProctorU and the person monitoring my exam can access all the files on my computer.
* ProctorU's privacy policy reveals that my data can be obtained by third parties, and if ProctorU is bought or goes bankrupt, all my data will be transferred to the new owner.
* I feel that video and audio monitoring by a stranger violates my privacy
* Streaming/recording my video and audio puts a big strain on my device and my network, and I'm concerned it will affect my ability to take this class (I think this is an important point, my chem prof decided not to do any video/audio monitoring because it made it impossible for a lot of people to even take the test)
* Other UC's have moved to ban software like ProctorU (UCB) or have made statements explicitly against it (UCSB)
* There are alternatives, like lockdown browsers

I believe they are well summarized by [this letter from the UCSB faculty addressing their chancellor](https://cucfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ProctorU_2020-1.pdf):

>  
>ProctorU requires full access to your computer's files when taking a test; anyone who has sensitive information like financial documents, medical records, address, password information, identification information, etc. are at risk of having their data mined. ProctorU's privacy policy outlines that it keeps any information as long as it is deemed important, and has vague and contradicting language about the fact that it sells data to third parties. Along with that, in the event of bankruptcy or being bought, ProctorU will turn over all data to the relevant party. This alone makes me feel unsafe using ProctorU  
>  
>Moreover, while testing each person will be monitored by a stranger, who can remotely control the student's computer and see anything on it. Even if I were to trust ProctorU not to compromise my data, I do not trust an employee that could access and record my data.   
>  
>Furthermore, I am uncomfortable with a stranger being able to have full video and audio access to my device. [UC Berkeley has banned all online proctoring](https://www.dailycal.org/2020/04/05/online-exam-proctoring-no-longer-allowed-for-uc-berkeley-classes/) that uses video, stating that ""*current options do not satisfy university policies related to privacy"".* [Berkley has moved to use lockdown browsers](https://campusreform.org/?ID=14683), browsers that prohibit students from accessing other files or the internet while testing and *""does not provide remote visual proctoring via a webcam""* in the place of video proctoring.   
>  
>I understand that it is very important to maintain academic integrity as best we can even during circumstances like these. However, I am concerned about my and my classmates' privacy and misuse of sensitive data. I believe there are more secure options that are also more accessible to those without reliable WiFi or devices, like the lockdown browsers UCB (and my chemistry class) are using. I understand that switching platforms would be inconvenient, but I think it would be worth it to protect the privacy of your students.

UCSC,fowxk8o,t1_fowvtf3,1588129321.0,"Basically, well
Okay theres a few issues. For one, it requires total access to all the files on your computer while you use it. For another, it requires constant video and mic access. Now, it would already be scary if the were simply picking through our files and saving the data while we tested, but they’re also having a real person proctor each individual exam. 
  That person can see everything on your computer, and nothing is stopping them from finding your financial, medical, other personal data and just.. keeping it. Also whatever you use to ID yourself
   Now, in the companies privacy policy, it is outlined that all data is saved “as long as they need it” and that they do sell to third parties and advertisers. They don’t outline what they save or who they give it to in any specific way. This means they have lots of legal leeway. 
   Also, they have full video and audio access to your space, and while that’s less concerning to me, it was enough for [berkley](https://www.dailycal.org/2020/04/05/online-exam-proctoring-no-longer-allowed-for-uc-berkeley-classes/) to ban it and any other program like it. 
    Last but not least, what IS explicitly outlined in their privacy policy is that if theyre ever bankrupt or bought, all your data goes with them, no matter who it is. 

So yeah basically. If youve ever done taxes on your computer, if you have your fafsa files saved, if you have medical records, if you have passwords, bank info, literally anything, you are at risk. 

Hope this helped

The college themes dont matter. There are, however, cultures particular to each, and that really does matter. 

The school is extremely LGBT friendly. Like, people assume I use they/them pronouns, even when theyre not queer. I’ve never had that, like, ever. Also, the ratio of lgbt students is much higher than anywhere ive ever been in my life. If you want places with bigger lgbt communties, porter is pretty gay (and loud and crazy and artsy and into partying), and merrill is pretty gay (and quiet and calm and laid back). Merrill has the Kantu Queer Center (awesome place to gang out, hosts a lot of events) and trans inclusive housing. I believe every college dorm has a floor or building dedicated to lgbt housing. Theres also a whole apartment complex thats lgbt and trans inclusive. It’s an awesome culture, really. Blew my mind. 

Also, the school has its own pride month (may is gay), and they start it off with the Glitter Ball

As for there being a large conservative body on campus, there absolutely is not. In fact, as someone super progressive myself, this place can tire me out by being so one sided sometimes. The college republicans club is tiny. This does seem to have the effect of making conservative people kind of become more conseravtive and loud, in sort of a reactionary way, if that makes sense. 

This place rocks. Hope to see you here next year. When picking a housing college, consider the culture (ask people here), the stuff the actual college has, and maybe the dining.

relationship_advice,fmrukl0,t1_fmrubzn,1586336006.0,"Yeah, youre right. But I suspect this is something we can compromise on, and I think its part of a conversation about asking him to respect my autonomy as I become more independant even when he’s not all comfortable with that. 

I can always sleep over at his house, my dad is fine with that, but I really want to be able to spend more time at my house with my family and him. 

What can I say to tell him like, Im kind of an adult and we need to learn how to compromise?"
relationship_advice,fmru5j8,t1_fmrtm37,1586335566.0,"Im not contributing right now, and I get what you’re saying, but it’s a bit more complicated than that, and he’s indicated its a conversation he wants to have anyways. Neither of us are pissed right now, we’re just prone to escalating during an arguement. We’re close and we’ve been through a lot together. 

I could just sleep over at his house, but I want to be able to do that at my house too, because I love my dad and my brother and my parter and I’d like to be able to be with them all more. It’s been a while since I felt welcome in my home, let alone had one really, and I just want to not spend less time there because of something we could work out like this. 

I’m going to talk to him about it, I dont think I can avoid it. I just want to know what you guys think are the right things to say. Thank you for your comment.

Edit: I think i’m kind of asking how to have the “Ive been an adult for a bit, can we start learning how to compromise om things?” Conversation."
