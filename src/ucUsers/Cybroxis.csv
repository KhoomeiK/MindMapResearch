Therefore, if I am analyzing data through a program I can justifiably say I’ve applied neural network machine learning (because after a while you feel like a machine that never stops learning) to computationally investigate novel data integration."

bioinformatics,fo0pc21,t1_fo07up7,1587417277.0,"In my case, I consulted on a project where the previous company had done analysis. When I tried using the updated pipeline I usually use for analyzing such data, lo and behold, the results didn’t make sense. Ipso facto I had to spend many hours figuring out Cufflinks just for this project to recreate previous data which the previous authors didn’t include as part of their pipeline. I will never use it again, because it is outdated and the pipeline I made for myself is therefore functionally useless. 

Not a fun time."

pics,fnbzt6y,t1_fnbqg48,1586825639.0,"People lie to get close to each other, as their first goal is to get close to someone and they fear alienating that other person with their foibles and faults. At some point, this is impossible to keep up and the truth comes out. Ironically, if they had been honest with who they are to begin with, it may have taken longer to find that other person who actually likes their true self, but it would be maybe a year or so as opposed to 18, at which point people are old and desperate and willing to put up with anything. The people who are honest with each other and willing to compromise over the long run have spent their time more wisely. It’s not that people change. They let down their guard eventually.

Focus on improving yourself so that it is not an act, then look for someone who has what you’re looking for who is also not acting."
ContestOfChampions,fn8pgck,t3_g050m1,1586746949.0,Ice Man is actually Loki in disguise. He pretends to be a Mutant but really is using Magic and his Frost Giant form to fool everyone. And that “Frost Armor?” It’s actually Asgardian armor. I can’t believe you would all fall for this classic Loki hoodwink. You’ve all made a classic blunder. Tomfoolery at its finest.
