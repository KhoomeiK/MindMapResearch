emulation,foilcb6,t3_g4ndne,1587789585.0,"I was downloading a Pokemon XD Rom from RomsMania and definitely downloaded some kind of malware/spamware. Not super tech savvy, so I'm not sure what I should do. 

The top part of my screen has some weird browser running, but I can't actually reach/click it. Kinda scary stuff. I've never had this problem before, I've emulated many GameCube/Wii games on Dolphin on this laptop before. 

I didn't know what to do, and didn't see anything immediately on Task Manager, so I shut off my computer and figured I'd look into what I need to do. Searches for dealing with virus/malware from ROMS didn't lead to anything that I thought would be good, so I'm hearing asking y'all for help on what I should just do as my first steps. Really concerned as I need this laptop during the quarantine...."
