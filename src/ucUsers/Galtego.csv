Which is.... almost nothing? I only ever use them on sentinel weapons when I want them to be applying procs while I melee something else with a CO build.

Personally I'd love to see a set of mods that, instead of increasing tick duration, increases tick RATE, now that could potentially see some use; imagine a dot proc ticking 5x faster. There's a lot of weapons that are in the ""one shot could kill them, but you gotta wait for the ticks"" category."

As for energy it seems like we're operating under different concepts of what's balanced. Personally I think it's okay to run out of energy if you're using your abilities constantly. I personally don't think always having energy whenever you want it without any extra effort or cost is balanced."
Warframe,fnsp0hr,t1_fnsfznz,1587226037.0,"If you're running out of ammo or energy then  (except for a few cases imo) you've made that decision in your build, you've made a trade off for lower efficiency in exchange for more strength or fire rate or something. External sources of energy aren't necessary on caster frames, they just allow you to further minmax your build. Imo that's fine, that's fair, the modding system is honestly one of my favorite things about Warframe.
