ucla,fndlasc,t3_g06mdh,1586872546.0,"Neuro upper divs are hard, but I don’t think they are significantly harder than most life science upper division courses. There is some emphasis on reading and understanding research papers and scientific literature, more especially so in neuro electives and in the M101A/B/C discussion sections. Neuroanatomy will kick your ass, pure memorization, and if you’re good at spatial mapping, that’s a plus for this class. 153A is your standard biochemistry class that is also part of the core classes, not really neuro related but important for MCAT/Med School prereq/foundational knowledge for other things."
ucla,fndjtgn,t1_fnc5fbm,1586871634.0,"Literally the entire field of neuroscience is based on some discussion of synapses lol. There is no required core course with the word “synapses” in the title from what I see on my transcript, you may be referring to a neuro elective. Feel free to PM me if you’re interested in talking about post-grad stuff/gpa."

ucla,fmqnw34,t1_fmikgub,1586303351.0,"The FAU BA/MD program sounds awesome, especially since that you can have your MD as soon as 7 years, I mean that’s crazy. Personally, I would strongly consider that program over UCLA unless: 1) your family can pay of all or most of UCLA expenses and/or 2) you are not sure about medicine as a career, but I doubt this is the case since you were actually accepted to the program."

ucla,fmqj228,t1_fmq02zd,1586300574.0,"Hi! Great question. Personally, I have successfully transferred two English Comp classes from a TX CC. It fulfilled my English requirements at UCLA except for critical writing I believe. I think you need to submit a petition to college counseling w/ syllabus information, at least for GEs. If they are major requirements, I would suggest contacting your major counselor."
