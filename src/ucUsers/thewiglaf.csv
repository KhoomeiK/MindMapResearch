> Allowing Republicans to call witnesses

The intelligence committee saw 3 Republican witnesses: Tim Morrison, David Hale, and Kurt Volker. Yes, Adam Schiff denied the other witnesses for relevancy, and you can feel free to try to convince me that somebody like Hunter Biden had anything to do with the phone call. Will you at least admit that calling the whistleblower was inappropriate? The only one I'm not sure of is Nellie Ohr, because I don't know what the Republican reasoning was for her.

Meanwhile, legitimate Democratic witnesses like Giuliani and Bolton (who knew about the phone call) were blocked by Trump. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

The judiciary committee also heard a Republican called constitutional law expert named Jonathan Turley. Turley had criticism about the Democrats moving too fast, and hell, maybe he's right, but this is not evidence of not following ""the process"", as there is nothing codified about how long things are supposed to take. I'm not aware of anything that was blocked from being heard by the judiciary committee.

Given the above, it's disingenuous for you to imply that Republican witnesses weren't allowed.

> make some rule amendments in the House

I didn't know of any requested amendments, do you have a source on this?

> All House Republicans were able to do was question the Dem's witnesses under the Dem's rules

As far as I know, the Democrats adopted rules for the proceedings that were codified into the house during the (Republican led) 114th congress in 2015. [Almost every power granted to these committees that Republicans disagreed with was codified by Republicans](https://news.yahoo.com/republicans-enabled-the-impeachment-process-theyre-now-criticizing-190508914.html). So to say these were Dem rules is also disingenuous. The majority decides which rules to use, sure, but that's just how our government works.

> The Senate's job is only to vote on the articles

This is false. The US constitution grants the Senate sole power to conduct a trial. It doesn't say they *have to* hold a trial, but you are wrong to say that hearing witnesses and evidence is only the House's job.

I understand there can be differences of opinion on the proceedings, but I'm not so sure you have a good case to claim the process wasn't legitimate. You're essentially saying that you wish the party with the majority of votes voted differently on various matters. Again I will just go ahead and grant you that it was mostly partisan, as these things are, but I'll reiterate, what are you trying to add to the conversation with this claim? It doesn't support your idea that the process was illegitimate, as partisanship has *always* (unfortunately--but for good reason) been allowed.

Now for my opinion. The Republican party is pulling an old play that is tried and true for them. Complain until you're blue in the face when Democrats have the vote, and then crickets when it's their turn. To say that it's unfair to not allow certain witnesses during the House investigation, and then when you have the power to call anyone you want in the Senate, and not do so, speaks volumes about what the Republican intentions are. And you want to blame the Democrats for being partisan? It's a load of crap if you ask me.

I suppose there's more to say, but I'd like to hear how you can justify your claims given all of this."

I've mentioned how federal court appointments could incrementally shape a future that's easier for the next generation of progressives, but you've failed to describe what your path to progressivism through Trump over Biden even looks like. All you've done is throw around phrases like ""spineless"", ""fool"", ""idiocy"", and ""GFY"", so would you care to explain how Trump over Biden in 2020 makes things easier for future progressives?

PresidentialRaceMemes,fot70l2,t1_fot4o21,1588046087.0,"> Trump's disastrous presidency has the benefit of exposing the fraud and abuse of American Empire and just how hollow the so-called ""Resistance"" party is.

See, I used to think this. And I used to vote 3rd party. But if the last four years have taught me anything, there is no bar that is too low for Republicans. This farce has been on full display for 4 years, and nobody's mind got changed, because people are idiotic creatures. What's the point of exposing fraud and abuse if that's what they want?

The only path to progressivism in which Trump over Biden makes sense, is one in which the entire system collapses and is rebuilt from scratch. Can you imagine what that scenario might be like? I'm not going to gamble the future on that.

I've had to come to accept that I may not see the type of change that you and I want to see in my lifetime. You're right, Biden won't get it done. But federal judge appointments last for generations, and progressivism isn't going away. Progessive ideals will win in the end, and perhaps it won't be until after I die. But I have to vote Biden over Trump now, because it will simply be easier for future generations of progressives to build off of.

Unless you think a total collapse would be better for most people, which, by the way, isn't even a guarantee. It will get so much worse before that happens and it's not going to be pretty."

He hasn't looked any of this up and appears to just be going by what his layman definitions of these words are in order to...

Like, sure some drugs can be administered with an injection, but no doctor is calling that a ""disinfectant"".

Edit: Btw, this is from the first medical definition of disinfectant I could find:

> Disinfectants are usually applied to inanimate objects since they are too strong to be used on living tissues.

> Once he was elected governor, Carter largely returned to the progressive values he had promoted earlier in his career. He publicly called for an end to segregation, increased the number of black officials in state government by 25 percent and promoted education and prison reform.

It's worth noting that he lost the previous election running on his ideals, so it would appear that he purposely stained his legacy a bit in order to give some power back to the people. I don't want to excuse Carter for this, but I guess hate the game and not the player in this case?"
