skyrim,foojyt4,t3_g8ltrr,1587940465.0,"You have to interact with the world around you as well as the items in the inventory— if you were trying to learn something in real life, how would you do it? If you wanted to know what effect ingredients have in real life, how would you do it?

You should experiment with different styles but if you pay attention to loot or merchandise, you might notice you can really specialize your character. 

You can also turn down the difficulty in the settings at the expense of less experience gain for skill trees."
skyrim,fooj4g2,t3_g8mafs,1587939982.0,This poll is kind of a false dilemma cause I personally don’t use it because I think it sucks the fun out of the game. But if someone else finds it fun then... by all means.
berkeley,fomnoyk,t3_g8bknl,1587897034.0,"Disclaimer: I’m a community college student who just got admitted.

At first, physics was my biggest difficulty. My strategy was like yours but when I took physics 1, it failed me for the first time. Got a B in mechanics and heat. Followed by an A in electricity and magnetism and an A+ in optics and modern. 

A big chunk of it was reading the recommended book. In my opinion, lectures are great for perspective and it’s how the professor feels students will understand the concepts the best— but they can’t cover every detail. The most fundamental thing however was doing research on the science of learning. I would say Make It Stick by McDaniel and Brown has been the single most important factor in my academics. Basically, it talks about how the get the most out of your studying. 

At the same time, embrace the struggle, analyze why it was difficult, and adjust your approach/strategy accordingly."
ApplyingToCollege,fok6mdi,t1_fok2ta2,1587836359.0,"Well if what you said was even true, write about that. Write about how you persevered through that. Ultimately admissions care about why you NEED to go to that school and how you’ve persevered through difficult times / handles stressful situations. If what you said is true, there’s no reason to lie.

Now if you were talking about lying about your grades, I’d give up on that right now. I mean do you really think you’d be the only person to do this? Top tier universities are worth billions of dollars. Do you really think they don’t investigate if documents are legitimate or not? 

So unless you’re Frank Abagnale or Eliot Anderson, just tell your story and don’t lie."
ApplyingToCollege,fok1z8h,t1_fojzxe1,1587833887.0,"Lol. I’m not sure where you want to apply to but hypothetically if you apply to a UC, you have to write some elaborate PIQs. Which means you’ll have to make up several elaborate essays which all tie together and are air tight. Personally, I don’t think you’ll be able to get away with it and the admissions officer will see right through it. But hey, if you lie and get in, maybe the uni would want someone with your writing skills. 

But like I said, at the end of the day, everyone around you would be brilliant academically and you’d know you don’t belong. I suppose if you could live with that, by all means.."
ApplyingToCollege,fojz986,t3_g7wbzr,1587832372.0,"Well it’d be a great way to get imposter syndrome. Assuming you get away with it and end up getting into a top tier school, everyone around you is brilliant but you’d know you’re only there because you lied."

4chan,fnwbuxf,t1_fnwaqp1,1587315396.0,"Well “X” is arbitrary. It could have been “l” or “m” or ‘theta.’ The x-component is somewhat unrelated. Looking at a triangle, you have the hypotenuse, the opposite, and the adjacent. The hypotenuse is composed of both the opposite and adjacent. Say you have the hypotenuse and want to find the displacement in the adjacent direction; in a unit circle, you’d use cos(X) to find the displacement in the adjacent direction and sin(X) to find the displacement in the opposite direction where X is the angle between the hypotenuse and the adjacent.

So, in an ideal situation, if jimmy travels a net distance of 1 km up the mountain, cos(45deg) will give you the distance he traveled horizontally while sin(45deg) will give you the distance he traveled in the vertical direction (in km). The x-component usually represents the horizontal distance."
4chan,fnwah55,t1_fnvgl4x,1587314634.0,Sometimes you have the angle and just need to find the x-component

TheoryOfReddit,fnu13s9,t1_fntz5cp,1587252502.0,"It’s gotten better (probably because of all the new awards you can give). But just a few years ago, if someone got gold for example, it was as if op would go through an existential crisis and un-ironically make several very long edits going on about how grateful they were about receiving gold. Then it became a circlejerk and later a meme. 

I’m glad to hear people mostly do it ironically now... or maybe I’ve just been wooshed for years haha"
TheoryOfReddit,fntqy4r,t3_g3vpqr,1587247044.0,"I think the first edit is typically okay. They’re just like thanks for the upvotes. But some people make 2, 3, sometimes 4 edits in caps about how they weren’t expecting so many upvotes or how they woke up and their inbox blew up... it’s obnoxious. Whether that reaction is justified or not I won’t argue."

linuxmasterrace,fn8h2ez,t1_fn8e0tn,1586741483.0,You’re right. There are too many columns and not enough rows. This problem in its current state is not solvable. An oversight
linuxmasterrace,fn895xw,t1_fn85sc0,1586736556.0,Yes. And the answer IS a 2x1 matrix. The the right of the equality is a 2 dimensional vector.
linuxmasterrace,fn7ybmq,t1_fn7wsoi,1586730089.0,"No. Once the multiplication happens, you add up the values in one row which becomes a column and add up the values of the other row which becomes another column. Also, the initial formula has nothing to do with the matrix other than the value for y. It can be solved using the exact equation technique."
linuxmasterrace,fn7kuzd,t1_fn7gkwx,1586722347.0,"Like I said, I accidentally put the vector to the left of the coefficient matrix. It should be in the right. Once they are switched, you vector has 11 rows and the matrix has 11 columns allowing for multiplication"
linuxmasterrace,fn13o2m,t1_fmz4dov,1586554151.0,Right. It just said that I would have to reboot the kernel to experience the new changes. I'm not sure how it works. I guess it's possible what I had available was loaded in my RAM. But that's a good question and I don't know the answer.
