UCSD,fh8r1a0,t1_fh8bxyk,1581365601.0,"If you look at our current teams there’s actually a wide range of “traditionally difficult” majors spread throughout each sport. There’s aerospace engineers, marine bio, bioengineering, computer science, computer engineering, and so many more. This also doesn’t discount the amount of work non-stem majors go through too. If you wanna fact check me the ucsd athletics website has the rosters with their majors :) 

It’s not an impossible thought and no one other than the athletes would understand what athletes go through. But I just want to point out just because there’s a population of people who can only focus on one thing, doesn’t mean that there’s isn’t a population of people who CAN focus on multiple things. I think it’s easy for people to dismiss athletes as people who choose easy classes because it’s a stereotype. But it’s harmful to just categorize a whole set of people’s experience based on previously learned and societally enforced misconceptions."
