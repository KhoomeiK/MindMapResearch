UCI,fnyq38h,t1_fnuylow,1587371421.0,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too hard to declare! I think you just have to take a couple classes to meet the lower div reqs or something but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs fine.

relationships,fn823dt,t3_g02d1o,1586732288.0,"Reading this made me SO sad. How can you let someone treat you like this‚Äîespecially someone that‚Äôs you‚Äôre partner, that‚Äôs supposed to love and care for you. Not only has he abandoned you on multiple holidays (made you wait in the freezing cold on new years?? vday dinner alone??? wtf??), but he literally kicks you out of you own home everyday. It‚Äôs even worse now that this is during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC and he‚Äôs being SO inconsiderate of your own health, but this behavior is ridiculous regardless. Plus, he makes you wake up at 8 am just for his calls?? Your entire life is literally revolving around his schedule and convenience.

I don‚Äôt understand why people are suggesting you should sit in the bathroom with headphones on for hours at a time. Even that‚Äôs ridiculous to me. If he needs privacy, HE can sit in the bathroom or go outside. That‚Äôs just common courtesy. The fact that he‚Äôs made this topic of kids/compromising these calls ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù is extremely manipulative. He‚Äôs guilt-tripping you by parading his image of ‚ÄúI love my kids so much and am a great dad‚Äù so that you feel bad and obligated to listen to his demands. 

Other comments have already detailed why they think he‚Äôs cheating, so I‚Äôm not gonna go over that more. I think it‚Äôs likely too, but even if he‚Äôs not, it really doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîbecause he‚Äôs being a jerk boyfriend either way.
You deserve so much better than this. You deserve someone who shows you love, cares about you, is considerate, and makes you a priority. You deserve to be able to live in your house normally and not be constantly stressed. You should be able to wake up according to your own schedule and not alter your life to the convenience of this guy. 

You shouldn‚Äôt put up with this selfish man who clearly does not care about your feelings whatsoever. He shouldn‚Äôt just be able to kick you out whenever he wants and then have you when it‚Äôs convenient. Even if his kids are important to him, you should still be another priority for him. Right now it‚Äôs like his ‚Äúkids‚Äù>>>>>>>>>>>>>>you which is not okay. 

Please, stop putting up with this. Stop letting him emotionally manipulate you and walk all over you. Stop bending to meet his ridiculous demands. You are special, unique, and amazing, and shouldn‚Äôt settle for anyone that doesn‚Äôt see and treat you as such."

UCI,fmzb5a6,t3_fwylyv,1586513677.0,"Social life at UCI is definitely available, but you do have to put yourself out there. Some different ways to make friends are:

1. The easiest/most common way to make a lot of friends your first year is through dorming!! Everyone is really friendly and also wants to make friends, so it‚Äôs not too hard. I personally live near UCI and am extremely happy and grateful that I dormed. Mesa Court Towers has the best social reputation I think (dormed in a diff area though).

2. Join a club/org!! I highly recommend doing this and this is a great way to make connections with people that are more likely to extend past one year. The cultural clubs are pretty popular here (like KASA/KABA/CA/VSA) and you don‚Äôt have to be a certain ethnicity to join (for example, KASA is a korean cultural club but a bunch of non-koreans join just for fun). There‚Äôs also really good dance teams if you like dance, sports such as dragon boat, clubs for different majors, community service clubs, and fellowship clubs depending on your interests! These are all really good social opportunities. In the fall, there‚Äôs a club fair with a the clubs and you can basically collect a bunch of flyers and start to check out clubs during the first few weeks and decide which ones you‚Äôre actually interested in.

3. Rush! If you‚Äôre interested in greek life, you can check out that. If not, there‚Äôs also a lot of professional frats on campus that provide brotherhood and professional develop (for business, engineering, nursing, etc.). There‚Äôs also a community service frat if that‚Äôs more interesting to you.

So basically, social life at UCI is pretty decent if you‚Äôre able to find a community/join a club/at least dorm. If you put in the effort, you‚Äôll be fine. However, a lot of people at UCI are somewhat local so campus tends to be pretty dead on the weekends sometimes. I have a friend that goes to Davis and really likes it, so I think it just depends on what you‚Äôre looking for out of your college experience."
UCI,fmzaibr,t3_fx2g0w,1586512926.0,"Business econ definitely has the reputation of being a harder major than bus admin at uci, but the opportunities are similar! All of the business clubs/orgs/frats on campus are open to bus econ and from what i‚Äôve heard, there‚Äôs not too much of a difference between the two majors when looking for a job. I know a lot of bus econ majors that were able to recruit for Big 4 accounting firms. The downside is bus econ major classes are harder and that the benefits of the bus admin program (some career fairs, counselors, MUSA (bus admin student council basically), nicer buildings, smaller classes), are not available for bus econ students."
OutOfTheLoop,fm9qrbj,t3_fthasw,1585874451.0,"Answer: Besides the points that have already been mentioned, Animal Crossing has been getting great free marketing on social media (mainly TikTok). Everyone‚Äôs feeds are full of videos about the game, how cute it is, funny videos about the characters, etc. A lot of teen to young adult people are more active on TikTok these days, so people have been talking about the game with their friends too. I know people that don‚Äôt have the game but know a lot about it solely through WOM or videos they‚Äôve seen on TikTok (I know Reddit doesn‚Äôt like TikTok, but it‚Äôs becoming a lot bigger lately). 

I also want to add that Animal Crossing is more appealing to people that don‚Äôt typically play games because it‚Äôs more of a relaxed, talking, customizable game that‚Äôs not super challenging. So there‚Äôs a much bigger audience for this game than there was for past AC games (AC wasn‚Äôt talked about so much, so the player base was a lot smaller because I think a lot of typical ‚Äúgamers‚Äù think AC is boring. Now that non-gamers know about it, there‚Äôs way more people interested. I know several people that have bought or wanted switches solely for this game). The timing was honestly perfect for AC because now even people that don‚Äôt game want it since everyone is stuck inside."
