nba,flzsf29,t3_frs8ca,1585632127.0,"Not me but a coworker of mine. Interned in Austin over the summer and he was part of some rec league through the UT campus. Played at their gym all the time. One day, KD randomly rolled in wearing a boot still recovering from his Achilles injury. 

Now, by normal people standards this guy is phenomenal. 6’ 3’’, lengthy, good BBIQ and athletic, regularly kicks my 5’ 8’’ ass. He sees KD in the boot and I guess buoyed by the confidence of being the best guy on the court up to that point says something like “I think I might actually have a fighting chance against you today”.

He couldnt have been more wrong. What proceeded was a 1s and 2s game to 21 where KD scored 21 while always having at least one foot on the ground. Of course this freak of nature is nailing every three and getting every shot he wants, but what my friend was most amazed by was how he could move the entire defense with just his eyes and a headfake. Solid rec league defenders absolutely put on skates by a man who didn’t even take a step. Really puts into perspective how these “humans” in the NBA are really on another plane of existence."
