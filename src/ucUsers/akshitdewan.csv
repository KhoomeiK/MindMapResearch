berkeley,fp8uq74,t1_fp8qmop,1588403639.0,cool I'll take a look! do you have one for the lecture?
berkeley,fp78ugh,t1_fp73ydt,1588366143.0,I don’t think this would affect every honest student equally. There’s certainly going to be people who spend a lot more time on this problem than others. There will also be people who get more stressed about the rest of the exam because of this problem than others who might find it easy to move on.
berkeley,fp788lw,t1_fp73wdw,1588365833.0,I’m guessing people are less likely to cheat on the bonus question even if they cheat on the rest of the exam

rutgers,fp0y2dp,t1_fp0w8k9,1588219539.0,Ohh okay that makes sense!
rutgers,fp0vl2s,t1_fov60kc,1588217911.0,any reason why you choose to use only the final exam to determine the number of A's as opposed to setting mastery-based bins for point totals in the class?
BostonU,fp0uxo3,t3_ganbfb,1588217490.0,He didn't make a post. He replied to a post about someone complaining about getting caught.
rutgers,fp0t8aq,t1_fowarkw,1588216395.0,"how do you suggest Chegg should check whether a student is asking a question they are allowed to ask or if they are cheating?

A comment on another post said, ""Chegg cooperates with universities and gives the names/identities of the people who uploaded the copyrighted documents by looking at their payment method (credit, debit, Paypal, whatever else Chegg accepts) to the universities."""
berkeley,foo6vg5,t1_foo65om,1587933660.0,"that makes sense. I wouldn’t go in thinking that you’re going to get a B though, especially because you have more time to dedicate to 70. Also, you can definitely decide about 61B after the summer based on how you do. 

If you end up needing an A-, I’d still recommend against waiting an extra year for Hilfinger and hoping his bins are easier. It’d probably be a better use of time to prep for the course in advance."

berkeley,foeiu36,t1_fo911kb,1587704903.0,"they're not countless pointless hours though. There's much less to learn after looking at the solution than from going through the problem-solving process. They also offer homework redos (where you can look at the solutions) once you've given the homework a fair shot.

Also, making a new homework set *is* a lot of work, especially if it's being done every week."

Conservative,fnw37km,t1_fnvuqlb,1587310519.0,"From what I’ve seen, people aren’t arguing that they don’t have a right to protest—just criticizing their choice to do so. Also, does this still fall under individual risk?"

berkeley,fnetpkp,t3_g08inf,1586895679.0,"""**MT 1/MT 2 => MT 3 “Reverse” Clobber:** We are also adding a “stop-loss” policy to protect someone doing well so far from failing the course due to some kind of crazy unexpected thing happening to them during the last exam. This policy gives you a “reverse clobber” for MT 3 of 40% using the average of the normalized MT 1 and MT 2 scores. So, if you pulled a normalized 90% on both MT 1 and MT 2, your effective normalized MT 3 score can’t drop below a 36%. This effectively stop-losses the exam component of your grade to at least a B if you earned As on the first two exams."""

berkeley,fmnxdwf,t1_fmnwzwg,1586238131.0,it would be nice if classes had more resources and time to prepare two different midterms
berkeley,fmnwolx,t1_fmnw2mb,1586237511.0,"imo there is way too much potential for cheating there. I think getting rid of the MT would be better than 24h midterm at least for 70 specifically, but that doesn't seem too practical either."
berkeley,fmnwecg,t1_fmnw242,1586237261.0,you're right. I think I was incorrectly generalizing my own experiences.
berkeley,fmnvev2,t1_fmnv36k,1586236407.0,"I was trying to reason based on where most students come from. I think at the very worst, it would be 4:00 - 6:00 am and the best Europe time should be 6:00 - 8:00 am."
berkeley,fmnqtn2,t3_fu0vl3,1586232747.0,Imo curves are convenient and kind of lazy on the Professor's part. They sort of assume that the distribution of knowledge will be the same year to year but that the difficulty of their tests will fluctuate. But Profs should be able to set boundaries based on what the students are expected to know rather than just speculating that only a certain percent of the students have mastered the material.

berkeley,fmn8c5c,t1_fmn7put,1586220348.0,Yeah it really sucks to have to change your routine around. Are you operating on your own time zone now or still PST?
berkeley,fmn822b,t1_fmmvezx,1586220177.0,Yeah I agree it’s a disruption but it seems like the best option. The 70 exam time actually seems the most reasonable across timezones since it’s early morning in East Asia and the 11PM at worst in the U.S.
