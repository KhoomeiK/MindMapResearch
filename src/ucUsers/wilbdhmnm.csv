ucla,fox6fw3,t3_ga0r0r,1588135240.0,"> we plan to offer the option of remote learning at least for fall quarter, even if some classes are held in person

I think this just means that even if classes are all in person, any student has the option to participate remotely. So like all in person lectures will also be Bruincasted and all assessments can be done remotely. 
Or that while some classes (like labs) are in person, many others (lectures) are still remote."

The more their work gets cited and the more “reputable” the publisher they go through, the better for the researcher. That’s the incentive for publishing in big journals and book publishers that they may never see any of the revenue from.
While academics can publish [open access](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) instead, it’s not seen as very reputable by their bosses, so it would be a bit of a sacrifice on the researcher’s part."
