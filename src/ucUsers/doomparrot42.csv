badhistory,fovetjd,t1_fovcx9u,1588100121.0,"You're painting this as a settled issue, when it's a topic currently under debate by scholars. Hans Ulrich Vogel argues that there is adequate evidence to believe that he did visit China. Frances Wood suggests that Polo only traveled as far as Persia, but Stephen G Haw, David Morgan, and Igor de Rachewiltz have all offered extensive critiques of her book. And in any case, regardless of what you believe about the truth of Polo's travels, his existence is demonstrable. Comparing him to King Arthur is just being provocative for no reason."

GradSchool,foerz9u,t3_g73b9l,1587712741.0,"Look into theory-oriented programs. UCSC's History of Consciousness and Stanford's Modern Thought and Literature might be places to start. You might try humanities departments, esp philosophy and maybe literature, that have faculty who focus on critical theory. Studying theology is a very different kind of thing and it sounds more like you're looking for a world religions angle to me?

Applying to grad programs in a different field is totally doable, as long as you can communicate your ability to work in this new area. But I also want to stress that you shouldn't be considering grad school without a clear-ish idea of what you want, and what you hope to get out of it. It's okay to take some time and figure things out. If there are faculty at your school who study something you'd be interested in pursuing, talk with them about grad school - preferably talk with younger and non-tenured faculty, as their experiences will be more relevant. You sound young and I would discourage you from jumping straight into grad school - a lot of people burn out, or just find that it's not the right path for them."
