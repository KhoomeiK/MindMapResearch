The USAC president is the most incompetent of them all. Seriously, how did this guy get elected? He's done a terrible job handling this whole situation and encouraging professionalism among the rest of the group. He's our student leader? He's done a terrible job all year. How could he lead an effort to raise student fees by $45 at a time like this? They should've shelved the whole thing, but now they're doubling down calling anyone who dares oppose a racist. I'm genuinely upset. Kelechi Iheanacho's speech was so insulting as well.

They want to try to label anyone who opposes their fee increase as a anti-\*insert group here\* in order to guilty everyone into submission. The truth is that they've been incrementally adding and adding to student fees for years with all these referendums, each with its own white knight or ""social justice"" spin so that students refrain from speaking out lest they be called racists or something, which is total crap. It's going to backfire on them when their best weapon is to pull the race card, even though for many students their opposition to this idea is about not adding to their existing financial burdens, and has NOTHING to do with race.

Many student belong to the groups they keep referring to and yet they still don't want fees increased. News flash for these ignorant council members: people of all background don't agree on every single thing. Are they going to call them racists, too?

It's disgusting that they are trying to frame things this way. They are essentially saying that voting NO = racist against black people, muslims, etc.

Overall, nothing was said to convince me that I should shell out another $45 every year. Their insensitivity and hostility to opposing viewpoints only makes me want to vote NO even more."
