assassinscreed,fpg3j5e,t3_gd9191,1588593142.0,"I accept the new games. But I think of them as spin offs from the original games. In my head it’s Valhalla: An Assassin’s Creed Story. Which is fine. Just not the original recipe, so I rename the rebrand. I honestly think the assassins creed title is holding Ubisoft back from creating better open world games."

supergirlTV,fpfjw0b,t1_fpfjrcd,1588573501.0,"I haven’t caught up past episode 14, but I’ll binge all of the cw shows 2nd halves when I get a weekend. Tbh Legends is the only one I’ve actually quit. Once they got to the second half of season 3, they just lost me. I’m glad a bunch of people like this season though, I heard season 4 for legends was sorta bad."
supergirlTV,fpfjgcv,t1_fpfjeti,1588573111.0,No worries. I agree 4 was really great and this season is a hot mess that slow burns for what seems like no payoff.

PS5,fp4jvak,t1_fp4jn14,1588300646.0,"From what I read when someone posted the game description earlier, it’s like Odyssey, one or the other. Personally, I would like them to just choose one already because Odyssey had crap dialog and 1 protagonist could fix some of that. If you want to make it a women, fine with me, but just commit to something. I’m someone who actually cares about the lore and modern day story and the last couple games just kinda bummed me out."
PS5,fp4j1sp,t1_fp4iyuv,1588300132.0,That one had small sections of the game where you could choose either. They made you do actions as both though. Odyssey was the first where you could go through the whole game as the gender you chose.

PS4,fp49yu1,t1_fp2egsd,1588294647.0,I wish they would officially call it Valhalla: An Assassin’s Creed Story. Like it’s not really similar to earlier titles but there is a common link.

choosemyalignment,fp0hq9k,t3_galfke,1588209504.0,"[CN] You need food. As an adolescent hunger is important to satisfy so you get enough nutrients to support hormone changes, bone growth, etc. From the sound of things, you are simply rationing for what I assume are budget reasons. As long as you aren’t taking what would directly be someone else’s food and making them starve, sneaking late night rations for your hunger is self serving but not evil."

I just feel like the characters are kinda watered down in a way and the plot is kinda meh. Plus with them getting rid of Routh and Ford my interest in the cast is down a lot. I wish Constantine could get his own show again man, I just don’t really like him on Legends. Season 2 was the absolute best of Legends for me."
