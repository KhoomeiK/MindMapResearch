Many, many people in the field have this geeky hyperfocus that results in long hours and poor social interaction.   Do you actually want a life like that?   If not, how do you feel about being in semi-competitive job situations with 40 people like that?

I left the software field when I realized that Dilbert is non-fiction."

Most people try to become lawyers for the wrong reasons; the level of disappointment for those in the first 2-5 years is quite high.  And a lot of that is driven by misunderstanding of what the practice of law is really like.   All of the things that you might ""do"" as an undergrad to theoretically increase your chances of admission or to improve your skills in advance of actual law school are relatively unimportant by comparison to whether you will ultimately be happy being a lawyer.   In my experience (30 years), having realistic goals and expectations is essential to finding satisfaction in the legal profession."
