UCSD,fdlrcz6,t3_elnafc,1578530667.0,WOW! When I went to UCSD 40+ years ago there were no parking structures and a parking permit was $36 and you just walked in and got one. People who did not want to pay could park out on Torrey Pines Rd along Muir and Revelle. I wish it was that easy for you guys!
