TownofSalemgame,fnwxi2z,t1_fnwefmh,1587327388.0,"If you play Dracula's Palace the only TIs are Lookouts, so you can claim whatever you want as witch. I usually have a Doctor will ready but am prepared to claim med if the TP claimspace gets full too fast. A lot of times you can get by on being quiet though. Quiet people get checked by vh but witch doesn't care if they get checked by vh, it actually helps witch to keep vh off vampires for a turn.  


I know a lot of these strategies would fall apart if town played optimally but in Dracula's Palace they really don't."
TownofSalemgame,fnwwztk,t1_fnw29s8,1587327101.0,Pretty much every time vamps win it's because witch or jester managed to kill the vh or witch managed to keep the vh from killing. Vamps should love witch!
TownofSalemgame,fnwjz8y,t1_fnwisi2,1587319831.0,Now that you mention it I've seen that too. I think I blocked it out because it was too traumatic.
TownofSalemgame,fnwhrgk,t1_fnvmrou,1587318614.0,"It's actually super fun. I've been playing it for about a week and I'm still having a lot of fun. I think it requires a little more creativity to figure out who the evils are, because once people start turning they can be within the claimspace and still be evil."
TownofSalemgame,fnwh5bb,t1_fnvqlwd,1587318284.0,It happened to me yesterday and the day before. In the one yesterday I was actually the jester who killed the vh. Not actually a vamp but it was still frustrating watching them play so badly when I helped them and was rooting for them.
TownofSalemgame,fnwfibk,t1_fnw62sn,1587317403.0,The problem arises when the vampires know who the witch is but they just don't realize they have majority and hang the witch to pretend to be town

TownofSalemgame,fnuehug,t1_fnttrt0,1587260271.0,"Very true, and I think the game would be a lot less interesting if people were smart. I only play Dracula's Palace these days, and I feel like if town played optimally vamps would never have a chance."
TownofSalemgame,fntt9ac,t1_fntspdx,1587248198.0,"Three situations are that he's a jester, he's an evil, or he's a game throwing town. First two are worth exeing and the third is even worth it a lot of the time. A game throwing town can do a lot of damage. Also you can't really assume people are game throwing townies or you'd never kill anyone"

Makes it sound like a Japanese motorcycle to me, like a Kawasaki. I don't think people generally care what country your bicycle was made in, so I don't think it would be mentioned. And 17 year olds can have motorcycle licenses."

UCDavis,fn4t5tn,t1_fn3ys94,1586648414.0,"From my understanding there's three types of car insurance.

Liability- This is what you're legally required to have.

Collision- This is what fixes your car if you crash and it's your fault.

Comprehensive- This is what covers your car if it gets stolen or vandalized.

You can have or not have the collision and comprehensive, but you need liability. When I was shopping the collision part was pretty expensive so I just got liability and comprehensive. I went to AAA and it was only about $700/year, about half of what other insurance companies were quoting me.  


I am in no way an expert at this, this is just what I saw when shopping for car insurance."

UCDavis,fn3ihbh,t1_fn2ex26,1586621408.0,I don't think you replied to the right comment. You can't whack through insurance.
UCDavis,fn2843o,t3_fyrpol,1586580518.0,"Make sure you have comprehensive insurance! It's surprisingly cheap, a lot cheaper than collision, and it covers theft. This happened to our Prius and we didn't have the insurance so we had to get a new car, the fix would have been more expensive than the car. The comprehensive insurance on our new car is something like $150/year

Edit: This is towards other Prius owners, not OP who had it"

unpopularopinion,fmqr2xh,t3_fws1e5,1586305238.0,The problem is that people are being given these loans at 18 years old when they don't know enough about the world to make decisions like that. People who just got the right to decide what time they go to bed are being given the chance to go hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. You can't expect every 18 year old who just got the privilege of being able to open their own bank account to make the most financially responsible decisions about school.

It's a class they're trying to make people take before ECS34 because they determined that ECS34 is too hard for people who have only taken ECS32A and B.  
I don't know how that class is going to help. The teacher is literally telling people to go watch YouTube videos if they want lectures. Someone brought up that they'd get more from an Udemy course for a lot less money, and all the teacher could say was ""But no one's gonna hire you because you took Udemy courses"""
