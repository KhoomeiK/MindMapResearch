ucr,fpjbyts,t1_fpii35a,1588663045.0,"I would still contact them for more info. In my case, my housing contract was canceled and I had moved out early April but was still being charged April and May rent. So my balance right now is about $1,000 but I’m actually supposed to receive a refund.

This is what they told me:

“Your Cares Act Emergency Grant of $500 should have been disbursed directly to you in the form of a direct deposit refund or a paper check instead of applied to your outstanding balances. Student Business Services will be reviewing your account to fix this issue.

Moving forward, they will be the department to assist you with this inquiry and provide you with further updates.”

SBS has messed up a lot throughout my time at UCR as far as not giving me refunds, charging me for late fees I shouldn’t be receiving, etc. There was one time where I didn’t notice a fee added on to my account for a whole quarter until I brought it to their attention and they fixed it, so email them ASAP for clarification."
ucr,fpihj4g,t1_fpfekpx,1588641030.0,"I just got a reply from financial aid confirming that yes, that grant money is supposed to go directly to our bank accounts or check in the form of a refund regardless of any outstanding balance. Apparently it was a mistake on SBS end. Thought i would update for you:)"
badroommates,fpg38mg,t1_fpfvyl2,1588592885.0,"in my situation they would leave their meat in the fridge- not the freezer or sometimes they would prepare some of it and literally forget it on the counter. What would usually happen is they would open a package of meat, use maybe half of it, and then leave it in the fridge without freezing it because they had no concept of food safety. I had to explain to them why raw meat couldn’t stay in the fridge for more than 1-2 days. One time my roommate bought a steak that was in one of those yellow styrofoam package thingies. For some reason he put it in the fridge sideways and forgot about it. I had left for a 3-day weekend and when I came back there was red liquid (im assuming blood) leaking over everything. I almost lost my shit and we had to throw away a lot of things and disinfect the entire fridge. Their argument was that their mom did it that way and they never had any issues....I bought my own mini fridge after that"
badroommates,fpfnmdw,t1_fpezxhu,1588576984.0,"Not really, we were friends when we first started living together and i tend to have a very no-nonsense attitude when it comes to things like that so I guess they knew I wasn’t going to give in. The most I got was this long text paragraph about how I was being *mean* but I just straight up told them they were being nasty af lol. They started locking their door but if it was closed I would put whatever nasty thing they left rotting in a plastic bag and hang it on their handle or put it right in front of their door on the floor. One time they brought “company” and had to explain why they had a bag full of rotting chicken legs hanging on their door LOL"
badroommates,fpeywah,t1_fpeym16,1588557944.0,"Ive done it before, probably about 4 times with my old roommate after getting tired of reminding them. First time they asked me to not do that again, ignored and I did it again lol. Afterwards they just stopped mentioning it to me and stopped buying meat they weren’t going to use that same day 👍🏼


Lock ur doors tho."
ucr,fp8b7nq,t3_gbyhk3,1588388011.0,Im really greatful for the amount im getting ($500) but I  understand why some people are frustrated. My family is considered “ middle class” to financial aid but thats only because my parents work really really hard non-stop and I kinda wish I would’ve gotten more because im also recently unemployed. My roommate who is getting $1000 is spending it on a new gaming system while im going to use it to help me cover some of my rent 😭😭😭
ucr,fp8apkr,t3_gby8fc,1588387672.0,I didn’t get any emails about the CARES act until recently so I’m actually grateful people were posting about it because I had no idea and I’m sure I’m not alone sooooo
badroommates,fozmrtk,t3_gaea4i,1588193266.0,Did you do anything about it or tell her off??? I have so many questions 😳
ucr,focxa1a,t1_fo8uso2,1587677091.0,"Theres professors doing that?? That doesn’t make sense because some classes, even tho they’re online are still taking place during the time they were assigned. So if you have a 10-11am lecture on zoom you might have another one from 11-12. I highly suggest if you or anyone knows about any professors doing this you report them to their department chair or the dean 😤"
ucr,fo8nhvu,t3_g5vhyx,1587600046.0,"I feel u. One of my proffessors is making us use like 3-4 different platforms to submit assignments, have a chat during class, take quizzes, etc. most if not all of those things can be done via ilearn, zoom, or google docs. You know platforms that are easy to use and functional. When students are obviously confused or can’t get access he gets upset and starts with his bitch attitude. He also wants our weekly quizzes to be proctored. Like wtf am i gonna have my mom take the test for me? Keep in mind they’re open notes, he says we can use our phones to look at our notes(???) but he doesnt want us to use our computers to look at the notes. It doesn’t make any fucking sense to me. Funny thing is, he’s a CS professor, and at this point its kind of obvious technology will fail sometimes. He also gets upset when students are 5-10 minutes late to class and refuses to let them into the zoom meeting. I understand since most of us are in the comfort of our homes it shouldn’t be an issue to get into class but shit happens. Literally NONE of my professors in my upper division classes act as entitled as this shitty intro to CS professor. It seems like some of these professors get genuinely upset that they no longer have the same control/authority over us. Being a professor should mean you want your students to succeed, you want them to enjoy the learning experience as much as possible. We’re in a fucking pandemic, people are literally DYING and I’m sure there are some things more important than making sure im not cheating on your shitty quiz. 

Sorry for the rant but JEEZE. I’m in CS006 btw. Ryan Rusich. Can’t stand that terrible pink little man."
ucr,fllbbif,t1_fll5wgg,1585257073.0,I’ve been calling them but I guess they don’t have full staff working atm so its just sending me to voicemail :( are u suggesting i cancel the contract now to show that im anticipating moving out?  And then just try to move out next weekend or so? I still have my keys so I still have access to the apartment as of now
