ucr,fpkw59n,t3_gdj252,1588702071.0,I expected this. Yeah everything is smoothening out but it’d be all for not if cases spike during flu season. We’d be back to square one and the entire year would be remote instead of one quarter.

Those extra 36 units will be used for 12 units(fulltime)/quarter for 3 quarters. I'll officially be a 5th year senior. As far as choosing, I chose not to apply for graduation when the time came knowing I had unit cap room to not do so."
ucr,fp2imst,t3_ga4h3p,1588262398.0,"Yup! After the aid differential, Glen Mor and Falkirk become only a couple hundred dollar difference. The same is true with all Residence Halls (Pentland, Lothian, and I believe AI also) in relation to campus apartments.

Expect a $1700/quarter increase to cover Res Halls in the form of a UCR grant. Also, it should be noted that Glen mor is furnished with the privacy of a single room, bathroom sharing with only 1 other person (and their significant other since you are cool and allow your roommate to do that)  and utilities included (no surchages for going over a cap)

That for me offset the cost."

ucr,fov3mv7,t1_fopdbol,1588094842.0,"Correct me if I am wrong, but the funding pipelines for all the clubs on campus goes through their hands. So stuff ""you may or may not wanna do now but never thought you'd want to across your college career, and other cool things/events/perks like this are predicated on the allocation of funding to do so. They are in control of this, within Wilcox's purview of course. I think they oversee the main concerts on campus as well. It's enough power to warrant light acknowledgement around campus also. Not to mention they are paid 'for their service' in part  by tuition from the homeless students as well."

ucr,fouv8oy,t3_g96o4t,1588090964.0,"Nah it's vice-versa, the lower percentage wont likely hurt your gpa. If you get a 10/10, you might just get an A and be removed from the distribution. The only thing that happens with regards to that 10/10 student is that the rest of the class is closer to you and its possible you don't get an A+. If that's the case, then well, you know that one HS meme ""Its not enough that I should win.."" that's you, in a good way."
lawschooladmissions,foquf9h,t3_g8zpl0,1588001016.0,"Awesome list.  I ran out of ways to compare Law schools. Right away, UT and BU/BC get a bump in my book. The 10y percentage is the same as the 15y for the Ivy's, which gives us a glimpse of the cost of ""prestige"" among those who graduated, pass the bar, and secured full time/long term positions.

Also, look at the STARK difference in medians among t25 and the remainder. 75%-100% Jesus! I am blanketing the top 25 white spots on your list. It really is one of these schools or bust for me now!

ucr,fohsqhj,t1_foh2h1d,1587771917.0,"Yes. You can only stay for the summer if you did the resigning. So basically the lease continues but the Summer is free. Since you cancel, you lose that perk. You'll have to move out and then back again at the beginning of the new contract. Also, you would be placed on the waitlist. Also, just for the record, it appears Fall quarter will be on-line as well.. Nothing official, but even if the COVID numbers go down, its flu season and having everybody go back runs the risk of a spike. At least, statistically speaking, another 100-250k people will die between now and Fall Quarter. You can safely expect Zoom lectures to continue till Winter 2021. Again nothing official but its likely."
ucr,fogkss0,t1_fofzgdk,1587753834.0,"If being at one campus over another prevented you from obtaining some knowledge that you were after, I'd say it would be more of a personal issue than it would be for the UC campus itself. If you rreeaaaalllly wanna be at Berkeley for example, it's as easy as contacting a faculty at that campus and collaborating on whatever project/research/ etc. As for quality of courses, the faculty at UCR graduated from top tier institutions.  The only difference, is the location, and a few niches on each campus that they excel at. Other than that, it's the same."

For me, last year of financial aid, and last year before I hit the unit cap so no breaks for me. For now I'm just gonna roll with the punches.
