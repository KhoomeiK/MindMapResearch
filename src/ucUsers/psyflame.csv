ADHD,fp3o3h0,t1_fp3mejm,1588282739.0,"At best, this statement is so broad as to be unfalsifiable; at worst, it's actively reinforcing negative stigma for no clear benefit beyond dropping a hot take on Reddit. If your goal is to promote alternative treatment paths for ADHD, you should rethink your approach from the ground up.

bona fides: I lived my whole life without meds and reluctantly accepted medication as an adult."
GearsOfWar,foxe5dr,t1_foxcd7g,1588141257.0,The grenade planting thing... ðŸ¤¯
ADHD,fosunbf,t3_g992jp,1588038398.0,"Yes, always, since I was a kid. And when I'm in a flow state, it's hard to stop myself from humming - often improvising over the chords to songs I know. Sucks for open offices... quarantine has really helped"
Xcom,forv68m,t1_fordpt1,1588019072.0,"I think it's more authentic to the situation your soldiers would find themselves in. If my opponents are supposed to be hyper-advanced aliens, and they just heard a bunch of explosions and gunfire next door, it's hardly a leap of imagination that they'd decide to lock all the doors and stand inside waiting for the enemy."
ADHD,forg4tj,t1_forf3lj,1588011657.0,"I completely get how embarrassing that would feel if I were in your shoes then... but OMG, how hilarious is it if you imagine knowing the whole story and seeing this from an outsider's point of view? This random insecure dude, still salty over a months-old arm wrestling contest, and he's following you around doing overweighted rehab exercises XD"
Xcom,folzoiw,t3_g84h8b,1587874413.0,"I had to restart the game, and, figuring the other two would be as hard, cheesed it by taking the android Dark Event and building Patchwork to exploit it. Pretty absurd difficulty spike - I think it's just a lack of polish."
berkeley,fohhfvu,t3_g7ghw3,1587766044.0,"I don't have much advice on how to become a transfer, but I can tell you I always loved working with transfer students. In my observation, they tend to be above average in maturity, kindness, and work ethic. You'll be in great company when you do transfer."
ADHD,fogaa66,t1_fog5acm,1587749999.0,"Methylphenidate is Ritalin. That absolutely blows that your med options are limited though, especially since people respond so differently to different ones :\"
berkeley,fog47wo,t1_foe8ikn,1587747661.0,"Yeah, but right now we have the chance to build a housing complex over the park, which means we can decide what the solution looks like. Nobody is going to tear down this building to make it less alienating later. The point is that when you invest in development, you need to get it right the first time."

ADHD,fo00o9g,t1_fo0056m,1587404021.0,Let her tell you how much weight to put on situations. It's really frustrating for me when people think they can help me process my own mental state just because they happen to be neurotypical.

Oxygennotincluded,fn6wq9w,t3_fldu89,1586708847.0,Great work! This is the first concise and correct pipe mechanics explainer I've seen. Liked it so much I checked out the rest of your infographics - I especially found the flowchart/graph view at the beginning of the build guides to be a helpful summary
Oxygennotincluded,fm9f1ma,t3_fh2057,1585867405.0,I'm interested in the same thing - would be cool to get together as a community and put together a nice flowchart.
