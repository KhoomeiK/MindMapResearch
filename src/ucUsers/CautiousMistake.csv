Im a transfer, so I would have only had 2 years at UCLA anyways buy now its been cut even shorter and I had my last class without knowing it. I left without knowing I would be staying home the whole quarter. I'm stuck in a lease and have to pay it still. 

But just know that this won't last forever. You won't feel like this forever. Better days are ahead for us. The entire world right now is struggling so much and we're all affected by this terrible pandemic. Humans are adaptable though. We are resilient and we are strong.  Hang in there :)"

I certainly did and it has paid off for me in so many ways. I am not the same person I was before I went to UCLA (for the better.) It has changed my life. I am more confident, social, and have gained extremely valuable connections and have had amazing experiences. I went from being absolutely terrified of going to LA and leaving my sheltered life at home to finding my groove and now missing UCLA. 

Look at it this way - the time you're at in your life now, is the time you take risks; if you're awarded the privilege of being able to take a risk. Because even if you completely screw up and everything falls apart, you can STILL recover. You're young enough. Opportunities like this don't come upon everybody. 

Really take a second and think about what you're truly afraid of. It sounds like you're majorly concerned because of UCLA's status. Do not let that scare you. You got in for a reason. You belong. Please remember that now, and when you get to UCLA if you do declare there. Or wherever you go. I firmly believe that you actually know what you should do here. Good luck"
