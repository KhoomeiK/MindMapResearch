LegendsOfRuneterra,fmk32w6,t1_fmju9d5,1586143364.0,"I play mostly noxus/pz aggro so I’m a little biased, but Frenzied Skitterer deserves a nerf. I’m not a game designer so idk how they could fix it, but the card does too many things, it’s too splashable, and there’s barely any counterplay.

Turn 3 vs SI (or 4 if you’re attacking on evens) means you’re almost always forced to open attack, because otherwise you lose your entire attack.

And then if you do choose to open attack they can just keep it in hand for next time you get an attack, or just use it next turn to fearsome over your blockers.

The closest card that can shut down turn 3 attacks as well is Used Cask Salesman, but it 1) sucks on the attack turn  2) requires you to have two open unit slots 3) doesnt have fearsome 4) is only a 3/2 5) isn’t a SPIDER. It’s not even close to the same power level."
