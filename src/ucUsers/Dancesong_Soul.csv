SapphoAndHerFriend,fovta3w,t1_fovdbxj,1588107142.0,"The main issue I have with this is I don't believe anyone saying ""Sapphos of Lesbos was a lesbian"" is saying she wore flannels and attended pride parades. Nobody is saying that she was a modern lesbian and lived the same way lesbians live today, just that she was a woman who loved women, what we call a lesbian. I agree that it is important to remember that people lived very differently in the past than we do today and we cannot project our modern cultural norms and values onto ancient societies. However, I feel like saying we can't call a historical woman who loves women a lesbian because women who love women acted/were treated differently  thousands of years ago feels more like stubborn academic rigidity than practical discussion even if I understand why one might do so."
