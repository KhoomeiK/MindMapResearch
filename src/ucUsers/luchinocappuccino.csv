todayilearned,foszjkc,t1_fos68fb,1588041364.0,"Yeah, the more I think about John Brown, the weirder it was how I learned about him. It was like he was just this terrorist guy stirring up shit for no reason. But he basically was willing to die for the abolitionist movement because he saw no one was doing shit about it. The way they painted him was he was almost worse than the slave owners/killers themselves lol. US history is so wack."
todayilearned,fosyhn1,t1_fostwho,1588040714.0,"Anyone who gets a chance should visit Channel Islands National Park. You have to take a boat ride that’s like 40+ mins, but then if you go on a volunteer/ranger guided tour, they’ll tell you about the Chumash people who called the islands home, how the ocean resources led them to be sought-after trading partners with other natives. It’s fantastic to hear about people who lived here for hundreds to thousands of years before Europeans."
COMPLETEANARCHY,fopo996,t1_foo6xma,1587966980.0,"Hey, a lot of us who are white collar now are still working class—the fruit of their labor is still exploited. Not to mention, even though they are doing a lot better than most, some of them still had to struggle to get into that position, and they ultimately realize that the barriers that they faced in that struggle were largely bullshit, so they will still support the cause."

They already have their rights, and they’ll tell you your time will come. As I see it, that’s just a slyer way of saying, “fuck you, I got mine”"

baseball,fogn2fi,t1_fogd3ev,1587754658.0,"Yup. Yup. I was on the live thread and everyone was worried why kershaw was on.

If you’ve been sticking to a formula that has been working for the second half of the season and resulted in tying a Dodger win record, why are you getting cute and doing things you’ve never tried before? I know Doc gets defended a lot on our sub, but that was just a boneheaded move."
news,foeuy5x,t1_foe23rt,1587715643.0,"Yeah, I’m kinda with you. If that were the case, CA would be getting hit extremely hard right now. Just doesn’t make much sense if we already had the worst of it. We’d be a statistical anomaly"

Dodgers,fod63do,t3_g6jiej,1587680525.0,"Yeah, I feel you. I was so stoked when they got to the WS. My pops had always taken me to games so when they got to the WS, I thought I’d return the favor, especially since he had gotten sick recently.
Like most of us that went to a game, I spent a lot of money. Such a great experience at crucial moments. We saw Kike tie it up and the usher was high giving us and we were hugging maybe some of you on this subreddit lol. The stupid ump got in the way, the missed Puig catch...I talked to another Dodger bro at the end and he said, at least we saw a great game. Most people aren’t so lucky. I accepted it as a well-played game vs the astros.

Then game 5 rolled around and in my gut something was off because how rare is it to see two teams go back and forth like this in the WS for two games and have the same team come out on top? 

Now we know. I feel so cheated as most of you do too. I’m glad I spent time with my family but I feel robbed of my experience. It wasn’t a good game. They just cheated their way to a WS win. We got cheated out of a WS win in LA."

I actually love being busy and productive, but I’m also aware capitalists reap the benefit of my labor whilst simultaneously contributing nothing. Plus, most capitalistic labor is busy work with shitty purpose. I’d rather my work impact my own curiosity or my community"

SandersForPresident,fn7bk9r,t1_fn70358,1586717093.0,"I always upvote Dr. Chomsky.

The amount of people that haven’t caught onto this so far is staggering. Neither party gives a fuck about the common person. Dems  might throw you a bone if you’re LGBTQ or non-white, but ultimately they’re just trying to pretend they care. 

Prediction: I highly doubt the Dems will do anything about the kids in cages. They might move them to cells though. And then it’ll be hush-hush and business as usual"
nursing,fn3ophx,t1_fn3ecpi,1586624933.0,"As a Californian a lot of us feel the same. The best economy out of all the states voted for Bernie Sanders meaning we want M4A...but southern states hate socialism...even though through federal funding CA gives them more than [we] receive anyway. Makes no sense.

Was also very happy with CA response of shutting down early. The governor also didn’t sugarcoat it and nervously admitted that the reality is that we’re gonna he shutdown for a while because of what the scientific community was saying. But it’s better to have the truth that you don’t wanna hear and take action than pretend nothing is going on and get destroyed by something that could have been mitigated."

But now that the only “acceptable” candidate is out, looks like a pandemic, getting told that people need to die for the economy, and ignoring science and logic for power grabs leads me to conclude that the hope of change within the system is bullshit at this point.
Fuck the state, fuck fascism, fuck anti-intellectualism, fuck nationalism, and fuck any other -isms that puts money and power over people and the environment."
Yosemite,fmmu38e,t1_fmmgjzi,1586212105.0,"Ooof. Yeah, this virus has thrown everyone for a loop. 
Even if it’s not a work trip, I hope you can get a week off or so and at least explore the Sierra Nevada. Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia are just a few of the gems of the West Coast.

I live south of San Jose, CA, near the coast. We also have coastal ranges with Redwood forests nearby. Idk if you’ve explored CA much but for nature lovers it’s fantastic. It is pricey, but it’s also incredibly scenic."
