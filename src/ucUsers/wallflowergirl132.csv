Advice,fpjfjte,t1_fpik0ua,1588666634.0,"I think I can sum it in a couple sentences.

You go back because the person who hurt you and the person you love feel different. Most abusers if not all show their partner some kind of affection, a token of kindness and you cling onto that. Then in your mind theres a jekyl and hyde situation , but that person you love is still there so you keep going back hoping the monster never comes up again, but obviously it always will."

depressed,foj3161,t3_g7pnkx,1587806367.0,"I mean, so what if it means nothing in the grand scheme. I know my life means something to only a few people and life is generally pointless. But so what. It only has to mean something to you. You say that whether you do something or do nothing it doesnt matter but matter to who? The universe? I'm pretty sure the universe cares because you're a little piece in its web and every piece matters so matter how small. Being small in the grand scheme of things doesnt meam youre worthless. Life may not have meaning. You may live your life and it wont change the world but so what. Do what you want, what makes you happy or things that you enjoy. I find life to be incredibly exhausting, when I fall into my depressive episodes, life itself is SO exhausting, it's just so much work honestly but you know what, feelings dont last forever. I've been clinically depressed close to a decade but that doesnt mean that in all that time I never felt happy or joy or pleasure in small things. I'm just trying to say, it doesnt have to matter. Live your life because you can, the only person it has to matter is you. So what if you're just a blip in the timeline of the universe. So am I. So are all of us. Life doesnt nees a reason to exist, it just does. So do you"
