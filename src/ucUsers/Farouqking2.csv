ApplyingToCollege,fp6pnyk,t1_fp6iivt,1588356429.0,"Immediately after reading the first couple words of this comment, the song “Murder on My Mind” started playing in my head."
APStudents,fp51js1,t1_fp51evl,1588313373.0,"No, I signed up for the “Exam Only” section which means that I’m not taking a class for AP Chem, therefore, I do not have access to AP classroom material as I am not in a class. I’m self-studying the course."
ApplyingToCollege,fp1x9ml,t1_fp0jxee,1588250307.0,Damn he just pulled an Avatar: The Last Airbender on us.
ApplyingToCollege,fp19rbk,t1_foyuti6,1588228555.0,"I mean if everyone is doing it, I don’t think colleges would see it as that special. As some people have said, these organizations are primarily funded by parents, so again, nothing special there. If I was an AO and I saw an applicant with a self-made organization that’s “helping the poor”, I honestly wouldn’t be impressed as it is probably a small project. However, if it was an organization that actually became popular and successful, I would be very impressed."

AmItheAsshole,fo8o3pc,t3_g60p4a,1587600396.0,"Everyone’s ass. Put down all this pettiness, even though they did you wrong by cropping out your signature and whatnot, don’t step down to their level and pursue legal action. If someone was going to write an article about this and post it, what do you think the headline would look like? Obviously given the circumstances with the injured girl and her need to have surgery, that headline will not look good and it may stick with you for several years. Do you really want to be the reason why her go fund me gets shutdown and then she can’t have surgery? This is a life changing moment for that girl, and she really shouldn’t be paying that price for using your painting. Just be nice to the people around you and people will be nice back."
NoFap,fo8lqos,t3_g62xzh,1587599037.0,"For fapping, I think as the days go by, it becomes more and more difficult; however, at a certain point, you stop noticing. I think the first step is easy, it’s just the next couple steps that are really difficult. For success in general, taking the first step is always the hardest step — you’re putting yourself out there."

ApplyingToCollege,fnqtcgr,t1_fnqnliw,1587171785.0,What’s different between the 9% and the rest?

BlackPeopleTwitter,fmy79kp,t3_fxu1j6,1586479645.0,That logic is flawed in so many ways that I just stopped counting.
ApplyingToCollege,fmxtyzo,t3_fxxy6q,1586471822.0,"I wouldn’t publish. Your discoveries aren’t novel in anyway, and could potentially skew the American mindset of how severe this disease is. My brother is completing his masters creating population graphs impacted by disease etc., and it took him 3 weeks with over thousands of lines of code to produce a graph that is semi-acceptable. This field requires a lot of work and effort, and simply using two sources and thinking you have made a novel discovery can make you look poorly in front of the admission officers considering wait list applicants. If I were you, I’d learn a new computer language; C++ is impressive as it is a low level computer language, meaning that it is complex and requires a lot of effort."

JusticeServed,fm8cch6,t1_fm8a5yp,1585846803.0,"Well, this video is taken out of context. The person who got busted by the FBI bought these masks in 2009 legally, and now he’s being robbed of them in 2020. To put it bluntly, this person, whether or not he was hoarding these masks, is being robbed."
