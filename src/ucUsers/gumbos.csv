Benzos and clonidine can go a long way to help, but tapering is the safest for people at risk of seizures. Like I originally said, there is a reason that hospitals stock alcohol in their pharmacy and give it to the severely addicted.

Pharmaceutical withdrawal is possible, but should be done under medical supervision, not alone in a hotel room."
sanfrancisco,fpkimq2,t1_fpkgo2o,1588695364.0,"There is no medication that can allow a severe alcoholic to safely withdraw, besides alcohol itself. There is a reason that alcohol is in every hospital pharmacy."

I have no idea if this is true or not, but what land owner in their right mind wouldn’t have sold this plot to a developer 20 years ago?"
sanfrancisco,fovf7lf,t1_fovdiyx,1588100303.0,"I don't have any evidence of this, I just thought that it seemed weird for it to still be there if there isn't something going on like that. Maybe the Feds won't allow a tall building there or something, because of some security thing?"
sanfrancisco,fovc5ww,t1_fov67aa,1588098860.0,I think the Mint being behind this place has something to do with why it is stuck in the 1950s. It would be great if it was just a clone of the Whole Foods building across the street.
sanfrancisco,fokckis,t3_g7phv4,1587839544.0,"I do think these numbers may be misleading. Due to the density of SF, people can get their essentials within a small distance. It is a short walk from anywhere to a park. Most people can SIP successfully without driving at all."
moderatepolitics,fo5op2y,t1_fo5nlzd,1587531109.0,"The LA county study has the same authors as the Santa Clara study. It also has not even been published on a pre-print server, only press releases."
UCSC,fo236zj,t1_fo1bz9u,1587448336.0,I’d imagine it’s closer to 4 decades
AskSF,fo0malx,t1_fo06hgv,1587415685.0,"I have ordered from them twice. The quality is better, these prices are great. This is the same stuff you would be buying at Bi-Rite or similar. Before all of this they were a primary provider to fine dining restaurants in the bay. 

Check out their instagram, they regularly have posts introducing the local providers of their seafood and meat."
AskFoodHistorians,fnw0e0o,t1_fnvzje5,1587308841.0,Yup it would have been mostly sour-ish ales around 3.5-4%. I think British cask beer is probably the closest thing around today.
sanfrancisco,fnfda77,t1_fnesvul,1586905880.0,"I saw a handful of people walking the streets (in household groups) drinking on Easter, dressed in what I presume they would have worn to Dolores Park for the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence show. I suspect something similar will happen for Pride."
politics,fmu7b63,t1_fmu3f0j,1586385910.0,"That is literally the point of having an intelligence apparatus... to find out about things being hidden by others, and to get ahead of things. That part worked, the response to the intel was the failure."
politics,fmrdh4x,t3_fwyod1,1586320086.0,I've been wondering how long it would take for China to pull a Russia. They have a lot of incentive to do so.
bayarea,fmdprh2,t1_fmdpjhq,1585974265.0,"I agree, but lay people are going to be wearing N95 due to lingering particulates, not oily smoke. In which case it’s fine. But also you are right and nobody wears them right anyways and so they are useless."
