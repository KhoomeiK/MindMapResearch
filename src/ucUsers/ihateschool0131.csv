Though cmu has an AI major, it’s a title and you can take AI classes at Berkeley. I definitely vibed with Berkeley more (I understand y’all cant visit this year which sucks) and it has not been cutthroat to me. cmu has very intelligent people but I personally wanted a college experience with a football team and more flexibility than cmu could offer. However, I’m sure you’ll succeed at either school!"

legaladvice,foshhif,t1_fosh0hf,1588030802.0,We'll try to see what we can do. The issue we thought the lease was cancelled last week and they hit us with this today so we have 2 days to get the money to them and none of us live anywhere near the college lol. Was really hoping because they offered and we accepted it was over. Thanks so much for your input I really appreciate it!

berkeley,fo7re6q,t3_g63vf4,1587583241.0,I’m waiting personally. Don’t have the money to waste if the semester gets cancelled.
berkeley,fo1yioq,t3_g57kyj,1587444623.0,"this was my choice last year, can’t talk about business but I personally liked the environment of Cal a lot more. Both schools get a “depressing” rep but i found cmu to be more so when I visited. Could’ve just been the ppl I talked to of course but that was my take"
ApplyingToCollege,fnt4crg,t1_fnswtwn,1587234373.0,Good luck on the Berkeley waitlist!
ApplyingToCollege,fnrhmsz,t1_fnq31cy,1587189223.0,disclaimer: Berkeley cs student buttttt because Berkeley is cheaper and because you seem pretty set on cs I would lean Berkeley. I’ve heard the cs program is much better than LA’s (of course it’s going to be harder though).
ApplyingToCollege,fmhem2o,t1_fmge5ne,1586076950.0,Engineering student at Berkeley here! It is hard curriculum wise but I would not say it’s cutthroat. Imo Berkeley as long as you’re willing to put the work in!
