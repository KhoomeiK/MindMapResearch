UCSantaBarbara,fozcegm,t3_ga00sy,1588188311.0,"I agree that you should probably live in a university apartment so that you could connect with other transfer students. However, I didnâ€™t really make many friends while living in apartment a for two quarters(one quarter at San Joaquin one at Sierra Madre) because a lot of my roommates were shy, quiet, and some had work so itâ€™s not always easy to find someone who just get along right away. When you moved out, thereâ€™s a big chance people wonâ€™t talk to each other as much anymore. But I hope you make a lot of friends and have a good time because now I feel like I havenâ€™t really made any good friends and my UCSB life is already halfway through ðŸ˜ª"

UCSantaBarbara,foj75q9,t3_g7oqkh,1587811064.0,"Yes you can choose to live in one of the university-owned apartments. The details are all on the housing website. I highly recommend Sierra Madre, which is where I live rn. Great amenities and plenty of parking available. Itâ€™s the furthest from the campus but still not too bad if you bike or bus (bus stop right in front). San Joaquin is fine if you donâ€™t have a car but it could be cramped with six people(normally) in it. DM me if you have more questions!"

UCSantaBarbara,flzzh3b,t1_flzwm42,1585638876.0,"Itâ€™s likely that you will be be relocated to either San Joaquin or Sierra Madre, at least from what Iâ€™m hearing. Youmight have housemates but you should get your own room tho."
