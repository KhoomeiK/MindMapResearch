UCSD,fnka474,t1_fn8qsq9,1587019722.0,"lmao i’m from america and i feel attacked by this. imagine you went to school in China, you’d probably hang out with the Americans cause you might feel less intimidated.

even more, imagine you have to take an exam in chinese. like chinese isn’t your first language, and imagine trying to figure out a confusing ass physics word problem in chinese. 

long story short international students have it hard, PLUS once they graduate they need to get a job asap cause they need a company to pay/sponsor their visa. cause ucsd won’t sponsor then once they graduate.

put yourself in their shoes, let them live. 
they have enough to worry about without the americans around them judging them.

TLDR: imagine you were going to school in china: exams in another language are an extra burden. then imagine all the chinese students were judging you for wanting to hang out with americans."
