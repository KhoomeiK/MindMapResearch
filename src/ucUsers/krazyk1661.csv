FuckYouKaren,fph315w,t1_fph2fk4,1588614078.0,"Cmon, you honestly believe terrorizing a government building is a right? They aren’t members of a well-regulated militia and are demanding people obey them even though they are in the minority. It’s really messed up and definitely domestic terror."
FuckYouKaren,fpe7gsw,t1_fpe4q0c,1588541879.0,"When armed protestors dissented in the “whiskey rebellion” George Washington had them all shot. He was not about letting people protest his decisions while holding firearms. Honestly, any fool walking up to a courthouse with a gun SHOULD be shot on site. They only have 1 goal, and that’s to terrorize the government."
FuckYouKaren,fpe6oln,t1_fpe4q0c,1588541433.0,"Viruses weren’t discovered until the 1890s, the founding fathers owned slaves, and only land owners were allowed to vote. The founding fathers didn’t give a fuck about civilians and would have let them all die of plague. Caring about citizen health only dates back to the days of FDR. 

Also, by serving in the Marines, you signed away your right to choose anything about your health during that service. The US military is allowed to give you whatever drug or treatment it deems necessary, which is why there’s a special provision to speed up drug development that bypasses the FDA if you skip animal testing and test on humans in the military. Think “Quikclot combat gauze”. It came out of the same lab I worked with and was never tested on animals, just soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4harb,t1_fp4f7pq,1588299039.0,"If you knew how to spell it you would have. Not spell checking your work is lazy and means you either don’t understand the subject matter, don’t care about the subject, or have so little regard for the people grading it that you’re willing to be lazy. Misspelling benzyl as benzyll in a manuscript sent for publication can get it rejected. Knowing and using the correct significant figures is just as important. You all understand that using too few or too many sig figs costs points, so the same is true with spelling. If you want a perfect grade, then you have to be perfect. Stop bitching about minutiae when the TA is doing the job the way they were told to. Ask the professor to regrade, and watch your grade plummet from all the errors the TA “ignored” to save you points. They are on your side, but you have to give a damn and you have to try."
UCSantaBarbara,fp4dlan,t1_fp4cmtd,1588296780.0,"Well yes, you’re in college and that’s an incorrect answer. Is coffee spelled covfefe? Do you eat hamberders? Did you graduate from middle school? You should know how to spell words correctly. If you want to sound educated, learn how to spell words correctly on professional documents and exams."
UCSantaBarbara,fp48f0x,t3_gb34s8,1588293766.0,"Chem Postdoc here... The gen chem TAs were put in an impossible situation. Many of them are in their first year, some have never taught it before, and the prof basically told them to make a class on their own without guidance. They are putting in more hours than their contract stipulates and thus paid less than minimum wage, all while having to take their own classes which are intense PhD level courses with more work than you can ever imagine. Everyone is struggling, please be kind and grateful that they aren’t on strike during the pandemic. 

As for professors, the vast majority have had to redo all of their lectures to be online. I’ve done this before, and it takes on average 12 hours to create 1 hour of lecture... on top of that they all have PhD students, grants, and employees in their labs to take care of. Many also have grade school age children at home that they now need to homeschool. Everyone is struggling, and aside from campus office workers, everyone is working more than the undergrads. The constant complaints made my P.I. break down in tears the other day, so be nice, and thank them verbally.

If you want to complain, tell the deans and chancellor Yang. They are the ones putting us all in this mess without appropriate tools."
TwoXChromosomes,fp12qdt,t3_gagsyh,1588222810.0,"Bring a civil suit against him. Ruin his life, force him out of town. I guarantee you’re not the only one, so fuck his career up from bad PR. Unfortunately, he’s most likely done this over and over and over And belongs behind bars/ paying off a civil suit/ losing his house and family."
NoStupidQuestions,forxroh,t3_g95714,1588020368.0,"We have a special section of the visual cortex dedicated to human facial recognition. Interesting things about this region is that it develops based on who you’re exposed to early in life, and some people have the disability called “prospagnosia” where they are incapable of using this area.

All mammals have this area to some extent within their own species but... if say, infant monkeys are raised by humans, then they’ll recognize humans better over other monkeys. Even stranger, a man in Australia suffered a stroke and lost the ability to differentiate human faces, yet, he was a Shepard and gained the ability to differentiate sheep faces as if they were human."

AskReddit,foancoi,t3_g6hgtn,1587649564.0,"My stepmother was a Karen, and her name was also literally Karen. Examples of her Karen-ness are as follows...

She once drove back to a grocery store to yell at the manager for being shorted a single penny...

She screamed at me to get off the stage during the school play “Cinderella” that I was in because it was sexist...

She took us out of school and tried homeschooling us for a couple weeks because our teachers were too stupid compared to her...

She had a big shoe box full of expired coupons and would get mad everytime a grocery store worker didn’t honor them...

She ALWAYS had to sit in a booth and there was always something wrong with her food when eating at a restaurant, etc etc.

She truly was awful and I’m so glad I don’t have to deal with her ever again!"

catapult_memes,fo39ovc,t1_fo2v8c1,1587483125.0,"They don’t show the trebuchet in the post. The original video is actually a trebuchet using a counterweight... not a catapult using torsion...

UCSantaBarbara,fmm1x5a,t3_fw2get,1586197267.0,"They will never give you back your money. TPS said they’d reimburse parking passes for the lost months, direct you to the website and email, then send a reply back saying the office is closed and they can’t refund reimbursements at this time.

You could all go on a tuition strike together and just not pay them..."
