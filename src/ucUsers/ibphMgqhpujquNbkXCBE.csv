I've said this elsewhere, but this is true regardless of whether there's an unsolvable problem on the exam.

I'm not forgetting that. I'm just recognizing that short of telepathy, these are the best ways we have of judging someone's knowledge. Unfortunately, there's no discernible difference between your home situation and one where somebody hasn't learned anything. I don't think that sacrificing the validity of everyone's P grades this semester is worth it for the few who are in this situation. Keep in mind that I was an advocate for mandatory P/NP, so I don't want you thinking I don't care about people who aren't in the optimal position to be attending school online.

I agree that an incomplete is a better solution than a NP for people who can't do the work for whatever reason this semester, so professors should certainly be open to this idea, but I still don't think universal P is necessary."

No, I don't think we need universal pass. Default P/NP is sufficient for most people's needs. A NP grade won't affect your GPA, and you can retake the class once you're in a better situation to do so. I want to support students who are in unimaginable circumstances right now, but I don't think we should be giving out P grades to people who haven't learned enough to pass, regardless of _why_ they haven't learned enough.

berkeley,fp4ce9o,t1_fp4b2ze,1588296071.0,"Yeah, I don't see why they need to be ""playing with the distribution."" They should be setting absolute thresholds for performance for each grade. If more students than expected get great grades, then great, they taught really well and should make the course a bit more challenging next time. If fewer than expected meet the thresholds, then there's a problem with the way the course is being taught and they need to fix that.

Curving is just a way of papering over low-quality teaching. Aiming for a 40% mean and 10% SD or whatever on exams gives people an opportunity to learn only 50% of the material and still get an A. If you're having trouble fitting all the course material on an exam, then you shouldn't be relying on it for >75% of the grade.

That goes for all classes. Some professors are more opinionated than others. If being exposed to opinionated people offends your sensibilities, then a university is the wrong place for you. If the standards of scholarship in a class aren't to your high standards, write a paper that refutes their viewpoints with a higher standard of scholarship.

I don't think they would throw out your application, but you're going to have a bit of a harder time. From what I understand, F1 visas do not authorize you to work off-campus, so you have to find someone willing to sponsor you for the H1B or something similar. Not many companies are willing to do that for a 12-week internship, but if you're really good, the larger companies might do it.

It seems that OPT would be your best bet, since it seems the CPT has to be approved as part of a curriculum, and Berkeley doesn't have a Co-op program as part of the curriculum. Also, the OPT has a 17-month STEM extension, so that's your last two summers and you still have five months after graduation to find a job.

Where the ""implicit"" curve comes in is that they can always move those bins down if they want, so they make assignments harder than they think they need to, and then adjust the bins at the end to get the distribution they want.

In other words, the classes always get the grade distributions they want, but some do that by explicitly curving and some do it by adjusting bins downward."

Take one tech and one breadth over the summer, and try to enjoy yourself. You'll still be way ahead of everyone else, and you'll avoid getting burnt out before you even start for real.

On the other hand, if you're brilliant and you can handle it, don't let me stop you. I subscribe to the ""If you have to ask, you can't handle it"" philosophy, so again, take what I have to say with a grain of salt."
berkeley,foe0ne7,t1_foe0b5o,1587693722.0,"Yeah, they're fine together. In fact, they're mostly designed to be taken together, and complement each other well. I'm not sure I would do it over the summer, though, especially if they fall in the same session."
berkeley,fodyvx7,t1_fody6tm,1587692750.0,"Yeah, then go for 61A for sure. If you can get a breadth in during session A or B, do that too, so that you can get over the 6 units required for financial aid. I wouldn't recommend the earlier sessions, since you don't want to be trying to start a new class in the weeks before the 61A final."
berkeley,fodyaxo,t3_g6vonh,1587692434.0,"I mean, maybe you're different, but I wouldn't go over four individual classes, regardless of how many units they take up. There's a point at which there are too many little things to keep up with. And 17 units is a lot.

I also subscribe to the ""If you have to ask, you probably can't handle it"" philosophy, though."
berkeley,fodxilh,t3_g6yg7i,1587692007.0,"I'm a transfer, so take this with a grain of salt, but taking 61A the summer before my first fall here was the best decision I could have made. So many classes are directly or indirectly dependent on 61A, so taking that first gives you a lot more options for your first year. If you plan it right, you could be done with your lowerdiv CS requirements your first year, and from there, the department is your oyster.

There might be some less costly options out there as well, though. Have you taken care of your math requirements? If you were to do a 1A/1B/53 equivalent at a CC over the summer, that might be just as good in the long term.

For reference, many people do just fine with one pset and one project class a semester. Pset classes are ones like 16A/B, 70, 170, and math courses. Project courses are 61A/B/C, and the 160s/180s. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to handle 61C and 70 in the same semester, especially if they're your only technical courses that semester"
berkeley,foduk7n,t1_fodq7cf,1587690394.0,"Unfortunately, the organizations that have the ability to really publicize it (the city, the university, etc.) aren't in a legal position to be saying ""avoid these companies"" unless there are actual crimes being currently committed. Add in that Berkeley is a university town, where most people cycle through within a few years, and it's a never-ending battle for people who are in the know and care enough to say something. And even when people know, the family owns thousands of properties, so it's hard to avoid them even when you do know what they are."
