decaf,fpkklni,t1_fpjvj21,1588696355.0,came here to say this. my friend gave me some preworkout in the library once - said it came from mexico so it had some real shit in it - immediately felt like id inhaled adderall. could feel my pupils dilate and my brain hyperfocus. and i felt that level of impact during a time i had 4-6 cups of coffee a day. stimulants are no joke

ClimateOffensive,fogwoht,t1_fog2tz8,1587757829.0,"got my first iphone (6) in 2015, kept it until we had a BOGO circumstance in 2019, now i have the iphone x. i plan to keep it until it explodes. i work in tech so i try to be very conscious of where the materials come from, let alone how they're assembled. the real issue IMO is the \~constant growth\~ mentality. For example, why does it take so long to load Gmail? Facebook? Shouldn't these companies have fast websites? Nope, they want /heavy/ websites that do it all and look fancy and just keep packing functionality in. Hardware doesn't scale once it's bought, but the software on it just keeps growing, forcing hardware upgrades."

ucla,fnfokkb,t3_g1dj6z,1586912219.0,"ive had 2 flipped classrooms in my life. one was godawful, i learned nothing, i retained nothing, i hated it. the other was amazing, i remember that content clearly and went on to focus on the subject in grad school. it really just depends on how much the professor is a ""lmao im so smart i read one paper on collaborative learning and now i hax education"" type vs how much theyre a ""trying to give my students the best experience possible regardless of the cost to me"" type.
