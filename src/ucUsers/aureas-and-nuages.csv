Taking AP Stats this year as kind of a mental break from math, and I'm worried higher placement in math courses is gonna kill me, considering a year spent away from calculus. Anybody have any advice regarding which math course to start with?"

manga,fnirh4p,t1_fniq4ww,1586985071.0,"i‚Äôd like to point out that the kicking people and kicking at other people were just aspects of the first mini-game type thing. that was clearly not soccer. admittedly the betrayal thing was pretty cringey reminiscent of the new prince of tennis bs. but theres other soccer matches in the series that view as regular, hype matches. the ‚Äúlast man standing‚Äù and ‚Äúselfish‚Äù qualms you have feel a bit off of the point of it being a good manga. in the context of the manga, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs never been done before, the whole point of which it being controversial and contrary to common sense (whether it works or not).

the fact that all the strikers join isn‚Äôt a proof that the thought process of the characters isn‚Äôt realistic but rather a proof of the power of a riveting speech. also keep in mind that other position players have been introduced outside the camp, like the middle forward (iirc), likely to be incorporated after the whole camp thing. 

essentially the manga follows the trope that ‚Äújapan needs to get off their asses to compete world stage‚Äù (like hikaru no go, for one), and the whole egoism thing should just be taken as the motivation for improvement."
manga,fnipdrh,t1_fnioe95,1586984009.0,"the manga itself is fun because it explores an absurd concept, completely contrary to what you‚Äôd see in real life. it seems pretty clear to me that the overseer dude has a pretty radical viewpoint and is using to create an environment where he can push said radical viewpoint onto others. it was never claimed that it was the ‚Äúone true‚Äù answer, just what the overseer wants to pursue."
