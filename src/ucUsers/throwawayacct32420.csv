LoveNikki,fo3dzrq,t3_g521em,1587485281.0,"100% agree! Love Nikki is an amazing, detailed, thoughtful, gorgeous game. That's why we all play. It's the only game I've ever spent real $$ on, because I love it so much <3

To me, it doesn't make sense to complain about things such as multiple hell events or expensive recharges. Can't finish an event due to lack of diamonds? Well, I chose to spend my diamonds on the last event. Sure, maybe I didn't expect this one to come at this time, but I am not entitled to having the perfect order of events at the perfect time. Expensive/repetitive recharge? Ok, I just choose not to participate. 

When people complain so much about these things, it rubs off to me as entitled expectations. Expecting to get certain suits in your ideal order (which btw, differs from person to person, so it's impossible to satisfy everyone). Expecting to be able to complete every event. No one is entitled to anything. Yes, we are paying players, but if you don't like how things are run, then just stop paying and play for free! This is a stunning game, and I actually feel very very lucky with the cost/game play ratio.

And the fact that free players have access to all the features, and the vast majority of the gorgeous artwork, is actually insanely generous. There is so much that the devs are doing for us, and I am grateful for it. I am sure that others are as well, but with so many complaints, that sentiment seems to get lost."

LoveNikki,fnxpe1c,t1_fntykge,1587343521.0,"Same! Before quarantine, I had spent $5 (after about 14 months of playing). Now, after about 4 weeks of quarantine, I am at $47. I definitely do not regret my purchases, but I will be slowing down the spending."

I am so fricking excited to go to college, meet new people, take interesting classes, have access to a college library, hang out on the La Jolla beaches, and get the hell away from high school. Please no."
ApplyingToCollege,fn7prpp,t3_fzw9he,1586725164.0,"Yes, in fact if you are going for an MBA, you do not want to do undergrad business. Just about any serious and quantitative major looks better to MBA admissions (and is probably more useful too)."

Hungergames,fmmghn1,t1_fmg90s8,1586204835.0,"I was wondering that too. But she did nothing to interfere with killing the boy and capturing the girl, she was submissive. The Capitol punishes those who are try to rebel or break the rules, which she didn't. (Yes, she was rebelling slightly by being out in the forest to hunt for food, but the Peacekeepers already knew and she wasn't doing anything to incite rebellion or stand up against the Capitol, just trying to feed herself.)"
Hungergames,fmg3vcj,t1_fmcsp2l,1586040701.0,Thank you! It's something I've always wondered about.
