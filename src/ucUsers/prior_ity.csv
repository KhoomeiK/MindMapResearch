I'm not saying that people want school canceled, nobody does. I'm saying that if you're still gonna have classes on campus with 300+ people in lecture halls, why are you limiting dorms to 2 people, and changing plans on freshmen?

You keep talking about other stuff, I'm literally just arguing that freshmen housing guarantees should be honored, and its UCI's responsibility to make that happen for them. And I understand that if they cant honor the guarantee due to covid, but then they shouldn't require freshmen to come to campus. Getting thousands of leases is incredibly hard this late, and that responsiblity shouldnt be on the freshmen."

It's deeply unfair and changing guarantees isn't cool. And I don't want UCI to pay anyones off campus housing, not sure where you got that from. I'm literally just saying UCI should stick by their promise to freshmen that they would have housing if the wanted it, at the rates they were told before they decided to come here. 

The virus mortality rate isn't gonna suddenly change, what are you talking about? If school got canceled, then we wouldn't have to come to school. This sucks for freshmen because if school is still on for some part of next year, they don't really have a way to get housing, and only half of them will be able to live in dorms, which is just unfair to the students who didn't get in. 

If you're not gonna guarantee freshmen housing, then don't make them come to school. That's my solution."
UCI,fokc2r3,t1_fok1eiu,1587839280.0,"No, its fucking stupid and its not the same at all. UCI has told all the freshmen that they are guaranteed housing, they tell you about the housing guarantee on tours, it says it on the website, etc. Now they are just allowed to withdraw that guarantee?

 I really feel for all the freshmen out there, and I have no idea what UCI is gonna do. Announcing that some freshmen are just gonna be unlucky or not be able to afford the housing rates is terrible and I hope UCI feels some pushback from this, because this is the ADMINISTRATIONS fuck up, NOT OURS."

Its a long story, but basically apple had a program where they would replace defective screens for free on pre 2015 macbooks, up to within 4 years of purchase date.

Best bet I'd say is to either try to make this shit go viral and get a couple news articles published about it. Sadly, that's usually the only way change happens. Pressure gets put on the administrators by an outside source and they are forced to act to save future enrollment and money coming in from donors.

In terms of things we can do, email OIT with your concerns and maybe get a bunch of students to do the same? Feel free to post your email here for more people to send, and hopefully we can raise enough of a storm that they will notice. 

Orrrrrrrr we can hack this shit. Look into spoofing browser user-agents, that's probably the way canvas checks that you are actually accessing the quiz through Respondus. Let me know if you wanna help with this, only problem is that I wouldn't know how to test my work, none of my classes have quizzes on this shit, and if they do they're open for an hour max. I think this method would be viable though, since I can't think of any other way that canvas could actually check that you are using Respondus."

UCI,fn7qqlh,t1_fn7o8d6,1586725719.0,"Ok, I won't argue with you over who deserves the money more, as there are students in a lot of different positions, and there's endless ways to determine who gets money and who doesn't. Also, you should consider that many student's situations have changed rapidly in the past month. Many undergrads are going back home to parents who have lost their job or have been furloughed indefinitely. And those differences in income and financial situation won't be represented on last years taxes, therefore depriving a lot of people, and even possibly undergrads, of emergency aid that they need right now. 

The fresh hub is funded through other sources, and with most of the campus population moved back home, I don't think they really need more funding when most people are no longer on campus, and therefore don't need as much food in stock.
