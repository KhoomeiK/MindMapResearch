UCSC,fp73mi5,t3_gbocv4,1588363439.0,"Pretty much what happens is you're given 1-3 sections a week to read and do homework on. HW is due Sunday night.
I highly recommend having 2 notebooks- one for section notes and one for homework.  Every two weeks there will be a quiz based off of the most recent stuff, which they supply you with 1-5 practice quizzes very early in advance.

Technically, you can do all of the work in advance, but if you're not a math person take it slow.  Maybe do a full sections reading one day and starting the homework/go-to section for help on hw the next day.  Don't. Leave. The. Homework. For. Sunday.

I took 19a-23a online and I found I learned the most when I opened the book on Monday and did a section/2 sections a day and started homework on /Wednesday/thursday. 

If you're afraid of not having lectures- Frank recorded YouTube videos that you can watch and pretend you're in lecture for, or you can try going to a zoom sections hosted by one of the TAs. I think there's about 5-6 TAs since that class has close to 500 people in it, so sections are usually a snippet of what you're learning that week + any hw problems you might have.  I'm uncertain of the TAs now but when I had them they were amazing and very VERY helpful. 

In the end, they give you tons of practice quizzes/exams that have answers and great explanations for each answer and their TAs are almost always available.  Plus both professors are very nice and understanding, so don't be afraid to reach out to them.

Anyways, sorry for the word vomit.  Good luck!"

They most likely already know, but the more people that complain the more likely he will be forced to fix his shitty behavior."
