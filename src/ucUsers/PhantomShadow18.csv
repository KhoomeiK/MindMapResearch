Depending on your plan, the plan administrator can allow you to roll the vested portion of that traditional side of your account over to the Roth side.


If you do this, they will send you a 1099-R with your cost basis which you then pay income tax on.


Your cost basis = traditional pre tax contributions + traditional capital gains (on both pre tax and after tax contributions)."

tmobile,fokveoh,t1_foko6kv,1587849685.0,"Echoing the other response, just to give some more context and info. He‚Äôs right, they have been deploying half (or in some cases less than half) of their own 600MHz bandwidth. Long term vision, though, is to enable DSS (when it‚Äôs ready) for their non-standalone NR across the entire band. In 5 years or so they‚Äôll switch to standalone NR and VoNR and probably sunset LTE on B71.



Also of course, on the b41 (2.5GHz) side, they have their speed/capacity spectrum. In smaller towns it will allow high speeds if you‚Äôre close enough to the tower, in large cities it‚Äôll provide additional speed and much greater capacity without the headaches of mmWave. They have 



In super dense parts of metros, like NYC, SF, LA, SD, etc, they will deploy mmWave for high speeds and high capacity. Speculation, sort of: mmWave deployment won‚Äôt make it to rural areas at all, but it will be deployed along interstates and major highways in time."
tmobile,fokc64l,t1_foka4va,1587839329.0,They‚Äôre not losing all b71 in a few years. T-mobile owns a minimum of 20MHz across the entire nation to provide rural coverage. For the next few years they‚Äôll have double that.

My AGI was less than $75k for 2019 and I have filed taxes, so would be expected to get the full check based on 2019. That said, my 2020 AGI will be over $100k. The few family and friends I have discussed this with think the IRS will cut me a check now and expect me to repay it when I file taxes next year. Do you agree? Is there an authoritative source on this scenario?"
Amd,fn7rjf4,t1_fn7h7gb,1586726184.0,Ryzen is much more power efficient than Core... your conclusion seems odd. Core would be throttled faster in bursty workloads and to lower performance in sustained workloads.
