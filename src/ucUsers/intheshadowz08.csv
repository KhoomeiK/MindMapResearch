100% YTB, OP."

My 2 year old was attacked by my previous husband’s neurotic cocker spaniel I begged him to put down the dog for numerous previous biting incidents prior to this. DD was sick with a cold and I was home with her. We had one car at the time and then husband had it for work. DD had had a bath and wanted to watch a Disney movie after. I set out her favorite blanket and went to get her some water to drink while she watched. As I was in the kitchen the crazy spaniel approached her and sat in her blanket. Daughter told him to “shoo”. I knew it was going to escalate quickly and scolded the dog (mistake in hindsight  my freaking out made the dog react). He bit my daughter in the face. A puncture wound on the cheek and a bite through her lower lip. I had no car and called my husband at work. His assistant answered (she was horrible) I told her I didn’t care what meeting he was in get my husband NOW!!!  

ER doc said “a cocker spaniel did this?”  And I said yes I saw it. My husband was pissed I didn’t defend his dog. I told him the dog is psycho (I love animals...worked for a vet as a Tech for many years before I met my then husband and currently have four fur babies).   Daughter was subjected to flushing and stitches. 20 years later she still has a scar on her cheek. Her father called everyone he could begging him to take his dog. All had seen this dog in action and refused. Our vet even said this dog is not going to get better.   He attacked your baby, he is hopeless.   Ultimately, the dog was put to sleep. Husband at the time didn’t speak to me for six months after “I made him kill his dog.”  

We have been divorced for 15 years and our daughter is now an adult, but that event was the catalyst for the end of that marriage.   Your MIL should have prioritized her grandchild not the dog. And, as I mentioned I am a dog lover so it hurts to say that as much as it hurt me at the time see my husband lose his dog. The thing is, some dogs are sick, some dogs are mean. Period."

UCSantaBarbara,fmw2ht5,t3_fxlpqj,1586437997.0,Probably impounded. UCPD just left the wheel for someone in facilities to deal with. Typical move for them.
