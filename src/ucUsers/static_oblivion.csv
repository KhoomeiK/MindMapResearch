curledfeetsies,fphwtmn,t1_fph96hg,1588629268.0,Thank you!
PirateKitties,fpgrtr9,t1_fpfjvnj,1588608352.0,He feels like a plushie! His favorite thing is to lay across my chest and/or face and just purr until he falls asleep. It was legitimately difficult to find a pic of him not doing that lol
Wicca,fpdgrmt,t1_fpdghsp,1588526680.0,It was a beautiful experience and I’m so happy it led me down my current path. I feel so much more connected to the world around me and so much more free now!
Wicca,fpdg8tj,t3_gcs2bu,1588526389.0,"My first experience with energies, which ultimately led me to paganism, was at an ancient Buddhist temple in Cambodia. The feeling of peace I had there was almost tangible, I had never experienced anything like it before. After researching and deciding that Buddhism wasn’t for me, I started witchcraft, and the first time I cast a circle I felt the same sense of peace, to a lesser degree then, but it’s full force now that I’m better at casting circles. 

My first experience with my goddess came months after, when I started to notice that there was a presence whenever I practiced. It was kind of like the comforting feeling of having a parent watching you try something new as a child, supportive and caring."
piercing,fpdff71,t3_gctcy5,1588525930.0,Doesn’t look like keloids or anything. I’ve had mine pierced for about a year and they get dry sometimes too. I usually just put some coconut oil on in the shower (I use coconut oil as full body moisturizer anyway) and it goes away
piercing,fp9zwxv,t3_gc7jin,1588438002.0,"I’ve had double helix piercings in both ears for years now, and for me at least, my glasses never bother them. My hair does get caught tho and that was annoying while they healed but doesn’t bother me anymore (my hair is a bit more than midway down my back). I side sleep too, but I had them done one ear at a time so I just tried not to sleep on the side they were fresh on, but many people suggested the airplane pillow route and I would have done that if I had known then"
piercing,fp6t35z,t1_fp6ovw4,1588358120.0,"Is the 11mm the ring that’s in now or the one it was pierced with? If it’s the ring it was pierced with, then future jewelry should be 10 or 11mm in diameter. If it’s the one in now, then upsize a few mm."
piercing,fp6nsid,t3_gbcu3p,1588355516.0,"The ring looks like it’s too small across. This makes the curve more intense inside the piercing and pulls on the ends, because it’s trying to make the fistula curve too, which puts a lot of pressure on it and irritates the piercing. Put a bigger hoop in it and it’ll probably calm down. If you like the look of a hoop close to the ear, maybe you can find a D shaped ring, so the straight part goes through the ear and doesn’t put as much pressure on the hole"
piercing,fp6ndj8,t3_gbcxts,1588355312.0,"Mine did. I took out a helix piercing for around 4 months, because it was crooked and I wanted to have it redone. Later I missed it and tried to put the jewelry back in and it was closed so I just had it redone. Before I took it out I had it for 2 years and it was fully healed"
piercing,fp6n4qe,t3_gbdw1p,1588355191.0,"Not that noticeable. I had mine done professionally, and they aren’t even either because my earlobes aren’t symmetrical apparently. I didn’t even notice til I had the seconds done and the same piercer pointed out that the spacing would be a little off. Could be an issue if you decide to stretch them tho, since there’s not the same amount of skin around them"
Wicca,fp6mtu8,t3_gbaf20,1588355040.0,"So far as I know, there is no space requirement for altars, and I don’t think a bedside table is disrespectful so you should be good"
piercing,fp6mc0h,t3_gbg1yt,1588354799.0,"Looks like an irritation bump to me, with the redness. I would leave it alone and wash with saline for a while and see if it clears up. Happens to me sometimes if I switch from curved to straight jewelry or vice versa with my cartilage, but my lobes only did it the first change"
Wicca,fp6l5p0,t3_gbiqea,1588354223.0,"I live in Nevada, so my advice is based on what I can find, but I use sage, pine, and a lot of wildflowers. I like to dry the wildflowers and use them as offerings or decorations. Around my neighborhood, a lot of people have nonnative plants in their yards and in the park. My neighbors let me cut some flowers every once in a while, and roses are blooming here so I have a lot of gorgeous roses for my Beltane altar currently. As far as other herbs I use, common kitchen herbs like cinnamon and basil, as well as catnip (which I have in abundance because I also have cats), and eucalyptus is also readily available to me. Personally, I also like to collect sticks and rocks and bones and whatever else I find in nature and can acquire respectfully. Makes me feel more connected to my area of nature."
Wicca,fp6k77g,t3_gbjoxi,1588353750.0,"I’m more an eclectic pagan than Wiccan specifically, but if the weather allows, I recommend sitting outside and grounding yourself. I’ve been doing this often myself, sitting on the ground and focusing on nature and what I can feel, usually with a stone in my hand (mine is literally just a smooth rock I found on the beach once, it doesn’t need to be a gem) and it brings me a sense of peace. I hope it will help you feel peace too, times are hard and the world is stressful right now. Just know that it’s ok to be sad and your feelings are valid, take it slow, and things will get better eventually. Also, Beltane blessings, should you celebrate it"
piercing,fp6jn0c,t3_gbjqz6,1588353473.0,"Congrats! I remember how good I felt after I had mine done too, and I still feel extra confident about my chest a year later"
piercing,fp3qhyo,t3_gb4x38,1588283962.0,"I would recommend against it until fully healed, just because any kind of smoking involves a sucking action that’s bad for healing (straws aren’t recommended either) and not smoking will also help keep your mouth clean while it’s healing"
piercing,fp0ubxw,t3_gak1bj,1588217097.0,"I was rly stupid with mine (pierced myself, multiple times, bc I was Dumb) but essentially I Always had ice in my mouth. as often as I could handle it. it really helped the swelling, which made talking and eating much easier. Other than that I just tried to act like it wasn’t there and kept my mouth as clean as possible"
Wicca,fp026y3,t1_fp01ywa,1588201092.0,"It’s all good, glad I could help! I tend to get all caught up in the grand design thoughts as well"
UCSantaBarbara,fp00gnz,t3_g96dgd,1588200174.0,On the only lab that’s been graded for me so far I got docked so many point for the discussion but none of it was stuff that was specifically asked for anywhere. I’ve also been having a hard time with the sources of error.
Wicca,fozyvbh,t3_g9oum2,1588199337.0,"I was in a similar situation a few years ago when I started my own path. My favorite part about Wicca/paganism in general is that there’s a lot of leeway to make things your own, unlike more structured religions with lots of hard rules. I agree with the other comment about nature; for me getting in touch with the natural world was the start. Take a bit to learn about the wilderness around you and what lives there, whether you live in the countryside or by the ocean or in a city, something wild lives and thrives there and I find that learning about it and appreciating it is truly comforting. I grew up in the desert, so I went out of my way to learn about what lives there, the plants and animals, and to be out in nature and look for them, although that might be hard during quarantine. Luckily the internet is full of resources where you can learn about your area. As far as more specifically Wiccan advice, I started very slowly and found my info online and in a few books, focusing more on the ideas rather than the specifics. Hopefully this long wall of text is helpful, I’m somewhat new to actually posting on reddit"
Wicca,fozy15k,t3_gahd2d,1588198899.0,This is gorgeous! How did you do it?
Wicca,fozxy2z,t3_gagm0i,1588198854.0,"I don’t know your abilities with woodworking or your resources, but with some wood planking you could make a small box shape, and with some hinges you could add a door/doors to open it. You could paint the outside to decorate or stain the wood maybe. Kinda depends on your skill set and what you have access to"
Wicca,fozun4f,t1_fozsfky,1588197161.0,"For me I could just sort of sense she was around whenever I was doing anything related to magick. I don’t actually know which named goddess she would be but I refer to her as Luna bc I feel she’s connected strongly to the moon, but there’s an ocean attachment as well. I don’t think all of the gods and goddesses are well known or have specific names but I just kinda go with whatever feels right, even if there’s a lot of uncertainty. Good luck with your journey!"
Wicca,foznf2z,t3_g80kdw,1588193578.0,"It’s a good start! As far as aesthetics go, I would recommend a smaller space so it looks a little less bare, because you can always expand as you get more things. Maybe you could add some flowers or other plants? When I was just starting out my altar was mainly just cool rocks and sticks I collected from outside, and the queen of hearts from a deck of playing cards to represent my goddess (I didn’t have a lot of resources)"
whatsthisrock,fozlxzn,t3_gaczr6,1588192872.0,"4 looks like amethyst and 2 could be tigers eye, but I’m not an expert, just like cool rocks"
UCSantaBarbara,fozgz7d,t3_gad7tb,1588190496.0,"Everyone I’ve met has been super accepting, although I’m not much of a sorority or party girl. I wasn’t out of shape before but I definitely got fitter just walking to all my classes and there’s a lot of fun groups on campus for any interest, all the people I talked to were super friendly."
