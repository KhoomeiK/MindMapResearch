AgonyGame,fmetvfg,t3_fsm3b5,1586013400.0,"Well it’s definitely more playable now. I personally enjoy the devs vision of hell, the creatures in it and the interesting puzzles. I’m not gonna lie. Here and there, I’ve encountered some bugs. Even one that if you don’t wait for it to save before exiting onto the Xbox home you lose your progress. But again, MUCH better. I haven’t encountered audio glitches either."
