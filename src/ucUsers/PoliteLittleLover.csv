Sacramento,foxgdnp,t1_fouzzoa,1588143174.0,Is this confirmed for the entire campus? My department has started making ramp-up plans but they've made it very clear that there is no set date for them to start the ramp-up.
UCDavis,fow8gol,t3_g876uf,1588114950.0,"I'm a grad student and have lived in Sac and commuted for almost 4 years. As others have said, it's doable, especially if you avoid rush hour times and are already used to commuting. A C permit is $50/month (if you buy more than 6 months at a time) and allows you to park in any of the C lots around campus. A cheaper option is the L permit, which is $35/month but restricts you to one specific lot."

UCDavis,fmsu28t,t1_fmrklpt,1586362011.0,"Honestly though I don't have anything ""essential"" going on. No animals or equipment that I need to maintain. In fact I started ramping down the few days before the Shelter-In-Place order for Yolo County in anticipation that it was gonna happen. 

It's not that I was interrupted mid-experiment or anything, it's just that I had *so many plans* for this month ;-;"
