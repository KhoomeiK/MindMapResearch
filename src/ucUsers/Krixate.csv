ClashRoyale,fp8haiq,t1_fp7qjjq,1588392278.0,2.6 player here... Some decks with building tornado skarmy and mini Pekka just feels terrible to play against
ClashRoyale,fnb8vz8,t1_fnb7e2k,1586811269.0,"Thanks for the kind words, just don't have those rare cards rn as a f2p. Hit 5550 ish last season and it was pretty rough at times"
ClashRoyale,fnb6nuz,t1_fnb5rar,1586810149.0,Ya having to fireball a princess just feelsbad
ClashRoyale,fnb649d,t3_g0ns6i,1586809876.0,Same here but I am at level 11. Sometimes my log can't kill a princess its just discouraging to play.
ClashRoyale,fnb5y80,t1_fnb5jzo,1586809792.0,Yea just want a small rant. Some games are not playable if my musky gets one shot by a fireball. And when my log doesn't kill their princess/ dart goblin/ rascals it's just depressing to play.
ClashRoyale,fnb5bzc,t3_g0pq89,1586809484.0,Hog 2.6 is still one of the highest skill cap decks out there. Ever since the addition of tornado and buffs to some buildings there are just more counters to hogs.

ClashRoyale,fmvgytk,t3_frf9sh,1586416626.0,"Same... Hog 2.6 with lvl 12 commons and lvl 11 rares... 5557 last season tired of playing against Golden cards

Some games are just not playable when your opponent one shots your musky with a fireball"

Showerthoughts,fm8gwh1,t3_ftirtr,1585849169.0,False. My home's fridge is the same as my school dorm's. Just opens on a different side.
