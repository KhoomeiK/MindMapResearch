Plus, I guess my logic stems from the fact that if certain hormones weren't introduced then the fetus is female so inherently, the fetus is female until it isn't."
todayilearned,fpjlg34,t1_focztmf,1588672945.0,"I think it's still arguable since the ""early embryos of both sexes possess indifferent common primordia that have an inherent tendency to feminize unless there is active interference by masculinizing factors (Grumbach and Conte, 1998)."" However, I see your point in not assigning a sex prematurely since they are not fully developed yet into either sex and thus, can't be assigned into either yet."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fpbx900,t1_fpb6nmd,1588481135.0,That's unfortunate. You would think they'd have spare ones they can loan out. Like where are the uniforms when they are being sold!?
UCSantaBarbara,fom9bx6,t1_folw9yi,1587882202.0,Beaches in Orange County just opened up so maybe that'll alleviate the problem here... though not in general. :(
todayilearned,focxsdr,t1_focw48o,1587677288.0,"This isn't necessary true. ""During early development the gonads of the fetus remain undifferentiated; that is, all fetal genitalia are the same and are phenotypically female.""

UCSantaBarbara,fo8daw6,t3_g6af4f,1587594377.0,"YES! I also don't think DSP shows up on your transcript. Furthermore, you are under no obligation to tell your employer beforehand of your disability. 

DSP provides so many opportunities which you can discuss with your doctor and DSP. I get priority registration, extra time on exams, and can sign up to have a notetaker for my classes (although, I feel that they tend to not be that great). I 100% believe you should ask for these accomodations if you've been diagnosed.

Personally, getting DSP accomodations was pretty easy. I just had to talk to my doctor about it and have them send DSP the needed paperwork, but I had also recently received extensive testing done by another psychiatrist that specialized in doing psychological testing."
nextfuckinglevel,fmzr5yp,t1_fmzo31t,1586527799.0,I always just have the laser land on some toy of my cats so she can pounce on it and still feel like she caught something.
oddlysatisfying,fmgkziu,t1_fmgkb8i,1586051354.0,There's a couch in there. Clearly some people must be spending a lot of time there.
