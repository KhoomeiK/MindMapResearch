I would be sad to see my great uncle, who died in 1969 from a communist land mine, to have sacrificed for nothing. 

It is up to all Vietnamese of all nationalities to understand when to be proud of our accomplishments, and when to know what needs to be improved.

Vietnam for the Vietnamese, America for the Americans. As an American of Vietnamese ancestry, I believe I can work towards the benefit of both nations and improve relations between 2 countries and cultures.
