Throughout this entire thread you have provided exactly two sources after being asked multiple times. One is a link to a banned Wikipedia user that doesn't say anything and the other is an article that talks about the CIA manipulating Wikipedia articles.


You have no sources to prove your claim and have come up with various excuses such as ""I dont feel like proving anything to you"" and ""a clever person should be able to figure it out"".


If you are trying to push these claims as fact, then provide proof or retract your statement and admit it is just your conspiracy theory and you have no proof.
1. The linked Wikipedia user is a former CIA staff.
2. The Wikipedia user was banned at the direction of the CIA after he left it.
3. Most of the senior editors of Wikipedia are full-time staff."
worldnews,fp8nop8,t1_fp8jr2n,1588397306.0,"If you have proof then post it. Just saying ""I have proof"" is worthless. 

That article is an interesting read. But it doesn't justify you making the claim that ""all the senior wikipedia editors are full-time CIA staff"". All it says is that the CIA is involved in editing articles in Wikipedia to make the U.S. look good (this is already known and documented).

""brings us back to square one""
You are insinuating again that this is some big cover up, that the CIA has wiped the internet clean of this information, and you, an enlightened person, have access to it, but again, you don't have anything to prove it except your own words? 

My conclusion is the logical one. Some anonymous person on the internet makes a claim and doesn't provide a source for it after being asked multiple times, coming up with excuses like ""I don't feel like proving anything to you"". Personal search of the claim yields no results. What would a rational person think? Lies and conspiracy theory? Or some big global cover-up? 


If you're trying to push these claims as fact, then prove it.

If the US knew he was in the plane, why would they contact the European governments to re-rout the plane and search it plane when it landed? Makes no sense at all. Again, nobody threatened to shoot down the plane.

""Hilariously untrue""

Go ahead and actually provide some evidence for once instead of continuously saying ""not true not true"". Go find me an article of some human rights violation or anything like that that has been censored or sanitized by a Western government.

Also, can you go to jail in the a Western country such as the U.S. for talking about the illegal actions done by it? No, you can't. But you can in China. Shi Tao, Liu Xiabo, even people now are being arrested for things such as revealing video and images of inside Wuhan. Fang Bin, Chen Qiushi, Li Zuhua, etc.

&#x200B;

If anyone is lying that is you. Saying this again, for like the third time now: You are making these claims with no sources anywhere to provide any proof. That ""primary source"" says nothing. It just shows a Wikipedia user and that he was banned by Wikipedia. Maybe you have access to communications of the CIA where they instructed Wikipedia to ban him? No you don't. Do you have a source of that banned Wikipedia user being a former CIA staff? No you don't. Do you have any sources for a third party that has credible evidence to prove any of this? No you don't. You should stop trying to peddle these conspiracy theories, only the most na√Øve will take you seriously.

&#x200B;

""I'm not interesting in proving anything to you""

Then you're just making up a bunch of nonsense. You come up with these claims, nobody can find any sources online about it, and you have no sources either or anything to prove it. And after I point out that your claim is baseless multiple times, twice you have said to go search it up yourself (your theory doesn't show up anywhere) and finally you said ""I'm not interested in proving it"". Your claim that the ""senior Wikipedia editors are all full-time CIA staff"" is conspiracy theory, plain and simple."
worldnews,fp12b1z,t1_fp0wchx,1588222495.0,"It is true that it was created for the CIA to communicate with foreign dissidents, but it does what I stated it does. Allow for anonymous, unmonitored communication. China would never allow their people to use something like this.

If you're talking about the incident where they thought Snowden was aboard the plane, you are lying again. The plane was denied entry in European airspace, rerouted, and landed to refuel (and was searched) but nobody threatened to shoot it down.

For Tiananmen Square, I will rephrase that. You \*can\* search it up, but what's it going to show you? Nothing critical, all positive. Images like the tank man are censored, information about the wrong-doings of the government are censored.

Compare that to if we search up the war crimes and illegal actions done by some other Western country. Not sanitized by government censors and actually contains condemning information.

I am not misrepresenting anything, you are making some outlandish claims, and when I ask you for the source, you should provide it. Especially since from my own search I did not come across anything online to verify what you say. If you don't have any source for these types of claims, then I'll take what you say are pure conspiracy theory.

You are the one misrepresenting things, such as making claims like the senior editors of Wikipedia are full-time CIA staff, and you don't even have anything to back up this claim, just a link to a banned wikipedia user that says nothing (i do see that the ban reason states to not unban him and that this was ordered by the WMF, but there is still no proof). Nothing to support your claim that he was a full-time CIA staff or anything."

The Chinese Internet is censored. Even the Chinese people know this, nobody tries to claim it is not censored. Western internet is not censored, unless you are referring to illegal content like child pornography.
In the US you can search up information of illegal and shady stuff the government did, like Project MK Ultra. In Chinese internet you can't search up about the Tiananmen Square Massacre or anything like that.


How is it not true that the CIA doesn't try to control the internet and suppress dissidents? The CIA doesnt go around on the internet trying to censor people that criticize the government. Also, they are literally the ones that created Tor, which allows you tp bypass government censorship and lets dissidents communicate anonymously.

And is do you have any sources for that last story because all you did was link to his wikipedia page which does not provide any information. (Also this is one person, even if it is true, there is no basis to say that ""most of the senior wikipedia editors are full-time CIA staff). In fact, if this was true there would be some information out there about it, because there are plenty of people in the world who would not be fine with all those editors being CIA staff.
