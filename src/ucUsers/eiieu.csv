If there’s not one person standing outside their governor's office with a sign that reads, ""EMERGENCY RENT FREEZE NOW!!!"" or ""WE NEED BASIC INCOME"" then that either means that:  
-no wants it or  
-it’s not important enough to go ask for it."
ABoringDystopia,fplxztp,t1_fpli2y9,1588721652.0,"Who pays for that? These things are funded with tax money. Guess what happens when there’s no economy? Smh, it’s not that hard to understand if you decide to stop listening to the echo chamber and actually use your brain.

What the US government is doing right now is borrowing TRILLIONS of dollars from the Federal reserve (which by the way, isn’t part of the government just because it has the word “Federal” in it). Every sort of debt is being bought by the Government with borrowed money to keep things propped up. Why? Because they need to keep their pensions/retirement. Once this bubble explodes, yes, we the young people are all fucked with this huge debt upon our shoulders. They don’t give a shit about anyone but themselves (e.g., see Senators selling stocks upon Covid-19 briefing). So yes, it’s easy to understand why it’s easy for younger people to not want this system any longer, but not every old person is in the government or has an actual portfolio/retirement to just say fuck this and retire. Some people have to work because they see this government dependence as something dangerous. Ultimately it’s no longer Government dependence, but it’s the Central banks dependence. 

So, no, not everyone is trying to bowl. Some people are actually trying to not have the rest of their lives decided by billionaire bankers. And some people also understand that this lockdown is not backed up by scientific data (e.g. 96% of state prisoners who tested positive for Covid-19 showed no symptoms = much higher number of cases = much lower actual mortality rate). And you won’t see these people going to the government to demand anything because they feel like they can work for it, instead of getting the handout. All they need is the right to going back to doing it."

Good luck!"
