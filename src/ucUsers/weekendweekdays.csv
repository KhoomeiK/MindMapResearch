traderjoes,fneztlv,t1_fnekhg0,1586898843.0,"I agree that TJs is doing a great job and setting an example for other markets. However, they are still allowing reusable bags in the Hollywood location. They just say they won‚Äôt bag your items. Their reasoning for not bagging items into reusable bags is because ‚Äúit slows down the line‚Äù. I know that they don‚Äôt bag reusable bags due to hygiene but since they keep saying that it‚Äôs just to ‚Äúkeep the line going faster‚Äù I think most people just roll their eyes and continue bringing in their reusable bags."

I have the permission to record them myself due to CAE but I haven‚Äôt sent my letter yet to the professor. I wonder if after I record them I could transcribe them too. Thanks for the idea."
