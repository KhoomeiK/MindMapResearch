UCSantaBarbara,fpmb8tj,t3_ge7fv6,1588729349.0,Donâ€™t expect a timely response... the difference between stats and other departments administrative effectiveness is sad

UCSantaBarbara,fpi8x86,t3_gdj40p,1588636023.0,This makes me want to cry
UCSantaBarbara,fpg0gqk,t1_fpf6s4m,1588590276.0,Pretty dank I agree
UCSantaBarbara,fp7ljdb,t1_fp7f1sm,1588372909.0,"Great advice, think I'll take 171 in the fall, and some easier ones in the winter. 131 shouldn't be too bad as I've done a lot of self study and a few data science projects already, mostly 160A-B and 115 that scare me."
UCSantaBarbara,fp7gxfm,t1_fp7g3dn,1588370413.0,"Definitely will take 171 with Esponda when it' available, sounds like he's got a good thing going. Thanks for the help!"
UCSantaBarbara,fp7dy12,t1_fp7dj32,1588368821.0,I would decline to use those for stats and instead petition to have my spring research abroad count for 8 stats units (I know this is a mess but Iâ€™m just asking about the feasibility of those 8 classes back to back)
UCSantaBarbara,fp4nscq,t1_fp4jtq1,1588303122.0,"Maybe, but Iâ€™m cynical and see how platforms like google analytics can make in house analytics seem unappealing to a lot of companies. I hope it plays out better than that for us.

In that case a project/course based masters degree in applied statistics or data science is something you should take a look at. Iâ€™m hesitant to recommend data science as a masters degree as a lot of programs are cash cows for schools and you can often learn what they teach yourself, but Iâ€™m not really qualified to say anything more than I already have, google it yourself and see what comes up"
UCSantaBarbara,fp4io91,t3_gb8t9d,1588299900.0,"Data science is an umbrella term for a lot of different things. What are your interests? Do you like programming or academic math/statistics more? Do you want to be the guy writing formulas on the board, putting ML models into production, analyzing data, making data related software, etc... I'm just a lowly undergrad but when cutting non essential staff analytics seems like it's first up on the chopping block, I would advise against entering this field right now unless it's your passion or you're very strongly interested in it."
UCSantaBarbara,fp1rjc0,t1_fp1dp6t,1588245591.0,Yes unless youâ€™re a god tier student not worth the risk
UCSantaBarbara,fp1qnem,t3_garevf,1588244756.0,Get comfortable with coding. Join the DS club. Take CMPSC 130A. Make love to R Markdown
UCSantaBarbara,fopqyms,t3_g8ukkz,1587969308.0,"Thanks for the perspective, Iâ€™m an undergrad whose TAs are probably swamped and this helps be more empathetic towards them, this is a hard situation for everyone"
neoliberal,foeif62,t1_foefxhq,1587704592.0,"Weâ€™ve only been using puberty blockers for around a decade to my knowledge and we donâ€™t know what the long term effects are yet. Pumping hormones into our body, for a trans youth who needs reassignment or any other reason is a huge huge deal and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s ethical to let children make a decision so large when they arenâ€™t legally adults and are barred from a lot of activities because of their age.

And yes, life altering surgeries are a thing and [are practiced on children](http://www.childrenshospital.org/centers-and-services/programs/a-_-e/center-for-gender-surgery-program#). Itâ€™s not a conspiracy to also suggest that [pharmaceutical companies who stand to profit massively off of juvenile gender reassignment therapies  actively lobby and encourage this](https://medium.com/@sue.donym1984/inauthentic-selves-the-modern-lgbtq-movement-is-run-by-philanthropic-astroturf-and-based-on-junk-d08eb6aa1a4b).

There is nothing wrong with supporting transgender people in the improving of their lives and reassignment surgery. But when doing life altering surgery and hormone therapies on children, I think we should be on the side of long term studies and caution."
UCSantaBarbara,foefp7z,t3_g6yf3v,1587702637.0,"If youâ€™re serious and not just seeking attention, this is not a good idea"
neoliberal,foefdm7,t3_g6v72d,1587702414.0,This banned children under 18 from doing potentially life altering surgeries and hormone therapies. Whatâ€™s the problem with making a child wait until theyâ€™re 18 before altering their body forever?

UCSantaBarbara,fnqufk3,t1_fnquaue,1587172469.0,"Yeah you can use those Econ electives for stats, and push farther up the CS tree than is required (Iâ€™m at CS 130A without being a major right now) for that juicy resume booster. Also working with data will be much easier and more intuitive for you, putting you a leg up above other Econ majors"
UCSantaBarbara,fnqqpq5,t3_g38tf0,1587170142.0,I would double in Econ and stats and take Cs courses on the side! Stats and Econ go very well together and with the extra CS under your belt you will be in a good place to grow your career once you graduate

IWantOut,fnnh4ub,t1_fnnggl8,1587092252.0,"America is stepping into oligarchy (as are countless nations across the globe), there is no place for plebeians to reform anything in such a system. There isn't much beyond ""refreshing the tree of liberty"" left really."

UCSantaBarbara,fn2io6u,t1_fn2f1kw,1586590424.0,"I'll send him an email for sure, going to progress in my NLP self study a bit before that though! Do you think there's a chance of getting anything during this COVID chaos, or should I wait until the fall in your opinion? Sorry for asking for advice on your thread but I really need it right now lol"
UCSantaBarbara,fn1soje,t3_fyd4mw,1586569194.0,Iâ€™m not super knowledgeable about NLP (I want to do research in it eventually though!) but I would choose UCSB over the others in your situation. Our computer science department is fantastic and California is an extremely nice area to live in. Have you spoken with any faculty here?
