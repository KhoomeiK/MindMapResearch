ImpracticalJokers,fp9ymiq,t1_fp9ygzl,1588437258.0,Murr posts alot about like his interactions with friends and family and the jokers are never involved. Couple days ago Murr posted a zoom call with “friends and family” and again no sign of any of the guys.

LSAT,fmuekdx,t1_fmue9fw,1586389863.0,"1. You have less questions to miss, you have more time and stamina to focus on every question. 
2. Any mess up your test automatically gets paused
3. No! People get mad when they get screwed over, im applying this fall with the july test (5 sections ~3 hours) while someone is taking a 3 section half ass lsat flex. Truuuuuust me law schools are not going to prioritize a 165 lsat over 170 LSAT flex"
LSAT,fmueady,t1_fmuarx5,1586389706.0,"Its not solely dependent on the sections your taking. You are taking 2 whole sections less, the test is at least an hour and 10 minutes shorter. What are you talking about. Check your privilege before you judge others for complaining."
LSAT,fmue52i,t1_fmudpig,1586389623.0,"The test is more than an hour shorter. It is absolutely easier, think about test fatigue, having an experimental section. Everything is effected and only to the benefit of the FLEX taker. It is not heresay"
LSAT,fmua0oc,t3_fxeqt6,1586387342.0,How is it fair for other students who will be at a disadvantage because LSAT FLEX takers will have a higher score since they took the test with 3 sections. I am getting screwed because they take the lsat with 40% less sections AND time than i do. If anything you check your privilege instead of sitting on your virtue horse telling people not to be angry for getting screwed over.
