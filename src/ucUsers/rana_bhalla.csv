UCI,fol6tkf,t1_fol5491,1587856018.0,You’re spot on again. Things are changing so quick that it’s virtually impossible to make a decision now that would still seem fair in October. The admins are doing their best. Let’s just wait to see what they say shall we? :)
UCI,fokmiz9,t1_foklx9j,1587844855.0,"I wholly agree with you. Yes, admin doesn’t have a magic 8 ball and won’t be able to make a decision just yet. That’s why I said not to bet money on anything just yet. I was just stating my thinking on the issue, just as you have done. I don’t believe either one of us will be 100% right, because there’s always another compromise. I believe the administration will make the right decision in the best interest of the students, hopefully sooner rather than later. Till then all we can do is wait"
UCI,fokjp2y,t1_fok0wtw,1587843328.0,"You gotta remember that there’s a much higher volume of people this year than ever before. We still also haven’t gotten confirmation yet about what they’re gonna be doing next year so “this late” doesn’t actually mean today. It’s more towards August/September, where students are gonna have to find housing within weeks."
UCI,fojcwkg,t1_fojcsg1,1587817093.0,"Yeah personally I feel like they should make online classes optional, and offer in-person lectures for people who need/want to actually be on campus, or figure out something along those lines so professors don’t have to work twice as much"
UCI,fojb2sf,t3_g7q5hn,1587815311.0,"Right now I’d say it’s leaning towards being completely online. Coronavirus will die down by the summer. There’s little doubt about that. However, our main problem is that it will, 100%, come back in the fall for a second wave. Unless we have a vaccine or herd immunity by that stage (both of which aren’t likely), we’re not gonna reopen schools. Not to mention that on-campus housing won’t be able to accomodate all the freshmen, much less everyone else (Only ~50% of freshmen will be given on-campus housing), so most people will have to attend from elsewhere (ie, Online, since finding housing this late is gonna be a mess). That puts fall quarter into the online column. What about winter quarter? The onslaught of the virus will be much worse in winter than even in the fall, so that rules out a winter re-opening. 2-0 in favor of online so far. Now we’re left with spring quarter. We might have a vaccine at this point. Great! We can reopen schools now right? Not exactly. Each quarter is only 10 weeks long. How many people are gonna pack up all their things and move to Irvine from not only around the state, but from around the country? How about from around the world? Probably not too many. I don’t think they would reopen schools just for a single quarter. That being said, I wouldn’t bet money on any of this. We have no idea how fast treatments or even vaccines might be discovered. For all we know everything could be back to normal in 2 weeks, or in 2 years."
