Within a week or so you will get a letter in the mail from court sent to the address on the ID you gave the cop. And the return address will say something very conspicuous like ""[your county] court, criminal division""."

So, actual doctore here.  
There are 2 kinds of bacterial contamination you need to worry about.  
Toxic producing bacteria, usually gram positive cocci, that grow in food that is stored at inappropriate temp. Toxins are heat stable, so even if you cook it pretty hot you can still get sick. Usually vomiting, diarrhea, starting about 4 hours after the meal. Common for picnics and things where there's lots of food sitting around. Supportive care, fluids, rest.  
Gram negative rods like salmonella are what you get in chicken, they double every hour or 2, so it depends on how many bacteria were in it to start as to whether there were a lot at the end, and high temp cooking kills them which is why 165 is recommended. Diarrhea, sometimes bloody, vomiting, fever, usually 18 hours after you eat it. Can be treated with antibiotics in addition to supportive care.

Is this accurate?"
