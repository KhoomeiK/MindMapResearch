sandiego,fmmxgow,t1_fmmqb3w,1586213944.0,"My two buddies got tickets. Driving home from the grocery store they stopped (Encinitas area) and stayed in their cars, to watch the sunset. They said the cops were super chill, and my buddies were very honest and cordial back, but the cops had to give them tickets. It’s like a citation and they have to appear in court this fall. From what they got from the cops- since they cooperated and were just in the car, the cops most likely won’t show up to the court on their date and it will get dismissed

Edit: they did not pull into any blocked off parking lots, just a residential/open street you could see the beach from"
