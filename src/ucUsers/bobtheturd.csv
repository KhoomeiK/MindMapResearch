Although I am inclined to think the plastic micro particle exposure from ziplocks only contributes a portion of our plastic exposure - we get a daily dose of plastic from our drinking water, probably many prepackaged foods, etc. :(  I reuse my old ziplocks for mostly non food items."

GuerrillaGardening,fpheg8e,t1_fphbf6n,1588619832.0,"This person is correct. It‚Äôs too late in the year. Suggest to get your seeds ready and distribute in the fall (this is when seeds fall to the ground from pollinated wildflowers). If you wanted, you could get one bag of soil and try to distribute evenly across this area when you do the seeds. Nice soil never hurt but it‚Äôs not necessary. Also, if you are able to go on walks in your area, suggest to collect wildflower seeds- they‚Äôll be ready soon."

GuerrillaGardening,fp6oooe,t3_gbk70p,1588355948.0,"Hey there! I‚Äôm an environmental toxicologist. There have been many studies on contaminants and distance from roads (the farther you go from a road the less contaminants there are). So yes, I would make the same assumption for train tracks.  One possible contaminant are metals from the braking action. But there could be all types of contaminants. I hope this helps. I would not recommend planting edible plants near tracks unless you do a soil test. However, if you are set on this, there are many plants that ‚Äútake up‚Äù metals - like sunflowers. You can chop them down after the season and throw them in the trash. This will remove metals from the soil although maybe a little slowly. You can research this more by reading about residential gardens that needed to remove metals from their soil and used plants. Raised beds would potentially also lower the exposure, though I‚Äôd still plant the sunflowers, etc.

Edit: a little more info. Hydrocarbons are also a concern (think oil, gasoline, etc.). As is particulate matter (air), and these particles will deposit on soil. 

Here‚Äôs a pretty good article 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096763/

I‚Äôd consider this spot maybe a good practice garden but do native grasses and wildflowers instead"
BotanicalPorn,fp6b36m,t1_fp4irqi,1588349280.0,ok another question. So true passion fruit is purple? So if you see a vine with orange fruit is it always bad. Does the correct fruit bearing version grow in the US or is it always the thing you described?
whatsthisplant,fp54iyf,t3_gb9yv8,1588316051.0,There‚Äôs a Nevins barrberry native to the west coast of USA and agarita that is from TX area. Agarita smells really good and is related. So there are maybe some native versions of this you could look for

sanpedrocactus,fp3ctvp,t3_gawqqj,1588277083.0,You can try cutting/regrowing from any part (tip or base) and it‚Äôll probably work out. I had some sad cacti recently and I cut off the tips but kept the base in the pot. I am expecting the base to produce pups. I am also going to replant the tips and they should grow too.

You‚Äôll get better skills with a biology degree and maybe a chem minor. Or an actual zoology degree. Try searching online for zoology careers and see what‚Äôs available and if any interest you. I have three degrees in various life sciences. If I could go back and do it again I‚Äôd prob double major in biology and environmental engineering. Engineers have very good job options and good pay.

GuerrillaGardening,fogplk9,t1_fog3sq7,1587755512.0,Well consider the winter before this one. That was a good rainy winter. But with climate change our winter rains are going to be less reliable unfortunately. Your best bet is still planting plants right before winter so they can hopefully get a wet winter boost to become established. This is your best bet if you want to plant and not have to care for it!
GuerrillaGardening,fog1rx7,t3_g796e3,1587746629.0,"Hey there! I‚Äôm up in the bay. My advice is to do your research on plant species and get them ready for fall. We‚Äôre leaving the wet season and are entering the fire season. Any seed bombs etc aren‚Äôt gonna grow in the foreseeable future because there‚Äôs no water available. Use this time to get your supplies - seeds, soil, etc. and be ready to plant in Oct/Nov before the winter rains. Your plants will have a chance at growing rather than now. I hope this helps!!"
