yeah I guess its best to just assume healthy behaviors like not smoking, eating healthy, and exercising would increase your likelihood of recovery, and even if it doesn't. Doing those things are good for you anyways. But I know that nicotine, alcohol, and other drugs are immunodepressents, and It seems people who are dying have immune system problems, so like I like have a gut feeling that people who depreciate their immune system are more likely to die, and exercising and eating healthy and what not increase it, so those people are less likely to die"
unpopularopinion,fmnbslg,t1_fmn4jjq,1586222514.0,"I was also thinking, would people who smoke and vape correlate to an increased chance of death? I find it bizarre that the WHO isn't encouraging people to start increasing healthy behaviors, because imo you have a lower chance of dying if youre a more healthy human. i dont know tho"
unpopularopinion,fmnbi18,t3_fsdt3c,1586222328.0,"# Young people are not ‘invincible’ media citing WHO and Dr. Fauci is a sham to scare young people from breaking quarantine

About 1/1000 people die in the age range 0-30, and like I'm not worried about myself dying. I have a higher chance of dying when I drive, when I skate, when I surf. Like i am not that worried about dying when I do those things. So, I am just not that worried about this - for myself.

Of course I am not saying break quarantine, the death rate goes almost exponentially, starting age 50, my mom is above that age. But, I am just saying- imo- that experts and the media saying that is just a way to increase compliance with the quarantine.

I guess if that's what they have to do, they have to do that. But like no reason to try to stress me out, no chill."
