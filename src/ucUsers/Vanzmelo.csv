anime,fpl89af,t3_gdy9m7,1588708117.0,I‚Äôve gotten around to watching Sailor Moon recently and it‚Äôs just such a fun show to put on an episode or two every night. Would definitely recommend since there‚Äôs a lot of canceled shows and a lot of time now
thesims,fpl1s0m,t1_fpktbv2,1588704856.0,As someone who likes realistic playthroughs I‚Äôm intrigued by this eco living pack. Hopefully they expand on what was introduced in Island Living.

diabetes,fo9wep1,t1_fo9ul4h,1587633289.0,"Stopped buying insulin and do what exactly? We need insulin to live. Run out and we die within a few days. That fact alone is why companies like Lily and Novo Nordisk can just keep raising insulin prices with no consequences.
