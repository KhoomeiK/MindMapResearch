Android,fnn506d,t1_fnmpbnp,1587084539.0,Oh. Thanks! I thought the Samsung was as well.

Android,fnmh6bo,t3_g2czzf,1587071350.0,"Upgrading from an LG G6. I would like a headphone jack, color accurate camera (preferably with zoom), SD card tray, and reasonable specs across the board. I don't need super fast panels, depth sensors/face ID, or 5g. Considering most of these features cannot be found on one phone anymore, I've been considering the pixel 4a, redmi k30 pro zoom, or waiting on LG's velvet phone. 

The pixel 4a's memory and single lens worry me, as I quite like multiple lenses and I'm not always online to access a cloud. 

My only complaint regarding the k30 is perhaps the night performance of the camera and the lack of an SD slot. This is my top contender right now, if Xiaomi releases an international version with US 4g bands, and if i can find a good ROM. No notch is also a plus.

Velvet...is well, Velvet and unknown.

Any opinions or recommendations?

Edit: does anyone know more information regarding the k30 pro zoom?"
