UCI,forq9xd,t3_g97nhk,1588016606.0,"I had to be out the other day to get food, and the amount of people I saw....without masks...was infuriating"
OldSchoolCool,fobxqbn,t1_fobx21c,1587664844.0,"But they are neither American or Indian. People native to this land have such a diverse and complex culture that’s is so often over looked. And I can’t say I know this personally, but I doubt native people identify as American Indians since that is a termed put on them from the colonizer."
OldSchoolCool,fobwmxj,t1_fobvhzh,1587664485.0,"I understand why you would immediately think that, however I would suggest you look into the history of North American land before Americans colonized it. Many people were living on it and were unfortunately treated poorly once American people arrived and began to take over, so yes they were all born on this land, but I would not necessarily say Americans are natives."

UCI,fmvguwr,t3_fxmlxk,1586416519.0,"Wow incredible. Good idea and well produced. Actually the first time I experienced blatant racism was from another UCI student, so I’m glad other people are actively thinking and trying to create awareness to this type of thing."
TooAfraidToAsk,fmtdfvc,t3_fxa4m2,1586370866.0,"Also if they haven't reached out since they said that...you kind of just gotta emotionally disconnect. Treat others how you want to be treated, and in this sense if they are not putting effort in, then its time to stop putting effort in yourself."
