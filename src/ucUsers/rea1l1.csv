UCSC,fplom4k,t1_fplo94o,1588716526.0,"I believe you want to avoid getting a P on a majors class. IIRC you can't take a class again if you've been given a P and BSOE students need a grade for majors classes. I think you can request a NP though by withdrawing instead of changing to P/NP.

https://advising.ucsc.edu/procedures/withdrawclass.html

>Students may request a Withdrawal (with a W or NP grade) in MyUCSC by submitting a drop after the enrollment deadline.

>If a drop is submitted in MyUCSC after the add/drop/swap deadline and by the end of the sixth week of instruction (see the Academic and Administrative Calendar for deadlines), the course appears on your record with a “W” notation. After the sixth week of instruction and until the deadline listed in the Academic and Administrative Calendar, students in good academic standing may use the same process to withdraw from a course by requesting a “NP” (No Pass) notation."

legaladvice,foqv4yi,t3_g6tbml,1588001376.0,"IANAL, this is not legal advice

Duplex yards are often partitioned like the house so its obvious who gets to use what - if that's the case, when looking at the yard does the shed appear to be on your side? If so I would think that the shed would be considered a part of your rental. Of course, it all depends upon the contract. Would you like to post your contract?

•Should we have notice of lawn maintenance being done? Should that be the responsibility of the landlord to coordinate with the lawn guy?

You should coordinate with the lawn guy. There's no good reason to involve the landlord in that communication. If the lease doesn't mention lawn care you can always tell the LL that you'll take care of it and be sure to return the yard in the condition you received it in at the end of your lease.

•Should we have notice of maintenance guys coming and going to side yard and storage unit and also leaving vehicles for long periods of time? 

Ultimately it sounds like the side yard has been separately partitioned from the whole yard and reserved by the landlord for other uses and since its a duplex its up to the LL if that region is a part of your partition so it wouldn't be a part of your rental lease.

I would suggest requesting to the LL that you can install some planter boxes with lattice and vines to shield your view out of the windows facing the side yard and maybe putting a sign on the gate requesting users to close it quietly so you aren't disturbed."

LandlordLove,focurs2,t3_g6srr1,1587676163.0,"Not legal advice or anything, but I would think it depends on what's in your lease.
