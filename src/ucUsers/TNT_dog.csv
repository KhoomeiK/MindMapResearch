toontownrewritten,fplf5t0,t1_fpl0qfe,1588711611.0,That would be awesome! I miss having a core group of people to play with
toontownrewritten,fpkqh18,t1_fpk4etv,1588699259.0,That's awesome! I haven't been all that active in the past few years but I  started playing a lot recently due to the quarantine. None of my past friends are active on TTR anymore so I know that feeling :( Glad to you you still playing though! I feel really old sometimes on TTR lol
toontownrewritten,fpj56z0,t3_gdoywp,1588656934.0,"Sorry if this isn't you but are you the prof pickles mcpretzel from the old TTC forums? I was Periwinkle Cat (the black cat) on Toontown online, my name on the forums was acssf if you remember me! o:"
toontownrewritten,fpiyun2,t1_fpixc7d,1588652043.0,"If there are plenty of pictures online I would love to see them - Do you know where I could find any? I am just speaking for myself but I would be more than thrilled to see any Toontown concept art regardless of the quality of the scans. It's great that you want to honor his work, but it's been two years :(

Also - I am a bit confused about how it is okay to run a private server of ""Disneys property"" but the line is drawn at sharing concept art of the game with the community, especially when said art is displayed at conventions and posted online by other people. If possible could you elaborate more? Because it's hard to imagine Disney would care about concept art being shared more than the actual game being hosted for free"
UCSC,fpiy23f,t1_fpiwlvp,1588651467.0,Yea I also really would like to know this. It seems like the easiest thing to do would be to base it off the FAFSA info they already have instead of asking all of these different groups and organizations? Especially since a lot of people need the money now..
UCSC,fpiex85,t3_gdng9r,1588639506.0,Good news if youâ€™re a Graduate student who last submitted a FAFSA in 2005 though
toontownrewritten,fpfkdnt,t1_fpfjxc5,1588573950.0,"I think that part is just referring to the NPCs of Disney characters (Mickey, Donald, etc) that used to walk around the playgrounds. Even with that in mind though I wouldn't consider TTR to be ""scrubbed of copyright material"" since you can still see these characters all over on street signs and above the tunnels in the playground so who knows"
toontownrewritten,fpfiqgt,t1_fpfg94r,1588572476.0,"Wow, thank you for sharing!  It really sounds like he donated the art with the intent for it to be preserved and shared with everyone who loves Toontown.  So disappointing. :("
toontownrewritten,fpfi13v,t1_fpfhkv6,1588571855.0,I'm honestly shocked that they would hide something like this from the community... why would Bruce donate the art if he wanted it to stay private? It just doesn't make sense :/ I would rather they admit that they just want to keep it for themselves
toontownrewritten,fpfe928,t3_gd045x,1588568693.0,It makes me really sad to hear that they would keep it to themselves if this is true. Did you contact Bruce Woodside via email? If so could you post a screenshot of the interaction? I'm curious to hear what he said - it's awesome that he is still replying to fans almost 20 years later! Makes me think he wouldn't want this art kept private :/
toontownrewritten,fpbmre7,t3_gchqpv,1588473628.0,Itâ€™s the outfit they gave out last year for the crash cashbot event! I guess thatâ€™s what the resistance rangers are giving out currently. Kind of disappointing since I thought it would be a new outfit but at least new players get a chance!
toontownrewritten,fpazwlw,t3_gcewkf,1588459192.0,"There are so many awesome clothes from past events that I wish TTR would bring back. Even if they cannot logistically redo the events, I would be so happy if these outfits could somehow be made available again. In particular, I would do anything to get [this skirt](http://cdn.toontown.disney.go.com/toontown/en/blog/img/2012/11-07/acorn-acres-cup-large.jpg) from a 2012 golf contest </3

[Here is another](http://www.toontowncentral.com/gallery/data/2504/Toon_News_9_-_3719.jpg) example! Looking at this makes me so nostalgic, I almost forgot about some of these entirely. Please TTR let these come back someday! I think they are awesome."
UCSC,fp55h4o,t3_gbce7a,1588316951.0,is this the same thing as the $1200/month that dependents didnâ€™t qualify or something different? Iâ€™m out of the loop ðŸ˜­
UCSC,fp37wyd,t3_gayudz,1588274643.0,I was wondering why is it always kresge that gets vandalized? It really doesnâ€™t make any sense
UCSC,fo815ft,t1_fo80vh4,1587588059.0,"Alright, thanks!"
UCSC,fo5w45t,t3_g5uqri,1587537616.0,Did anyone else not receive any emails at all? I was relieved to not get the first one but now Iâ€™m just even more confused
UCSC,fo3prbi,t1_fo3ohv7,1587490937.0,"Yeah, I know the pandemic may have caused some delays but this is a lot of money that I rely on and itâ€™s stressful to be in the dark like this :/"
UCSC,fo3o667,t3_g5i80j,1587490176.0,Yes I am in the same boat as you. I havenâ€™t been able to get through any phone # or emails and iâ€™m not sure who to contact or what to do :/
acturnips,fo1oulq,t3_g578ls,1587438052.0,Apple!
UCSC,fnu0ogy,t1_fntoq7d,1587252257.0,"Okay thatâ€™s good then, so it sounds like the school just straight up forgot to send everyones GPAs then? My twin brother who goes to UCD also got the same email so Iâ€™m thinking it might be a UC issue."
UCSC,fntju6u,t1_fntj595,1587243101.0,"That is how it has always been in the past, which is why I am so confused it apparently did not go through this time"
UCSC,fntahmn,t1_fnt8yib,1587237777.0,Ugh I bet youâ€™re right... I am still missing a grade from fall 2019. I feel like Iâ€™m going to throw up Iâ€™m so worried right now
UCSC,fntabo9,t1_fnt84re,1587237684.0,"Nope, nothing. I had to go check the webgrants4students website and thatâ€™s where I saw my application was incomplete. I would have never known if I didnâ€™t see the other posts and decide to check. Idk why I wasnâ€™t contacted"
UCSC,fnt44sn,t3_g3fna0,1587234252.0,I didn't get an email about mine but I checked and it says I need to send GPA verification. Has anyone figured this out? I don't know what to do since the appeal deadline has already passed and the website says the school is supposed to send this information automatically. :/
UCSC,fnig1ld,t3_g1z0k5,1586979372.0,bruh
UCSC,fn1pion,t3_fysk43,1586567122.0,I still haven't received a grade for THEA 61A from fall quarter 2019
UCSC,fmg8ujg,t3_fv1o0y,1586043725.0,itâ€™s always been around the end of may or so
