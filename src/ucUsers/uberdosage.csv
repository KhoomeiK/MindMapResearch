He has been above league average efficiency what, once or twice? The dude had Kevin Durant and that OKC teams were great yet still had trash efficiency. Spacing isn't what makes you one of the worst volume shooters, dumb ass shot selection does.


Spacing would not make him stop doing pull up 3's for <30% or pull up short twos for 40%. Or even pull up short twos for 30% like last season. He did it with Durant, and the reason why he is doing well on the Rockets is yes the spacing, but also him not putting up garbage shots."
