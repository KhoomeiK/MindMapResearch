TheLastAirbender,fp8tjmn,t1_fp8kf9n,1588402505.0,"Wasn't my intention to make it an us vs. them thing. I love both subs. What I meant was that there is a lot more Prequel media than there is TLA media, so there are a lot more choices to make content with than say this sub which only has a few shows and comics. 

Hence why I responded to the guy making a joke about how this sub only has like 7 different memes. It was just a thought that came to my mind after reading top comment. This sub will naturally have less to talk about than a sub with more media behind it."
TheLastAirbender,fp8t85t,t1_fp8h41t,1588402205.0,That's been over for a few weeks now lol. There's plenty of other content.

KingdomHearts,fp8bh3e,t3_gbkdop,1588388187.0,"Man, KH1 had such an air of mystery and magic to it that the other games never quite matched. 

You really felt like such a small part of something much larger than yourself, slowly peeling back one layer of the story at a time, but never truly understanding everything (because neither did Sora). 

I can't even fully describe it. KH2 is my favorite, but none of the other games make me feel the way KH1 does."

Throughout the series there are bits of writing that just don't make sense, but nobody really cares because its hitting us emotionally, getting us to feel something. And thats also how we form an attachment to the franchise, by associating all these emotions with KH."
