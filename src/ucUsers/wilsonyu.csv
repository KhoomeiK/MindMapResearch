ApplyingToCollege,fpfva11,t3_g5v7rl,1588584823.0,"CC is not trash! I can't understand why and how people came up with that argument. I grew up hearing the same ignorant concerns from my parents and peers. It made me feel really bad when I had to go to CC after HS. But after the first year, I realized it was the best choice that I had made in my life! Not only did it saved me 2 years of money on low div courses, it also gave me time to figure out what I actually want to do. I have heard a lot stories where people graduated from university with either a useless degree, where they can't even get a decent job, or they're forced to have the degree because they can't afford to quit or change it. And now going to CC trying to get a new degree.

 If you are those people who already had a rock solid plan of what you're going to do with your life and going to UC is how you'll achieve it. Then the obvious choice is to go to a UC. But if you have even a little bit of doubt about what you want to do and don't want to end up with 60 - 100k of unforgivable student debt, go to a CC.

See if any of these info can help you convince your mom!"
