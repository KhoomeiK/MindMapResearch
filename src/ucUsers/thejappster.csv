UCSantaBarbara,fpiv3rm,t1_fpisyh6,1588649416.0,"The first four labs for 126AL are cancer and take the whole time. You will feel like shit those first 4 weeks as the lab reports are tedious and the labs take the whole day. Afterwards, the lab take less than the whole time every time. 

I got out at 2-3 pm starting the fifth lab. There are only 7 labs in 126AL. 126BL has 9 labs with a final dead week. Those labs get out 2-3 pm or sometimes earlier."
