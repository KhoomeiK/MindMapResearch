longbeach,fpc2tyx,t3_gckpue,1588485815.0,"Oh Frontier.

1) They forced me to take their router when I signed up, despite my already having a router. They charge a monthly router rental fee, of course.

2) I requested to send their router back to them, so they sent me a box. I took video of me packing it and dropping it off at the UPS store, saved the receipt, etc.

3) They claimed to have not received it and tried to charge me an exorbitant fee. Funnily enough, all it took was for me to tell them tracking number for them to claim it was a ""mistake"" and the fee would be removed.

4) The router rental fee? Yeah, that stayed on the bill. They still charge you the fee even if you return their shitty router back to them. [Fortunately this may be changing soon](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/01/us-finally-prohibits-isps-from-charging-for-routers-they-dont-provide/) (though no doubt they will claim I never sent their router back to them and try to keep charging me for it).

This is my favorite hassle-free local airport and far and away beats the experience at LAX. It's a good alternative to SNA as well if you are flying in for Disneyland.

* History: when I first flew through LGB, the gate areas were literally portable trailers. I'm not making this up. Luckily about a decade ago they modernized the airport and now it's one of the nicest, most convenient airports around.
* Airlines: LGB is slot restricted. It used to be a B6 fortress, but WN got their foot in the door a couple years ago and is absolutely eating B6's lunch right now—good news if you have a CP. B6 has retreated from a ton of their short-haul flying, and I would not be surprised if they pull out entirely at some point since their yields are horrible and there's a bunch of bad blood between them and the city of Long Beach. Note that B6 transcons are NOT on Mint, unlike LAX and BUR. DL and AA fly a couple trips a day to SLC and PHX, respectively. HA recently started flying to HNL on their A321neo. The LGB-HNL leg is flight 69. Nice.
* Local transportation: Long Beach Transit has a couple buses that run every so often, but it's nothing substantial and not advisable if your destination is anywhere outside the city of Long Beach. There are plenty of rideshare and rental car options.
* Check-in: the airport uses the old terminal building, which is very tiny and retro, but functional. Supposedly it is supposed to be refurbished soon, but who knows with COVID-19. There used to be a restaurant upstairs with great planespotting views but it closed several years ago.
* Security: absolutely painless if you have PreCheck. I am through in 3 minutes or less most days. There may be a decent-ish wait for non-PreCheck during holidays and whatnot.
* Airside: once you exit security, you enter an open-air patio area. You can turn left or right. The south concourse building to your left is smaller and only has a few concession options. The north concourse building to your right is larger and has more options. It's an easy walk between the two. The gate areas are decently nice and modern.
* Boarding: like at BUR, there are no jetbridges, so you can do rear-door boarding if the aircraft type allows it.
* Lounges: absolutely nothing but I've never minded.
* Food: most options are pretty expensive and generally just okay quality at best. I'm a big fan of George's Greek Cafe's regular locations, but less impressed with their airport offerings. 4th St. Vine is nice for a pre-flight drink, especially most of the year when temperatures permit outdoor drinking on the patio (though again, pricey). I don't think I've ever had a *bad* dining experience here, but I've never been impressed by anything, either.
* Off-airport dining: I would much rather stop by [The Hangar at LBX](https://thelongbeachexchange.com/the-hangar/) before a flight. It's a 4-5 minute drive from the terminal building and features a ton of cool dining options. Bottlecraft there has a huge tap list."
churning,fow8bec,t1_fovt31u,1588114872.0,"One thing to add for SFO Int'l arrivals: the baggage carousels are tiny, so they have attendants who aggressively move luggage off the carousel, even before it has a chance to make a full circuit. It's insanely annoying. Don't do what I did and stand at the carousel for 45 minutes like an idiot because they took my bag off without me noticing."

service_dogs,fojqu7s,t3_g7qitj,1587827436.0,"I have a program hearing dog (CCI) and he is NOT trained to perform the type of task you are describing, which is called intelligent disobedience. Intelligent disobedience is more commonly associated with guide dog training. It’s also really hard to train. If you watch the Disney+ series “Pick of the Litter,” you can see how challenging it is to teach and practice intelligent disobedience. I am not aware of any organizations aside from guide dog orgs that teach it.

Also, keep in mind that for many people with anxiety, service dogs make their anxiety worse, not better. You will constantly be stared at in public, be peppered with questions and patronizing comments, and have people do wildly inappropriate things like attempt to pet your dog. That’s not even mentioning an access denial situation. An ESA has no access rights outside of housing and (for now) air travel, and may be appropriate for providing support at home."

You also don’t seem to understand CC governance. CCs haven’t been associated with school districts literally in decades. Cypress and OCC are part of multi-college districts, and LBCC is a single-college district, but that has virtually nothing to do with stability."
longbeach,foho8vo,t3_g7gnow,1587769413.0,"Hi! Full-time professor at Cerritos College here. Before my current job, I had various adjunct teaching stints at SMC, GWC, IVC, and CSULB. I also got my B.A. from UCLA and my master's from CSULB.

These are all good schools. There is no wrong or right decision. But consider the following:

* I generally only refer people to specific schools if there is a specialized program they're interested in. Cerritos has really renowned trade tech and culinary arts programs, for example. I could be wrong, but creative writing doesn't really strike me as that sort of specialized program. (Though I understand the attraction of something like SMC's Scholars/Transfer Alliance Program and you are really committed to pursuing UCLA).
* Traffic. Oh my god. One semester I commuted from LB to SMC for an 8:00am class and it was just awful. All those special programs SMC has? You're going to skip all the ones that make your hellish commute any longer. Your entire college life will be dictated by the 405. Similar deal with OCC.
* Quality of faculty: it's not going to be noticeably different from school to school. Every school will have rock star faculty, faculty who are just rocks (because they're lifeless), and faculty who are somewhere in between the two. Every school will rely a lot on part-time adjuncts, many of whom are young and learning on the job. Every school will have experienced full-timers like me who are really plugged into the campus and can direct you to all kinds of resources.
* Transfer rates: they're not the end-all, be-all. Yes, some schools have a tangible transfer ""culture"" compared to other schools. But there's also a bit of a self-selection effect in play, because a lot of the extra-motivated students who want to transfer are actively going out of their way to attend those schools. Most of those students would transfer anyway if they stayed at their local CC. I work with plenty of transfer-caliber students at Cerritos, and precisely zero of them are held back just because they ""only"" go to Cerritos.
* Quality of student life: every school has student life. Yes, the student life scene might be numerically larger at some schools compared to others, but again, that is driven more by self-selection than by funding considerations. If you want opportunities to get involved in clubs or student government, you can find those opportunities at any school. Hell, I manage a $40k budget for the Cerritos speech and debate team and I am constantly recruiting new students for my team. (Sadly, LBCC does not have a speech and debate team).

Again, no right or wrong decisions to be made here. But hey, consider Cerritos! We're just up the 605 ;)"

service_dogs,fnztmp3,t3_g4vd8x,1587400546.0,"There is no identification requirement for service dogs in the US. While some ADI organizations give ID cards to their graduates, those are more useful in countries where ADI status is legally meaningful. 

In the US, some handlers do choose to present ID in public access situations because it is “easier” than explaining the law. The problem is this creates an expectation that other handlers must also have identification to show, which can cause access denials for handlers not carrying ID.

As for this particular ID, I find it incredibly problematic. The styling heavily implies that it is a genuine state document. If you show this to someone, it would only reinforce the idea that a handler must present “official” credentials for access. It’s not cute and has potential to do a great deal of harm."

service_dogs,fn4788y,t3_fzgdvj,1586635469.0,"You seem to have a few misconceptions with regards to ESAs.

* An ESA provides emotional comfort to its owner for the purpose of mitigating one or more disabling health conditions.
* Unlike service animals, ESAs do not (or more precisely, do not need to) perform tasks.
* Yes, online/questionable ESA prescriptions - usually meant to evade pet restrictions in the context of housing or air travel - are a real problem. However:
   * ESA prescription abuse has less to do with whether a particular animal is trained or not and has more to do with whether the animal's owner has a legitimate disability-related need for an ESA. 
   * The larger problem is the common misconception that ESAs have public access rights (which they do not).

In mentioning training for your ESA, you seem to be describing tasks more akin to what a psychiatric service dog would perform. You can certainly teach your ESA tasks to perform strictly in an in-home setting, but if you have any intention of transitioning your ESA to performing service work in a public access setting, you will need the assistance of a professional trainer, preferably one with experience training service dogs. Keep in mind that not all dogs are suitable for service work as well."

Law is not a field I would go into if job security was high on my list of priorities.

That said, I almost went to law school instead of going into academia, so when I play career counselor for students who say they are interested in law, I tell them law school can make sense if:

* You are attending a top 14 law school, OR you are attending a well-regarded school on a full ride or nearly full ride scholarship in the same region you want to practice in.
* You have a good sense of what being a lawyer is actually like and what kinds of jobs are realistically available to you. (So when students tell me they want to practice environmental law and protect the environment, I tell them they seriously need to do some more research).

If you don't meet those criteria, then for the love of god, please do not take out six figures of student loans to go to law school. But if you do meet those criteria, great!"
