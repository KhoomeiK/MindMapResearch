Outside of grad schools, pretty much no one cares about your GPA (sorry!, it doesn’t mean your hard work hasn’t taught you some good foundational skills and taught you how to work effectively).

*You might talk to a faculty member sometime about how a single poor or no pass grade is perceived by grad schools.

You were admitted to Irvine because you were a strong, well rounded student in high school; now you are studying with others who are just the same. You can’t *all* be the best at college! Additionally, as the style of work is so different than high school’s, GPAs tend to drop in the first year. Many students will get their first C, D, or F, which can be pretty terrifying.

But for most students, GPAs also trend back up as they adjust. A 4.0 is rare at college, you’re doing just fine in the B range and you’ll graduate just as well in the C range. 

Go to class (you’d be surprised how many don’t); sign up for the learning center (LARC) from day one; go to faculty office hours if you are confused; and seriously, listen to your academic advisors over your peers.

Once you are enter one of the four-year schools as a freshman you are considered to have “filled” your seat in the state’s system. You can’t just get up and take another seat because you don’t like your school or didn’t get into your first pick. You *may* be approved for transfer, particularly at the less selective schools and/or into non-impacted majors but as mentioned earlier, community college students get first crack at the seats.

Additionally, pretty much every school in the country has allowed or is considering some grade flexibility; you wouldn’t look different than anyone else.

You don’t have to decide right now, there are weeks to go in the term. Or you could change to P/NP and back to letter grade if you are feeling better about your scores. Do the best you can in the class while you think about what feels right to you.

They aren’t looking at them to see if you are a “good fit.” They look at them largely to see if there is something on there that gives them a little more sense about your background. Did you explain what caused your GPA to drop one term? Is there a barrier you faced that perhaps other students did not? That kind of thing. It can help them fill in something that doesn’t match up to the rest of your application. If it does, the evaluator may give you a tiny bump in the assessment, that’s all. There is no penalty for a “bad” essay, because that’s not what they use them for; if you look closely, they don’t even call them essays. Some of the UC’s don’t even read them, just rely on GPA and test scores.

Tl;dr your writing prompt might earn you a tiny bump; it won’t ever take any points away.

I’m sure your friend is an amazing student but perhaps overall he didn’t have the full characteristics his department was looking for this year. Honestly you never know how these things will go. Faculty could be looking for something else next year. I know that is super frustrating but that’s how it works.

Edit to say international students have to meet a higher set of admission criteria than anyone else. California residents have the “lowest;” then non California domestic U.S. students; then international. None of the criteria are easy, as you already know!

UCI,fo6xdvk,t3_g5z6g2,1587568497.0,"I’m sorry you’re struggling with class; this stuff is quite an adjustment for sure.

You can reach out to the graduate admissions office at Berkeley and ask; I would.

I’d also reach out to one of the faculty here and ask them how they think a single P/NP course would (or would not) generally impact assessment at a grad school. It may be that your letters of recommendation matter more or that graduate schools know students sometimes have a blip in the transcript that they can speak to. Faculty are the people that evaluate grad applications so they are the most knowledgeable.

COVID-19 is having mass impact on how colleges are grading this term. At Berkeley, for example, the standard undergraduate grade for everything is P/NP; students have to opt in to letter grades. Basically the reverse of what Irvine is doing. 

You can’t be sure about specific schools without asking them but every graduate campus is going to know Spring 20 was a crazy time. In the interim, keep doing as well as you can in the class; you have plenty of time to move to P/NP if that’s what you ultimately want.
