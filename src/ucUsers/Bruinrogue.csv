saltierthancrait,fpmyxmq,t3_ge4pz7,1588745395.0,The 12 year old me would've been thrilled to see Star Wars toys able to be bought from $.50-$10.00 at the Disney employee store. The me right now realizes it's just sequel trilogy trash.

saltierthancrait,fpjdmkb,t1_fpfyzke,1588664689.0,And I hope they give Filoni more control.
saltierthancrait,fpj9w2v,t3_gdnym2,1588661079.0,He's part of team Filoni so he's definitely not a KK guy.
saltierthancrait,fpj9uui,t3_gdpha6,1588661046.0,I have no desire to ever watch this again so I'll take your word for it.
saltierthancrait,fpj9sz6,t3_gdm5rk,1588660997.0,The hero we need. A true SW fan through and through.
saltierthancrait,fpj9ljv,t3_gdgrsk,1588660813.0,We didn't go wrong. The Sequel Trilogy shills along with Kathleen Kennedy and her minions went wrong. Nobody spoke up after TFA so we got TLJ. Some spoke up after TLJ but not enough and we were punished with TROS.  *The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for the good to do nothing.*
saltierthancrait,fpj92ml,t3_gdnw7w,1588660331.0,"Definitely, but then it would've negated the safe plagiarism that an unimaginative stooge like Abrams can only think of."

saltierthancrait,fphz5p2,t1_fpfts0w,1588630532.0,I would imagine it's Disney that's more interested in Ezra.
saltierthancrait,fpftl2q,t1_fpfpjgu,1588582998.0,Same. Rebels for me was just eh. Sort of like an imitation Clone Wars but just never got there.
saltierthancrait,fpftjz7,t1_fpfo8lm,1588582965.0,They released it 12:00 midnight EST (or 9 where I am).
saltierthancrait,fpfkgz9,t3_gd2dyc,1588574034.0,"No, TROS isn't to blame for anything other than hammering the nail in the coffin. TFA started the entire thing by setting up a terrible universe to begin with."

saltierthancrait,fpb9dai,t3_gcfqjm,1588464915.0,OT character arcs. Whatever happens in the ST can be easily bundled into a trash bag and dropped easily. But we can never redo what happened to Leia anymore.
saltierthancrait,fpb99zy,t3_gcbe9l,1588464857.0,They fit fine for their respective roles in my opinion.
TheJediPraxeum,fp92cp8,t1_fp8velj,1588411626.0,"That game was ok. Definitely didn't have the depth nor extensive gameplay JO/JA had. But yeah, I used to love just modding and spawning a million stormtroopers vs Kyle which was pretty fun."
TheJediPraxeum,fp8v81l,t3_gbxgve,1588404127.0,Outcast/Academy were incredible. Made me wish they could do a reskin of Jedi Knight I with the updated graphics.
saltierthancrait,fp8liv7,t3_gboby2,1588395524.0,Well done. A slam on both TROS and Solo!
saltierthancrait,fp8heey,t3_gbkqwb,1588392358.0,"See, when the payoff is great, almost everyone is happy. Endgame did it, this is doing it. But when you come up with ""Somehow Palpatine returned"", ""I am all the Jedi"", and ""Rey Skywalker""...."

saltierthancrait,fp3lup5,t3_gauttt,1588281591.0,Not quite Mos Eisley. More of a Mos Eisley+Espa+a little extra. Just speaking as a fly on the wall in the room where it happened.
Dodgers,fp3l5wm,t3_gayomr,1588281238.0,We need to dispel the notion that Dave Roberts can't win a WS because he should've won 2.

saltierthancrait,fozpjlf,t3_gagghm,1588194619.0,"Three things. One, Disney has power, enough to sway the fences. Two, Rian's wife is a film critic and critics love to circle the wagons around their own. Three, many of them hate SW to begin with and the ones that didn't (Roger Ebert, et al) have passed away."
saltierthancrait,fozpaj9,t3_gafalx,1588194496.0,"The issue a lot of people had with prequel dialogue had more to do with the romance between Anakin and Padme. As much as Reylos think there is, there's not any romance in the ST."
saltierthancrait,foxedh3,t1_fox5nv0,1588141446.0,"Haha thanks. I do think there'll be room for a Wall-E attraction. But maybe not for another 3-5 years. 

Disney doesn't have much power in the Japan parks but they still have significant say in the others. Thing with the international parks is that there are bigger investors as well in the mix, and therefore bigger budget and more freedom somehow. 

Yeah, and the best part of RotR is that it's easily modifiable to OT. A switcharoo of the video, swapping the animatronic characters and voila, OT. 

Sad thing about Indy was that it was conceived during Eisner's time so lots of corners cut but they still made the most of it!"
saltierthancrait,foww662,t1_fovqemv,1588128450.0,"Well, naturally, nobody knew back then that Tatooine would be in all 3 because they pulled TROS out of their asses and did stuff on the fly!"
saltierthancrait,foww2ny,t1_fowsx8n,1588128391.0,"Well, if I ever get a new job with them (got my pink slip and we'll keep you in mind email after ROTR completed as a last one in, first one out), I'll be sure to do so haha. I don't think you'll ever see a non-IP until a new park opens or it's for China/Japan/Paris TBH. 

Well, my favorite since I'm biased is Rise of the Resistance since it's all I ever worked on! Prior to that it was the Indy ride, which my dad's firm helped work on!"
saltierthancrait,fowo0bf,t1_fow4qlv,1588123591.0,"Well, there are some callbacks to prequels and OT's hidden in nooks and crannies that upper management wouldn't notice haha.

Imagineers from the highest director levels to the 3rd party associates are split on IP-heavy. In one aspect, IP lends itself a lot of easy foundations to work on and can be cheaper (and more supportive of risk averse types). On the other, it stifles some creativity that could otherwise create new IP. I know a lot in the creative departments want to have more freedom to create non-IP's. That does clash hard with those in more corporate or analysis departments.

The general consensus on Chapek is that he's an unsociable and very stingy bean counter with no imagination or desire for innovation. Right now, Iger's taking back some of the CEO roles but a lot of people are still weary. It might help that many divisions are pseudo-independent as far as creative control but once they butt heads over budgets, things could be heated."
saltierthancrait,fovwsgt,t3_g9tk6b,1588108892.0,"Yeah, that's pretty much how it went. I got to see a lot of the pre-ST designs. Very much that Mos Eisley/Espa feel. Lots of WDI Imagineers and associates like myself tried to petition against this change but were overruled. We still did the best we could but a lot of us were severely disappointed. Many of us knew the order came from above and likely figured KK had a hand in it."
NotMyStarWars,foryint,t3_g9802g,1588020744.0,One is an innovator who made friends with a powerful producer in Frank Marshall. The other is a pencil-pusher who is married to a powerful producer in Frank Marshall.
saltierthancrait,forqsgo,t3_g8rw30,1588016871.0,"1. Rogue One - Honestly, only here by default. While I prefer Kyle Katarn as my Death Star plans head-canon, they had some interesting characters except Cassian. 
2. Solo - Disjointed because of the director musical chair mismanagement by KK but still ok. Ruined Han's Imperial career and how he and Chewie met. But 2nd half was fine enough.
3. Flaming bag of crap with a SW logo on the paper bag.
4. TFA - Paint by numbers sci-fi movie that copies ANH in a lazy attempt to trick simple-minded SW fans into thinking it's good. Sets up uninspired and bland Rebels v Empire II universe with no Jedi Academy. Ruins Han Solo.
5. ROTS - Hilariously bad. Like Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad. But run at a Michael Bay pace to trick idiot SW fans into thinking it's exciting and to prevent viewers from seeing its many many many many many many many many many faults. Actually, Michael Bay movies are more fun and make more sense. Ridiculous things like ""I AM ALL THE JEDI"" ""PALPATINE IS BACK SOMEHOW"" ""I TAKE SOMEONE ELSES LAST NAME JUST BECAUSE"" But nice visuals. 
6. TLJ - Bland. Completely derails franchise. Ruins Luke Skywalker. Also filled with stupid things."
saltierthancrait,forpprz,t3_g95u91,1588016328.0,"You can only do so much with the material that's given. They aren't his regular 5 star scores but still a solid 4. Either way, it's another example of KK/JJ/RJ wasting the opportunity to work with legends to make a great SW trilogy."
saltierthancrait,foofpuj,t3_g8hx0d,1587938136.0,Sam Witwer is a great guy. A true SW fan to his core. Had the pleasure of meeting him just randomly on the Celebration floor many times. Hopefully Favreau and Filoni wrestle control of LF from KK so he can be better in the fold than on fringe.
Dodgers,fom4gms,t3_g85e6r,1587878055.0,"We need to start a fundraiser to bubble wrap every square inch of Vin Scully's home. This is 2020, I don't want to take any chances."
saltierthancrait,fokz4vp,t3_g7wknd,1587851720.0,"It was a platform of failure. I can see why it tricked gullible fans into thinking it was good simply by parroting ANH but from a distance, anyone should be able to see it was a terrible launchpad."
saltierthancrait,fokyyuq,t3_g7wyqw,1587851628.0,This is Kathleen Kennedy's pet project. This may be her last attempt to save her job considering the only successes so far are projects she isn't allowed to be involved in (Mandalorian).

saltierthancrait,fo9kuma,t3_g5ys1r,1587622479.0,"Other than Rey's theme, really not the best out of JW. But of course, it can be hard to score something when the source material is absolute garbage as it was for most of 7-9."
saltierthancrait,fo9ks90,t3_g6en02,1587622421.0,Welcome to today's Hollywood.
saltierthancrait,fo9kpw0,t3_g6ejuk,1587622364.0,"I agree with this. As someone who works (or I guess still works) for Disney and has a soft spot for Iger, they give a lot of leeway and authority to the presidents of the individual entities. It's why MCU has been so well organized while LF is a mess. Iger and Disney certainly set the guidelines and the necessity to overcome the prequel stigma plus the well-meaning intention of having a seasoned Hollywood lifer to guide the filmmaking process, but it was KK and her minions who set about completely destroying everything because of their lack of respect for SW fans and the lore."
saltierthancrait,fo9ke2q,t3_g6bjq1,1587622086.0,"ME3's only fault was that they made a wholly unsatisfying ending and a few other small issues in the plot. The gameplay was actually top notch and they continued to push the barriers despite the difficulties of a very unwieldy number of options. Unlike LF though, Bioware acknowledged fan discontent and made the apology with extended endings that were at least better."
saltierthancrait,fo9k6ro,t3_g6bkv0,1587621912.0,Instead we get stupid looking bombers that any regular person would know makes no military sense at all.

saltierthancrait,fo5aoqc,t3_g5mbg8,1587521200.0,Thrawn Trilogy must automatically be canon regardless of where you start. That book trilogy reinvigorated SW fandom during a dark era. I would add X-Wing and Courtship of Princess Leia into the mix as well. My personal canon goes all the way to the beginning but not including NJO.

saltierthancrait,fo0uq9e,t3_g4u5to,1587420123.0,They use it to make themselves feel better after an utter failure and circle the wagons.  It's the result of the participation trophy culture that persists today. You're getting paid megabucks and the end result is worse than a typical fan fiction?
