1. I don't think you're crazy and yet the situation is not unacceptable. Obviously, they have chosen to act in a careless manner. And yes, their actions do pose some risk to people other than themselves. However, consider your options. If your goal is to get people to social distance, then what are your options? Do you think this reddit post will help accomplish this goal? Are there any other courses of action that would have a more direct impact? Maybe there just isn't anything you can do but accept that others will act in this manner and do your best to protect yourself and the people you care about.
2. this! so much this! i literally cant even with these people that dont care about anyone else but themselves. losing all faith in humanity rn. maybe, just maybe, we can put off getting drunk to protect those at risk in our community? it's called being a decent human being. how *problematic*. #flattenthecurve"
