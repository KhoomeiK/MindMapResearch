ucr,fpf2eul,t3_gcy59o,1588560204.0,"Sounds like you have a bunch of dickhead classmates. You should be fine, you have proof that you asked after the quiz was due, so there's no reason for you to get in trouble."
ucr,fox8whf,t3_g9vz1r,1588137051.0,"I just dropped a class recently, and I did the work assigned beforehand (halfassed to the max) just in case. I don't really see why they would deny any request, especially now due to all the circumstances. You should be fine."
ucr,folmnqx,t3_g82mjt,1587865578.0,"There’s only like one topic from 9c in 10a. And you don’t really need to know it super in-depth because they go over it again. Other than that, they aren’t related much at all."

Make sure to email your advisor too, it might help you get the form approved quicker!"
