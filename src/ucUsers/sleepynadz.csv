berkeley,fpj8ydd,t1_fo1nir5,1588660222.0,"thank you for this! I read it long ago but Im revisiting now, I think I am just emotionally attached to UCSC and am terrified the level of rigor will bring down my GPA (worried bc law school admissions care about GPA). Still contemplating but definitely leaning towards Cal now that advisors have excused me from all pre reqs/some major courses. 

My study habits at UCSC are not the best, I can do the bare minimum and get nothing less than an A- and I am sure it wont be the same at Cal. 

That being said, whats the workload like in most philosophy classes? and what are the exams like? I’m trying to brace myself for the worst & are there any professors you recommend in particular?"

berkeley,fntl0zz,t1_fntackm,1587243784.0,"Generally speaking I enjoy the city/Berkeley area a lot more than Santa Cruz, a lot of my best friends from high school attend Cal and I often feel lonely at UCSC with little friends who are kinda only my friends bc I live with them? If that makes sense. Overall nothing is super bad about UCSC it’s just not fun lol? I visit Cal a lot and am pretty familiar with the area. 

Also a lot of people have told me the nature of Berkeley is helpful because it streamlines your professional growth and there is a lot more opportunities in the city. Overall UCB looks better on a resume as opposed to UCSC.

Academically wise staying at UCSC seems the most logical to me since Law school really cares about your GPA and at UCSC I have almost a perfect GPA (but at what cost haha). I emailed the Cal philosophy advisor and asked if some of my classes may count and they said they would try to make adjustments once I send in syllabi. 

I’m mostly worried about the level of rigor and competition from UCSC as compared to UCB. Like philosophy at UCSC is pretty easy imo the lowest grade I have ever gotten in a class is an A- with bare minimum effort which I am assuming wont be the case at Cal? I don’t want to jeopardize my GPA for a better titled school but I know I can work harder and still have a good GPA (I hope). 

Definitely need more insight on philo classes at Cal and the level of difficulty."
