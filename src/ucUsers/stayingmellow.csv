Edit: clarification about requirements meaning for helping to build Blockeley!"

college,foi4k12,t1_foi3ddy,1587778567.0,"It was sent to us in an email but I found the exact same announcement posted on the official Berkeley news.

[https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/23/information-about-fall-semester-2020/](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/04/23/information-about-fall-semester-2020/)"
college,fohlnv7,t1_fofcucu,1587768025.0,"UC Berkeley has released an official statement that Fall 2020 will have some or all classes be online, dependent on the public health crisis during the semester. 

It was sent to us in an email to all Berkeley students, so not exactly sure how to link something like that. Also I doubt many institutions will make a “firm decision” at this point in time given that it’s completely fluid depending on how the crisis is closer to the fall"

LifeProTips,fodoroi,t1_fodkoms,1587687311.0,Thank you so much for the recommendations! Sounds like it might make for a practical gift for her later when she goes to college!
LifeProTips,fodogh9,t1_fodia20,1587687202.0,NOO that’s awful!! I hope this gives you those hours of good dreams and sleep back! 🐑
LifeProTips,fodihml,t1_foc9pxp,1587685106.0,Thank you - may you be blessed with lots of good sleep! 🛏
LifeProTips,fodhzhq,t1_fodg4ec,1587684921.0,"Yeah...she’s unfortunately a super deep sleeper so sometimes she does it on purpose to be petty  (she’s always been so super sweet growing up but recently does things out of character - I attribute it to her being in her rebellious years) and most other times it’s just because she literally can’t wake up for her life. She has tried regular alarm clocks, Android, and more but it’s all the same for her so she just sticks to her iPhone lol"
LifeProTips,fodh4jg,t1_fodftl3,1587684620.0,Hahaha it’s unfortunately the former when she’s being petty and mad at me and the latter on most other days because she’s a super deep sleeper 😴
LifeProTips,fodgjsm,t1_fod2k87,1587684410.0,Hopefully it’s at least a chaotic good 😇😂
LifeProTips,fobzs6p,t1_fobzk5a,1587665505.0,I’m so glad! Hope it helps (:

ProductManagement,fldracu,t1_flcy0ww,1585070173.0,"What’s different about it is that it’s a test regarding fixing the company’s entire product from start to finish, asking for multiple, very detailed and specific items that may require more than just 2-3 hours. I didn’t include the assessment in full so as to not give away the company’s identity, but it’s actually insanely long for a 1st round interview, especially compared to the multitudes of other APM assessments I’ve done in the past. 

They definitely gave the same questions to other candidates, and I find it strange that for a company that’s been around for almost a decade, they don’t have many Glassdoor reviews and still have fewer than 50 employees."
