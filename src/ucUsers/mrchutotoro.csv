bioinformatics,fpi2dwb,t1_fpi11in,1588632314.0,You would need to use another tool to call events first or basecall the reads and match the headers between the fast5 and fastq files. From there you can subsample based on number of bases to certain headers. Then you can use the API to extract those reads.
bioinformatics,fph7x53,t1_fpgp0t5,1588616539.0,"In that case, I'd recommend you use [ONT's fast5 API.](https://github.com/nanoporetech/ont_fast5_api) You'll have to write your own code to subsample it, but this is probably the easiest way for you to interface with your fast5 files."
bioinformatics,fpfqmvd,t3_gd3bhe,1588579980.0,"If you don't need current data, basecall them to get fastq files and subsample that"
bioinformatics,fpekh5o,t3_gcvn0a,1588549289.0,"I'm a 4th year bioinformatics PhD student at UCSC. Our program tends to place more emphasis on programming than biology. We have a variety of labs that center around cancer research (Brooks, Stewart, Vaske), algorithm/tool development (Paten, Vollmers, Akeson, Pourmand), stem cells (Kim, Shariati, Forsberg), genomics/evolutionary genomics (Corbett-Detig, Green), and others. Outliers are DuBois (protein eng) and Lowe (tRNA bioinformatics). I'd say the Haussler lab (probably the lab most people want to join) is also an outlier. They've been working mostly on brain organoids, transposable elements, and some cancer related stuff.

As of right now, campus is a bit weird because before the lockdown we had some grad students striking for higher pay. I would not say that we get underpaid in bioinformatics, since you're guaranteed to at least have a TA ship during the year. The main concern would be the housing crisis, so it's tough to find good affordable housing. You can PM me if you have more specific questions."
GooglePixel,fp8amgz,t1_fp88ry8,1588387613.0,I updated to 225 right when I got them and it's still there for me
GooglePixel,fp78vqg,t1_fp74dzb,1588366160.0,Interesting. My first gen buds don't have any buzz but my second gen buds do
GooglePixel,fp6ioj8,t1_fp4pkp7,1588353008.0,I just got mine and I definitely do. It seems to be worse in the right than the left. It's pretty subtle and I can only hear it over my music at very low volumes. Not sure if this warrants an RMA
GooglePixel,fp6hyn5,t3_gbc0fw,1588352656.0,I just got mine and I noticed that if you pause something there's this faint static sound for a few seconds before it stops. Does this happen to you too?
UCSC,foxkgj7,t3_ga1vqi,1588146830.0,"As a PhD student, I can't believe they would let a PhD student teach a class in STEM"
sffpc,fotedhq,t1_fosl27w,1588051506.0,"I've had the same controller for a while for hollow knight speedrunning. A lot of people claim it's really good, but in my experience it's been really mediocre. The d-pad is okay at best (a lot of wobble that causes accidental diagonal inputs). The buttons started sticking after a few months as well. I checked to make sure that the domes weren't cracked or dirty, so I feel like their QC is kind of a crap shoot."
starterpacks,fop2uk0,t1_fom6z31,1587951856.0,"It has more content than most $60 games and it launched at $15, but can usually be found for less. As a product, it literally cannot be criticized. The amount of quality content you get on the dollar is unmatched by any other game."
sffpc,fojpkrb,t1_fojb7gs,1587826643.0,Pretty sure it won't close at all since there's a tap that's past the side of the case
miniaussie,fnt1vuc,t3_g3olx1,1587233022.0,At 8 weeks mine was 6 lbs. He's 23 lbs now (2 yrs) which is still pretty small. You probably have a toy aussie
HollowKnight,fnt00pf,t3_g3jq9g,1587232026.0,When you're 9m33s off of the speed completion achievement...
bioinformatics,fncp4z8,t1_fnccdcp,1586842781.0,"I think it depends on the company. I interviewed for an internship at 10x where in the email they said the phone interview was just to get to know me. It turned out to be an hour long technical interview that caught me completely off guard. Needless to say, I didn't get the interview.

I was asked one question about my work (which had everything to do with the internship) before I was bombarded with useless coding questions and brain teasers. A summary of topics: Bayesian statistics, molecular biology, C programming, python programming, relating probability distributions to useless math problems, chemistry, and the usual data structures interview questions."
