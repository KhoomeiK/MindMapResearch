berkeley,foou8qo,t1_fooc58k,1587946577.0,I am a TA and I start by assuming that a student I am helping knows everything and I wait for them to make a mistake before querying about more fundamental knowledge. I have found that to be the fastest way to get to know what they are really missing. But also different courses have different kinds of material so this might not always work (both courses I've taught are basically math classes but branded as EECS).
