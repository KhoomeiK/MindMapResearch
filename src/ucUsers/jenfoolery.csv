MergeDragons,fpaaenp,t3_gcb3zc,1588444078.0,It's the minotaur statue. Don't ever sweat your guys harvesting the one that's early on. There are two more further on and a giant statue almost at the end that will release several more minotaurs as it's being harvested. This seems to be how it always is.

Unless everyone agrees to not travel in or out of Kern county, it doesn't make sense to open up in such a patchwork way.

UCSD,fonsk5m,t3_g8fk1q,1587925629.0,I see a good number of folks carrying umbrellas against the sun - they make UV-specific ones that are extra-opaque. Bonus: they cover more area and do not lead to hat-head. Either option is better than having to have skin cancer cut off your head.
sandiego,fofvaqw,t3_g73kii,1587743446.0,I recall several years ago SDPD said they would put helicopter announcements on Twitter so folks who can hear that there IS an announcement but can't tell what it says would have somewhere to check.

sandiego,fnmbb7s,t3_g2mdi8,1587068350.0,There's a route 923 bus stop in OB at the end of Pt Loma Ave at Sunset Cliffs that has a reasonable view. You can always claim to be waiting for a bus. Downside is it will cost you $2.50 if they make you get on the bus. Upside is the bus only runs every 30 minutes.
