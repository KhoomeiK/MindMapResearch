Like the engine ran fine but after 20 or so minutes of actually driving, it would stall when idling. Resetting the ecu was a crapshoot: it might act as a temporary fix but it would just take longer to act up again. Later on, resetting the ecu just made things worse so that it would die at idle immediately after starting up while cold, rather than there being a grace period like ""normal.""

The rationale is bad coils wont function once they get to op temps

exchristian,fo5xaja,t3_g5v6zb,1587538752.0,"I understand how you feel. When I was on shakier ground, I went to asking what is morality, where does it come from, and who decides it. I think that's the beauty/crisis--it's a societal construct. On one hand it's adaptable and potentially helpful, but on the other it only possesses the meaning we give to it. To piggyback off another comment here, you should ask yourself ""what do I value?"" And if ""other people"" comes up as a personal value, ask ""what do others value?"" or ""what does everyone value?""

To speak more to the ontological perspective of morality: Generally, actions which promote community, cooperation, and overall societal wellbeing are favored whereas things that diminish harmony or harm other members are disfavored. What I feel about it is we're one big tribe and we share the same living space. Naturally, those who work together to survive fair better than those who are in it for themselves. Thus, ""good"" is what makes for a thriving society and ""evil"" is what detracts from it. Try to think of things you'd consider good/evil and compare them to how they benefit or harm society. I think you'll find that the obvious ones stick to one side or the other, the ambiguous ones (like the trolley problem) are just difficult to predict whether they help society or harm it, and the neither good nor evil actions just don't have anything meaningful to do with other people.

Another thing to note about morality is it requires agency--something we tend to consider only existing in humans. (This points to the idea that morality is really just a construct tied in with the concept of a human society.) I'll give an example. If a dog bites a person who did not disturb it, is that dog evil? Now, if a person punches someone who did not disturb them, is that person evil? (Let's say the bite was equally as painful as the punch.) You can also throw in a dog biting a dog and a person punching a dog. That's why disasters like Hurricane Katrina aren't evil yet nuclear bombings are.

That's just my 2 cents."

I reiterate:
DO. NOT. BUY. UNLESS. IT'S. TESTED.

I'll share my story, just to drive that home. I had been dreaming of owning an RX-8 since I was young enough to wet the bed. Finally, in 2018, I bought one. She was an '04 with only 54 thousand miles. So clean, it still had the new car smell. It was the most mint (cosmetically) RX-8 for sale I found. You can see my first post to look its condition for yourself. Though you would think, especially with what shape it looks to be in, what could go wrong with such a new vehicle?
Let me tell you what--only 5 thousand miles later and she sits in the garage now. Was hiding low compression numbers even though it sung on the test drive. Now, I'm gonna be out another 5 grand for the rebuild because I was like ""it has low miles, there's no need to test it."" Barely put 5k miles on it (literally has 60002 mi currently) and I'm already doubling my cost to own. Fyi, I paid $6300 for this fine example of an RX-8. At least she sits prettily
