ucr,fp8bz0u,t3_gbx0r4,1588388526.0,I am getting $800. Sooooo grateful for this. It'll help out a bunch.
ucr,fp101qy,t3_gajswk,1588220900.0,I think it's fine for those that want it as an option but I wouldn't want it to be for every class because I actually want my letter grades! Trying to boost my gpa this last quarter.
AnimalCrossing,fp0br0t,t3_gadrhg,1588206217.0,Love it! I'm gonna do this!
AnimalCrossing,fowwyfm,t3_g56kl8,1588128944.0,This is awesome! ‚ù£Ô∏è I'm gonna use some! So excited. Only ones missing for me and Nana and Samson!
berkeley,foheacq,t3_g7ghw3,1587764495.0,"Going to a community college is an excellent choice! I know a lot of people look down on them but you save sooooo much money by taking your general ed classes there. My brother went to CC first, joined their honors program and then applied to transfer! He recently got accepted to Berkeley and UCLA (among other awesome UCs as well!) If Berkeley really is your number one, I would suggest considering going to a CC. You'll save a lot of money and have another chance to get into your dream school! Ot course, other UCs are fantastic too. 

Best of luck!!!"
AnimalCrossing,fo8zgbp,t1_fo2f93j,1587607133.0,We got lucky!
ucr,fo50s0n,t1_fo4py09,1587515066.0,"Then don't go. This will be for students that truly want this. If students don't want to participate whenever it's postponed then that is fine too. I get it though. It won't be the same but I'm happy they haven't canceled it. A lot of us want this moment for our families. Even if half the class of 2020 went it's still something and still people that want to have that special moment with fellow classmates! Again, I know it sucks so much but I am not against the idea of having it later. People who can go and want to go will go and people who don't want to go won't. Simple as that."
AnimalCrossing,fnxckw9,t1_fnxbpnu,1587335909.0,"Hopefully you see him around soon! And I love that they're named after Australian cities. It's adorable! 

And awww I bet that looks amazing!!! My island is dull right now but I'm excited to start fixing it up! üíû"
AnimalCrossing,fnxbl4n,t1_fnxaf8p,1587335336.0,thank you! üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è and awww Rodney! Lol. At least he has grown on you a bit! Haha
AnimalCrossing,fnxbfqa,t1_fnxad7a,1587335252.0,Klause seems really cool! I like his design!! And awww love Zucker! I have him on my island too! I found him when I used a NMT! He's adorable! Sydney is cute too. I remember I had Melba in new leaf. She was so sweet.
ucr,fng9wef,t1_fng9n8p,1586926024.0,Damn. That sucks. He's usually really good in person. I know his exams are hard and all..but he was usually really good about never canceling class and holding office hours. It's not good that he isn't communicating though. He's making it more stressful for himself and students. Maybe you guys should let the chair know your concerns. :/
ucr,fng6ky5,t3_g1k1l4,1586923565.0,Oh damn. Hopefully he's okay.
AnimalCrossing,fmz6bnj,t3_fwitho,1586508113.0,Kyle is my birthday twin! üòÑ
AnimalCrossing,fmz5ta5,t3_fvr1sw,1586507532.0,He is my absolute favorite! Had him in new leaf and hoping to get him again!! üò≠
ucr,fmqd4d8,t1_fmp1807,1586297368.0,A lot of people would be willing to travel for a few days to attend their actual in person commencement and some people don't even live as far
ucr,fm9bt7z,t3_ftub1q,1585865563.0,Okay. This pretty much means the commencements will be cancelled too. I mean..I knew that was going to happen..but they still haven't told Seniors anything. Hopefully it's postponed and none of that online zoom graduation BS lol
