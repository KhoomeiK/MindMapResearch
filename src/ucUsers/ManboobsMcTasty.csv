SeattleWA,forpo7f,t1_fornzpy,1588016307.0,"I wonder which island it was. There are quite a few uninhabited San Juan islands where humans are prohibited 24/7/365 virus or no virus.

You can normally go ashore on Jones Island, but not right now. 

&#x200B;

The former is a wildlife habitat sanctuary; the latter is a state park."
