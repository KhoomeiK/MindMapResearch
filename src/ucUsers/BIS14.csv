ffxiv,fpmw5az,t3_gedum0,1588743339.0,"Disclaimer: i've only personally played Bard and Gunbreaker extensively, so I'm reporting most of these opinions secondhand.

Summoner is known for having a ""messy"" and tight optimal rotation, but is quite mobile for a caster, has high dps, and rez utility. 

Scholar has a lot of negativity surrounding it due to simplifications that longtime scholar players dislike. In a vacuum though, the healers are fairly well balanced. It's known for its powerful oGCD heals (as opposed to WHM's GCD heals) and shields, generally emphasising more pre-planning and fight knowledge than the other healers.

Red Mage is known for its relatively simple rotation, rez utility, and backflipping off the edges of arenas into the void. Most people seem to find it decently satisfying to play with some subtle optimizations you can incorporate.

Machinist has a fairly strict and set rotation. People don't seem to have hugely strong opinions about it, although many note it has sick animations.

Dancer is less strict than Machinist, but still not as reactive as Bard. There's a bit of dissatisfaction right now with ranged physical dps in general right now since they make up the bottom of the dps lists, but others argue they're fine since they make up for it with utility. Dancer is the epitome of this idea, with single-target buffing, group buffing, healing, and group damage reduction. It's also the most mobile of the already-mobile ranged physical dps, with a targetless dash skill you can charge up two uses of to use as a gap closer or to get out of AOEs.

Gunbreaker is quite well regarded. All the tanks are very well balanced right now, so what people like about gunbreaker is its very active dps-like rotation, pushing far more many buttons per minute than the other tanks. On the other hand, that means it can be a little overwhelming to pick up, esp since it starts at 60.

Samurai is pretty well regarded for having a satisfying rotations and the peak of melee dps damage (at the cost of absolutely no utility). 

Rogue/Ninja are also well regarded. They're most known for a burst window which requires many consecutive double weaves that can be overwhelming.

Monk has a lot of negativity around them, variously due to a lack of feeling of progress past lvl50, some awkward animations, many very situational skills, and generally just not feeling as polished to play as the other melee dps. They're known for a fast gcd-heavy rotation and lots of positionals."

berkeley,fpkp2h9,t1_fpj4udj,1588698569.0,"Yeah, tutoring's a great standby job while you look for something more steady and secure. Most people either sign on with a physical tutoring center (my friend works at one of those, although nowadays they have to do online sessions which has been tough), or use gig platforms like Wyzant. You could also try going it alone by advertising on craigslist and such, but that can be really tough while you're not established, especially in this environment."

ffxiv,fpi0i0h,t1_fphxufm,1588631263.0,"I'd love to, but I feel like they aren't quite as memeable. CT has this perfect balance of it being old unbalanced content no one *should* die to, but there being two dozen ways people find a way to die anyways. The other raids' deaths don't feel nearly as memeable because they're pretty understandable mistakes when they do happen."
ffxiv,fphv9xa,t1_fphnt2y,1588628449.0,"Splash to your heart's content friend. I didn't mean to make it out to be a bad thing, it was just too much of a meme not to include."
ffxiv,fphuyi3,t1_fphtpir,1588628280.0,That would be top middle. I wanted it to be a little more general than the case of a full wipe. Even though I once had a group managed to do the early pull into wipe *twice*.

ffxiv,fpfekgu,t1_fpfd2t3,1588568955.0,"It's very rough early on. I ended up relying mostly on farming MGP through other sources to buy cards from the vender in the Gold Saucer.

One of the nice packs that vender offers is the garlean pack, which ofc only contains garlean-tribe cards. That'll give you a deck that can stomp Ascension NPCs, which helped me bridge the gap to 60 cards.

Trials and alliance raid roulettes drop a variety of cards as well."
ffxiv,fpfdu2h,t1_fpfbqxt,1588568357.0,"There's no standard, but I encourage you to give commends to competent DPS (you can usually tell by if they're top of the aggro list and don't die to mechanics). DPS get commends much more rarely so you can brighten up someone's day!"
ffxiv,fpevk2s,t1_fpeg7bd,1588555873.0,I had a tank like that in Copperbell once. Turns out those early dungeons are so low on damage a bard can be the tank.
ffxiv,fpevcli,t1_fpegzcj,1588555743.0,"As has been said, always prioritize the dots.

For your bonus question, there's not a lot of easily-available theory on optimizing dungeon pulls because they're all so easy. What I tend to do is throw down 3 total dots regardless of the size of the pull for steady procs, leading with MB. I probably deviate from that quite a bit though because it simply doesn't matter that much."
ffxiv,fpdcsok,t1_fpdcfpo,1588524450.0,"It has to do with later events in the plot. Suffice to say, eventually ""warrior of light"" and ""warrior of darkness"" come to refer to you, the player character.

Usually in the community we just say ""WoL"" to refer to the player character."
ffxiv,fpce26i,t1_fpc4bj8,1588497052.0,"Other people have told you about how tank swaps are unnecessary for all but the hardcore endgame content.

ffxiv,fpccuff,t1_fpc9fa1,1588495755.0,"I don't know about the logistics of upgrading from the free trial, but I would recommend just diving in rather than putting around leveling everything to 35. The meat of the gameplay and story is all well past 50, so it'd be a shame if you put it off for the sake of grinding levels. This is all assuming you've enjoyed the game up to 35, ofc"
ffxiv,fpc3sg8,t1_fpc3k5o,1588486672.0,"Yup, classes start at all sorts of levels.
 
Astrologian (healer) and machinist (ranged physical dps) start at 30, and will be available when you enter the first expansion, Heavensward.

Red Mage (ranged magical dps) and Samurai (melee dps) start at 50. The only requirement is being level 50 in any combat class, and also owning the Stormblood expansion (don't have to actually get there, just have to own it).

Gunbreaker (tank) and dancer (ranged physical dps) start at 60, and again you only have to be level 60 yourself and own Shadowbringers to access them."
ffxiv,fpbz8ac,t1_fpbyjha,1588482715.0,"It's a marginal difference, but higher ilevel is almost always better due to the higher base damage; it's very hard for even 5 slots of materia substats to make up for that. The exceptions are when the higher ilevel is specced into truly terrible substats, like tenacity or excess piety. DPS shouldnt have to worry though; just go with highest ilevel."
ffxiv,fpbc691,t1_fpb2i5g,1588466682.0,"At that level I don't think there's much to worry about. Believe me, I felt the same way for a long time, always worrying about whether I wasn't doing a good enough job in group content or what game systems I wasn't ""properly"" exploring.

In hindsight, I didn't need to worry about any of that. Follow the main story quest, and if it feels slow then try out alt classes or grab some of those blue + mark quests to unlock new features. This is very much a game that allows you to discover and learn at any pace you like."

ffxiv,fp9whlj,t1_fp9skgw,1588436004.0,"Others have commented on your issues with race-class combinations, so I'll address dragoon vs. paladin.

Both of them are melee classes, but dragoon is a physical DPS and paladin is a tank. As a dragoon, you'll feel far more ""active"" in combat, strafing around the boss to get position-based bonus damage, pressing a lot of buttons to maximize damage output, and sometimes even jumping around all over place (attempting to) dodge boss attacks. On the downside, you'll have longer queues when attempting to complete story-required dungeons and trials (upwards of 15 minutes, compared to usually under a minute as tank). 

As a paladin, you'll be a tank, usually assuming a leadership role in group content as you set the pace of dungeon pulls and control the positioning of bosses. As a paladin specifically you'll have lots of support skills to protect and even heal your team (and as a bonus, your unique healing skill makes you unparalleled at solo'ing content later in the game). You have a little less ability to actively mitigate damage targeted at yourself than the other tanks, but that's somewhat made up for by your shield, which provides a passive chance to block damage. On the downside combat itself (i.e. your dps rotation) will be a little less involved, to make up for the other things you have to pay attention to (boss positioning, adds, mitigation cooldowns, etc)."

ffxiv,fn5h933,t3_fzoupi,1586664816.0,I'd rate the ARR experience at around 6/10. HW and ShB were both somewhere between 9/10 and 10/10 for me. It's worth it.

I agree with the general point that it's probably not optimal game design, but I don't really play Trails for the gameplay anyways so it never bothered me much."

It's like having a tailored suit. If you have a certain kind of body shape, then your choices in customization may be more limited. Likewise, if you're naturally talented with arts like Olivier or Khloe, orbment engineers may be able to tune your orbment in a way that lets you maximize your potential (as represented by single-line orbments)."
