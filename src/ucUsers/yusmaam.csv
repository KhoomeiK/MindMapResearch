UCSC,fpmsxsx,t3_ge9hdg,1588740874.0,"I'm graduating and I never saw a single hard drug during my time here. You'll gravitate to people who don't party, and can choose where to be. I've never felt pressured into doing something I didn't want to do when others have been drinking or smoking weed."
UCSC,fpmshbe,t3_gebae8,1588740528.0,"I didn't like the class or the professor when I took it last year, but that's just my personal opinion. I know plenty of people who enjoyed the class and I got an A, so I would say give it a shot."
UCSC,fpml0nh,t1_fphq1dw,1588735419.0,"I honestly don't know how to link Facebook posts but it's on the official group of ucsc students page, and it's under the announcements section. It's the first thing that pops up whenever I open the Facebook page. The president's name is Davon Thomas, if you want to search for their name on the page."

UCSC,fpec2ij,t1_fpeao61,1588544546.0,"Priority will be given to students who are still on campus, worked on campus when things were shut down, and take out a large number of loans."
UCSC,fpebxn5,t1_fpebljc,1588544466.0,Just checked the post and there's an update. The money will be distributed as early as this week and at the latest week 7. Not every student will recieve money.
UCSC,fpebljc,t3_gcyog1,1588544266.0,"I think the SUA president posted something on the UCSC FB page that said we would be getting up to $1500 depending on various factors, and that money was supposed to be distributed on May 1st..."
UCSC,fp2sxsg,t3_gafwdm,1588267360.0,"I was a philosophy major in Cowell. It doesn't really matter where you live, only a handful of my phil classes were actually in Cowell my first 2 years on campus. Once you start getting into upper divs there will be more classes in Cowell."
UCSC,forvvfk,t1_forjdsj,1588019420.0,I've heard that work study students don't qualify for unemployment. But dining did just finally reward students covid pay.
UCSC,foma01f,t3_g88orq,1587882815.0,"""Take a leave of absence"" Okay great thanks that's so helpful. I'm graduating this quarter, but yeah I'll stretch it out another year, try to find housing for one quarter, and waste more time and money in Santa Cruz. I hate how everyone thinks it's so easy to take a LOA and if we aren't taking one then we aren't allowed to be unhappy with the situation or demand a partial refund from the school."
UCSC,fodfdg9,t1_fodf0kk,1587683992.0,"Exactly. Like someone else commented, have to keep myself awake somehow!"
UCSC,fod09s2,t3_g6tcnh,1587678231.0,"I'm the drinker. I switch between coffee, water, and a smoothie in my morning classes."
UCSC,fobty7y,t1_fob853b,1587663629.0,I loved Cowell's location but I made no friends there because almost everyone is an asshole. After 3 years I moved to crown and Merrill and finally found awesome housemates and friends.
UCSC,fo6wtu5,t3_g5vp04,1587568205.0,My first party on campus was at an RA's apartment
UCSC,fo6wq5j,t1_fo66ke3,1587568151.0,This was my experience as well
UCSC,fny6ry0,t3_g4lmj0,1587354806.0,"Hi there! Google UCSC ER System. You'll click on work study and apply from there. Dining also sends out an email every summer, I highly recommend applying for the coffee shops through the dining email. Good luck!"
UCSC,fnekijl,t3_g18qg8,1586891001.0,"Santa Cruz is a boring city, so if you're looking for a California experience I don't recommend coming here. I chose to do a quarter in Portland OR because I really loved the city and wanted to actually experience something fun and new."
UCSC,fnbff4w,t3_g0s666,1586814577.0,I have 4 classes that are back to back on Tuesdays and Thursdays and I have to attend lecture for all of them. I usually like back to back classes so I can stay on campus all day but now I'm just sitting at home and it's so boring. I keep falling asleep in the 3rd and 4th class of the day...
UCSC,fnardk6,t1_fnammnu,1586802475.0,You're right. Email your housing office to make sure this is up to date.
UCSC,fna4qng,t3_g0k446,1586790996.0,"My RA chose our entire apartment. Me and 6 others, but that was 2 years ago so it could have changed."
UCSC,fn7ll1t,t3_fzzu5k,1586722763.0,Dining sucks. They refuse to pay us Administrative Leave for no apparent reason and are skirting around the truth when employees ask any questions.
UCSC,fn569az,t3_fzmrl4,1586656930.0,"Hi! I'm a philosophy major graduating this quarter and I think the department is great. We have some great professors and it's very easy to get the classes you want. Class sizes are very small, and the advisors within the department are great! Feel free to PM me if you have any questions!"
UCSC,fn3p29t,t3_fyyy73,1586625133.0,"Yeah, you'll fit in Cowell or Stevenson. I was in Cowell and I really enjoyed the location."
UCSC,fn18td6,t1_fn0lqre,1586557078.0,I gotchu
UCSC,fmyxxwq,t1_fmyx2sg,1586499295.0,I just sent you a PM
UCSC,fmyx2sg,t3_fy7i6b,1586498470.0,Let me look. I lived in an 8 person apartment in Cowell last year.
UCSC,fmxflog,t3_fxp4cw,1586464075.0,"Yep, I work at a coffee shop under dining and I'm getting the same BS. It's so frustrating."
UCSC,fmsx1qc,t1_fmrr50x,1586363335.0,Exactly. Why not try? Just don't get your hopes up considering the current state of things.
UCSC,fmnz23p,t3_fwdnwe,1586239653.0,"Thank you. I like hearing 2008 stories, it makes me feel like the world isn't going to end."
UCSC,fmnyven,t3_fwds08,1586239480.0,"I like the vibe here. Nobody is judgy, unless you're on Reddit. The dating scene has been favorable for me personally. I met my partner on tinder here and we are going 2 years strong. I am not a digital media major, but have taken 4 film and digital media classes and I've enjoyed them all. I wouldn't call drinking and smoking weird, it's the norm here."
UCSC,fmn1yd1,t3_fw8l51,1586216511.0,"I lived in the cowell apartments last year. They have dining table, couch, fridge. All that. If you have an apartment with a lot of people (mine was 8 total) I would recommend bringing a mini fridge. Even with my 4 person apartment this year, it gets tight. You'll need microwave, toaster, pots, pans, all of that. If you have any specific questions feel free to shoot me a private message."
UCSC,fmk0vm9,t3_fvoyc7,1586141890.0,"I lived in Cowell for 2 years and Merrill for 1. The dorms in Cowell are decent, and I loved being close to the gym, my work (cowell coffee shop), the library, and the quarry. It's more of a frat sorority vibe (even though Greek life is almost non-existent at UCSC), so I recommend Cowell or Stevenson if you're an extrovert. I love the people in merrill, and the apartments are really nice. I've heard the dorms are garbage though. If you're going to live in crown or Merrill, be ready to hike uphill to get home. They don't call us UC Sexy Calves for nothing."
