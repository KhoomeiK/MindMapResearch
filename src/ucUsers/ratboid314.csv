A lot of complaints are about things the individual was responsible for (e.g. complaining about the no late policy after submitting something late), and many contain statements that demonstrate a lack of understanding of pedagogy (e.g. reviews that contain ""They give too much/hard homework"" and also ""I learned a lot"" as unrelated things, like no shit you learn best by doing hard things).

Catholicism,fpkr0dz,t1_fpkfsgd,1588699527.0,"> Peterson just blames people for their own problems

He has been a clinical psychologist as well as an academic for most of his career. His duty in the former role is to help people overcome their psychological difficulties, which generally requires that people take responsibility for implementing the solution to their problems. It might not be their fault for becoming a victim, but if people want to get better, they have to put in the work. Using an analogy of physical health, if I broke my leg, if I want to walk, run or dance again, I would need to do whatever physical therapy is necessary.

When Peterson is speaking in public or in his papers, he is grounded in clinical and academic experience, which can often seem harsh or impersonal. I can almost guarantee you that Peterson does not see most of his patients once, and then sends them on their way to fix their problems. He most likely sees people for an extended time span as they progress through the therapy."

The renunciation and death found in the religious life is suffering. Consolations such as these explanations make it easier to bear that cross. Since celibacy is probably the most popular hang-up that people have about the religious life, consolations of that form become a popular tool to make that cross easier to bear. If you consider the other common vows taken on by the religious of poverty and obedience, similar consolations exist. 

Can it lead to some repression? Sure. But the process to enter a seminary or order these days are geared to filter out those who aren't suited for that life, or flag those who might have issues. Psychological and mental evaluations, long applications, interviews with the applicant (and others)."
DebateAChristian,fp6k9zx,t1_fp633ix,1588353789.0,"Some rules certainly are done away with in maturity. As a child, your parents picked out which clothes you wore, what foods you ate, had you do certain things at certain times, and punishments for failing to disobey these things (sound familiar?). As an adult, you have a choice of clothing, food, schedule, and disciplines for breaking your standards, but if you do things to dishonor your parents, you might not be welcomed back into their home. Reasonable parents won't care what you're wearing as long as it's not obscene, what food you eat as long as it's healthy, what schedule you follow as long as you give them some time.

The Mosaic Law was that reminder for the moral law that you speak of, it set the Jewish people apart from the other nations, reminding all that they were firstborn God's children. Like children, they never went out to the nations, they stayed in God's home for them, and thus followed the rules of the house. Christians are sent out from the home, still expected.

Is understanding human parentage a perfect correspondence with divine parentage? No, there are differences (a lot of which can be chalked up to our sin), but if a Christian believes that God is their Father (which should be all of them), then to understand the rules as part of a parental relationship is reasonable. 

The Bible is split into the Old and New Testaments. The etymology of the word testament goes back to words meaning ""covenant"" and ""will"". One can see the Bible as the Old Will and New Will. God's will for an individual is going to be different for each individual, and part of Christianity is the discernment of God's will for themselves. During much of the New Will, especially the Council of Jerusalem in Acts, the Early Church discerned that the Mosaic Law did not need to be maintained by the Church to live God's will."
DebateAChristian,fp61ze8,t1_fp5s4n6,1588344551.0,"Scripture as a whole is a story about God's relationship with man. The laws contained are given as part of that relationship, like how parents give rules to their children. If the rules are followed, it's all good, if they are broken, there are consequences/punishments.

As you grow older and your relationship with your parents matures, your parents (probably) lifted some of the rules imposed on you (later curfews, choices in activity, clothing and food). When you came of age, your parents had only a small set of rules they needed to impose on you. The same thing happened with God, where the ""coming of age"" happened in the sacrifice of Jesus. There are still rules that we must follow to remain on good terms with our parents (physical and divine), but many of the rules we grew up with are gone.

It's called the Old Testament because it is old, out if date. It is included in the Bible to point to the New Testament."

The ten commandments, even if we aren't strictly bound to it in the form given to Moses, are used as a starting point to understand the moral law. The purpose of joining The Church is to provide a means to understand the law, and to distribute the grace necessary to fufill the new law.

I have included an article that summarizes and further explains why we aren't under the Mosaic law, with those citations (and if you go far enough, all of the citations should lead to scripture).

Then with some prelabeled footage, you could *probably* train a neural network to identify what route a receiver is trying to run, or what the coverage is. You could also probably ID presnap formations like this. You would probably need some people with experience in AI here.
