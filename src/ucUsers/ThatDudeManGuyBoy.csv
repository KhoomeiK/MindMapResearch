EngineeringStudents,foq6yj3,t3_g8agdt,1587985204.0,"I go to UCSD for EE. I feel like UCSD, CalPoly Slo, and UCLA have similar prestige in engineering where you can't really go wrong with any of them. It'll most likely just come down to where you want to live haha. UCSD does have a reputation for being socially dead, but thats only if you sit around expecting people to approach you. It definitely is possible to make friends, but you will be very busy. Generally though, the program is very rigorous, and same can be said for the other schools. You are correct about it being very theoretical; however, the professors I've had here so far are great. Regardless, congratulations and good luck!"
leagueoflegends,fohp0zv,t3_g7d7uc,1587769860.0,I don't see anything wrong with what [u.gg](https://u.gg) did. Riot August is just a fucking idiot who doesn't know how to represent riot professionally.

EngineeringStudents,fn669k9,t3_fyllhh,1586689083.0,Its good to have both hardware and software knowledge. You know enough software experience from your internship and school to work as a software engineer. Having hardware experience leaves you with more options in the future. Your degree is great.
