UCSantaBarbara,fovyak1,t1_fovx4y2,1588109656.0,"I'll second the note about SLO's biggest strength. I have a lot of SLO friends (across all different majors), and they've told me rave reviews of their curriculum and how it embodies the motto of ""Learn By Doing."" I feel like I was always watching my SLO friends do really, really cool things as a part of their education -- pioneering mini-startups, doing product design/marketing for goods that they made themselves, etc... and a ton of them have great jobs in the Bay Area now. My impression of SLO kids is that they emerge with a degree *and* a huge list of things that they've actually done and can brag about to any potential employer. At the risk of making a huge over-generalization, I think they're more prepared for the workforce than your average UCSB graduate. Or at least, those SLO kids were more prepared than I was after I graduated from UCSB a few years ago lol.

I'm also a scarred veteran of the Econ & Accounting major -- I got into the major but dropped out during my junior year because it just wasn't for me. I agree with some other commenters that it really is math-heavy, for better or for worse. And if things are the same as when I was in school a few years ago, it's fertile Big 4 recruiting ground, if that's your goal. I eventually ended up switching to the humanities/social sciences and I'm planning on starting grad school in the fall. My grad program will definitely have some econ components in it but not necessarily finance/accounting. (Feel free to PM me anyways though!)

Ninja edit: OP, if you know that you want to do accounting/finance... one of my big complaints with Econ & Accounting is that the Econ didn't feel very useful if you knew that you'd rather be doing accounting specifically."

Especially assuming that you weren't able to visit either campus. 

I'll try and help anyways. *In my experience*, these things come off the top of my head (I graduated less than 5 years ago in a pre-pandemic world): 

Pros:

* My humanities/social sciences professors were brilliant, always available, and very willing to support/advocate for me. I built some great relationships with many professors just simply by going to office hours. I'm in the process of choosing a grad school right now, and I owe a lot to two professors who wrote me letters of rec and were always willing to lend a listening ear as I talked with them about grad school. I was an Econ & Accounting major for a while and have a less positive impression of the faculty there, but I may be biased because it's just generally a really competitive and not-super-fun major. (In my opinion/experience.)
* It's a beautiful area. I definitely had tons of ""wow, I go to school here"" moments while watching the sunset. And I somehow still felt like I took it for granted by the end of senior year. 
* Isla Vista is an incredibly fun and unique area to spend ~3 years of undergrad, and I say that as someone who doesn't really enjoy drinking/partying in the most conventional sense. I loved having all of my friends skateboarding distance away, and even dumb stuff like just popping over to a friend's apartment to play Smash or watch trash TV was really fun and felt very classically *college-y*. 

(Potential) Con:

* In general, the SB area is pretty small and you might feel like you've run out of recreational things to do by junior/senior year, whether or not that's actually true. And if you stick around SB after you graduate, it definitely does have a bit of a small-town feel, especially if you're coming from a comparatively large city. Like, you'll run into people you know at Trader Joe's. Up to you if that's a good or bad thing. The small-town feel extends to the job market too, so your desired industry may or may not be in the area. 

This is all I can come up with right now without any further context, so... if there's a specific area you want more details in, or if you're willing to provide more details about your situation, that would help me (or anyone else) give a more-informed take."
