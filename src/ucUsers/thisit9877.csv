ucla,fp01z8w,t1_fozxg7a,1588200978.0,"Yeah, I would not want to go through all that trouble of proving my innocence just because somebody else decides to cheat. Itâ€™s just unnecessary stress especially during these times. I think itâ€™d be helpful if TAs or professors were also in the group chat so that they can look through the chat history and know for sure who were involved in exam collaboration/ cheating rather than blame everyone that was in the group chat."

ucla,foytfoo,t3_ga2jlo,1588178846.0,"Ever since this quarter started, Iâ€™ve learned to stop joining groupmes. Although theyâ€™re a good source of learning and collaboration in the class, thereâ€™s always a possibility of having that one person ruin it for all the other students. For me, I feel like joining groupmes during a point of time when exams are online are especially risky and not worth the possibility of academic dishonesty being stuck on your record."

ucla,foia6oo,t3_g7kymy,1587781990.0,"Donâ€™t make the same mistake I did. Last year, I was signing up for summer classes thinking that I would actually take them. After getting into a summer internship, I dropped all my summer classes, but then they charged me a $150 dollar fee for dropping all my summer classes. So Iâ€™d suggest just planning out your summer classes on the class planner first and wait until youâ€™re certain that your summer research is cancelled before enrolling

EDIT: JK they waived summer fees this year."
ucla,foi04na,t3_g7jp6k,1587776023.0,"I agree 100% with you. Although that hasn't happened to me so far, I feel like with classes and exams being online, I feel way more susceptible to the possibility of being screwed over by other students who may have the urge to cheat by doing stuff like posting exams on Chegg or making a group chat with other students in class asking for help during a midterm (which can put innocent students in big trouble). As selfish as this sounds, I just want online schooling to be over with already and end the unnecessary stress."
ucla,fohxlmi,t1_fohq905,1587774611.0,"I personally really like Bruin Shelter because you get to interact very closely with the residents. It's very personal since you're practically living with them for a day. With each shift, you get the chance to get to know the residents pretty well. As for getting to know your staff members, usually you don't really get to know your co-staff members on a personal level since you usually work with different staff each shift. Normally, there'd be socials and retreats that you can go in order to get to know the staff members a little better, but they've all been cancelled due to corona virus this quarter, so I can't really tell you how they are. You should definitely apply! It's a good experience overall!"
ucla,fohx2zo,t1_fohqbec,1587774322.0,"The time commitment is 1 overnight shift per two weeks, so each quarter, you're expected to do 5-6 overnight shifts at the shelter. For the shift themselves, you usually take the bus or uber with two other bruin shelter staff to the off campus shelter at 7 PM (bus = 1 hour commute, uber = 15-20 minutes commute), where you make food for the residents, make sure all the entrances are locked, and do all the other necessary things before you are free to do whatever. You could study after everything is done, but usually, people just sleep right after doing everything (which is usually around 10:30 - 11:30 pm). You have to leave the shelter at 7AM (8 AM on weekends), so you don't get to sleep in if your classes occur later in the day. If you need to change shift times, the directors are very flexible with you changing your shifts just so long as you notify them at least a couple days in advance. Personally, I think the time commitment wasn't too bad unless the shifts were on week 10 or finals week.

EDIT: There's also biweekly meetings as well, but they last for an hour usually, so it doesn't take up that much time."

ucla,fo5hlyx,t1_fo5gjgy,1587525841.0,Alright. Good luck on making your decision! I hoped I helped you out a little bit :)
ucla,fo5g1t2,t1_fo5edd8,1587524772.0,"Are you by any chance pre-med? 

If you are pre-med, Iâ€™d say that thereâ€™s no rush then to transfer schools if you really donâ€™t want to go to UCI that much. Getting that research experience would most likely help tremendously for both transfer apps and med school. You can also use that extra year to get more good grades in your classes as well imo.

If not, then Iâ€™d still say thereâ€™s no rush if youâ€™re still able to find opportunities like research. In CC, i felt that I wasnâ€™t really exposed to much opportunities for research or anything like that (although that may be on me). But if you have chances to do research at CC, then I would lean more towards staying another year. Of course, consult more people about it before making your decision, but thatâ€™s what I would lean towards. 

And yeah, if you feel that UCLA is really a good fit for you (like much more than UCI), then by all means go for it. A year isnâ€™t really that long of a time anyways"
ucla,fo5cpux,t1_fo54yz8,1587522534.0,"Okay that clears things up a bit. I assume you know that it all comes down to what you value, so I can tell you more about what my thoughts are as a transfer student. I feel like if I were in that same position as you, I would definitely have regrets about not taking my chances to apply to UCLA, especially since it was my dream school since HS freshmen year. 

After rethinking my answer, if I was in CC and was faced with that same situation, I would have very likely stayed another year to work on my pre-reqs because I know that even if the more logical choice would be to go to UCI and not waste a year, I would have that constant gnawing feeling of regret knowing that I never known if UCLA would have accepted me or not. I feel like that that feeling would probably bother me for a long time, even if itâ€™s a little ridiculous, because of how much I liked this school. 

So yeah, definitely depends on how much you really like the school and its environment. If you really feel that UCI ainâ€™t really it and that UCLA is worth staying an extra year at CC, go for it.

Personally, as a UCLA transfer student, I stopped thinking about the prestige of the school after a couple weeks into my first quarter lol. However, I really loved the livelihood of the campus and the west LA area as well as the passion that (most) students have for their orgs on campus. The school spirit is really refreshing. I feel like a lot of students (including me) feel proud knowing that they are students here sometimes. One thing about competitiveness though is that it gets really jarring sometimes (like competing for entry for clubs, but idk if this is specific to UCLA or not), but thatâ€™s just my own opinion."
ucla,fo53k1c,t3_g5rbao,1587516746.0,"Are you currently a CC student? Did you submit your uc transfer app to UCLA last year when apps were open? 

Assuming that youâ€™re a CC student set to transfer to UCI next school year that didnâ€™t apply to UCLA, Iâ€™d just commit to UCI since I feel like I wouldnâ€™t spend another year at CC just to redo my uc transfer app and get the chance to get accepted into UCLA. I feel like I would have wasted an extra year at CC instead of just starting on working towards my bachelors and career at UCI. I feel like UCLA and UCI would give a similar college experience in that you would get chances to socialize, make friends, have opportunities for your career. I heard that UCI is more of a commuter school, but Iâ€™m not a UCI student, so I canâ€™t comment on that. If you have more questions or concerns, feel free to keep asking!"

Now, in my last years of college, it seems like a long journey to try to get into medical school, but even if it feels like forever to reach that next stage of my life, it's crazy how fast all my life stages are going. It makes me wonder how fast these next 10 years will feel considering I already went through 2 decades of my life already."

ucla,fnikbo9,t3_g1xqfx,1586981483.0,"Itâ€™s really sad to see all of USAC attack Orion for having a difference of opinion. Instead of having a healthy discussion on why Orion (and a lot of other students) holds the belief that fees shouldnâ€™t be raised as well as being open to other ideas, they instead find every possible reason to attack him and finding the most unrelated way to put him down because he holds a different view than the majority of USAC. If the people on USAC actually become US politicians, I see a pretty bleak future ahead of us."
