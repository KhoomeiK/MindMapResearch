ComputerEngineering,fpmqjmx,t1_fpmpnjh,1588739126.0,"You'll definitely run into some Windows only software, especially on the EE side of things (PSPICE, ModelSim, etc.). However, it is also important to get used to Linux and working with bash. I used to run Ubuntu primarily and dual boot into Windows when I needed. That ended up being more trouble than it was worth and I'm now running Windows full time and just using tools like the Git Bash shell and Docker to give me a Linux-like environment when I need it. A Mac can work fine too, especially if you dual boot Windows.

The most important thing is to play around and try out a lot of different software. Who knows what you'll end up using in your career, so I think it's best to be familiar with a wide variety of tools instead of mastering a few."
ComputerEngineering,fpc1dt8,t1_fpbzcov,1588484540.0,"That's because it's not really a field, but rather a loose collection of fields. Most CompE programs will have a heavy focus on practical programming skills and the majority of graduates go into some sort of software career. A minority ending up focusing more on hardware and are essentially competing with EEs for jobs (minus power or construction stuff). 

The point of the degree is mostly about gaining a broad understanding of how computers work from high level programming languages down to the operating system, CPU architecture, digital circuits, etc. Then you take this broad overview and applying to a specific field and learn most of the details of your field on the job."
beer,fp6gq89,t1_fp5vyxd,1588352052.0,"I don't think there as many hurdles as you say there are. The majority of breweries in San Diego are open for to-go beer (growlers, crowlers, and cans if they have them). Many are doing steep discounts. Green Flash, and I'm sure others, are doing growler fills for 1 cent to healthcare workers."
UCSD,fp2ekmi,t3_gaf5az,1588260401.0,"You mostly just have to keep going. I applied for hundreds of jobs, had at least a dozen phone interviews and a half dozen in person interviews (would be online now). If you have run out of places to apply to then consider expanding your search to different industries.

Also, even though we aren't on campus, try to take advantage of the career services. Get your resume looked at and I know they've been doing online seminars and events. I know it sucks, but your job search should probably feel like another class, something you have to dedicate a few hours a week to. Good luck."
SoftwareEngineering,fp2a6ok,t3_gaqb77,1588258143.0,"You could also look into the defense industry. There are lots of jobs related to software and making things fly. For example, I'm about to graduate with a BS in CompE and will be a software engineer working on drones (mostly embedded C). It really depends where you live though, as there are definitely clusters for different industries."
UCSD,foxdsxz,t3_g9fjfq,1588140972.0,"It would be really nice if they would just say something. Like, we know a huge ceremony is not happening in 6 weeks. Some communication and action for the near term future would be nice."
ComputerEngineering,foor9z6,t3_g89lw5,1587944781.0,"Depends. I viewed my CompE degree as a broad introduction to many topics. I definitely took classes related to data analysis and it can be interesting.  It's great if you're the curious type, you'll naturally be able to pick up what you need on the job."
UCSD,fo99rsz,t1_fo8dzpa,1587613897.0,"Nope, but a competitor and I did interview with them too."
UCSD,fo7ex5u,t1_fo5oe7a,1587577174.0,"I would focus on large, well established companies. I'm going into the defense industry and most of the places I've been looking at are continuing their recruitment plans online, presumably their long term contracts haven't changed.

I also had to fill out hundreds of applications and probably a half dozen interviews in total. Don't worry if you don't feel super qualified or don't check every box, err on the side of applying anyway. Take a look at a list of the largest companies in SD and see if any of them have positions related to your field. A lot of the time opportunities come from unexpected places, good luck."
UCSD,fo55wzr,t1_fo53j1y,1587518203.0,"Right here in SD. It's actually a 15 min commute for me, so I'm very happy with the opportunity."
UCSD,fo4tsny,t3_g5ljd3,1587511061.0,"I got a good job offer at large defense contractor as a software engineer at the beginning of March. Looking back, it was great timing. Everything is still good with the job, I have my start date in June. Nothing too exciting, but it's a big relief to be financially stable right now."
EngineeringStudents,fnq0i5h,t3_g35bv4,1587155370.0,"I'm in a similar situation. Graduating in June and accepted an offer with a large defense contractor right before all this happened. Every indication is that the job is still waiting for me (received forms to bring on my first day a week ago). 

Keep in mind that the current unemployment numbers are heavily concentrated in certain industries. Things haven't changed too much in a lot of engineering related industries (people are working from home, but giant multi-year contracts aren't likely to be canceled)."
UCSD,fnhv8jd,t3_g11ojp,1586969420.0,"You can live outside La Jolla and still take the bus. I live east of Mira Mesa by Miramar College and take the 237 from the transit center there. Total time on the bus is about 45 min and it's about an hour from my front door to walking into class.

Many people think that an hour commute is terrible and they would rather drive. However, it would still take me 30 min to drive and then I'd have to find parking and likely walk pretty far. So the total time is actually similar. Plus you can relax on the bus and you are saving money (the wear on your car costs much more than most people think).

The trick is to look for neighborhoods with good bus routes to campus. The 237 is a good example. It goes down Mira Mesa Blvd and make limited stops, essentially express service to campus."
todayilearned,fngct2q,t1_fng5z6w,1586928364.0,"I was on a submarine and for the vast majority of things the attitude was just get it done. We did all sorts of painting underway without PPE that I'm sure was not in accordance with regulations. Of course things like tag outs, subsafe, and anything nuclear it was very by the book. But there's a big difference between official policy and reality for many things."
todayilearned,fnf1dtx,t3_g1ddo8,1586899627.0,"Ah, the FLIP. I've seen it docked down by the submarine base many times here in San Diego. Wish I had a chance to get a tour."
ComputerEngineering,fnecc4a,t3_g0vtxa,1586886822.0,"Regarding university name/ranking, it can certainly be helpful getting your first job. I'm about to graduate from UCSD and just got a software engineering position with a large defense contractor. They were eager to get me to interview and I got an offer after the first round (I didn't even talk to a manager, which I thought was odd). It's hard to say how much of it was my background (I'm a veteran), how much was my interviewing skills, and how much was my university and GPA. However, I do feel like there are a lot of UCSD alumni working in San Diego and the reputation of the school gives you an advantage."
ComputerEngineering,fnebdr6,t1_fncynu9,1586886342.0,"I view my degree as a way to get a taste of all the areas that I could potentially go into with my career. Take a wide variety of classes and figure out where your interests lie. Industry is going to be much more specialized than school. You wont be working as a ""computer engineer"" and so you should have a good idea of what kind of job you want by the time you are finishing your degree. So it's not really possible for school to cover any area in detail, and like you said it's more about learning how to learn.

That said, some things are super relevant to a large range of jobs. If you want a software job you obviously need to be familiar with the most important CS concepts and have a good grasp of a few programming languages. If want to work in hardware design you should be familiar with a HDL, etc."
ComputerEngineering,fn7b6di,t3_fyshw0,1586716874.0,"I transferred from CC and was required to take calc 3, diff eq, and linear algebra before I could even apply to CompE programs."
ComputerEngineering,fn7ay7d,t3_g00cuo,1586716743.0,"I'm about to graduate in CompE. I've only used a soldering iron or breadboards during a couple project classes where we built a prototype of our design. The vast majority of CompE is just programming and math. I've taken a VLSI design class where you learn about how chips are laid out all the way down to the transistor level, but that is all done with software tools.

Plenty of engineers do some tinkering and soldering for a hobby, but it's rarely part of the job."
personalfinance,fmwrijh,t1_fmwqmsm,1586451748.0,"Maybe some people didn't think there would be another pandemic, but anybody remotely well read in the science of infectious disease knows that pandemics are inevitable and it's just a matter of when.

It's quite different for FDIC insured deposits. Sure, you could dream up a scenario where the entire federal government collapses and then you'll lose your insured deposit. However, in such a scenario cash would also be worthless and you'd have much bigger things to worry about than a bank run."
UCSD,fmuf4yi,t3_fx9i7l,1586390181.0,"Seems like my profs are going easy on us this quarter, I've only had a couple HW assignments so far and have a lot more free time. So far my last quarter is looking like it will be one of my easiest."
UCSD,fmlkt1a,t3_fumurw,1586188359.0,"Thankfully, graduating and starting the job I got just before the shit hit the fan. They are a large defense contractor, so I'm not too worried about my job security."
UCSD,fmlk9uq,t3_fv1x0e,1586188070.0,"Everything is on Canvas, so you'll have to wait for the system to update and give you access."
ComputerEngineering,fm88g2m,t3_ftbjlk,1585844748.0,"You can look at the rankings to get a general sense of what the best schools are. My opinion is that the knowledge you get out of school is mostly affected by what you put in, but the reputation and ranking of a school will help get your foot in the door for internships/jobs.

I would look at how the degree is structured and if that aligns with your interests. Since you don't know what you want to focus on, look for a program that has a broad range of required courses and then lots of flexibility for electives. This is probably how most CE programs are structured, since it is a very broad topic.

Personally, I'm about to graduate from UCSD in CE and was a transfer student (older student, veteran). I was already living in SD and wanted to stay, so it was an easy choice for me. Our program is a mix of courses from EE and CS departments, with the core theory and programming classes required and then 7 electives that can be any upper div CS or EE class. It can feel a bit disjointed jumping between EE and CS classes, but I like the flexibility with the electives. My first year I got a taste of everything and found out what I liked and didn't like, and then my second year I was able to further refine my focus and sort of build my own degree. The required classes are more CS heavy, with a big focus on programming skills, but I do know people who focus on the EE side and are going into careers in hardware.

As far as internships and jobs, the reputation of the school will determine the level of recruiting on campus and get people to look at your resume, but you can't rely on it. We have giant career fairs and they are nice for getting to know companies and surveying what is out there. However, the most important things have nothing to do with the school. It's mostly about consistently applying to a lot of places and your soft skills when it comes to interviews. Our career center offers lots of workshops and support, but there is only so much they can help. I didn't have trouble finding an internship and already have a job starting in June, but I probably filled out hundreds of applications before I got it."
