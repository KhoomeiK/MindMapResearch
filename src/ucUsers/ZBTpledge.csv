ucla,fn1srhb,t1_fn1qs6u,1586569248.0,Def not fake dude. I actually have more screenshots of them freaking out about it on their GCs. But my friend told me to chill out with posting anything else..
ucla,fn0buho,t1_fmzckik,1586539080.0,"It's not going to put our accounts in the red itself. But, like another poster mentioned, it's certainly going to contribute piecemeal to an already super high cost of attendance, which has been skyrocketing for decades, all while wages remain stagnant. 

I simply don't want to pay more. $45 per year in extra fees is something I do not want to pay and would contribute to a burden. It's already hard enough to afford college as it is without needing to be subjected to higher fees every year.

I could buy like a month's worth of chicken breast from Ralph's for that much and freeze it, especially when they do a sale. So no, I cannot afford it."
