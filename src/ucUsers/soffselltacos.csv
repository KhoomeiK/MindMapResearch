BadMUAs,fomm7e3,t3_g89hld,1587895348.0, I am admittedly loving the brows on the top left
TheNational,fo4npcl,t3_g5baxx,1587507749.0,This brought me a lot of joy thank u
TheNational,fnyp1yj,t1_fnxyu8m,1587370365.0,"Oh my gosh, PLEASE be this"
aclfestival,fnak5zz,t3_g0jbhy,1586798910.0,I haven‚Äôt seen anyone dress like this at a festival since like 2011 lol
UCI,fn6z088,t1_fn6xj8t,1586710106.0,"I‚Äôm not saying he should‚Äôve stolen... When did I say that? I was responding to the notion that he deserves to die of starvation, which I argue that nobody does. There should be zero for starvation or desperate thievery in a place so rich in resources, that‚Äôs my point."
UCI,fn5kou9,t1_fn54s7w,1586667499.0,"Nobody deserves to die of starvation, especially not in a state with the fifth largest economy in the world that‚Äôs a part of the richest country in the world."
BadMUAs,fn2amgs,t1_fn1xhrx,1586582666.0,"The mua put makeup all over her chest and shoulders and then it almost matched, haha. But it was significantly darker than her natural skin tone and looked weird until the body makeup was on."
2cb,fmxtqkb,t1_fmxsoky,1586471691.0,"The most mdma-like experience I had was with 12mg I encapsulated & took before going to a club. No visuals, just great body sensations, color enhancement, so much euphoria, and absolutely zero anxiety. I felt super connected with my friends and the random people I was dancing with, but it wasn‚Äôt as pushy or uncontrollable as mdma can feel (OH MY GODDDD I LOVE YOU SO MUUUUCH)."
Coachella,fmx3udq,t1_fmx26qy,1586457981.0,"Oh for sure! I don‚Äôt plan on missing a Coachella for a long time, especially because I‚Äôm moving to California for grad school this fall and I‚Äôll be an hour and a half away from Indio. Six months is just a lot more palatable than a whole year to wait üò©"
Coachella,fmwz4xs,t3_fxwase,1586455589.0,"This was gonna be my first year camping. I think I was looking forward to all of this almost as much as the actual festival because I‚Äôm a person who really loves anticipation and ‚Äúcalm before the storm‚Äù type moments. I talked my whole group into camping instead of shelling out for an airbnb and was so excited. Thank you for all of these details, I could imagine how it would‚Äôve felt to be doing all this and it was nice. Fingers crossed Octoberchella can happen and I actually get to experience it."
Rollerskating,fmklars,t3_fvt8z4,1586158934.0,"So cute! My bf just got a skateboard Friday and we went out together twice this weekend, including for about three hours today. I am definitely a beginner as well, I learned that heel toe trick (not sure what it‚Äôs actually called) today!! Feels so good to be out zooming around with someone :)"
BadMUAs,fmhdguy,t3_fv5je6,1586075648.0,She isn‚Äôt a mua and she‚Äôs matching her face to her body. I really don‚Äôt think this belongs here.
