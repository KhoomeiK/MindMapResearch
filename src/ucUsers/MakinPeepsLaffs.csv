UCSD,fpbofqx,t3_gcghg8,1588474760.0,"Dude, UCSD really wasn't that bad... 

I did the exact same as you, transferred into math-cs. 

the cs department is quite poor from an administrative view, but if you pick the right profs you get a good experience. the ta's are bad and the classes are overcrowded but there's a reason you picked CS and thats the same reason everyone else picks CS... 

can't speak much to the racism since i never experienced it but i'm genuinely sorry that you did.

the social life thing is also pretty false. If you join orgs/do activities that you are interested in, you'll find a community. Live in the village the first year, and make friends through that. Join non-greek orgs, and you'll find people are social. Yeah there's a large percentage that aren't but there's enough to where you can make a good group of friends.

Just saying, I went into UCSD in the exact same position as you (a transfer into math-cs) and i knew literally no one going into ucsd and i don't look back on my time there poorly. Just want to provide a different view."
