UCSantaBarbara,fp36gou,t1_fp35jrx,1588273918.0,"Certain problems you don‚Äôt even realize are unsolvable until you are 10 minutes deep of setting it up and you get to an integral that can‚Äôt be solved or something like that.

It‚Äôd be one thing if this professor warned the class beforehand, but that‚Äôs not the case here.

I agree that time management is a critical skill to have, but I don‚Äôt think this would be an accurate assessment of that"
UCSantaBarbara,fp1cl4w,t1_fp1acex,1588231070.0,"If there was an impossible question on an exam it would really trip me up; I would waste time trying to solve it, taking time away I could‚Äôve used for problems that actually count and aren‚Äôt a huge time sink"

PKA,fosh6ly,t1_fojko8o,1588030634.0,"It‚Äôs easy to come up with an apology that sounds nice when you‚Äôve had years to think it over. Look back at his OG apology video and his real opinion shows pretty clearly.

You say it wasn‚Äôt aimed at children and yet the video titles and thumbnails were targeted directly for that demographic. Along with your PG13 family friendly style of videos it‚Äôs very dishonest to say you weren‚Äôt targeting children. Can‚Äôt believe anybody is buying this bullshit"
playboicarti,foklbmp,t1_fokjyf9,1587844201.0,That‚Äôs what i‚Äôm thinking too. It‚Äôs a shame we‚Äôll never get the ‚Äúfinished‚Äù version of all those songs..

Ideally all core classes should be taken for a letter grade but with the current situation there is going to be some more leniency from grad schools and the like."
