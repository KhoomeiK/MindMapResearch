berkeley,fo9sgk0,t3_g6isgu,1587629556.0,"Some quick background. I'm an incoming Freshman signing up for courses. I have already signed up for Freshman edge and have access to the academics page. The only thing is, when I click enroll in course or add in the enrollment dropdown, it reroutes me to this page I don't have access to. I'm trying to enroll as fast as possible into a popular class and am hoping I can get it. Any advise?"
