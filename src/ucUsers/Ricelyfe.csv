GooglePixel,fph3c18,t1_fpepbnb,1588614229.0,"They do at least in my experience. Not sure how the pixel buds work but with my wireless ear buds, the right side connects to the phone and the left ear bud while left just has to connect with the right. I haven't really paid attention but it seems like it's my right one is the one that runs low first. If the pixel buds are set up the same way it could explain how one is slightly lower than the other"
ucr,fpbog97,t1_fpbjbh8,1588474770.0,Thank you. this makes me feel a lot better about the test. Now I'm a little bit more scared about the classes themselves but can't say I didn't expect it to be all in French at some point
ucr,for0lcq,t1_foqt0sj,1588004098.0,"I don't know what your academic, family or social life is like, but please talk to someone, anyone, everyone you can trust before making that decision. When I was getting dicked by grades my first year, I wish I talked to more people about it before it was too late. Also withdrawing from the quarter or two is not the same as dropping out. Although some advisors are not as helpful as we wish they were i recommend talking to yours anyway, maybe they can help you get a better grasp of the situation.

I hope your situation is something not grade related because thats much harder to repair, coming from first hand experience. That being said if you need a break from school, this situation is as good as any especially for the sake of mental health. I wish you the best of luck."

politics,fo9nl3g,t1_fo9mox9,1587624914.0,pretty much all the food places are open here in California and we have stricter stay at home guidelines than a lot of states. Everything is take out or order in though. I walked to the grocery store yesterday and there was a shop or two open in the shopping center but i think they have a post office inside. Other than that its only places to get food and its all take out.
ArcherFX,fo82afw,t1_fo6u1c2,1587588635.0,"It's not the pay that fucks over young military members, they're well taken care especially compared to many other Americans. It's the outside businesses that target them. If you know what rank they are then you know how much they make. You know they can get a loan cause their employer isn't going anywhere. It's easy business, you just gotta trick them into believe that fancy camaro to race through base in is more important than having money to buy a house, pay for college etc. as soon as they're out."
news,fo16sy2,t1_fo02q84,1587426921.0,"What's interesting is how much we could learn from that pandemic. It's not just the lives lost and the danger, while those are the most important part. There are economic benefits in shutting everything down, in the long term that we can learn from that event. [NPR's planet money did an episode on this](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/828345390

 short term, yes the economy will hurt. Long term, if proper quarantine procedures are followed you'll see a huge rebound and a faster rebound. If there is no quarantine, there's no recovery from lost lives and the economy will suffer worst and for longer. My friend was spouting bullshit about the economy until I showed him the podcast and a fuck ton of other numbers. He's an engineer thought his logic was sound but logic only matters if your assumptions are correct."

The show is ""this type of candy/confectionery etc is sorta like x but they do something to it, so let's start with x and change up a few things."" Cooking really is like chemistry in that you know what base ""chemicals"" are there you just gotta change the portions and procedure to make your desired ""solution/compound""."

You know what Obama did during the onset of the ebola crisis? [He provided aid in money and experts to countries with infected so they could contain it before it could reach our country is significant numbers](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/ebola-response). Bush's response to the avian flu?

What did Trump do on the onset of this current pandemic? Hid the truth from Americans, blamed other countries, refused to put any safeguards in place, kept borders open, fostered hate between Americans and lined the pockets of himself and his cronies. I cannot begin to describe how disgusted I am of our government.

IDGAF about what party you support, there are clear examples in the past two administration for exactly how to respond to this type of shit and the current leeches in government have ignored it. The actions of this administration and the conservatives holding back our response to the virus are vile and inhuman to put it lightly."

I watch Transformers to see giant robots bash each other on the head, Pacific Rim to see giant robots wrestle monsters and Fast and Furious movies to see fast cars go fast and hear some stupid jokes."

White supremacy is more than the KKK and other hate groups. The most dangerous white supremacy is the institutionalized manner that we're taught white is better, how ""whiteness""and is set as a standard and how different minorities are turned against each other based on their perceived ""whiteness"". It's a bit dated but definitely worth a watch, as the issues they talk about are around to this day."

Note this was only my experience at that one apartment complex, but they gave no fucks about what part of the quarter it was or how late it was. people yelling in the court yard and blasting music we can hear from the other side of the building was cool the first week but that shit during midterms and finals was absolutely enraging.

NoStupidQuestions,fn1z79j,t3_fyns5l,1586573717.0,"For some of us it wasn't so bad. I wouldn't say the best years of my life, but definitely best of adolescence. I understood and pass pretty much all my classes with As and B's with no effort, calculus kicked my ass. As soon as school ended I had no obligations to do shit. You have the feeling of purpose with little to no actual responsibilities (for most of us). 

You hear it most from adults who have little to no enjoyable memories after that. Maybe they went straight to work and have only known work after school. I went to college after HS and this definitely is better in every way, even though I've had more significant fuck ups in college. If I went straight to work, with little to no social life I could see myself saying its the best years of my life so far."
explainlikeimfive,fmp39jw,t3_fwigq6,1586273597.0,"Your eyes never really see things the same as you ""see"". It takes your brain to process it and add its own bias. Your brain also reacts faster than your eyes so you often ""see"" something before your eyes do. Most common example of this is reading, you actually mostly skim each word when you read, focusing on the beginning and end of words.

If you have no extra factor affecting you like dyslexia, you should be able to read that entire paragraph fine, even though the letters of each word is scrambled. Our brain does this with everything we sense in our surroundings. When we enter a room, we actually just look for dangers and significant things. Our brains fill in the rest with whatever makes the most sense, but sometimes what makes the most sense doesn't match with reality. That's our brain ""playing tricks"" on you, at night its even easier cause our brain has even less information from the environment and fills in more."
