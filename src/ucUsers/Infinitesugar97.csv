ucla,fpkg3wb,t3_gcisow,1588694060.0,"Ummmmm no I personally wouldn’t. Everyone gets sick in the dorms especially the first couple of weeks, so with the coronavirus going around I definitely wouldn’t even want to be around personally."
ucla,fpkfm4i,t3_gbdq1n,1588693803.0,The Ralph’s I have been to lately don’t even have wipe to wipe your cart. Also they don’t enforce social distancing. Two weeks ago I went to Ralph’s and they let SO many people be in the store it was ridiculous. No lines or anything. Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods had lines and were enforcing it. Some Whole Foods stores are even sanitizing the carts themselves. At least offer the WIPES.
ucla,fpij3ag,t3_gdj169,1588641955.0,Also hilarious to me on their non endorsement of Carl. His opponent Aidan wrote for the Daily Bruin. How does that not signal extreme bias lol.
ucla,fpfqmcr,t3_gd4hhm,1588579965.0,"LOLLL @ DB. First of all in my class last year in Spring 2019, some of their members literally had a MELTDOWN in my class bc of who was selected as the new editor. A lot of ppl at DB didn’t like who was selected. They literally stomped their feet on the ground and were super freaking loud bitching and complaining.

I could easily judge the group of people at DB and degrade them, right?? Essentially that’s what we see here, they degraded transfer students as a whole. Saying they have “limited knowledge”, and transfer students don’t have time to pursue professional relationships. It’s so degrading and just shows bias and the fact that they believe traditional students deserve it more. Like huh?? Seriously, they fucked up.

Also Carl’s opponent wrote for the Daily Bruin lol. So much bias it’s unreal."
TheMarvelousMrsMaisel,fp84aeq,t1_fmfqgbj,1588383085.0,I also thought he was going to die. Pretty surprised at how the ending turned out tbh!
ucla,fp2p718,t3_gapth6,1588265570.0,So what if you’re in a jam packed impacted major? Do you guys think it’s a given that those will be all online?? I think so :/
DACA,foz7n03,t1_foz5omr,1588186039.0,"Haha no, you are! I hope everyone can just learn to be less judgmental towards each other. I used to be really judgmental, but I have been trying to not let myself take anything personally. There’s enough bad crap going on in the world right now to add attacking one another other too."
DACA,foz58p7,t1_foz4jc8,1588184899.0,"Oh it’s nothing, I saw that you were getting ambushed and it pissed me off. I am sorry you got attacked. In general, I hope what people learn to realize (as harddddd as it can be) not everyone has the same situation! You are not an ungrateful or crappy daughter at all, don’t let them make you feel that way. I read what you said about you completely supporting your mom right now, you are a good person. They are just sensitive because they think that literally everyone has the same situation or set of circumstances, and it’s an attack on their parents."
DACA,foz4549,t1_foyx422,1588184371.0,Why is it so wrong to say that you don’t think it’s okay for your parents to have overstayed their visa if they didn’t have to?Explain to me why it is so offensive to you. Do you know that persons situation? No. You are all basing your judgement from your own personal experience.
DACA,foz31yx,t1_foz2f52,1588183844.0,"Exactly. It’s wrong. I’ve seen people on here attack others for not having enough money to renew DACA. Things happen, not everyone has the same situation. People need to sit down and stop being so fucking judgmental towards people if they don’t want any judgement cast on them. It’s not right.

Good on you to defend yourself."
DACA,foylc2e,t1_fowzflz,1588174579.0,"So then you could argue what about the people who are stuck in a third world country struggling to get by? Those who do go through the legal channel to come? People are falsely saying here “only” rich and privileged people come here legally, and that’s just not true. This is where people, rightly, get angry. It is cheapening the immigration process. Student visas? I know families whose parents sacrificed a LOT to be able to come from a third world country. I myself had family members wait 10 years to be able to come here. Fuck them, right? You are acting entitled and privileged as well, by shooting this person down and taking what they are saying waaaayyy too sensitive to heart. The whole argument right now against giving DACA recipients amnesty is because if you give amnesty, then they can apply for their parents later. What about the people who wait to come here legally, who are still waiting?

It is a damn lie to say people do not come here for the opportunity. There are those who definitely come to escape poverty and violence. Many are here for the opportunity, undocumented or not. No matter how supportive we are of those who have sacrificed everything, what is legal should always be prioritized. There was never any guarantee that a program like DACA would be created. That’s what this poster is trying to say. That he didn’t have to come to the US, because DACA came by luck, and if he didn’t get it he would’ve been screwed. The US having DACA as an option is a huge blessing.

It isn’t an attack against your parents. I know people want to defend their parents and get sensitive, but you can’t read into what other people are saying. As I easily did to you in my argument against you lol. That’s basically how you are acting. Don’t take things to heart like that, not everything is insulting someone personally."
LosAngeles,fosja48,t1_fos7iue,1588031805.0,"Of course we should always inform ourselves from whatever information we get anywhere. The uptick in cases, could have to do with other factors, but one of them could certainly be the amount of people who weren't social distancing last weekend. I am hoping that is not the case."

LosAngeles,fos2ora,t1_forhlod,1588022880.0,"I have been only going to grocery stores that I know aren’t busy and at off hours. How much time do you really spend at a grocery store anyway though..an hour right? At the beach you spend much more time. Especially considering how the LA beaches are closed, where people went and drove out of their way to go to the beach. The pictures and videos I saw, that’s not social distancing! Also then, PARKING. If all the beach lots are closed, then everyone is trying to find parking and jamming their cars together. Inevitable you are going to have people walking along narrow sidewalks going towards the path of the beach. It would be ok if it isn’t that many people, but the reality is that it’s too much. Another way of living is putting other people at risk, not just for their health but putting them through an even LONGER stay at home order. There is no excuse to crowd a beach like that."
LosAngeles,fos1yam,t1_formipw,1588022500.0,"Lmao so what are you going to choose to believe if it’s not from the TV or the news? Science, right? Well by the looks of what happened this weekend, that was not social distancing and now there could be an uptick in cases. Is that also going to be a lie if and when that happens (hopefully not)?"
LosAngeles,fopupzo,t1_fopug6z,1587972764.0,"Yup. It's just maddening, because as people were saying, the anger and demands should be directed at the government. No one else. 1200 is not enough for people who are unemployed, certainly not in Los Angeles. It's also extremely frustrating that THIS is what gets people out to protest. So many things that are going wrong and this is what gets people out...it's just unbelievable."
LosAngeles,fopgpf2,t1_fopd9bq,1587961038.0,I’ve been seeing the same thing. It’s mostly people who are against the beach closures getting downvoted.
LosAngeles,fopg1rv,t1_fooc4u1,1587960554.0,Most likely living in the same household? Why is everyone coming up with assumptions to justify this?
LosAngeles,fopfp8z,t1_fooqpzm,1587960302.0,Extremely questionable. Wonder what the reaction will be when we see an uptick in cases.
politics,fokemop,t1_fok48k1,1587840649.0,"lol you clearly missed the point completely, especially given the inconsistencies and weird Putin obsession that this lady had."
Conservative,foke2y7,t1_fok0z6p,1587840356.0,"lol. People are clearly showing where their party loyalty lies when they just completely forget about Trump and that tape. Not only that, but ALL the women who have come forward regarding his behavior. Oh...lets just forget about that now, shall we? If the argument is that Biden's indiscretions need to be reported, well then - you have to acknowledge Trump's. sowwy. It doesn't work when you just focus on one person. Also, let's not forget that Trump had ties to Jeffrey Epstein AND there was a lawsuit charging him with raping a 13 year old girl. How convenient that it was dropped right before the election. Bottom line: Don't make excuses for anyone."
LosAngeles,foiunv6,t1_fofhy7k,1587797589.0,"Around late November early December I had the WORST cold I have ever gotten in my life. I also thought it was the flu at that time, and maybe it could’ve been. In February when I got back from LAX I got sick again, and this time it wasn’t as bad. I don’t know if I had it but the way I got sick was very weird. I hadn’t gotten sick like that since I was a kid."
LosAngeles,foiuetr,t3_g7lrrj,1587797350.0,"Helloooo everyone we don’t have a vaccine lol. It takes 4-5 years to come out with a vaccine, and they’re saying it could take 12-18 months for one. IF EVEN THEN. There is no guarantee of anything. Please be safe."

LosAngeles,fo0ot4b,t3_g4igrv,1587417001.0,"This is what makes me the most angry, the fact that these workers are forgotten and getting paid the same. They should be getting paid way more. They are so brave and it’s shameful the way this country treats them."
Advice,fnmkqp5,t3_g2jt6e,1587073196.0,"I’m glad it has helped you. Please, do not keep anything to yourself. Remember, life is full of disappointments. You have so many things to look forward to in life. Going to college, having a career, starting a family if you wish to have one. Seeing your sibling grow up. It’s full of disappointments but it’s full of wonder and happiness too. Make the most out of your teen years and do things that make you happy. Learn and be so resilient that one day you can help others with the success you have had. It’s not easy but it will be worth it. Please feel free to pm me or anyone else who has offered if you ever need to talk. Seriously. Do not even think about throwing your life away. Throw that suicide note away. Be strong. Things will get better, they always do. Live to see that."
Advice,fnlrvan,t3_g2en5o,1587058650.0,"First of all, your parents fighting and their struggles has never and will never be your fault. Please believe that and never blame yourself.

You are in a toxic environment right now. Is there anyone that you know that you can trust who will let you stay with them? In a year you will be 18 and be able to go wherever you want. Have you talked to your parents and told them how you feel? If that doesn’t help, you need to bring in a third party who knows what is going on and have a sit down with your parents.

You are a strong person. I promise it’ll get better."
Advice,fnlqxwv,t3_g2crf4,1587058195.0,"Hey, look I know right now the world seems like it’s too much for you to bear and the weight is crushing you. One day it won’t feel like that, and believe me that things DO get better. Your mom and your dad love you, and you would be robbing your sibling of having the chance to know you. I cannot imagine a parent losing a child, but your parents will have unimaginable pain and never be able to get over it. Your sibling would get your parents broken as parents. For the traumatic experiences you have been through, I am so sorry. There is nothing that anyone can say that can make that go away. You have to confide in your mom or dad. You are a brave young person, and the solution to get through this pain that you are having is to express to your parents what is going on. If you don’t express what’s going on, how can they help you? You can trust your parents and tell them.

One day you’re going to do amazing and great things, and you’re going to want to help others who are facing something similar - and bring up how you went through it."
minnesota,fnjf3y5,t1_fni705l,1586997689.0,"lmao what exactly are YOU proposing here? I'm sorry, but what story could they possibly have other than the fact that they want to be outside. Really. This isn't just going on in one state, it's multiple states. You mean to tell me that it can't be that simple of a reason. Calm."
OurPresident,fnhv3aa,t1_fnhlpxa,1586969350.0,"Seriously. Seeing some posts on here really makes me question the intelligence of people in the United States. You can be upset that Bernie lost all you want, but once the Supreme Court is changed for decades that’s IT. Goodbye to the progressive candidate getting their fair shot at getting things done."
minnesota,fnhuban,t1_fn6mpcy,1586968972.0,"What exactly could these people have going on lol. The right thing to do isn’t to just not do anything, this is a pandemic and people have to take it seriously."
LosAngeles,fngjwat,t1_fnf9ry8,1586934591.0,"I agree. I think this also is the realization a lot of people are going to come to. I myself have come to this realization as well. LA is beautiful and there is so much to do, but realistically most people are not able to afford a home here. It sucks."
OurPresident,fnf2h57,t1_fnerh4o,1586900193.0,lol ok.
OurPresident,fnerdoj,t1_fneq9u8,1586894490.0,"Yeah, I did think that they would lose this time because of the way things were going in the beginning. I am sure a lot of Bernie supporters also felt the same way lol. Just because my prediction was wrong, doesn't mean that your prediction is going to somehow turn out to be right? lol. You supported Bernie for a reason, with the HOPE that he would be the nominee. I am sure you felt some level of hope that he could potentially be the nominee.

Answer this for me: How is a Progressive candidate going to have a fair chance if everything becomes a shit show, e.g., no supreme court, climate change wrecking everything, more conservative country, etc."
OurPresident,fneq6wu,t1_fnep38j,1586893885.0,"I thought in my mind that Bernie would be the nominee with certainty as well. I turned out to be wrong. There is always room for error in our human predictions. What's the difference between you and I? lol. None of us can be certain about anything, and it's not right to be willing to bet against the future of your country based on your prediction that you think is 100% full proof. I am just saying here, THINK of the long game. I wanted the same candidate as you, but we are rigging the game against a future Progressive candidate if we are not proactive now."
OurPresident,fnep06c,t1_fneodx8,1586893285.0,"""You're the only one to blame"" lol....ok. If you get the Supreme Court to be changed for decades, then who is the one to blame? You and I both don't know for sure if he will lose to Trump, or if he will win against Trump. The point is, there is a possibility he could beat him. And if he does, then that's four years of Biden at the minimum, AND the possibility of someone progressive coming along that will be able to do great things without dealing with the supreme court being red. You have to think of the long game here."
OurPresident,fnenqys,t1_fnemrms,1586892638.0,"Then you are also accepting 20-30 years of the Supreme Court being red. That's what you want? You may not even live to see your revolution. This is about climate change, this is about immigration. This isn't just about one thing or one candidate. This is about the future of this country. If we ignore this NOW then the next person who comes around as a candidate may not get the chance that they deserve to do great things."
OurPresident,fnemk6d,t1_fnelpzg,1586892039.0,"THIS. People don't understand that the Supreme Court is at stake. Oh, and it's not just Roe vs Wade that is at stake. Then you are set back ANOTHER 20-30 years. What guarantee is there for any of you to be around? Pretty selfish and entitled if you ask me."

LosAngeles,fmy4p9m,t1_fmy0fng,1586478064.0,"What type of argument do you think in your mind this is that you are trying to win?? I honestly don't get it. I'm not attacking you lol. To say that Russia wasn't a factor in Trump getting elected is dishonest, and no I am not saying that YOU are saying that - but it is a factor. The same way it is dishonest in regards to not acknowledging the lack of voter turnout. There were multiple things at play, it wasn't just one thing. And it's the same way for every election."
LosAngeles,fmxycdn,t1_fmxk48o,1586474304.0,"yeah...so far lol. wait until 4 more years of trump when there will be more conservative justices put on the supreme court. then what? I mean, it's fine if you're conservative, but if you're not then it becomes a problem."
LosAngeles,fmxy8w3,t1_fmxi8zi,1586474250.0,"hey don't get all mad and triggered at me lol. It sounded to me based on the response you gave to the other person, that's that what you were saying - since they were saying that Trump cheated. He did win the election, but he did it with cheating and I think that's what that person was trying to say. That's all. I agree with you, it's a mess. At the end of the day this is what it is. Young people sat out and didn't vote for Bernie, and usually young people don't vote to begin with. Biden's gaffes hurt but him over Trump any day for me. I do think there is a good shot Biden could win...we'll see what happens."
LosAngeles,fmxhqq1,t1_fmxelpk,1586465215.0,"You really think it won't change your life in any way? How does it not?? The supreme court....hello. That affects ALL our lives....for a long time. People just think its roe vs wade lol but there is soooo much more that could change. I'm sorry, but voting does matter - and that's one of the biggest reasons."
LosAngeles,fmxhiqj,t1_fmx9t1l,1586465096.0,"Yeah, but it's not there. So there are two options, and that's just the way it is. We can complain and bitch about it, but at the end of the day there is no other choice - other than to sit out and not vote. I rather Trump GTFO than 4 more years of Trump."
LosAngeles,fmx1mdl,t1_fmwy7ix,1586456851.0,"But trump did cheat in a way lol. He invited Russia to interfere in our election. He looked at the camera and told Russia to release the rest of his emails. There were other things at play, but Trump is not innocent."
LosAngeles,fmx1dz3,t1_fmx0y2x,1586456732.0,"Oh wow. That is a little weird. I’m not sure, but at least we know our stay at home order will be extended to May."
LosAngeles,fmx15i1,t1_fmwy80h,1586456613.0,"But then again trump was also accused by many more women too. NEVER let alone forget that. Two wrongs don’t make a right, but I mean...what are we supposed to do? There’s no way around it at this point. It’s either Biden or Trump, and I do not want Trump. I wanted Bernie but it’s not going to happen."

SandersForPresident,fmuit04,t1_fmu3ecl,1586392241.0,"I understand, believe me, I do. I have a lot of doubts and pessimism myself. But what good does that lead to? You have to at least remain positive and hope that something better will come along, and then to support those who do come along. One of the biggest issues is that young people don't vote, and even Sanders said it himself - it really did hurt him. Where were they? We need to mobilize young people and get them to vote, make it easier to vote before we can have leaders like Sanders."

I am inspired and maybe want to run, there are so many Bernie supporters out there who are young who feel the same way. There are future leaders to come from this, and that's what you have to keep fighting for. We won't get President Trump for life, regardless of whether or not he gets re-elected he WILL leave office when his time comes to leave. It sucks that this happened, but there is great potential.

Why is the city suddenly able to house the homing in hotels, and what is the city going to do once the pandemic is over with the homeless that they housed in hotels?

Also, the farmers markets were temporarily suspended for being overcrowded. Recent images have shown this past Sunday overcrowding and lack of social distancing at some farmers markets. What is your response to this, and shouldn’t there be another suspension for the safety of the public?"
