You might also be interested in other areas of biology and research, especially since med school often brings patient interaction with it, which is what took me away from a healthcare profession and into research instead. Statistical and computational biology/bioinformatics are great fields to get into for your interest in  pharmacology, epidemiology and immunology."

When assessing pay, it's also useful to consider what a typical workweek looks like. I've been told that while labs may not be toxic, they might just have a culture of taking your work home, or doing long hours, and this has been the general consensus I've heard for Broad. No matter how friendly a PI is, that can be either really draining or motivating for you, and it's a personal decision. As discreetly as possible, I recommend talking with people in each place off the record to see where you best fit."

bioinformatics,fok1vvr,t1_fok0fcp,1587833836.0,"Sorry, I should really specify I was talking in bioinformatics at big research institutions, which are hot programs that win national training grants more easily. It's a shame but non-STEM degrees really don't get anything livable. Thanks for the input on Canadian PhD conditions. Harvard, NYU, and UCSF are in two of the most expensive cities to live in, so the 45k is adjusted to that. In midwest college towns and less metropolitan areas it's more like 26k. At the UCs it's about 33k. These were the stipend offers given to the people I interviewed with this year, but my sample size is limited to top 50 schools. It's not worth it to come to the US for something below that unless you really want the American citizenship in my opinions because there's amazing work in Europe. My one insert is that there are much more private sector jobs in the states.

It definitely makes applicants more competitive if they come with their own grant of fellowship but the ones I know of are national and require you to be a US resident upon application. I didnt mean to generalize and I especially don't mean say a PhD is going to be an easy life. Yes, the stipend is enough to live on, but it's going to be long hours."
bioinformatics,fojzpxi,t1_fojvvas,1587832631.0,"It's not extravagant, but PhDs in the US have stipends that come with tuition waivers and health coverage for all admitted students. The prestigious schools you would want to be spending half a decade of your life at normally grant enough to live comfortably. Like Harvard's or NYU's stipends are near $46k annually which in those cities is enough to cover a decent one bedroom apartment and occasionally eating out. It's a different story in California where you might have to cohabit, but I'd say bioinformatics programs are well funded enough in the states that the pay is significantly above minimum wage and it's about what you would get paid as an intro research associate."

It just shows they care more about you being their ideal high output worker than they do about getting to know you and helping you grow in the direction you want.

It's not the choice for everybody, but my experience being the main bioinformatics analyst in a lab at the end of my undergrad allowed me to be much more involved in the research design and manuscript writing process and I believe it gave me the confidence and soft skills that have made it easier for me to find jobs and apply for grad school."

bioinformatics,fo9gjha,t3_g6gfwv,1587618905.0,"Hey,

Chiming in as someone in a bioinformatics undergrad program, I can answer some of these.

> Getting on with self-teaching the two languages (I have no previous experience in computer science, but have always been more tech savvy than average) 

I was in CS courses so I can't say much about self teaching. I do however know that learning a programming language from scratch with the basic problems can be very boring, and much of bioinfo just relies on understanding and running existing programs/packages. Because of this, it might be helpful for you to also explore ""vignettes"" on how to run pipelines. For example, the Pachter Lab has walkthroughs on how to crunch RNA-sequencing data with the Sleuth R package ( [https://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/walkthroughs](https://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/walkthroughs) ). 

If you're just interested in learning more and getting more fluent with the topic and seeing what kind of skills are crucial, I heavily recommend you seek out seminars and weekly talks. Faculty and grad students often plan these during coffee break/lunch hours, so it's a free snack, and they invite local researchers or even fly in colleagues to give brief presentations on their research. It'll be super impressive to them to see an undergrad there, and you'll have a leg up in networking to find research opportunities. 

> Reaching out to the university to gain real research experiences 

I'm from a California school, but I do have family going to U of Calgary. Both research environments are the same, so I'll assume it's similar at U of A. I think a lot of people will stress to you that it doesn't hurt to reach out, and it really doesn't. As a first year, I joined academic clubs to get tips on faculty looking for undergrads, and that was a start, but I ultimately ended up in my lab position by just cold emailing. Just something polite and short like ""Hi Dr.\_\_\_\_, I was looking at faculty and I saw that this thing you work on is very interesting. May I come to your office hours or have a quick meeting to chat with you about how I can get involved?"" and a brief description of who you are. There's a 10% rule that says you'll only get responses from 10% of the emails you send, and that's been pretty true for my experience, so don't feel discouraged! 

> Common mistakes/misconceptions to be aware as someone who's just starting to learn coding, and bioinformatics 

This is one people don't talk about much, but I think my biggest mistake was being lazy when setting up my coding installations, whether it be C++ or Python or R. I got sloppy and just installed them as whatever version I found first and just hit ok to wherever the installer automatically wanted to put them. This gave me issues down the road as some bioinformatics tools that depend on calling these programs require complex dependencies, and maybe even older versions, and they can clash with system installations. It's not a huge deal, but as someone who uses Python daily, it was a pain to sit down and wipe it all and start over. I would just start with a Miniconda installation for Python and install whatever packages you need as you go, and make sure you're aware of where all the tools you're downloading are going. I've still yet to figure out the best way to install R."

bioinformatics,fnv0zx3,t1_fnu4l88,1587276764.0,"Oops, I'm sorry. I hope you don't get spammed. Thank you for the well wishes! I couldn't agree more with everything you said and I'm so glad to hear you generally positive outlook on bioinformatics as a career since there was a long time I was considering my PhD and there was only griping on this sub about the limited job market. I'd love to hear your personal reflections about your degree and how it has served (or not served) you. It's really interesting to see how our education has changed over time but I'm sure you have a lot of wisdom on some of the tradition still embroiled in academia. I'd really like to be a professor some day and I'll take all the opinions I can get."
bioinformatics,fnv0j46,t1_fnuvq3q,1587276355.0,"I applied directly from undergrad with an official major in Bioengineering with a specialization in Bioinformatics and a minor in math, so I do think stats and machine learning are desirable. My math lends itself to a lot of linear algebra, statistics, and modeling with differential equations, which kind of makes up the basic theory of machine learning, but my practical experience with it was in my internship and research work. I'm a biological sequence gal, and I like developing omics software to glean more information from next gen sequencing. I have been in research since my first year and I'm graduating after my third year, but I spent the entire time working in research labs, so the reference letters definitely helped. I can only speak on PhD programs since those were the only ones I applied to, and normally they only have 10 to 20 spots each year with over 400 people applying. Your PhD is funded by institutional training grants normally: you get paid a livable stipend (your first year in rotations+classes are covered by the grant and then a lab covers you after) and the grant covers your tuition. In essence it is like a job interview because of this. Oftentimes if a program thinks you're great but maybe not their top 20, they'll shop around to labs that might take you as a direct admit (the lab shoulders your stipend for the first year, you skip rotations), or they offer you join as a Masters student and you paying tuition estimates their budget issue. They then usually allow you the option of extending it into a PhD. In this way, yes your chances of getting into a program are higher if you can secure contact with a lab that will want to take you on, but it's not a guarantee, especially at a top school. I applied to my undergrad institution because it's one of the best in the US and I got in (DM me if you want to know where). I also name dropped PIs of interest (POIs) everywhere else I applied. The three schools I didn't get into likely screened me out right at the start because of my GPA and no amount of pre-planning and networking could have gotten me in at this point, being straight from a 3 year undergrad with only what I could have achieved in that time. This is where gap years are essential to some people and I interviewed with many brilliant people who took the time to work on their resumes and network and got into top schools so I don't think it's a bad idea at all, and it can help a lot if the cost of a MS is infeasible for you.

Machine learning is hot in the field and desirable. However I would say that the biological and medical community extremely cautious about machine learning in general and depending in the place you end up, some of the more ""black box"" methods such as neural nets will be faced with skepticism until you can show undeniably good results. That's just my remark on research culture, especially in private industry, since they are trying to produce reliable results that can be pushed through clinical trials and to patients/healthcare providers. Stats is the bread and butter of this industry and that's always desirable."
bioinformatics,fnu3toa,t1_fntafwz,1587253995.0,"I'd like to add that with the recent covid-19 crisis, there is a surge in hiring for bioinformatics, and there is a slackening of degree requirements as such. Even with it, building expertise in subject matter and really pushing for your resume to get considered (weekly follow up emails, applying through multiple avenues like LinkedIn, etc) can help you get a foot in the door without a graduate degree. I did an internship after my second year as a undergraduate in bioinformatics major bachelors degree even though they were looking for MS students. It was part luck that I spent my first year doing research in their exact topic of interest, but it was also part resilience and refusal to be ghosted on my part. I wish you the best of luck!

Also I've successfully applied for 5 PhD programs across the United States and got offers to two. I'm excited to be starting my degree in the fall. I'm happy to answer any questions, so feel free to DM me."
menstrualcups,fmlr51o,t3_fuvzyl,1586191695.0,I use the Lena Cup size small and I cut off the stem entirely since the cup itself has ridges to grip for removal. I normally empty it at home in the shower so I don't worry too much about spillage but that might happen since you have to squeeze the cup to get it out (the silicon is on the stiffer side which I like since it unfolds easily). This is the cup with the highest capacity I've found for that length without being extra wide or round.
