berkeley,fpm4wzp,t1_fplq2vj,1588725632.0,Thank you for your insight! It's nice to know that I wouldn't have to give up research to join Greek life. I'll definitely PM you if I have any other questions! :)
berkeley,fplioit,t1_fpli7cl,1588713408.0,Good to know! I appreciate your help! :)
berkeley,fplhk5i,t1_fplg9wz,1588712829.0,"Thank you so much! Also, would you say that it's easier to make friends in a sorority than in other student orgs that are professionally/academically-oriented, or even professional frats?"
berkeley,fplfpwp,t1_fplbuh6,1588711890.0,"Thank you! Does it take up a lot of your time? I'm more interested in doing research tbh, so I want to make sure that I have enough time to do both,"
ApplyingToCollege,fplfk1m,t3_ge53mi,1588711807.0,"Hi, prospective junior transfer from a big T10 public school. I was dreading having to ask for letters of rec, too, but it went a lot better than I expected. I asked my research mentor who I had been working with for over a year, my boss, and a professor who I had only known for about a month and a half. All were very supportive and actually asked me my reasons for transferring. Keep in mind that a lot of them probably have gotten these requests before, if not for transferring definitely for grad school. Also a huge portion of college students transfer, but it feels a lot rarer than it actually is. My recommendation is to establish a relationship with the professor/employer/mentor that you plan on asking; otherwise their letter might be kind of generic and won't highlight your personal qualities. My professor got to know me really well because I went to their office hours every week and participated in class; I was also genuinely interested in the subject matter, which definitely helps."
TransferStudents,fpkxlud,t3_g7zzhj,1588702794.0,"Hi! I know I'm pretty late, but I am currently a second-year at a a UC and was just accepted as a transfer to UCLA and Berkeley. UC to UC transfer is definitely possible, but intercampus transfers are much rarer than CC transfers; I'm not sure if it's more difficult for intercampus transfers or if less apply. I don't know how long you've been at your CC, so if you want to do another year there, then I think you should look into the maximum amount of units that transfers can have. I was at my UC for the whole 2 years, so the process/requirements might be different.

I'm sorry that things didn't turn out as you had hoped. I know how difficult it is to get excited about enrolling when you have your heart set on another school. UCSD and UCI are wonderful schools, and you will receive an excellent education at either institution."
UCSantaBarbara,fpf34jx,t1_fpex4lg,1588560666.0,"Not at all! I know some people who chose UCSB over Berkeley who are content with their decision. And UCSB has so much more to offer than its parties, so it's not like you'd be sacrificing academics and extracurriculars for partying; like I said, you will receive an excellent education at UCSB!"
UCSantaBarbara,fpf2ll2,t1_fpewn8l,1588560325.0,Ahaha fr
UCSantaBarbara,fpeiibz,t1_fpei0o4,1588548204.0,"I'm sorry to hear about that :( it's really unfortunate that the label has persisted. Do you think it's harmed your job prospects, or are comments like those annoying at worst?"
UCSantaBarbara,fpe9nsx,t1_fpe90ho,1588543145.0,hehe thank you! :)))

UCSantaBarbara,fp4ywuw,t1_fp4wkj5,1588311153.0,Of course! Best of luck to you :)
UCSantaBarbara,fp4w4do,t3_gbam5d,1588308944.0,"Depends on what you want out of your college experience. Do you want to surf and be surrounded by beautiful natural scenery, or do you want to be in a big, diverse city? Do you want a rigorous environment, or one that's more chill? What you might consider a pro could be a con to someone else. For example, I'm not a super outdoorsy person, and I come from a big city, so I gravitate towards urban areas; UCSB couldn't provide me with that. But a lot of people are attracted to the location because they want to surf, hike, etc., so the location is definitely a pro for them. Another example is the atmosphere. Coming into college, I thought that I wanted to be in a super academic environment, but UCSB is pretty laid back (totally overgeneralizing, of course). But there were a lot of upsides to this. I found that there was less competition, which definitely helped with available opportunities/resources that weren't as sought after as a pre-professional environment like, say, Berkeley. I didn't feel the need to compare myself to my peers as much. Long answer, but pros and cons are pretty relative, and it's hard to tell what you think about these aspects until you've experienced them. Before you make your decision, I'd suggest making a note of ""hard-no's"" and ""hard yes's"", or things that you definitely want in a college. For me, I knew that I wanted to be at least a few hours away from home. I wanted the opportunity to do research. I wanted an affordable education (if you can afford out-of-state tuition, then go for it!). Congrats on getting off the waitlist!"
UCSantaBarbara,fp4lj9g,t1_foxmn5b,1588301700.0,"I was planning on doing the same thing! I'm actually transferring from UCSB to another school, but I don't want to shorten what will already be a limited amount of time at my new school :/"
berkeley,fp49c2s,t1_fotmmus,1588294289.0,"Thank you so much, your perspective is really interesting! I'll definitely look into ISF."

berkeley,fokka9c,t1_foit2m8,1587843646.0,Noted. Thank you!
berkeley,fokk9ds,t1_foipoz6,1587843633.0,Thanks so much! That's really helpful to know.
berkeley,foi0k9b,t3_g7ghw3,1587776265.0,"I also applied to Berkeley as a high school senior, was waitlisted, and ultimately rejected. I was crushed. Considered going to a CC but ended up going to another UC, and I was accepted to Cal as a transfer student! It may seem far away, but the time really does fly, so keep working hard! :)"

berkeley,fob0ivk,t1_foae6q3,1587654721.0,"That's great to hear! Were there a lot of public health research opportunities for undergrads, or were the options scarce?"
berkeley,fnxfx8y,t1_fnxd82h,1587337801.0,"Yeah, that's a good point. I'm just worried about the competition for opportunities at Cal since my current school is pretty laid back and noncompetitive."
berkeley,fnwhbyn,t1_fnwgeed,1587318383.0,"At my current school I'm a Global Studies major, but I want to pursue Public Health (which they don't have at my school)!"
