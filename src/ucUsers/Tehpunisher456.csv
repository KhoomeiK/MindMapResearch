Showerthoughts,fp1bzjl,t3_gaj9rp,1588230526.0,This happened to my aunt. She grew up with severe menstrual cramps and would take like 1000+ mg doses of ibuprofen just to even mildly ease the pain. When she had my cousin she was asked about her menstrual pain because the found a mass on her uterus. She explained what I said and the doctor was shocked stating that the pain she was experiencing is giving birth level pain (since I guess it takes doses that strong to ease the pain) and she was like oh i just thought this is how bad cramps are. She ended up having a tumor almost as big as my cousin removed from her about half a year to a year after having him.

ReefTank,fny6gwd,t1_fny3wba,1587354584.0,"Yeah I figured they are. Someone seemingly broke down their tank and donated it to a lfs which didnt want it. So they gave me half a bucket full of coral and 2 fish (a pajama cardinal and an onyx percula clown). We didnt want the pajama cardinal and considered the clown but since we already have a clown pair we couldn't keep it (considering she was bigger than ours) so we gave away both.  But we kept a decent sized torch, a duncan with at least 25 heads, this scan, some xenia, and a candy cane with like 30 heads. They also had some acros but they were non recoverable. The torch I posted the other day was from this haul. Man I really thank the old couple who gave me this.

Edit: in fairness, I had just pissed off the acans because I scraped the algae off the glass next to this and I think I may have poked it slightly. They were much more inflated prior to that"

I had mine before go up from under my tank into my all in one. But how would I go about doing that in a sumped system since the water is supposed to go into the sump. But (for me) said sump has a lower water line than what my reservoir would have and would continue to drain until both have matching water levels. How can I prevent that"

sodadungeon,fnhycqu,t3_g1u26n,1586970901.0,"So you have your attack value. Let's say its 500. Then you have your crit chance. You want to get that as close to 100% if not 100%. Then it's the actual crit damage. For assassin dagger it is 200% depending on what level it is. What you do is convert that to decimal by dividing by 100 and add 1. The 1 is for your base damage. So in total you should have 500 base damage times 3 which us 1500 damage. This is for just the assassins dagger. To see how much you actually will crit you have to tap on the character themselves (like if you were going to fire them or save equipment.) There it tells you the whole summary of how much crit chance and damage. For me (I'm still technically a noob) I am in the final dimension with about 1500 attack, 100% crit chance about 780% crit damage and 30%physical damage so in total it will be (1500*(1+7.8)*(1+0.3) which is about 17000 damage, wayyyy higher than my base damage. That's why you need to to max out crit chance. Usually demon armor and dagger get you close to if not max crit chance along with a boost to crit damage

Edit:I forgot the dragon sword. So this sword is basically a better assassin dagger since (if I remember correctly) it has higher crit chance and damage along with higher base damage. So it quite literally is the legendary upgrade of that dagger. One more thing positioning matters alot. If you slot your guys on the left of the screen where there is 3 of your team you do regular damage. If you slot them on the right you get a surrounded bonus which is a static 50% damage buff, so in total your damage would be (500*(1+2)*1.5) which is 2250. But this is ONLY for the 2 on the right

Edit again: your damage maths out. Because 138 * 3.72 is higher than 147 * 2.46. The reason why your damage is off is likely because of the positioning thing.  Combine high crit chance and high crit damage and slot those characters on the right and the numbers get multiplicatively large. I usually farm until I get demon armor, assassins daggers (in your case use the 1 dragon sword), the frost shield (highest attack unless you have shields that have extra physical damage like shield if quinx or bunny shield) and dragon blood for accessories. Then I put my strongest on the left (kinda weird to say but to even out damage ) and my 2 next strongest on the right ( the last 2 slots)"
