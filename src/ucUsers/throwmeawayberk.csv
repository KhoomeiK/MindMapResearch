berkeley,forev6v,t1_fordlva,1588011040.0,"Well regarding your question about responsibility, you can’t just pretend like you’re not living at home when you’re living at home.

When I was at berk I interacted with my family significantly less so that already gave me enough free time and little to no distractions. Seeing and interacting with family on a daily basis sucks up time. But it’s still manageable I guess. Part of me is just plain lazy and sees home as a place of rest but thats just my take."

berkeley,fngcfta,t3_g1gmoh,1586928061.0,I got 68 bruh. Definitely taking this class as PNP. I’m just a lazy mf. I should’ve gone to the zoom discussion as they make it so much easier to understand the concepts.
berkeley,fmcy01g,t3_fufu65,1585955133.0,"Same, honestly gonna do whatever I can and resubmit. As for the midterm I’m watching lectures at 3x and it’s lowkey working. I feel like ee16a organization wise is so lackluster. Part of the reason I’m behind is because of my laziness, but the course staff is essentially teaching us everything they originally slated which is what I think is borderline crazy. Classes such as 61a have given more hw drops, they have restructured the class, lectures are 10x more organized and discussions aren’t all over the place."
