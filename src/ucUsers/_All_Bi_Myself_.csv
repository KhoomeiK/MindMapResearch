ucla,fpl0v8g,t1_fpl0mbv,1588704405.0,"My field requires a master's degree, and this is just my experience. I've also met other alumni and mentioned my friends' degrees, and they asked if my friends needed jobs. Just being a Bruin is a great networking tool if you're in the right field.

Also, GPA really doesn't matter unless you're trying to get into a competitive grad program. Experiences and networking are more important for getting a job."
ucla,fpkicxl,t3_gdq5zl,1588695226.0,"As an alumni, I can confirm the great connections you have just by being a Bruin. I'm getting my master's at another university right now, and I was offered jobs for when I graduate before I was even out of UCLA. People see the value of a UCLA degree and what kind of people are accepted here and complete their degree. Sure some professors may not be the best, and I know online learning sucks; I'm doing it too, but ""we the optimists"" is a UCLA catchphrase, and employers love us. It sucks right now, but it will get better, and I agree with OP's sentiment. Be proud to be a Bruin. It really does mean something."

Extension cords, a door stop, water filter/brita, ear plugs, and a cozy blanket. A good pillow is good too! Good luck!"

sugarlifestyleforum,fpb49xf,t1_fpb45h2,1588461798.0,"That's good to know. I'm still not fully comfortable with a lot of those, but I'll be sure to keep an open mind and reach out if I have questions. Thanks!"
sugarlifestyleforum,fpb3rkp,t1_fpb3ifq,1588461493.0,"Will do! I completely understand how uncommon it is and how much longer it will take me. I'm not comfortable with anything else, though, so I'll be pursuing a platonic arrangement. I don't think I'm getting my hopes up. I'm just happy to know that other platonic SD/SB relationships exist."
sugarlifestyleforum,fpb357a,t1_fpb2t8q,1588461123.0,"Even if her arrangement wasn't fully platonic doesn't mean they don't exist. The SDs who have shown interest in a platonic PPM relationship with me want company and someone to talk to. Once the world settles down, they want to go out for dinners and hikes and other things of the sort. I'm not saying it's common or I won't have to spend more time looking than I would if I were willing to involve sex, but I am saying it's possible and it would be nice if people weren't so quick to bash it."
sugarlifestyleforum,fpb1ziu,t3_gccvdz,1588460425.0,"I'm a platonic only SB who's still looking. This makes me relieved because most of my messages are people who either don't read my profile or want to know why I'm on the site/if I've had success. I've had a few people show some interest, but nothing has come of it yet. I'm glad others are open to the possibility."
sugarlifestyleforum,fp6pssy,t3_gbhvhu,1588356494.0,"I'm fairly new to sugaring, but I feel like once I finish my master's degree and get a job, I won't need help anymore. So far, I enjoy the connection I've made with the person I've been chatting with, but I'm also only looking for something platonic, so I haven't had much success yet."

endometriosis,fooxi4x,t1_foov0ot,1587948549.0,"I was on Orilissa for a year, and it was the least my pain has ever been. I did have the mood side effects which worsened my depression and some other issues, but in my case, the positives WAY outweighed the negatives. I'm glad other approaches worked for you, though!"
ucla,foihka1,t1_foihb7l,1587786818.0,"Linguistics isn't about learning languages. It's about learning about the function of language, the ways they differ, nuances of communication, etc. If you just want to learn a bunch of languages, I'd suggest taking language classes."

AmItheAsshole,fn45uei,t1_fn3gq3c,1586634665.0,"So endometriosis? PCOS? Adenomyosis? No matter which, YTA. I have endometriosis and adenomyosis, and they suck. Some days, I can be super active, but other days, I can't get out of bed from the pain. She's not faking it. Take it from someone who still resents her father 8 years after having the surgery to diagnose (the only way to get a diagnosis): if you keep telling her it's fake, you will lose your relationship with her."

ucla,fn0yxrk,t1_fn0knym,1586551478.0,"Or they can use their freedom of speech and the voting system to spread the word about how USAC really doesn't give a shit about the people they claim to represent, convince others to vote no on the referendum, and later vote you all out because you're corrupt and only in it for the stipends and resume boost."
ucla,fn0xfuj,t1_fmz9q3j,1586550637.0,"It may not be that much to you, but that's the difference between paying rent or eating dinner for some people. That's the difference between studying for finals or picking up extra shifts at work. That's the difference between being able to stay at UCLA and dropping out because they can't afford the cost. Just because it's ""not that much"" to you doesn't mean it doesn't significantly impact someone else's life."

ucla,fn0vweg,t1_fn0nczv,1586549774.0,"I've noticed that a lot of USAC people want to go into politics. Hopefully, if you're one of them, someone can connect you to these comments and show how little you actually care about other people. This is extremely telling that you people don't care about those you claim to represent. You just care about having power. Instead of copying and pasting the same vitriolic message to everyone, you should read the legitimate complaints and concerns and try to grow from them."
ucla,fn0v2xb,t1_fmxa99e,1586549313.0,"I'm an alum, and I remember trying to convince people to vote against increasing fees when I was there. It passed, and the wording made it really easy for USAC to raise fees again ""for the gym"" in the future without a revote. They're really sleazy and frustrating."

AskReddit,fmlj38h,t3_fvq49z,1586187416.0,"When I was a kid, I worked background for TV shows and movies. Jennifer Love Hewitt was probably the nicest celebrity I met in all of my experiences. She was really nice to me and all the other kids and people on set, she talked to us like regular people, and she took pictures with us without saying anything. She even gave the kid who was obsessed with the show who asked for like 7 autographs and 10 pictures everything he asked for and let him talk her ear off about the show she starred in that we were on for probably 20 minutes."

I want to get a tattoo before I die. I'm really scared of needles, but I have to have recurring surgeries, so I want to get a zipper tattoo around my scars."
