Games,fpj6l42,t1_fpit6cn,1588658099.0,"""Race shouldn't matter"" is something that's been used for decades to silence black people, despite the fact that race absolutely does matter. It matters because people don't start on a level playing field in the United States and the systems in place treat you differently depending on your economic status and race. When those things intersect, that difference in treatment is amplified. 

If white people make up the vast majority of people a given field, what reasons could there be? The biggest factors would be those that are systemic."

Look at the infection rates of other countries and compare them to ours. South Korea had their first cases right when we did and they have a fraction of the deaths that we do. Their leadership took decisive action, compared to ours who is advocating for the opening of our country before we've made it past the first wave.
