When this was an issue for me, as I began to come back into my relationship with God, I started using my Daily Bible App again. It sends me push notifications every morning for what they've selected the Daily Verse to be. 

From there, I usually choose to read that entire chapter that the Daily Verse comes from, a portion of that chapter, or you can read their Daily Plan, as well.

I use the app on Android. I do not know if it's available for iOS.

[Daily Bible App](https://www.mydailybible.org)Also, the app gives several options for versions of the bible you can read it in (ESV, NIV, KJV, etc)."

I found that same thing last night, only because I've already done the research and I've seen (via Glassdoor, Indeed, etc) what a web developer makes when they're starting out.

Also, I signed up for their free course and I literally had that thought like, 'I don't need to be coddled.  Just teach what you need to teach.'"

Christian,fmmzmuc,t1_fmmtszd,1586215153.0,"Just want to share this dream that I had last year on the night of August 7, 2019. I shared it the next day on my social media. 

I know that you have no reason to believe me, a total random stranger. But I'm sharing this to show one of the dreams that I had before we all knew how our lives would be turned upside down.

(Copied from the day I shared it)

Even in the midst of my sin, Jesus still reaches out to me. 😔🙏

**New Dream I had last night**

Last night I dreamt that I was in outer space, right outside of the earth. I looked off into the distance  and saw the moon. It immediately began to turn blood red. I gasped and thought, 'Its happening! Jesus is coming back!' 

Just as I had that thought, I heard a trumpet and then a man's voice, very authoritative, sounding as if he was commanding a group - it was Jesus commanding his army of angels. (I looked to my right, as I was still hovering in the air in outer space). And then they were LOUD because they were excited! You could hear the clanking of their armor, as they were also yelling in excitement! I couldn't see them, but somehow knew that this is who it was (Jesus & his angels). They were assembling, but I wasn't aware of them moving toward the earth just yet. 

Then suddenly I was back on earth and it was daytime but we could see the moon. It turned blood red and some guy (I think he was in a gang) was riding down the street with his friends. The car stopped, he got out & we both looked up at the moon. 

As it began to turn blood red, I gasped and shouted, 'Jesus is coming! Jesus is coming back!'

I looked down at the guy and he said, 'Naw! It's just another blood moon!'

I said nothing in response because suddenly I was aware of other people standing in the street with us. They witnessed all of this and believed him and not me. NO ONE believed me. So again, I said nothing else because I was in shock. I kept thinking, 'Why don't they believe me?'

End of the dream. 😔

**********************

You aren't alone. I've also connected with others via other social platforms who have dreams. We're in awe as we see some things that are beginning to happen, but not completely shocked. 

Please don't be discouraged by the false prophets. The bible tells us their reward. God bless you!!"

Also, as someone who used to enjoy sex, I've asked God to just take the desire away until I meet and marry the man he has for me.

I recently read something that said God doesn't take the desire away so that we can learn self-control. My thought was, 'But haven't I shown that I've conquered that?' 😂😭

Christian,fmm9tk7,t1_fmm7f51,1586201440.0,"Also, I'm hoping things get better by summer, but deep down I have a feeling it won't. I had a dream detailing so & shared it on my personal social media. Only my fellow believers & prophetic dreamers responded. 😒

For clarity, I had a dream of 3 tornados. Whenever I have dreamt about tornados in the past, it was God's way of showing me upcoming trouble. Number of tornados represent the number of situations. And the bigger and darker the tornado is in my dream, the worse the situation. 😔

I had a dream of these 3 tornados (regular looking, not dark, etc, but still tore some stuff up) coming one at a time. When I seen them and yelled to warn others, not everyone listened or followed me as I ran. 

I truly believe that 3 more things will happen before this is all over.

If my interpretation is wrong, I apologize. 😔🙏🙏🙏"
Christian,fmm8y2l,t1_fmm7f51,1586200985.0,"No need to apologize. I understand the frustration with clicking on a prophecy video on YouTube, only to realize about halfway through that something is a bit off! 😩 It's frustrating, disappointing, etc. 

Also, in my personal life, I think the only reason why some of the people on my social media believe me is that I shared my dreams as I had them, prior to recent events. It was like I couldn't really shake the dream until I shared it. I truly believe that when we get that feeling, God wants us to warn people so that no one can say, 'I didn't know.' 

When we share our dreams, as led by God, it may be the only way some people get a warning. 

God bless you."
Christian,fmm845n,t1_fmm728z,1586200545.0,"But it's kind of splitting hairs when its stated in that manner. We have technically failed to follow God's Word when we fornicate. However, with a sincere heart we can repent and not only ask God for forgiveness (which we have access to because of Jesus Christ), but we can ask Him to help us to refrain from doing so again. Those who want to be kept from sexual sin can be kept if they want to be kept. It might take some time, but lust, sexual immorality, etc, can be conquered (Zechariah 4:6, Phil. 4:13).

I am part of 'they'. Hence my 5 year journey in abstinence.

Is it hard at times? Very.

But again, those want to be kept...."

So if a woman like myself is upfront about the fact that I'm a mom (one kid), he was conceived out of wedlock but me & the dad haven't spoken for years (his choice), and I'm now trying to do things God's way (abstinence), its red flags for you???

Thank you for your response.

Christian,fmlqrz3,t1_fmkzq0f,1586191503.0,"Unfortunately, I had to try online dating due to the work schedule I had prior to Covid-19. That's where I'm encountering these guys. They literally list their religious status as Christian. 😒 I've mostly just chatted with most of them on the phone. Met 2 of them in person. Currently still talk to one of them on a daily basis. What do they both want? Sex. 😩 I feel like the guy that I'm still talking to on a daily basis is slowly ghosting me/pulling away. Kind of a shame because I really like him. For the past month he called me every morning and every night. Now that he realizes I'm standing firm in my abstinence, he still calls everyday but at random appropriate times & now it's only once a day. 😩 I hate it here....in this area of 'I'm trying to live right but hardly anyone else is'. 

But the way that I know Jesus has changed me and has called me to a different level in my life is that when I tried to think about compromising (at different times) with both guys, when it came down to it (I unfortunately put myself in situations where I had the opportunity), I couldn't do it. I was grossed out. Why? Because deep down I knew that this wouldn't be a man who had the same end goal in mind which is marriage. 

Where are the men who are seeking God's face and can go to war for me in the spirit if I need them to do so? 😩

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that most of us with the actual God-given gift of prophetic dreams either:

A) Don't post to social media because we don't want to deal with the group of people who would harass us, trying to use us as their personal 8 ball

Or...

B) When we do post our dreams on social media, we limit how much we do that because not all dreams need to be shared publicly. Also, when we do share, it's only a long post if the dream was long and/or God has given us the interpretation & we include it with the dream info.

Are there false prophets? Yes. That's why the Bible tells us to test the spirits.

But also please know that there are a number of us who started having end time dreams again in the past 2-3 years.
