Motocross,fnx6728,t1_fnwtnqg,1587332265.0,"You don’t need to get anything fast then. The KLX300R is a good bike for that. The CRF250F (not the race bike) is another good bike for this. Yamaha also makes some good bikes in the same category, but I can’t remember what they’re called. I’ll look into a bit more if you’re interested. Both of these bikes have manageable power, and are relatively cheap used. The engines are also very reliable, and you’d really only have to worry about the basics: oil changes, air filter, tires, chain and sprockets, etc."
