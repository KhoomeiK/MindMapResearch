Travis Knight showed how much better it could be without all that and focus on the small robot cast. And I know Transformers has LGTBQ stuff and I love that, but I‚Äôm scared that Disney would put them as the main characters (or brand new ones that are LGTBTQ) over characters like Optimus and Megatron and shitting on their graves because they were played by old white men. They already disrespected Luke Skywalker‚Äôs character horribly so it‚Äôs not like they are not known to do this.

But with Marvel, sure original cast wasn‚Äôt diverse, BUT we did get that diversity slowly and organically. It didn‚Äôt feel forced, which is the opposite of modern Disney now. And Captain Marvel was filled with SJW stuff in its marketing and Brie Larson constantly talking down to the fans and mainstream media saying that THIS is movie for women by bringing down men. Wonder Woman NEVER relied on bringing down men to make her look better (they had the opportunity with No Man‚Äôs Land, but I am so happy they chose not to say the obvious line) and we had a bunch of respected and loved female heroes already established in the MCU so claiming that that movie was monumental for women was just bullshit."

The Knight Optimus that only has smokestacks and gas tanks visible and honestly looks worse than the original knight optimus design that had more armor around him used in ROTDS.
