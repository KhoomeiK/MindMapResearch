Physics,fp4kqi3,t1_fp4jfkx,1588301193.0,"Ah, I see. I wonder if some of this failure is related to the framework with which we understand these things; whereas with classical objects we can draw useful analogies to our everyday experiences in order to have some visceral understanding of their properties, nothing in everyday life behaves like quantum phenomena. The only way that you can build a robust intuition about them is to learn lots of math and do lots of problems, and that intuition isn’t something that can be transferred to a layman in the same way that things like billiard ball analogies for gasses can.

I honestly don’t really have any solutions for this, but I agree that we really need to do a better job. It isn’t fair for us to expect extensive public funding to gather knowledge and then hide that knowledge behind a wall of math that requires years of experience to surmount, and I think outreach is something that physics, and particularly particle physics, needs to be more mindful of."
Physics,fp3wzxq,t1_fp3u0az,1588287377.0,"The honest answer is that nobody can really visualize these things; we don’t even know what the fundamental objects in QFT are (fields vs. particles vs. something even more abstract), and that’s not even getting started on whether or not these objects are actually fundamental or just emergent phenomena of some underlying theory.

Nobody knows what a photon “looks like” or what precisely it is, we just know that we have really great mathematical models that explain what we have observed.

For more on this idea, the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy has a pretty good summary of different interpretations of quantum field theory, and the merits/problems involved in each."

funny,fokoxym,t1_fokloen,1587846172.0,"Can we not act like people on the internet are the “true cause of racism” or whatever when institutional racism (exemplified by the justice system) is still ruining lives, largely due to colorblind ideology that prevents people from actually acknowledging or working on these issues"
leagueoflegends,foend9t,t1_foejrvi,1587708566.0,"Yeah that makes sense, a more useful number to talk about would be sample size used for each of the statistics that they’re reporting. I’ve still noticed strangely large discrepancies on things that one would think would be pretty high sample size though (I.e. flat champ win rates on common champs) so I would expect there still to be some systematics. 

I’m pretty much just speculating though, it would be really cool to see someone do some proper likeliness tests to see if there really are systematics or if it’s just a result of how many statistics are being reported by each site."
askscience,fn7d8da,t1_fn6y2ql,1586718034.0,Aren’t theories of quantum gravity expected to feature non-locality? I.e. holography?
AskReddit,fn6wh3h,t1_fn5micy,1586708703.0,"I think we’re pretty much in agreement. I wholeheartedly agree that we have some pretty amazing physical models that come very close to describing reality at the scales we can probe (I.e. not string theory), and we can be pretty certain that electrons exist, even if we’re not exactly sure what they are.

I just think it’s misleading for people to make metaphysical statements about what “actually exists” based on physics, when we have close to no idea what microscopic physics creates the emergent phenomena that we observe."
AskReddit,fn4mr6h,t1_fn3rcc9,1586644588.0,"A lot of people here are making definitive statements that make me a bit uncomfortable, so let me offer you a cop out answer: physics does not make claims about ontology, i.e. what exists, rather it attempts to model phenomena. Nobody can tell you if spacetime is something because that depends on 1) your definition of something and 2) knowledge about the nature of spacetime that we simply don’t have. 

In particular, this second point is tied up with considerations of quantum gravity; we don’t know if spacetime is some fundamental thing or some emergent phenomenon resulting from underlying dynamics. For example, consider string theory: in this scenario, our observed 4D spacetime would just be an artifact of our inability to see small extra dimensions.

Basically what I’m trying to get at is that you should take anyone giving you authoritative answers to this with a bucket of salt; we really don’t know what actually exists."
AskReddit,fn4lzgr,t1_fn49i7e,1586644135.0,In general any arbitrary region of space will have some nonzero electromagnetic fields which carry an associated energy density.
AskReddit,fn4ljru,t1_fn41qmi,1586643869.0,"This idea isn’t really “nothing” perse. It’s in close analogy to what happens when you supercool water: you can get water below it’s freezing point without it actually freezing if it is sufficiently pure and still, but when you give it something to “freeze around” the entire body of water rapidly turns to ice. In much the same way, our vacuum could be in a local energy minimum (like supercooled water), but then spontaneously fall to a lower energy vacuum due to a quantum fluctuation (like the water rapidly freezing when an impurity is introduced)."
news,fmte6eb,t1_fmt9x3z,1586371212.0,I think you're severely underestimating how many young people (like me) are going to begrudgingly vote for Biden. All the people I know in real life who voted for Bernie or Warren in the primary have verbally committed to voting for Biden in the general.
