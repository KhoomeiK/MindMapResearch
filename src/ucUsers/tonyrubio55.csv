UCSantaBarbara,fmfcvb1,t3_fuw1kk,1586024597.0,"I did my first 2 years at a community college for free, saved money then transferred to UCSB. My family is really low income for my EFC was always zero. Financial aid covered it 100% for me and savings were enough to cover food and rent for two years. Loved UCSB so much I stayed a Hurd year. I only took out a small loan to allow me to afford a nicer place to rent for my last year. Could’ve not taken the loan and lived with more roommates but yeah no regrets on that!"
