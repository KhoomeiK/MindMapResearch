berkeley,foiv9z0,t3_g7ghw3,1587798181.0,"hey -- just wanted to chime in with some mixed thoughts as a person who went to CC and transferred to Berkeley, just to sign up for a PhD here again. I love this place, but I don't know that given the choice of another well respected UC out of high school, I would have preferred to go the route I did.

I'm proud of what I managed to accomplish as a CC student, but it doesn't change that going to CC turned a four year degree into a six year degree (in my case as an engineering student with a list of transfer pre-req's a mile long, so YMMV). It also doesn't change that I missed out on the ""college experience"" living in dorms with other starry eyed underclassmen. 

Berkeley is a great academic environment, but if you have offers from other good schools, I would seriously consider taking them, because Berkeley is not the end-all-be-all, and should not be treated that way.

I also say this knowing that someone who is truly committed to the school will not be phased by this response. 

Go Bears!"

These fields focus a lot on well, filtering and processing signals with noise and using that filtered signal to deliver a meaningful control input to the system of interest."

Engineering seems to be one of the less effected professions in all this, and traditionally is relatively safe even in economic down times, but I would suggest keeping your job while looking for another, don't mention anything to your boss until you have an offer-in-hand from another company."
