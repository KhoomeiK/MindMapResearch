Maybe eventually leverage the experience for a better job."

AskReddit,fnuuyzo,t1_fnuqj5g,1587271780.0,"More like, imagine having spent a few months, abroad, in a class about cultural sensitivity with someone just to find out that they’re a bigot. It’s not as simple as not liking a word. It’s understanding the context of oppression, crime and hatred carried out against a group of people for the better part of 2 centuries. 

Also, being racially abused is one of the worst hurts in the real world. This is easy for most people to understand."
