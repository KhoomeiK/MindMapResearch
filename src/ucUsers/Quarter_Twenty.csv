Askpolitics,fpc8ln6,t1_fpc68dq,1588491339.0,"I’m confused. If funds to reduce poverty and provide nutritional support are bad, why did Republicans gleefully support sending a trillion dollars to many citizens now—the majority of whom aren’t in dire need. Was it just an opportunity to raid the treasury for their corporate donors? And if children really are important, why not support family leave? Every other nation on Earth has it? Why not support healthcare laws that don’t financially devistate families whose kids have ‘ pre-existing’ medical conditions. I can’t believe that the existence of the child is worth more than the welfare of the child."
Askpolitics,fpc5cax,t1_fpc2hig,1588488123.0,"Except that’s not all that matters. A 12 year old girl is raped by her father, or her uncle. I don’t care at all about the hypothetical child relative to how much I care about the very real little girl whose life will be shattered by the pregnancy. And even IF you come down with the conviction that human life must be protected from conception, the laws I mentioned still *restrict women* and humiliate them in times of great need, by forcing harmful state intervention into medical decisions where, I argue, they have no place. And you’re left with the contradiction that if life is so sacred, why are children so poorly prioritized politically in this country. There’s no guaranteed maternal paid leave, nutritional and educational support for the poor is abysmal in many states. I don’t think it’s actually about protecting children at all. I believe it’s a religious fundamentalist subjugation of women at the heart of all the ‘protect the innocent’ rhetoric, and I say that from the facts of how living, breathing people are treated, by law and by society."

There are plenty of counter-examples to this, in the way that conservative lawmakers behave when they are in power. Recent Virginia laws *almost* enacted that force women to undergo a vaginal ultrasound when there is no medical justification for it would have been traumatizing both for the women and the physicians who attend to them. [See here.](https://thinkprogress.org/how-republicans-quietly-mandate-transvaginal-probes-when-they-think-no-ones-paying-attention-c7a80beecda/) Laws imposting [mandatory waiting periods](https://www.aclu.org/other/government-mandated-delays-abortion) in states with only one or a few available clinics disproportionally affect poor women, and serve no benefit to the women. Laws that [do not allow abortion in cases of rape and incest](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/opinion/abortion-rape-incest-exception.html) are incredibly cruel to the affected women--in my view, almost like the worst aspects of Sharia laws in their harshness. And finally, laws that [criminalize abortion](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/14/abortion-bill-alabama-passes-ban-six-weeks-us-no-exemptions-vote-latest) (for the doctors) when it is required for the life or health of the mother take the power away from women and their medical advisors, and give it to the state, which is just about the anathema of Conservative views in most other scenarios.

I argue that while the stated intention is protecting fetuses from harm, all of the above cases ""restrict women"" unequivocally, by disallowing them making choices about their own lives, health, and well-being."

One only had to scratch the surface to see that his character then and now was and is the same as it has always been. During the campaign, all he had to do was tell people that everything being done now was stupid and wrong, and he alone had all the answers. It almost didn't matter what the question was, the was his response. Then, in office, he began systematically dismantling everything Obama had built in 8 years, from the inside out. So I would argue that he has governed just like he campaigned--as a destroyer and not a builder."

Askpolitics,fny6qf1,t1_fnwk4sm,1587354774.0,"as u/ringopendragon says, so-called ""Grass Roots"" campaigns and movements grow organically, from affected and interested people. ""Astroturf"" is how we label fake grass-roots campaigns. For example, when a company or a political party surreptitiously mobilizes people and attempts to make it appear as a natural movement. In some cases, they may be paying influencers and notable people to act in certain ways, write editorials, organize protests, etc. When in reality it serves some hidden interest, and done not initially come from affected people. It's powerful because our representatives feel that they are answerable to the people, their constituents. So, if they are led to believe that hundreds or thousands of people they represent are motivated enough to speak out and act in support or in opposition to something, they take it seriously.

As we know, there are plenty of astroturf campaigns going on, including on social media.

AskReddit,fnxj5kk,t3_g487l2,1587339723.0,"We have it in Berkeley, California, and it's working very well since 2015. We voted for it, fighting a huge campaign against the tax. A few years in, it's [been reported](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/soda-tax-50-drop-sugary-drink-consumption-berkeley/story?id=61210940): ""The study found that between 2014 and 2017, the consumption of sugary drinks dropped by 52 percent. During the same time period, water consumption rose by 29 percent, according to the study. By comparison, there were no significant changes in sugary beverage consumption in the two cities closest to Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco.""

I would say that the biggest factor here was the awareness that sugary drinks are bad for people, and especially bad for kids. People here care about their health, and the consumption of sugary drinks fell precipitously. I'm certain it was the awareness element more than the tiny additional cost."

Askpolitics,fnic72b,t1_fnhl9wb,1586977526.0,"I see your point. However, in an Electoral College system, no matter how many people vote for a given candidate, if the total within a state is below 50%, then none of those votes count toward the selection of the president. Third party votes and even second-place votes are essentially irrelevant unless and until they reach 50% of votes cast. Reasonably, if you know your presidential candidate of choice will receive a low vote total, and you nonetheless vote for that candidate (as is your prerogative and right), then you are essentially ceding the selection to the votes cast by other people. You've technically removed yourself from having any influence on power. What's more, if the race is projected to be close, then voting for a 3rd party candidate is equivalent to letting other people decide, and agreeing to abide by their decision, rather than choosing a candidate who you may not prefer, but is more closely aligned with your views."
