ucla,fpmfap3,t3_geb438,1588731816.0,"Of all the major test prep companies I've seen reviews from, Kaplan seems to get the most poor ratings. I think most people will agree that MCAT courses are not worth their price and should only be done if you can quite comfortably drop a couple thousand dollars. Additionally, the tutors at some companies are mandated to push the ""Kaplan/Princeton/ExamKrackers way"" and their own materials which can be detrimental."
ucla,fpi4vmx,t1_fphxdhh,1588633707.0,"I think the major point of contention is that while people may personally be okay with paying the fee, they may not feel comfortable with imposing that fee on others. People supporting the referendum, including candidates, are saying that students receiving financial aid will not have to pay at all, but Orion (who has said on record that he would vote no on the referendum as a private student and not a councilor) says that is not true. Regardless of which statement is correct, the discrepancy puts into question the potential burden on lower income students. Additionally, students have grown mistrustful of student government and administration over how money have been managed in recent years, so students have been more critical when it comes to giving more money to a body they don't trust. I will say though that some individuals in this community have crossed the line from being critical to proposing borderline conspiracy theories and just being hateful.

As an alumni who has no vote to give, it seems that many supporters and opponents cannot understand that a person can simultaneously care about a BRC and student fees. It's a difficult choice either way. Supporting a BRC isn't saying you don't care about student fees at all, and opposing student fees isn't saying that you don't think a BRC is a good idea. Unfortunately, it's a no-win scenario, and I wish the electorate would acknowledge that people have nuanced opinions and can't be painted as good or evil based on how they vote for this particular issue. This goes for both supporters and opponents. It's very difficult to have proper discourse until this is strongly embraced by the majority. I've seen cases where individuals would acknowledge the nuance but would quickly resort back to name calling.

Personally, I think it's incredibly sad that some people are explicitly being single-issue voters by deciding on candidates based on how the candidates will personally vote on CUB. The incoming council has no role in managing CUB funds if passed, and they have no role in proposing future referendums. Students already pay hundreds of dollars to USAC, so it's in their best interest to actually read about the platforms they are voting to bring into existence rather than using a candidate's opinion on CUB or one's slate affiliation to paint the entire picture."
ucla,fphpyuu,t3_gd6jon,1588625675.0,"I agree that it would be good to have more South campus representation on council, but I disagree with the notion that platforms have been partisan (I feel like this isn't the right word to describe North v South campus but I can't think of another one) or that future South campus candidates should run on platforms focusing on South campus in response. 

To elaborate on my disagreement, I don't see how ""the quality of dining hall ingredients, elevator speeds and lightly used shuttle buses"" are South campus causes. The only project I can think of that is partisan is his improvement of the Boelter signs. Even then, it's not like North campus majors never use Boelter because they have to take science GE's, and likewise for South campus majors and Bunche/Rolfe/PubAff, etc. It's a building in South campus for sure, but they don't belong to any specific group of students. To me, it's clear that Orion is a South campus guy advocating for what he views as campus issues, more so than him being a guy tackling problems specifically pertaining to South campus majors. 

Similarly, I don't see how helping students participate in an organization that [makes policy for undergraduate education at UCLA](https://www.senate.ucla.edu/committee/ugc) is a North campus cause. After all, one would hope that both North and South campus majors are invested in our undergraduate education, including the approval of new majors, minors, and courses. Being a physician, engineer, or a researcher in academia does not preclude one from participating in policy making and discussions during one's career, and some would find this opportunity to gain experience in this field to be invaluable. The head of the undergraduate council is literally a neuroscientist. 

I think the largest barrier for South campus majors participating in council is time. North campus curricula are notorious for being significantly shorter, and graduating in 3 years quite common. For example, political science requires only 5 lower division courses in no predetermined order and 10 upper division courses. North campus majors find it easier to sit on council because they can take the minimum amount of units and still graduate on time. Comparatively, graduating early from South campus is much harder because many classes have to be taken in sequence (e.g. you have to be at the end of the math series to even start the physics series). It's difficult to justify sitting on council for minimum wage if you put your grades or prompt graduation at risk. At the same time, student government includes the office staff and not just council members, and I'd be willing to bet that you'll find more fair South campus representation there because the responsibilities are delegated with the understanding that they are volunteers. There are absolutely South campus majors who are interested in ""woke"" causes, as evidenced by the fact that Orion is not the only council member from South campus."
ucla,fpfnqzt,t1_fpfh32k,1588577106.0,"I was actually looking into this last night. The tl;dr answer to your question is that no accusing body has brought forth evidence to the public view. 

However, Matthew Richard in a Facebook post (I'm not going to link it, but his FB posts are public, this specific one is in October 2019) denies the allegations, but he also provides his own correspondences which he believes to be the evidence used to support the claims. This includes a few tweets to a former USAC president affiliated with Bruins United where he rags on her and another Bruins United council member for posing for photos in the Golan Heights and for ""how you have used war crimes as an instagram aesthetic"" (literal quote). If it's not clear, Matthew is strongly in the Palestinian camp of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and Bruins United has historically been heavily influenced by Jewish organizations and has had several Jewish candidates during every campaign. He also addresses the other allegations in the post.

With that being said, the public does not know whether the information he provides is actually related to the alleged misconduct, so to some the information is vindicating and to others it is damning."

[p15 4e. Student Fee Adjustment Measures require a minimum 20% voter turnout
in order to be effective.
](https://96b7a0d8-9741-4cad-9213-4f1e4396c386.filesusr.com/ugd/85d9e4_9e7d9a2767b044879f93f819a5287c83.pdf)

I'm not sure if I'm interpreting your concern correctly here, but it has never been the case that 20% of voters saying yes would make a referendum pass. 20% of the total undergraduate body at minimum needs to vote, and then if 50 % + 1 of that number votes yes then it passes. The change in the threshold I'm assuming is because lower voter turnout is expected from lack of campaigning (harassment/literally taking your phone and voting for you) on Bruin Walk. You have daddy Gene to blame for that as mentioned above.

Interestingly enough, last year's voter turnout was [16.18%](https://dailybruin.com/2019/05/07/usac-sees-lowest-voter-turnout-in-over-a-decade-cites-publicity-issues/) which would have automatically disqualified this referendum if it were ran then. It's also worth noting that in 2016, when we had the last referendums which raised fees by more than the current ones, the turnout was [40.3%](https://dailybruin.com/2016/05/09/voter-turnout-improves-despite-lowered-usac-election-board-budget/). 

Because there are two referendums on the ballot this year with a lot of people being pretty invested for or against it, I have some doubts about voter turnout being as abysmally low as last year to the point where the referendums would not pass because of poor voter turnout. Lastly, as an alumni who is only tuning in to keep up with the drama, I think the referendums at minimum should have the chance of passing (so I support lowering thresholds) and it's important no matter how you feel to actually vote on it."
ucla,fntd6zq,t3_g3qwtt,1587239301.0,"I believe the basic ballot language that is used is generally objective. Here's an example of the language of the [Social Justice Referendum](https://usac.ucla.edu/documents/docs/ref16.pdf) which, from what I recall, had significant council member support when I was an undergrad. Here's an additional example of the [GCGP referenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19KOR2q03YKOoZaJD6fVDrDiC_Lw_wEgT7aeIPG5PTnI/edit) which was recently posted. Given the precedent set by SJR (which was a larger fee increase than CUB I might add), I doubt the election board would allow the referendum on the ballot if it didn't display any fees. You can look through all the [past referenda](https://usac.ucla.edu/documents/misc/) if there's any concern for masking fees.

I believe supplemental ballot language is also provided, but I don't recall whether I saw it or not the last time I voted. Here's what the [entire SJR referendum including the supplement looked like](https://wspucla.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/646d5-social-justice-referendum-of-2016-final.pdf). From what is in the supplemental ballot of SJR and what was written in GCGP's supplemental statement, it seems that the referendum writers are allowed to use them to give reasoning behind specific fees within the breakdown, but it does not seem like counterpoints are solicited by the election board."

I agree that it's generally an unpleasant place to live, and I would also add that the place was extremely dark all the time.

premed,fmcv07w,t1_fmcees5,1585953382.0,"The fact is that if someone were looking for a video with advice for a non-traditional background, we would be looking at something way longer than 8 minutes. What a non-traditional applicant needs to round out their application is highly specific to their individual profile and story. It can't be generalized in a short video. He can't make a video about what a 25 year old Navy veteran or a 40 year old single mom/former entrepreneur should do and expect to have an audience.

I watched the video. There's no implication that the process is easy. His main message is that the process is made more difficult than it should be because of a lack of consistent and accurate information. 

As far as matriculating students go, he's no superstar. [You can look at the data yourself](https://www.aamc.org/system/files/2019-10/2019_FACTS_Table_A-16.pdf), but his MCAT is at the mean of matriculating students and his GPA is within one standard deviation of the mean. His ECs were not [mindblowing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/ft3i8q/current_m1_who_was_a_orm_accepted_to_6_medical/fm8vhld/) The [schools that accepted him](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/ft3i8q/current_m1_who_was_a_orm_accepted_to_6_medical/fm5bkns/) are not considered to be [top tier institutions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/fke15w/complete_ranking_of_medical_schools_md_do_by/)

He might be better off than the average applicant, but the quality of the average applicant is brought down outliers who are hurt by a lack of consistent and accurate information. When you have people applying with an MCAT in the 490's, people applying with zero clinical hours, people applying to the entire T20 just to shoot their shot, and people applying to schools that take <10% OOS students, this is an indication of the unavailability of decent advising. For those browsing this community regularly, the advice may seem one-dimensional, but for non-Reddit users this information might actually be new and insightful."
