evolution,fpao2h7,t1_fp916t8,1588452156.0,"Thank you for the super specific answer!! In particular the examples of recent speciation events and the recommendation of that book, I'll look into both, along with mess around on Wikipedia. Its cool to know there is a group out there for plants, now Ill have to scour the web for one for mammals! I'm about a year off from when I plan to take an actual upper div in evolution/zoology but its just so interesting that I cant wait. Its just so fascinating that there's so much debate in this area, from definitions to all the species concepts. 

Thanks again for answering my questions even though you had to retype everything!!"
evolution,fp8bmy0,t1_fp8ahd0,1588388299.0,"Thank you for such a thorough answer!! This is all so fascinating. I guess the papers I was reading were just trying to shift the scientific consensus? A wild west of taxonomy!

It feels like there *should* be some formal body controlling this but I guess im not surprised there isnt."

Coronavirus,foxa1tt,t1_fox5hhx,1588137936.0,"It looks like this case she def got a lower standard of care due to racism/sexism, since they dismissed her initially as having a ""panic attack"". Vitamin D likely contributed, but its clear in this case racism directly impacted her outcomes."

That being said, don't worry about graduating summer session. I've heard that usually you can walk early (ie with Spring graduates) if you talk to your advisor (just heresay thou)"
unpopularopinion,fnrnzz9,t1_fnrnhg4,1587195253.0,"True, ethics are not laws. A lot of this stuff is very fuzzy! I think some of the difference (to me) is that generally you make the decision to drink primarily as an individual (or with peers) whereas sex requires two people, one of whom in this case is more likely to be mature. Its why sex between two teens isnt that big a deal to me either -- a more equal playing field. 

I think if we could actually do a maturity test, then yeah, the ages would be fairly meaningless. However as an ethical conundrum (i think) this is impossible -- I cant imagine a way to assess it accurately. I also think the ethical ""problem"" of having to wait like, 1 year to have sex is not big. Then again I dont understand adults who develop interest in teens, life stages seem too different to me."
unpopularopinion,fnrkmwg,t1_fnrge5h,1587191984.0,"As someone who's 19 currently, and still remembers being 17 -- I think any adult would have been taking advantage at that age. I was not an adult. I still refered to myself as a child at 18. I did not think the same as I do now. More importantly though: **Obviously ages != maturity but legally we have to have something we can measure (age) and cutoff (18).** Adults in general have more ""power"" and, what do you think the cutoff should be? are the majority people magically capable of consenting to sex with grown ass adults at 16? 14? 12?"

Instead, she made changes about where she sourced the meat from (not factory farmed) and in the frequency she ate meat (probably every other day? she's not specific about it.) I don't really know the biochemical stuff -- I have no trouble being full veg -- but do whats best for you. Going cold turkey when it causes you harm is ridiculous."

Classes open, though lots of them are labs, and only 33 are below 100. That would keep you at 13 credits!~~ nevermind, you need a permission code. Still possible, just contact advising as per comment below.

A good option might also ve emailing your professors. Idk your situation, but a lot of profs are being understanding this quarter.

Yeah, they likely used similar swabs and took up some ppe, but the actual test was different. Certainly worth it for learning that human-cat transmission is possible, no matter the cost though.

Edit: and to clarify, when I said equipment I meant that they were tested in a vet lab, which equipment that is probably the same but earmarked for a different purpose and unlikely to ever see human samples. Rereading what I wrote that isn't clear at all, oops."
