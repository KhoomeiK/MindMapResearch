Philippines,fpintr5,t1_fping36,1588644810.0,Lmao. Go ahead if you want to
Philippines,fpifywz,t1_fpifjt7,1588640112.0,Indeed. I was being passive aggressive. I could see how my phrasing could attract heated response. Thanks for pointing that out
Philippines,fpif7zt,t1_fpiaubb,1588639680.0,Your political distaste of Duterte is making you highly emotional. I simply asked a question to gain more insight as to what‚Äôs happening in the Philippines. No intended malice behind what I asked. But feel free to choose however you want to interpret my question (:
Philippines,fpietat,t1_fpibw9a,1588639442.0,"This would be my first time dipping my feet into politics. Also, I‚Äôd rather let the people do the researching for me as of now (like how you did all the work for me) and know their opinions so I can later research their validity."
Philippines,fpi6he1,t1_fpi5s3k,1588634625.0,Found none. Linking one would probably be more helpful rather than downvoting a question.
intj,fphknga,t1_fpg4zy8,1588622953.0,Just start off saying ‚ÄúHey I want to be honest with you. I really like you as a friend. I thought you‚Äôre XYZ [insert complement and how you guys connected and/or how you feel or miss her]. Then end with saying let‚Äôs hangout when the quarantine is over. And ask her what do you think? (We like to be asked about what we think a lot)‚Äù
intj,fpcw1n8,t3_fyxzow,1588514197.0,Converse with me
entp,fpcj3ke,t1_fc89jgq,1588502434.0,"Were you guys both straight before you met? Because I fell for an ENTP girl, but cut ties because I knew she was straight despite the strong electric attraction we both had for each other"

UCSD,fpbxlxu,t3_gcghg8,1588481413.0,I like attack on titans too
intj,fp9yhfs,t1_fp9w5t7,1588437177.0,"We didn‚Äôt become a thing because I chickened out lol. Yes, I think so but I‚Äôm basing it on my experience with this particular ENTP. I ignored her too for many reasons, one because I wanted her to initiate. It‚Äôs kind of like testing. Will she go out of her way to ask me to hangout? Will she text me first? Etc... I think it‚Äôs because I wanted to make sure that she reallyyyyyy wanted to hangout with me lol. (I was immature back then btw and socially retarted so if she is like what I was I‚Äôd suggest be patient lol). But, I really do think you should just ask her straight up to hangout with her. It would probably save her a lot of anxiety... if I‚Äôm correct about my assumptions


Edit: oh fuck I almost forgot! Hahaha I ignored her too because I didn‚Äôt want to give away that I liked her so much üòÇ"
intj,fp9vcvl,t3_fta5tq,1588435332.0,"This happened to me with an ENTP, but the only difference is I fell for her (oops). I guarantee that she wants to hangout with you too, but doesn‚Äôt know how to initiate. Just straight up ask her to hangout. Seriously"

entp,fp1q0vg,t1_fp1pfhk,1588244153.0,"That person could honestly sound like me. I‚Äôd like to try dating an ENTP, but I could be very insecure. Idk why, but I always feel vulnerable when I get too close with ENTPs. It makes me scared, uncomfortable and insecure as I‚Äôm not used to it. I wonder if it‚Äôs an ‚ÄúINTJ thing‚Äù."
