personalfinance,fnmkbyf,t3_fhrfqo,1587072983.0,"I am in college but might not go back if we are continuing to do ""remote education"" through the fall term. I signed a lease this winter for a house with my friends frome june 2020 - june 2021 and paid the security deposit, but now might not be able to live there at all. What steps should I take to see if I have the option to break the lease, even if for a fee?"
UCSantaBarbara,fnjrpi5,t3_g1zlkb,1587005443.0,you need to get an add code from the professor which is going to be really hard to get at this point
UCSantaBarbara,fngaix7,t1_fng82tl,1586926518.0,well it looks like im going to be taking at least 2 and usually 3 upper divs per quarter :S. do you have any recommendations for managing it?
cscareerquestions,fn9lir4,t1_fn9kfzp,1586777483.0,"thanks, this is awesome advice. I appreciate your perspective on how the real world works, definitely refreshing. I was deciding between getting a B.S. in math or, statistics and data science -- do you have any ideas on which one would be more employable if I was aiming to gain work experience with coding after undergrad?"
cscareerquestions,fn9f7mr,t1_fn9ezki,1586770653.0,"Thats good to hear! the main problem for is that it seems impossible for me to get a bachelors degree at this point because I cant transfer into it at my current school, and i am pretty certain i do not have a high enough gpa to transfer to another school's cs program..."
UCSantaBarbara,fn7m2qg,t1_fn726f7,1586723046.0,"what did you use to end up teaching yourself? books, khan academy?"
college,fn7lzi8,t1_fn6chqz,1586722994.0,"appreciate your help! do you think majoring in stats and geography would be redundant or useful? I wouldn't have to take an extra year if i did, so I could graduate in the same amount of time"
UCSantaBarbara,fn7lt66,t1_fn6vq4v,1586722894.0,"Thanks for your advice - i was looking into Earth science and it seems interesting, but do you know anything about the differences between that and Geography?"
college,fn63544,t1_fn61b3b,1586685562.0,"I would if I could, but transferring into the college of engineering at my school requires like a 3.8 gpa and even then its super unlikely."
college,fn6341y,t1_fn61m94,1586685530.0,"Thanks for the advice. I've read a lot about stats bachelors degrees not being very useful without continuing on to grad school, is that not true?"
