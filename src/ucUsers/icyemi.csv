AmItheAsshole,fo1qxsa,t1_fo1q5zh,1587439424.0,"His introduction was word for word copied from the first study he cited. Although it’s a different experiment performed, the topic was the same and fit very well with his paper."
AmItheAsshole,fo1pml0,t1_fo1pap3,1587438556.0,"Yes. He listed the work in the references section and included in-text citations at various points in his paper, as well as citations from other studies that I didn’t look at."

AmItheAsshole,fo1p877,t1_fo1ncao,1587438298.0,"No exactly, and I don’t want that to happen when he’s apparently dealing with a lot"
AmItheAsshole,fo1p5bf,t1_fo1nbhm,1587438246.0,"I did, so he wouldn’t even be able to appeal to the TA for a better grade, but I’m not sure if only he can see my comments or if the professor/TA can access it. While the scores from the peer reviews are out, the final grades for the assignment haven’t been posted but apparently they’re gonna be based on the peer scores."
AmItheAsshole,fo1olo0,t1_fo1n3wv,1587437895.0,"Yeah that’s my stance right now, but he and a couple others in the groupchat are arguing that everyone should be even more generous with points because there’s no way of telling if the author had a rough time :/"
AmItheAsshole,fo1ogdl,t1_fo1n3k3,1587437800.0,I doubt that HAHA if they’re idiots then I’ve transcended to the rank of Clown! I just happened to really like his topic and happened to read one of the papers he cited. If I had a little less time or was a little less engaged then I wouldn’t have caught it either and this all would’ve been avoided :(
AmItheAsshole,fo1o1xa,t1_fo1mzpj,1587437540.0,He cited the study :( that’s how I found it in the first place! The problem is that his intro (from what I read) was word for word from the other study. We also use an online database to check for a percentage plagiarized but his showed up as 0% so I don’t think it’s very accurate.
