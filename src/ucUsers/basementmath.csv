Unemployment,fobqbj5,t1_fobflvi,1587662505.0,Thank you. I'll give it a shot. This is such a hassle :(
Unemployment,fo8pulm,t3_g66wgo,1587601393.0,"Question: So even if my mom's EDD UI claim gets processed late, she will get the whatever amount she should've gotten from the date of unemployment correct?"
csMajors,fno8s4b,t3_g2o47o,1587116409.0,"I went back to school when I was 28. I transferred at 30 then I switched major from math/econ to math/cs. I am 33 and I am struggling sometimes but I am getting through. I even got an internship(easy interviews, no whiteboard) and I am going for another one. I feel I am not learning as fast as I want and feel lost and overwhelmed sometimes but I am getting through."
cscareerquestions,fndpz5f,t3_g10u6k,1586875267.0,"I took Hackerrank for Roblox. I got 100% on 2 out of 3, time limit exceeded on half of test cases for the last problem and got 50%, so 1+1+0.5 out of 3. What are the likelihood of getting an interview?"
UCSD,fmrivhy,t3_fwturh,1586324553.0,The second cut is literally me
cscareerquestions,fmo3xbu,t1_fmnxeah,1586244477.0,"Awww... Thank you, I wanted to also go into math at the same time but I ended up leveraging more into CS. It was a sequence of classes I took. Passed the first with C-, which put a dent to my GPA, then failed the next course in the sequence, which basically sunk my GPA. I tried I guess. But I also realized, I can study math on my own as a hobby, which I plan to do and focus on CS/interviews/projects etc."
cscareerquestions,fmn76es,t1_fmmsta5,1586219639.0,"Yeah, I am below 3.0 (because I stupidly decided to take a hard pure math class and failed it) and I have one easy internship. It's difficult.... :(("
cscareerquestions,fmn6rlo,t3_fw6lvl,1586219386.0,"Thank you for posting. I had an easy no whiteboard interview internship last year that got me some confidence and experience. However, for this year, I failed 8 interviews out of 9 I had (one offered, 25/hr full time but declined back in February because I wasn't going to learn anything new) and failing 9 out of 14 code challenges online. I have done 100 leetcode problems, I have done some group projects but not a whole lot of projects in general. I am working on my fundamentals because I am barely keeping up with school work + preparing for interviews, not because I am lazy. Congratulations on your offer. I do not have an offer yet but I won't give up until it's over."
csMajors,fmkppyy,t1_fmkm3ue,1586163767.0,Oh no :((
csMajors,fmjbdij,t1_fmjb3jk,1586126857.0,"No  no, sorry for acting needy/feeling anxious, it's not you. It's the way I feel about it. Thank you :')"
