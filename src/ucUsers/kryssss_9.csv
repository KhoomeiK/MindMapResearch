ucr,fpajn1w,t1_fpajaop,1588449539.0,"if we were to visit, do you know where we could park like on campus? or would we be better off parking on the streets?"

ucr,fp3p0iw,t1_fp1ba7d,1588283204.0,they have a website with a list of the clubs there! highlanderlink.ucr.edu
ucr,fozpstu,t3_gahg4q,1588194748.0,"The 28k is more of an estimate! Online they include fees such as books, and transportation into the total cost. So unless you’ll be paying rent, you’ll only be paying tuition&fees and the one time document and highlander orientation fee towards the school!"

ucr,fo5htfh,t3_g5s00j,1587525986.0,is the major you switched to impacted? i got in for my alternate (undeclared) and wanted to try and see if i could get into psych (the major i applied for)? i’m assuming i’ll get denied since i wasn’t accepted into that major the first time around
