UCSD,fp5c427,t3_gb8r9g,1588323810.0,honestly is it bad that I’m wishing I could move back to San Diego instead of being at home just so I can focus on my work :(
UCSD,fosb8fa,t3_g8dl3f,1588027341.0,"I had Brydges first quarter, as well as now. I honestly feel like she changed her quizzing style from the first quarter, but how I’ve been keeping up so far is literally doing EVERYTHING she gives us. Like watching and paying attention to all the prelectures, going to the live Q&A, and doing the weekly worksheets. I feel like the worksheets are really good at summing everything up, but what I noticed from the last quiz is that she mostly pulls questions from her slides, like with the describing the picture question and the titration question."
UCSD,fnvgksb,t3_g2rpqr,1587292517.0,taking it with Odom and the class is so disorganized that I always feel like I’m missing a deadline :(
UCSD,fnvg92o,t3_g2whqo,1587292169.0,"message the department on vac to ask! I messaged them about physics 1al since both sections have over 30 people on the waitlist. They sent me a link to their physics page that says for summer session, they’re opening up new sections every time the waitlist goes over 15 people so I’m just waiting for them to post those new sections now"

relationship_advice,fmpnbad,t3_fwpifn,1586283883.0,"i can’t say anything for other guys, but speaking for my boyfriend, he definitely does not reuse his boxers after cleaning up. my BF normally uses paper towels or at least washes whatever cloth he used to clean up after himself. 

I would ask your BF to use a different alternative, like using paper towels or something because as a fellow clean freak, the idea of my boyfriend wearing boxers that he jizzed in is not pleasant at all."
UCSD,fmhh2ib,t1_fmh3dq5,1586079829.0,"hi! I’m a premed student right now in my first year at UCSD and I’ve been looking into this rumor as well. I found that by looking at the demographics for UCSD med school, they do accept a large amount of UCSD undergrad students compared to students from other colleges. for 2019, the most accepted came from ucla, but Ucsd had the second most acceptances. of course they don’t say anything explicitly, but you can check these posted statistical profiles on their website to see the trends in acceptances."
