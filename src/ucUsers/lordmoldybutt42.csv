Yugioh101,fnmxpzo,t3_g2medj,1587080212.0,"For example, you have A card like blackwing gale the whirldwind. That card say:

 If you [control](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Control) a ""[Blackwing](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Blackwing)"" [monster](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Card) other than ""Blackwing - Gale the Whirlwind"", you can [Special Summon](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Special_Summon) this card (from your [hand](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Hand)).  

If you have another blackwing, lets say bora the spear. You can just place gale the whirldwind in the field from your hand, thats a special summon, because the card tells you to do it.

&#x200B;

Now if you use a card like polymorization, it tells you to use two monster to fusion summon a fusion monster from your extra deck. You pick the fusion monster (one that meets the requirements, for example you used dark magician and buster blader) and you fusion (special) summon to the field."

AmItheAsshole,fnirzcb,t3_g1u1ij,1586985328.0,"I'm going to say YTA, only because you shouldn't get into other people's ""traditions"". I come from a mom who's parents had this ""tradition"" (I'm just going to call it a mentality from now on because it shouldn't be a tradition.) back in the day. They are big family and while the guys did stuff outside, the women would cook. When it was time to eat they would serve the food and be attentive to the guys needs in the table and then they (the women) would eat.

When we have family over and it's a big gathering this mentality will still show up and it doesn't matter how much we tell them to come and sit with us so we can eat together, they don't do it and instead sit down after someone leaves the table.


The only reason I'm calling you an asshole is because they have this way of thinking that can be called ""tradition"" and you shouldn't force them out of it if they have been doing it all their lives. It's not hurting anyone but it still sucks.

And I will continue to tell my family (here's the emphasis of family) to sit down and eat at the same time. I even leave the table and eat on a different table so they don't have an excuse to say no.

I also dated women where their family had values, traditions, mentality of things I didn't agree with but I never stuck my nose in it.
     Once again if it's not hurting anyone then there's no reason for me to try and change things, just so that I can be more comfortable.
     The second reason is because I wouldn't want anyone sticking their nose in my wife's and my business, so I won't stick my nose in theirs.

Now if you have them visit your house you set your rules and they should follow. It works both ways."
