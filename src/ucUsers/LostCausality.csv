amateurradio,foch08j,t3_g6q8y5,1587671231.0,"I didn’t read your whole post, but I did something very similar to understand APRS / ax.25 / afsk.

Here are important things to remember:

1. The AFSK is non-return to zero encoded (NRZI). So 0 is encoded as a change in tone, and a 1 is encoded as no change in tone

2. The bits will be stuffed, ie and string of 5 1’s will have a 0 inserted after it. This does not apply to frames (01111110)

3. Once you do the nrzi decoding and unstuff the bits, the bytes in the frame / packet are in Least Significant Bit order (LSB). This means an ASCII “A” which would be “01000001” will actually appear as “10000010” in the raw packet data.

Understanding these things helped me a lot with building software to encode and decode APRS packets."

Basically I have had no issues with them. I looked a bunch of their properties before finding one that suited me. They vary a lot in quality so look multiple of them. 
The management has been nice and accommodating, and maintenance is fast. No real complaint, and overall a positive living experience so far (about a year now)

Now obviously you can read about the owner’s (still current owner??) history and make a judgment based on that, but that’s for you to figure out on your own. From a pure property point of view I have no issues with the place, or the management of the property."
berkeley,fo1kp69,t3_g56h05,1587435396.0,"Lmao imagine getting kicked out of Berkeley because you copied homework. It’s pretty crazy, and I’m sure you’ll get people in here that will defend all this as something good, and maybe they are right. It’s just funny that they don’t think people would do this, especially given the circumstances. To me cheating on hw is sooooooo much more mild than a test, yet this course staff seems to think they are on par with each other... just a difference of opinion, but one that is causing me a lot of grief rn."
