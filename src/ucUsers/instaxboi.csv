Watches,fpgyq5b,t1_fpfu6nm,1588611887.0,"valid points, but at ~$200 I think it's worth it just for the smooth sweep and clean look. I have mine paired with a stitched brown leather strap and it's beautiful."

I used to hate having people in my photos but I've changed my mind."

Watches,fognrzn,t3_g7e766,1587754897.0,An anniversary gift from my girlfriend! This is quickly becoming my favorite watch from the collection. I'm not sure why but one day I got the sudden urge to look up Snoopy watches and I found this one and the Peanuts x Timex Marlin series. I'm not even a big Peanuts fan but the characters are so charming. I ended up ordering the Charlie Brown flying a kite Marlin (should be here soon!) and my girlfriend bought me this one to compliment it. Switched out the nato strap (not the best quality) for a red stitched leather band from Amazon I had lying around which improved the appearance and quality considerably.  Very happy with this watch! It's on sale now on the Timex website (so is the Charlie Brown Marlin).
Watches,foeig3k,t3_g6ilew,1587704612.0,my girlfriend just bought me the red Snoopy baseball one! these are so fun

Watchexchange,foballi,t1_fob7crq,1587657842.0,"I bought my first back in mid-March I think, so like a month ago lol. I wanted a Seiko 5 as well but knew I'd eventually want a better watch so I decided to just get one that I actually liked a lot more now than compromise and end up having to sell it later on. saves some money if you think about it, but that might just be me (I'm also really into photography so buying cheap and ending up selling later for better gear taught me a lesson, especially because gear depreciates in value). 

All G-Shocks just seem too big for my tiny wrists, and I can do everything I'd do with a G-Shock with the Casio I have in this post (it's like $25 new, also comes in black). 

I don't know much about watch winding cases but I've read on forums that they're not worth it. The Hamilton has an 80 hour power reserve though which is pretty generous."
Watchexchange,fob4xxi,t1_fob4cdl,1587656168.0,nice! I had my eye on the GA2100 for a while but ultimately decided to get a Hamilton Khaki Auto instead as my daily.

UCSantaBarbara,fnt4gff,t3_g2p70h,1587234428.0,"one of my favorite classes! I got A's on both midterms but average on the final so ended up with a B+ :( 
midterms are super easy if you put in the time. lots of hardcore memorization. final was a different format and it was cumulative so definitely harder but also doable. highly recommend the class. 
oh but you have to attend lecture because she only records the material up to the first midterm to give students without a microbio background an easier time to catch up. section was kind of ass due to one group presentation and weekly short homework assignments but overall pretty chill."
