explainlikeimfive,fpfq1qu,t1_fpfeg38,1588579388.0,This is such an insightful comment but buried deep in this reddit thread where few people will read it :/ I want you to know I read it and found it great!
Stellaris,fpeb245,t1_fpcfkdt,1588543950.0,"The way you're notified is if they communicate with you. That means they successfully understood your language before you understood theirs. Yep, even if you started the project before them. That's because there is a set number of AI empires (you can change the number before starting a new game) that get starting bonuses which put them ahead of you in terms of science, among other things, at the beginning of the game. Hope this covers everything!"
GameDeals,fpaphwj,t1_fpairqy,1588453003.0,"If you search this sub for 'stellaris' and go through the top posts of the past month/year, you should find some comments describing what each dlc offers. Then you can pick which ones sound fun to you. Hope this helps!"
Stellaris,fpa218n,t1_fp9yhq1,1588439217.0,"Is there somewhere I can read about it?

&#x200B;

Edit: nevermind, I found a reddit thread about it when I googled it. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/b6oco3/missile_tracking/) for anyone who might stumble upon this thread later."
Stellaris,fp9ybv1,t1_fp9xxu9,1588437086.0,"Thank you! But is this explained in game? Also, how does missile tracking work?"
Stellaris,fp9x5yc,t1_fp9p9n1,1588436402.0,"I'm new to the game, and in my experience I've always been destroyed in online RTSs, but this sounds fun! I think I'll join and give it a try :)"
UCSD,fp0hv64,t1_foxoylp,1588209580.0,"Dude literally fax, also on the previous one for me. Felt terrible starting so late and using up my skip days. At the same time though, there's much more work than usual from other classes and it's honestly overwhelming to have to put in this much more effort for everything, relatively speaking."
Overwatch,fot4l9z,t1_fosivqk,1588044518.0,"Coming from a siege player, we just got pick and ban implemented a few months ago and it really isn't that effective. A good 80% of matches at least, across all ranks, ban the same 4 operators every single time. Like clockwork, without thinking. They are comfort bans to remove the 'annoying' operators from the match without any thought of strategy. And then the devs end up nerfing those characters a lot but they are still banned every single time as people are used to clicking on them now. It's so pointless in the end."
cyberpunkgame,fot2gy9,t3_g9bma9,1588043165.0,"This isn't a taxi guys it's an [auto rickshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw), they're really common in South East Asia as public transport. They are very similar to taxis but not the same. They're also found in parts of Africa and South America."
underlords,fori8bo,t1_foqjfza,1588012674.0,It's basically a really high damage build. The already high assassin damage is amplified by void leading to very quick rounds which you usually win by miles. In my experience it's usually countered by a strong mage spirits build or very well positioned summoners
Gamingcirclejerk,foa5dg8,t1_fo9p8lk,1587639963.0,"/uj I personally find it annoying that there's often a dozen comments like that whenever it's a user's cake day. I get that it's a genuine thing and it's nice to say, just like a lot of people saying happy birthday, but it feels irrelevant (I can't think of a better word?) to see a load of happy cake day comments no matter what the topic at hand is. Especially when someone says crazy stuff like 'xyz is worse than Hitler!!!' and instead of objecting to that kind of comparison people just say ""HEY happy cake day!!!!"""
Gamingcirclejerk,foa54om,t1_foa1d51,1587639770.0,"Oh I see! I googled it and there's a subreddit and stuff too. How neat, thank you!"
Gamingcirclejerk,fo9clly,t3_g6ed8i,1587615908.0,Top reply: happy cake day!
Gamingcirclejerk,fo9ci4m,t1_fo8szn7,1587615838.0,"All I've seen of hbomberguy is his Ben Shapiro joke and the climate change video, is he a neo nazi too?"
UCSD,fo6b359,t3_g5u31s,1587553234.0,Hey I took CSE 11 in the fall and I did pretty well so I can help you for sure! Just DM me! (as long as you're not violating AI so be careful about that)
JustCause,fnrxlct,t1_fnqkcy0,1587205496.0,Thank you!
UCSD,fnmk7rn,t1_fnm99s4,1587072921.0,"Hah that's cool, just goes to show how people are different I guess, cos I had her for math 20b. the lectures were fine but I bombed the exams. Thank you for sharing anyway!"
underlords,fnmg5dt,t1_fnlxzto,1587070825.0,I'm not a high level player but what I always do is pick an underlord to cover the weakness of my composition. So for a brawny build I would pick damage anessix or hobgen. Why is this (what I'm doing) a worse strategy than picking an underlord that magnifies my composition (what you're suggesting)?
UCSD,fnljrj0,t1_fnkebjq,1587054743.0,Who was your prof for 18?
UCSD,fnlj91h,t3_g2aqlu,1587054493.0,Yes this week's lab was wack
StarWarsBattlefront,fmgrnhb,t1_fmgqq31,1586056016.0,"It depends on the source material. In Canon yes it's only a few million up to a few hundred million droids. In Legends it was actually trillions of droids. The CIS was so ridiculously large, well funded and spread out over the galaxy. It was a real civil war type situation as many planets wanted to leave the Republic because they lacked faith in it and thought it was crumbling. God, sometimes I miss the amount of detail and the grandiose scale of the prequel trilogy presented in Legends. The OP of the first comment was right, if Palpatine wasn't carefully pulling the strings the CIS would win easily. Of course, if he wasn't pulling the strings nothing would be the same either."
