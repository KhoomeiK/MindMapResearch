berkeley,fp7mfb4,t1_fp72iju,1588373397.0,"I think you might be surprised. I’ve had extremely similar scenarios happen to me. A TA asked me if I knew what recursion was despite me having literally just finished  the prior course in the sequence, working in a Scheme-adjacent; which is to say, I worked exclusively with recursion. 

But to get to the larger point: I get what you’re saying, right. In an isolated incident, this sort of a comment is a throwaway—we understand people never mean to be condescending, that people mean well. The problem is with the collective. When the same pattern happens over and over again, when your male counterparts aren’t asked these same fundamentally basic questions, that’s when it begins to weigh more heavily. So even though the broader effect is the result of dozens of interactions, we ask that individuals who make up small parts of that impact to try to help solve that problem. It’s often as simple as a change in perspective or framing. 

I think most women are not deeply offended by singular interactions—we absorb it, and try not to be sensitive about it, like you say. But we choose to speak up about this because it has happened many times to almost all of us."
berkeley,fp6znu0,t1_fp3h7jg,1588361406.0,"Context is everything! If you’re approaching a random person in the first week of an intro class, by all means go ahead. If you’re approaching a CS major who’s taken advanced data structures and you’re asking if they know what a queue is, that can very frequently be construed as condescending because it makes the implicit assumption that they are not competent. 

It just so happens that women are approached with the latter situation more frequently than their male counterparts—very often it’s well-meaning and just unconscious bias, but this sort of post is meant to bring awareness to this behavior so people with good intentions who don’t intend to be rude are able to change how they are perceived."

pics,fo3n28g,t1_fo3m9hr,1587489645.0,"The earliest record of ropes is over 28000 years ago. Wheels were invented over 5000 years ago in Mesopotamia. A ramp is incredibly easy—hills are a physical proof of concept. If a civilization was smart enough to figure out jewelry, let alone mummification, the tech is child’s play. The only difficulty is manpower, and we know they had that in spades."
csMajors,fnroqrc,t3_g3jfjt,1587195997.0,"To me, it looks like you like Penn better but are drawn by CMU’s CS prestige. I’d say that you honestly will do better where you are happier. Penn has a great program and you cannot go wrong with either. It is true that perhaps some marginal number of startups will choose to recruit at CMU only, but mostly getting jobs is down to hustle, regardless of the program’s overall strength. 

All of this is further complicated by the fact that your medical condition appears to be under control right now, and you will be better served closer to your existing support system of doctors and family. Trying to rebuild all of that in a new city is difficult. 

I would pick Penn, if I were you."
yale,fn0sm3n,t3_fvji38,1586547958.0,"Took both together last semester! It was totally doable—start 201 homework early because you’ll want time to think over the problems if you get stuck, but I mostly did all of the 202 psets during office hours the two days before it was due. Studying for exams wasn’t too bad either because they’re mostly logic on the day-of and not regurgitation. Not an issue at all I think :)

PM me if you have any questions"
ABoringDystopia,fn0qdd3,t1_fn0o4xk,1586546750.0,"To note, Skull and Bones is an undergraduate secret society at Yale (of which there are dozens), and members are “tapped”/invited each year. Existing members may tap one new member each, and some powerful campus leadership positions get automatic taps, like the chief editor of the Yale Daily News or the football captain. 

Skull and Bones is, of course, the most well-known and the most “prestigious”, so-to-speak, so children of the powerful and wealthy often fill the spots that are not automatically granted, but there is certainly a process that is semi-transparent on campus. Naturally, there exists a correlation between membership and power, but that mostly comes from the inherent characteristics of those who are tapped (i.e. showing strong leadership at Yale, which is notorious for accepting students who were all leaders in high school, or already coming in with a powerful background). 

Just wanted to share some info on that, not professing any political opinion in this."
Coronavirus,fmrr4m9,t1_fmrnc6e,1586332434.0,"The reason the guidance on masks changed is not really because the admin now believes that they have incredible value in preventing infection of a healthy wearer, but rather in preventing spread from an asymptomatic individual. 

The fiddling and touching of the face certainly falls in line with moral hazard, but that goes to the point about wearing masks being false insurance for helping you avoid infection. Doesn’t affect its ability to stop the virus from spreading from those who are already infected."
csMajors,fmgjho9,t1_fmew0oc,1586050423.0,"Upper-level math is entirely proofs—you cannot be a calculator in discrete, you have to think through the logic. (question: what do you mean by “mathematical” but not good at logic?) 

At the same time, programming is analogous to writing proofs which may help you if you are strong there. 

A proof is really just a careful explanation of why something is true or not. To do so, you just have to think about what paths you can use to arrive at the conclusion (equiv to the algo) and what cases it might fail (equiv to edge casing). It is easier than you might think."
