UCSantaBarbara,fp3iybf,t3_gb34s8,1588280112.0,I have yet to get grades on any labs or discussions so far so I feel your pain. It’s so hard to fix what your doing wrong when it’s week five and the only grade you have other than quizzes is a single pre-lab.

UCSantaBarbara,fo639fm,t3_g5wzgw,1587544864.0,"Got a 71% on the exam so not great. I was really hoping for all multiple choice with Price and instead got murdered by the free response. Also felt a bit annoyed with the whole “a significant number of students got 90% or higher!” bit, especially considering the average was 63 so clearly there’s something not adding up here."

UCSantaBarbara,fmvalzz,t1_fmv0wmu,1586410719.0,That’s how I’m feeling about chem 2b lab right now. The prelab and quiz were due at the beginning of the week all on info price didn’t cover in his lecture schedule until today.

I applied for readmission (undeclared major) in 2019 and got back in with a simple application. I’m not sure if this will work for everyone, but from what an advisor told me as long as you left not on probation and with a minimum 2.0 they’ll let you back in."
