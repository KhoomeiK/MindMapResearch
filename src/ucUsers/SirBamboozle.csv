UCI,fn2g9ci,t3_fyxmad,1586587930.0,"5/10. Most of what I learned came from my MGMT courses. Things that I can actually apply (and have applied at work) came from MGMT courses. It's more of a theoretical coursework. Classes are huge, so no projects where you can actually apply what you learn. 

Dont get me wrong though, I love the material though.

But if you want to learn something technical, join MGMT courses."
