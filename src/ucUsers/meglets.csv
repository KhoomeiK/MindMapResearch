I'm not sure which dept you're in, but this would be a case where I might seek a second opinion. Can you enlist the help of the professor who approved the drop?"
compmathneuro,folgrwp,t3_g7qamh,1587861893.0,Apply to our summer school this July and find out what a hybrid of these fields could be for you by learning from people who do both: https://www.neuromatch.io/academy/
compmathneuro,fo7odg7,t1_fo7clwh,1587581772.0,We are aware of the problem and working on a fix! Thank you for your patience!
compmathneuro,fo76w5o,t1_fo6y3t2,1587573283.0,"We are still solidifying the selection criteria, but I can tell you we want this to be as inclusive as possible.  At minimum, Python proficiency (or catching up before we start), appropriate match background to understand the topics, and foundational knowledge in neuroscience is necessary.  You're right this course will be focused on hands-on exercises.  If you've already participated in a summer school and are a comp neuro grad student you'll likely be a very good candidate.  Please apply!"
ucr,fo5req2,t1_fo4fvid,1587533356.0,"Has this been resolved? Unless there are circumstances you're not including here -- and potentially even if there are -- this is really not okay. I would chase this and figure out how you got added without notification, and make a stink if they dont remove the Fs. If I found out this had happened to one of my students with their or my knowledge because of administrative nonsense, you bet I'd make a stink about it."
neuroscience,fo4r0dr,t1_fo3ipvg,1587509541.0,Please sign up yes. We want to be able to see how big this gets :)
neuroscience,fo4qz2b,t1_fo3os39,1587509521.0,Yes! That's totally what the observer track is for!
neuroscience,fo4qxpt,t1_fo4hw8c,1587509500.0,It's coming!
neuroscience,fo4qwu7,t1_fo3rg4f,1587509486.0,"Not yet but stay tuned! Will be posted on the website as we build it. Think big though, we are gonna get some great people on board and have a few already."
neuroscience,fo36ss7,t1_fo26ogk,1587481617.0,"Do you want to be involved as a TA? Unfortunately you may be a bit young for that (we are looking for people with PhD or postdoc level knowledge for that). But if you want to join as a student you are welcome to apply. And if you want to help in other ways, send me a DM."
compmathneuro,fo36n5s,t1_fo2i0u0,1587481532.0,"Unfortunately there are actually computational neuroscience summer schools that don't pay TAs at all. Like, really good ones. We think that is not acceptable. Any successful fundraising we do will go towards TA stipends so we can make them bigger."
neuroscience,fo36h22,t1_fo2s7z6,1587481441.0,"Yes absolutely. We will not be teaching how to code. Assumed working knowledge of Python is a prerequisite. Every tutorial will have 2 levels of goals: something everybody can get, and something that's a reach for the more advanced folks. So you'd be in good company."
neuroscience,fo23wig,t1_fo23nr5,1587448937.0,"Please do, if you want to be an observer that is awesome and we would love to have you. Submitting the application helps us understand what kinds of students are interested and how many. All materials will be made freely available, but it'd be lovely to know how many observers we actually will get. Thanks for your interest!"
neuroscience,fo235kd,t1_fo22d3i,1587448302.0,"Yes we intend this to be an enduring annual event. It's too much work to just put on once ;) Hopefully we will see you next year, but you are also welcome to join as an observer or to simply navigate the materials we produce in your own time. All will be made freely available."
compmathneuro,fo218ko,t1_fo207e9,1587446712.0,"Yes! If you're a CS person with interest in neuroscience you're a great candidate! We will be posting ""get up to speed"" resources as we collect and decide on the best ones. So far we have a large list and are in the process of narrowing it down to the most critical to suggest. This has all come together over the past 10 days so far so stay tuned -- we are moving quickly to compile and organize."
compmathneuro,fo212bm,t1_fo1tm4x,1587446569.0,"This is exactly our goal. We are intensely seeking funding and so far have over $50k USD in grant funds dedicated. It is 100% earmarked for TA salaries, with the exception of the very small amount we will need to buy e.g. crowdcasting software access. We hope this will also provide career advancement due to the highly interactive and collaborative nature, so we do not view it as a thankless job at all. It is paramount we pay TAs what they are worth, and we hope to offer more than just salary too.

This is also Round 1 to gauge not just TA interest but also student interest. We will have a better idea of scale by April 27 and then can restructure as necessary. We have only been at this about 10 days so far, for this online format, but we feel confident we can get there. Neuromatch came together in like 2 weeks, so we have good precedent. Thanks for your feedback!"
neuro,fnlmaau,t1_fnjqezf,1587055956.0,"Actually the spinoff is THIS July, 2020.  CoSMo has been moved but the new online version goes live in a few months.  We're still getting it together to create a website, probably connected to [neuromatch.io](https://neuromatch.io)"

neuro,fnfw80z,t3_g1etsk,1586916789.0,"I'm helping create a massive, intensive online summer school for exactly this, coming in July. Very likely to be 100% free for all. Watch Konrad Kording's twitter for announcements in the coming days! Hope you'll join us.

Edit: it's a spinoff of CoSMo (http://www.compneurosci.com/CoSMo/) and neuromatch (https://neuromatch.io/)"
matlab,fn2gpot,t3_fyg96d,1586588387.0,"I run really intensive machine learning, neuroimaging analyses, and real-time fMRI decoding and neurofeedback on a Macbook Pro from like 2015 with 16gb ram. I have multiple newer and more powerful computers in my lab, but they're not strictly necessary unless I'm on a time crunch. You do not need 64gb ram, my goodness. If you need that much ""power"", you better be trying to train massive variational autoencoders with Tensorflow or something, in which case get a GPU because Matlab is massively less efficient than Python for parallel processing/multithreading. Running Matlab can be done on the equivalent of a chromebook. It's what you want to do in Matlab that matters."

ucr,fm3e2fi,t1_fm0zm5m,1585720422.0,"The professor may not have the ability to go over 300 if UCR didn't give him/her a webinar Zoom add-on. Apparently these are expensive and only given out if you ask for them if the University didn't already realize you needed one. The prof will need to ask UCR IT to upgrade their Zoom account. My guess is they already know this and it's in the works, but may not hurt to ask for any others who are experiencing this."
