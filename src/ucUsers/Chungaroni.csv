The comparisons to The Cure are interesting as The Cure had actual hits in the US but not until their 8th album. I think it’s likely we’ve yet to hear the biggest song in The 1975’s career."
AskReddit,fpim602,t3_gdhll9,1588643795.0,"Back when I was in Boy Scouts we would do a flag ceremony every Memorial Day at a local monument that would be attended mostly by veterans. Usually it went flawlessly but one time in particular we were extremely out of sync with each other and ended up unfolding the American flag and presenting it all twisted so that it looked like a farfalle noodle. 

I tried my best to keep a straight face given the circumstances but this was an absolute embarrassment. One friend let out the tiniest snicker and before I knew it all 6 of us participating in the ceremony were struggling to not laugh out loud. It was an extremely tense situation and I still feel bad about it to this day.

For the rest of my time in Boy Scouts afterwards we made sure every flag ceremony was flawless."

You can search the distribution of MBTI types online."
the1975,foh640u,t3_g7e1mb,1587760956.0,Is this for both versions combined?
audioengineering,foeoncd,t3_g73a5r,1587709676.0,"I feel like song key can be too subjective and gets really muddy when you incorporate modes and whatnot.

If a song is just using D G A and Bm chords it would most likely be D major but could also be A mixolydian if ordered in a certain way with a certain emphasis.

And then there’s songs with a million key changes too."

the1975,fo456qe,t3_g5ikg3,1587498386.0,"This is probably in my top 10 of theirs. But honestly, whenever I listen to ILIWYS front to back I forget it exists.

Always a pleasant surprise when it comes on."
the1975,fnuw7zk,t3_g3xvhg,1587272760.0,"Honestly it changes every week, but this week it’s probably Sincerity Is Scary. The little bend when Matty says the word “I” at the end of the chorus gets me every time."
the1975,fnt7xx4,t3_g3oa8r,1587236346.0,"If You’re Too Shy definitely seems like the most hyped release of theirs yet, which makes me wonder if it has the potential to be as big of a hit as The Sound or Chocolate (or in the US, Somebody Else or Love It If We Made It)"
AskReddit,fnrs1lg,t1_fnrjrpb,1587199392.0,Well that makes at least two of us
AskReddit,fnnmps3,t3_g2s94t,1587096054.0,I was ahead of my entire grade in math in middle school. There was also a math teacher at our middle school with the same last name as me (my last name is within the top 50 last names in the US so it’s fairly common). Everyone assumed that I was her son despite the fact that we looked nothing alike.

I was really hoping to get more involved with clubs next year and most likely rush as well."

I don’t see how the two would be related though."

Music,fn1txmy,t3_fyph8x,1586570027.0,"The song “Bad Decisions” interpolates “Dancing with Myself” and I’ve also heard it compared to “I Melt with You” by Modern English. When I hear it it reminds me a lot of “Devil Inside” by INXS, especially the end of the song when both songs alternate between C and F major chords.

Is it just me that thinks this or was the song inspired by INXS at all?"
AskReddit,fmz96j9,t3_fy1ca6,1586511363.0,"I remember a camping trip where I was about 11 years old and my younger sister was maybe 8 or 9. There were maybe 5 different families all camping together on this trip, all with children relatively close in age. All of us were sitting around the campfire one night except for the youngest kids on the trip who had just went to bed. This included my sister, who was getting ready for bed in our family tent trailer.

Our tent trailer was parked so that her bed directly faced the campfire within about 10 feet, and had a zipper that could be unzipped giving my sister direct access to watch the people at the campfire. My sister had also been reading a lot of jokes on some app she had recently downloaded. Instead of going to bed as intended, my sister began telling everyone at the campfire jokes from her bed in the tent trailer like she was on a TV screen.

My sister told about 5 jokes, all lighthearted. Then she asked “How can you tell who a blonde’s boyfriend is?” No response from the campfire. Then my sister said the answer “From the belt buckle imprint on her forehead.” 

None of us kids got it at the time but all the adults (who had all had a couple beers) started dying laughing."

Showerthoughts,fkztbg6,t3_flm118,1584679737.0,I’ve been driving as a doordasher and recently I texted a customer asking if they would be alright with a “no contact” delivery. They called me cringy. Humanity is doomed.
