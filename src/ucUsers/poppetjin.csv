MadeMeSmile,fpf4fcw,t1_fpf32cb,1588561535.0,"It's like being gay in the way that it's not really an acquired trait but more a discovered trait. I just simply never sexually/physically desire anyone. There's also Aromantic people (people who do not experience romantic attraction). This doesn't mean lack of libido though. Asexuality is also a spectrum like any other sexuality. Some people need to have a deep emotional bond first before having sex. Others just can't deal with sex because it grosses them out. Or sometimes people just don't care and it doesn't cross their mind often enough to be important. 

If this is still confusing, think of it like ethnic attraction but for genders and sexes. Many people have a racial or ethnic preference when dating. Some people are simply more physically attractive than others according to your personal preference. Boy? Girl? Nonbinary? The answer is None or Not Applicable. 

All that being said, I do still have a boyfriend. He is a normal straight man and loves sex. We have to come to a middle ground, however, because I am personally not into sex. I think it's messy and smells weird and tiring. Yes, I know what orgasms feel like. It does feel good. Biologically, I can still experience everything normally. Mentally, I just don't care enough to seek it. I'd much rather play video games or cuddle than have sex. Yes, cuddling is very good. I love hugs and kisses. But the moment a penis is involved, I have to think whether or not I'm tolerant enough to deal with it this time. I see penis. I get grossed out. I see nice booty and abs, I appreciate because I understand the work that went into obtaining them. I see conventionally good face, I don't really care because I'm too biased towards my boyfriend's face lol. 

I hope my description helps. It's not comprehensive because, like any sexuality, it's really complicated. But hopefully, this gives you an idea into what being asexual is like. Sorry your libido is clashing with your lifestyle choices! I hope you power through and find a good partner to support you!"

careerguidance,fpc8utr,t3_gckyda,1588491601.0,"i don't have any statistics or experience but i think you should always follow your passion BUT also work on a fallback lifestyle. you can write whenever and whatever you want, but ultimately it can still be a risky lifestyle. you should work on other trades and skills to help pad your falls should you ever encounter them. good luck with your goals and ambitions! i hope things work out for you."
