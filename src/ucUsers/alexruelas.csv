UCSC,fpklynz,t1_fpjhvbw,1588697038.0,Oh awesome! Thanks ‘

UCSC,fpklupd,t1_fpjis0c,1588696983.0,119k is taught this spring? What is that about? Do you write a research paper or what are you doing exactly?
UCSC,fpj3l2v,t1_fpj32p6,1588655622.0,Thanks!

UCSC,fpivceb,t3_gdlvxa,1588649579.0,I transferred in the fall and I’m double majoring in both intensive psych and sociology w a concentration in GISES. I am basically done with intensive psych after summer quarter and have the next school year to finish the rest of my second major. (There’s something called double count which makes you take less classes to fulfill a major)
UCSC,fphabbr,t1_fph9sps,1588617730.0,Make sure they are all transferable and you’re good
UCSC,fphaa3k,t1_fph9sps,1588617713.0,The minimum is 60 transferable units
UCSC,fph81b3,t3_gdgz0g,1588616597.0,If you don’t have enough credits then yes
UCSC,fpb63st,t3_gb689s,1588462899.0,I have 119K but I already used my code
UCSC,fp4sg7q,t1_fp4sc69,1588306224.0,Yea that’s unfair for the students
UCSC,fp4j268,t3_gb8091,1588300139.0,Imagine guessing it correctly and getting punished for it

UCSC,fo7yqqc,t3_g5wger,1587586851.0,Some interesting classes! I’m taking a Latinx psych class which is engaging
UCSC,fntahx5,t3_g3jd2e,1587237782.0,I’m 90% sure it will be online
UCSC,fntaeaa,t1_fnt4xo5,1587237725.0,The response is why we are in this situation. His plans to defund the WHO isn’t going to help in the future either. So yea it is Trump and other members of the Government.
UCSC,fnqh1a9,t3_g33x8w,1587164443.0,If you’re on campus then I’m sure you can get a refund if it’s in online. Off campus will be a different story
UCSC,fniwpyx,t3_g117lv,1586987716.0,"There was a flood when I lived there so it got lonely when a lot of people moved and there were loud noises from the construction workers. It was cool and had free printing before the flood.

The transit to campus is ok but coming back is difficult. You might get there later than you hope to come back. Takes at least 30 min to get to or from campus"
UCSC,fnfyszm,t3_g0murv,1586918403.0,"As a person whose dormed in multiple UCs already for events, I would say Santa Cruz. UCR has that dry heat and it’s a cool school but I hear better things about the services there than Ucsc. Location and weather wise, UCSC. Unless you’re looking to escape NorCal lol"
UCSC,fnfy6g6,t3_g11mo7,1586918007.0,So would housing only apply for winter and spring or whenever it is safe to come back?

UCSC,fn77168,t3_fym2dy,1586714531.0,"Professor Covarrubias psych 100 and psych 140
She is absolutely amazing and especially caring towards her students. She is the definition one of best professors ever

Professor Casanova psych 144. She is especially caring and looks after her students. She cares a lot and tries to help them succeed.

Professor Cardilla psych 181. She is amazing. She takes the classes slow and chooses to teach in a way that helps the students learn better. Her personality is also amazing!

#TripleC"
UCSC,fn76pia,t1_fn0qt9k,1586714352.0,I’m in that class right now! I agree with you. The way she explains everything is helpful. It’s not rushed or overly confusing
UCSC,fn769pq,t1_fn7639o,1586714111.0,Oh that’s cool. Do you or anyone else know if taking pass/no pass slightly hurt your chances for grad school or nah?
UCSC,fn7618q,t3_fzooq1,1586713979.0,Is t the dining hall technically free though for this quarter
UCSC,fn75v6n,t1_fn4xd4l,1586713885.0,"Depends on your departments requirement for letter grades. If you are taking classes that have to be taken for letter grades then you are screwed. If not, then you can take the pass/no pass without it counting"
UCSC,fn1kz3u,t3_fysgsz,1586564239.0,Any advice or tips would be helpful. Asking for a friend
UCSC,fn1a5w6,t1_fn180w3,1586557848.0,"You get to see your grades. It really depends on your department. If they require certain major classes to be a letter grade then you have to follow that. If they don’t specify exactly and you asked to confirm, then you’re good to take your major classes as pass/no pass. I don’t think it might affect anything.

I don’t know if  for grad school this will help or hurt, but I’m sure if it somehow does hurt then they should more than understand why you have a pass no pass grade this quarter"
UCSC,fn0rjfx,t1_fn0r9uf,1586547382.0,"I would say so. I just think non-housing guaranteed means you’re not not guaranteed a house priority wise, but you can still apply and hope to get lucky.

UTC and the village are generally easier to get into from what I heard. 

I lived in the UTC last year and it was cool. Just 20-30 min bus ride to campus"

UCSC,fn0lcq4,t3_fyljhq,1586544063.0,It’s on the housing application. Much easier to get into in my opinion
UCSC,fn0ky5s,t3_fyhvqk,1586543847.0,Where does it say this? Did I not see an email?
UCSC,fmy9fif,t1_fmy8o90,1586480998.0,It doesn’t mean that all classes are pass/no pass.
UCSC,fmy9e11,t1_fmy8o90,1586480971.0,"Yes. The sociology department mentioned it and I emailed the psych department and they said that is the move for this quarter.

“Contact your a college advisor if you have any questions about pass/no pass” is what the psych department told me after they confirmed that it was true."

UCSC,fmxq6xk,t1_fmxq0px,1586469743.0,Thanks!
UCSC,fmxpg6d,t1_fmxp5k9,1586469344.0,"Same thing as before. If your major is lax and allows pass/no pass then you can use it. If your major requires all letter grades then you can’t use it for your major classes.

I know psych and sociology do allow pass/no pass grades but only for 25% of major classes. 
Depends on departments really"
UCSC,fmxkbud,t1_fmxk5io,1586466602.0,Yea I think undergrads have that option until week 9 via office of registrar
UCSC,fmx81pg,t3_fw1h2m,1586460153.0,"True, too bad we didn’t get to see the UTC open back up again. They were about done with the common rooms by the a week or 2 before winter finals occurred. Would had been nice to have that free printing back"
