> We can def leave it in our notes to the future Chair

Does that mean you guys won't pass the suggestion up for the current election? If so, why not? It would be great if you guys could pass a note up to whoever drafts and edits the language.

Another question for you you guys. 

> 3.4.4.e Student Fee Adjustment Measures require a minimum 20% voter turnout in order to be effective.

Does this provision in the election code mean that any turnout percentage below 20% will nullify a referenda 'win'?"
ucla,fntvqrm,t1_fnttg25,1587249519.0,"Okay, like suggested below. What about this language?

($15 per quarter or a maximum of $45 per year.)"
ucla,fntsf8c,t1_fntrh9o,1587247775.0,"That's a fair counter point. In that case, it would be wise to then include the $45 per year figure to keep it highly accurate.

Language like the following would probably suffice:

 ($45 per year or $15 per quarter).

Overall, including the annual figure in the language is not a burdensome request and I don't see how there could be reasonable opposition to it. More neutral unbiased information, to provide more perspective to voters, is never a bad thing."
ucla,fntqhor,t1_fntnxu3,1587246811.0,"For full transparency, the language should honestly include the full amount in millions that the referendum proposes to collect every year.

Only including the (per quarter, per capita) amount seems like a way of making the referendum more palatable, and doesn’t paint the full picture of how many millions these new fees will collect into perpetuity. Voters deserve to know the entire fiscal impact."

Do you think now is a good time to raise student fees?"
ucla,fnsvc0d,t3_fypxpl,1587229495.0,"I wonder who's in charge of writing the ballot language for USAC elections? I don't recall voting for a referendum during my time at UCLA so I don't remember how things are usually worded. In any case, I hope it's not USAC itself who submits language because that would contribute to a highly-biased and manipulated ballot.

I'm pretty sure that in California either the Leg Counsel or LAO writes the analyses and descriptions of propositions and candidates on the ballot. The intent behind this is to present both sides of an issue neutrally and objectively. A disinterested third-party is therefore tasked with writing the language that appears on the ballot.

How can voters remain sure that the ballot language will be neutral and objective in this way? For instance, that it disclose that the referendum raises student fees by $45 per year - a key and objective fact.

I would speculate that USAC might try to actively suppress this information on a ballot in order to gain more votes. If left up to USAC, they might conveniently leave out from the ballot description the fiscal impact of voting yes. They might also paint the referendum in the best possible light, while describing the 'No' option as a guilt trip. I'm curious to know what exactly prevents USAC from being biased and manipulative with the ballot language.

I think this is an issue worth discussing because ballot manipulation can be subtle but have big impacts on a race. Things like the placement of voting options, the order of the options, the total number of options, and especially the language itself can be used to subtly dissuade or persuade voters. Ideally, the ballot should be written by someone who is not in USAC, affiliated with the referendum or candidates, or otherwise biased in any way. It should be neutral, objective, and include key facts.

This time around, students are keeping a close eye and usual tactics will not go unseen. I think the overwhelming majority of students would prefer to a see a neutral ballot that is not subject to devious influence by USAC - a group who openly endorses both referenda options.

What is concerning is the lack of transparency on these issues. How can we be sure everyone is not in cahoots? I'm not making accusations or anything, I'm just curious about the process.

So my question are, who writes and designs the ballot and ballot language for USAC elections? How do voters know that it will be neutral and not subject to manipulation by those in power? How do we know that it won't leave out key, objective facts that might otherwise be suppressed by the status quo?

Edit: Overall if they fail to include something as basic as the dollar amount the fees amount to annually per capita, you can be sure that something fishy was going on behind the scenes.

However, even if it doesn't happen you'll be in good shape in terms of landing a job with a CS degree from Cal, given that you do the right things: intern, do projects, etc.

The problem is that it'll be difficult to transfer from one UC to other. UCs give preference to community college students for transfer and there's a limited number of spots available to UC to UC transfers. From what I know, the students who do manange to do the UCB > UCLA transfer, or vice verse, are those with compelling reasons - such as needing to be close to a parent who is sick or struggling.
