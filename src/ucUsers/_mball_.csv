In terms of tech things, all of these are totally optional, but things I really love having.

* You'll probably get use out of an external monitor. Doesn't need to be big, but definitely helpful for ergonomics when working at a desk. 
* Noise Cancelling headphones. Didn't use them as a student, but now that I found the ones I like, I totally would have. But I did appreciate my nicer pair of headphones, and they got use.
* USB Battery Pack. No phone ever has enough battery capacity. ...maybe this is a me problem, LOL.
* Something with good image quality. Could be your phone, could be a fancy camera. But capture memories of college.
* An external drive or online backup service like Backblaze or Crashplan or whatever. Google Drive is decent, and you should use it, but at any point, something can happen to your computer and this will make your life easier.  


Non-Teach, but make sure you enjoy wearing your backpack / bag / etc. Ideally, hopefully, you'll be walking a lot across campus and between places. Berkeley is perfectly walkable, but it's not small and comfortable straps make a big difference."

Not everyone will have the best environment, thought. This is true face to face, but exacerbated during a pandemic. Things may not be normal in the fall, but we will be better prepared to adapt and plan.

What you lose out on are all the intangibles and the experiences outside the classroom, and even though I am no longer a student, those things matter to me too. Having discussions after class, or getting lunch with my TAs (damn I just want to go to a restaurant), or sneaking into the student section during a game are all things I will greatly miss. They will, in total, make the semester immeasurably different. 

But, I'll be back in the fall. Gonna do the best I can to provide great courses and meet students however I might. It's gonna be awkward AF at times, but we have to try. What else am I gonna do? (Actually I do have ideas....but teaching sounds way better.)"

berkeley,fngmcng,t1_fnah3yk,1586936968.0,"Sorry, I don't think I was being clear. I understand the differences in technical capabilities and designs between native and web apps, but that's not the point. You're right that apps can collect more data and/or more often, but that doesn't mean that data is governed by a different policy. (At least not typically, anything is possible.)

The privacy policy governs what a service does collect, and most importantly, what they say they are going to do with the data. That policy applies to any from of the service. Many explicitly say apps, though not all do. e.g. Reddit's policy (https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy)

As far as the Zoom/campus angle. berkeley.zoom.us is a single sign portal that only allows CalNet auth to get to Zoom. If you have a Berkeley account, that's how should log in, and the desktop and mobile apps use the exact same flow. (You can't even use the Google option.) 
When you are logged in that way, Zoom doesn't show you the links to their typical privacy policy and TOS in the footer. While not explicitly mentioned, this is because Zoom's contract with UCB would supersede and standard TOS/Privacy Policy that exists. (I've done with before companies I've worked for and educational tools I work on). I suspect, but can't know for certain, is that Zoom only mentions K-12 in their many policies because they don't expect individual K-12 schools to create more unique contracts. It happens, definitely, but it's not as common as in higher ed.

Now, after testing it turns out that you can manually sign up for a Zoom account with a Berkeley email and it doesn't require you to use SSO, but in some cases it does not detect you're a Berkeley user properly. (Sigh, this is sadly easy to screw up, but not hard to fix...). On one @berkeley.edu account I created, it offered I ""Join"" the Berkeley account and then all my links were Berkeley.zoom the UI was slightly tweaked. On another @[subdomain].berkeley.edu account, Zoom didn't detect I was a Berkeley user and that has just a basic account. So, that's weird. It does seem possible to have a non-covered account with a Berkeley email. 
But the campus directions all say to use berkeley.zoom.us.

Two additional things:
* You can use zoom without downloading the app, though you would be missing out on a few features. Their UX sucks and is moderately coercive when it comes to not downloading, but you can host and participate in meetings from the web.
* We can't know this without Berkeley's contact, but it's possible anyone with a berkeley.edu email is covered even if the app isn't aware you're a Berkeley account. In the event there's automatic segmentation of data processing, the ""wrong"" thing probably happens on the backend, but some contracts I've seen cover users regardless of sign in method. But again, I have no specific knowledge here, just something that's possible."
berkeley,fn9bevq,t1_fmx88pq,1586766384.0,"> This applies to anything not a berkeley domain. Berkeley.zoom.us is covered. Zoom.us is not covered regardless of credentials used to sign in. There is nothing I can find on their privacy sites about applications (apps) not owned by berkeley.

I still don't get how from this it follows that berkeley.zoom.us and the Zoom app are should have different protections. For one thing, berkeley.zoom.us is merely a 'dummy' portal with some marketing and a particular login link. The subdomains are just a branding thing. When you use a Zoom desktop or mobile app you still sign in via Berkeley. The data the app sends goes to the exact same servers and datastore, and at least parts of the desktop app are literally the same code as the Zoom app is partially a web view. Further 'berkeley.zoom.us' is no different from zoom.us

Zoom is definitely not a 'UC Berkeley site', nor are the Google apps and even bCourses is debatable... but I am also not sure that apps are really completely different. In the case of Berkeley stuff, everything goes through CalNet, but in the most general case - these apps are merely just a frontend, a different interface to the same website. 

I really don't think most web services have different policies for apps...(https://policies.google.com/privacy applies to all Google services). I've been on both sides of the edtech issue -- working on products and receiving requests from schools. There's no expectation that apps are different. When reading or discussing with others, if we're talking about some service, the expectation is that policy holds for all forms of that service."

berkeley,fms1kqn,t1_fms0lv1,1586343428.0,"> Apps rarely use the privacy policies of their websites

I'm not sure this is true. I mean, it's certainly possible, but you don't usually have to agree a separate policy for an app. While apps and sites can collect different data, the bulk of it is the same.

I read through the Zoom policy, it distinguishes between ""services"" and ""marketing"" sites, but not between web services, applications or extensions. The data it references all exist in the various places. 

Also importantly, when signed in with a Berkeley account, I don't even see the typical privacy policy and legal links that are otherwise in the Zoom footer. This is almost certainly because the UCB contract has language that supersedes the standard policies. So, in that sense, without reading anything I can't say much for sure since I can't read that contract. 

When I use the Zoom app, I am still signed in with a UCB account and that data is still transmitted to the same Zoom servers. They still know who I am and that the account is a school one. I would be very surprised if there were different rules for the data collected."
