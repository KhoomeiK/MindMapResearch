The argument is negative side effects is better then death. If I get there I'll keep you posted.

Anyways your off subject. The evidence I posted is called misinformation. Your saying you dont belive US officials because they say use disinfectants and light as a treatment for covid 19.

What I'm asking is ... how is what im posting misinformation? Why should I not believe the US goverment that sunlight kills the virus?

Can the virus spread outside? Yes, but less likely. 
Can the virus spread in grocery stores? Yes. 

Can you give evidence that being outside is the same or higher risk as grocery shopping? If you can I'll delete my ""misinformation"" because as i understand the information presented it's less likely to spread outside on a sunny day.

""Yet the Amazon suit is now the second bid-protest litigation that has bogged JEDI down. The first was brought by Oracle, a niche player in the cloud industry, which could never have fulfilled the contract’s vast requirements. It mounted a massive campaign in the courts, media, Congress, and White House to force the Pentagon to chop the procurement up into multiple, smaller awards — its only chance to win a piece of the pie it is still pressing its case in a federal appeals court.""

One of the last parts of the article
,""
The mere fact that underdog Microsoft won is not suspicious in itself. The former Pentagon official who worked on JEDI said he “wasn’t surprised at all” by the outcome. He continued: “Either one of those clouds — or, for that matter Google’s cloud, had they stayed in the competition — it’s a BMW versus an Audi versus a Tesla. It comes down to, how do they do on the performance characteristics.” (In an interview, Forrester analyst Dave Bartoletti offered a similar assessment. “What we found in 2018,” he said, “the last time we did that evaluation, was that Microsoft had really closed all the gaps between it and AWS.”)

In fact, the former Pentagon official is as embittered by Amazon’s litigation as he is by Oracle’s — because both threaten to further delay implementation of JEDI for the warfighter.

Most people dont know for your 5gh internet at home (probably doesnt apply to reddit) that it's not very good at wall penetration and one wall is enough to block 90% of the signal. So if your router is behind a wall you're probably going to have a better connection with your 2.4 gh. 

Maybe someone can chip in on mesh wifi setup but I haven't messed with one yet. 

Most people's wifi are interfering on the same channels as others causing more interference.

 Again most are to lazy to wire a connection up (best case senario). 

Their target market are people who dont want a console or a pc so these people probably wouldnt fall into the category of people who know how to optimize their home network for stadia. 

Stadia does work well on mobile networks (where the signal is strong)  though, if you want to play games on your phone, not a bad option if your 4.5g connection is good in your area. 

They should sell that 100 dollar package with a home wifi optimization deal from your isp."
SandersForPresident,fmu47ry,t1_fmtlqxk,1586384270.0,"The idea behind the uc/state college system was to be as close to free as possible for students who get in. A way to motivate people to move to california and become part of the tax base here. Tuition used to be equivalent to a months work at minimum wage. 

15k is ridiculously expensive for what it is supposed to be. for in state tuition and if your parents make over 60k you're basically not getting any grants or scholarship because you're parents made too much. They've also voted to increase tuition once again. 

The Whole UC regents board (the people who control the uc system) is filled with private bankers and an audit determined Nopolitano misplaced 100 million dollars. 

We used to build colleges based on population increases ... we've added 5 to 10 million people since our last uc was built...

I try to keep up with the info because I'm an alumni, proud of the quality of education, mad at how they manage it. Our state slowly but surely decreased the portion of funding our educational system got while greatly increasing our portion in prison system. We should not be what people look up to as a political system. Its insanely corrupt. 

BART is one area of the state and I'm not sure how much state level influence is there. 

I'm in the southern area of California. I can tell you walking is faster then public transport here. (I'm exaggerating)."
SandersForPresident,fmtf3bk,t1_fmt66ls,1586371644.0,"Fire z missiles. 

Realistically, I do not recommend what we do here in California. High taxes, 0 to none public services from the state. Super strict regulations that limit housing and bussiness. 

I pay a 10.25% sales tax (this doesnt include additional gas taxes it does include a local sales tax though this isn't state wide, its 3 dollars a gallon here when oil is at an all time low ...)  and the state takes about 7% of my income. 0 decent public transportation, highways and streets filled with holes, UC tuition is close to 20,000 if not more, cal state is about half that, some private colleges are cheaper, still have to pay for my healthcare, we have the largest inmate population, we have the highest per capita illegal immigrant inmate population (hooray for sanctuary laws).

If you're an illegal though, you get a free drivers license, if you're under 26 and illegal you get free healthcare, illegals fill spots and take grant money at our colleges (if they show low enough income tuition is waived). But fuck me I'm a citizen got to pay for mine.

My effective tax rate is ridiculously high, I dont get any benefits from the state. The weather is fucking fantastic though, not sure it's related to taxes though. Our current situation isn't sustainable, we have debts and the new tax laws are showing a mass exodus of the middle class and upper class and a mass importation of low income individuals. California is about 5 years from having to take a credit downgrade if they dont reformat what were doing here. 

Recommendation, sneak in here and just assume a new identity as an illegal. You qualify for a shitload of benefits. 

All of the people in politics in California are enriching themselves and close partners. 

Our high speed rail for example. The route determined greatly benefited local Democratic donors who happened to own that land along the ""planned route"". Jerry brown's son was a lead engineer (totally qualified), Nancy Pelosi husband was the initial lead contractor. He actually gets a lot of work from us. 

PGE is a corporation and Jerry brown's sister sits on a hedge fund board who owns a massive stake in them. No surprise Jerry brown made it legal for PGE to up electricity costs to pay for lawsuits from fires. 

Seriously, if you follow in Californias foot steps get into politics and you'll be rich."
