ApplyingToCollege,fo3trn1,t1_fo3taf0,1587492811.0,I would try for cal. Ucsc is great school but I don’t think it’s that rigorous especially in the humanities department. Apply to Berkeley and UCSC and look at sc as your safety
ApplyingToCollege,fo2dvgd,t1_fo2czfs,1587458647.0,I wanted some more academic rigor at cal
berkeley,fo2bg1z,t1_fo2ayq2,1587456086.0,"True, all sounds pretty good. I like the idea of having a minor that I’m interested in.

I haven’t heard that many positive stories about cal state LA, the fact that it’s a commuter school makes it harder to find friends and stuff. 

I would recommended UCSC but I’m biased and went there"
UCSC,fo0ijce,t1_fo0bzi0,1587413766.0,"I think cola strikes did indeed hurt the education of the undergrads. For about a month on and off we had limited access to grades and other stuff we needed like the bus route. I can also say cola cost me a letter grade due to the professor being unable to add extra credit assignments we did because she didn’t have the grades. 

I think UCB will be a little more funded so maybe less of an issue? But maybe cola would have some support there but not as protesty?"
UCSC,fnzwthz,t1_fnzwhtg,1587402115.0,"I applied as junior transfer as intended philosophy. Fun fact, apparently you’re not declared if you get in so you can switch around, but it might be much harder since you already did coursework at Ucsc."
UCSC,fnzwfwm,t1_fnyn6vw,1587401928.0,What helped was applying as my major here. Did a lot of my major coursework already and finished up my GEs. High GPA probably helped. Also was kinda active on campus doing a couple things that helped like writing for a couple of journals and stuff.

I kinda feel like I didn't worked as hard as some other people that applied, but I kinda cheesed it by having a good gpa and cool essays. I transferred from UCSC so def not like top 20 or whatever but I got a very good education there for first two years and ig they kinda saw that."
berkeley,fntosv6,t1_fntl0zz,1587245931.0,Kinda the reason I want to transfer. I toked 24/7 these past two years and easily did well in upper-division classes and stuff.

santacruz,fmq9kth,t1_fmq94s3,1586295450.0,"Bro it's not like every young or low risk persons just gonna give it to another young person OR that they don't require hospitalization. Here's an excerpt from an article because you're an imbecile and can't learn this by yourself.  

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that among those age 20 to 44 with coronavirus in the U.S. from Feb. 12 to March 16, 14% to 20% were hospitalized.

Although that's a lower percent range than those above age 65, which ranges from 28.6% to 70.3%, it's still a large chunk. Two percent to four percent of those in the 20- to 44-year-old age category required admission to an intensive care unit. This findings show how anyone, regardless of age, can be a transmitter of COVID-19, as well as potentially develop serious symptoms, Nosal says.

Ventilator Risks

Many of the patients admitted to the hospital for coronavirus require the use of a ventilator, which comes with the risk of developing a bacterial pneumonia or other health problems connected to ventilator use, Gohil says.

There also are some reports of longer-term breathing difficulty among those who have recovered from COVID-19, she adds.

If you wanted to build herd immunity you would have to get it first dumbass. There is no vaccine to give you immunity. The R0 is 2-3, so you're just gonna end up spreading it to more people. Sure quote some studying affirming your view, but if you just think about it a bit critically and not just say ""wow some renowned scientist said this"" instead of following the advice of the rest of the medical community. You're gonna support your family by not giving them covid. It's not that hard. It really isn't difficult to understand if you're brain isn't smooth. Fuck you know about herd immunity lmaoooo, you being out and increasing your chances of being infected does not give herd immunity.
