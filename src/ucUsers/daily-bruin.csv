ucla,fnn5t27,t1_fnmug4z,1587085038.0,"We are currently working on a story about graduate student tests, such as the GRE, LSAT and MCAT. However, here is some additional information about standardized tests.

The June SAT has been cancelled. However, the College Board [announced](https://www.collegeboard.org/releases/2020/college-board-shares-plans-provide-students-opportunities-take-sat-2020) Wednesday that it will add a September test, in addition to the normal August, October, November and December tests, if it is safe. They may provide a digital version of the test if schools do not open in the fall.

The ACT has [postponed](http://www.act.org/content/act/en/covid-19.html) its April test to June, and is preparing a remote option for students to take the test at home. [Online](https://edsource.org/2020/sat-and-act-plan-at-home-college-admissions-exams-during-health-crisis/629182) versions of the test will be used in some testing centers starting in September.

ETS, the company that offers the [GRE](https://www.ets.org/s/cv/gre/the-americas/), is offering an at-home version of the test.

The [LSAT](https://www.lsac.org/update-coronavirus-and-lsat) is also being offered online starting in May.

[MCAT](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/coronavirus-mcat-faqs/) exams have been cancelled through May. - JS"
ucla,fnmc1wj,t1_fnm358j,1587068725.0,"Here's what our editorial board had to say about the university's response to pandemic:

When the outbreak first hit UCLA, the [board argued](https://dailybruin.com/2020/03/09/editorial-ucla-needs-to-follow-lead-of-other-universities-better-prepare-for-covid-19/) the university needed to follow the lead of other universities and immediately release contingency plans for remote education.

The board also commended UCLA for providing town halls, collaborating with student government and creating opportunities for students to voice their opinions on myUCLA. But, [it urged](https://dailybruin.com/2020/04/02/editorial-uc-community-deserves-communication-and-action-from-regents-amid-pandemic/) the UC Regents to make themselves more transparent and available to the UC community at this time.

Finally, editorial board [said](https://dailybruin.com/2020/03/09/editorial-ucla-needs-to-follow-lead-of-other-universities-better-prepare-for-covid-19/) seniors deserve more than just an online commencement.We want to hear from you too.

ucla,fnm937p,t1_fnm20td,1587067223.0,"And from Jintak Han, our news reporter and staff photographer:

PPE is necessary to cover the pandemic in the field. I was fortunate enough to have the protective equipment left over from last year’s wildfires, but most of the reporters in DB don’t have the equipment and have to report remotely. For photographers, that severely limits what we can do.

My field reporting has been focusing more on things going on outside Westwood. Most pandemic-related developments occur at the city/county/state level, so I’ve been photographing how Angelenos around the city have been responding to the pandemic.

Campus and Westwood-related coverage has mostly been remote, but I’ve been trying to field interviews from the ground where possible. With most students not in Westwood it’s sometimes hard to find a student to interview. Stores in the village have been eager to share their perspectives since we’re all trying to figure out how this is playing out.

But most reporters are doing their work remotely right now, finding people on social media, doing phone interviews etc. - JH"
ucla,fnm8yu7,t1_fnm20td,1587067162.0,"The pandemic uprooted any semblance of normal life, and unfortunately, our newsroom was not spared from the outbreak's effects either. We ceased print production for the rest of the 2019-2020 school year; we're a digital-only paper now. It doesn't really make sense to continue printing 6,000 copies a day without any students on campus. The last time we scaled back print production was [during World War II](https://dailybruin.com/2020/04/09/press-pass-looking-back-on-when-the-daily-bruin-reduced-print-production-during-world-war-ii/).

Though, aside from spending hours inside Kerckhoff 118, remote production hasn't been that different. Normally, we publish stories for the following day late into the night as we send our paper off to the printer. Now, stories are going up throughout the day. Each section is still finalizing its stories at around noon each day, and our amount of time on Slack has not decreased by any means.

And without a print paper, we've had the opportunity to expand our storytelling to digital platforms. We made a [dashboard](https://features.dailybruin.com/2020/covid-19/) hosting everything you need to know about the outbreak and UCLA, from Westwood business hours to the number of cases related to the university. Also, we launched a [storytelling hub](https://covidstories.dailybruin.com/) where you can tell us how the outbreak is affecting your life, and hear from other students too. - KH"
