IncelTear,fpekgoz,t1_fpcjiuw,1588549282.0,There have been 6 Indian miss worlds!! The audacity of this “man”
IncelTear,fpekdbv,t3_gco6jl,1588549229.0,Uh there have been quite a few Indian Miss Worlds (6 I believe). I’m an Indian American woman and have never had trouble getting guys. I know I’m beautiful and I know my worth. Fuck off you pathetic waste of space.

UCDavis,fozxeeo,t1_fouo8pa,1588198571.0,The bathrooms really aren’t bad at all. I used to hate public bathrooms and now I don’t mind at all. They’re really clean

LongDistance,fnvmik8,t1_fnnyx9a,1587298600.0,I’m glad all of that still works!!
AnimalCrossing,fnvm9y3,t1_fnvfa7x,1587298372.0,Yay
AnimalCrossing,fnup5bo,t3_g0rw06,1587267517.0,I'm getting NL because I can't afford a switch and already have a 3DS
AnimalCrossing,fnuoeqw,t1_fntg95r,1587266992.0,I think it resembles her very well
AnimalCrossing,fnuodj2,t3_g3sccg,1587266968.0,This is amazing

LongDistance,fnthaw0,t3_g3g9k6,1587241643.0,I’m actually perfectly fine. Not sure why
LongDistance,fnny6a4,t1_fnnxxti,1587105458.0,Ohhh that makes sense.
LongDistance,fnnxnal,t1_fnntriz,1587104961.0,"I hope this doesn’t come off as ignorant, but how do you maintain a ldr with him without Internet?"
UCDavis,fnkbskv,t1_fnk2meg,1587021310.0,"You’re doing the right thing by asking current Davis students, although Reddit may not have the most diverse set of students here. It’s smart to talk to people attending the university instead of relying on the Davis site alone."
UCDavis,fnjv1in,t1_fnixwfr,1587007656.0,"Yeah, I hope school opens back up again. I would hate for freshmen to not get the college freshman experience, it’s amazing and I wish mine didn’t get cut short."
LDR,fnir69e,t3_g0zbe5,1586984917.0,"I’m so glad I ended my ldr before college started. I would’ve been so caught up in making time for him instead of focusing on the new amazing life that I had. I wanted to experience college and meet new people and go out and enjoy life rather than be tied to my screen. Him and I are both still friends, but we have our own significant others at our own colleges. I’m so happy with how it is now."
LDR,fnioioo,t3_g1yo1c,1586983572.0,I honestly don’t think social distancing will last that long. It’s not feasible.
UCDavis,fninlsb,t1_fnhmczc,1586983118.0,"And no, not all of us are just complaining about online learning because we complained about Davis in general. I absolutely love Davis and do well in school. I complain about online learning because while it’s a necessary evil, it sucks ass and I miss my life, my friends, my significant other, and going outside. Who doesn’t complain about the negative change online learning has brought on our lives???"
UCDavis,fninfqu,t1_fnhmczc,1586983034.0,Where else are they supposed to get opinions on the school? They can’t even leave their house.
UCDavis,fnina31,t1_fni7udt,1586982957.0,"We understand and don’t mind you all commenting at all. It’s just a bit funny seeing those posts about fall and dorms when it’s difficult to picture college going back to normal on the fall. It’s a difficult time for you hs seniors too :( Wish you the best of luck. 

Also, I kinda like it. Gives me a sense of normalcy. Like maybe things will be at least semi-normal"
UCDavis,fnilmjd,t1_fni01s1,1586982132.0,Fuck.
UCDavis,fnilifk,t1_fni09mx,1586982075.0,I’m sorry that really sucks :(. I hope you get 2 years of the college experience

UCDavis,fn1ak3r,t1_fmtllpq,1586558070.0,Could I see the email please? I’m not an engineering student but I’m planning to switch into engineering
LDR,fmbxmfd,t3_fu7qto,1585935088.0,Discord- you can share video and computer audio. Then have a video chat next to that such as on messenger
