YangForPresidentHQ,fp8qr1c,t1_fp8q5ly,1588399927.0,Ranked choice voting is the answer here
YangForPresidentHQ,fp65km1,t1_fp4y0rn,1588346478.0,"It is. But also, I live in a state that will go blue with 99% certainty. 

So I‚Äôm definitely voting but mostly because I care about down ballot stuff. 

Why note protest vote the presidential race? If third parties start getting higher % votes every cycle, they could eventually get taken seriously and then the whole dynamic changes. I‚Äôm not asking people in Michigan or Wisconsin to do it, but for people solidly in a red or blue state, why not?"
santacruz,fp4se0z,t1_fp4o48e,1588306184.0,"Nah man, I‚Äôm staying inside for the most part. Staying 6 feet+ apart from people when I go out. Taking all the precautions myself just like most people are. And nobody even had to call the cops on me! Amazing!"
santacruz,fp4n5sd,t1_fp42s4k,1588302719.0,"The case and fatality rates speak for themselves.

It also seems like going outside is genuinely good for helping stop the spread as the trend in research is indicating. 

This whole mandate is going to go over like a lead balloon. Try not to work up your blood pressure by looking outside at people having fun / calling the cops on them. It‚Äôs bad for your heath."
santacruz,fp3y0mr,t1_fp3qt7g,1588287927.0,"Yeah, no shit, people staying inside and socially distancing is helping. But that doesn't require people calling the cops on what they percieve to be violations. We've been doing great with state parks open and people self-regulating. If anything, this pandemic has demonstrated that our community is very good at taking precautions for themselves without harsh, legal enforcement. Now we want to close state parks and have people reporting their neighbors? Because we're doing so well? Some people are a little eager to give the cops and state more power. We don't need it."
santacruz,fp3b84c,t1_fp3akjf,1588276286.0,Nobody wants the spread of an infectious disease. Calling the cops to enforce stay at home orders in a county that is doing very well with regards to self-regulating and flattening the curve is very narc-y yes.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fp05p4q,t1_foz4bka,1588202969.0,"I mean, did you donate 60 cents?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fot95ot,t1_fot374x,1588047572.0,"People often donate more than they‚Äôd lose in taxes. Regarding PR, rich people make anonymous donations too. 

I heavily disagree with your first claim which sounds just like a gut feeling you have. But I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôd prove it. 

I‚Äôm not trying to defend billionaires because I especially love them or admire them. I just think it‚Äôs unrealistic to portray  them as particularly  bad people as evidenced by their wealth. I suspect there‚Äôs a lot more nuance to it. They‚Äôre just people.

I agree most of us should be paid more, but I imagine we probably disagree on how to get there. Anyway, fine to disagree on these things I guess! Be well"
BlackPeopleTwitter,foswxui,t1_fosmda4,1588039768.0,"Well I think the unfortunate truth is that most of us are past that threshold in some way. I‚Äôm technically below the poverty line in the US (but I don‚Äôt have to take care of anyone, live modestly, etc,). 

The truth is, I actually have some disposable income. I mostly choose to buy it on frivolous things. And a part of me knows, although I rarely think about it, I could save peoples lives with the money I‚Äôm spending on stupid shit.

I‚Äôm making a similar (similar not identical) decision as someone who is a millionaire and not giving most of it away. Like the consequences aren‚Äôt the same, but the state of mind is very similar. 

So I‚Äôm very hesitant to judge how people spend their money. And most billionaires give away loads and loads and loads of money. Like more money than I could make in a 100 lifetimes. 

I don‚Äôt know. Obviously people are greedy, but I think the demonization of billionaires is shortsighted."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fosa6he,t1_fos4f79,1588026772.0,"Sometimes people add substantial value to the lives of people around the planet because of their work and wind up billionaires. 

Its hard to parse out wether they were ‚Äúcaring about other people‚Äù or not during their work. But that‚Äôs true for most professions. Plenty of them are great people though.

I think it‚Äôs a bit myopic to portray them mostly as bad people. That‚Äôs just not realistic. If you‚Äôre an especially bar person, usually people don‚Äôt want to work with/for you. Of course there are famous exceptions to this."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fodqh1m,t1_fodfut8,1587688196.0,"Fair paint. That‚Äôs probably why I like him so much. Except I think you can make the strong case that he has some authleft stuff because his policies would inherently centralize power at the federal level.

Authright is more of a challenge But maybe I can persuade you that he has some ‚Äúauthright‚Äù-ish values. He‚Äôs talked about the dangers of porn for instance. One of his polices was free marriage counseling for anyone that wants it. He generally has some traditional family values that seems to align him with people in that quadrant in some unexpected ways."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fobg8yt,t1_fobaoln,1587659476.0,Classically liberal
PoliticalCompassMemes,fobfu8g,t1_foahajg,1587659354.0,Would have been unbeatable in the general election imo. The trick is getting him past a party‚Äôs primary. We‚Äôll see.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fobf5kr,t1_fo9o5au,1587659162.0,Agreed. He takes the best parts of each quadrant. He‚Äôs not an ideologue at all. I supported his campaign very strongly. Hope we see more of him / people like him on the national scale.
