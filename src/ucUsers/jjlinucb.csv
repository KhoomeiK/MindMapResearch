berkeley,fpm9joz,t3_ge8nkz,1588728340.0,"If it is a change in parent situation, then all you need to do is file the Parent Contribution Appeal (PCA) on Calcentral. I've done it before and it works pretty smoothly as long as you provide the correct documentation. (Which should be very feasible). And when I had to do this, I found that you had to go in person to try to push your case along but I am sure it will be different due to corona and not as many people requesting in-person meetings. The best thing to do is to contact the financial aid office. The PCA also is very nice in that it changes your aid and gives you a new package and it won't be cut short if you are late. So if you get the appeal in August (because you submitted by July (takes 1-1.5 months for the entire process)), yeah you might have to pay a bit before they disperse, but you will get the full amount by the end of September."
berkeley,fpm8zz3,t3_ge9eav,1588728017.0,"It weighted by the amount of points you get per unit. So if you got an A (4.0) in a 4 units class then you get 4.0 \* 4 units = 16. And if you get a B (3.0) in a 3 unit class, then it becomes (4\*4+3\*3)/(4+3) as you have taken 7 units total. P/NP units don't go into the equation at all so they have no effect on GPA."
berkeley,fpm6izv,t3_gea2x8,1588726573.0,"Well, canceling the test might affect your chances but doing poorly on them probably won't matter. Because at least you show effort because you are trying to take them. You also paid a lot for the tests so it would be a waste of money. But if you don't want to go through with it, you can email [nss@berkeley.edu](mailto:nss@berkeley.edu) and ask them to connect you with your adviser. Hope this helps :)"
berkeley,fpkle5v,t1_fpk6jt7,1588696758.0,"To score well? No? I think it was fairly paced if that is the only class you are taking and you will have time to finish the labs and to just get really deep into the material and learn it well. So I wouldn't worry about that part of the class. Keeping the motivation up during the summer might be difficult though.

I don't think they look at CS61B vs CS61BL differently for TA positions. Both classes will teach you a lot."
berkeley,fpk5l41,t3_gduk5a,1588688427.0,"I think this pandemic and really events like these really give us some insight on how frail a human life is. About how we really have so little control over anything. And I think it's good to stop and think and realize that yeah, it could have been any one of us and we really don't have the power to dictate what happens in our life. There's a lot of evil in this world and I think it's really rare that you have really empathized with this situation because I'm sure a lot of people have become numb to news like this just by going through life."
berkeley,fpk52ah,t3_gdrpzu,1588688140.0,"If all the extra credit and all the buckets are set then there probably won't be a bin shift since they already released the grades. So I guess it depends because it seems like they determined your grade already based on the bins.

But no, you can't do anything except pray for a bin shift I guess."
berkeley,fpk4v9c,t3_gds099,1588688032.0,The 13in Mac Pro is more than solid enough for everything that you need to do in college. A larger screen would be better if you had an at-home monitor but you would find it hard to take notes on a laptop on those tiny desks in lecture halls.
berkeley,fpk4pgj,t3_gdsaxe,1588687942.0,"Up to you. AP Calc can't help you skip the 16 series but it might be helpful to have the option to skip the 1A/B series and take a stats class. If you are not doing stem, then there is not that much point in Chem either."
berkeley,fpk4hf2,t3_gdsipf,1588687813.0,You can do it. If you are confident in your math skills then I would say 54 and 100 are not bad at all. Your tough class would be CS61B but it seems like you wanted to devote most of your time to that class anyway.
berkeley,fpk4e91,t3_gdu6bt,1588687763.0,Berkeley doesn't give you that information. You have to ask them who it is for you. [https://admissions.berkeley.edu/meet-your-admissions-officer](https://admissions.berkeley.edu/meet-your-admissions-officer)
berkeley,fpk4678,t3_gduszz,1588687632.0,I took it over the summer and most of it was online. The hardest thing would be that there is no in-person office hour to look over your code but the TA's are pouring their hearts into this class and they do a whole lot to make it fun and so engaging. It made taking Cs61BL over the summer really fun.
berkeley,fpk2okf,t1_fpitk04,1588686766.0,nss@berkeley.edu is the email you can use to contact NSS (New Student Services). They run GBO as well has help with incoming students so they can help connect you with the right people.
berkeley,fpisotm,t3_gdnb7e,1588647836.0,"To be honest, I think Berkeley's DS program is pretty hot right now, and it would be beneficial to join at a good time. I would encourage you to come to Cal."
berkeley,fpisiot,t3_gdnji7,1588647728.0,"Hmm, I'm not completely sure but it is just going to be one of those things you need to call up an administration about. I think they should transfer but it is year to year and could change. Regardless, an advisor should be able to let you know without much trouble. You can email [nss@berkeley.edu](mailto:nss@berkeley.edu) if you want :)"
berkeley,fpis3pa,t3_gdoqrp,1588647466.0,"Getting rejected form URAP happens quite often and you should not bank on it for a research opportunity. Instead, you should try other avenues along with URAP like messaging a professor or a GSI directly after taking a class with them. But for URAP, they will consider GPA because they don't want research to take away from your academics. So having a higher GPA does boost your chances."
berkeley,fpgisrl,t3_gd5dnf,1588603543.0,It depends on your previous coding experience. I know a few people who took CS61B before CS61A and it was fine. But you will probably get into CS61A. You just have to wait a bit which I guess is really hard in this current anxiety-inducing time. But you can take CS70 if you want whenever as you don't need CS61A/B for that class.
berkeley,fpgij4x,t3_gd5ee7,1588603395.0,"It is a thing for upper divs but to be honest, I actually think there is grade inflation because for physics, sometimes, the final average is <50% and well, not everyone can get an F. And for CS too, I think that you on average get around 60-70% on a test and if hit around 80% that's really good."
berkeley,fpggh1p,t3_gd7ung,1588602220.0,"The class that will really take a lot of time would be CS61C. I think it's a lot harder than 61A/B but totally doable with another tech. I don't think it would be that fun of a summer tbh but I think it is doable. CS61C in the summer goes really fast and it's 3 tests and 4 projects so that's like one big assignment a week... on top of whatever Data will be assigning.

If you are confident in your coding ability from 61A/B, I think you should be able to keep Data 100 at the back of your mind. But CS61C is very different from 61A/B and so it could be really tough or challenging."
berkeley,fpfdg89,t3_gd1m1y,1588568049.0,"Well, it is planned for in-person as of now. It has a good chance of being online and that would mean going through some online modules. It is not about getting you prepared for Cal classes but more about helping you settle in and making friends. It is not mandatory except for the Bear Pact event but you will be paying for it. Although, a good amount of the cost of GBO is the cost of living on campus so if you are going to do online Fall semester, that will save some money on GBO."
berkeley,fpfd6jj,t3_gd2ukk,1588567837.0,"After 110, 54 would be a real joke actually. And you can take it and receive credit. Maybe you can even talk to the professor and advisor and just take the tests and get the credit for the class not even take the class."
berkeley,fpdrity,t3_gcei1p,1588532774.0,"Well, on interviews, they know you don't have that much previous experience so they will ask you about your CS projects. Being a TA definitely helps because you can explain a project much more deeply showing that you actually know your stuff. So in that regard, I think it is really helpful. It's always a good way to try to understand something by being able to teach it. I don't think they will ask you about that experience tbh but it's what you get out of TAing knowledge that can really help."
berkeley,fpdr1kk,t3_gckwsd,1588532499.0,"Start in the summer. Actually, this is kind of hard if you don't have motivation. Like, if you don't have it, you can't hype yourself up and pretend you do. That won't work. What is necessary, is an outside force that is willing to come and help and keep you accountable. Hopefully, you can ask a friend of yours that you know is more disciplined and they can help you be on top of things. After a month, their habit of discipline will rub off on you. That's one way to develop a habit, spend time with people with good habits."
berkeley,fpdok36,t3_gcmwmu,1588531085.0,I think you can get a head start on learning linked lists. I think that part of the course has the hardest learning curve. So this will give you some buffer space and allow you digest the other material better.
berkeley,fp48anp,t3_gb7gtu,1588293696.0,Let the excellent be excellent and let the ones who would rejoice over getting an A rejoice over that A.
berkeley,fp2bfu0,t3_gapxkm,1588258798.0,"Currently, there is a plan to have it in person though I am sure eventually that might get axed. Then, if it really is online, it probably will not cost much.

The grants just help with paying so it really doesn't matter what it ends up getting used for. If it covers GBO great, but that means it covers less tuition or something else. But if you have enough to cover everything and more, then you probably don't need to worry about it.

You don't have to attend each and every one of these activities.

It's up to you because GBO has been getting better and more fun over the years but there's still a lot of people that think it's a waste of time and money. And there are a lot of people that love it so it really depends on you."
berkeley,fp29z7f,t3_gatvnj,1588258032.0,It will but you probably won't need it. There's a good amount of classes for you to take so you'll probably pass 120 units.
berkeley,fp29qwt,t3_gaszlo,1588257908.0,Probably CS61C but I'm not sure how online labs for EE16A are gonna work in the fall.
berkeley,fp0xaz6,t3_gakgwl,1588219028.0,I believe that they are usually willing to give students an extra semester because there are things that can happen in 4 years that delay a student (such as right now) so I'm sure they would be willing.
berkeley,fp0x1yu,t3_ganc8o,1588218863.0,They normally do but unsure if you can do right after you take it. If it was a semester then for sure but it forms might be closed for the summer already.
berkeley,foyczqu,t3_ga3iaq,1588170250.0,"I have a friend who is double majoring in CS and Stats, decided to get stats after sophomore year so I can relay any questions you have to him. He is a senior this year for reference."
berkeley,foycsq1,t3_ga2u6k,1588170145.0,"Yup, you still have to take it. Unless, and I've only heard a few cases for this but an advisor can allow you to take a harder upper dive math class like Math 104,110,185,121a, as a substitute for Math 1B, but that ""math class"" still has to be taken. You won't be exempt."
berkeley,foychwz,t3_ga7q54,1588169983.0,"Yeah, they can. Not that they will but they might."
berkeley,foyceww,t3_ga82wc,1588169938.0,They are pretty unrelated but 54 is super foundational knowledge for a good 70% of all future stem classes so you should learn it really well.
berkeley,fowmd7r,t3_g9wth5,1588122633.0,"There's a lot to go on here and a lot to read online that I am sure with even one hour of googling you will find useful tips.

I think the most important one is environment and that you should not work next to your bed because your body associates bed with sleep and you will get tired. As well as not taking your phone to bed, I actually leave it outside my bedroom on the floor and pick it up in the morning so my brain doesn't associate my bed with staying away or my phone with sleep. So when I work I work and when I sleep I sleep and I'm not stuck in some limbo state where I want to work but feel tired and when I want to sleep I'm restless.

A lot of productivity tips also happen to go hand in hand with sleep hygiene tips."
berkeley,fovio06,t3_g9szor,1588101968.0,That seems like a pretty rigorous schedule and seems really prone to having projects stack up and then you find yourself just unable to make deadlines work. It's probably all you are going to have time for next semester and I would not recommend taking another class unless you need a 1 unit decal or something for a unit cap.
berkeley,fovic5m,t3_g9thtk,1588101809.0,"If you fail, or NP this semester, then you can take it for a letter grade next semester (or in the future) and that grade will simply replace this grade for your GPA. It will show on the transcript but getting a NP is waaay better than getting an F which you can also make up but then the GPA is the average of the two. This way, you get to keep your new grade without any consequences."
berkeley,fovi6p1,t3_g9tldi,1588101735.0,"I once had 3 finals on the same day and emailed all my professors and one of them was willing to change. I doubt they will allow you to change it for two even if they are back to back but don't worry, multiple people had done it and survived and I'm sure you will too."
berkeley,fovhmcg,t3_g9scal,1588101461.0,Math 110 is really rewarding and really solid for any future class because everything in this world is a linear mapping of one thing to another and being able to get that concept down is extremely useful for many classes.
berkeley,fovhidw,t3_g9qvaj,1588101407.0,"Well some of the course work for CS61A and CS61B is repeated every semester and all that stuff is online so you can get a super head start if you wanted. CS70 would be hard to prepare for as it really isn't about the material but more about training you how to think like a coder which takes time and practice. It's like riding a bike or working out, you have to slowly build up your ability to think in CS70 so doing a little bit here and there probably won't help. You would have to immerse yourself with a lot of CS70 (like audit it and keep up with it) to really get better for when you actually take it."
berkeley,fovh3iv,t3_g9s61l,1588101209.0,"CS70 and EE16B are going to very similar in it's difficult and boring Psets (though you do learn a lot) and so it might feel really boring and repetitive. CS61C is a good amount of coding and it might be good to mix it up. Would you consider CS61C and EE61B? or did you want to take C70 next semester to declare CS? But either way, both are totally doable. It should not be overwhelming as long as your breaths are not super time consuming."
berkeley,fovgrqv,t3_g9sely,1588101051.0,"to be honest, play a game or something as you wait"
berkeley,fouh0sb,t3_g9jx5b,1588083910.0,"Physics 7C is totally doable over the summer. You'll probably learn a lot of physics that you never thought about really fast so there might be a learning curve. And you can squeeze in R1A too but you are probably going to hate reading and writing after that summer, unless you really like the R1A class and care to read everything and write a good essay and stuff."
berkeley,fougsre,t3_g9ib6q,1588083792.0,CS61B is best to be done alone in the summer unless you are really confident and have already learned the material through other means. You will need to focus all your time on it.
berkeley,fougj89,t3_g9mszr,1588083649.0,"It's doable if you feel confident in math and ok at CS. All those classes are going to fill up pretty quickly and the only ones that would be willing to expand would be data 8 and cs61b so you can pick your poison but if that breadth class can be taken another semester, maybe that would be better."
berkeley,fougcr7,t3_g9kdix,1588083553.0,It's like CS61B except that you are not supposed to finish the lab in lab. You are supposed to start beforehand and get checked off in lab. Or if you can't you have to finish it after lab and get it checked off next lab. So labs can double up. And the workload for a lab is a lot more but totally doable.

""Apparently foothill is the nerdy place full of rational people who like learning and I would have a better chance not getting a drug addict roommate if I went there."" mentality and we really had a good relationship. We informed each other of our schedules, talked about politics, religion, sex, race, and a whole variety of topics while playing cards against humanity and when needed kept to our half of the room if someone needed to sit down and do work."

berkeley,fotf3yf,t3_g9gr14,1588052101.0,"Foothill food is better but not good. It is very quiet at night, though of course, that depends on your roommates/suitemates.

I would say foothill is by far the safest place if there was a mob because when you have a large enough size, everything becomes a fluid. And what fluid flows uphill. 

Like, what mob of people suddenly think climbing stairs and going uphill is the way to go. It's always downhill. Nobody wants legs at 12-4am.

There is also generally less crime reported in Northside Berkeley.

But also, are those the ONLY 3 things you are concerned about? No other concerns like the closeness to campus or being away from your friends in different dorms? Because those might weigh in."
berkeley,forcfne,t3_g95hyz,1588009869.0,"I think people actually recommend taking more and go faster to save a year of tuition actually. Plus, with AP's you probably skip a lot of the intro classes anyway. This course load should not be something that is too much and a lot of CS people happen to double major in music too sometimes."
berkeley,forc5xe,t3_g8x7qu,1588009739.0,"Wow congrats! College of Chemistry is hard but it is true that the people there are die-hard Chemistry fans. (or they switch by sophomore year to CS). Housing does get worked out as long as you are trying. Relatively, the crimes that happen here have nothing to do with the students. Most of them have to do with the residents of Berkeley or the homeless people on the streets which might feel unsettling but they are pretty harmless imo. College of Chemistry has great research options (just ask the nice professors) though the lectures can seem pretty drab sometimes. The workload is hard but very rewarding. Sticking through with it will really give you a solid understanding of Chemistry."
berkeley,fora3o3,t3_g8u39q,1588008746.0,"I think Cal life can be what you want it to be. Not that it means that if you want to be iron man or captain marvel that you'll become that. But if you want community. It's there. If you want friends. It's there. You do have to look for them though. And if you want good grades, well, sometimes it's there haha. But one thing I think you will find that a lot of people (not everyone) is proud that they go to Cal. They look back and always think it was worth it. There is a strong sense of belonging that Cal was definitely the right school and the right place for them. And I think Cal, though difficult, has it's merits that it encourages people to grow and mature through hardship so they come out an adult who is really to join society as a contributing educated individual. I would never trade this for another college."
berkeley,for86s9,t3_g8utt4,1588007821.0,"I think the Mech E classes are really fun at Cal even though you take too many of them at the same time for you to get everything out of them. However, for the program, I think you really get a solid education at Berkeley with Mech E and there is a lot of prestige finishing the program here."
berkeley,for6wis,t3_g8x69l,1588007196.0,"CS online is pretty much ok. It is doable for a lot of us, not much different tbh. But I think that you might miss out on some community here because some people are still going to be coming up to CAL and live on/near campus. That might not be a huge draw for you since it is your first semester but it is important to not do college alone at CAL. But if it is hard on your parents, then maybe you should stay back and help them.

You will definitely still be able to find housing in the spring."
berkeley,for2mzr,t3_g8scgu,1588005122.0,"For the summer, I think that it takes about 20-25 hours a week if you are doing all the work, and so you could stretch yourself by doing a part-time job but probably not a full time one. But if you are looking to ""pass"" the class, you can do it with only spending 10-12 hours a week on it."
berkeley,for2cjg,t3_g8s13b,1588004977.0,"It can go either way. I would argue that you go random in Unit 4/Foothill, your chances of getting a roommate who is quieter and keeps to himself rather than Unit 1,2,3 where I have had friends tell me their roommates where constant drug addicts and it made his room unlivable and he had to crash at a friends place for most of the semester. But that was just an especially unfortunate case. Most roommates are going to be chill and looking to make rooming with another person work.

I also helped a lot of my friends who took it in the fall 2019 semester right after I took it and I would say that it just depends on your workload for the semester. You definitely get a lot out of that summer class if you put all your focus on it. And you will have time to chill and relax over the summer without being overwhelmed by this class."
berkeley,for1ke3,t3_g8x7jy,1588004587.0,"Stat 88 is a lot better. Stats 20 I feel like is like a more annoying AP Stats class and there are no prerequisites for either. Well, Stats 88 (one semester of calculus at the level of Math 16A, Math 10A, or Math 1A) but that won't prevent you from enrolling and AP Calc will suffice just fine."
berkeley,for0zfg,t3_g92e15,1588004293.0,"If you are talking about your green drop then you can only use that once. For the form, it's not a big deal. It might not be approved for the 2nd time but still allow you to ""submit"". Regardless, when it comes to a heavy issue like dropping a class, if there is any confusion, a school admin would be able to make the correct changes even after deadlines as long as they are on the same page as you.

R1B is a good amount of work but I don't think it will take that much focus away from doing well in 16A and 70. If you can keep yourself from waiting until two days before the Psets are due, it is definitely manageable."
berkeley,foiu5od,t3_g7nyv5,1587797107.0,"Implicitly curved means that they know how people will do on average in the class.

They have enough data from previous semesters to judge whether a question is too difficult or too easy or just right enough. And with a class size that large, they can predict the average and the standard deviation. 

So in that sense, they can make the class as hard as they want or as easy as they want to get the results they are looking for because they know how the students will perform on average in the class. When you have enough data, this becomes really easy. Plus, the professors are really smart and have taught this class so many times that they have a feel for what questions will stump students and what won't. 

So no, it is not curved but what ends up happening is that there is going to be a normal distribution right around the average of what the instructors want for a semester. And in doing so, they will get a distribution is X% A's and Y% B's and so on."
berkeley,foitqzh,t3_g7oe2h,1587796732.0,"I think if those are just your two techs for the semester then it'll be ok. Both I think, are harder because of them being online.

For CS61B, partner projects can become really hard and without the help of TA's on the project, it can become tedious. But I do suppose CS61B is going to try really hard to give the students the support they need as well as change the course to adapt to fully remote teaching like CSW186. 

Math 54 builds on itself so it starts off slow but if you get behind it will soon feel like an insurmountable mountain so you have to have some structure in place to make sure you are not falling behind. I would say that this class won't be too much different online since the material follows a lot from the book. 

But that's my take. Keep asking around and decide after hearing other people's experiences."
berkeley,foie6ux,t3_g7hqfj,1587784578.0,"E7 is really easy enough if you already have coding experience. If you have extensive coding experience then it should be very chill.

Bio1B is like a harder AP Bio though I realize how subjective this is because people have very different AP Bio experiences. But the material is the same so it's just a refresher.

So it can definitely be done, and quite easily too if you have enough prep beforehand."
berkeley,foidamc,t3_g7lrlw,1587783999.0,"okay, breathe in, breathe out. Relax. It's not going to be a problem.

I hope that intro didn't come off the wrong way by telling someone to relax when they can't. Mental health is no joke and needs to be taken seriously. But let's take a small walk together towards some possible scenarios.

1. you don't get caught because you didn't cheat so how could you get caught right? So no worries there
2. you get an email about academic dishonesty asking to explain yourself but you didn't cheat so you can reply with complete honesty that you didn't and that's that. They won't even email you if they don't have good evidence for you cheating. Berkeley is still under the idea of. ""innocent until proven guilty"" and well for CS, these use some super legit plagiarism software that UC Berkeley and other schools to check for similarities. It's basically Turnitin for code and it's **very very good.** 
3.  They read into your email because they have so much time in the world and they are just out there trying to get you. When you say it like that, it really seems too unreasonable to be true. **No, they won't read into your email.** It's not one person going over with a magnifying glass trying to prove you are a cheater or anything. These people have lives too and their goal in life is definitely not to ruin students.

Is this class you are dropping a HW in a Stem or CS class? In most classes, they just give you one or (if they are nice) two free HW drops. So in those cases, your grade would not be impacted at all."
berkeley,fofnwra,t3_g79cpy,1587739670.0,"Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. It is tough with the pandemic and I think around right now is when bad habits really come back and it's super hard to focus. But for me, there is some motivation to do work. 

I'm of the opinion that work is good and naturally, we want at least some sort of work to do. Like, why don't you try this? No phone. No laptop. Just you on a chair and you can think about whatever you want and you can get up to move around but you can't leave the room or interact with the room. You are just supposed to sit there and think for an hour. I think even by the 5 min mark you'll realize that you want to do something. 

And it's not that classes have gotten harder, there no travel time now, so it really is just about being able to be productive in small bursts. Maybe only an hour at a time. Like turning off your phone from 1-2pm and trying to get work done during that time."
berkeley,fofknnq,t3_g6w3l6,1587737889.0,I just know that you have to be above a 2.0 which means you are fine.
berkeley,fofk1zh,t3_g6rwvu,1587737541.0,"Oh man, I guess I'll miss out on those AC transit bus rides where tens of people get crammed into a bus for a few minutes at a time. Honestly, those should be refunded since people probably won't be willing to get on a bus during fall semester if there are still some social distancing restrictions due to the lack of a vaccine."
berkeley,fofj4za,t3_g73hce,1587736994.0,"So here's a good website to gauge where the class is. [https://www.berkeleytime.com/enrollment](https://www.berkeleytime.com/enrollment), you can select ENE/RES C176 and see that only 57.7% of the seats are taken so there are about 93 seats left.  


1. After June 20, everyone has equal enrolling, those students had a priority until June 20th and they did capitalize on it and now, this class is open to everyone.
2. In this case, some classes have different algorithms. And the number of discussion seats might not always add up to the number of lecture seats. My best guess is that student A will get enrolled before student B even if student B has a schedule that fits to the person the dropped out of the class. But I don't know how that would work.
3. So if nothing changes no one else that is an EEP student enrolls, then you are definitely going to get in because there are 93 seats and your waitlist is 45."
berkeley,fofhh79,t3_g77anh,1587735985.0,"It really is up to other classes and your desire to code I guess. Like with CS61B and Data 100, you are going to be coding a lot and that could be difficult because sometimes, you work 4 hours on a project and get nowhere. And CS61B and Data 100 work can stack up. But CS70 has no coding and it is learning a lot of math so it doesn't really fit like a CS class in that sense. 

Regardless, you can sign up for CS61B and Data 100 in the fall and if you feel like it is too much, then you can drop Data 100 and go take it in the spring. I think Data 100 will feel much easier after the rigorous coding you do in CS61B so that might be something to consider."
berkeley,fodp3ri,t3_g6g97b,1587687448.0,"Compared to previous semesters, 186 will probably be W186 which means it will be completely online and when I took it last semester they did add a new project and so that did make the workload more, however, I don't think it's on the level of 170 or 162.

This would be my ranking.

Hardest: 170+162+186 (would not quite recommend this unless this is all you are doing, not even an extra breath on the side, though if you are in L&S, this doesn't meet the unit cap requirement of 13 units)

Hard: 170+162 (tons of people do this and you have people who walk out fine and others who say that the semester was the worst thing that happened to them, so idk)

Doable: 162+186

Doable: 186+170"
berkeley,focpcg8,t3_g6p5sq,1587674115.0,"Yeah, this is hard. It's hard trying to focus on stuff right now when it feels like all the days are merging into one and it feels like one day it will be finals and I won't even care. So I implemented some stuff to help keep me focused.

One thing I've done is to choose someone that I trust to keep me accountable. And the rule is that if I watch twitch, youtube, or whatever media that is preventing me from focusing, then I have to give him $20. And it's hard but it's really effective. 

Another is that I work far from my bed so I'm not tempted to crawl back into it because that's a struggle sometimes. I hope you have a place where you can do something like this. I think it's really helpful just to get me out of the environment.

Also, I have some apps that just limit my phone time because I really don't need it since I'm on my laptop now for most things and my phone is pretty much just a distraction.

Hope this helps! Feel free to reach out and chat! Talking with people and keep old/making new connections is a good way to not make every day feel monotone. :)"
berkeley,fochp5p,t1_fo9e248,1587671448.0,Hi! I'm a physics major at Cal! And I am going to graduate as a physics major. I'd be super willing to answer your questions on what classes you'll be taking as I will have probably taken all of them hahaha. I would say it is hard but you'll have peers to struggle through the problem sets together and it's definitely manageable.
