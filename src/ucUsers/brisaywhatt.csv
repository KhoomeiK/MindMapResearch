politics,fpb0rro,t1_fpb0l3u,1588459698.0,I don’t mind! They were in their 60s. I know it seems strange calling them “cousin” but that’s how everyone in my family addresses each other outside of grandma and grandpa.
politics,fpazjnk,t1_fpasyt3,1588458981.0,"I’ve lost two cousins to it back East (I’m in CA, they’re in OH) with a third in critical condition. It’s truly maddening watching these idiots ignore what’s going on and demand the working class risk their lives for their “comfort”."
ABoringDystopia,fp0ogni,t3_ga7wiw,1588213445.0,I owe $8000 on an ER visit for a severe allergic reaction where they gave me Benadryl......Yupp $8000 for Benadryl. Love America.
GenderCritical,fozxhw7,t1_fozs2ne,1588198621.0,"I want to second Community College!! Going to my local CC was the best decision I ever made and after two years I transferred to a 4 year university. CC gets a bad wrap because it’s not “glamorous” but I can assure you, it’s a worthwhile experience and education. You can also explain the gap by saying you were caretaking for a sick relative or had a “personal medical issue that has since been resolved”."
UCDavis,foxm9n2,t3_ga0mi4,1588148524.0,"Check out F Street dispensary! Located in downtown Davis and always worth the trip. You’ll be able to find people to smoke with. My solution has been to stick to edibles while on campus and smoke at home, but I commute so I’ve got much more freedom in that regard. Even though campus is smoke free it’s still genuinely welcoming to cannabis. Just two months ago there was a lecture hosted by the Leadership center that centered around the promising future of working in the cannabis industry!"
UCDavis,foxfgyb,t3_ga1h1s,1588142382.0,"I’m honestly surprised the professor had an 8 am midterm despite the remote instruction, and I’m so sorry you’re in this situation OP. Do you know if they’ll be offering any extra credit? What was your grade prior to the midterm? If you explain your situation and your SD contract maybe they’ll work with you a little more? In my opinion, Professors should be guided to give lenience this quarter given the state of the world. Unfortunately, that’s not life. Are you black, Native American, or a Chicanx/Latinx student? If so, reach out to the executive director of your respective center, and they may be able to advocate for you."

CoronavirusRecession,fotm0wq,t3_g9ihql,1588058156.0,I completely agree. I actually just posted a link about a salon near me (CA) that is opening despite the Shelter in Place guidelines and it just seems foolish and destructive.

videos,fom2evd,t1_folpd22,1587876456.0,"Had this experience last night. I’ve got edible gummies that I eat with no issue but for some reason the one I ate last night fuuuuuucked me up. I think it had to do with being super stressed and my body just trying to come down hard. Regardless, it was a wild ride. Luckily only lasted about an hour and a half, time that I spent watching paint mixing videos and ordering bed sheets on Amazon apparently (got a bunch of shipping emails this afternoon lol)"
UCDavis,fom07ov,t3_g7j1u4,1587874805.0,"One of my Professors is coming to my wedding in January! (If I cant still have it, given everything lol). It’s definitely easier to get closer to your upper div Professors but, in my experience, they’ve all been genuinely happy to form a relationship!"
UCDavis,folzms9,t1_folxrl5,1587874377.0,"Part of the issue is Professors that just aren’t equipped to online teaching, and we really can’t blame them since they basically only had a week to get their curriculum adjusted. I’ve taken online classes before and never struggled this much honestly."
UCDavis,folzgmz,t3_g84sxq,1587874253.0,"I’m doing awful, and I feel bad because these are classes that I should be just fine in. I’m trying to turn things around but deadlines slip because they’re changed constantly, I’ve had lectures cancelled, I’m basically just learning from posted powerpoints, and it’s so hard to focus. Hang in there, you’re definitely not alone."
Marijuana,folt7q0,t1_fold483,1587869915.0,Definitely! I’ve also got some all cbd edibles that I’ll keep closer to me next time. Thank you!
Marijuana,folsyht,t1_fojeo24,1587869741.0,"Wow 15% is crazy! Oh yes my stress was definitely higher than usual when I took it. That’s honestly what I’ve settled on as the explanation, what I’m planning to do next time is taking half and waiting until I get a better hold on things. Thank you!"

Instead of keeping the American people informed, he completely disregarded the virus and turned it into race games. This is not what any leader would do."
CoronavirusMemes,fn3u08u,t1_fn3ti4n,1586627885.0,"I mean.............his response to the Pandemic wasn’t really a mistake. He intentionally hid it and downplayed it from the American population so he didn’t lose 2020 votes. That’s not a mistake, that’s a selfish and stupid action."
CoronavirusMemes,fn3t5os,t1_fn3q3gm,1586627413.0,"It has to do with their response I think. I agree, blaming them for the deaths with no context is foolish. However, Trumps late action and denial of COVID-19 and insistence that it was a “democratic hoax” almost certainly raised the death toll."

resumes,fn2otiq,t1_fn2oifb,1586597251.0,"
Did you have any extra curriculars while in college? Other than that, I know others have recommended tutoring and that’d be a great gig to take on right now. A lot of high school and college kids are really going to struggle with the new online format and could almost definitely use some extra help! I’m sorry you’ve had such a rough two years, depression is no joke. Good for you for taking the initial steps to get back out there though, it will pay off!"
resumes,fn2ocp9,t3_fyr91r,1586596707.0,"Did you participate in any clubs during your time at school? Or even as you took CC classes? If yes, that’s a good way to beef up your resume a bit."
resumes,fn2o7l6,t1_fn27smw,1586596543.0,"Volunteering is a great way to gain skills in your field if you’re not constrained financially. If OP has been able to survive the past two years without a paycheck, they don’t have to take whatever job calls back first. With volunteering you network, gain experience, hard and soft skills, and it speaks to your character. Why get a job in retail or at a restaurant-which has very little overlap to your hopeful profession-if you don’t have to?"
UCDavis,fn0xj4z,t3_fynqlh,1586550688.0,Nah you’ll be fine. I commute from Suisun and I use Jump bikes because I like riding them but it’s not at all necessary. I’ve walked from one end of the campus to the other multiple times with no issue. Just allow yourself extra time to get from your car to your class.
LifeProTips,fmy2fzz,t3_fxu66b,1586476695.0,"Can you use this on a resume? Also, how would you? I’m planning on doing Harvard Extension after I finish my Bachelors and work for a bit but I’d love to dip my toes into the curriculum already."
UCDavis,fmutqmy,t3_fxi3fo,1586398684.0,"Don’t sweat it, it seems like her frustration kind of boiled over and projected onto you. I got into Berkeley too and chose Davis because it’s such a welcoming and engaging campus. Also, fuck them Berkeley hills lol."
bayarea,fmmr0o4,t1_fmlzq7y,1586210421.0,"Seriously...My mom has a high school friend that moved to Florida and thinks this is all a “hoax”. She let her daughter have a sleepover, posted it all over Facebook, and said it was fine because it was under the max number for a gathering. A few days later, her daughter woke up with a 104 degree fever and a horrible cough.........she’s been completely silent on Social Media since that last post. I hope that her daughter makes a full recovery but it’s so hard to not judge her decisions as a mom. Jeopardizing your child’s safety just to prove a point....."
