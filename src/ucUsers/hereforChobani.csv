DavidDobrik,fpkzzo4,t3_gckwqq,1588703970.0,"This whole list is whack.
*This list reflects newbies who don’t know the OG vlogs/characters*, cause there are way too many OGs that are so damn low (Big Nik, Corinna, Gabbie). David’s even talked about how much the OGs mean to him, he wouldn’t agree with this list 

Smh new viewers (like OP) just trash on the OG members cause they didn’t watch early enough to know them."
ucf,fpkei3d,t3_gdzq92,1588693220.0,"There are so many videos and channels that cover Calculus. Honestly just choose a YouTuber that you understand and enjoy, cause then watching their videos won’t be a drag

- Mess with the “internal” audio (how the computer should pick up your voice — should it be getting you voice from the mic on your headphones, or your computer speakers? Select the right option.)
- And mess with the “external” audio (what audio do you want to here? The audio from people on zoom? Or the audio from a YouTube video playing on your laptop?)

- Zoom sometimes messes it up, so just click through those options until you can hear everything right"
Purdue,fphk68t,t3_gd4f74,1588622711.0,"Aha I had the same time for the 800m as well! Yea you have a chance, but it’s a huge time commitment. You need to reach out to the coaches about how you can get involved.

 I tried to Walk-On as well, but with my major it was way too much. But 10/10 would recommend Run Club!! Run Club was the community I needed with a flexible level of commitment."
