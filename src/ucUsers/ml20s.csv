2. Learn game mechanics--all the nitty gritty about armor penetration, camouflage, spotting, etc. Note that some of this information may be outdated. For example, the dropoff in spotting check rate at long distances isn't in the game anymore.

3. Learn your tank, and common enemy vehicles--where to pen them, their view ranges, reloads, and gun handling (can you trade 2 for 1 versus them?), their camo, their speed (if he's unspotted for X seconds, roughly where could they be?), etc. Make sure you are using the current version of WoT to compare. tanks.gg and Armor Inspector are good for this.

4. Learn the maps. This will take the longest. Know the good positions for your tank and for enemy vehicles. Know the safe routes of approach. Know where your allies can spot people coming in so you won't be surprised. Know what situations call for pushing forward and which call for falling back.
