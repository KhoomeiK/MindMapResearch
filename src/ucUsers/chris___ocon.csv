It sucks, but we can't control the virus spread if we're not being social distant. Sucks though, most classes can't survive through remote learning such as that of the mechatronics course where you're building robots."

You can see it on the map that if you gained a considerable lead, the bot's speed increases considerably to keep up with you and pass you"
UCSC,fncy2a5,t3_g117lv,1586851254.0,"The village has large single rooms and three bathrooms per house which is a plus. Downside is that there's only one laundry spot and one house where you can cook, so if you're in the apartments A, B, or C, you would have to walk up and down the hill to get laundry and to cook food. Walls are extremely thin so you can hear everything from the other rooms. It's also a bit of a hassle to get out of the village because it's in this ""bowl"". Only way out is to go up the stairs which has close to 50 steps (like going from the first floor to the third floor) or to go up the hill near building A. It's very inexpensive though which is a plus, and single rooms for about 1,000 a month in Santa Cruz is really cheap. Well, cheap for Santa Cruz. I liked living there, but I would rather live in the dorms closer to the rest of campus for sure since it's more convenient to get to places from there."

UCSantaCruz,fn54kub,t3_fznj3w,1586655775.0,"Hello, I was 21 when I transferred from LACC/ELAC, if you choose to live on campus, they group all of the transfers into Porter, so you'll be living with older students in their mid 20s and early 30s more than likely (though not many 30s students lived on campus). There are single rooms at the Dorms and there are apartments with single rooms on campus, but demand is high and it's more likely that you may not get it, but still a possibility that you will.  It's more likely to get into these locations after having been on campus a year and made friends who will accept you into their apartment contracts on campus.

Off campus, you can look into the UCSC housing group on Facebook and UCSC also has a post listing for off campus housing.

Housing is a bit expensive at Santa Cruz. I paid $950 a month at a single room shared bathroom I used to stay at."
