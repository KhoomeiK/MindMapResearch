worldnews,fno0j4l,t1_fnnr1k5,1587107707.0,"It is actually. It’s called a Single-arm trial. Less reliable than other methods perhaps, but scientifically valid nonetheless:


A single arm prospective study means everyone enrolled in the clinical trial will be treated the same way.

If a prospective single arm study is focusing on a drug, the data has to show some indication that there is a benefit. In a single arm study everyone in the trial gets the drug or medicine, there are no results from people with a similar condition who don’t get the drug. As a result, there are no data to show that people with the condition have improved compared to those who didn’t get it.

To try to confirm that there was a positive effect scientists can approach the data in two ways:-

1) In a case where no improvement in condition is expected without treatment, measuring and comparing the persons status at the start, and measuring improvements over time, can be used.

2) An alternative approach is to compare the data gathered in the single arm prospective study with scientific data already accepted (usually published) for a comparable group that have not received the therapy."

news,fnn0ick,t1_fnmk2xf,1587081830.0,"These days even though only like 80% of lithium ion batteries can be recycled (I think it's actually in the 90% but a cursory search from 2017 pegged it at 80), the current path for large scale Lithium Ion batteries tends to go either from an old EV battery into a grid storage device, or directly into grid storage. Cars need a large percentage of their original capacity to keep the usefulness for most consumers, however once they are retired from a vehicle, they are upcycled into grid storage where they extend their useful life for even longer. And some of the poorly sourced stuff like cobalt, are being slowly being completely phased out of usage in modern battery chemistry.

PV panels themselves take resources to create, but the current research shows that the carbon used to create PV panels takes about 2 years of use to offset that, and the useful life is 20-30 years, while a petro based energy generation produces carbon it's entire life with lower energy conversion rates than solar.

Price is an issue of course, but that's just a matter of scale of time before solar + battery is going to outpace the price of dirtier sources of energy.

You make a good point about efficiency and using less power, but can't we do both? Can't we reduce usage, while also continue to move to better and cleaner sources of power (Not perfectly clean, but cleanER!). At least until the point where we can master fusion (if we ever do).

That's not even taking into consideration molten salt concentrated solar generation plants which are less intermittent, due to the molten salt able to be used even when dark.

There are going to be compromises, but this isn't a binary thing. People who want clean energy KNOW that these sources aren't perfect, and not 100% clean, but they are still better than things like oil, and coal. This shouldn't keep us from innovating, reducing usage, making things more efficient, and using the sun as a primary source of energy."

Economics,fncuipw,t1_fnb5sov,1586847663.0,"I’m hoping that one thing that us millenials can pass to Gen Z is the idea that perhaps taking out large student loans for college might not be the assumed path after graduating high school. Our generation had an unrelenting message about going to college at any cost. There just aren’t enough scholarships out there to fund a 4 year education for everyone, and those student debts will cripple many people financially long into their careers."
sandiego,fnans8r,t1_fn8h0wk,1586800685.0,"Vaccines take about 18+ months to produce safely, and since we won't know the exact strain of flu that will be rampant during the flu season, doctors do a best effort to try and identify the 2-4 strains that they think will most likely be going around. They produce the vaccine and distribute it across the country in preparation. Sometimes they are good predictors of the strain and lots of people are effectively immune from the seasonal flu (depending on a number of factors), other times they are way off on the strains that are going around and lot more people get sick and die.

The specific Covid 19 virus has been sequenced and they are currently developing a vaccine to target this particular strain. My understanding is that the structure of Covid-19 isn't likely to mutate much, and as such the vaccine will likely be a LOT more effective in preventing people from getting sick from it. 

I am not a doctor, so some of my interpretations could be off the mark, but this is the cliffs notes that I was able to gather from some research."

Not to mention that most of the delivery services are allowing you to request the delivery driver just drop off the food at your door so they don't add another person they have been in contact with. Then if you're doing a good job, you disinfect everything as it comes in the house before it touches any surfaces.

In addition ordering delivery is actually supporting local businesses who employ people just trying to get through these tough times. Churches bring together hundreds of people in a confined space to provide nothing but a speech that could have been delivered remotely into people's homes. You can even set up electronic donations if you are worried about your ridiculous tithing practices."

They will text, or online order anything they can to not have to talk on the phone, even if they are mostly ok in person. It's an odd phobia that a few people i've met suffer from. They don't come in and order because it takes longer to prepare, so that $3 service fee is worth it to them."

news,fn7b4xn,t1_fn78fgo,1586716850.0,"I am a security architect by trade but I don't specialize in risk management specifically so I'll do my best to summarize what i know about it. Depending on the level of requirements of your particular business, you will be required to abide by a certain level of PCI requirements. For example if you are a passthrough organization where you process transactions by taking credit card info but don't store it, you need to mostly just secure the network connection and receiving system that is doing the transactions. If you store information, you need to not only secure that system, but every network path or system that has any possibility of touching that system. You also might need to prove certain physical controls such as logging systems of individuals that get into the server rooms that store this data.

As for using a third party system to lie on PCI regulations, this will eventually catch up to an organization as if any company you work with requests a third party risk assessment of your PCI compliance, they will often times not rely on a questionnaire, but instead will use another independent body to do a PCI audit (which technically is required as part of most PCI compliant companies in the first place). This third party audit if they are worth their salt will expose the falsification and may lead to fines or banks refusing to do business with you.

If these companies only are accepting checks though, you aren't beholden to PCI, mostly at that point i believe you have to abide by any other applicable regulations that might apply to your particular region (CCPA, GDPR, NYDFS, etc...), which have their own set of requirements including things like yearly penetration tests or vulnerability assessments. I'm not a risk management expert, so some of my information might be a bit off, but this is a sort of general idea of the sorts of things you have to deal with when dealing with various methods of payment and types of personal data."

news,fn70huw,t1_fn6vr4c,1586710913.0,It’s usually just the price a company pays to use an outside payment processor. If they do it in house then they are beholden to PCI regulations which is a whole other rabbit hole. It’s easier to farm it out to a third party that will in turn charge a flat fee to be the payment middle man.
sandiego,fn1bsd7,t1_fn1738l,1586558771.0,"I think that's the big reason yes. But also because it doesn't rain as much there seem to be fewer storm drains, different types of storm drains that clog easier, and just overall planning that wasn't designed with much rainfall in mind. There's always a cost/benefit tradeoff when doing city development, and spending a ton of money planning for massive rain isn't prudent for a city that doesn't get much rainfall all year long."

sandiego,fn08g91,t1_fn07kwo,1586537315.0,"Having grown up in Portland Oregon for most of my life, some of the biggest differences I notice is that the roads don't have quite the same outwards slope to drain water on to the sides. The roads have substantial amounts of traffic on them all year long 24/7 so that they are more prone to grooves in the areas where the tires normally follow, creating areas for water to pool and cars to hydroplane. The fact that we tend to have larger chunks of time between rains, combined with the large amounts of traffic means more oil, brake dust, misc fluids that sit on the top of the pavement, only to become very slick when water hits them.

&#x200B;

All that being said, California drivers are just more aggressive, drive faster, drive more recklessly, and California BMWs don't come with a turn signal. All of this leads to bad situations when combined with the rain."

They apparently used the shared wall and eventually infested our kitchen. At night we would have a few hundred walking all over the place. We spoke to the neighbor and he said they had to be sprayed every few weeks or they'd come back. I started using diatomaceous earth all around the kitchen, in every cabinet, crevice, hole, and wall. After the first week we had a chunk of dead ones, after 2 weeks there were a ton dead all over the floor and counters, after a month or so i would only encounter one every couple of weeks.
