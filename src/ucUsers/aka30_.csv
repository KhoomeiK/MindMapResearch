UCSantaBarbara,fp4i4wj,t1_fp4gfda,1588299561.0,I do like the people in OSL and registering events and such is easy enough but their organization is garbage. Shoreline is honestly more complicated than the old site.

makinghiphop,fp0ipfs,t3_gadwvx,1588210061.0,New music that expands what I see as the possibility for creating. Or videos of people breaking down how they made something. Breakdowns are a great way to get new ideas or also if you need to be grounded and realize your favorite artists probably aren‚Äôt a whole lot more ‚Äúskilled‚Äù than you are. I remember watching the breakdown to Off Deez and CHASETHEMONEY showed it was 5 sounds lol. Like seeing that someone can make something so crazy with FIVE sounds? And it could be you with enough time? It‚Äôs promising.

TheWeeknd,fn4aizs,t3_fz7nmj,1586637401.0,I think it excited me because even though I loved Starboy it left some to be desired and there were a lot of safe choices made sonically and from a writing standpoint. After Hours feels just as polished but more true to the rugged story arc Abel built starting with Trilogy.
