Got a raise at the grocery store, all OT is DT, wife is still working as a nurse screening coronavirus patients, kid is great, don’t know anyone who’s even tested positive, let alone got sick. I think we’ve all had it and it was way more mild than a flu. The climate is great because all the assholes with cars have stopped commuting (I walk to work). I only wish it was actually more terminal since this world is still highly overpopulated."

sanfrancisco,fn8o40n,t1_fn8nnxh,1586746088.0,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Park,_San_Francisco?wprov=sfti1 delineates boundaries. It says “As defined by the San Francisco Planning Department, the neighborhood borders Diamond Heights to the northwest, along Diamond Heights Boulevard; Noe Valley to the north, along 30th Street; Bernal Heights to the east, along San Jose Avenue; and Outer Mission to the south, along Bosworth Street.” So BART, with its entrance on Bosworth street, is the gateway to the Glen Park neighborhood."
sanfrancisco,fn8n9ge,t3_g09jdy,1586745572.0,"No, it’s in Glen Park. Bosworth is the delineating line for the neighborhood and BART’s entrance is on that line. Stop trying to confuse people"
