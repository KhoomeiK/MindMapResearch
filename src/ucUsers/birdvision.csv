UCSantaBarbara,fpmsrby,t1_fpmm05a,1588740740.0,"Exceptions will certainly be made. If the rest of your application is up to snuff, taking a quarter or even a year P/NP in the middle of the most disruptive event in recent history will not preclude you from acceptance."
AskReddit,fpcysln,t1_fpcyjuj,1588516077.0,"I never sneered at anyone's behavior. Rationality has a strict economic definition and you don't meet it in the context of prospect theory.

These aren't axioms, they're better described as propositions."
AskReddit,fpcxuzm,t1_fpcxsnx,1588515455.0,Congrats. Abstraction is a powerful critical thinking technique. Try it some time.
AskReddit,fpcxobt,t1_fpcxew2,1588515327.0,"In the example it is assumed that all goods are perfectly fungible. i.e., You could snap your fingers and trade the car for $20,000. Choosing to do so for less makes you irrational."
AskReddit,fpcwpf1,t1_fpce44m,1588514655.0,"There's because you don't value the car at its true value of $20k. The example still holds, you're just economically ""irrational."""
AskReddit,fpc5u8o,t1_fpc5h0p,1588488601.0,And the FF example is great! I wonder how you could exploit that in your favor.
AskReddit,fpc5stb,t1_fpc5h0p,1588488563.0,"I think the 'potential' explanation has a lot of merit - I personally enjoy having things to look forward to, on top of enjoying the thing itself. Thus when the event gets cancelled, in my mind I lose more happiness than the event would have brought because I was excited for it. This certainly goes the other way as well, like you explained! 

I imagine this is why rewarding oneself for doing good work (or studying or whatnot) is so valuable. We get to spend so much time thinking about the reward that we realize its full potential. My wife and I love routines for this very reason.

Thanks for the suggestion! I hadn't quite considered this concept in that way."
AskReddit,fpc4h7x,t1_fpc3dad,1588487306.0,"To be precise, the value is /at least/ $500k ;)"
AskReddit,fpc43aw,t1_fpc3spv,1588486943.0,"There's a very popular experiment done by John List where he first proves that people are, on average, indifferent between some certain candy bar and a coffee mug (in terms of value). He then gives a bunch of people either of these items, and, in a convoluted way, asks them if they want to trade for the other item. You'd expect 50% to accept the trade due to indifference, but only 10% or so decided to accept the trade.

It's definitely up for interpretation though, as is all economics. The beauty (and folly) of economics is that it is not grounded by physical laws or boundaries."
AskReddit,fpc3ptg,t1_fpc074w,1588486607.0,Prospect theory is so important because it is the origin of loss aversion. :)
AskReddit,fpbzkf4,t1_fpbybjm,1588482996.0,"Basically, yes! You ""get used"" to things you have, so even if you have the $500k for just a short period, you value it at more than $500k. A better example may be me giving you a car worth $20k, then telling you you can trade it for $20,001. You should take this trade, but the car's (sentimental, perhaps) value to you is more than a dollar."
AskReddit,fpbx18v,t1_fpbjh9k,1588480969.0,"You actually touched on one of my favorite topics in economics, called prospect theory. The basic idea is that a gain of $500k then an immediate loss of $500k has been experimentally proven to ""hurt"" you more than not having had the money in the first place."
Coronavirus,fp3axii,t1_fp3a02b,1588276142.0,"Tests are not nearly as accurate as most people think, which is why they're just one tool in a differential diagnosis.

I don't know the false positive or false negative rates of the tests being offered, but most tests target a low false positive rate. I'm explaining this because the people giving the test/telling you results won't. Don't accept what any medical test tell you with certainty (not that I believe there's any conspiracy, it's just statistically impossible to have a very, very accurate test)."
UCSantaBarbara,fozwz6b,t3_gaixps,1588198352.0,"The field itself is extremely broad. It might help us to know what sector you want to be in.

The biggest thing for banking though is networking. I hate the word and I'm personally really bad at it, but making connections is far and away the best way to get a job."
UCSantaBarbara,fonaudt,t1_fomfutf,1587915887.0,Any meaningful level of statistics requires a lot of calculus. Measure theory and probability theory are practically joined at the hip.
UCSantaBarbara,foh9rhe,t1_foh9i0c,1587762388.0,"I'm glad to hear it. Nobody blames you for being stressed. I couldn't imagine having to deal with this while I was in my undergrad, in the midst of applying for grad school."
UCSantaBarbara,foh982f,t1_foh8ntl,1587762132.0,"There is always wiggle room. Especially when it is clear that there is a reason for lower grades. Graduate schools, for example, always mention in the admissions FAQs that you should explain why certain grades are lower if you have a valid reason (taking care of ill family member, etc.). This pandemic is probably one of the best excuses ever for poor grades. But try not to let it affect your education."
UCSantaBarbara,foh82jt,t3_g7g3xt,1587761603.0,"Two things. First, as I state often, no one (especially employers) will judge you based on this quarter's grades. Second, while there is no harm in logging hours and making a case for good faith, I doubt it will get you very far. It is well known that time spent is not a good indicator of success, and you can't prove these efforts regardless.

Understand the material, do as well as you can, and remind yourself that life goes on."
Coronavirus,fofyy1c,t1_fofwi1x,1587745255.0,I specifically said there would be volunteers. Don't get so defensive when you ask for opinions and get them.
Coronavirus,fofubc3,t1_foftez4,1587742952.0,"Two things I can think of:

You need phlebotomists that have antibodies, and you can't force people to give plasma.

I imagine there would be plenty of people willing to help, but there are potential snags. That said, I don't know anything so fixing these certainly does not guarantee this works."
UCSantaBarbara,focy97o,t1_focy1m0,1587677463.0,You're right. I just thought it was worth mentioning.
UCSantaBarbara,focxpil,t1_focxk1b,1587677255.0,I agree with this - my Big 4 internship was laughably easy compared to college. So was my defense internal accounting internship.
UCSantaBarbara,fockcly,t3_g6snsd,1587672350.0,"I'm sorry that this quarter is not going well. The only thing I can say is that many people around the country are in the same boat, and employers/graduate schools will certainly take this into account when looking at your applications. Focus on passing (and your mental health!)."
UCSantaBarbara,focjnv8,t3_g6tilf,1587672115.0,"The only thing I see that you might have missed is the second English composition course (that you may have accounted for in stating that you met the Fall English and Math requirements).

Other than that, Did you submit your TAG application in September and your UCSB application in November?"
UCSantaBarbara,fobrl13,t3_g6q8mk,1587662905.0,This is very field dependent.
UCSantaBarbara,fo54kxk,t1_fo54ijy,1587517372.0,You know it.
UCSantaBarbara,fo54av3,t3_g5rlzs,1587517201.0,You're absolutely right. But it is unlikely it'll happen; the UC is probably pinching pennies at the moment to compensate for the (already) half-billion dollar losses from the virus.
UCSantaBarbara,fnnsbo0,t1_fnnq74y,1587100269.0,"Also, read what UCSB's econ dept. requires of its applicants. Their requirements are a very good representation of most schools."
UCSantaBarbara,fnns8po,t1_fnnq74y,1587100201.0,"Econ PhDs will require you to at least take intermediate micro (100b, not 10a), macro, and metrics. More is better, but the major is not strictly necessary. Professor Startz's website has lots of very good information about it."
UCSantaBarbara,fnmbcnw,t1_fnm8wnu,1587068371.0,"You still have to pay to live in the mean time. If you can live with your parents or something and find employment while this plays out I'd recommend it. I'd even argue that you could later use it as a talking point about how you're resourceful in dire situations and highly valued person-to-person communication with your professors and/or knew what your money was worth.

Make sure that your financial aid is not affected by this, though."
UCSantaBarbara,fnmb2of,t1_fnm7fwh,1587068231.0,How many of this 44% are international students?
UCSantaBarbara,fnjvrec,t1_fnjuzh1,1587008144.0,Why did you enroll in this quarter?
UCSantaBarbara,fniz6dc,t3_g1z8xg,1586988990.0,"Physics is a popular undergrad for Econ PhDs. Getting the econ requirements out of the way now will save you time later, and be a valuable signal of interest. Get some econ research under your belt and you'll be a solid candidate."
UCSantaBarbara,fnhgb1y,t3_g1qbyc,1586961860.0,The quizzes are meant to be taken without help from other individuals. Do not sacrifice your academic integrity.
UCSantaBarbara,fnhfys6,t1_fnharxf,1586961672.0,This is true. Never pay for a PhD.
UCSantaBarbara,fne51rg,t3_g15l7a,1586883187.0,"Depends on the school. If the graduate admissions faq does not specify, contact the admissions office. I imagine they'll tell you to only count the GPA from UCSB."
UCSantaBarbara,fn750z3,t1_fn74i3h,1586713418.0,What about it?
Coronavirus,fn1cmc3,t1_fn1cang,1586559245.0,The specific reason they're doing it is that the CDC and the federal government recommend it. They cannot prevent someone walking up to them out of the blue.
Coronavirus,fn1ceaw,t1_fn1a5kg,1586559117.0,"They were making a joke. It is unlikely you noticed anything profound. The two events are likely correlated because of population density, but aren't linked in any meaningful way."

UCSantaBarbara,fn1bohz,t3_fyqiz7,1586558709.0,Contact the department. They'll have the most recent and accurate information.

Coronavirus,fmx4m1y,t1_fmx3vmh,1586458366.0,"I'm not missing the point. I understand the concept of expected value. 

First off, if you plan for retirement truly rationally, I commend you. If you actually react to a <1% change in your expected life, you're the most rational person I've ever spoken to.

Second, you're right. I have not done the math. The math does not need to be done, because it is clearly so small. If you so badly want to be scared that you choose not to understand that, no one can help you because you should immediately pull out all of your savings and splurge it all because you're going to die tomorrow."

Coronavirus,fmx2742,t1_fmx18te,1586457143.0,"This entire question misses the point of life expectancy. If you are already 60 for example, your life expectancy is much higher than 78 (or whatever is was the year you were born). Further, because your health has not changed if you do not get the virus, your life expectancy as an individual does not change at all."
Coronavirus,fmx0yaa,t1_fmwyqqb,1586456510.0,The change will be from 78 (for example) to 77.99995. That does not affect your retirement savings decisions.
Coronavirus,fmwxsem,t1_fmwwlyn,1586454911.0,I did not say life expectancy was immaterial. I said the change to life expectancy would be.
Coronavirus,fmwuzab,t1_fmwugro,1586453503.0,"This is the same argument at the ""uphill both ways"" story everyone's heard. The individual above is allowed to be disappointed that they lost something they were looking forward to."
Coronavirus,fmwum7q,t1_fmwu0o6,1586453318.0,"The change in life expectancy due to the virus will be immaterial. The population of the world grows by hundreds of thousands per day. While heartbreaking, the virus doesn't even register as a blip on the radar of deaths."
