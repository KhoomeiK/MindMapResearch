UCSC,fpirugy,t1_fowi42y,1588647301.0,"I contacted the union. They explained it all to me. I know a lot of both humanities and STEM grad students. I am not sure anyone would want to work a double TAship anyway. How could you do anything else if you worked a double TAship? I heard the rumor about 75% pay and contacted the union. I was like, ""What? That's not fair."" It is also not true, in general (like 99% of the time as far as I could tell). I don't know the exact numbers, but almost no one gets more than 50%. 

Berkeley used to give like 24.9%? 19.9%??? I forget the percentage, sorry. Something that was below the threshold of getting tuition reimbursement. The union sued and won for the tuition. 

I am not sure where else to gather data. I think these rumors though are harmful. Nothing feels worse than social comparison."
UCSC,fpag0q1,t3_gb8091,1588447400.0,"It seems both cruel, because as was noted by u/ReformedBlackPerson, if I encountered a question I could not solve, I would freak out. On the other hand, going to Chegg to find an answer is obviously cheating. S/he probably suspected several cheater before this exam. I am not sure how you design a problem that looks reasonable but is unsolvable. I wonder what class this was."
UCSC,fowepwc,t1_fouz4xu,1588118332.0,"I have yet to meet a PhD student who is paid full time. I know this is not true. Have you met anyone working full time for the university while a student? No, you haven't.

As for job prospects after graduation, there are certainly differences, but the university hasn't paid more for them. I actually think the humanities professors expect less from their TAs which effectively means that those TAs get paid more."
UCSC,fosx5c2,t1_foswped,1588039893.0,Union fees are really low here and they are not based on wages.
UCSC,fosx0ie,t1_forwrrn,1588039813.0,You forget they also wanted to get a $1450 / month raise in addition.
UCSC,foswped,t1_fos8q9i,1588039628.0,"They clearly do NOT have the support for an ULP strike. They wanted to strike in MARCH. It's almost summer, and they don't have close to enough signatures to even hold a vote. There is no guarantee that those who signed the pledge would all vote to strike. I am betting a fair number would actually vote 'no.'"
UCSC,foswcs6,t1_foqyhge,1588039415.0,P would not have hurt anyone's graduation chances.
UCSC,fosvyho,t3_g93b6x,1588039175.0,"The union has 3500 - 3600 people signed up as ready to strike out of what - 20,000? There are close to 60,000 grad students in UC, so that is assuming 1/3 of them can become TAs. Even if it is only 10,000, that is still only a third of potential TAs. In other words, the chance of a sanctioned, legal strike is low. Does that mean that some will still choose to strike? Yes, but the strike will continue to be less significant as more TAs get fired and more professors and undergrads get tired of their rhetoric and antics."
ucsccola,fntwqsr,t1_fnqvy7a,1587250068.0,"You are wrong about the 50%. Working 75% is an exception that can happen here at UCSC as well. It happens if the other TA dies or something. Otherwise, it's 50% max for all grad students because we are students.
You also forgot about paying retirement, healthcare, SS, etc. taxes, that are part of the costs of employing a professor.
Look at the link you sent. UC is on there. They must also include tuition reduction.
I agree that the state of California pushed UC to admit students before facilitates were built and professors hired. This comes down population fluctuation, and prop 13 hamstringing taxes to pay for these expenses."
ucsccola,fnqq3k3,t1_fnmkiry,1587169760.0,"Please, explain how the university ""profits"" off grad student research. Who is paying them? Are you giving the university patents?
Again, we are not typical employees. We are not lecturers (when we are TAs). The lecturers have their PhDs already, right? If we did, would we TA here? Professors make more than $100 K on average, I believe. It does depend on discipline though, so maybe your number is right for the humanities. 
Yes, minimum wage will go up (about time!), but rents could actually go down in this economy. We were talking about now, right? You were unwilling to wait for 2 years to let the contract expire, unwilling to wait for more housing to be built.
The 50% is a cap BECAUSE we are students. Being a student is our number one priority job. 
We are not underpaid compared to most grad students. Look at the link you sent. We are basically exactly average."
ucsccola,fnme4xp,t1_fnm5l0q,1587069795.0,"The $2500 was going to be given before the strike, but need based like you said. So in that regard, the strike had an effect. I happen to know more about this than you do.

The $90-94K comes from simple math. How much money the union wants divided by many hours are worked. Yes, I am including tuition in that figure. 

You are failing to recognize that Professors spend time helping grad students one-on-one with research ideas, writing, motivation, etc. You are discounting their work as insignificant or free. I don't suppose you have the gall to tell your advisor that their time is worthless, and they should not be paid for it? As part of the duties at a Tier 1 research institution like UCSC faculty are paid to spend time and energy mentoring grad students. This lack of appreciation for what we get as grad students is what is so upsetting. I was so happy to be admitted here. I knew it was going to be hard. It is both hard work, and I took a substantial pay cut. But I am still getting paid. If you work full-time at minimum wage, you would have to work 50 hours per week to make what we currently make during the school year. So, yeah, you can get a job at the Boardwalk and work full time all summer and make less than working at most 20 hours per week doing a pretty fun job. I like TAing. My students like me. They learn. I learn a little too. It really is not that bad."
ucsccola,fnlxpfh,t1_fnizum4,1587061553.0,"The temporary $2400 was already going to be given to grad students BEFORE the strike. That is why is was able to be given so quickly. 

The strike DEFINITELY changed. First, we want to be paid like Irvine or Riverside (I forget which), which IS union-busting. The whole point of the union is that we get treated the same. Asking for more money JUST for UCSC, is against the contract. More importantly, it cannot gain as much support as asking for more cheap housing on campus. Asking for $90K + salary (prorated) is a lot for a temporary job. Reminder: all TAships are temporary. Being a grad student is a temporary apprenticeship. It is NOT a career. Asking for an affordable housing option is something is something everyone can agree on. 
One problem with asking for more money is there is no end to it. You think rents won't keep pace with wages? These landlords charge as much as they can get. If all of a sudden thousands of renters can pay more, they will charge more. If there is a cheap alternative - say another trailer park on campus, then there would be less pressure on the housing market, and maybe rents would go down. Surely, if it is cheaper to live on campus than off, more would choose to live on campus. That would lower the competition for rentals in town. This would be good for everyone. Giving the grad students more money to chase rentals just makes it harder for shuttle drivers and store clerks and others to afford to live here. Think about it. The only real solution is more affordable housing. The only place that can possibly happen is on campus."
ucsccola,fniwk5r,t1_fnbqlxb,1586987633.0,"Your strike activity WAS a half-baked idea. That is MY point. 

There are higher rates of GSRs in the humanities than in STEM, that is part of the reason not to strike in STEM. Get fired = no money in STEM. Get fired = get GSR in humanities. 

The strikers DID change their demands: from COLA for UCSC to COLA for all. Did you join late?"
UCSC,fneyye4,t1_fnevpj2,1586898409.0,You seem to know more about who he was. We all want to know because we all have our favorite drivers.
ucsccola,fnbmkgw,t1_fn1a8qq,1586818214.0,"Allowing people to cross on foot is not allowing them free access to their homes. The strike interrupted mail service, garbage collection, children pick up and drop off, driving to the store and back with food, getting food delivered, getting to doctor's appointments, etc. One wonders why you think you have the right to ask people to justify their movement. ""Prove to me that you live where you say you live."" Would you accept that from anyone? What about when you go to your house someone comes up to you and says, ""I need you to prove that you live down this street."" (No emergency, no fire, no police asking, just some self-righteous uninformed 'gate-keepers') My question is, ""Who the hell are you to question my needs?"" We aren't supposed to ask why you ""need"" a dog (which is clearly untrained) or twice as much time on a test or anything else. Why the f\* do you think you have to right to stop ANYONE from going onto or off of campus? My typical thought is, ""Tell me where you live and I will randomly prevent you from accessing your home, because I am mad about something OUT OF YOUR CONTROL."" WTF.

But you are missing a big point. You should have gone to Sacramento or somewhere where your disruption would have affected people who have the power to negotiate. You took your aggression out on innocent bystanders. There is nothing I could do to give myself a raise. Yet, you prevented me from going to the dentist's and buy food. Thanks a f\*ing lot.

It was more than a handful of students that interrupted the midterm. There is no reason to believe that they did NOT know it was a midterm beforehand.  I still have not heard of any other disruptions, therefore, one can safely conclude that they targeted the midterm. It is part of the humanities versus sciences. It was discussed that there was not enough buy-in from BSOE and they needed to do something. They should have gotten people on board BEFORE they struck, but then they would have had to have been more reasonable in their demands. (For example, ask for more and cheaper housing on campus to match what other campuses have). Instead, they started asking for more money than other campuses get, which seems unfair and is UNION BUSTING! Yes, they changed their demands AFTER THEY STARTED WITHHOLDING GRADES, in part because they did their math wrong to begin with. (Maybe having the sciences in from the start could have helped with that?)"
UCSC,fnbi4ko,t3_g0knhw,1586815933.0,"They  may not open campus in the fall. So it's possible no one will be allowed to live on campus. Well, I am not sure about grad students who stayed through summer, maybe they could or families?"
ucsccola,fn18vda,t1_fmveuj1,1586557111.0,"So, you are saying that the people who received GSRs after being fired had QUIT THE UNION? And therefore were not union members? Really? How many of the striking grad students quit the union? All of them?

&#x200B;

Were ANY GSRs given to union members? Yes, my guess it most of them were given to union members."
ucsccola,fn1866x,t1_fmvfstj,1586556709.0,"I suppose if you feel the university is lying about everything, then no agreement would ever be acceptable. The fact is the illegal strikers were not being honest. They were not honest with the undergrads (How many didn't receive honors that should have? You don't know.) They were not honest with the professors they worked for (If they told the professors they would delete or withhold grades, the professors would have made other arrangements.)

They were not honest about why they ""moved the strike"" onto campus. They were afraid it was going to rain. 

They were not honest about disrupting a midterm. All this talk about how they didn't know, blah, blah, blah. About how they disrupted a whole bunch of classes not just a CSE midterm, blah blah blah = lies.

They were not honest about taking over the dining halls. They tried stealing food from food services and giving it to some undergrads in the hopes of creating good will. But it was stealing. Why were they not arrested for stealing and charged for stealing? Because the university babies the entitled people who struck. 

It is not true that blocking campus is non-violent. Preventing people from accessing their homes is a type of violence. Imagine not being able to go home because someone is upset about something you have no control over. How is that fair? How does that make you feel empathy for the people preventing you from coming and going to home, to the doctors, to the store?"
ucsccola,fn169cr,t1_fmveuj1,1586555624.0,"This argument about GSRs doesn't fully hold water. Although there are many more GSRs in the humanities, there are very few in other departments. GSRs are generally given because of a grant (either to the professor or the department). They are not work / a job. Yes, if the student fails to do research, they would probably not be awarded another GSR. Again, nothing to do with grades. Departments and professors tried to limit the blow of being fired on specific grad students by offering them GSRs. This argument would mean that the university would further tie the hands of the departments, which could be the fallout from this suit. This would further hurt the fired TAs. But yeah, is it fair that they got GSRs after striking? No, they should have gotten no money. I agree. Suing the university over this is dumb. The outcome surely could be no GSRs for fired strikers, which does seem fairer."
ucsccola,fmvbu1a,t1_fmpoyz3,1586411769.0,"It is not as if they would not be able to grieve anything ever. Just their termination, which would have been revoked, and their letters, which would have been removed. 

The strikers have been talking to each other in an echo chamber for too long. We are grad STUDENTS, not career employees. TAships are a way to subsidize education. They are not a career. TAships are actually a pretty sweet gig if you think about it that way. Apprenticeships for most careers pay worse and you end up working harder, longer, less enjoyable days. Take one and see."
ucsccola,fmvatux,t1_fmv62ea,1586410903.0,"The union told the ""wildcat"" strikers to report to work and turn in the grades. This follows the contract which we all signed effectively when we agreed to become TAs.

You are also aware that GSRs are not the same as TAships in that yeah, you can fail to do research, but it is a lot harder to prove and therefore harder to fire with cause.  No one disputes that the fired TAs didn't actually perform the duties assigned to them. They signed a form at the beginning of each quarter promising to perform said duties. So they perjured themselves. (Not that they will be prosecuted for that) They deliberately failed to do these duties. They even got paid while striking, which you know doesn't usually happen during strikes (if you researched labor movements). They collected pay and health care benefits all winter quarter while partying at the base of campus and forcing others to crowd into shuttles with a global pandemic racing towards us.

Grad students CAN be fired for failing to fulfill the duties. It is in the contract. You are ignoring that. 'Oh, we want to dispute the firings.' On what basis? That they actually did the work? No, because no one denies they did NOT do the work. Because they failed to show up to their meeting? Because disciplinary meetings were scheduled. They even could have brought union reps with them. Are you saying that they weren't given meetings? because everyone I know was. Some were given multiple meetings depending on what they said.

The union did send a cease and desist letter. The union also sent a bunch of other letters. Many more letters pro-strike. And how they are winning. So much winning. (Remind you of anyone?) The union was weak then and is weaker now that the wildcat strikers seemed to have taken over messaging. I bet that union membership is down and will decline for the next few years. (Do you dispute that?)  Yeah, some members of the union can protest, but the union will not get 50% of the members to agree more or less 50% of the grad students. This whole polling via email with little notice seemed to go only one way. To strike: sure 20% response rate and 60% agreement (or whatever it was = total voting to strike = about 12%??). Pausing the strike for the election (75% of 80% = about 60%) No way. We are going to strike for another whole week. WTF? (oh, it might rain so we are moving onto campus... ) Oh the university is using the corona virus to break the union.. What's the next story?

As for the PERB, they almost always HEAR cases. The university knew their request for dismissal would most likely not be granted, but it indicates to the board that the university thinks it should win easily."
ucsccola,fmtp469,t3_fw5lgk,1586376568.0,"The problem with a ULP strike is that there were no unfair labor practices to strike against. The acting executive vice chancellor specializes in labor relations. She is not some ignorant, quick to act, uninformed drone. If anything, she offered too much. No judge or arbitrator is going to think the university used unfair labor practices. The wildcat (illegal) strikers did use unfair labor practices. Striking during a ratified contract is illegal (breach of contract). Deleting grades is unfair (the grades don't belong to the TAs). Blocking campus is unfair. Forcing all of us off Metro buses and onto crowded shuttles *during the initial COVID-19 transmission phase* is unfair (and just plane mean). Saying the university was using the COVID-19 as an excuse to ""break the union"" is so self-centered and dumb, it could have come from Trump's mouth. In reality, the wildcat strikers ""broke the union,"" and it will be years before the union has any power again."
