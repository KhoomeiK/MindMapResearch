Really, any of the major chat/group messaging platforms do the same thing / have the same features. They will all allow you to create your own channels/rooms, use emoji reactions, post links that get auto parsed, post pictures, etc., etc. Functionally, they are pretty much alike or very similar to each other.

**The main selling point of any of them is: the platform is stable and reliable.** They are already in use by lots of people from large corporations, schools, to groups of friends.

* **Slack**: it’s ubiquitous at a lot of workplaces, and is probably the leader in the pack. Students graduating will probably encounter it in their next job. But licensing will probably be costly. I’d ask around about pricing. 
* **Discord**: originated as a gaming focused messaging app, but people use it for non-gaming too. There is an unofficial UCSB discord server run by students that exists. Free, but I’m not sure what their privacy compliance is or how they use the data. 
* **MS Teams**: Newish entry to the market, but gaining popularity. The university already has a office 365 license and MS is known to give education massive discounts. This might work, but I don’t know what would be involved in getting ""official"" sign off. 
* **GroupMe**: never used it but have heard of others using it for study groups.

Keep in mind that some of these services offer free tiers if the number of users is small enough, you don’t mind that message retention might be short (3 months or x thousand messages, whichever comes first). Also their Terms of Service might specifically only allow the free tier for ""personal use.""  I’d check the TOS carefully if you plan to try and get away with a free tier."
