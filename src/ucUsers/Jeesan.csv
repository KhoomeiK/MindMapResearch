CompetitiveTFT,fpluwyz,t1_fpl575r,1588719950.0,"Rebels are good, but I think it's much harder to play compared to all the other meta comps because Rebel units kind of suck themselves which requires really good transitioning/playing strongest board/econ management until you can hit that AOE wetdream lategame. I think it's still really good because it has one of the best lategames and I play it as a ""flex"" with Jinx brawlers (like 6 cybers vs chrono kayle) when I get the items or some early legendaries sincd Rebels have a higher ceiling than Jinx brawlers imo."

TeamfightTactics,fp65uh0,t1_fp638np,1588346622.0,"Redbuff is stronger than GS early game and the healing debuff/true damage is worth more than the extra GS damage imo. Since double GS requires 2 swords, it makes hitting more swords for GAs more difficult for your other carries because of how the item drop system worms."
TeamfightTactics,fp630ys,t1_fp62kqd,1588345115.0,"Challenger players regularly slam redbuff on jinx. Furthermore, we are in a winstreak meta, and redbuff is extremely important to winning early/mid fights (on lucian, esp against the newly buffed vanguards), and jinx is by far the best redbuff carrier in the traditional 6 rebels comp with GP ASol MF. Pretty sure redbuff lucian gets sold and transferred to jinx when pivoting into rebels from whatever their strongest board is. IMO Redbuff jinx is 100% essential on rebels because it allows you to stay healthy enough to fast 8/fast 9 to hit legendaries"
TeamfightTactics,fp5vuio,t1_fp5vdh1,1588341027.0,"Jinx has to do a lot of heavy lifting in blaster/brawlers because she is most of the damage in that comp so you want her to have the most damage while other blasters apply AOE debuffs. However with rebels Jinx is really only a transitional carry to help you get through to lategame where your legendaries will AOE oneshot the enemy team so ideally you want to give items to ASol GP MF as well which makes GS/redbuff the best-in-slot items for Jinx since the other item components should ideally make GA/AP for GP, Demo/AP for Asol and Seraphs/Defensive Item for MF."
TeamfightTactics,fp5v0xd,t1_fp5sbn8,1588340523.0,6 Rebels doesn't run blasters other than MF and putting it on Jinx gives her a damage increase and makes sure she gets a reset on kills by redbuff damage
TeamfightTactics,fp5uvto,t1_fp5rskc,1588340435.0,Because realistically the only other blaster you would be playing is MF and Jinx would definitely be a better user of the redbuff when playing 6 rebels.

CompetitiveTFT,fmvd36m,t3_fxkog0,1586412893.0,"I saw Xin being put as ""don't pickup unless synergies"" category, but recently I've played games where Xin Zhao 2 carried my mech items and let me winstreak (with Jarvan 2) early until I transitioned into mech infil (since protectors was contested) and it worked out really well. What do you think about using protectors to winstreak and then discarding them later?"
CompetitiveTFT,fmqrnlw,t3_fwppt7,1586305587.0,"Slowroll at 6, prioritize mech items (Titan/QSS/Bramble first prio, DClaw/Ionic/Warmogs second prio), 3* units are a win condition and you can win while staying at level 6. Morellos goes on Kaisa 100% of the time (often worth making early because the game will usually give you a belt at least once). Shaco items are honestly quite flexible imo, but ideally you would want BT/IE. Perfect build would be Titan QSS Bramble Mech, Seraphs Morello Demo Kaisa, IE BT GA/QSS Shaco."
