ucr,fp957c2,t1_fp8x884,1588414798.0,You’re right because my minimum wage job will def pay for school and housing. I was never eligible for grants either
ucr,fp8npik,t3_gbzpa2,1588397326.0,"Yup this is a touchy subject but I completely agree. A bunch of my friends who get financial aid usually end up blowing it on a new car, festival tickets, etc when I’m in hella debt from these loans. I get some people truly need help but it’s just dumb how this system works."

ucr,fp35aer,t3_gaimy8,1588273329.0,I would go to UCSD. My friends who went there had an amazing experience and all found great paying jobs right after graduation

ucr,fo58v9a,t1_fo4szif,1587520042.0,"I transferred into SOBA and I’ve never even seen my advisor since every time I’ve gone into their office, front desk manages to always push me out the door telling me to just email them my question or give them a call at a certain time. I’ve never been able to reach my advisor through call either. My advisor has ignored plenty of my emails, and when she does respond it’s usually weeks later with unhelpful information accompanied with a rude tone. I’ve pretty much resorted to asking other students to get an answer but recently I had to reach out about further info on the status of my grad app. Advisor ended up just making me feel dumb for asking. For a school that emphasizes first gen students, you would think they’d be more helpful."
