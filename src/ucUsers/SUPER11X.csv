berkeley,foo6bxv,t3_g8an1k,1587933358.0,"I cant help you with A since I'm usually the one getting CS help or B since I'm pretty antisocial, but as for C, while I'm not defending people being creepy and clearly crossing a line‚Äîthat's obviously wrong‚ÄîI think there's an important distinction between that and people just hitting on someone. And I guess I feel inclined to defend this position mostly because I'd probably be one of those guys hitting on you lol. Like at this point in my life, I have plenty of friends, more than I ever wanted or can realistically keep up with, and I dont need any more, so if I'm putting actual effort into meeting a new person and developing a relationship with them (outside of school/work relationships), I'd want it be more than platonic. Like I'm not gonna stop interacting with a potential friend simply because they're not romantically interested, but I'm also not gonna put the same effort into interacting with them that I would a potential romantic partner. That's just where I am. And also, it's not like I dont make new (female) friends, but it's usually only classmates or people that I have some other main reason for seeing, so becoming friends with them is a natural development, not something that was particularly intentional on my part.

Anyway, my point is that if someone is only hitting on you, I dont think you should necessarily hold it against them. However, if you're not interested, you're not interested, and they need to respect that, and any of them who think otherwise are indeed gross."
manga,fonz1xq,t3_g8gsk2,1587929288.0," Shen has quickly become my favorite character and by a lot! And interesting note: while Fuuko's timer went up to 20,002 seconds, Shen's went up to 50,002 seconds, presumably meaning that his resolve to achieve his dream is nothing to sneeze at. I really hope he stays as a main cast member!"

manga,foefsee,t1_foe4nqq,1587702696.0,Without even hearing the boy out? Ehhhhhh pretty unfair imo. Especially since Hakari is okay with it. But obviously the mom didnt care about Hakari's opinion to begin with.

manga,foa9zt3,t1_fo9v5xu,1587642862.0,I dont agree. There's a difference between making something sound natural and completely changing its meaning. In one translation Flash comes off as much less concerned than the other. That's not localization at that point.
manga,fo9twit,t1_fo921m9,1587631013.0,But which is more accurate? What did Flash actually say?

I found Kazuya's perversion to be uniquely realistic compared anything else I've ever read. I mean he is scarily relatable to me, so that absolutely hooked me.

TheBlackList,fnzjcvn,t3_g42yzd,1587395189.0,"I entirely agree with your critiques of the episode's bad writing. However, taking the character at face value, I think you could easily make the argument that Kemp was a terrible person and deserved to die for pushing through an obviously sketchy sale with no regard for any possible consequences. BUT, Reddington has no moral high ground to stand on and his killing of Kemp is beyond hypocritical and just absurd. I mean Red was literally selling nuclear components a couple weeks ago and now he grows a conscious? Ridiculous."

If Faerie just increases that mass of things (regardless of how he does it), that would just make them even more strongly attracted to Earth. Ridiculous. And this is coming from someone who had had basically no problem with how physics had been stretched up to this point since at least previous powers had taken real physics and applied it in fantastical ways, but this is on another level."

thepromisedneverland,fn6fpp2,t3_fztpu0,1586698026.0,"I think the anime completely ruined the scene where Norman realizes he wants to live. In the anime, it's a completely silent, slow walk, whereas as in the manga he's screaming out internally ""I want to live! I want to live!"". I just thought it was so much more powerful in the manga. As such, I dont have faith in the anime adaptation, so I'd read the manga and not wait for S2."
