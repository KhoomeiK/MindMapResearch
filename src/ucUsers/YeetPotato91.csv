berkeley,fojw9xm,t3_g7nbm8,1587830691.0,You’re not alone buddy
berkeley,fo2xcdg,t3_g565yn,1587476285.0,"As much as possible, you must avoid Talaska. One of the worst profs I’ve had at Cal so far. Extremely inconsiderate and rude, and writes exams to the point that her ostensibly easier class (16A) became harder than the more advanced 1A."
berkeley,fo2l8ip,t1_fo0qgp0,1587466615.0,How would that help tho? Cheaters would get dismissed by the OSC anyways
berkeley,fo12ibn,t1_fo0z6fh,1587424442.0,I feel that in 61A cheating on projects is almost never caught. Honestly there are barely any approaches to solving their questions. Most 61A cheating incidents are typically on the midterms
berkeley,fo0yo5i,t1_fo0xvx9,1587422282.0,"Oh boy. You have no idea how 70 works... This isn’t really a CS class but a math class. While there may be few overarching approaches to solving a question, the notation and explanation are 99% of the time wildly different between students.

2 correct answers may also have very different correct explanations, but the same general approach."
berkeley,fo0xanb,t1_fo0p504,1587421518.0,What kind of evidence is typically presented when staff accuse someone of cheating? Is it just similarity of answers or something else too?
berkeley,fmpubqp,t1_fmnijjz,1586287480.0,"How did you install it on your MBP? Did you need to install windows, or can you do it on Mac OS?"
malcolminthemiddle,fmodos6,t3_fw2pz7,1586255178.0,What would Malcolm have sued for? “A house that would fit in the lawyer’s garage?”
berkeley,fmlctqq,t1_fmkgvl4,1586183822.0,Not difficult at all. Just a slight brain exercise
berkeley,fmffdkt,t1_fme4sy6,1586026087.0,"Idk if they were actually ever there. I've seen a 1911 and 194-something map of Berkeley, and I haven't seen them there. Maybe its just the artist's rendition"
