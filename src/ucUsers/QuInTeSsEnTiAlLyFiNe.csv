baylor,fp3pg2d,t1_fp3p1bt,1588283425.0,Thank you! Is there a bus system that could take me to the hospital?
baylor,fp3p89p,t1_fp3oo3x,1588283315.0,"Oh and I almost forgot.

10. Would I have a difficult time at BU as a big time atheist since I was 9?"
baylor,fp3oo3x,t3_gb4kjh,1588283030.0,"Also, to tack on other questions. 

7. How is the racial and political diversity at Baylor? I generally don't care about such things but I have heard various anecdotes that force me to ask.

8. Are fraternities and sororities very big on the campus so much so that students feel like they have to join?

9. Are professors difficult to work with?

I found a lot of critical information on this website so I'm hoping someone can correct it if they believe any information to be inaccurate.

atheism,fojvn4x,t1_foj9sas,1587830324.0,I'm no fan but Cenk Uyghur did a poor job of debating him. He totally allowed Ben to spit logical fallacies left and right and roll over him.
baylor,fohzo6p,t3_f8u8lf,1587775767.0,I committed as well. '24 - Biochemistry please and thanks!
baylor,fodm50l,t1_focq4ot,1587686402.0,i emailed baylor and they said i would be housed at the teal residential hall for engineering.

baylor,fobnndy,t1_foblcn4,1587661688.0,alright thanks!
premed,fo7tmp1,t3_g65wbg,1587584340.0,"Normally I would wholeheartedly put someone like that on a pedestal for speaking out against bullshit pseudoscience but...

""I cannot, in good conscious, write a letter in the hopes of someone being praised for not know wtf allopathic medicine is since that person is likely a dumbass with no brains"""
PoliticalOpinions,fnqwn09,t1_fnqomrb,1587173841.0,"Very much agreed. But I meant that as a majority statement. Statistically speaking, the amount of incidents one could find that would fit that description is very insignificant. Like very very very very very very insignificant."
PoliticalOpinions,fnqcg9c,t3_g30wp3,1587161915.0,I just realized 3/4 pro gun comments have all been downvoted exactly once. Except for one which was 2 hours ago (recent). OP I hope ur not downvoting comments u disagree with when u prompted pro gun people to respond to ur question lmfao
PoliticalOpinions,fnolx6e,t3_g30wp3,1587128597.0,"I mean there are heavy restrictions on guns. Go buy a gun so you can understand just how difficult it is to acquire one. Now there has been this thing going around called a gun show loophole but that isn't really a thing. Some people just sell guns without a license to sell but actual licensed sellers still check on you to see if you have a history of violence. So if a restriction you advocate for is to ensure that all sellers are licensed and do background checks on people (universal background checks) then that's something I can get behind. Also in America you don't see random people in heated arguments whip out a a gun to start shooting each other (unless they are part of a gang) and it seems to me that that's a worry of yours in your post. Also it's my firm belief that more people are saved by guns than hurt. But here's the thing about that. A while ago, the Republicans passed this thing called the Dicky Amendment which prevents the CDC from researching my above statement and publishing any results from a study. So I think my entire basis for belief in more freedom for the second amendment lies in that study. So I although conservative, do advocate for the repeal of the dicky amendment."
PoliticalOpinions,fni481k,t1_fnhvqli,1586973696.0,"The way you can call Democrats progressive, is by solely looking at SOME social issues. Otherwise they're center leaning right or left depending on issue."
UCI,fnh4mx9,t1_fnec0q8,1586954726.0,lmfao but fr though cuz I got waitlisted
AmItheAsshole,fnbj0j5,t1_fnbdmpc,1586816387.0,"Yeah I agree, the current arrangement needs to be changed but as you said, it's not necessary for the arrangement the son proposes."
AmItheAsshole,fnbdp04,t1_fnbcswp,1586813699.0,"Since the OP is not like you, perhaps the compromise I suggested may be the best option?"
AmItheAsshole,fnbbyb5,t1_fnb99od,1586812824.0,"also look at the way the OP talks about his brother. He obviously loves him a lot and thinks of him not just as blood but as family. I mean look man, if you are very emotionally detached and you find it easy to abandon people you love because of some belief then kudos dude that's hard. But i can empathize with the OP, it aint easy for us to cut off all contact with one of our dearest ones. And it's not a low bar for a relationship to try to preserve them and come up with compromises. The son is selfish in dictating his dad who and who not to associate with to emotionally blackmail him instead of helping his dad come up with a compromise such as OP being able to talk to his brother but ensuring the brother is no where near the son which is totally acceptable."
AmItheAsshole,fnbbgzw,t1_fnb7cvz,1586812580.0,Don't you feel that the son is giving the OP an ultimatum when in fact the OP could still maintain a relationship with his brother but keep the brother away from the son. That way the son will never have to talk to the uncle and the OP doesn't have to cut ties with his own family/blood. I think it's selfish and unfair the son is putting is father/OP is such a difficult position and dictating the terms instead of trying to compromise so he won't be the reason his father's heart is broken because he can't talk to his brother.
AmItheAsshole,fnbb0ti,t1_fnb99od,1586812356.0,I don't see any way in which the brother's homophobia is actually hurting the son. I certainly see the son despises the brother and is giving his father(OP) an ultimatum when the father could simply just keep his brother away from the son but still have a relationship with his brother.
AmItheAsshole,fnb6df8,t1_fnafd8k,1586810003.0,For contact to end? So the OP cannot speak to his brother? Or the uncle cannot come over when the son is around? What exactly does the son mean by that? The former is totally not okay. The latter is fine.
AmItheAsshole,fnb65vb,t1_fnabktl,1586809898.0,"It's not right to ask someone to cut off relations with their BROTHER just because you don't like them. As long as the son is not in any danger, nothing is problematic. I love my brother to absolute death where I would sacrifice myself for him, and to cut things off with him? I need to know that my family members are in emotional or physical harm because of him. The uncle isn't making the son feel badly of himself. He certainly seems confident in himself to ask his dad to abandon his own brother."
AmItheAsshole,fnb5txy,t1_fnap4mt,1586809733.0,Not if you don't say a word to the son or anyone in that family since the son has come out and the OP never said anything about the uncle actually talking badly of the son.
AmItheAsshole,fnadqrm,t1_fna3nd5,1586795717.0,"yo why are people downvoting me. I'm just tryna make sure I know everything before I pass judgement. It's easy to make wrong judgements, it's harder to make accurate judgements. let me take my time asking for reasoning before I affirm that OP is TA."
AmItheAsshole,fna3nd5,t1_fna0qmz,1586790398.0,Isn't that the son's choice? I mean the hiding thing. That part was unclear to me from OP's post.
AmItheAsshole,fn9z50r,t1_fn8welo,1586787828.0,"protection from what? OP never said uncle was threatening the son in any way, shape, or form."
AmItheAsshole,fn9z1z2,t1_fn92d81,1586787777.0,aren't you assuming the uncle has actually said or done something disrespectful to the son?
AmItheAsshole,fn9yt0c,t1_fn8un7g,1586787627.0,"OP never said that the uncle directly insults the son. If the uncle treats the son normally, then it's NAH. Because the son is asking one brother to cut off another brother as if that's some easy task and for what? The uncle disagrees with the son?"
AmItheAsshole,fn9yd6o,t3_g0aysp,1586787358.0,"Unless your brother actively puts you son down then NAH. It's simple, your son's logic is totally flawed when it comes to his argument. He doesn't have any special relation with your brother and because his uncle is homophobic, he doesn't like him. You on the other hand have grown up loving him to death as a brother. Unless your brother insults your son, it's a selfish request from your son to cut your brother off as if that's some easy thing to do. Totally NAH"
PoliticalOpinions,fn0pmq4,t1_fmy9yta,1586546352.0,lmao why did people downvote my comment. i didn't say anything that wasn't true lol.
PoliticalOpinions,fmy9yta,t3_fxzq4d,1586481340.0,"You are excited to vote for Biden? You do realize the man has a deteriorating neurological condition and has trouble stringing 3 coherent sentences together right? He is also the same person that said that if Medicare-For-All was passed by house and senate and the bill was sitting on his desk waiting for his approval, he would veto it. And he's going to be a strong ally to progressive causes? He has voted and never apologized for the regime change wars which wasted blood and money. He has been a staunch supporter of the war on drugs which has not worked one bit. He has advocated for social security cuts on 4 separate occasions in his career. Now I'm a conservative populist so I'm not a diehard Bernie supporter but I'm going to tell you, no progressive will be excited to vote for him. He too will be another ""I'll vote for him since he's not as a bad as trump"". He is soooooooooooooo lucky there was an economic breakdown +covid19 cuz otherwise he would have been sweeped."

PoliticalOpinions,fmivmae,t3_fvitv2,1586117825.0,"I'm a huge conservative. Big time. But dude your conclusions are literally sooooooooooo dumb. I hope this is satire because you have got to be an idiot to believe this. Nazis are right wing extremists. It's the left that cares about other people. They aren't selfish. They just want to help people a bit too much. Like come on dude your answer is so biased. You are either really good at annoying people which is what I'm seeing from a lot of lefties in the comments section. Or you're really dumb. Don't get me wrong, there are actually major differences in how conservatives/liberals act and perceive the world but you got it twisted my friend."
