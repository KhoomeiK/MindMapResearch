Things got out of control because we have had an incredibly poor federal governmental response. We have so many cases that we can’t even track who is transmitting the virus to who. Essentially we are just trying to get a handle on things right now. Once we have a better handle on things, we will focus on tracking cases and isolating contacts of the sick people. This will be aided by widely available testing. This is an effective way of controlling infection and when we are able to do this we will see some semblance of normal. You are correct in that a vaccine will likely be the ultimate solution. Based on current models, we will be transitioning strategies in the early summer (May/June-ish). Things may not be normal by the fall, but I don’t think that school will be cancelled."

This is not just effecting older, sicker patients, and thus it is incredibly important that people take social distancing seriously."
