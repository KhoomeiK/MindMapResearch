UCSantaBarbara,fpl1rdt,t1_fpl0jkv,1588704847.0,"“Pushing for more transparency” He doesn’t owe you or your twitter friends with no authority further response on an unproven rumor.  Title IX investigations are private in nature, that’s not how this works.  Have investigation-backed evidence before you go off blasting someone on social media. 

“Before coming at people so negatively without getting the full scope” you mean like how you’re coming at him with unproven rumors of being a predator lmao. The lack of self awareness in the ~woke community~ is so laughable."
UCSantaBarbara,fpky9d5,t1_fpkxnxw,1588703119.0,"The people publicly bashing him and retweeting the rumors are officers affiliated with IVP.  So yes, this responsibility does fall on IVP.  

As for the others who aren’t even in AS but joining the bandwagon of hate cause they’re bored and love the drama, get a hobby."
UCSantaBarbara,fpkwq4q,t1_fpkw5yn,1588702358.0,"The girl running the gauchos4transparency and all the dumb IVP twitter kids retweeting it are asking him to step down or recall the election.  If you’re saying you’re not accusing him of sexual assault, then for what reason should he step down from his position? 

And this wasn’t “an already public situation” lol it’s so obvious all you IVP groupies are behind orchestrating this whole thing cause you’re butt hurt he won."
UCSantaBarbara,fpkm8yl,t1_fpkj7z4,1588697177.0,"It’s so suspicious that IVP only sent him an email the night before the election so they could stir the pot. The girl running the account is handling it so poorly yet all her little twitter friends are gassing her up.   They keep saying “It is not only what you do, but what you don’t do that you should be held responsible for.”  Uh..pretty sure that statement make no sense."
UCSantaBarbara,fpjb61s,t1_fpjax6b,1588662279.0,"I’m just so angry for him and mad that the school lets slander occur like that with no consequence. Let’s say he’s proven innocent, cool but now every future employer is going google his name and see it connected to rape and sexual assault accusations bc of their tweets.  His life is ruined either way."
UCSantaBarbara,fpjalhc,t1_fpj6xwr,1588661737.0,"They literally live on another planet lol.  That’s not how legal cases work, he’s not going to email some twitter randos back knowing everything he says will be used against him knowing how they are"
UCSantaBarbara,fpjaf27,t1_fpj678z,1588661572.0,"Oh my god exactly. It’s so frustrating being POC, it’s always the fake woke white kids twitter community at our school that has the most to say.  They’ll do anything for twitter clout but hide it as “advocating” lol stfu"
UCSantaBarbara,fpj28kc,t1_fpj255g,1588654566.0,Then why are you asking him to step down/trying to get him recalled? That’s so stupid lmao
UCSantaBarbara,fnmow1b,t3_g2k20h,1587075372.0, Tbh I don’t think fall will be online. All of the people claiming they’re considering that are lying bc then UCSB for sure would’ve made session B online already
