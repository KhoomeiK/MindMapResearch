Not anyone's fault, no one could have expected this pandemic and I know everyone is doing what they can to keep things moving forward but what is somebody's fault is the fact that I'M GETTING CHARGED FULL FUCKING PRICE! Admission into UCSC was accepted with the assumption that I would actually have a campus to attend with adequate resources but I'm not getting any of those resources I paid for.

People who have had extensive experience lifting big numbers know that real safety comes from proper technique and bail-out procedures.
2. You can fuck yourself permanently by slipping or your ""knee giving out"" even if you're in a $2000 power rack. Proper technique, bail-out procedures, slight amount of luck and common sense are all you need.

UCSC,fnitpxu,t1_fnhodok,1586986195.0,"The entire Greek network here feels like high school. Everyone knows everyone so drama and rumors spread immediately. Recruitment has been iffy the past few years, which is valid given the overpriced dues and the lack of a Greek row. The city and school have both stifled any progress that the Greek system attempts to make, so what you see is what you get for the most part- 4 social sororities and 3 social fraternities, none of which with real houses.       
The sororities are actually pretty chill, but you have to take them at face value as social groups. They primarily party with TKE, Sig Pi, or AEPi, all of which have been nosediving in terms of quality and respectfulness. I could give you an essay on why each one is below par as a Greek organization and a university organization in general. All of them struggle to find housing, and if you‚Äôre a mildly attractive girl by SC standards you‚Äôll get into their parties without needing to be in a sorority.
