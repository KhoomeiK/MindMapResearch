And you may waste time on this unsolvable problem rather than checking your answers or working on the actual test. And I mean also if you’re a bad test taker you’re being penalized a lot more even if you’re being honest and that’s not necessarily fair since they didn’t do anything bad

So depending on how you feel about math, go for it, if you still feel shaky (like math 1b was a huge grind) maybe put it off till you've settled in a bit more with more courses"
