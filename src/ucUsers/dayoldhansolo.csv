askhotels,fnylrzs,t1_fny2lff,1587367122.0,Group rate is different than long term rate. You'll want to negotiate for a long term rate for yourself only. I don't know how the taxes work in Baltimore but in California a 30+ day stay is tax exempt and there's a simple form the front desk can provide. You would need to look up the laws for Baltimore or ask the hotel directly.
