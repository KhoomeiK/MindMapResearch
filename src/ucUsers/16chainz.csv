Browns,fp3diy6,t3_g784r0,1588277423.0,i loved our draft but as a UT fan i wish we had got Jauan Jennings in the 7th

UCSantaBarbara,fozr06d,t3_gad7tb,1588195348.0,i'm chubby i was very happy and had a good time :)
UCSantaBarbara,foxi3gg,t1_foxglap,1588144680.0,"totally, i think they may have had other income because they only owned 4-5 properties and were mostly duplexes. only nice landlords I had in IV, shame they sold their properties to Wolfe and Associates."
UCSantaBarbara,foxanxr,t1_fowxdf7,1588138420.0,one of them used to be owned by some local landlords. i used to drop my rent off in the mailbox
Browns,fow6l5a,t1_fow5vfw,1588113962.0,there's more really good WRs than there are really good safeties. OBJ is great but Adams is much younger and a special type player. I could see a 1st and a 3rd as a very realistic return for the jets if they trade him this offseason.
Browns,fovhmh2,t1_fovhf4r,1588101462.0,I think Jamal is probably the best safety in the game. total game changer. I think an OBJ type return would be necessary to move him
Browns,fovh199,t3_g9t1e0,1588101178.0,ay go browns from west hollywood :)
Browns,fovgxws,t3_g9tckf,1588101132.0,idk why Texans would trade Kenny Stills or why the Jets would be eager to trade Jamal Adams

Browns,fog0lsv,t1_fofw1aw,1587746067.0,gotta pepper in the fact that he's homeless
Browns,focm4qx,t3_g6tt1a,1587672963.0,"I think giving up a 5th should be enough. There haven't been many other teams linked to him and Washington has 0 leverage. Wrong side of 30, missed a whole season and has an injury history?"
Browns,foclwps,t1_foclbon,1587672889.0,completely agree

LongDistance,fnfklpr,t3_g18g9z,1586909895.0,seems like you both are being immature and negligent. Don't know why you're getting upvoted for putting other people at risk. Selfish.
ucla,fn6xyxs,t1_fn6l1ni,1586709529.0,"yea i think it was like 5.4 billion dollars raised during the campaign, which is different than an endowment but still a huge amount for a public university"
malehairadvice,fn0bqd5,t3_fyf4ki,1586539022.0,"doesn't look that nice, looks kind of offputting"
