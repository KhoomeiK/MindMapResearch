UCSantaBarbara,fpanlr2,t3_gca9n5,1588451880.0,As long as you submitted the actual FAFSA application on time before March 2nd you are good.
UCSantaBarbara,fpang5z,t3_gcbj8n,1588451786.0,Mine was very fast. Through FedEx. I ordered like Monday afternoon and it arrived Wednesday afternoon.
UCSantaBarbara,fp92d07,t3_gc3ey7,1588411635.0,They would calculate this summers aid based off the 2019-2020 academic year FAFSA. So it’s kinda  like “leftover” aid = leftover Loans etc.
UCSantaBarbara,fp8tkii,t1_fp8t8a7,1588402528.0,Manzi is mostly 2nd years tho and further away from the classes etc. but it is nice n quiet.
UCSantaBarbara,fp3beiz,t1_fp3arbn,1588276375.0,Be grateful. They could have just given us a portion of it not the whole thing. Ex. undoc Stu don’t qualify for the gov one so OFAS put up a fund to give them a similar grant
UCSantaBarbara,fp3b585,t3_gb2kgt,1588276247.0,"Yes I just saw mine too! And Eligibility is based of your 2019-2020 FAFSA or Dream App. Grant amounts range from $650 to $1,700"
UCSantaBarbara,fp39byx,t1_fp2klj3,1588275348.0,"Eligibility is based of your 2019-2020 FAFSA or Dream App. Grant amounts range from $650 to $1,700"
UCSantaBarbara,fp1khk0,t3_garppk,1588238623.0,For citizens it shows up as “Cares grant”. For undoc students it shows up as “UCSB Covid 19 relief”
UCSantaBarbara,fozlbzd,t1_foyvlue,1588192580.0,"Honestly the community is pretty chill here. I don’t know of anyone being rude over body size etc. I’m sure small very petite and I also didn’t think I would fit in with all the tall UCSB people. Here, what I noticed most people care about is their health.  I bike and walk a lot when I’m on campus and that might help(?) anyways best of luck don’t get discouraged by the idea of not fitting the “stereotype “"
Bones,for8aoa,t3_g94aq4,1588007875.0,Maybe the Agent Shaw went on to work with Greys Anatomy? I saw her there as a new intern
DACA,fo9jtff,t3_g6h8r7,1587621595.0,"In California to qualify for the AB 540 many Undoc students use, you need to have graduated from a California high school or from a California community college."
DACA,fo65zvi,t3_g52bgp,1587547797.0,You need to look at the state you are applying in. Some don’t allow it and can even land you in more trouble. While others like California have the Dream App so students can receive institutional and state aid.
UCSantaBarbara,fnwy5gp,t1_fnwxgkq,1587327753.0,Me too I skipped class to attend my appointment and I felt it was a whole waste. I hurt my shoulder n she was like oh maybe it’s just stress just stretch before going to sleep. It lasted LESS thn 10 MIN n my shoulder was really hurting.
UCSantaBarbara,fnk1rjp,t1_fnjy3dy,1587012488.0,Yeah there are some buses from campus that stop in front of grocery stores like Albertsons. So it’s really not that far. You get on the bus for free by swiping your UCSB access card.
UCSantaBarbara,fncz3x6,t1_fncmfr3,1586852376.0,Honestly it’s not that bad. There’s more first years living off campus thn you think. I did it my first year in an apt with 6 ppl 3 of us were 1st years (random matching) and I had so much fun. I recommend bc I saved so much money doing that.
UCSantaBarbara,fn0tumj,t3_fyldrm,1586548629.0,Oh man I thought it was just my WiFi.
EntitledPeople,flzlwqy,t1_flzgnza,1585626922.0,"I think it depends on the school and how they do it. I went to mine and it was amazing. We had it at a small amusement park 40 min from where HS is. We had a carousel, hot air ballon rides, games etc. after we did all that there was a big room for us to do the dancing/ eat that was beautifully decorated."
