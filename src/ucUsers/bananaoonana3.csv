Hi! I’m 20 (21 in June), and I’m from a small town in Southern Colorado! I currently attend UC San Diego, and am studying Human Development. My ultimate goal is to someday become an Occupational Therapist. :) 

I have always been Catholic, and it is incredibly important to me to find a guy who has those strong Catholic values as well.

Some other things about me 

- I am a proud Latina 🇲🇽
- I can’t really dance, but I’m willing to try
- I love going on walks/jogs 👟
- Rush Hour 2 is my favorite movie (I can basically quote the whole movie), Shrek and Rocky IV are close seconds! 
- I’m a decent cook 🍳
- during the quarantine I’ve been playing words with friends wayyyy too much
- I struggle a lot with my prayer life, so I appreciate any tips on how to get back on track 🙏🏽 Additionally, I feel like I’ve had many doubts ever since I got to college, and I’m just trying to understand my faith better so that I’m not just going through the motions. 
- honestly somewhat of a hopeless romantic 🥀

Availability is most definitely not booked out for the next 4 weeks. ^^ If you need this resource there are plenty of open slots for next week. And yes, you can totally do a walk in too."
