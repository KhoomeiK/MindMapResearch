UCDavis,fp90ouj,t3_gc1bxn,1588409829.0,"I would recommend using windows instead of Mac if you know you‚Äôre gonna use multiple softwares for your classes or projects (GIS, Flowmaster, etc) unless you don‚Äôt mind installing boot camp on Mac or using virtual lab online or using alternative softwares."
UCDavis,fosh2sr,t3_g9aq47,1588030573.0,"I was in the same situation two years ago. (I was a transfer student). UCSD‚Äôs chemE program is under the department of NanoEngineering. Their program leans more toward to the NanoEngineering side than ‚Äúgeneral ChemE stuff‚Äù. I went for a campus tour by myself and talked to their major advisor. I think it‚Äôll be helpful if you can schedule for a virtual advising appointment with them. I personally am not interested in NanoEngineering and so I chose UCD instead. However, they might have chances their program, don‚Äôt rely too much on the information I just said. I found some chemE students on the UCSD Facebook group as well. They were willing to answer my questions and any concerns I have, especially if you‚Äôre interested to know the situation of job market. It might be helpful if you hit someone up on Facebook and ask them questions regarding the program. If you‚Äôre really interested in UCSD‚Äôs program, then go for it. I think studying what‚Äôs interested you the most is more important. Besides, NanoEngineering is kinda unique (I think?) so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be hard get a job in that area (comparing to getting a job in general chemE market competing with other fresh grads). Good luck!"
