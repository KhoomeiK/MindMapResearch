SPOILERS ahead for anyone who hasn't seen the episode yet



I do find a bit of a disconnect that they're adding such a huge plot point in the story that was never mentioned during the original trilogy. Just seems a bit odd that a former Jedi apprentice leading half a batallion of clones to capture a known Sith that escaped death once already was never brought up during the council meetings. Or Anakin asking for uldates from if his former Padawan is ok. I guess I could see it if Obi Wan was trying to keep that mission a secret from the council but I don't see any reason for that either. Maybe I'm missing something someone can fill me in on. 

Technicalities aside I loved everything about this"
