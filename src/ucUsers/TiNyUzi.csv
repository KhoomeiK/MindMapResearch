UCSantaBarbara,foyaxsn,t3_g3x6oh,1588169116.0,Hi. I just got admitted for pre-chem as a transfer for Fall 2020. Does anyone know if UCSB is chill about dropping a spring course and taking it over summer at community college prior to transfer? I dropped a course and already registered it for summer.

college,foqref3,t1_foqpka6,1587999445.0,"Nah not me lol. I went to a CC too. I'm speaking for those who attend these private liberal art schools, which I see as scams. They're handing out degrees that they know won't pay off compared to how much they charge their students. And even non-liberal art private schools are crazy! They charge like $70k/year at USC for example. No undergrad degree is worth that much. It's crazy that they can get away with this. I feel like the debt of a lot of these schools ruins those who strictly want to pursue their passion."
college,foqqq3p,t3_g8fah1,1587999092.0,"You need to mix both of them if you can. Passion+financial aspects of a job MATTER. Ppl here love to stick to the passion side of things which is the root of the problem for new college grads who can't find a job in their field. It's now getting to a point where instead of bachelors, jobs want masters degrees minimum. People need to understand that college is not a place of passion, but more of a financial investment into one's future.

If you ignore the price tag until the end to pursue music theory, then idk what to say. Too many ignorant college students not caring enough. Research your field of study that interests you and see if you can make a living with it. If not, move on to whatever else interests you. 

You can't be happy with a job of passion if it pays the same as mcdonalds and you have to live on your own, at your own place, with mountains of compounding debt. It just ain't worth the stress."
college,foqpdrx,t1_fon6ut7,1587998367.0,"TBH, this is why the typical college grad is in debt and miserable. ""Follow your dreams"" yea, not if ain't worth. If you're at least a tiny bit intelligent, you'd realize pumping out $40,000/yr at a private school to major in art or music or english won't be worth it at the  end. Burnout will come more from having to work so much because your wage is low, not from doing a job that makes a good amount of money that you don't enjoy. Work is work.

4 years of hard work, in a respectable field of study, can pay off well. Most go on and study more years of school because of MONEY. Everything at the end of the day comes down to money whether we like it or not. School is expensive and ignoring that price tag + majoring in just whatever, is the root of the problem for college grads these days."

GERD,fnmftlc,t3_g2iifb,1587070659.0,"One tip that'll go a long way is: find out for yourself. Seriously. I see sites online listing common GERD triggers that I eat all the time and feel fine. In general tho, any food high in fat usually is what to avoid. When first starting protonix, I couldn't eat anything with fat in it. Now, I can eat a lot of GERD-trigger foods while on the medicine. I feel like I can eat anything in moderation while on Protonix. Anything besides pure chocolate. 

I had to slowly reintroduce trigger foods in my diet to see if my body could handle them over time and it seems to be working. Onions, tomatoes, pizza, cheese, fried foods, etc all are able to be eaten in moderation without heartburn, personally. Still isn't healthy and I don't eat like this often.

Everyone is unique tbh. For example, I can't even eat bananas cuz they trigger GERD for me. IDK why. Yogurt too, hurts my stomach. They just get stuck in my esophagus and I have to force swallow it, and it hurts."

And yea, a good diet + not eating before bed could work, and idk about you... but as someone who exercises daily, I get bad GERD symptoms after almost every session. I stopped doing cardio cuz of this. Don't get me wrong tho, somehow GERD has made me be in the best shape of my life. It forces me to have a good diet. It's a blessing in disguise, I guess. But it definitely limits the quality of my workouts."

Personally I've been putting out free guides on programming topics and I'm looking to put out a course that makes me some side money.

Good points. Thanks for the work advice but I'm outta work til whenever this covid bs ends. But, you bringing up side money/hustles reminds me of when I used to make YouTube vids and sell designer clothes. I guess I can start that up again.
