braces,fmyynak,t1_fmyv6k9,1586499984.0,"I have this feeling that my teeth simply don't move too much. My braces were to correct a bite issue, and my teeth were already relatively straight. 

I get the whole ""wear them every night"" but if your teeth fit back in without an issue, doesn't that mean there was no movement? and if there was no movement in 3 months of not wearing them, then doesn't that mean you can wear them less often than every single night.

unless there is something I am missing about the facts of teeth movement, the response and recommendation of every night seem very canned for my specific case.

I'm just being pragmatic. I don't always remember to wear them, I travel often and I worry more about losing my retainer than bringing it with me everywhere I go.

also, i have a permanant botom retainer"
