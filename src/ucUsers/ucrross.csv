It's an acronym for something, but even my friend who works the group couldn't tell me what it stood for.

During the financial crisis a decade ago, staff were furloughed and put on reduced time (and salary) for several months. Some were laid off, but the campus worked hard to minimize the damage by not filling positions. I anticipate that this will happen again - especially over the next two years as the economy hopefully sorts itself out.

Complicating this is the fact that UCR is already understaffed. Prior to the crisis, VC Bomotti shared data that showed that UCR had \~760 fewer staff members than it should have (when comparing student to staff ratio). We are already a lean campus, and in some ways this might actually help us in some ways since we don't have a lot of excess positions that we can afford to cut.

Does the UC have its faults? Yes. Is one of those faults that they are playing with a pile of money while students struggle to pay their bills? No."
