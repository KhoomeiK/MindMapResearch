UCSD,fplw92i,t1_fplt5xg,1588720680.0,"If there’s an online option I bet there’s a portion that will stay home instead of moving on campus, also international students probably won’t be able to travel back here. From there maybe they could prioritize people with unstable/abusive living situations"
UCSD,fplrn8y,t3_gdtzm0,1588718157.0,"I think DOC could be informative, but I just found the structure of the class to be pretty counterproductive. Also the professors/TAs were very strict and expected far too much out of a GE course imo"
CoronavirusCA,fpkuxfo,t1_fpksfhs,1588701467.0,So why limit the beach as opposed to all of those things that you think are spreading the virus? With the exception of stopping for gas its easy to get to the beach without doing those things
CoronavirusCA,fpku7md,t1_fpktl5h,1588701110.0,The bathrooms are closed. Which is also a completely different problem than the beaches
CoronavirusCA,fpkqvt3,t1_fpkoyqd,1588699464.0,"[Seems like outdoor transmission of the virus is pretty rare](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1). Now thats not to say that people should be in each others faces/protesting, and I'm not trying to say that the people that were at the beach last weekend researched outdoor transmission of COVID-19 before driving down. But I wouldn't exactly say that lives were put in significant danger by going to the beach."
CoronavirusCA,fpkp7wk,t3_gdzgkr,1588698644.0,"I am so glad that people are finally recognizing this. I’m constantly being downvoted on this subreddit for pointing out how unnecessary the beach closures are and being called “selfish” and “entitled”. The virus is a problem but there’s no reason to restrict access to areas if it’s not going to prevent the spread of the virus. Clearly as long as people follow social distancing on the beach as they have been, it’s a non-issue."
UCSD,fpiv4ei,t1_fphvlcn,1588649428.0,">  Is this in reference strictly to campus gatherings and parties? Or is the campus simply a drag?

There are school-sanctioned events/concerts that can be fun depending on what you make of them but dorm parties get shut down so quick. You just really just need to make the connections with the right people through clubs or Greek life in order to get to off-campus parties, they won't just fall into your lap. As far as the campus itself, I personally find that making friends or talking to people in-class is pretty difficult as most people are more focused on studying or something so thats probably why people call it socially dead. So in summary you just need to put yourself out there."
CoronavirusCA,fphgs2z,t1_fpfepr5,1588621011.0,"This is what I’ve noticed. Most people that want the beaches to close are people that don’t go to the beach or aren’t from coastal cities. And then when we articulate reasons how it is possible to limit the spread of the virus on the beach, they call us entitled and selfish."
CoronavirusCA,fphg3pz,t1_fpfd1xx,1588620671.0,This is the other thing. We’re spending so much money for increased lifeguard and police patrol to close down the beach meanwhile rapists and pedophiles get let out of jail.
CoronavirusCA,fphft4v,t1_fpfdjhq,1588620521.0,"Yes, a 6 am surf on my own hundreds of feet from everyone is definitely killing thousands of people"
CoronavirusCA,fph3vvm,t1_fpffoaw,1588614508.0,"This is a confusing comment. So you want everyone to come from out of town and crowd up San Diego now instead (the same thing that happened in Orange County last weekend)? How does that help accomplish the goals of the beach closure? I don't think it's the end of the world, just wondering your reasoning."
UCSD,fpegu1h,t1_fpeew00,1588547278.0,"Nah, I’m white and I’ve never experienced racism. If anyone is gonna blow off someone’s experience with racism as “salt” then I’m gonna call them out on it. The other stuff I couldn’t care less."
Lifeguards,fpdq45t,t3_gck8xr,1588531969.0,Yes but don’t think you’re hot shit just because you did pool lifeguarding before. Ocean lifeguarding is a whole different beast and set of skills.
UCSD,fpbkh4i,t1_fpbhopf,1588472088.0,Pretty appalling how you’re willing to blow off OPs experience with racism like that just because you had a different experience at the school.
orangecounty,fp5tjl9,t3_gbaduu,1588339575.0,"Downvote away, but the closures are pretty much just a punishment from Newsom and that’s why people are taking this in bad taste. He closed only Orange County- if he really wasn’t trying to punish us then he would’ve just closed all the beaches in the state. I just think other compromises could’ve been made like allowing surfing/running/swimming but not letting people camp on the beach that would’ve made everyone happy. But seems it’s past that point now."
CoronavirusCA,fp0v6by,t1_fozztiz,1588217645.0,"I'm a UCSD student, and its not surprising at all. Chancellor Khosla gives no fucks about students, he is constantly overcrowding the school and starting more construction projects so that the school can make more money."
UCSD,fozoyqu,t3_ga339c,1588194332.0,"You’ll have a hard time working full time during normal business hours, especially once you get into your higher level classes most course times are during the day. Some classes podcast/don’t require attendance but you usually have to go in person to take midterms and finals. As far as the workload goes while working full time, its difficult but manageable. I work a 4 10s schedule and usually work nights/weekends to not conflict with class and I usually am able to get my work/studying done but your mileage may vary."
UCSD,foyu6qq,t1_foyt9mp,1588179241.0,"I made a comment on the post hoping for a clarification, which is to be expected after big announcements like this. People have questions, this is a weird time in our lives and these are not ridiculous things to ask by any means. Most of my comments on this thread have been replying to you blowing off my questions as “unimportant”, which would piss off anybody. Especially since my concerns apply to so many people at this school"
UCSD,foyqi27,t1_foyp57p,1588177307.0,"If the school releases a statement like this, I’d expect clarification. I’ve been bothered by what’s going to happen in fall for weeks, as have many people. Don’t act like you know me or how I would act “dude”."
UCSD,foynn9m,t3_ga6hid,1588175785.0,"I fall asleep early out of boredom. If I lay on my bed or couch and try to watch TV or Netflix or something I just end up falling asleep, even if it’s only 9:30pm. Before I would at least have homework or other stuff to do to keep me awake until 12 or so"
CoronavirusCA,foydes1,t1_foxf3oi,1588170477.0,"You need to relax. The fact is that the lockdowns were never meant to last forever, it’s merely to buy time to get infrastructure prepared. The goal posts are constantly being moved so that now people think we can somehow eradicate this virus by staying home for over a year but it’s just not in the cards. It’s unreasonable to expect people to stay in their homes for over a year with no exercise, and it’s not selfish for people to want to surf/run/swim on their own. I never said anything that even remotely condoned the protests or any large gatherings, all I said was that we should consider enforcing a softer lockdown as opposed to fully shutting down. I do not see a risk in going for a run on my own hundreds of feet from others."
UCSD,fox7cfe,t1_fow4i6i,1588135891.0,"I'm not asking them to provide any answer with certainty, I'm literally just saying that I wish they would clarify what their plan is. Obviously I don't expect them to magically cure the coronavirus LOL"
CoronavirusCA,fowmvds,t3_g9t72i,1588122926.0,"I would much rather shift to something like what San Diego is doing where you can surf, run, exercise, etc on the beach but you're not allowed to set up camp all day as opposed to closing everything down. There's really no problem as long as people stay away from each other and that seems like a good compromise to not drive people nuts. Especially since most of the evidence is pointing toward the infection risk outdoors being relatively low compared to indoors."
UCSD,fow826g,t1_fow6v33,1588114737.0,"Yes, I know that it’s constantly changing; that has been the theme of the whole world the last two months. I would like them to expand upon what their ideal situation is so that I can at least plan for that."
UCSD,fovv88n,t1_fovustc,1588108105.0,"Hope you’re right but like I said, it needs to be clarified by the school itself so that people don’t needlessly spend money on housing"
UCSD,fovtqc5,t1_fovs1cq,1588107364.0,"I would hope you’re right and they didn’t bother regulating it, but I would also imagine that the priority for online seats would go to people in areas where travel is restricted as opposed to people like me who would just rather not commute 2 hours to school."
UCSD,fovs1yf,t1_fovrnz8,1588106540.0,"It’s vague because they didn’t expand upon the extent to which classes will be available remotely. Will EVERY class be remote, or just a few courses in each department/major? Will remote instruction be reserved/limited for international students who can’t travel to the country or will everybody have the option? Will courses with lab components and other small (less than 15 people) courses be offered online for ANYBODY who wants them? These are things that need to be clarified for people trying to sign a lease agreement and not waste thousands of dollars on housing."
UCSD,fovrd4d,t3_g9uvxa,1588106200.0,"As someone who’s already used two years of on campus housing and isn’t from the SD area, this is pretty much not helpful at all. Do I need to find a place to live or not?"
UCSD,fofqv3l,t3_g74t2u,1587741201.0,"I’m gonna go against the grain here and say no, but that doesn’t mean I hated it at UCSD. I made some great friends, lived near the beach, got to get used to living on my own, and got a great education while doing it. But to me, I am not a huge fan of the culture of the school and how focused it is on academics as opposed to having a fulfilling social life. A lot of people are kind of stuck up about academics and how smart they are and that kind of gets on my nerves. Most people at this school don’t want to be friends with me I found, and even though I was able to find a great group of friends, I do think if I could go back I’d go somewhere that I would have the more “typical” college experience with bigger sports games and more social culture (among other things). But UCSD wasn’t a bad choice by any means, just make sure you know what you’re getting into."
UCSD,fo79lr1,t1_fo63ua1,1587574595.0,"Buddy, you comment this in almost every thread about fall quarter but the fact is that nobody really knows how the virus is gonna behave."

UCSD,fnw3q4r,t1_fnvqfa4,1587310819.0,Usually freshmen/transfers need to attend their first quarter. But it’s possible they might give exceptions for these types of circumstances. Just cross your fingers.
CoronavirusCA,fnqmn55,t3_g3aoo8,1587167681.0,"Drove by these morons today, one guy was holding up a sign that said ""COVID 19 IS A LIE"" while wearing a mask and gloves. I knew stuff like this would happen in OC, there's just no reasoning with these people."
UCSD,fnq1gmz,t1_fnpk510,1587155882.0,"Yea, I definitely agree that it’s unreasonable to expect a multi year lockdown. But colleges kinda seem like the “low-hanging fruit” to people when it comes to breaking up large gatherings. I’m not even sure how many people are gonna be comfortable going to class in the fall either way, especially large 100+ person lectures. I definitely hope I’m wrong though."
UCSD,fnpj7bq,t1_fnpi23r,1587146434.0,"Yea the state is gonna go into a huge recession, but Newson has still made it clear he’s gonna prioritize stopping the spread of the virus over the economy. No matter what your opinion or my opinion is about classes coming back, I find it unlikely that Governor Newsom would want that to happen. Obviously we have no idea how bad things will be by then but they’re gonna have to make the call at some point."
UCSD,fnowmsl,t3_g2t2kn,1587134996.0,"You guys are forgetting that the UC system is funded a lot from the state. Governor Newson is being very proactive about doing what he can to prevent the virus spread, so I’m guessing he would have pretty big influence on this and would rather universities go online for fall."
CoronavirusCA,fnnjael,t3_g2p73f,1587093684.0,"As a UC student, it’s pretty laughable to see Napolatino asking for more money because she cares so much about the students. She is repeatedly trying to raise tuition and fucks students every step of the way in favor of research which brings in more money. She’s just trying to keep lining her pockets through this whole thing"
CoronavirusCA,fnnj1vi,t3_g2q532,1587093521.0,"I’m not a parent but these types of questions don’t really mean much, we have no clue what things will be like in the fall."
UCSD,fnmurv6,t1_fnmu5fe,1587078555.0,Yea I’d say it starts getting crowded around 4 and doesn’t settle down until like 10ish. I usually went around 7-7:30am ish and would never have a problem getting a rack or a bench. There’s also an app called UCSD Waitz that tells you how full the gym is.
UCSD,fnmttqt,t3_g2pmte,1587078039.0,"There’s 3 gyms here, but 1 of them (RIMAC) is more popular than the other 2. RIMAC has a good amount of equipment (6? Power racks I believe) but it gets crowded pretty often. The other 2 are less crowded but are smaller and less equipment. If you go early morning or at night then the gyms are great"
UCSD,fnk6nif,t1_fnk5xes,1587016569.0,Idk about the other quarters before. But basically they expect that you spend your dining dollars evenly across three quarters. So they refunded you the spring quarter housing + 1/3 your dining plan. But I’m guessing you had less than 1/3 of your dining plan left so they charged you the difference to make up for it. If that’s not the case then I’m not sure.
UCSD,fnk5po2,t3_g28izl,1587015748.0,"I’m guessing you took a refund on your housing? It includes a dining dollar refund, so in your case I’m guessing they took out the amount that you were over your dining dollar plan for fall and winter"

UCSD,fnhxch0,t3_g1frsd,1586970423.0,I feel like the TAs/professors for all the writing series feel the need to “prove themselves” as a difficult class so that people will take the writing series seriously even though it seems like usually people don’t enjoy them too much
UCSD,fn8e511,t1_fmytjqj,1586739614.0,"Marshall student here, and nah you have the option to get as involved as you want. The writing series (DOC) is really intensely focused on that sort of thing so you'll get exposed to a lot of activists but you don't have to do anything except take the classes. If you're not used to it, it might be a pretty big culture shift since a lot of people around you will end up getting involved."
madlads,fn5lkb6,t1_fn4zb6a,1586668200.0,"In some ways yes, but drawing pictures of the backside of God was still highly controversial. A lot of religious officials thought the Sistine Chapel Ceiling was way too obscene for a place of worship."
madlads,fn5lc0l,t1_fn4xq0z,1586668013.0,"Nah you were right. It was often speculated that Michelangelo was homosexual but he tried to emulate Jesus and everyone around him would say that he did not partake in “earthly desires” such as eating food for pleasure, so needless to say he probably wasn’t having sex"

UCSD,fn3ko4q,t3_fz2hh4,1586622665.0,"I signed up for 5 classes and might drop to 4 but that’s mostly because the content is really tough, not because of a workload issue. Units seem like a useless metric anyways this quarter because there’s so much variation between class workloads"
UCSD,fn18zmf,t3_fypxdq,1586557177.0,"Depends class to class. Seems like most classes have some sort of lecture component still with many using zoom, but some are prerecorded and use scheduled “lecture time” as office hours."

UCSD,fmxrxna,t3_fxxzpc,1586470697.0, I’m taking 18 units (4x4 unit classes and 2 unit lab) and I feel like it’s doable so far because 3 of my classes are basically free units. I thought I was gonna need 2 classes in the fall to graduate but now that SS is online I might just take 1 class each summer session and be done with it.
UCSD,fmxjnyr,t1_fmx011j,1586466245.0,"Chest: push-ups or weighted push-ups (with a backpack, weight vest, or anything heavy really) are an easy one. I really like archer push ups which are a type of one-arm push ups, you can look up tutorials online. 


Legs: classic bodyweight squats work well, there’s also single leg/pistol squats if you’re looking for something a little tougher. Stairs with or without a weight vest/backpack are also really good, or you can do step-ups to substitute. Lunges are also good. 


Back: pull-ups are pretty killer (I do weighted pull ups, but generally you should stick to bodyweight pull ups until you can easily do 15+), and not too hard to find a place to do them including playgrounds (as long as you’re super careful to sanitize the area, stay away from people, and wash your hands) or just around your house. Hinging motions (deadlift muscles) can be activated with burpees or if you have a kettlebell/dumbbell swings. 


Cardio: this is easy cause you can just run but I like to do a lot of high intensity training which will either be hill sprints, or a fast circuit of different exercises above. For longer steady state training you can go for a run or hike or jump rope."
UCSD,fmxhy81,t1_fmxfif1,1586465325.0,"Yea agreed there’s no simple answer, its just one way they could reconcile people trying to figure out their off-campus living situations and wanting to return back to normal classes."
UCSD,fmwt26q,t1_fmwsc4v,1586452532.0,"Maybe after fall quarter they could continue to have in-person lectures for people that can and want to go, but still require that everything is podcasted/available asynchronously for people that have different housing situations?? idk"
UCSD,fmwrgl6,t1_fmwqaat,1586451721.0,"Yea, to me it seems like they'll probably have to decide whether fall quarter is online within the next few weeks.

CoronavirusCA,fmt70zi,t1_fmt6s2b,1586367884.0,Yea agreed it’s definitely working but I’m saying that letting people declare victory now could cause them to relax. Here’s to hoping they keep it up.

CoronavirusCA,fmt3hk4,t3_fx8xu1,1586366270.0,Coronavirus is absolutely not contained in California. Better than other states for sure but to declare victory now is simply incorrect. Headlines like this are dangerous and could cause people to relax on social distancing.
UCSD,fmqzurv,t3_fwtowd,1586310665.0,"I’m gonna guess that they will be online. Things will probably start opening up slowly by then, non-essential businesses and elementary schools for instance (people need to go back to work, and people need somewhere to leave their kids while they’re working). But it would still be smart for large events to still be off limits and for colleges to be online since college courses can be online “easier”. It’ll be some balance of some things being open and some closed. Again this is just my opinion though, I don’t really know for sure"

Right now I only have 1 running HIC (hill sprints) because of convenience during lockdown.

Nowadays I track progression by adding weight vest weight or time for the running HICs"
CoronavirusCA,fmlculc,t1_fml9fvb,1586183836.0,"I suspect this is a troll but I’ll bite. The whole point is that social distancing delays the amount of people getting the virus at the same time. If the spread of the virus is prolonged EVEN THOUGH THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE MIGHT GET THE VIRUS there’s more opportunity for treatments to be explored, and there’s more personnel/equipment available for any given patient. Therefore, there are less overall deaths in theory with social distancing. You seem to think that it would be better if everyone all got sick at once because it would run its course quicker, but that would just cause thousands of needless deaths. Of course nobody believes that lockdown will be in place for over a year to wait for a vaccine, but during this initial wave slowing down the spread is the best we can do. 


And of course I understand how models work, there’s no need to tell me to “do my research”. Italy and New York are not 1:1 models to California but they are places where the virus is more advanced in running its course. My point was simply that the virus is not to be underestimated, not that you should take it as an exact model to come. And I agree that they do probably have it worse off in those places. But to feel invincible and say that the virus would not be dangerous in a California without shelter in place right now is just blindness."
