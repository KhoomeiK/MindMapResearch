berkeley,fphtstx,t3_gdjein,1588627674.0,"not on the course staff, but based on what i've heard from others, the grade only serves as a cutoff. what really matters is your teaching experience/how you perform during the interview"
berkeley,fphlg9n,t3_gdi2nx,1588623356.0,"the A+ won't really mean much, but I think you should still study because the material covered after mt2 (sorting, graphs) is still important"
berkeley,fpf3zll,t1_fpf3ekq,1588561238.0,"thats true. i'm guessing this final is gonna be harder than previous years like MT2, to prevent cheating"
berkeley,fpcijm6,t3_gcmwmu,1588501829.0,"learning the basic syntax of java should be enough imo. I don't think watching all the lectures would be effective because for me, I learned the most from doing hws/labs/projects. Are you taking 61b in the summer or fall?"
berkeley,fp92mi8,t1_fp8xykq,1588411925.0,"the other option was to take the exam during finals week, for which it was originally scheduled. i guess people voted for the earlier option to get their grades early to decide if they want to P/NP or take the course for a grade. the material for the last week (streams, macros) was made optional"
berkeley,fp92d56,t3_gbt5p1,1588411639.0,Bold of you to assume that I have friends
berkeley,fp8p8ae,t3_gc13h6,1588398606.0,I think it would be fairly difficult since the averages were somewhere around 45% (don't remember what years)
berkeley,fp8nh0o,t1_fp8j92n,1588397128.0,that's why i always stuck to integration tests instead of manually testing commands. much safer lol
berkeley,fp53xpk,t3_gbcgfo,1588315510.0,"I would recommend data 8 (you get an intro to programming + stats). The only experience I had going into 61a was APCS, and I thought the class was pretty fast paced. The class probably would've been much harder if I had never coded before."
berkeley,fp4iah7,t1_fp4ewss,1588299657.0,im sure you could find moral ways to make money
berkeley,fp3bnx8,t3_gb20rw,1588276503.0,"with the possibility of fall being online (see weaver's post), it may be possible that people want to take it to avoid the hardware portion of the labs (which can take a while)"
berkeley,fp1nsfo,t3_gasie0,1588241955.0,"For Fall 2019, the A bin got shifted down like 1 or 2 points"
berkeley,foq4obq,t1_foq4h7i,1587982881.0,yeah that seems fine. the homework sets can be long sometimes but you would still have some time to relax over the summer
berkeley,foq4ede,t3_g8xut0,1587982594.0,definitely would NOT recommend taking three classes in the summer lol
berkeley,fooel71,t1_foo6394,1587937569.0,you got this bro
berkeley,foo4nql,t3_g8kf8h,1587932423.0,how do u know that you'll get a B in 70 when the course hasn't even started lol
berkeley,fo8wzi9,t3_g6cyr6,1587605603.0,"first try to figure out how to implement persistence, and then you can determine what classes you need"
berkeley,fo61bjp,t1_fo5mlgu,1587542814.0,even though the other projects had skeleton code doesn't mean that people didn't struggle on them...
berkeley,fo26jnr,t3_g59b7i,1587451322.0,this is pretty much how every l&s intended cs major thinks lmao
berkeley,fnqqyv7,t1_fnqp9nz,1587170300.0,"not sure how my comment comes off as snobby, im just stating a fact"
berkeley,fnqmzl6,t3_g3b1zj,1587167883.0,i would argue that fall would be easier if in-person instruction resumes by then because I personally find in-person resources to be more helpful
berkeley,fnqhsph,t3_g3ce32,1587164882.0,plenty of people here chose Berkeley over UCLA
berkeley,fnijtwz,t3_g1wfie,1586981235.0,why waste time say lot word when few word do trick
berkeley,fnd7cbv,t3_g137fx,1586861550.0,taking 70 would definitely prepare you for 70 more lol
berkeley,fnawv9b,t3_g0ngfi,1586805240.0,"imo you should just take the summer to relax. once school starts, you wont have that much time to yourself, both during the academic year and in the summer if you get an internship"
berkeley,fn8osyg,t1_fn82b5o,1586746528.0,this is the berkeley subreddit lol what did you expect
berkeley,fn61thi,t1_fn5vzfq,1586684103.0,"not true, some of my friends who were regents and had blackwell as their first choice got unit 1/3"
berkeley,fn0haj5,t3_fycnbp,1586541920.0,"havent taken 61c or 70 yet, but for me in terms of both conceptual difficulty and workload:

61b > 16b > 16a

61b has been the hardest class for me based on the amount of material they expect you to learn in a relatively short timespan"
berkeley,fmyu4i4,t1_fmytiz8,1586495826.0,lmao i think we all knew this was gonna happen
berkeley,fmyu1z1,t1_fmytpw3,1586495765.0,"i still hope they account for this tho, cuz some of the problems were legible"
berkeley,fmytri9,t1_fmytn15,1586495514.0,"i was able to load the test, but I refreshed it since some of the images weren't showing up and it locked me out RIP"
berkeley,fmythmc,t3_fy8w9z,1586495275.0,people who didn't refresh got like 20 extra minutes :/
berkeley,fmukojj,t3_fxhs4m,1586393292.0,dont go on discord for advice
berkeley,fmkcbzt,t1_fmka6pp,1586150388.0,"honestly, with summer classes being online, 61a might be a little more difficult than it has been in previous summers due to the lack of in-person help and increased difficulty of exams to prevent cheating"
