berkeley,fohor6j,t3_g7ghw3,1587769703.0,"Go the cc route and transfer in. Many lower division classes are ridiculously hard/competitive because over half the class already knows the subject well enough to teach it. Take those classes at a community college, transfer in, and you won't go through that trauma and just take the saner way more interesting upper div classes. If you are doing something math/sciency avoid Math 1A, 1B, 53, and 54."
SandersForPresident,fnqz556,t3_g39qnt,1587175458.0,"Speaker Pelosi is getting old, its time for a change in leadership."
SandersForPresident,fnqyw8a,t1_fnqxwm6,1587175293.0,"Remember Eric Cantor, Republican Majority Leader in the house?  He got unseated by some rando tea partier in the primary.  After that the entire republican party really started caving to tea party demands.  Unseating Pelosi could have a similar effect."
SandersForPresident,fnqyoi5,t1_fnqsd8q,1587175154.0,Im hoping that if Buttar can unseat Pelosi it will cause the democratic party to shift way more progressive.  Sort of like when the tea party unseated Eric Cantor.

collapse,fnisgmk,t1_fnhjare,1586985570.0,"I haven't been keeping up too closely with the bulletin in recent days, but I remember them doing quite a few reports on how there is a push to build smaller more useable nuclear weapons for use in a battlefield scenario. The potential for escalation is only going up."
bowhunting,fnir5t4,t3_g1rv4n,1586984911.0,"Do you know the make and model of the bow?  I bought one that looked very similar to this and had a lot of trouble trying to get it fixed up.  One of the shops refused to work on it since they couldnt look up the specs online.

Its a shame because if you want to shoot fingers with a compound bow these days, you are out of luck.  Pretty much everything is sub 40 inch axel to axel, unless you are going for a lever bow/paying 1K for your bow."
science,flw9tq1,t3_frccuo,1585543675.0,"This is super cool.  Whenever I read about anti-asteroid plans, they always seem to suggest hitting it with something at high speed, but then arent sure how it would work in practice. Experiments such as these will make it so that if we do see an asteroid heading towards us, we will have at least a lil bit of info on how things will go down."
