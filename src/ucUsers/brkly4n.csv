berkeley,fp55djj,t3_gbbx13,1588316853.0,"do whatever you can to get an (ideally) related internship if not this summer, then for sure the next.

The only transfer students I knew to land investment banking gigs at Berkeley, were those who went into **community college** already knowing what they wanted to do and did finance related internships beginning then.

Getting into a consulting/investment banking club is ideal, but extremely tough (moreso) for transfer students. If you don't already know someone inside the club, it's gonna be an uphill battle getting in. Which kind of makes sense because if they recruit freshman, then those freshman spend 1-2 years gaining project experience, etc and can transition to becoming mentors for the next cohort, whereas transfers are generally at berkeley for 2 years before leaving."
berkeley,fp54ycw,t3_gb84ga,1588316450.0,"Pre-req technically intro macro. I took that shit like 2 years before 100B tho and completely forgot everything. It was fine tho, intro macro was very surface level and it was chill to relearn everything. IMO, econ 100b basically went more in depth into stuff like PC, AD,AS, stuff and introduced new stuff like interest rates/money supply and how it all fits together in the overall macro view of the economy.

If you have time, would certainly help to review intro macro concepts (i.e. philips curve, ad, as curve)."
berkeley,fp52xv1,t3_gbckl8,1588314605.0,"I mean, it's not really gonna matter either way. Fall is gonna be online too. Summer you have the added benefit of being able to commit 100% or almost 100% of ur time solely to 61A.

I would be shocked if they allowed mass in-person tutoring in the fall -- just seems like an easy way for widespread viral transmission

I'm in 61A this semester, and so far, our online final has felt super fair. There are some really tricky MC questions though"

berkeley,foign21,t3_g7m1y1,1587786191.0,"Im a transfer student. TBH, this is a pretty common thing to be concerned about, though the mindset can be kind of confusing to me.

Yes, UC Berkeley is hard, but that isn't really a bad thing imo. I feel like I've evolved so much since my first semester (and now almost second). Berkeley pushes me to be the best possible version of myself. 

If what you want from your college experience is an easy ride, then no, you probably shouldn't come here. BUT, if you want to grow and be an insanely strong student/candidate for grad school or professional opportunities, then this is the place to be."
berkeley,fnysnth,t3_g4ny10,1587374171.0,"100 is easier overall content-wise and even grade-wise imo. I would say the grade distributions between 100 and 101 are kind of misleading. Students planning on going to grad school for econ etc are gonna be taking 101, and more mathematically stronger students will lean to 101 series.

I spent minimal time on econ 100b (started studying for final 2 days before exam) and cushily ended with an A-. i would definitely have had to spent more time on 101b based on what my firends who took it have told me"
