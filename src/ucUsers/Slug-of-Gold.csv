A premature suspension of social distancing could lead to a new widespread outbreak. Without knowing if this outbreak occurs or not, UCSC must choose between in-person versus online classes.

Consider the contingency table of possible outcomes:

||Fall covid outbreak|No new outbreak|
|:-|:-|:-|
|In-person classes|YIKES|we good|
|Online classes|UCSC chose wisely|Eh, at least no one is dying|

Now, imagine that you are the administrator responsible for making this decision. Which would you choose?"

I think among the biggest challenges with the quarantine is just getting enough exercise and stretching into your day - and you NEED to stretch and exercise every day, otherwise you'll start to feel like a sack of potatoes. Funny enough, but using energy by exercising actually gives you more energy overall.

Get a daily stretching & exercising routine in and I guarantee you'll feel a little better :)"
