UCDavis,fpezxui,t3_gd2imn,1588558609.0,"What sort of questions did you encounter on the math section? 
Theres mostly algebra concepts. Nothing to difficult. Lots of the questions were simplifying questions. There‚Äôs 6 trig questions. I think knowing sohcahtoa is enough for that.

Would you say the chem was difficult or were you just not prepared?
I did prepare for the chem one, but I think I was slacking bc my friends were saying it‚Äôs easy.

Would you recommend aleks for both math and chem tests? I didn‚Äôt do the math aleks, but the chem fantastically helped me. There was chem concepts on there that I forgotten and did not see in YouTube videos. I remember the dog figs annoyed me so much, but the practice does help. I made a chem review notebook. Like 6 little pages. If you would like I could send it to you. In my review book about 60-70% showed up on the test.

Side note: I am kinda good at math, and I was in ap calc bc. But, I took ap chem year before, junior year, so I was dusty on the chem concepts."
UCDavis,fpexvjn,t3_gd2imn,1588557306.0,"I studied everything they said and got a really high math score (took Mat21a bc it‚Äôs required for my major) and a low chem score (3 points below the minimum to get into gen chem). Since I didn‚Äôt pass the chem one I signed up for aleks, and the second time around I did so well I placed into honors (took regular chem tho bc I am not tryna suffer).
So, I mean you may want to put a bit of effort to study concepts like maybe review additional algebra and chemistry notes (they put concepts like Pv=nrt on there)."

UCDavis,fowf9ij,t3_g9yi7c,1588118634.0,"I took 15 units, which I guess is about normal 12-15. I took Math, English, Chemisty, a seminar, an intro class to my major. 

You can actually check exactly how many classes you need by looking up ‚Äúyour major ucdavis‚Äù into google and click on the first website. It will include a couple PDFs about four year plan, class requirements, what classes to take for your major, other interesting stuff."

I thought it would have took me a few more hours before I figured it out! üòÇ"
