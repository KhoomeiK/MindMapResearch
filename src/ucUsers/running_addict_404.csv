Your grade depends for the most part on your TA, you may end up with an easy or tough grader for any writing class. She is also going to take her last writing class this summer before she can graduate... As a six college student, I think our writing program is a lot more helpful and applicable to the type of writing college students encounter (graduate applications, book critiques, resumes... ) . But writing classes is only one consideration, you might like the books Revelle assigns to students. I would say housing and location is another big difference that you need to consider if you are living on campus."

Reliable communication with other teammates is tricky remotely, and grading for team work should lax more and take into consideration of the unique difficulties. I will really appreciate a group project if it is graded on completion and reflection at this time.   
One positive outcome of doing remote group projects tho, at least for me, is having an opportunity to make friends in the class. For my other classes without group projects, I find it hard to really make friends."
