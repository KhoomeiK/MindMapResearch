I was rounding a corner and there was a rattlesnake slithering into the brush on the side of the trail right where I was walking. 

It was mostly curled up and half of it was already under the brush so it was hard to spot. By the time awareness fully kicked in and I was able to hop to the side and get a good look, only the rattle plus a couple inches was left, which quickly disappeared into the brush."

Just move your hands to about 6 inches below and guess what? It's still blowing just as well and it won't deafen you. It might stop sensing you, but it takes half a second to flick your hand up to restart it."

community,fo03o8s,t1_fnzr6kp,1587405520.0,Also a short term spike is not a trend. I think spikes like this are fairly common whenever something appears on Netflix for the first time. It's definitely encouraging though and I hope it continues in the long term.
ucla,fntqz1t,t3_g3urjt,1587247056.0,"Yeah, definitely talk to the instructors, but I'd have to guess it would be somewhat less likely. 

The likelihood that they would record their live lectures should be similar, but they'll be much less likely to have previously recorded lectures from years past that they can reuse. Many of the instructors during summer are grad students or people with less experience teaching, who will correspondingly be much less likely to have those recorded lectures."

https://www.vox.com/2020/3/26/21193848/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths-tests-by-state (it's kept updated btw)

Tests per capita probably isn't the right metric to use, since the number of tests should also be based on the severity of the outbreak in each state. We're about middle of the pack when it comes to % of positive tests based on total number of tests.

For example, New Jersey is pretty high in per capita tests, but 50% of their test are coming back positive, which means they're woefully behind. Louisiana and Massachusetts are in the top 5 of per capita tests, but ~20% of their tests are coming back positive, about twice California's rate.

California's definitely nowhere near where it should be though, and once we get past the initial outbreak part, California really needs to start leading in testing if they want to open the economy back up."
