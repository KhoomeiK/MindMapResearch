The ASUCI constitution allows for direct democracy in the recall of senate but it seems to not have taken into account what would happen if majority of the senate was recalled. Hopefully, there are amendments in the future to create a mandatory timeline for special elections in that case."

Thank you for proving my initial point dear friend. 
Thank you for attending self-destruction 101
Here I award you an “L” for today to match the one you will get on Election Day!"
UCI,fn8o1vq,t1_fn8m00x,1586746052.0,"You are talking about passing a constitution! Hours on end is not enough. There should have been several meeting in the senate allowing for public comments and chances to make changes. But we all know you didn’t want that so that’s why we are here. 

Yet, when majority of the student population showed up to complain at the senate meeting, the bill was still passed. If you don’t care about students why be involved with student government? Answer: agenda.

Then show me where in the constitution, the die process for a senate-led investigation is described. Even the findings from your “investigation” are problematic. Did you ever apologize or ask for senate members to publicly apologize to Isabel? Sorry but you need to accept you didn’t take the right approach.

Well when your agenda has been using power to constantly ignore the wishes of the student population. Yes, it is a problem to have an agenda. I know it’s hard to hear but people see right through your campaign. Many people disagree with your actions. Other people like me are more upset about how many people you are willing to hurt to get what you want. If your agenda aligns with what the people want in a SAG, then you will get elected. Sadly, your past errors will haunt your campaign. Also if you are so eager to hold people accountable then why didn’t you hold senate accountable and push for the recall elections? If you are so sure you didn’t do anything wrong, that would have been the perfect time to show it. 

 I’m sorry my friend but you are not the one who decides who has or hasn’t broken any rules. Just because you believe you haven’t broken any rules, doesn’t mean it wasn’t been done. If more people agreed with y’all on that then the senate would have not been recalled. Also notice how you failed to address actions done by others in your slate. You can’t hold anyone accountable if you don’t know how to hold yourself accountable. You are done kid."
UCI,fn8kcp3,t1_fn8ivt0,1586743619.0,"Unlike many I actually read up on legislation and watch senate meeting so nice try. Silencing student voices has been done time and time again by not only limiting public comment but also by quickly passing legislation that fits your agenda. The constitution was voted on by senate without due process in a matter of days. The Infrastructure Bill was passed even without consulting all the parties involved and with concerns from pro-staff. 

Also you are running for SAG, yet you were the head prosecutor for the ASUCI President. You were okay with prosecuting someone who was investigated by the senate WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO RUN AN INVESTIGATION! How are people supposed to trust you to when you have already shown you are willing to break rules to meet your goals. If you really cared you’d denounce the actions of senators who have time and time again broken rules and abused their powers. You want to be elected as SAG, go on Facebook and denounce members of your own slate for their actions! As Student Advocate General, you need to be able to put your agenda aside and be fair. You’ve already shown you cannot do that."

I know it must suck but imagine how everyone else feels when they see the horrible things ASUCI has done this year. Karma man."
UCI,fmytcn9,t3_fy4nsr,1586495159.0,This also means to vote AGAINST the new constitution. The changes of the constitution provide more power to the senate and is basically their way of saying “direct democracy doesn’t matter”
UCI,fm3dxfg,t1_fm3avae,1585720294.0,Isn’t there more pressing matters like actually moving forward with the senator recalls timeline which the student body voted to recall?
