Bannerlord,fp3m8p5,t3_gb2rwa,1588281790.0,Thanks for the quality post. What are some of your favorite recipes for fast and long 2h? 2h polearm? Name of your favorite 2h grip?
politics,fozvktz,t3_gabym7,1588197636.0,Take off your masks and get on your knees. When the president walks by you are to put your lips on his asshole. Do i make myself clear? And you will enjoy it and tell the press that it was the greatest honor of your life.
aviation,foz8i56,t1_foz11h3,1588186448.0,I think people on reddit are more kind to each other these days. I truly appreciate it.
mountandblade,foz1oda,t3_ga9wjq,1588183152.0,Just let me play
berkeley,foxiqcf,t3_ga3wn5,1588145251.0,Congratulations! You are awesome. I'm sure your parents are proud.
worldnews,fot4ecm,t1_foshshi,1588044395.0,Enjoy your life of anger and loneliness. Never forget that it was your choice all along.
awfuleverything,fosk5us,t1_forw7yi,1588032305.0,I miss those days too. Thanks for taking me back.
mountandblade,fol3udy,t1_fojxunz,1587854349.0,Why don't you duel /u/alcedo_b and find out? My money is on /u/alcedo_b
mountandblade,fo4by8r,t3_g5fsl0,1587501702.0,"I agree. They need to be longer and swing faster. A good player with good footwork should have a big advantage with a 2h vs 1h. In M&B, I could not even get a swing in with 1h vs great sword. This is not true in bannerlord."
gifs,fntk8nk,t3_g3s9eg,1587243331.0,Somehow it still cost too much.
bayarea,fnqqch5,t3_g36hfl,1587169913.0,"Even if you confront this person and threatened to break their kneecaps, they will still litter the next moment. It's best to just accept it and move on. Don't ask me how I know."
mountandblade,fnmk21j,t1_fnj9fxj,1587072839.0,I will send you my companion with the highest Medicine skill.
mountandblade,fnegqgz,t1_fnd5zf9,1586889070.0,They are the fastest but they're not tanks and inflict minimal charge damage. They are still the best for kiting. Pureblood is currently the best.
mountandblade,fncehbb,t3_g0w9b8,1586834795.0,Thanks for providing a workaround. I was beginning to think I could set just one.
mountandblade,fncdngx,t3_g0wguj,1586834237.0,"I agree. I am not impressed and I wish they had more resources to spend on the creative side. But I fully expect that the fan community will fill this gap. After all, I barely played any vanilla warband.p"
mountandblade,fncbplo,t3_g0wite,1586832947.0,It bothers me more than it should.
relationship_advice,fmxlmjl,t3_fxsvgl,1586467295.0,Keep bringing it up everyday and I'm sure you'll change his mind soon. Don't give up.
PublicFreakout,fmn12pv,t1_fmmr9cc,1586215993.0,"I take some comfort in knowing that these people suffer tremendously in their own minds for absolutely no reason. Personally, they are a good reminder that I should focus on the positive things in my life. Hope you are having a good day internet stranger!"
politics,fmihqbb,t1_fmifl8q,1586109803.0,I don't care about politics but damn this man is ugly. That's what surprises me the most. I assumed the idiot who would destroy us would be devilish good looking.
