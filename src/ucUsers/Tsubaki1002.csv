GirlGamers,fosoul8,t3_g98qji,1588034996.0,Omg that's so cute!!! Makes me acknowledge the small things that people do to make people's lives better
GirlGamers,fork6vr,t1_forjqt6,1588013608.0,"Kind of thought it was implied that I liked her build since I was happy to see another woman on the subreddit. I just wish people didn't take things so personally. I get that guys already have a negative view of women because of extreme feminists, but come on. I just said that it's good to see another woman. Since we're part of the same subreddit, I thought it would go without saying that I loved her build."
GirlGamers,forj6ba,t1_forivee,1588013127.0,"Thanks, this really helped. I just feel totally discouraged and ashamed of being a woman."
GirlGamers,forhc41,t1_forgxoy,1588012238.0,"Not in these comments, but more recent ones they told me. I'm not the one saying that only simps acknowledge female redditors, they said that."
GirlGamers,forgg8e,t1_forfbsb,1588011810.0,So I can't make jokes? People are literally telling me to go back to the kitchen and the only people who upvote anything to do with girls are simps
GirlGamers,forcae6,t3_g956uu,1588009798.0,"EDIT: I'm the girl btw, not the dude"
GirlGamers,forc0p7,t1_forbu2e,1588009670.0,I'm the girl commenting lol
pcmasterrace,for7g1o,t1_for6mqj,1588007461.0,"Not even saying anything sexist, all I said is that it's nice to see another woman. Not saying anything against the guys here, just saying that there needs to be more women. Don't be so sensitive.

EDIT: Also, it's not meaningless that she's a girl. It's great to have other women to relate to in tech, that's all I'm saying."

LofiHipHop,fncqj51,t3_g0lk4i,1586843980.0,"Lyrics are great, my only suggestions would be to use your chest voice to project more and to switch up the flow and emphasis on your words every once in a while.  Beat is fire tho, same for the lyrics. Keep it up!"
