ElectricSkateboarding,fpca5og,t3_gclt1b,1588492928.0,I own one. I like it but it broke on me my first month. Took 4 months to get the parts sent and replaced. Hoping it won’t break again
ucr,fp8oufe,t1_fp8ot01,1588398280.0,Nothing yet
ucr,fp8fkz9,t3_gbx0r4,1588391037.0,"Dang, I guess I didn’t get any? Says there’s no award information available :T"
ucr,fp8adbx,t1_fp8a8l6,1588387442.0, Nothing shows up there /: do all students get this?
ElectricSkateboarding,fo64t7b,t3_g5r4mi,1587546523.0,Damn man I feel. My OB went out after a month of use. Waited a little more than a month for them send me a new battery /:

guns,fnu4j6k,t1_fnu0y8z,1587254406.0,Oh that’d be cool! Might have to hold off on getting one then to see if the gen 2 is worth it then lol
guns,fnu4hkm,t1_fnu0ehp,1587254380.0,Thanks I’ll check them out!
PharmacySchool,fnrvl7n,t3_g3kiw1,1587203265.0,"Most schools want a bachelors which means doing 4 years undergrad but look at the prerequisites of each school. Typically the prerequisites take 4 years so minus as well to get a bachelors. Then go to pharmacy school for another 4 years.

 Prerequisites may be chemistry, calculus, English, political science, etc. most schools have similar prerequisites but just check each one just in case."
Frugal,fnqes4z,t3_g35y9z,1587163178.0,"My dads boss told me when I got my first job in high school to save 90% of your paycheck and the 10% is your spending money. Told me to forget that I even had that 90%. My senior year of high school, I was able to pay off a brand new car I got my sophomore year. Fast forward to undergrad, I graduated with no debt (living with parents with very little bills)."
apple,fnnv5z1,t1_fnnuopf,1587102707.0,"Oh I see, was that the “other department” that they told me I could try speaking to? I’ll see if I can find some time tomorrow at work to try giving Sales a call. Although I’m not worried about the $17 or the upgrade fees (frustrated but really trying to live 2020 with less stress lol), it’s just ridiculous how the staffs were not knowledgeable with these kinds of things. 

I worked retail from high school all the way til I finished my grad program and I get the things they deal with and the things customers expect them to know but I really feel like they just screwed up here /: 

Thanks for the info! If they can reimburse me or help out in anyway that would be awesome! If not, I’m just glad my post got approved here and let me vent out this frustration."
apple,fnnuf2g,t1_fnngjra,1587102044.0,"I thought I would be able to but turns out e-gift cards can’t be purchased with gift cards online. Probably if I go into the Apple store itself but with covid, all the stores are closed."
apple,fnnu9x0,t1_fnntt2c,1587101920.0,"I think if I would go to an Apple Store, it can be done but due to the pandemic right now, I don’t know when they’ll be opening up. I tried on the Apple store app and on a computer to see if I am able to but they don’t allow the purchase of iTunes gift card with Apple store gift card /:

Only reason I found out about the gift card was because I saw Lumafusion go on sale and figured I would only have to pay $3 with my gift card which is amazing for me lol but by the time Apple store opens, it’ll probably be at its original price"
apple,fnnu1go,t1_fnnqn5p,1587101715.0,"Okay I’ll give them a try, what else do I have to lose lol. Do you know if they have a feature where I can leave my number and they can call me when I’m next in line? I don’t know if I would be able to stand staying on hold for an hour again... Hopefully they’re able to do something about it because I felt I was nice when I called them today only to find out they can’t do anything /:"
apple,fnnf8ov,t1_fnne1qu,1587091001.0,"Yeah. I rarely go to Apple but when I did, I had some fairly good customer service but this really just shocked me. 

I don’t think there would be anything Apple Sales Support can do at this point? I already paid my carrier and I don’t know if I want to be on the phone for another 2 hours again for $17 lol"
ElectricSkateboarding,fnirtmr,t3_drdsrv,1586985249.0,"Any recommendations on cheaper boards I can put cloudwheels on? Looking to buy an extra board for the gf but I doubt she’ll use it a lot so I’m not trying to spend $700+ on one. 

Looking for one that ain’t going to break either after a few weeks like how my ownboard did lol was looking at the BKB but I don’t see many reviews on it."
ElectricSkateboarding,fnguzsi,t1_fngsswl,1586945968.0,What’s the fix?
ElectricSkateboarding,fnb66hb,t1_fn9p44s,1586809906.0,Yeah because I was under the 3 month warranty. Not sure about now if it breaks (knock on wood)
ElectricSkateboarding,fnb5vru,t1_fnap5wc,1586809758.0,"Not going to lie, when I was riding throughout campus or throughout my neighborhood, I was using the cloud wheels. Definitely a lot more smoother and stable at high speeds but for the longest time I was using the AT wheels because I got lazy switching the wheels. 

But think about it this way, you got a board that works and you don’t have to worry about it breaking and not knowing where to get the parts to fix it."
ElectricSkateboarding,fn99has,t1_fn99dzn,1586764245.0,Right handed but had my phone is in my right hand
ElectricSkateboarding,fn94v10,t1_fn9451h,1586759486.0,"Maybe others can share their opinion, but I think if you’re looking at spending $800+, you should make sure the company has great customer service."
ElectricSkateboarding,fn92ob8,t1_fn91kco,1586757414.0,"Oh dude I wouldn’t recommend this board in my opinion. It’s a good board now but all those issues I had to deal with and the crappy customer service is not worth the $1000 price tag. I’ve seen people on here have great experience but I’ve also seen a lot of people have a ton of issues so it’s a hit or miss which in my opinion, makes it not worth the price.

It’s the ownboard AT/GT. I have the cloud wheels which I use around the city and street but I like the AT wheels for off-roading like this because of the clearance.

Personally, if I had to do it again, I’d probably try out the backfire ranger. These Chinese boards are far from perfect but I’ve heard some good customer service stories with them. I never experienced it since I haven’t bought from them though."
ElectricSkateboarding,fn8q2uf,t1_fn8nxm9,1586747362.0,"After 2 or 3 weeks of getting the board, the remote wouldn’t connect. Replaced the remote. Then a few weeks later, the board wouldn’t turn on. They sent me a new battery, was told they had a bad batch. When I got the new battery, it was the wrong size. It was smaller and had less screws. When I finally got the right battery, the screw holes on the board didn’t align well with the holes on the board from the original battery. So I had to drill a few holes in and I filled the other holes. I noticed there were gaps and the battery wasn’t fully sealed so I added my own silicone and used electric tape all around to make it extra water resistant. Those were the most tedious headaches but I also had other issues like the motor wasn’t screwed tight enough so my belt fell off mid ride, some connections to the ESC was lose so I had to open it up and reconnect it, and other minor issues. I would just expect for $1000, there wouldn’t be this many issues. Also since this pandemic stuff, the shipping took forever so for awhile I couldn’t ride this board."

gundeals,fn2jo9q,t3_fvjrkr,1586591481.0,Any deals going on for the vortex uh-1 right now?
pharmacy,fmu3m4o,t1_fmttd7r,1586383945.0,"So this will be an odd question, but I’ve notice our pharmacy falls behind in pickup really because we have one tech who will only fill. I’ve mentioned it to my pharmacy manager before but she hasn’t done anything about it. Of course, I will go and do pick up to help what we’re lacking in but I feel it’s not the best use of my time as an intern? Am I just being arrogant that as an intern, I shouldn’t be spending most of my time at pick up or is there something I should do about it?"
pharmacy,fmu371w,t1_fmtkprr,1586383720.0,Do you have any recommendations to learning the metrics? I was tech at my pharmacy for 2 years but never has anyone gone over the metrics with me. I’ve gone on our portal to browse the metrics but I have no clue what any of them mean.
pharmacy,fmu30sy,t1_fmtduhg,1586383627.0,"I’m a P1 right now. Would you, as a pharmacist, let me help verify even though I’m only a p1? Also, what’s a good way to know the larger projects my company is working on? My pharmacy doesn’t really talk about any of the big projects the company is working on but focus more on the day to day operations."
pharmacy,fmu2oct,t1_fmsxrjf,1586383443.0,"Awesome! Thank you so much for your input! Should I ask if my pharmacist can teach me how to do immunizations or should I wait when we learn it in school? I’m very eager to do it (despite the current pandemic, we’re still getting flu shots) but I’m also unsure if it’s appropriate for my pharmacist to allow me before I go over it in school?"
pharmacy,fmu1li9,t1_fmspwug,1586382877.0,Oh okay cool thanks!! I’ll ask if I can start doing this!
pharmacy,fmrl7k7,t1_fmrjv2v,1586326651.0,"I do some consult on basic meds but definitely still learning as I’m not confident with the less common drugs. May I ask the general procedure for copies? I’ve been meaning to ask someone to teach me how to send and receive copies but my pharmacists have been really busy. 

Is it just as simple as giving our fax number and waiting to get it and vice versa?"
pharmacy,fmricug,t1_fmrhexo,1586324103.0,"Oh yeah without a doubt, I agree! To what I know of at least, all the techs love me because I’m more of a “oh we need someone at pickup, I’ll grab it” or pretty much the guy that just does whatever is needed at the pharmacy lol 

I’m in CA. I haven’t heard of any interns being canceled? I got more hours than usual actually this week because of everything going on"
pharmacy,fmri4px,t1_fmrgp1u,1586323904.0,Haha no worries. That’s what I’ve been doing. Still feel like a tech. I knew a few pharmacist who expected more than tech work from their interns but I never knew exactly what they expected so I figured I’d ask here
