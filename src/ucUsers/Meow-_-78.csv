The WHub just going into the space you feel welcome. It's a nice place to relax from the busy life of UCI, especially as a commuter this was great. They have testing materials like Scantron, booklets, etc. They have snacks for students. They have menstrual items like tampons and pads and safe sex items. Not to mention this is free for students to take. 

WHub also offer jobs opportunities for students and they have scholarship opportunities for people from different majors. That is just the tip of the iceberg they also host events for people to attend. 

Also everyone is welcome because this is a community resource, that is why benefit everyone to support the Whub."
