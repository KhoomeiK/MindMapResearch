They're centered around common majors/career goals and you might find them more fulfilling than IFC (strictly social, stereotypical) frats

also you can definitely party w/o joining a frat LOL"
UCSantaBarbara,fny9ief,t3_g4levp,1587356791.0,you should also try posting to Free & For Sale if possible!
UCSantaBarbara,fny8vmf,t3_g4lexn,1587356320.0,"my tutors send out emails about 1-2 times a week with worksheets/video links, so you can find your tutor's email on the CLAS website (Contact Us -> People) and email them to find out how they've structured things and previous materials they've sent out"
UCSantaBarbara,fnpebwz,t3_g25xmg,1587144013.0,"Anybody know why there's ""political"" parties? Seems a little extra considering basically every candidate has the same goals: improve CAPS, advocate to students, etc."
UCSantaBarbara,fnocny5,t1_fno8fka,1587120580.0,yeah bio advising told me that basically every bio class requires at least a C in its prereqs
UCSantaBarbara,fno1i4l,t1_fno1hik,1587108673.0,I learned this the hard way lol
UCSantaBarbara,fno1hik,t3_g1ug3c,1587108656.0,"C- to continue in the series (i.e. you need a C- in 109B to take 109C)

BUT if the class is a prereq for another class you need at least a C (ex: MCDB 108A requires you to have a C in the whole ochem series)"
UCSantaBarbara,fno18qd,t1_fnmerb7,1587108404.0,Do you know if MCDB and EEMB have sent out emails or put out some official info about their decision?  I've been looking forever and haven't found anything ://

UCSantaBarbara,fhzou4e,t3_f53t0b,1582005967.0,"Currently a 2nd year living in San Mig with my 2nd year roommate (we signed up together), and there's 5 other 2nd years just on my floor alone.  I lived in San Mig during my 1st year and had a 2nd year roommate then and I don't think she hated it.  From what I can tell from the past two years, San Mig is significantly less chaotic than the other res halls in Chi5 and has doubles available, so if you don't get/want Manzi or San Raf it's probably your next best option."
