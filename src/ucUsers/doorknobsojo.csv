UCSD,fo0j47a,t1_fo0ik8n,1587414060.0,bruh? that option has been available since week 2
UCSD,fnqonsk,t1_fnnjpub,1587168873.0,"If you can go to an in state school that costs less, than do that. For pre-med, it’s honestly reliant on your own work ethic and how open you are to pursuing opportunities."
UCSD,fnqojcc,t1_fno5x30,1587168796.0,"1. Muir is great. The way it’s designed makes it easy to socialize imo and the people are generally very friendly and outgoing so it’s easy to make friends and stuff. It’s near the middle of campus so there’s easy access to the rest of the school. It has a good dining hall compared to the rest. The reason people think it’s a “prison” is because the buildings are made of cement, but imo it’s really beautiful when the sun is setting. Plus even if the outside looks “meh,” the INSIDE is great! 
2. The beach is kind of across the street and you follow a specific path. You’ll find out more once you get here since it’s hard to explain over text It’s a little winding/elevated but it’s doable and a good workout. Trust, you’re closest you the beach in Muir and it’s honestly really accessible. 
4. Honestly if you don’t need a car then don’t bring it. Reasonable exceptions are things like off campus work or frequently needing to go home for personal reasons. But if you don’t have a circumstance like that then it’s not worth it."
UCSD,fnppumm,t3_g37zv3,1587149804.0,"you should look up some programs, some like ucsd som are allowing p/np and others aren’t. but tbh, i doubt you should take major reqs like bio and chem as p/np. writing courses are a maybe though"
UCSD,fnkmx1l,t3_g27b8j,1587033192.0,"If you’re a second year, consider that this is your last quarter to apply. Have you taken BILD1 and BILD3 or are you currently taking them?"
UCSD,fngxnv5,t1_fn3ylv1,1586948732.0,"honestly, i would advices 3 classes for your first quarter. BILD1 and Chem6a may be a lot of work/effort depending on your comfort with the material. Cat1 would be a good balance. I would personally wait to do 10b second quarter when it’s on sequence."

UCSD,fn2540t,t3_fyv2io,1586578097.0,we’ll note that there’s a limit on how many units you can replace a grade for so don’t fail multiple times if u can avoid it
AnimalCrossing,fmvetjq,t3_fvzvei,1586414531.0,How are people getting so much cool furniture? Or even just getting more furniture at all? This also applies to getting more DIYs... I would really want to know some tips so I could step up my island game lol. Any advice/tips appreciated :)
