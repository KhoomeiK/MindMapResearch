polls,fn5ef7r,t1_fn5dex5,1586662709.0,"But as I explained in my comment, there seems to be a bias within the WHO when coming up with names. Historically, they have not cares about location-names unless the virus originated from a powerful country.

In my comment, I mentioned a lot of ways how the WHO has been extremely biased to China. But they’ve also been biased towards America when it comes to naming diseases. Zika, Ebola, Hantan, MERS, and West Nile virus were all named after locations. SARS (China), Covid-19 (China), and Swine Flu (the US) were not. They have a bias when naming diseases in that they don’t care about locations until a powerful country is involved. No one ever said it was racist to name all those other diseases what they were named. 

So the questions are why should the WHO get to decide which diseases are named after locations and which are not if it might be biased to the countries that fund it the most, and is it not hypocritical for them and the media to call references to “Chinese virus” as stigmatizing or racist considering their lack of concern with other location-based disease names?"

polls,fn5cq29,t1_fn5cf2s,1586661470.0,"I agree. There is a lot of toxic racism these days. I think it’s best to be clear to separate the people of China from the government of China and make clear that the term should only be used to associate the region and the government with the virus, not the people."
polls,fn5cj2h,t1_fn5c8sa,1586661330.0,"TLDR; the WHO has no problem naming diseases after location names for pandemics that originate in other regions. But when it comes to China, they have shown a clear bias in this and in many other regards. Thus, I believe that calling it racist to refer to the virus as “the Chinese virus” only helps China’s propaganda campaign and their attempts to distance themselves from the issue. In reality, poor Chinese meat market regulations and their botched response to the pandemic was what made its spread so devastating not only within its borders but also in the rest of the world. 

I think it’s important that we call it the Chinese virus or the Wuhan virus to associate the virus with the Chinese government and to remind people that much of this is indeed their fault. At the very least, if WHO is willing to name diseases after regions for almost every other major pandemic, they shouldn’t give special treatment to China."
polls,fn5c8sa,t1_fn59q78,1586661127.0,"The problem with that is that the WHO is the one that decides what the names of viruses are, and there have been a lot of cases where they have been shown to be biased towards China.

For instance, in January, Chinese officials told the WHO with no evidence that the disease was not contagious, and the WHO ran with it despite the lack of evidence. When data came out showing that the disease was indeed contagious, they immediately changed their tune. 

Whenever the WHO has talked about China’s response to the virus, they have always praised its actions and ignored all of the flaws in China’s response such as the silencing of doctors who tried to speak out in the initial stages and their misinformation campaign ranging from claims that there was no evidence of human to human transmission and their claims that the US military intentionally brought the disease to China and spread it.

Additionally, when it came to covering the responses of various nations, the WHO was notably silent on Taiwan despite its successes in containing the virus. In fact, Taiwan isn’t a WHO member due to Chinese influence and fear of retaliation from China on the part of other countries. This means that not only is the WHO unwilling to praise Taiwan for the success it has had, it has also refused to give them information and resources for handling the crisis.

Furthermore, the second Trump announced travel restrictions on China, the WHO immediately came out and said that Trump was “stigmatizing” the issue and that what he did was wrong. However, multiple health experts have concluded that Trump’s travel restrictions did help flatten the curve. 

Finally, the WHO itself admitted that when naming the virus, they made an effort to not reference Wuhan or China. This is despite the fact that they had no issue naming Ebola after the Ebola River, Zika after the Zika virus, West Nile Virus after the Nile, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) after the Middle East, and Hantavirus after the Hantan River. Yet when it comes to diseases from China, like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory System) and the coronavirus, they refuse to make any reference to location.

It’s this hypocrisy and blatant corruption that pisses me off. The WHO and the media have no issue with location-based disease names for any other disease that exists. But when it comes to China, the WHO has shown time and time again that it acts in a biased way towards them and criticizes anyone that tries to associate diseases from China with location. What’s really going on is that the Chinese government has a lot of power over the UN and the WHO in that they are one of its biggest funders and the second most powerful country in the world. They also tend to get angry over anything that might damage the reputation of the CCP, hence all of the backlash from China whenever anything negative is posted about them and all of the international organizations condemning anyone who criticizes it. And despite all of this, the mainstream media never covers it. To find all of the information I did, I had to do a lot of digging online. Few mainstream sources had any stories about this."
polls,fn4tmg0,t1_fn4swhv,1586648705.0,I agree but I also know there are a lot of concerns with terms like this increasing racism. IMO it’s best to be clear that the term should not be used to attack Asians but should be used only to associate the government of China with the virus. I think the media is wrong to say using the term is racist regardless of context.

SandersForPresident,fn2nn7g,t3_fjo2iz,1586595884.0,"Biden is correct on this. Obama was correct. Trump is correct. Bernie was correct 3+ years ago when he railed against open borders and criticized illegal immigration frequently. The cold hard truth is that a large influx of low skilled workers lowers wages for lower income Americans the most because they drive up competition for the same types of labor. Bernie used this argument a lot if you look up speeches he gave in the past. 

Bernie pivoted on this (or at the very least, stopped criticizing illegal immigration) because radical leftists have shifted the party such that you pretty much have to be a proponent of illegal immigration in order to win the nomination.

politics,fmomjxn,t1_fmnhdvh,1586263485.0,"So much for the Supreme Court being non partisan. I always thought it was incredibly naive of the founding fathers to think that justices who were appointed by a majority in the Senate and served for life would be non partisan and impartial. I mean, if the founding fathers didn’t say it, most people would see through that bullshit. Politicians have an incentive to appoint not the people who will most closely follow the law and deliver fair judgement, but the people that are most likely to unconditionally side with their politics and interpret the law in ways that benefit those politicians. As long 

Ever since the denial of Merrick Garland’ seat, the courts have become incredibly partisan precisely because the country has become more partisan and Republicans want to appoint the people that will deliver them the best judgements.

I think a better system would be to require a small supermajority for the initial approval to the supreme court in order to ensure that the minority party in Congress has more power over who gets appointed. Then, judges should come before Congress every few years for reconfirmation hearings. This time, a larger supermajority would be required to fail to approve a judge and remove a judge from office. This way, it would be difficult for judges to be unconfirmed simply because the opposing party took control, and the reconfirmation hearings in Congress would keep them more accountable for their actions."

Idk if you guys know this, but the reason YouTube got sued and lost was because the courts said that YouTube’s attempts to market themselves as a kid friendly website was what made them have to comply with COPPA. Before they got sued, they got away with marketing themselves as a kid friendly website and enjoying all of the ad revenue that kid friendly channels gave them.

Now that they are forced to comply with COPPA and won’t ever get full ad revenue from kids again, why don’t they just fucking market the YouTube Kids app as where kids should go?! Just make it clear in your marketing that the main YouTube site is for 13+ and all children should use the Kids App at all times. Then, they might be able to return the main website to normal with no “made for kids” bullshit. Even if content that might seem like it’s made for younger audiences is posted to the main site, as long as they make it clear that the main site should not be used by children and make an effort to push all kids to the app, it shouldn’t matter and the courts would probably side with them."
polls,fmkmmap,t1_fmkh7tj,1586160318.0,"The reason it has risen only 2k since 2000 is because the Great Recession (and the dot com bust to a much lesser extent) made the numbers fall by a lot. Ignoring this and saying it has only risen 2k since 2000 is misleading af. 

It has risen 4k since 2012, and it rose by 1k in Trump’s first two years (the numbers reported are for the end of the given year, so 2018 and 2017 are both Trump’s). 

It seems that you’re the one who knows the issues with your arguments but refuses to admit it, considering you intentionally neglected the impact of the Great Recession and didn’t focus on the area of the graph showing that Obama’s final few years and Trump’s initial years were strong (which was what I originally claimed).

Finally, regarding CPI, it does take into account college fees and home prices. These do have higher than average inflation. But other goods and services have lower than average inflation rates. CPI is calculated based on what the average consumer buys and is weighted accordingly. So even though some items have higher than avg inflation rates, it’s accounted for in the CPI formula."
