I started off as a transfer and I always find it harder to meet people in class at Berkeley than back when I was in community college. Most of your points have been expanded in this thread's discussion so I am not going to talk more about it. 

But one suggestion I have that might help you improve this situation: meet people through social clubs instead of classes. This might sound irrelevant at first, but hear me out. I think people are more authentic when they are in social clubs. They tend to put their personality first, rather than academic abilities. Plus it's easier to make friends, and once you do, you can better judge whether you feel comfortable hanging out with these people. (perhaps this solves point C)

Plus, CS is one of the majors with the most students. I am sure you will find people in those clubs with similar classes. (hopefully) :p"
