AMA,fpfor28,t1_fpfod6u,1588578093.0,"Well the first incident was she brought me into her office and bullied me for an hour and a half straight.

I had just turned 16.

I will say I was proud of myself for not crying while I was in there and not giving her the satisfaction of making me cry, but once I walked out of there the tears were rolling. 

As far as the other incidents, such as the daily humiliation and how I was relentlessly dragged (tried to lower my grade, blocked me from getting an award, took away my solos the night before the performance, tried to get me suspended, told every single one of her classes I was arrested for theft and vandalism), I was a naive 16 year old girl, so yeah they really got to me.

The reason I openly accept these rules is because my parents support me. I don‚Äôt want to pay rent, so I follow their rules, and that should be the natural order of things.

Now I have friends whose parents try to have it both ways. Not only do they charge them rent, they also impose these same rules on them. It puts a lot of stress on their kids because they have the stress of adult responsibilities with none of the adult privileges.
