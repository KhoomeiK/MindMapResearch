I have been crushing on this guy for the part couple months and know for sure that it will not lead to anything (nor do I really want it to). The past two months in quarantine have been rough considering it is impossible to meet new people to take your mind off an old crush. I am currently in the process of trying to forget the feelings which is so hard. I don't get crushes very often, but when I do they definitely become intense. I wish I could I get over it more quickly and honestly the fact that I can't makes me angry at myself. Lately because of this I feel like such a creep for thinking about it so much. ITS SO DUMB. I just can't shake this ""you are such a creep for thinking about a guy"" feeling even though its not like I stalk him or anything weird. Does anyone else feel this way?"

arcadefire,fo9duc6,t3_g3i2gg,1587616821.0,I think its a great song! Honestly the argument about the lyrics not being complex enough is dumb to me. who said music has to always be lyric focused. Chemistry and peter pan are great songs for the beats alone

arcadefire,fo9dbxg,t3_g6apho,1587616448.0,"Took me a while to listen to this album, (really about 3 yrs lol) but now that I have, I absolutely love it.

First, I honestly don't see the point in ranking albums really, I think we should just let each other like what we like. The beats on this album are great, love the electronic/pumping nature of Put your money on me and electric blue.

love the weird hints of country in we don't deserve love and infinite\_content. To me, its a great album. its got good transitions as well.

we can all agree that arcade fire is! the! best band"
BodyAcceptance,fn9a4hi,t3_g09h5y,1586764954.0,"dear O.P, 

I want to give you my perspective from an academic point of view (coming from a liberal arts university) as well as a few of my own personal thoughts. 

There is a lot of solid research from anthropologists and scientists who study the human body that biological sex is not a binary of male/female, but a spectrum.

A lot of people have touched on this in their responses, but I really wanted to add to that and give you an anthropological take on the idea. 

We are taught from birth that you are either male or female each with come with specific characteristics that you must have. Anyone without those set characteristics are ""deformed"", or fall outside the determined ""norm"". The truth is so much more complex. 

For your particular case, you are a female with what you describe as masculine features. You don't feel like you fall into the category box of a girl. That would make sense if you have been taught your whole like that females are supposed to be x,y,z. This sucks because you now feel like you are deformed. You don't fit the box, so you can't be normal. 

But let's stop there and think of it in a different light. If sex was a spectrum, no one falls in a box, everyone falls on the spectrum. You are not deformed, who you are is perfectly natural and possible in the billions of humans that make up our species.

Compare this model to how we imagine skin color or sexuality. There is no wrong place to be on the spectrum. If we think about skin color for a second we know that the world is not black or white (literally!) we exist in the shades in between!!! For sex, it may seem like everyone is on one of the two sides but I assure you that so many people out there who don't fall into our culture's defined standards. 

People struggle with not fitting in only because of the cultural ideas that we are taught. The boxes we hold onto so tightly do not actually exist.

Learning to accept yourself will be a challenge because you must rewire the things you've been taught about gender and sex your whole life. Doing research helps! Learn for yourself about all the scientific studies and papers on the topic and empower yourself with knowledge (there is an entire anthropology class for this at my school!).

However, here is the thing, learning to love and accept yourself is a deep and personal process. I promise you that ""normal"" is not something you need to worry about. Honestly fuck the word altogether! Its a difficult process to stop comparing yourself to others, but I suggest seeking therapy (something I think we all need in our lives) and finding people in your life who you can talk to safely. 

best,

a internet friend.

p.s 

in the meanwhile hold onto the things your love! do activities that you enjoy and feel the best at, Whenever I'm wrapped up in my self hate doing something fun or distracting helps a lot! enforce your worth in those little moments. learning to love ya self takes time."
