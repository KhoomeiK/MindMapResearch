But since I can read Chinese, I will provide an example on how some news popping up in this sub is intentionally manipulating the content they cover to mislead you.

Previously there were reports saying that the game Animal Crossing is banned in China cuz Hong Konger are sharing pro-Hong Kong art pieces in it. That really wasn’t the main reason at all and the game is not banned in China at all. 

China has its own ESPR rating system that developers need to apply to get their games officially published in China. Since Nintendo never bothers applying for the permit the game cannot be officially sold in China (which is the same in the states because you can’t sell video game that has no rating I believe) so all the hard copies of AC are being taken down from their e-commercial websites and streamer can’t stream it because that would just be piracy. If you go to the Chinese equivalent of YouTube you can still see millions of video of the game by content creators. The game is still viral on their internet.

So yes, hard copies of Animal Crossing are being taken down in China, and Hong Konger are posting pro-democracy are pieces on it, but are these two things really have a causal relationship? I doubt it.

A lot of these China hate circlejerking articles are actually come from some companies that are directly funded by intelligence agencies and think tanks here in the US. I got links if you’re interested."

berkeley,fo44vb2,t1_fo415x1,1587498231.0,"I can’t say for eecs classes, but I have helped with upper div math class to come up with weekly quizzes or homework that’s about 4-6 questions, and it’s not that hard at all. 

Just like NP-complete problems reduce to each other, many problem are testing the same essence with different way of presenting and that can be conveniently changed like the reduction problems in 170. 

When I took 70, 170 and 126, all the problems are like some kind of mini novels or mini stories, and I believe this part may be hard to come up with every semester, but I really don’t see any point doing this. My 188, 106 series and some others are all just like test your mastery of the concept directly with a few sentences.

Which is better for educational purposes? Reuse wordy problem for several years that every one can easily find solutions online vs. some simple-wording problem that you absolutely have to rely on yourself to finish(or you have to understand it well enough to associate it with some other problems that you can find solutions online)? Personally I prefer the latter.

Or you can just use problems from some textbooks that have no official solution manual online. I found my 126 borrowed questions from some stochastic process book and it worked out great

And lastly, I really don’t think you need to worry about stackoverflow and chegg that much. Many problems don’t get answered in a limited timeframe of a week (many problems on math stackexchange get answers years later), and sometimes answers on chegg are completely bullshit (from my experience in a differential geometry class). It’s like: questions definitely with solutions online vs. questions that may get posted on chegg and have a correct answer (I would say the probability that this happens is significant lower than 1)."
berkeley,fo28jdo,t3_g51182,1587453189.0,"To be frankly, I think a better way to stop cheating in these problem set classes is just giving problem sets that have no official answer floating online (a lot of upper div math classes that I have taken before assign problems from books that have no official solution manual and you can’t find solutions online at all for most of the problems because the questions are so specific. If those upper div math classes can do it with just 1 professor, 1 reader, no gsi, 20ish students, I see no reason a eecs classes can’t do that with support from a supposedly much more resourceful department behind its back)

Or better, come up with new problem set every semester. 

I know both are more time-consuming than just catching a bunch of cheaters at the end of the semester, punish them (and sorta ruin their academic prospects to some extend) and call it a day, but for a university I believe the purpose is to educate people, not try to filter and catch all the potential cheaters.

But the grading for 106B is easy, as long as you make through the semester you get at least B+ I think, just a lot including graduate students would drop before they even get to finish lab1. 


If you take grading into consideration then 126 is the hardest in my opinion, and the support for the classes isn’t that great tbh. When I took it there is no lecture recording, which only makes thing more difficult.

I think a better example would be you won’t yell “trump bad” every time you see a random American on the street because obviously not every American supports Trump. Unless you can provide some quantitive evidence showing that there are more percentage of Chinese citizens adamantly involve in and support animal cruelty than that of those who voted for Trump. (Change Trump to dem/Bernie or whatever you like if u r conservative and my point is the same).
Or rather, will you make pedo joke to him every time you see a priest or a catholic person?"

aww,fmpdm77,t1_fmpcc26,1586278951.0,"The Japanese language borrowed parts of the writing system along with many traditional and classical words from the Chinese language during the ancient times. 

But then later during the late 19th century and early 20th, because Japan was way more modernized and open to the west, Chinese scholars and intellectuals back then borrowed a lot of Japanese words and translation back to Chinese, and some of them are the very essential words (like the word for “traffic”/“transportation” in Chinese is actually from Japanese)

Tho I am no expert on this so it may be more complicated than what I just said."

aww,fmoc1xk,t1_fmo7ih5,1586253346.0,"狸猫 is actually referring to a different animal,  and I think it’s called raccoon dog in English. I don’t study zoology so I don’t know how related they are but a lot of people couldn‘t tell the difference. The word for raccoon is “浣熊”in which “浣” is a sorta obsolete way to say wash."

The thing is, you wouldn’t grab a German dude’s arm and yell “Nazi Bad!” at them when you find a random German dude on the street right? That’s just not how it works."
aww,fmobefq,t1_fmo4z11,1586252632.0,"It’s kinda like English and French. A lot of adjectives, nouns and verbs are deeply related but not exactly the same. Grammars and other stuff are very different from each other."
aww,fmo0jyj,t1_fmo02g1,1586241064.0,I have been learning Japanese for a few years and I found a lot of words/kanji used in Japanese daily language are words that are considered classical and not common in Chinese. For example 泣、寝 are two pretty common kanji in Japanese but you would pretty much see them only in classical Chinese literary works if used as verb (it’s more common as noun but still considered very formal). That’s why I really like leaning Japanese cuz as a native Chinese speaker I found it pretty classy and somehow poetic lol
