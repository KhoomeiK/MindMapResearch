RationalPsychonaut,foqpc4t,t3_g8n5y5,1587998341.0,"I'm far from an expert so take this with a grain of salt, but from personal experience, this sounds like what may be mild schizophrenia, or at least some kind of anxiety disorder.
Schizophrenia is characterized by feelings of the world being against the individual as you stated. Other things to watch out for are perseveration on the past, seeing patterns and signs where there are none, and feelings of grandiosity.
Regardless of the diagnosis, it seems your friend needs professional help. If they have insurance, there are fully online programs, or also regular programs that offer tele-therapy.
Best wishes to you and your friend, I understand the pain of seeing someone close go through this."
