UCSantaBarbara,foz8a5o,t3_gad7tb,1588186343.0,"I think sororities/fraternities definitely care about looks but as others have said there are other aspects to social life at UCSB besides Greek life. I joined a debate club and my whole entire friend group is that debate club. There's a diverse group of skinny people average people, different race people etc. 

You will find your niche here as long as you are kind and genuine and whatnot."

UCSantaBarbara,forqfo9,t3_g979up,1588016687.0,"I would say it is both academically rigorous but also party-rigorous. The two are not mutually exclusive. 

Many of the smartest, most academically-driven people I know party very often but also get straight As in difficult classes."
UCSantaBarbara,foly1by,t3_g86nuw,1587873239.0,idiots smh
UCSantaBarbara,folwoes,t3_g879dq,1587872286.0,"I've done a similarly crazy schedule one summer (Physics 6A/6AL/6B/6BL, Math 34B, Psy 10A/10B, and an upper div English) over both Sessions A & B. 

I would say only do it if you are not doing anything else. Studying for those classes ate up basically all of my time."
UCSantaBarbara,fobqhf9,t3_g6i7q9,1587662555.0,Very very early in the pandemic I was at a store and a cashier asked if I was from China and if I had the coronavirus but I think that's more ignorance rather than violent hate crime
UCSantaBarbara,fnijr4l,t3_g1ug3c,1586981197.0,I believe you need at least a C to move on in the series.
UCSantaBarbara,fnebx8q,t3_g19gbh,1586886616.0,Labs should definitely be worth more units imo... ochem lab was 4 hours twice a week smh
UCSantaBarbara,fn73er2,t3_fzekqg,1586712526.0,boof reese is a savage...
UCSantaBarbara,fn11sla,t3_fylmq2,1586553083.0,So so gorgeous :(
UCSantaBarbara,fn0jhpz,t3_fya9h8,1586543079.0,"Hey I have been exactly where you are! I feel like not quite finding your niche and exploring different friend groups is really normal during college. I didn't find my niche until late into my 3rd year and now my 4th year after I joined this club called Model UN. I met a bunch of wacky dorky poli sci debate kids and we got to travel and compete at a bunch of conferences and basically become a family together.

You will find your people. Just keep putting yourself out there and going to random social events, club meetings, parties, school events. You probs won't click with people at first, or even for the next 4 or 5 social events but I promise you you will find your friend group!"
UCSantaBarbara,fmtr1eq,t1_fmt3aa9,1586377517.0,"oh no he must be really stressed out :/ 

hes also not super tech-savvy hopefully he will figure this out soon"
UCSantaBarbara,fmt28t0,t1_fmszqo9,1586365699.0,I don't think so he typically isn't this sassy/long-winded..
UCSantaBarbara,fmt15ea,t3_fx9ax5,1586365196.0,It should definitely have been inputted into GOLD at this point... call L&S and the FMS department. They are probably a bit behind on processing the paperwork because of the whole coronavirus thing but if you need your major to get early pass times for your classes it needs to get done ASAP.
UCSantaBarbara,fmnzqrs,t3_fwee0y,1586240297.0,"I took the class a long long long time ago with Yaqub (Is he even teaching it this quarter? Whatever anyway..) and got an A. 

I did 30-40% of the readings? They helped solidify the concepts for section and also helped with the essays. But for the tests I think I mainly studied the lectures. For Yaqub the tests were mainly IDing terms and short answer questions. 

Hope this helped!"
UCSantaBarbara,fmj6abk,t3_fvl58a,1586123895.0,I had Aue for all of ochem last year and he's a really old-school style professor that's used to drawing on the chalkboards and verbally explaining everything. I'm sure having to shift everything to Zoom is a completely new transition for him. Just be patient with him he will probs have it figured out asap.
