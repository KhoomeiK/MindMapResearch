books,fnsib5p,t3_g3nk8p,1587222206.0,">So around high school, I stopped reading for fun.

completely the same boat here, but I managed to get back into it start of this year. i think the thing is you just have to know what you like. your tastes have almost definitely changed since the start of high school, so you need to explore and find out what interests you now. for example i found out that i enjoy novels with a more existential-type theme. i stayed up till 4 to finish *out* by natsuo kirino and i'm still thinkin bout it months later.

i agree with the advice from another commenter, just pick up short books that are acclaimed or someone recommended to you. you really just need to find one good one, and then you can branch out from there. for example, *colorless tsukuru tazaki* by haruki murakami is short (386 pgs, but massive text) and has a premise that grabs you from the first page, so that's an example to try out. you'll manage to get back into books, for sure."

autechre,fml0jsh,t1_fmkylpj,1586175231.0,"see i thought haida was real and disappeared because tsukuru was just completely ignorant to haida's feelings. haida is literally coming over to tsukuru's house regularly, talking for hours, leaving his stuff over, cooking dinner for him, eventually staying the night on the weekends, and then they share that night which tsukuru thinks was a dream. then he wakes up the next morning and *still* treats haida like a friend? i don't blame haida for just abandoning tsukuru entirely lol the man is completely oblivious. i like these lines from an analysis i read after finishing the book:

&#x200B;

>In the end, Haida leaves a coffee mill and his prized LPs behind. I imagine he can’t listen to them anymore. Unlike Tsukuru, who continues to listen to *Le Mal du Pays* and think of Shiro years later, Haida chose freedom, something it takes Tsukuru the entire novel to learn to do.

>Ultimately, Haida cut off Tsukuru like a sixth finger. I hope he found someone who treasures him, as Kuro’s husband loves her. Or maybe Sara will reject Tsukuru and he’ll make the long-overdue trip to Akita."

### Breaking out of a music discourse spelled out on the “oblivion battery”?

By the way, reading ""Extra 2"" gave me a shock. Three baseball boys are talking in a corner of a school classroom. … If you take a closer look, only Glasses-kun , an intellectual [infielder](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/keyword/%C6%E2%CC%EE%BC%EA), is diving into a mysterious narrative.

How do you say ""everyone"" or ""you know""? Well, for me, I'm still more aware of the musicians who often go on TV or talk about the internet.

However, I actually listened only to Autechre's ""Amber"", and when I looked up it was a very old 1994 album. That was chilled-out, so it was good before going to bed, but after that, Autechre went in an industrial-like direction.

However, since I was shocked by this comic, I listened to the ""elseq"" series and tried to get back into Autechre. I do not think it is bad, but it is a bit too much, it is just a flat & natural feeling, weakness that can not aim for the height beyond the others, if you blame it, this 5 hours and 4 minutes of endless boops I would like to ask you after immersing yourself in the following worldview and enjoying it many times.

When I checked again, the correct title of the topical song ""latencall"" seems to be ""latentcall"", which means that ""t"" does not appear in the description of ""oblivion battery"". Anyway, it seems like it's a word that doesn't appear in the dictionary, so half of it seems like it can't be helped, but the reader who noticed that might be the only one himself ... and here I feel mysterious loneliness was.

By the way, what J-POP do you like?"
autechre,fmkoxht,t3_fvnoc9,1586162878.0,"LP5 is probably the last oasis of melody you’ll find between stuff like chiastic slide and confield. melody shows up later in stuff like quaristice and oversteps, but it’s less grounded and far more experimental. ‘arch carrier’ off LP5 is probably the closest they’ve come to pop lol."
ChineseLanguage,fmex380,t1_fmebbz9,1586015404.0,huh i just noticed that i do this! are there any other distinct southern characteristics? i noticed that i pronounce my ch/sh/zh closer to c/s/z which is supposedly a southern thing
