When I took CSE13E with Dunne, he went over the C fundamentals fairly well. If you have prior programming experience then you should be fine (up until you start working with the hardware as that’s entirely something else). If you really want a head start then I’d say try learning the language and implementing fundamental concepts such as user input, making functions, loops, etc. If you find all those things easy then try learning about structs, which in higher level languages is like a class. If you’re taking 13S then I’m sorry, I don’t know anything about it, hope this helps."

UCSC,fon9jyg,t3_g88orq,1587915132.0,I’m not sure about who your internet providers are but spectrum was offering a free 2 months of service. That’s what I’m currently using for internet. I’m not sure if they’re still offering it or not
AniviaMains,fob60fo,t1_fob277r,1587656476.0,I think he just means anivia botlane.... at least I hope that’s what he meant

summonerschool,fltb1ko,t3_fr0ud6,1585465462.0,"My friend that got me into league was like this too. When I first started playing, of course I didn’t know how to play at a high level (he was already high silver, later finished gold). He tried teaching me how to play but constantly would just flame me instead providing no constructive feedback and just constantly flaming me. After everything, I just decided that I wouldn’t play league with him until I personally got better. It took about 2 years but I got to the same level of play he was (mid gold - plat) and it even got to the point where he asked me to duo with him because he was struggling with his promos. 

Learn the game at your own pace. Master 1 or 2 champions, use them to learn the game THEN learn other champs/roles. Find people of your same skill level, climb with them, if you outgrow their ability, find someone new and repeat. 

Don’t let your friend ruin the game for you. You can also just play norms with him and your friends if you like playing with him. I’m gold 2 and I play with my friends that are iron, bronze, silver, and plat. At the end of the day, league is a game. It’s meant for you to have fun. If you aren’t having fun because you’re bad or your friend flames you, don’t play with them until you get good enough that they can’t blame you for whatever. I hope you figure out what you wanna do :)"
