TrumpCriticizesTrump,fpe4gnt,t1_fpdxkne,1588540156.0,"By no means am I commending overall behavior, but knocking someone when they're being productive just for the sake of it is ridiculous and shows that you stand for nothing but standing against him."
TrumpCriticizesTrump,fpdqth7,t3_gcos1p,1588532371.0,"This is a prime example of people being against Trump for the sake of being against him. You really think we shouldn't have good relations with the nations of the world? Congratulations, this is an issue in which you are *further right* than Donald Trump. Good relations with other nations doesn't mean you can't be critical of them and doesn't equate to outright support of what they're doing. As they continue to develop dangerous weapons and the world gets more and more volatile, maybe not having so many enemies is a good thing."

videos,fowcu7b,t3_g9om3w,1588117309.0,"The coding and creation of this device is really quite impressive, but this invention is nowhere near new nor original. This is basically a standard 3 axis CNC machine with some incredibly neat VR mechanics and a knife strapped to it. Likely that's part of the joke, but he keeps going back to the DaVinci surgery robot and calls his machine a surgery robot. Very fascinating though!"
