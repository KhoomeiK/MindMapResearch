While suicide isn’t always a clear outcome of depression, it’s far more likely to happen while depressed, bipolar, or schizophrenic. Please research these things before you comment insensitive shit"

getting_over_it,fp7aosq,t3_gbk7ca,1588367090.0,"Completely honest here, I genuinely believe loneliness is the natural state of being. Sounds super edgy but I’m an extrovert and spent my life stocking close to and finding people to spend my time with and at one point would’ve “rather died than be lonely” but at the end of every encounter we all end up alone. 
Other people can take distract the lonely but being alone is a natural state and being able to function as your own person while being in this state is absolutely crucial. I’m sorry those things happened to you but my best advice is to not give a shit about it- much much easier said than done but if somethings happened and you can’t change it why worry about it. I don’t believe in fate when it comes to things I can change but if it’s something I can’t change, I attribute it to fate as a coping mechanism. Shit happens and shit scars you but I’m not fucking letting it ruin the life I’ve had to fight for. 
Most importantly, you deserve to be happy. Everyone deserves to be happy. Humans are innately flawed and gross creatures but that doesn’t mean we don’t deserve to be happy. There’s really no point to life if we’re not, and life is too fucking short being held down by the past. Idk this might feel empty but you just have to stop giving a shit about stuff because life ducking sucks and it’s not fair but we just gotta keep trying"

Honestly what’ll help you heal the most is time and new experiences, however there’s a few things you should keep in mind 

-everyone is innately selfish and has their own benefit in mind. Never forget this and never assume people will put you first. 
-just because everyone is innately selfish doesn’t mean that they can’t be good. This seems contradictory but you can still find good and fun people despite eveyrone looking out for themselves. 

Good luck friend haha"

manhwa,fmt4lho,t3_fx7yqc,1586366778.0,"Personally, I don’t like it. The concept is good but the execution is awful- the whole idea of the system is crafted super badly and the main protagonist doesn’t do any actual outwitting and just relies on stuff she can buy from “the system”. It’s another boring revenge fantasy plotline except not done well"
aww,fmnfarf,t1_fmn8s3e,1586224752.0,Tbh i have no idea. Maybe it’s our developed morals? Like if we saw a baby animal we feel a moral obligation to help it live but a cat doesn’t have the same societal expectations to take care of it or a moral background to not let it die.
aww,fmnez9p,t1_fmnanke,1586224547.0,"What are you role playing right now. The Domestic cat was bred to do literally one thing, and that is to catch and kill rodents. (unlike dogs which have been bred to do numerous things from hunting to emotional support) you think that centuries of domestication is gonna devolve without any further domestication and just randomly obtain a high “protection and low prey drive?”"
aww,fmn62ua,t1_fmmrh2k,1586218973.0,"This isn’t true. There’s a certain frame for certain mammals to extend that protective instinct. If a mother cat has just given birth, theres a certain timeframe that she will extend that protection but normally she’d just eat a baby bird or possum."
