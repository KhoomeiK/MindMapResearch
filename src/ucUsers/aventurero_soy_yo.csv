GardenWild,fnwrdvg,t1_fnwe6xx,1587323950.0,"I'll post more pics soon but also don't want to flood the sub. Regular terra cotta is permeable so not really the best option. The glaze keeps the water in. I would say in general, the deeper the better because it keeps the water temp stable and cooler if the air temp gets warm. I just use standard water conditioner from the pet store for the fish, mosquito fish, and a mix of pond plants from the pond store. I don't put in a substrate other than a layer of clean rocks because the hope is that eventually the dead plant matter and fish poop will form their own substrate. All in all, you want a fairly self sustaining system. Message me if you need any help."
GardenWild,fnw1vpr,t1_fnvp95e,1587309735.0,"It's pretty basic! I've made a couple of them. All you need is a container that is water tight and large enough so that the temperature of the water doesn't dramatically fluctuate. You can also just adjust the sun/shade ratio to help this. This one is glazed ceramic but I've used plastic in the past. You just need to fill it up with water, give it a water conditioning treatment like you would for any pond/aquarium to neutralize chlorine etc., get some pond plants and some mosquito fish! That's pretty much it! Feel free to message me if you want more info or pics!"
