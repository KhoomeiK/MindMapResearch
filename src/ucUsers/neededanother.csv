UCSantaBarbara,fple1g9,t1_fpkxcry,1588711041.0,"Yea I pretty much agree with what you're saying. You just said that you didn't go to house parties when what you seem to be implying now is that you didn't get drunk on DP and walk into strangers houses. Pretty big difference. Especially when going to party on State street is basically the same as DP but you have to pay more for drinks and it is a slightly older crowd. (Ok there is also a bit more security and consistency). As a girl that is probably a lot easier to get in and more dangerous in some respects and less dangerous in other respects (no one is going to try to fight you for crashing their party but they might try to take advantage of you if you pass out on their couch). Of course there are plenty of backyard parties with DJs that most anyone can walk into.

Sounds like you pretty much knew all this, it's nice reminiscing about going outside and being in college commenting with you though lol"

UCSantaBarbara,fphmpso,t1_fpgwvcb,1588624003.0,"Yea it is certainly safer to stay in your house all day :/

Some quick safety tips to anyone who wants to check it out:
Don't get too drunk. (This means different things to different people, but stick to one or two drinks, when you start feeling great or when you think you need another drink to keep the party going is when you should probably stop drinking.)

Go out with friends, stay with your friends.

Go early and leave early. Leave before 11PM. Or better yet go to day parties.

If you see police barricades that means that the event or party probably got out of hand before so you shouldn't get involved unless you know what you're doing.

If something feels strange, or someone is giving you bad vibes just leave, there is always another party."

I didn’t see anything in that article to show that he sold stock and then talked about not buying a specific set of stocks and then going back to buy them.

Again, let's see a source on that. Just looking at the order of battle on wiki and saying that the numbers on the sidebar are representative of the war and especially the ""most intense periods"" is wrong.

The biggest issue with what you are saying remains that the Chinese were in fact using numerical advantage and putting their men into battle with little regard for their lives. Chinese commanders were begging Beijing for basic supplies like food and ammunition.

Edit: I can't respond do to post locked, but it seems the commenter is trying to straw man me, and use wiki as a source when I said that was going to produce the wrong results. So he goes ahead and uses that as his source... ok pal... LMFAO

Then he goes on some other jaunt about previous wars 500 years prior. Get to the facts, oh you didn't present any cool. Oh to top it off he ends with Chinese..with..inferior numbers."" grand..."

Also you make it sound like US forces were barely able to cross the 38th when they actually made it all the way to China. The US leadership made a lot of tactical errors, the biggest of which was believing they were superior to the Chinese in every way. The Chinese did throw their forces into battle with overwhelming numerical superiority as their main asset. They did use tactics, but to say that the Chinese were using their countrymen in the most efficient manner and with the same regard to life as the US forces is completely wrong."

If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%,"" Fauci and colleagues write.

Besides the numerous errors in what you said, you've tried to make false equivalencies and otherwise be obtuse. I'm not really interested in getting into it anymore with you. If you want to have a conversation feel free to go back to some of my previous comments and reply there."

The movie seems to be full of scenes like that which you basically need to know SF history from at least WW 2 on, I'd be really curious to see if any SF historians have done a review. I probably went in with too much emphasis on the title and setting though."

If he was smart he could easily turn this against them, because as you say it is Halloween."
wholesomeSF,fnwzw0w,t1_fnwvyjz,1587328736.0,I'm curious how people's level of SF history knowledge affects their view on the movie. Do you mind sharing your personal level and what you liked about the movie?
