90DayFiance,fomjrut,t1_fom64pe,1587892649.0,"Yes it‚Äôs strange how it seems that many people on this sub praise women for commodifying their bodies but demonize the men who buy into it. It‚Äôs all creepy, exploitive and fake. Rose is clearly repulsed by this man (who could blame her he‚Äôs gross) but is still playing along for the money. It‚Äôs all relative whose motives are more morally corrupt."
90DayFiance,fomfhog,t3_g7wpcv,1587888122.0,She looks like some kind of Star Wars creature every time she puts this on

Embroidery,fntkl51,t3_g380gi,1587243531.0,Great idea to use felt! Gives it a nice textural element. When the craft stores open again I will definitely get some cool squares
pics,fnrocol,t1_fnrlvky,1587195608.0,Yes I search so I can downvote.
UCSC,fnhrep9,t3_g1mug6,1586967534.0,9/10 times in breakout rooms/sections everyone has their mic and camera off so yeah going real well
houseplants,fnfiizq,t3_g1457v,1586908711.0,I can see the ‚Äúfor women‚Äù section turning into this and I‚Äôm not mad about it
Embroidery,fnaic3j,t3_g0kib8,1586798010.0,Love it! French knots for llamas are the cutest thing!
pics,fn0yfy2,t1_fn0lpv1,1586551200.0,"True. I just think that if you have them to spare you should donate them to hospitals, clinics, and the like so that people who are guaranteed to be exposed will have the extra protection. Of course this is assuming that most of the young healthy looking people I mostly see wearing them don‚Äôt have underlying conditions."
pics,fn0eav5,t3_fyfus8,1586540358.0,When I see people just wear N-95s to the grocery store it makes my blood boil. To think that health care workers can‚Äôt even get them. But this fucking picture has me floored. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal first hand with this kind of dumbfuckery. I would give myself an ulcer having to deal with the levels of entitlement and obliviousness seen at grocery stores these days. Hope you stay healthy and that the next pandemic targets dickheadedness
Botchedsurgeries,fmrnyer,t3_fx0j34,1586329234.0,Agreed. I personally don‚Äôt like the look of obvious fillers but most posts here take any sort of enhancements to mean botched. This sub is way past being educational. Not gonna lie though I did come here for the horror shows.
WTF,fmd0mjh,t1_fmcgtub,1585956721.0,He‚Äôs not even doing that lol
