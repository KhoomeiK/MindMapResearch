= INT \[0,1\] 0.5 \* x^(2) y dy, x \[0,1\]

Incidentally, that's why so many of these women love dogs so much; the immediate, consistent fulfillment of her whims, without any thoughts or demands of their own.  


In reality, being emotionally intelligent is knowing when your emotions may be misleading you. You see, if you could just do what FELT right every time and turn out ok, then the world would be a super happy, easy place. We could eat what we FELT like eating, without getting fat. We could do whatever we FELT like doing all day, without the concern of paying bills or getting exercise.
