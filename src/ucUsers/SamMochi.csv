The irony is that I am receiving more money, thanks to the additional $600, from the unemployment benefit than I used to make weekly. For me, this sounds too good to be true. Will I have to pay this difference back later, for example, in the form of tax?"

amazon,foi7ysf,t3_g4qu1l,1587780609.0,"Learned my lesson today: never buy something from a third party at Amazon. They provide excellent service for product sold by Amazon, but basically don't care about products from third parties. I bought masks from a third party seller yet never received them though the order status says delivered. It turns out that third party was a scam. The same masks are now being sold by a seller with different name. It's probably the same seller behind it that laundered their name because of very negative reviews (seller rate of 20%). 
Anyway my point is you don't want to buy from unproven third party sellers (I would avoid any third party sellers tho)."
