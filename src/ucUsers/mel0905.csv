ucr,fp8pho1,t1_fp8ofzi,1588398828.0,Bro the fact that I actually took a moment to briefly research and try to find sites to help you understand something I thought you had a genuine question about lol. Had I known you were just asking just to be a douche I wouldn’t have wasted my time. Reddit is not where to educate you for free. Do your own research about what Daca is pls
ucr,fp8p7zl,t1_fp8oe0j,1588398599.0,"I don’t think you read my comment. She’s a Daca student who works. Daca students have permits that have to be renewed every so often, I’m not sure how exactly the process works but I know there is a process."
ucr,fp8omgl,t1_fp8hzzj,1588398092.0,Im not 100% sure why or how but people mentioned that DeVos had blocked that emergency fund from being given to Daca students
ucr,fp8loz7,t1_fp8kcyg,1588395659.0,"I think that they addressed that in their post, I mean atleast to some extent no? The post says that they understand people are struggling differently and that they know people didn’t mean harm. I completely understand where you are coming from but I don’t think their intention was ill either."
ucr,fp8cmxl,t3_gbyhk3,1588388983.0,"I wish more people thought like this. My friend who is a dreamer isn’t getting anything and I’m giving her my portion of the grant because she lost her job and needs it more than I do. I’m still working  and while I’m thankful for the grant, I can’t help being a little upset that Daca students aren’t getting the grant because they need the help as well."
ucr,fp0bdbg,t1_fp0au6u,1588206012.0,"It’s really specific to you tbh. I got asked to talk about my major, why I chose my major, how Spanish plays a part in my life and whether or not I think It’ll be useful to my major. The questions are just small talk questions that guide a normal conversation. It wasn’t a right or wrong answer, it was more like “Just talk to me about anything but do it properly and in Spanish”. For example She asked me about what work I had done posc  related and I told her about my internship at a law firm, but I didn’t know how to say internship in English so I asked her for the proper way to translate it and she did!"
ucr,fp046aa,t3_gaiqev,1588202153.0,I took the test last week and was placed into Spanish 109. Since that placed me out of the ge requirement they had us do an interview which is for the day after exam. Basically I had to do was answer questions about myself and then she asked me to elaborate on my major but it’s just basically a having a fluent/ regular conversation to prove of Spanish that you placed into. It lasted like 10 minutes and I got to keep my same placement for 109
ucr,fouzm6e,t3_g9q9q3,1588092980.0,What the subject line for this email. I didn’t see anything in my email and I’m not sure if I should be worried :(
ucr,fo3s1f6,t3_g56pwb,1587492004.0,Try houses in Reddington! A lot of students just moved out :)
BDSMAdvice,fi2vy71,t1_fi2u6ax,1582090820.0,"The more people reply to my question, the more I start to think that maybe I’m asking the wrong person. It’s just a little scary to open myself up and be thang vulnerable with a stranger. Like sure this guy is a dick, but Atleast I know I’m not going to get kidnapped or stalked. Dating is hard for someone like me because people can be really obsessive/ catfish/ come with ill intentions. And that’s just regular dating lmao. I’m just terrified of the risks I’d be putting myself in to find a possible Dom. 

I did a quick google search but for some reason the only thing that popped up was ads for sex therapists lmao. Is there something I should google that will help get me the results I’m looking for?"
