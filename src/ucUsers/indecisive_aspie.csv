It's difficult to tell the context of the first and third one, as another comment has mentioned. I'm not sure if the BET comment is even anti-black, seems like he's just saying that he feels their programming comes off as patronizing."
nba,fomiwa5,t3_g7uc9f,1587891696.0,"Melo, Klay, or Dame would probably be a common answer. PJ Tucker, DeRozan, and Ibaka aren't far behind either. I love Steph for his willingness to embrace his goober side, but overall perception of him has been impacted to an extent by colorism within league circles and basketball fandom."
hiphopheads,fomd7ku,t3_g7wypx,1587885837.0,"I didn't start going to shows until a few years ago, so my sample size isn't huge. I would say the worst was Joji when he played my school's yearly festival. I went cause it was free, I was graduating, Vince Staples was on after him, and cause I liked 5 or 6 tracks off Ballads 1 (not to mention I grew up with Pink Guy/FF.) His vocals weren't particularly bad, just felt that his stage presence didn't mesh with what he was singing about and it created a certain dissonance that I found rather off-putting.

Vince Staples fucking crushed it though, with his roasting of the crowd and getting our school's name wrong only making it better. He even included All Nite in his set-list and it shocked me cause I figured that most of the crowd wouldn't recognize it. Had me geeking out for real."
hiphopheads,fnu0kjk,t1_fnt1mhh,1587252193.0,"The anti-vaxxer movement began with white soccer moms who thought getting the MMR shot would cause their children to develop autism after a for-hire quack put out a deliberately falsified study. Jenny McCarthy of all people was the first pop-anti vaxxer, propagating this bullshit through her many appearances on Oprah. If you want to talk about fucked up white people shit, the anti-vaccination movement is actually a pretty solid example. 

You have every right to be weary of government, but vaccines were a result of people fucking dying from polio/measles/meningitis/diptheria/mumps/smallpox/influenza and scientists finding a way to help them...well, not die. This ""question everything"" attitude is how we get Sandy Hook truthers, flat earthers and 5G."

Tea chats on the terrace

A wave from a friend/crush at my last Sun God, just as I was panicking after having lost my bestie in the crowd. I wasn't able to find my buddy, but the wave got me to smile and I jumped into the mosh-pit for the last 30 minutes with that little boost of confidence.

hiphopheads,fnpqwrq,t1_fnpjv95,1587150354.0,"It's because anti-vaxxers aren't questioning shit, they just can't be bothered to do actual research and cite a quack like Andrew Wakefield who seeks to widely spread disinformation for personal gain. Wakefield, the author of the long since retracted MMR study that created the whole anti-vaxxer movement, was being paid by a rival manufacturer and manipulated his methodology to achieve the result he wanted. I don't frown upon legitimate scientifically based discourse, but anti-vaxxers are incapable of engaging in anything resembling that.

For me, it's personal. I am on the autistic spectrum and the anti-vaxxer movement has done a massive amount of damage to our community over the last 20 years. All those kids with parents who would rather risk their physical health than have them be autistic and Wakefield's bullshit compounding the fallout of Autism Speaks' infamous ""I Am Autism ad"" that compared it to conditions like AIDS while showing sympathy for a parent who contemplated murdering her child because of it. The movement created a perception of folks on the spectrum as being victims when a great deal of us are high-functioning with little to no cognitive impairment. If I haven't made it clear, vaccines do not cause autism. Lack of vaccination has brought about a great deal of preventable deaths, reintroduced nearly eradicated illnesses like measles in the US, and forced informed parents to genuinely fear for the safety of their children if they happen to be immune-compromised.

I put less grief on African-Americans who have fallen sway to it given the generational trauma of the Tuskegee syphilis experiments. Seeing the legacy of this trauma as an outlet to promote disinformation, Andrew Wakefield and co. have been working with NOI lately for a campaign to target the community too. This is a big reason why you are now seeing folks like Snoop, Freddie Gibbs, and Royce espouse anti-vaccine shit."
bodegaboys,fnichih,t3_g0uuw5,1586977669.0,"I have plenty of qualms with Cuban (like a major issue in the Mavs workplace culture that he didn't handle properly), but the hoodie quote is being taken out of context to an extent. In that quote, it seemed like he was calling attention to his own failings and the ways that racism over generations affects the subconscious thought processes of people who may not even consider themselves to be racist. You wouldn't be wrong in arguing that it's tone deaf and something that should be left unsaid, but it's not particularly malicious. For the Brand, I wouldn't be surprised if they prefer someone doing that over claiming ally status while acting like they've never had a racist thought in their entire lives.

Cuban makes an effort to say the right things from a privileged position and it's a big part of his propensity for well-meaning statements that often come off at least somewhat tone deaf. For example, saying that the pandemic has impacted everyone while not qualifying it with the statistical fact that communities of color are bearing a disproportionate amount of the suffering.

I wouldn't be surprised if the Brand genuinely fucks with him because they are hardcore NBA fans and he's a player-facing owner who Mavs fans love in turn as a result (the polar opposite of Dolan.) Furthermore, he was the first to stand up for arena employees and ensure that they would still be paid as if the season was playing out (again, contrasting with the Knicks who were holding out on COVID-19 precautions before the shutdown.)"
nba,fly56ax,t1_flxglnv,1585595735.0,"I feel like Deebo and Lowry could've won last year sans Kawhi, assuming they are still able to work the math for the Gasol trade. The trio of Gasol, Ibaka, and Siakam formed a defensive wall that was pivotal to their victories against Philly and the Bucks, plus Lowry was still hitting clutch shots and taking charges.

Casey's coaching and being in the same conference as LeBron were the main things that kept them from the finals, so I think Deebo fits here. However, if Deebo doesn't get traded...you guys don't get Danny Green, who played a role in the two plays that got Klay hurt (not pissed about it anymore, even though I still wonder how it would've played out if he didn't go for the block on that dunk.)"
