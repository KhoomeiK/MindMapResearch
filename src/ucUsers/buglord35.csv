UCSC’s department is more social justice orientated if you’re seeking that kind of career/education. Unrelated to departments but UCSD seems in many ways to be a better school. More resources, prestige, right on the beach, etc. San Diego is also a nicer town with more affordable housing. They just built a trolley line that goes right to campus that connects students to downtown, malls, and cheap housing in East SD."
UCSC,fnuzz0g,t3_g3ambx,1587275869.0,I would say don't waste your time. I applied for housing my junior year and they didn't tell me I had on campus housing until TWO DAYS before move-in. Finding housing off campus needs to be arranged months in advance. Corona might change availability somewhat but probably not by much.
UCSC,fn1rf9l,t3_fyrbuw,1586568364.0,"They should just postpone it until September, twoish weeks before school starts. California’s cases will have long been peaked, and staff and the student volunteers (RAs and OLs) will already be on campus by then. It has to logistically be before school starts in any capacity, since some ceremonies are held Friday. Combing with next year’s graduation is a logistical nightmare because the city and school barely accommodate all those people as it is. Hotel reservations are already expensive and scarce, and getting to campus already takes 90 minutes. Even if they limited it to just parents (everyone would only get two tickets) it would be a disaster, because the ceremony would be twice as long."
UCSC,fn1pzae,t3_fysa3h,1586567425.0,"It wouldn’t be a zoom meeting, they would just live stream some speeches. I’m trying to keep an open mind about everything else but the very idea of a “virtual commencement” is insulting to me."

Edit: disregard this comment, I found it on another thread."
