UCSD,fo1mizy,t1_fnrleam,1587436560.0,"I'm just looking out for you (other female students as well), I know you guys can handle yourself just as well as males can (or can't) but fact is, females are targeted far more and it's not a 1 on 1 pepper spray kind of situation.

A lot of these attacks happen near campus, leading to a false sense of security. You're the one judging based on ""not knowing shit"".  It's not always a US MALES ARE STRONGER THEREFORE WOMEN NEED TO BE CAREFUL, women are targeted more because they are more sought after for human trafficking.

And to quote you, everyone is ""relatively fine"", until you're not. It takes one bad roll of the dice. Why does it always have to be about inferiority....

UCSD,fnl06yj,t3_g286zj,1587044243.0,"May I ask whatever info about the class that you are waitlisted on? If it's one that I'm in, I'd be willing to drop it just for you! Chacnes are we aren't taking the same class."
UCSD,fnl03b1,t1_fnkedhi,1587044178.0,"If you don't mind my asking, is tutoring at school a paid job? Or are you talking about something else because there are  different types of tutors if I remember correctly. Thanks."
UCSD,fnfx7hb,t3_g1cx0w,1586917397.0,"I dont think this is allowed on this sub, but I do need help with something, problem is idk how much to charge and I'd rather pay someone at SD struggling, than pay a stranger. I'm still broke and and can't offer much, but if you are desparate and if you are willing after some talksk maybe it might be worth it for you? Again, depends how badly you need the $.

I'm falling asleep again.

I've seen 3rd party amazon sellers sell the what I think hlaf this sub is capable of, but apparently people wamt it... I doubt it's illegal. But it's hilariouslt easy if you are good with computers. Msg me and I'l show you. I can evendo it myself, I legit wonder how profitable it is lol.

They are two separate potential $ earners tho. I literally can't stay awake any longer so maybe tomorrow. My offering is going to be an issue for a while so you have time until it gets fixed (old laptop) You have to be i SD tho."
UCSD,fnfslnm,t3_g1cx0w,1586914595.0,Deleted. Comes off as an ad. It was a bit irresponsible of me. Too many scammers.
UCSD,fnflkk2,t1_fnf8boe,1586910465.0,"Love the analogy, hate the reality. Unfortunate that it takes such a crisis to bring people together sometimes and I hope it brings UCSD together. Whether it's classmates or faculty, we all have to really put our differences aside to help one another.  I believe we really will get through this as a school, but concerned it'll only be until the pandemic is over,. Let's try to integrate our sense of community even when things are going well :)"
UCSD,fnfhm2m,t1_fnffb7h,1586908208.0,Ill send you a pm when I get home
UCSD,fnete45,t1_fnebm0o,1586895519.0,I'd just click to make the red go away lol. How do you make easy money?
UCSD,fndix9h,t1_fmdpth0,1586871051.0,Same...
UCSD,fndium9,t1_fnc68xt,1586871001.0,"⚠️ Trigger Warning  ⚠️ 

15 incompetent and rude hires might make it more stressful.

Before someone accusses me of being entitled and ungrateful, my situation literally couldn't have been handled worse. It was so bad a relative suggested I find a lawyer lol."
UCSD,fndiby7,t1_fn9cjev,1586870660.0,Wonder if students would take emails more seriously if everything wasn't an urgent announcement. Good for you regardless.
UCSD,fndhp40,t1_fmgbou6,1586870249.0,It's good email tho!
UCSD,fndhnvb,t1_fmdcore,1586870227.0,I genuinely wonder if all other countries use email nearly as commonly. Sorry about your inbox
UCSD,fndhhei,t1_fmdpc6m,1586870107.0,"I'm a returnee and never had close to that volume, but I did work where emails aren't used as much."
UCSD,fndhauw,t1_fmdxmw7,1586869987.0,Masochist. There's no other explanation!
UCSD,fndh2ob,t1_fnde463,1586869830.0,"Just a walk for a dude and a lady can be very different. I mean look at your usernames!

Before I get down voted and the server calls me a child, the first part was actually a serious comment, considering female students post on this sub about their first hand experience almost being kidnapped..... then I looked at the usernames and thought it was interesting...but yeah I wouldn't recommend walking at night time, especially as a female student. There was a kidnapping attempt near that area a quarter or two ago."
UCSD,fndgxuj,t3_g11ojp,1586869741.0,"In the end, only you can make that call. I'm surprised you find it surprising it's hard to find parking as an undergrad, period lol."
brave_browser,fmd0yl6,t1_fmcbb9l,1585956928.0,Just practice safe social distancing by moving your chair about 4 feet away from the screen and you'll be fine I think.
