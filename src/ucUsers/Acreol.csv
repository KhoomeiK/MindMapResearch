How and how many different colored pencils/pens do you use?  What's OH? Can you also talk about headstuck more (causes, symptoms, etc)?--I think I experience it a lot but I've never heard the term explicated. Thanks again and I really look forward to your other presentations!"

berkeley,flw2fg9,t1_flvzysh,1585537919.0,"thanks, I was thinking that the online courses I took on edX could cover the prereqs:

math54: linear algebra (laff and first 3 weeks of alaff--had to stop because it was too difficult)

math 54: differential equations (18.03x series--currently doing the nxn course and unfortunately i missed fourier series and pdes)

stat 134: 6.431x (in progress)

I think I will drop 162 but I was hoping to skip 61A because I have experience with data structures from watching ocw 6.006 and 6.046j lectures on youtube and some programming competitions (C++ coding but not very abstract); I don't know python yet but I'm hoping to learn it soon because I want to try quantitative trading with quantopian and alpaca. I have a lot of programming experience in Lua from Roblox development"
