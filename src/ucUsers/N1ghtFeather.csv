worldnews,foz023r,t1_foxl0q7,1588182333.0,"Definitely, but that’s a lot riskier of a move on the US’ part, and I believe ifTaiwan is recognized as an independent country, China has promised to invade immediately as they are no longer considered part of China internationally."
worldnews,fox76m0,t1_fougbh6,1588135776.0,"I think it’s because it’s still a win for Taiwan as it’s something they’ve pursued, and Trump is supportive of that country’s ambitions. Doesn’t matter what we’re doing, they want it and we’re backing them if it’s what they want."

PublicFreakout,foeldql,t1_foeaxoi,1587706903.0,Yup. Mainstream media is totally warping reality.
PublicFreakout,foel9jw,t1_foei46y,1587706808.0,"Yeah but what are the Dem's trying to add? The bill was intended to just be another small business relief bill, the Dems as far as I know were attempting to add a bunch of fluff which is definitely important, but appropriate for a following Bill so this one could have been passed ASAP."
PublicFreakout,foek6lc,t1_foe739n,1587705935.0,Its crazy what kind of narratives mainstream media is pushing. It's hard to tell what's even reality anymore without actually listening in to these things live.
PublicFreakout,foek32i,t1_foe80hr,1587705857.0,"The funny thing is Pelosi and the Dem's are the one that are refusing to pass the relief bills, just get the money to businesses!"

PublicFreakout,foejvgz,t3_g6ypeq,1587705691.0,"What? The democrats are the ones that keep preventing the bills from being passed, trying to add a bunch of stuff in and slowing the process, if you listen to Trump's briefing he's been trying to push the bills asap."
sandiego,fo69zbs,t1_fo5rshu,1587552095.0,While you raise a very valid point about our economy I think the downvoted are from the delivery.  Honestly we gotta get the gears moving ASAP but still practice social distancing and mask wearing

Coronavirus,fmhd0hz,t1_fmgyfry,1586075140.0,USPS has bipartisan support and is in some ways the arm of the government on the civilian front. IRS and Jury Duty rely on it for example.
