UCSD,fpbparq,t1_fpbogxh,1588475354.0,Definitely. And I didn't want my reply to sound like I was delegitimizing your experiences. Best of luck in your next stage!
UCSD,fpbnvua,t3_gcghg8,1588474383.0,"Totally fair to transfer. And while I can't speak to all of the issues you raised (especially with regards to the CS dept), I'm a recent UCSD alum, and I want to offer a different perspective for those who might be coming here in the future. When I committed to UCSD, I started off a pessimist. I was mad about not getting into other UC's, I heard all the ""socially dead"" and ""triton eye"" stuff. And I regret letting that pessimism cloud my experience, because when I let it go and realized the grass wasn't greener on the other side, my whole perspective on UCSD changed.

I am so sorry to hear about the racial slurs. I hope this doesn't happen a lot, I am brown and can't remember experiencing any overt racism in my 4 years there. In fact, coming from a HS where I regularly had racist experiences, the shift to being treated & graded objectively at UCSD was incredible for me.

Secondly, the socially dead thing. Sure, there may be a certain extent to which the layout/culture of UCSD makes it harder to rage. But I'm at UCLA for grad school and regularly talk to undergrads here who have just as much trouble finding friends and socializing as anyone I knew at UCSD. I really believe there's a ton of confirmation bias going on with this idea. Personally, I joined a few clubs, had some difficulty making friends for a while, and then I eventually made lifelong friends by sticking it out, and I know so many people who had the same experience.

All in all, while transferring might be the right decision for OP, I want incoming freshmen to know UCSD has all the resources for you to have a great experience, and at the same time, you're going to face mostly the same challenges that your peers at all the other large UC's face.

TL;DR - UCSD can be a great experience, the grass isn't greener on the other side"
BonAppetit,fouyelj,t3_g9qgvv,1588092422.0,Love them but I think they may have unrealistic expectations of my pantry...
ucla,f85b1ef,t1_f855l2u,1574271450.0,Love this! Another thing that helped me is recording myself giving impromptu answers to questions and playing them back. A little painful at first but you will realize what you really sound like and what you want to change.
