whowouldwin,fnwrl1n,t3_g4cczl,1587324062.0,"Without Legends feats for Obi-Wan, Kakashi takes him out without a problem. Obi-Wan’s force precognition will be canceled out by the Sharingan, and Kakashi’s speed and agility feats outdo anything Ben can even hope to imagine. The only chance Ben has at a victory is if he lands a swing of the saber when Kakashi is in close range, but with Kakashi’s arsenal of jutsu, that’s unlikely."

It wasn’t a “what stopped you” kind of question
It was more of a “I wanted to see what would happen if you succeeded, and I’m a little disappointed that now I’ll never know” kind of question"
AskReddit,fisa01z,t3_f9g0zz,1582680854.0,"Got into a car accident on the way to work during the summer before my senior year in high school. I was at a stop light in and in the turn lane, and this prissy, stuck up, valley girl wannabe busts up the front of her car by T-boning me, probably while texting or something. The airbag burned my arms and the hot coffee that I was sipping went all over my face and arms, so I got a number of minor burns along with the fracture in my left arm and the whiplash from the hit. I exchanged info with the asshole and had to get an ambulance, called my mom, she jetted from work to meet me at the hospital, and in the middle of her freakout, my boss called and asked me where I was. I told him what had happened and that I'd have a cast on my left arm for a while, and after a couple moments of silence he just said ""you know we're really understaffed today... when do you think you can leave the hospital?""

I didn't tell my mom he said that, otherwise she would have bitten his head off through the phone."
