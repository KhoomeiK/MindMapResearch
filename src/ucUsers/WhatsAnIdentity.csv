UCI,fo40ikz,t3_g5d15d,1587496102.0,Go you!! Iâ€™m so happy for you. I came as a transfer too after being rejected in high school and I dont regret it at all. ðŸ’œ
UCI,fnpudgn,t3_g2vhsj,1587152168.0,"The sad truth is to keep people on payroll and prevent thousands of students from losing their jobs, that money has to come from somewhere. 

The stimulus package UCI will be receiving will be 50% to the students and 50% most likely to operations keeping the campus running so THAT WAY WE HAVE A SCHOOL TO ATTEND STILL when itâ€™s all over. Keeping the campus running is important.

Yes we didnâ€™t get stimulus checks the first time around, but now we have assurance that there is money going to be given to us in the second wave of these stimulus bills to help students. This is a confusing and unprecedented time for everyoneâ€“even the school. There are a lot of moving parts. We donâ€™t just receive money, and throw it out. The school is most likely quiet because theyâ€™re trying to navigate this money since it was JUST given. 

$800 is a lot of money but to prevent even more people from being broke, hungry, and homeless during this time, we have to find a middle ground."
