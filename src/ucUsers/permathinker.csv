Those papers were under the enormous shadow of the LA Times before, while now they'll only be tied to one another in their part of the region. I think this will shape up to be a good thing."

SeattleWA,fod7vup,t1_focbm8u,1587681374.0,Yup. Viral load is a very real thing. It's why healthcare workers are at such risk; they are repeatedly exposed to it in a way that no one else is.
AskAnAmerican,fod7h3c,t3_g6p3p3,1587681201.0,"I have such a bad impression of Dubai that I actually took the written portion of the GRE as an opportunity to bag on it as a mirage in the desert built on slave labor with an oppressive society underneath the surface. It actually did tie into the question but can't remember it, heh."

SeattleWA,fo8ltv3,t1_fo86qy6,1587599086.0,"Calculus is a bad example, math builds on math and a faulty measure of the student's current knowledge won't do them or the school any good if they're going for STEM. I hear the premise of what you're saying, though."
lakers,fo7pxmo,t3_g65jc3,1587582524.0,"Until I finally ponied up for a Kobe jersey a couple of years ago, Lamar's was the only one I owned. Bought a replica at the JCPenney at the Glendale (CA) Galleria the summer we traded for him. Fully embracing the new post-Shaq era that was just beginning."
UCSantaBarbara,fo5gzm0,t3_g5jcn5,1587525413.0,"I'll admit, I started my undergrad at UCSB but didn't finish out. Was too immature, and too lost to really execute and get it into gear. I finished up elsewhere, even got a masters, but UCSB and IV will always be that school and place closest to my heart; I just have way too many significant memories. That transition over the grate as you go under the bridge? I can still **feel** that. This is heartbreaking, seeing all the energy gone."
MBA,fo4l0g7,t1_f8z6r1e,1587506338.0,"Way tardy to the party, but UTD's MBA made #33 in US News. Seems to be a great school that is, as of now, quite underrated and slept on."
utdallas,fny5xs0,t3_g4lclp,1587354209.0,"Haha, don't worry college can be confusing! It's great that you're trying to get a jump on understanding things now! So a credit hour is very roughly the number of hours you'll spend in class per week. So a 3 credit hour class might be 1.5 hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays, or 1 hour on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, for example. This isn't always exact, but it does give you an idea of what classes are going to take up more of your time day-to-day than other classes at your school.

Now, colleges are usually either semester or quarter based. That means that in a year you either have 2 semesters (about 15-16 weeks) + summer, or 3 quarters (about 10 weeks) plus summer. For this reason 1 semester credit = 1.5 quarter credits, because you spend more weeks in a semester class. You'll only have to worry about this if you try to transfer in credits from a quarter school. 

UTD is semester based, so you'll need at least 120 total credits to graduate."

news,fnuyc5x,t3_g3x3as,1587274472.0,"My staunchly conservative mother has finally, after nearly four years, dumped Trump once and for all because of the way he's fanning the flames like a child and undermining the hard work that the governors have done. She was never a Trumper, just voted along her party lines in '16. She's openly acknowledged her appreciation for Gov. Newsom through this and will even give him a vote in his next election, and will write in different conservative for president this year; she's still conservative after all, and while we disagree on a lot of political things I do understand why she feels the way she does.

But openly voicing approval for a Democrat and dumping the commander-in-chief of the party she supports, I truly never thought I'd see the day, boys, girls, and non-binary friends."

conan,fnhld01,t3_g1tqhq,1586964521.0,"Hader, Tim Olyphant, Kevin Nealon, and Keegan Michael-Key are all riots. Probably not a coincidence that he's genuinely good friends with all of them except maybe Key, and even then they jived so well that a friendship might've sparked right then. Nikki Glaser was great in a different way, and so was Colbert; even though he sometimes gets flak here it seems like the two of them really touched on something deep with each other.

Really though, there are very few **bad** episodes in the bunch, if any."

LosAngeles,fnf2n01,t1_fnf11qs,1586900279.0,"That's exactly what he's saying, that we can't keep people in homes forever, and said the factors that they're going to look at when deciding to open things back up, plus working with, and deferring to, health officials to find the right timeline and getting them the right data to make that call (which we don't have just yet). It'd be idiotic for a public official to throw a date out there publicly before being totally sure that it could be done, though lesser men have tried that already.

There's neither a crystal ball nor a fast-forward button for this. Once restrictions are eased, it'll be hell trying to put them back in place if things get back out of control. I'd rather wait for the job to be done right than be done sloppily on my time."
LosAngeles,fnf15nj,t1_fnexwgf,1586899509.0,">He's also making references to a timeline that will be revisited in 2 weeks if things trend a certain way...why not just show us this supposed timeline now?

Because people are finicky animals, and if you give them even a nibble of a **possible** timeline they'll scream bloody murder if that timeline isn't met."
LosAngeles,fnf0pze,t1_fnewskp,1586899289.0,"Right? Everyone is sitting around demanding hard dates in a fluid situation.

Shit sucks right now. This is far from ideal. We're all going through it, and there's no fast-forwarding it."

MLS,fne2s7v,t1_fndzp9a,1586882047.0,"A bit of a joke, but not really an exaggeration. The NBA stepping up by shutting down was the big domino that started all the other sporting and other events and venues to shut down en massé, and *everyone* noticed."
AskAnAmerican,fne173p,t3_g17hrl,1586881238.0,"Urban western Washington and Portland have an image of being white, hipster, liberal/leftist, bookish, nature loving, and generally tolerant, nice, and polite if a bit introverted and passive-aggressive. Many of those stereotypes do hold up, with some more variety in there than you might expect due to all the new people flowing in for work over the years, and they're surrounded by a pretty deep red, rural ocean."
