UCSD,fpjngqv,t3_gdtzm0,1588675011.0,Honestly CAT series would be interesting if I wasnâ€™t always swamped by my math and cs classes
UCSD,fpjn7cx,t3_gduyci,1588674748.0,I think our sub has started a trend of posting at 3 AM and later
UCSD,fpff3nq,t3_gd4z4g,1588569390.0,"I just saw in summer session 1 there is one section of CSE 190 that is about applying machine learning on audio, and the professor seems to come from music department. Hopefully I can get enrolled soon"
UCSD,fpcflka,t3_gcmpja,1588498742.0,"I think you can also try to find people who want to sub lease. The rent itself might be similar from you signing a contract directly with the leasing office, but at least you donâ€™t need to satisfy some income requirements the leasing office might have."
UCSD,fp92zaj,t3_gbvxr7,1588412318.0,"Although you say you are going to switch major in both schools anyway, it will be much easier for us to give advice to you if you specify which area you are interested in or some career goal. Also tell us which college you got accepted into at UCSD if you are willing to share. Different colleges have vastly different general education requirements. This is important because, for example, if you are not very good at writing/humanities, you probably donâ€™t want to have to take five writing classes centered on history/religion."
UCSD,fp91y32,t3_gbyfmp,1588411187.0,"If itâ€™s about materials that you actually want to nail, definitely take it again later. You will probably learn it better without the stress of failing making you more anxious and less productive"
UCSD,fp0wgb2,t3_gakocd,1588218470.0,"Honestly you can probably convince yourself by thinking that some classes are harder in an online format than the others, or you did not foresee that you are not fully prepared for online learning, so taking a harder class P/NP can relieve your stress and  make you do better in easier classes that you still take for letter grade. I'm sure whatever grad school/company that will look at your grade can also think of those reasons."
UCSD,fp0vq33,t3_gan48b,1588218002.0,Isn't this against the policy that says sessions should be available asynchronously?
UCSD,fp0d3uz,t3_gai7lp,1588206953.0,Also check if dropping this specific class will put you behind too much on the schedule. Maybe you can try to find a replacement to take during summer session or next fall
UCSD,foxzsmf,t3_ga6hid,1588161565.0,Here I am commenting at 5 am taking a break from working on PA
UCSD,fow6rd0,t3_g971mu,1588114053.0,"I just got my CSE BS/MS decision, and I also saw others getting regular ECE master offer from UCSD, so I guess ECE BS/MS decision should be soon"
UCSD,fohfdnb,t3_g74t2u,1587765000.0,"After I visited UCSB a few months ago on a Sunday, I would say UCSD is probably the best choice among 4 universities who gave me offers back then. I just can't handle the fact that a campus can be so quiet and dead on a Sunday. Also, seeing a bunch of people partying with furry costumes downtown Santa Barbara also makes me feel like I won't fit in this kind of social activity."
UCSD,foecav5,t3_g6zcbl,1587700431.0,"I will probably just take some summer classes, do leetcode questions, and build some mobile app since I already know how to do that. I'm a third year whose internship got cancelled"
StardewValley,fo9oyu9,t3_g6f46d,1587626188.0,"I find it kind of funny that the Chinese characters below ""void"" means ""sesame"", which also happens to be black in some cases"
UCSD,fnkkb6w,t3_g29zzc,1587030320.0,"If you know anyone who has programming knowledge/experience, discussing general concepts such as variable declaration and assignment can help too"
UCSD,fnjsz07,t3_g25tap,1587006274.0,My shit load of work has totally made me forget the existence of the virus for a while now. I sometimes forget the world outside of my apartment actually exists. I did play Stardew Valley for a bit though before the work ate up all of my free time.
UCSD,fnemusn,t3_g1b60v,1586892187.0,"I can totally relate after taking CSE 152 and CSE 151A, and am now taking CSE 120ðŸ˜‚"
UCSD,fn1n0ei,t3_fys6qu,1586565518.0,"I thought 4 units = 10 hours/week? I'm taking a research class with 4 units, and the expected workload is 10 hours/week. But I do understand that even by this standard, you are probably working more than the norm. I think everyone has a few courses like that. I personally have definitely spent 20 hours/week on 4 unit classes before."
StardewValley,fn03obk,t1_fmz9kn7,1586534885.0,Because star fruit wine worth a lot. I just send all my star fruits to kegs
StardewValley,fn03j8n,t1_fmzvtm2,1586534809.0,I plant like 1000 star fruits each summerðŸ˜‚
StardewValley,fmyyx32,t3_fy8xs6,1586500258.0,That's how many star fruit seeds I buy each time from the desert lol
UCSD,fmuwq7h,t3_fxgjus,1586400592.0,"There is also a list of UCSD classes that automatically satisfy the practicum requirement. Depending on your major, one of your major requirements might overlap with that."
StardewValley,fmrkmct,t3_fwn5un,1586326110.0,Nice drawing! That's totally the mood for online classes lol. I'm taking a cognitive science class about language and can recognize a few terms in your notes :)
StardewValley,fmqk0rf,t3_fwnmzb,1586301130.0,I want some passion fruit green tea
StardewValley,fmkgh1j,t3_fvss37,1586154133.0,"I got everything in the community center except for the vaults, which I didn't have enough money for. Then I started working on my farm like crazy to get more money (I usually enjoy fishing and digging through trash can much more than farming). Life becomes so much busier. I reached my goal, and I thought it was finally time to relax, but I just could not let myself become less busy from then on. I'm still in college right now, and I often wonder if I will do the same thing and make the same decision in real life one day."
