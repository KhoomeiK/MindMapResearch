DivinityOriginalSin,fo5dh9g,t1_fo3l6hd,1587523038.0,This seems just about as optimized as fextralife builds. In fact this one is basically the same as the blood mage build fextralife has.
DivinityOriginalSin,fo3imrd,t1_fo381i6,1587487525.0,They seem pretty optimized to me for the things they are trying to accomplish. If you really want an optimized playthrough you'd probably be carrying barrels of deathfog.

UCSC,fnefnag,t3_g1abcb,1586888519.0,Java and C/C++ are good languages to learn after python. They help cement good programming practices and teach you some more fundamentals about programming. If you are interested in AI definitely keep programming in python as well. Many of the tools used in ML are for python.

UCSC,fn41imr,t3_fz8o6m,1586632160.0,"I had the same issue. I contacted my college advisor and they let me reduce my minimum credit requirement. This is probably because I am a graduating senior, so I applied for being a part time student. If they won't drop the minimum credits for you, try switching one of your classes to P/NP so it wont hurt your GPA."
