rareinsults,fpaj1ks,t1_fp95btf,1588449190.0,Ay thanks mate
rareinsults,fp94714,t1_fp8ywuq,1588413675.0,"Honestly, I dislike the guy myself, but saying he was barely a UFC fighter and trying to characterize his UFC run as terrible is just not true. If you beat Cro Cop, Gonzaga, and Mitrione (and arguably Arlovski), you are a VERY elite fighter. Championship caliber? Nah. But he was a solid fighter. 

(His “comedy,” though.. painful)"
rareinsults,fp940dw,t1_fp93vrx,1588413464.0,"Honestly, before this past month, I would have disagreed with you, but he’s been pissing me off lately. Dude’s going full retard"
MMA,fp0b8fd,t1_fp08iej,1588205940.0,"Yeah, /u/edS909 and I are good mates with Till, it’s what we call him. You casuals wouldn’t understand 🤪"
hiphopheads,fozzoo9,t1_fozqzho,1588199760.0,"It absolutely could be projecting. But when on Reddit, even the hip hop subs (maybe even ESPECIALLY the hip hop subs), it’s almost always safe to assume people are talking out of their ass, especially when claiming to be about that life. Maybe the original commentor IS from the streets and would never snitch on a member of his crew. But it’s extremely unlikely, so it’s more fun to call people out when there’s a 99% chance they’re not, ya know?

EDIT: Turns out you are the original commenter. Maybe I’m wrong and maybe you wouldn’t snitch. It was still a safe bet on this subreddit without knowing you that you would tho"
hiphopheads,fozmkex,t1_fozjz2h,1588193168.0,"Okay so usually I wouldn’t even feel the need to go into detail with stuff like this because what 6ix9ine is ACTUALLY accused of doing is fucked up enough, but if you read your own article you posted, he is definitely not on film having sex with a 13 year old girl. Your entire argument gets completely diluted when you just make shit up, so try to avoid doing that. 

I don’t generally defend the guy, and would never straight up be like “yeah what he did wasn’t even bad bro.” Being anywhere near the presence of a 13 year old in a sexual environment is all kinds of fucked. What I DO call out, because it’s fun and the shit bothers me, is people who spend way too much time listening to hip hop and watching Boyz n the Hood that they actually think they’re hard themselves. Facing a lifetime in prison, I’m gonna snitch on a fuckin gang. So would the OP, so would you. 

Call him out all you want for being a creep, but don’t imply that you would somehow be all gucci with spending your life in prison over some imaginary bond that you’re not even a part of as a young suburban dude who listens to rap."
hiphopheads,foziuwm,t1_fozhkfy,1588191397.0,"Yeah man, I’m sure you woulda taken that 40 year sentence. I have no doubt you would have remained strong and told that judge to fuck himself and spent the rest of your life in prison. You’re an absolute savage"
ucla,foex6md,t1_foepp81,1587717937.0,What’s your major? I’ve never understood how people listen to lectures without taking COPIOUS amounts of notes the entire time lol
