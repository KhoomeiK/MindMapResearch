GreenBayPackers,fpc36z7,t1_fpbnsaj,1588486138.0,"I agree about the FO not valuing LB enough, but Edmunds wasn’t available when we picked Jaire. While he WAS available at the pick we traded back from, we used that pick to get the first from the Saints that became Savage. Overall I’d say getting 2 firsts, and then having them be Jaire + Savage is better resource investment than just Edmunds."

GreenBayPackers,foj3zbm,t1_foj3weg,1587807450.0,And Jimmy Graham has a highlight posting up and high pointing the ball for a touchdown against the bears in week 1. Like I hope I’m wrong but I’d really recommend watching some more of him
GreenBayPackers,foj3pys,t3_g7p625,1587807155.0,"Yes, Dillon is 250 lbs. However, I watched 5 games of Dillon after we picked him and in MY opinion, and take this with a grain of salt because I’m just a random guy on the internet, while he’s large he does not have very good contact balance. He will run through tackles around his legs because his legs are huge and very strong, and he’ll make some ok wiggles and jump cuts, but from what I’ve watched he is NOT the type of back to truck through someone."

nfl,fkyeolt,t3_flgcw2,1584647251.0,Running backs are a dying breed these days. They need to find a new way to structure their contracts though because they’re getting HOSED with the way things are right now.
