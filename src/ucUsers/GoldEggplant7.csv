UCSC,fpjcwq1,t3_gdsl0x,1588663972.0,"I would say you will be a good fit for Oakes, Merrill, and Rachel Carson in that order. Oakes, while it's far away from everything, has a really tight-knit and mellow community. Merrill is also mellow for the most part. From my own experience, I've seen more Latinx students affiliated with those two more than any other if that matters to you. I myself am a Rachel Carson affiliate, and I've found RCC to be 50/50 in terms of how the folks are. Half of the buildings had ultra social people while other half had super introverted folks. No doubt though, that it's one of the most, if not, the most bio-related major friendly college.

Lastly, don't stress too much about your college affiliation. It really only matters during your first few quarters and you will likely find yourself interacting with students from outside of your college depending on your classes and extracurricular activities. Congrats to you for getting in! :)"
UCSC,fpja20g,t3_gdptga,1588661232.0,"As several others have mentioned, you will not be able to switch into CS. Since others have recommended CE and game design, I have one more recommendation for you. 

If you're still somewhat interested in business but if you're interested in computer science as well, you might want to take a look at Technology and Information Management (TIM) major. It consists of roughly 2/3 CS/engineering courses and 1/3 econ courses. You get to take all the same lower-division courses that CS majors take on top of econ and TIM courses. At other schools, TIM is also known as MIS."
UCSC,fpfqqew,t3_gd34xa,1588580080.0,"Hi I'm a third-year BME major! The BME major here is not a true business major btw. It's essentially an economics major with business electives. That means the major's core foundation is still economics. The business electives are diverse, and include classes in business strategy, finance, marketing, commerce, management science, and accounting. You can pick and choose from the electives to suit your interests. 

The accounting emphasis is popular here and is recommended if you're interested in becoming a CPA. Quite a few folks end up in Big 4 from here.

For the most part, the professors have been great. Check ratemyprofessor (not to assess their rating but their class structure) and this subreddit before enrolling in classes. If the professor you get doesn't work well with you, almost all the classes have TAs and most are quite helpful. 

Your job opportunities will largely depend on **you.** If you make the effort to network and build a great resume, you will get to where you want to get to.  

Feel free to dm me if you have more questions!"
UCSC,fpeqxpm,t3_gd0j4d,1588553050.0,"I don’t check my notes not because I’m worried about getting caught but rather, that takes up a lot of precious time. 

Last quarter, I flunked my open-book final because I was too reliant on my notes and I ran out of time. One should study as if the exam is closed-book even if it’s an open-book exam."
UCSC,fpdxrgn,t3_gcwc5w,1588536358.0,"Luka is a TA for Dobkin's 104 this quarter. I dropped 104 after week 1 (Dobkin is great BTW I just couldn't handle the workload with my other classes) so I didn't have the chance to go to Luka's section, but since he's working with Dobkin's class this quarter, he'll probably teach the class similarly to the way Dobkin teaches it."
UCSC,fpc29gv,t3_gcl0ny,1588485305.0,I’ve never taken a class with him but I can confirm that they’re the same person.
UCSC,fpa8qkn,t3_gbrd5c,1588443094.0,"This is the kind of professor we all need! 

Also those text colors are oddly satisfying to look at with the dark mode on ;)"
UCSC,fp7plip,t1_fp7murn,1588375186.0,Y’all would be lucky if he decides to just proctor the final via Zoom. That’s how it was done in Bulman’s 113 last quarter
UCSC,fp3uirz,t1_fp3sker,1588286054.0,"You might be able to make a compelling case if you take 100A/100B/113 and do well in at least one of those three classes. After all, the whole purpose of AM 11 series is to prepare students for 100A/100B/113 (mostly for 100A tbh). I myself did not do that great in the AM 11 series and I still ended up doing well in all three of them. 

I hope everything works out!"
UCSC,fp3qtl0,t3_gb4cpe,1588284127.0,"In terms of extension, you'll have to ask the advisors for confirmation, but my guess is you'll have until Fall 2020. You have until end of spring quarter to declare if you're a sophomore. By that logic, an extension should be required only if a student was unable to petition during the spring quarter. 

If your GPA fell below 2.8 because of your first calculus course (a lot of people's GPA drop because of their grade in their first calculus course), you may be able to make your petition more compelling by doing well in AM 11B. I've been told that some folks were able to successfully petition because they did well in AM 11B, but keep in mind that this NOT GUARANTEED! 

You'll definitely want to talk to econ advising ASAP, but know that declaration via petition is still plausible. Good luck!"
UCSC,fp1gf8v,t3_gan7lq,1588234658.0,"Obviously my guess is only as good as anyone else’s, but what I’m thinking is the school will probably give housing priority to students who are enrolled in courses that have to be taken in person (I’m assuming mostly labs). Somehow I don’t see the social distancing rules going away at least until the end of the year. If social distancing rules continue, it will be very difficult for the school and Santa Cruz Area to handle all of us being back.

It seems that many CA universities are gearing toward keeping fall quarter/semester online with the exception of select courses. UCSC will likely follow. I know online learning has been very difficult for many and people have been anxious for things to return to normal, but returning to normal will come with its own set of challenges. If we continue online this fall, the best we can hope for is for more professors to be flexible."
UCSC,fp1d7ac,t3_gaq8lt,1588231625.0,"104 is essentially econometrics + writing while 197 is economic theory + writing. In 104, you have to read and write a lot about statistics and take your STATA programming Knowledge to the next level. In 197, the focus is on rhetoric. If you enjoyed 113 and did well in it and/or if you really like math, you’ll like 104. Otherwise I would recommend 197. Pick whichever one appeals more to you. Both classes teach you equally valuable things but YMMV depending on your interests."
UCSC,fozslia,t3_gai1ol,1588196136.0,My MSI sessions have been no-shows for the entire quarter so far and I only have one student in one of my SGT 4 MSI sessions. I even took a survey and adjusted my schedule this week and still I have no attendance :(. I'm so thankful for even having one student at this point.
UCSC,fozp4dm,t1_fox5lt7,1588194411.0,"I can totally relate. It's funny how among my high school classmates, way more of them who went to CCs ended up in top schools like Berkeley and UCLA compared to those who opted for 4-years right after high school. More importantly, the CC people got to pursue majors that they actually want because they had more freedom to explore their options. One can never underestimate the value of community colleges."
UCSC,fodjufa,t1_fod8t9t,1587685588.0,"Unfortunately most professors will likely not change until a major incident occurs :( Many of them have the mentality of ""risk is minimal if nothing bad has happened so far."""
UCSC,fo4edc9,t1_fo2we9o,1587502905.0,"I know part of the appeal of doing the AI/HCI concentration is the CSE courses, but as you have been told already, those courses are very difficult to get into if you're not a CS/engineering major.

 If you're still absolutely set on coming to UCSC for cog sci w/ AI/HCI concentration, there is a way to work around the upper-division CSE courses and still do the AI/HCI concentration. The classes you can potentially take are ECE 8, ECE 9, CMPM 80K, and MUSC 80L. Keep in mind ECE 8 and 9 have prereqs and are only offered once during the school year (excluding summer session) so you'll have to plan accordingly."
