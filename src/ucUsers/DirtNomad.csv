UCSD,fovwcu7,t3_g9uvxa,1588108670.0,"They'll be sending out chocolates soon and if yours comes with a golden ticket, you will be allowed to return and attend in-person lectures."
UCSD,fo781vm,t3_g5x3pq,1587573846.0,You’ll be able to fly a plane after this pre-flight check.
UCSD,fnnz5zb,t1_fnnowx5,1587106392.0,I think they pushed back room selection to June. I think June will be when the decision is made and we’re notified.
UCSD,fnnywd2,t3_g2t2kn,1587106141.0,"Yup. I mean, they pushed back room selection quite a bit. Here we go again..."
UCSD,fn99333,t3_g0e9s7,1586763824.0,"I found the text online pretty easily but I think you can opt into red shelf(I believe that's what it's called) and read it there. The readings they have been assigning will definitely help. Also, I find the lab hours really helpful with PA's. That being said, the workload is crazy. I feel like it's an easy 20hrs a week this quarter. Hit me up if you need some help."
UCSD,fn5kiu3,t3_fzljj6,1586667366.0,"Wear a helmet! One bad concussion and your quarter is gonna be much, much harder, although helmets don’t really prevent this as much as they will help keep the brains in. If you can afford an electric, they have regenerative braking, this helps with the downhills. Otherwise, walk down the hills until you’ve gained experience. Always be thinking ahead and have an escape route should things go bad (people stop walking ahead of you). Don’t try to keep up with others, they could have been skating for years. Go at your own speed. Bigger wheels will provide you with a smoother, quieter ride. Adjust the torque on your trucks for your skill level. Tighter will make it harder to turn but you will risk less speed wobbles which often lead to falling.  Longer boards also are less susceptible to speed wobble. Have fun!"
UCSD,fn1df0o,t1_fn0ujc6,1586559708.0,It begins April 13th so if yours is on the 15th some people will have a two day head start.
UCSD,fn0ssyq,t3_fym0wb,1586548059.0,"Yeah, you can look at your appointment time just the same as you do with regular quarters. It's in webreg, little link at the top above class search."
UCSD,fmucuuh,t3_fxgjus,1586388906.0,"If you could land an internship that would satisfy the requirement, I'd say do that as you can gain experience, letters of rec, pay (hopefully)."
UCSD,fmuc7sj,t3_fx344x,1586388551.0,"Any one know where exactly this is updated in our accounts? Could you point me to it? It's not just done by changing your address in the addresses section, is it?"
UCSD,fmubaka,t3_fx9i7l,1586388038.0,"After the first week I was left wondering the same thing, when will I have time to study? One of my classes has readings, podcasts assigned for quizzes due Tuesday and Thursday mornings, Lecture T,TH, exam on Fridays, weekly programming assignments. Easy 20 hrs a week for just this class and I have three others! May have to drop down to 3 classes total."
UCSD,fmdv1zc,t1_fmdtwq6,1585978876.0,Is there room for a desk? I have an inexpensive one from ikea that works ok. Otherwise maybe a bed tray?
