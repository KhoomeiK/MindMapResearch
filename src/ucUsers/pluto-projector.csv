berkeley,fpjhl0p,t1_fpjexn3,1588668776.0,I agree with a lot of whats been said^ also i would probably just not do merge (unless you already have) and just focus on debugging everything else. you can still get 23~ points without merge and merge is time consuming so leave it for last.
berkeley,fpjg6bw,t1_fpjg2h2,1588667280.0,kinda random but i have to say course staff for 61b is amazing this sem🙌🏽thank you!!
berkeley,fpjbo95,t3_gdrr2x,1588662768.0,"ask for an extension, you have nothing to lose. you can do this!!"
berkeley,fpcb3ok,t1_fpc0cc9,1588493903.0,"in all seriousness, what would you recommend a student in this position to do?"
berkeley,fp8q5vh,t1_fp8f62m,1588399407.0,"for what it’s worth, most transfer students don’t stay in dorms and are able to make friends. requires extra effort I suppose, but you’ll be okay."
berkeley,fovwis8,t1_fovs4en,1588108754.0,"honestly, they should use a grading scheme similar to that of MT2. MT2 was crazy but they graded it fairly."
berkeley,fovpbqy,t1_fovp7kt,1588105199.0,but don’t most lower div cs/eecs classes end up shifting the bins by some amount even though they say they won’t?

berkeley,fovkmfu,t3_g9tt35,1588102913.0,does anyone know how much they tend to shift the bins at the end of the semester? :((

berkeley,foisfng,t1_foipyja,1587795521.0,"tbh I personally haven’t heard this rumor. I doubt the school will release an official statement on this because they probably want to encourage students to participate in final examinations even if they’re already passing. If anything, some teachers might choose to make an announcement for their class and say that you don’t have to take the final if you’re passing, but again, I doubt this."
berkeley,foippeu,t3_g7o8p8,1587793113.0,"If you’re already passing the class before the final, then in a sense the final is optional for you because it has no impact on your grade."
berkeley,fofafdf,t3_g77anh,1587731113.0,"Idk about the professors, but from a declaring standpoint, taking 61b + data 100 might be best. cs 70 is usually really hard for people so i’d recommend having a pretty (chill) schedule when you take 70 so you can really focus on it and make sure you get the grade you need in order to declare."
berkeley,fo7jhqb,t3_g5xhqm,1587579387.0,hey I was wondering if you could tell me where I can see my position on the waitlist for a class? It told me when I initially enrolled but I can’t find that info again on cal central.
berkeley,fnfuy7p,t1_fnft5ek,1586916009.0,so do you think 61c + 170 is feasible? considering i haven’t taken upper divs yet
berkeley,fnf76qg,t1_fnf2cuy,1586902664.0,"yea i wasn’t sure about the workload of those classes, so thanks for clearing that up."
berkeley,fnbylrt,t1_fn7mkrh,1586824930.0,do you by any chance remember his name?
berkeley,fn8ojdt,t1_fn7tr08,1586746356.0,LOL yes 😂i was listening to pluto projector while i was making my account
berkeley,fmv3nwc,t3_fxg5r5,1586405274.0,"dedifntely look into those clubs^ also programs like the fung fellowship would be of interest to you. There’s also a design certificate you can get, I think it’s offered through Jacobs."
berkeley,fmayene,t1_fmay7ei,1585912661.0,no problem!!
