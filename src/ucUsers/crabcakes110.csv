SeattleWA,fpk3epa,t3_gd48o3,1588687189.0,whenever things return back to normal (or near normal) you might want to consider looking for people with similar interests in a meet up group (meetup.com and facebook groups are good for this) If you went to college in the USA then check and see if there is an alumni group in Seattle (just google it) is also a way to make new friends and meet new people

maryland,fnkv72b,t3_g26sqc,1587040803.0,In my opinion Maryland is overrated by many that live here- Baltimore is a troubled city with huge problems with safety and corrupt political leadership and the rest of the state (for the most part) is bland suburbia (and expensive as well with mediocre weather)- people are different and like different things so you may like it here more than where you currently reside -To me it is a very mediocre place but if you are from CT then you may find it an improvement. My advice is that if you have good jobs and your wife likes it where you are then it is probably better to stay where you are.
