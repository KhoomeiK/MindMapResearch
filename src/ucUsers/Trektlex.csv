csMajors,forijal,t3_g951j3,1588012821.0,"Okay for a nester for loops you’re gonna want to draw it out and since it’s intro to java I’m pretty sure your professors haven’t introduced you into a debugger. To explain it simply, keep track of both your index’s. The way nester loops is the loop on the inside will loop once completely and the outer loop will increment by one and repeat. Write down the output from each index of each loop. Not sure if this helped but good luck!"

UCSD,fn8a5gs,t3_fzljj6,1586737153.0,"Broooooo!!!!!!! The Journey down from Revelle to Warren is heavenly. It’s so fun during peak hours!!! You have to be ready to sacrifice yourself just in case you might hit people tho, better to jump off and land in a ditch than hit someone else.  It’ll probably take a month or two to feel really comfortable during normal hours but probably an extra month or two to be able to really skate during peak hours. You have to be able to turn quickly since people tend to take 90 degree turns out of nowhere, bikers, hills, etc... the worst part is those damn pebbles and cracks :,( rip to all three yerba’s that died to the hand of a pebble. The Area with the BioMed library has smooth pavement and a soothing set of small hills. I used to use a Penny nickel but then I bought a LandYacht Dinghy, best decision I have ever made. It’s super fun, you’ll probably wear out the bottom of your shoes really quickly, good luck!"
