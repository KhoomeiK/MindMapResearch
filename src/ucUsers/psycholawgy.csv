One unhealthy yet effective method is leaving hw from the night before, so that’ll freak me out enough to get up, knowing that it’s due in like 2 hrs (I don’t recommend this though LOL, it’s pretty chaotic/not sustainable)

On days I don’t have class it’s especially difficult to get out of bed and be productive, so I set up study dates/meet-ups with friends—they hold me accountable because I’ll think about them waiting for me, and that’ll make me jump out of bed. Obviously I can’t do this all the time, but it def does help.

I really love this post bc I’ve been thinking about this/struggling all quarter. Idk if this helped, but I’m so curious to know what other people do too!"
