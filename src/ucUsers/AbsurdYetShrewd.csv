You should watch the news more so you your biased view is expanded.

Edit:

Downvoted for forcing people to self-critique their party? Get off your high horses, hypocrites. Speaking over an invited guess is not protesting:


https://www.google.com/search?q=university+of+arizona+border+patrol&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS736US736&oq=university+of+arizona+border&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0l3j69i60.10033j1j4&hl=en-US&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8

u/dtorre, you can not call the above a protest when those agents were invited guests. Yup, because students of a Criminal Justice Club, including students of color, inviting a couple of border patrol agents to speak is totally “bigotry.” Shame on that club for being “racist” and “bigoted.” Seems like you’re just a hypocritical bigot yourself.

There’s loads more stories like this one, too, and with huge crowds literally preventing speakers and guests from entering rooms. Mob mentality is totally what Trump supporters, and only them, are great at. Downvote me for proving you wrong, sure.

2nd edit:

u/Xaoch9Qu, can you point out the hate the speakers said in the link i provided? What kind of hate are you talking about, because in the story i linked, seems like the hate and bigotry is not coming from the invited speakers.

u/DaGiantPanda, even when i provide them with evidence, they continue to live in their denial and delusion that only Trump supporters demonstrate mob mentality. What hypocrites these hate-filled bigots are."
