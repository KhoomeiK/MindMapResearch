because i'm transferring next semester i'm hoping they will let me defer

i have had experience with online classes but the classes i have right now DO NOT suit a distance ed format at all. and  now i'm stuck at home learning how to sew and use this really expensive software that i should normally be doing in my school's lab. also helps that my mental health is absolutely shot.

idk, we're almost done with this semester at least?"
