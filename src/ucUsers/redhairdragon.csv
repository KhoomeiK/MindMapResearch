And I think as an engineering student, you have fewer GE to fulfill and need to take more CS classes. I don't think being a LING&CS student will have more advantages than being a CS major even your focus is on NLP.  
For those activities you mention, you can go to them in most cases. But the department will only email engineering/CS students.  
Engineering school has its own commencement, too. And to be honest, CS major is harder to get in and it sounds cooler as an engineer.  
I would say that I will prefer to be a CS major than Ling&CS in any case if your interest is CS-related stuff."

Yesterday I went to CVS. Someone after me was coughing. People asked him if he was Okay.

He said, ""Yes, I just came out of the hospital.""

I checked the cashier and the people around him. No one was wearing the mask except my roommate and myself.

Then I went to Ralph's. In order to control the density of the people inside, they made us wait in a line outside. The line itself was pretty crowded. No one was following 6 feet distance rule.

Now I read this news. I feel it is definitely not exaggerating at all. A lot of people don't realize how serious it is."
