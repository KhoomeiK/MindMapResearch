UCSD,fphlsyo,t3_gd4z4g,1588623536.0,LTWR 119 writing for performance. I took it with Profa Banales and it was by far my favorite course at UCSD. As a writer I had never done anything like performing my own work and I was afraid when I first started the class. As the class went on I gained more confidence and I performed my piece with one of my friends. It was incredible :D I would recommend it to anyone who is a literature/writing major if it gets taught again.
Wechat,fpc6sfw,t3_ff8mwu,1588489517.0,Hi can I get help for verification?
UCSD,fpc6a2g,t3_gclyhh,1588489024.0,I’ve been taking LTEN 181 and it’s super easy as DEI course with Professor Suzuki
UCSD,fp35grq,t3_gakp64,1588273418.0,Responded! :)
UCSD,fp34ttz,t3_garycm,1588273100.0,"I’m a literature writing major and I would most definitely pick UCSD again. I probably would change how I started my first quarter as a transfer student because I didn’t know they had literature writing at first. I was a literatures in English major at first and that was boring to me. I was glad I switched in the second quarter to the writing when I found out it was an option! Plus overall despite the current situation I made some friends who I would like to say are lifelong, had a great first job experience and liked the scenery. I’m graduating this quarter and I can say if you want to join the literature department I highly recommend it at UCSD. The professors I’ve had are amazing, kind and understanding. They’ve taught me a lot. I even participated in the honors thesis and I feel like I gained a lot of experience from working closing with one of my favorite professors on my creative project."
UCSD,fozzav8,t1_fozsadn,1588199560.0,Great! I hope you can have a fun celebration! Stay safe :)
UCSD,fozbxkw,t3_g9v9x6,1588188085.0,I moved out on 3/20 and I still haven’t gotten it. I got an email from them saying mine is in the last two steps and it should take another week or two depending on how long it takes. I’m not sure though because that was last week. Hopefully it comes sometime this week. :( I hope you get yours soon too.
UCSD,fozbju9,t3_g9bzn3,1588187905.0,I used to have spectrum for years. I hated it. I hated it when I had it but kept it because it was the best deal. I switched to T-mobile Internet last year around October because they contacted me for testing it for free for a few months. It was great. I’ve only had it disconnect on me a few times not often. It’s a good deal to me since spectrum was charging me much more. It just depends if they provide Internet in your area because I forget if T-Mobile is still isn’t full coverage for everywhere. Hopefully you can fix it or find another provider that works for you!
UCSD,fozayyj,t1_fovjshs,1588187628.0,"I dunno about other colleges but I know ERC is selling stoles (they said in an email) and you could probably buy a black gown on eBay, I don’t know about the tassel though. D: sorry though I know it sucks, I don’t even know if I want to do a celebration myself for graduation anymore."
UCSD,fozaogp,t3_g9fjfq,1588187488.0,"I’m pretty sure that they’re postponing it because I asked for a refund and got it. Since I mentioned I probably wouldn’t be in California if it did get delay until later this year, which I feel like that’s what the response was leaning more towards for postponement"
UCSD,fosxdje,t1_foswsxc,1588040033.0,Yeah I feel like that is true because I haven’t really heard of anyone who has failed that class. Here’s too hoping we can just pass and move on hahaha
UCSD,fosvym4,t1_fosvfcz,1588039177.0,"I’m already taking it pass no pass. It’s just that even though I know I’m doing well on the other assignments I don’t know if she’ll change the grading or something, or make things harder again. I just want to be able to pass it hahah since it’s my last graduation requirement for literature to have a language requirement."
UCSD,fosuyo9,t1_fosraqz,1588038583.0,:( oh no! I hope you did pass it though! I feel the same way. It’s been really tough. Especially since everyone I knew is so far away now.
UCSD,fosuux0,t1_fosui5s,1588038521.0,:( yeah it really did increase. I hope you did well though! Maybe she’ll change it to be less words next time hopefully or let it be not timed.
UCSD,fosu9o9,t1_fostpcw,1588038176.0,Yes I am
UCSD,fos7ess,t1_fos79de,1588025322.0,"I don’t think that’s normal, I would say contact enrollment."
UCSD,forkqq4,t1_foriu0p,1588013874.0,"Thanks :) I feel the same way though honestly. I wish the professors would be more lenient considering a lot of them say they are stressed too but it could be they don’t know how to deal with it either, or at least that’s what I’d like to think. I hope you do well as well despite everything going on :)"
UCSD,foqzljg,t1_foqzf0p,1588003600.0,Thanks :) I appreciate it hahaha. It was mainly rough because of the test I took a little while ago. I hope you do well too!
UCSD,foqwxs4,t3_g8ub9x,1588002275.0,I filled it out! :)
UCSD,foeqgbr,t1_foeq9by,1587711307.0,I would say give billing services a call to see what you’re supposed to do in this case. I would say call as soon as it opens and they should be able to help. If you get financial aid I would say call them as well. I don’t think their charging late fees but that may just be for housing so I would say double check. Hopefully they can help you out :(
UCSD,foeq4m0,t3_g6zrca,1587711012.0,I would say only for the fees and tuition to pay for because housing (if you canceled your contract) already said don’t pay for it. They sent out an email saying if you haven’t gotten your refund it should be 1-2 weeks until the last steps are done since it’s in cashiers office now.
UCSD,fnzduep,t1_fnypxk1,1587392091.0,"They basically just told me around 4-5 weeks after your move out date, so it’s pretty subjective. So depending on when you moved out it could be after 24th. It’s already been a month since I moved out. If it’s just your housing charges and not tuition that you would have on your billing statement then they should drop you. I would recommend trying to email financial aid and housing when it’s 8AM to see if they have any info. But from what I’m assuming is that as long as your billing statement doesn’t say you owe any tuition you should be fine. Since they said no one who moved out has to pay for housing."
UCSD,fnl30lz,t1_fnk6nif,1587045955.0,"Yes this is exactly it. Depending on the plan you have a certain amount. If you go over it per quarter then they’ll charge you for the overage since housing and dining normally per quarter is charged together. 

Below is the break down that they have... 

$1700 total dining plan/spring allowance is $555
$3400 total dining plan/spring allowance is $1109
$5100 total dining plan/spring allowance is $1664"
UCSD,fnaod8d,t1_fnao2d2,1586800972.0,"I wouldn’t know in particular because I haven’t gotten the first refund, I just know they said the remaining balance of dining dollars would be after. It might be a little later by a few days. I would suggest contacting housing or card services about it. I’m not sure if they’re doing everyone’s first refund or if they’re doing both at once."
UCSD,fnanh1n,t1_fn9ozx3,1586800531.0,Update I filled out the help form on card services website and they can tell you. Don’t contact HDH email but the card services website where you add triton cash :)
UCSD,fn9cjev,t1_fn9c6vm,1586767652.0,I’m glad I could help! Feel free to ask me more just in case I know the answer or have it in my emails with them :)
UCSD,fn98vn5,t1_fn98tgv,1586763604.0,If you had more than the spring allowance you’ll get that back just as a separate refund from the regular first refund.

Also when I asked HDH about previous balance they told me they couldn’t get the information because something about card services, I didn’t end up asking if I could speak to card services so you try that."

UCSD,fmsrilj,t3_fx30cp,1586360848.0,"They updated my aid for spring quarter, so I added up all the current aid. I subtracted my tuition and fees. They gave me my normal disbursement and subtracted that. Then I got what I was left with but I’m still not sure if it right."
UCSD,fmrjxz8,t3_fwxkf3,1586325505.0,They’re doing people’s housing one by one on case by case basis so it’s going to be (last I heard 2-3 weeks) and somewhere in there you should get refunded for it :) I’m still waiting to but it’s just going to be a little longer. Hope you get it soon!
UCSD,fmpniqx,t1_fmmup84,1586283989.0,Out of curiosity when did you move out from the village?
UCSD,fmnbdwc,t3_fw7kav,1586222254.0,Hahaha for sure and I feel stressed about it. I’m taking a language class and our normal homework that had only one exercise went to like 6 for one homework assignment and it’s only ten points more. On top of that we have three new weekly homework assignments. :( I just hope she keeps it open book for all of the tests and the final cause she said she’s testing it right now.
UCSD,fmmfhgb,t3_fvrv52,1586204315.0,"I personally use an iPad Pro the smaller one and notability with the Apple Pencil, it’s one of the better note taking and tablet systems I used. I like the Apple  pencil because it moves very smooth. The pressure is good. But I would say any iPad that supports the Apple Pencil plus notability is a good option. I’ve tried android tablets and I didn’t like them as much because the stylus I can use on an android tablet didn’t work as well."
