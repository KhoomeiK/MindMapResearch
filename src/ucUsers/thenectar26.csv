CAguns,fnpirat,t3_g35xm7,1587146216.0,How is everyone making post about getting thier handguns in less than 30 days. I thought handguns in CA are a 30 day waiting period

UCI,fnjung5,t3_g1yc1g,1587007391.0,"You get a stimulus check if you are declared an independent, over the age of 18, made under 99K, & if you filed taxes. Regardless of anything about college, financial aid, ect. PERIOD. If you dont fall under any of these then you dont get one. All the funny stuff you just listed out Finacial aid about automatically being labeled a dependent is not true what so ever, as you tell them you are independent in the section where they ask you. 

So go to the IRS website and fix your shit before the deadline. Remember this is not free money. Nothing here in this fucked up country is free. This is a advanced (upfront) tax refund from 2020, dont be surprised if you need to pay taxes next your cause you ""received"" to much money.

Edit: if your gunna RANT, dont rant stupid made up shit."

CSULB,fmjepjt,t3_fv3qbx,1586128824.0,"We All did the same thing you guys are trying to at UCI and they pretty much told usin email, ""no we will not give a refund because while you are not using those services, the fund for said services are being reallocated to help with or anything to do with remote learning. Thank you for understanding"" which made it a BIG fuck you to all of us. So get ready to rebuttal that bullshit they'll try to feed you."
