entj,fo8pgwx,t1_fo8ng3a,1587601178.0,"What you described sounds a lot like us, honestly. We had a huge struggle while adapting to the social distancing as my need of “feeling loved/cared for” required wanting him expressing it.. and that led to calls/texts and words of affirmation. I’m not proud of that need honestly and I see a lot may come from insecurities but I have no doubt I’m working on my part and I can see he is working on his also. 

“I’m also super physical so maybe the virtual love doesn’t work for me” — you’re spot on here. I didn’t realize this could maybe be something in common between my bf and I. And I think me comparing the intimacy between other couples who can just send nudes or do phone sex just took part in this insecurity because doing that just isn’t my nature."
entj,fo8lrvj,t1_fo8l5to,1587599055.0,"Through the distance, how did you keep this intimacy alive? Did you both stick to that 1-2 a week you would see each other for intimacy? Or did you eventually adapt to try and bring this intimacy to the phone? 
Lots of questions but reading that really does relate a lot to my bf and I’d just really like to understand better."
entj,fo8k3yu,t1_fo8iz3e,1587598111.0,Not living together. I dropped off food for him once while he had a busy class day this past month if that counts but didn’t get to really spend time with each other.

davidgoggins,fnx4ztt,t1_fnx441y,1587331586.0,Will do. Do you use a specific earbud/earpod? What bothers me sometimes is just the hassle of my phone and wired EarPods sometimes when I’m trying  keep focused when moving around.
davidgoggins,fnx30vw,t1_fnwyqk9,1587330485.0,I don’t have any right now but your post motivated me to get up and “have that opportunity to run today” but I wasn’t sure how I should start? I was wondering if  I should start off keeping track of how far or long I run? Like 1 mile? go to a track or run out in the streets?

infj,fnapb6s,t1_fn9y3fv,1586801440.0,This. My comment is somewhat similar to your view.
infj,fn9f8ym,t3_g0bn5n,1586770693.0,"Hey, INFJ here. Thank you for your perspective .. I see myself in position of your friend often .. I do have many times where I will disregard texts or give very short straight to the point responses. 

Reflecting now, I see my reason for doing so is just having limits to what I invest energy, emotions and personal life in. For example, I will want to talk about deep things, but just not all the time. Having to talk “deep” all the time can be emotionally draining and .. since we are private, most of the time we just want our lives and intentions to be kept private because not all the time we are understood for why we do things, which leads to a lot of explaining .. following by being drained.  

Most of the time with friendships, we are not only looking for understanding and seriousness to our “hidden sides” .. but we are looking for a friendship where we can be ourselves in all aspects (being weird, learning something new, gaining new ideas, taking on a challenge, growth, etc). It may seem that you come to her to be understood about your serious sides and perhaps that may come off to her as draining because then she feels as if she has to give the same back, but instead has set her limits."
entj,fn8g4ir,t1_fiesx27,1586740879.0,How did you take initiative to resolve things to get things back together again? Are you both still together now?
infj,fn0w3bd,t1_fn0aguu,1586549883.0,"• start doing (like a robot, shut off thoughts, work mechanically) 
• remember it’s okay to make mistakes (rough draft doesn’t have to be perfect) 
• instead of focusing on end result, focus on each step of the process of being better
• celebrate small steps 
• won’t see results now, will appear in the long run 

had to break it down for myself to look back at. Thank you"
