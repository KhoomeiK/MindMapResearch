What I did was talk to the math department (Math-CS major) and planned out my classes for the next 2 years-3years. I am able to finish all my major requisites in 2years, however after planning I saw that I would have to finish my GEs fall quarter 2021, and possibly Winter 2022. I still need to talk to my Warren Advising counselor, however after messaging them, they said before you fill out forms to graduate (2nd year as a transfer), you can fill out something to extend your stay at SD, only if they approve it. But after planning at a quarter plan, they most likely will with enough reason."

I got two emails, the one that said it'll take up to 5 weeks, and then another email telling me my refund balance and it processing within 72hours. A day after I got the 2nd email I got my refund."

He's graduating this year and his roommate is still staying. I know some of my roommates are getting a house to rent over the summer and may look for roommates, not entirely sure yet."
