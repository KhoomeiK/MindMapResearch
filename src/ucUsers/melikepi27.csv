hypixel,fovp2v5,t3_g926op,1588105079.0,"All I can say is it should even out eventually, but thats pretty damn unlucky. For bedwars, try playing doubles with a friend who’s decent. There are sweaty parties in doubles but lots of new players play doubles too. Not solo queueing GREATLY increases your chances of winning (in any game mode)"
hypixel,fovoewl,t3_g9l87p,1588104752.0,When ur autogg mod has too high of a delay and u start a new game really fast
hypixel,foos321,t3_g85bcu,1587945273.0,"Get mvp+, mvp barely adds anything to vip+. Plus you get map selector which is really cool

Also, with mvp+, you can get mvp++ at any time which is honestly really worth it. Being able to host private games for your friends is so fun."
hypixel,foojq79,t1_foo8xcn,1587940327.0,A lot more people would play if there were zero cheaters. I remember seeing as low as 60 people playing when it was really bad. I’d say there’s half as many cheaters now (don’t play too much so I could be wrong) but there are 200 people playing rn.
hypixel,fokn3ot,t1_fokmrn0,1587845168.0,"I’m obviously a little salty but he was like 10 stars and didn’t rush anyone the whole game, just camped the diamond gen and his base. Obviously has no game sense lol"
hypixel,fokml1h,t3_g7d8dx,1587844887.0,Ya /duel has been buggy recently. Haven’t had problems with the other thing tho
hypixel,fokmfy1,t3_g7lhcf,1587844811.0,Bruh yesterday I almost clutched a game after losing my bed immediately but the last idiot fireballed me and my pearl got me stuck in a block. Please remove fireballs hypixel

hypixel,foeiacm,t1_foea7w2,1587704493.0,Ya that’s just toxic
hypixel,foei3wq,t1_foebtf4,1587704358.0,It just means get destroyed lol
hypixel,foei351,t1_foeaw30,1587704342.0,"I mean that’s kinda just strategy, but it’s still annoying"
hypixel,foe4n4h,t1_fodxo6c,1587695937.0,"Yeah this is my biggest pet peeve on hypixel. I’m definitely very toxic sometimes in bridge, but I rarely leave.

If you get railed, just accept it and let ur opponent get their 5 goals lol"
UCSantaBarbara,fo7y20u,t1_fo7vy1l,1587586508.0,"Oh ok, that’s reassuring"
UCSantaBarbara,fo7u181,t3_g66vyf,1587584537.0,It’s the exact same in physics 106 (you may be talking about that class but idk). It’s so stupid because I’m sure we wouldn’t be assigned the extra lectures if we had in person class

hypixel,fno6unh,t3_g2r2jq,1587114284.0,"It might be because they’re placing blocks and lagging you back, combined with ur ping being high

Minecraft,fnghzxk,t3_g1f5j8,1586932847.0,When I realized this was on console I got wayyyy more impressed. That was amazing dude
hypixel,fnfwx1g,t3_g1ivx1,1586917216.0,"I don’t think that’s true, but I could be wrong

Right now it’s easier than ever to get network xp, just do the 15 daily challenges and that’s over 150k 

Also do the quests in your favorite games for a bit more"

hypixel,fn7z7su,t3_fythkz,1586730614.0,"Yeah if I get on an exploitable map I just leave lol. And I agree with you on the respawn time, it shouldn’t take 6 or 12 seconds when it takes 5 seconds to run to another teams wither"

hypixel,fmxv5ar,t1_fmxupcv,1586472483.0,"Whoaaa no way! I’m barely top 5000 but I never really played until December 

You’ve probably destroyed me a few times then lol"
hypixel,fmxl6si,t1_fmxjrxn,1586467061.0,"I main solo bedwars as well so ik what ur talking about, but the bridge is still faster overall. However I do go against sweaty bois quite often so bedwars is more fun

And I was able to do 30 challenges so fast because I did 15 at the end of one day and 15 at the beginning of the next"
hypixel,fmxfmns,t3_fxyq5v,1586464089.0,"An easier quest is knocking a player into the void in the bridge

shittymcsuggestions,fmv00ps,t1_fmux5tw,1586402765.0,"Maybe I should have commented that I actually don’t think this lol but I thought it would be against the spirit of the sub.

I think almost all of the stuff in the update is great, but you have to admit my point still somewhat stands. They should add a more dangerous mob to the nether to make it more dangerous than, say, the end"
Minecraft,fmuhgkj,t1_fmucec1,1586391490.0,I think that would be too overpowered. Maybe it should give you slow falling or a few seconds of levitation instead
Minecraft,fmucbgg,t1_fmubivo,1586388607.0,"That’s a good point. Right now, the end is FAR more dangerous than the nether. There are no passive mobs, and there’s no potion of void resistance. Not even your netherite stuff will survive that."

Even his dizastamusic channel is still gaining subs. As long as his videos/channel don’t get deleted, people will sub when they discover his channel. There’s nobody like frank and there never will be again. He’ll reach 10m in a few years"
