More info on Wikipedia

On 6 March night, Hanoi urgently announced a new case of coronavirus, the first one found in the capital of Vietnam. The patient (case #17), a 26-year-old woman, had been traveling across Europe during the outbreak. She had been exhibiting several symptoms, but didn't notify the authorities about her travel history or health conditions.[45] Within the night, the government proceeded to track and isolate roughly 200 people who either had close contact, lived on the same street, or had been on the same flight as patient #17.[46][47] The incident also sparked a wave of stockpiling purchases across the city.[48]

On 7 March afternoon, a 27-year-old Vietnamese was diagnosed with COVID-19 and moved into quarantine in Ninh Bình Province for treatment, making this the 18th case. This patient had previously been in Daegu for several days in February and, prior to testing positive, had already been quarantined - along with all passengers on the same flight from South Korea - since he re-entered Vietnam.[49] Just 2 hours later, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health confirmed 2 more cases in Hanoi, both related to the 17th case.[50] The same day, Hanoi city expanded the scope of contact tracing to F5 and raised the quarantine procedures by one level, meaning F1 to be quarantined in hospitals and treated the same as a patient case, F2-F3 to be moved into central quarantine, and F4-F5 to self-quarantine at home, with temperature checked twice per day.[50]

On 8 March, another case in Hanoi was announced, which was a 61-year-old man.[51] Later this day, 9 more cases was announced, with 4 cases in Quảng Ninh, 2 cases in Lào Cai, 2 cases in Đà Nẵng and 1 case in Thừa Thiên - Huế. All ten cases were foreigners tracked from the same flight into Vietnam with case #17.[52]

On 9 March evening, a 49-year-old British man was tested positive and put into quarantine in Quảng Nam Province, previously on the same flight with patient number 17.[53]

On 10 March, a 24-year-old Vietnamese woman who had just returned from England and previously had close contact with case #17 while in London, tested positive. She had flown back to Vietnam in a private jet with quarantined cabin - after becoming aware that case #17 was infected - in order to seek healthcare in her home country.[54] Later that day, another British man was found infected with the virus, who was on the same flight with case #17
