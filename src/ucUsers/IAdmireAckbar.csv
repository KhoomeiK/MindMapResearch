Make a double tiki drink on me for your birthday week, hahaha"
UCSD,fnrre56,t3_g39jb7,1587198705.0,"Graduated several years ago, and not particularly “wholesome,” but I’ll never forget this one moment that was just so stereotypically funny, I honestly have a hard time still believing it happened. 

So I was a Poli Sci major, and I ended up taking this one class about politics and media, probably in my Sophomore year. It was in the Poli Sci building near RIMAC in one of those conference room classes, so like 15-30 students in this long room, all around this long table in the middle, and the professor sitting at the end with a white board and projector behind him. The class was mostly about discussions around readings, not just straight lecturing, and was one of those 3ish hours, once a week classes, so the setting fit.

So it’s a few weeks into class and we’re talking about how mass printing was changing politics in Europe, and the professor poses an open question: what is the most impactful technology that has emerged during our lifetimes? Some stereotypical answers come up as we go around the table, like social media, cell phones, live streaming, etc. And then it comes to this one guy, who was fairly quiet in classes and mostly just took notes instead of participating... until this day. 

There’s no proper way to do this justice over type, but I’ll try. In the most dramatic and ridiculous way, this guy says, 

“WIFI! Is the most IMPORTANT thing to have happened. EVER! In the HISTORY! Of my lifetime...” 

Everyone is dead silent for a few beats, cause no one can believe that this quiet guy is just so damn jazzed about wifi. (I mean, he wasn’t wrong, it was a good point, but holy hell, was this guy stoked on WiFi) 

Until the professor responds, “Well... then I really hope you lose your virginity soon.” 

I’m sure it would’ve been quiet for longer, but I only made it about half a beat before I completely cracked up laughing. The rest of the room followed as the guy sneaked half smile to try playing it off, but you could tell he was feeling that 3rd degree burn you only feel when a mid-50’s professor calls you out like that. 

We had a break midway through class to eat a snack and go to the restroom, but when we all came back, the guy was gone. He never came to another class again. That was the day I realized what kind of power a tenured professor had in their class."
