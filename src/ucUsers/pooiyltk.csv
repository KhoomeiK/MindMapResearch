pokemongo,fov6gkd,t3_g7n4ma,1588096155.0,The pokeball plus hasn't worked for me since the last update. Niantic says they know about it and a fix will be coming soon but for now there's not much you can do.

nintendo,fokc1tj,t3_g7vuf0,1587839266.0,I am looking forward to spending some real life time with my friends and family. My friends from high school all went to college out of state and it kills me that their all back in town and I can't meet up with them and catch up. Once quarantine is over the first thing we're gonna do is get some tacos and play some 2k. As for my family well my niece's birthday party was canceled because of quarantine so we're definetely going to have to celebrate that. One of my cousins was doing study abroad in Switzerland and I want to hear all about it. We've also watched the first three seasons of Rick and Morty together and I've been waiting to see him so I can watch what's out of the forth. I could obviously call these people but there's nothing quite like hanging out and catching up with the people you love.

AskReddit,fnyidk4,t3_g4a8g7,1587364017.0,"I used to work at an all you can eat pizza place and one of our big sellers was parties. Well a family is waiting for line to get seated for their party. There's a gate in between where you wait for the party and the general eating area. Out of nowhere this lady jumps over the gate and starts punching another lady. She then ran into the kitchen, grabbed a knife, and chased the other lady around the restaurant. She ended up stabbing her and the bleeding lady ended up hiding out in out walk in fridge. Turns out the lady that got stabbed has cheated with the stabbed ex. It was a fun little night."
UCI,fngnqrz,t1_fnghcqr,1586938360.0,The units from AP tests and cc classes only don't count towards the limit if you took them before you applied to UCI as a freshman. I was over the unit cap because of this and almost didnt get into CS. The only reason I got in was because I had already taken a couple of upper division courses and the counselor pulled some strings for me.
UCI,fn3t61k,t1_fn3rezx,1586627418.0,Since it's just a single D you should be fine as long as you make up some half decent reason for it.
UCI,fn3r9ml,t3_fzagsy,1586626374.0,If it were to be rescinded you could petition to get back in as long as you had some sort of reasoning for getting a D.
thisisus,fmjzdsz,t3_fvkdch,1586140900.0,He's in Marshall as someone that's supposed to be a criminal. It was the first time I saw him outside of This is Us and where I truly began to appreciate how good he is as an actor.
