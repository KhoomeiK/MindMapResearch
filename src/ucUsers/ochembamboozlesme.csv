UCSD,fozhpk3,t3_gafi2r,1588190843.0,"honestly having taken 43a in the summer (ss1) with Weizmann. I would NOT do it again. I regretted taking it in the summer where it was much harder, WAYYY too fast,and that final was hard as fuck(43% average) so I guess u can try to take it or get it; but maybe see it as a blessing lol.

I saw how ppl didn’t really struggle with it during the school year but man o man Weizmann was so disorganized and he uploaded templates for reports like a day or two before. idk who is teaching it but just avoid Weizman"
EngineeringStudents,foq32om,t1_fopyl72,1587981210.0,"because my college is cracking down on it, and now chegg is releasing those who viewed stuff and now there could be an answer... even tho I never saw one turned the timed quiz"
EngineeringStudents,fopo8bg,t1_fopmrbl,1587966958.0,"do u think I’m ok? My prof showed someone posted a quiz question of his. I looked up a different (Muiltiple choice) question but it didn’t even have any answers. And now I’m scared. I didn’t post it, but I looked at it fuckkk. Never using chegg again holy moly"
UCSD,fopntmb,t1_fopnc5e,1587966611.0,"Was it online hw or paper hw? I could understand for paper hw where ur work is shown but this seems kinda ridiculous considering the means he’s putting on y’all. An essay for physics sounds LAUGHABLE TBH LOL, sir we are still in a pandemic"
UCSD,fopn2f7,t3_g8tadq,1587965986.0,"I LOVE BURG, man deserves the prof of my entire college experience. I’ve taken this class among others with him. STUDY THE NOTES like ur life depends on it, that’s honestly all u need to do well. Keep rereading and studying because he tells u everything u need in notes. Also his exams are ppppp easy and he has no tricks ( ours were mc) he’s kinda all over the place as a lecturer and like jumps all around in the slides but trust that as long u know the info you’ll do well."
BostonU,foplzy9,t3_g8u7kn,1587965109.0,fuck I’m scared I looked at a question. But it didn’t even have an answer but I feel like ima get caught for looking (not at bu) but no longer utilizing chegg omfg
EngineeringStudents,fopl7vt,t3_g8tvyq,1587964485.0,"Have u talked to anyone that viewed your post, did they get caught as well? Chegg really be slipping up, even if it’s just looking up hw practice problems... I looked at something but it didn’t even have an answer so I wonder if they could potentially catch me for looking at something without an answer...."
UCSD,fohkqzz,t1_fohkaya,1587767593.0,I’m taking it pass/no pass! Like there ain’t no way I’m getting an a with her no curving/dropping/ idek how I’m doing relative/ 100% exam grade 😢 I think the drop deadline is Today!
UCSD,fohgb6m,t3_g7hch1,1587765492.0,"I feel like her exams don’t fully really represent lectures this quarter, like I feel like I’m remembering a shit ton of info only to get confused by her vague wording. and we still only get 50 min ://

I studied by annotating all slides and doing the problem set but I guess that’s not enough 🤷🏻‍♀️ I might take a look at the textbook since this midterm gonna cover a shit ton of material 😢"
UCSD,foeskub,t1_foe79fy,1587713322.0,"So as a fellow biochem major, I got b+ in ochem a and b! (Only because my professors definitely curve LMAO) And an a in 40c!

So imo ochem is MUCH easier once u do practice practice problems!!! The first 7-8 weeks of 40a is complete bs imo and I never ever used it again but pay attention to the four reactions sn1/sn2/e1/e2 reactions because these will come up later and ur expected to remember regardless if the prof in later courses goes over it. Ochem is HARD but it’s doable imo. GET THE TXTBOOK, I say skim read the chapter, it’s aight for clarification but don’t waste ur time. Do the in chapter and end of chapter excercises! ALL OF THEM forward, AND backward! Many reactions (i don’t think you’ve really learned much since it’s the beginning tho) are reversible and at different rates too! Also go “look” for master organic chemistry study summary sheets. Great summaries and I mean I’m not taking the mcat but it details every reaction you will ever need to know! Idk who ur ochem prof was but if it was indeed hoeger do his hw and assigned problems PLS AND get there solutions manual to check answers ! He scares u but they’ll be massive curves! Also as a rant pls don’t feel like ur a failure because of this! I fell in to a depressive episode because of events one quarter and dropped out of every class except one. I took a w in calculus because failed the midterm but I retook with a different prof next quarter and copped an a+  and now I’m graduating cum laude :) I literally wanted to die that quarter and was In such a bad mental state but help is always there!!!! GOOD LUCK ❤️"
UCSD,fnre2lv,t3_g3e5bj,1587186210.0,":( it’s okay, I think they autodrop u already and it’s just waiting to update

I literally turned in 5 assignments for a class and wasted so much time too, it sucks that they can’t increase enrollment because in person I’m sure more ppl would’ve dropped :/"
UCSD,fnpwy7j,t1_fnpw7g9,1587153504.0,"Do 100 first and then 102. 100 is much easier and 102 will slightly build a bit on it. 

100 is basic structure drawing, 102 is A LOT of much harder structure drawings and remembering"
UCSD,fnmlm2f,t3_g2n0hl,1587073652.0,"Bibc 102 with Hampton has the hardest final I have ever taken in my entire life 😩 I’m just warning ya, schmelz is a bad prof but I think he has easier exams. Hampton is funny asf but erm his final was like a billion questions and it’s notorious. I still ended up with an a but had to make a 60-70 pg single spaced study guide lol"
UCSD,fnmkybe,t3_g2o43x,1587073305.0,"10/10 recommend. Got my iPad at the beginning of last quarter and ended up with a 4.0 taking ochem, cellbio and physics. I regret not getting it earlier. I only paid $300for the 7th gen and it was the best decision! Just know it won’t replace a laptop though and it doesn’t work the best for online school because u cant multitask with zoom/notes app on the screen. ITS AMAZING FOR OCHEM, it’s okkkk for upper div bio classes but what I don’t like is I I can’t see all the slides at once and that’s something that’s hard to do on good notes app :/ also my back pain decreased since I didn’t need to hold a shit ton of notebooks and it’s much lighter than a laptop

-I’m a biochem major btw! :)) it’s 279 for the iPad on Walmart rn!!!!! Do ur self a favor and buy it :))"
UCSD,fnm895a,t3_g2luxu,1587066814.0,"Yo Bimm 134 in the summer with burg is p easy, easiest a! But bicd 110 is a BIG PAIN, I say split it up 2 sessions if u wanna do ur best. I say one upper div bio and 1 easy class, at MAX. It’s tough in that you’ll literally be taking midterm weekly/biweekly"
UCSD,fnjukzq,t3_g271xt,1587007345.0,"hmmm after taking both, 9 units in a SS Is a lot! and seeing how physics lab is going online... rn ; I say split it in 2 dif sessions. they both aren’t hard but you’ll be sacrificing ur ability to do as well if u jumble them all in one sesh! Summer sesh is VERY fast imo!"
UCSD,fnius1y,t1_fnitri1,1586986727.0,"lmao ur saying uve never been late to class? thing s come up, u snooze alarms. It happens, just because you were never late, doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen"
UCSD,fng9gah,t1_fng8eb4,1586925683.0,"I missed (1) class due to not waking up on time but it takes me nearly 1:00 hr commute to get to school on time. I would never take an 8am but Muir writing is hell to get based on my enrollment times. She told me that I would essentially get an F if I missed one more/tardy more than 10 minutes. What op and i is saying is that, cmon we are all college students; things come up, emergencies happen, and it’s crazy for a class to be SO strict on attendance policies like this, it’s not accommodating ESPECIALLY for those overseas in dif time zones and in a global pandemic, imagine waking up at 2am to go to Muir writing LMAO"
UCSD,fnfidlp,t3_g1frsd,1586908627.0,"mine gave 2-3 a’s! she threatened me and was like u have to drop the class if u are late/don’t come in one more time. I made sure to go to EVERY office hour thereafter and made her believe I actually  cared about Latin American movies LOL, and wrote a bullshitted paper. I feel like Muir writing is suuuuper easy to get a b but u have to go miles above to reach that a point, like pester tf outta them and keep asking what u can improve"
UCSD,fnfdp52,t3_g1frsd,1586906101.0,"I almost got an f because I slept in for one class, it was an 8am section (I’m a commuter) but I passed with an a so take that @muir ta"
UCSD,fnemoht,t1_fnedbik,1586892099.0,how do u think the exam itself went? It sucks we can drop a midterm :/
UCSD,fne8q0a,t1_fne870t,1586885027.0,yeah I understand... it’s like critical thinking which I’m okay with but I just think that it was very deceiving that the last question was like that or the least they could do is tell us the last question was rlly long/time consuming in advance. A lot of the problems needed more context and that’s probably why me (and probs everyone else) had to ask for clarity and wait a while to get a response and eat up at our exam time :/
UCSD,fne7pd2,t1_fnd5l7b,1586884518.0,"For you, will be harder. My year was the last year they started letting into bio majors without proper screening/requirements. If uve already taken the prerequisites to transfer then I say go for it! It’s capped but for pharm school don’t choose a chemistry major unless u wanna take the 20 series (yikes) , harder physics when it’s already hard, p chem series, inorganic series and organic series. The major name is p deceiving because it doesn’t even match up with pharm requirements at all!"
UCSD,fncfe3l,t3_g0vwxn,1586835418.0,"Pharmacological chem is so unnecessary to go to Skaggs imo! It doesn’t even fulfill MANY requirements for Pharm school! I came in as that major but quickly switched to biochem/bio, ur gpa will suffer as a chem major as opposed to a bio major. If ur planning to go to Skaggs where the average gpa is 3.7, don’t risk it!
Also bild 1/2 was by FAR harder than 3 and 4 

I got a in 1, a+ in 2, a in 3 and a- in 4 (only because I did it in summer lol)"
UCSD,fn8kdy5,t3_g067ps,1586743642.0,Hmmm tbh honestly lowkey I feel like yeah it’s p time consuming (taking 19 units) but I might drop and take it in the summer; I got a 100 on the first quiz but I just don’t like the format of quizzes every week imo and like if u can’t do it es then so it now but if u already have enough units I say pass on it
UCSD,flwqpnw,t1_flwp8tn,1585561325.0,yeah! I have a credit union so I have always gotten it at least an e-mail by now/already deposited! I hope it’s soon though especially since a lot of people are prob unemployed now :(
