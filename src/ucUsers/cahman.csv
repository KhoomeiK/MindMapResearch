mountandblade,fmirogx,t1_fmir0fr,1586115543.0,"I'm not sure what you mean with a contract of some sort -- if you're saying that the employees agreed to work for years without pay until the game started selling, I can tell you now that that's not the case.

Also, on TaleWorld's website they only have Mount and Blade products listed. And you definitely can't sell an engine to other game companies until you've even completed it for your own game. And either way, there's no information indicating any of that."
