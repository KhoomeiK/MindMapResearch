apexlegends,fpl3ouc,t1_fpl3iz9,1588705807.0,Should but won't.  Wraith heirloom is still the same after all this time. And our inspect button just makes us observe the kunai the same way we inspect any other gun
CoronavirusOC,fpkppqs,t1_fpj38xp,1588698889.0,I feel so sad reading those comments. I don't understand how people could be so ignorant to the danger
CoronavirusOC,fphlyv4,t3_gdiva6,1588623618.0,"Definitely not. 

Somewhat unrelated, but I was originally thinking that if the order was eventually lifted, I would be fine with going back to dining in at restaurants, as long as they still maintain cleanliness, safety, and social distancing. I know that's an unpopular and selfish opinion here. But looking at that one restaurant that opened up against the order? Guess that's not possible to do. People can't control themselves"
Wellthatsucks,fpfumu0,t1_fpfety6,1588584128.0,"Last time I saw it posted ,people said this place was very popular with tiktok because people would frequently buy these bait cups and record their reactions to ""discovering"" that their large drink cup is actually just a tiny one with a misleading size. People who buy the drinks in person are informed that drinks can be ordered in either ""size"" so they aren't being tricked"

UCI,fp3rnqn,t1_fp3o4da,1588284560.0,"> I’m paying these professors to teach me, and they have the easiest job in the world. They don’t teach, canvas grades everything for them, you ask questions and instead of answering they sit back and tell you to think about it and then give you a basic answer that isn’t even close to an exam level explanation.

So basically exactly like his physical office hours. Sato never changes. He always responds to questions with a question of his own that leaves people confused and angry for even trying. I'm so sorry that's happening to you."

Have Spectrum currently. Overpaying for it because I have yet to cancel and rejoin. Current plans look really good but the one plan I am in kinda sucks for the price.

During early lockdown, internet was spotty at night but it's been flawless in the past week. Overall, they've got good customer support."

The bad one is 3001 Bristol st E.

It's really weird. If you look at the map, they are both on the same street, maybe like 3 blocks apart. If it is in the same shopping center as a TJ Maxx, Ross, and (formerly) Toys R Us, that's the good one"
