Also I'm pretty sure the vacancies are only for the rest of spring quarter the seats will get filled by the people who won the election in fall."
UCI,fo9ir9w,t1_fo9ean7,1587620696.0,The current freshman senator had their term expire after fall 2020. They were appointed by the FtC people and are a republican.
UCI,fo9etk5,t1_fo8wfdv,1587617563.0,Happy cake day!
UCI,fnkh1sd,t1_fnkgskf,1587026757.0,Yeah basically that's what it seemed like. It was Kimo's explanation for the impeachment being used against him. Someone posted a link to the zoom trial thing earlier on the sub. I'm not sure if it was recorded and you could still watch it. I saw it there. I saw that controversy too tho lol. Then they got into their real larp mode and said that since the real government uses so help me God they can too even though we're a public school lmao. I've read the Constitution and I'm glad it requires unanimous consent to impeach her and they can't get that.
UCI,fnkfw02,t1_fnjqdlj,1587025510.0,They're like trying to impeach the Elections Commissioner too. They had a trial thing today. He brought up the whole thing about how can they say that for one meeting if not for another. Kimo got pretty worked up about it because he wrote that memo lol.

This is a helpful guide written earlier.

You want to avoid Anteaters for Anteaters and Fund the Clubs! They're both associated with recalled Senators who have been part of the problem and corruption in ASUCI!"

This post did a good job explaining things!

Basically advise to avoid the Fund the Clubs Slate and the Anteaters for Anteaters Slate."
UCI,fnbzagj,t1_fnbwqvm,1586825331.0,"Yeah man and you're on a slate with what? Six currently recalled senators? u/TopTamale2 may have been recalled, but she's done a great job fighting for effective change. The people on YOUR slate Fund the Clubs are part of the problem and have way more anger from the student body. When six people on your slate have been recalled that's a problem."
UCI,fnbyyrx,t1_fnb7exx,1586825140.0,"Yes! Others who have stood up to the corruption include the Senators Iqbal whose on the Reignite Change Slate as well as Fonseca and Mallari who are on the Anteaters Untied Slate. Senator Math is also up for election, but he's not on a slate and has done a good job of representing students."
