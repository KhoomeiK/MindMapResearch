malefashionadvice,fphuskd,t1_fphs56x,1588628193.0,"😪😪😪😪😪 Its actually crazy how condescending you are about how many different ways you can suck romney’s dick. But go ahead I’m not gonna stop you. 

Your first point is clearly not what the article said, because they delineate theres two buckets of investments that Bain made, and they made 77 significant investments—that figure doesnt specify PE, and tbh it doesn’t matter anyways. 

Your second point about pension funds and stuff means absolutely nothing, because people always love to tout this when the fact of the matter is that overwhelming winners of these types of things are the people involved. Whatever exposure pension funds and endowments had to Bain is so miniscule compared to the ultra wealthy. How the fuck do you think Mitt Romney has literally hundreds of millions of dollars? 

Your third point may be the most retarded thing I’ve seen you say thus far. The specific anecdote cited in the article is that Bain employed “creative destruction” on four companies, but instead of turning the company around completely, instead took out more debt on the company’s success and paid out the loan money as dividends, ultimately causing the company to go bankrupt. Forced bankruptcy is not a “natural evolution”, and it’s certainly not making it better in the long run if it literally causing premature bankruptcy and dissolution.

Youre fucking delusional. The level of condescension you have about finance is laughable. Kinda ironic considering id bet my entire net worth on that you cant explain something like Black-Scholes mathematically while grandstanding as a super knowledgeable finance god. Youre probably getting paid okay at some shitty firm, but youre never going to be as rich as Mitt Romney even though you jump through all the hoops in the world to justify his actions.

malefashionadvice,fphnccw,t1_fphkp1m,1588624319.0,"Whatever point youre trying to make about M&A is lost on me. A person in PE probably knows more about the PE side than an investment banker.

Whatever bain capital is doing now isn’t what it did when Mitt Romney founded it. Thats the whole reason why he deservedly got so much hate when he ran for president. Im still waiting for that story... and you explicitly called me out on that, so you must know about some net socially good thing Romney did that I don’t. Please elaborate.

I never said that I understood the whole of finance, and I’m quite frankly surprised that you would say that. I’ve repeatedly said that I don’t have the qualifications, but things I’m saying come from qualified people. Additionally, it’s not hard to recite a distilled message without knowing all the intricacies of a system, and it’s bizarre you’d think otherwise, especially in finance since money is ubiquitous rather than specialized. Consider the statement “CRISPR can be used to eventually cure down syndrome”, analogous to “mitt romney made his money off of socially irresponsible PE”. I have no understanding of how CRISPR works, but an expert could’ve told me that and it’s easy to understand a high-level warrant of that fact, namely “down syndrome is caused by anomalies in DNA”. A similar high-level explanation about debt and Romney’s PE strategy can be made. It’s really quite odd that you dismiss a statement like this as “tabloid”, citing naivety. It’s certainly doable to explain the opposite, and as I said before, I’ve been waiting for an alternative explanation, framed as a cost/benefit analysis in terms of social good, for years now. You called me ignorant—what’s the secret knowledge that you have?"
malefashionadvice,fphja5h,t1_fphgapq,1588622264.0,">I was more getting at the fact that your family's knowledge doesn't translate to yours. To put it bluntly, your comment about Bain and Romney demonstrated a very rudimentary and naive understanding of how the industry works.

I'm very aware, which is why I ""cited"" my comment saying I'm only reiterating what they've told me. It's really not that hard to remember and reiterate the big picture of things, and ""very rudimentary and naive understanding"" is a pessimistic way of framing a statement that was originally meant to be a big-picture critique that again, is not hard to remember and recite... And it's also not like the barrier to entry for understanding the big picture of some parts of the financial world is as high as say trying to understand some biology or math PHD's research. 

Also, PE is considerably more tied to PE than investment banking. So I'd tend to trust someone who is in PE rather than some dude in IB, who I don't even know if they work at a relevant firm, that dismisses potential critiques by calling them ""tabloid"" and ""rudimentary"" without elucidating as to why. Please tell me your alternative version as to how Mitt Romney made hundreds of millions of dollars, framed in terms of cost/benefit of social good, because I've been waiting to hear a convincing reframing of his story for years now. It's like you shut off your brain from all potential criticism when you saw the words ""capital greed"" and ""socially valuable"", as do a large portion of the financial workers seem to do"

2. Obviously harvard students get jobs... no one gives a fuck if you go to UofT, and again if you think theres some sort of magical prestige attached to the name to the level of harvard or ivies thatll get you a job youre just delusional

3. Refer to the quote above and Also idk why you keep bringing up ml submission counts 

4. Again literally no one cares that u of t students have taken calc 3 in high school. Literally no one and its not relevant

5. no one disagrees that you can go to top grad schools from UofT. My comment was about faculty exchange between universities in recent years. In particular since you seem so cavalier about taking down UW when looking at where UW grad students go and cse hires come from youll find the phenomenon i highlighted above

Also, somewhat out of order: 

1. waterloo isnt toronto, and engineers from there perform well because of the coop program; 

2. The discussion is obviously centered around cs since you said specifically that UofT’s cs department is arguably equivalent and this is a post about some kid trying to get into a school for compsci. i dont disagree about uw’s other areas bringing down overall reputation, and dont know why you assumed otherwise in a computer science discussion; 

3. No one cares if you finished math 324 in high school for computer science (or math), and that’s not even uncommon because of rising start kids; 

4. UofT does have a particularly strong AI/ML department, but none of what you say precludes any of the US schools mentioned as ranking higher—you act as if UofT produces more r&d leaders/best papers/etc. than others, which it doesnt. Additionally, If you look at grad students and professorships, faculty and grad students shuffle around from cmu, cal, stanford, uw, mit, uiuc, cornell, ucsd, gatech, etc. and the same isn’t as true for toronto. Finally, this doesnt even particularly matter for undergrad unless you want a phd which the op specifically doesnt seem to care for much since they want to be a swe at msft;

5. Your argument about canadians staying in canada doesnt make any sense because companies on linkedin dont have separate pages per region, and waterloo routinely shows up on the lists but toronto doesnt. Additionally, schools like stanford and mit also show up so private schools dont bias the data as much as you think, and it isnt even relevant anyways since UofT is a big school like UW...?

6. I have no idea what point youre trying to prove about rank because you never seem to elucidate it, but whatever it is probably isn’t what you originally said, which is that UofT is at the same level as other top institutions in the US, which simply isnt true

And yes you are being disingenuous to yourself if you think otherwise. Id do a lot to go to MIT or stanford instead of UW, and if you asked UofT cs students i am quite confident an overwhelming majority would say the same thing"

udub,fnxey7z,t1_fnwqu9q,1587337240.0,">UofT CS is any less prestigious than UW CS - certainly it would not be seen as lesser than any other top tier American school to tech companies

you shouldn't be disingenuous. UofT is probably like top 20. UW is probably like top 10 or top 8 ish. Additionally, UW is definitely seen as lesser, at least for undergrad, than stanford/cal/mit/cmu (so UofT would be as well). all you have to do is look at the numbers for people hired from where on big tech's linkedin pages. you'll find a definitive hierarchy."

for me personally i'd go to penn because it's an ivy and is strong across most disciplines. you can't say the same about cmu

and fyi, people say cmu is top four in CS. and that's true, but for grad school. i don't go to CMU so someone from CMU should speak on this further but Ivies, at least reputationally, seem to focus quite a bit on undergrad education which you can't say for every school (like state schools, and plausibly cmu though someone from there should comment on it)."
