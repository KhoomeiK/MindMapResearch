Autoflowers,foui5z3,t1_fouf58t,1588084507.0,"I’m a first Time grower as well, so I might be wrong. But my sprout was droopy like that too eventually it died. For me it was because I didn’t slowly introduce it to direct sunlight. I just left it in direct sunlight for 6 hours instead of allowing some time for shade. Sprouts generally should be slowly introduced to direct sunlight. Maybe try giving it 1 hour of shade, then 1 hour of sun, and keep switching like that. It could also be overwatering. I have been misting my sprouts as I’ve read watering the soil too much can drown the plant and cause it to suffocate.

Autoflowers,fo8n8h1,t3_g68ybh,1587599897.0,"its my first grow I am using 1/3 Fox Farms happy frog 2/3 FF Ocean Forrest. I layered it like a cake, bottom 2/3 are the FFOC since it does have nutrients in it that might be too hot for a seedling, the top 1/3 is FFHF it's really conducive to seedlings. I mixed both separately with 30% perlite. I germinated directly in the soil and used half of a plastic bottle to cover the seed. I kept it in a cardboard box with towels to insulate it and put it in the bathroom for extra humidity from my household showers haha,  the seed sprouted in exactly 3 days. Don't overthink it, be creative, and trust the process :) good luck"
