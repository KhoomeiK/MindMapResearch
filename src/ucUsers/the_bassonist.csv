UCSantaBarbara,fozle2h,t3_gad7tb,1588192608.0,I came into ucsb a 250 pound fat man and I gained the freshman 15 quite quickly. Currently I weigh 230 and I'm still  going down despite the rona. Honestly UCSB is a great place to start becoming fit and lose weight. Bike everywhere and spend some time at the rec cen.

UCSantaBarbara,fo5bqmk,t1_fo5aubz,1587521882.0,"You must be new to all this huh. There are very little accountants and financiers who's starting salary is as high as an actuary. Additionally I stated that there not many options not that there are no options. Finance, econ etc. are great non-stem majors that have above decent starting salaries. A quick look using pay scale shows you that you are just wrong when it comes to pay and I shall no longer dignify your response."
UCSantaBarbara,fo2d43a,t3_g4ztrf,1587457841.0,Not many options between not wanting stem and high paying jobs. Your friend is going to face a large uphill battle as a comms major if they want a decent job.
