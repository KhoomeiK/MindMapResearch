UCI,forab8o,t3_g8xz5u,1588008848.0,"Roommate/landlord off-campus had this condo bought for him by his mommy (they had matching cars). I would not have cared so much if he didn't constantly talk about being a ""counselor and life coach"" when really all he did was skype with his buddies and talk about how hard it was not to do coke anymore while treating the condo like crap. His annoying little chihuahua shit in my room the day I moved in, he never fixed the half bathroom downstairs, all he ate were frozen pizzas/casseroles that he'd put mountains of cheese on and he'd leave shredded cheese all over the counter. He would leave passive aggressive notes on a whiteboard in the kitchen that blamed me and the other roommate about keeping the kitchen clean when his dishes and cheese were everywhere. When he wasn't on Skype with his junkie friends, he was blasting shitty music in his room and every time he opened his room door you'd get a blast of old, rotten food smell from all the dirty dishes he left in there. The common room carpets were stained because he was disgusting and dirty (I actually had a carpet cleaner come steam the carpet in my room and the carpet cleaner, when finished, warned me that my landlord/roommate was a piece of work, to be careful with him, and wished me good luck). 

&#x200B;

To top it all off, one of his junkie friends stole my Shun knife when they came over. Luckily, I was only there for one quarter and was able to secure on-campus housing with much better roommates."

From the Texas Tribune: 

> The Texas Police Chiefs Association has consistently spoken out against marijuana decriminalization.  
  
>  
>""Texas police officers are currently and regularly employing proper discretion and procedural justice to not over-criminalize someone for possession of a personal use amount of marijuana,"" said Steve Dye, who leads the association's committee monitoring marijuana legislation. ""We must understand that modern-day marijuana is much more potent than ever before due to the increased THC levels, which has now made it a very addicting and damaging drug.""  


If you want the name of at least one organization (though they aren't elected by the public) actively against even the idea of *decriminalization,* there ya go."

Churchgoers stayed in their cars, listening to the same sermon (or whatever you'd like to call it) and did not actually gather inside the church which summoned a few Christians to the thread who then aired their persecution complexes. 

Btw, if you thought the name of the church was ridiculous, you might want to check out their horribly tacky website."

I love to walk everywhere - you notice so much more than when you‚Äôre in the car (and obvi paying attention to the road). My place in Southtown or my friend‚Äôs place right off broadway by the Pearl are always great starting points if you want to walk/bike places. You‚Äôre near all the museums, river walk is close, lots of events constantly, food is decent (could use more authentic asian food specifically SE asian, but that‚Äôs just me...I‚Äôve learned to cook a lot more stuff since moving here simple because my craving can‚Äôt be sated by what is available and convenient here). 

San Antonio doesn‚Äôt have that big city feel despite being a big city, but if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after, downtownish‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is the closest you‚Äôll get."
