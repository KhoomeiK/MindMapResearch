Cal was my dream school through out all of high school, and LA was never a school I really looked at. After being accepted into both, I looked more into Cal through admit events and admit weekend, but I just didn’t click with it. My feelings were strongly swayed towards LA BECAUSE of Berkeley’s admit weekend.

1. Safety: During my stay through admit weekend, I felt extremely unsafe during the day and the night time. On my first night there, I went to a boba shop and left FIVE MINUTES before a shooting happened at that same location. If I had left five minutes later, I may not be here to type this post today. Berkeley’s response to safety hazards seemed to be extremely nonchalant, and though there was a SHOOTING literally no one cared or was notified. On the other hand, though LA has it’s faults, it does at least moderately concern itself with student safety, and you can request walking escorts or rides from the campus police. Though I’m still wary about walking around at night, I feel much safer walking alone at night at UCLA than I do in a group during the day in Berkeley.

2. Cleanliness/Living Conditions: Dorms at Berkeley were extremely cramped, even compared to LA. The walls of the dorm I stayed in were straight up cement. Like parking garage cement. And apparently that’s one of the “better” buildings. The streets of Berkeley are lined with trash, and I even stepped in HUMAN PISS. Not cute. UCLA seems to just be cleaner and even Hedrick Hall (where I lived this year) which is supposedly the worst hall, was miles better than Berkeley’s “best”.

3. Food: the food at berkeley was not that diverse, and there weren’t many ethnic foods. There wasn’t a good variety of nutritious or even good food. I felt greasy and sick after eating in their dining halls. UCLA has a good variety of foods and just has great food in general (#1 dining! :)) I can proudly say that I haven’t gained any weight during my freshman year at LA, and I don’t even gym haha. There’s a good variety of italian, Mediterranean, asian, healthy, and hispanic foods :)

4. Housing: I know LA Housing is kind of hell, but think of Berkeley’s as the lowest level of hell. Dorms are cramped and also good luck getting one! Housing apparently isn’t even guaranteed for your first year, and by your second you’re expected to move out of the dorms. A lot of Cal students told me about paying more than $1000/MONTH to share a 2 bedroom apartment with like, I’m not even exaggerating, 7 other students. I spoke with a student that was super thrilled that she was able to sleep ON THE COUCH in such an apartment for “only” $850/month. They told me about how students would live in apartment past humanitarian guidelines on the minimum amount of space per person. They also told me that if the landlord know that more than a certain amount of people were living in the apartment, they’d all be evicted, so they had to work out leaving schedules Anne Frank style to avoid suspicion. Not my cup of tea.

5. Student/Academic Atmosphere: This was probably the most important factor for me.  Study rooms at Berkeley reflect the student atmosphere. The rooms I saw were white all around, with chairs facing a wall, all in the same direction, asylum-like. Their study spaces reflected individualism and the “every person for themselves” attitude that the students I met expressed. Cal students told me about how group work or group studying wasn’t really a thing at Cal, and no one shared their notes or helped each other out. I heard about people tearing pages out of the school’s textbooks or deleting group study guides on google docs after copying it to try to sabotage other competitors. That overly vicious and overly competitive atmosphere was NOT something that I felt like I could learn in. Don’t get me wrong; I LOVE competition, but I draw the line at cutting other throats to push myself ahead. LA’s study spaces are more communal and conducive to collaboration and group effort. Spaces are comfortable with couches and nice lighting, and are designed to allow you to work with a group or work alone, whichever you preferred. 
LA students seemed really nice and welcoming compared to Cal students, but that may just be my perception. Also this may be objective, but LA is kind of known for having the best looking people and Cal for the worst. Just something to consider ;)"
