ucr,fp8jeve,t3_gbpp1n,1588393873.0,This is my exact situation. Its hard to tell myself it's gonna get better when everything seems is getting worse
TooAfraidToAsk,fougjo7,t3_g9ikqr,1588083656.0,"I'm on similar terms. I'm graduating next year but don't even know if I like my major. I've gotten several pieces of advice, and what has helped the most is to just go out there and test things out. I've solely been focused on academics and getting good grades (which I realized is not wise) but what matters is getting into the field and getting my hands dirty to know if I see myself doing that for the rest of my life. It's a progress. I'm 22. I'm surrounded by people who know exactly what they're gonna do after they graduate and my parents expect me to do the same. Even if it's against the grain to take my time, it's worth investing time to figuring out what work environment works best for me."
CasualConversation,foue8uw,t1_fotmi16,1588082379.0,You're right. Moderation is the issue. And probably more difficult to teach. My older brother would spend 12 hours everyday playing Warcraft and my dad was one of those who breaks computers. Wouldn't want to see the same with the younger.
