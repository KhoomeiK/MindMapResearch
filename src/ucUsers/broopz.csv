I miss labs & working with partners. Physics labs online are DRY AF, and lab for EE120B is way more tedious/difficult w/o in-person instruction to help. 

I miss the small things too— watching people in lecture play video games /watch shows/lurk on ig, wasting my money on sugary coffee, hearing bong bong bong every hour .. I miss the independence of living away from home (strict asian parents LOL)

Most of all I just miss interacting with people— friends, classmates, cashiers, teachers... I’m too extroverted for this shit LMAO"
