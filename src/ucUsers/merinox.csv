AskReddit,fpa84bt,t1_fpa6lua,1588442736.0,"Ultimately, yeah. I feel for the children born into these circumstances, and think it’s a terrible idea to get pregnant simply to fulfill one’s desire for life purpose. 

The better solution, imo, would be for these young women to dig deep down and ask themselves why they think it’s a good idea to bring a person into the world simply to fulfill their own (as you say) selfish desires. Starting with sitting down and evaluating the costs and benefits of the decision to become a parent at a logical level. Most of them likely don’t realize, or care, how significantly they will impact their child’s life by bringing them up without the proper resources or financial stability—they just want to make their own lives “meaningful” by becoming a parent. 

So, yeah, I agree with you. The action is rooted in selfishness. And it is unfortunate that some will choose to alter the life of another person (their child) so drastically by bringing them into an ill-equipped household, financially or otherwise. I guess what I’m saying is that, while I don’t excuse the behavior, and think it is very selfish, I can at least rationalize it."
AskReddit,fpa2990,t1_fp9ykr6,1588439344.0,"Yeah, same. My initial thought was ‘wtf’, but I thought about it for a second and tried to understand it from the young woman’s perspective. 

Their logic is that, once they get pregnant, they have a new purpose to put their efforts towards; mothering. What they can’t account for is how hard doing so will be, especially if they’re not in a stable financial situation to start with. 

In their mind, having a child is a means to relieve themselves of the difficult question “What am I?”/“What is my purpose in life?”. Some people don’t have a good idea of what that is, more so if they don’t see themselves succeeding in a “traditional” path (graduating high school, going to college, getting a ‘regular’ job). The answer some of them come to, then, is “I am a mother”/“My purpose in life is to take care of this child I’m carrying”. 

I’m not saying that it’s a good decision. But it’s a decision I can understand, at the least."

Unemployment,fp9v1z4,t3_gc7mb7,1588435152.0,"Hi, I applied in mid March because my employer cut my hours due to COVID and was approved. I certified for benefits for the last two weeks of March, in which I made about $50 a week, and got rejected because I had “excessive wages”. I’m pretty sure my weekly base benefit is closer to $100, so I’m confused about the decision. 

I also haven’t been asked to certify any additional weeks since the first two—is this normal? I’m still working significantly less than I was before my hours got cut. I would’ve thought I’d be asked to certify for weeks in April and now May, but I’m not seeing any option to do that.

My last question has to do with identity verification. I got a letter in the mail a week ago saying I needed to send in proof of identity for my claim, so I did. I’m wondering, could that (an inability to verify my identity on the original claim) be the reason I received the “excessive wages” denial, and why I’m not being asked to certify additional weeks? 

Thank you in advance for your time."

cheatatmathhomework,fnhxec1,t1_fnhktmu,1586970448.0,"Okay, I’ll just give you the answer because that will be more helpful at this point. 

You have area A = 750 and area B = 450.

If you want to make these areas cubes, turning them from 2D to 3D objects, you need to add a height variable, h. When both cubes are h units tall, their total volume will be 30,000 cm^3, which you found earlier.

So h(750+450) = 30,000

Solve for h"

Draw out the bases of both A and B, then figure out the area of each. If you can, think of this area as representing a “slice” of volume, ie, some percentage of the 3-D cube’s volume once you add in height. 

Anyway, you should come up with two numbers, let’s call them C and D.  If you multiply each of those by the final height, h, which we don’t know yet, you’ll get an equation for the final volume of both cubes provided they both have the same height h.

Can you see what to do next with the total volume you found earlier?"
cheatatmathhomework,fnftzjl,t3_g1gegc,1586915425.0,"I’ll disclaim this by saying I’m taking multivar currently and don’t have a fantastic grasp of the subject yet. If anyone else sees corrections that can be made to my approach, please comment. I think I’ve got it right, but I don’t know for sure. 

That said, these are the limits I found:

0 <= z <= 1 - y^2 (I believe the other equation with x would work as well because they both peak at z=1)

-1 <= y < 1

and

-2 <= x <= 2

And here is what I did to find them: 

z = 0

Sub into both of the other equations to get

x^2 = 4 and y^2 = 1

x = +- 2 and y = +- 1

There are your limits for x and y. I believe the graph supports this conclusion, but it’s not strictly necessary to graph things out. 

z has a lower limit of zero because if it were the upper, you’d have no surface really to integrate, just parabolas from the equations containing x and y respectively that go down towards z => -infinity. 

And the upper limit of z will be defined by either parabola, seeing as both peak at z = 1. This is the part I’m not entirely sure is correct, but it’s what I’ve concluded so far. Feel free to correct me. 

With the limits determined, you’d set up your integral like normal, with the order being dzdxdy or dzdydx."

Secondly, you may want to punctuate your dialogue with actions and/or exposition that relate to the plot at hand. Right now, your pacing seems faster than it probably ought to be, and the piece overall could benefit from a bit of “filling out,” so to speak—as long as you fill the space between dialogue with information meaningful to the overall story.
