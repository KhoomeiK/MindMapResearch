berkeley,fphag2j,t1_fph7zic,1588617797.0,"Are there actually any real studies correlating IQ and crime? I bet there are some but they’re likely faulty. If there is a correlation it’s more likely that those with higher IQs are simply less likely to be caught, though I doubt there’s any correlation at all and more likely people of any IQ are capable of committing crime."

I worked as a medic for 6 years and never saw the “stay with me buddy don’t fall asleep” actually happen in real life, even though you see that a lot on TV."

Congratulations and welcome everyone!"

todayilearned,fnw2e6t,t1_fnvs6me,1587310038.0,"I’m not 100% sure about this. [Here’s a study](http://m.jbc.org/content/273/23/14484.long?view=long&pmid=9603962) from the journal of biological chemistry (legit peer reviewed journal) with primary research showing that removal of either leucine or arginine both cause 70 to 90% decreases in mtorc1 signaling, showing that lysine or tyrosine removal decreases it by 30 to 50%, and lastly showing that the mixture of 20 common human amino acids produced the greatest activation of mtorc1, and thus anabolic cell processes. 

It is worth taking into consideration that the study is from 1998 so a bit old but had solid experimental design and was done by a reputable source (Harvard medical school) with no conflicts of interest."
