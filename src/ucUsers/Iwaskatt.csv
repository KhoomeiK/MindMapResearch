He said he was going to kill her but first he was going to kill us.  He had us mixed up with her family. My knees actually went out from under me.  He called several more times and to the other house where we lived.  This was in the time of mansion. Ed Kemp and the zodiac.  To this day I can remeber the feeling that went through me and my mom's face filed with sunburn, blue eyes and fear."

Take one small little taste of any food you are worried about.  Give it a minute or two and see what happens.  I never found out what caused my anaphylaxis.  I'm really cautious at resturants especially!!!  
Make sure someone who is eating with you also knows how to use the epi on you.
Good luck."
