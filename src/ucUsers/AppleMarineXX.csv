Some teams have actually allowed fledgling teams to 'shadow' them in races, having them live with and help out the team whenever possible for the race.

One of the more difficult things a new team would have, I think, is getting the initial funds and manpower to start off. Without an existing physical car to show off to people and potential sponsors, it becomes much harder to get people to sponsor your team, or convince freshmen to choose your vehicle team over others."

Seriously, what the hell am I supposed to do with 91 pen and .46 dispersion in a tier 6 match?"
