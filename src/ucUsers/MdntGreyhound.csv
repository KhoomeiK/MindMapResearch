UCSC,fp8dfqv,t3_gbpvfa,1588389534.0,I agree but how would we go about this? And what about people staying over summer?
UCSC,fp6twtt,t3_gblj43,1588358522.0,Come July rain or shine apocalypse or no I'm moving to off campus Santa Cruz.

UCSC,fp3gkpr,t1_fp3abdk,1588278932.0,Yeah (are you a freshman?) After 9/10 I would say Stevenson is the most international after 9/10 but it is very bio heavy and more Chinese and Korean in population. After stevenson crown Merrill is a good option. Crown is better than Merrill but they are both a lot of very academically focused people (I mean like no parties). Rcc is a very white college and if you have ever been to an American country club it is a lot like that. Porter is artsy so if you'd rather be around art students than engineers it's a good option (my uncle was engineering and lived in porter although it was 25 years ago). Kresge is a communist block as far as I have seen good community if you fit in though. Oaks is just depressing.
UCSC,fp38n90,t3_gb29bn,1588275002.0,Definitely colleges 9 and 10. They have the most international students and the most engineering students. I actually had a CS Indian roommate and he spent most of his time up in C 9/10.
UCSC,fowgsos,t3_g9x8wm,1588119484.0,If money doesn't matter then UCLA if it does UCSC probably the cheaper option. Also we have a less urban campus.
UCSC,fosz7l8,t3_g980ec,1588041158.0,"I was admitted off of waitlist. Idk about likelyhood, but if you do get off here is what happens. You'll receive an email to whatever you put on the original application saying you have 5 days to accept or decline the offer. There will be a link to accept or instructions (I got one email with instructions and another with a link). Then you need to put down a deposit and choose a college. After that your in!"

earrumblersassemble,fomanw8,t3_g83lur,1587883417.0,It's the way the sound bounces around your skull. Wider mouth higher sound for me. If you clench your jaw then do it you can also get a diffrent sound.

UCSC,fnvbf2u,t1_fnuyin3,1587286964.0,"Mate no... if you mean drugs other than weed not really at all (okay maybe shrooms and lsd in Stevenson). And probably no more than any other college. Hard drugs are more kresge and porter (I mean like coke and ecstasy) . For OP here are how most of the colleges break down. Cowell is jocks, stevenson is Jews and normal college kids (as in fit in at any major uc), Crown Merrill is a bit academic oriented. C9 and C10 are both a lot of CS majors and kinda outdoorsy types. Porter and kresge are two different types of art majors. Porter is like artsy in the more modern way. Kresge is a lot of film majors and communists. Rcc is a lot like Stevenson just less Jews. And I know nothing about oaks."
UCSC,fmwzyyv,t3_fxwout,1586456013.0,A switch
UCSC,fm2kmz1,t3_fslcpa,1585699410.0,It will also be hard for finals or if there are midterms the same day.
