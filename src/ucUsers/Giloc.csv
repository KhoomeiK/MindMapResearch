GamingLaptops,fpj23m8,t1_fpixg1p,1588654460.0,So I should be looking for an I7 instead?
SuggestALaptop,fpijf6c,t1_fpihmi7,1588642155.0,\~4.5 or higher is alright.
SuggestALaptop,fpi6378,t1_fpi0y9f,1588634400.0,Do you know where I could purchase the addtional 8GB of ram for upgrading the walmart?
SuggestALaptop,fpi0wr3,t1_fpi02in,1588631492.0,"Ahhh okey makes sense, thank you."
SuggestALaptop,fphy2xt,t1_fphv6vj,1588629941.0,"Why is the processor speed on the walmart one 2.3GHZ while the one from my link 4.0?  I apologize, i'm not super computer savvy when it comes to specs. haha"
SuggestALaptop,fpex2xo,t1_fpevxgx,1588556824.0,Brilliant! Thank you.
SuggestALaptop,fpevco9,t1_fpev24d,1588555745.0,"Awesome, thanks for the insight! :)"
SuggestALaptop,fpeu1ul,t1_fpetnvj,1588554935.0,So the intel one would handle more programs running at once better while the 1660 Ti model would handle more aggressive gaming?
GamingLaptops,fpeoqje,t1_fpen3mf,1588551720.0,Is this essentially the same one you have?

GamingLaptops,fpeoejb,t1_fpen3mf,1588551516.0,">Awesome, thanks for the informative response :)  That basically answered all my concerns."
GamingLaptops,fpejzuq,t1_fpej3y9,1588549024.0,"How is it with running multiple programs at once?  Does it feel sluggish?

Does yours have the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti in it?

You think there is any other difference between the Intel vs AMD?

Are the fans an annoyance, especially when studying?  I've heard people complain about them, but only when playing intensive games."
GamingLaptops,fpeh2tw,t1_fpef84t,1588547414.0,Thanks :D
UCSantaBarbara,fpec8in,t1_fpebe8i,1588544641.0,That’s amazing haha!!
UCSantaBarbara,fpea2md,t3_gcyvek,1588543378.0,"Yea the party scene compared to 5+ years is fairly moderate.  If you live on DP or certain parts of Isla Vista you may experience it more than the average person but with Halloween being shutdown each year and floattopia banned it’s very rare that you’ll see anything crazy.  Deltopia is still kick ass but it only happens once a year. 

 Like the OP said, Ucsb is what you make of it.  If you want to party you can find parties and if you don’t then it’s very easy to avoid them."
SuggestALaptop,fpe02g5,t1_fpdzrfi,1588537671.0,Realistically not a whole lot.  I prefer something lighter but it's not at the top of my list.  And in terms of battery life I typically have my laptop plugged in most of the time so I'm not too concerned with that.
Unemployment,fn09895,t1_fn05u1a,1586537719.0,Ugh.. well best of luck.  Hopefully we will hear some news soon.
Unemployment,fn05idd,t1_fn04yxl,1586535801.0,Ahhh that could be the issue.  Only been working for 6 months full time (fresh out of college).  I contacted the general help line as well as my work HR department and both said that shouldn't be the problem... but I'm not sure at this point lol.
Unemployment,fn0514u,t1_fn02pq2,1586535565.0,"I haven't had to verify my identity.  Just received a letter in the mail of ""notice of unemployment insurance award"" which stated that I had been awarded $0.00.   Which turns out was because my income was reported to be $0.00.   Same thing was reflected through the online portal.  Been trying emails and phone lines all week... ugh."
