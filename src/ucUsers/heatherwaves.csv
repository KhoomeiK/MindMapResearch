it isn't a great idea rn to commit to paying a significant amount of $ that far in the future ; 
my advice would be to just wait it out, see how it plays out in the summer

contrary to popular belief it really isn't that hard to find housing off campus near the school on the 201/202 bus route, whether its finding a cheap $2100 apartment near UTC or paying 2700 for one at costa verde you'll find something even if you're looking the month before school starts (advice from a graduating senior)"

You realistically have 2 options, 
Apply to as many jobs as you can interview like crazy and try to land an offer ASAP 

or 2 ) just move back home and bide your time while still applying 

You can realistically get cheap housing (as little as 500~ish a month if you roommate double) off the off campus housing (and maybe even off lease) if you need to be here for the summer but seriously this is just a shitty situation and you'll just need to make the best of it

First and foremost; if shit stinks everywhere you go check the bottom of your shoe

The CSE department at this school is fucking top notch, great instructors and an INSANE amount of alumni engagement. A ton of kids here get FAANG offers, and companies love when they see UCSD on their resumes

I am a math-cs major too, and to tell you the truth sure yes there are limited class sizes but in my experience you almost always get off the waitlist, and worst case just go and beg the professor to add you to the class and it normally works (of course, this is given you're not a dick about it to them). Most of the time, the department helps out even more by making more sections for a certain class (as well as giving priority enrollment for CSE/ECE/math-cs majors)

Look man, I don't care if you don't like RickO or Gary or just didn't ""vibe"" well with the other CS majors (and to tell you the truth its going to be like that no matter where you go, the industry as a whole ""vibes"" a certain way), they are actually really good fucking professors who genuinely care for their students and are accesible when you need them

It was your first quarter so what, you took CSE 100? 30? 

I will add on that yes, there is a bit of 'cutthroat' competition when it comes to the field and thats just a result of everyone trying to get ahead but in my personal experience the tutors were almost always helpful and when I was grinding out projects in the basement at 2 am people were nothing but nice and genuinely helped you get work done. 

In regards to math, we're a very competitive school in this regard too, i can't count on my hand the number of insanely intelligent people I've met in my math classes and believe me these courses are no joke. This isn't some 'chegg it out"" type of department, if you don't put the effort in you're going to be left behind and thats just life man

2) As a Mexican-American 1st generation college student, I can say I haven't experienced racism at all. Sure it feels ""uncomfortable"" to not be represented in the majority of the population but quite frankly thats just the demographics of universities in general. If anything, I've noticed theres actual more subtle racism towards asian kids here at UCSD. And thats coming from someone who had trump supporting roommates given to me 1st and 2nd year. Sure there are a few bad apples but literally I don't think anyone would ever treat you explicitly like that, in my experience UCSD students are insanely progressive and the DEI req makes it more so 

3) the school is ""socially dead"" in the sense that we're not all partying in the streets but in my experience also (even outside of greek life) theres tons of shit to do, you can hang out with your friends, we're literally a bus ride/short walk away from the beach, we've got PB, Gaslamp, SD has a huge music scene with indie and small bands/artists having good tours literally monthly, and we're in one of the nicest cities in the USA. That being said though the general vibe (and personalities) of the students at UCSD are a lot more low key and just more calm focused on studies. There still is a big rave scene and if you want to get high on the weekends you can too, its a school of 40k students you can't make generalizations like that

4. Your attitude literally putting down your ""peers"" as socially inept just fucking shows what kind of person you are man, like no offense but I don't think people are socially inept. You claim that people don't shower or brush their teeth' but in general thats just the stereotypical computer science nerd meme and there are some kids but in general the people here are pretty chill 

On top of this, your own background there literally shows us why you're so hateful and salty towards this school, ""i was not in any CS club or org, no hackathons, no math related events""
This shit really does matter, when you join clubs and orgs on campus you literally get a sense of community and if it wasn't for the networks  I built at UCSD I wouldn't be sitting on a job offer right now. School isn't just about grades and classes, its about networking
And everyone has hobbies man, sure but you shouldn't say 'don't join clubs cause everyone else does it' 

as someone who generally didn't even like the school here I think that your post is materially misrepresenting the school and we really don't need that negativity around here 

on another note, a ton of students have massive hate boners for UCSD"

You really should've just either, taken the points off and left the bad problem wrong, bs'ed the solution , or have changed it up a bit 
You really could've just cliamed you didn't copy the solution and just happened to have a similar answer (after all theres no way for them to prove that you didn't technically get the answer wrong or right the same way the chegg solution said it) 

Your entire mistake was admitting to it man ; 

Write the appeal letter and hope for the best tbh , you can either double down on how you're sorry and how its jsut homework , agree to take even more strictly proctored exams anything, just try to get that appeal through
