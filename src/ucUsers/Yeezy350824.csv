UCSD,fpdobtp,t1_fpce9an,1588530955.0,Chief…
UCSD,fpdo86m,t3_gbvxr7,1588530899.0,"I agree with all the good advice in this thread. I was in a similar spot as you. Maybe not the clout thing though, because UCSD CS/Engineering is ranked above UCLA. UCSD gave me two friends that I will probably talk to my whole life, I'm talking best men at my wedding, and it's only my second year here. That, and a lot more friends who aren't as close but I can still hang with. UCSD made it a lot easier for me to talk to people, random people, about things at a very high intellectual level. I thought this little anecdote would interest you as it's a bit against of what your notions might be of social life at UCSD. Even if you come in extremely shy, the campus has a way of breaking that down."
UCSD,fpdn72c,t1_fpcclnd,1588530311.0,"Yeah, I didn't really get this dude tbh. This school is *literally* top 20 in *the entire world*. Wanting to transfer (presumably to another top 20) is quite lateral and I believe OP will have similar, or at least not as different as expected, experiences there."
UCSD,fpdmucx,t1_fpbu00t,1588530111.0,By making this comment—you already are better than *all* of the CSE/DS TAs I interact with. I have a seething hatred for one in DSC 80 who goes out of his way to make student's lives horrible.

UCSD,fpcaivy,t1_fpc9ab7,1588493306.0,"Definitely true, one of my teachers is literally just uploading podcasts and it pisses me off to no end."
UCSD,fpc8jcd,t1_fpc6zuc,1588491273.0,"Yeah. I just wish the lectures were HD, so hard to read the board lol"
UCSD,fpbsp28,t1_fpbreyv,1588477747.0,"I see, that makes sense."
UCSD,fpbso77,t1_fpbsfy8,1588477730.0,"Yeah if you're very politically active I can see how you'd be into that, but otherwise it seems just depressing"
UCSD,fpbrdpm,t1_fpbp9ks,1588476822.0,"No. Try it, you'll get the autogenerated email. But it's processed in order received so you should still apply soon."
UCSD,fpbrd39,t1_fpbpi3z,1588476809.0,That sounds horrible. Wonder what happened to the old prof.
UCSD,fpbrajo,t1_fpbpoyj,1588476760.0,"So you were here for your third year, and you'll be at one of those for your fourth year?"
UCSD,fpbr885,t1_fpbpyyd,1588476714.0,"I found the campus overall to just have an oppressive sense about it, that and the constant protests make it seem depressing. Lastly, Berkeley itself is a bad city."
UCSD,fpbp87u,t1_fpbp4ti,1588475306.0,"No, only if you received an email saying so. But it's a possibility they ran out if you haven't been interviewed yet I suppose."
UCSD,fpbp3on,t1_fp6tagi,1588475219.0,Wait what? Was it an error or did they actually restart it?
UCSD,fpboxe3,t1_fpamz34,1588475097.0,"They're pausing awards for now, just FYI."
UCSD,fpborpa,t1_fpbmpoj,1588474984.0,"I've had the exact opposite experience, knowing both of those place as well lol"
UCSD,fpboke0,t3_gcghg8,1588474847.0,"I'm confused, you transferred here and transferred out? How does that work?

Regardless, good luck at your next institution. The CS department here is ranked higher than every UC except Berkeley (which is a very depressing place) and I'm doing some very interesting research here so I'll be here for the next two years."
UCSD,fpboaup,t1_fpbnvua,1588474665.0,"Pretty much exactly what I was going to say. I wouldn't expect a huge, or any difference transferring between different T20s."
UCSD,fp9z2e3,t3_gbqtt3,1588437515.0,">Due to the immense need our student community is experiencing and high volume of form submissions being received we will be **pausing further award determinations** in order to process forms received to date.

Damn."
UCSD,fp9xv2m,t3_gc20ql,1588436812.0,"I have no personal experience with Ciotti but from my knowledge of AI it seems like a randomized measure. Don't be nervous, you can go over the test if you still have access to it to prepare for what you're going to say."
UCSD,fozij0r,t1_foynumb,1588191238.0,"You could be on to something there, I ""forgot"" the ResNet networks. Maybe that'll do something"

UCSD,foxv0gv,t3_ga76v1,1588157223.0,"I have the UCSD app, Zoom, and Canvas installed on my phone. Not sure what the source of these requests could be. I know I saw a lot of these lookups on my laptop with Wireshark when I was on campus, but why is this happening on my phone when I'm 200 miles away from campus?"
UCSD,foxuuxz,t3_ga6hid,1588157074.0,I sleep at 4-8 AM and get up at 5-8 PM.
UCSD,foxakko,t1_fovs430,1588138345.0,Perhaps we should make a group chat or something
UCSD,foxaetd,t1_fov9nyw,1588138218.0,"Would be interested, PM me!"
UCSD,foxa51o,t3_ga0j9i,1588138006.0,Lmao why is everyone ignoring that HDH stopped giving you toilet paper…wtf?
UCSD,fo9adsp,t1_fo93p8m,1587614324.0,Will reach out to both.
UCSD,fo7xnc4,t3_g68eto,1587586307.0,This was probably precipitated by [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/g5x3pq/the_process_we_have_to_go_through_to_take_a/)
UCSD,fo66vca,t1_fo66kk8,1587548752.0,"DSC 30 was the worst quarter of my life, hang in there. I'd assume you'll have the same procedure, I doubt she'd change it between classes."
UCSD,fo66t15,t1_fo66s3s,1587548682.0,That's *a bit* more understandable. Lol
UCSD,fo65lwt,t1_fo643ej,1587547374.0,"Thanks for that form.

I would submit an anonymous complain to the department,

How would one go about this?"
UCSD,fo65jpm,t1_fo65glh,1587547308.0,"Same professor as yours, actually, I just checked. Hasn't she laid out your midterm procedure yet? I would assume you would have to do the same thing."
UCSD,fo653ll,t1_fo64pko,1587546830.0,You'll be pleased to know 80 *is* a better class by virtue of Python. It's just this test procedure is atrocious. What is 30 doing?
UCSD,fo630sy,t1_fo62mau,1587544610.0,I want to too but it would destroy my completion plan smh

aznidentity,fngg2me,t1_fngflb2,1586931123.0,Keep us posted if anything happens.
UCSD,fmy8wl2,t1_fmxkpdh,1586480666.0,"> I was just hoping to make the process go by faster and get my penalty reduced

It probably won't, sorry to say. While I've thankfully never been through it, I known going through AI can be a demoralizing slog, so try to keep your head up. I have almost never seen a case where the school doesn't ""win,"" but don't let it get you too down."
UCSD,fmy8pv9,t1_fmxamlc,1586480548.0,Exactly.
UCSD,fmvtb7n,t3_fxnp2a,1586430095.0,This is me with DSC 80. *At least* 20 hrs/week of work outside of lectures smh
UCSD,fmvt9hg,t3_fxlelu,1586430044.0,"> I was promised mitigated sanctions if I confessed, so I did

Yeah…this is how they got you to confess, bud. Did you really think it'd help? Most legal advice would be to deny everything as long as possible."
UCSD,fmup43d,t1_fmsdale,1586395865.0,It's kinda like those people who say they're going to fail a test but always get an A
