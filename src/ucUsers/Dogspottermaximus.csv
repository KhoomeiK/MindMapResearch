UCSD,fo5x4bb,t1_fo5f64u,1587538583.0,I think this is usually around the time where you would normally get a W. It’s happened to me before. Not sure if week 6 but you’re right.
Jennamarbles,fmidy4g,t3_fv8riq,1586107671.0,What’s sadder is that the person who posted this is a woman. I would love to see a picture of her. The people in that subreddit must all look like babies at 33.
