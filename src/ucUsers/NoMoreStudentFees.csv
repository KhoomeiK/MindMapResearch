ucla,fowa412,t3_g9wyd7,1588115839.0,Is there going to be organized official opposition to the referendum
ucla,fow3q8k,t1_fow3cl4,1588112447.0,Yes but not all students that receive financial aid will feel a net zero impact. Also the financial situation due to covid has changed for A LOT of students. So even more students need financial than before
ucla,fovrnuf,t1_fovn5ty,1588106345.0,"Yes but it doesn’t take away from the point that over 50% of the students are on the blue and gold plan but only 25% of the students get to enjoy the net zero impact. 

Orion’s original statement still holds true. CUB said all students that receive financial aid will feel a net zero impact, which is false."
ucla,fossbpa,t1_fosrw7t,1588037028.0,UCLA is equally at fault. Lighting the campus blue doesn’t do anything. Now not the time to do open gestures and pay yourself on the back. We need action. We need the campus to refund tuition. We need student fees back. We need to change the grading scheme for students. People are struggling. The campus needs to ACT!

ucla,fng53ew,t1_fng26t7,1586922529.0,">It seems you need to private message the USAC IVP Facebook page (for Kimberly Bonifacio) to authenticate yourself as a UCLA student and gain the password to the room. That wasn't true when I checked in on the meeting at \~7PM to make sure the link worked, but it seems to be true now. Apparently there was a spammer and they had to tighten security.

i don't have a facebook :("

ucla,fn87p1x,t3_g077tw,1586735671.0,"I just want to point out this referendum is really vague!

*1. Following the passage of this referendum, the Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) will be committed to providing substantial space for underrepresented campus communities and their affiliated student organizations*

**How will you provide substantial space? So we are paying $45 for ACUCLA to commit to providing space for communities. Politicians always make commitments to get elected. How do we know ASUCLA will provide space. What if they just keep the money, seems like substantial space is just a buzz word with no plans to back it up.**

*2. The CUB fee shall be used for continuous undergraduate ASUCLA programming, for the development and maintenance of a Black Resource Center, and to support the spatial needs of undergraduate students from historically underrepresented communities.*

**How is the black resource center getting developed? What are the exact maintenance fees associated with that project? Sounds like your asking for a black check. How will this money support the spatial needs of communities?**

*3. The CUB fee shall be used to support the development and maintenance of meditation space for undergraduates within ASUCLA.*

**Where’s the meditation going? What about the one on the third floor? How much does the space called. Can this money even support a black resource center and meditation center?**

*4. The CUB fee shall be used to cover the total cost of rent for the Transfer Student Center*

**How much is the rent? Again will all this money be enough? Seems like you guys are asking for a lot without plans to back up your claims?**

Bruins! This referendum is a $45 fee increase and we don’t know what the effect is even going to be. $45 is a lot in a pandemic. People lost their jobs. People don’t have food! This is insane.

ucla,fn25jv7,t3_fypxpl,1586578442.0,"Reddit family We need your help! We understand your frustration with the recent news of student fee increases on the ballot. We were chosen to be the designated opposition representatives for the CUB Referendum. This is a $45 fee increase annually. We will get to debate against the referendum at the USAC debates and get to publish a statement against the referendum on MY.UCLA.

To start efforts off, We have started a petition to show USAC that students do not want fee increases. USAC is voting to formally endorse this referendum this Tuesday. We will be giving public comments in opposition to the referendum and would love to share a really big number of signatures. I would also love if you could join me on Zoom to give public comment. I will post the zoom link once it's released by USAC. HERE is the link to the petition: tinyurl.com/NoMoreStudentFees

Also, we've created a formal Instagram account. Please give us a follow to stay updated as that is where we will be posting regular updates. https://www.instagram.com/no.new.usac.fees/

Lastly, we need help writing opposition statements. If you have any ideas please PM on here or on Instagram and also feel free to post your thoughts down below."
