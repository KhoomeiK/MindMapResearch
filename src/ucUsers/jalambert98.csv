diypedals,fo3cyn7,t3_g5eb6x,1587484766.0,"Current EE student taken all baseline math/physics/programming. Finished introductory electronic circuits, embedded systems, electromagnetic fields/waves, and now starting signals/systems and digital logic design. By this time next year I'll be in advanced analog electronics and digital signal processing. I got a long year ahead."
diypedals,fneyare,t3_g159gy,1586898076.0,Used to have a blues deluxe 410 and did the exact same thing! I miss that amp so much. I traded for an AC30 that I still have a love but the deep fender low end paired with their sparkliest (and prettiests imo) drive section in all their amps still goes unmatched
drugsarebeautiful,fn2nq8g,t1_fn232au,1586595983.0,"Tried 3-MMC for the first time a month ago or so. Was interesting but kinda underwhelming. Felt slightly comparable to rolling but with zero extra love involved (which is skipping out on the BEST part). Also made my heart very hyperactive. I got kinda irritable as it wore off too. It was fun and felt pretty good and all but I certainly don't feel motivated to get any more after that experience. Never heard anyone else's experience on it besides my roommates and I who tried together

Modafanil on the other hand, is something I have not tried, but has definitely peaked my interest"

Santa Cruz has since done the same thing, and I'm so glad to see so many other cities adopting this policy as well. Makes my heart smile ðŸ’•"
Drugs,fmy2vxi,t1_fmxzwr4,1586476959.0,"Found some 12mg tablets for cheap. They don't seem to knock me out any more effectively than a 3-5mg tablet, but the 12mg seems to have a reduced tolerance issue (ie: if you wanna take it every night, a higher dose might be more effective). With the 3mg tablets I have, the effects are noticeably reduced on the 2nd night in a row. And by the 4th night, its virtually nothing. The 12mg does still build a tolerance, but it kinda levels off after 4-5 days and seems to never completely stop working. Though to be fair, I've never tried to take it consistently for much longer than a week"

UCSC,flrdj34,t3_fqnukk,1585418015.0,1 of my classes have opened canvas pages but none of the others. Luckily the others have open piazza pages now. I would email professors. One didn't email us a syllabus until being asked by more than 1 student
