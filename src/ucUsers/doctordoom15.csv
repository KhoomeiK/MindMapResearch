Peter in the show was spot on, the quips were fantastic, exactly what I'd expect from Spidey, and Josh Keaton is just so good that when I read a Spider-Man comic I hear his voice. Anyway, downvote away.

Edit: spelling"

freefolk,fnysyef,t1_fnyik55,1587374483.0,"The difference is the Prequels are bad because the writing is horrible, but lots of Star Wars fans, and particularly Prequel fans like myself, try to look past that. For me, what makes or breaks a movie or tv series is the storytelling, so the plotline, character development, or even just the effort put into the story becauseit shows. Through that lens, the Prequels show the fall of a young Anakin Skywalker as he struggles with the ethics of the ideology he was trained to follow and fails to accept pain and loss, showing a precursor to one of the most beloved stories of all time (OT). S8 disregards essential pieces of the story entirely, throws several characters arcs out the window, undermines a story arc that was built up for a DECADE, is an example of some of the laziest schemes in writing I have ever seen, and not to mention...that's it, that's how they ended the show. 10 years at the forefront of pop culture to end your story with the lowest tier bullshit I've ever seen."
