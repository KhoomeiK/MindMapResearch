Yes, I'm being shitty too"
AmItheAsshole,fpmsrat,t1_fpmsmbe,1588740739.0,I move out of her way and turn off the lights when she asks
AmItheAsshole,fpmnb7i,t1_fpmlbde,1588736910.0,Yeah I know it was extreme. I was just so fed up with her after months of her talking shit. I was tipped over she only laughed after I confronted her about fucking in the living room and didn't wipe down where she left her underwear like I asked her to

I miss walking through bytes omw to class, and seeing familiar faces. I miss grabbing a salad from Emerbees and a drink from Bytes. I miss laying down on the grass when things got too stressful. I miss sitting in lecture with my friends. I miss feeling like I was a part of something"
ucr,fp1mqsn,t3_g9zh63,1588240919.0,It's not too bad especially considering it took them a fuckin pandemic to FINALLY fix the wifi. It's ac speed and averages a 30mbps download speed. Ocassionally it does fail but not nearly as bad as it used to
ucr,fp00syd,t3_gahvvp,1588200355.0,It just opened!! I've been wanting to take it to fulfill my breadth requirement and thought I'd have to wait until next year. Seeing your post made me run to my laptop to register but it conflicts with a class for my major :(

ucr,foi6egd,t3_g7in9k,1587779668.0,"I faced the same decision as you when choosing schools. I had visited both campuses before and like the vibes at ucr more so i ultimately came here. 
I'm a second year CS major and so far I've loved it here. The professors range from meh to great (as is the case with any university). The CS community here is pretty tight because the program is relativley small. I feel like I know a lot of people (in CS/CE)  and recognize most people in the major as familiar faces. Also, its a pretty healthy environment. For the most part, people are kind and willing to help. We have access (or had until COVID hit) to the computer science building and we get to access labs and the ACM room. The ACM (Associiation of Computing Machinery) club has a room in the building dedicated for students and a lot of people study or hang out there so it's a good opportunity to make friends. A lot of CS/CE/EE/Computation Math majors also hang out in our cafe (appropriately names Bytes). I honestly don't remeber it ever being empty. Some of my favorite times include working with friends in the building right before the deadline of a project or during finals week. There's a lot of club involvement too and the hackathons (especially rose hack) are fun to attend. The education is nice and challenging although not as ""prestigious"" as other schools. However, I've heard of a lot of people getting jobs/internships at big-tech names like Microsoft, Google, and Dropbox so the outcome is what you make of it.  Feel free to DM me if you have any further questions!"
ucr,fo2kiad,t3_g4ov09,1587465863.0,"Its a lot better now with the new furniture. Also, last week they upgraded to wifi so its decent now. I think its nice bc it feela like an actual apartmemt and not just like an extension of a dorm (like glen mor does). Plaza is pretty rundown, falkirk is eh, and bannockburn has asbestos. Compared to all that, Id say stonehaven is pretty nice."
ucr,fntlnh8,t3_g3r2gc,1587244143.0,"I love the CS department here at ucr. I feel like its super tight knit. I dont know everyone, but i definitely recognize everyone. We have card access to the cs building which is nice for late studying especially during finals week. Its easy to get involved because there are so many clubs and planning committees for hackathons. The professors (for the most part) are great and care about your learning."

ucr,fntizpf,t3_g0cl60,1587242616.0,"Talk to her! As a girl in cs I was always annoyed by how guys (for the most part) stuck with each other so it was kinda hard to make friends. Even if it doesnt become anything, its still worth trying to be friends :)"
ucr,fnti8rk,t3_g0quqp,1587242185.0,I had a friend that found a paid private parking spot not too far off campus. I think it was by Stonehaven? Not too sure though. Something like that is probably your easiest option.
ucr,fntfhvi,t3_g2w1bh,1587240607.0,Hello :)
ucr,fn5p5kc,t3_fy8o2c,1586671255.0,"East lo! It'l has the best rooms by far.  I had a double and it was both cheaper and more spacious than my friends' triple in pentland. I know the triples in east lo were also pretty big (bigger than doubles). Also, the walls in ai and west lo are cinder block painted over whereas the walls in east lo are nice and dont feel like prison. The air conditoning can also be controlled in east lo because the rooms are new enough to have individual thermostats but too old to be able to limit what temperature theyre set at (which is q blessing when it gets hot). The furniture is also really nice compared to the other dorms and you get a rolling chair! Which beats the sliding chairs (as found in other dorms) because the rooms are carpeted. The bathrooms got redone two or three years ago so theyre much nicer than west lo, ai, and pentland. Also, i think being right next to the market was really nice. Imo, lothian and the market had the best food. Ai always felt a bit rundown to me, and the food was often cold. All the dorms are similar distance away from campus, its pretty small so everything is super close."

ucr,fm3n0gp,t3_fpr7rc,1585729405.0,"CS100 online should be relatively the same difficulty as in-person. The lecture was pretty easy and all our slides were uploaded to the drive. The exams were also pretty easy, just review the slides well and you should be set. Our final was open note because it was online and I got an A. Lutfor is SUPER nice so don't be afraid to reach out for any help/extensions. He genuinely wants you to learn. The graders (I had Andrew and Ryan) were also chill. I know the rshell is normally partner based but I carried my team (I wrote all the rshell code, my partner just did testing) and it's definitely doable. JUST DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. The rshell (assignment 3) made me go without sleep for 48 hours for the first time since a hackathon.
