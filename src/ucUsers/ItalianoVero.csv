actuary,fng1fg9,t3_g1i4r6,1586920082.0,If you want to be an actuary why not just take exam P and FM?
politics,fneodhm,t1_fneoa6w,1586892957.0,He can't be VP since he already served two terms. Unconstitutional yo.
UCSD,fne0d4g,t3_g16pu8,1586880815.0,I feel like structure is really important to not going crazy right now. Spend the first 4-5 hours of the day on school work and make that a habit.
FinancialCareers,fn91oue,t3_g0cmov,1586756535.0,You do stuff with $.
UCSD,fn5oobk,t3_fznqfd,1586670828.0,Decent microphones too.
PoliticalDiscussion,fn5lceb,t1_fn5l2ov,1586668021.0,If he ran in 2024 he would be almost 83 when inaugurated.
actuary,fn48njy,t3_fzends,1586636304.0,"People who make $100k think they'll be happy if they're making $300k. People making $1 million think they'll be happy if they're making $10 million. Koch brothers are multibillionaires and still the only thing they care about at the expense of everything else is making more $.

You should probably find something you like doing for 20 years rather than focus on minor differences in salary. It will never be enough."
UCSD,fn3sadc,t3_fyx6ss,1586626933.0,To be fair they probably had contracts and people they needed to pay already set up by the time this all happened. So for summer and fall if this is still going on I don't think they will charge the full amount.
UCSD,fn231vj,t3_fyv2io,1586576526.0,You get banished to the shadow realm.
UCSD,fmxgzwi,t3_fxvh19,1586464815.0,Do you think all the same classes will be offered or will some get cancelled?
UCSD,fmn4n62,t3_fw7kav,1586218115.0,What kind of classes? Math and Econ classes seem basically the same as last quarter so far.
UCSD,fm7z0na,t3_ftk8r1,1585839620.0,It's never even clever. Not that that would make it it better but it just shows they aren't the brightest bunch.
