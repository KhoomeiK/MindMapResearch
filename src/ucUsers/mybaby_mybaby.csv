civic,fo9ogya,t3_g6i2d0,1587625729.0,"I was just driving back home from the mountains when suddenly these three lights popped up one by one. I had a friend check it out, we cleaned the sensor, reset the battery (unplugged and plugged it back), and it went away for a bit, only to come back on. I've also noticed that sometimes my car would sorta act like it has asthma and ""hyperventilate"" and prevent me from getting past 40mph when I try to accelerate fast-- but if I accelerate slowly, it's fine, and I can go how fast I want (60, 70mph, etc.). Very unusual behavior."
