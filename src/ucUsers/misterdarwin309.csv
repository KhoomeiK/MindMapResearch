PublicFreakout,fo4hrr4,t1_fo4gq3b,1587504652.0,"Not mass exodus at all,  but something must be done to compensate the Palestinians, what that compensation consists of idk. But for my family- that lived in Palestine- we had a lineage there, then one day men in tanks came and escorted my family from their homes out of Palestine. So yes maybe Israel has 3rd generation people living their now, but they had no problem removing my family that had a history there. The same act the nazis committed to the jews, they then committed to the Palestinian people. Is that not one of the most disgusting immoral actions you’ve ever heard, its frustrating when people don’t recognize this."
PublicFreakout,fo181og,t1_fo0z3sd,1587427647.0,"Sir I’m an atheist I’m not calling for the conquest or killing of anyone, my families land was taken from them by force in Palestine, and just because some mythical book says that jews were there first isn’t a good argument. But your argument “ because it was taken by conquest” make its okay- is a very bad argument. I could then Argue that the Palestinians should nuke the jews and claim back their land, and everything will then be okay, because it was done by conquest- your missing the point of an inhumane action, and thats what I’m speaking of. Taking the land from Palestinians was a morally corrupt action. If you cant admit to that, then I really don’t know what to tell you. Sure the jewish people needed land, why not give them a piece of Germany, a piece of the uk. Plenty of land in the usa. Why palestine which was not theirs to give"
PublicFreakout,fo0rfco,t1_fo0gv7e,1587418375.0,"Because it wasn’t their land for the taking, and this occurred in a relatively recent time. Its so strange the jews had just experienced being evicted from their homes, by the nazis, yet they did the same thing to the Palestinians. Its as if they had no sympathy at all, Its a great injustice in the world. As many things are, yet as a Palestinian, I’m apt to express my disapproval of the isrealian government whenever i see an opportunity. Maybe you are alt to express your approval of Israelian government,  i dont really care, as long as im allowed to express my opinion."
PublicFreakout,fo08mb5,t1_fo052ib,1587407992.0,Its the land occupied by a very imaginative country known as” isreal” which despite the name- isn’t real. (Yes i know i spelled it wrong)

FreeSpeech,fnkc6c1,t1_fnkaken,1587021684.0,"So is all freedom of speech fair game? If my freedom of speech suppresses another persons freedom of speech,  then its okay as long as I’m not the government? Is that what I’m getting from you?"
