hamsters,fpl9zhx,t1_fpk7auu,1588708980.0,I was wondering how young you must be to have only been 5 when it came out. Then I googled it and realized I was only 6. Guess I’m not THAT old.
domesticviolence,fogrp9a,t3_g7cobm,1587756215.0,"I am so sorry to hear you went through that, and especially at the hands of your brother. Not sure why your mom is protecting him but I can imagine that was hurtful to experience. 

Have you ever tried calling/chatting with the National Domestic Violence hotline? I'm literally doing that as I write this because my bf was arrested for assaulting me last night. So I know what you're feeling right now. 

When I'm in that position I try to distract myself with things like uplifting/funny movies. Or if you can it might be nice to take a walk and get some fresh air. Something to stop your body from having that fight/flight reaction. I'm no expert, but these things are helpful for me. Please feel free to send me a private message if you want to talk more. It's nice talking to someone who understands."
