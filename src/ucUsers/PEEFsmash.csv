That said, what I can say is that your increase in volatility between 0/100 and 20/80 (assuming it is an increase!) would be worth it for the increased returns to most people including me. But I'm merely presenting some simple 1-fund solutions of varying mixes."
Bogleheads,fplo0fl,t1_fpl820t,1588716204.0,"I would not worry about holding balanced funds in a taxable.

There are in fact a series of very small gains of a few basis points to be found here and there SOMETIMES if you want to take the (relatively significant) time to figure out everything you need to know about your own situation and your ability to place things in whatever way.

But when we are talking about short term savings pre-retirement, you can't just split everything up into an 401k or whatever to get some small advantage...Those accounts don't allow access. So you really have -no choice- but to put money dedicated for short term use into a taxable investment account. And if some of that money is best off as bonds, then there's nothing else to do. You could go with tax exempt bonds, but they are really only appropriate for folks with very high incomes, otherwise their lower expected returns more than cancel out the tax gains.


So, in short, you gain a great deal in time spent and simplicity of additions/withdrawals. And in many cases, you don't even have the opportunity to place this money anywhere better. So hold those balanced funds in a taxable like a boss."
Bogleheads,fpl4yx4,t3_ge3oqh,1588706459.0,"Here are some thoughts in order from most aggressive appropriate to most conservative appropriate, I answered this question on a discord for someone recently, hence the links:

Lifestrategy Conservative Growth (VSCGX) would, despite the name, be the most aggressive of the options I list because it is 40% stock/60% bonds both total world diversified. 

The next most aggressive would be the Target Retirement Date set to reach its date 10 years before you actually want it (in this case, Target Retirement 2020). This sounds confusing but as this graph shows, it actually takes 7 years PAST the listed retirement date for it to reach its most conservative level, meaning for the 3 upcoming years you'd get additional risk/return before it just becomes Vanguard Target Retirement Income (VTINX) which is itself 30% stock. [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/661660039253327877/702571776013631538/Vanguard\_glidepath.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/661660039253327877/702571776013631538/Vanguard_glidepath.png)

So that leads into the possibility of just buying VTINX from the beginning, which would be slightly more conservative than the Target Retirement option in the first 3 years, but still offer plenty of growth overall. 

Next would be Lifestrategy Income (VASIX), which is very much like VTINX but is only 20% stock. A bit more security for a bit smaller potential growth. 

Finally you could just own 0% stock 100% bond via BNDW (Total World Bond ETF) as the safest option I'd consider for your time horizon outside of just a savings account.

Those are just a few options too, there are others. As far as which of them or which others are right for you, that's a decision only you can make. These are each maximally-diversified and fully-compensated buckets of risk. It's up to you how much risk and volatility you're willing to take for the reward that ought to come."
Bogleheads,fpkgq2v,t1_fpjvvt8,1588694380.0,"There is no such free lunch. There is no actual or theoretical way to reduce volatility while increasing returns outside of -maximizing diversification- (reduces volatility while keeping expected returns the same) and minimizing cost/fees (increases returns while keeping volatility the same). On a backwards looking basis, you can slice and dice asset classes that worked that way in the past. But forward looking that always fails. Hence why no fund managers beat the market long term.  


You buy buckets of risk. Things like Emerging Markets offer higher risk and higher volatility but also an expected higher return in the long term. Maybe small caps work this way too, though it is much more unclear whether small caps are actually more risky or whether their past outperformance (and recent terrible underperformance) was random variance. Either way, you are still taking on real risk whether you recognize it or not.

So if the world of stocks is such that 55% of the value is in the USA, then that's what VT is. If the USA's companies all drop in half in value due to some cataclysmic event in the USA, but the rest of the world's markets maintain their same value, then VT will naturally come to reflect the new reality, which is that the USA's companies no longer make up anything close to 55%.

So scummy. You are okay with a group of workers telling some other worker that they aren't allowed to work without being a part of the club. Disgusting. That's what unions do best, limit the labor supply and increase unemployment in order to selfishly increase their own wages at the expense of those less skilled or less connected."

AdviceAnimals,foohv0i,t1_fooe74x,1587939255.0,"Amazon workers are overwhelmingly happy. Of course, given that there are hundreds of thousands working for or connected to Amazon, there will undoubtedly be complainers (and, yes some mistakes), but they are an incredibly good employer. They pay higher wages than their competitors (now at a $17 starting minimum wage with clear paths toward promotion), all workers are given the same benefits package as the executives, they were one of the first corporations to offer 2 week+ paid sick leave for covid patients, and so on. They also are providing all employees who interact with others PPE gloves/masks.

They are of course a far superior place to work compared to almost any smaller competitor on literally every metric, but don't let that stop you from complaining!"
AdviceAnimals,fooau9d,t1_fonzvwa,1587935734.0,"Of all the mega-corporations, Amazon has the fewest harmful externalities and the most positive externalities. One huge positive externality is the fact that their low prices force everyone else, no matter how remote, to stop gouging the consumer.

This is why the crocodile tears over ""local mom and pop shops"" are so pathetic...these little shops are typically getting by on a psuedo-local-monopoly and have been jacking up prices because its the only way for people in rural areas to get products. Amazon has forced every store in the country to more competitively price their goods. All consumers have benefitted, and -more than half of the country's population- now uses Amazon Prime. That is because other venues -failed- to do what Amazon has succeeded at: retailing almost every item to almost every customer with the best service and quickest shipping. BTW: Everyone knows what I'm saying is true, that's why all these losers -acting- like they hate Amazon actually use it every day. I hope someday people gain some appreciation for these mega corps. Its unfathomable to me that they haven't already when Amazon, Costco, Walmart, Microsoft, Google, etc are making life during the virus possible."
