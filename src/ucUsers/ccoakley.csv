UCSantaBarbara,fp12ec2,t3_gad7tb,1588222562.0,"You’re overthinking this. I’d be kind of spooked if someone invited me to something because I was skinny. Just start with your roommate(s), your classmates, and anyone else who has common interests. I met my wife at a party for a friend in IV. I knew a guy (C) in my class. He introduced me to his roommate (E). E introduced me to her former roommate (L). Fast forward and C is a groomsman at my wedding to L. 

Dude in my class (M) goes to a party. He’s kind of shy, but stays because he recognizes me. He meets E at the party. Fast forward and M marries E. Actually, E also introduced C to his future wife when we all went out to a bar in SB.

My friend C lived in a 7-person house on Estero his senior year. One couple were high school sweethearts and ended up getting hitched. Another guy in that house is still part of our close circle of friends. Another guy would probably still be my friend, but he dated my sister in law and it ended really badly.

While writing this, I realize another married couple from that group of friends  first met because some guy visited a high school friend in IV and her roommate hit it off with him.

I realize that trying to have a social life doesn’t have to end with marrying your friend’s friend. But that group met through class, through the ski and snowboard club, through roommates, and through working the same retail job in Goleta. Two people In that group always knew a party to attend, a concert worth going to (I had an old suburban, so I’d get an invite to things just because I had 7 seatbelts), or some festival worth attending.

Just open yourself to being social and having friends, and you’ll be fine."

UCSantaBarbara,fnsq240,t1_fnrpdh3,1587226622.0,"I worked in 3 labs (2 were professor Lubin). In one, I wrote some software for the telescope on top of the physics building. For the second, I designed and machined a component of a satellite (not that exciting: I made a hollow copper cylinder to hold/shield an instrument). For the third, I prepared some slides for various microscopes. Then I used said microscopes. Using the scanning electron microscope resulted in an image that led to my first publication.

There are physics professors with labs in material science. I *think* that’s chem-like. But professors tend to prefer opening their labs to people in the department. That’s not a hard and fast rule, though.

As far as “staying in academia” goes: I went to grad school in Computer Science. I’ve lectured at UCSB in CS, but the vast majority of my employment has been in industry. One classmate of mine teaches high school physics. One classmate went to get his PhD in physics and is now a data scientist for a tech company. Another was a software engineer (now a high level manager at a larger firm). Another founded multiple startups, several of which had multi million dollar exits for him (he’s an extreme outlier and was a commencement speaker for CCS a few years back). Another went to grad school in physics and teaches at a community college (Mt SAC). Another started an IT firm that specialized in setting up the infrastructure for cruise ships. Another (not actually a classmate, but went through the same program when I was in grad school and dated a friend of mine) was a science consultant for some of the Stargate series. She now works as a geophysicist for oil companies in Canada."
UCSantaBarbara,fnrolcg,t3_g3jees,1587195847.0,"How’s your calculus knowledge? If you nail the math, you can learn the physics and even gain the intuition you currently lack. 

You can look up the physics 1-5 course descriptions online. They follow the textbook fairly well. If you can make it through those, and you have the math skills, you can get through everything else except Thermo, which makes absolutely no sense and all homework and exam problems are pulled from the depths of hell. Why the fuck do I even need to know some stupid equation for a rubber band? It’s not even that good of a model, ffs. 

But don’t worry, because you still have E&M and Quantum, which allow your math strength to show again. 

Senior lab is cool; You get to reproduce a few experiments that led to Nobel prizes, or make a cool hologram. 

At some point you’ll probably work for professor Lubin or something. I think two labs employ all of the physics undergrads that want a job. If you have the opportunity, you should work in a lab. You’ll meet cool people and gain perspective on what real research is like. If you’re insane enough to want to go to grad school, this will also be your source of a recommendation letter.

Don’t neglect your GEs. That’s your shot to meet people who aren’t in your major. You should date those people."
