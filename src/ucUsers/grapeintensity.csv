CrusaderKings,fplhzke,t3_ge1qhy,1588713051.0,"I'm having a lot of trouble maintaining a large empire. It feels like I can't even chill for one second without some peasant rebellion, religious revolt, independence faction, adventurer, a crusade/jihad, or random claimant declaring war on me. The playthrough isn't even fun anymore since I can't do anything but fight defensive wars. How do I fix my run?"
CrusaderKings,fpjgejj,t1_fpjfysf,1588667518.0,Unfortunately I'm an emperor so I can't do that. Any other options?
CrusaderKings,fpjf7yt,t3_g9r5fh,1588666304.0,Is there any quick way to convert to Greek culture? I'm trying to restore the Byzantine empire but right now I'm Lithuanian. I don't have the Rajas of India DLC.

berkeley,fp8mht1,t1_fp8ma8t,1588396310.0,you need to delete some files in the working directory for several commands
CrusaderKings,fp6z272,t3_g9r5fh,1588361102.0,Do you guys usually keep all your kingdom level titles as an emperor or do you hand them out?
berkeley,fp0lcqn,t3_ga3aga,1588211592.0,"I'd also like to know this for the same reason. For some reason I can't find anything when I looked up ""Robert Noe UC Berkeley"", I can only find results for Alva NoÃ«. Is that the same person?"
DotA2,foz6p9k,t1_foz25jl,1588185594.0,"Yeah, I agree. I'd like to see the RNG on river runes tuned down as well, but people hardly ever complain about them because they've been in the game for so long."
berkeley,fovo3s6,t1_fovmphz,1588104604.0,"can't they just ignore them? I mean, everyone is allowed to post about their own classes here, it just so happens that the subreddit (and the school in general) has a large amount of cs students."
berkeley,fovnzxg,t1_fovl8oq,1588104551.0,"I think the questions are around the same difficulty as mt2, but you're taking it out of 25 rather than out of 20, so it's much harder."
berkeley,fovnw85,t1_fovjt6k,1588104501.0,"No idea why they changed the cap from 20 to 25. Was mt2 too easy or something? 40 minutes into the test I was left thinking ""How do I still have SO many questions left""?"
DotA2,fov1668,t1_fou1gvf,1588093708.0,"I used to have this mindset too, just hear me out though. As a man, your run-ins with girls during dota matches is probably pretty rare. At least, if you do end up in a team with a girl, if they never use their mic or explicitly say that they're a girl, you won't notice. So that means the sample of games where you play with a girl AND that girl reveals their gender to the entire team is going to be very very small. Not to mention that if you are not one of the types to flame women, then the number of potential toxic teammates gets cut down from 4 to 3. So the games that /u/CautiousPupper are referring too are probably a whole different set of games from yours. That doesn't mean the toxicity towards women isn't real or that it doesn't happen though. A quick google search would bring up some results (or if you don't want to, [here's a link for you to peruse](https://old.reddit.com/r/GirlGamers/search?q=toxic&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)).

For me, it took until somebody else told me their experience and shared their story to realize that sometimes things happen totally outside of your view of the world. Sometimes just reading or listening to some stories goes a long way."
DotA2,fouzsk1,t1_fou14rn,1588093064.0,"Yeah it's kind of sad how a bunch of replies to this comment are just like ""I've never seen it, so it must not happen"" or ""Oh everyone gets flamed, man or woman"". The fact that girls get treated differently in-game for using voice chat is no secret. Even female casters for Dota 2 get shit on just for being women."
DotA2,fouxwzo,t1_fouqnc3,1588092199.0,Yeah this feels really strange. I'm so used to long patches from icefrog where every weak hero receives a miniscule buff and every strong hero receives a decent nerf. That attention to detail just seems missing from this patch.
berkeley,fotmugs,t1_fosmqaj,1588058940.0,"So this basically boils down to ""do whatever fits you best"". But what if I don't know what the best option for me is. I'm doing well in some of my classes but not as well in others? What should I do then?"
berkeley,fost2jo,t3_g97621,1588037468.0,"When you design, you should keep persistence in mind. Make a list of things that need to persist between commands so you know what needs to be saved as a file and what doesn't. Ideally, a really nice design would have layers of abstraction that would make it really easy to separate what goes where, but as someone with very little experience in how to design these kinds of programs, I found that pretty difficult to do."
CrusaderKings,fory8nh,t1_foril1v,1588020605.0,"It's definitely real Agnatic-Cognatic, since my son inherits over his younger sister. Making a copy of the game in non-ironman and changing my religion to something else and then back to reformed bon fixes it. I don't have a good way to switch religions in my real ironman save though. Moving my capital to a non-bon county doesn't give me the option to covert, nor can I convert to my non-bon wife's religion. I think this might be because I turned off secret religious cults? I had a bad experience with them in an earlier save, but I did not forsee that it would cause this.

Also, this might be related, but I am able to change to Agnatic, Gavelkind, Elective, etc. despite the fact that I have count-tier vassals who have a negative opinion of me. Is the succession law criteria just not updating or something? I still don't know if this is a bug or a feature.

Edit: I can convert to my concubines' sunni or tengri religions, but [I can't convert back to reformed bon](https://i.imgur.com/nXgudGI.png), despite being the dalai lama. This is really frustrating."
CrusaderKings,forh9t9,t1_fords31,1588012207.0,"I acquired my primary title after reforming, so it didn't automatically switch over. How do I check if it's enforced? All that matters it the holder's religion, right?"
CrusaderKings,foq1o80,t3_g5j6bv,1587979735.0,"When I try to switch from Agnatic-Cognatic Ultimogeniture to Absolute Cognatic Ultimogeniture, the ""Religion has the feature Equality"" box is not checked. But I follow the reformed Bon religion with the Harmonious doctrine, so shouldn't I be allowed to change it?"
CrusaderKings,fopi6m5,t1_fophm5u,1587962137.0,"Sometimes if you're in a secret religious cult you will get a mission to ""lay low"", where a lot of events will test your allegiance to your fake faith"

CrusaderKings,fohq1j0,t1_fohpy51,1587770438.0,I was cautious enough to test things out in a copy of my save with console commands until i got it to work. Thanks for the help!
CrusaderKings,fohpq2c,t1_fohg79x,1587770259.0,Oh my fucking Perun I finally figured it out. I had to give him a title higher than duke-level and THEN kill him. I kept granting counties and killing and nothing was happening.
CrusaderKings,fohae5p,t1_foh3uaz,1587762680.0,Yeah unfortunately that doesn't work either. Someone new just takes his place. I think the succession is elective so he doesn't matter if he has no dynastic heirs or not. It feels like paradox kinda overlooked this situation happening.
CrusaderKings,fogzeu8,t1_fogo9w5,1587758750.0,"Oh it turned off achievements. that really sucks, since I can't revoke it."
DotA2,fogibfu,t1_fog9nj5,1587752942.0,the flak cannon cooldown reduction in the recent patches have made him a million times more fun. go try him out if you haven't tried him out during this patch yet
CrusaderKings,fogasyh,t1_fog3f58,1587750198.0,"For whatever reason, granting him a county to make him my vassal only let's me revoke that county, not ""the Slavic Church"" title.
