UCSantaBarbara,fpbdpyi,t1_fpbajem,1588467658.0,"""Can you prove that hospitals would be over run if we didn’t social distance? Of course not, there’s no standard of measurement""

Yes we can. We have peer reviewed statistical models that tell us our health system would be overrun. We don't need something to have happened before in order to know that it is a possibility.

""And we’re talking about California here, not New York, which is literally a cesspool of millions of people living on top of each other who mainly commute by crammed up subways.""

California is the home of San Francisco, a comparable cesspool where people commute like sardines on trains and buses. It is also a major tourist destination and a hub for travel to and from Asia. San Francisco has thankfully avoided New York's fate because of aggressive social distancing, which it enacted before New York. And if you're trying to make the point that California is more spread out than New York, then you're ignoring the fact that it is a highly contagious virus spread easily by modest social contact. Standing in line at any grocery store is enough to spread it and you don't need to be commuting on the subway to be affected. Especially when people can be contagious for two weeks without knowing it. Think about how many people you come into within even 3 feet of in a normal two weeks.

""Also hospitals classifying all deaths as corona even when corona was not the cause of death is very misleading to the public which lead OP to post""

This is a conspiracy theory. It is false. If anything, coronavirus deaths are being underreported. See Florida, which just mandated that medical examiners stop releasing coronavirus death numbers."
