If you're planning for grad school, as /u/gnaist says, it's more important to take some upper div math classes and get a strong letter of recommendation."

ucla,fnfflby,t1_fn9362k,1586907108.0,"I've known several students who have double majored in both Statistics and Math of Computation. You may also consider the Data Theory major which is a hybrid of Statistics / Math. Also, there will be a virtual Department of Statistics Information panel on April 25. You should get an email from admissions with planned virtual events at some point with information on how to register for the panel."

The $1385 is probably safe to use because it was reflected in your Bruin Bill account.

Wait for more information regarding the check for $1035. Hopefully you'll get some kind of statement telling you what it is for. If it turns out to be a mistake, they can demand the money back and you'd be liable for it (even if the mistake is their fault)."
ucla,fn4srcu,t3_fzjtqt,1586648165.0,"For me, the PhD was absolutely worth it. I now have my dream job of lecturer and I get to teach here at UCLA. This would not be possible without the PhD. That said, the PhD was a very long and difficult ordeal. I personally struggled with research and it took me a very long time to complete my dissertation. I must warn any student considering graduate studies that (in my experience) there is a significant jump in the expectations of students between graduate students and undergraduates. The first year of graduate level courses can be a major adjustment demanding many hours of reading and study.

Today, some students call me professor or doctor, but I also tell them they can call me Miles. The goal of attaining the title by itself will not be enough to motivate the work required to complete the degree. However, if you want to work in academia (something I wanted, but is not for everyone) the degree will be a requirement for many jobs.

If you plan on working in industry, however, the PhD is unlikely to provide that much more opportunity than a masters degree with proven work experience. Industry tends to promote those with industry experience. A PhD can get you started a bit higher on the corporate ladder when you first join, but I doubt that the it will fully balance out the time lost in aqcuiring the PhD. I suspect someone who got their master's degree and immediately started working may be ""further along"" in their career."
ucla,fmn7iru,t1_fmmzcng,1586219853.0,"For any roommate situation, I highly recommend an agreement to create scheduled privacy. Yes, class schedules are useful but sometimes students will skip class or decide to return to the dorm unexpectedly.

With scheduled privacy, each roommate gets to designate a few hours per week (I suggest minimum 3) where all parties agree that no matter what, no one else will be in the room during the time.

If someone is in a romantic relationship, you can increase the amount of scheduled privacy and be sure that everyone sharing the room gets an equal amount of private time. That way no one begins resenting the person in the relationship for ""always"" claiming the room."
