UCSC,fpgu2vj,t3_gdc8lq,1588609528.0,"IDK if you have seen current news, california is not getting relaxer bro.... Bay area has increased their restrictions. Most likely SO-CAL is the same, because population is dense. Well somebody shared this on my post

UCSC,fpgtrcy,t1_fpfw2yr,1588609362.0,I see. Thank you for letting us know :)
UCSC,fpfvejn,t1_fpfcdw7,1588584960.0,"You do have a valid point. It is hard for students to find housing again if they have moved back with to their parents house. There was also a spike in deaths in Bay Area last week. I just hope for admin to make a decision in reasonable time, so students can prepare."
UCSC,fpeugfv,t1_fpenyus,1588555184.0,"LMAO ""NEEDIEST"" I hope they don't make a biased ass judgement, but that is the case for everything these days. I just hope to get something.."

### News & Important Dates

**The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act signed into law March 28, 2020, provided funding directly to higher education institutions to support the costs of shifting classes online, and for emergency relief to federally eligible students for basic needs, technology, and other purposes. This funding will be made available to our neediest students based on criteria developed in consultation with multiple campus agencies, including the Dean of Students, SUA and GSA, and the Undergraduate and Graduate Divisions. We will notify all eligible students when funding decisions are finalized.**   "
UCSC,fpeexyq,t3_gczbz0,1588546224.0,Currently taking it. Book we are using is Second edition of the c programming language by brian w kernighan. I would start studying the stack and also linked list. Good luck in the summer with this class. You will be spending a lot of time in front of a screen!
UCSC,fp405xu,t3_gafwdm,1588289106.0,"Lived at Stevenson and It was notttt fratty lolll. Starting of the quarter is lively everywhere and once things start picking up, you see less and less of partying. I chose stevenson cuz of opers and that beautiful view. Regardless what you choose, you will meet great people:)"
UCSC,fp3ydbq,t3_gb3qag,1588288120.0,I was in the same boat last year and i chose to do dorms. Best decision so far. If you can do dorms and don't mind living with others. DO IT
UCSC,fosuczl,t1_for0y5n,1588038230.0,facts!!!!
UCSC,fosloi6,t3_g9830u,1588033176.0,"Correct me if i am wrong, but him being a STEM professor will help us CE majors and making the professors understand the adversity we are facing. Honestly, he makes a lot of key points that is relevant to my life. My mom is a nurse who works at a private care and rehab center. They were on the news for most deaths in NOR-CAL. It has been so difficult focusing, since I am always worried for her welfare. Moreover, a quiet study space is a big issue. Other day, I was taking a test and my grandma walks into my room with food. Well, there goes my concentration and the test. LOL"
UCSC,forny80,t1_foq1i2q,1588015451.0,"LOL, every room is priced differently. i would say anywhere \~4k"

UCSC,fop0w5i,t3_g8mvds,1587950631.0,"Missing dorm life right now. I lived at stevenson transfer community in a quad. I had the biggest room and lived with 3 others. Quads were rooms converted from a lounge and man. My room had one of the best views. Woke up with a sunrise. Opers is super close and it was just amazing. Now if you like partying, you just have to find the right people. You will find something regardless. I didnt go to a party at porter, but from what I heard, there is always something going on overthere. My transfer community was a mix of chill and outgoing people. We didn't throw wild parties, so if you are into that, maybe try to get housing at porter. Regardless where you are at, you will meet all types of people. Try to get along with everyone and you will be fine. Also, if you hate small spaces, you will hate triples! Honestly, live in a dorm. It's easy to make friends. That was the best thing I have done. After living in the dorms, you can maybe get an apartment next year with your friends. Idk how your living situation is or the budget. 

GOOD LUCK"

UCSC,fo0ecap,t3_g4ge0u,1587411547.0,I am taking it right now. It is not too bad. NO tests and just quizzes
UCSC,fo0drzc,t3_g4d25s,1587411184.0,"CSE100 consumes your life, and i am sorry you are taking it virtually. The labs are difficult, and now no interaction with the Lab tutors sounds horrible. I had to take that class twice. 100 really broke me lol. LAB 7 is wild because you are making a game. I would say make a lot of friends in that class so you guys can share ideas on how to overcome a problem. I am wondering how labs are done now, specially lab 7, because basysboard is connected with VGA to a screen. Who has VGA now? LOL"
