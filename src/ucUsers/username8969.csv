Yeah that‚Äôs different than my situation so yeah I‚Äôm not really sure what would be best :/ I will say 65 was a very normal average (if not higher) for ochem exams at UCSB when I took it and there was always a curve with the profs I had. the fact she won‚Äôt curve with that average is really fucking stupid, sorry about that"
UCSantaBarbara,fpezsym,t1_fpezpgp,1588558523.0,Oh yeah don‚Äôt take it here especially since you‚Äôre so close to being done with the series in CC. You got this
UCSantaBarbara,fpezhho,t3_gd1zoc,1588558320.0,"Hey! I‚Äôm a biological sciences BS transfer. I transferred without taking both ochem and physics. If I could go back I would 100% just take ochem at my CC to save money, have a smaller class size and my CC actually had a rly good chem department. Ochem here was rough for me cus it was my first series in the quarter system and at a new school.

But yes, it does count towards upper div units here. To graduate in this major you just need 60 UD units. A minimum of 48 of those units will come from your mandatory classes. Then you need to find 12 ‚Äúelectives‚Äù which can just be UD bio classes you‚Äôre really interested in from any of the 8 areas."
UCSantaBarbara,fpehs0b,t3_gcyfdb,1588547807.0,Oh no I wonder what happened to Peach! She would say how teaching botany was always her dream jobü•∫
UCSantaBarbara,fothbg6,t3_g9h660,1588053929.0,"I transferred as a bio major 2 years ago. The learning curve transitioning to the quarter system and increased academic rigor took about 2 quarters for me but there were tons of academic resources that were helpful like CLAS, tutoring, good   TA's and making study buddy friends. I'm sure the learning curve and acclimation period is the same no matter where you go if youre going from CC semester to a 4 year quarter system. I also have a handful of friends who really like the psych and brain science program.

Life in Goleta/IV/SB is amazing and I think no other UC or CSU can compare. theres the beach, mountains, sports, downtown, funk zone, shopping and tons more. IV is really special if you choose to live there because its literally right next to campus, 99.9% students and the beach is just wicked beautiful.

Socially acclimating yourself as a transfer is whatever you make if it. you can wiggle into a friend group, make other transfer friends, go to clubs, go to recreation center events and more. but my advice would be don't get hung up or feel pressured to find those ""lifelong"" best friends. just go with the flow.

any other questions lmk!"
UCSantaBarbara,fot3q3u,t1_fot0qax,1588043960.0,"I agree that teachers/ people running classes are presenting many issues rn like: unreasonable work loads, enforcing the use of proctorU and lack of communication. BUT I think the real evil people are behind the scenes in administration: the chancellor, student affairs and the office of budget and planning.
the UC system is straight up corrupt and money hungry. I‚Äôm stoked I‚Äôm a graduating senior and honestly my heart goes out to anyone dealing with this bs after spring quarter :("
UCSantaBarbara,fosaqj5,t1_fos8tgm,1588027074.0,"In my opinion they don‚Äôt justify anything, they just explain what else we can do now that they‚Äôve made the decision. Yes, people should know where they stand in a class going into a final but these are unprecedented times that involve rapidly evolving problems in people‚Äôs home lives, work lives and personal lives. It‚Äôs irrelevant to say which is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù: P/NP or W because every students situation, GPA, plans after graduation, etc are different. The OPTION for P/NP should be allowed because it literally does no harm."

here's some opinions. General consensus: toxic and uneducated"
UCSantaBarbara,fobxtn6,t1_foa4eob,1587664878.0,for test anxiety the most beneficial accommodations for me have been the alternative test taking setting and extended time for the exam. since youre already a dsp student id recommend taking to your specialist for more information!
UCSantaBarbara,fo9a9rq,t1_fo940gt,1587614246.0,"your disabilities and struggles are valid. I went half of college unknowingly struggling with depression and anxiety. those things mess with your entire life: friends, family and even taking tests. I signed up and bam I realized im not like my classmates and physically cant handle being in a lecture hall for exams and need 20 minutes to have a panic attack after being handed an exam. its not that I don't work as hard as my classmates, I just literally have physiological and chemical differences in my body than them lol. if you still have time id say just pick up your results and apply for DSP if needed. and on a side note thats just tortuous to yourself to not know if youre diagnosed or not with something. maybe just go find out even if you don't sign up for DSP?"
UCSantaBarbara,fo99fsg,t3_g6af4f,1587613663.0,"I worked at DSP and was a client. Everything is confidential and your personal private information is protected under the Americans with disabilities act! joining DSP was the best decision I made for my test anxiety. In my experience the approval was as easy as a 30 minute appointment. I had already been diagnosed by a psychiatrist (similar to you with your new diagnosis) and then simply made an appointment to meet with a DSP specialist. if I remember correctly my doctor just emailed over my documents or I uploaded them to the DSP student portal and bam of course they have to approve you for medical purposes.

As for affecting your future...again, your personal private information is confidential/ protected and your employers really only would know if you wanted to disclose your disability with them. 

hope this helps!"

UCSantaBarbara,fnfzr9b,t3_g1ipo9,1586919005.0,"Saw this on fb earlier and I've noticed this lady makes some really tone deaf posts on free and for sale. Is she trying to guilt trip people or make them feel responsible for janitors and essential workers getting laid off lol? Then the fear mongering by lazily stating IV is ""safer"" than going back home (which could be literally anywhere for an individual reading this post). It's the middle of an economic crisis and she's targeting dirt poor freshmen from the dorms in this post. (generally) their families want them home to save money and not spend thousands on your shitty DP rental lady jeez. thoughts?"
