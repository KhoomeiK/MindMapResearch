Vitiligo,fphvoh8,t3_gdizaa,1588628663.0,"In my experience, vitiligo spots are much more distinct and the legions are somewhat localized. These look kind of randomly spread out and sort of pattern like?? I know the severity and legions of vitiligo really depends on the case by case basis, but you're really gonna get the most straight forward and true answer from a dermatologist."
Vitiligo,fphv7f4,t3_gdkjxg,1588628412.0,"I have experienced this from my perspective as a dude.

 I'd always be really worried about it being a turn off, but I always make sure to stop a partner before things go in that direction, and explain to them what's going on so they're not surprised. Unfortunately, I feel like that's forced me to take extra extra care of grooming down there just to look as presentable as possible which can be kind of a hassle, but every partner I've been with has told me that they don't mind. I think I heard someone say it on an earlier post about the same topic: ""if they've gone far enough to want to see your junk, they probably won't care what it looks like."" In most cases, that's been true for me! But your concerns are valid. I think proper communication is key to your own safety and comfort."

berkeley,fp3x0c6,t1_fp3wk0r,1588287383.0,I'm glad you share my problem cautious philosophy. I'm starting to think I might be fine with cherry picking. I reached out to UCLA and UC Berkeley law school admissions about this problem and they gave me some good responses. I can forward you these emails if you want/just let me know if helps give any context. They got back to me like 3 MINUTES ago so they did come in clutch.

Fun fact: WHERE you get an internship should only matter in the context of furthering your career, not in the determination of your social status with friends or the sex(s) that you're attracted to."

Also YEAH they should have put the title track on that album! The desired effect song is actually really good, every now and then I'll remember the first lyric ""she was raised by Protestants, I was raised by wolves"" and I just HAVE to hear it again. Good thoughts up there brother"

My sexual partners haven't had any bad reactions too it! They've always found it interesting. The only thing I get worried about is the white hairs, which I make sure to trim often just for cosmetic purposes. But dude, make sure to be open with your partner about it. The best thing to do is be straight up about them with your insecurity, and hopefully they take it well. Good luck!"
berkeley,fnly9ok,t3_g2j8je,1587061835.0,"Honestly I love my school I think Berkeley is a fantastic place, but you're gonna face some hard classes and not a lot of direct help here from counselors etc if you're gonna be MCB and pre-med. You're going to get a world class education at Cal for sure, and a Berkeley degree is powerful when it comes to grad school apps. But a more solid GPA and more opportunities to succeed at UT Austin might also be powerful. You could be able to handle UC Berkeley, it's just gonna take a lot of effort and time, especially in the beginning. If you're able to handle that, you'll be able to succeed here. If you were majoring in something other than stem I'd try and convince you to go here. In your case, at the end of the day, I think I'd rather go with UT Austin. Save the money with instate tuition, you'll need it for med school later. You're gonna be missing out on our football team which is getting better and better ðŸ˜Ž but, that's what I think. Good luck dude!"

Vitiligo,fn98zof,t3_g0bkgk,1586763724.0,"Your hair only turns white on the folical producers who's pigment producers are affected by bad vitiligo spots. You only get white hairs on the bad spots. I also have a few hidden white hairs on my head from spots I probably have on my scalp, as well as a few in my beard and mustache. Don't worry, you'll only get more white hairs if it starts spreading really badly, which depends on your case and severity of vitiligo. I'd reccommend looking into treatments to help stop the spread now if that's something you're interested in. Good luck! In my opinion, our white hairs make us look kind of cool and unique !"

Although my patches have never been on places that were too publicly noticable, I know how you feel about the insecurity. There are lots of people in this community who would tell you the same thing as me: stay strong, and stay you! Don't let the v change your own perception of who you are, don't let it stop you from feeling freely you. At least you and me and everyone with vitiligo has some spark to them, we're not just cookie cutter perfect people! Your feelings are definitely valid, and you should know that it's ok to feel that way sometimes. But you GOTTA know that you're SPECIAL.I got my vitiligo from my mom, and she would always say to me ""people with vitiligo are just so gorgeous that the universe had to give us a set back to make us only just as pretty as everyone else"" 
You're great! Vitiligo is just the universe's way of nerfing a person who's too pretty and amazing. Stay strong b!"
Vitiligo,fl1ym90,t3_fm0nrj,1584739051.0,"The fact that you are showing this much consideration and care for it is wonderful, so you're already coming from a good place. 

I'd say that the best thing to do is make sure that they still feel attractive and beautiful and or handsome. Make sure to remind them you think that of them naturally. State it as a casual fact, not as wishy washy complement. It can help, I know if needed that from time to time. Also I agree with the rest of the comments, which are also great pieces of advice."
