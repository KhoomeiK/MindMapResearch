berkeley,fmgi8yc,t3_fv2eed,1586049667.0,"Hello welcome to cal! I was very similar in your shoes with no prior programming skills and cs61a being my first CS class. 

To avoid the competitiveness of cs61a's curve in the fall, I took data 8 which helped me get some python knowledge that comes in useful for the first midterm. 

I'm currently in cs61A and I can tell you that there is a bunch of help for that class. I regularly attend office hours whenever I am struggling on homeworks or lab. There are tutoring sessions such as Computer Science Mentors and HKN that I attend once a week. You can also get a personal  tutor through CS 370 to teach you anything that you are confused about in the class.  But the most hopefully one is having a group study.

What's also helped me is this program that I am in called computer science scholars. I'm not sure when the application comes out but you should keep an eye out for that. This program helps people who are underrepresented  in computer science ease into CS classes like cs61a and eecs16a to meeting the gpa cap. They even have their own discussion class and lab so that they can get more help in a smaller and less intimidating environment. 

So there's tons is resources that you can take advantage. While cal may have a reputation of being difficult, there's always someone who is willing to help. So hang in there I'm sure you'll do fine if you put in the time. Go Bears !!"
