episode 3, the fish guy with joey diaz. super beautiful & insightful-- Also, the guy who that podcast was with Damien Echols made a YouTube where he talks abt himself/ the benefits / practice of magick :) just search up his name"

CSHFans,fpc4wde,t1_fpc4pa4,1588487708.0,"Oh I think its completely earnest- I think that's the most compelling aspect of the track- but I guess the lyrics themselves (after a point) don't feel like much. 

but anyway, I'm glad you're enjoying the record :)"
CSHFans,fpc1lfg,t1_fpc0ff5,1588484722.0,"Life Worth Missing for me was kinda ehh, especially the ""Shake! Shake! Shake!"" section which kinda made me feel like I was listening to a fucking Taylor swift song. The great writing I come to expect from Will was just not entirely present on this album. Which is disappointing, but I guess I understand the intent in trying to branch out to larger audiences"
CSHFans,fpbtr78,t3_gcjr22,1588478503.0,"Yes, of course. Everyone's perspective is their own perspective & that can't be taken away. Memes that are shot at the opposing ""side"" of the fanbase are funny (even when you yourself are the target) we're all just normal consumers of art & gotta take the memes in stride"

Hell of an empty quote..... thank you"
ucr,fp8nkxz,t1_fp8myb9,1588397218.0,"I read that on an article on Highlander as well. In the last line of [this article](https://insideucr.ucr.edu/stories/2019/02/20/campus-get-its-first-major-outdoor-sculpture) the CHASS dean says 

“This piece is an invitation to pull us out of our day-to-day habits and jar us into a moment of reflection in the hopes of interjecting critical thought and calling us to action,”  

so out of touch to make this a million dollar project when students are struggling to pay tuition; & when there are people who can't even afford to go to university...."
ucr,fp8kcyg,t3_gbyhk3,1588394606.0,"First off, respectfully, you need to be ""mindful"" of peoples' rights to have issues with the amount they are receiving, if any amount at all. Just because someone else's tax forms assert themselves as less advantaged than someone else does not mean we aren't suffering in the real world just as much- in different ways. 

There are students whose families are not getting any money from the stimulus package because either of their parents are undocumented; you don't know individuals' financial obligations nor do you have the right to *assert* that they are wrong to have an issue with their dissatisfaction."

also, I feel like ""spiritually liberating"" is shortest/best way to describe the effect it has on me; even after just one fucking episode"
MidnightGospel_,foe4uce,t3_g6ytmn,1587696053.0,"Absolutely! The combination of two mediums (podcast & animation) is so beautiful, & as a viewer you're watching/disecting the show on different levels- 1. understanding convo. 2. watching whats going on. 3. making sense of the narrative 4. thinking about what these elements have to do with each other in a metaphorical/symbolic sense.      show feels so groundbreaking"

OCPoetry,fo5t3k6,t3_g5haml,1587534826.0,"Jesus Christ, I love this piece. Your use of rhythm in this is totally amazing; I like the use of capitalization to change the read inflection without demanding a line break (at least thats my interpretation). The imagery is tragic and surreal, only thing I can offer that isn't praise would be pointing out you use ""hungry"" twice back to back, you might want to look for another word to just deepen the pallet of word choice here, 'starving' would be the go to replacement but that really isn't a major critique. Anyway; amazing piece, I love the deep pessimism it puts the reader into because of the dark reality it presents. Thank you for sharing!"
OCPoetry,fo5sdw1,t3_g5gkjg,1587534192.0,"""my hopes for your dreams"" is such a beautiful sentiment"
OCPoetry,fo5rie9,t3_g4sgbh,1587533444.0,"I really like how this piece diffuses in terms of the reduction of complexity in each line's rhythm. In being a simple piece about the experience of questioning the nature of reality, the way you tackle it parallels that thought process-- I really appreciate the ""non poetic"" (in terms of lack of simile / direct metaphor / etc) approach, and how human the piece is. Very approachable & a successful stab at the general confusion we're all feeling @ this point in time.

(Side note: I may be wrong in assuming you wrote this recently, but if this is where your mind is now I'd like to suggest the new Netflix show Midnight Gospel that has a profound spiritual optimism that reflects what I see as the theme in this piece)"

My understanding is that the units only affect what your status is in terms of freshman/soph/etc. My advice is just to take as many community college classes as you can- follow the info on [assist.org](https://assist.org) 

You should take the courses your community college offer so you don't need to waste that time/money at UCR. For example, @ RCC my most expensive semester was 300$ & my first quarter @ UCR ended up being 5,000+"
