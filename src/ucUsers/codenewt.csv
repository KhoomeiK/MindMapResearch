More often than not, I think when it comes to software its about behavior of a software that gets patented and utilized (see Worlds, Inc versus Activision Blizzard)..."

berkeley,fonoqz2,t3_g8an1k,1587923528.0,"I graduated from Cal a few years ago. Sorry to hear you go through that. We boys man-splain too often.

For everyone though, what really got me through Cal's brutal EECS course work, was exactly what you said at the end there. Plan your project team-members before joining a class. Having a consistent group of trusted individuals to work with is the best way to succeed at Cal; irrespective of gender."
