DesiToons,fou9gtf,t1_fou2ol0,1588079474.0,"i agree with some of what you say.

but hindusim is most fluid of almost all surviving religions today. There are very few mandatory practices, and most Hindu's only occasionally do a pooja.

Accumulated experience over thousands of years should just be thrown away?

ANyways unlike Judeo-Christian religions, major texts in Hinduism (Ramayan and Mahabharat) are just stories with morals, importance of duty and obligation to society etc. not much unlike Aesop's fables.

Both of those books have lessons very much relevant to modern life today.

&#x200B;

That being said, certainly practices that infringe on some1 else's right to life freely must be discouraged and stopped regardless of religion.

I do not think there are many such in Hinduism anyways. eg: (Sati is exceptionally rare and practiced only in very few places a long time ago)"
