bayarea,fpky4zu,t1_fpkqyo7,1588703059.0,"I’m sorry to hear that you were in a difficult situation and I’m glad you were able to build a future for yourself and get out of what was a shitty situation. 

I just want to clarify that I’m not one of the people struggling and don’t expect free handouts. Im fortunate enough to have an emergency fund and didn’t qualify for a stimulus check or any other aid. I’m just saying everyone’s situation is different and we should have a little more empathy during this time."
bayarea,fpkndwy,t1_fpk8smt,1588697740.0,"I mean of course everyone wants a backup plan but for college students it’s nearly impossible. Let’s say people in college who are taking out loans to support their education, working a part time job while going to school full time to pay for their living expenses. Private colleges are close to $60,000 and public is about $15,000 a year. 

How would these poor college students supposed to be building an emergency fund when they’re already swimming in debt?

Excluding students, workers that have to pay rent and have children while having a minimum wage job in the Bay Area, it’s nearly impossible to build any fund. They’re already struggling to pay their monthly bills. 

Have you always been able to build and emergency fund your entire left? Did you do it all by yourself for did your parents/family ever help with finances?"

dogs,fpjcrs3,t1_fpjb382,1588663836.0,"I think you might be on to something. I know cats that just gave birth will typically eat the weak ones in the liter since they are less likely to survive. 

From what you described, it makes absolutely no sense for what happened to be an aggressive act.  Especially since it’s not a new dog, it wouldn’t make any sense for Luna to act out and go after her now. She’s so small she should never be seen as a threat. Even if she has a prey drive (like what happened with the rabbit), if she has never acted like that towards Bella before, it wouldn’t make sense for her to randomly do it 3 years later."
dogs,fpjaezz,t3_gdsqha,1588661570.0,"I’m sorry I don’t have much advice here. I just wanted to say I’m so sorry for the loss of your sweet Bella. 

How long have you had Luna for? 4 years? Or did you recently adopt her? Do you think she was just play biting with Luna and accidentally but too roughly? It’s hard to tell since we don’t know her temperament."
bayarea,fpja0it,t1_fpbk77i,1588661193.0,"Not really relevant to your question, but just make sure you’re ready for that commute if you’re committed to living in SF! Without a car it might be hard to get around/do everything you want to outside of SF. It’s also expensive in SF and your commute would be long. 

I remember moving here and saying I didn’t mind the commute just to end up dreading it. 

Can you live closer to Mountain View and go to the city during weekends? If you’re commuting from Mountain View, you’re going to get home late anyway and wouldn’t have much time anyway before you needed to go to bed and get ready for the next day."
bayarea,fpj9tfo,t1_fpic3yg,1588661008.0,"I hated living with people and love to live by myself. It’s a struggle when multiple people are trying to cook or use the dining table/common areas at the same time. I’ve noticed that everyone tends to just stay in their room all the time. None of us had any problems with each other, we spoke when we saw each other but I don’t talk to them after moving out. But you may get lucky! It all depends who you end up landing a place with. If you click with those people or not. 

How is your work culture? Are employees close to your age? If they are, maybe you can find friends at work."
bayarea,fpj902b,t1_fpi6huo,1588660267.0,"Not trying to defend the corporations or landlords since it sounds like they’re being assholes in your situation, but the housing market is so high that 3k for a 1 bedroom is not all that crazy anymore. 

We just bought a 1 bedroom that was built in 1970  and our mortgage and taxes come out to be $3200 a month without considering insurance. To even make any money if I were to rent by 1 bd, I would have to charge >$3200. Paying so much in rent seems like a scam but when you buy a property, you realize that these rent costs aren’t totally unjustified. Considering they also need to pay taxes on the rent they collect.

At 25% tax, I would now need to charge >$4266 to make money. Housing in the Bay Area is absurd."
bayarea,fpj8aad,t1_fpi7xr9,1588659613.0,"The point is that it’s a struggle for people who lost jobs that were already living paycheck to paycheck.

And an argument might be that they should have an emergency fund for things like this, it’s easier said than done. Especially with new grads that just graduated with loans and now are finding that searching for a new job is extremely hard."
bayarea,fpj845x,t1_fpixbe2,1588659459.0,"Is the roommate not responsible for their half since they were on the lease? Did they have a deposit that you can use to cover their rent?

Good luck finding a new place though. It seems like there are a lot of openings right now. Sorry to hear that another thing is added to your plate during this already difficult time"
bayarea,fpj81l2,t1_fpj7q8z,1588659394.0,Thanks for the insight! Just sucks that so much time is spent in commuting just to get a livable wage.

bayarea,fpj7fc2,t1_fpj7588,1588658830.0,"Wow that’s serious dedication. How did you have the motivation to sleep for only 5 hours a day max? Don’t you feel exhausted?

Is the pay you’re getting from Fremont that much more than what’s you be getting in Manteca?

I feel like a baby complaining about my 2.5 hour commute."
bayarea,fpj6ivz,t1_fpj69si,1588658047.0,"Is your commute this extreme? If it is, I’m curious how you balance that with your ever day life. Do you feel like like it’s taking a toll on your mental health? Is it really worth the money saved?

Really interested in hearing the thoughts on someone who commutes for that long every day."
bayarea,fpj5wwp,t1_fpj2gqn,1588657533.0,"I was responding to nodebunny where he/she said it’s not worth it living in Sf and they would come back only if other people start to leave the city. If they were commuting to work, it would still clutter the city with traffic. 

A 4 hour commute is brutal and it’s really not sustainable. Say you sleep for 8 hours, commute for 4, work for 8 hours. That leaves you with only 4 hours a day to do what you enjoy or hang out with your kids. 4 hours remaining to balance getting ready for bed, eating dinner, along with other priorities. 

A 2-3 hour commute might be worth it. When you get close to 4 it’s going to take a toll on your mental health."

Dogtraining,fpis4lm,t1_fpgxud8,1588647482.0,"This is spot on!! I would just add that you shouldn’t give him treats unless he eats. If you do, then he’ll skip meals and just wait for treats"
Dogtraining,fpiquhe,t3_gdep7u,1588646678.0,"Are you giving her kibble? If so, have you tried warm water? It took us 7 months to realize that adding warm water to our rescue’s food was all he needed to eat. I’m assuming it’s because it helps increase the smell of the food and makes it more appetizing. 

It was super frustrating because I would sit there every meal and try to hand feed him, but he would never eat. 7 months!!! And all it took was some warm water. 

If warm water doesn’t fix the issue, you can try adding dog food seasoning to top it too... a lot of people have problems getting their dogs to eat so this is a thing they make lol. 

Warm water is the cheapest option but if you have the extra cash, I think it would really work if you got the wet food and mixed it in with his dry food."
Dogtraining,fpipz7z,t3_gdj01r,1588646148.0,"I’m so sorry to hear how stressful this situation as been for you. I’m curious if anyone has had success with any programs as well. 

I tried sit means sit and it did not work. That was money down the drain ($1800 for 1 week). I know socialization is really important. If you have any friends with dogs, it’s be great to slowly adjust your dog to the same dog so he can be familiar and build his confidence with that dog. 

My rescue is super reactive and it’s been a stressful thing for us since we’ve gotten him. he always reacts on leash (crazy pulling/barking/etc), but when he’s unleashed he actually does well with 65% of dogs. When he’s leashed, he’ll react to every dog and try to bite it. 

If you can find dogs he likes, maybe you can have constant play dates to work on his socialization."
Dogtraining,fpipiap,t3_gdipyz,1588645855.0,"My rescue dog was the same way. He likes walks, but would just lay at home all day and do nothing. We brought him so many toys and he wasn’t interested in anything! I just thought he didn’t like playing. 5 months in and he finally picked up a toy!! Now he loves playing tug, fetch and keep away... so much to the point that it’s too much for me how much he wants to play lol. 

Just give your dog time to settle in. It may take time, but he’ll start showing his personality when he bonds to you! He might be scared being in so many different homes and not understanding that this is permanent."
Dogtraining,fpioyrc,t3_gdgxcc,1588645513.0,"Being 3 years old, I’m assuming your dog should be able to hold their bladder through the night (unless there’s an infection, actual issue, or they drank way too much water before bed). 

If your dog doesn’t have accidents at night, I highly suggest crate training your dog. That was the only way to get our dog to stop barking at night. We also have to play music for him... regret that we started doing that since he’ll bark if we don’t."

In Sacramento, it’s mainly hospitals, schools and government jobs so it doesn’t just fit our career to move anywhere else. 

Everywhere in the south bay is expensive. We commute 1.5 hours each way to try and minimize our housing costs, but it’s still expensive. Even San Jose now is $2400 for a 1 bedroom apt."

Adding the fear of not being financially stable with the fear of going out and contracting the virus, most of these businesses will not be sustained. 

Even if they reopen and SIP is lifted, I suspect that the amount of people eating out won’t go back to the level it was before. People are still going to be terrified of going out.
