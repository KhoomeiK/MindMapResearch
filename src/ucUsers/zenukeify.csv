pics,fnf00bp,t1_fnenz0b,1586898935.0,"That painting is so immensely unsettling. I first saw it as a dog looking over a wall, then a dog submerged in sand, then a dog submerged in water. The ambiguity conveys so many different things, but strange mass of discoloration to the dog‚Äôs right, in the direction the dog is looking is even worse. My brain keeps trying to find patterns and make sense of that one spot; it has a phantasmic presence"

OnePunchMan,fmyx2u4,t1_fmyus9h,1586498471.0,"I agree that Bruce Lee isnt as decent as people think he is. I never disagreed with you on that

Thing about chinese culture is they have all this bullshido like ‚Äúwing chun‚Äù so their mma scene is undeveloped. It has nothing to do with their genetics or something. Genghis khan nearly conquered all of the known world just a thousand years ago.

Also I‚Äôm an actual BJJ combat athlete under Keenan Cornelius so stop trying to flex with your nephew"
OnePunchMan,fmyfrnn,t1_fmycx0v,1586485117.0,? Zhang Weili is the current strawweight UFC champ? Do you know anything about fighting?
bjj,fmxw473,t1_fmwy99m,1586473040.0,Dvds are just more structured generally and try to be more holistic around a specific category. Whether it‚Äôs worth it is up to you
OnePunchMan,fmx0cxw,t1_fmwyvii,1586456209.0,Bro your argument for him being faster than light is a fucking translated manga cover. And sure it‚Äôs FICTION so he can be lightspeed and not follow the rules of physics right? Then why did you calculate it? LOL
OnePunchMan,fmwx9if,t1_fmwvobx,1586454650.0,"When is he lightspeed? And yea I get it‚Äôs for fun and a meme but it‚Äôs still cringey how you don‚Äôt understand relativity at all and use a formula wrong. Flashy flash doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgain mass.‚Äù The ‚Äúrelativistic mass‚Äù or what you can consider ‚Äúeffective mass‚Äù of an object increases with speed according to relativity. That‚Äôs why the energy required to accelerate an object to a higher speed always rises exponentially, approaching infinity at lightspeed. Meaning the number you got from your calc is meaningless."

OnePunchMan,fmwuppu,t1_fmw6vdg,1586453369.0,So this is ‚Äúassuming the mass doesnt reach infinity‚Äù as in ‚Äúthis post is completely wrong?‚Äù Cause not only is flashy flash not the speed of light your energy calc is bogus
