rpg,fpjled6,t3_gdt0vt,1588672894.0,"I started with d&d 11 years ago. Decided I didn’t like DMing d&d, I knew there were options out there that would provide more to the narrative, and that’s what my players and I wanted. So I just started researching. Spent my spare time reading rulebooks, getting a sense of how the game worked. If I liked a game I delved deeper. Why did the game work the way it did? And how was it working to fulfill what I wasn’t getting from d&d.




This left me deciding between dungeon world and FATE Core. The more I looked into both, the more I saw FATE Core as something I could really get behind. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos and podcasts of groups playing FATE. Finally I decided to give FATE a try with my group.




6 years later and FATE is still our main game. Took a lot of time researching it to get there, but it was worth it. I still try out other systems now and then (I really love Ironsworn) and I’ve been developing my own system on the side for the past few months, but for now FATE is my favorite system. It’s easy to learn and has so much potential once you master it.



tldr; Research, research, research. If you know what you want from a game you’ll find the best game for you if you’re willing to do the research. Read the rulebooks all the way through unless partway through you realize it’s not for you. Then, you just have to take the jump and play."

“It’s unethical because it compromises the integrity of the test taking process by causing students to call into question whether questions are fake or real in the future,” makes a lot more sense. “I would waste a bunch of time on a problem I can’t solve,” doesn’t.

Then you try to make some emotional argument on the grounds that OP is stealing from people trying to feed their families.

Listen, I understand that this is something you feel strongly about, and I respect your opinion. But I’m not going to sit here and let you try to use this as some kind of stepping stone for moral superiority. When OP sells a game with the sand assets then I’m all with you.

UCSantaBarbara,fp35jrx,t1_fp2xssa,1588273459.0,"The point of in this comment chain is less about the impossible question, and more about the fact that people who would get hung up on an impossible test question are lacking an important skill that is needed in the real world.

I don’t mean this as an attack either, I mean it in a helpful tip kind of way.



Pretty much any test you take was designed by a flawed human who couldn’t have possibly accounted for all of the different thinkers that will be taking the test. No test is perfect for any test taker. Knowing this, as a test taker it’s important to learn how to recognize when a particular problem is troublesome for you so that you can quickly move on and spend your test time more wisely."

Personally I believe that anyone who gets others in trouble for prototyping assets or writing fanfic for practice/fun (as long as no profit is being made) are just insecure artists that are so defensive of their work they end up stifling the artistic community as a whole. I agree that stealing is not ok, though I can think of some ethical arguments where it may be, so I hesitate saying “never.” But I’m not going to defend these elitist who think that their work is somehow superior by saying that using their assets for prototyping is stealing. It’s prototyping... What makes their assists so special that using theirs is stealing, but using “designated prototype assets” is ok?"

C’mon this isn’t stealing. If this is stealing, then any fan-fiction ever written stole the world and the characters. It’s not like fanfic writers are making money off their writing, they’re just practicing writing and sharing it online. If you’re annoyed by the stolen assets that’s perfectly acceptable. But don’t get into all this about stealing and try to turn this into some non-existent ethical argument."

If the GM’s world is restricted from entering the characters lives then the story will get stale, no matter how interesting the player interactions are. The GM should have a minimal role, if players are doing such a good job of rping with each other, but they should still have the power to be a guiding hand in the plot. The world should feel alive and if players try to ignore the NPCs the world will feel flat.

rpg,fp1r1gg,t1_fp0yla9,1588245127.0,"One of my favorite sessions was one where I hardly did anything. The pc’s got into an argument and even 2 of them got into a combat. 1 of them was in charge of a large group of guards in the scene and at one point ordered them to put 2 of the players at spear point to try and calm things down. All I did the entire session was narrate the guards listening to orders, and describe that there was a fountain in the center of the town so one of the pc’s could put out the fire on them. That’s all I did the ENTIRE session. It’s one of my most cherished memories because I was glad the players were so involved in the world that their characters divided up into two groups to oppose each other’s decisions. Isn’t that what GMing is all about?"
rpg,fp1qmrm,t1_fp1q4j3,1588244739.0,"Sounds like the player just wanted to focus on player relationships/interactions this session. That’s why the asked you not to have anything intense or urgent happen. Probably won’t happen again, but if it does, remember you are the GM and control everything around them. You can insert an NPC pretty easily and be part of the fun.  Or you could insert something that is not intense or urgent, but still relevant to the plot and worthy of addressing."
RPGdesign,fou85e1,t3_g8dhaz,1588078608.0,"If it fits the theme of your game I think it would be cool to literally give your Bosses Plot Armor.



Give your boss X plot armor depending on what is appropriate.

If a boss has more than 0 plot armor they can’t be defeated (this doesn’t mean they can’t be affected in other ways during combat).

Defeating a lesser npc removes 1 plot armor. Defeat enough NPC’s and the boss is now vulnerable (but you just finished off a lesser npc, so you still need to build up FP’s to tans out the boss).



Of course I’m biased, but I really like this idea from a narrative perspective. In most stories you don’t see the boss taken out until most, or all, of their lackeys are taken out."

Step 1: call the game “6-Sided DIE!!!”

Step 2: Players roll a pool of 5 d6 whenever they try something where failure could be “interesting.” As long as a 6 is rolled, success.

Step 3: a successful roll causes a mark on the successful players “dread tracker.”

Step 4: the dread trackers has 14 boxes to mark. There are “milestones” at the 5th, 9th, 12th and 14th boxes.

Step 5: Each milestone removes 1d6 from that player’s pool.

Step 6: if a player fails 5 rolls in a row, they die.

Step 7: adjust these numbers for whatever balance makes more sense than what I suggested.

Step 8: add other rules that make this better.

Live your life. Focus on what you can do for yourself to be happy. Don’t be afraid to try new things, especially if the things you’ve been trying aren’t making you happy. Don’t do anything with the expectation of meeting people, do it because you wanted to. If an opportunity arises to get to know some new people, jump on it. If it doesn’t, that’s fine. Just keeping focusing on making yourself happy. Something will come up eventually.



It’s important not to put too much pressure on this kind of thing because it can lead to self sabotage.

u/thehumbleyellowonion is a perfect example of the kind of high horse bullshit that people hide behind (whether on purpose or not). When someone points out that thinking you’re right is not enough to justify your actions, people double down and say things like “You’re too uninformed about this subject,” aka “I’m right, you’re wrong, therefore I am justified.”

I understand that your point is that kids are already being ideologically brainwashed by mainstream media.

That’s all fine and dandy about Anarchism being community building and caring for each other. There’s a lot to break down there, but for the sake of my actual point, let’s say that’s exactly how a non-governmental society would play out.



The point is that kids don’t have to be exposed to either of the themes you are proposing. If I was to run a session for kids it would be along the lines of “an ancient evil darkness is rising from the depths of an ancient ruin and only your heroes can stop it from ending the world.” Kids can have a fun time in a fantasy setting as heroes defeating the darkness. I would have no need to explore imperialistic themes, just as there is a no need to expose them to anti-imperialist anarchist themes.



Regardless of the intent behind the action, the bottom line is that running a session for KIDS, with an ulterior motive of introducing any kind of ideology, is brainwashing.
