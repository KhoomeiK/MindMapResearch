UCSC,fouwf26,t1_foupinb,1588091512.0,Nah y‚Äôall are weird for trying to seek validation on Reddit I promise you no one cares how ‚Äúharder‚Äù your major is over others lol no ones laughing lmfaooooo get over it
UCSC,fot9bbd,t3_g9ejbm,1588047684.0," can we stop talking about what major is ‚Äúharder‚Äù and who ‚Äúdoes more work‚Äù when most of these arguments are of no substance and only surface level deep, all majors require specific skill and knowledge as well as interdependencies of other majors that facilitate work in other fields. Over it let people study what they‚Äôre good at and what they enjoy and stfu"

UCSC,fmxth1m,t3_fy10rz,1586471547.0,"As a person of color in the politics department, UCSC is definitely a predominately white institution and the politics in UCSC aren‚Äôt really as left as you might think, the more you try to get politically active it is made very clear. I have literally had white people talk over me during discussion and try to explain things to me about my culture and experiences. I do know we have a Black Student Union on campus, as well as an African American resource & cultural center which can help you get access to a lot of other resources. I‚Äôm not too aware of any Arab events/organizations other than Iranian Student Union and MSA but they aren‚Äôt the same /-: there is an ethnic student resource center you can look into always :) https://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu/ I still thoroughly enjoy being at UCSC for the most part, and some workshops pop up here and then about learning to take up space in white spaces, as well as others that have sorta made things a tiny bit more bearable. Also just keeping in mind that I am here for an education and it‚Äôs just one of the many obstacles poc have to face at UC‚Äôs. The politics department is amazing and all my professors have been decent, with a couple that stand out always as amazing. They are all caring, and there are many study abroad opportunities and a UCDC program that allows you to study in Washington DC :-)"
