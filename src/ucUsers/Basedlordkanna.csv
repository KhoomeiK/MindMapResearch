UCI,fp3yz78,t3_gb6bop,1588288457.0,Which professor?
UCI,fotfq0m,t1_foscank,1588052603.0,How has this affected your GRE plans? I was planning in taking a gap year too but I can’t gain much experience due to everything being shifted online
UCI,foot4z1,t3_g8la49,1587945908.0,"Hey I can help you out! I’m a graduating 4th year! Let me know if you wanna talk here or privately, but I’d like to ask, what do you have so far on your resume? That’ll help me gauge what you should work on :)"
UCI,fo9tife,t3_g6en4u,1587630617.0,"I applied 4 years ago and I’m now a fourth year bio major, I didn’t get in. Don’t know how things have changed but there’s were my stats:

4.32 gpa weighted, 3.85 unweighted, 2100 SAT (though I heard they didn’t look at your app if you didn’t surpass a certain score), volunteered at hospital for 1 year and letters of rec from my AP bio and AP chem teachers."
UCI,fo91nf5,t1_fo8zu6p,1587608520.0,"I graduate this year as well, but I am proud regardless. One step like this is reminder that we collectively can make change and to extend this beyond our student government"
UCI,fo8t01f,t3_g69d0l,1587603218.0,"I’m not sure how math will work online, but when I took math 2B, the final grades were curved based on different professors. I had one professor where I did not as good on my midterms compared to students from other professors who scored As on everything. In the end I ended up with a B+ despite getting B- and Cs on my midterms (though I did pretty good on the final) I hope this is the case for you because that’s straight up unfair and the two test taking methods are so different from each other. Good luck with the rest of this quarter op!"
UCI,fo14cu6,t1_fo11z38,1587425491.0,"Agreed, emailed her at the beginning of the quarter and she has yet to reply"
UCI,fnk2ga7,t3_g277ys,1587013034.0,I took it with Overstreet in the summer now a graduating 4th year. She is very strict about lab policies and requires that you have taken Bio 100 prior to the beginning of class (she asks for a transcript) as well as a passing grade in Bio 99.
UCI,fm9pvoj,t1_fm9p7v1,1585873895.0,Wow congratulations! Thanks so much!
