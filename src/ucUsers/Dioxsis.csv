berkeley,fpf3fio,t1_fperbig,1588560864.0,What‚Äôs with that I got waitlisted by both Irvine and LA but got into the rest of them
ApplyingToCollege,fpaulfj,t3_gc7fcm,1588456028.0,Damn I have imposter syndrome. I got accepted without even posting a meme!
StarWars,fp55ve7,t3_gbdhi8,1588317345.0,When you join this subreddit just to see everyone talking about how it‚Äôs not out yetüò©üòÇ
StarWars,fp55szq,t3_gbdjv4,1588317278.0,They‚Äôve ‚Äúshattered‚Äù my heart
ApplyingToCollege,fp4u3w2,t3_g9ci9q,1588307430.0,I couldn‚Äôt see the results. It told me I can only edit my response.
ApplyingToCollege,fp4ruk9,t1_fp4a2g0,1588305820.0,"Well since the ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù worked on most of the site, shouldn‚Äôt they have ownership of it? Any work created by the person is copyrighted and considering there was no contract, all the work done on the site is owned by the people who worked on it."
ApplyingToCollege,fp04ykk,t1_fozpbm5,1588202574.0,I don‚Äôt agree but I respect your opinion.
ApplyingToCollege,fozo7j6,t1_fozlh2h,1588193960.0,I think he‚Äôs talking about the seniors who are the seniors of college not high school right? Correct me if I‚Äôm mistaken.
ApplyingToCollege,fozo119,t1_fozluue,1588193873.0,"I still think it‚Äôll be unfair especially to those who have studied for the sat and have not taken it. Even though they won‚Äôt be sending the scores, they are still at a disadvantage because there will be people who get in over them with good test scores. So basically, testing becomes ‚Äúoptional‚Äù like those ‚Äúoptional‚Äù supplemental essays that people write for schools. Honestly, the best solution would be to remove test scores completely."
ArchitecturePorn,fozc3u8,t1_fowevwn,1588188168.0,Bradbury looks like an older Blackwell hall (the new Berkeley residence hall)
saxophone,forlrc6,t3_g92eer,1588014371.0,I think it‚Äôs a matter of breath support. Really practice long tones. This will improve your tone as well as your breath support.
ApplyingToCollege,fonx6be,t1_fon0d72,1587928228.0,It really isn‚Äôt. I got into Berkeley ENGINEERING (where the average admitted is 1560) with a 1480.
berkeley,fohnbha,t1_fohmj02,1587768886.0,"Haha nice. I didn‚Äôt apply cause I knew they weren‚Äôt giving me financial aid and I‚Äôd probably go to my state school. And they have like 11 essays you have to write which is insane. Anyways, I committed to Cal. Go bears!"
saxophone,fog4u9d,t1_fog4qvo,1587747902.0,I guess I got lucky.
saxophone,fog4oqy,t1_fofqacf,1587747844.0,Lmao wtf
saxophone,fog4b9c,t1_fofpok1,1587747697.0,I got my Yamaha soprano 475 on eBay for a good deal as well as a few mouthpieces. From my experience eBay is good if you find the right sellers.
berkeley,foenl6c,t3_g6z5f5,1587708751.0,"I got into Berkeley, and I didn‚Äôt even apply to Stanford, so jokes on them."
ApplyingToCollege,fodx0p9,t3_g6yy8j,1587691736.0,"There‚Äôs definitely going to be more waves, the comitt date hasn‚Äôt even happened yet and they may even get way more people than anticipated that decide that they don‚Äôt want to attend."
ApplyingToCollege,fodwi7g,t3_g6ylb9,1587691458.0,"I mean gaming is technically an extracurricular activity, but it‚Äôs one you shouldn‚Äôt put unless you‚Äôre a pro or a content creator üòÇ."
ApplyingToCollege,fodwbv7,t3_g6ylie,1587691361.0,"Even if you do end up having to explain this on the common app, I think your explanation was fair, reasonable, and understandable. You should definitely talk to your guidance counselor about the situation to get it off your record regardless. I think you‚Äôll be fine either way."
ApplyingToCollege,fo9hdhu,t3_g6gscn,1587619573.0,I think this is an easy choice tbh. For Vanderbilt you would be paying 100k less and I believe their premed is more well known.
ApplyingToCollege,fmx46e6,t3_fxxvok,1586458147.0,My friend sent one and the admission officer replied back.
Brawlstars,fmrlowj,t3_fwwnzm,1586327100.0,I like how supercell made frank‚Äôs grunts each for a different pitch.
ApplyingToCollege,fmrlil6,t3_fwvgzk,1586326935.0,Especially since I got into some schools with stats lower than the average. It‚Äôs crazy to think they liked me and admitted me for who I was and not for my stats.
saxophone,fmrkmrq,t1_fmrk8qe,1586326120.0,"Ok thank you for the advice. I never really thought about my articulation. I just listen to a lot of jazz and try to train my brain to have their style.So for 8th note measure would it go: T T S T S T S T
Tongue= T 
Slur=S"
saxophone,fmrb408,t3_fwzali,1586318285.0,Is it correct in terms of articulating the first 8th note of the paired 8th notes and then slurring the second 8th note of the pair?
saxophone,fmnr6wb,t1_fmn0ag4,1586233027.0,Pretty sure it is Allora‚Äôs professional model. Very good budget intermediate/professional sax I have one myself.
Jazz,fmf3smu,t3_fqwgaf,1586019359.0,I‚Äôm down. I can play alto and soprano sax.
