photography,fpir44k,t1_fpg6x8y,1588646846.0,Does this feature have a name?
photography,fpir1z6,t1_fpg5aqb,1588646809.0,"So this is weird. I tried the self timer release and it did take the bracketed images, just way too many of them. I went back to single shot and continuous shot and now it’s taking the bracketed images. It’s like shooting with the timer reset it or something. It was just taking 3 of the same photos before."
photography,fpiq6mz,t1_fpgryup,1588646271.0,All 3 images when shot are the exact same. They are not 3 images shot over the bracket.
photography,fpg4tgv,t1_fpg4qzk,1588594264.0,That gives you 3 photos with 3 different exposures?
photography,fpg40d3,t3_gd9l7f,1588593559.0,"I have a Canon Rebel SL1.

I have set up auto exposure bracketing in the plus 1 minus 1 range. Every time I take a picture I only get 1 photo instead of 3 photos. I’m expecting to have a photo on the meter and 2 others plus and minus 1 exposure. How do I set up my camera to do this?

I would like to do this so I can make an HDR image in Lightroom. I shoot in RAW format."
Veterans,fpg319m,t3_gd6z0b,1588592703.0,I’m in the exact same boat. If someone has an answer please let me know as well.
funny,fpbso85,t3_gcegtb,1588477731.0,I’m getting some Chris Farley vibes.
gaming,fp8zzwj,t1_fp8ypdj,1588409085.0,"You could make some comparisons. It’s sort of like both of those but also different. 

Cell phone game comparison is that you need to flow well by pumping which means you hold ‘a’ at the right times. 

Similar to trials in the way you can’t turn left or right and must flow a certain track. 

Difference is that it’s focused on doing tricks and accomplishing goals. Can get pretty hard and technical. But you do some pretty cool stuff and once you accomplish the goal it’s a rush."
UCSC,fp518c7,t1_fp507uw,1588313094.0,That’s some great advice. Thank you.
UCSC,fp4kzgw,t3_gb8091,1588301351.0,"Are people really using chegg for blatant plagiarism? So when they get through the class and move onto the next class they will be completely lost? And if they get through that and find a job and have no idea what’s going on, what will they do then?"
UCSC,fp45kdx,t1_fp3tze1,1588292127.0,"Taken from a question in the FAQ similar to mine:

“Yes, students unable to start during the fall 2020 term due to health issues, military service or COVID-19 restrictions on travel may request to defer their admission to the winter or fall 2021 term. To do so, please visit our appeals website and file a Miscellaneous appeal by the established deadline. Please note: Even if you defer your admission, you will still need to submit your online admission acceptance on my.ucsc.edu by May 1 (freshmen) or June 1 (transfers). “

So it appears that I wouldn’t be able to just because I want to."
scifi,fo8n06c,t1_fo8kgs4,1587599761.0,Damn good explanation. Thank you.
scifi,fo8bq3t,t1_fo7qpx9,1587593525.0,"That clears some stuff up. I’m still a bit hazy on the whole maze game plot. Does that have anything to do with what’s happening now? And why did Anthony Hopkins go out the way he did. How is that relevant to what’s happening now? 

Something about this season just makes most of the other seasons seem irrelevant."
scifi,fo7nvpc,t1_fo7amp9,1587581536.0,Can you explain to me how season 3 came about? It doesn’t seem to tie into how Westworld started at all.
ForzaHorizon,fnpvmnq,t1_fnolie8,1587152822.0,That’s disappointing. Hopefully they fix this on the next release.
politics,fnn5l8c,t3_g2lu07,1587084903.0,Why do they look like the white taliban?
EngineeringStudents,fmszow4,t1_fmszc4j,1586364531.0,I’m sure there are ways but the way he is doing it is by giving us 80 minutes to solve 3 free response questions and we just upload a pdf of our work before the time is up.
EngineeringStudents,fmsz4ht,t3_fx5exm,1586364273.0,My physics of electricity and magnetism midterm is stated as being closed notes and closed book. How in the hell is that possible when everyone is taking the test at home? The prof has to know people will be using notes for the test.
aesoprock,flhg4y7,t3_for9rp,1585161996.0,"These are super good. Hope this ends up on Spotify. Maybe some merch for King of World Peace.

Also...these are MP3's but I opened them in VLC and there are videos with them. I didn't think MP3's could do that."
