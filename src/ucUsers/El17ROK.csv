mountandblade,fnh6up3,t1_fnh6ny2,1586956279.0,I think we have a different definition of 'pausing during battle'.
mountandblade,fnh4hx0,t1_fnh3nqi,1586954625.0,I'm not sure how that's an issue. I'm saying it would be unrealistic to pause during combat.
mountandblade,fnh4akb,t1_fnh3oeo,1586954474.0,"You make a lot of good points at the end there with disabilities and such, but I stand by my point of pausing during battle being unrealistic.

The AI is stupider then real generals.

We use a mouse, arguably better then instruments.

They engaged after setting up the formation, which is *before* combat begins. I have nothing against that. Same with the other sentence, I'm not sure why you think I'm saying there shouldn't be a function where you calmly set up formation in a 'paused' setting before combat begins.

Show me a game that simulates medieval field battles more realistically than M&B."

mountandblade,fnh2qyb,t1_fnh28am,1586953282.0,"Let's clarify.

I'm saying that pausing *during combat* is unreasonable. Not setting up formations beforehand. 

I'm not sure what the big disagreement is here."
mountandblade,fnh2de4,t1_fnh21jr,1586952985.0,I think that ruins the feel of the game. The tactical choices you make should be under pressure and panic.
mountandblade,fnh26xy,t1_fnh2005,1586952841.0,"I'm assuming since you've played warband, you would know setting up formations to either attack or defend the opposition AI in  real time is a reasonable and possible thing to do.

The 'pressure' of decision making is a part of the gameplay."
mountandblade,fnh1uuh,t1_fnh1qt4,1586952561.0,"Of course, that would be unreasonable if it wasn't implemented. The comment I initially responded to was worded as if they wanted to pause during combat and make commands.

mountandblade,fnh1mx4,t1_fnh1j7o,1586952376.0,Before battle begins would be reasonable and I would be pissed if it wasn't in bannerlord.
mountandblade,fnh1e02,t1_fnh18d6,1586952163.0,I apologize for sounding douchy. I'm saying that whether your Genghis Khan or some village chief there isn't pausing during combat.
mountandblade,fnh135f,t1_fnh0z50,1586951908.0,Those are luxuries for Bretenwalda players. But would be great to have in bannerlord. Is that what they mean by 'pausing'?

mountandblade,fnh05d2,t1_fnh00yu,1586951080.0,Hours of preparation does not mean reorganizing your army during combat. Gotta do that in real time.
mountandblade,fnh014z,t1_fngzsha,1586950975.0,"Before battle begins, sure. But what you asked was during combat. No time for pausing then."

mountandblade,fngzeri,t1_fngyef9,1586950411.0,"No. But the real generals from history didn't, why can't you?

Edit: 'Pausing' before battle and setting up formation: already planned in the game.

Pausing *during* combat: go play total war.

Git gud.
