So if Nobodies do physically age, then why does Terra appear to not have aged when he gets his body back in KH3? If you separate the possessing Heart from the vuctim's body, does the victim return to the age they were at the initial time of possession? That's the only explanation I can think of in lieu of Nobodies not physically aging.

However, if the above new explanation is correct, then that leaves the issue of Luxu:

If Luxu was possessing bodies, and once he departs the bodies they regain their physical age and memories, then that means he left behind tons of people who knew who he was and what his plans were. So either he wiped their memories or killed them all."

Terra's body was taken over by Xehanort, who then made it into a Nobody (Xemnas). ~~My best guess is that Nobodies don't physically age.

Which would made sense, given that's when Terranort's plan to remake the World gets set in motion.~~ Terra was set back to his age upon being possesed. 

Ventus was left without a Heart in the Chamber of Waking in Castle Oblivion. So either a) a body without a Heart, where the Heart hasn't fallen to Darkness, doesn't age or b) there's something special about the Chamber of Waking that prevents Ventus from ageing.

So, uh, we know a lot of you haven't been very happy with Hanzo's last rework. So *swallow* we decided he needed another rework. But, don't worry, we were very conservative with the changes, and we think you'll really like them.

So the first thing is, his primary fire has been replaced by Storm Arrow, which is now on a 1 second cooldown. And now, each arrow, does, um a stun in addition to the full damage it normally does when ti hit you. 

Sonic Arrow now just activates Widow's ult, and it has a really cool new voice line. He says, uh, ""Oma wae, shindiru!"" So, we think you'll really be happy with that change.

Now, Sonic Arrow used to be an ability. So, in its place is a new ability called ""Nani?"". Basically it *nervously licks lips* is 
Genji's deflect, but it's an entire self Zarya bubble. It's a really cool ability that we really worked hard on. We think you'll really enjoy it.

Hanzo now has a new ability on his reload button. It's a single arrow on a 4 second cooldown, and basically, you kinda fire it at someone and if it hits them, it knocks them back. And the coolest part is, if they get pushed back into a wall, it's an instant death. So, yeah...

Now, a lot of you are probably asking, ""Well, Jeff, what about his Leap ability? Well... now Hanzo's Leap has been replaced with Pharah's boost. And the coolest part is, Hanzo now also has Hammond's Ground Pound, so we think you'll have a lot of fun with that. 

Now we saved the best for last. Hanzo's ultimate is basically still the same, except now it acts like Zarya's Grav, and sucks people who are close to it in. And because we found it to be on the weaker side, we're doing something new: we actually, um, put it on a 30 second cooldown. It's really satisfying to use, and we think you'll have a lot of fun with it.

So, thanks guys so much for, um, joining us today. We think you'll really enjoy the new Hanzo rework. And we can't wait to see you all accept your new weeabo overlord."""

The original TLOU was heavily carried by it's actors. If you simply read the script you'd probably notice the glaring plot hole in the ending.

But people loved it anyways for the characters, which speaks to the dialogue writing, actors, and animations."
UCDavis,fop2r32,t3_g8mq35,1587951796.0,"First day of classes, find the dude with the biggest, baddest bike. Tell him his bike is trash, and immediately start pummeling it. That way, everyone will know to respect you and not to fuck with you."
KingdomHearts,fop1djf,t1_fop0ho2,1587950934.0,"Seph is actually fairly easy in KH2. Start the match by spamming Triangle/Y, and when he lifts into the air for his Darkness thing simply jump up to him and hit him once to cancel that dangerous attack.

The Data battles vary in KH2. I've only beaten Data Marluxia.

LW is fucking insane, but can be cheesed.

BBS optional bosses are a bitch. 3D's only optional boss requires a cheese strat. KH3's optional bosses are very well designed but very tough."
KingdomHearts,foozpsk,t1_fooz0h9,1587949903.0,"Nothing wrong with the rest of the series, just better to play the rest of the games in the order I listed above. Mechanical feedback is important for developing empathy for characters in games, at least in my experience. And the games are mostly fun to play as well. 

I'd also recommend watching fights with optional bosses if you don't want to fight them yourself. All optional bosses seem to be canon, but some are more important than others."

Persona5,foowok0,t1_foowjij,1587948053.0,I completely forgot about that. That seems pretty clear then.

Persona5,foovnth,t3_g8gz67,1587947433.0,Was it ever explicitly confirmed Kamoshida raped anyone? Certainly felt like a heavy implication but the only thing I recall him confessing to was assault and battery and verbal abuse.
