AskReddit,fpmi8m7,t1_fplrf3z,1588733650.0,"Yeah, I minored in science education and majored in biology. I love the idea of teaching, but:

1. I've heard from my teacher friends that, even though they love the kids, admin/parents are a nightmare.
2. I'd have to pay to go back to school for at least a year.
3. I'd be taking a $30k/year paycut for the above privileges.

So that's gonna be a no from me, dawg."
AskReddit,fp8sey6,t1_fp8n37o,1588401447.0,"My friend drank a shitton of tea the day before and of her drug test and she tested negative - granted, she had smoked once a week before, and wasn't really a regular smoker, so there was probably very little in her system to begin with and her pee would have been very dilute due to all the liquid she was drinking."
UCSC,fp507uw,t1_fp4kzgw,1588312233.0,"I never cheated in my undergrad (both for ethical reasons and because I don't trust other random people to know the material better than me) but to be honest, there are some classes that I could have skipped entirely and it would have had no effect on my career success (and I work a fairly technical job in my STEM field). Random GEs/elective courses aside, I've not had to use the physics of electricity/magnetism ever, nor do I anticipate that I ever will, and that class was a bitch and a requirement for my major. 

That being said, I did cram quite a lot, and now I'm having to refresh myself on a lot of ochem/biochem for my current job. Fortunately, jobs aren't like school - I'm able to ask others who have more expertise and/or look things up whenever I want.

I think a big problem is that university courses are often taught in such a way that the implicit goal of the class is to achieve a good grade, rather than actually learning/retaining/using the material. I think many universities also do a poor job of teaching students how to apply the information they're learning (though I've seen slow shifts in the right direction in the last few years). I was very good at memorizing information/learning how to solve problems for a test, but I've only retained the stuff I was either very interested in or that I use often. 

A little side advice: if you're an undergrad in biology/chemistry, take a lot of labs/practical courses!! Get involved in a research lab on campus - write a thesis if you can. That's the stuff that matters when you've graduated. If you graduate having only gone to class you will have an extremely difficult time finding jobs after you graduate, even if you got amazing grades. A lot of students don't figure this out until it's too late."

 I'm now thinking that I misinterpreted it. I 100% agree with you, we cannot allow ourselves to have collective amnesia when it comes to domestic abuse just because it was perpetrated by somebody famous."
todayilearned,fosusx1,t1_foss8wg,1588038490.0,"Why do you need to specify this?

Edit: Just to clarify, I thought the original commenter was implying that because he hit her with his hand, it wasn't that bad/big of a deal, which I took issue with. I'm now thinking I misinterpreted it. My bad."

My SO and I just moved down here (I got a new job here, his family lives here) and is it a bummer that we haven't been able to enjoy the things that we were excited to move to San Diego for? Of course! But that's how it goes. We don't live within walking distance of any trails so we've just been content to walk around our new neighborhood."

running,fo7bqc8,t3_g5qxej,1587575625.0,"For those of you who have experienced tendinitis on the outside of your ankle, what exercises/stretches/etc. worked for you?

I ran my first half marathon on March 1st. While I hit my goal, my ankle didn't love the uneven race course (had never had any issues with my ankle prior to this), and I experienced some pain/discomfort on the outside of my ankle in the week or two after. Since the injury seemed minor (no swelling or stiffness, could walk on it fine) and I intended to take a break from running anyway, I didn't immediately seek out medical attention. It was still somewhat bothering me and I thought about going to my PT, and then coronavirus happened.

Now almost 2 months later, it feels fine 95% of the time (a little uncomfortable if I'm going up/downstairs repeatedly), and I even went on my first run since the half today (I lost a crazy amount of fitness lol), but I want to make sure I don't aggravate it as I get back into running. I'm also a climber and I want to make sure my ankle's in tip-top shape whenever climbing gyms re-open around here.

Thanks in advance!"

Regardless, I'd talk to a medical professional."
todayilearned,fo3i7sg,t1_fo2zg8y,1587487331.0,Interesting. My boyfriend's last name is Goldberg so his family got a free copy of the pilot episode in the mail (assuming they did this with all Goldbergs) but they never actually watched it because it didn't look good.
AskReddit,fngb42y,t1_fnf2k16,1586926979.0,"Not OP but my dentist gave me a little device that's basically a plastic handle attached to a little rubber head that's shaped like a cone. You use the pointy part of the cone to get between your teeth and ""toughen"" your gums (my gums used to always bleed when getting my teeth cleaned or flossing/brushing too hard).

That being said, I always used it in conjunction with, not instead of, floss."
Jokes,fnfawd5,t1_fnf6a88,1586904625.0,"Yeah I'll only tip more than $1 a drink if it's a fancy cocktail at a more upscale location, if it's a beer or a basic cocktail (i.e. two ingredients and a garnish) I'm generally tipping $1 (which usually works out to 15-20%).

I imagine this might be different if you live in a very high cost of living area where drinks are typically more expensive, like New York or San Francisco.

Edit: I'll also tip more than a $1 if the service is great or I'm at one of my favorite breweries or something, but that's irrelevant to this particular scenario."
AskReddit,fmp0t4t,t1_fmous1b,1586272228.0,"I mean it sounds like you just really hate the idea of it, in which case it would make sense that it would hurt for you (or conversely, if it's always painful for you, it makes sense that you'd hate it). You're not obligated to find a way to like it, that's totally fine! Just don't shit on other people for enjoying it."
AskReddit,fmnsncd,t1_fmlsqar,1586234159.0,"As an anxious person, I've definitely worried myself over things that didn't matter, and even when you know you're being irrational it's hard to not worry.

If she can't/won't get help from a therapist, there are some other things that might help. As others have mentioned, maybe encourage her to do something artistic (maybe suggest it as an activity that you guys could do together). If she's into a certain tv show/band/book series, maybe encourage her to seek out other fans online, to help her get some kind of social interaction. 

Even though her worries are frustrating, it's extremely unhelpful to tell the other person that the thing they're worrying about isn't a big deal. Often times the other person knows this. You can try to rationalize with them to a certain extent but don't be dismissive. You have to listen, maintain that you're there for them, and try to empathize with what they're feeling without necessarily validating their fears. If this gets to be too much (i.e. if you're the primary person she talks to) you need to maintain boundaries. I.e. ""I understand that you're worried about x right now, and I am sorry, but I need to take some space to myself so that I can continue to be there for you.""

None of this is easy, but it does help."
AskReddit,fmnq7c7,t1_fmnlajn,1586232271.0,"It really shouldn't hurt - barring something medical going on, the primary reason why it might be painful for someone is a lack of arousal/foreplay. 

If you don't like it, that's totally fine, but a lot of women do (myself included). It's not chill to make generalizations based solely on your own opinions and experiences, especially when it comes to female sexuality."
AskReddit,fmklrir,t1_fmjr5a6,1586159414.0,"That's too bad, but recognizing you have a problem and thinking about getting help is a good first step. Now you just need to follow through. 

My good friend's mom has some of the worst anxiety I've seen (and I myself have had anxiety for my whole life). It's to the point where she behaves extremely irrationally over minor things and it really takes a toll on the family, even though her kids love her and try to be understanding. My friend dreads going home for Thanksgiving and Christmas partially because of it (her dad is also really unsupportive and impatient when it comes to his wife's anxiety, which makes it worse). I don't say this to scare you, but I've seen what happens when a family member with severe anxiety doesn't get help for a really long time."
