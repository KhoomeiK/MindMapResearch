VALORANT,fp5oouy,t1_fp5o1f8,1588336157.0,"Fair point, it's more that I'm confused where Riot's priorities are. Afterburner/the other OC software they're targeting is critical software, disabling them can cause shut downs/overheating in some instances.


Let's be honest, they already have level 0 access, the highest possible level of access. Do they really need to start blocking all these programs that a lot of us use every day? Like there has to be tens of thousands of people this is affecting. Is there really no other way of going about it?"

VALORANT,fp5lwoh,t1_fp5j5v3,1588333856.0,"Oh man that's really rough.

  


I'm fine with Riot blocking unsecure software, but if they're gonna block vital system programs then we at least need a list of alternative software that meets their requirements. 

  


Right now they're blocking MSI Afterburner as well as the Gigabyte equivalent software. Is EVGA's OC software safe by Riot's standards? They need a list (not sure who to @ valorant devs)"

buildapc,fonysn2,t3_g7wdrq,1587929141.0,">Will a 2060 Super with i5-9600k be bottlenecked in any way? Planning to OC CPU

It won't bottleneck it, especially if overclocked

>Mainly going for the ROG STRIX card for reliability & quietness. Any other comparable recommendations?

ROG STRIX cards are pretty good in terms of temps/acoustics, maybe take a look at Gigabyte/EVGA if you want to consider other options

>When overclocking this CPU, is a premium fan necessary or is something like a Dark Rock Slim CPU cooler of 185W TDP efficient enough to cool it?

Yeah but you might not get a high OC out of it (not 100% sure). Take a look at the Scythe Ninja 5 if you want to save a bit on the cooler compared to the Noctua (although the Noctua is a bit better)

>Prefer to have a semi modular PSU but the MSI MPG mobo seems to need an additional 4pin power connector according to pcpartpicker. Can anyone recommend one that supports it? Having trouble finding one (80+ Gold pref)

Where'd you see that?"
GlobalOffensive,fo7txjr,t1_fo7rsb3,1587584487.0,"Realistically there could be exploits out right now that aren't publicly known. If someone really wanted to, they could find an exploit, not announce the fact that they found it, and basically have free access to an RCE until valve finds out.

Fortunately though most people aren't assholes and report these exploits to valve/post them on twitter when they find them instead of secretly using them."
