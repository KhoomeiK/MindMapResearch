news,fohj9sr,t1_fogzokl,1587766890.0,"Reinstating him sounds good. But like. Honestly dude, the last thing you want is sailors and soldiers with undying loyalty to their generals and admirals. 

Maybe the case is less so for admirals but soldiers with loyalties to generals rather than the state is a very bad idea. During the late roman republic, soldiers often followed the orders of their generals rather than done their duty to the republic and that helped lead to its collapse. 

Counter point is that during the communist revolution in russia, sailors mutinied against their commanding officers if they did not support the greater Bolshevik cause. In this case, having loyal sailors would be beneficial if the captain of the ship is loyal to the state. 

Not saying don't reinstate him to the ship. I'm highly in favor of having competent leadership who cares about their soldiers rather than caring about their ranks but just food for thought"
