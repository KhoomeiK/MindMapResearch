insurgency,foah6od,t1_foafzja,1587646442.0,"Look dude I'm not gonna write a fucking essay but that just goes without showing how much this game is fucked you need to go this far out of your way to defend it.  I'm not a fortune teller but I do learn from history and you tell me this isn't a repeat of Ins2014 and DoI ? How about NWI properly manage their EXPECTATIONS before handling a major project ?

They aren't triple A which is why people expect a certain level of care and connection with the community with which this game severely lacks.  Tell that to the 6,500 players that left and convince them to come back.  You can't.

Spearin was also committed to his work as an original developer of Ins.. I wonder where he is now ?  Like the players that left onto better things most likely.

I do appreciate the change..which is why I said I'm happy console players are feeling the excitement, just they should be cautious with their purchase"
insurgency,foadu7s,t1_foacyz5,1587645049.0,"PC players were treated like beta testers and many of the main issues this game has are still rampant hence the drop from 8k at launch to 1.5k daily now.  People simply got tired of it. This game was never triple A, never stood a chance and with CoD on consoles this opportunity is even lesser. Player numbers will drop and NWI will move onto their next venture.  My hopes for this game's future are low."
insurgency,foacrck,t3_g66jyg,1587644514.0,I'm glad console players can feel the same excitement for the game as I did pre launch.  Let's see if the disappointment is the same too

insurgency,fn1up85,t1_fn1hwsl,1586570548.0,Wow..you just played yourself.ü§°The reason they are offering more sales and free weekends are to generate more sales WITHOUT actually doing anything.  The game is still a complete shit storm..just like how they released it lmao
insurgency,fn0y5rl,t1_fn0fd7m,1586551041.0,They‚Äôre much more interested in faster ways of swindling us of our money with as least work as possible.  PASGT w/ goggles would get in the way of that.

Like how does Ministry perform so terribly ? Look at those cars in the back lots.."
