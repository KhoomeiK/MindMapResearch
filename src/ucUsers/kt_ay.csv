CoronavirusUS,fp07ja4,t1_foyt6xf,1588203949.0,"I already feel the effects of this yo-yoing. In the beginning of this I went to bed knowing that more bad news would be airing the next morning. And now I feel like the news is giving us glimpses of hope, with stories of heroism and generosity and lower death tolls. But now we're reopening and here comes more tragic stories. I don't get emotionally distraught easily yet I feel like I'm holding my breath each day anxious if I'm going to hear news of hope or horror and it's exhausting."
