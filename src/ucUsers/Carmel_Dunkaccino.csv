AmItheAsshole,fpj1qba,t1_fpizzk5,1588654180.0,"They rescued the cat though so the cat was already out there and needing to eat meat as cats do. The owners of the cat are still vegan because they are not eating meat/using animal products, and they are not breeding/buying cats from breeders. If they were then the argument could be made that they are contributing to an industry that does create an increase in the need for meat, however, they did not do that they rescued a cat. So if they care for it or someone else, or even if it is let out into the wild it will need meat, they are using throw away parts of the chicken that will be produced regardless and they are giving it to a cat that will need the meat regardless of if they own the cat or not."
AmItheAsshole,fpj0wpt,t3_gdktg8,1588653575.0,for sure NTA even if it was meat that people would eat cats are carnivores and should be carnivores and its great that you recognize that its ok to feed your animals a diet that you wouldn't eat because they aren't humans
