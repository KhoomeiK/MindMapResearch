UCSC,fp7pdij,t3_gbqca8,1588375059.0,"Took Math 100 with Frank Baurle, it was basically just CE16 but with more writing from what I understood. Material was fairly straight forward, ya know basic proofs, proof by contradiction, induction, e.t.c. Also gives a nice reintroduction to set theory. Not really much to get the jump on, unless you wanna get into the thick of doing proofs already."
UCSC,fp3b9nc,t3_gb29bn,1588276307.0,"The colleges don't really matter, most of your classes will be in CU2, Thimann, ,Humanities or b206  your freshman year. I'd just look at the map and pick whatever's closest to those lecture halls, which just so happens to be C9/C10. The only one I probably wouldn't pick is Porter and Crown. Crown because it's a shitty living QOL, and Porter because for some reason people don't know how to use bathroom according to reddit lmfao."
UCSC,fozx2xa,t1_fozsc2g,1588198406.0,"Yes, but obviously we're not talking about qualified candidates because at that point the degree IS pointless. There's a reason why people with 50 years of electrician experience are more capable than the recently graduated EE bachelors. If that was the point of your entire argument, that's facetious as all hell. 

>their degree but on their skills and to top it off a lot of what is taught at least in CS or otherwise is years behind industry standard

Also lmao, CS is one of the literal only degree that's 100% obtainable by being a basement coder, and I never said otherwise. That's just school though unfortunately, school as a whole CAN'T teach you industry level material because it's too hard. People on here com and complain about EE171 like it's difficult, that's a single transistor. A simple CMOS battery that's used in just about every computer has multiple, hell your phone has thousands in it, and we're gonna go and work on them. That's the nature of school, it gives you the useless easy bits so you can try and apply it to the big problem by breaking it down into the easy bits and working back up. 

Pretending like the material taught in school prepares you for industry is facetious at best, but it teaches you skills that many fresh HS graduates don't have. Which is time management, problem solving, and maturity through the nature of growing through college. This doesn't apply to people with GEDs though since many of them come from different backgrounds and typically get the GED as a form of fixing their fuck ups, but ya know that's beside the point still probably not as qualified regardless."
UCSC,fozli0u,t1_foxhkcu,1588192659.0,"Well you're wrong first of all, if I applied to an intro position my degree definitely carries more weight than a highschool diploma LOL. The 2nd half is sort of why that's the case. 

Second of all, if your degree hasn't been a waste, even though I don't retain everything I still remember a fairly decent amount of theory moving forward. Plus it's much easier to brush up on a topic then it is to learn a whole new topic, and let's not pretend like recruiters don't know that lol."

I don't know the structure of the current professor's class, nor the rigor, but let's not pretend like Larabee wasn't more than kind in structuring her class. It was not made to be a VERY difficult class, but that was how she structured it, I could easily see Martine Shlag making this class hell, idk if she did, but I could see it."
leagueoflegends,fow622b,t1_fow0akp,1588113681.0,Holy shit you're actually so dumb it hurts lmfao. Yea having multiple opinions is a good thing glad we're on the same page and you see the value of having both the coach and the pro players opinions you mook.

leagueoflegends,fouudrt,t1_fou5fxw,1588090558.0,"What? If it's good advice you take good advice. That's like deadlifting like a cat, someone tell you your lifts super fucked, and the dude scoffing because ""paahh I'm lifting double what he does"". This is a professional career, if you can't inherently respect the criticism without knowing the source then you probably have other much larger trust and communication issues manifesting already. Also Dodo is a previous LCS player and is still challenger? Dude knows the game lol. It ain't the days of coach Steve who was hard stuck plat. He's not getting criticism from some random silver, he's getting criticism from a colleague. These aren't friends, these aren't ya bois, they can be don't get me wrong, but they're your colleagues. They are working in the same field, alongside you, if you can't assume they're just as competent as you you're either 1. A jackass or 2. Overqualified.  Doublelift is definitely not over qualified lol."

UCSC,fofyxyy,t1_fofv31u,1587745254.0,">You clearly don't understand the point I'm making. You are giving a specific random stranger, the person proctoring you, all your information in a single second. Even if that information is available online, it takes more than a second to get it. My main point wasn't about the company having it, but an unvetted stranger.

No I've clearly stated I understand what you're saying. You're just incapable of understanding that it's irrelevant lol. 

>People who are smart enough not to list their address online typically also make the effort to not post photos, videos, or text with that information.

That's just not true lmfao. You post a picture AT ALL and you can trace it back. If you have IG, Facebook, Snapchat, let's not pretend like it's not SO easy to trace people if you want. I don't think you understand how obnoxiously little you need for this information to be compromised."
UCSC,foftym0,t1_fofq28p,1587742773.0,">Also, yes I'll agree that most people aren't super strict about monitoring their information that's put online,

You can do a lot of things to minimize, yes, and ProctorU is bad, but my point is most of the information they're retrieving is most likely already there. Because it is. 

>but most people are smart enough to not throw out so much information that you could know their exact address.

It's not by brains that people's privacy is comprised because that's irrelevant, it's entirely effort lol. Which most people don't want to put forth because it's actually quite a lot of effort. Hence why any information ProctorU is stealing is almost certainly already easily farm able if someone was trying to steal it. Hell, it's probably already being swapped around as we speak."
UCSC,fofownt,t1_fofn8dq,1587740192.0,"Yes, I recognize this by including myself. I am in the majority here. Although,

Let's not pretend like anyone with a smartphone that they haven't built their own OS for isn't inherently at risk privacy wise. But if you're at that point then this conversation was never relevant to you in the first place lol. In fact, I would wager that the vast majority don't even consider monitoring their own information beyond not giving away their credit card or social security information."

UCSC,fofmcas,t1_foe4exz,1587738825.0,"Eh you act like that information isn't publically available already, or at least fairly easy to find if someone was actually interested in my info. I actually considered how easy it would be to pinpoint who I am without any knowledge, and you can actually get within like a 200 person margin just by digging through my comments on Reddit lol. Most people, myself included, don't frequently monitor our security. Most of that info is probably already in the hands of some untrustworthy stranger."

news,fmtp7nu,t1_fmtm64s,1586376616.0,">What are they? How do you know they don't account for them? The results can be explained by lack of follow-through with voting.

Honestly, I presume they do account for them and the lack of follow-through with voting is one of the biases inherent to this problem actually.

>Why don't you make your own competing service that gives more accurate polls? Easy money there.

I don't even understand this. The very fact that it's not done perfectly IMPLIES that's it's a VERY non-trivial problem."
news,fmt9kh2,t1_fmt64wd,1586369051.0,"You act as if those data sets adequately represent the voting population, hint, they don't. We can take SSR data samples and have it be a decent representation if we remove the confounding variables/biases inherent to this poll, but as you're clearly seeing this isn't note worthy statistical data.

As a young-in who's only lived through 4, soon to be 5, and can only remember 4/5 elections, polling is consistently not a good representation of the voter population and thus the outcome is wrong."
APStudents,fmqpjc5,t1_fmqkns2,1586304315.0,"That's not true at all lol. Most of my college exams have been an hour and roughly 5-7 FRQ questions with maybe some MC sprinkled in for midterms. While finals tend to be anywhere from 7-15 FRQ and maybe some MC just a few more than on the midterm. 

I'll give you a hint now, if you intend on doing any form of engineering, math or physics you will almost certainly feel the time crunch on exams in college. 45 minutes for 2 questions? Well that's just about par for the course here if not generous. Don't get me wrong, it's not really that bad. 

Also the experimental designs don't necessarily train you to think like an actual physicist. Many go purely theoretical, in fact iirc applied physics isn't actually the most popular wing. Running joke is the theoretical physicists are just scared of oscilloscopes and DMMs lol. Regardless I imagine whatever design intuition you're building from the AP test is bad design intuition anyways. To really get that intuition and think like a physicist you need to be hands on in the lab designing things through iteration and theoretical application."

LivestreamFail,fmphekz,t1_fmpc8dd,1586280877.0,"This all relies on like one important thing. It's fun. We literally don't know if it is or isn't, and no watching streams doesn't give you a decent feel for that at all. Furthermore, the success of League was because it basically curated a genre. Now that's where CS has a MASSIVE upper edge. The people who want gameplay that's barebones, with an insanely high skill ceiling are the ones who are targeted by CS. Yet, it's still made such a large presence even to casual players.  This longevity and fluidity in the game is what's ultimately important. If Valorant pulls an OW where everyone was hyped as fuck about it on release then dropped it after half a year because it got boring, I wouldn't be too surprised. Even though I expect Riot to update the game more faithfully than Blizzard ever could. That's not to say OW is dead, it's more so saying OW didn't turn out how it was expected."

Logical fallacy = faulty logic. Thus, due to the fact that you clearly incorporate these into your argumentation, your logic is faulty. You should consider learning literary devices and terms before you lecture someone on faulty logic lol."
