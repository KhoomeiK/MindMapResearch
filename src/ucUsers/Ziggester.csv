UCSantaBarbara,fokh4br,t1_foiplws,1587841959.0,"Hey! Second-year Chemistry major here who also had the terribly tough choice of deciding between SB and Cal. I remember reading a study that students that turned town UPenn for PSU have the same career opportunities/salary results as those who go to UPenn, the point here being that you'll be fine at either, so **your decision should be based on where you can fully utilize the resources presented to you for your growth and success**, whatever that means for you. I ended up going with SB due to the collaborative environment and undergrad-focused nature of UCSB (9:1 undergrad:grad ratio). There are definitely times where I miss the prestige of Cal, but I love the interdisciplinary-ness of research, friendliness of students/profs, and overall student life at SB. You'll be equally fine at either, so pick where will push you to be your best self/give you room to grow both personally and career-wise. Good luck with your choice!"

UCSantaBarbara,foef5p8,t1_fo8uynf,1587702261.0,"Chem here is really great IMO—many of the professors are very knowledgeable (as expected) and invested in student success. Our chem research is strong and varied, and our interdisciplinary  research in general is notably amazing (e.g. materials). For instance, my bio major friend is working in a physics lab on hypothetical space travel. There are plenty of research opportunities at SB especially compared to other universities, especially given the high undergrad:grad ratio. Feel free to PM me if you have any additional questions!"
UCSantaBarbara,foeewux,t1_fo8z78u,1587702097.0,"1. I don't really hear people getting bored at UCSB—there's always something to do, whether on-campus student activities or exploring the surrounding areas. Plenty of amazing hikes and restaurants, plus downtown is pretty fun to roam especially when you first get here. IV is always super lively and is amazingly fun to even just go hang out in.
2. I feel that a lot of professors here are legitimately invested in their students success, and that's a great source of support within programs. Of course, there's a few less stellar professors every now and then, and though it may be intimidating to approach professors for advice/help, I have found them to be very responsive and helpful with confusion/academic advice.
3. Research at UCSB is easier to obtain than at other institutions especially given the high undergrad:grad student ratio. This does not mean research is guaranteed—you absolutely must find research in an area you're passionate in, as professors can see if you're looking for a resume padder or are genuinely interested in x science. There are plenty of hospitals around (Cottage and Sansum are big ones) with huge volunteer programs—these are often starting points for volunteering. Programs such as Partners in Wellness and SB Street Health are great to join and give you more experience inside health-related endeavors. I do have friends that are scribes or MAs at local clinics and hospitals, so that's definitely a possibility. We don't have a hospital associated with UCSB unlike many of the other UCs, but there are definitely plenty of medicine related extracurriculars."
UCSantaBarbara,foee8mp,t1_foc60l4,1587701650.0,"Chemistry here is very solid. Research is accessible for undergrads due to the low undergrad:grad faculty ratio. Professors are very approachable and understanding for the most part. A huge standout for UCSB is the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of all the research especially due to the logistics of having a smaller campus. Notably, our materials program is top 3 if you're into that side of chemistry as well."

UCSantaBarbara,fo3xwpu,t1_fo25yph,1587494819.0,"There's no actual difference other than you'll be living around a lot of other Honors or Regents people. Anecdotally, I lived on a scholars floor and really liked it it. Our floor had a pretty tight-knit feel and the lounge was always poppin with people studying and/or socializing. This is not necessarily the same for each scholars floor, keep that in mind. Plenty of people in our floor also were not in the honors program, so you should be able to  live on the scholars floor with the roommate you found!"

UCSantaBarbara,fnyajk8,t1_fnv1vaw,1587357581.0,"I wouldn't worry about if you have to random, Anecdotally, I randomed my first year and I loved it. Most people I know who randomed felt the same way. If you do find yourself in a horror movie, the dorms are pretty accommodating with switching your rooms as long as you find someone willing. My friend was even able to switch out of their room because their roommates were playing League too late at night."
ApplyingToCollege,fny4hvt,t1_fny0bcg,1587353203.0,"Hey! Speaking from experience, LA/Irvine is a 2-3 hour drive if you don't leave during rush hour. It's not close enough that you can go to LA and back for a nice Friday night dinner date, but you definitely can have a daytrip to LA. I actually drove down and back the same night for a concert, and I went to Irvine with friends to have an all-day Asian food marathon. While many students do have cars starting sophomore year, it is rarer for freshman to bring their cars unless they plan on going home often (freshman parking permit is pretty expensive, 800 something per quarter??) but a great thing is RIDESHARES! You can pay ~$20 to hitch a ride with a fellow UCSB student to the Bay or LA or wherever. The only thing is you need to find a rideshare back, so people usually Rideshare to go back home or visit friends at other unversities as most rideshares leave friday and drive back sunday—perfect if you have a place to stay but not optimal for day trips. There's a facebook group for finding rideshares. There's also buses and amtrak that run to socal/etc, but I don't have a lot of experience with those. One of my roommates did frequently take the bus for cheap to visit his girlfriend at CSU CI.

On the issue of surrounding area, SB does not have any ""huge city"" feel area around it. Downtown is pretty popping, but nothing's over 3 stories. A huge variety of restaurants and shops, but no massive malls etc (some strip malls but that's about it). I found a pretty good video showcasing downtown, [feel free to watch if you want.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w4eMZuljJE) The closest massive city is LA, but Oxnard/Ventura do have a more substantial downtown if you have a car and want to drive 40 mins. They also have a popeyes, soooo....

TLDR: LA is not terribly far if you want to have fun there. SB itself is lively but isolated from a big city feel. Plenty to do downtown though.

Do feel free to DM me with any additional questions/clarifications you might want answered—hope this helps!"

ApplyingToCollege,fmmqvkp,t1_fmmll8y,1586210346.0,"Yoyo I'm actually from the San Jose area myself  :,) as you probably know, UCSB has a smaller Asian population than any other UC. While this may seem like a downside, it means the cultural clubs are SUPER close knit. The main ones I know of include: Taiwanese American Student Association (TASA), Hong Kong Student Association (HKSA), Korean American Student Organization (KASA), South East Asian Union (SEAU), Kapatirang Pilipino (KP). I have friends that help in managing TASA, KASA, and SEAU—PM me if you want me to connect you with them. Each one has its own social scene (SEAU does a bunch of outreach, KASA is pretty famous for its parties, TASA has great food nights, etc) and you do NOT have to belong to the respective ethnicity in order to join one. I'd highly encourage checking maybe 2 or 3 out and seeing which one sticks best with you. In general with UCSB, I haven't heard any legitimate complaints from friends about diversity with regards to Asian culture. Greek culture is definitely more of a white public space, but there's some Asian-oriented greek life as well if you want that brotherhood/sisterhood (Pi Alpha Pi fraternity aka Pineapples, Sigma Kappa Chi sorority). It's definitely not the case that people feel excluded or uncomfortable in general for being Asian at UCSB.  


As for Asian food around IV..... thats a different story LOL traditionally IV was desolate of good Asian food (used to frequent Panda Express for my cravings), but it's really stepped its game up in the past year. Von's Korean fried chicken, Naan Stop, Sizzling Lunch, and Mojo's Teahouse, and some poke places are all pretty solid places for grabbing Asian food. Be warned though, if you're interested in boba specifically, Mojo's is your best bet, Naan Stop being second. I learned the hard way. In the surrounding area, there's some solid Pho and Thai places (also Nikka ramen is hella good), but if you don't have a car, it might take a bit to bus there and back."
