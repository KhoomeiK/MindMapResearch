PoliticalCompassMemes,fnmeojg,t1_fnm9wp0,1587070073.0,"No one's saying cities are perfect blended societies, but if you go downtown in many cities, there's going to be a good amount of diversity. The area I live in is very diverse, and white(myself and most of my social group) people don't seem to have a problem ""living with brown people"". It's disingenuous to say ""tolerant"" people who are around ""brown"" people will become racist, when a lot of ""tolerant"" people just don't put that much judgement into how much melanin is in someone's skin. I don't have an issue with cultures(white cultures included) choosing to live together because they feel more comfortable, but having a blanket hatred of ""brown people"" is just being a snowflake. This sub is going downhill if serious racist posts are being upvoted. You can want an enthostate to preserve your culture instead of a hate for ""brown people"""

You’re basically arguing she should let Joe continue to breed and abuse tigers because he’d have to give away the tigers to potentially worse homes. That’s such a terrible take.

NoStupidQuestions,fmsgxoi,t1_fmrpbcv,1586355245.0,"Yup, people tend to think that someone with specialized/niche knowledge is smart. If you want to seem smart just learn some math about a topic that sounds cool like the curvature of the universe. Bonus points if you bring up the names of formulas. Seriously, watch a YouTube video and look at the Friedmann Equation and try to talk to people about it. Even if you botch some details, no one would know. Be warned tho, people who bring stuff like that up in random conversations look like tools."

I feel like it’s pretty obvious her husband was doing some shady fucking shit, and the documentary made it seem more plausible she killed him bc it made it more interesting. Also his lawyer was idiot. But Carol was the only cat owner in the show that cared about her cats and didn’t abuse workers."
