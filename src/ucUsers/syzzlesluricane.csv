UCSantaBarbara,fp00zmn,t3_gad7tb,1588200455.0,This was my first thought too as a plus sized girl. Honestly being surrounded by a lot of fit can be intimidating sometimes but honestly no one cares. I was sooo worried I wouldnâ€™t get let into parties because of it or even just so nervous to go to the beach. No one has ever said anything to me before. Trust me the only person that cares is you.
