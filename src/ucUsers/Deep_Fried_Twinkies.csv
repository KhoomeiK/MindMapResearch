ABoringDystopia,fonpprv,t1_foketh4,1587924058.0,"Every minute you're alive you're at risk of death. Sometimes that risk can be mitigated, but you have to determine if it's worth what it does to your life, and at the policy level the lives of others. Should we ban fatty foods because it causes heart disease? Should we enforce wearing seatbelts? Should we make everyone inject estrogen to make them less violent? Should we make everyone take a CPR class? Should we ban all construction jobs? Should we ban peanuts in public places to protect the allergic?

Each of these measures to some degree disrupts people's lives, but saves lives in the process. Why don't we do all of them? Because some are simply not worth it from a standpoint of life disrupted vs. lives saved. 

A global lockdown is an incredibly drastic measure taken at a dire time. The simple fact is, people will die when the lockdown is lifted. But it will have to be lifted eventually. And as now information comes to light and the situation unfolds, a call to unlock things will need to be made."

AskReddit,fnnzd41,t1_fnnf3b2,1587106581.0,"In 5th grade I was getting along with this guy in the grade below, call him Carl. We weren't the best of friends but I would go over to his house sometimes and we'd hang out. Lost touch over the summer, 6th grade rolls around and he's not there, I ask around and a few kids from his grade say Carl died of a brain aneurysm over the summer. I heard it from multiple people so I believed it. Was sad for a while. 

Approximately 5 years later, I see Carl at the grocery store. I was like ""what the fuck dude, I thought you died of a brain aneurysm?!""

Then it occurred to me that I'd been pranked. They got me good, I'll admit. Too bad I lost him as a friend though, he'd just switched schools."
