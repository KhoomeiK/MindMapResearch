UCSD,fncgr6g,t1_fnbm9dm,1586836357.0,"It’s reading heavy, but the textbook is pretty readable, so it’s not bad- you don’t have to double back to understand what’s going on. Also, the midterm is broken into three mini-midterms that are 15% of the grade each making it a bit less stressful!"
UCSD,fnb5188,t3_g0oibd,1586809334.0,"Poli 104D- Judicial Politics- is only Monday nights and I really like it! Not an overwhelming amount of work, in my opinion. 

Also! Poli 130AA- The Soviet Successor States- super enjoyable and interesting material. Only thing is that he records his lectures so you have to watch them outside of class time, but he keeps them under an hour.   

(Also, I’m in 150A too, and can I just say he’s a spectacular professor?)"
Hozier,fn7q39w,t3_fzzpyt,1586725346.0,"Take Me to Church holds a dear place in my heart. And I also love how unique it was, almost as if carving out its own genre. 

BUT I think his other works deserve more recognition and attention, mainly because I don’t even think Hozier’s hit his peak yet."

Man, this is all I want outta life now."
UCSD,fn28oq8,t3_fyvuh2,1586580998.0,"I feel this. What’s happening is that they have a complete disconnect of their reality vs ours. 

It’s difficult for me because I’m an essential worker plus I’m taking five classes this quarter. I think they think that since we’re in quarantine, we automatically have time. But they don’t seem to consider some of us work, that we have other classes, that we may have kids at home, we may be taking mental health hits from it all, and that we may not have stable internet connection. The absolute disconnect is astonishing."

greysanatomy,fmszv44,t3_fwv86g,1586364609.0,"I think Amelia is absolutely spectacular and I think the reason people find her irritating because she’s so human. She’s irrational, stubborn, and a recovering addict. She makes no sense sometimes and that’s just how people are. 

Also- Teddy being bisexual made me so happy. It may have seemed out of nowhere, but it made sense. Her sexuality isn’t her whole personality. It is just part of her. So often we see characters (not Grey’s in particular) discovering their sexuality and it becoming their whole character. Idk man, it felt a little more real to me because it wasn’t a huge coming out scene because sometimes you just don’t need to come out."
