The first day I got to UCLA, I was really excited to take in the whole college experience. I went around the Hill, meeting people and doing all the silly move in fair activities. I ended up getting along really well with my roommate and met a few of their old school friends as well. I was really hoping that college would be a great and new experience for me to really grow and develop from, both personally and professionally. I decided to go ahead and take a tour of campus itself before the day ended just to really take in the buildings and figure out directions to all of my lectures. It was when I crossed that first stoplight, saw the dismount zone sign, and set my first foot onto Bruinwalk that I realized something. It was all downhill from there."

That or start learning how to cook it myself."

Although, I will ask if it’s possible to hand off the excel sheet to the general public as well."

ucla,fo9hq5l,t1_fo9cqxi,1587619864.0,"Just because those classes give you the foundation for these things doesn’t mean everyone’s going to immediately understand it or know how to competently apply it though. By that logic, I can say that everyone in a STEM program is knowledgeable in AI research because they’ve probably been taught probability and linear algebra."

ucla,fo7pia0,t1_fo76to0,1587582312.0,"I don’t really know how I feel about the effectiveness of the software being proposed then if the raw data isn’t being published to the public. The field of data analytics and science can be used to push some pretty faulty narratives just by finding clever ways to present findings on data that wind up being completely dishonest and biased. Alternatively, incompetent work might be done that leads to misinformation of the public.

I hope this is something that ends up changing."
ucla,fo63vm6,t3_g5uw64,1587545524.0,"Wait, I’m kind of confused by what you mean with “the source of data is not publicly available”? If that’s the case, then how would software making the information accessible by the public useful? It sounds to me like that data needs to be displayed in order to function and it seems like that would conflict with the policy of data being unavailable.

Also, is there a version of the budget available in a .csv or other workable format I can use to try and analyze myself? I’d really like to not have to read 400 pages and be able to do my own stuff with it."

ucla,fo5yihr,t3_g5j1i8,1587539937.0,"What’s the difference between a fire right next to campus and a student with a dry cough?

One gets campus to close and encourages students to wear face masks to avoid damaging their lungs.

The other presents no immediate threat to campus but we know some members of our campus community live in evacuation areas or may be impacted by road closures.

Edit: I added more in a comment chain below because I’m procrastinating."
FREE,fo06g82,t3_g4nlzr,1587406910.0,"Honestly, I’ll probably get RDR2 and give it to my friend who’s been non-stop busy since we moved back from our college campuses. I personally got a copy during launch (Rockstar so no library sharing qq) and told him he could come by whenever to give it a go whenever he wanted, which has sort of been difficult for the time being."
ucla,fo01ap9,t1_fo00pui,1587404333.0,"To be fair, I don’t think that people like the students on the subreddit are the target demographic. If we go by USAC’s terminology, we aren’t their community so they really don’t give a shit about demonizing other people if it helps to rally and the energize their voters into actually voting, which is people who are easily guilt tripped or the people who benefit directly from this policy. 

It’s like actual politics. It’s not about being reasonable or truthful or polite. It’s about getting backing for your cause because you don’t give a shit about what your political dissidents think or how others see them."
ucla,fnu3ozz,t1_fnttp4k,1587253922.0,"If it boils down to just cost, I’d go with Irvine for price alone. A lot of the benefits people would cite for attending this school is meeting people and faculty and I don’t value that too highly since I believed that faculty works hard and seeks out interested students everywhere across the US.

Regent’s primary benefit is priority enrollment at pretty much any campus in the UC system. I’d say it’s a ridiculously good thing to have since it saves you from the trouble of having a wonky schedule to do with that’s not suitable for your circumstances. I’ve been told that they have their own small network that deals with opportunity and networking events at UCLA at least so idk what else is in that deal.

The prestige that a lot of people think UCLA has is kinda whatever to me personally just because I don’t see this school as anymore important or valuable or developed as most other places. Depending on your field, you might wanna ask some people in that field if the name UCLA matters more than UCI since in some cases the name recognition could be valuable for non-meritocratic hiring practices."
nintendo,fnty19z,t3_g3ptch,1587250776.0,I started getting back in touch with a friend of mine from high school more regularly now that we’re suddenly both back home from our respective college campuses so that’s been cool.
ucla,fntlbtj,t3_g2taak,1587243956.0,"My personal view on debt is that if I go over 20k in non subsidized loans over 4 years then it’s too much for me to reasonably pay off in a way that doesn’t  seriously burden my life after my undergrad. Since that’s an amount I assume I can pay off (more or less) by working minimum wage for about a year and a half by staying with parents. I don’t know much about how you define money being saved (cost not paid out of pocket vs cost taken as loan) so I can’t really assume more than that.

I would assume that you saving 10k a year at Irvine is based off of you saving that much in housing by going to Irvine (local to you) than LA, as a Regents scholarship would/should automatically incline your decision one way to begin with. If this is the case, I’d first suggest that you make sure that you’re saving as much as you think you are by taking it up with the financial aid department at Irvine on what your estimated cost is just so you can get a better read of the numbers (financial aid changes in a weird way if you stay off campus with parents vs on campus).

That said and if you’re above a certain level of debt anyway with your education plans, I would say not work the extra amount. You get respectable faculty either way, education that follows relatively the same curriculum, and prestige is something beyond my area of knowledge since it’s not as applicable to my education plans."

ucla,fnjdh3q,t1_fnivga4,1586996759.0,I thought it wouldn’t matter what his views are since the issue in particular is a public referendum anyway. Throwing your position in on the current issue would just be seen as showboating since you can afford to be insincere about your position to either get more voters.

Based on me trying to recreate the armor, the guy in the menu is basically decked out in Imperial Lamellar all over with a Northern Warlord helmet and a bear pelt for some reason.

ucla,fn0zz4z,t3_fynhv8,1586552054.0,"Simple, it’s easy for me to recognize the things I need and want that are accomplished by my tax money (road maintenance, health insurance, social security, public education, etc)

USAC, from my knowledge and based off my current specific area of concern, wants money to be distributed towards diversity spaces and vague description of student programming, which are things that I feel does not benefit me or a majority of students. 

Certainly, I feel like they may benefit some people who want that, but in this case it appears to have a net negative effect on me as a soon-to-be senior and a person of color who feels comfortable with the resources I already have and access regularly. Anymore money towards such programs do not have any reasonable positive effect to me and I’d be more comfortable if money was tracked and if I had a greater degree of choice in how my student fees funded programs. 

Honestly, I’d be even more comfortable with choosing where my money goes in terms of distribution towards organizations (I would be more than comfortable with money going towards CEC or UCLA libraries versus CPO), which how USAC supposedly already distributed our student fees.

This is another point in case this is right-wing baiting but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. This is not a gradual system of charges. All students are levied equally regardless of their economic circumstances so long as they’re a UCLA student. I don’t find this unfair and I feel like universal increases such as that are undesirable, in stark contrast to the tax bracket system that the federal and state government employs."
