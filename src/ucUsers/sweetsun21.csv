UCSC,fpmvwgy,t3_ge9hdg,1588743152.0,Every college has some drug and alcohols usage but I would say that from an experience of living at porter I saw more drug usage and parties every night. I would try Merrill or college 9/10! :)
UCSC,fpmqtr6,t1_fpmpe6o,1588739328.0,Yeah I wonder too. The other email says it ranges from $500 to 1400
UCSC,fpldgwp,t3_ge2bob,1588710747.0,Go to your portal and press your ‚Äú To do list/ task‚Äù and if you were selected you will see a notification to complete the form
UCSC,fpkuc4o,t3_ge2bob,1588701174.0,Yo same. I was so frustrated for that extra step
UCSC,fpjd30f,t3_gdnnaf,1588664148.0,"I would not assume anything unless you ask directly  admissions or your cc transfer representative. Every case is different, make sure you reach out to them to get the correct and official  answer and so you don‚Äôt jeopardize your official admission."
UCSC,fp6wk2n,t3_gbna8w,1588359831.0,I agree I would email the department as well as forward the email that you sent to your professor as proof. It‚Äôs the best thing to do
UCSC,fp56lrj,t1_fp564c2,1588318079.0,Omg but same. This saved me
UCSC,fp55lvx,t3_gbdfyr,1588317081.0,Wow thanks so much!
UCSC,foxipex,t3_g97bn7,1588145227.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I really mean it. The online quarter is stressing everyone in different ways, and I hope you figured it out or got help from your classmates. ü§ó"
UCSC,fow57du,t3_g9ezrt,1588113227.0,Thank you all for your input üôÇ
berkeley,foiw6l6,t3_g7ghw3,1587799066.0,"Hello, 
I‚Äôm not from this community but I just want to let you know that you‚Äôre never alone in this situation. Yes. you might feel many emotions but there‚Äôs something much more important for you to realize in situation like these: rejections make you stronger and obstacles like these only make you stronger. No, I‚Äôm not saying this to comfort you. In fact I can tell you this by experience because I actually graduated from hs in 2015. I was rejected from any university in California because I had a very low gpa. In fact my dream school was ucsc, I‚Äôm a nature gal! Anyways I‚Äôm telling you this not because you might relate in the gpa specifically but something that we might relate on is that I went to community college and believe it or not it shaped my whole academic initiative and career. By initiative I mean that I told myself that I would work hard and I would transfer to a university one day. Boy, did I work hard! Initially I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to major in but because my community college was so small, I was able to make strong connections with professors as students really didn‚Äôt go to office hrs so often unless a midterm approached and I was surrounded by professors and students in STEM. I loved science so much because in community college I felt that it was less impacted I always had more experience. I was also employed on campus and ended up doing research for the first time and made so many connections. At my cc, I received a bog waiver and my education was basically free. Today I am a transfer and I am a student at ucsc studying biochemistry and molecular biology. Don‚Äôt give up on your dream everything is possible. Keep your head up and stay motivated whenever things get hard keep going."
UCSC,fodr75n,t3_g6x8kw,1587688595.0,"Actually I think carson Is far from science hill. It‚Äôs passing porter college, I see many students take the bus to get to science hill and they live at Carson. Your best choice would be 9/10 it‚Äôs literally crossing a red bridge and you‚Äôll be there, no need to take the bus! It‚Äôs convenient Specially if you‚Äôre taking courses that require additional attendance like labs and discussions. I don‚Äôt know much about crown."
UCSC,fodqgk9,t3_g6xk7i,1587688189.0,Hmm good question I transferred last fall and I completed the second part of my history course during summer before transferring and of course I did talk to admissions about this. Usually for community college there‚Äôs a representative for Universities. I would definitely reach out to admissions if you can‚Äôt reach to your schools rep before assuming anything ! Unfortunately for me regular history courses didn‚Äôt count from high school unless they were AP courses.
UCSC,fod5q1z,t3_g6udum,1587680334.0,I agree. I think I did a descent amount of studying and even so I rushed though it.
UCSC,fod5bjh,t3_g6ui9i,1587680124.0,"Everyone here is right, no one really knows what will happen. As an opinion though, online courses are most likely going to happen but we will see as time goes by and wait till they send that email."
Biochemistry,fo1a5qk,t3_g53x58,1587428903.0,"I‚Äôm a biochem major at my university. we used Lehninger and I am a visual learner so I found the book to be alright but I recommend checking others out based of preference such as:
fundamentals of Biochemistry - life at the molecular level by Donald Voet 

Biochem is also important in learning not only protein structure but function such as kinetic rates and thermodynamics, which I find that general chemistry is more fundamentally needed than ochem when learning this. 
Book:
The molecules of life- physical and chemical principles by Jon Kuriyan 

Book: biomolecular kinetics a step by step guide by Clive R. Bagshaw 

There‚Äôs many others out there that are more general biology but explain protein function and structure very well like : Campbell biology (11th Ed) by Lisa A. Urry"
UCSC,fo0kgvv,t3_g4z5gu,1587414755.0,"I moved out March 18 and my refund recently appeared as of April 18th, not sure why some receive it earlier than others"
UCSC,fny8yps,t1_fny5n9l,1587356384.0,Porter is the primary location where transfers are placed at. I didn‚Äôt have a choice as a transfer though I had a very few friends incoming as transfers at Stevenson and other colleges.
Biochemistry,fnnuuc0,t1_fnmu95o,1587102417.0,Thanks so much! It clears out so many questions I had.
UCSC,fnniaiv,t3_g2ommq,1587093011.0,"I was admitted last fall 2019 as a transfer student. You will be fine,  please feel free to ask me anything directly about the transferring process"
Biochemistry,fnm9phe,t1_fnm3o79,1587067535.0,Sorry can you explain the difference between a masters and a PhD? I always have trouble since I have a mentor that is currently a mcd biologist in grad school and am only aware of PhDs
UCSC,fnm9172,t3_g2jplp,1587067195.0,Good luck! Sending positive vibes
Biochemistry,fnjdait,t3_g23hfc,1586996655.0,"I‚Äôm a biochem major and at my uni the biochemistry courses taught in depth about kinetic rates, inhibitors!, and other important concepts that are fundamental for protein function."
biology,fnij3n0,t3_g1zasj,1586980873.0,Tea.  lots of tea helped me focus. Specially at midnight.
UCSC,fnihko7,t1_fngc6ef,1586980119.0,True. Lived on porter and partying and drug and alcohol use is heavy.
UCSC,fnigucd,t3_g1l1w3,1586979759.0,"I dont drink or party at all. It‚Äôs just a preference of choice of who you want to be. Don‚Äôt let any of this discourage you from coming to ucsc. I was actually trashed by so many all quarter because I didn‚Äôt drink and it never stopped and you know what, I met amazing people that didn‚Äôt live that party lifestyle, those were my real friends bro. It‚Äôs true what people are saying here. All you have to do is look around. My advice is to be yourself and you do you. ‚úåüèΩ"
UCSC,fncnemz,t3_fwomnp,1586841340.0,I am not sure if you received your letter yet but I am also a transfer student and when I was an applicant I got accepted on May 1st got my acceptance at 5 am. They sent an email to add the UCSC Facebook Invitation. I‚Äôm not sure if they stopped doing that but if they are continuing to do that I would stay aware of that invitation because my acceptance and that email were sent at the same time to me. Best of Luck!
