UCSC,fogc0w5,t1_fogbwca,1587750641.0,"i think you can change it on the website but i havent looked at it in a while, i’d get in contact w the housing office"
UCSC,fogb38n,t1_fogaql3,1587750301.0,"it depends on the rest of your apartment, they’ll mix genders with housemates but the bedrooms will typically have the same genders. but if one of you sets your gender as like “nonbinary” for example, they’ll let you request a roommate if you say you feel comfortable with that specific person. they can’t fight you on your gender identity."
UCSC,foga9qm,t1_fog6uf2,1587749995.0,yeah they cant contest your own gender identity. only problem ive seen is what happens when the couple breaks up
UCSC,foexa6x,t3_g6zcev,1587718043.0,"you could honestly room together if one of you changes your gender on the housing site, people do it all the time"

UCSC,fnpo3vf,t3_g37i8u,1587148917.0,thats just for “most people” it doesnt apply to everyone... obviously you can study in your room if that works for you. just a lot of people can get easily distracted in their room or feel as if it’s a place of relaxation (and can’t get in the “work zone” mood)
ACNHTurnips,fnihydw,t3_g1zbd1,1586980307.0,you cant sell to other people’s flick :(
AnimalCrossingNewHor,fnbyl4c,t3_g0vevt,1586824919.0,you gotta cut down the trees so atlas moths wont spawn! also there may be wharf roaches on the rocks preventing tarantulas from spawning

UCSC,fn7yun1,t1_fn7wekn,1586730400.0,"yeah i have the hours in my cruzpay, but my boss is refusing to enter them for us for some reason"
UCSC,fmp6055,t1_fmp5yye,1586275078.0,as of yesterday she gave them to us
UCSC,fmp5sng,t1_fmp5pji,1586274968.0,fight them! i fought with traci for a while and she suddenly did a 180 and gave us the hours.. my guess is that she finally talked to some admin and realized they have to give them to us
UCSC,fmp0e7c,t1_fmo4jqc,1586271998.0,this. they’ll be on your cruzpay and your boss has to input them. theyre required to give them to you because theyre giving us zero hours. i work at terra fresca and i fought my boss on it and she gave them to us
UCSC,fl961oc,t3_fnesst,1584942245.0,yes
