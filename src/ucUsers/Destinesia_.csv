UCSD,fpgombz,t3_gd10sz,1588606697.0,"I’m fine with the group stuff, especially because in some cases it’s replaced tests. 

I do find it a little ironic, though, that some teachers have said they don’t want your success/failure to be based on other people’s through a curve, but then assign group projects which are based on the success and failure of other people."

It’s one of the handful of record stores in the San Diego area, but this one is my favorite because of how crazy it is on the inside. There are records and covers everywhere. Looking back at pics like this makes me excited to see this stuff all blow over and for things to go back to normal."

Watches,fnqtzoj,t3_g3eovm,1587172186.0,"This is my vintage Seiko 7006-7189 that I received as a gift from my uncle, and today it’s my Chem study buddy. It was his old watch and it’s in really good condition despite being from the 70’s. It was the 3rd automatic in my collection, the other two being the Blue Moon and Mockingbird. This one is heavier than it looks, and the internals are a bit loud when moving my wrist, but it still feels very nice to wear. I really like vintage watches due to their generally small size, since it seems like there’s a much bigger selection."

Watches,fnm1lor,t3_g2l2zm,1587063499.0,"Hi! This is my SRPD37 a couple weeks after I got it (hence the wrong date). This is my second Seiko Presage (my first was the [Blue Moon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/aobdho/seiko_srpb41_my_first_automatic/)). I had been looking for a green-faced watch, and originally had my eyes on the green 5KX. Sadly, my wrists are *tiny* and there's no way it would fit on my wrist. The timing worked out pretty well, though, because I received this as a gift shortly after. It's a toss up which one of the Presages I like more, but for some reason this watch is a bit louder when it moves around on my wrist. I absolutely love how the face can seem black in low-light environments, but when the sun hits it, that green dial is fantastic. I still have that Diver itch to scratch, though, so I'll most likely be picking up a SKX013 or Islander soon."

MechanicalKeyboards,fn4qfil,t3_fzl6c2,1586646751.0,"These are my two custom Cooler Master keebs! The rainbow one up top was my first mechanical keyboard ever, a Quickfire Rapid (non-i) w/ MX Browns, I got the keycaps and painted the case. I bought the bottom keyboard, a Masterkeys S Pro, because I wanted backlighting. The case is also painted white, but the back is also painted green to match a custom GameCube controller of mine. The board is pretty battle scarred from taking to tournaments and LAN parties, and it's held up really well."
