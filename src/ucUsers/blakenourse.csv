UCSantaBarbara,fp2rudc,t3_gaz5zn,1588266841.0,If you’ve been admitted to pre-bio than you can switch to biopsych.  The only majors you can’t switch into is engineering and bio so ur good. As far as public health major I don’t think we have it but we do have advising. What’s nice about biopysch is you’re under the psych department but you also work with the bio department. So you can kinda get 2 different perspectives for help. As far as how “pre-majors” work you just have to complete roughly a 2 years worth of classes and  maintain something like a 2.0 or 2.5 GPA. Once you complete those classes you fill out a sheet that changes your major from pre to full and that’s it! Super easy and as long as you follow your specific major sheet your chillin.  Honestly for what you should choose both are really good schools. If you havnt visited both I recommend that and see what feels more right to you. I think UC’s will give you more Opportunities to get research and interns and things like that to strengthen your med school app. What’s good about Ucsb too it’s ranked higher than majority of the other UC’s so you can do sister enrollment over summer or something like that if u wanna get different experiences at other UC’s. Best of luck with ur decision!
UCSantaBarbara,fowfoe4,t3_g9xia3,1588118861.0,"Yea I did this for “priority registration”  and when my pass time came up everything I wanted was already filled so as a biopsych I had to enroll in intro to Turkish religion, finical accounting, and dinosaurs and pray that I would be taken off the waitlist. I called and complained saying this complete an utter bs that you make us pay for that the classes arnt even available for us. Made us transfers feel real special. And they pretty much said too bad so sad and they didn’t care.  Most frustrating thing Ucsb does IMO. Also I would 200000% say buy it bc if not there’s literally like a month difference between the two pass times"

UCSantaBarbara,foiavij,t3_g7kq9m,1587782429.0,Physics and o chem aren’t needed for pbs so u pretty much would be wasting that and I think double major might be a little difficult as the UD for biopsychology are harder. But totally up to you.  I’m a biopsych major as well and I think it’s super cool major and I don’t think Pbs is as cool but that’s just my opinion!

UCSantaBarbara,foi32a6,t1_foi2zsu,1587777708.0,Yea they’re more about neuroscience and theories behind it and Pbs is just normal psychology
UCSantaBarbara,foi0bby,t1_fohz348,1587776128.0,Geller is my new favorite professor I’ve ever had for any course I’ve ever taken. Had him for 6b last quarter canceled our final and gave us a two letter grade boost and now there’s no final or midterm for 6c. The homework is our grade along with some easy quizzes. Some questions were a little weird but I’ve managed to get 100 on all them so far.  He actually understands what we’re going thru and isn’t being a dickhead prof that is just piling work on.  Would highly Recommend

UCSantaBarbara,fn97s0i,t1_fn8xltl,1586762439.0,Talked to the counselor about that and since it’s major prep they do not consider it UD credit bc I took it at cc and was kinda angry about it.  So it doesn’t matter where they take it
UCSantaBarbara,fn97imo,t3_g04tzv,1586762168.0,"I’m a biopysch major transferred this year. I would say the major isn’t hard If you’re able to do well at cc taking bio, ochem, gchem, etc. you’ll do just fine in the major. Side note I highly recommend taking o chem at cc rather than here. Just sub it out for ur physics bc non calculus based physics is an Actual joke compared to o chem. Idk why people are saying the physics is hard here.... just study like you would normally would. At the end of the day it’s physics, there’s only one way to solve a problem and they can’t really through any tricks at you. The hardest part of the major for me was I was initially a bio major so I didn’t have stats or psychology pre reqs done and now I have to take 60 UD 5 quarters. Just look at assist get the basics done and try taking o chem, g chem and bio on top of them."
UCSantaBarbara,fn7ev6v,t1_fn64j8s,1586718942.0,Same here.... whatd u say for that?
UCSantaBarbara,fmk73tp,t1_fmk5k1k,1586146245.0,"No iclicker, there was a really basic quiz that kinda supplements as the iclicker. I think those are going to be weekly, we have same amount of sampling as last quarter and as for exams he’s not quite sure how he’s gonna do it yet."
