berkeley,fpbzega,t3_gckwsd,1588482858.0,CS70 doesn't have to do much with your previous coding experience so that's one good thing. But also I would make sure that you already take the EE series for the *mathematical maturity* as Sahai would say
berkeley,fp2n1ft,t1_fp0rbpg,1588264550.0,"If you look up ""Minecraft Account Generator"", you can get temp accounts similar to temp emails."
berkeley,folspxj,t1_folfw2k,1587869581.0,"Doubles are better than Triples not in the means of ""6 feet social distance"" but the fact that you have one less person to catch the coronavirus from extremely close vicinity."
berkeley,fohn8df,t3_g7fzuc,1587768838.0,"The general consensus is that the fine arts program is underfunded and frankly not amazing. Berkeley also does not have a ""design"" major, leading the vast majority of people wanting to pursue design to take cognitive science.

Although there are fantastic decals (student-lead courses) on web-design, illustration, product design, etc which I would argue is on par with traditional courses. I would look into clubs such as Innovative Design, Berkeley Innovation, Product Design @ Berkeley if you want to know what such students are involved in."

berkeley,fnsp48w,t3_g3pcjd,1587226096.0,"I would actually recommend Data Science + Haas (Business) for a rounded tech education + thicc networking setup. The Data Science curriculum is pretty good, but with the nature of Berkeley you have the option of cruising through the minimal or taking more extensive stats / cs classes."
berkeley,fnfklvh,t3_g1h347,1586909898.0,"Usual path is 61A + EE16A Freshman Fall, 61B + EE16B Freshman Spring, CS70 + CS61C Sophomore Fall. Taking any of the CS classes concurrently is not that common unless you changed majors and started late. 

Being undeclared will not affect getting summer internships. As long as you take 61B before Sophomore year, you will have enough knowledge to pass technical interviews for Sophomore summer internships. I would advise that you take it slow and focus on personal projects and club activities rather than jumping onto courses."
