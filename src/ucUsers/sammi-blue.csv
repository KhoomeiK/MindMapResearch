WarriorCats,fo3ui01,t1_fo2qilb,1587493162.0,"But one could argue that the colors are named after the metals... Silver is a color, but it's distinct from grey because the color is light and metallic, like the metal. Another example: there's a shade of red called fire-engine red. It's named after (obviously) the color of fire engines. The cats would never know the name of that particular shade of red because they don't know what a fire truck is. Similarly, how would they be able to know what shade of grey silver is (or copper vs brown) without knowing what the color is named after?"

pokemon,fnyp3mi,t1_fnydanq,1587370412.0,"Listen man I don't think anybody wants to insult you or your kid, but if your kid is GENUINELY unable to pick up on their disguises despite the episodes being extremely formulaic and making it extremely obvious... Then that's not normal, like at all. Maybe he's playing along for the fun of it, or because he knows you get a kick out of it, and that's totally fine and adorable!! But if it seems like he actually can't follow along, and you notice that he's having social or academic difficulties in school like not meeting certain milestones as quickly as other kids his age, then I would strongly suggest getting him evaluated so that he can be given better support."

\-has unrestricted internet access and learns a bunch of swears because of it

\-Jennifer is one of those \~wine moms\~ where 80% of the jokes she makes is about hating her husband, hating her children, and/or how she needs wine to function

\-her instagram is all about how she's a #momof3boys and acts like parents who only have girls have it easier, and all but outright says that her sons/husband are disgusting animals that she has to try to civilize. However, she does this in a ""boys will be boys!"" kind of way and fully accepts that men are just, like, incapable of being functional human beings with responsibility and basic hygiene"
