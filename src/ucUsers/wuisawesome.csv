berkeley,fpciij0,t1_fp8h0eb,1588501795.0,"I’d definitely disagree with you on the incentive structure here. Doing poorly in CS at cal isn’t a big deal. You can easily do poorly in your classes and still land a 100k+ job (or significantly more). 

The consequences of cheating are significantly worse. Not many companies are going to care if you get some Bs or even Cs in classes, especially not in comparison to an academic dishonest mark on a transcript (or expulsion if it’s continued). 

Frankly, there are many times where I’ve taken a 0 on an assignment because I was too busy or stressed. I don’t think it’s affected my ability to get competitively paying internships or full time offers. 

This shouldn’t be very surprising. Any system meant to prevent cheating should probably start by making it irrational to cheat (I.e. the marginal reward for cheating should be negative). The probability of getting caught is typically informed by the quality/needs of education, and the punishment is in many ways the free variable to keep the marginal reward negative. 

Unless you’re incredibly confident you won’t get caught, cheating is almost always a negative, shortsighted decision.

Also, cheating is a tragedy of the commons problem. Without a central disincentive, everyone should cheat, yet cheating would still be a massive problem for everyone. This argument can exist independent of prestige and in political science (or political), preventing these types of problems is pretty much an undisputed role of the government."

berkeley,fpayxw3,t3_gbs081,1588458622.0,"I think 162 was designed to be a systems course viewed through the perspective of operating systems. This is as opposed to focusing on a specific application.

For example, 162 tries to teach you about concurrency and parallelism, using multi threading as an example, whereas 186 focuses on how to use two phase locking in a database. 

Frankly it’s probably hard to learn about multi threading (the mindset of analyzing thread safety and race conditions) on your own. 

One question id have though is why is this more relevant to ML entrepreneurship than the other things you could spend your time doing?"

berkeley,fpawwcg,t3_ga167d,1588457399.0,"Most of the regular semester hw/projects are still used over the summer, but the summer session is much shorter than a regular semester. 

Also keep in mind that the projects are group based and typically summer students don’t come in with the same pre made groups (while in the regular semester people take the class with their friends)"
berkeley,foxieef,t3_g9vxb0,1588144951.0,"\> On the other hand this means we are over-obsessing about hand washing and surfaces: everyone uses the lobby, elevators, doors, and the spread was restricted to the single floor.

It seems plausible that we are obsessing just the right amount about surfaces and this has prevented the further spread by contact. 

This still does make a compelling case for why campus should be potentially stay closed in the fall."

iOSProgramming,fnbdqhh,t1_fnbc7jp,1586813720.0,"Yes, I should clarify that I meant the protocol only provides an ID and not location. 

But yes, we have no clue what the UI/dialogue shown to users will include/what other data that may try to combine."
iOSProgramming,fnaxfa3,t1_fnatx2g,1586805519.0,"I also have doubts about if this will work, but from a technical perspective, they've certainly come up with a system that's simple enough to implement. 

The spec is actually incredibly simple. If they implement this the way any other bluetooth service is implemented:

\> what would happen if the end user shuts off bluetooth or manages to block that specific frequency?

Shutting off bluetooth will prevent the advertisement (of course at an OS level they could bypass this)

\> Does that mean they will show location movement in system location services but no positive contact with any individuals?

There's no inherent reason this will show up in location services. Fundamentally tracking advertisements only says ""You came in contact with these people between 1:10pm and 1:20pm"", it doesn't say ""You came in contact with these people at this place"", though the location is implied if you have some other way of figuring out their location. 

\> Also, why would it be unavailable on older OSs and phones? 

Unclear, but if I were to speculate, it might have something to do with either (a) general ethos of security-only updates to old version of iOS (b) supporting old hardware isn't worth the cost (iOS 12 supports some bluetooth 4.1 devices)."

I think it might be better to say ""don't go to Cal if you want to be **surrounded** by conservatives"".

IMO people are pretty accepting of different viewpoints. If you show up to a protest with a Trump hat on, there will certainly be a group of people (honestly not sure if they're students) who aren't accepting, but I don't think this is true day to day."
