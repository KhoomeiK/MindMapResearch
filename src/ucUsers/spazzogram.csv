It was this one! Unfortunately the specific one I bought is sold out, and when I bought it it was on sale for $20. I'm sure there are other Houses in Munich sets though!"

APStudents,fmz05fl,t1_fmvm0r8,1586501501.0,"Hmm I think I would reconsider taking maybe one of those courses. All three of those are intense and time-consuming. Of course, for calc, it depends on how strong your math is! Euro itself can be up to 10 hours of reading a week."
APStudents,fmvc3ip,t1_fmumo7x,1586412001.0,"6 is a lot! I’d definitely take a second look and reconsider a class or two. Calc, apush, and chem are all going to be very intensive- if not just content-wise but time-wise. Make sure you have enough hours in a day to dedicate at least 5 hours a week for each of them. I’m not too sure about Spanish, but if that’s your native language it should make things easier. If not, AP languages are generally pretty challenging. I think Lang and Psych should be fine though"
APStudents,fmu4say,t1_fmtyj69,1586384579.0,"AP gov has been one of my favorite classes! The work isn’t actually that bad if you’re already interested in the subject. The way my class was run was a lot of classroom discussions about current events. I took gov after I took APUSH so for me it was pretty easy since a lot of it is just repeat of us history. But since you’re taking it as a freshman, I think it’s still a great interesting yet challenging course for you! Just make sure to be diligent about all the reading assignments since it’s really easy to let it accumulate. 

AP Lang was alright. I just took it for the credit. There’s nothing special about it, I don’t actually think I improved my writing skills or learned anything in that class. The course is set up so that you’re expected to already be a decent writer and what you do is just pump out quick 1 hour essays. I guess it taught me how to bullshit really easily. It’s all just literary analysis and a multiple choice that’s similar to SAT reading. If you’re a freshman I suppose you could take this, but I think it’s better suited for upperclassmen since you’re still developing your writing abilities as a freshman. Regular English classes actually teach you how to be a better writer. AP teaches you how to be a quick writer."
APStudents,fmtjkdr,t1_fmrtd7g,1586373823.0,"If you’re not good at science I would actually recommend normal physics. If you were to take AP though, I’d go with physics 1 since that’s supposedly the introductory level course, but even then it’s known to be extremely hard. It’s manageable! If you’re willing to put in the effort it’ll be okay, but may be difficult to do well in. AP Stats is interesting because it’s not really hard math but more conceptual. It’s kind of a mixed bag, some people say they love stats and others hate it. I’ve heard worse things about physics than stats, so take that as you will."
APStudents,fmrsz1w,t1_fmrr3o0,1586334345.0,"If you can handle it, I say go for it! Ideally it would be best to get As, as APs lift your weighted gpa. But imo it’s still better to challenge yourself and get a B in an AP course than get an A in a regular course."
APStudents,fmrsgnn,t1_fmrruik,1586333817.0,"I took micro and macro during two different semesters. It just meant that I had to do a lot of review for micro in preparation for the exam since I took that in the fall semester. The micro course is a lot more specific about things, like you have set formulas and laws that you have to memorize. This one was definitely more challenging than macro, as it’s almost entirely based on graphing. Macro deals with broad aspects of the economy and was a lot easier for me. It felt a tiny bit more like a history class whereas micro was more math. 
Both of these courses are definitely doable! The quantity of the material isn’t actually that much, you mainly just have to do a lot of practice graphing for the FRQs. Best of luck!"
APStudents,fmrqg2j,t1_fmrp35e,1586331726.0,"I think that's a perfectly rigorous, yet doable schedule! especially since it's regular statistics. APES, Gov, and CSP you can get by without struggling too much. AP Lit may be the more challenging one though. It's a ton of reading and writing, so just be prepared for that, on top of writing your college essays in the fall. Good luck with everything!"
APStudents,fmrpnig,t3_fwz5yb,1586330904.0,"APES is a class that largely depends on your school and how your teacher runs it. For me personally, the class was a breeze and I scraped by with maybe 2 hours of work a week. However, on a more general note, I've taken AP classes that required up to 15 hours of homework/studying a week. Ask around your school to gauge how your teachers run the class! Imo APES was an incredibly rewarding class and you learn so much that actually impacts your life from it. Also, the class itself isn't super science-heavy and is more about making connections around concepts. I don't think it's necessary to prepare for it before the class starts, but if you'd like, getting an AP review/prep book like Barron's or something can be helpful. It's more for review though in the few weeks prior to the exam."

Major: polisci


UC Berkeley 

Pros: 
1. The #1 public university in the world 
2. Top ranked polisci program
3. In a city with lots of culture and diversity and amazing food and boba 
4. Party scene is better 
5. Student activism on campus 
6. Student culture - super inspiring. I love being surrounded by people who are super passionate about whatever it is they care about. I don’t know how true it is to say that people here are more ambitious, but that’s the vibe I get 
7. Has a law clinic on campus that has allows undergrads to work in
8. I don’t have to learn how to drive. 
9. So many incredible student organizations, especially orgs that are directly connected and involved with helping the city 
10. Bezerkeley! Quirky, wacky, super unique community
11. Has been my dream school for a while. In love with the student culture, the traditional classical/Victorian styled architecture, the historical significance of the campus.


Cons: 
1. Much more rigorous 
2. Grade deflation. Rip gpa
3. Depression
4. Reputation of being super competitive and cutthroat and toxic 
5. I’m from the bay, so it’s a little too close to home
6. Can be more dangerous
7. Housing is absolute ass. Have to start searching for apartments to rent after yr 1. High level of difficulty 
8. Huge class sizes. No connections with professors
9. Some club recruitment processes are competitive as hell, hard to get into, and you’d need to go through rounds of interviews


UC Irvine

Pros: 
1. Regents scholarship of 8k per year, 32k over 4 years 
2. Accepted into the honors college (priority class registration, priority housing etc) 
3. I have enough AP credits to be able to skip classes and graduate in 3 years 
4. Safer neighborhood. Wealthy suburbs
5. Easier to maintain a high gpa
6. A lot of my friends are here
7. Good food in OC
8. Better weather, sunshine year-round
9. Off campus housing has pools in the backyard...
10. Disneyland 

Cons: 
1. Lowkey a commuter school, so the social scene may be more quiet 
2. You need a car or to hitch a ride if you want to leave campus 
3. Less prestigious"
