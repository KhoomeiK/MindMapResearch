But I also found out that human bite force is 200lbs, feels like being crushed by 2 household toilets stacked on top of you. So you're more likely to have your finger ripped off by petting a rabid human than a tame domesticated cow. :)"

UCDavis,fojz5y9,t1_foium8j,1587832322.0,I'm a double major in STEM and I agree with you more than the other posts. The smartest thing to do is test the waters and never commit to something blind.

I don't want to scare you, but I assume you don't know what you're talking about, I think."

UCDavis,fni08n9,t3_g1ttvf,1586971783.0,Did you guys read that one post where the guy complains that he didn't get into Davis with his 4.5 GPA and 1350 SAT? Hilarious.
UCDavis,fncpvai,t3_g0vbdm,1586843398.0,More work in short bursts. When I do have downtime it feels long and stretched out.

UCDavis,fn9603j,t3_g08s45,1586760616.0,"Like all the other posts, med schools want high GPAs. Engineers generally don't get high GPAs because of how hard everything is. Basically, you better be getting good grades, and if you do, then you ***might*** be able to get into med school"

UCDavis,fn0remn,t3_fyi4q9,1586547310.0,"Remember the story of the Tortoise and the Hare: the Hare and Tortoise decided to race around the large race track. The Hare ran as fast as he could, but eventually grew tired and fell asleep thinking he'll still beat the Tortoise (a more grim version would have him tripping over a rock and crippling him), but the Tortoise kept at a reasonable pace and eventually finished before the Hare. Even in University, when you're in competition with the brightest people on the planet, slow and steady wins the race. You'd be wise to remember that."

Oof!"
UCDavis,fmtr12j,t3_fxcvf5,1586377512.0,"If you want to get into grad school for engineering, p/np-ing an engineering class will surely provide a huge road-block on that opportunity in your life, considering many engineering students will still take normal letter grading."
UCDavis,fmmbw4v,t3_fvtq0u,1586202496.0,"Dude just drop the class if it's like that. There shouldn't be this much distrust between a professor and his students that he'd have to go that low, even in the CS department."
