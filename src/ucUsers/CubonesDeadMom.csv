That is not what you said and not what you meant, and if you did it would have made you claim even weaker than it already was. There is no difference between the two, one is just a tiny sliver you decided to cut out of the whole to fit your poor logic. Imagine the universe is a infinitely long plane and we are discussing it’s properties. You’re just deciding to arbitrarily point out a 3 nm square chunk of it and acting like it’s a totally separate thing with different rules. But it’s not. You just decided to look at a tiny fraction of it because either you’re lazy and it’s easier for your brain to understand, or you’re just desperately trying to make your argument make sense no matter how many random things you have to tack on to it and how many obvious glaring problems there is with that. 

Why would these imaginary future being also happen to just follow your stupid rule you made up? They’re just going to ignore any civilizations outside the current observable limit even though they’re capable of interstellar travel? They’re just going to decide only civilizations within your boundary count towards oldest civilization?

That’s just the part of the universe we can see because there is a speed limit. That doesn’t mean the rest of it isn’t there and it doesn’t change anything about the probability of life in the universe, you’re just arbitrarily deciding to delete the vast majority of it so you argument makes a tiny bit more sense.

space,fpb27vy,t1_fpb1coy,1588460563.0,"No I guarantee it’s improbable. I guarantee that probability is astronomically small. There is basically no doubt about that. You just can’t seem to grasp the fact the the most improbable possible thing is literally going to happen an infinite number of times in an infinitely sized universe. And yes we can assign probabilities based on what we know about life. We know the properties needed for earth like life to arise, and we can actually identify planets that fall into those categories now. It is a fallacy to say you can not assigns probability of life arising just because we haven’t found aliens yet. 

You just obviously can’t grasp the concept of infinity or comprehend what magnitudes much larger than billions mean. Even if life was rather common, or in other words that probability wasn’t astronomically low but was rather high, it would be incredibly unlikely to ever find another planet with life on it. Again because the universe is infinite, or near infinite, in size. In an infinite universe literally **every single thing that is not flat out impossible ** is going to happen an infinite number of times. So even if our universe only approaches an infinite size it would still happen countless times. 

So even with a sample size of one we know for a fact life can arise from natural processes in this universe. We also know the universe is infinite or near infinite in size and the basic laws that govern physics and chemistry work the same everywhere"

interestingasfuck,fp6krxh,t1_fp6j8j4,1588354034.0,"You said “with how recently our concussion discoveries are in human, I don’t think we could even define concussions in woodpeckers.” That quote is not from the paper, it’s from an article someone wrote about the paper. The paper wasn’t looking at if they get concussions, it was looking to see if they had brain damage similar to that seen in people with CTE. Here is the actual paper where they define and explain their methods. 

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191526


“In the central nervous system of humans, the protein tau assists in the assembly and stabilization of neuronal microtubules. Accumulations of tau can be seen in conditions ranging from normal aging to various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease [1]. In the disease state, through a process yet to be understood, tau dissociates from the axons and become hyperphosphorylated to form insoluble neurofibrillary tangles [2]. It is not entirely clear if these aggregates are responsible for the symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Tau accumulations have also been observed in association with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) [3]. CTE is theorized to be the end result of repetitive mild traumatic brain (mTBI) injury. Repeated concussions has been suggested as a cause of CTE in contact sport athletes.

Recently, the CTE center at Boston University reported CTE in brain tissue of 110 out of 111 former National Football League (NFL) players studied [4]. However, CTE is not unique to football and has been identified in the brains of athletes who play soccer, rugby and hockey [5].

The prevalence of CTE and relationship between mTBI and the subsequent development of CTE has yet to be fully established. Currently, the disease can only be diagnosed by post mortem analysis utilizing immunohistochemistry with antibodies directed against p-tau.

The most prevalent pathological changes thought to be diagnostic of CTE are focal accumulation of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) within neurons and astroglia distributed around small blood vessels located at the depths of cortical sulci [6]. Other staining patterns considered to be supportive of CTE include pre tangles and neurofibrillary tangles in the superficial layers of the cortex and the hippocampus; neuronal and astrocytic aggregates in subcortical nuclei; and ‘thread-like’ and ‘dot-like’ axonal tau staining patterns [5, 7, 8]”

From the discussion:

“ The anatomic locations and staining patterns of the lesions identified in the brains of woodpeckers shares some similarities to human CTE. In humans, CTE is most prominent in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain with a spectrum of tau deposition patterns including focal perivascular staining, astrocytic inclusions, ‘thread-like’ and ‘dot-like’ axonal staining patterns (5, 7). In the woodpecker, we identified similar focal perivascular staining, astrocytic inclusions, ‘thread-like’ and ‘dot-like’ axonal staining patterns which were confined to the frontal lobe of the brain. The woodpecker brain lacks the gyri and sulci seen in the human brain. Because of this, we could not evaluate for lesions located at the depth of sulci, as seen in human CTE.”"

What’s really cool is that in certain areas Garter snakes have coevolved with these newts and are resistant to TTX, creating an arms race where resistant snakes select for even more toxic newts, which selects for even more resistant snakes, creating this cycle of reciprocal selection.
