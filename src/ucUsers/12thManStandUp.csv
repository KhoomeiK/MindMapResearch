UCSantaBarbara,fo8ble6,t3_g67yo8,1587593456.0,"I took classes but didn't get the certificate. Still was able to leverage the professors as resources to get internships/a good start to my career. Absolutely would recommend doing that at least. It's all about the stories you tell when it comes to interviews/professional development, so even saying you were involved with the program is great.

I 100% credit taking Greathouse's classes and going to his office hours to pick his brain with where I am in life (which I am happy about) today. It's kind of intimidating as a college student (was for me) to go talk to him, but it paid off. He is well connected and it takes 2 seconds for him to shoot an email to his friends to help get your name out there/on top of the resume pile.

Hope this helps!"

Seen a bunch of posts about increased workload and whatnot but don't fully understand. This is coming from a genuine place of curiosity ftr. If I was in your position I would be (insert adjective here) as well. Stay strong everyone, this too shall pass!"
