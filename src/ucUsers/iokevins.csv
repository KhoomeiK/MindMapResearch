A mini one landed on my shoulder. And we saw one dangling in the air about 20 feet below the tree branches near the Academic Resources Center (ARC).

Between these and the bees and the woodland cicadas noisily clicking away in the redwoods, everything just seems to be going ham for Spring."

After the poacher came back, I lost a chunk of my stamina but the poacher got stamina back, which I presume was a bug in how it reconicles things (?) For me, the poacher came back twice. I have a maxed prof with 397 stamina and an Auror with 232 stamina."

I mean, no strategy is perfect in all cases. Even if you're immune to damage, fighting that Elite Fierce spider or dark wizard or etc. is going to take a bit and take a lot of energy."

This! üòÖ

As a Professor, I just need 3 and I'll dump it into Proficiency Charm. And if you're a Professor and an Auror gives you 3 focus, use Proficiency Charm, then protect the Aurors and others with Protection Charm, then go ham on Deterioration Hex."

Link to the April 17 Office of Emergency Services campus directve, [Campus directive - restrictions on select trails and recreational spaces](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/04/restrictions-trails-recreational-spaces.html), which states:

>Although the supplemental order has been lifted by the County, the original restrictions listed in the extended County Public Health [Order](https://www.santacruzhealth.org/Portals/7/Pdfs/Coronavirus/PHO%20Order%20Extending%20SIP%2020200331.pdf) dated March 31, 2020 are still in effect.  
>  
>...  
>  
>This decision is to address areas where group gatherings may occur or areas where we have had challenges with people practicing effective physical distancing.

It seems the specific section of the original order you're interested in is 12.a.3 (emphasis added):

>For the purposes of this Order, individuals may leave their residence only to perform the following ‚ÄúEssential Activities.‚Äù...To engage in outdoor recreation activity, including, by way of example and without limitation, **walking, hiking, bicycling, and running**, in compliance with Social Distancing Order of the County Health Officer to Shelter in Place Requirements. Outdoor recreation activity at parks, beaches, and other open spaces must be in conformance with any restrictions on access and use established by the Health Officer, government, or **other entity that manages such area to reduce crowding and risk of transmission of COVID-19**. Such restrictions may include, but are not limited to, restricting the number of entrants, closing the area to vehicular access and parking, or closure to all public access."
