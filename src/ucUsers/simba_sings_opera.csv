warriors,fpmgks3,t1_fpl3c0m,1588732614.0,For real. I never thought I would see the day the warriors became champions. Especially watching those years of CJ Watson and Brandon rush and those D-League warriors after the we believe years
Naruto,fpgbxzc,t1_fpg7e2b,1588599469.0,"I dunno man. It took that whole time skip arc for boruto to understand that Naruto had nothing growing up and be who he is today through sheer will with some help along the way. Even then, boruto kinda went back to his old ways a few episodes after the time skip arc. Then the prison arc was just kinda stupid tbh. They‚Äôre trying to set up the mujina gang as this big bad but they didn‚Äôt need so many episodes of it. Especially when there was pretty much no useful information in those episodes. Boruto just tries to use the same tropes as Naruto but it doesn‚Äôt work"
Naruto,fpfqecm,t1_fpf8xb5,1588579738.0,"If only they hadn‚Äôt rushed this part and just ran along with it for another year before going into boruto. I feel like I would have just a bit more closure than I do now. Woulda been nice to see more of the peaceful times and the interactions between these characters we grew up watching. But instead, we get boruto‚Äôs cocky ass üò©üò≠"
UCSantaBarbara,fpfpp12,t1_fpfc8ac,1588579030.0,"I feel like when employers ask about UCSB being a party school, they don‚Äôt really care all that much. As long you don‚Äôt say. ‚ÄúHell yea brother. I was chest deep in tits and cocaine every weekend and taking tequila shots like it was Cancun‚Äôs birthday every day‚Äù. As long as it‚Äôs a respectable and responsible answer, employers shouldn‚Äôt care that much since UCSB‚Äôs academics are really well-distinguished; especially in the past couple of years. Employers understand that most people attend some parties or kick backs and enjoy spending time with friends"
MovieDetails,fpdd94w,t3_gcoum2,1588524708.0,"In princess and the frog, during the song ‚ÄúFriends on the other side‚Äù, Dr. Facilier‚Äôs shadow turns the wallpaper into skulls."

nba,fp4ywev,t3_gb5nhk,1588311144.0,That dunk was fucking powerful
UCSantaBarbara,fp4qr2j,t1_fp4gii4,1588305076.0,Yea. She‚Äôs doing quite well. I feel like LSD really changes your viewpoint on life for the better whether you have a good or bad trip
UCSantaBarbara,fp3neb3,t1_fp3lfvx,1588282378.0,"Dam. I can‚Äôt even imagine what it was like to experience that while tripping. That‚Äôs unfortunate that your first experience had to be like that. Especially first time tripping, it‚Äôs just a constant barrage of stimuli that you‚Äôre not used to."
UCSantaBarbara,fp3j126,t1_foznbge,1588280150.0,That‚Äôs actually exactly what happened to my friend. She didn‚Äôt really know much about LSD and then took it kinda late. She ended up peaking while the tear gassing was going on and she said that all she could hear for the rest of her trip was the people running and screaming.
nba,fp1kosk,t1_fozuqcb,1588238829.0,I don‚Äôt think it is because pierce got gasol‚Äôs hand. The ref might have seen that as a blocked shot. The ball handler‚Äôs allowed to come back down with the ball and have it not be called a travel if the shot gets blocked
DotA2,fp0s5sj,t1_foz35xz,1588215722.0,"Back in the day, my parents tried to stop me from gaming at home so I brought my laptop to the library to grind in dota. It was very hard getting used to the constant 80 ping even playing on my own server US west. It also had lag spikes every 5-10 minutes to 1000 ping but after a few days, I actually got kinda used to it. That feeling when you predict a sunstrike with 1000 ping and 5 second delay is pure bliss"
UCSantaBarbara,fozn0s7,t1_fozmwtx,1588193385.0,My bad. Freshman year was a weird one
UCSantaBarbara,foxoddy,t1_foxh4kp,1588150575.0,This and also getting tear gassed during the Halloween riots
redditserials,forzypc,t3_g8w59q,1588021470.0,Ohhhh. That makes sense. Cuz the mystallian are benders and Zeus has his own pantheon. I‚Äôm still waiting on Ties that Bind to arrive so I‚Äôm not fully caught up with the family ties.
ElectricForest,forzqpf,t1_forwzrq,1588021358.0,"It honestly was pretty awesome. Even though I ended up walking such a long way from tent only camping, that meant my neighbors had cars and nice setups of a awnings and shade. Spent most of the days waking up super sweaty and moving into a neighbor‚Äôs shade to get a couple more hours of rest time. Bringing everything on the plane was a bit of a hassle though. I flew Spirit which you should not do. I recommend going Southwest because you can check 2 bags for free. So I brought a 75 liter backpacking bag that was able to fit my sleeping bag, a small inflatable mattress, the tent, and some other knickknacks that I wanted to bring. I also had a duffle bag with most of my clothes and my portable phone chargers and electronics as my carry on and a backpack as well as a pillow. It‚Äôs kinda heavy carrying everything around but the backpacking bag helped a ton cuz it allowed me to carry all the oddly shaped stuff in one bag. 

As for the experience, it‚Äôs hard to explain. I feel like everyone describes their experience in forest as amazing or one of the best weeks of their lives, which it definitely was for me. But I like to call it transcendent. The absolute beauty of the forest when you first walk in, the beauty of the people both inside and out, and the feeling of finally being free was what came to me the first time walking in. Never have I felt more relaxed and accepted by those around me and I waited in line for 2 hours to get in. Everyone was just standing around in the sun and laughing at jokes, meeting new people. It felt as if it really was just one big family. It‚Äôs not just the attendees but the artists and actors that they bring in as well. I had an extremely funny experience with the clown/carnival troupe roaming around the first day which then led to me being coerced by the clown troupe to do the talent show. Also made some great friends that I still keep in touch with and we talk about meeting up at Forest or other festivals that we‚Äôre going to."
redditserials,forvyaf,t1_foqn90a,1588019458.0,"In part 17, Llyr (Bob) says that his uncle is Avis. And I believe in the Celestial wars, It‚Äôs said that Avis is siblings with Zeus so Sam might be Poseidon‚Äôs grandchild."
ElectricForest,forum84,t1_foqntve,1588018793.0,"There was quite a bit of planning involved. Had to make sure that I had enough space in your luggage for all my essentials as well as a sleeping bag and tent. Also had to make sure that I had ample time to find the EF shuttle once I got to the airport. It actually took me like, an hour and a half to find it cuz O‚Äô Hare is massive. But after you get onto the shuttle, it‚Äôs kind of smooth sailing from there. There‚Äôs a tent only camping area for people traveling from out of state. Gotta make sure to keep asking where it is though because I was pointed in the wrong direction and ended up trudging my way through car camping for 20 minutes before asking another staff member where tent only camping is. It ended up being where I started out and where the shuttle drop off was. I just ended up setting up where I was and met my awesome neighbors."
ElectricForest,fop5bbe,t3_g8ll3w,1587953404.0,"Do it! Absolutely fucking do it. Electric forest last year was my first festival ever and I sent it alone from California. It was an absolutely religious experience. One only do you make a boatload of new friends, the greatest part of it for me was getting to know myself a lot better. There‚Äôs also no time restraints or anything like that from other people. You can see whatever set you want and stay for as long as you want. You don‚Äôt have to worry about meeting up with your fam at a certain time and place. Being on my own schedule was amazing. Also, going solo gave me so much confidence in myself because I was taking such a big venture for my first festival. At a couple festivals this past year where I got separated from my group, I didn‚Äôt worry at all and just went with the flow because I spent that week in the forest surrounded by the forest fam. If you have any questions or concerns about going solo, you can message me. I‚Äôd be happy to talk more about it."
ElectricForest,focqmxk,t3_g6r16u,1587674569.0,This was one of my top 5 sets of last year. It was so good

ElectricForest,fn16u06,t1_fn11zyg,1586555945.0,I would love to go if it happens but out of state travel for me would be a bit of a hassle at the moment since I live in Cali. :(
