UCDavis,fpn2w4x,t1_fpn0jqp,1588748523.0,"regarding phy 7a, I'm not sure how it is during summer, but I took it fall. The course was pretty much entirely online, even before the pandemic, so I imagine not much has changed. We had quizzes and a pre recorded lecture once a week (although I imagine that'll be bumped to twice a week for summer), and no midterm (just a final; not sure if that's still the case now).

Regarding your Discussion labs, I'm not too sure how they go about that for the summer. Usually it's twice a week, but I can't really see them making it 4 times a week so I guess they'd stick with that? If you check the course times on the summer session site it'll tell you how many times they meet so that might help. The DL's are all online and are kind of a crapshoot in terms of quality; very group based so depends on your TA and what groups you get put into (if the people in your group just sit around silently, good luck lol).

All in all, how you do in the 7 series depends a lot on how well you can teach yourself, but I wouldn't say it's super hard. Just practice a bunch, and if you have a good TA, take advantage of that. If you don't vibe with your TA or DL group, it's pretty easy rn to switch to another one so do that.

&#x200B;

Good Luck!"

Obviously wasn't the right thing to do, but the goons who wrote the bill this way and organized all this are partially to blame as well."

Of my friends from freshman year, I remember a good chunk of them played guitar, and I made a friend earlier last year while just walking around at night and hearing him play the piano they have out for the public downtown (it comes and goes).

There's a record shop downtown where people used to come play live music every now and again before the shut down. Assuming it's still there, you could probably meet some fellow musicians there or at the guitar store farther on the edge of town."
