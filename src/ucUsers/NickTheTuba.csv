Chipotle,fp5b2o7,t3_gb6abd,1588322707.0,"It depends on your individual metabolism, but for weight loss, I would probably get a chicken salad with no rice/beans, salsa, sc/cheese, and corn.

The whole thing should total around 400 calories, but due to the supergreens and the density of the chicken it ends up pretty filling!

We're relatively close to LA and SD, but under normal traffic circumstances its gonna be around 2 hours to either one, give or take.

Depending on your daughter's age, I could recommend a school. Antelope Hills Elementary and Shivela Middle are generally regarded as the best. In terms of High schools, we have 3: Murrieta Mesa, Murrieta Valley, and Vista Murrieta. Each has their own strong suits and depending on your daughter's interests, one of them is probably better than the others."

OpenChristian,fnuocq8,t3_g3sttw,1587266953.0,"I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I‚Äôm in a similar situation.

I feel like I‚Äôm on an upward trend right now though in my faith, since I‚Äôve found some amazing new Christian friends (on TikTok of all places). We support and encourage each other and hold each other accountable. And I recently started a ‚ÄúBible in a year‚Äù plan.

Anyway, I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is: I wonder about those same things too. If God is good, how could he condemn most of his people to eternal torment? Say what you will about ‚Äúwe choose to sin and separate ourselves from God‚Äù but God is still the one who set up the system and designed humans to be imperfect, knowing that most would turn away from him. Regardless of that though: it is important to focus on the good. God sent his son to die on the cross for us, thus giving us all a chance at redemption. 

I know it can be hard sometimes to remember this, but God loves you. Maybe try to take baby steps towards reconciliation with him.

Secondly, cooking really doesn‚Äôt need to be treated like an exact science. If you‚Äôre making a batch of cookies and you accidentally add 1-2 extra ounces of sugar, it‚Äôs not the end of the world and your cookies are gonna turn out fine. Exact measurements really aren‚Äôt important.

That being said, it would be much more convenient to have a unified measurement system. I think some recipe websites allow you to change measurement systems and they do the conversions for you."
