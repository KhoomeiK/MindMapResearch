UCSantaBarbara,fpms2lv,t3_gedgh3,1588740227.0,Looks like they‚Äôll make it hard
UCSantaBarbara,fpibgb7,t1_fpibau1,1588637481.0,I suppose not. I got 64.5 on the practice midterm üò≠
UCSantaBarbara,fpi1gtu,t3_gdkcrl,1588631800.0,He‚Äôs never taught Lagrangian multipliers with two constraints but put it on the practice midterm lol
UCSantaBarbara,fph3sew,t1_fpgx7al,1588614460.0,We can!
UCSantaBarbara,fph0mr1,t3_gdf0k9,1588612869.0,"I thought it was ok tbh, not as hard as I expected. The drop deadline has passed but we can still p/np

Edit: are you sure he wouldn‚Äôt count this as cheating as you posted this before the submission deadline?"
Economics,fpfstrl,t3_gd6vz0,1588582198.0,"Good, they will stop propping up extremist indoctrination schools now"
aspergers,fpfs78i,t3_gd16d2,1588581585.0,"No, my professors are making my courses impossible because they‚Äôre online. I can‚Äôt wait to go back to regular instruction"
Economics,fpfrlaw,t3_gcshox,1588580954.0,I like this
UCSantaBarbara,fpeudz6,t1_fpeh87r,1588555142.0,He gave us a midterm from 2015 and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be too hard. Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt screw us with weird curveballs tomorrow
UCSantaBarbara,fpbcmdb,t3_gcg6oh,1588466963.0,Good thing there are only three problems
UCSantaBarbara,fp92gm5,t3_gc1tmf,1588411746.0,I‚Äôve always thought I‚Äôm fairly good at math but lol he‚Äôs changing my mind. Sometimes I feel like he just pulled the problems from somewhere and doesn‚Äôt even know what he is assigning
UCSantaBarbara,fp92ant,t1_fp8v5sb,1588411564.0,Same!
UCSantaBarbara,fp54mbb,t3_gba2rz,1588316136.0,Not true. I just went to Davis‚Äô sub and they say there‚Äôs no announcement just yet
UCSantaBarbara,fp50063,t1_fp4s86w,1588312055.0,I believe they can be used to fulfill Area D (social science). And maybe US history requirement too.
UCSantaBarbara,fp4hjdg,t3_gb9iq4,1588299190.0,"Both, depending on the university and department policies. Would you mind sharing your subjects and scores?"
UCSantaBarbara,fp0wxzy,t3_gamau7,1588218791.0,You can just send admissions@sa.ucsb.edu an email and change to any major you want in the college of Letters and Science
dataisbeautiful,foxri64,t3_ga5i8y,1588153742.0,300k-400k should be plausible. Use Italy‚Äôs number for Hubei (similar population) then x1.5 or x2 for China as a whole
UCSantaBarbara,foxf05i,t1_foxcf8w,1588141984.0,No worksheets :( but still thanks bro
UCSantaBarbara,fox2nol,t1_fov10io,1588132626.0,Thanks buddy. Are his exams like the homework? Or are they much harder?
UCSantaBarbara,fol4nho,t3_g7zc51,1587854808.0,This is so relatable. I feel like I‚Äôm studying all day but still falling behind
UCSantaBarbara,fokfax6,t3_g7v1go,1587841004.0,Probably hybrid instruction
UCSantaBarbara,fohox4z,t1_fohlbhk,1587769798.0,Me too. I have stopped watching his lectures altogether cuz they‚Äôre useless. Now I only read the notes and chegg through his homework lol
UCSantaBarbara,fohosi2,t1_fohlxbi,1587769725.0,Same.
UCSantaBarbara,fohorvz,t1_foho5mq,1587769714.0,How was his homework like in 4B?
UCSantaBarbara,fohk0ho,t1_fohjqtb,1587767243.0,She did last quarter
UCSantaBarbara,foh3c5p,t3_g6sjw8,1587760059.0,"Chill guys, this class is curved. In winter a 82% on the midterm was an A-. She also gave out more A‚Äôs (30%) than she was supposed to (20%) because of the pandemic"
UCSantaBarbara,fo8gvk1,t1_fo8ehae,1587596308.0,Idk then I‚Äôm afraid
UCSantaBarbara,fo8edqj,t3_g6at4t,1587594957.0,I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be allowed to enroll in session A. You can enroll in session B via FSSP tho
UCSantaBarbara,fo82h1y,t3_g695az,1587588729.0,I asked them whether or not they would cancel Econ 10A if session B moves online. Still haven‚Äôt heard back
UCSantaBarbara,fo5h0ya,t3_g5th4v,1587525438.0,"You‚Äôll be fine. The only thing from 6A you‚Äôll use in 120A is double integral. It only comes up in the 8th week so by then you should have learned it in 6A already. Even if you‚Äôre not taking 6A at all you can learn it yourself in half an hour. 

Source: I took 120A before 6A"
economicsmemes,fo4qwvx,t1_fnylpqa,1587509487.0,Exactly.
UCSantaBarbara,fo0iutw,t1_fo0e08h,1587413929.0,"Awesome! Thanks bro, it‚Äôs really nice to hear"
UCSantaBarbara,fo0cq0w,t1_fo04uiy,1587410458.0,It has 8 sections. 4 are full and 4 are closed
college,fnyx7oc,t3_g4pulk,1587379047.0,"The author got one thing seriously wrong. Which is that we don‚Äôt go to college for all the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù or even education. We go to college in order to get a diploma that signals our conscientiousness, conformity, and agreeableness - traits that employers look for. 

All alternative options for higher ed - at least those that are available rn - do not signal conformity. So online universities can not replace real universities as long as higher ed is more about signaling than human capital. This article is just an alarmist trope based on an incorrect premise."
UCSantaBarbara,fnrmd3j,t3_g3iwmm,1587193629.0,"1. No
2. No
3. No"
UCSantaBarbara,fnr2kuw,t1_fnqnfmp,1587177777.0,"FSSP does't give you priority, but you're gonna have more units than those who don't plan on taking classes over the summer."
UCSantaBarbara,fnqdn9z,t1_fnpvldx,1587162553.0,"CS 16 and CS 8. CS 24 is limited to CS (and maybe CE?) majors during pass 1 and pass 2. But I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs not hard to get it during pass 3 if you‚Äôve completed 16. 

As for pass time, you have 3 registration passes. Pass 1 is limited to 13.5 credits, pass 2 19, and pass 3 21. Some courses are limited to certain majors during pass 1 and/or pass 2 (e.g. CS 8). Of you have a lot of AP credits, your pass 1 will be earlier than other freshmen‚Äôs pass 1. But your pass 2 will NOT be earlier than anyone‚Äôs pass 1 no matter how many credits you have."
UCSantaBarbara,fnpumuq,t3_g38tf0,1587152305.0,"Forget about adding a CS double major from pre-Econ. A work around is to change your major to stats or actuarial where you can get priority for two CS courses. This way it‚Äôs easier to get into CS. Lower div Econ classes are open to everyone from pass 1 to pass 3, so you can still declare the full major after finishing PSTAT 120A and Econ 10A."
UCSantaBarbara,fnmg4q0,t3_g2k9mt,1587070816.0,Whoa so they canceled the class because they need significant secure testing but are still doing the retakes. What a nice excuse
UCSantaBarbara,fnbrero,t3_g0u3ew,1586820827.0,Send admissions@sa.ucsb.edu an email and you‚Äôre good
UCSantaBarbara,fn0u4cj,t1_fn0mroz,1586548777.0,"UCSB housing, free & for sale"
UCSantaBarbara,fmz8ycs,t3_fyckc7,1586511098.0,Same boat. I managed to catch up a bit this week but I‚Äôm still behind on readings. Bad idea to take two reading intensive classes in the same quarter
UCSantaBarbara,fmz3svu,t3_fyb31t,1586505307.0,Check out Facebook groups. Lots of people are subleasing their rooms. Good luck!
college,fmvpcej,t3_fxo6t8,1586425674.0,"Yeah, physics and mathematical stats"
UCSantaBarbara,fmrv5xf,t3_fx2cw8,1586336618.0,I‚Äôve already come to terms with doing random but still my roommate/apartment search has been rather unsuccessful :(
UCSantaBarbara,fmpc2cb,t1_fmpbfo6,1586278170.0,"Thanks a lot bro. As for conflicting classes, I was wondering if summer session would be different"
UCSantaBarbara,fmnr1dz,t3_fwdotn,1586232911.0,Tomorrow 9am
UCSantaBarbara,fmndmk0,t1_fmnctar,1586223678.0,"Exactly, a lot of those problems are actually pretty doable if we know the formulas. But lol wtf did he teach"
UCSantaBarbara,fmlufz0,t1_fmllfw3,1586193433.0,Thanks for telling me something I didn‚Äôt ask
UCSantaBarbara,fmkmnxe,t1_fmkmb6e,1586160367.0,"No, she just said offering 10A online involves ‚Äúsignificant secure remote testing that‚Äôs currently not available‚Äù which ‚Äúwill take months of planning‚Äù"
UCSantaBarbara,fmkm5np,t3_fvukad,1586159822.0,I‚Äôm planning on taking 10A in summer too but they might cancel it again if it‚Äôs online. Bedard said there needs to be ‚Äúsecure remote testing‚Äù available for this class to proceed online and it‚Äôs currently not available
UCSantaBarbara,fmkd5w4,t3_fvrcdi,1586151105.0,I dropped a class because of this lol
