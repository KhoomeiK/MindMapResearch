smallbusiness,fpeo5eg,t3_gcx1hv,1588551360.0,I would love this! We’re struggling to market our food delivery service right now and can’t afford the steep prices people are asking for for even just a consultation.
smallbusiness,fny5x93,t3_g4krq4,1587354198.0,Have you checked your Experian account? Credit Karma only uses Equifax and Transunion and SBA pulls Experian.
smallbusiness,fnst4be,t1_fnso106,1587228290.0,How do you talk to a tier 2?
smallbusiness,fnsrwrl,t1_fnsqj4c,1587227635.0,"I’m kind of struggling to see how someone who owns a business that makes less revenue and has less overhead has any fault in this. Should they be getting less than businesses who have higher revenues? Yes, and they are! You should be blaming the billion dollar companies that sucked out millions for what was supposed to go to small businesses, not hard working Americans who are struggling to pay their basic bills now. You reek of elitism."
UCI,fno9cje,t1_fnnz4c2,1587117034.0,This is honestly despicable on the part of ACC. They’re such a predatory company and this changes so many things about the lies and abuse they threw at us when I worked there through this whole disaster. So glad I’m not current;y employed with that disgusting company.
churning,fnns531,t1_fnmtqr9,1587100122.0,"My situation was a bit weird. My app was pending for a while so I called and asked to check on it. The rep said it was denied but that he would be willing to review it for me and ask a few questions to get it approved, so I didn’t even have to ask for a recon. He said the system denied me based on time since recent accounts have been opened, and he asked what those new accounts were for. I explained that they were one secured card since I have a thin credit file and one personal card. He said he sees perfect payment history on all accounts and will recommend me for a pending approval of 1.5k initial line, with an automatic review in 6-12 months for an increase. He transferred me to their business fraud department where they asked me to confirm my EIN number, what type of business I was registered as (LLC, S-Corp, etc), which state I was incorporated, what’s my average monthly business expenses, what’s my monthly gross sales, what kind of business I do, and then asked if I had a website. He then said he would review the website and incorporation information to verify that it’s a legitimate business and call me back in 1-2 business days. Never got a call, but about 6 hours later I got an email saying I’ve been approved."
churning,fnnroe1,t1_fnlt6w8,1587099752.0,"Oh I have a legitimate LLC that does ~100k in sales a year. I didn’t have any issues when they grilled me, but it was just unexpected from a credit card company. Especially only being given 1.5k initial credit line lol"
churning,fnll887,t1_fnljxhu,1587055446.0,They do grill pretty hard. Their fraud department asked me if I had a website for my business and took a few minutes to go through it and ask about the services we offer. Never had to do something like that for a card before lol
churning,fnll31f,t1_fnlht2t,1587055377.0,"I was just approved through recon for aviator biz and given 1.5k. The rep told me that for new accounts, they are giving small credit lines and will be reviewing for increases in the next 6-12 months with positive payment history across all accounts. Probably because of coronavirus, but I’m not sure on the reasons why."
smallbusiness,fngphhu,t1_fngpeg6,1586940137.0,I’m guessing you should be getting an Experian credit check this week and the advance funded 3-4 business days after. I applied at around 1 AM on 3/30 and the SBA has been saying they’re supposedly going sequentially. Keep us updated!
smallbusiness,fngp9mi,t1_fngp07g,1586939905.0,"For the IRS payment, try checking your bank’s status on r/stimuluscheck

When did you apply for the EIDL?"
smallbusiness,fngojs7,t3_g1nxyz,1586939176.0,I’ll start: 4/11 credit pull 4/14 EIDL advance funded at Chase Business
smallbusiness,fngmqxk,t1_fnglhbg,1586937364.0,"We applied minutes apart. He didn’t do a long form, but did a short form literally right after I submitted mine. We all got credit pulls on Experian within an hour of each other on 4/11."
smallbusiness,fngi1tt,t1_fnghyj2,1586932895.0,"Yup! It seems to depend on the bank though. Me and my family member submitted our short form applications minutes apart, got credit checks minutes apart, but I got my funds deposited 3 days later (BofA) and he hasn’t gotten anything deposited (Chase)."
CreditCards,fnfy40l,t1_fnb7q09,1586917965.0,"So after 2 hours on hold, I talked to a very rude Account supervisor who told me that my card would have graduated after the 5th statement but that Capital One has suspended all secured card graduations for the near future. I’m suspecting they just want to hold on to everyone’s cash because they’re expecting high levels of defaults in the months to come. I closed the account; don’t want to deal with a company like this, and that $500 security deposit is better off going to pay down my existing car loan."
churning,fnf8y2y,t3_g12ul6,1586903592.0,"I was recently approved for an AMEX Business Gold Rewards card at the beginning of March. Then, the COVID-19 shutdowns effectively shut my food industry business down. I opened the card since normally I would have no problem meeting the SUB, but now there is no way to meet that with organic spend.

I know AMEX is super picky with MS so I was wondering if people had any good methods that wont raise too many alarms, as a FR is the last thing I need right now. I have enough cash on-hand right now to be comfortable doing 5k of MS.

I’m debating whether I should just close the card or product downgrade and lose the SUB. The annual fee of $295 was a lot to pay for a year where I cant even really use the points or travel perks that come with the card...And a charge card isn’t exactly what I need; a credit card would help me get through this tough time that nearly completely obliterated my business’ cash flow."
CreditCards,fnbcgd5,t1_fnb67gj,1586813077.0,I have two new unsecured cards now! I got a BofA Travel Rewards Card and an Apple Card. Luckily the late payment was only 3 days late.
CreditCards,fnb58fr,t1_fnb47s8,1586809434.0,"When I applied, Capital One's offer explicitly stated that after 5 on-time payments and positive credit history, the card will graduate to unsecured. A CSR has confirmed the offer too."
UCI,fnavhs2,t3_g0jw1e,1586804542.0,5A/5B would be useless for a business major. It’s calculus with application to biology and life sciences.
UCI,fn9e4ae,t3_fzagsy,1586769429.0,"If you already reported the grade on the application, they shouldn’t be rescinding you, since you had to have fulfilled that requirement somehow or they wouldn’t have offered an acceptance in the first place."
UCI,fn9dymy,t3_fztckp,1586769251.0,"I had a similar situation this past Fall where I was unable to get my tax transcripts and my aid was being held up. I emailed Financial Aid and asked to speak to a counselor, who said I could turn in a copy of a tax return for the time being instead. Then, he said by the end of the quarter, I would have to give the tax transcripts or a hold would be placed on my account. See if that’s something they can do for you too!"
UCI,fn9dtvd,t1_fn8emft,1586769103.0,IRS isn’t faxing transcripts anymore due to a change in government regulations regarding information security. I got them faxed my freshman year but this past Fall when I tried they said their policies just changed.
UCI,fn941r1,t1_fn7lhal,1586758695.0,"ACC is an evil company. I worked for them and I’m currently in the process of filing employment abuse suits against them. Pressure them as much as you can, and if not, withhold rent."

UCI,fmyz2j5,t1_fmyyxrm,1586500410.0,"I would message the counselor through your portal or use the UCI directory to locate their email by searching their name. Explain the situation to them and provide them with documentation as soon as possible, just so that they are in the loop prior to reviewing files for rescinding.

If you do end up being rescinded (hopefully not), there is an appeals process that can happen at that point! I was rescinded myself during the scandal for the incoming class of 2021 where they rescinded over 800 students. I was able to appeal and get in! Good luck :)"
UCI,fmyou7j,t1_fmyi7c9,1586491525.0,"^^^the company is hella immoral and unethical, they will steal every penny from you if you aren’t diligent"
UCI,fmyoiag,t3_fy7ogk,1586491276.0,"From what I heard, UCs are not going to be rescinding admissions offers due to low grades or missed deadlines due to COVID-19. 

If that isn’t the case, then it’s almost certain you will be rescinded. There is no leeway with the contract, but thankfully the admissions office has an appeals process for rescinded offers! If your offer gets rescinded, don’t panic, write a thorough appeal letter and provide as much documentation of your circumstances as possible. I’m sure they will be lenient because of COVID-19."
UCI,fmrtboy,t1_fmrn7pw,1586334709.0,"I agree. Biggest mistake I did was not getting 7 day, I was stuck on weekends having to eat out lol"
UCI,fmpq3j8,t3_fwp6oe,1586285296.0,"In terms of financial aid, that will depend on your family’s income. Additionally, unless one of your parents files taxes in California, you will be ineligible for any institutional aid, making you only eligible for federal work-study, pell grants, and loans. 

If you don’t have the income up front, your best bet would be to take out federal loans; just weigh this against what your future career field is going to be so that you do not take out more than your future income can handle."
UCI,fmiuw9v,t1_fmiurkg,1586117408.0,Exactly! Thank you for this.
