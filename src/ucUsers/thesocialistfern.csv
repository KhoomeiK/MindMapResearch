The10thDentist,fphhpf4,t1_fph7wc8,1588621475.0,"I agree that the purpose of debate is to discover missing information, and that we often suggest that the statement ""killing someone is wrong"" is true or false, but I argue that this is a misnomer, and that if there is no objective way of determining the validity of a statement, it doesn't have a truth value.

I don't understand your point that even though we can't know something, it has a right answer. How can there be an answer to a question to which it is impossible to know the answer? That's different from saying that we haven't found the answer yet, it's saying that it is impossible to find the answer. If it is impossible to find the answer, I'd argue that it doesn't have one."
The10thDentist,fph3j5m,t1_fph0v3d,1588614330.0,"For the record, the existence of moral truth has been a heavily debated topic in philosophy for millennia. 

Another thing, how do we know there is a morally “right” answer to a question if there is no objective way of getting it?

There is a perspective that argues that the statement “Murder is wrong”* actually doesn’t have a truth value, but something like “Almost every culture’s moral system says that murder is wrong” does.

*Edit: I think ""murder is wrong"" is actually a tautology, since murder is ""unjustifiable homicide"", so the statement ""murder is wrong"" is equivalent to ""unjustifiable homicide is unjustifiable"", which is a tautology. A better example would be something like ""abortion is wrong"", since there is nothing in the definition of ""abortion"" that indicates *per se* whether it is morally right."

IsaacArthur,foo25pi,t1_fon3pt0,1587931024.0,"That's true, but I think for RNA they are less complex. There's a hypothesis for the origin of life that proto-life consisted of mostly simple self-replicating RNA molecules. My main thought is that while the actual event that produced life might not be that common, the circumstances are (I think) relatively common. It is telling, I think, that it only took about a billion years for life to emerge, and multicellularity also evolved independently, but human-level intelligence only has evolved once, and it probably wouldn't have happened without a freak asteroid impact."
berkeley,fohbxox,t1_foh56um,1587763401.0,"I guess you can’t bar non-residents from entering the city, but you can do other things (testing, self quarantine, etc., stuff countries like Taiwan are doing). You can also make compliance voluntary, and I’d guess most people would listen. 

I’m under the impression that research on SARS and MERS slowed down after they went away, but you are right that having lots of people work on it doesn’t make anything impossible possible, only more likely that we find something. 

I still don’t understand your point about social distancing. If you move from a family house of four to a triple room, you are actually decreasing the number of people you’re living with. It’s not like you are now living with both your roommates and your family. I agree with the fact that the conditions in dorms are conducive to the spread of disease, but that would be the situation regardless of the number of the people in the room."
IsaacArthur,foh1wwn,t3_g71emf,1587759590.0,"Imo, the most likely explanation is that life is common, but intelligent life is not. The evolutionary niche that produced humans, the only earth species with symbolic language, is really specific. From what I understand, the current hypothesis is that an already moderately-high intelligent animal (you could argue there are a few of these, like ravens) self-domesticates (so there's a gain in cognitive control of communication) where there's a complex task (in our case the hunting of large game) for which you already have an adaptation (sweating) and which demands fast cognitive adaptation and communication."
berkeley,fogdh52,t1_foeiis3,1587751174.0,"Good point about the logistics. I’d imagine that there would be ways of coordinating between the city and the university, but it would be difficult. But there would be some incentive on the city’s part, given how much of city business depends on the student population. 

I’m just more of an optimist about therapeutics than you I guess. Keep in mind like every virologist in the world is working on this. 

About the dorms, the issue isn’t that there are strangers in your room (And they’re not strangers for very long). The issue is the other things you listed (bathrooms, dining halls,etc. ) It’s just not ever possible to social distance from the people you live with, and it’s irrelevant how many people are in the dorm, and whether you know them."
berkeley,foedgky,t1_focxfzq,1587701154.0,"There are ways you can control that second wave though. For instance, you can phase out move-in times (have Bay Area people come first, then California residents, and so on) so that you can deal with new infections more spread apart. The issue is, you can't *not* have a second wave, unless you do the ""lockdown until there is a vaccine"" thing (which I haven't seen seriously discussed, and there's no guarantee of a vaccine). But, there are ways you can flatten the curve so it isn't as bad as it could be. 

There are also other treatments being tested for COVID besides hydroxychloroquine, so there's a chance there will be one by the fall.

And about social distancing in a triple: none of the guidelines ever apply to people in your dwelling. The issue would be within the bathrooms, dining halls, etc., not with the number of people in one bedroom."
berkeley,fo3prcj,t1_fo3dc63,1587490937.0,"I second that last point, in general really. If it is at all possible ever, stay home if you’re sick. If I had to bet, I think they will likely do what the junior college across the bay did before the stay at home orders (no room can have more than 150 people in it, larger sections online). They might relax that a little for outdoor events."
berkeley,fnw2bh0,t1_fnv1lnn,1587309993.0,"Yes, unless you have priority for some reason (regents etc). I’d recommend having another option lined up if you apply."
IsaacArthur,fner3fl,t1_fn5kpd4,1586894344.0,"I agree with your general portrayal of war, and I do agree that war drives *some* technology and innovation (like the rocket, for instance), but I think it's an oversimplification to say that it drives *all* technology and innovation. The printing press, for example, was not developed in response to a military threat, it was developed to make printing books more economical. There are lots of technological innovations simply made by civilians to solve civilian problems."
berkeley,fn868fx,t1_fn7mhzq,1586734783.0,"Obligatory not a CS Major, but I knew lots of them. While the lectures tend to be closer toward south side, discussion sections for math, CS and EE tend to be in closer to north side (Evans, Cory, etc.) Also, quite a few breadth classes are in Pimentel, which is close to FH. Worth noting too that the entry level CS classes have like 1500+ people in them, and barely anyone goes to lecture."
IsaacArthur,fn5i6t0,t1_fn3vejm,1586665530.0,War is our only art? It’s the only thing that drives technological innovation? Those are pretty dubious claims.
berkeley,fn4i32y,t1_fn2p875,1586641831.0,"Foothill is nice if you’re doing CS or chem due to its proximity to Cory and Pimentel. Plus, there will be lots of people from those majors there. But if you want a really social atmosphere, FH is less desirable for that reason."
berkeley,flmpqit,t1_flmnho6,1585291650.0,I see. That’s totally fair.
