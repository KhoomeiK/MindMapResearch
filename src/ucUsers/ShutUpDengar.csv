StarWarsLeaks,fpl4g7r,t1_fpk1yxc,1588706191.0,Rose’s theme from TLJ is pretty good ngl. TLJ might be my fav JW soundtrack from the ST. Every track from when Luke and Leia reunite onward is an absolute banger.

berkeley,fpiukou,t3_gdq0lx,1588649059.0,Met Courtney a few times in my pol sci groups/classes and he seemed to me to hold opposing views on criminal justice than what you are prescribing. Be careful of who you claim to act in the name of and in assuming that certain policies are actually effective in combatting gang violence.
StarWarsLeaks,fpi6tm6,t1_fphlhcg,1588634821.0,"That works with Maul because Ray Park never voiced the character to begin with (his natural voice is incredibly high-pitched so they got Serafinowicz for TPM and allegedly Solo before Witwer dubbed him over). Having Ashley dub over Rosario would be much more jarring. Ultimately I see Rosario as Ahsoka as just another extension of different actors embodying the same character, like Ewan/Alec and Alden/Harrison."

television,fph0cox,t1_fpgsjqp,1588612724.0,"I used Libby to borrow the audiobook 2 weeks ago. Pretty much everything in the prologue and flashbacks related to siege of mandalore has been overwritten by the show. Several contradictions involving the lightsabers, how Ahsoka and Rex escape, how and where Maul gets captured, and even the specifics of the Ahsoka-Maul duel. The actual plot of the novel takes place well after ""Victory and Death"" so it still fits in canon if you ignore the Siege stuff."

television,fpb10lz,t1_fpatr7t,1588459844.0,"I grew up in a Hindu household and the whole fixation on the textbook being blessed by god so it can't touch the ground thing in the first episode is purposefully and cartoonishly exaggerated for comedic effect.

television,fpb0vf4,t1_fpad44n,1588459759.0,"Only through the first episode so far but I kind of have to agree.

StarWars,fohkdq5,t3_g73o4s,1587767417.0,"Just realized an (unintentional?) parallel. When Ahsoka uses the force to stop Maul from falling, he says ""let me go, let me die"". This is very similar to what Sidious says to Yoda in ""Sacrifice"" when they duel in the Force vision.
