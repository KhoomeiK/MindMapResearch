ucla,fnqr5bl,t3_g3dr1n,1587170412.0,"1,000 is the max. I would not recommend purchasing the device before officially hearing back from them about whether or not you're being approved for funds. I've heard of some people receiving an award for *loans* rather than a grant. Just find the device you want to purchase and send them the approximate cost (screenshot the end cost in cart) and state your intentions to buy it once they update you on your status. They will respond and let you know if they're awarding you with the grant or not."
ucla,fnmclgd,t3_g2ma9n,1587069001.0,"I believe they can tell if you opened up another tab/have other tabs open but I haven't seen anyone mention that they can tell exactly where you were navigating. If you're worried about the consequences of cheating though, please don't cheat :'( good luck"
ucla,fn4z8ic,t1_fn4r6fa,1586652237.0,My financial aid award was updated and I accepted the grant and it was deposited into my bank account a few days later.
ucla,fmt8zdv,t1_fmt72e2,1586368778.0,The amount you indicated.
ucla,fmnocfl,t1_fmnlrxs,1586230894.0,Submitted on March 18th. I got a response on March 28th. I followed up a few days later (re: incomplete formed) and then on April 3rd I received the grant.
ucla,fmnjadd,t3_fwbxhc,1586227359.0,"Uh, you definitely should've followed up with them earlier. :( I got a response 2-3 days after applying and I was told I submitted an incomplete form and then shortly after fixing that I was awarded for the grant. Just send a follow up message/call (are they still in office??). Best of luck"
ucla,fmjxs4s,t3_fv9n4g,1586139897.0,DMed you
