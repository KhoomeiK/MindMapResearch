That’s true but I think it would’ve been more fair if money had been spread across more students rather than the lucky ones who already benefit from on campus housing being a cheaper option than off campus and then they got to break their leases sweat free? Off campus housing students really struggled."

UCI,fpj3qml,t1_fpiua54,1588655745.0,"Is it fair that some of the UCI school money went to students to help them cancel their on campus leases? I don’t think so and yet it did. I think they should’ve distributed it evenly among all students to help them cancel their leases so that off campus students would’ve benefited likewise. 

But someone did respond above me somewhere that the gov site says that UCI can’t reimburse itself at least, so that’s good."
UCI,fpj3hcn,t1_fpisuxq,1588655536.0,"But UCI gets to decide how it’s distributed and to what students. You could argue that it was distributed by paying off student cancelation fees. 

However, you do have a great argument in that the CARES Act went into effect after the whole event, however I don’t think that there’s any rules about that. Idk not a lawyer

Ah, ya idk my experience at UCI after CC has been pretty good. In those classes of 15-20 I’ve gotten to really know the professors and classmates. I’m sure that after this pandemic we’ll prob see even smaller classes, so hope is on the horizon. 

Good luck and honestly you transferred to UCI for a reason. Professors need to be continued to be paid their wages so tuition won’t change much. In the end you’ll get a degree from UCI and even though the start might be bumpy, just keep a positive mind and you’ll do fine.

UCI,fol63xa,t1_fokq6ss,1587855618.0,"No that’s true but it’s also deeply unfair that people were given full time salaries job offers once they graduate, which have been rescinded and now they’ll prob have to work hourly for min wage until things get better. So many things are unfair right now and it’s not like UCI has unlimited resources. I’m glad they are prioritizing our health even if that comes at a financial cost. I would prefer to minimize the number of people that die.

I just got that as an idea, maybe UCI could offset freshmen off campus housing costs by giving them a reduction in tuition or something. 

But how is UCI supposed to stick by that guarantee if they’re trying to help decrease the number of people infected? Same with my example of people being offered jobs and now when they’ve graduated or are graduating they have nothing to go to. They signed paperwork and all and now have nothing. It sucks but the economy has gone to wack and companies are trying to cut losses. UCI is trying to cut the number of people that die. 

But it could change, how do you know. You don’t, all we have is predictions. 

And would most people actually want school cancelled? I don’t think so. My friend is in a nursing program and her class was complaining that since it’s going to be online things should get canceled. What did they school do? They cancelled and said students would have to finish school in the fall. Well then the students were like oh well we don’t want to wait so now school is back on and online. Reality is most people won’t want to hold off and graduate later.

Edit: Just to show this is true, students could’ve chosen to withdraw this quarter from UCI and delay graduation by a quarter. Did most students do that? No, only a very very few did."
UCI,fol5491,t1_fokmiz9,1587855065.0,"Ya I’m just sick of everyone’s complaining like thing is they’re doing their best. Come October they might come up with a solution. We can’t just get hung up on everything going wrong rn. So many things can change within these 5 months. Literally a month ago I was in class and everything was fine, now we have a shelter in place order. 

I don’t think there’s a point in complaining unless someone has a solution. My solution? Give freshmen a reduction in tuition to offset higher housing costs."
UCI,foklx9j,t1_fokjp2y,1587844527.0,"Okay but thing is how are they supposed to confirm things now when they don’t know how things will be in several months? I really don’t understand why I’m getting downvoted. Like come on it’s not like admin has a magic 8 ball and knows how things will be like in October. The government might decide to do a full lockdown in two months like Italy. Just no one knows and I don’t get why we expect those in power to know. The pandemic changes daily, everything is up in the air. Everything we’re doing is reactive to the virus. Literally no one can make a certain decision unless it’s like a week or maybe two weeks in advance. You just don’t know and it’s unfair of us to expect the school to know. This is the best they can do and if OP doesn’t want to be a human and understand that the school can’t predict the future than I’m sorry I’m at a loss. Everyone in the country is struggling, this whole thing is a mess. No one can tell you what’s going to happen more than a month out and we can’t put unfair expectations. On top of that the school is getting direction from the state and federal gov, some things are out of their hands and nothing can be done. People here are complaining about housing for fall. Well tons of people got job offers rescinded, those who just graduated in the winter quarter and those who are graduating in the spring. A third of Americans were unable to pay rent in April. For all we know the school could get shut down in the fall, no one knows and it’s stupid to expect the higher ups to know what will happen in 5 months when school starts on October 1. All they can provide is estimates and those might change because I’m sorry no one is able to control this virus. 

At least as students we can take out financial aid I like the millions of Americans who can’t even rely on that. We can find housing by taking out loans, I can’t say the same for the tens of millions of Americans. Maybe we’ll have to take out private loans but those exist for students at way larger amounts and better interest rates than for individuals. It sucks but the whole thing sucks and to put it in perspective students are going to be way better off than a lot of people who aren’t in school and end up getting evicted after this is all over and they have months of unpaid rent and end up homeless. At least there’s a solution for students, a sucky solution albeit but it does exist."
UCI,fokf1kz,t1_fokc2r3,1587840867.0,"UCI is just trying to keep less people from being infected? What would be your solution? Have everyone in triples and quads and risk a higher chance of infection? 

How was UCI supposed to know that the pandemic would still be this bad at this time? All they’re doing is trying to prevent students from getting covid. They’ve had guaranteed housing for freshmen for years and this years it’s out of their hands. No one could’ve guessed we would have a pandemic. And it’s not like UCI can built hundreds of units within a couple of months to meet demand. If you want UCI to pay for your off campus housing well UCI has a budget like any business and maybe enough people can complain to get that approved, maybe not. Our government has way more resources than our school and yet they haven’t given everyone enough money, that 1200 isn’t going to cut it for most people. 

Lots of people and businesses made promises but hey this pandemic happened, whose fault is that? UCI is doing the best they can. Lots of people who are graduating wanted to get a job out of school...well know they won’t be able to. This whole thing sucks but you can’t put all the blame on UCI for trying to decrease infections.

Edit: so I wouldn’t say it’s an admin fuck up it’s a pandemic fuck up, and everyone is constantly scrambling changing decisions by the day...no one knows what’ll happen in a week or two weeks the best they can do is guess. What if suddenly the virus becomes way more deadly and the mortality rate becomes 25% of all cases and school gets canceled. Are you going to blame the school? All UCI is doing is responding to decisions by the higher ups and everyone is in the hands of the pandemic. If UCI was fully in charge of the situation they would do more, but they’re not because they’re in the hands of COVID and it would be absurd if you blame UCI for that"

Since TJs doesn’t allow using the bags I carry them and put all of my items back into the cart. After I walk out of the store I put everything into my reusable bags. Initially when they were still allowing reusable bags I would just pack things myself at the counter but that’s not even allowed now. Honestly I get the bagger not wanting to touch other people’s bags but come on, I’ve already touched all the items you want to bag. And then if people are so worried about reusable bags, they shouldn’t let the bagger (an additional person touch their groceries). And then people commented that bags are dirty well thing is women put their purses on the counter when they check out to pull out their wallet, I looked it up and the bottom of a purse can have millions of bacteria particles. How many places does a bag go to in comparison to a purse? Way less plus we wash our bags.

OP it doesn’t hurt to appeal...I got two different emails a few years back. One a rejection for the general app and one an acceptance via the TAG app."
UCI,fo9embz,t1_fo990yf,1587617411.0,"Thing is though ACC is just like IC. Most people aren’t aware of this but UCI paid people’s cancelation fees since it’s counted as on campus housing. UCI spent tens of millions of dollars on this. So honestly I would expect any private company not willing to allow students to cancel their leases unless someone steps up to pay out. The safest bet is UCI on campus housing (not through ACC).

UCI,fo5aa9s,t1_fo50lhz,1587520943.0,Thank you
UCI,fo4xekn,t1_fo4d0im,1587513102.0,"Haha that made me laugh, great way to put it with the reference about a restaurant."
UCI,fo477n9,t3_g5ksom,1587499377.0,"OP have you been to Disney? The lines are super long and parking is expensive. After you go a few times you’ll prob be over it. I would just wait and try going once before you think of buying a pass. And if you’ve been wait to buy it until you find some friends that have passes. 

I grew up in OC and go to UCI now, in my whole time I’ve only had two friends that had passes and this was back in HS. 

I have friends that were super excited to go to Disney once they moved here from out of state/country and once they went they lost the idea to get a pass. Most people don’t have passes also.

Edit: Beaches and weather though yes those are great."
UCI,fo45yof,t1_fo3yzq8,1587498763.0,Ya...I need to send my transcript with the degree conferral to the masters program I got in still fall class registration is soon
UCI,fo3w6tq,t1_fo3t45t,1587493972.0,"Ah so you weren’t rejected through the general app? 

It seems like most of the people replying to OP weren’t rejected in the general app so there was no need to send a TAG acceptance. Versus I got rejected through the general app but admitted through TAG.

Edit: ap to app"
UCI,fo3az6a,t3_g54rpn,1587483781.0,I’m in the same boat. I did see that degree conferral is 4-6 weeks after our last quarter so I’m banking on May.
UCI,fo3a1fx,t3_g5bdxy,1587483305.0,"To answer your main question, yes. To answer your last question, some departments release what courses will be offered the coming year for all three quarters. Not all do, but if they do that helps see which classes will be offered. They don’t go more than a year ahead though.

Edit: So they’re a bit behind the times, they still only have this year’s courses listed. Some departments have already listed this coming year’s.

UCI,fo39gw4,t1_fo370fy,1587483010.0,Did you get into UCI with the TAG program? It seems like most of the people here got accepted with the main application and TAG.
urbanplanning,fo248gb,t1_fo15f8z,1587449229.0,I did this too. My instructor was like oh you can’t use a Mac and then a quarter of our class just used boot camp and partitioned our computers to being half windows and I got an A in the course. Didn’t have any issues.
orangecounty,fo23t7l,t3_g56934,1587448860.0,Sharetea at UTC (University Town Center)
orangecounty,fo23r0p,t1_fo1pozj,1587448810.0,"I would check out the UCI FBs like Class of 2021, 2022, etc. people have been posting that they need tutors including for math and pay $15-30/h"
UCI,fo20yyu,t1_fo1u7qd,1587446494.0,"That’s not true, my application to UCI was denied but my TAG was accepted.

Edit: OP they should give you two rejections if your TAG didn’t go through, I received two separate emails a few years back. One about the rejection and one about the acceptance.

Edit 2: I read through the rest of the comments on this post...from what I remember (this was a few years back) I got the TAG acceptance email a few days after the rejection email."
UCI,fo09lyg,t1_fo06ugf,1587408518.0,Ya you missed the deadline to withdraw from a course unless you receive a dean’s approval. You have until June 5th to switch to P/NP. If the course is to fulfill a school to major requirement yes it’s up to your dean & dpt if it can be a P/NP course. If it’s not one of those requirements you can switch to P/NP no worries.
UCI,fnzvjw5,t3_g4vnej,1587401494.0,"I’m an undergrad at UCI and next year will be in a masters at UCI. I didn’t do a P/NP for any of my GEs however I did fail Math 2B and retook it to get a D+. Still got in, not sure if that helps."
UCI,fnzudf2,t1_fnynohv,1587400914.0,"Precisely this, p/np courses don’t affect financial aid. However, generally you need a 2.0 GPA each quarter to meet the satisfactory academic progress financial aid requirement. According to the first question on the UCI site under financial aid (near the bottom of the page), a NP counts as an F = 0 for financial aid purposes. So if you’re enrolled in three 4 unit courses you can only fail one course, maybe even not that one. I don’t know what a P counts as, if a B then yes you could fail one course, but if it’s less than an B you can’t even fail one course.

https://www.reg.uci.edu/addl/faq_covid_pnp.html

Furthermore, if you end up failing all of your courses or receive below a 2.0 you will be ineligible for financial aid either summer or fall quarter (depending if you take summer courses). 

https://www.ofas.uci.edu/content/pdf/SAPDisclosureForUndergraduates.pdf

To get your aid reinstates you have to either successfully appeal or receive a 2.0 the following quarter."
UCI,fnyl32i,t3_g4etca,1587366466.0,I know people are mentioning large lecture halls but that’s for your general ed courses. Third and fourth year you should only be in small classes. I’ve had classes as small as 12-20 students. Generally about 30 though. General ed courses though are like 150-300 students
UCI,fnykx6c,t1_fny7pu2,1587366314.0,Lol idk if you’re being serious but for spring and summer quarters yes. Possibly fall too
nintendo,fnuahi4,t3_g3ptch,1587257909.0,My stepdad bought me a new bike seat and pole after mine had been stolen. Now at least I can go bike around to get some of my energy out being stuck at home all day. Small thought but it’s improved my past weeks by a lot.
UCI,fnu7ubf,t1_fnu2la3,1587256339.0,"I’m a little confused by that. I transferred three years ago and using assist not all of my courses had an equivalent at UCI (so I guess not transferrable) but just the amount of units I took was enough and I did the IGETC path.

Edit: I would honestly just email one of your CC counselors"
