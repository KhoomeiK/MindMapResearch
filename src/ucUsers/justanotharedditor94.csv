wallstreetbets,fpmpfne,t1_fpmnubl,1588738337.0,If the companies the are heavily weighted in them are looking like they might cut dividends then maybe. But a lot of high dividend companies are pretty stable it seems.

wallstreetbets,fpftqah,t1_fpftdt2,1588583151.0,Me and my wife are there at least once every couple months. Only thing keeping me from flying out tomorrow is the quarantine. You gotta pay $1400 per person and you‚Äôre pretty much in jail. We shoulda went last month before they started it.
wallstreetbets,fpft6iy,t1_fpfrzcm,1588582570.0,My in-law is a relatively high ranking government official. He‚Äôs not worried yet. So I‚Äôm not either.
wallstreetbets,fpfrmrj,t3_gcx8rv,1588580997.0,Been debating whether it‚Äôs worth the 14 day quarantine to go live in Korea with in-laws for a couple months and be in a normal place again.
wallstreetbets,fpfqank,t1_fpfq2js,1588579636.0,Well tell that to Honda. I think they also put vacuums in their cars too.

wallstreetbets,fpfpjwr,t3_gcx8rv,1588578890.0,Been driving a new 7 series for a week. Never knew why people want cars like that but definitely do now. Makes my car feel like a damn 2008 Kia.
wallstreetbets,fpfotgf,t1_fpfn2ps,1588578157.0,Heard from a pretty reliable person in SK that one of his bodyguards tested positive. And he went away to quarantine.

wallstreetbets,fp39dex,t1_fp394mt,1588275367.0,I mean people also changed what they spent money on. It‚Äôs really a coin toss.
wallstreetbets,fp38ci6,t1_fp35gf6,1588274855.0,Guess that means it‚Äôs time for me to hop on some calls.
wallstreetbets,fp36b59,t1_fp363ke,1588273842.0,I‚Äôm probably going to lose more money buying calls again.
wallstreetbets,fp34yie,t3_gaszeo,1588273163.0,Is anyone playing UBER/LYFT?

wallstreetbets,fp14b9j,t1_fp13piz,1588224029.0,"I‚Äôd see where we open tomorrow. If MSFT and FB launch us to 300 then maybe those calls make sense. If not you could try and day trade those, but I wouldn‚Äôt buy those wanting to hold  overnight."
wallstreetbets,fp13aqi,t1_fp12lce,1588223239.0,Bold. But maybe wait on a good red day before buying stupid OTM calls like that. The premium you‚Äôll pay on a green day isn‚Äôt really worth the risk on those imo unless we‚Äôre really going parabolic.
wallstreetbets,fp03n9p,t1_fp03iy4,1588201873.0,I‚Äôm the least optimistic on AAPL. Still wouldn‚Äôt buy puts.

wallstreetbets,fp00n7c,t1_fp00hqx,1588200270.0,These strikes on the 5/15 puts keep getting higher and higher...and you guys keep buying them.
wallstreetbets,fp0067t,t1_fozzdz7,1588200020.0,But if American equities continue to expand and maintain status as the best in the world then how does our economic growth slow? I honestly don‚Äôt understand.
wallstreetbets,fozp673,t3_gagmei,1588194436.0,I shoulda bought more calls. Got scared after blowing up over 8k last week on FDs.
wallstreetbets,fozo8tz,t3_gagmei,1588193978.0,"Buy QQQ instead of SPY, I tell myself. Never listen."

wallstreetbets,fozauut,t1_fozaj5j,1588187573.0,I‚Äôm feeling like only one will beat. But hopefully both. If neither then I‚Äôm out 5k on FDs I guess.
wallstreetbets,fozanaj,t1_foz96md,1588187473.0,It is when you withdraw it. Feels great when 50k RH deposit hits the bank account.
wallstreetbets,fozagfo,t1_foz9003,1588187382.0,MSFT and FB beats take us over for sure.

wallstreetbets,foz8gnt,t1_foz89mw,1588186429.0,Just means this isn‚Äôt even the pump yet. 310c 5/1.
wallstreetbets,foz50z2,t1_foz4mij,1588184796.0,Always at least one question that gets him.
wallstreetbets,foz4sgj,t1_foz4kyj,1588184684.0,Yah but if I remember correctly during Q&A we‚Äôve pulled back. Not that it affects overall trend upward.
wallstreetbets,foz4ium,t3_ga6tlc,1588184557.0,Don‚Äôt we sell off every time Powell has to answer questions from the press?

wallstreetbets,foz1i86,t1_foz1e86,1588183067.0,Not even sure if that‚Äôs positive or negative at this point.
wallstreetbets,foz1ark,t1_foz0zn2,1588182966.0,"I wrote a yelp review yesterday because my food didn‚Äôt come with buffalo sauce. That‚Äôs probably what caused this.

Sorry bout that."

wallstreetbets,foyus3y,t1_foyulxp,1588179555.0,Probably the move since I bailed on mine to FOMO into spy.
UCI,foytcbf,t1_foxy1e1,1588178797.0,"Remember that all these decisions are being made in real time. It‚Äôs easy to look back and think about how they‚Äôve made mistake or how good other countries are doing relative to us. But that is due to hindsight bias. It‚Äôs very hard to come with the correct answers to problems like this in real time and there is going to be changes as we move along and circumstances change. Everyone just has to accept that.

So when they come out with vague goals it‚Äôs probably due to them not watching to jump the gun on something. Because they do not know how future events may unfold. It seems like things are improving so the mood is vaguely optimistic, but that could also change as circumstances change. This event reminds me of the military. You don‚Äôt have control over what going on around you,but you have control over yourself. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating to not know or be in control but that‚Äôs just how it is."
UCI,foysbix,t3_gabb10,1588178261.0,"Freshman? 

You can always try to transfer later if so. But I wouldn‚Äôt go into debt for online classes. Or at the very least go with the most cost effective option."
wallstreetbets,foyrpqc,t1_foyrkjz,1588177944.0,Yay. Now we‚Äôre on the road to recovery. Just gotta get it back to where it was before all this happened.
wallstreetbets,foyr876,t1_foyq7jm,1588177689.0,If these companies are shooting up on terrible earnings. WMT must be poised to tank on their earnings.
wallstreetbets,foypr9n,t3_ga6tlc,1588176914.0,Long calls bleed 30% over a week...buy 1 May 300c and make 30% in an hour. Why the hell did I ever do that shit?

UCI,fotlqg4,t1_fotca8p,1588057882.0,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I wish there was a way I could help you apart from saying that, but I do hope you can get some time for yourself. Maybe get some headphones?"
UCI,fotkxo4,t1_fotidrn,1588057150.0,"Yes but what are you doing about it? Getting upset? How does that make your life any less stressful?

The one thing I‚Äôve learned from dumb resiliency classes is that it‚Äôs important to focus on what you can control, not what you can‚Äôt. It sounds dumb but will make you life a lot easier. I can‚Äôt control what the government or other people do, but I can control how I react to it. And I‚Äôm not just gonna sit inside and be pissed off when I could be doing something productive and taking advantage of the vast amount of free time that‚Äôs been given to us.

UCI,fosy804,t1_fosxfly,1588040550.0,SE Asia is the best. I‚Äôve been at least once or twice a year and it‚Äôs great. This year hopefully I can still make Europe. But seems unlikely.
wallstreetbets,fosxvof,t1_fosxeau,1588040344.0,"Yah a lot of small businesses start with $0. Me and my wife make ~2k a month taking care a rich people dogs part time during school. 

But she‚Äôs also into making gourmet dog treats, and I‚Äôm trying to learn how to wash/groom dogs. So that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre gonna work on."
UCI,foswx7x,t1_fosw8ss,1588039757.0,"Congrats on doing good enough to have such a stable amount of options to you at the moment! I‚Äôm waiting to start a business so I‚Äôm just hoping for things to go back to normal before diving in.

My travel plans got ruined too. But hopefully this ends sooner than expected because I‚Äôve been dying to get out of the country again for a while."
UCI,fost17x,t1_fos6whl,1588037446.0,"I hope it works out for you. The job market now is no doubt tough, and will probably be so for at least the short term. But you can always change, and remember adversity is a part of life. If you embrace it you‚Äôll be very successful."

wallstreetbets,fos0rd7,t1_forxi0i,1588021883.0,Seriously. I‚Äôm using some of my gains to start a business once this shit is over. Why do people think they‚Äôre actually an investor and not a gambler?
wallstreetbets,fos04ry,t1_forzwje,1588021556.0,I know. It should be bears showing loss porn and bitching about how it‚Äôs not fair they didn‚Äôt take profits.

wallstreetbets,forvjhl,t1_forubue,1588019256.0,I think it‚Äôs been pretty profitable during this time to buy at open and sell before close every day. So probably a lot of people doing that.
