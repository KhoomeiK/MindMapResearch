TheExpanse,fpmvmf7,t3_gede3l,1588742951.0,I really like the version of it that played for one of the season 4 trailers.
AskReddit,fpmtjy5,t1_fpm1pc6,1588741344.0,"This reminds me about that time some girls accused me of pissing in the school pool. This was around year 2 of primary school so when I was five or six. Previously some kid took a dump in the pool. I remember it quite well since it was a perfect turd that sunk to the bottom that everyone in class could see after the teacher got us all to get out. 

I don’t remember how much longer after that, we were in the pools again (a weeks later?). For some reason I lifted my swimming togs to see my penis kinda waving around in the water... dumb decision...but some girls saw me and said I was taking a piss..."
TheExpanse,fpj88oh,t3_gdokwb,1588659573.0,"Serialized shows have spoiled me from episodic shows, especially high caliber serial shows such as the Expanse. Even with some of my favorite shows such as SG1 or TNG, some episodes are really boring."
UCSD,fp53fgj,t3_gb8r9g,1588315043.0,Well... I haven’t been taking classes seriously either so

GetMotivated,fnxexlb,t3_g484jv,1587337230.0,I bet he was thinking of Sandra Bullocks
thesims,fnn7ly9,t1_fnkv5if,1587086167.0,"No, but why the question?"
funny,fnkwe0b,t3_g2dj54,1587041667.0,My life is just a tad more complete having seen this.
AskMen,fnkvs3s,t3_g2ajxw,1587041228.0,"A little unrelated, but I saw an Ellen clip of Keanu Reeves being shown a clip of Sandra Bullocks saying she had a crush on him during filming of Speed. Keanu gets super shy and says “she obviously didn’t know I had a crush on her.” Needless to say, I’ve watched almost an hour of clips of their interviews together, and their friendship over the decades.

Fictional romance wise, I’m loving this anime called Kaguya Sama Love is War. It’s about two members of a high school student council that are into each other, but to declare their love first is seen as losing. They scheme really funny scenarios in order to get the other to confess. Really funny anime I highly recommend."
thesims,fnkufjq,t3_g2cwbv,1587040229.0,Very homely. Looks like those building diorama kits.
AskMen,fnkubuz,t1_fnks3ow,1587040151.0,"True, but video games are inanimate objects. They don’t care if you play with other video games. Girlfriends and wives are people with feelings. Onlyfans seem like a step above regular porn. If I was in a relationship, I’d be more upset about a partner following a specific Instagram person rather than just watching regular porn."
thesims,fnh3kcx,t3_g1n2u0,1586953924.0,"This is an unexpected crossover, but in lovin it. Oblivion was my favorite Elder Scrolls game."
AskReddit,fnh22j5,t1_fngphwx,1586952741.0,"Man, you guys got responsible at such a young age. I hope to one day do adult right, and take care of some children who need loving homes. For now, I need to learn to take care of myself ha ha."

movies,fmquo7i,t1_fmqmdqh,1586307438.0,Almost sounds like a kaiju’s roar. I’ve been watching a lot of Showa era Ultramans.
TheExpanse,fmofyqz,t3_fw9ccj,1586257602.0,"This sounds really good. Btw, would the Expanse season 5 be delayed because of covid-19?"
funny,fmn7t86,t3_fvznck,1586220029.0,Lol. My answers matched up exactly with his

Never heard of this song before."
Kaguya_sama,fmh4ktt,t3_fv6r0h,1586066547.0,I didn’t know how much ahead the manga was. I finished it all in 1 day in prep for season 2.
