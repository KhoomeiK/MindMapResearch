relationship_advice,foimrfo,t3_g7npb0,1587790702.0,"this is a sign of increased truth. sometimes people just have different sex drives, and she was likely very much worried that this would be a dealbreaker for you."
UCSantaBarbara,focg78y,t1_fobs5zk,1587670951.0,not the only prof but one that teaches it commonly
UCSantaBarbara,fobrqyv,t1_fobpbyb,1587662958.0,"Akemann is the last name and I would recommend taking 3a over his class. Chuck is the literal worst teacher ever. He once taught a class where 40% of students failed. His test distributions are always wack, and in an 800 person lecture after week one his teaching was so bad >50 people showed up. Avoid him at all costs. Also he gives homework with 85ish questions weekly."
UCSantaBarbara,fo3nby1,t3_g5aihi,1587489774.0,it’s super hard to watch lectures not even knowing how we’re gonna be tested

relationship_advice,fnrjy4c,t1_fnrgsaz,1587191329.0,i’d say try initiating the conversation about all this. also just ask your SO. i can’t really tell since obv i don’t know the specifics but being proactive about communication is important.
relationship_advice,fnrgp38,t1_fnrgk17,1587188418.0,"be as transparent as possible! tell your SO anything that you believe you would want to know if the roles were reversed and just be totally honest about your past/actions/ etc. relationships are built on truth, trust, and communication. ask your SO if there’s anything they want to know and answer it honestly. going forward, don’t lie, even if it’s just withholding something or a lie by omission."
relationship_advice,fnrgj9m,t3_g3id4n,1587188282.0,what do you need to improve on?
UCSantaBarbara,fng8axq,t3_g1kxei,1586924814.0,they will submit them if you need them. email your ta and ask.

UCSantaBarbara,fmyodg7,t3_fy7nci,1586491176.0,i think your best bet would be to go super early
loseit,fmwzdft,t3_fxxayg,1586455709.0,"ranch dressing and bacon are both incredibly high in calories. it’s possible that they are not being accurately accounted for in your daily calorie count. also, clif and some other “protein” bars are basically candy bars masquerading as health food."
relationship_advice,fmwz77f,t3_fxxbco,1586455622.0,break up with him
UCSantaBarbara,fmuez85,t3_fxh3yn,1586390092.0,poli sci opted in
UCSantaBarbara,fmqrt9p,t3_fwsubb,1586305683.0,i’d recommend community college classes if you are at all worried about money. same or higher quality classes (probs smaller class sizes with more personal interaction w profs) and much cheaper. plus if you go to like an sbcc you’ll get a similar social scene.
UCSantaBarbara,fmpu21a,t3_fwoyrb,1586287338.0,i’d look on the facebook page for ucsb housing
AmItheAsshole,fmns8l9,t3_fwdwlj,1586233833.0,YTA- What gives you the right to “revoke” her choice?
UCSantaBarbara,fmkfl7x,t3_fvseyy,1586153290.0,i’d be down for whatever but maybe i’d explore options other than groupme cause yeah the notifications can be a little overwhelming and i feel like they usually die out cause people just mute them
