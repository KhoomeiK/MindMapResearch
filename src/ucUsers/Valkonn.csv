The second kid knocks on my door and I can tell they’re together and he made a mistake because I’d already said no to his friend.

It was ridiculous. Finally I told him “I don’t care” when he said he was starving or some bullshit and he just sighed like a child and turned around. I honestly felt like I was going to get into a physical fight with him."

AskReddit,fp1cf08,t1_fp1c12u,1588230919.0,"The classic American breakfast is eggs, pancake, sausage or bacon, and coffee.

Not that much sugar. Pancakes are not super sweet unless you want them sweet. Most people eat them with butter and a bit of syrup.

A quick breakfast is cereal and milk which is definitely not ideal but it is convenient. Some cereals have less sugar than others though. It's mainly kids cereals which have a ton of sugar. (Not healthy for the kids)"

I prefer formal attire. However I gotta say I don’t like business skirts. They look tight and uncomfortable. Women look good in slacks."

Sorry but I’d feel embarrassed being out in public next to someone who had a hairstyle like that. That’s completely their choice of course but I am definitely not attracted to that look."

You'll go from baking a few times a month to baking once or twice a week because it's so much easier. My parents have one and I love it.

When you take your cast iron pizza out of the oven you need to put it on the stovetop on medium-high heat in order to crisp up the bottom. There's no way a home oven is getting hot enough to crisp it up enough.

If you do this then it should have enough structural integrity to not fall apart when you take it out."

It's like asian rice. There is always unflavored beans on hand."
