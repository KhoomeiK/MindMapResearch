UCSD,fpf5t82,t1_fpdo5aw,1588562483.0,I took the placement exam last year and got into 20A. It's near identical to the practice exam that's online somewhere. Take that and study the areas you messed up on and you should get in the math course you want.
UCSD,fp3jfb8,t3_gb2k8e,1588280350.0,"Mechanical engineering is one of the hardest majors to switch into. They rank you based on GPA and begin selecting from the top down. If you are not confident that you can get a 4.0, it's better if you go to a different school. Study what you want versus being miserable and studying something you're just settling for."
UCSD,fp2ji3f,t3_gao9ox,1588262827.0,"First couple weeks were alright, but yeah week 4 and 5 stuff have been hella difficult."
UCSD,fowxjal,t1_fowkbe5,1588129304.0,"Math/econ is capped with the math department and uncapped with the econ department. If you change with the econ department, it should be as easy as a click of a button."
UCSD,foiggvo,t3_g7l5pw,1587786075.0,Worth saying that incoming Freshman aren't giving first and second passes and just a single appointment time when they select all their classes at once. So it all really depends on what time you're randomly given and webreg not crashing (like last year lmao).
CreditCards,fohysej,t1_fohk0ql,1587775288.0,I'm a student so the only way I can reach that is if they take the absolute value of my net worth :(
CreditCards,fofth32,t1_foeku7o,1587742531.0,I don't use Amtrak these days because of quarantine. This is for when quarantine lifts and I have to commute to and from campus again.
UCSD,fodtcn6,t3_g6uugg,1587689751.0,"From https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major, cog sci transfers for fall 2019 had a GPA range of 3.31-3.74 with an admit rate of 75%. But like a commentator above me said, the UCs take most of their transfers from community colleges so results for a 4-year to 4-year may be different."
UCSD,fo6rv2p,t1_fo66kk8,1587565522.0,"If you look on piazza, she said that she was waiting for how the DSC 80 exam to finish before doing the same thing to DSC 30. Do might as well study this since it's probably what we're going to have to do ;("
UCSD,fnwbnlr,t1_fnv8j96,1587315285.0,"The Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan isn't a grant of it's own but more like a guarantee that your tuition and fees will be covered entirely by grants. Since you qualify, you should get an extra grant with the name of ""UCSD Grant-in-Aid""."
UCSD,fnipb1w,t1_fnin4b6,1586983971.0,"MAE is one of the hardest majors to switch into. Unless you are 1000% confident that you can get an A in the rest of the screening courses, you shouldn't go here. It's not worth the risk of not getting your major and having to study something you don't really want to/ having to transfer out."
CreditCards,fnhuu1h,t1_fnhm1v9,1586969224.0,"Credit cards are smart regardless how much money you have. For instance, purchase protection (if a merchant you use your debit card with gets hacked, its much more harder to get your money back versus a credit card), extended warranties (You can spend the extra money and buy a new phone if it breaks off warranty, or you can just use the extended warranty your card gives you), etc. Of course, you don't absolutely need these things if you can just cough up the cash yourself. However, just because you got a lot of money doesn't mean that you should spend more than you have to. Plus, tons of cards give you cash back and who doesn't like more money?"
UCSD,fnc3290,t1_fnc0s9c,1586827575.0,"I can't speak for the upper-divs, but the lower-divs are pretty hard. Expect to spend 6-7 hours per week on each course with some of the more harder courses requiring 12-14 hours a week (notably the programming ones e.g DSC 20, 30, and 80). Of course, these are just averages and may increase or decreasing depending on your own programming and/or statistics experience. 

I don't know how likely it is to find a data science job with just a bachelors. A majority of the current positions out there require masters, PhDs, or a couple years of experience. However, the major and field is brand new so I expect things to change as more and more people become capable trained data scientists and not just mathematicians and computer scientists who changed fields.

Its definitely possible to double major depending on how many AP credits you come in with and the college. If you're in Warren, you could do a PofC in economics (since you already have to do a social sciences PofC anyway) and petition a couple of your econ upper-div courses as data science electives which makes a double major in econ essentially half the amount of classes outside the mandatory GE and major classes you would have to take."
UCSD,fn8vnru,t1_fn8ejfw,1586751471.0,"Bio's one of the easier capped majors to switch into. From the [bio department's capped major website](https://biology.ucsd.edu/education/undergrad/admission/capped-major.html#Admission-Statistics)
> In 2017-18 and 2018-19, the Division received an average of 90 applications per quarterly cycle and was able to offer admission to all applicants who met Capped Major admission criteria."
UCSD,fmx5igo,t3_fxxzpc,1586458826.0,I don't know how you do it. I feel like 16 units is too much for an unmotivated me and if it weren't for the pass/ no pass option I would have dropped down to 12 already.
UCSD,fmt8pir,t1_fmsm7iv,1586368654.0,Each college has their own apartments so no. You'd end up in Warren apartments while your friend would end up in Marshall apartments.
UCSD,flnivr5,t1_flniokm,1585319542.0,16 units as always. I totally was not expecting to wake up to this.
