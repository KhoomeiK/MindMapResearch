UCSantaBarbara,fp3tnsi,t3_gapxm4,1588285599.0,This is fantastic. Don't know why you're warning people. Cheaters should fail. The only good thing about this is that you're spreading the word so cheaters might be incentivized to not cheat.
RocketLeagueEsports,foc4k05,t3_g6j83m,1587667025.0,"Imagine any other major sport. The pro teams should be beating amateur teams. If you can't beat them, then that's your fault and they earned it."
UCSantaBarbara,foc3po9,t3_g6r4fx,1587666757.0,"If this is in reference to 137A, you're absolutely right. Luckily, my other classes have been fine. But 137A. What was she thinking?"
UCSantaBarbara,fo7au0w,t3_g64qa4,1587575188.0,"Our grades appear to be dependent on each other. She awards grades based on who scores the highest in the class.

But wow. Half of that was nothing like the practice tests. And it didn't feel like enough time."
UCSantaBarbara,fo77pc3,t1_fo76vrq,1587573680.0,"Article on Bloomberg:
""As of Sunday, Sweden had reported 1,540 deaths tied to Covid-19, an increase of 29 from Saturday. Thatâ€™s considerably more than in the rest of Scandinavia, but much less than in Italy, Spain and the U.K., both in absolute and relative terms.""

So no I don't realize what you just said. Plenty of sources say Sweden is doing well. And let's focus on what you haven't considered: They will avoid much of the consequences that we will face for shutting down. You don't seem to have accounted for that.

And then you have South Korea, who is doing better than us. They didn't shutdown either.

These nations will avoid a lot of the problems that you seem to not even care about, while having a slight increase in their mortality from the virus. They're doing fine because they've been protecting the vulnerable people. If you don't have an underlying condition, and you're not over 45, then your chances of living are almost 100%, even if you contract the virus."
UCSantaBarbara,fo76n5k,t1_fo75tnq,1587573160.0,"It's a lot more than the way you're framing it. The shutdown is hurting everyone. Many people are going bankrupt, having their credit scores devastated, and will get sick/die from other medical issues that are a product of the shutdown. This affects people's livelihoods. Sweden is reporting success even though they didn't totally shutdown. We can minimize all the issues I just mentioned (which are just a few) and keep the virus deaths down. To say we can't is just fear mongering. Other countries have made it work and have been successful. Sure, our per capita mortality rate numbers are really good (compared internationally), but that ignores the harm done by locking everyone down on house arrest. We can keep this up for that much longer. Things will become far, far worse than the damage that the virus could have ever done. Like I said, we can fight both issues... No need for tunnel vision."
UCSantaBarbara,fo74pc0,t1_fo72bul,1587572202.0,"Nah, I'm right. It would be stupid to only listen to an economic doctor in this time. And it's also stupid to only listen to a medical one. We need to listen to both then weigh the costs. That shouldn't be a controversial take, but everyone has tunnel vision."
UCSantaBarbara,fo6ucmy,t1_fo6tev7,1587566888.0,"The shutdown is not middle ground. Be real. The shutdown overreaction is on one end and ""do nothing"" is on the other. Either way, the middle ground isn't always the right answer of course, but in this case it is. It would cause less overall harm to find a balance rather than seriously hurt a lot more people. There is a balance, and we are nowhere near it. We could learn from a country like Sweden, perhaps. They haven't shut everything down and they're doing well."
UCSantaBarbara,fo6g7rx,t1_fo5o9z9,1587557920.0,"The protesting is a result of our government's overreaction. We should find some sort of rational middle ground that takes the entire issue into perspective. Having tunnel vision on the virus will lead to plenty of unintended (and likely devastating consequences). We need to stop being ignorant of a whole side of the issue, and rather make an educated decision based on all the factors."
UCSantaBarbara,fo6fzi9,t3_g5vbnm,1587557735.0,"We're going about this all incorrectly. Unfortunately, we have tunnel vision on the virus, so we will do whatever it takes to limit its effect, regardless of the consequences. And that's probably going to lead to more harm, overall, rather than a balanced approach based on full knowledge. Right now, we're making decisions from a point of ignorance, as we're only taking one side of the issue into account. Intentions mean little. Consequences mean a lot more. If we actually took a look at the whole picture, we could make an educated decision, and strike a proper balance between reopening our economy, protecting those who are very vulnerable to the virus, and social distancing within our daily lives.

But that's probably not going to happen without more public pressure, so we'll keep making uneducated decisions and become victims of our own tunnel vision."
UCSantaBarbara,fo6fldn,t3_g5xeqn,1587557409.0,"Smh. This may be a meme, but lots of people actually think like this. People are defending acts that are quite clearly morally wrong, such as cheating.

The institution, UCSB, isn't the primary victim of cheating, so let's stop acting like there's some sort of justice in this. The primary victim of cheating is the rest of us who don't cheat. Stop trying to justify it.

The system is clearly messed up because it does little to combat the truth about human nature: We are selfish and will look out for our best interest. So lots of people will cheat, and the flawed system will allow them to get away with it. But that doesn't make it right to join in on something wrong and cheat out your classmates. It's still a bad thing and it's indefensible."
UCSantaBarbara,fo57sex,t1_fo57he1,1587519366.0,Just to be clear. Mod = simp
UCSantaBarbara,fo57q96,t1_fo57he1,1587519329.0,"You can say a lot of stuff, unless it's culturally unpopular with this demographic of young people. When that's the case, they shut you down. Even if it's a very mainstream view (which shouldn't matter if we are in an open exchange of ideas, as it's college). Hard to win the war of ideas when only one side is allowed to participate."
UCSantaBarbara,fo576t6,t1_fo571pc,1587518993.0,"Oh ok. Yeah, that's stupid. People want to whine"
